00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,201
<i>Hello, darling.
It's your mother.</i>

3
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,770
<i>Thank you for showing me
your new apartment. Um...</i>

4
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,367
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

5
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,721
<i>I mean, how can you
live like that?</i>

6
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,931
<i>Anyway, would you call me back?
Let's get together again.</i>

7
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,126
<i>I love you.</i>

8
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,526
<i>Control.</i>

9
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,125
<i>It's all about control.</i>

10
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,641
<i>Every dictatorship
has one obsession.</i>

11
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,201
And that's it.

12
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,079
So, in ancient Rome,

13
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,601
they gave the people
bread and circuses.

14
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,524
They kept the populace
busy with entertainment.

15
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,369
But other dictatorships use other
strategies to control ideas.

16
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,290
The knowledge.

17
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,249
How do they do that?

18
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,090
Lower education.

19
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,729
They limit culture.

20
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,811
Censor information.

21
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,561
They censor any means of
individual expression.

22
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,919
And it's important to remember
this, that this is a pattern

23
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,805
that repeats itself
throughout history.

24
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,641
Okay.

25
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,163
See you next week.

26
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,120
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

27
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,286
How are you?

28
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,401
I'm good.

29
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,284
<i>See, every dictatorship,</i>

30
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,959
there's only one obsession
and that's control,

31
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,083
they want to have control
over the people.

32
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,967
In ancient Rome, they
gave bread and circuses,

33
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,848
<i>they kept the populace
busy with entertainment.</i>

34
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,327
<i>In other dictatorships,
they have other strategies.</i>

35
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,679
<i>To limit information, to
limit ideas and knowledge.</i>

36
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,526
<i>How do they do that?</i>

37
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,970
<i>They lower education,
limit culture.</i>

38
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,169
<i>They censor any means
of self-expression.</i>

39
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,010
<i>But it's important to remember
this, this is a pattern</i>

40
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,601
<i>that repeats itself</i>

41
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,370
<i>throughout history.</i>

42
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,366
You don't go to the
movies, do you?

43
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,681
Movies?

44
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,529
Yeah, are you a movie guy?

45
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,204
In your free time, I mean?

46
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,642
I don't know,

47
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,328
I don't go out that much, I
don't really like movies.

48
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,679
Oh.

49
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,679
You don't have to go out to
enjoy a good flick at home.

50
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,166
That's true.

51
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,482
I usually just rent them.

52
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,879
Most people don't these days,

53
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,321
but it's what I do.

54
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,199
Is there a reason why
you're asking me this?

55
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,401
No.

56
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,719
'Cause you brought it up and
I thought, you know, maybe

57
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,159
you had a recommendation, or
you saw a movie that you liked

58
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,839
and you want to
tell me about it.

59
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,601
Oh, sure, I mean, there's
always something.

60
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,606
- I could go for something cheerful.
- Hmm.

61
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,920
<i>Where There's a
Will There's a Way.</i>

62
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,446
It's true.

63
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,645
No, it's a movie, I saw it a
little while ago, but, um...

64
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,759
I remember, I liked it.

65
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,079
Hmm. <i>Where There's a
Will There's a Way.</i>

66
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,399
Yeah, that's it.

67
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,090
Local film, if you...

68
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,009
I'll keep it in mind.

69
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,724
I think I'm drunk.

70
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,964
You wanna go to bed?

71
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,481
Hmm?

72
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,690
You wanna go to bed?

73
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,879
No, I'm gonna finish
grading these papers

74
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,447
and then I'll come
join you, okay?

75
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,359
<i>Mr. Henderson, my
husband will be back.</i>

76
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,159
<i>Your husband just won a
heck lot of money from me.</i>

77
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,919
<i>By the look in his eye he
didn't have an intention to...</i>

78
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,161
Ow!

79
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,845
Stop!

80
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,681
Stop!

81
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,799
Okay, okay, okay.

82
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,850
What's wrong?

83
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,010
I'll call you tomorrow.

84
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,690
Sorry I'm late.

85
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,041
Uh...

86
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,841
All right.

87
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,679
Last class we talked
about dictatorship,

88
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,360
so today we'll start with Hegel.

89
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,405
It was Hegel who said that all the
greatest world events happen twice.

90
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,679
And then, Karl Marx added, the
first time it was a tragedy,

91
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,962
and the second time
it was a farce.

92
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,446
<i>It's strange to think...</i>

93
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,679
<i>A lot of the world's
thinkers are worried</i>

94
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,726
<i>that this century will be a
repetition of the last one.</i>

95
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,799
<i>And there's an interesting
observation, a creative act of memory</i>

96
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,279
<i>to remember something,
to remember somebody...</i>

97
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,363
I'm looking for <i>Call me L8R or
Passenger Without a Ticket.</i>

98
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,801
Shit.

99
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,682
Anthony?

100
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,251
Anthony!

101
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,799
Hey, long time no see!

102
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,759
I couldn't tell it was you with that beard.
Is that for a movie?

103
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,961
Yeah.

104
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,291
Man, you haven't been
around here for ages.

105
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,159
Yeah, I don't know
how long it's been.

106
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,885
Six months, I'd say.

107
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,359
Six months or more.

108
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,888
Yeah, so how's everything?

109
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,361
Great.

110
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,599
Are you meeting someone here?
'Cause there's no one around.

111
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,719
- No?
- No,

112
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,446
you know no one comes
in on Saturdays.

113
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,490
Oh...

114
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,969
I was supposed to
pick up the thing...

115
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,599
For the movie. Um...

116
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,919
And I forgot it was Saturday...
'Cause my head is, like...

117
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,639
You actors are something else.

118
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,199
Hold on, let me see if
there's anything for you.

119
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,401
Great.

120
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,759
Yeah, here it is, look.

121
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,159
Oh, that looks like it's it. That's
definitely it. That's definitely it.

122
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,119
- There you go. All right?
- Okay.

123
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,159
- Hey, don't be a stranger.
- I won't be.

124
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,479
Good luck with that movie.

125
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,886
Great, I will... Yes.

126
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,329
Anthony Claire.

127
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,123
3650 Rathburn Road.

128
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,159
<i>Hello?</i>

129
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,761
- Good afternoon, I'm calling...
- <i>Hey.</i>

130
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,159
Um, I'm calling to speak to...

131
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,479
<i>Where are you calling from?</i>

132
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,719
I'm sorry, I think there's
been a misunderstanding.

133
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,479
I'm calling to speak to
Daniel Saint Claire, the...

134
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,966
<i>Anthony?</i>

135
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,889
<i>Anthony, you called home.</i>

136
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,199
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

137
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,209
<i>What are you doing?</i>

138
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,439
My name's not Anthony.

139
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,599
<i>You're not Anthony?</i>

140
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,567
No, I'm calling to speak to Daniel
Saint Claire, the actor. Um...

141
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,919
If I'm not mistaken,
that's Anthony Claire's.

142
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,851
name that he uses
for the movies.

143
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,719
For his work.

144
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,649
<i>Right.</i>

145
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,119
<i>Right, well, Daniel
isn't here right now,</i>

146
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,288
<i>maybe I could get him
to call you back.</i>

147
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,644
Okay, I'm sorry to bother you.

148
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,685
<i>What?</i>

149
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,761
What?

150
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,925
I... I...

151
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,930
<i>Who is this?</i>

152
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,039
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

153
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,719
He doesn't know me.

154
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,119
No.

155
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,239
- Okay. I'm gonna...
- Anthony?

156
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,919
I'll call back later.

157
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,799
Hello?

158
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,923
Hello, this is Anthony...

159
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,599
This is Anthony
Claire, isn't it?

160
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,370
<i>Who's calling?</i>

161
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,599
Um...

162
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,639
I called before. I was talking...
I talked to your wife. Crazy.

163
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,319
<i>You're the one.</i>

164
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,999
<i>And you call here again, I
will call the police...</i>

165
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,249
I... No, no. Just hear me out.

166
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,129
Can you say something again?
Can you talk again?

167
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,679
<i>Who is this?</i>

168
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,079
That's crazy. That's amazing.

169
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,359
Our... Your voice is just like mine.
Do you hear my voice?

170
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,399
Your voice is just like mine.

171
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,931
Shit.

172
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,639
- Listen...
- Sorry, please, please, please.

173
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,839
Just listen to me for a second.

174
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,919
Just listen, okay?
Just hear me out.

175
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,879
I know this sounds crazy. I'm sorry.
I got excited before.

176
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,559
When I get excited, I just
act a little strange.

177
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,239
So just hear me
out for a second.

178
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,679
I've seen three of your movies.

179
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,719
And you're great in them.
You're great in them.

180
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,359
We look exactly alike.

181
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,639
And I called your
wife earlier today.

182
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,759
And she said that... She
thought that I was you.

183
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,879
And I'm just... I'm confused.

184
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,679
And I know this call must be just as
confusing for you as it is for me.

185
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,839
And I just... My name is Adam Bell.
I'm a history teacher.

186
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,883
And I just think
that we should meet.

187
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,919
Hey, hey, hey, okay. Okay.

188
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,124
Listen to me. Never
call here again.

189
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,839
Who was that?

190
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,883
It was that same guy.

191
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,959
What did he want?

192
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,159
I don't know. He sounded crazy.

193
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,799
Like, he sounded like a
stalker or something.

194
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,879
A stalker?

195
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,159
Yeah, he said that he
was a fan of mine.

196
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,125
That he wanted to, uh,
meet up or something.

197
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,845
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

198
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,845
- No.
- Yeah.

199
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,809
You're messing with me.

200
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,451
Right?

201
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,043
- Anthony?
- Uh...

202
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,170
Do you want to get
something to eat?

203
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,003
Who was on the phone?

204
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,999
Helen, the same guy who called before.
The same guy.

205
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,282
That's who was on the phone.

206
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,127
I told you that. Why would I
tell you any differently?

207
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,806
Are you lying to me?

208
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,685
I...

209
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,359
You're lying to me.

210
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,369
You're acting crazy.

211
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,999
I'm not crazy. Who
was on the phone?

212
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,965
I told you it was a man
who was on the phone.

213
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,004
Are you seeing her?

214
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,159
Helen, I don't want
to get into this.

215
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,328
Are you seeing her again?

216
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,399
We need to get something to eat.

217
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,519
Let's go get something
to eat and then...

218
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,759
I don't want to get anything...

219
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,361
it was a man! It was a man.

220
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,639
What do you think it
was, a jealous husband?

221
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,001
Yeah.

222
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,159
I don't want to get into this again.
Okay?

223
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,566
I don't want to get into this.

224
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,603
I'm going for a walk.

225
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,799
Yes.

226
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,879
<i>Yeah, it's me, man.</i>

227
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,959
That's so strange. I had a feeling
that you were gonna call.

228
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,242
<i>You had a feeling,
what's that mean?</i>

229
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,039
It's a, you know, just a figure of speech.
It's not...

230
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,719
<i>Right. All right. Well, look,
I've been thinking about it.</i>

231
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,410
<i>I want to meet.</i>

232
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,999
Okay.

233
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,279
<i>I know a place called
the Breezeway Inn.</i>

234
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,359
<i>It's about an hour outside the city.
Do you know where that is?</i>

235
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,759
No.

236
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,599
<i>All right. Well, then I'll call
you on Sunday with directions.</i>

237
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,439
<i>1:00, okay?</i>

238
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,519
Okay.

239
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,079
<i>All right.</i>

240
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,281
Uh-huh.

241
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,767
- Well, see you soon.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

242
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,802
<i>Yeah, I'll see you soon.</i>

243
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,281
Hello.

244
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,727
Hi.

245
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,926
Is everything all right?

246
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,245
How many months are you?

247
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,761
Uh...

248
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,085
Six.

249
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,090
That's nice.

250
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,050
I should be going. I have a
class, I have to teach in it.

251
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,966
Ah...

252
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,839
Never know how your day
is gonna turn out.

253
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,724
Have a nice day.

254
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,564
<i>What's up, honey?</i>

255
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,166
<i>Hello?</i>

256
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,686
<i>Hello?</i>

257
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,330
Hi.

258
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,448
It is a scorcher out there.

259
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,359
The last 10 minutes of my run,

260
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,999
this 22-year-old kid or
something like that, he was...

261
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,567
He was following
me the whole time.

262
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,044
Never gonna beat this kid.

263
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,199
And he dropped.

264
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,371
Do you think that I should cut my
beard off 'cause it's fucking hot?

265
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,679
Wait, why did you call me earlier?
Did you call me for a reason?

266
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,203
Honey, where are
the blueberries?

267
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,599
Where are the blueberries?

268
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,959
I told you, like, two days ago.

269
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,519
The organic blueberries. Not
the conventional blueberries.

270
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,563
I can't use 'em in the shake.

271
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,839
What's wrong?

272
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,399
<i>I wasn't... Only I was
saying 'cause I read it</i>

273
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,719
<i>in a magazine that blueberries,</i>

274
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,322
<i>the organic ones are better
than conventional ones...</i>

275
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,120
Are you gonna tell
me what's wrong?

276
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,891
I...

277
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,610
I went to...

278
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,808
I went to see that guy.

279
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,561
Who? What're you talking about?

280
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,079
The guy on the phone.

281
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,328
I went to his work.

282
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,359
Why did you do that?
That's dangerous, honey.

283
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,289
I wanted to know.

284
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,690
Are you okay?

285
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,607
He had the same voice.

286
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,521
He looks exactly like you.

287
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,960
What do you mean,
"Exactly like me"?

288
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,120
What's happening?

289
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,323
I don't... Really don't know
what you're talking about.

290
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,610
I think you know.

291
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,004
I think you know.

292
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,806
Hello?

293
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,971
I told you.

294
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,567
- Show me your hands, man.
- Why?

295
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,363
Come on, show me your hands.

296
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,241
Maybe we're brothers.

297
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,328
We're not... We're not brothers.
We're not brothers.

298
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,410
How do you know?

299
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,370
Do you have a...

300
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,091
Do you have a scar
on your chest?

301
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,765
This one?

302
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,929
You do, don't you?

303
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,479
I, uh...

304
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,604
- When's your birthday?
- This was a bad idea.

305
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,282
I think I made a mistake here.

306
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,761
Um...

307
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,599
I have a...

308
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,919
I have this. I went to...

309
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,719
The company that represents you,

310
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,719
they gave that to me... To you.

311
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,809
I'm sorry.

312
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,651
I'm sorry.

313
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,999
Don't worry, honey.

314
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,043
That guy won't be
calling here again.

315
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,040
Fuck.

316
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,799
There must be some difference.

317
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,047
There isn't.

318
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,207
It cannot be exactly the same.

319
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,805
We are.

320
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,759
Did you take your clothes
off in front of him?

321
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,007
No.

322
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,559
Okay, then.

323
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,330
You didn't eat.

324
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,731
The last thing you need is to be
meeting strange men in hotel rooms.

325
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,051
You have enough trouble sticking
with one woman, don't you?

326
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,566
Here.

327
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,161
I don't like blueberries.

328
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,087
Of course you do, and
they're good for you.

329
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,925
I am going to pretend I never heard
a word of what you just told me.

330
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,039
I just wanted your advice.

331
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,722
You don't want advice. I don't
want to hear any more about this.

332
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,925
You are my only son.

333
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,206
I am your only mother.

334
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,603
You have a respectable job,
you have a nice apartment,

335
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,485
and since we're
being frank here,

336
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,319
I think you should
quit that fantasy

337
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,602
of being a third-rate
movie actor.

338
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,047
Eat those. You want some coffee?

339
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,602
<i>I have a question for you.</i>

340
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,089
Did you fuck my wife?

341
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,448
Did you fuck my wife? Did
you sleep with my wife?

342
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,885
You fucked my wife!

343
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,725
Did you fuck my wife?

344
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,651
That's good. That
is fuckin' good.

345
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:00,119
This is what's gonna happen. You're
giving me your clothes and your car.

346
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:04,041
I'm gonna take your girlfriend
on a little romantic getaway.

347
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,603
<i>Tomorrow, I bring her home.</i>

348
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,567
<i>And I'm gonna come back here,</i>

349
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,846
<i>bring back all your things, and I'm
gonna disappear from your life forever.</i>

350
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,009
<i>And then I'll be gone.</i>

351
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,041
What are you doing here?

352
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,204
What the fuck is this place, man?
You live here?

353
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,559
I have some questions for you.

354
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,250
Please go or I'll
call the police.

355
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,879
Go ahead, call the police.
What are you gonna tell 'em?

356
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,604
What are you gonna
tell 'em, man?

357
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,201
Why'd you come looking for me?

358
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,561
I don't know. I don't know.
I just...

359
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,401
I needed to know.

360
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,479
You need to know. Yeah. Okay.

361
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:16,049
But when you called my house,
you talked to my wife.

362
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,169
Why'd you do that?

363
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,479
She happened to
pick up the phone.

364
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,045
Okay. Yeah, but...

365
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,410
Can I ask you something,
just man to man?

366
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,961
Um...

367
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,804
Did you sleep with my wife?

368
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,399
I don't know what
you're talking about.

369
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,443
Did you fuck my wife?

370
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,327
This is crazy.

371
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,399
Just answer the question, man.

372
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,568
Just answer my fuckin' question
and then I will leave.

373
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,801
You're fuckin' crazy.

374
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,725
All right.

375
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,280
I'm fuckin' crazy?
I'm fuckin' crazy?

376
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,883
I'm fuckin' crazy?

377
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,124
I'm fuckin' crazy?

378
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,649
You brought my wife
into this, man.

379
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,359
So I'm gonna bring your girlfriend
into the picture as well.

380
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,919
You want me out of your life? This
is what's gonna happen first.

381
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,559
You're gonna give me your
clothes and your car.

382
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,439
I'm gonna take your girlfriend
on a little romantic getaway.

383
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,799
I'm gonna bring her back home tomorrow,
and I'm gonna come back here,

384
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,919
and I'm gonna bring
back all your stuff

385
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,169
and I'm going to disappear
from your life forever.

386
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,763
Then we will be even.

387
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,804
Mr. Claire. Good afternoon.
Everything good?

388
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,048
Yeah, I just...

389
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,405
Uh, forgot my keys.

390
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,804
Is Mrs. Claire not home?

391
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,559
Do you want me to open
the door for you?

392
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,489
That'd be perfect. Yeah.

393
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,600
I can't stop thinking
about the other night.

394
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,409
Can't get it out of my head.

395
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,360
I know I shouldn't
talk about this,

396
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,723
but I'd love to go back.

397
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,321
Uh-huh.

398
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,846
I heard they changed the
lock and sent out new keys.

399
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,039
But...

400
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,005
I don't think I'm on the list.

401
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,090
I need to go back.

402
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,847
I'll see what I can do.
I don't...

403
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,604
I don't know if that's
going to be possible.

404
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,770
Call me if you hear anything.

405
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:29,961
After you.

406
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,119
Okay. Here you go, Mr. Claire.

407
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,481
Thank you.

408
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,166
Hello?

409
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,243
- Anthony?
- Hi.

410
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,721
The light's on, you
freaked me out.

411
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,561
Sorry.

412
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,761
What're you doing home? I
thought you were at your mom's.

413
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,327
Oh, I canceled it, I...

414
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,209
Should've called.

415
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,848
I stayed longer at the pool,

416
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,891
'cause I thought you
weren't gonna be home.

417
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,520
Uh...

418
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,525
Do you need anything?

419
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,961
I'm fine.

420
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,483
I'm gonna go to bed.

421
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,921
Okay.

422
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,206
Are you sure you
don't need anything?

423
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,485
'Cause you...

424
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,639
When you came in and you said
that you went to the pool,

425
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:01,039
I just thought maybe that you've
been there for a long time,

426
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,639
and you had to walk home or
whatever and you must be...

427
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,126
Is everything okay?

428
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,959
You're six months pregnant,
so I didn't know.

429
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,400
No, I'm fine.

430
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,723
Why don't you come to bed?

431
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,121
I...

432
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,731
Aren't you gonna take
your clothes off?

433
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,806
Yeah.

434
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,450
Did you have a good
day at school?

435
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,761
What?

436
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,205
Forget it.

437
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,799
What? What? What? Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

438
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,999
Mary. Mary. Mary.

439
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,881
<i>What's wrong?</i>

440
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,641
The ring. The mark
on your finger.

441
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,128
What are you talking about?

442
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,001
I've always had this.

443
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,728
No. No!

444
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,919
Who are you? Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

445
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,079
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

446
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,282
- Don't touch me!
- What are you talking about?

447
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,808
The ring. The mark
on your finger.

448
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,920
What's wrong?

449
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,330
What's wrong?

450
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,849
I just couldn't sleep.

451
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,688
Yeah, I couldn't sleep either.

452
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,290
I'm sorry.

453
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,368
Why are you doing this to me?

454
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,365
What? What am I doing to you?

455
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,729
I want you to stay.

456
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,359
- Stop the car.
- Stop the car? Stop the car?

457
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,359
<i>- Stop the fucking car.</i>
<i>- I'll stop the fucking car.</i>

458
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,721
<i>You want me to stop the car?</i>

459
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,401
Get out. I'm sick of this shit.

460
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,159
<i>I can't even talk to you.</i>

461
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,319
Fuck you.

462
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,840
You're behaving like a child.

463
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,879
<i>You're not a man.</i>

464
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,879
- I'm not a man?
- Enough. You don't need to get me started.

465
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,241
I'm not a man?

466
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,399
I'm not a fucking man?
Get out! Get out!

467
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,525
- Get out! Get the fuck out!
- Let go!

468
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,799
<i>Sunshine, a high of 24 today,</i>

469
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,367
<i>clear tonight with a low of 13.</i>

470
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,530
<i>Here's James with a
look at traffic.</i>

471
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,439
<i>The westbound Lake Shore is closed
between Bathurst and Strachan,</i>

472
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,769
<i>as crews clean up debris from a collision
that happened early this morning.</i>

473
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,879
<i>Police have not released
any details at this time,</i>

474
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,599
<i>but we do know there
was only one vehicle.</i>

475
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,361
I forgot to tell you
that your mother called.

476
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,879
You should probably
call her back.

477
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,081
Okay.

478
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,610
Helen, did you plan on
doing something tonight?

479
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,082
'Cause I think I have to go out.

480
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,851
Helen?

481
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,651
Helen?
