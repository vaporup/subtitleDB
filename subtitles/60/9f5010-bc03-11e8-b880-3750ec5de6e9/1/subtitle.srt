1
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,106
If you only knew
what I just dealt with.

2
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,817
I mean, this guy was right in
front of me, going little...

3
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,944
That guy deserves a ticket.
I'm sure he's...

4
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,238
A-A-A woman never
reveals her age.

5
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,531
I've been in this
relationship for...

6
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,074
He was going ten miles an hour
on the highway.

7
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,158
I'm trying to...

8
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,836
"And only then
will the people of Tajikistan

9
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,338
know true and lasting peace."

10
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,009
Andie, it's brilliant.

11
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,677
It's really moving.

12
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,306
But it's never going to appear
in Composure Magazine.

13
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,268
God, I busted my butt
in grad school

14
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,188
to be Andie Anderson,
"How to" girl,

15
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,106
and write articles like,

16
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,691
"How to Use the Best Pick-Up Lines"

17
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,903
and "Do Blondes, Do They, Like,

18
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,738
Really Have More Fun?"

19
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,573
I want to write about things that matter,

20
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,409
like politics and the environment,

21
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,953
and foreign affairs...
things I'm interested in.

22
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,371
Keep busting your butt.

23
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,915
You're going to get there.

24
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,834
Hey, I've got something
to cheer you up.

25
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,961
You know that editor
from Sports Illustrated

26
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,214
that you have been
shamelessly flirting with

27
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,715
on the phone for... whoo,

28
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,967
a month now?

29
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,220
He made a little delivery
this morning.

30
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,472
Ah, ha, ha, let me see.

31
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:19,556
Oh, no.

32
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:20,933
Hey!

33
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,187
Tomorrow night.

34
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,605
What happens tomorrow night?

35
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,608
Only the most exhilarating
and artistic display

36
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,443
of athletic competition
known to mankind.

37
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,111
The Ice Capades are in town?

38
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,948
No, the NBA Finals
are in town,

39
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,408
and I got tickets!

40
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,494
Come with me?

41
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,329
All right, I'll go.

42
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,122
But I am not putting out.

43
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,750
Two stale jumbo dogs
and a couple of beers,

44
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,336
you'll be whistling
a different tune.

45
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,129
You know what I like.

46
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,673
Good morning, ladies.

47
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,509
Don't forget,
staff meeting in 30 minutes.

48
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,806
Michelle... haven't seen
her all morning.

49
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,808
- Have you?
- Ten to one she's wallowing.

50
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,560
It's my turn. I'll get her,
you get the coffee,

51
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,644
meet me in the corner in 20.

52
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,687
Wait, wait, wait.

53
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,272
Here, take some samples.

54
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,482
Samples. Samples.

55
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,860
Great idea.

56
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,988
Oh, boy.
Drama, drama, drama.

57
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,124
Hello, Ben.

58
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,835
Hey, hey, good morning, Spears.

59
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:16,924
What are you reading, girl?

60
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,717
You catching up on
your current events?

61
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,845
"Turn-On Tricks:
How to Make Him Hot."

62
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,972
You know, if you want
to try those out sometime,

63
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,140
we should get together.

64
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,768
Green and I have
an appointment at Composure,

65
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,813
the fastest growing women's
magazine in the country.

66
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,773
And seeing as how

67
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,483
our clients run a lot
of our campaigns

68
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,236
in their nationally-syndicated
little girlie magazine,

69
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,238
it wouldn't hurt you
to do a little reading.

70
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,989
Hey, Benny.

71
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,074
Good morning, Green.

72
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,242
You finally decided to show up?

73
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,618
Yes, I did.

74
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,702
You ready?

75
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,745
Ready.

76
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,413
Later, Ben.

77
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,041
Have a nice day, ladies.

78
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,795
Hi.

79
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,714
Oh!

80
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,301
Good morning, sunshine.

81
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,761
Okay, get dressed.

82
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,804
Get dressed.

83
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,389
Staff meeting, 15 minutes.
Let's go.

84
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,561
I'm going back to bed.

85
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,437
I have no reason to live.

86
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,772
Sun's out. Oh...

87
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,732
Okay, just...

88
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,401
Okay, now...

89
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,612
Cashmere?

90
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,614
Put it on.

91
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,616
It'll make your eyes
look fiercely green.

92
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,951
Oh!

93
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,953
Get up. I'm not going
to let you lose your job

94
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,121
on top of everything else.

95
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,497
- Oh.
- Come here.

96
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,791
Oh, Andie.

97
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,168
Okay.

98
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,377
Okay.

99
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,795
You only dated the guy a week.

100
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,299
It was the best week of my life.

101
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,093
Sweetheart.

102
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,469
Good morning, ladies.

103
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,637
- What's up, Tito?
- Hey.

104
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,638
Warren Advertising.

105
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,473
Hi, yes, we're waiting for you.

106
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,474
Good morning.

107
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,226
What's up, kitty cat?

108
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,853
What's up, daddy?

109
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:53,937
Big night?

110
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,105
- Not bad.
- Orgy?

111
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,315
Where were you, man?

112
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,275
Not at an orgy.

113
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,359
Did you hear?

114
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,611
What, that my Knickerbockers

115
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,112
are now in
the championship series

116
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,156
and Tone "The Bone" here
owes me $20?

117
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,282
Pay him.

118
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,325
Oh, man.

119
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,659
Well, you were right.

120
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,828
DeLauer Diamonds is looking
for a new ad agency.

121
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,705
Warren wants to move
on it aggressively.

122
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,165
Yes!

123
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,418
Oh, oh, this is a good day,
this is a good day.

124
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,128
Guys, did you know
that diamonds are about

125
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,671
as common as taxis
on Fifth Avenue?

126
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,549
The value is entirely
sentimental,

127
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,717
maintained by a supply,

128
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,178
demand and advertising.

129
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,679
Stripes.

130
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,390
Now, DeLauer dominates
the world diamond market.

131
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,975
Meaning if I represent them,

132
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,353
I basically represent
the entire industry.

133
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,979
Tell him.

134
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:36,855
What?

135
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,148
Warren gave it to the Judys.

136
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,942
Spears and Green...
they're already on it.

137
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,151
No way!

138
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,819
Yeah, well, you know,
he's kind of partial

139
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,530
to hot, leggy chicks
for some reason.

140
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,365
Yeah, and we're the, you know,

141
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,449
the sneakers and beer division.

142
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:48,867
Precious gems aren't exactly
our forte.

143
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,162
Lips and Hips are over at
a chick's magazine right now.

144
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,997
I got to get to Warren
before they sink...

145
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,499
You can't, you can't.
He's on a plane.

146
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,875
Easy, pal.
The Chicago meeting.

147
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,293
And it's too late anyway,
because Warren's

148
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,003
meeting them for drinks
at Mullins' tonight

149
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,088
to discuss their ideas.

150
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,214
You know what?
This isn't happening.

151
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,507
You know why?
This was my tip.

152
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,133
It's going to be my pitch,
my account, my campaign.

153
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,718
- This is my baby.
- That's what I'm talking about.

154
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,803
They will not ace me
out of this.

155
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,930
- That's right.
- I heard that.

156
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,014
Okay.
Mullins', tonight.

157
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,891
"I heard that"?

158
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,895
Oh.

159
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:17,938
- Hi.
- Hi.

160
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,065
I-I don't really want
to talk about it, okay?

161
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,108
- Okay.
- Okay.

162
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,776
Okay.

163
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,863
Why does this always happen
to me?

164
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,948
Things were going great
for, like, a week and a half,

165
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,117
and then, all of a sudden,
it's over,

166
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,451
and I am mystified.

167
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,412
Seriously, I am mystified,

168
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,498
because it always starts out
so well.

169
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,666
Poor baby.

170
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,168
Let's just roll with this one.

171
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,962
Oh, Mike and I had
such a connection.

172
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,755
The first time that we had sex,

173
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,134
...it was so beautiful...

174
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,219
I cried.

175
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,473
You cried?

176
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,184
Yeah.

177
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,810
You mean, like,
one glistening tear

178
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,145
on your cheek, right?

179
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,355
No. I was really emotional.

180
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,066
I even told him
that I loved him.

181
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,735
After how many days?

182
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,819
Five.

183
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,279
Two.

184
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,907
It was how I felt.
I wanted to express myself.

185
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,576
Okay, well, what did he say?

186
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,870
Oh, Mike didn't have
to say anything.

187
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,830
I know that he felt the same.

188
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:20,042
But then he started
getting really busy,

189
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,502
and I didn't know where he was.

190
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,795
So I kept calling him
and calling him.

191
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,796
He was never home...

192
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,131
You kept calling him?

193
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,133
I didn't leave a message.

194
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,177
He didn't know it was me.
My number's blocked.

195
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,764
Oh, I-I'm sure he thought
it was one of his friends.

196
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,932
You know, men frequently call

197
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,475
their friends'
answering machines

198
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,726
and hang up 20 times.

199
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:38,936
Anyway...

200
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,272
I know why he dumped me:

201
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,941
I'm too fat.

202
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,776
- You're not fat!
- You're not fat!

203
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,696
Oh, Michelle, if the most
beautiful woman in the world

204
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,697
acted the way you did,

205
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,241
any normal guy
would still go running

206
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,283
in the other direction.

207
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,537
Oh, no. No guy would go
running from you, Andie.

208
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,832
You could barf all over him,
and he would say, "Do it again."

209
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,626
That is both
incredibly disgusting

210
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,503
and categorically untrue.

211
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,214
If I did the things you did,
I'd get dumped, too.

212
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,925
Okay, family,

213
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,511
shoes off.

214
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,640
And breathe.

215
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,644
Out.

216
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,815
Okay, Lori,
let's start with you.

217
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,817
Well, the "Botox for Beginners"
piece is done.

218
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,944
Now, it's a little scary,
but mostly upbeat.

219
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,070
Now I'm on

220
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,238
"What Your Gyno Won't Tell You,"

221
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,739
which is also pretty scary,

222
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,824
but, you know, upbeat.

223
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,701
I finished my research
on deadly pedicures,

224
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,327
about the woman who contracted

225
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,079
that fungus
from the unsterilized tools.

226
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,956
Yeah.

227
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,124
It's a terrible story.

228
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,543
Although, surprisingly...

229
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,878
upbeat!

230
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,379
Marvelous.

231
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,549
What's next for
"'How to' with Andie"?

232
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,801
Well, I've been
working on something

233
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:53,969
that's kind of different.

234
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,846
It's...

235
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:56,889
It's a political piece,
and it's...

236
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,973
No.

237
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,267
Andie, you work at
Composure Magazine.

238
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,351
We are fashion,

239
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,520
trends, diets,
cosmetic surgeries,

240
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,606
salacious gossip...
that's Composure.

241
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,065
- Okay, but...
- Look,

242
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,902
Andie, okay...
the column is new for you.

243
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,237
When you turn it
into a must-read,

244
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,656
then you can write
about whatever you want.

245
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,243
Until then, you can write
about whatever I want.

246
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,536
Understood?

247
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,205
Yeah.

248
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,372
Michelle, what have you got?

249
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,793
I'm sorry, Lana,

250
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:27,961
I wasn't feeling very well...

251
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,004
She got dumped.

252
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,465
Oh, no,

253
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,716
Michelle...

254
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,719
What a hellish ordeal for you.

255
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,721
But I must say,
you are looking fabulous.

256
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,014
Are we loving

257
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,307
the way she looks, all?

258
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,267
- We love the way she looks.
- Oh, you are so right.

259
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,602
She looks great.

260
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,103
Well, I haven't eaten
since the split.

261
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,230
Good for you!

262
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,397
Write about it.

263
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,442
I can't use my personal life
for a story.

264
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,278
I understand completely.

265
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,406
Who will use Michelle's
personal life for a story?

266
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,407
Oh, I will.

267
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,784
- Go.
- No, no, no,

268
00:10:58,784 --> 00:10:59,910
Lana,

269
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:00,911
with all due respect,

270
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,079
Lori has no business
mucking around

271
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,080
in my personal life,
and I can't...

272
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:03,956
I can't let her.

273
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,624
- I am...
- I'll do it.

274
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,125
What?

275
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,169
I'll... I will...
I'll sort of do it.

276
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,754
It's... You will be

277
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:11,797
my inspiration.

278
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,840
For?

279
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,133
Look at Michelle.

280
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:19,429
- She is a great girl, right?
- Yes.

281
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,390
An amazing woman.

282
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,977
But she has a problem
hanging onto relationships,

283
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,270
and doesn't really know

284
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,145
what she's doing wrong,

285
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,564
which is like a lot
of our readers.

286
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,773
Uh-huh.

287
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:35,612
So, I was thinking that
I could start by dating a guy,

288
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:36,655
and then drive him away,

289
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,866
but only using
the classic mistakes

290
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,368
most women, like Michelle,

291
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,370
make...

292
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,330
all the time.

293
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,999
I'll keep a diary of it,

294
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:54,298
and it will be sort of a...
dating "How to" in reverse.

295
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,342
What not to do.

296
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,303
Yeah.

297
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,347
"How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days."

298
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,349
Yes. Go.

299
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,059
Bart, what's new
in the shoe world?

300
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,978
Wait, wait, Lana, I'm sorry.

301
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,313
Why ten days?

302
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,900
Five days is too short,
and we go to press in 11. Yes?

303
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,151
Okay, what we found out

304
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,986
is men are attracted
to purple shoes.

305
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,571
Now, I love...

306
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,992
Maybe toss in something
spiritual as well.

307
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:25,496
Who's that chic Buddhist
Richard Gere cavorts with?

308
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:26,538
The Dalai Lama.

309
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,664
He's fabulous. Ah!

310
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:28,916
Here's my 10:00. Welcome.

311
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:29,958
Hi.

312
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,377
Ladies, Judy Spears
and Judy Green

313
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,129
from Warren Advertising.

314
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,590
We're going to cook up
some fabulous tie-ins

315
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:37,591
for the fall.

316
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,552
Jeannie Ashcroft,
Fashion and Trends.

317
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,179
Michelle Rubin,
Fitness and Health.

318
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,388
Excuse me. Hi.

319
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,766
And Andie Anderson,
our resident "How to" girl.

320
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,184
Oh, I've seen
your column, Andie.

321
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,435
What are you working on now?

322
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,603
Oh, actually...

323
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,564
"How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days."

324
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,566
She's actually going
to start dating a guy,

325
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,652
and then drive him away
in a week and a half.

326
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,655
Sounds needlessly vicious.

327
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:00,948
It's going to be fabulous.

328
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,741
Now all she has to do
is run along

329
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,576
and find the lucky guy.
Go, go, go.

330
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,786
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye.

331
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:06,954
Good-bye.

332
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,330
Ladies, come.

333
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,331
Find the guy.

334
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,666
- Okay.
- Find the guy.

335
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,126
Oh, you are never going
to pull this off.

336
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,212
Watch me.
Tonight, I'll hook a guy.

337
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,839
Tomorrow, pull the switch.

338
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,966
Before the ten days are up,

339
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,968
I'm going to have this guy
running for his life.

340
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,387
You're not going to burn
his apartment down

341
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,180
or bite him or anything,
are you?

342
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,765
No! I'm going to limit myself

343
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,601
to doing everything girls
do wrong in relationships.

344
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,854
Basically, everything
we know guys hate.

345
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,231
I'll be clingy, needy...

346
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:35,482
- Yeah.
- Be touchy-feely.

347
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,109
Ooh, call him in the middle
of the night,

348
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,986
and tell him everything
you had to eat that day.

349
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,445
What's wrong with that?

350
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,866
I'm kidding.

351
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,003
Hello, Ben.

352
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,005
What are you doing here?

353
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,090
Phil, I'm here for
the meeting. Ladies.

354
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,383
But you weren't invited.

355
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,427
Yeah, but I should have been.

356
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,928
I mean, it was my tip

357
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,471
that DeLauer's shopping
for a new firm.

358
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,098
Yes, it was, but I have
to think in terms

359
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,892
of who's best-suited
within the company team.

360
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,061
Yes, sir, and that's me.
I want to handle this pitch.

361
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:16,440
Ben, you sell Joe Blow better
than anyone else in my shop,

362
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,108
but these girls sell luxury

363
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,652
better than anyone else
in the business.

364
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,988
We have to put our best foot
forward on this pitch.

365
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,740
DeLauer would be
our biggest account.

366
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,949
Yes, sir, they would.

367
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,660
Annual advertising billings
of 50- to $60 million.

368
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,245
And I am the man that's going

369
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,997
to bring this home
for you, Phil.

370
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,415
Why this place?

371
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:34,625
It's perfect.

372
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,709
Hi, Ingrid.

373
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:36,960
Hi.

374
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,630
Mullins' is the apres-work
watering hole

375
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,298
for the upwardly mobile.

376
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,341
Now, to date,

377
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,551
the diamond industry
has always targeted men,

378
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,553
sending the message
that the woman needs the man

379
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,013
to buy her the rock.

380
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,641
All right, they say,
"A diamond is forever."

381
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,809
We say,
"A diamond is for everyone."

382
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,977
- I like that.
- Yes

383
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:54,978
We don't.

384
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,855
"A diamond is for everyone"

385
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,025
sends the message
that diamonds are everywhere,

386
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:03,695
which means they're not rare,
and if they're not rare,

387
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,322
they lose their status.

388
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,740
Status is the reason

389
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,534
to buy them in the first place,

390
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,036
which Benjamin would know
if he understood women,

391
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,037
which you don't.

392
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:18,085
You can't feel bad about that, Ben.
No man does.

393
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,086
Here you go.

394
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,087
Thank you.

395
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,088
Thanks.

396
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,422
Oh! Sorry.

397
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,093
Here. Here.

398
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,302
Thanks.

399
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,805
Dum, dum, dum, dum,
dum, dum, dum...

400
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,640
Hey, don't pressure her.
She's perusing.

401
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,642
Yes, exactly. Hmm.

402
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,185
Hmm.

403
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,187
Selling a diamond to a woman

404
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,481
is like making her fall in love.

405
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:43,318
She has to feel giddy,
desirous, adventurous,

406
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,862
and desperate.

407
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,613
Take a look around
this room, Phillip.

408
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,908
Most of the women in this bar
are looking for just that.

409
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,077
Exactly. The skills required
to market diamonds

410
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,414
are the same as those needed to
make a woman fall in love, yes.

411
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,957
I'm not talking about lust.

412
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,083
A woman in lust

413
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,501
wants chocolate.

414
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,920
A woman in love...
wants diamonds.

415
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,630
Yeah, I'm not talking

416
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,757
about lust, either, ladies.

417
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,468
I'm talking about deep,
meaningful,

418
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,387
head-over-heels,
his and her towels,

419
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,891
let's grow old together,
L-O-V-E.

420
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,895
Look, I love women. I do.

421
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:22,274
Whether they're four, 40,
or my 88-year-old grandmother,

422
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,359
I respect women, all right?

423
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,946
And I also listen... to women,

424
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:32,159
and that's why I can sell myself
to any woman, anywhere, anytime.

425
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:35,954
Make a woman fall in love
with diamonds, Benjamin...

426
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,498
or with you?

427
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,291
Eh, either one.

428
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,918
Well, that's cocky, Ben.

429
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,295
No, not cocky... confident.

430
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,423
I'd like to see you prove that.

431
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,716
You would?

432
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,259
The agency's cohosting

433
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,262
a party for the DeLauers
at the Astor Museum.

434
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,139
The party's a week from Sunday.

435
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,474
Do you think you could make

436
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,226
a woman fall in love with you
by then?

437
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,436
Ten days?

438
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,104
Any woman, anywhere, anytime?

439
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:05,442
Any single, available,
straight woman... yes.

440
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:06,443
Yes.

441
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:07,945
I'm not trying
to trick you, Ben.

442
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,948
In fact, we'll choose
a woman right here,

443
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,741
right now, in this bar,

444
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:14,201
and then you decide.

445
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,160
Ooh.

446
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:18,288
So, who's the lucky girl?

447
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,248
Okay...

448
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,917
Let's see here. Ooh,

449
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,336
there's that blonde babe
in the leopard print.

450
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,420
Whoa, ho, ho!

451
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,547
She looks like fun.

452
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:27,798
Be nice, ladies.

453
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,132
Or... wow,

454
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,634
Miss Babylon Five.

455
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,636
Now, she's on the prowl.

456
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:34,137
No.

457
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,430
Her.

458
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,849
Her who?

459
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:40,435
Her, in the gray dress.
Blonde hair. Pretty smile.

460
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,567
Her?

461
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,824
Done.

462
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,492
What?

463
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,161
Done.

464
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,787
Done.

465
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:02,416
See the guy next
to the horrible guy

466
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,460
in the green shirt that I would
never even consider? Okay?

467
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,545
- Hmm!
- Very cute.

468
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:07,629
Right?

469
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:08,922
- Good.
- All right?

470
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,549
Here I go!

471
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,344
Okay, you're on.

472
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,596
But here are the stakes.

473
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,264
After I win this bet,

474
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,724
this pitch is mine.

475
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:19,725
Agreed.

476
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:21,518
- Phil?
- Agreed.

477
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,478
You come to that party
with a girl

478
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,689
that's really in love
with you, Ben...

479
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:27,941
you can make the pitch
to the DeLauers.

480
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,651
But, Phillip, you can't...

481
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,696
I've made up my mind.

482
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:33,739
To the DeLauers.

483
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,115
To the DeLauers.

484
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,200
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

485
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,576
Cheers.

486
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:38,952
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

487
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:42,414
I was just wondering
if you find...

488
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,418
...exciting?

489
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,629
Yes. My wife and I love
New York,

490
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,255
especially this time of year.

491
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,090
She'd been here before,
and I'd...

492
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,133
- Hi.
- Hi.

493
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:54,301
This is Andie.

494
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:56,261
Hi. Um...

495
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,262
Oh!

496
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,347
You guys enjoy New York.

497
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,431
Okay.

498
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:00,390
Thanks. We will.

499
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:01,725
Yeah. Nice meet...
nice meeting you.

500
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:02,851
Eww!

501
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,439
Good luck!

502
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,774
Thank you, Phil.

503
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:11,610
Now, if you'll excuse me,
ladies...

504
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,028
I have a bet to win.

505
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,780
Ta-ta.

506
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,038
Now do you want to tell
me what's going on?

507
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,748
You don't recognize her?

508
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,923
Hi.

509
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:33,924
Hi.

510
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,384
Hi.

511
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,097
Andie Anderson.

512
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,557
I'm Benjamin Barry.

513
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,558
Cute.

514
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,559
Thank you.

515
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,269
I meant your name.

516
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,938
Thank you two times.

517
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,439
Unattached?

518
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,691
Currently.

519
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:51,692
Likewise.

520
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,861
Surprising.

521
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,279
Psycho?

522
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,864
Rarely.

523
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,156
Hmm.

524
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,408
Interested?

525
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,243
Perhaps.

526
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,661
Hungry?

527
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,330
Starving.

528
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,415
- Leaving.
- Now?

529
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,416
Mm-hmm.

530
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,959
Okay.

531
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,586
Okay.

532
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,087
One second.

533
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,298
I'll meet you at the door.

534
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,841
Hey, hey, guys.

535
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,342
What?

536
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,468
I think I got one.

537
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,012
He was married.

538
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,764
No, not him. It's the guy by
the door, but don't-don't look.

539
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,474
Oh, guys!

540
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,521
Oh! He is really cute!

541
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,648
I'm going to check this one out
and see if he's the keeper.

542
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,649
Okay.

543
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:33,650
And if he is?

544
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,527
Tomorrow night, we'll...

545
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,029
Flip the switch.

546
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,573
Doing this for you.

547
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,159
Well, good luck.
Be safe.

548
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,327
Call me.

549
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,495
Mm...

550
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,706
Drama, drama, drama.

551
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,512
No, no, no. This one.

552
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:16,401
And you get to wear
the goofy-looking helmet.

553
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,198
This won't look goofy on me.

554
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,200
It looks goofy
on just about everybody.

555
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,494
Look at you.

556
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,162
That's pretty damn cute.

557
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,417
There you go.

558
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,969
You ready to go
for a ride, Andie?

559
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,972
Are you ready to go
for a ride, Ben?

560
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:56,775
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Get it? Get it?

561
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,026
Yeah.

562
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,778
Mmm. So, what do you think?

563
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,447
About the food, or... you?

564
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,575
Both.

565
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,243
This is delicious...

566
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:07,244
Mm-hmm.

567
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,538
...and I'm still deciding.

568
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,456
Anything I can do to help?

569
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,542
Yeah, you could answer some
questions for me, actually.

570
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:15,711
"Some" sounds
a little too indefinite.

571
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:16,879
I'll give you three.

572
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,589
What do you do for a living?

573
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,798
I'm in advertising.

574
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,592
I work mostly
with alcoholic beverage

575
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,135
and athletic equipment
companies,

576
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:25,971
and I'm trying to break into
the jewelry market right now.

577
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:26,972
Hmm...

578
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:30,100
Saving the world,
one keg party at a time?

579
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:32,519
Yeah, something like that.

580
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,442
What about you?

581
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,444
What about me?

582
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:41,778
Have I seen your work?

583
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,614
I work at Composure.

584
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:47,159
Fastest-growing women's
fashion magazine in the country.

585
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,410
I'm impressed.

586
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,204
Saving the world,
one shop-a-holic at a time, eh?

587
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,957
Hey, all right.

588
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,459
Look here, Sparky,

589
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,127
I have a Master's
in journalism

590
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,337
from Columbia.

591
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,965
My boss loves me, and if I do it
her way for a while,

592
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,259
I can write about
anything I want.

593
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,053
Like shoes?

594
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,596
No.

595
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,640
No.

596
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,309
Like alcoholic beverages

597
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:14,520
and athletic gear.

598
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,357
Touché. Very nice.

599
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,984
So, you think you got me
all figured out, eh?

600
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:21,985
Almost.

601
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:25,447
Still got one last question.

602
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:27,950
Shoot.

603
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,160
True or false:

604
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:36,875
All's fair in love and war.

605
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,838
True.

606
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:44,925
Great answer.

607
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,678
Good question.

608
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,513
Welcome.

609
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,352
Oh, nice place.

610
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:56,395
Thank you.

611
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:57,563
Very... tidy.

612
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,690
Can I get you

613
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:01,066
a cold beer?

614
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,067
Sure.

615
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,694
Can I use your restroom?

616
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:04,736
Yeah, you can.

617
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:07,239
It's up the stairs,
through the bedroom.

618
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,369
You are, aren't you?

619
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,204
The first night.
I can't believe you!

620
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,248
Michelle, I'm not going
to sleep with him.

621
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,541
Oh, you are such a hussy.

622
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,126
You can't hide
those lying eyes.

623
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:22,379
No, no, because I can practice
some self-control,

624
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,131
unlike some people I know.

625
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:25,507
Oh, really?
That hurts, kind of.

626
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,934
I'm going to dangle the bait...

627
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,352
Wait, what's the bait?

628
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,854
I'm the bait, Michelle.

629
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,105
- Oh...
- Yeah.

630
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,149
Okay, I'm with you. Then what?

631
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:49,239
Mmmm... Diamond

632
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,700
is no one-night stand

633
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:03,086
A diamond
is a long-term commitment.

634
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,505
Take notes.
You better be prepared...

635
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:05,923
I can't talk right now.
I have to go.

636
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:06,924
Call me later, you slut.

637
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:07,925
Okay. Bye.

638
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:21,605
- There you go.
- Thank you.

639
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:23,065
You're welcome.

640
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:33,158
Ooh.

641
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,688
Okay.

642
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,718
Hey, hey, let's not go too fast, okay?

643
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,347
Yeah.

644
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,892
Yeah.

645
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,406
We're moving too fast.

646
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,992
I... you're right.

647
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,994
It's-it's too fast.

648
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,457
Okay.

649
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,556
- Too fast.
- Too fast.

650
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:21,058
Yeah.

651
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,852
I want you to respect me.

652
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:26,688
I do.

653
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,398
Okay.

654
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,901
And I want your respect.

655
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:33,737
I respect you for respecting me.

656
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,240
I respect that.

657
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:39,159
Good.

658
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:51,839
Good night, Andie Anderson.

659
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:59,972
Oh, you are already
falling in love with me.

660
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:02,724
I'm going to make you wish
you were dead.

661
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,936
Poor guy.

662
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,656
Of all the women
Spears and Green

663
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,950
could have thrown at me,
this one is amazing.

664
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,744
Hanging with her for ten days
is going to be no problem.

665
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,663
Right, so, it's only
nine days longer

666
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:27,207
than you've ever spent
with any other chick, huh?

667
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,168
That's why I didn't go
for the gold immediately.

668
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:30,169
Oh.

669
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,170
I'm taking my time.

670
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:32,921
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

671
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:34,298
Ten days is a marathon?

672
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:37,050
Okay, so it's more like
the 3,000-meter hurdle.

673
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,136
The point is, she's already
on the ropes, guys.

674
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:41,013
Wow, that-that's a lot
of sports analogies.

675
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,056
That it?

676
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,641
- That-that's it?
- That's it.

677
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:45,976
Have you looked inside?

678
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:46,977
No.

679
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,145
Do you have an ethical problem

680
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:49,605
with rifling through
a woman's purse?

681
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:50,898
Uh, yeah, I guess I do.

682
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,649
Well, it's hardly a purse, dude.

683
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,693
It's more like a clutch
or something.

684
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,695
Guys, a woman's purse,
all right...

685
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:59,323
it's her secret source of power.
All right?

686
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,408
There-there are many dark
and dangerous things in there

687
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,661
that we, the male species,
should know nothing about.

688
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:08,749
Oh. Unless, of course, she, uh,
left it behind intentionally

689
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,918
to secure a next-day call back.

690
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,252
Mm-hmm.

691
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:14,755
She's a very clever minx.

692
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,131
Oops, I'm sorry.
Oh, God. Um...

693
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:17,925
Oh, shit,
we got to clean that up.

694
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:19,051
Yeah, yeah.

695
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:23,055
Carefully. Carefully.

696
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:27,434
Oh, what have we here?

697
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:30,145
Let us see, let us see.

698
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:32,898
Oh... Knicks tickets...

699
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,233
Huh.

700
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,944
...for tonight's game.

701
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,862
Delivery, Andie.

702
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:40,113
Wow, look at those!

703
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,573
Oh, who are those for?

704
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:42,574
Andie,

705
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:43,742
oh, my God!

706
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:45,202
Where do you want these?

707
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:46,954
Who are these to?

708
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,081
Wait. "100 times..."

709
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,960
...more beautiful..."

710
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,253
Wait.

711
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,588
"...than 100 roses."

712
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,589
Catchy.

713
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:59,758
The guy's in advertising.

714
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,260
He can't help it.

715
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,761
So, does this mean he's hooked?

716
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:05,722
This means he found
the Knicks tickets.

717
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:08,267
You left the tickets
in the purse?

718
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:09,476
Yeah.

719
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:12,104
You are just on a whole
different playing field.

720
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,439
Here you go.

721
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:15,941
Mm-hmm.

722
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:17,150
Andie Anderson.

723
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:19,820
Hey, hey, pretty girl.

724
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,113
Guess what?

725
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:23,740
I got a really embarrassing
display of white roses.

726
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:24,908
Well, you are welcome.

727
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,994
Listen, I had a wonderful time
last night.

728
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,079
I have your bag.

729
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:31,123
Ah, I know.

730
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,458
I can't believe I left it there.

731
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:38,839
Yeah, well, you must need it back,
what with all the cash,

732
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:40,090
credit cards, and...

733
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:42,467
those Knicks tickets
for tonight's game.

734
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:45,304
Sounds like you've been
peeking through my bag, Ben.

735
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,346
Oh, absolutely not.

736
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,223
Tony, my Art Director,
he's an oaf,

737
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:50,142
and he accidentally
knocked it over.

738
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,185
Ow, right!

739
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,353
Yeah, I'm a clumsy man.

740
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:55,022
All right, I'm sorry, though.

741
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:56,356
I'm going to the game

742
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:57,816
with somebody else.

743
00:30:57,816 --> 00:30:59,026
Not anymore.

744
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,152
Besides, what?

745
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:02,279
You think you left your purse
at my place by accident?

746
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,114
No. Subconsciously,
you are dying

747
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:05,491
to take me to that game.

748
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:07,618
Denying your subconscious desires

749
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,703
is extremely dangerous
to your health, young lady.

750
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,788
Does that psycho-babble
really work on anybody?

751
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,624
You tell me.

752
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,876
Andie, you're so bad.

753
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:22,174
All right, meet me
at the 7th Avenue entrance.

754
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:23,509
7:30. Don't be late.

755
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:25,802
You got it. Bye-bye.

756
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:26,929
Bye.

757
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:30,682
And that's how it's done.

758
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,435
And that's how it's done.

759
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,443
Foul on Number 20,
Allan Houston.

760
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,363
Bullshit. Come on, ref!

761
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:45,405
What is that, ref?

762
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,783
Hey, if you're going to call it,
call it both ways!

763
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,994
Oh, you're soft, man!

764
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:53,163
You were soft last year,
and you're still soft.

765
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:54,915
And he's 85% on the line
all year, too.

766
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:56,250
What was that?

767
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:05,467
There we go.
One more left. All right.

768
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:14,351
Come on, bud.

769
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:15,519
Defense!

770
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:18,689
Oh, oh, oh!
That's off!

771
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,065
Defense!

772
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,734
Knicks call. 20 second time out.

773
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:25,946
All right, take your five.
Take a minute...

774
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,698
This is all right.

775
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:31,201
Got 20 seconds.
20 second team.

776
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:05,068
Knicks' ball.

777
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,281
- Whoo!
- Bring it back.

778
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:10,240
Charge!

779
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,119
Work your arm, baby.

780
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,456
Go, baby.

781
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:18,457
Hold 'em up!

782
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:19,458
Charge!

783
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,459
Benny?

784
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:21,793
Hold 'em up!
Work it, work it. Yeah?

785
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:22,669
Benny, I'm kind
of thirsty.

786
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:23,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

787
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,255
- Yeah, yeah!
- Benny, could you get me a soda?

788
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:26,715
Yeah, just let me
tell you right now...

789
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:27,841
I'm parched.

790
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:29,134
...there's a minute and nine
left in the game,

791
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:31,470
- and then I'll go up and get it.
- I'm really thirsty.

792
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:32,638
I'll go get it.

793
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:35,265
Hey, hey, hey. You want...
you want it right now?

794
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:36,433
Yeah.

795
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:38,977
And no ice, Ben.

796
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,104
Thanks, Benny.

797
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,981
Lawrence Funderburke.

798
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:43,982
Oh, man!

799
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:47,986
Here's Sprewell with a fake.

800
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:50,656
Gets the step on Christie.
What a crossover...

801
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,157
Whoo, my man.
Coke, no ice.

802
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,367
Next line over, pal.

803
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,285
No ice. Hey, buddy?

804
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:58,288
Small coke, no ice.
Small coke, no ice.

805
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,665
Okay, you got it.

806
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:01,208
...beyond the three-point line, fires!

807
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,209
Ah... no!

808
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,460
Man, don't let him have that shot!

809
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:05,045
No. Does that mean no, you don't want ice,

810
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:06,046
or no, you want ice?

811
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,965
No. No ice.
Coke, no ice.

812
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:10,133
And Don Chaney
wants to talk it over...

813
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:12,219
Oh, did you want a small?

814
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,512
No, I-I want that one
right there.

815
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:15,138
You know, for 25 cents more,

816
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,139
you could get a jumbo?

817
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,516
Okay, you take that right there.

818
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:18,183
Keep the change.

819
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,351
All right.

820
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,690
Charge!

821
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:29,945
Excuse me.

822
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:31,196
Ah...

823
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:32,197
Excuse me.

824
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,658
Come on! Score!

825
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,827
Come on, baby,
drive into the net!

826
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:37,828
Right there, right there.

827
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,079
Oh, thanks!

828
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:41,081
Hey, hold him, hold him.
Move it.

829
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:44,168
Set your pick! Watch
the three seconds! Traveling!

830
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,335
Ben, it's not diet.

831
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:46,920
- Huh? What?
- Ben, it's not diet.

832
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:49,381
Please, I'm so thirsty.

833
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:50,841
- All right, all right.
- With a lime.

834
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,843
- All right, okay, I got it.
- With a lime. Okay.

835
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:02,269
Shoot it!

836
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,189
Sprewell for the win!

837
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,231
Yes!

838
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:11,069
That was Sprewell!

839
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:12,362
It's all over!

840
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:14,364
The Knicks
have defeated the Kings

841
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:16,074
in the final seconds...

842
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,578
...Sprewell with
the game-winning shot,

843
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,082
and the Knicks over Sacramento:
97 to 96.

844
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:27,753
Oh, what an incredible game.

845
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:31,757
I've never seen a more exciting
game-ending play before.

846
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:34,885
Wow, well, neither have I.

847
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:35,969
Hey, hey, hey.

848
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:38,096
It's too bad you missed it.

849
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:40,599
Yep, it's too bad.

850
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,725
One second.

851
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:46,230
So...

852
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,273
you as nice as you seem, Ben?

853
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:51,944
No.

854
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:57,658
Good. Neither am I.

855
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:59,409
Oh, here.

856
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:02,913
Fifth and 12th, please.

857
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,040
See you later.

858
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,464
Horseshit.

859
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:13,757
More horseshit.

860
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:16,802
The horseshit continues.

861
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:19,680
Horseshit. Come on, people.

862
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:21,139
We've got to do a lot better
than this

863
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:22,140
if we're going to com...

864
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,308
What?!

865
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,435
There's a phone call
for Mr. Barry.

866
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:27,104
Yeah, can you take a message, Candi?

867
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,981
Uh, Mr. Barry, it's Andie.

868
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,110
- Make it quick.
- I will.

869
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:35,487
It's line two, Mr. Barry.

870
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,488
Thank you.

871
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:40,617
Hello.

872
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:43,453
It's me!

873
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:44,830
Listen, I'm in the middle
of a meeting.

874
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,123
Can I call you back
in just a minute?

875
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:47,124
I miss you,

876
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:50,335
Benny boo-boo,
boo-boo-boo.

877
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:52,171
Well, you know what?
I miss you, too.

878
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,630
Mm-hmm.

879
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:54,882
You busy tonight?

880
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:57,301
Uh, no. No, I'm not.

881
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,511
Why don't we catch a movie
or somethin'?

882
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:00,679
A movie... my choice?!

883
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:01,680
Your choice.

884
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:03,932
Oh, I'm so excited!

885
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:05,934
Okay. I'll call you later.

886
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:06,935
Bye-bye.

887
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:07,936
Bye.

888
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:15,819
Jonah!

889
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:16,820
Dad!

890
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,822
I always wanted a man
like Tom Hanks.

891
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:23,452
It's my favorite movie
of all time.

892
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:24,786
Yeah, me, too.

893
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:25,787
Shh!

894
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,457
What if something
happened to you?

895
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:32,503
What if I couldn't get to you?

896
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,046
What are you thinking about?

897
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:35,714
Nothing. I'm watching the movie.

898
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:38,467
Yeah, but what's on your mind?

899
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:39,635
Shh!

900
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,803
I like this movie.

901
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:45,474
Oh, so I suppose your mind
is a complete blank.

902
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:47,976
You are my family,
you're all I have.

903
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,061
Who is she?

904
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:51,104
Shh!

905
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,439
Who's who?

906
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:54,066
The girl you're thinking about.

907
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:55,192
Can't hear.

908
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:57,236
- I'm not thinking about a girl.
- Aah!

909
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:58,737
You can't watch Meg Ryan

910
00:37:58,737 --> 00:37:59,738
- for two hours
- Shh!

911
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:01,657
And not be thinking
about another girl.

912
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,158
Uh...

913
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,577
You want to know what
I'm thinking about?

914
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:06,703
Yes.

915
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:08,872
I'm sitting here thinking

916
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:11,750
about how damn beautiful
you are.

917
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,460
That's what I'm thinking about.

918
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:15,921
Come on, let's watch this movie,
it's good.

919
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:19,925
Aww...

920
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,677
Benji.

921
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:27,724
Oh, sweetie!

922
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,518
I love sharing this with you.

923
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,519
Yeah.

924
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:31,937
Can't hear and can't see.

925
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:34,565
If you don't shut up,
my boyfriend over here

926
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:35,732
is going to come back there

927
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:37,776
and pummel your ass.

928
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:38,861
Put a muzzle on your old lady

929
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,445
the next time
you bring her out in public.

930
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:41,446
What?!

931
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:42,447
What is that?!

932
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:43,448
Do something about...

933
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:44,783
- You, outside.
- Shh!

934
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:45,951
Keep it down!

935
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:48,495
Keep it down!

936
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,122
I mean, have a little class,
all right?

937
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:52,416
You want to talk like that to me,
we can work it out,

938
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:53,625
but not to a lady, all right?

939
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,252
Ben, Ben, B-B-Ben, he's huge.

940
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,921
I got it. I'm not looking to get
in a fight with the guy, okay?

941
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,298
He owes you an apology.

942
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,801
Oh! Oh, whoa!

943
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:04,761
Now, I'm going to go
back inside,

944
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:07,264
and finish watching
Sleepless in Seattle.

945
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:08,599
Nobody screw with me.

946
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,601
Son of a... bitch.

947
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,019
- Oh, Ben.
- Aah!

948
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,020
Are you okay?

949
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:14,354
- Oh...
- Ben,

950
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:15,355
- Ben, Ben,
- Ow, ah-ah-ah. Yes?

951
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:16,607
Maybe we should
get you to a hospital.

952
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:17,608
No. No, no, no, no.

953
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:18,901
No, you could have a...
Excuse me!

954
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,486
Uh-uh-uh, hey, hey,
can you hold still,

955
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:21,612
right there, hold still?

956
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:22,779
Okay, I'm sor...

957
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:25,324
Oh, ooh... oh.

958
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,325
Oh, yeah.

959
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:27,326
That's feeling real nice.

960
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,327
Ben... Ben...

961
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:29,536
I'm starting to feel
a little better.

962
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:30,662
Ben...

963
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,332
Ben!

964
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:34,917
Oh, my God!

965
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,168
You're fine.

966
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,795
Oh, you are totally fine.

967
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,673
Okay, come on, Rocky.

968
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:42,674
No, no...

969
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:43,675
Get up.

970
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:47,387
- Ouch.
- Huh?

971
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:48,555
Yeah.

972
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:49,556
Hey, don't feel bad.

973
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:51,225
If I had a nickel for every time

974
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,685
I got in a fist fight
during a chick flick, whoo!

975
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:55,145
Uh-huh, right.
It really wasn't that bad.

976
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:56,480
Really?

977
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:58,982
No. I mean, the getting punched
in the face part sucked, right?

978
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:00,234
Well...

979
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:03,070
But the getting taken care of
after the punch... it was nice.

980
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,322
All right! Florence
Nightingale syndrome, yeah.

981
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:07,616
You want me to tape the game
for you tonight?

982
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:09,284
No need, my friend.

983
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:10,828
I'll be watching the Knicks

984
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:13,330
from the comfort of my
own home this evening.

985
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:15,499
- How'd you swing that?
- Oh, yeah.

986
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:16,834
What's good to grill?

987
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:17,876
- No.
- Heavyweight.

988
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,378
You're making the lamb.

989
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:20,379
Voila.

990
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:22,673
A woman loves a man
who can cook, yeah?

991
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:23,966
Bringing out the big guns.

992
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,259
- Let's go deep.
- I like it.

993
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,386
Why do they always
forget my bacon?

994
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,389
I can't believe
you got that guy knocked out.

995
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:32,391
Only for a few seconds.

996
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:38,021
He was the most adorable,
unconscious man ever. Mm-hmm.

997
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:41,692
Are you dating him, or are you
contemplating adoption?

998
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:46,530
Andie, I am loving
your notes on this piece.

999
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,367
Thank you, Lana.

1000
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:51,743
When are you seeing him again?

1001
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:53,537
Tonight.

1002
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:56,123
He's invited me over for dinner.

1003
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:59,877
Marvelous.
I've got a feeling about this one.

1004
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:01,420
Thanks, Lana.

1005
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,797
I hate it when she pops
her head in like that.

1006
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,299
Ahem!
I never noticed it.

1007
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,884
I heard that.

1008
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:10,387
And Andie, tonight,
take smaller bites.

1009
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,975
Oh, my God!

1010
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,061
Disgusting.
I can barely eat over here.

1011
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:24,234
Come on in. Door's open.

1012
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,573
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

1013
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:31,575
I hope you brought
your appetite, girl.

1014
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:32,576
Whew.

1015
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:34,244
We got a feast tonight.

1016
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,503
Benny isn't that sweet?

1017
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:45,964
Go on and pour yourself
a glass of wine.

1018
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,633
We got diner in about five

1019
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:49,635
and tip-off in about eight.

1020
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,512
Great. I'm starving.

1021
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:08,987
So perfectly pink!

1022
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:25,420
Pour la piece de résistance.

1023
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:27,297
Ah...

1024
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:30,676
Sheryl, Tori,

1025
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:35,764
Sinead, Jewel, Fiona, Carly...
gang's all here!

1026
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:38,308
Great.

1027
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,144
Got two minutes to game time.

1028
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:44,815
You walked into the party

1029
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:48,986
Like you were walking
onto a yacht

1030
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:54,575
Your hat strategically dipped
below one eye

1031
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:58,036
Your scarf... it was apricot

1032
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:00,747
Wow. Look at all this stuff.

1033
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,167
- You had one eye in the mirror as
- Those are cute and...

1034
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,544
...you watched
- I saw the...

1035
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:08,172
- Yourself gavotte
- the new comforter.

1036
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:10,340
And all the girls dreamed that

1037
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:13,927
They'd be Ben's partner,
they'd be Ben's partner

1038
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:16,763
What you got in the box?

1039
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:18,515
Oh.

1040
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:22,144
It's a baby fern.

1041
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:23,979
Really? Oh, yeah?

1042
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:25,772
Just like our relationship.

1043
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:29,526
A helpless little baby
in need of tender loving care.

1044
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:33,655
Thank you.

1045
00:43:35,574 --> 00:43:36,658
Sit down.

1046
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:39,244
Have a seat.

1047
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:42,873
Ready?

1048
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:46,752
Game two. Welcome to
the front row, madam.

1049
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:49,254
Oh, oh. Here.

1050
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:52,090
Mm-mm-mm, mm-hmm.

1051
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:53,425
Dinner is served.

1052
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,928
Chef's special tonight.

1053
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:57,971
Lamb with a cherry glaze.

1054
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:01,934
Start you off
with the main dish

1055
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,019
right about there.

1056
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:07,648
A few carrots.

1057
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:09,650
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

1058
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:11,151
You okay?

1059
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:13,111
It's beautiful.

1060
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:16,824
Thanks.

1061
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:18,158
You're beautiful.

1062
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,952
The game, the whole thing.

1063
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:25,666
I wish I ate meat.

1064
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:31,088
Mary had a little lamb

1065
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:32,714
Little lamb...

1066
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,094
You have to take it away
before I gag.

1067
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:42,975
This stuff's for cows.

1068
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:48,814
- Hi.
- Hi.

1069
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:50,149
How you doing?

1070
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,402
Oh, aw, it's just
a little indigestion.

1071
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:54,987
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1072
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:56,113
All right.

1073
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:57,781
Uh, excuse me, m'am?

1074
00:44:57,823 --> 00:45:00,159
Do you happen to know the
score of the Knicks game?

1075
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:01,785
Do I look like
the kind of person

1076
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:03,662
who knows the score
of a Knicks game?

1077
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:05,622
No, you don't.

1078
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:11,378
Is something wrong
with the barley?

1079
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,839
No, no.

1080
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:21,471
My boyfriend thinks I'm fat!

1081
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:26,351
And I can't eat
in front of him!

1082
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,811
I can't eat in front of you!

1083
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:30,647
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- I don't think you're...

1084
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:32,357
I don't think you're fat.

1085
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:38,071
I don't think she's fat.

1086
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:48,832
What's happening?

1087
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:51,335
Spre just turned up;
23 seconds left.

1088
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:52,836
Knicks' ball.

1089
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:54,171
Get the ball, man.

1090
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:55,380
Oh, come on!

1091
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,006
Throw it!

1092
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:58,342
Oh! That was in!

1093
00:45:58,383 --> 00:45:59,426
- Oh, man!
- Oh...

1094
00:45:59,468 --> 00:46:00,511
Come on, get it back.

1095
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:04,556
Come on.

1096
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:05,682
Get the ball back,
get the ball back!

1097
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:07,226
Jackson takes the ball.

1098
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:08,519
A spin by Jackson.

1099
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,520
- Get it back!
- No!

1100
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:10,687
Damn!

1101
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:11,855
And the time has run out.

1102
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:12,940
- Damn!
- Pick up!

1103
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:14,483
The Kings have beaten
the Knicks.

1104
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:15,943
Their first win in the series.

1105
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,528
Next game.

1106
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,120
Well, that was fun.

1107
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:30,624
Okay. 11:25.

1108
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:32,084
Sports.

1109
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,377
Ah, there we are.

1110
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:35,045
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1111
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:38,423
Then it's Mark Jackson with
a no-look pass to Kirk Thomas...

1112
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:39,758
Sorry we missed the game.

1113
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,635
Post, post. Reverse it!

1114
00:46:41,677 --> 00:46:44,388
30 seconds left in the game,
Sprewell...

1115
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:45,097
There we go, baby!

1116
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:46,431
Oh, I can't believe

1117
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:47,891
he missed that shot.

1118
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:49,226
Take it, take it!

1119
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:51,645
- 12 seconds left, the game...
- Pitch! Aah!

1120
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:53,814
How the hell did you know
he was going to miss that shot?

1121
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:55,607
...with a narrow Monroe move.

1122
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:57,401
He always misses... the shot

1123
00:46:57,442 --> 00:46:59,236
...the way it ended...
- from the top of the key.

1124
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:01,738
...as the Knicks
could not get off another shot.

1125
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:06,243
Aah, man.

1126
00:47:07,786 --> 00:47:08,996
Houston never misses

1127
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:11,123
from the top of the key.

1128
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:19,131
Oh!

1129
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:21,091
- Whoa.
- Mmm...

1130
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:24,928
Does Princess Sophia
want to come out and play?

1131
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:28,307
Who's Princess Sophia?

1132
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:33,437
- No, no, no, no... no!
- Ow!

1133
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:34,980
Aw, yo-yo-yo-you...

1134
00:47:35,063 --> 00:47:36,982
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
y-you're kidding me, right?

1135
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:38,525
Princess Sophia?

1136
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:40,402
Little, big, little,
big, I don't know.

1137
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:41,653
We will find out!

1138
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:43,155
Ah, you know,
hang on a second.

1139
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:44,156
Ah, no, no.

1140
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:47,117
All right, listen.

1141
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:49,661
You can't name my... my member

1142
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:51,330
Princess Sophia.
It doesn't...

1143
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,789
Yes, I can.

1144
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,957
Listen. L-L-Listen to me.

1145
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,502
If-lf you're going to name...
my member, all right,

1146
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:59,004
you got to name it something
hyper-masculine, okay?

1147
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,798
Something like Spike or Butch,
or Krull, the Warrior King,

1148
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,925
but not Princess Sophia.

1149
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,218
What did you just say?

1150
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:06,803
Spike.

1151
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:08,180
You know what I mean?

1152
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:10,307
No, no, after Spike.

1153
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:11,141
Butch.

1154
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:12,684
After Butch.

1155
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:18,065
Krull... Krull,
the Warrior King.

1156
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:23,695
Does Kr-rull, the Warrior King
want to come out and play?

1157
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,323
- Oh, come on...
- No.

1158
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:30,828
...Krull.

1159
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:32,830
You know what?

1160
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:34,164
Due to...

1161
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:37,334
intense humiliation,
the King has...

1162
00:48:37,376 --> 00:48:39,878
momentarily abdicated
his throne.

1163
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,964
- Okay?
- Oh, uh-oh!

1164
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,507
Yeah.

1165
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:45,968
Well, in that case...

1166
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:47,928
I'd better get going.

1167
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:53,851
Take care of our love fern, honey.

1168
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:14,913
Hi. Mm.

1169
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:16,123
Can I see you tomorrow?

1170
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:17,708
Really?

1171
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:19,376
I hope so.

1172
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:21,879
Call me.

1173
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,921
I will.

1174
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:23,922
And I'll call you.

1175
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:24,923
Sweet dreams.

1176
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:26,925
Answer your phone!

1177
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,302
What?

1178
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,263
What was "icy" again?

1179
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:34,600
"Arctic, freezing, frigid."

1180
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:36,101
How about "glitter"?

1181
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:37,936
Thayer's favorite movie.

1182
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:39,146
It was underrated.

1183
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:40,355
Huh?

1184
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:42,774
"Glint, glisten,
scintillation."

1185
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:44,943
"Scintillation..."
that's not bad.

1186
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:46,153
Aw, that sucks.

1187
00:49:46,195 --> 00:49:47,529
Guys, let's take a break.

1188
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:49,406
Huh? A little coffee
and nine-ball.

1189
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:50,574
Shake it out.

1190
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:52,826
Maybe I'll be able
to concentrate

1191
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:55,621
since the woman
is driving me crazy.

1192
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:57,623
Which woman...
Andie, or Princess Sophia?

1193
00:49:57,664 --> 00:49:58,624
- Ah!
- Uh-huh.

1194
00:49:58,665 --> 00:49:59,958
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1195
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,959
Wait a second.

1196
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:02,961
I thought you said
after the Knicks game

1197
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:04,296
that she was a goddess.

1198
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,798
Oh, she was. That was
the good Andie, guys.

1199
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,884
This amazing, fun,
cool, sexy woman.

1200
00:50:08,926 --> 00:50:11,136
I'm talking
about the evil Andie, now.

1201
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:12,304
It's like a...

1202
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,973
it's like a crack-enhanced
Kathie Lee Gifford.

1203
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:16,767
She... she's
probably bipolar.

1204
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:19,311
Well, her South Pole's
definitely prevailing.

1205
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:23,315
Well, all you gotta do
is rock it for five more days.

1206
00:50:23,315 --> 00:50:24,316
Muffin!

1207
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:25,984
Which shouldn't be
too difficult.

1208
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:27,277
- Hi!
- Andie!

1209
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:28,654
- My little muffin.
- Hey, sweetie.

1210
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:29,988
We were just talking about you.

1211
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,281
- Hi.
- Hello, there.

1212
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:32,991
How are you?
You look gorgeous.

1213
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:33,992
Oh, thank you.

1214
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,661
Andie, this is Tony,
and this is Thayer.

1215
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:36,662
- Oh, yes.
- Hey.

1216
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:38,539
Benny Wenny's told me
so much about you two.

1217
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,166
Oh, well, Benny Wenny's said
wonderful things about you, too.

1218
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:42,334
Oh...

1219
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,211
Oh, they don't look
so simple-minded.

1220
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:45,379
Honey,

1221
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,380
Hmm?

1222
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:47,381
Look what

1223
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:48,507
I got for us. Oh.

1224
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:50,843
Look at that.

1225
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:53,512
Oh, wow!

1226
00:50:53,554 --> 00:50:55,180
- Ooh!
- Look at him go. What is it?

1227
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:56,723
Jumper.

1228
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:59,184
It's a Chinese Crested,
of course.

1229
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:00,310
No kidding.

1230
00:51:00,352 --> 00:51:02,146
- A Chinese Crested.
- Mm.

1231
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:03,981
So, it-it's like a dog, right?

1232
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:04,815
Oh, hey.

1233
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:05,858
There he is.

1234
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:07,151
Ooh, Ben. Ben.

1235
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:08,235
You got a dog.

1236
00:51:08,277 --> 00:51:09,486
You're hurting Krull's feelings.

1237
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:10,237
Krull, is it?

1238
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:12,823
Krull. Krull, the Warrior King.

1239
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:14,992
Well, sure, 'cause
that's clearly what... Yeah.

1240
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:15,993
Oh, oh, oh.

1241
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:16,994
Oh, wait, there's more.

1242
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:17,995
What do you got there?

1243
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:18,996
Oh, nice.

1244
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:19,997
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

1245
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:21,665
- Get out of town.
- Try it on.

1246
00:51:21,707 --> 00:51:23,709
That's like the...
inside of a raincoat.

1247
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,335
- Medium. Oh, yeah.
- It matches! Try it on.

1248
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:27,629
Now, that is going to fit
nicely, sweetie, thank you.

1249
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:28,630
No, Ben, put it on.

1250
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:29,882
No, you should try
it on. Otherwise,

1251
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:31,383
you don't know if it's
going to fit or...

1252
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:32,384
Oh, go for it.

1253
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:33,677
That has never hurt anybody.

1254
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:35,345
Huh? Huh?
I was just gonna save it

1255
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:36,930
for a better occasion,
all right?

1256
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:38,849
Check that out.

1257
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:40,392
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

1258
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:41,894
- Hey.
- Hmm?

1259
00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:43,061
You're a vision in khaki.

1260
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,566
It's going to be
a happy little family,

1261
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,110
Just the three of us.

1262
00:51:50,152 --> 00:51:52,237
We are, aren't we?

1263
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:53,947
Wow.

1264
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:55,741
He's our boy, Ben.

1265
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:57,242
Oh, see, that's sweet.

1266
00:51:58,243 --> 00:52:00,537
Mm-hmm, hey, mm-hmm.

1267
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:02,372
Whoa, ho, ho, ho,
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1268
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,708
Andie, hey, it's good
to see you, too, sweetie.

1269
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,751
Ah, I got you.

1270
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:06,877
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

1271
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:07,920
Gotcha, gotcha,
gotcha, gotcha.

1272
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,921
Oh...

1273
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:10,923
He's just
not potty-trained yet.

1274
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:12,216
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1275
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:13,258
Okay, well, he's a pisser.

1276
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:16,637
Come here, little tinkle king.

1277
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:17,721
No, no, no.

1278
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:18,889
Come here, tinkle king.

1279
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:20,557
- He is a tinkle king.
- Oh, yeah.

1280
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:22,392
Who's my little tinkler?
You tinkle tinkles.

1281
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:23,560
Well, congratulations,

1282
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:24,603
little plaid family.

1283
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:26,104
We, you know,
we got a whole bunch

1284
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:27,648
of work we got to do,
but we're...

1285
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:28,649
we're still on for poker

1286
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:29,775
at your house this weekend?

1287
00:52:29,817 --> 00:52:31,318
- Oh, you count on it.
- Whoo! Boys' night.

1288
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,319
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

1289
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:33,320
Yeah, it was nice meeting you,

1290
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:34,321
Nice to meet you.

1291
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:35,322
And, of course, Krull.

1292
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:36,490
- Bye. Say bye, Krullie.
- All right.

1293
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:37,950
A little soap and water
will take that out.

1294
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:38,951
He goes, "Woof, woof."

1295
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:39,952
Yeah, thank you, buds.

1296
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:42,996
Oh, come here. Ooh.

1297
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:44,456
Do you love him?

1298
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:45,457
Oh, I do.

1299
00:52:45,457 --> 00:52:47,709
Oh, look at Krull's necklace.

1300
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:51,004
He's got more ice than
Liberace, don't you?

1301
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:52,756
Oh, it's just a little frosting.

1302
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:57,594
Frosting?

1303
00:52:57,636 --> 00:53:00,264
Frosting.

1304
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:01,306
We were thinking bold,

1305
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:02,432
new, fresh.

1306
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:04,601
"Frost yourself."

1307
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:05,644
Excuse me?

1308
00:53:05,644 --> 00:53:06,812
"Frost yourself..."

1309
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:08,564
The slogan for the campaign.

1310
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:09,773
You frost a cake.

1311
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:12,276
We're in the middle
of a meeting, Benjamin.

1312
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:14,611
I'm talking about diamonds.
They're frosting.

1313
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:17,114
As in, "Whoa, would you
check out her frosting?"

1314
00:53:17,156 --> 00:53:18,615
- Frost yourself.
- Frost yourself.

1315
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:19,950
How did you come up with it?

1316
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:20,993
I got it off the woman

1317
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:22,619
who is falling
madly in love with me.

1318
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:23,620
Oh...

1319
00:53:23,662 --> 00:53:24,830
It may have possibilities,

1320
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:27,749
but as far as the woman who's
falling madly in love with you,

1321
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,293
I will decide that at the party.

1322
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:30,669
If he can get her there.

1323
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:34,131
Now, just think about it...
ladies, frost yourself.

1324
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:35,883
Frost yourself.

1325
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:37,467
Mm-hmm. We could introduce it
at the party.

1326
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:38,135
It-lt should be the theme.

1327
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:38,677
Yes.

1328
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:39,845
Everything frosted.

1329
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:40,971
- All of it.
- Martini glasses.

1330
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:42,014
Chandeliers.

1331
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:43,724
Ah, jewels everywhere.

1332
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:44,349
The women.

1333
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:45,642
The whole party...

1334
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:47,186
a sparkling diamond.

1335
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:48,770
All of it frosted.

1336
00:53:50,772 --> 00:53:52,483
Women of New York!

1337
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:54,318
Frost yourselves!

1338
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,737
Hey, frost this!

1339
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:58,530
Well, I like it.

1340
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:03,952
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1341
00:54:04,036 --> 00:54:05,913
yeah, yeah, I hear you.

1342
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:08,290
You have 17 new messages.

1343
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:10,626
Message one. Received at 5:44.

1344
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:11,835
Oh. Sit down. Sit.

1345
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:13,962
Hi, sweetie pea. It's me.

1346
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:14,963
Where are you?

1347
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:16,173
I'm not home.

1348
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:18,342
Received at 5:47.

1349
00:54:18,383 --> 00:54:21,678
Benny, it's Andie.
Guess you're not home.

1350
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,515
Three. Received at 5:48.

1351
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:25,974
Benny Bear, are you not
answering your phone?

1352
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:27,184
Yeah, I am.

1353
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:28,977
Four. Received at 5:49.

1354
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:30,187
Hey, buddy.

1355
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:31,772
Game three tonight. Blondie's.

1356
00:54:31,814 --> 00:54:33,106
Don't be late
or I will kill you.

1357
00:54:34,191 --> 00:54:35,150
Who is it?!

1358
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:36,360
It's me.

1359
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:38,987
Five. Received at 5:52.

1360
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:40,656
It's me.

1361
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:41,740
Ah!

1362
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:42,866
Ow!

1363
00:54:42,908 --> 00:54:43,992
Ow!

1364
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:45,202
What a surprise.

1365
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:46,662
Tried to get ahold of you.

1366
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:47,663
Yeah?

1367
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:49,665
I did something kind of wacky.

1368
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:51,458
Eh?

1369
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,710
Yes. I used Photoshop
at work today

1370
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,796
to composite our faces together

1371
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:58,257
to see what our kids
would look like.

1372
00:54:58,257 --> 00:54:59,842
Our... Family... Album!

1373
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:15,065
You don't want
to see our children?

1374
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:18,277
We don't have...

1375
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:19,403
children.

1376
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:33,000
I hate you.

1377
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,378
You know what?

1378
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,462
I'm sorry. No, no, no.

1379
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:39,423
I didn't mean it
like that, all right?

1380
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:41,758
I... Show me, show me,
show me, show me.

1381
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,801
Please show me.

1382
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:44,178
We don't have children!

1383
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:46,305
Oh, I thought you meant...
Krull.

1384
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:47,598
I just want to...

1385
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:49,391
Will you show them to me?

1386
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:51,143
You don't want to see them.

1387
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:53,604
I do. Please, please
show them to me.

1388
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:55,522
I really do
want to see them.

1389
00:55:55,564 --> 00:55:57,858
Really?

1390
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,859
Yeah.

1391
00:55:58,901 --> 00:55:59,902
Okay.

1392
00:56:01,153 --> 00:56:02,779
Oh, that's our wedding.

1393
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,619
And this is our first child...

1394
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,953
Benny, Jr.

1395
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:11,288
Yeah.

1396
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:14,875
Oh, there's us

1397
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:16,460
vacationing in Hawaii.

1398
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:18,962
Little Andie's
on my shoulders

1399
00:56:19,004 --> 00:56:21,340
and dum-da-da-dah,

1400
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:22,466
Benjamin, Jr. On yours.

1401
00:56:22,508 --> 00:56:23,842
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1402
00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:24,885
There's little Andie.

1403
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:26,428
Oh, there are the kids

1404
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,555
in Switzerland,
yodel-odel-ing.

1405
00:56:28,597 --> 00:56:31,558
Our kids are really...

1406
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,809
attractive.

1407
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:40,984
Yeah!

1408
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:43,987
Ah, hey, Mom.

1409
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:45,572
Ah, yeah, I'm-I'm doing fine.

1410
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:46,907
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, she is.

1411
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:47,908
Just a second.

1412
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,076
It's for you.

1413
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:51,328
Oh, great.

1414
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:53,330
Hey, Glenda.

1415
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:54,998
Why is my mom
calling you?

1416
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:55,999
Shh.

1417
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:59,169
I just showed him.

1418
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:01,380
Yeah, well, he
thinks our children

1419
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:04,299
will be very attractive.

1420
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:07,678
Oh, no.

1421
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:10,681
All right,
you go back to cooking.

1422
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:11,849
Call me later.

1423
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,684
Tomorrow. Yeah, great.

1424
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:14,810
Okay, Glenda.

1425
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:15,978
Love you, too. Bye.

1426
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:18,272
Thanks, honey.

1427
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:19,523
Yeah.

1428
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:23,986
So you and my mom,
you talk, huh?

1429
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,030
Yeah, I called
her to get some

1430
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:29,074
baby pictures of
you for our book.

1431
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:31,118
Hey, you never told me...

1432
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,203
that you wore diapers
till you were five.

1433
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:37,541
You know what, honey,
I got to go to the...

1434
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:38,542
Uh-oh.

1435
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:40,961
Ah, no,

1436
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:42,379
come on, man.

1437
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:44,923
You think maybe he thinks
the felt is grass?

1438
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:13,577
Oh...

1439
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:15,287
Oh, man.

1440
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:23,295
Oh!

1441
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:28,842
Ah... Ah... No, no,

1442
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:30,385
No, man! Come on!

1443
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:37,976
Hey, Benny Bear?

1444
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,311
Hey!

1445
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:40,479
Do you have plans tonight?

1446
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:41,939
Tonight?

1447
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,440
I have another surprise for you.

1448
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:45,984
Ah... you know what?

1449
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:47,986
Not a good night for me.

1450
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,613
I-I, I gotta work.

1451
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:50,948
- Of all things.
- Oh, no.

1452
00:58:51,073 --> 00:58:51,949
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1453
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:52,950
We got a Knicks game on.

1454
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:54,743
I had a broccoli-
and-asparagus casserole

1455
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,079
planned for you and me,
right there in front of the TV,

1456
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,081
and we're not going to be able
to do that either,

1457
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:00,415
'cause I got to go in to work.

1458
00:59:00,457 --> 00:59:03,252
That's too bad, 'cause
I had tickets for tonight.

1459
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:05,254
Tickets?
