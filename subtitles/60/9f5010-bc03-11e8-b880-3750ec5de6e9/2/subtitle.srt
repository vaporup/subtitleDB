1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:01,793
Tickets! Great tickets.

2
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,213
Front row seats,
right in the action.

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,131
I mean, you can smell...

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,300
the sweat.

5
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,969
I guess...

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,638
I...

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,515
I don't really have to.

8
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,974
Oh, why don't I

9
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,143
call Tony, and he can come
fill in for me, right?

10
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,645
Great.

11
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,231
Oh, yeah! Thank you.

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,149
Honey, you're more than welcome.

13
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,152
Yes!

14
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,821
Oh, look what time it is. Huh?

15
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,076
This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience,

16
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,620
and I'm going to share it with you.

17
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,670
Reaches up,
she brings it down.

18
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,880
It was the most powerful thing

19
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,340
I've ever... seen.

20
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,178
And after all this,
he still didn't leave you?

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,764
Oh, I'm telling you,
this calls for drastic measures.

22
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:56,890
Come on, guys,

23
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,267
concentrate.

24
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,061
Are you being clingy?

25
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,480
Clingy, needy, whiny...

26
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,940
Baby talk?

27
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:08,277
Occasionally. I mean,
I could kick that up a notch.

28
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,696
I used to obsess
over Mike's old girlfriends.

29
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,574
Or better yet, talk about
all your old boyfriends.

30
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,367
It's good, it's good, it's good,

31
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,244
but it's not going to crack this guy.

32
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,829
I mean, this is Defcon Five,

33
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,497
and I have to do something

34
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,499
truly appalling...
it's not funny.

35
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,045
Look, I have to think
of something before tomorrow.

36
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,715
Wait, why not tonight?

37
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,675
Poker night. Boys' night out.

38
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,260
Oh, Mike used to have a boys' night.

39
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,304
Boys' night?
You're giving him a boys' night?

40
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,806
They do it every week.

41
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,559
Before... he met... you.

42
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,853
What are you suggesting?

43
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,897
I think you know
what I'm suggesting.

44
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,193
- Feel lucky, boys?
- Yeah.

45
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,486
Gentle Ben, that's two bucks.

46
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,822
I'm feeling luckier than you.

47
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,909
Glad to not have to sit
through a Celine Dion concert.

48
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,078
That's what true love
is all about, my friend.

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,246
I fold.

50
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,915
All right, I'll see your two,
raise you fifty.

51
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,166
She's in love with you?

52
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,417
You kidding me?
She's planned the wedding.

53
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,460
Call.

54
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,794
All right, guys,

55
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,463
- read 'em and weep.
- Oh, shit.

56
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,089
Got ladies over fours, huh?

57
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,758
- Damn.
- Nothing.

58
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,676
I have a three and an ace.

59
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,095
It does not get
any better than this.

60
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,222
Look at that.

61
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,765
Bennykins, I'm home.

62
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,811
Hi, honey.

63
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,396
Hey, Andie.

64
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,234
She has a key?

65
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,860
Is that legal?

66
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,696
I wasn't expecting you.

67
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,534
How'd you get a... key?

68
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,245
Oh, honey, Francesco,
your super,

69
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,871
he made me a copy.

70
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,206
Francesco, huh?

71
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,707
Hmm. All right.

72
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,709
You're not mad, are you,
Benky Wenky?

73
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,586
- No, I'm not mad.
- You're not mad?

74
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,046
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not mad, I'm not mad.

75
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,464
- Oh, good.
- You know the guys.

76
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,591
- Everybody, Tony, Clar, Francis.
- Oh, yes!

77
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,509
- Hey.
- Watch out!

78
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:56,468
Hi.

79
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:00,931
Tony, hi,

80
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:01,974
- Tony!
- Yeah!

81
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,016
- Ronald.
- Ronald.

82
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,059
Joe.

83
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,394
- Joe.
- Hey, Andie, guys.

84
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,354
I didn't mean to interrupt
your little game.

85
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,481
We got it, we got it.
We're all straightened out.

86
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,816
I brought some yummy snacks.

87
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:11,984
Snacks? Hmm.

88
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,820
The game is hold 'em.

89
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,114
Three up for company,
ante a dollar, please.

90
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,240
Oh, Tony.

91
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,366
Hmm?

92
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,159
- Yucky, yucky pizza.
- Oh.

93
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,328
- Yucky pizza.
- Oh, no.

94
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,955
Yummy, yummy,
cucumber sandwich.

95
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,164
Oh... oh.

96
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,626
- First card up is a nine.
- Thanks.

97
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,088
I'll take one.

98
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,548
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

99
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,966
Good boys. Good.

100
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,968
Here we go... get rid
of those over there.

101
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,136
Thank you very much.

102
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,138
- Three up, three up.
- I went a buck. You follow?

103
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,307
Look around the horn,
look around the horn,

104
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,433
look around the horn.

105
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,781
Ssss...

106
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,204
Thanks, Benny.

107
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,455
Thayer.

108
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,207
That means you, too, Thayer.

109
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,791
Oh, yeah.

110
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,126
All right,
everyone in for a buck.

111
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:11,877
Next card, five,

112
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,128
nines and fives,
nines and fives.

113
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,379
That's back to you, Tito.

114
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,132
Oh! Nine and a seven.

115
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,384
Go for the straight.

116
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,802
Hmm.

117
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:21,803
Round two.

118
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,263
Tone, the bone, you're up, man.

119
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,890
She told you my hand.

120
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,225
Peekaboo!

121
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,685
- Oh, hey.
- Hi!

122
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,355
Guys, are we going to play cards here,
or what's going on?

123
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,357
What game are we playing?

124
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,734
We're playing hold 'em?

125
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,696
All right,
I'm already maxed out.

126
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,073
We got a nine up, nine up, guys,

127
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,783
- nine up, nine up.
- Blow.

128
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,536
Blow.

129
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,788
Nobody likes a Mr. Sniffles.

130
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,082
I hate Mr. Sniffles.

131
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,333
Come on, stuffy head.

132
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,924
Good, good, good.

133
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,008
Ooh... white.

134
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,261
- Healthy boy.
- Good. Mm-hmm.

135
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,930
- Healthy.
- Hmm.

136
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,141
Tone, get your head
in the game. Please?

137
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,142
Oh, no.

138
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,310
Are we playing?

139
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,854
Oh, no!

140
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,190
Our love fern!

141
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,609
It's dead!

142
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,530
No, honey, it's just sleeping.

143
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,449
You let it die!

144
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,661
Are you going to let us die?

145
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,912
Hmm?

146
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,041
You should think about that.

147
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,961
What the hell's a love fern?

148
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,674
All right, guys,

149
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,302
let's try to get through
one hand.

150
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,265
Is she on something?

151
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,975
God, I hope so.

152
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,982
Hi.

153
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,363
Are you saying I'm some kind of

154
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,908
- mental person?!
- No, no, no, he wasn't...

155
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,117
Oh, Tony!

156
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,119
What? He was talking about...

157
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,621
- Come on.
- That's it!

158
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,122
- Andie.
- That is it!

159
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,918
I'm taking this love fern
with me.

160
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,346
Hang on.

161
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,348
Hey.

162
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,475
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

163
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:32,643
ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

164
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,144
What just happened in there?

165
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,395
I'm going to go listen.

166
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,356
- Yeah.
- Quietly.

167
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,942
Look, this is getting
really creepy.

168
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,361
All right? You're acting
completely insane.

169
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,362
You know that?

170
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,947
Oh, so I am insane.

171
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,533
No, you're acting insane.

172
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,285
Shut up, Krull.

173
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,995
Oh, he is an innocent animal.

174
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,163
And he'll live, okay?
I'm talking to you.

175
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,164
I don't know

176
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,165
if I can be with somebody

177
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,166
who doesn't like animals

178
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,584
and thinks I'm a mental person.

179
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,378
That's what I'm talking about.

180
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,422
Where's the sexy, cool, fun,

181
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,341
smart, beautiful
Andie that I knew?

182
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,218
All right? The one who wanted

183
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,970
to be a serious journalist, huh?

184
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,847
You're up, you're down,
you're here, you're there.

185
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,349
You're like a freakin'
one-woman circus, Andie.

186
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,309
So I guess this means
we're over.

187
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,644
Yeah, I guess so.

188
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:16,645
Fine.

189
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,480
Fine.

190
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,108
Oh, finally.

191
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,281
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

192
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,290
It's over, man.

193
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,082
Oh, man, that's...

194
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,333
No, no, no, no, no.

195
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,169
- No, no, no.
- It is, man, it's over.

196
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,670
- Four days. Four days.
- Four more days!

197
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,380
Guys, you were here...
did you just witness

198
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,882
the one-woman homage
to The Exorcist?

199
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,175
You saw it, huh!

200
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,676
Yeah, I did.
I thought it was sexy.

201
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,677
Yeah.

202
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,429
It's not sexy.

203
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,681
- He's right, he's right.
- No, forget it.

204
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,559
So, do-do you think Spears
and Green are going to be

205
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,227
comfortable in
their new office?

206
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,312
Oh, absolutely. Sure.

207
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,563
- Maybe he's excited that
- Guys, stop.

208
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,939
He's going to be
selling Nerf footballs

209
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,357
- Hey, hey, hey!
- For the rest of his life!

210
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,109
He may get, like,
a really good douche campaign.

211
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,110
Hey, that's done!
What? What?

212
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,236
- Couples therapy.
- Of course!

213
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,404
What?

214
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,614
Every time my wife
wants to divorce me,

215
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,615
I suggest couples therapy.

216
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,866
It'll buy you
at least four days.

217
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,117
She-she hates him!

218
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,869
Therapy. Couples therapy.

219
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,078
Yeah, couples therapy.

220
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,079
Couples therapy!

221
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,456
- Couples therapy.
- Come on!

222
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,457
Couples therapy.

223
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,459
- Couples therapy.
- Couples therapy.

224
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,835
Couples therapy!

225
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,003
Whoa!

226
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,306
Ah!

227
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,349
Andie!

228
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,392
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, listen.

229
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,644
Can you forgive me, sugar puss?

230
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,646
Look, I don't know what
I was thinking, all right?

231
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:41,980
I-I'm sorry.

232
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,482
I am way out of line, Andie.

233
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,193
Can you... can you give me
another chance?

234
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,988
Haven't you had enough?

235
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,657
Hey, look, I'm willing
to do anything.

236
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,033
Get up.

237
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,952
I'll do...
I'll do anything, Andie.

238
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,119
Get up.

239
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,955
Look, what do you think about...?

240
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,456
What do you think about...

241
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,626
couples... therapy?

242
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,461
Couples therapy?

243
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,629
Couples therapy.

244
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,172
Look, Thayer up there,

245
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,298
he's got this doctor.

246
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,716
He says he's a hell of a guy.

247
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,261
No, I know a therapist
who will work wonders

248
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,179
with somebody like you,
Benjamin.

249
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,639
Yes, that's what I need.

250
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,558
I will call and schedule
an emergency session.

251
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,976
Baby, wh-whatever it takes.

252
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,644
Kiss.

253
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,145
Thank you, sweetheart.

254
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,607
Thank you for understanding.

255
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,485
I love you, Binky...

256
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,696
but I don't have to
like you right now.

257
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,327
Thank you, Andie.

258
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,501
Ah, damn it!

259
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,753
S-S-Shit!

260
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,798
If you're really going
to commit to this,

261
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,675
you're going to have
to open up...

262
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,510
- Yeah.
...and dig deep.

263
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,511
Okay.

264
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,596
Bare that beautiful soul.

265
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,638
Let me see your teeth.

266
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,267
Andie Anderson.

267
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,436
Benjamin Barry.

268
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,104
Please come in.

269
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,731
Hi, welcome.

270
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,446
Before we get started,

271
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,531
how are you planning on paying
for the session?

272
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,783
Sweetie?

273
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,910
How much is it?

274
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,411
$300.

275
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,537
$300?

276
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,288
Mm-hmm.

277
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,708
Whatever it takes, yeah.

278
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,585
So, tell me,

279
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,462
how long have you guys
been seeing each other?

280
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,505
Seven days.

281
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,631
Seven days.

282
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,965
Interesting.

283
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,134
Is it too soon
to be seeing a therapist?

284
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,594
Well, Ben,

285
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,305
seven days isn't like
a lifetime, or anything,

286
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,140
- It's like a week.
- It...

287
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,310
Did you hear that tone?

288
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,103
How can we not have
a gulf between us

289
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,230
with a tone like that?

290
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,983
How are things
between you sexually?

291
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,152
Oh!

292
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,570
Ooh-ooh.

293
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,613
No, no...

294
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,822
- we haven't had sex.
- Oh, no.

295
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,783
Ben has a little, bitty problem.

296
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,159
- I don't have a problem.
- Oh.

297
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,327
Yes, you do.

298
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,828
- No, I do not have a problem.
- Yeah.

299
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,080
It's a big problem.

300
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,790
- I do not have a problem.
- You have a problem.

301
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:05,958
Look, look, look, wait a minute.

302
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,459
The one night that we even
thought about

303
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,794
getting close to having sex,

304
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:12,089
all right, she up and decides
she's going to nickname my...

305
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,298
Penis?

306
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,800
Yeah. "Princess Sophia." Ha!

307
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,134
You want to talk about

308
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,345
shooting a man's horse?
Whop! Come on!

309
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,556
I thought it was
a beautiful name.

310
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,099
Hmm, I see, Benjamin.

311
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,977
And when was it
that you first realized

312
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,688
that you were attracted
to other men?

313
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,023
- What?
- Oh, that's serious.

314
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,567
Hmm.

315
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,610
Benjamin, this is a safe space.

316
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,821
Look, it's just simple...
I like women, okay?

317
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,072
It just happened that way.

318
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,490
Methinks thou doth

319
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,908
- protesth too much.
You see? Stop it.

320
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,285
This is the shit
I'm talking about.

321
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,369
What the hell was that?

322
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,370
Whoa, whoa.

323
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,413
What did I do?

324
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,081
I mean, this is what she does.
Stop that!

325
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:51,211
You know, I'm hearing a lot
of latent anger here, Benjamin.

326
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,462
Rage-o-holic.

327
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,714
I'm not a rage-o-holic!

328
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,090
- I called that one.
- Stop...

329
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,509
You know what...
take a deep breath for me, Ben.

330
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,012
Okay, and let it go.

331
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,221
Just let it go.

332
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,557
Yeah.

333
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,309
Yeah. I feel better.

334
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,977
Okay. Come here.

335
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,271
I've seen this before.

336
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,064
- I've seen it many times.
- Yeah?

337
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,357
Yeah.

338
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,235
Whoo, would you two
like to be left alone?

339
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,028
No.

340
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,112
Maybe you should get a room.

341
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,530
You are hitting

342
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,033
on our shrink!

343
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,492
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

344
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,368
No, I'm not.

345
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,411
And you are
a pathological flirt!

346
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,622
Jesus, five seconds ago,
I'm gay.

347
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,207
Now I'm a pathological flirt?

348
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,708
I sweat when I get nervous.

349
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,043
Which one is it, Andie?

350
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,670
And besides,
why would I need to hit

351
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:34,546
on another woman?

352
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:35,672
You've got more than

353
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,342
enough personalities
to keep me completely occupied.

354
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,718
That was hurtful.

355
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,428
Okay, Ben.

356
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,930
Are you ashamed of Andie?

357
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,306
- Of course he is!
- I'm not ashamed.

358
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:45,349
Of course he is.
You are!

359
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,475
I'm not ashamed.

360
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,726
How do you think

361
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,894
that makes me feel?

362
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,521
I'm not ashamed of you.

363
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,523
It's like, when I talked
to his mother...

364
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,233
he freaked out.

365
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,984
No, see, you-you did that
behind my back.

366
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,361
She did it behind my back.

367
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,363
I just wanted to say "hi."

368
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,781
Andie, you want to talk
to my mother?

369
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,032
Y-You want to talk to my mother?

370
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,033
Talk to my mother.

371
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,619
Hey, you want to talk
to the whole family?

372
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,162
You can talk
to the whole family.

373
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,540
Hell, we can go to Staten
Island, spend the weekend

374
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,541
with them, Andie.

375
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,000
Now, that is
a positive idea, Ben.

376
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,168
It... it is?

377
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,670
How about it, Andie?

378
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,046
What?

379
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,589
Would you like to go
to Staten Island?

380
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,823
Uncle Ben, hi!

381
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,452
Thanks.

382
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,453
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,456
Hey, Mom, Pop,
we're here.

384
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,916
Yeah, bullshit!

385
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,585
Who's that handsome guy?

386
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,962
That's my dad when
he was an ensign in the Navy.

387
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,630
He got stationed here
about ten years ago.

388
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,965
- Bullshit!
- Uh-oh.

389
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,300
Hey, darling.

390
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,301
Hey, sweetie.
How you doing?

391
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,552
I'm glad to see you.
Good. Perfect timing.

392
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,803
You know who this is?

393
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,889
I do, and I need you
to check the baby,

394
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,390
see if he needs changing.

395
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,892
I know who that is.

396
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,059
- Hi.
- Hi, Andie, I'm so happy

397
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,227
to have you here in the flesh.

398
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,896
You're just as pretty
as you sound on the telephone.

399
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:14,897
Glenda!

400
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,648
I'm coming!
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

401
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,400
Excuse me.
Show her upstairs, okay, hon?

402
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,653
Oh, yeah.
And this is Joey, Jr.

403
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,821
Bullshit!

404
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,365
And the whole family suffers
from Tourette's.

405
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,825
I hope that's not a problem.

406
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:27,826
You're so handsome.

407
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,328
Joey, he suffers
from being a stinky rose.

408
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,787
We're going to go get you
cleaned up, sir.

409
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:31,955
Go on out back.
Have a good time.

410
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:32,956
Okay.

411
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,334
Ooh!

412
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,335
Got you.

413
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,336
Okay!

414
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,962
You're it.

415
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,131
He got you.

416
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,591
Oh...

417
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,510
Uncle Arnold says
he's got three kings.

418
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,636
Yeah, right.

419
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,429
Okay, Uncle Arnold.
Now, dare I say it, or not?

420
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,430
I'm just going to say it.

421
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:49,681
Okay, I'm going to say it...

422
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,557
bullshit!

423
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:52,935
Hi.

424
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:53,685
- Honey?
- Oh, wow.

425
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,646
Andie.

426
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,356
Whoa, ho, whoa, well, well!

427
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,357
Come on out here, Andie.

428
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,399
- Meet everybody.
- Okay.

429
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,651
I want you to meet
Ben's father, Jack.

430
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:01,610
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

431
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,028
Welcome to our humble abode.

432
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,071
This is Andie, Jack.

433
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,656
Oh, thank you.
Nice to meet you.

434
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:06,657
And this is our Uncle Arnold.

435
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,866
- Hi, Uncle Arnold.
- Oh, hi, good morning.

436
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:08,992
This is Andie.

437
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,869
You got to watch him.
He farts like a howitzer,

438
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,496
but he's family,
so what are you going to do?

439
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,498
Intestinal complications.

440
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,500
Yeah, right, Arnold. Prunes.

441
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,376
Did you meet Joey?

442
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,043
A female Andy.

443
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,044
L-E.

444
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,045
Nice to meet you.

445
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,046
Okay, here we go now.

446
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,673
The game is Bullshit,
and you are just in time

447
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,550
for the lightning round,
my dear.

448
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,385
I don't really know how to play.

449
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,928
Well, we're going to teach
you how. It's very simple.

450
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,887
Trick is to get rid
of all the cards

451
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:29,847
in your hand, all right?

452
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:32,516
So I'm going
to look in my hand,

453
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:33,517
and I'm going to see
what I've got here.

454
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,018
And, well, do you know?

455
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,436
I've got two aces here.

456
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,273
Well, two aces.
What do you say to that?

457
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,528
What are you
going to say?

458
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,904
- I say bullshit.
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:46,947
What did she say?
I didn't quite hear.

460
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,115
Did you guys...?
I didn't hear what she said.

461
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,116
What did you say?

462
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,075
I said bullshit!

463
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,076
All right!

464
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,077
Well, she knows how
to play the game,

465
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,037
Yes, sir.

466
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,206
Hey, big daddy,
come to Papa.

467
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,458
Get on over there, big man.
Slick as a whistle.

468
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,459
How you doing, Unc?

469
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,210
Hi, Ben.

470
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:01,545
- That's my grandson.
- Pop.

471
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:02,379
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

472
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,380
Got a game of Bullshit
going here?

473
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:04,006
A little game of Bullshit.

474
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:04,631
Want to join us?

475
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,216
Good luck.

476
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,092
What'd you leave me with, Joe?

477
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,135
Look at the expert here.

478
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,428
Okay, now, we went
through the deck.

479
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,345
We're going to start
at the beginning now.

480
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,638
So we go to twos.

481
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:12,973
Let's see, now.
I've got myself one deuce here.

482
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,391
Bullshit.

483
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,434
Whoa!

484
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,643
Bullshit, Pop.

485
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,062
He's a human lie detector,
isn't he?

486
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,522
Try this, son:

487
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,607
Two threes.

488
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,608
Mm-hmm.

489
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,193
One four.

490
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,485
Three fives.

491
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,862
Bullshit.

492
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,573
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

493
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,326
You see whose name's on top
of the board over there?

494
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,496
Yes, it says "Ben,"
with a star next to it.

495
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:36,914
You still want to bullshit me?

496
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,916
God, you must be so proud.

497
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,584
I'm doing my best.
What do we got?

498
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,418
Yes.

499
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,377
- Did I b-b-bullshit?
- Got, uh...

500
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,296
No, I told the truth.

501
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,797
Three fives.

502
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,132
He's good. He's the champ.

503
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,302
All right, all right.
Lighten up on me, Jim.

504
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:50,969
What am I?

505
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,679
Sixes to you.

506
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,640
One six.

507
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,516
One six, all right.

508
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,017
Whoa, look at what I got here.

509
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,936
You see, the key to this game
is being able to read people.

510
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,646
Two eights.

511
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:05,859
Bullshit.
Bull... shit, Mama.

512
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:06,902
Huh?

513
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,654
I-I'm going to have to hurt you.

514
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,447
Uh-huh. You see,
Mom's never been

515
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,949
that great at it, but why?

516
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,867
Just 'cause I'm so pure
of heart.

517
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,995
- So pure of heart.
- Bullshit.

518
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,164
Hello, hello!
Yeah, where is everybody?

519
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,165
Hey!

520
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,667
Ho!

521
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,293
Hi.

522
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:26,547
This is Andie.
Andie, this is my sister, Dora.

523
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,048
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

524
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,508
Andie is kicking Ben's ass
in Bullshit.

525
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,551
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

526
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,344
- Oh, I like this girl.
- That's right.

527
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,847
Ben's starting a little
card collection.

528
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,348
All right, let me get back
on track here.

529
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,352
Gentle Ben starts with three
ladies, and that's to you.

530
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,437
What do you got to say
about that?

531
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,362
Bullshit.

532
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,741
You heard me.
I said bullshit.

533
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:55,909
Ooh-ooh.

534
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,578
Ah. Mm-hmm.

535
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:03,417
Uh-huh. What is that...
seven in a row, Sparky?

536
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,752
I think somebody's met
his match.

537
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:10,340
Well, I-I, it's...
all about... reading people.

538
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,343
Loser.

539
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,345
Okay. Two kings.

540
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:20,893
Bullshit?

541
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,355
Bull... shit!

542
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,444
Yeah, you!

543
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,112
Nah, nah, nah, no!

544
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,906
You have met your match.

545
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,782
And you, Mom...
Miss Pure of Heart.

546
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,368
Pop, I told you.
You're hiding behind a badge.

547
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,369
I didn't see anything.

548
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,370
Cheated me.

549
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,247
Betrayed by my own parents.

550
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,500
The only honest man
in this place

551
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,585
is Uncle Arnold, who's asleep.

552
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,378
But I won.

553
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,339
I'm going to go inside
and play with the kids.

554
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,049
Maybe they won't lie,
cheat, and steal.

555
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,509
Okay, keep my name
on top of the board.

556
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,510
Now, Andie, I hope you know

557
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,094
that we are expecting you
to come back here,

558
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,723
because you have held Ben
to his lowest Bullshit score...

559
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:00,724
Yeah, yeah.

560
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,434
...since his tonsillectomy,

561
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,353
and we are thrilled!

562
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,146
Lowest!

563
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,607
Why, were all his other
girlfriends Bullshit losers?

564
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,609
What other girlfriends?

565
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,610
Ma, he's picky.

566
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,780
You are the first girl
he's ever brought home.

567
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,950
Don't you break
his heart, now.

568
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,369
And that dress. Andie, now,
does that come in my size?

569
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,600
Yes, sir.

570
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,310
My turn?

571
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,478
Yes, ma'am.

572
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,441
It's... heavy.

573
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,610
Turn it on.

574
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:54,653
Good.

575
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,530
- Keep this clutch in.
- That's the clutch.

576
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,156
Brake here on your right.

577
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,366
Your gears are on the left.

578
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:00,909
- One down.
- Okay.

579
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,077
Now, when we take off,

580
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,829
you're going to give
a little bit on the clutch.

581
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:04,872
Uh-huh.

582
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,832
And you're going to go
a little bit here.

583
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:07,833
A little give, a little go.

584
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,834
How's it go?

585
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,419
A little give and a little go?

586
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,461
That's it.

587
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,339
Whoa!

588
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,679
A little clutch and
a little brake. There we are.

589
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,640
You got it?

590
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,893
I got it.

591
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:26,894
I got it.

592
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:27,936
You got it.

593
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,354
Whoo!

594
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,399
Voila, voila, voila, voila.

595
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:36,111
I mean, there's a lot of cool
things about a bike, you know?

596
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,571
Use less gas.

597
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:40,490
In traffic jams, you park
wherever the hell you want.

598
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:41,992
But at the end of the day...

599
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,035
Thank you.

600
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,662
...chicks dig 'em. Ah!

601
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,456
- Oh!
- Hey!

602
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,336
You look so cute.

603
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,004
Can I ask you a question?

604
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,172
Well, yeah.

605
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,381
Chicks dig this?

606
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,508
Yes, chicks dig this.

607
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,602
I turned!

608
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:10,395
Oh, oh, oh,
you're driving like a pro.

609
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,358
Yeah, look at you.

610
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,526
Ooh!

611
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,693
Look at this look.

612
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,487
Yeah, now, this shower...

613
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,031
...whoa...
is a little bit tricky.

614
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,991
The hot is actually cold.
The cold is actually hot.

615
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,701
You got to crank it
all the way up, at first,

616
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,371
and...

617
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,873
if somebody flushes
the toilet in Bayonne,

618
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,667
you are going to get scalded.

619
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,210
The towels are right there.

620
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,051
Everything all right?
Is this okay?

621
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:45,180
Oh, no, it's more than okay.

622
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,725
I love everything
about this house:

623
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,102
The noise, the smells...

624
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:53,438
Oh, well, the smells...
that's Uncle Arnold,

625
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:54,731
I mean...

626
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,413
What's wrong?

627
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:15,252
It's just that when
your mom hugged me today,

628
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:19,965
she really hugged me...

629
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:23,177
for winning a game of Bullshit.

630
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:26,305
Sweetie, that's a good thing.

631
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,932
Smile.

632
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:32,644
Smile. Now come on.
Give me a smile.

633
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,646
Okay, that's good, that's it.
Yes, you're scaring me.

634
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,160
This is home, huh?

635
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:55,454
This is home.

636
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,632
Hey, listen,

637
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:08,383
tomorrow night my boss
is throwing a party

638
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:10,427
for that diamond account
I was telling you about.

639
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:13,597
I want you to come with me.

640
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:14,890
Okay.

641
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:16,350
Okay?

642
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:17,518
Yeah.

643
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:22,189
As my girlfriend.

644
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,654
Are you calling me
your girlfriend?

645
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,657
Yeah. I think I am.

646
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,290
Won't tomorrow be the tenth day
we've been seeing each other?

647
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:41,875
Mm-hmm.

648
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:45,629
Maybe after that we'll know.

649
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:49,174
Listen, don't make any plans

650
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:51,301
for day 13, okay,

651
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:52,761
because...

652
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,806
we have a game to go to.

653
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:56,807
Uh-huh.

654
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:57,808
Oh!

655
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,852
They're not as good of seats
as you got us,

656
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,353
but this is Game Seven, huh?

657
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:02,729
Yes?

658
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,191
Ah, come here.

659
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,174
Okay.

660
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,341
Yes?

661
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,260
Lana,

662
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,636
I can't write this article.

663
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:37,181
Is your computer broken?

664
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,683
I've gotten to know this guy.

665
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:43,937
Andie, do you see any
patches or insignia

666
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:46,523
anywhere on my clothing?

667
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:47,900
No.

668
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:51,111
It's because I'm not your Girl
Scout leader, I'm your boss.

669
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:52,529
You'll write the article.

670
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:53,989
This cover is
at the printer

671
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:57,242
as we speak, with a special
section on diamonds,

672
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:01,580
which is going to take care of
my ad quota for the entire year.

673
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,458
I want copy on my desk
in 48 hours.

674
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,834
Okay, but, Lana...

675
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,295
No "but, Lana." You'll do it...

676
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:10,255
because you're

677
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,883
a professional.

678
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:18,222
Yes, I am.

679
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:53,465
You're beautiful.

680
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,102
You look pretty good, too,
Sparky.

681
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:20,325
Champagne, madam?

682
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:21,410
Thank you.

683
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:36,425
Chalk one up
to couples' therapy.

684
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:39,178
Wow. Some party.

685
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,679
Hmm?

686
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,931
You're going to do great.

687
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:45,517
I'm going to go to the bar
and get us a couple of drinks.

688
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,144
I'm going to go to the bar
and get us a couple of drinks.

689
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:48,312
Oh, good idea.

690
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,981
Okay? And while I do that,
would you please...

691
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:53,859
head over there, and...
frost yourself.

692
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,613
I can wear those?

693
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,531
Yes, ma'am, you can.

694
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:08,707
Phillip.

695
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:09,791
Lana.

696
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:10,792
I don't see you
at a party for ages.

697
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:11,960
Now here you are,

698
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,420
throwing the bash of the year.

699
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,547
I'm glad you could make it.

700
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:16,590
Like them?

701
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:18,550
Ah, it suits you.

702
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:19,551
I know!

703
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:21,053
Harry Winston.

704
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:23,388
How did you get
all these jewelers

705
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,849
to agree to appear
at the same fete?

706
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:28,268
At the request of Mrs. DeLauer.

707
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,311
Really?

708
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:31,980
Yes, you see,
Mr. DeLauer controls

709
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:34,316
70% of the world's diamonds,

710
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:35,651
and Mrs. DeLauer

711
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,319
controls Mr. DeLauer.

712
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:39,863
You're bad.

713
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,281
Ah! Enjoy.

714
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:42,991
Lana!

715
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:43,992
This is real?

716
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:46,036
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no...

717
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,287
I insist.

718
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:48,914
Montrez-moi Isadora,
s'il vous plait.

719
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:50,123
Yes, sir.

720
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,042
Such beauty
should be celebrated.

721
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:55,045
Oh!

722
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,088
Isadora.

723
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,465
Oh, no, I'm Andie.

724
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:03,178
Oh, and a pleasure to meet you,
Andie, but this is Isadora.

725
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,597
Tourne, tourne, s'il vous plait.

726
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:10,936
84 carats,
named for Isadora Duncan.

727
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,564
Congratulations.
You got her here.

728
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:14,731
Yeah.

729
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,441
But the question remains...

730
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,569
Does she, or doesn't she?

731
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:22,489
We're going to find out.

732
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,618
An angel of God.

733
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,453
- Thanks.
- I am Frederick.

734
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:29,663
Andie Anderson.

735
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,252
Well, it looks like you've got
some competition, anyway.

736
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,966
Miss Anderson will be wearing

737
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,759
Isadora for the evening.

738
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,139
Enjoy the party, Andie.

739
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:49,600
Merci beaucoup.

740
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,436
Oh, that's stunning!
Fabulous!

741
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:54,104
Excuse me.

742
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,106
Two champagnes, please, sir.

743
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,985
Pardon me, young man.

744
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:02,905
Would you be kind enough
to order me a whiskey sour?

745
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,656
Yes, ma'am, I can.
Mrs. DeLauer?

746
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:05,949
Yes.

747
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:07,784
I'm Ben Barry
with Warren Advertising.

748
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:08,869
How do you do?

749
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:10,996
The pleasure's mine.
It's nice to finally meet you.

750
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,541
I'm very happy to meet you, too,
that's for sure.

751
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,335
Can I get a whiskey sour, please?

752
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,845
I can promise you
that our presentation

753
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:29,598
will not weary you
in the wrong way, Mrs. DeLauer.

754
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,561
I cannot wait to see
what you present, Benjamin.

755
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,025
Ladies, do you
see what I see?

756
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,863
Oh, Phillip, that's ridiculous.
She couldn't possibly.

757
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:47,199
Don't be so sure.

758
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,284
She might possibly.

759
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,328
I think I'll go find out.

760
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:06,635
E-Excuse me.
You're Andie, yes?

761
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:08,178
Yes.

762
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,556
I'm Phillip Warren.

763
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:13,308
Oh, you're Ben's boss.

764
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,309
That's right.

765
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,352
Hi, pleasure to meet you.

766
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:16,562
Pleasure to meet you.

767
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,648
Well, I understand you've been
an inspiration to Ben

768
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,983
in more ways than one,

769
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:21,984
and I must say,

770
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:25,696
you look rather inspired yourself.

771
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,991
There isn't a diamond
in the room that sparkles

772
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,576
like a woman in love.

773
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,912
Oh, no.

774
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,874
I'm not in love.

775
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,208
No?

776
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,835
I guess I was mistaken.

777
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:41,378
No, no, no. I mean...

778
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,338
I mean, I've only known him

779
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,799
for ten days. I...

780
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:48,093
You can't...

781
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:52,097
I can't... I can't be...

782
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:00,355
Ben is a very lucky man.

783
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:03,358
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

784
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:08,405
Mr. Warren,
please don't tell him.

785
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:10,949
Please don't tell him.

786
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:14,536
Hey.

787
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:15,537
Ben, Ben.

788
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,663
Hey, hello, gentlemen.

789
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,373
She loves you;
she loves you not.

790
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:19,374
What-what is it?

791
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:20,375
I don't know.

792
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,877
We'll see.

793
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,045
Ben.

794
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,171
Mr. Warren.

795
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:26,798
Saw her, met her.
She loves you. You win.

796
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,092
Get ready to pitch.

797
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:38,185
Congratulations, point man.

798
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,436
I'm very proud.

799
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,940
So, you're the new
point man on the DeLauers.

800
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,067
She loves me.

801
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,068
Good for you...

802
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:49,029
and... good for whoever she is.

803
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:52,282
Ah, well...
thank you so much.

804
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,159
Oh, you're so very welcome.

805
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,286
Gloating, are we?

806
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:57,746
Yeah, pretty much.

807
00:33:57,788 --> 00:33:59,414
Warren told us, so...

808
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,124
Yeah, you don't mess
with my man Ben.

809
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,125
Mm.

810
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,961
Your man Ben
is a cheater.

811
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:05,838
Mm-hmm. The girl
has known about the bet

812
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:06,839
from the beginning.

813
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,674
She was playing along
so Ben would win.

814
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:11,176
Tell him to enjoy his
short-lived, ill-gotten victory.

815
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:12,678
We're going to talk to Warren.

816
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:16,473
No.

817
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:17,933
- Let's...
- Come on...

818
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,690
Hey.

819
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:25,691
Remember us?

820
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:26,692
- Hi.
- Hi.

821
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,026
You know, uh, Warren

822
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:30,571
is going to come over here
in a minute,

823
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:32,447
and it would...

824
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,659
it would be so great if you
could just, you know, like,

825
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:38,453
act like you don't know
anything about the bet.

826
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:40,330
I mean, if-if you could tell him

827
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:43,041
that you-you really,
truly love Ben, you know,

828
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,294
and you weren't just,
you know, pretending,

829
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:46,712
so he would... he would win,

830
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,339
that would be... huge.

831
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,925
So what's the average
Composure reader like?

832
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:54,928
Spunky, insatiable.
Uppity? You bet.

833
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,513
If you'll excuse me, Lana,

834
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,557
there is a beautiful
young woman

835
00:34:58,557 --> 00:34:59,641
in a yellow dress

836
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:00,976
that I must go to.

837
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:02,019
Andie?

838
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,187
Yeah, she's my "How to" girl.

839
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:04,396
How to?

840
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:06,648
Yes. Right now, she's doing
an article called,

841
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:10,527
"How to... Lose a Guy
in Ten Days."

842
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:11,820
Just look him
straight in the eye...

843
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:13,238
Yeah, and just,
and just, you love Ben,

844
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,865
and you never heard
anything about any bet.

845
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:17,034
Yeah. Love.
No bet. Okay?

846
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:18,035
I understand.

847
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,036
Awesome.

848
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:20,078
Yeah, that's good.
Thank you.

849
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,205
You look beautiful.

850
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:24,500
This poor schmuck
she's been pretending to date...

851
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,543
well, not even
pretending to date...

852
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:28,337
she's actually dating the guy.

853
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:30,672
She's doing the most
atrocious things to him.

854
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:32,466
She's... she's actually

855
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,968
named his...

856
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,596
She's named his...

857
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:44,645
You're Krull.

858
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:53,111
Ladies and gentlemen,

859
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:55,197
may I ask you all kindly
to be seated?

860
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,407
Now that we're all
suitably frosted...

861
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,201
Benjamin, where have you been?

862
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,911
We haven't much time to play.

863
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:03,789
Ah! And the ladies
do look lovely...

864
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:05,791
please help me give
a warm welcome

865
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,960
to our special guests
of the evening,

866
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:09,294
Mr. And Mrs.

867
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:10,921
Frederick DeLauer.

868
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:21,306
And now, I want to introduce

869
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,141
a true musical legend

870
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:26,770
who will perform
some of his Oscar, Grammy,

871
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:31,149
Tony, and Emmy
award-winning songs,

872
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,861
Mr. Marvin Hamlisch.

873
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:44,413
Thank you very much.

874
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:45,664
I really do apprec...

875
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,875
Wow, yes! Give another hand

876
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:50,919
for... Marvin Hamlisch
is in the house!

877
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,462
Ow!

878
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,509
A lot of you out here
don't know Benjamin Barry.

879
00:36:57,509 --> 00:36:58,760
Well...

880
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:00,387
shame on you.

881
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,514
'Cause he is a very talented

882
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:05,726
advertising executive,
a knowledgeable sports fan

883
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,436
and a wagering enthusiast

884
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:10,397
but most impressively,

885
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:12,774
he is one hell of a singer,

886
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:16,361
and he has prepared
a little musical snack

887
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,322
for his new special friend,

888
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:19,990
Mrs. DeLauer.

889
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:21,658
Oh. Oh, isn't that wonderful?

890
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,660
So, Ben, why
don't you come up here

891
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:26,497
and sing your song?

892
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:28,582
Oh.

893
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:29,791
Come on, Ben.

894
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:33,837
Ladies and gentlemen,
Benjamin Barry.

895
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:36,840
Come on, Ben.

896
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,433
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

897
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:48,393
Andie, Andie.
Whoa, whoa, don't run off.

898
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,394
Don't run off!

899
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:50,896
Ladies and gentlemen
you do not want

900
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:52,314
this young lady
to leave the room.

901
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:53,941
Thayer. Tony.

902
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:55,359
Would you stop her, please?

903
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,611
You see, tonight, the
really special event

904
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:01,448
is that we will be singing,
her and I, a duet.

905
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,575
Yes, Miss Andie Anderson.

906
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:05,077
Could you please give
a warm round

907
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:06,078
of applause! Thank you!

908
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,997
Andie. Andie Anderson.

909
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:13,752
Knock 'em out.

910
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:15,838
Let's see what
our song tonight will be.

911
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:18,006
Maybe one of her
personal favorites.

912
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:20,801
Marvin, do you know,

913
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:23,387
"You're So Vain"?

914
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,805
That's not one of my songs.

915
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,890
Can you work with me, Marvin?

916
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:28,225
Yeah?

917
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:31,645
Yeah, yeah, yeah

918
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,481
Yeah, yeah, yeah

919
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:36,650
You walked into the party

920
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:40,320
Like you were
walking onto a yacht

921
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:43,615
You had your-your hat pulled
down real strategically

922
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:44,992
Over one eye, you had a scarf

923
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,118
I think it was apricot

924
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,870
Strategically tipped
below one eye

925
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:48,871
Yeah, yeah, yeah

926
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,080
One eye in the mirror

927
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:52,249
As you made sure
you had a real cool...

928
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,959
- Gavotte.
- Gavotte. Yeah.

929
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,879
And all the girls think
that they'd be your partner

930
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:02,050
They'd be his partner
'cause he's so vain

931
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:05,095
You probably think
this song is about you

932
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:06,555
Ben Barry, you're so vain

933
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:07,764
So, so vain

934
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:10,809
You probably think
this song is about you

935
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,519
Don't you? Don't you?

936
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:14,813
Tone deaf and drunk is not
a good combination.

937
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:16,315
No, you-you fooled
me to win a bet...

938
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:17,316
Oh, I fooled you?

939
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:18,442
And you should feel ashamed.

940
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:19,610
Look, you took me

941
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,278
to a goddamn
Celine Dion concert.

942
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,821
You made me miss the big game.

943
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:24,198
Oh, smart guy's a rhymer.

944
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,616
Well...

945
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:27,993
Do we want everybody to know
your lovemaking is lame?

946
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:30,746
Oh, maybe because
you named my penis.

947
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:31,788
Yeah, you named my penis.

948
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:36,168
You named my penis after a dame!

949
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:38,170
No, I really think
you have to get over that.

950
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:39,796
Come on, you're so vain.

951
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,423
- No, you're so vain.
- You are so vain.

952
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:43,383
This is the worst thing
I've ever heard.

953
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,385
And you know that this song
is about you, don't ya?

954
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:46,637
- No, no.
- Because you're...

955
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:48,305
You're so vain.

956
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:51,558
...so vain.
- You're so... vain.

957
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,519
You do know the words
so well, don't you?

958
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,604
There she goes,
ladies and gentlemen.

959
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,147
There she goes.
Thank you very much.

960
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:58,565
Thanks, guys.

961
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:00,567
Take it from here, Marvin.

962
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,447
Wasn't she wearing
the Isadora diamond?

963
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:06,615
Isadora?

964
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:07,783
Oh, mon dieu.

965
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:09,034
Sécurité!

966
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,162
No, no, no, no, no.

967
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:13,580
Hold on, Andie Anderson.

968
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:14,873
I'm not done with you.

969
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,083
You used me...

970
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:17,251
Oh, I used you?

971
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:18,627
...to get ahead in your work.

972
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:19,837
You arrogant...

973
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,380
- Hold it!
...backstabbing jerk!

974
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,506
- Lady, hold it!
- Come on, Andie.

975
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,174
All right,
you drove me half insane

976
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:25,717
for a goddamn magazine article.

977
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:26,927
Oh, yeah, and you told people

978
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,929
you could make any girl fall
in love with you, and I...

979
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:30,264
- Ma'am?
- I was exhibit A.

980
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:32,099
- Now folks, time out.
- You talk about integrity?

981
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,100
- What?!
- What?!

982
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,643
Look, please,
just give me the necklace.

983
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,895
Then you guys can go on
and kill each other.

984
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,527
So that's what I was, huh?

985
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:44,653
I was a guinea pig.

986
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,488
Somebody you could test
your theories on?

987
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,656
Yeah, and I...

988
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,241
and I was...

989
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:52,035
just a girl
somebody picked out in a bar.

990
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:53,453
Yeah, you know what? Big deal.

991
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:54,955
Hell, I'm sure now

992
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:57,499
you can even use it
as a little twist in your story.

993
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,001
It's a good idea.

994
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:01,295
Maybe we should bet on it.

995
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:03,422
You know what?

996
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:04,673
You did your job now, Andie.

997
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:05,883
Yes, I did.

998
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:07,467
You wanted to lose a guy
in ten days.

999
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:08,677
Congratulations.

1000
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,846
You did it.
You just... lost him.

1001
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,433
No, I didn't, Ben.

1002
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:18,854
Cause you can't lose something
you never had.

1003
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:42,961
Well...

1004
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:46,465
...it's not what I expected.

1005
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:49,968
It's better.

1006
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,429
Congratulations.

1007
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:55,516
This shows me
you're ready to be unleashed.

1008
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:56,600
From now on,

1009
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,853
feel free to write
about anything.

1010
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:01,647
Anything?

1011
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:04,274
Wherever the wind blows you.

1012
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:08,654
Even politics?

1013
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,697
No, the wind's not going
to blow you there.

1014
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:15,786
What about religion,
poverty, economics...?

1015
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:17,037
This wind

1016
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,540
is really more
of a light breeze.

1017
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:23,043
What can I write about, Lana?

1018
00:42:23,085 --> 00:42:24,670
Whatever you want.

1019
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:25,921
Shoes.

1020
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:28,924
Laser therapy,
dressing for your body type.

1021
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:30,926
Use your imagination.

1022
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:33,178
The sky is the limit.

1023
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,392
Thank you
for this opportunity, Lana.

1024
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,602
Okay.

1025
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:42,688
And thank you for
making it easy

1026
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:44,773
for me to turn it down.

1027
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:53,157
No. I mean, look,
it's not something I'm proud of.

1028
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:56,285
Obviously, if I could...
do it over again,

1029
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:58,328
I'd do some things differently,
you know?

1030
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,292
Say, it's good to talk
to you, though, man.

1031
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:04,585
It really is.

1032
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,587
Ah, I know it.

1033
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:08,797
You are the only one...

1034
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,216
that knows us both.

1035
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:12,509
Yeah.

1036
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:16,221
Hmm.

1037
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:19,683
You want to go?

1038
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:23,103
You want to go to the game?

1039
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:25,856
Well, go ahead,
'cause I'm not going.

1040
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:27,232
Seventh and final game

1041
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:29,610
of what has been
a classic series between...

1042
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:32,112
Sweetie, I wouldn't have gone,
either.

1043
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:34,114
I mean, I-I would have liked
to have gone,

1044
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:36,492
but they probably
wouldn't let me.

1045
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:41,914
You're doing the right thing.

1046
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,917
Oh, sweetie.

1047
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:49,505
There's the Chinese.

1048
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:52,925
I'm coming.

1049
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,762
Okay.

1050
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:59,515
Okay, so that's going to be...

1051
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:01,642
Michelle?

1052
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:05,812
Andie...

1053
00:44:05,854 --> 00:44:07,272
that wasn't the Chinese.

1054
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:08,982
It's Mike.

1055
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:10,150
Mike?!

1056
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:12,027
Yeah, what do I do?
What do I do?

1057
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:14,613
Talk to him.

1058
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:16,740
Okay, okay.

1059
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:20,118
Okay.

1060
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:25,249
Mike?

1061
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,583
Mike?!

1062
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,961
Hi.

1063
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,712
Hi.

1064
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:34,967
So, um...

1065
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:37,052
what are you doing here?

1066
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:38,512
I don't know exactly.

1067
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:39,680
Um...

1068
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:42,432
It was last night...
I-I was...

1069
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:45,644
I was just lying there
and trying to sleep, and...

1070
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:49,690
you know that... that perfume
you sprayed on my pillow?

1071
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:51,441
Oh, yeah.

1072
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,861
Well, that smell is gone now,

1073
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:55,821
and, uh...

1074
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:57,823
Michelle, I-I want it back.

1075
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:59,950
I, um...

1076
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:03,871
I don't know
if you can have it back.

1077
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:10,043
Right.

1078
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:11,295
Yeah.

1079
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:12,629
Okay.

1080
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:17,384
But I... I'm willing

1081
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:19,595
to-to consider it.

1082
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,305
Okay.

1083
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:22,806
- Yeah.
- Oh, my...

1084
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:24,516
These are for you.

1085
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:25,642
Thank you.

1086
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,269
Hi.

1087
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:29,313
Hi.

1088
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:42,534
We could... kiss.

1089
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:44,328
I remember where you live.

1090
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,959
Who needs men?

1091
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:57,633
Ladies... frost yourselves.

1092
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:59,009
Mmm...

1093
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:01,512
Beautiful.

1094
00:46:01,553 --> 00:46:02,596
And cut it.

1095
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:03,847
Very nice.

1096
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:04,890
You like?

1097
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:05,891
Oh, it was superb.

1098
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:07,100
Okay, let's go one more.

1099
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:08,894
Right away, people.

1100
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:10,729
Real good.
I'll keep working on it.

1101
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:12,648
Tim, can I see playback?

1102
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:13,857
Open me, Ben.

1103
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:15,025
Please, break my binding.

1104
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:16,360
- Jesus.
- Please.

1105
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:17,778
- Get that out of here, man.
- Please?

1106
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,321
Straightening this out.

1107
00:46:19,363 --> 00:46:20,572
You might want to read this.

1108
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:22,491
Ah, no thanks.

1109
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,409
Yeah?

1110
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:27,246
"I've lost a guy,
and I don't know why.

1111
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:29,039
"What went wrong?

1112
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:31,291
"When I started writing
this month's column,

1113
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,211
"I wanted to commit the certain
silly dating faux pas.

1114
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:36,672
"What I didn't realize was

1115
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:38,674
"that I was making
the biggest mistake...

1116
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:39,967
of all."

1117
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:43,679
Here. Trust me.

1118
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:45,889
Read it.

1119
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,907
Come on set.

1120
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:15,794
Andie Anderson?

1121
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:28,473
Excuse me, ma'am.

1122
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:29,641
Holy crap.

1123
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:30,893
Where's Andie Anderson?

1124
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:31,935
She's not here.

1125
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:33,270
- Where is she?
- She quit.

1126
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:34,897
She's got an interview
in Washington.

1127
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:35,772
When is she leaving?

1128
00:47:35,814 --> 00:47:36,940
- Today.
- When?

1129
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:39,526
Well, like, now.

1130
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:43,822
You're not a therapist, are you?

1131
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:44,948
Oh.

1132
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,033
No.

1133
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:47,159
Good job, though.

1134
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:52,372
You owe me 300 bucks.

1135
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:11,808
Andy!

1136
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:43,006
Hey!

1137
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,877
Andy!

1138
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:22,087
Ben!

1139
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:24,214
Pull over, we need to talk.

1140
00:49:24,256 --> 00:49:27,342
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

1141
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:28,760
If that's what it takes, yeah.

1142
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:29,845
Now pull over the cab.

1143
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:31,638
Sir...

1144
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:32,639
excuse me, sir.

1145
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:33,807
Can you please pull the car over?

1146
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:36,268
We're in the middle of a bridge, lady.

1147
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,394
I can't pull the car over here.

1148
00:49:37,436 --> 00:49:39,021
Okay, well, do you have an ashtray

1149
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:40,481
or something I can throw up in?

1150
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:41,523
Gee, lady.

1151
00:49:47,613 --> 00:49:48,989
Watch it, broad!

1152
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:50,365
What the hell was that?

1153
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:51,909
Is this true?

1154
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:54,328
Ben, please.

1155
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:55,370
Is this true?

1156
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:58,415
Or are you just trying
to sell magazines?

1157
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:04,213
I meant every word.

1158
00:50:05,756 --> 00:50:07,925
Well, where you going?

1159
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,594
I have an interview.

1160
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:12,012
Yeah, in Washington.

1161
00:50:12,054 --> 00:50:13,388
I know.

1162
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:19,144
Where you going?

1163
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:22,815
Ben, it's the only place
I can go

1164
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:24,483
and write what I want to write.

1165
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:27,778
No, I'm not buying that.

1166
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,781
You can write anywhere.

1167
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:34,117
I think you're running away.

1168
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:37,246
Why don't you save your mind
games for your next bet, okay?

1169
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:38,789
I am not running away.

1170
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:42,668
Bullshit.

1171
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:52,135
Excuse me?

1172
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,348
You heard me.

1173
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:01,186
Bullshit.

1174
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:06,024
Hey, lady, what do ya wanna do?

1175
00:51:07,526 --> 00:51:08,527
Take the lady's luggage

1176
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:09,820
back to her place.

1177
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:12,197
She has alternate transportation.

1178
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:17,661
You callin' my bluff?

1179
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:19,830
You bet I am.

1180
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:40,684
Look who made the trip with me.

1181
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:42,895
It's our love fern.

1182
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,646
Oh, Benny-boo-boo,
boo-boo-boo.
