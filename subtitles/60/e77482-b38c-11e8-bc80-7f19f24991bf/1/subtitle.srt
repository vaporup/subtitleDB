1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,498
<i>It starts on a bridge.</i>

2
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,311
Craig!

3
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,516
What were you
planning to do
about your bike, hon?

4
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,460
I don't care about my bike.
I'm killing myself.

5
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,594
But we spent
a lot of money on
the bike, sport.

6
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,833
We only ask that
you take care of it.

7
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,306
Think of me, Craig.
I might want that bike
when I grow up.

8
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,040
I'm sorry.
I just didn't think it...

9
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,080
That's right. You just
didn't think about us

10
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,672
when you were
deciding to do this,
did you, honey?

11
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,717
Pretty selfish,
I'd say.

12
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,118
Have you thought
about how this might
affect your sister?

13
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,019
I'm... I'm sorry, I...

14
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,690
<i>This is the moment
where I usually wake up
in a sweaty panic.</i>

15
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:15,995
<i>But for some reason,</i>

16
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,203
<i>this time was different.</i>

17
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,676
I...

18
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,343
I want to kill myself.

19
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,113
Fill this out. So...

20
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,268
How you doing?

21
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,045
You got a cigarette?

22
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,588
Uh... No, sorry.

23
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,456
What's wrong with you?

24
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,722
I just don't smoke.

25
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,321
No, I mean,
why are you in an ER,

26
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,366
at 5:00 on a Sunday morning?

27
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,899
Well...

28
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,568
I guess,
there's just been

29
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,707
a lot going on
in my mind lately.

30
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,041
Go ahead.

31
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,043
Okay, well, this is sort
of difficult to explain.

32
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,886
But...
See there's this girl...

33
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,885
Yeah, got you.

34
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,856
And this summer
school application that
I'm really nervous about.

35
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,157
Summer school?

36
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,897
Yeah, it's like
this super prestigious,
kind of...

37
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,070
Why would you want to be
in school in the summer?

38
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,773
You should be
on Coney Island,
bird-dogging chicks.

39
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,407
Are you a doctor?

40
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,173
What do you think?

41
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,512
You... You don't really
seem like a doctor.

42
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,191
<i>You ever heard of
Doogie Howser?</i>

43
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,931
Well, I hope
they fix whatever's
wrong with you.

44
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,334
Thank you.
Yeah.

45
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,791
So, how long have you
been feeling suicidal?

46
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:32,588
I don't know.
I've been depressed
for about a year.

47
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,893
Mmm-hmm.

48
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:38,096
And I've thought
about it before,
but never like this.

49
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,833
You know,
never so real.

50
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,409
Did anything happen today
specifically to trigger
these feelings?

51
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,413
<i>Sometimes I wish
I had an easy answer
for why I'm depressed.</i>

52
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,475
<i>That my father beat me.
Or I was sexually abused.</i>

53
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,716
<i>But my problems are
less dramatic than that.</i>

54
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,556
<i>Like, my dad always asks
the wrong questions.</i>

55
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,924
So, Craig,
how's the Intro to
Wall Street class?

56
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,362
<i>So maybe this is
a slight exaggeration,</i>

57
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,028
<i>but I do have a problem
with stress vomiting.</i>

58
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,204
<i>And my friends sometimes
look at me like
I'm from another planet.</i>

59
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,933
<i>And I'm obsessed
with this girl.</i>

60
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,806
<i>Who happens to be going out
with my best friend.</i>

61
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,311
<i>So, is there any one thing
that made me want
to jump off a bridge?</i>

62
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,684
Um... No.
Nothing unusual.

63
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:34,885
Hmm.

64
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,658
You on any medications?

65
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,891
Zoloft. But I stopped.

66
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,401
Yeah, did your doctor
take you off the meds?

67
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,632
No, I just stopped
on my own.

68
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,597
Oh, you shouldn't do that.

69
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,407
Well, Craig,
it doesn't seem like
you're a danger to yourself.

70
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,708
So, what I'm
gonna suggest is that
we contact your parents,

71
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,770
let them know
what's going on,

72
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,715
and then we refer you
to one of our
outpatient services.

73
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,252
Okay?
But...

74
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,321
I need help now.

75
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,251
I know you're upset.

76
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,853
But, Craig,
the people that we admit
into this facility,

77
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,155
are very, very sick.

78
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,559
I am, too.

79
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,926
Well, can't you just, like,
give me something?

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,989
Not without your
parents' consent.

81
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,967
Look, this is
serious business.

82
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:21,473
Maybe I'm not explaining right
how serious this is.

83
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,977
It feels like everything
is just building up,

84
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,913
and everyone else,
they just seem

85
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,950
to handle everything.
You know, like...

86
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,084
But not me, you know.

87
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,824
I'm scared, okay?

88
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,053
And I can't go
back out there.

89
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,891
I don't know what...

90
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,361
I might do something.

91
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,494
So, I just need some help.
Please. I just need you
to help me.

92
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,871
Welcome to
3 North, Craig.

93
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,278
Um... What exactly
is 3 North?

94
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,075
Our adult psychiatric floor.

95
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,220
Oh, but, I'm only 16.

96
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,453
Our teen floor is undergoing
some renovations,

97
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,685
so all teens are here
with the adults.

98
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,219
And while you're with us,
you'll be expected
to act like one.

99
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,456
So, starting tomorrow,

100
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,127
you'll follow the schedule
and participate in
the group activities.

101
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,997
In the meantime,
we'll contact your family,
and they can bring over

102
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,302
a change of
clothes, toothbrush,
that kind of thing.

103
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,276
Well, I don't think
I'll be here that long.

104
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,675
I have school
tomorrow, so...

105
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,506
You'll have to discuss
that with Dr. Minerva.

106
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,545
Now, do you have any
sharp objects on you?
Pocket knife? Keys?

107
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,088
And your belt
and shoe laces.

108
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,819
My shoe laces?

109
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,124
We can't take any chances.

110
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,840
Hey, Dr. Minerva.

111
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,934
Hey, Smitty.

112
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,070
This is our new patient,
Craig Gilner.

113
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,705
Hi, Craig. How are you?

114
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,409
Um... Just, like, you know.

115
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,519
Well, why don't
you get settled in,
and we'll talk later, okay?

116
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,651
Nice to meet you, Craig.

117
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,185
It'll come to you.

118
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,194
Good morning, Jimmy.

119
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:00,893
What was that about?

120
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,798
Jimmy? He's a schizophrenic.

121
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,896
Is there a place here
for people more like me?

122
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,165
We got all kinds
of patients here, man.
All kinds...

123
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,603
Hey, hey, Bobby!

124
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,746
My man.

125
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,483
How about a tour for our
new friend, Craig, here?
What do you say?

126
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,046
Sure thing, babe.
Thanks, man.

127
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,250
So, Bobby's gonna
show you around,

128
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,724
while we fix up
your room, okay?

129
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,761
Okay.
Yeah? All right.

130
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,263
See you guys in a jiff.

131
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,269
So, is this like
a mental ward?

132
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,832
Not a ward,
it's a hospital.

133
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,342
Well, this is
where we hang out.

134
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,074
There's a record
player and such.

135
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,277
All the records
are scratched.

136
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,946
Some folks like
to hang out and
play table tennis.

137
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,949
Did they tell you
about the points system?

138
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,389
Points for ping-pong?

139
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,421
I think the name ping-pong
trivializes the sport.

140
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,464
But, I mean,
like, points for privileges,
to hang out in the rec room,

141
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,693
visit the gift shop,
stuff like that.

142
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,168
You can join them if you like.

143
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,701
Uh, no, I'm cool.

144
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,068
Cool Craig. I like that.

145
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,943
This is the shower.
It doesn't have a lock.

146
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,177
So when you go in,
put it on "in-use,"
get it?

147
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,414
I got it.
Okay, you got it,
but nobody else does.

148
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,249
So they'll walk in
on you when you're
scrubbing your balls.

149
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,345
And you don't want that.

150
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,081
There's one in
the other hall, too,

151
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,955
but I wouldn't use it.
It bothers Solomon.

152
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,586
Who's Solomon?

153
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,185
Hey, Bobby!
Hey, Cap.

154
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,027
Right here,
this is where
you call people.

155
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,702
Assuming you have people.
Or they can call you.

156
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,361
You know, telephone.

157
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,532
And this is the TV room.

158
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,438
People hang out and
watch TV in that room.

159
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,842
That's why
they call it that.

160
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,917
Um... Who was that?

161
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,785
That's Noelle.
She's one of the teens.

162
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,256
Did they tell you
about the renovations?

163
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,953
Yeah.

164
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,086
How old are you?

165
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,186
Sixteen.

166
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,855
Sixteen!

167
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,729
You look stressed out for 16.

168
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,395
You need to relax.
Get a girlfriend,
or something, you know.

169
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,132
I'm working on it.
Mmm-hmm.

170
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,634
So what is it you
do here, exactly?

171
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,408
Same thing as you.

172
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,479
You're a patient?

173
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,447
What were you doing
in the emergency
room this morning?

174
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,447
ER has the best coffee, son.

175
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,917
They just let you out?

176
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,283
No.

177
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,814
What are you in here for?

178
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,966
Let's go see if Smitty's got
your room ready.

179
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:57,072
Hey, Muqtada,
got a new roommate, man.

180
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,135
Hey.

181
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,317
Don't take
it personal, man.
He doesn't really talk much.

182
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,079
And I've actually
never seen him
leave the room.

183
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,389
Okay, guys,
lunch in five.

184
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,533
What do they have for lunch?

185
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,178
I'm sorry?

186
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,989
Please, turn out light.

187
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,807
Dr. Minerva.

188
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,241
I'm feeling
much better now.

189
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,213
I was feeling bad
this morning,
but I'm okay now.

190
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,246
So, you know,
I'd like to go home,
if that's cool.

191
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,357
It says here you're suicidal
and asked to be admitted.

192
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:24,089
Yeah, I thought you guys
could do something quick.

193
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:28,065
You know,
like give me some medication
to make me feel better.

194
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,361
Or...

195
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,534
Look, I didn't think
that I'd be committed.

196
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,207
I really don't think
I belong here.

197
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,506
A lot of patients
feel that way at first.
Just give it a little time.

198
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:40,704
How little?

199
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,768
Five days.

200
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:42,871
Five days?

201
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,677
No more than 30.
We'll have an evaluation

202
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,445
to see if you're ready
to leave on Thursday.

203
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,279
I can't be here
until Thursday

204
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,587
because I'll miss school,
and my friends might
find out where I am.

205
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,422
It's nothing to be
ashamed of, Craig.

206
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,191
Depression is
a medical illness.

207
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,459
If you were diabetic,
would you be
embarrassed by that?

208
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,064
Well, can I at least
talk to my mom
about this before...

209
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,196
Of course, Craig.
I just spoke to her,
she's very anxious to see you.

210
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,434
Craig!

211
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,675
<i>Don't blame
my parents for how
messed up I am.</i>

212
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,409
<i>Okay, so my dad
works too much.</i>

213
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,314
<i>And my mom's
a little too fragile.</i>

214
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,115
<i>And my sister's some
kind of child genius.</i>

215
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,849
<i>But it's not like
I was never hugged as
a child or anything.</i>

216
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,051
<i>In fact, they've been
pretty supportive
through all this.</i>

217
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:31,524
I knew you were
having a hard time,
but I had no idea.

218
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,096
That you were...
That it was...

219
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,302
Well, you're so brave, honey.
I'm so proud of you.

220
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,228
Really? Um...

221
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,370
'Cause I was actually
having second thoughts.

222
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,969
Oh, no, hon. I think
the doctors said
they need you

223
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,140
to stay here for a couple
of days for observation.

224
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,012
I think that's
a real good idea.

225
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,477
But I don't think
you really understand, okay?

226
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,089
Some of the people
in here are really
messed up.

227
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,252
I don't think
my roommate's left
the room in weeks.

228
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,589
I think we better
leave it up

229
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,359
to the doctor's discretion,
you know.

230
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,858
We've tried and...

231
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:17,839
They're professionals,
they can help you in
ways that we can't.

232
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,879
And I think it's...

233
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,774
I think it looks
like a real nice place.
Right, George?

234
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,649
Take your hands
out of my pockets!

235
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,117
Yeah. When can
I join?

236
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,988
Me, too. Can I stay, too?

237
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,826
Oh, no, honey.
But we'll come and visit.

238
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:48,302
They took my cell phone,
so some people might
try to call the house.

239
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,208
Just please do not
tell them that I'm in here.

240
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,708
Here are some clothes,
and toiletries and stuff.

241
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,874
And will you
eat something, please?

242
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,919
Lan Curtis.
Who?

243
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,020
Dude from Joy Division.
Hung himself.

244
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,651
Kurt Cobain.

245
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,996
Freud.

246
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,390
Ernest Hemingway.

247
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,658
Salvador Allende.

248
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,363
Jesus Christ, girl.
Can you pick somebody
we've heard of for once?

249
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,496
Chilean president.

250
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,234
Shot himself rather than
surrender to a fascist
military coup.

251
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,440
Mmm-mmm.
I don't think that counts.

252
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,603
Of course,
it counts.

253
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,236
If he was going
to die anyway,
it doesn't count.

254
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,302
Hey, Craig!

255
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,913
Come sit with the men.

256
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:40,724
Craig, this is my pal, Johnny,
and this clown right here,
this is Humble.

257
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,356
You got
a girlfriend?

258
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,655
He's working on it.

259
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,287
They got some
cute ones your age.

260
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,128
I had a lot of women
in my day, kid.

261
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:49,726
Yeah?

262
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,261
You don't have to act
so surprised.

263
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,170
Back in the day,
I was Sir Lick-a-Lot.

264
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,007
Ask Bobby.

265
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,844
But you want to know
the secret to keeping
any woman under your spell?

266
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,516
I love you.

267
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,251
That's it?

268
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,989
That's it.
But it don't hurt if
you can play guitar.

269
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,056
Don't mess with
the kid's mind,

270
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,685
he's already screwed up
enough as it is.

271
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,751
Why are you
so screwed, kid?

272
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,819
Mind your own
business, Humble.

273
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,025
That's cool.

274
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:27,000
But you should know, Craig,
if you don't open up,
you're never going to heal.

275
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,933
Hey, what's the pot up to now?

276
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,972
Eleven.
Eleven?

277
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,108
Yesterday,
it was 12.

278
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,342
Humble ate a buck.

279
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,907
Humble ate a buck?

280
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,849
The professor
bet him a dollar,
he wouldn't eat it. He won.

281
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,949
What is the world
coming to?

282
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,853
Bunch of nut jobs in here,
I'll tell you that.

283
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,458
What's the money for?

284
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,958
Pizza party.

285
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,996
So we don't have
to eat this crap.

286
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,867
They say we can have one,
but we gotta pay
for it ourselves.

287
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,199
Well, I have eight dollars.

288
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,007
Well, you don't have to
go bragging about it, Craig.

289
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,773
People in here have nothing.

290
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,005
Show a little
humility, please.

291
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,605
No. I didn't mean...
It's...

292
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,741
It's okay. You're young,
you'll learn.

293
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,682
Craig.
You get two points
for eating, man.

294
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,820
I bet Smitty's
got 15 bucks on him.

295
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,262
And he's got
a 20 spot. I saw it.

296
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,389
Let's go jump him
in the parking lot.

297
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,764
It's under the hat.

298
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,063
It's under the hat?

299
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,598
Sorry.

300
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,506
Check.

301
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,316
So, Craig, how are you
adjusting to 3 North?

302
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,987
Uh... Okay, I guess.

303
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:01,430
Dr. Mahmoud wrote that
you were taking Zoloft,

304
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,793
but went off it
three weeks ago.
Is that right?

305
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,363
Yeah.

306
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,927
Do you see a therapist?

307
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,133
Dr. Yanof was the one
who prescribed me the Zoloft.

308
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,804
I see her every,
you know, month or so.

309
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,203
Why did you stop taking it?

310
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,918
I guess
I thought I was better.
Like I didn't need it.

311
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,380
Maybe that's because
it was working.

312
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,592
Can you describe to me
how you were feeling

313
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,422
before coming
here this morning?

314
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,930
I guess, depressed.

315
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,131
Anxious, stressed.

316
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,829
Have you been
feeling more stress
than usual lately?

317
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,802
Any reason in particular?

318
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:46,207
Yeah. There's this
Franklin Gates
Summer Semester thing

319
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,370
that my dad...

320
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,782
Well, that I really
want to get into.

321
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,407
But the application
is due in a week

322
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,146
and I haven't
even looked at it.

323
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,448
Why not?

324
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,822
Every time I think about it,

325
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,417
my brain starts
this cycling thing
about not getting in.

326
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,462
What would happen
if you didn't get in?

327
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,525
<i>Then I wouldn't
be able to put it on my
college applications.</i>

328
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,125
<i>Which means I wouldn't
get into a good college.</i>

329
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,761
But not even Adam Smith
could have foreseen

330
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,068
the inequities of
modern capitalism.

331
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,132
<i>If I didn't get
into a good college,
I wouldn't have a good job.</i>

332
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,145
<i>Diffusing the situation
in Iran through
unilateral diplomacy</i>

333
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,443
<i>is my top priority
as Commander in Chief.</i>

334
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,549
<i>Which means I wouldn't
be able to afford
a good lifestyle.</i>

335
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,912
Hey, MTV. It's your boy,
Craig Gilner.

336
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,719
Welcome to my crib.

337
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,119
<i>So I wouldn't be able
to find a girlfriend.</i>

338
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,892
<i>Which means I'd
probably get depressed.</i>

339
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,200
<i>And I'd end up like Muqtada
in a place like this
for the rest of my life.</i>

340
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,902
So, what would happen
if I didn't get in?

341
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,634
I don't know.
It's hard to explain.

342
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,648
Do you have anyone
you can explain it to?
Friends? Family?

343
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:05,613
I have friends and family,
but it's not always easy.

344
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,354
It's important to
have a support system.

345
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,986
People you can
really talk to.

346
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,428
Have you been having
any other symptoms?

347
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,197
I have trouble eating.
I can't keep it down.

348
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,465
All right.

349
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,475
You'll start group
activities tomorrow,

350
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,101
we'll check in
again on Tuesday.

351
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,837
You have any questions?

352
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,245
Yes. Um...

353
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,410
If I'm feeling better,

354
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,452
do you think I can get out
of here by tomorrow?

355
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,953
Because I have school
and this application and...

356
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,013
Five days, Craig. Minimum.

357
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,082
I know this seems
like a strange place
at first,

358
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,423
but try to make
the most of it.

359
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,958
<i>It's Monday.</i>

360
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,971
<i>I shouldn't be waking up
next to some depressive
middle-aged Egyptian dude.</i>

361
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:02,477
<i>I shouldn't be showering
on a co-ed floor in
a stall without a lock.</i>

362
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,148
<i>I shouldn't be
lining up for meds</i>

363
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,118
<i>behind schizophrenics
and sociopaths.</i>

364
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,683
<i>It's Monday,
I should be in school.</i>

365
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:17,426
<i>But I guess
that's what got me here
in the first place.</i>

366
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,529
<i>When my parents
went to school,</i>

367
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,725
<i>they just went
to the one closest
to their house.</i>

368
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,324
<i>Makes sense, right?</i>

369
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,529
<i>A lot of places
are still like this.</i>

370
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,767
<i>Cleveland, probably Denver.</i>

371
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,467
<i>But not New York.</i>

372
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,375
<i>You've got schools
for science geeks like...</i>

373
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,106
Bronx High School of Science.

374
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,477
<i>Schools for thespians.</i>

375
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,675
The LaGuardia School
for the Performing Arts.

376
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,945
<i>Schools for do-gooders.</i>

377
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,954
<i>El Puente Academy
for Peace and Justice.</i>

378
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,421
<i>But the most
competitive of all</i>

379
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,788
<i>New York City public schools
is this one.</i>

380
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,121
<i>Executive Pre-Professional.</i>

381
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,292
<i>My school.</i>

382
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,763
<i>This billionaire
philanthropist named
Gerard Lutz</i>

383
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,164
<i>set it up in conjunction
with the public school system.</i>

384
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:01,199
<i>So it's not some
private school for elite
Upper-East-Siders.</i>

385
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,036
<i>You can be on welfare
and food stamps,</i>

386
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,440
<i>or your parents
can own an island
in the South Pacific.</i>

387
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,875
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

388
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,209
You'll be accepted
as long as you're
one of the 800

389
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,341
smartest and most
accomplished students
in the five boroughs.

390
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,182
<i>Like these kids here.</i>

391
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,103
<i>There must have been
a serious clerical error,
because somehow...</i>

392
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,306
I got in.

393
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,374
Me, too.
Me, too.

394
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,645
You, too?
You, too?

395
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:52,586
<i>That's my best friend, Aaron,
getting flirt-punched by
Nia for the first time.</i>

396
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,485
<i>There were many
more of those.</i>

397
00:24:54,793 --> 00:25:00,288
<i>Followed by hand-holding,
kissing and eventually, sex.</i>

398
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,430
<i>I don't like to
picture that one.</i>

399
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,726
<i>What I would give
to be flirt-punched
by Nia just once.</i>

400
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,198
<i>And so it began...</i>

401
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,538
Look at
those mahatmas.

402
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,075
I always wanted a Harley
with hot, tight mahatmas.

403
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,121
You can have the mahatmas,
I just want the beaver.

404
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:28,091
Hey, Bobby, check out
this bike.

405
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,128
Yeah, I don't get
wrapped in a bunch of stuff
I can't have.

406
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,925
Relax, it's just
for fun, bro.

407
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,290
That's not fun.

408
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,663
That's propaganda, man.

409
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,599
All those
Madison Avenue types.

410
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,761
Telling you how
to live your life.

411
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,704
Fast cars, hot chicks,

412
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,471
Reese's Pieces, Gucci.

413
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,207
Werther's Original.

414
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,782
I don't buy
into that bullshit.

415
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,412
Are you gonna
eat your burrito, Craig?

416
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,845
No, I'm not hungry.
You can have it.

417
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,557
Hello, Mr. Breakfast Burrito.

418
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,807
Humble, put that back.

419
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,939
He said I could have it.

420
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,175
Yeah, it's really fine.

421
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,873
Craig's gotta eat, too.
Put it back.

422
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,509
Take a hike, Bob.

423
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,445
He's not hungry.

424
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,891
Thanks, Bobby,
but I'm really not hungry.

425
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,697
Fine, what do
I care if you eat?

426
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,105
I understand
there was an incident
this morning.

427
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,371
Would anyone care
to talk about it?

428
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,843
Something involving
a breakfast burrito.

429
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,149
Johnny?

430
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,178
It was between
Bobby and Humble.
Ask them.

431
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,418
I was interested
in hearing it from
an impartial observer.

432
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,653
Well, if you want
my opinion, I think Bobby
has been on edge

433
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,564
because of his interview,
and he's lashing out
because he's nervous.

434
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,534
Interesting observation,
Johnny.

435
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,659
My hemorrhoids are
flaring up too, Johnny.

436
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,365
Want to tell the group
about that?

437
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,464
Hemorrhoids!
It'll come to ya!

438
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,437
Bobby, it's okay
if you want to keep
your feelings private,

439
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,742
but you should know that
there's nothing wrong
with being nervous

440
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,304
about your
interview tomorrow.

441
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,248
I'm not nervous
about my interview.

442
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,845
Then what is it, Bob?

443
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,045
Maybe he's hungry.

444
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,247
He doesn't
look hungry.

445
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,380
He looks tired.

446
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,548
Did you
sleep last night?

447
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,716
He didn't eat today.

448
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,781
Yes, he did.

449
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,056
Did you see him eat?

450
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,426
I'm pretty
sure he ate.

451
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,555
I didn't see him eat.

452
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:47,757
I get anxious
when I'm tired.

453
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,231
Okay, listen.

454
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,262
I'm not hungry
and I'm not tired.
It's just the sweater.

455
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,397
It's all I have for
my interview tomorrow.

456
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,034
I told you it
was the interview.

457
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,100
It's a nice sweater, Bob.

458
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,204
No, it's not.
It smells like
a hobo's Band-Aid.

459
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,507
But it looks
good on you.

460
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,341
About as good as
your hair looks on you.

461
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,511
Bobby, no insults, please.

462
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,789
I can loan you a shirt.

463
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,756
What was
that, Craig?

464
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,693
I'll just call my mom
and have her bring one
of my dad's shirts over.

465
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:20,328
It's not a problem.
I live like two blocks away.

466
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,456
No, thanks.

467
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,160
Bobby! Take the shirt.

468
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,229
Yeah, he's trying
to help, Bob.

469
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,834
It's a very
nice offer, Craig.

470
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,738
Bobby, why are you
reluctant to accept it?

471
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,972
'Cause I don't
want any handouts.

472
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,674
It wouldn't exactly
be a handout.

473
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,238
He'd just be
loaning it to you.

474
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,477
Okay, I'll take it.
As long as you'll
get off my back.

475
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,077
Do you want
the shirt, Bobby?

476
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,211
I would...

477
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,116
I would like the shirt.

478
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,589
Craig?

479
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,588
Is it okay if it has
yellow armpit stains?

480
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,697
Sorry,
it was a dumb joke.

481
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,063
When are you
going to let me get
to see her again?

482
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,103
Because I'm her father.
You don't think that I have...

483
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,336
What's that?
I do have...
I will have a place.

484
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:10,271
I have a...
I'm gonna have a place
on Thursday. It's true.

485
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,242
Listen, I never asked
you for anything.

486
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,586
Could you just, for once,
maybe do what I say.
Hello? Hello!

487
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,194
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

488
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,603
Hey, Craig. It's me.

489
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:40,110
<i>Okay. So,
she's probably not in
the bathtub right now,</i>

490
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,339
<i>but this is how
I sometimes like
to picture Nia.</i>

491
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,414
<i>It's sick, I know.</i>

492
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,181
You were acting
a little weird earlier,

493
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,446
so I just
wanted to make sure
everything's okay.

494
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,919
All right, that's it.

495
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,081
I'm with Aaron.
He's being such
a tool. Bye!

496
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,253
Hello, Mr. Gilner,
this is your science teacher,
Mr. Reynolds.

497
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,957
We really need to talk
about your missing
lab assignments.

498
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,096
Five of them.

499
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:23,776
Hello?

500
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,821
Hey, Nia. What's up?

501
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:31,219
Hey! Just finishing
my Gates Summer app.
I'll freak if I don't get in.

502
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,824
<i>What's up with you?</i>

503
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:38,128
Um. Just feeling
kind of, you know...

504
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,872
Yeah, I noticed.
Is that why you weren't
in school today?

505
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,472
Yeah, I was
feeling pretty shitty,
so I just stayed home.

506
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,573
<i>Yeah. I get like that
sometimes, too.</i>

507
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,244
Depressed or whatever.

508
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,710
Do you take
anything for it?

509
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,881
Um...

510
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,617
Look, I never
told anybody this.

511
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,319
<i>Not even Aaron, but,
if it makes you
feel any better,</i>

512
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,261
<i>I see a therapist.</i>

513
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,353
Really?

514
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,824
For, like,
over a year now.

515
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,423
<i>I had no idea.</i>

516
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,468
Yeah, it's pretty
embarrassing.

517
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,866
<i>I take Zoloft.
Shut up!</i>

518
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,264
<i>I do.</i>

519
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,400
Oh, my God!
We're like so
screwed up.

520
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,343
Yeah, we're like partners
in mental illness.

521
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,805
<i>The illest.</i>

522
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,840
I'm Solomon.
I would ask you to
please keep it down.

523
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,647
I'm trying to rest.

524
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,112
<i>Craig, who is that?</i>

525
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,885
Um...
Excuse me.

526
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,550
<i>Is everything okay?
Will you be much longer?</i>

527
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,719
One second, please.

528
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,261
<i>Are you like in
a crack den or something?</i>

529
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,196
Yeah, no, it's fine.
Everything's...

530
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,326
It'll come to you.
It will always
come to you.

531
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,902
<i>Where are you?</i>

532
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,530
I gotta go, Nia. Bye.

533
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:50,733
<i>Craig...</i>

534
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,332
It's all yours.

535
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,242
Thanks, Mom.

536
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,216
You know,
your dad really wanted
to be here today,

537
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,185
he just had a client crisis.

538
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,080
Client crisis?

539
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,317
Yeah, but he said,
he's for sure
coming tomorrow.

540
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,657
Have you made
any friends yet?

541
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,159
Yeah, I guess.

542
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,492
Are you friends
with the tranny?

543
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,588
Oh, the tranny.

544
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,093
Not really.

545
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,696
Did you talk to my school?

546
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,796
Because I really
can't have them finding
I'm in a place like this.

547
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,238
It could really
damage my future.

548
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,469
No, no. I just said
you were in the hospital.

549
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,805
I didn't say
anything specific.

550
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,778
Good. The last thing
I need is for them

551
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,108
to find out I've
been institutionalized.

552
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,648
Transvestite!

553
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,912
Schizo!

554
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,056
What's going on, babe?

555
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,192
Uh...

556
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,105
Sorry. I was just
dropping the shirt off.

557
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,168
She's cute, isn't she?

558
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,372
Yeah. Is she yours?

559
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,279
Veronica. Like the
Elvis Costello song.

560
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,544
How old is she?

561
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,777
Eight and three-quarters.

562
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,984
That's what she says.
Three quarters.

563
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,256
Well, good luck
with your interview.

564
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,761
What's it for,
if you don't
mind me asking?

565
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,229
A group home.

566
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,524
Basically,
I need a place to live

567
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,592
when they kick me out
of here on Thursday.

568
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,832
Let me know if you
need somebody to practice
with or something.

569
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,204
What do you mean?

570
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,039
Like a practice interview.
So you're better prepared.

571
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:35,944
Yeah?

572
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,379
Yeah.

573
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,472
You want to try?

574
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,538
You want to try now?

575
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,341
If you're not
doing anything.

576
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,614
Okay, great.
Uh... Hold on.

577
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,421
Let me do this with
the official shirt on.

578
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:54,190
Okay. You're ready?

579
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,268
Hold on one second.
I don't know if
I'll do it like...

580
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,971
Which is better, like...

581
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:02,834
This?

582
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:03,965
Yeah. That looks natural.

583
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,168
Okay.

584
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,670
You can relax.

585
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,015
I'm nervous.

586
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:17,677
Okay, why is it that you
think you qualify to live
in this group home?

587
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:22,419
Because if you
don't accept me,
I'll be homeless.

588
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,129
Okay, good.

589
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,301
Yeah, I think you're ready.

590
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,496
Really? I didn't
sound too desperate?

591
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,801
No. But, uh...

592
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,408
You might want to focus
on the positive things

593
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,002
that you get from
this experience

594
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,207
as opposed to, you know...

595
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,077
The negative.

596
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,410
Exactly. Like what
is it that you could
bring to the home?

597
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,717
Something special that
only you could offer.

598
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,955
It could be anything.
Maybe you have
a great attitude?

599
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,087
No.

600
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,131
You always clean up
after yourself?

601
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,166
Not really.

602
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,931
You know, I think
in these situations

603
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,031
it's okay to bend the truth
just a little bit.

604
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,976
Yeah. I just
don't want to get
people's expectations up

605
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,309
and then
disappoint them later.

606
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,481
That's it. You're pragmatic.
That's what you tell them.

607
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,452
Okay, yeah. Right?

608
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,318
Yeah, I know
you're gonna do great.

609
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,151
Thanks.

610
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,860
You want to play
some table tennis?

611
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,354
I'm pretty terrible
at table tennis.

612
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,729
It's all right.
It's just for fun.
Come on.

613
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,799
We play
a lot around here.
The problem is,

614
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,634
most people are
too zonked out on
their meds to compete.

615
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:43,765
One, zip.

616
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,302
She's a liar.

617
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:50,877
Please, baby. Baby.
Please listen. Listen.

618
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,815
I love you.

619
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,012
Don't worry about it.

620
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,090
Of course,
I forgive you, baby.

621
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,960
Johnny doesn't phone kiss.

622
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,770
You came.

623
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:26,180
Yeah. I mean,
I had other plans,
but I canceled them.

624
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,943
Good. I thought
I might have scared
you off yesterday.

625
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,355
Oh, yeah,
celebrity suicide.

626
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,355
It's kind of weird.

627
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,795
Okay, so check it out.
We're gonna play
a different game today.

628
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,062
Okay.

629
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,969
I ask you a question
and you ask me a question.

630
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,332
Do we answer them?

631
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,174
It's up to you,
but no matter what,

632
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,476
you have to finish
with a question.

633
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,072
Here we go. You ready?
Yeah.

634
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,346
I said
finish with a question.

635
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,881
Are you stupid?

636
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,220
Uh, no... Are you?

637
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,387
There you go.
Do you think
I'm gross looking?

638
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,993
No. You look awesome.

639
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,098
What's your question?

640
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,909
Why'd you invite me here?

641
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,541
I thought it was nice
that you loaned
Bobby your shirt.

642
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,549
Don't you think
this is a good way
to get to know someone?

643
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:33,743
Sure.

644
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,809
Have you played this before?

645
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,285
Not in here.

646
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,314
Are you a virgin?

647
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,450
So...

648
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,795
How long have
you been here?

649
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,297
Nice transition, Craig.

650
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,058
Twenty-one days.
Who dragged you here?

651
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,105
I checked myself in,
I guess.

652
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,770
Kind of, by accident.

653
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,077
The suicide hotline
said to come.

654
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,140
Why are you here so long?

655
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,976
They think I might
cut myself again.

656
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,615
Why'd you call
the suicide hotline?

657
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,219
I guess...

658
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,084
Maybe I didn't really
want to kill myself.

659
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,527
But I kind of did.

660
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,627
Does that make sense?

661
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,733
So, where do you go?

662
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,668
Executive Pre-Professional.
You?

663
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:31,867
Delfin.

664
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,972
You're not some sort of
school uniform perv,
are you?

665
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,511
You guys wear uniforms?

666
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:38,842
I knew it.

667
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:44,048
Okay, sorry, I'm gonna
invade your personal
space for one second.

668
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,179
Why?

669
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,252
What are you doing?
I'm just...

670
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,056
Ow, you shocked me.
Make a wish.

671
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,166
What do we do now?

672
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,037
Are you still playing?

673
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,411
No. Are you?

674
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,575
I'll race you
to arts and crafts.

675
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,986
Hey, guys.
No running, please.

676
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,763
Well, well, well!

677
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,939
Still working on it,
Cool Craig?

678
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,804
It's not
what you think.

679
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,844
I think the two of you
were playing the
question game outside.

680
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,276
That's what I think.

681
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,315
Well, I guess it is
what you think then.

682
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,372
I thought so.

683
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,944
This is free period
arts recreational therapy
for you latecomers.

684
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,823
I'm Joanie,
recreation director.

685
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,324
I'm Craig.

686
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,659
Well, materials
are on the table, Craig.
So just go for it.

687
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,455
That's okay.
I don't really draw.

688
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,997
Sure you do.
It doesn't have to
be representative,

689
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,037
it can be abstract,
whatever you want.

690
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,265
Well, I'll just hang out,
if that's okay.

691
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,969
Everybody?
Our new guest, Craig,

692
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:16,035
is having what we call
an artistic block.

693
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,539
He doesn't know
what to draw.

694
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,845
How about beavers?

695
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,911
Humble, we do not
draw the sort of beavers
you're talking about.

696
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,183
Oh, really?

697
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,118
That's actually nice.

698
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,286
I thought it was
gonna be a vagina.
That's nice.

699
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,220
Rolling pin!

700
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,993
What was that, Roger?
Did you say something?

701
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,962
This is weird.

702
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,971
Look, she's not gonna
get off your back until
you draw something.

703
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,631
Can be anything.

704
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,972
I bet you got some
crazy stuff in that messed up
little mind of yours.

705
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,798
<i>America has created
the longest</i>

706
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:21,276
<i>peace time economic
expansion in our history.</i>

707
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:24,638
Shit!

708
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,047
<i>With nearly
18 million new jobs,</i>

709
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:30,711
<i>wages rising at more than
twice the rate of inflation.</i>

710
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,517
<i>The highest home
ownership in history.</i>

711
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,588
Craig, honey,
what's the matter?

712
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,629
I can't do it.
Five years old and
I'm already a failure.

713
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,755
What can't you do?

714
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,322
I can't even trace Manhattan
on tracing paper.

715
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,527
Tracing paper!
Are you kidding me?

716
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:49,835
Craig, you can't
trace freehand and
expect it to be perfect.

717
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,667
Why not?

718
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:54,074
Because, honey,
you're five years old.

719
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,902
That's no excuse.

720
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,915
Mozart composed
three major symphonies
by the time he was five.

721
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,382
Actually, Craig,
it was four.

722
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,578
I have an idea.

723
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,985
Instead of trying to
trace maps of Manhattan,

724
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:08,024
why don't you just
make up your own maps?

725
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,523
Of imaginary places.

726
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,697
Oh, looks like
somebody got unblocked.

727
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,292
That is extraordinary.

728
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,064
What is it?
It's so pretty.

729
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:57,432
Looks like a brain
or something, right?

730
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,942
Yeah, it's a brain map.

731
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,767
It's a great brain map.

732
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,210
It's beautiful.

733
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,144
A smart talent.

734
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,684
I didn't
get the brain part.
Looks like a city.

735
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,048
Hey, Craig,
you got a phone call, man.

736
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:14,715
Hello?

737
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,054
Is this the loony bin?

738
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,324
<i>Okay, I've been
putting this off,</i>

739
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:20,658
<i>but I guess you
should know more</i>

740
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:21,789
<i>about my best friend, Aaron.</i>

741
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,801
<i>He's the kind of guy
that life just comes
easy to.</i>

742
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:28,770
<i>He's got a 4.6 GPA.
I don't even see
how that's possible.</i>

743
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,098
<i>And he'll
probably get into
the Gates Summer Program,</i>

744
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,539
<i>and claim something like...</i>

745
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,711
I didn't even
apply to that thing.
They totally recruited me.

746
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,713
Whatever, it'll look good
on my college apps.

747
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,239
<i>Not that he'd need it.
His extra-curriculars
are out of control.</i>

748
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,115
<i>I mean,
Aaron does everything.</i>

749
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,124
He plays sports.

750
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,652
<i>He started a film society.</i>

751
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,288
<i>He invented that
adapter thing that converts
vinyl albums into MP3s.</i>

752
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,570
<i>I just couldn't compete.</i>

753
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,533
How'd you get this number?

754
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,005
<i>My girl gave it to me.</i>

755
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:05,541
How'd you end up
in adult psych?

756
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,144
Do they serve beer in there?

757
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,680
Dude, can you
get me any Vicodin?

758
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,238
Come on, guys.
Leave him alone.

759
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,150
Seriously, Craig,
what happened?

760
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,881
I don't know.
I had a bad night.

761
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,256
<i>What do you mean,
a bad night?</i>

762
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,524
I'm just feeling...

763
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,722
Dude, you just need
to chill more, okay?

764
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,560
Your problem is,
you never chill.

765
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,491
<i>I'm gonna be chilling tonight,
where you gonna be?</i>

766
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,729
Here. I'm gonna be here.

767
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:37,396
Oh, my God, Craig!
There is so nothing wrong
with you.

768
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,608
Yes, there is.
I'm depressed.

769
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,239
I take pills for it.
Ask Nia.

770
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,047
Ask Nia what?

771
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:47,376
<i>Craig!</i>

772
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:50,147
Forget it. Maybe if
you weren't such a dick,

773
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,051
people would talk to you
more and you would know
this kind of stuff.

774
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,815
Dude, is this some kind of
pity play for my girlfriend?

775
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,494
<i>Aaron...
What?</i>

776
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,024
Fuck you.

777
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,899
I know, keep it down.
I'm sorry.

778
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,541
I don't have any friends.

779
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,790
This is very
tough thing to learn.

780
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:50,372
Huh. Seems here someone
neglected to turn in their
Gates Summer application.

781
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,245
Who is it that doesn't want
to study at Franklin Gates
this summer?

782
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,875
Or eventually get
into a good college?

783
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:58,046
Get a good job.
Have a good lifestyle.
Get laid.

784
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,650
I don't understand
why anyone would want
to end up depressed,

785
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:02,316
alone and homeless

786
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,654
in a psych ward.

787
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:06,924
Sleeping next to
some asocial reject
named Muqtada.

788
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,145
How many times are you gonna
wind up in here again, huh?

789
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:30,311
What is the matter with you?

790
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:33,181
How can you let your child
see you like this, huh?

791
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,481
What kind of
father are you?

792
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,261
I honestly think
it'd be better off

793
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,796
for her, for all of us,
if you were just dead.

794
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,656
But you can't
even get that right.

795
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,834
Excuse me, miss,
you're going to have to leave.

796
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,035
Come on.

797
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,449
You okay, Bobby?

798
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,987
My accountant.

799
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,324
Check the wrong box
and the woman goes nuts.

800
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:16,297
And so, who was
there buying soy milk?

801
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:18,800
Alec Baldwin,
which I thought
was kind of cool.

802
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,367
And I talked to
the admissions guy
at Gates.

803
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,872
He agreed to give you
an extension.

804
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,910
But, you just focus
on getting well, honey.
Don't stress about that. Okay?

805
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,848
Uh, yeah, you shouldn't
stress about it.

806
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,653
That doesn't mean
it's not important
to try for it.

807
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,156
George...

808
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,888
Don't you have
a client in crisis
somewhere, Dad?

809
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,795
It'll come to you!

810
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,580
Hey, Bobby.

811
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:12,211
How was your interview?

812
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:41,848
I blew it.

813
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,413
What happened?

814
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,875
Calm down! Calm down!

815
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,722
Okay, man.
Easy, easy. Easy does it.

816
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:23,481
Here we go.
Okay. It's all right.

817
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,368
And was that
difficult for you?
Seeing Bobby like that?

818
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,541
I was scared.

819
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,338
Not that he was gonna
hurt me or anything.

820
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:44,471
Just, you know,
seeing someone
lose it like that.

821
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,645
You know,
it reminded me of
how I feel sometimes.

822
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,049
How's that?

823
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,851
Like I'm on the verge
of just blowing up.

824
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:58,324
All the stress and pressure
and anxiety just bubbling up.

825
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,158
But I'm never able
to let it out like that.

826
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:03,494
You know,
I just keep it inside.

827
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,432
Have you always
felt that way?

828
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,597
Well, not when
I was a kid.

829
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,066
Tell me about it.

830
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,900
What do you mean?

831
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,579
About a time you remember
being happy. Carefree.

832
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:24,776
Uh...

833
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,723
There was this one day
back in eighth grade.

834
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:33,252
<i>It wasn't that long ago,
but time felt different
back then.</i>

835
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,256
<i>Like there was more of it.</i>

836
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,636
<i>We spent the morning
at Coney Island.</i>

837
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,575
<i>Afterwards,
we rode our bikes
through Bay Ridge,</i>

838
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:53,981
<i>Sunset Park,</i>

839
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,018
<i>Park Slope,</i>

840
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,219
<i>Downtown Brooklyn,</i>

841
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,221
<i>Brooklyn Heights,</i>

842
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,498
<i>all the way to
the Brooklyn Bridge.</i>

843
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,715
<i>Then everything changed.</i>

844
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:33,116
Girls, grades,
parents, two wars,

845
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,250
impending
environmental catastrophe,
a messed up economy...

846
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:40,558
All these things seemed
to come out of nowhere,
like on the same day.

847
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:48,765
Craig, there is a saying
that goes something like,

848
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:53,737
"Lord, grant me the strength
to change the things I can,

849
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,912
"the courage to accept
the things I can't,

850
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,914
"and the wisdom to
know the difference."

851
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,210
So...

852
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:08,123
So, let's talk
about your parents.

853
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,152
You think I can
change my parents?

854
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,025
No, but I'm a psychiatrist.

855
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,496
So I have to ask you
about them at some point.

856
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:17,755
Um...

857
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,994
They're good people.

858
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,972
But, okay, take my dad.
I just saw him today.

859
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,477
And he knows I'm in here
'cause I'm stressed out,

860
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,479
but he still brings up
the Gates application.

861
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:33,141
It's, like,
"Get a clue, Dad.

862
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,411
"There's something
bigger going on here."

863
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,311
And what's that?

864
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,357
I don't know.

865
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,089
But it feels big.

866
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:52,727
Thanks.

867
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:54,167
No problem.

868
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,835
Is everything okay?

869
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:02,808
Yeah, just screwing
the pooch with my interview.
It's okay.

870
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,244
Oh, I'm sorry.

871
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,303
I'm over it.

872
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:06,679
Really?

873
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,116
Not really,
I'm just zonked on Ativan.

874
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,346
Where'd you get
the ice cream?

875
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,445
Mister Softee,
across the street.

876
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,517
Bobby, man!

877
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:15,717
I want ice cream.

878
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,623
Can I have a lick, Bob?

879
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,457
Got to do
two points off, Bob.

880
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,019
It's worth it.

881
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,159
What's with these points?

882
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,530
Yeah, what is
with these points?

883
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:28,093
I mean, seriously,
no one could possibly be
keeping track of all of them.

884
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,334
That's
three points off for
doubting the system.

885
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,706
Ah, screw the system.
You can have some
of my points.

886
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,540
Johnny needs a lick.

887
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,102
It looks good.

888
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:43,579
What's this?

889
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:44,847
Dollar.

890
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,352
For the pizza party.

891
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,284
Where'd you get this?
Don't worry about it.

892
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,600
Yeah, it's a true story.

893
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,437
He was one of
the Black Panthers.

894
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,067
And you never
heard from him again?

895
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:09,505
Mmm-mmm.

896
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,078
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

897
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,843
Don't touch me.
See that lady right there?

898
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,612
She was a radical
academic up at Columbia,

899
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,118
and then they
passed the Patriot Act.

900
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,950
You know what
the Patriot Act is?

901
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,148
Yeah.
Okay.

902
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,852
When they passed
the Patriot Act,
then she went bonkers.

903
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,230
She thought that Bush
put bugs in all the phones.

904
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,466
<i>Pretty crazy, right?</i>

905
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,578
And that guy,
Solomon, over there?

906
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,246
He's nuts, too.

907
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:48,944
He's part of this
Hasidic acid-head scene
in Williamsburg.

908
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,432
He did 100 tabs of acid.

909
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,735
Don't look, don't look.
In one night.

910
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,875
And hasn't been
the same since.

911
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:18,905
Yeah.
Wow!

912
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,882
Yeah. Crazy, right?

913
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,476
Kinda cool.

914
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,110
Some cool people in here.

915
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,882
Yeah, uh...

916
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,447
What about you?

917
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,483
What about me?

918
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,629
I just...

919
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,291
You know, um,
your daughter, Veronica.

920
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:38,891
When are you
gonna see her again?

921
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:44,135
You know, I think
my daughter is just
better off without me.

922
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,742
Come on.
No, really.

923
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,711
I mean, I'm not really
a role model in this place,

924
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,610
and I think she's just...

925
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,444
She's better off.

926
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,949
Look, I know that
it's none of my business,

927
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,559
and you can
tell me to get lost
whenever you want,

928
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,597
but I think that she's just
gonna want her dad around,

929
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,861
and I don't think
she's gonna care about...

930
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,698
You should get lost.

931
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,633
Okay.

932
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,877
I think the Ativan's
wearing off, I'm sorry.

933
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,281
It's fine.

934
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,150
Sorry.

935
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,217
Do you have any
other puke stories

936
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,417
that you'd like
to share with me,

937
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:37,619
while we're getting
to know each other?

938
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:38,820
I have a few actually.

939
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:05,912
Want to try?

940
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:06,978
No, it's okay.

941
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,524
Welcome back to
musical exploration.

942
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,953
Um, who doesn't
have an instrument?

943
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:19,323
No worries, bro.
Let's get you right
up here on vocals.

944
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,704
Uh, no, I can't sing.

945
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,099
Like he can't draw.

946
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,769
Seriously, I...
No, I'm just...

947
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:30,702
Cool Craig,
what are you afraid of?
Come on.

948
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,781
Craig,
get up there. Craig.

949
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:37,346
Craig, Craig, Craig.

950
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,255
You know this one?

951
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:51,856
I think I've heard it before.

952
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:52,959
All right.

953
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:54,901
Bobby and the ladies
will help you out.

954
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,165
The ladies?

955
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,704
Okay, people,
just like we practiced
last week.

956
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,710
You guys ready?

957
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:03,973
Here we go.

958
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:45,582
<i>Pressure pushing
down on me</i>

959
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:49,921
<i>Pressing down on you
no man ask for</i>

960
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,790
<i>Under pressure</i>

961
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,159
<i>That burns a building down</i>

962
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,562
<i>Splits a family in two</i>

963
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,692
<i>Puts people on streets</i>

964
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:06,899
<i>That's okay</i>

965
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:11,606
<i>It's the terror of knowing
what this world is about</i>

966
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:14,149
<i>Watching some good
friends screaming</i>

967
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,479
<i>Let me out!</i>

968
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:19,711
<i>Pray tomorrow
gets me higher</i>

969
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:23,555
<i>Pressure on people,
people on the streets</i>

970
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,694
<i>Turned away from it all</i>

971
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,289
<i>Like a blind man</i>

972
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:34,163
<i>Sat on a fence
but it don't work</i>

973
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,901
<i>Keep coming up with love
but it's so slashed and torn</i>

974
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:42,240
<i>Why? Why?</i>

975
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:48,615
<i>Why?</i>

976
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,913
<i>Love, love, love, love</i>

977
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:57,891
<i>Insanity laughs
under pressure
we're cracking</i>

978
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:01,829
<i>Can't we give ourselves
one more chance</i>

979
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:05,857
<i>Why can't we give love
that one more chance</i>

980
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,800
<i>Why can't we give love</i>

981
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,998
<i>Give love, give love
Give love, give love</i>

982
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:14,840
<i>Give love, give love
Give love, give love</i>

983
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:20,349
<i>'Cause love's such
an old fashioned word</i>

984
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:25,718
<i>And love dares you
to change our way of</i>

985
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:29,884
<i>Caring about ourselves</i>

986
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,895
<i>This is our last dance</i>

987
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,899
<i>This is ourselves</i>

988
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,595
<i>Under pressure</i>

989
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,036
<i>Under pressure</i>

990
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:48,071
<i>Pressure</i>

991
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,797
<i>Oh, my God,
you're like a total
rock star.</i>

992
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,802
Like the whole
school's obsessed with you.

993
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,963
You're all anyone
talks about anymore.

994
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,904
You might want to think
about getting a new look.

995
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:19,867
What do you mean?

996
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:21,737
Don't worry,
we'll find you
something cool, Craig.

997
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:23,976
Cool Craig.

998
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,742
<i>What?</i>

999
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:29,216
Oh, somebody
in here calls me that.
"Cool Craig."

1000
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,387
Is that somebody a girl?

1001
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,481
Uh, no.

1002
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:37,854
Well, are there any
cute girls in there?

1003
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:40,793
Not really.

1004
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,425
Like, a mental hospital
probably isn't
the best spot to hook up.

1005
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,195
I'm dying to see this place.

1006
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,795
<i>Can I come visit?
Sure.</i>

1007
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,771
Yeah, you can visit.

1008
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,934
That is if you don't mind
the groupies hanging
all over me.

1009
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,671
Hey, get up.

1010
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:00,672
Yeah, sorry,
I told you I was famous.

1011
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,945
They were just
bothering me.

1012
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:08,252
You've really gotta get out
of the room more, Muqtada.

1013
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,882
There's a whole
world out there.

1014
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,672
It's just me.
Put these on.
Let's go for a walk.

1015
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,599
Oh, my goodness.

1016
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,467
Sometimes it's just good
to get out of there.

1017
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,106
Charlie, my friend.

1018
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,308
You got 30 minutes.

1019
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,512
Hey, what's the deal
with you and Noelle?

1020
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,187
What do you mean?
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

1021
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,086
Don't play dumb with me.

1022
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,681
The two of you are like...

1023
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:51,659
Your energy is like...

1024
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,428
Those were fireworks.

1025
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:04,800
You should ask her out.

1026
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:06,000
Ask her out?
Yeah.

1027
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,007
Ask her out. Like, out.

1028
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:10,910
Well, I mean,

1029
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:12,878
I like her,

1030
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,579
but I think I'd be too
nervous to ask her out.

1031
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,744
What are you nervous about?

1032
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,451
Rejection.

1033
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:21,819
Babe, you can't
live your life in fear.

1034
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,019
You're gonna end up
like Muqtada.

1035
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,026
Or worse, me.

1036
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:31,796
That's the part where you go,
"Hey, Bobby, your life's not
that bad," you know.

1037
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:32,926
Oh, sorry, I'm just...

1038
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,230
Relax. It's okay, babe.

1039
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:38,301
But you shouldn't
worry about rejection.

1040
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,500
You shouldn't.
You can practice with me.

1041
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,468
Practice what?

1042
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,206
Asking Noelle out.

1043
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,214
No, that's okay.
Yeah, I'll be Noelle.

1044
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:48,216
I'll be Noelle. I'm Noelle.

1045
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:50,043
Uh...

1046
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:55,082
Hey, Craig.
How's it going?

1047
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,949
Hey, Noelle.
I'm well. How are you?

1048
01:04:58,461 --> 01:04:59,519
Oh, good.

1049
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:01,889
I get out of here soon,

1050
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:03,625
which is pretty cool.

1051
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,758
Do you like music?

1052
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,134
Yeah, sure.

1053
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,668
I like live music.

1054
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:17,011
Uh, you just gonna
sit there the whole time
you're asking her out?

1055
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,239
Stand up. I'm a lady.

1056
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:21,812
No, look man.
You gotta loosen
up a little bit.

1057
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:23,010
Come on, loosen up.

1058
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,280
Yeah, okay.
Good, good, good.

1059
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:29,082
But I don't
like to go see live music
by myself.

1060
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,355
Oh, okay.

1061
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,658
Well, maybe we
could go together?

1062
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,557
"Well, okay, uh, maybe
we could go together?"

1063
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,499
No. Say that again.
You gotta use
more energy, man.

1064
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,799
You gotta go like, "Oh!"
You gotta be excited.

1065
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:43,964
Okay.

1066
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,871
Yeah, uh...
Yeah, okay. Well, maybe
we could go together.

1067
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:49,638
Oh! Hmm.

1068
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:52,005
Well, well, well.

1069
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,574
Who should we see?

1070
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:57,110
Um...

1071
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:01,148
U2?

1072
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:03,048
No.

1073
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:04,550
No.

1074
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:09,057
Vampire Weekend?

1075
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,964
No, no, no.
Don't be one of
those douchebags

1076
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:14,366
that takes her to some band
that she doesn't care about.

1077
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:16,671
This is what you do,
and this is very important.

1078
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:17,763
Okay.

1079
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,740
Ask her what she likes.

1080
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,100
Right. Yeah.

1081
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,372
Women like to be
asked questions.
Okay.

1082
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,641
Like ask me a question.
I'll be Noelle again.

1083
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,143
Um...

1084
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,576
Do a little flirtation
in the beginning.

1085
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:36,352
What do you mean by that?

1086
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:37,949
Comment on my shoes.

1087
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:40,621
Oh, hey, Noelle,
those shoes are awesome.
They really look nice.

1088
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,755
Oh, you're sweet
to say that.

1089
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:45,525
It's nothing.
Good.

1090
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,262
You got it.
You're getting it.
You're getting it.

1091
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:48,860
Okay.
Not bad.

1092
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,612
How'd you end up in here?

1093
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,250
Man, you don't give up,
do you?

1094
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:10,015
I'm on vacation.

1095
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:12,121
Seriously.

1096
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,320
I am serious.

1097
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:16,297
Some people go
to the Hamptons.
I come here.

1098
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:18,962
Get a little R & R.

1099
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,361
People feed you.

1100
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:24,064
I get high sometimes, man.

1101
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,006
That's not what
I heard about you.

1102
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:28,941
What'd you hear?

1103
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:33,680
I heard you tried to rape
a penguin at the zoo.

1104
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,111
Who told you that?

1105
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,418
Relax, babe.

1106
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:41,346
Funny guy, huh?

1107
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,357
Actually, I...

1108
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:53,790
I heard your accountant say
that you tried
to kill yourself.

1109
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:59,934
Well, this may come
as a surprise to you,
Cool Craig, but,

1110
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,776
she ain't my accountant.

1111
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,606
Gee, really?

1112
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:09,345
And I've tried to
kill myself six times.

1113
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:15,484
I thought about doing that,

1114
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:20,485
but I couldn't
make it to the bridge.

1115
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,326
I just came straight here.

1116
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:24,697
What stopped you?

1117
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:29,598
My family, I think.
You know, my parents
and my sister.

1118
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:33,739
Just knowing how bad
it would mess them up.

1119
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,543
See, that's the part
I don't get, Craig.

1120
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:41,379
I mean,
you're cool, you're smart,
you're talented.

1121
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,109
You have a family
that loves you.

1122
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:47,246
You know, what I would
do just to be you,
for just a day?

1123
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:55,896
I would...
I would do so much.

1124
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,067
I would...

1125
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,462
I don't know.
I would just...

1126
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:07,832
I'd just live.

1127
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,146
Like it meant something.

1128
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,251
Let's go.

1129
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,032
Smitty, I found
these laying
around somewhere.

1130
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,005
What's going on?

1131
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:55,046
Hey, Muqtada.
Are you coming out
for a walk?

1132
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,018
What is there to do?

1133
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:01,187
Well, do you like to draw?

1134
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,364
Ping-pong.

1135
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,435
Ping what?

1136
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:09,027
You like music?

1137
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,265
Yes.

1138
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:14,566
Okay. Great. Well, um...

1139
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,201
Only Egypt music.

1140
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:18,070
Oh, well, let's see.

1141
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:21,312
Excuse me, if you please.
I am trying to rest.

1142
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,176
Sol, have you
met Muqtada?

1143
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:31,259
If you could
please keep it down.

1144
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,220
He has sensitive hearing.

1145
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,266
This I think is enough
for one day.

1146
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,048
Hey, Craig.

1147
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:00,048
Hey.

1148
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,552
Um, this is a surprise.

1149
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,526
Me and Aaron broke up.

1150
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:07,556
I'm sorry.

1151
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,306
Are you okay?

1152
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:22,100
Uh, yeah. Sorry. Um...

1153
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:23,610
You must be
really loaded, huh?

1154
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:26,378
Yeah. I'm pretty zonked.

1155
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:30,811
So, you know
I've been thinking
about you non-stop

1156
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:33,320
since we talked on
the phone the other day.

1157
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,320
I've been thinking
about you a lot, too.

1158
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:40,053
I woke up and my bed
was on fire!

1159
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,363
What's wrong with that guy?

1160
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:43,957
He's schizophrenic.

1161
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:45,692
Weird.

1162
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:47,395
Anyway,

1163
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:53,169
it's like you told me
all this stuff about you
and you're really mature.

1164
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:56,243
Not like everyone else
with their stupid
little problems.

1165
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,405
I mean, you're really,
really screwed up.

1166
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:00,880
I'm a mess.

1167
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,716
But in a good way.
You know, in the way
that gives you

1168
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:06,410
experience.

1169
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:09,254
So you and Aaron broke up?

1170
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:15,123
<i>Okay, so I know I should
be thinking about Noelle,</i>

1171
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,495
<i>and how I'm supposed to be
meeting her in 20 minutes.</i>

1172
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:20,262
<i>But when you have
a really gorgeous
girl in front of you,</i>

1173
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,361
<i>and you've been
obsessing over her
for two years,</i>

1174
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:26,340
<i>and she's biting her lip
and talking low,
and you've got a boner,</i>

1175
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,474
<i>what are you gonna do?</i>

1176
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:32,243
Do you want to see my room?

1177
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,320
You haven't
finished that yet?

1178
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:44,484
What?

1179
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:46,717
Oh.

1180
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,958
Yes, we have a lot of
activities here, so...

1181
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:51,730
Takes up...

1182
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,875
Me and Aaron never did
anything like this.

1183
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:14,219
This was totally
on my checklist.

1184
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:21,755
Is someone else in here?

1185
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:22,922
I'm gonna be sick.

1186
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:24,556
Sex!

1187
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,028
Sex in my bed!

1188
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:28,898
God, that's disgusting.

1189
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,996
Children make
sex in my bed!

1190
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,665
Craig, who is this?

1191
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,299
Um, this is my
roommate, Muqtada.

1192
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,843
Don't talk to her!

1193
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,071
She try and
make sex in my bed!

1194
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,080
Calm down. No one
was having sex, okay?

1195
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:40,945
Woman is temptress! I know.

1196
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:42,444
What's wrong with you?
Get out.

1197
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,918
Uh, he's going
through a hard time.

1198
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:47,148
No, you!
What's wrong with you?

1199
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:48,951
I'm also going
through a hard time.

1200
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,219
Um, you know what?
You should get some rest,

1201
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:52,521
and I'll call you
tomorrow or something.

1202
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,118
Nia. Nia, wait.

1203
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:00,459
Wait. Nia.

1204
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:05,803
I love you.

1205
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,135
Just get better, Craig.

1206
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:17,543
No, I mean...

1207
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:51,413
Noelle.

1208
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:53,778
Noelle, please.

1209
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,088
I'm sorry I messed up.

1210
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,926
I love your portrait.
It's amazing.

1211
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,493
I wish you'd open the door.

1212
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:06,032
Are you okay?

1213
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:16,639
Oh. Uh...

1214
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:20,707
This is pretty cool, too.

1215
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,220
So, our meeting tonight.

1216
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,185
Is it safe to assume
that's not happening?

1217
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,204
You've had it figured
out all along, Muqtada.

1218
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,665
Never get out of the bed.

1219
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:58,744
I got in.

1220
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,118
In what?

1221
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:04,648
In your mama.

1222
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:05,693
Oh.

1223
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:09,857
I got in the home.

1224
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,594
That's great.

1225
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,202
We missed you at breakfast.

1226
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,741
<i>Is this about this
whole NialNoelle fiasco?</i>

1227
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:24,771
How do you
know about that?

1228
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:27,314
Solomon. That dude's
got sensitive hearing.

1229
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,482
Look, it's not
just women, okay?

1230
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:33,681
I can't do anything right.
My life's a mess.

1231
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,455
No, my life is a mess.

1232
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,490
Muqtada's life is a mess.
No offense, babe.

1233
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,189
All good, papa.

1234
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:46,326
Look, I happen
to like you, Craig.

1235
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:50,496
You remind me of me
when I was your age.

1236
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:54,037
I was much better looking,
and I didn't have as much
trouble with women...

1237
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,270
Get back on track, man.

1238
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:58,939
The point is, in 20 years,

1239
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,939
if you're celebrating
your daughter's
eighth birthday

1240
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:03,041
in a place like this,

1241
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:06,649
I swear to God,

1242
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,380
Muqtada and I are going
to kick your ass.

1243
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,989
He not busy being born,

1244
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,820
is busy dying.

1245
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:22,227
You need to believe that.

1246
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,009
This Bobby,

1247
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:32,811
I think, very wise man.

1248
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,080
By the way, I was just
coming in to tell you that

1249
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,415
I'm not gonna be
homeless tomorrow.

1250
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:41,714
I'm just saying.

1251
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,009
And guess what?

1252
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,840
It's right next door
to the YMCA.

1253
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,279
Yeah. So we can go swimming
in the swimming pool,

1254
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,444
and maybe play
table tennis.

1255
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,551
Ping-pong, yes.

1256
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:18,583
It's the same thing.

1257
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,185
So listen, your mom will
bring you by on Saturday,

1258
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:22,924
and we could have a feast.

1259
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:59,733
There are so many people,
you know, not just
in this hospital,

1260
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:03,498
but in the whole world,
who are struggling
so hard just to live.

1261
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:09,001
And, it's like,
self-indulgent for me to
not appreciate what I have.

1262
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,602
Like what?

1263
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:17,317
Well, there's my family,
my home, and my friends.

1264
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,780
And you know,
there's this.

1265
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:26,719
I used to think art was just
bourgeois decadence, but...

1266
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,563
It's really wonderful, Craig.

1267
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,230
Thanks. Um...

1268
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,139
Yeah, I've done
about 20 of them

1269
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:41,038
and it's something
that I really enjoy.

1270
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:43,134
What do you enjoy about it?

1271
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,036
It's fun.

1272
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,846
And it takes my mind
off the things
that stress me out.

1273
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,814
You gonna continue it
when you leave?

1274
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:53,880
Yeah.

1275
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:57,753
Or, I think.
But my dad might freak.

1276
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,958
Have you told him
how you feel?

1277
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,222
Not yet.

1278
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,691
But you will?

1279
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:05,861
I think so.

1280
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,132
Thank you.

1281
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,642
It's my last
night tonight, Smitty.

1282
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,646
It is your
last night, Craig.

1283
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:23,673
I hate to break it to you,
Craig, but I think
I'm really gonna miss you.

1284
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:28,251
Well, it's Bobby's
last night, too,

1285
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:31,121
so I was wondering if we
could have a pizza party.

1286
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:35,229
Yes, we can.
Yeah. Do you have the money?
If you can get the money.

1287
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,629
Yeah, no, I'll have
the money. Yeah, I...

1288
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,326
You have records
you could bring?

1289
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:56,011
Hey, um, thanks for coming.

1290
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,087
I just wanted to say,
I'm really sorry about
what happened yesterday.

1291
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:05,816
That girl I was with,
she's my best
friend's girlfriend.

1292
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,555
I've been obsessed
with her forever and...

1293
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:09,187
And you're
in love with her?

1294
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:10,889
No.

1295
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:13,434
Well, of course not.
But you think she's hot,

1296
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:15,526
so you told her what you
thought she'd want to hear.

1297
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,939
And now you're going to
do the same thing to me.

1298
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:21,540
No, I'm not.

1299
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,141
You're not?

1300
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,981
Look, um,
I do think you're hot.

1301
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,248
And I do want to say
the right thing,

1302
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,756
but that's only
because I really like you.

1303
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:41,457
I like how you don't
hide your problems
like everyone else.

1304
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:45,758
And I feel like I don't
have to hide mine
when I'm around you.

1305
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:51,371
You know, I've been thinking
about it a lot recently,

1306
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,168
and I've realized that

1307
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:58,034
if you're not busy being born,
you're busy dying.

1308
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:02,178
And I, for one,
think that we could
both benefit from

1309
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,242
being born, again.

1310
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:09,654
Not being born again,
but you know what I mean?

1311
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:11,887
Gee, thanks for
the wisdom, Bob.

1312
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,327
What? He told you that, too?

1313
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,130
Who?
Bobby.

1314
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:19,894
Yeah, me and about
a billion other people.

1315
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,701
Bob Dylan.

1316
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,973
It's the song
you just quoted.

1317
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,104
What? No.
Yes.

1318
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:31,936
Oh.

1319
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,417
Anyway, my point is

1320
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,287
I want to play
doctor with you.

1321
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:03,664
This is awesome.

1322
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:14,136
So, how come you
never asked me why?

1323
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:17,179
Why what?

1324
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:29,626
I guess I just
assumed you'd tell me
when you wanted me to know.

1325
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:35,093
Thanks.

1326
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:44,606
Do you like music?

1327
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,113
Do you like breathing?

1328
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:50,077
That's right.
It was a dumb question.

1329
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:57,924
I like... I like
Radiohead a lot,
the Pixies, T. Rex.

1330
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,317
Oh, what else?

1331
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,854
Have you seen them live?

1332
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,594
I saw Radiohead
and the Pixies once.

1333
01:25:07,168 --> 01:25:08,260
Cool.

1334
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,738
So, uh...

1335
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:18,439
You know, Vampire Weekend's
doing a show at the end
of the month.

1336
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:23,912
Would you want to go?

1337
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,345
Yes, I would.

1338
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:29,847
With you, right?

1339
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:31,551
No, with Solomon.

1340
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:33,688
Yeah, with me.

1341
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,531
<i>Sorry guys. Um...</i>

1342
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,496
<i>This is about to
get pretty sappy,</i>

1343
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:47,666
<i>so I'm just gonna
give you the highlights.</i>

1344
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:49,505
<i>This is me sharing
the realization that</i>

1345
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:52,569
<i>I don't actually want to be
a CEO, lawyer, or President.</i>

1346
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:55,547
<i>This is Noelle,</i>

1347
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:58,552
<i>laughing at the idea
that I once wanted
to be President.</i>

1348
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:01,418
<i>Here, Noelle suggests
I "screw"</i>

1349
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:04,458
<i>the Gates Summer application
if it makes me so unhappy.</i>

1350
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,052
<i>This is me
liking that idea.</i>

1351
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:11,331
<i>This is me thinking about
how to tell my dad.</i>

1352
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:17,162
<i>This is after I tell Noelle
how beautiful I think she is.</i>

1353
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:49,366
Okay, just have them
send the delivery guy
to the third floor.

1354
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:50,929
3 North.

1355
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:53,166
<i>No problem, sport.
You got it.</i>

1356
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,833
<i>Thanks, Dad.
Sure.</i>

1357
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:56,240
Yeah, I'll see you
and Mom tomorrow.

1358
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:57,369
<i>I'll see you then.</i>

1359
01:26:57,445 --> 01:26:58,935
<i>Okay, bye.
Bye.</i>

1360
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:04,785
Hey, Muqtada.

1361
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:21,902
<i>Hello?
Hey, man.</i>

1362
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:24,563
I could really use a favor.

1363
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:37,947
Hey, found it.

1364
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:39,846
I so appreciate this.

1365
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,548
Yeah, no problem.

1366
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:46,015
Look, man, I'm sorry
I was a bitch to you.

1367
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:50,261
I'm sorry
I tried to make out
with your girlfriend.

1368
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:54,928
How are things with Nia?

1369
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:57,463
Um, we're gonna try
and work through it.

1370
01:27:57,705 --> 01:27:58,797
Good.

1371
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:01,869
You know, I might
hide it pretty well, but,

1372
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:05,674
I mean, I get that depression
stuff, too, sometimes.

1373
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:07,079
Yeah?

1374
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:11,279
Don't kill yourself, okay?

1375
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,282
I won't.

1376
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:14,753
Seriously.

1377
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:16,784
Thanks.

1378
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:25,159
I'll call you tomorrow,
all right?

1379
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:26,564
Yeah, you will.

1380
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:29,196
Hey, um...

1381
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,330
Did you really try
to make out with Nia?

1382
01:28:36,444 --> 01:28:37,502
Dick.

1383
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:42,850
Pizza's getting cold.
What's up?

1384
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:46,376
I'm tired, man.

1385
01:28:47,555 --> 01:28:49,989
Think I'll skip out
on the pizza shin-dig.

1386
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:51,683
Pack up.

1387
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,420
Ah, vacation's over.

1388
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,430
Yes, back to work.

1389
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,762
You got a job?
No.

1390
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:03,328
Well, congratulations
on your home.

1391
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:04,598
Thanks.

1392
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:11,075
You know, I used that
Dylan line on Noelle.

1393
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:15,481
How'd it go?

1394
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:18,311
Good. We're gonna
hang out soon.

1395
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:20,411
Yeah?
Maybe see some music.

1396
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:22,247
Good.

1397
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:28,851
Here.

1398
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:32,857
It's you.

1399
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:34,925
Yikes. It's a mess
in there, man.

1400
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:36,998
Oh, it's not such a mess.

1401
01:29:37,672 --> 01:29:39,765
It's just
undergoing renovations.

1402
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:44,869
Look, I wrote
my number on the back.

1403
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:49,013
We should get
together sometime,
play some table tennis.

1404
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:53,078
Sure.

1405
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:59,184
Cool. Well, I'll see you
tomorrow at breakfast.

1406
01:30:02,497 --> 01:30:03,555
Good luck, Craig.

1407
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:07,393
Not that you
need it, but...

1408
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:15,268
Thanks. You, too, babe.

1409
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,488
Hey, come on.

1410
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:08,722
Trust me.

1411
01:31:09,363 --> 01:31:10,352
I gotta dance.

1412
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:20,504
Excuse me?

1413
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:47,733
I like this.

1414
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:49,897
I like this. Yeah!

1415
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:56,902
Look.

1416
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:06,470
So long, buddy.

1417
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:08,014
You should
probably stay longer.

1418
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:09,777
You might lose it
on the outside.

1419
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:12,650
Um, I'll take my chances.

1420
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,415
It'll come to you!

1421
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:19,124
<i>Okay, I know you're
thinking, "What is this?</i>

1422
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:21,358
<i>"Kid spends a few days
in the hospital</i>

1423
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:22,919
<i>"and all his problems
are cured?"</i>

1424
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:25,158
<i>But I'm not.
I know I'm not.</i>

1425
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,796
<i>I can tell this is
just the beginning.</i>

1426
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:33,132
<i>I still need to face
my homework, my school,
my friends.</i>

1427
01:33:33,674 --> 01:33:35,073
<i>My dad.</i>

1428
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:37,704
Hello, Smitty.
Hey, hey.

1429
01:33:38,145 --> 01:33:39,737
Thanks for everything.
Yeah.

1430
01:33:40,047 --> 01:33:42,277
Sure. You're very
welcome, sir.

1431
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:44,980
Have you seen Bobby around?

1432
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:47,714
Yeah, Bobby left
pretty early this morning.

1433
01:33:50,691 --> 01:33:53,888
<i>But the difference between
today and last Saturday</i>

1434
01:33:54,595 --> 01:33:56,586
<i>is that for
the first time in a while,</i>

1435
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:59,462
<i>I can look forward
to the things
I want to do in my life.</i>

1436
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:03,604
How you feeling?

1437
01:34:04,572 --> 01:34:06,062
I feel like...

1438
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:08,604
Like I can handle it.

1439
01:34:12,346 --> 01:34:14,974
<i>Bike, eat, drink, talk.</i>

1440
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:17,677
<i>Ride the subway,
read, read maps.</i>

1441
01:34:17,752 --> 01:34:19,413
<i>Make maps, make art.</i>

1442
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:20,954
<i>Finish the Gates application.</i>

1443
01:34:21,022 --> 01:34:22,956
<i>Tell my dad not
to stress about it.</i>

1444
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:25,185
<i>Hug my mom.
Kiss my little sister.</i>

1445
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:26,453
<i>Kiss my dad.</i>

1446
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:27,687
<i>Make out with Noelle.</i>

1447
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:29,326
<i>Make out with her more.</i>

1448
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:31,865
<i>Take her on a picnic.
See a movie with her.</i>

1449
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:34,400
<i>See a movie with Aaron.
Heck, see a movie with Nia.</i>

1450
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:38,635
<i>Have a party.
Tell people my story.
Volunteer at 3 North.</i>

1451
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:40,539
<i>Help people like Bobby.</i>

1452
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:42,336
<i>Like Muqtada.</i>

1453
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:44,541
<i>Like me.</i>

1454
01:34:44,612 --> 01:34:47,843
<i>Draw more. Draw a person.
Draw a naked person.</i>

1455
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:49,412
<i>Draw Noelle naked.</i>

1456
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:52,209
<i>Run, travel, swim, skip.</i>

1457
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:54,345
<i>Yeah, I know it's lame,
but, whatever.</i>

1458
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:55,753
<i>Skip anyway.</i>

1459
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:59,053
<i>Breathe.</i>

1460
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:08,893
<i>Live.</i>
