1
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:29,309
Over those years...

2
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:33,148
I wrote many novels on weird topics.

3
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:34,885
Everyone I met asked me.

4
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:38,755
"Did you get these ideas
from imagination? Or real experience?".

5
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:41,829
This is actually a silly question.

6
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:46,701
There are always happenings to people...

7
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:50,771
around you every day, and...

8
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:53,967
these can be concocted
into a strange story.

9
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:58,780
If you regularly drink with friends.

10
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:04,386
You can especially get out of them
good themes for an intriguing story.

11
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:06,215
Tonight, for instance,

12
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:08,017
I'm meeting two friends.

13
00:01:08,324 --> 00:01:10,189
- Wesley.
- Mr Yi.

14
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:11,753
How are you, where's Yuan Chen?

15
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:13,088
He's over there.

16
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,287
What a pair of beautiful
glasses you have.

17
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:15,857
Mr Yi.

18
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:17,523
Congratulations on winning
the titles of Miss Asia.

19
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:18,326
Thank you.

20
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:21,403
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

21
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:27,932
Yuan Chen, you had a darling adventure
with Wesley some time ago, didn't you?

22
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:30,012
Tell us about it.

23
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,343
Mr Yi is a good storyteller.

24
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:33,915
Let him tell it.

25
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:38,151
Thus a good story begins
with good wine...

26
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,589
Hound calling Thunderbird...

27
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:21,094
Are all units ready?

28
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:23,060
I'm Thunderbird. Inside are six bandits.

29
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:24,893
One of them is a sharpshooter.

30
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:26,831
They all carry heavy weapons.

31
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:28,403
Tell everyone to be alert.

32
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:32,065
Hound, are you all right?

33
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:45,387
Hound, how are you? Hound.

34
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:49,182
- Cease fire, at once!
- Listen!

35
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,991
You gunned down a hostage!

36
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:54,660
He's having a serious heart attack.

37
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:57,526
Send a doctor before he dies!

38
00:02:58,634 --> 00:03:00,101
The doctor's coming.

39
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:02,168
You've been surrounded.

40
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:05,738
You stand no chance of escape. Give up!

41
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,711
- What is it?
- Miss.

42
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:18,215
I'm a reporter of Western Daily.

43
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:20,015
Don't go in, it's dangerous.

44
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:21,554
Please keep away!

45
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:25,024
- Please, I only want to take one photo.
- No! I already said "No"!

46
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,322
What? Wonder Woman.

47
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:28,825
They won't let me in.

48
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,095
I'm Dr Yuan. Are you Captain Ho?

49
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:35,261
The hostage's inside.
He has heart attack.

50
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:36,738
Why have you chosen me?

51
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:39,273
We've long known your bravery.

52
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:42,206
We hope you could go in to plant a bomb.

53
00:03:42,378 --> 00:03:44,437
to help us save the hostages.

54
00:03:45,248 --> 00:03:46,510
I'm not too experienced.

55
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:49,150
- Inspector Chiang.
- Yes, sir!

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,882
Dr Yuan.

57
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,589
Let me play the nurse to follow you in
and I'll defuse it.

58
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,052
- Go and prepare everything!
- Yes.

59
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,415
The bomb's in a layer
of the first aid kit.

60
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,588
Well, okay?

61
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,685
Dr Yuan, remember it's 12 o'clock sharp.

62
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:33,692
We'll break in at this hour.

63
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:45,997
The doctor's here! Don't open fire!

64
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:19,601
Scatter!

65
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,972
Stop!

66
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:23,545
Bitch, stop!

67
00:05:23,746 --> 00:05:27,307
I'm female too. Go now.

68
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,080
Get going!

69
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:50,697
Sonny, don't play any tricks!

70
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:53,639
- Where's the patient?
- Stand up!

71
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:58,276
Go...

72
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:01,774
Give me the stethoscope.

73
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,619
Calm down, I'm the doctor.

74
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:33,977
The heart-stimulant injection.

75
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:39,716
What are you doing?

76
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,189
Boss, a gun!

77
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:49,324
Bastard, how dare you?

78
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:52,592
Start!

79
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,938
Halt!

80
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:25,025
- Who are you?
- I'm a reporter.

81
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:27,253
Don't you know nearly ruined us?

82
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:28,761
Sorry!

83
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:30,632
Where's my camera?
I want to take a few photos!

84
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,062
What?

85
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:34,296
Thank you, Dr Yuan.

86
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:36,098
We're now in control.

87
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:39,939
- Good, I'll leave now.
- Good, retreat.

88
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:47,639
Are you going to arrest me?

89
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:50,718
I've never met a
more fanatic girl than you.

90
00:08:50,886 --> 00:08:52,649
Don't you know
you could get a few years?

91
00:08:52,788 --> 00:08:54,653
- Well...
- Go now!

92
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,457
Thank you!

93
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:04,666
- Dr Yuan, thank you!
- Don't mention it!

94
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,960
Captain Ho!

95
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:08,832
We must thank you for your bravery.

96
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:11,232
Captain Ho!

97
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:20,546
Aren't you that sexology writer...

98
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:21,807
- Dr Chu?
- Danny Wong?

99
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:24,248
They say you've recently
written an essay

100
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,017
on the climate's effect
on male sex potential.

101
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:31,024
This is merely a ratio in mathematics.

102
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,628
The temperature and time
constitute a ratio.

103
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:37,562
The length is one hour in tropical South.

104
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:38,893
Half an hour in the central part.

105
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:43,732
About 2-3 minutes
in the low-temperature North.

106
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:46,670
I remember you come from South Sea.

107
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:49,640
According to your inference
I should've come from North Pole.

108
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,210
Impossible!

109
00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:58,246
Some beautiful girl over there.

110
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,878
Dr Chu, take the wine.

111
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:04,059
Leave her to me!

112
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:07,696
- Isn't it funny?
- Funny...

113
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,491
Don't you believe in stars?

114
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:11,497
I can readily see your star's Virgo.

115
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,258
Well, explain it.

116
00:10:13,435 --> 00:10:14,595
- Anne, let's sit over here.
- A Virgo girl's best mate...

117
00:10:14,737 --> 00:10:16,602
is a Taurus boy like me.

118
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:19,069
Your star must be Cancer.

119
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:20,640
I've many collections at home.

120
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:23,209
Including a human head
made by the New Guinea tribe.

121
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:25,471
It was shrunk to the size
of a monkey head.

122
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:27,408
So horrible!

123
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,111
And these are toes
chopped down by spacemen.

124
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:34,814
So nauseating! Anything else?

125
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,857
- And...
- Me! Adventurer Yuan Chen.

126
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:40,862
I have something important to tell you.

127
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:42,563
What are you up to?

128
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:46,730
Miss, don't be fooled by him.

129
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:50,134
Frankly, he's already married.

130
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:51,967
Don't talk nonsense!

131
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:55,335
I must go away for a while.

132
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:57,910
- Bye-bye!
- Anne...

133
00:10:58,414 --> 00:11:00,780
- Stay for a little while.
- What on earth are you up to?

134
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:02,648
Sorry...

135
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:04,252
for the intrusion.

136
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:06,614
but I need you on something important.

137
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:08,917
- What is it?
- Okey.

138
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:11,589
I'd like to feature you in Western Daily.

139
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:13,490
to introduce your heroic deeds.

140
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:15,323
Let me take a naked photo of yours.

141
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:20,502
I assure you it will
have a sense of beauty.

142
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,171
My technique's not bad. Believe me.

143
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:27,233
- Sorry, it's no concern of mine.
- Idiot.

144
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:42,624
Idiot.

145
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:47,292
- Stop!
- I don't care for you.

146
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:10,712
Idiot, I thought I couldn't keep up.

147
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:37,274
You're cheap, dirty.

148
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:39,209
and despicable.

149
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:45,675
I'm sorry.

150
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:47,572
You really scared me!

151
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,210
How can you get in?
Where's your servant?

152
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:52,715
I gave her $1,000.

153
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:55,016
And said you let her have a day off.

154
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,120
Oh! I see!

155
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:05,693
You're great!

156
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:54,546
- Yuan Chen.
- Who are you?

157
00:14:54,683 --> 00:14:56,446
Go with me to Thailand.

158
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,951
You must help yourself and Betsy.

159
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:00,247
What?

160
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:03,384
Your blood spell has reached one year.

161
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:05,250
You may soon have a relapse.

162
00:15:05,427 --> 00:15:07,895
And she's got ghost spell.

163
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,993
We need your help.

164
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,500
What are you talking about?

165
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:15,797
Stop acting.
Here's my address in Thailand.

166
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:17,303
I'll wait for three days.

167
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:20,670
Don't go away!

168
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:24,610
What's your name?

169
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:27,948
I'm Heh Lung.

170
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:31,884
Listen, keep away from sex.

171
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,988
or you may have a quick relapse.

172
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:42,522
Who's that guy? I'm so scared!

173
00:15:42,698 --> 00:15:45,360
That's all right, no problem.

174
00:16:42,824 --> 00:16:43,984
Mr Wei,

175
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:46,652
you're my best friend and master.

176
00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:48,921
Only you can help me.

177
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:51,859
Have you ever been
to the North of Thailand?

178
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:56,264
Su, bring us two cups of coffee, please.

179
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:57,429
Okay.

180
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,704
Apparently you've been under blood spell.

181
00:17:08,884 --> 00:17:10,852
Tell me how it happened.

182
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:14,953
One year ago, I went with.

183
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:17,621
a medical team to North Thailand.

184
00:17:18,427 --> 00:17:20,987
to get a kind of herbs for treating AIDS.

185
00:17:33,942 --> 00:17:35,409
- Morning!
- Morning!

186
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:41,342
- Morning!
- Morning!

187
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:45,951
Professor, I'd like
to take a walk over there.

188
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,387
Be careful,

189
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,455
it's near the Yunnan miao tribe.

190
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,019
They say a kind of worm tribe
specializes in witchcraft.

191
00:17:56,465 --> 00:18:00,026
I only believe in science.

192
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:27,176
Sorry for breaking your gem.

193
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:31,982
Never mind. Keep them.

194
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:33,755
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

195
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,490
I must leave.

196
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:51,710
Keep away from that girl.

197
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:54,177
Their tribe's cruel...

198
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:57,712
and knows witchcraft.

199
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:03,120
Professor, if they cast
a spell so easily.

200
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:05,690
They must nothing to do?

201
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:08,793
I'm the Captain,

202
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:12,923
it's my duty to protect you.

203
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:18,606
Sounds of the drum?

204
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:28,305
They come from the worm tribe
and signal offerings.

205
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:30,585
They're offering to God then.

206
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,154
Don't ever go and see it.

207
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:35,414
We won't...

208
00:20:56,978 --> 00:20:59,538
What a big procession!

209
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:12,755
Go over!

210
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:58,265
It's her!

211
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:00,532
Who?

212
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:03,269
- The girl I was talking about!
- Who...?

213
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:04,740
I don't know.

214
00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:12,278
Have you made up your mind?

215
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,183
I won't!

216
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,157
Probably you've been chosen for offering.

217
00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:22,659
When Old Ancestor wakes up, you'll die.

218
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:25,230
You deliberately sent Heh Lung away.

219
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,560
and picked me.

220
00:22:26,668 --> 00:22:28,727
I love only him.

221
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,633
I won't submit.

222
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,378
My people.

223
00:22:39,147 --> 00:22:43,413
As in previous years,
when Old Ancestor wakes up.

224
00:22:43,918 --> 00:22:47,581
Someone honored by God...

225
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:50,853
will be chosen.

226
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:52,242
Betsy is the daughter of the ex-Chief.

227
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,048
Please don't offer her to God.

228
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:55,484
This is the will of God.

229
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:58,284
But we've never tried.

230
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,024
Anyone else refusing to do it?

231
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:45,332
Send them to the grave.

232
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,082
I must go and help her.

233
00:25:00,188 --> 00:25:02,247
You must be mad!

234
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:03,686
You may get killed!

235
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:06,326
I'll be flexible. Bring weapons.

236
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:08,822
- Don't...
- Don't go!

237
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:11,892
What now?

238
00:27:24,165 --> 00:27:25,325
Run!

239
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:28,197
He's our Old Ancestor, he won't die.

240
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:33,337
Run! Leave me alone.

241
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:26,823
Help me...

242
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:37,933
Hurry up!

243
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:12,873
Run!

244
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:23,245
Intruders! Go and see.

245
00:29:29,624 --> 00:29:30,989
Sounds of the drum again!

246
00:29:31,492 --> 00:29:34,154
He's pursuing you for your intrusion!

247
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:36,089
Run!

248
00:29:44,972 --> 00:29:45,939
Professor.

249
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,108
You brought the mess
because you're naughty.

250
00:29:48,342 --> 00:29:50,003
Go back to the camp and pack up at once.

251
00:30:13,468 --> 00:30:14,833
Run! Run quick!

252
00:30:36,758 --> 00:30:39,625
Run, quickly!

253
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:43,621
Betsy! Betsy!

254
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:45,863
Run!

255
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:02,342
Get in!

256
00:32:00,174 --> 00:32:06,738
You've blasphemed Old Ancestor.

257
00:32:08,015 --> 00:32:13,976
I'll punish you on behalf of God.

258
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:06,604
Professor, you...

259
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:18,151
Yuan Chen, help me!

260
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:49,307
The worms are highly prolific.

261
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:55,387
But I won't use them against you.

262
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:16,690
I've let you down!

263
00:36:17,264 --> 00:36:24,136
Run! Don't let them
get hold of you. Run!

264
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:13,579
You...

265
00:37:22,363 --> 00:37:26,629
I'm now using my own charm to help you.

266
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,495
but...

267
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:41,505
When I woke up, Betsy had left.

268
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:44,413
And the bloodstains with me were gone.

269
00:37:44,618 --> 00:37:46,882
So I left alone.

270
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:57,097
I'd been well in Hong Kong for one year.

271
00:37:57,264 --> 00:37:59,027
But now...

272
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:01,734
Why didn't you take Heh Lung's advice?

273
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:03,731
I don't know him,

274
00:38:03,904 --> 00:38:05,872
and didn't know what he wanted.

275
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,470
Right!

276
00:38:10,778 --> 00:38:12,336
What are you...

277
00:38:13,614 --> 00:38:14,876
What are you doing? Yuan Chen.

278
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:16,983
Su, bring the first aid kit.

279
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:20,885
The 2nd blood curse has burst.

280
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:22,916
When did the first burst occur?

281
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,149
More or less the same time.

282
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,022
It means one burst every 24 hours.

283
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:32,027
When it spreads to the heart, you'll die.

284
00:38:34,935 --> 00:38:38,098
Mr Wei, you know witchcraft well.

285
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:39,933
Is there any chance of survival for me?

286
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:44,304
Blood curse is the most mysterious.

287
00:38:44,478 --> 00:38:46,036
And complex of its kind in witchcraft.

288
00:38:48,882 --> 00:38:51,146
Betsy used a spell to protect you.

289
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:53,183
But it worked for one year only.

290
00:38:55,522 --> 00:38:57,888
That's why Heh Lung
wants you to go to Thailand.

291
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:00,657
You want me to go there then?

292
00:39:01,362 --> 00:39:04,729
Yes, only the doer
can undo a damage done.

293
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,066
Okay, I'll see Heh Lung tomorrow morning.

294
00:39:09,236 --> 00:39:13,297
Give me the scoop on this!

295
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,407
You again?

296
00:39:14,508 --> 00:39:17,875
Cousin, do you know him well?

297
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:19,036
Mr Wei.

298
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:23,172
Tsai-hung is Mr Wei's spoiled cousin.

299
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,612
Please don't blame her.

300
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:26,117
You really are meddlesome.

301
00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:27,311
I know him well.

302
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:29,785
Yuen Chen,

303
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:31,591
I don't want you to take my naked photo.

304
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:33,555
Let me go with you to Thailand. Okay?

305
00:39:33,627 --> 00:39:35,288
I'm not going there for pleasure.

306
00:39:35,396 --> 00:39:38,763
It's a serious affair. You can't go!

307
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:40,194
You mean I'm not qualified.

308
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:43,666
I went through everything with Dr Yuan!

309
00:39:43,804 --> 00:39:44,964
Is it true?

310
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:46,733
I won't let you follow me.

311
00:39:48,142 --> 00:39:51,771
I'll rush to help you
the day after tomorrow.

312
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:53,713
Call the Thai police if anything happens.

313
00:39:53,914 --> 00:39:55,176
I'll get in touch with them.

314
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:57,416
Thank you.
Don't mention it!

315
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:59,848
Cousin, aren't you going to help me?

316
00:40:00,654 --> 00:40:02,212
A reporter mustn't
go too far in coverage.

317
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:04,324
This is a matter of life and death.

318
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:08,490
You're only in for kicks. Stay out of it.

319
00:40:20,774 --> 00:40:22,332
Mr Yuan Chen.

320
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:23,740
I'm here!

321
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:26,573
- Please follow me.
- You're...?

322
00:40:26,747 --> 00:40:29,511
My boss told me to pick you up!

323
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:48,802
Your boss?

324
00:40:48,936 --> 00:40:51,200
Mr Yuan, please sit down for a while.
Thank you!

325
00:41:27,274 --> 00:41:29,538
- Idiot!
- You again!

326
00:41:29,743 --> 00:41:32,109
I came on the earlier flight.

327
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,947
Why so many weapons here?

328
00:41:35,048 --> 00:41:37,016
We're entering a primitive jungle!

329
00:41:37,184 --> 00:41:39,345
It's unsafe without them.

330
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:42,822
This is the latest laser-guided gun.

331
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,017
Can you afford it?

332
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:50,387
My daddy's Tung Tai-ping.

333
00:41:50,964 --> 00:41:52,932
Property magnate Tung Tai-ping?

334
00:41:53,133 --> 00:41:55,397
I couldn't care less.

335
00:41:55,502 --> 00:41:56,264
But he's given me...

336
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:58,767
a Gold Card for an unlimited sum.

337
00:41:59,273 --> 00:42:03,334
Beautiful, ignorant, young, hell-bent...

338
00:42:03,644 --> 00:42:04,702
And rich.

339
00:42:04,912 --> 00:42:07,176
That makes you the most troublesome girl.

340
00:42:07,548 --> 00:42:10,312
I always pay for info
out of my own pockets.

341
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:12,413
We're not going to war.

342
00:42:12,553 --> 00:42:15,716
And these can't overcome witchcraft.

343
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:18,557
Let's get back to business.

344
00:42:19,593 --> 00:42:21,458
I've already made
a promise to the editor.

345
00:42:21,628 --> 00:42:22,890
And got in touch with the United Press.

346
00:42:23,063 --> 00:42:26,624
If your info can be
front-paged in world newspapers...

347
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:28,496
I'll split the profit with you.

348
00:42:29,136 --> 00:42:30,797
I'm in no mood for your frenzied ideas.

349
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:32,164
I don't care,

350
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:33,671
I'll go anyway.

351
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:35,206
Are you going to tie me up?

352
00:42:38,145 --> 00:42:40,010
Let me go!

353
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:43,914
Don't ever underrate a man!

354
00:43:35,602 --> 00:43:37,467
You've come at last.

355
00:43:38,772 --> 00:43:40,239
You seem...

356
00:43:40,374 --> 00:43:42,239
I was being pursued immediately returned.

357
00:43:45,045 --> 00:43:46,512
Who did?

358
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,041
The sorcerer.
Knowing I'm here to see you.

359
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:53,175
He conspired with
the underworld against us.

360
00:43:53,353 --> 00:43:54,911
So they're all of a kind.

361
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:58,821
I was assaulted immediately I returned.

362
00:43:59,293 --> 00:44:00,658
Let's leave at once!

363
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,522
- Is this the worm tribe?
- No,

364
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:12,494
a good tribe working as farmers.

365
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,930
But they're often
attacked by the worm tribe.

366
00:45:23,343 --> 00:45:25,504
Lung, it's nice to see you back.

367
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:27,544
Chief, what happened?

368
00:45:27,748 --> 00:45:29,511
An eerie affair occurred here.

369
00:45:29,716 --> 00:45:34,176
All the children here
disappeared this afternoon.

370
00:45:34,354 --> 00:45:35,821
- Disappeared?
- Yes.

371
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:38,825
What happened?

372
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:41,223
Our children have
mysteriously disappeared.

373
00:45:41,328 --> 00:45:42,886
The sorcerer must've abducted them.

374
00:45:43,063 --> 00:45:44,325
For casting "Little Ghost spell"?

375
00:45:44,498 --> 00:45:47,058
Yes! It's made of 100 children's blood.

376
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,760
They can fly, suck blood and kill.

377
00:45:49,903 --> 00:45:53,361
The spell has to be
remade after three years.

378
00:45:53,507 --> 00:45:55,475
How cruel he is!

379
00:45:55,842 --> 00:45:59,005
Right, I saw that
little ghost that night.

380
00:45:59,513 --> 00:46:01,572
The Chief wants me to bring men.

381
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:04,479
- to save them.
- Good!

382
00:46:04,551 --> 00:46:05,813
I'm going too.

383
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,237
What a quiet night!
Right!

384
00:46:25,372 --> 00:46:27,840
Not even chirps! Something wrong!

385
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:29,201
Watch out!

386
00:46:52,265 --> 00:46:53,129
Run quickly...

387
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:55,801
Don't run!
Don't run! Come back at once!

388
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:13,081
It hurts!

389
00:47:14,855 --> 00:47:17,722
I warned you against following us!

390
00:47:17,824 --> 00:47:23,057
I've already followed you all the way!

391
00:47:26,032 --> 00:47:28,592
Don't you know it's booby-trapped here?

392
00:47:28,735 --> 00:47:31,898
Don't worry! When I studied in U.S.A...

393
00:47:32,105 --> 00:47:35,074
I read many books
on the Vietcong tactics.

394
00:47:48,321 --> 00:47:51,779
This shows I can take care of myself.

395
00:47:52,526 --> 00:47:55,188
No more nonsense!
We must work against time.

396
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,235
Let me go up and see. Hush!

397
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:10,510
Tsai-hung, Where are you going?

398
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:11,474
To take photos.

399
00:48:11,611 --> 00:48:14,637
I'm now responsible for your safety.

400
00:48:14,848 --> 00:48:16,816
It's dangerous, don't run wild.

401
00:48:17,017 --> 00:48:19,178
I don't care! What a male chauvinist!

402
00:48:19,352 --> 00:48:20,910
Tsai-hung, please take my advice.

403
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:22,784
It really is dangerous.
I've experienced it.

404
00:48:22,923 --> 00:48:24,788
Things are sometimes beyond your control.

405
00:48:25,192 --> 00:48:26,750
Let go!

406
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,121
I warn you, if you touch me again.

407
00:48:29,296 --> 00:48:31,264
I'll tell my cousin that you molested me.

408
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:35,496
though with your reputation.

409
00:48:35,635 --> 00:48:39,002
few people will believe that.

410
00:48:39,172 --> 00:48:39,934
I don't care.

411
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,004
Take my advice.

412
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:44,006
Or I'll spank you without pants.

413
00:48:44,277 --> 00:48:45,437
How dare you?

414
00:48:46,813 --> 00:48:48,280
You're dirty!

415
00:48:48,582 --> 00:48:49,640
So what?

416
00:48:49,749 --> 00:48:51,410
I don't care.

417
00:48:51,585 --> 00:48:53,450
I'll leave and won't return.

418
00:48:53,587 --> 00:48:54,849
Okay, it's up to you.

419
00:48:55,021 --> 00:48:56,283
I won't return.

420
00:48:56,456 --> 00:48:58,321
even if I were bitten by snakes.

421
00:48:58,491 --> 00:49:00,550
hit by arrows or...

422
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,526
I won't care for you anymore.
Don't regret.

423
00:49:08,134 --> 00:49:09,601
You really have the nerve!

424
00:49:12,572 --> 00:49:13,937
Bye-bye!

425
00:49:21,414 --> 00:49:23,177
So she's away in a twinkle.

426
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:28,452
The children are all caged and guarded.

427
00:49:28,588 --> 00:49:30,954
We'd better go and save Betsy.
Okay!

428
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:33,452
Where's Miss Tsai-hung?

429
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:37,263
She left in a fit of temper.

430
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:40,026
Never mind her. Where's Betsy?

431
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:48,006
Betsy!

432
00:49:48,608 --> 00:49:49,870
Heh Lung.

433
00:49:51,578 --> 00:49:53,136
I've brought Dr Yuan too.

434
00:49:54,214 --> 00:49:55,272
I'm here.

435
00:49:55,382 --> 00:49:56,542
Betsy!
Keep away.

436
00:49:56,716 --> 00:49:59,184
Don't let anyone
see me in my present state.

437
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:04,078
Forget it! Her looks scared me!

438
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:09,523
Betsy,

439
00:50:09,729 --> 00:50:12,095
my 4th blood curse has burst.

440
00:50:12,265 --> 00:50:15,723
Something must be done
to save you and me.

441
00:50:16,636 --> 00:50:19,400
My dad told me before his death.

442
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:24,067
Some holy ashes can break
all kinds of spell.

443
00:50:24,711 --> 00:50:29,239
I consulted the records of the tribe.

444
00:50:29,382 --> 00:50:31,543
And have found their hiding place.

445
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:32,615
Where?

446
00:50:32,786 --> 00:50:35,050
A large Buddha in a cave.
It's out of reach.

447
00:50:35,155 --> 00:50:37,214
And no one can climb up for it.

448
00:50:38,158 --> 00:50:39,625
So they're unobtainable.

449
00:50:39,859 --> 00:50:42,521
I believe you're my saviour from Heaven.

450
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:45,197
So I've told Heh Lung to find you.

451
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:49,868
Try.

452
00:50:50,103 --> 00:50:53,266
You must, you only have
three days to live.

453
00:50:55,008 --> 00:50:57,476
I go to inform them
to bring all the equipment.

454
00:50:57,644 --> 00:50:59,908
Besides, the ashes
will wither in six hours.

455
00:51:00,046 --> 00:51:01,604
You must fight for time.

456
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:07,810
Help! What are you doing? Let me down!

457
00:51:08,254 --> 00:51:10,916
I'll pay you! Let me go!

458
00:51:14,327 --> 00:51:15,794
Let me go!

459
00:51:18,131 --> 00:51:19,598
Let her go!

460
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:24,234
You must be his boss!

461
00:51:24,437 --> 00:51:25,699
You're really nice.

462
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,000
Excuse me. Bye-bye!

463
00:51:32,345 --> 00:51:37,510
I lost my way and fell into the trap.

464
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:40,615
Did Heh Lung bring you here?

465
00:51:41,521 --> 00:51:46,891
No, I'm here to collect specimens.

466
00:51:47,027 --> 00:51:51,191
You look brave,
let me take a photo of you.

467
00:51:51,364 --> 00:51:52,422
Go to hell!

468
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:05,110
Okay, I know.

469
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:14,587
Men and equipment are coming soon.

470
00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:16,016
Tsai-hung haven't come back yet.

471
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:17,852
Why don't see her so late?

472
00:52:18,024 --> 00:52:19,491
Where's she going?

473
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:23,459
She may either be dead or captured.

474
00:52:25,598 --> 00:52:28,260
Where could she be, if captured?

475
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:29,198
A foreigner like her...

476
00:52:29,302 --> 00:52:31,463
would be taken to the sorcerer.

477
00:52:37,343 --> 00:52:38,901
Rescue Betsy first!

478
00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:41,342
Rescue Tsai-hung!

479
00:52:42,615 --> 00:52:43,980
A good friend.

480
00:55:29,649 --> 00:55:30,911
Miss Tsai-hung.

481
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:57,309
Well, is Tsai-hung all right?

482
00:55:57,944 --> 00:56:01,311
Her temperature's a bit abnormal.

483
00:56:03,216 --> 00:56:05,081
Let me go and see
if any men have arrived.

484
00:56:17,664 --> 00:56:18,722
Tsai-hung.

485
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:46,822
What is it?

486
00:56:46,993 --> 00:56:49,154
She goes berserk and is herculean.

487
00:57:06,312 --> 00:57:09,372
Tsai-hung... how do you feel?

488
00:57:19,225 --> 00:57:20,692
Get hold of her.

489
00:57:38,244 --> 00:57:39,711
What bas become of her?

490
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:42,314
She had been captured by the Chief.

491
00:57:42,448 --> 00:57:44,416
And was in such a state
when we brought her back.

492
00:57:45,151 --> 00:57:47,711
I think she must be under "black" spell.

493
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,983
She kills anyone at sight.

494
00:57:51,257 --> 00:57:54,021
How can we break the spell for her?

495
00:57:54,894 --> 00:57:56,259
Let me!

496
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,090
Betsy?

497
00:58:04,404 --> 00:58:06,565
Black is needed to break a black spell.

498
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:08,206
Mix the blood...

499
00:58:08,374 --> 00:58:10,035
of black sheep, oxen...

500
00:58:10,176 --> 00:58:14,340
dogs, cats, snakes, eagles and lizards.

501
00:58:14,514 --> 00:58:18,473
Boil it and bathe her with it.

502
00:58:18,851 --> 00:58:20,512
Immerse her till she wakes up.

503
00:59:00,726 --> 00:59:02,193
Ghost!

504
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:09,301
What happened...?

505
00:59:10,837 --> 00:59:12,395
She was scared by my sight.

506
00:59:12,972 --> 00:59:14,337
It's all right...

507
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,901
That sorcerer brought her this.

508
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:19,511
She saved your life.

509
00:59:20,112 --> 00:59:21,670
She's all right now.

510
00:59:22,181 --> 00:59:23,944
Time's running out.

511
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:25,744
Go and get the ashes.

512
00:59:30,189 --> 00:59:31,156
Heh Lung.

513
00:59:31,891 --> 00:59:35,349
Come back by every means.

514
00:59:37,163 --> 00:59:38,824
I'll go with you.

515
00:59:38,931 --> 00:59:40,694
Tsai-hung, don't be naughty.

516
00:59:41,334 --> 00:59:43,495
You must return by all means.

517
00:59:53,145 --> 00:59:54,203
What happened?

518
00:59:54,347 --> 00:59:58,408
Mr Wei, my 6th blood curse has burst.

519
00:59:58,818 --> 01:00:00,479
But there was not much bleeding.

520
01:00:01,921 --> 01:00:03,786
When your 7th blood curse bursts.

521
01:00:04,056 --> 01:00:06,923
All your blood will spill out.

522
01:00:09,795 --> 01:00:13,754
Mr Wei, tomorrow's
my last day in the world.

523
01:00:15,201 --> 01:00:16,259
Yuan Chen,

524
01:00:16,335 --> 01:00:19,202
I don't believe in fate.

525
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:21,033
I think man conquers Heaven.

526
01:00:21,374 --> 01:00:22,534
Heh Lung.

527
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:24,035
What's the name of that sorcerer?

528
01:00:24,243 --> 01:00:25,801
Sorcerer Aquala.

529
01:00:26,712 --> 01:00:29,875
Aquala? The witchcraft of this clan is...

530
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:33,507
the most mysterious
and cruel in the South.

531
01:00:33,853 --> 01:00:35,013
Did he practice Little Ghost spell?

532
01:00:35,154 --> 01:00:36,212
Yes.

533
01:00:36,389 --> 01:00:38,357
Get a pregnant cow at once.

534
01:00:38,558 --> 01:00:40,423
Slaughter it and get her placenta out.

535
01:00:40,526 --> 01:00:42,391
Also, kill a black dog and get its blood.

536
01:00:42,528 --> 01:00:43,688
Okay.

537
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:46,093
Why, Mr Wei?

538
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:49,033
To break the Little Ghost spell.

539
01:00:49,201 --> 01:00:51,965
A friend of the Aquala clan
taught me that.

540
01:00:52,104 --> 01:00:53,571
I'm not sure if it will work.

541
01:00:55,107 --> 01:00:57,769
Yuan Chen, it's all up to you.

542
01:00:58,844 --> 01:01:02,803
Old Ancestor...! Give me strength.

543
01:01:02,982 --> 01:01:07,146
Use blood strength
to turn into blood ghosts.

544
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:14,857
Kill Yuan Chen first.

545
01:02:05,378 --> 01:02:07,141
Where are those two grains of ashes?

546
01:02:07,713 --> 01:02:09,180
Inside the eyes.

547
01:02:14,387 --> 01:02:17,049
We must climb up slowly. Okay with you?

548
01:02:17,256 --> 01:02:19,622
I've even climbed the Himalayas.

549
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:33,835
They say no one
trying it has ever come out.

550
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,707
It all depends on us!

551
01:02:54,126 --> 01:02:55,388
Watch out!

552
01:02:57,797 --> 01:02:58,957
Be careful!

553
01:04:59,118 --> 01:05:00,983
Yuan Chen.

554
01:05:20,372 --> 01:05:21,930
Masters.

555
01:05:23,509 --> 01:05:26,478
We try to get them to help someone only.

556
01:05:26,612 --> 01:05:29,479
Please do us a favor, masters.

557
01:07:10,449 --> 01:07:11,711
Run, quick!

558
01:07:31,737 --> 01:07:33,204
Duck it!

559
01:07:46,085 --> 01:07:51,853
Yuan Chen...

560
01:08:23,756 --> 01:08:26,520
Swallow it now to break the blood spell.

561
01:08:37,603 --> 01:08:38,865
Swallow it at once!

562
01:08:46,745 --> 01:08:48,110
We must rush back in two hours.

563
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51,044
Or the other grain
will become ineffective.

564
01:09:23,582 --> 01:09:26,574
Go and rescue Tsai-hung and Betsy.

565
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:30,186
I'll join you later. Go now.

566
01:09:46,071 --> 01:09:48,539
Old Ancestor must be delighted today.

567
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,905
To have three man
and three girls for food.

568
01:09:52,244 --> 01:09:53,905
God will punish you.

569
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:56,247
Yuan Chen will come to kill you!

570
01:09:59,318 --> 01:10:01,980
I'm waiting for them.

571
01:10:02,621 --> 01:10:04,088
We're already here.

572
01:10:08,227 --> 01:10:09,888
I said he would come.

573
01:10:12,631 --> 01:10:16,294
Old Ancestor!

574
01:10:19,304 --> 01:10:23,570
Aquala, you did many atrocities.

575
01:10:23,775 --> 01:10:26,141
I'll make you pay for them now.

576
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:36,988
Old Ancestor!

577
01:10:43,762 --> 01:10:44,922
Let's go!

578
01:10:54,306 --> 01:10:55,671
Watch out!

579
01:11:58,437 --> 01:11:59,802
Tsai-hung.

580
01:12:38,644 --> 01:12:40,009
Heh Lung!

581
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,225
Let loose the little ghosts.

582
01:15:46,264 --> 01:15:47,629
Where's that grain?

583
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:49,293
Over here!

584
01:15:52,237 --> 01:15:54,705
Bad, already outdated.

585
01:15:57,108 --> 01:15:59,975
Betsy can't restore
her original looks then?

586
01:16:08,887 --> 01:16:12,880
Would you love me
if I look like this all my life?

587
01:16:16,328 --> 01:16:20,992
Our tribes can lead a new life now
with the sorcerer's death.

588
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:25,568
I can help them live better.

589
01:16:27,205 --> 01:16:28,467
Isn't that a pity?

590
01:16:28,673 --> 01:16:33,133
Beauty lies in one's heart,
not in one's face.
