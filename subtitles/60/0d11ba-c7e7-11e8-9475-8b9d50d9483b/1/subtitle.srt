1
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,309
'If anyone finds this,

2
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,836
it means my plan...

3
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,990
didn't work...

4
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,719
and I'm already dead.

5
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,234
- Evan?
- I think he's in here.

6
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,992
But if I can somehow

7
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,719
go back to the beginning

8
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,553
- all of this, I might be able
- Evan!

9
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,555
To save her.'

10
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,676
Evan!

11
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,316
Evan!

12
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,157
We're gonna be
late again.

13
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,312
When did you ever care
about getting to school on time?

14
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,755
We're putting up pictures
for parents' night.

15
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,400
Don't worry,
you'll have plenty of time.

16
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,112
Is Dad gonna come?

17
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,952
You know the answer to that.

18
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,315
Can't he just
come out for one day?

19
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,277
We've been over this 100 times.

20
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,952
It's too dangerous for him.

21
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,110
But Lenny said
his dad's coming,

22
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,031
and Tommy
and Kayleigh's dad...

23
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,588
Okay, I get the point.

24
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,511
But I'm not so bad, am I?

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,192
No.

26
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,474
Okay, have a great day.

27
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,755
I love you.
I'll pick you up later. Gotta go.

28
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,358
Bye.

29
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,797
Bye!

30
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,997
Mrs Treborn, I need
to speak with you.

31
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,275
Can it wait till tonight?
I'm late for work and...

32
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,874
I think you really
need to see this.

33
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,676
Tommy, leave Lenny alone.

34
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,830
Don't make me send you
to Mr Voytek's office.

35
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,192
I was gonna show this
to the principal,

36
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,998
but I thought I should
talk to you first.

37
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,195
What is it?

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,191
Yesterday I had all the children
make drawings

39
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,032
of what they wanted to be
when they grew up.

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,395
Most of them made drawings
of what their parents did.

41
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,072
But this...

42
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,435
I don't understand.

43
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,476
Evan did this?

44
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,432
- Can I keep this drawing?
- Oh, of course.

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,317
Um, there is one more thing,
Mrs Treborn,

46
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,358
- I feel bad even mentioning.
- What?

47
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,237
When I asked Evan
about the drawing,

48
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,835
well, he couldn't
remember doing it.

49
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,915
I don't wanna go.

50
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,435
I don't like this place, Mum.

51
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,351
I think it's creepy.

52
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,795
I promise I won't
make any bad pictures.

53
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,075
You're gonna be fine, okay?

54
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,549
He just wants to do
a couple tests, that's all.

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,756
- Oh.
- You'll like him.

56
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,474
That's good.
You're doing great.

57
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,552
Just tell me he hasn't inherited
his father's illness.

58
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,915
I'm sure the test results
will come back negative.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,514
But there's something else you can do
to monitor his memory.

60
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,239
- Anything.
- A journal.

61
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,595
Just have him write down
everything that he does.

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,319
- And what will that do?
- It could help jog his memory.

63
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,073
See if he remembers
anything new the next day.

64
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,469
These test results
will come back in a few days

65
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,551
- and we'll take it from there.
- Okay.

66
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,997
'Today Mummy is taking me
to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.

67
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,992
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

68
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,870
Great, see you soon.

69
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,835
Evan...

70
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,832
Evan, what are you doing
with that knife?

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,797
What happened?

72
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,030
Honey...

73
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,236
what were you doing
with that knife?

74
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,993
I don't remember.

75
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,394
- Hey, Andrea.
- George.

76
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,436
Hello, little man.

77
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,556
Watch your step.

78
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,193
Thanks, George.

79
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,999
- Not a problem.
- Here's my number at the hospital

80
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,718
in case there are any problems.

81
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,155
And please keep
an eye on him 'cause...

82
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,639
What, are you kidding?

83
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,915
We're going to have
a great time today, right, sport?

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,434
Okay, be good, kiddo.

85
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,794
I love you.

86
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,233
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, George.

87
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,471
Go long. Go on.
Right in the backyard.

88
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,879
Here it comes.

89
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,789
Evan, Evan, guess what?
Dad got a new video camera

90
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,677
and we're all going
to be in a movie.

91
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,716
That's right, Evan.

92
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,997
And you get to be the star.

93
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,593
I thought I was the star.

94
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,874
Hey, what did I tell you?

95
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,918
Now, Evan...

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,195
You have to promise

97
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,750
your bestest,
super-duper promise

98
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,035
that this will be
our little secret.

99
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,192
- You think you can do that?
- Um-hmm.

100
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,633
I'm r...

101
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,278
Where am I?

102
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,998
Where did we all go?

103
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,957
Calm down, kid, stand still.

104
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,678
I was just somewhere else.

105
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,193
How did I get here?

106
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,238
Quit acting like some damn retard,
or I'll call your mother

107
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,198
and tell her what a naughty
little shit you've been.

108
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,593
Kayleigh...

109
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,716
Kayleigh...

110
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,075
what happened?

111
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,319
The good news is
the results are negative.

112
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,231
I found no evidence of lesions,

113
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,594
haemorrhaging, tumours.

114
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,910
But you must have
something you can go on.

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,798
If I was to guess, I'd say
the blackouts are stress related.

116
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,836
But he's seven years old.

117
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,434
What kind of stress
can a seven-year-old have?

118
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,273
Plenty. Maybe he has
severe coping problems

119
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,918
about not having a father.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,150
You said the last time
the blackouts occurred

121
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,992
he was visiting
his friend's dad.

122
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,150
Well, he has been pushing me
to meet his father

123
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,550
- and I've been putting it off.
- It's worth a shot, Andrea.

124
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,790
We can arrange
a controlled meeting.

125
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,156
A careful dose of sedatives
for Jason, some security,

126
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,151
Evan comes in
for a quick visit,

127
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,798
and with a little luck,

128
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,189
no more
missing father complex.

129
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,871
'April 15th.

130
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,996
Today I get to meet my father.

131
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,878
His name is Jason
and he's crazy.

132
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,110
I hope he lets me
call him Dad.'

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,911
You mean Dad lives here?

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,877
Not in this wing, actually, no.

135
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,757
Now if your dad seems
a little sleepy,

136
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,910
it's because
of the medicine, okay?

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,228
Okay.

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,831
It'll just be a moment, okay?

139
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,950
It's okay. I won't bite.

140
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,635
You've seen pictures
of me, right?

141
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,757
Uh-huh. Mum says
I have your smile

142
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,149
and your hair.

143
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,839
Nooo!

144
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,910
He has to die!
It's the only way!

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,389
Jason, stop!

146
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,879
No!

147
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,514
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be alright.

148
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,353
He's hurt bad.
Get a stretcher.

149
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,716
- Come on, let's get him out of here.
- I'm so sorry.

150
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,030
In sure and certain hope

151
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,429
of the resurrection
to eternal life,

152
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,512
we commend to almighty God,
our brother Jason.

153
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,875
The Lord bless him
and keep him,

154
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,599
the Lord make his face
to shine upon him,

155
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,796
and be gracious unto him

156
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,713
and give him peace. Amen.

157
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,199
Come on, where is it?
Damn, I know it's down here somewhere.

158
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,635
Tommy, I'm bored shitless
over here. What's up already?

159
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,551
Yeah, what are you
looking for, anyway?

160
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,757
Shut up, lard arse. And you,
hold your fucking horses.

161
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,831
You know,
it's here somewhere.

162
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,036
We should go soon.

163
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,680
If dad catches us smoking
down here, we're dead.

164
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,035
So let's go.

165
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,718
I knew Dad had
a blockbuster down here!

166
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,677
Let's blow the shit
out of something.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,991
Here you go, buddy.

168
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,559
What? No freaking way.

169
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,438
- I'm not touching this thing.
- The hell you aren't.

170
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,159
Any of us does it and you're gonna
puss out and nark for sure.

171
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,879
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.
Look how small this fuse is.

172
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,269
- I'll get killed.
- Not necessarily.

173
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,476
There you go.

174
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,915
It should buy you
two minutes at least.

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,513
Gee thanks, friend.

176
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,954
Aw, for Christ's sake,
Lenny, you moron, just do it.

177
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,272
- Thanks.
- You got balls, man.

178
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,191
Shit took you long enough.

179
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,798
What the hell? Come on!

180
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,757
Evan, come on.
Help me get him up!

181
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,990
Evan, get your arse back here
and help me get him up.

182
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,672
What the hell happened?
Where are we?

183
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,671
Oh my God.
What did we do?

184
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,228
Evan, come on. Help me.

185
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,390
Oh my God, how could we?

186
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,948
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit, Lenny, what happened to you?

187
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,632
He's fine.
He's gonna be okay.

188
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,472
Everything's gonna be fine.

189
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,676
What's wrong with him?
Why isn't he speaking?

190
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,478
He's in shock, ma'am.

191
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,391
What is it?
What happened?

192
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,471
We were just in the woods
building a fort

193
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,676
when Lenny freaked out.
One minute he was okay,

194
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,876
and then he just froze up.
Right, guys?

195
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,155
What happened, Evan?
The truth.

196
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,196
I don't know.
I don't remember.

197
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,238
Something must have happened.
Something set him off.

198
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,515
I blacked it out.

199
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,433
Don't try to use your blackouts
to get out of this one.

200
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,917
You're not making it up?

201
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,317
Breathe in and breathe out.

202
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,992
And relax.

203
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,117
You are completely asleep.

204
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,758
Relaxed.

205
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,638
I want you to take me
to the time

206
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,995
you were in the woods
with Lenny.

207
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,275
Think of it like a movie.

208
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,715
You can pause, rewind,

209
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,110
or slow down
any details you wish.

210
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,509
Understand?

211
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,073
Yes.

212
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,071
Where are you now?

213
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,431
I'm standing next to Kayleigh.

214
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,954
My hands are over her ears.

215
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,553
Are you hurting her?

216
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,359
No, I'm protecting her.

217
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,351
Okay.

218
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,228
Now let's move forward in time.
What do you see?

219
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,516
I see a car.

220
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,072
Yes, Evan,
tell me about the car.

221
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,997
Go on.

222
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,355
Nothing can hurt you.

223
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,509
Remember, it's only a movie.
You are completely safe.

224
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,909
I can't...

225
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,956
The car vanishes
and all of a sudden

226
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,837
I'm on the ground
in the woods.

227
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,239
The car doesn't vanish, Evan.

228
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,232
The movie in your head
is broken, that's all.

229
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,311
Now tell me about the car.

230
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,913
I can't!

231
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,355
It's coming...

232
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,396
Fight it, Evan, hurry.

233
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,311
It's coming!

234
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,231
- Oh my God!
- On the count of 10,

235
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,039
- you'll wake up feeling refreshed...
- What are you doing?

236
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,588
...and remembering everything
that we talked about.

237
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,079
What is happening?
Make it stop!

238
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,709
One, you're feeling awake. Two,
your eyes are not feeling as heavy.

239
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,074
- Five, six.
- Wake up!

240
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,993
- Come on, Evan, wake up! Nine, 10.
- Wake up!

241
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,916
Oh God.

242
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,512
What happened?

243
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,953
Did it work?

244
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,996
Alright, thanks, Mum.
See you later.

245
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,192
Wipe that sad-arse look
off your face

246
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,918
before you get us busted.

247
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,150
Did you see the way Evan's mum
was looking at you?

248
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,992
Sorry.

249
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,517
Alright, will someone
tell me already

250
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,397
what the hell happened
with the mailbox?

251
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,956
Don't you ever
bring that shit up again.

252
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,110
Not ever!

253
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,431
Let's go.

254
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,958
Are you okay?

255
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,958
Holy shit!

256
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,917
Look at that fat fuck!

257
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,070
He's got bigger titties
than Lenny's mum.

258
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,958
- Shhh!
- Shut up, faggot.

259
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,395
No one's talking to you.

260
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,514
I'm sorry, Kayleigh,
this was a bad idea.

261
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,797
You really don't remember
anything that happened?

262
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,033
You're so lucky.

263
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,758
Look, everything's
gonna be okay.

264
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,877
Lenny'll be fine. You'll see.

265
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,633
Sorry.

266
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,870
It's not your fault.
Mrs Kagan called Dad

267
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,712
and blamed us
for what happened to Lenny.

268
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,791
Your dad did that?

269
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,634
- I deserve a lot worse.
- What are you talking about?

270
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,756
What you deserve is
a better father and brother.

271
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,070
All they do is
make you feel like shit.

272
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,154
You really have no clue
how beautiful you are, do you?

273
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,990
What the fuck are you doing?!

274
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,674
Buying popcorn.
What the fuck are you doing?

275
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,877
- Whoops.
- I can't believe you freaking did that.

276
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,997
- He's a little punk.
- Why are you being such a dick?

277
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,916
I can't believe
what you just did.

278
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,432
Stop it!

279
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,839
Stop hitting him.

280
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,797
What's wrong with you?

281
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,075
Somebody, please help us.

282
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,879
Alright, that's it, kid.
You're out of here.

283
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,873
Get him away! Get him away!

284
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,236
Now in another story,
the peaceful town of Briarville

285
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,912
was rocked this afternoon

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,389
in the wake of a horrible
act of vandalism.

287
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,948
While police officials
in upstate New York believe

288
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,679
this was a simple act
of criminal mischief gone awry,

289
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,832
the tragedy has clearly
devastated the community.

290
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,356
Now this was the grisly aftermath
of a powerful explosion

291
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,876
believed to have been caused
by an unknown quantity of dynamite.

292
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,714
The police have no leads,
no suspects and no motive...

293
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,358
Good night.

294
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,716
We're moving.

295
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,790
I can't believe
Tommy's still pissed at me.

296
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,110
He knows
I'm moving away, right?

297
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,509
He's been acting
real strange lately.

298
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,068
He won't even look me
in the eyes anymore.

299
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,991
Duck, here they come!

300
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,273
Did your mum say
if Lenny was okay?

301
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,316
He must be. I mean,
they're letting him out, right?

302
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,753
Welcome home.

303
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,308
I thought you might like
some fresh air for a change.

304
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,359
- Is Tommy with you guys?
- No. It's cool.

305
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,037
So, what'd you do in there?

306
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,315
It was awful.
You can't sleep because

307
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,391
everybody's screaming
all night long.

308
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,031
I never want to go back.

309
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,473
Do you see that?

310
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,516
Yeah, what's up
with the smoke?

311
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,671
Crockett!

312
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,352
What are you doing
with my dog?!

313
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,799
- Look what you made me do!
- What the hell's wrong with you?!

314
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,270
Kayleigh. Oh, God, come on,
please wake up.

315
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,954
Wake up, please!
Wake up!

316
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,679
Why don't you fucking kiss her,
Prince Charming?

317
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,549
Ow.

318
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,116
How long was I out?

319
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,392
Kayleigh, what's wrong?

320
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,274
Oh shit.

321
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,150
I'm sorry.

322
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,632
Aced it.

323
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,075
And time.
Put your pencils down

324
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,436
and place your bluebooks
on my desk before you leave.

325
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,115
You too, Mr Nelson. We're all
in the same time-zone, here.

326
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,952
So how'd you do, Evan?

327
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,600
I don't know. I might have got
some of the stories mixed up.

328
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,911
Was it Pavlov that conditioned
his dog to lick his nuts?

329
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,758
Typical psych major,
a complete wise-arse.

330
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,398
And how's your project coming?

331
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,119
Are you still planning to change
the way we humble scientists

332
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,476
- view memory assimilation?
- Don't really have a choice.

333
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,478
Oh, jeez, it smells like
patchouli and arse in here.

334
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,836
Cricket, this is my well-mannered
roommate, Evan.

335
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,433
Yeah...

336
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,556
you're the one
that fucked up the bell curve

337
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,437
on my anthropology final.

338
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,397
- Later, Thumper.
- Bye.

339
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,596
Fucking dick.

340
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,194
- Wow, sweet girl, man.
- I found your shirt, bro'.

341
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,191
Oh, you sick fuck.

342
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,030
Alright, man, get dressed.
You're taking me out.

343
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,350
Why, what'd you do,
ace another midterm?

344
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,112
No.

345
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,038
Better than that,
seven years, no blackouts.

346
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,237
Fuck yeah, bro',
let's do this!

347
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,197
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah! Come and get it.

348
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,431
Be gentle with me! Be gentle!
I'm postcoital. I'm tender.

349
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,670
Did she cradle the balls
and work the shaft?

350
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,633
Nice.

351
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,758
Look at this fucking guy.

352
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,951
Get the fuck out of my bar.

353
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,190
So, which one of you
has the pet worm?

354
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,748
Worms, plural!

355
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,638
Ah. That's so gross.

356
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,678
Talk to him about it.
He's got the fetish.

357
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,228
Watch it.
It's a psych project actually.

358
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,992
It's a study on memory loss.

359
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,152
Better explain before all this excitement
gives me a heart attack.

360
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,597
10 bucks says he
eats it off the floor.

361
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,031
Well, if I can figure out

362
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,315
how the memories
in a simple worm function,

363
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,709
it should help me to understand
the complexities...

364
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,232
of the human brain.

365
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,632
Let me get this shot.

366
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,915
- What the fuck, weirdo?!
- Fuck this...

367
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,152
Well, I guess
that's your game.

368
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,549
Go, you go.

369
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,031
It smells like sex in here.

370
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,590
Yeah, Thumper had
a busy afternoon.

371
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,633
You're kidding?
He's so big.

372
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,517
Yeah.

373
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,195
Well, I guess charisma
and eyeliner go a long way.

374
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,035
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

375
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,677
You got any incense or scented candles
or something?

376
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,239
Okay.

377
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,314
Whoa, no.

378
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,112
Let me put this away.

379
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,395
Most guys usually tuck porn
under their bed.

380
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,277
All you've got
are comp books?

381
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,998
Yeah, they're my journals.

382
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,230
I've been keeping them
since I was seven.

383
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,389
Wow.

384
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,718
Read me something.

385
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,075
I ought to be getting
something out of this.

386
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,991
That's all I've got to say.

387
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,197
Here we go.

388
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,352
'It's like my mind refuses
to believe what I'm seeing.'

389
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,235
'... Hearing Crockett
make those awful screams.

390
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,156
Just writing about it
gives me the shivers.'

391
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,033
Come on. Go on.

392
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,552
'It was like Tommy
was possessed or something.

393
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,990
There was a hate
in his eyes that... '

394
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,873
Are you okay?

395
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,869
Where am I?

396
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,790
What the hell's going on?

397
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,875
I can't get it open!

398
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,509
Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep.

399
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,638
Uhh! I got him, Lenny.
Save Crockett!

400
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,716
Listen to me, Evan,
and you listen to me good.

401
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,995
There's a million
other sisters in the world,

402
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,435
so why'd you have
to fuck with mine?

403
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,596
It's okay.
It was just a dream.

404
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,838
Uh-huh...

405
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,717
it didn't feel like a dream.

406
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,518
Maybe because
they never do.

407
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,388
So, Don Juan, you pass out
on all your dates?

408
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,355
Lenny...

409
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,271
hey, I've got a surprise for you.

410
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,351
You're never gonna
guess who's here.

411
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,876
Hey, it's me... Evan.

412
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,072
What are you working on there?
A model?

413
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,469
Look, uh...

414
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,073
I can see that you're busy,

415
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,390
so I'll try to make this quick.

416
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,153
Remember, uh...

417
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,071
that day at the junkyard

418
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,355
when we were kids?

419
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,432
I was just hoping that you
could help me remember.

420
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,469
Like, just any details about it or...

421
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,432
I couldn't cut the rope.

422
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,750
Yeah...

423
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,513
that's good. Um...

424
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,273
anything else?

425
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,278
'Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep! '

426
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,073
Uh...

427
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,751
Jesus Christ.

428
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,914
It really happened.

429
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,389
Wow, uh...

430
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,436
Wow, Lenny, l...

431
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,950
'Make one peep

432
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,794
and I swear it'll be
your last, motherfucker.'

433
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,075
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout

434
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,276
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

435
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,794
I think I was more
focused on her hands

436
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,190
on mine
than on the mailbox...

437
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,589
across the street.'

438
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,274
Maybe it went out,
should someone check it?

439
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,430
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

440
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,832
You make one peep and I swear
it'll be your last, motherfucker.

441
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,192
Ugh!

442
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,350
Fuck!

443
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,832
What's this?
Huh? What's this?

444
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,195
Want to get the mail?

445
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,118
How's my sweet girl?

446
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,191
How's my sweet girl?

447
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,430
You need a change,
don't you, honey?

448
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,192
You wanna open it?

449
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,430
You wanna open it?

450
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,231
- Oh my God!
- Holy shit!

451
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,356
Run!

452
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,556
Fuck, Lenny, come on!

453
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,676
Lenny, come on!

454
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,637
Come on, Lenny, let's go!

455
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,508
No, baby. That's my finger
in your arse.

456
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,958
Christ, man.

457
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,996
Fuckin' brutal!

458
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,398
What the...?

459
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,553
- Hello.
- Hello. Who is this?

460
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,757
Mrs Kagan, um,
it's Evan... Treborn.

461
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,229
I hope you know
how much you upset Lenny.

462
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,995
Yeah, I'm... look,
I'm really sorry about that.

463
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,548
It took me over an hour
to clean up the mess you made.

464
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,995
Can I just talk to Lenny?

465
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,196
Don't call here.

466
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,715
Mum.

467
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,268
I can't help it.
I'm just so proud of you.

468
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,557
Hey, did... did Dad...

469
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,108
Did Jason get good grades?

470
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,919
Please, he got straight As
without ever touching a book.

471
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,355
It was the one area
his memory never failed him.

472
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,796
Did he ever say that he, like...

473
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,839
figured out a way to recall
his lost memories

474
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,878
like years after he blacked them out
in the first place?

475
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,191
- Why do you ask?
- No, I just figured with him being

476
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,793
you know, such a brain and all

477
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,394
it's like, you would think
that he would figure out

478
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,710
a way to remember
stuff that he forgot.

479
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,870
Well, when he was your age...

480
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,269
almost exactly your age
come to think of it,

481
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,989
he said he figured out
a way to remember his past.

482
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,196
I couldn't tell
if they were real memories

483
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,271
or just his imagination.

484
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,512
Then, just before
it got so bad, he...

485
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,630
had to be institutionalised,

486
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,915
he said he could...

487
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,548
What?

488
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,392
What?

489
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,558
What... what did he do?

490
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,631
Forget it.

491
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,837
It's nothing.
He was far too sick by then.

492
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,270
'I never wanted to be
in the movie, anyway.

493
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,512
I was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

494
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,511
Mr Miller took my shirt off.'

495
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,431
What the fuck are you doing?

496
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,988
Shhh, I need quiet for this.

497
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,514
Are you stupid or what, man?

498
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,194
Maybe there's a reason
you repressed the day

499
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,635
some pervert had you
in your tighty whities.

500
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,517
I'd think twice
about what you're doing.

501
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,955
You could wake up a lot more
fucked up than you are now.

502
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,429
- More fucked up than I already am?
- No, l...

503
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,476
You think you know me?
I don't know me!

504
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,150
Whoa!

505
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,958
I'm sorry.

506
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,031
No, it's my fault.

507
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,236
Can we get through
one damn day

508
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,912
without you
breaking something?

509
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,430
Hey.

510
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,633
Evan.

511
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,312
Oh my God.
It's been a long time.

512
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,991
How you been?

513
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,548
Same old, same old,
you know?

514
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,313
No, I don't know.
Fill me in.

515
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,153
Uhh, well...

516
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,549
I'm going to State now.

517
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,870
It's going good.
My Mum's good.

518
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,076
- I don't know.
- You want a smoke?

519
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,390
- No, not since we were kids.
- No?

520
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,152
I've quit like 100 times.

521
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,157
- Are you walking home?
- Uh-huh.

522
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,435
- Can I walk you?
- Sure.

523
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,269
- Oh my God.
- So...

524
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,996
how's Tommy?

525
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,908
Well, they kept him
in juvie for a few years,

526
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,754
but now he's working
over at Dale's Auto Body.

527
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,796
That's good.

528
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,151
Still living with your dad?

529
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,276
No.

530
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,954
I emancipated myself at 15.

531
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,831
Must've taken a lot of courage.

532
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,275
Not if you remember my dad.

533
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,240
Well, couldn't you have just
moved in with your mum?

534
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,077
No, she had a new family.

535
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,037
Wasn't enough room.

536
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,712
Whatever.

537
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,439
Well look, the reason
I came back to town

538
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,078
was to talk to you.

539
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,230
To me? Why?

540
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,269
Well...

541
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,555
remember when we were kids

542
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,200
and I used to have
those blackouts?

543
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,032
Yeah, of course.

544
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,829
Well, some of those memories
have been coming back to me.

545
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,434
And I just...
I wanted to talk to you

546
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,556
about one of them in particular.

547
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,790
Well, I'll try to remember.

548
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,995
When we were kids, uh...

549
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,150
your dad was making a movie

550
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,152
about Robin Hood... something.

551
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,470
What do you want
to know, Evan?!

552
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,550
Is... did he...

553
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,478
What happened
in the basement?

554
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,437
Look, it was a long time ago.

555
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,071
I know.

556
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,469
Is that why you came
all the way back here?

557
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,279
To ask a lot of stupid questions
about Robin Hood?

558
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,749
No, l...

559
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,037
I just think that something really bad
might have happened.

560
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,395
Is there a point
to any of this?

561
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,960
Look, whatever happened
it wasn't our fault.

562
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,998
We were kids. I mean, there was nothing
that we could do to deserve...

563
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,196
Just shut up, Evan!

564
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,236
You're wasting your breath.

565
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,073
You can't hate yourself 'cause
your dad's a twisted freak.

566
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,675
Who are you trying
to convince, Evan?

567
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,910
You come all the way back here
to stir up my shit

568
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,150
just because you have
a bad memory?

569
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,629
What, do you want me to just cry
on your shoulder

570
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,915
and tell you everything's
all better now?

571
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,070
Well, fuck you, Evan!

572
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,515
Nothing's all better, okay?

573
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,511
Nothing ever gets better.

574
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,593
You know, if I was
so wonderful, Evan,

575
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,477
why didn't you call me?

576
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,915
Why did you just
leave me here to rot?

577
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,710
When he was your age... almost exactly
your age, come to think of it...

578
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,837
he said he figured out a way
to remember his past.

579
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,390
Some dude left
a message for you.

580
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,789
You can smell that all the way
to the bathroom.

581
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,794
Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter.

582
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,792
I just wondered why you didn't
hand in your essay this afternoon.

583
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,519
I was a bit concerned.
Call me to schedule a make-up.

584
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,271
What'd you say
to my sister, motherfucker?

585
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,318
Last night she cried on the phone
for over an hour to me.

586
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,312
She said you came
and saw her last night.

587
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,038
She...

588
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,918
she fucking
killed herself tonight.

589
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,911
She's dead...

590
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,719
and so are you!

591
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,431
'If the scar on my stomach

592
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,511
didn't just come out of nowhere,

593
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,114
maybe my father wasn't
as crazy as everyone thought.

594
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,352
If I can make scars, do I have
the power to heal them?

595
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,675
What about Kayleigh's scars? '

596
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,997
'I never wanted
to be in the movie, anyway.

597
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,676
It was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

598
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,589
But Mr Miller took my shirt off.'

599
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,916
I've got an idea.
Let's go down to the basement.

600
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,389
It'll look more like
a dungeon down there.

601
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,038
A little light here.

602
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,190
Huh?

603
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,558
Hey, now what did I tell you
about keeping that door shut?

604
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,153
But I wanna see.

605
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,708
You're going to see the back of my fist
in about two seconds

606
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,597
if you don't do what I tell you.

607
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,074
Now, in this part of the story,

608
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,391
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian

609
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,517
and they have to kiss and stuff,

610
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,556
like the grown-ups do.

611
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,949
So, take off
your clothes, Kayleigh.

612
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,754
Come on, just like
when we take a bath.

613
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,149
Don't make a big deal out of it.
You too, Evan.

614
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,315
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
We're making a movie here.

615
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,755
Put your hands on your ears.

616
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,429
What time is it?

617
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,672
It's time for you to do
what I tell you to do.

618
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,716
Wrong answer, fuckbag!

619
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,439
This is the very moment
of your reckoning.

620
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,557
In the next 30 seconds, you're going
to open up one of two doors.

621
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,110
The first door will forever
traumatise your own flesh and blood.

622
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,794
What... what's happening?

623
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,996
How are you doing this?

624
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,150
It'll change your daughter

625
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,037
from a beautiful child

626
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,270
into an empty shell

627
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,157
whose only concept of trust

628
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,516
was betrayed by her own
sick paedophile father!

629
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,397
Ultimately...

630
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,152
it'll lead to her suicide.

631
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,708
- Nice work, Daddy.
- Who are you?

632
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,236
Let's just say you're being
closely watched, George!

633
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,232
Your other option is
to treat Kayleigh like...

634
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,595
say like a loving father
treats his daughter.

635
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,791
Sound okay to you, Papa?

636
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,035
Yes.

637
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,714
Listen close then, fuckbag.

638
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,518
You screw this up again,

639
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,239
I'll flat out castrate you.

640
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,917
What you need to do
is discipline your son Tommy,

641
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,594
because the kid
is one sadistic pup.

642
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,119
One last thing.

643
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,877
Don't ever touch me again!

644
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,238
I... I won't.

645
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,959
Ahhh!

646
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,837
Faster, faster!

647
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,032
Crockett!

648
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,678
Kayleigh, I can't believe
you came!

649
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,552
I think you got one.

650
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,358
Check out our new house.

651
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,510
- Forever.
- Hell or high water.

652
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,878
Honey, are you alright?

653
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,796
Oh my god, Evan,
you're bleeding.

654
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,348
Kayleigh, you're still... You...

655
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,638
Incredible.

656
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,190
Well, thanks. Go get cleaned up
and come back to bed.

657
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,831
Ohh. Where are my clothes?

658
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,990
Those are your clothes, silly.

659
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,953
The bathroom is...

660
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,313
Hurry up. I want a quickie
before school.

661
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,831
What?

662
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,032
Unfucking believable.

663
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,433
Alright.

664
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,750
I wish I could get as excited
over a nosebleed.

665
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,197
Sorry, uh, I didn't
see you there.

666
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,352
What?

667
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,352
You're the girl that
was with those arseholes

668
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,431
throwing popcorn at Thumper.

669
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,431
What?

670
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,193
And your name is Gwen.

671
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,713
I know you.

672
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,034
Seriously, Evan,
lay off the blow.

673
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,832
- Hi.
- Hi.

674
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,150
Hey, um...

675
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,834
don't freak out
when I ask you this, but...

676
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,432
do you remember when your dad
got that video camera?

677
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,839
What's up, man?

678
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,354
Yeah, um...

679
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,908
I think he had it like
the first day

680
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,956
and then he gave it away
or something.

681
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,951
Why would that freak me out?

682
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,753
I don't know.

683
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,910
Just being weird.

684
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,070
You are such a goofus.

685
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,630
So I'll see you tonight.

686
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,438
Okay.

687
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,639
- Andrea...
- Evan...

688
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,950
- and Chuck...
- aren't home right now.

689
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,871
You know what to do.

690
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,678
Uh, hey, Mum.

691
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,752
It's me. And hey, Chuck.

692
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,798
Ah, I'm just calling
to say hi, I guess.

693
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,677
Give me a call back.

694
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,078
Hey, Thumper, do you know
what time it is, man?

695
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,435
What's the matter,
you lost your Rolex?

696
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,277
Fuck you, frat boy!

697
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,749
Remember, everyone,
there's only two more weeks

698
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,149
until your psych projects
are due.

699
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,118
Uh, about that essay
I missed last week,

700
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,475
we're still okay
with the extension, right?

701
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,312
And you are?

702
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,789
Evan... Treborn.

703
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,677
Well, the answer's no, Mr Treborn.

704
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,274
Now please take your seat.
The exam is about to begin.

705
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,670
Alright, settle down, everyone.

706
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,274
The exam will begin
in one minute.

707
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,152
Get off me, arsehole.

708
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,515
You guys started that shit.

709
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,068
Evan, you're hysterical.

710
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,838
Did you study for this?

711
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,398
Oh, uh...

712
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,436
we'll find out.

713
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,351
Me neither.

714
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,198
Holy shit!
Are these the answers?

715
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,872
Damn, Evan,
keep it on the dl.

716
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,191
Hey, uh...

717
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,750
I want to do something special
for Kayleigh tomorrow night.

718
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,150
Uh, so if I said that I needed

719
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,470
some help from you
and the brothers...

720
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,949
I'd say, 'blow me.'

721
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,114
Get the pledges to do it.

722
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,760
- Right, the pledges.
- Yeah.

723
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,354
You may begin now.

724
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,114
Oh, that was so good.

725
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,197
Oh my God.

726
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,436
Where'd you learn
those new tricks?

727
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,637
Why?

728
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,678
It... it wasn't weird, was it?

729
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,913
Yeah, if you call
multiple orgasms weird.

730
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,313
Hello?

731
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,311
- Fuck 'em.
- Hello?

732
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,028
Oh.

733
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,038
What do you think
it is about us

734
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,079
that makes us so perfect?

735
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,638
I mean...

736
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,075
why did you sneak out

737
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,913
to visit me
after I moved away?

738
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,752
'Cause I missed you.

739
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,793
What, do you think my dad could have
stopped me from seeing you?

740
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,359
What's he gonna do?

741
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,156
Oh, my gosh.
My toes are numb.

742
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,074
Do you think that we'll
be together forever?

743
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,717
That is the plan, isn't it?

744
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,431
'Hell or high water'?

745
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,272
Yeah.

746
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,316
Yeah, that's...

747
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,072
I was just making sure.

748
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,353
Yeah, that's the plan!

749
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,877
Alright, uh...

750
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,794
all you rushes, you know
what you have to do for me.

751
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,632
Pledges, uh...

752
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,472
we're pledges, sir.

753
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,393
Uh, brother Evan, sir.

754
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,799
Are you kidding me?

755
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,431
What?
What did you say to me?

756
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,988
You know what, give me the Greek
alphabet. Give it to me!

757
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,479
- Uhh-uhh.
- Uhh-uhh.

758
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,232
- Alpha, beta...
- Alpha, beta, gamma, delta...

759
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,470
epsilon, zeta, eta, theta,
iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi,

760
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,199
omicron, pi, rho, sigma, tau,
upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega, Sir.

761
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,113
Maybe that's what it is.
Don't fucking look at me, look down.

762
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,073
Uh...

763
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,836
alright, um...

764
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,999
so, you... you pledges

765
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,878
you guys know what
you need to do for me.

766
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,678
And you guys take a shower

767
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,830
and if anyone
gives you any trouble,

768
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,512
you tell 'em I said it was okay.

769
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,711
What?

770
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,396
Shower that, bitch.

771
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,040
I don't understand.
Where are you taking me?

772
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,270
I'm not telling.

773
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,549
Oh my God!

774
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,515
Wow, it's beautiful.

775
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,319
Go on, sit down.

776
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,032
Thank you.

777
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,356
! You gave us
some place to go!

778
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,275
! I never said
thank you for that...!

779
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,959
Why are you doing this for me?

780
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,072
When I woke up this morning...

781
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,711
I saw your smile.

782
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,432
That smile.

783
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,119
And I knew

784
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,158
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life

785
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,992
with you.

786
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,515
! Now I'll never
have a chance!

787
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,673
! May angels
lead you in...!

788
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,835
I've been looking
all over for you, man.

789
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,273
Someone trashed your car.

790
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,231
What the...

791
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,237
Who did this?!

792
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,311
Who did it?!

793
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,595
It was probably
those Beta fuckers.

794
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,636
No, no, no.

795
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,870
How did somebody
get away with this

796
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,871
right in front
of the frat house?

797
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,348
- Dude, what is that, a dog collar?
- Tommy.

798
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,556
Don't.

799
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,272
He might be watching.

800
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,833
It's my fault.

801
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,388
I should have told you
he was released a few weeks ago.

802
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,152
Yeah, it might have been nice.

803
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,468
God.

804
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,070
Like this is gonna
do any good.

805
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,310
Maybe one of the frat guys
has got a gun.

806
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,311
Evan, don't even joke!

807
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,038
He's not going
to hurt you, okay?

808
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,076
He's just trying to scare you
away from me.

809
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,435
He killed my dog.

810
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,353
- You don't remember that?
- Evan, it's not his fault.

811
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,874
You know how bad he had it
when we were kids.

812
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,509
Oh no, don't give me
this bad upbringing shit.

813
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,158
You turned out just fine.

814
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,390
My father never
laid a hand on me.

815
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,756
It's like that prick
saved it all up for Tommy.

816
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,319
Okay. Alright. Uh...

817
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,949
We'll let campus security
deal with it. Okay?

818
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,669
You know what?
I think I should sleep alone.

819
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,119
No, you're not staying alone.
I'm staying with you.

820
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,316
Evan, I just... I don't want Tommy

821
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,913
to see us together right now.

822
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,151
No, I lost you once
and I'm not losing you again.

823
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,832
What do you mean
you lost me once?

824
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,673
Evan, you've never lost me.
What are you talking about?

825
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,672
God, you've been
acting so weird lately.

826
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,275
Look, my car just got wrecked, okay?
I'm kind of freaking out.

827
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,874
I know that, but...

828
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,518
your accent's changed.

829
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,637
- You don't even walk the same.
- What, I walk differently?

830
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,676
I mean, that dinner tonight,

831
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,557
it was so beautiful.
It was gorgeous.

832
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,551
But it just wasn't you.

833
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,154
I can't do
something nice for you?

834
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,435
Wait...

835
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,351
isn't that your jacket?

836
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,552
Tommy!

837
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,670
You stay away from us,
you sick fuck.

838
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,955
Oh, get this 'us' shit.

839
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,395
Like I'd ever lay a hand
on my own sister.

840
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,835
You're doing real nice
for yourself, Evan.

841
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,876
You've got a nice life,

842
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,678
you got nice friends,

843
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,876
not to mention
you're fucking my sister.

844
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,428
Not a bad piece of arse
if I say so myself.

845
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,318
- Shut up, Tommy!
- Oh, come on. That's a compliment.

846
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,197
What are you doing, man?
What the fuck?

847
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,078
Oh, it's not good enough that
the whole fucking world loves you?

848
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,230
But you've got to take
the only thing on this Earth

849
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,197
that doesn't think
that I'm a piece of shit?

850
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,679
You know I love you.

851
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,910
No one thinks that
you're a piece of shit, Tom.

852
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,117
What was it you said?
I think I believe it was, 'sick fuck'!

853
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,077
Don't! Tommy!

854
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,079
Stop!

855
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,673
Stop!

856
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,439
Stop! Oh my God!

857
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,118
Stop!

858
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,077
Oh my God!

859
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,798
Oh!

860
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,072
No, Evan!

861
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,309
Stop!

862
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,435
Stop it!

863
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,557
- You're gonna kill him!
- He's a fuckin' maniac!

864
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,551
Don't do this,
I'm begging you!

865
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,312
You ruined Lenny's life!

866
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,313
You killed Crockett!

867
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,231
You killed
that woman and her baby!

868
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,675
Now you're trying to kill me.

869
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,354
Just tryin' to fucking kill me!

870
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,356
Oh my God!

871
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,829
Oh my God,
what did you do?

872
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,230
Oh my God!

873
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,518
You right there, faggot!

874
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,515
First time?

875
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,113
Yeah.

876
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,511
You'd better not
bitch up, man.

877
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,989
You'll wind up someone's
luggage that way.

878
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,312
Can you protect me?

879
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,038
Jesus himself

880
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,554
couldn't make me stand up
against the brotherhood.

881
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,436
Look, man...

882
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,789
when they come,

883
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,838
you go someplace else
in your head, man.

884
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,150
Be somewhere else.

885
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,517
Back your arse up.

886
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,269
Yo, gimme that.

887
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,077
I spoke to your lawyer.

888
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,390
And he says he's sure

889
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,357
he can get you off
on self-defence.

890
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,396
So if you're just patient...

891
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,233
Mum...

892
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,992
How long am I gonna
be in here?

893
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,150
I don't know.

894
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,118
These things take time.

895
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,838
What about the journals?

896
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,876
Did you bring the ones
I asked you to bring?

897
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,997
I found these two.

898
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,957
The others are still in storage.

899
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,072
Mum! I...

900
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,114
I need them all,

901
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,792
all of them.

902
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,791
And I'm going
to get them to you,

903
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,919
but right now, you need
to concentrate on the case.

904
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,678
Please.

905
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,917
Alright.

906
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,831
You're right.

907
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,069
What about Kayleigh?

908
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,116
Is she alright?

909
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,237
Try to tell her I'm sorry.

910
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,950
Time's up.

911
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,632
I'm not going
to lose you, kiddo.

912
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,597
Promise me you'll hang on.

913
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,879
Shit on my dick
or blood on my knife.

914
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,878
They're mine...

915
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,918
Come on!

916
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,837
Back the fuck off!

917
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,353
Show's over, ladies!

918
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,913
Put this maggot
back in his cell.

919
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,719
Move it!
Come on, let's go!

920
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,434
We'll be seeing you
later on tonight, little sister.

921
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,616
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

922
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,099
Come on, Reese.

923
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,773
You're religious, Carlos,

924
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,657
you believe in that whole bit,

925
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:01,129
the Lord works
in mysterious ways?

926
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,415
Straight up, man.

927
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:07,015
'Cause I think Jesus sent me
to your cell for a reason.

928
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,489
For you to help me.

929
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:13,410
Shit.

930
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,252
I knew you were crazy, man.

931
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:16,659
I ain't bullshitting you.

932
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,617
Jesus speaks to me
in my dreams.

933
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,850
Oh, yeah?

934
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:23,579
That's cool. Great.

935
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,652
A pack of smokes says
I can prove it to you.


936
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,931
When I'm out, I need you to watch
my hands and face closely.

937
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:37,780
You need to see
the prison shrink, man.

938
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,328
Just tell me if you see
anything just... weird.

939
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,332
Weirder than this?

940
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,138
It could be marks.
It could be scars.

941
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:47,814
It could be anything,
I don't know.

942
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:52,217
'On Wednesday, I got in trouble
for a drawing I didn't do.

943
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,370
Mummy won't let me see it.

944
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:12,095
Hey, no monkey business, Evan.
Sit down and finish your drawing.

945
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:17,334
That's great, everyone.

946
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,331
Just imagine
what you want to be.

947
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,092
There's no limits.

948
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,815
Oh, Mrs Boswell.

949
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:38,215
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle!

950
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,530
Look, it's stigmata, man!

951
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,497
What'd you see?
What'd it look like?

952
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:45,856
The signs of the Lord, man.
They just come out of nowhere.

953
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,851
Man, I thought you were...

954
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:50,056
I though you were
fucking crazy, man.

955
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:53,211
So now you believe me.

956
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,212
Straight up, man.

957
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:09,577
Wanna make a deal?

958
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:14,609
Alright, look. I'm new here,

959
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,452
but I think I get
how things work.

960
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,176
You either join a gang
or you're dead.

961
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:25,218
Well, I sure as fuck ain't joining up with no
spics or niggers.

962
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,330
And I don't want to die.

963
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,536
So...

964
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,618
what do I gotta do?

965
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:40,211
I'm the new guy.
I've got to work my way up, so...

966
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,456
should I...

967
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,292
suck your dick now...

968
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,457
or...

969
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,852
Is your blood pure?

970
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:57,215
Well, I ain't no fucking kike,

971
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,699
if that's what you're asking me.

972
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:01,499
Well then, let's see
what you got, honey.

973
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:04,458
Watch the fucking teeth
or you'll be leaving without 'em.

974
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,939
Yes, Sir.

975
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,292
Come to daddy.

976
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,209
Carlos!

977
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:29,937
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard

978
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,056
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy!

979
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:34,654
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

980
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,492
Hold 'em. Hold 'em.

981
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,332
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard

982
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:40,456
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy.

983
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,258
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

984
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,170
Rot in hell,
you fucking animals!

985
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:52,248
Wait, before we...

986
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,695
we need something
that could open the sack.

987
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,892
I want you to take this, Lenny.

988
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:08,936
Today's your day of atonement.

989
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,614
I know how guilty you feel
about that woman and her baby.

990
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,816
Evan, stop it.
It's not the time.

991
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,937
Now's the only time! Today you get
a chance to redeem yourself,

992
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,897
to start all over with a clean slate.

993
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:21,619
- What are you talking about?
- Evan, you're acting crazy.

994
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,897
Please, if you've ever trusted me before,
trust me on this one.

995
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:30,172
Cut the rope.

996
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:35,139
Come on.

997
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,818
- Listen to me good, Evan.
- I'll do whatever you want.

998
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,334
You don't want me to see
Kayleigh ever again, fine.

999
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,058
Just let Crockett go.

1000
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:45,937
Besides, if you kill him now,

1001
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,851
they'll stick you
in juvie for sure.

1002
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:50,773
And I know you'd never leave
your sister alone with your father.

1003
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,613
Lenny, no!

1004
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,219
Oh God.

1005
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,491
Oh God, Lenny.

1006
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,411
I said cut the rope.

1007
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,209
It's all backwards.

1008
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:49,452
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1009
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:50,893
Evan...

1010
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,416
What the fuck?

1011
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:02,139
Lenny, no!

1012
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:05,733
Want a ride?

1013
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,612
Lenny!

1014
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,894
Somebody call 911!

1015
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,653
Evan! Evan!
Fuck! Evan!

1016
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:25,972
Hey, doc.

1017
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:28,051
What's the damage?

1018
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,529
- How much time do I got?
- Cute, Evan.

1019
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:34,533
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen
results like these before.

1020
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,418
Not even with my father?

1021
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:41,129
Well, actually, they didn't
have these tests 20 years ago.

1022
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,892
So, what did you find?

1023
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:45,733
We're finding most of
the haemorrhaging is coming from here,

1024
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,776
the outer layer
of the cerebral cortex.

1025
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,578
That's where
the memories are stored.

1026
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:50,979
- Thank you, Evan.
- Uh-huh.

1027
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,459
I've never seen
anything like it.

1028
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:55,179
We compared these
to the ones taken last year.

1029
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:58,218
We found severe haemorrhaging
and massive neural reconstruction.

1030
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:59,733
What does that mean for Evan?

1031
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,651
What he's saying, Mum,
is that I've jammed

1032
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:04,095
40 years worth of memories
into my head in the last year.

1033
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,774
It's overload city. I've completely
reprogrammed my brain.

1034
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:09,772
- That about the gist of it, doc?
- Yeah.

1035
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:15,128
Alright, I'm going
to go wait in the car.

1036
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,609
The light in here is kind
of bugging my eyes, so...

1037
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,168
It was good seeing you, doc.
It really was.

1038
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:23,093
It was very... very informative.

1039
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,489
But, you know,
I got people to see

1040
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:28,219
and things to read.

1041
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,097
Alright, see ya.

1042
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:01,934
Hey.

1043
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,179
It's me...

1044
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:08,137
Evan.

1045
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:10,780
Can I get you anything?

1046
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,976
What about...
what about some of those

1047
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:17,096
model airplanes you like, huh?

1048
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,653
I bet I can get a shitload

1049
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,049
of those model airplanes up in here.

1050
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,692
Lenny.

1051
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,409
You knew the whole time,
didn't you?

1052
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,538
When you put that shard
in my hand...

1053
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:47,817
you knew something big
was going to happen.

1054
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,255
Didn't you?

1055
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,770
Yeah...

1056
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,932
- I knew.
- Then you should be where I am.

1057
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:03,293
You should be

1058
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:05,211
where I am.

1059
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:26,538
'Today I get to meet my father.

1060
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:29,411
His name is Jason...

1061
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,298
and he's crazy.

1062
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:36,130
I hope he let's me
call him "Dad."'

1063
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:40,055
You okay?
'Cause you look like

1064
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:42,131
you went somewhere else
there for a second.

1065
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,973
Look, Jason, I need some
fast answers from you

1066
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,779
if I'm ever gonna fix
what I've done.

1067
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:50,374
I was praying this curse
would have ended with me.

1068
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:51,939
Yeah, but it didn't.

1069
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:54,295
So now I need information
to make things right again

1070
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:56,336
and you're the only one
that can give it to me.

1071
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,569
There is no right.

1072
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:00,777
You can't change who people are
without destroying who they were.

1073
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:03,249
Who says you can't
make things better?

1074
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:06,138
You can't play God, son.

1075
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:09,138
It must end with me.

1076
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:12,337
Just by being here you may
be killing your mother.

1077
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,456
That's bullshit, you know?

1078
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:17,612
I'll send you a postcard when
I made everything perfect again.

1079
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,937
Ahh! No, no!

1080
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:43,611
Just get out, did ya?

1081
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,656
Hmm?

1082
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:48,937
Oh, nothing, just that my brother
did a stint in the pen

1083
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,692
and he used to eat like that.

1084
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:54,459
I come from a big family.

1085
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:56,292
Well, I meant no offence.

1086
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,049
None taken.

1087
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:01,370
Hey, uh...

1088
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,371
Does Kayleigh Miller
still work here?

1089
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,771
I'm sorry.
I never heard of her.

1090
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:27,813
God! Can't a man get a little
goddamned peace in his own house?!

1091
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:33,934
I don't suppose
you're here to sell cookies?

1092
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,738
Good guess, fuckbag.

1093
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,211
Remember me, huh?

1094
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,450
We had a nice chat once
when I was seven.

1095
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:45,496
I got one question for you.

1096
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,411
Where can I find
your daughter?

1097
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,135
Oh, I thought
you were someone else.

1098
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:28,736
Make it fast,
I'm expecting someone.

1099
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:33,932
Hey. It's good to see you.

1100
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:36,733
Can I come in?

1101
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:38,572
If I knew you were coming,

1102
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:40,890
I would have cleaned
the stains off the sheets.

1103
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:49,690
What do you want?

1104
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:52,169
I just needed to see
a friendly face.

1105
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,979
Well, time is money, Evan.

1106
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:58,618
Money.

1107
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:03,057
I guess I can spare 10 minutes
for an old friend, right?

1108
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:06,018
So, how's tricks?

1109
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,295
Sorry, occupational humour.

1110
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:09,938
I got it.

1111
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,050
You can stop now.

1112
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,210
Oh, sorry.

1113
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:18,929
Does my line of work
make you uncomfortable, precious?

1114
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:22,569
No, just that you felt like
you had to use it to hurt me.

1115
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:27,930
I've been where you've been.

1116
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,453
Ha!

1117
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:30,939
Where is that?

1118
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,378
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

1119
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,052
I know people always say that,

1120
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,812
that you wouldn't believe me,

1121
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:41,095
but in this case
it's not even worth trying, so...

1122
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:47,290
I knew I needed to find you,

1123
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,132
so I went over to your dad's

1124
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:51,131
and made him tell me
where you were.

1125
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:53,211
Then I came here
and the rest you know.

1126
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,336
You're right, Evan,
I don't believe you.

1127
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:57,695
I never thought you would.

1128
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,010
That's why I never bothered
to tell a soul until now

1129
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,170
and I never will again.

1130
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:04,091
I'm the only person you've told?

1131
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:06,653
That's a great line.

1132
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:09,334
Does that make other girls wet?

1133
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,980
Do they actually
eat up that bullshit?

1134
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:18,533
You know, I could give a shit
whether you believe me or not.

1135
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:21,498
Frankly, I'm too tired
to prove it to you...

1136
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:23,536
Oh, there's proof now, huh?

1137
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,853
How else would I know you have
twin moles on your inner thigh?

1138
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:30,579
Anyone with 50 bucks
could tell you that.

1139
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,378
Okay.

1140
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,530
Forget that.

1141
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:36,736
How about the fact
that you prefer

1142
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:39,175
the smell of skunk to flowers?

1143
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:41,615
Or that you hate cilantro

1144
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,736
because for some reason
unknown to you

1145
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:45,697
it reminds you
of your stepsister?

1146
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:49,295
Or that when you have an orgasm,
your toes go numb?

1147
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:52,099
I'm sure all of your clientele
are privy to that.

1148
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,496
You know? Look, I just
thought you should know.

1149
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:00,491
Know what?

1150
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:03,413
That you were happy once...

1151
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,452
with me.

1152
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,334
You know there's one
major hole in your story.

1153
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,854
There's no fucking way
on this planet

1154
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:15,977
or any other, I would ever be
in some fucking sorority!

1155
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:21,619
You were happy there.

1156
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,531
Oh, you're crying?

1157
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:26,293
You sure you don't
want your wallet?

1158
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,052
No, I don't need it
where I'm going.

1159
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:31,177
What, are you off to change
everyone else's life again? Is that it?

1160
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:33,728
Maybe next time you'll pop up
in some mansion

1161
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:36,288
while I end up in Tijuana
doing some donkey act.

1162
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,814
You know what? I'm over it.

1163
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:41,130
Every time
I try to help someone

1164
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:42,699
everything just goes to shit.

1165
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:45,135
Well, don't give up now, slick.

1166
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,415
Hell, you've already
done so much for me.

1167
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,730
Why don't you go back in time

1168
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:52,618
and save Mrs Halpern
and her baby?

1169
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:57,296
And then maybe Lenny wouldn't
freak out and ruin my family.

1170
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,974
No, go back
to when I was seven

1171
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:03,530
and fuck me in front
of my daddy's video camera.

1172
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:07,653
Straighten me out a bit.

1173
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:22,850
You're on my bed.
Get out!

1174
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:26,728
Buddy, I thought it would be okay
what with you being sick and all.

1175
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,337
I'm not going to say it again.

1176
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:48,055
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout

1177
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:50,210
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

1178
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,973
I think I was more focused
on her hands on mine

1179
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,732
than on the mailbox
across the street.'

1180
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:03,616
Lady, stay back!
Don't go near the mailbox!

1181
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:06,533
- Idiots!
- I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!

1182
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:08,815
I'll save you, lady!

1183
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,219
God damn it, I thought
I told you two to get out.

1184
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,651
Oh, sorry, man.
Did we wake you?

1185
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:26,853
No, it's cool.

1186
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,817
Okay.

1187
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,978
It's really cool.

1188
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:54,858
What the fuck is this?

1189
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:03,694
- Please save his arm!
- Can you open up my locker?

1190
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,533
- Happy Birthday!
- Can I come too?

1191
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,178
Do you want me
to hold your popcorn?

1192
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,298
Evan? Get a towel!
Get a towel!

1193
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:14,291
Evan! Oh my God!

1194
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:16,496
Evan! Evan!
Evan!

1195
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:19,458
Hey, where you going?

1196
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:21,849
You ever notice Kayleigh's smile?
I love her smile.

1197
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:23,851
Lenny's the best.

1198
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:25,737
You guys make a great couple.

1199
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:27,731
You ever think
that I'll find someone?

1200
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,489
Evan!

1201
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:35,854
Where are we going?

1202
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:37,851
We're taking you
to the hospital, Evan.

1203
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:40,818
- No, take me back.
- Sorry, your mum would kill me.

1204
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,896
- Oh.
- You take me back, Lenny!

1205
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:48,534
You owe me that much.

1206
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,893
What are you geeks
looking at?

1207
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:57,289
It must be nice to be
so goddamed perfect, huh?

1208
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:00,611
Fucking losers!
Lenny, help me!

1209
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,770
Here, get him over.
Get him over.

1210
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:07,092
Hey, Brian, how's
your head feeling, buddy?

1211
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,932
I saw that girl
you went home with.

1212
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:11,011
Did she borrow
your razor this morning?

1213
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,772
You're so bad.

1214
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:16,932
Hey, there's Tommy.
Hey, Tommy! Tommy!

1215
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:19,693
Hey, what's up, guys?

1216
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,811
Hey, man,
I did what you said.

1217
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:25,494
We're pooling our student funds
with the Hillel house

1218
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,571
and we're having
an awareness dance.

1219
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:30,094
Oh, awesome.
Maybe I can spin my chair around

1220
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:32,296
to a techno remix
of 'Hava Nagila' till I puke.

1221
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:35,617
Maybe we should be
getting to class now.

1222
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:37,338
What's the point
of psych class now?

1223
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:40,093
Tomorrow I could wake up
a dirt farmer in Bangladesh.

1224
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:42,853
Let's go for a stroll.

1225
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:45,254
Bye, babe.

1226
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:47,171
- Yippee.
- Bye, sis.

1227
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:48,613
What's up with him?

1228
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,419
So Tommy's really
into this Jesus freak thing, huh?

1229
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,456
You know how spiritual
he's gotten

1230
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:55,815
ever since he saved
Mrs Halpern and Katie.

1231
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:59,768
He saved Mrs Halpern?

1232
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:01,851
Please. The twisted fuck.

1233
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:05,410
Here, why don't we sit right here?

1234
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:14,533
Want a granola bar?

1235
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,533
Here, just...

1236
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:24,855
Yeah, I gotta fix
these things or something.

1237
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:29,571
Kayleigh...

1238
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:31,412
do you ever think about us?

1239
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,333
I mean, do you ever wonder

1240
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:37,059
if things might have been
different between us?

1241
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,778
Sure, Evan.

1242
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,734
You were the first person
I really ever cared about.

1243
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:47,969
- I was?
- Yeah.

1244
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:52,172
That's why when I was little,
I never went to live with my mother.

1245
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,410
I don't get it.

1246
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,616
When... when my folks split up,

1247
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:00,578
they gave me and Tommy a choice
of who we wanted to live with.

1248
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:03,254
And I couldn't stand my dad.

1249
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:06,252
But I knew that if I went
to move with my mum,

1250
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:08,729
I'd never see you again.

1251
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,492
I didn't know that.

1252
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:15,137
So you still think about us...

1253
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:16,892
together?

1254
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,810
Well, it's crossed my mind
from time to time.

1255
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,970
And?

1256
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,654
Well, a lot of things
have crossed my mind, Ev.

1257
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:30,972
I mean, I could play out the entire movie of
our lives in one second.

1258
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:32,937
Boom, we fall in love.
We get married.

1259
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:36,649
We have kids.
Our kids grow old, as do we.

1260
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:39,174
Matching burial plots.
The whole thing.

1261
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:43,498
Plah, it took a lot longer
to spit out than to imagine.

1262
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,690
Things like that usually do.

1263
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:51,532
So...

1264
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,531
do you think that
it might have worked?

1265
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:55,611
Yeah.

1266
01:29:57,580 --> 01:29:59,616
I mean, but that's
not how things wound up.

1267
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,936
I'm with Lenny.

1268
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,056
Lenny is your friend

1269
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:09,335
and...

1270
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:11,058
and that's where it ends.

1271
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:15,492
Well...

1272
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:19,493
would it make a difference
if I told you that

1273
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:23,493
no one could possibly ever
love anyone as much as I love you?

1274
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:35,496
I'm not saying that. I...

1275
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:38,936
- Yeah.
- I'm not... I'm just saying it like

1276
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:41,978
if you were a girl,
would that be something

1277
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:43,812
that you would want to hear?

1278
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,337
Hold on one second.
Lenny's calling.

1279
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,297
I'll be right back, Ev, okay?

1280
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:59,097
He's a little down...

1281
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:01,812
I love you.

1282
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,851
You forgot to put
the toaster on the ledge.

1283
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:02,372
Lenny likes Pop Tarts.

1284
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:04,576
You guys are all
that matter now.

1285
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:09,494
Man, I know it's hard,
but you can't give up.

1286
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:12,378
I can't even
fucking kill myself.

1287
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,212
Don't talk like that.

1288
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:25,655
Alright, I've got
to get you out of here.

1289
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,935
Visiting hours
are almost over.

1290
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:34,255
Did Mum
get transferred again?

1291
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:37,252
What are you talking about?
She's been here the entire time.

1292
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:48,055
Looking... good, kiddo.

1293
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:55,709
Lung cancer?

1294
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:58,907
You started chain smoking
when I blew myself up.

1295
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:01,385
Sorry, Mrs T, he's been
acting out of sorts lately.

1296
01:33:01,385 --> 01:33:03,182
Mum...

1297
01:33:03,265 --> 01:33:04,983
you're going to be okay.

1298
01:33:05,065 --> 01:33:06,703
I can change it.

1299
01:33:06,785 --> 01:33:08,980
Um, maybe... I wanna go
down to the chapel.

1300
01:33:10,025 --> 01:33:14,576
You're... acting...

1301
01:33:14,665 --> 01:33:17,941
just like your father.

1302
01:33:17,265 --> 01:33:19,984
I'm going to get you
out of here. Okay?

1303
01:33:20,065 --> 01:33:20,941
No.

1304
01:33:21,825 --> 01:33:23,417
You're not going
to hurt anymore.

1305
01:33:23,505 --> 01:33:25,382
I'm going to fix it.

1306
01:33:25,465 --> 01:33:26,454
No.

1307
01:33:27,905 --> 01:33:29,896
No, no.

1308
01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:34,304
Are you sure
you even packed it?

1309
01:33:34,385 --> 01:33:36,057
My mum packed it.

1310
01:33:36,145 --> 01:33:38,136
I think she sent
everything I ever owned.

1311
01:33:38,225 --> 01:33:40,261
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

1312
01:33:40,345 --> 01:33:42,336
What do you want it for?
I don't get you lately.

1313
01:33:42,425 --> 01:33:43,938
Duly noted.

1314
01:33:47,025 --> 01:33:48,697
Okay, I have to ask you
one last favour.

1315
01:33:48,785 --> 01:33:50,741
- What?
- I need you to be quiet.

1316
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:53,578
I have to concentrate
if I wanna destroy the blockbuster.

1317
01:33:53,665 --> 01:33:57,453
- What? What, the blockbuster?
- If I hadn't blown off my arms,

1318
01:33:57,545 --> 01:34:00,423
my mum would've never started
smoking in the first place.

1319
01:34:00,505 --> 01:34:02,336
Never mind. Just open it.

1320
01:34:04,385 --> 01:34:05,977
Turn it.

1321
01:34:06,065 --> 01:34:08,295
There.

1322
01:34:11,905 --> 01:34:13,896
'Today Mummy
is taking me to play

1323
01:34:13,985 --> 01:34:15,737
with Kayleigh and Tommy.

1324
01:34:15,825 --> 01:34:19,022
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

1325
01:34:22,025 --> 01:34:24,300
Now, how do I destroy
the blockbuster?

1326
01:34:38,905 --> 01:34:42,295
Evan, what are you
doing with that knife?

1327
01:34:45,585 --> 01:34:49,578
Well, that didn't work.
Go on, turn it.

1328
01:34:50,745 --> 01:34:52,258
Turn it. There.

1329
01:34:53,825 --> 01:34:56,339
'I never wanted
to be in the movie anyway.

1330
01:34:56,425 --> 01:34:58,780
It was cold so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

1331
01:34:58,865 --> 01:35:00,776
But Mr Miller made me
take my shirt off.'

1332
01:35:00,865 --> 01:35:02,537
In this part of the story,

1333
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:06,095
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian.

1334
01:35:06,185 --> 01:35:09,495
And they have
to kiss and stuff,

1335
01:35:09,585 --> 01:35:11,098
like grown-ups do.

1336
01:35:11,185 --> 01:35:13,016
Wait, I need my belt.

1337
01:35:19,745 --> 01:35:22,418
Hey, don't even
bother about a belt.

1338
01:35:22,505 --> 01:35:25,941
- Hey.
- Back off, fuckbag.

1339
01:35:26,025 --> 01:35:28,937
Amazing that word never fails
to make an impression with you.

1340
01:35:29,025 --> 01:35:31,414
Easy does it, Evan.

1341
01:35:31,505 --> 01:35:34,383
Don't be a bad boy
or I'll tell your mother

1342
01:35:34,465 --> 01:35:36,342
what a naughty
little shit you are.

1343
01:35:36,425 --> 01:35:38,302
And I'll tell
Child Protective Services

1344
01:35:38,385 --> 01:35:40,501
about your little
kiddie porn endeavours.

1345
01:35:40,585 --> 01:35:42,701
One step closer
and I'll shove this up your arse.

1346
01:35:42,785 --> 01:35:45,015
Hey, that's dangerous.
You could blow off your hand.

1347
01:35:45,105 --> 01:35:47,141
Been there, done that.

1348
01:35:49,545 --> 01:35:50,660
Hey!

1349
01:35:54,505 --> 01:35:56,382
- Sparkler.
- Kayleigh, no!

1350
01:35:56,465 --> 01:35:59,025
No! Kayleigh, no!

1351
01:36:06,545 --> 01:36:07,773
Hey, man.

1352
01:36:09,385 --> 01:36:11,103
...good, kiddo.

1353
01:36:11,185 --> 01:36:13,938
I've got no choice but to commit you
to Sunnyvale Institution...

1354
01:36:14,025 --> 01:36:16,380
You're gonna have to live
somewhere else for a while.

1355
01:36:16,465 --> 01:36:18,456
- A squashed butterfly.
- I want my mummy!

1356
01:36:18,545 --> 01:36:19,864
I'm so sick of this!

1357
01:36:19,945 --> 01:36:21,856
I think we should
up your medication.

1358
01:36:50,145 --> 01:36:51,897
Where are
my goddamn books?

1359
01:36:51,985 --> 01:36:54,943
Hey, Evan, we're not supposed
to meet for another hour.

1360
01:36:55,025 --> 01:36:57,255
Where are
my goddamn books?

1361
01:36:57,345 --> 01:36:59,779
Books?

1362
01:36:59,865 --> 01:37:01,742
My journals.

1363
01:37:01,825 --> 01:37:03,702
I... I need them.

1364
01:37:03,785 --> 01:37:07,573
So, if you'd give 'em to me,
it'd help a lot.

1365
01:37:07,665 --> 01:37:09,735
It really hurts me
to go through this again.

1366
01:37:10,865 --> 01:37:12,696
There are no journals.

1367
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:14,741
There never were.

1368
01:37:14,825 --> 01:37:17,498
It's part of the fantasy world
that your mind created

1369
01:37:17,585 --> 01:37:20,816
to cope with the guilt
of killing Kayleigh Miller.

1370
01:37:20,905 --> 01:37:23,783
Think, Evan, think.

1371
01:37:23,865 --> 01:37:26,254
You've created a disease
that does not exist...

1372
01:37:27,345 --> 01:37:29,336
alternate universes with colleges

1373
01:37:29,425 --> 01:37:31,700
and prisons and paraplegia.

1374
01:37:31,785 --> 01:37:34,618
I want my journals
and I want 'em now!

1375
01:37:34,705 --> 01:37:37,503
And I know that you got 'em
and you're gonna give 'em to me!

1376
01:37:37,585 --> 01:37:39,860
You're not going to hide them
from me. I want them!

1377
01:37:41,745 --> 01:37:44,134
You're reminding me
of your father.

1378
01:37:44,225 --> 01:37:46,375
He was always screaming
for a photo album

1379
01:37:46,465 --> 01:37:48,376
even though
he never had one.

1380
01:37:49,905 --> 01:37:51,543
I'm so sorry.

1381
01:37:55,185 --> 01:37:57,335
A photo album?

1382
01:37:57,425 --> 01:38:00,019
- Photos.
- Evan?

1383
01:38:02,065 --> 01:38:05,262
The damage is irreparable.

1384
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:13,582
Frankly, I'm surprised he still
has use of his motor functions.

1385
01:38:23,305 --> 01:38:25,580
Mum?

1386
01:38:25,665 --> 01:38:28,702
Um, did you remember to bring

1387
01:38:28,785 --> 01:38:30,855
those home movies
that we used to make?

1388
01:38:31,905 --> 01:38:33,702
Yeah, they're right here.

1389
01:38:35,145 --> 01:38:39,058
Good, because I really like
to watch them.

1390
01:38:42,745 --> 01:38:44,258
So that's good.

1391
01:38:48,785 --> 01:38:51,253
I think it's best we
transfer him to Bellevue

1392
01:38:51,345 --> 01:38:52,778
first thing in the morning.

1393
01:39:33,585 --> 01:39:36,497
'If anyone finds this,

1394
01:39:36,585 --> 01:39:41,022
it means that my plan
didn't work

1395
01:39:41,105 --> 01:39:43,414
and I'm already dead.'

1396
01:39:44,985 --> 01:39:47,783
He's not in his room.
Search the grounds.

1397
01:39:47,865 --> 01:39:50,982
'If I can somehow go back

1398
01:39:51,065 --> 01:39:53,374
to the beginning
of all of this

1399
01:39:53,465 --> 01:39:57,936
I might be able to save her.'

1400
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,400
Evan!

1401
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:03,000
Over here!

1402
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,400
Evan!

1403
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,280
I believe he's in here.

1404
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,280
Evan!

1405
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,680
What's your name?

1406
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:12,680
Kayleigh.

1407
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,200
This is Evan.

1408
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,880
Evan! Open up!

1409
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,000
Evan!

1410
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:24,200
Say hi, go on.

1411
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:41,600
I hate you. You ever come near me again
I'll kill you and

1412
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,600
..your whole damned family.

1413
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:52,080
What happened sweetie? What's wrong?

1414
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,680
Goodbye

1415
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:01,600
Cracker!

1416
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,600
Evan...

1417
01:41:06,405 --> 01:41:08,480
Kayleigh and Tommy!

1418
01:41:08,565 --> 01:41:10,840
I missed you!

1419
01:41:10,925 --> 01:41:13,883
I'll never let you guys
out of my sight again.

1420
01:41:15,145 --> 01:41:17,579
Happiness can only
be achieved through sacrifice,

1421
01:41:17,665 --> 01:41:19,735
like the sacrifices our parents have made
for us to be here today...

1422
01:41:19,825 --> 01:41:22,259
Whoo-hoo! Great! Tommy!

1423
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,080
Are you alright?

1424
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,080
Where's Kayleigh?

1425
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:34,000
Who's Kayleigh?

1426
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,000
Who's Kayleigh?

1427
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:42,080
Who's Kayleigh?

1428
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:44,280
Do you want me to take you to the doctor?

1429
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:45,600
No.

1430
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,600
No. I think everything
is going to be alright this time.

1431
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,600
Sure about this?

1432
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:19,680
I know who I am, I don't need
a bunch of stuff to remind me.

1433
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,200
I'm running a little late.

1434
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:45,480
Yeah, I had to finish up with a patient.

1435
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:48,880
Get the soup or something.

1436
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,400
Alright, love you Mom.

1437
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,200
Bye bye.
