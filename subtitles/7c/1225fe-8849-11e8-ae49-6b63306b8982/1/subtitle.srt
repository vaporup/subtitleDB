1
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,419
We lost 300 gold pieces,
thanks to your meddling.

2
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,255
We won't go back empty-handed.

3
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,592
If your hands are so empty,
will you hold this?

4
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:36,125
Is it true they hired you
for only twenty gold pieces?

5
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,196
Yes.

6
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:42,097
The sword we stole was a treasure
given to them by the Shogun.

7
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:46,195
And they'll only pay twenty
pieces to get it back?

8
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,141
Ridiculous!

9
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,472
They're a poor, small clan.

10
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:55,207
Trying to swindle 300 pieces
for a sword is asking too much.

11
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,209
Shut up! Damn you!

12
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,080
Looks like a nasty
storm's brewing...

13
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,954
Can't waste my time here!

14
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,591
Oh, I'm sorry for you.

15
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,892
That was one hell of a storm!

16
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,904
No shit! My roof got blown off
and scared my wife so bad...

17
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,633
...that she went into labor.

18
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,368
It was really something.

19
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,706
That's your seventh kid, right?

20
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,302
Nope, the ninth.

21
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,406
Holy! You must
really love your wife!

22
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:43,086
Isn't that Sakichi's daughter
from Shimoda Village?

23
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,858
What's with her?

24
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,861
What's wrong?!

25
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,873
All... dead...

26
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,936
Everybody's dead.

27
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,242
Dead?!

28
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:11,443
Plague... Plague did it...

29
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,451
MY GOD!

30
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,893
This area's off limits!
No one goes through!

31
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,556
This highway's closed
until the epidemic is over.

32
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,895
Epidemic?!
The hell with that!

33
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,837
What is it?

34
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,339
Sir, my scout saw a
strange group of men...

35
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,434
...ride toward Shimoda
Village late last night.

36
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,447
It might have something
to do with this epidemic...

37
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,517
...so I came to tell you,
Chamberlain.

38
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,246
Meaning what?
That they spread a plague...

39
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,221
...as they passed
through the village?

40
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,690
Ridiculous!
Why would they do that?

41
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,184
Something's fishy.

42
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,294
Let it alone.

43
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,165
On second thought, we can't.

44
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,761
This is the order to all
of you in the Koga ninja team.

45
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,933
Go to Shimoda Village and
find what really happened.

46
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:10,873
Sir!

47
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,208
One more thing. If any of
your people get infected...

48
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,715
Understood, sir.

49
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,710
The first group will follow the
Shirakawa River from the north.

50
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,118
The second will cross
Taro Pass from the west.

51
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,214
You'll reach Shimoda Village
in about an hour. Understand?

52
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,729
Hikoza saw them. There were
only eight. No match for us.

53
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,728
Our real enemy is
this epidemic disease.

54
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,532
True.

55
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,380
Kagero...

56
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,116
You intend to leave
me behind, Hanza?

57
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,828
You have your
own duties, don't you?

58
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,126
Poison tasting is very
important. Don't forget that.

59
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,792
While our lord is away from his
domain, the work isn't necessary.

60
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,896
Until he returns...
I am one of the Koga ninja!

61
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,909
I cannot take you.

62
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,011
You all could be killed out there.

63
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,843
How can I...

64
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,144
...just sit and wait here alone?!

65
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,864
Kagero's gotten
even more beautiful.

66
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,133
All the more
reason to pity her.

67
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,607
It's her destiny.
She must hate it.

68
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,211
Enough.
Where are Hikoza and the others?

69
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,282
They were right behind us.
I'll have a look.

70
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,397
Hey! What are you doing?

71
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,060
What the?!

72
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,360
There!

73
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:10,852
Shit!

74
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,912
Kagero, get back and
tell the chamberlain!

75
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,544
Go now!

76
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,097
Just be quiet and you'll
live a little longer.

77
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,693
Either way's fine by me. A dead
girl might be an interesting lay.

78
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,966
That's better.

79
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,484
I'm busy here.
Get lost!

80
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,322
Didn't you hear me?

81
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,104
The highway's out and I had to
make a detour, but now I'm lost.

82
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,840
Can you tell me
how to get to Kakio?

83
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,644
Not very friendly...

84
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,010
I think I told you to get lost!

85
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,662
Forget it. Once I get
rid of this meddler...

86
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,240
...I'll take my time killing you.

87
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,712
What's wrong? Sorry you
didn't run when I told you to?

88
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,948
No, just thinking...
About your body.

89
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,348
Your body
can't be rock hard everywhere!

90
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,923
Move it!

91
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,442
Tessai!

92
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,991
You are indeed a sorry sight.
But no need to pursue him so.

93
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,194
I'll kill him!

94
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,527
No, you shan't.
Don't forget our mission.

95
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:17,363
Consider my word
as Lord Gemma's order.

96
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,994
Understood?

97
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,136
Shall we go?

98
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,788
Who was that freak?

99
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,022
Forget it. I don't want
to see him again, anyway.

100
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,262
I'm grateful to you.
I am Kagero of the Koga ninja.

101
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:51,766
Jubei. Kibagami Jubei.
Are you all right?

102
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,669
I don't need your concern!

103
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,466
The town of Kakio is in the west.
Our paths part here.

104
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,616
Who is it?

105
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,484
Kagero of the Koga, sir.

106
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,557
What's wrong?

107
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,725
Twenty ninja led by Hanza
attempted to infiltrate...

108
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,060
...Shimoda Village a little
while ago. They were wiped out.

109
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,230
Really? All of them?
Who killed them?

110
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,067
A very formidable opponent.
Beyond that, I cannot say.

111
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,635
Useless, all of them.

112
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,309
And you're the only survivor?

113
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,581
Until we learn who he is
and what he's up to...

114
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,590
...we can't risk sending our
men to that plague village.

115
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,253
The first task at hand is
to go back and find that out.

116
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,525
We'll figure out what
to do later. Now go...

117
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,501
Oh, hi...

118
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,975
I know the way now, so...

119
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,039
No, you're going the wrong way.
The river to hell...

120
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,587
...is THIS way!

121
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:40,201
Ow... Okay, it's out of your
system. Are we even now?

122
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,075
Not yet. I still owe you.

123
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,339
That's just excessive.

124
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,746
If we keep this up,
one of us is going to die.

125
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,719
"One of us?"

126
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,715
There's no reason we
should kill each other.

127
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,722
If you're not going
to end this... I will!

128
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,024
Like hell!

129
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,207
Strange skill you have.
But it can't hurt my body.

130
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,749
Seems that way.

131
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,199
What's wrong, monster?
Your skin's starting to crumble!

132
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,769
Die!

133
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,736
Splendid! Your sword flew
swift as the wind itself...

134
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:32,749
...and slashed your enemy
like a cyclone's touch.

135
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,114
He was no match for you.
Why don't you join me?

136
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:42,455
Your skills will be of great help
for me to fight the likes of him.

137
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:47,191
You're joking. Who'd want to
fight a monster like him again?

138
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,100
You'll have to.
They won't leave you alone.

139
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:55,765
You've just killed one
of the Eight Devils of Kimon.

140
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:01,209
You didn't beat him
by yourself, though.

141
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,877
That Koga ninja woman...
Interesting technique she uses.

142
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:27,228
Lord Gemma. Everything
is proceeding as planned.

143
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,611
It arrives from the Shogun of
the Dark by six tomorrow evening.

144
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:43,852
Very well.
Write to him in return.

145
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:49,258
"We return in three days.
There's nothing to worry about."

146
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,021
At once.

147
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,368
Isn't Tessai back yet?

148
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,772
Benisato went to look for him.
We're all alone.

149
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,602
Yurimaru...
I've always loved you.

150
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,517
Don't push your luck, Zakuro.

151
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:24,392
You're of no interest to me.
Now go and stand watch.

152
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,298
So, it's true.

153
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,403
May your dreams be pleasant
ones in Gemma's arms.

154
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:45,577
However, Yurimaru, Gemma makes
love to both men and women.

155
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,415
Do you know
he makes love to Benisato?

156
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,318
Apparently not.

157
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:44,136
Where are you headed?

158
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,910
No place in particular. You?

159
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:53,944
I'm looking for somebody,
and you look exactly like him, so...

160
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:59,417
Strangers can look alike.
I'm Kibagami Jubei, a wanderer...

161
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,635
It was most
certainly your face.

162
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,065
Tessai was able to make
an impression of it.

163
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,424
Just leave me the hell alone!

164
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,195
A cast-off skin.

165
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,764
She shed it
like a snake and escaped.

166
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,579
A gang of freaks,
one and all.

167
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,583
You've no obligation. I just
didn't want you to die yet.

168
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,580
Who are these
Eight Devils of Kimon?

169
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,552
A group of ninja who
work for the Shogun of the Dark.

170
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,628
You know of the
Shogun of the Dark?

171
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:14,062
He wants to rebuild the House of
Toyotomi, the ex-ruler of Japan.

172
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,727
He has 16 lords behind him and
is trying to expand his influence.

173
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,294
The most dangerous enemy
of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

174
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:25,399
His power is supported in the
shadows by the Eight Devils.

175
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,604
What are they up to
here in Mochizuki?

176
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:32,616
That's what I came here to
find out. It's a tough job.

177
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,117
Why don't you work for me,
for 100 gold pieces?

178
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,383
A Tokugawa spy wants
to hire a ninja?

179
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,360
I'm afraid I have no choice.
It's an emergency.

180
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,797
Only I managed to make
it here to Mochizuki.

181
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,596
The Eight Devils killed everyone
else in my party on our way here.

182
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,399
I need your help by all means!

183
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,108
You'll never get away from them.

184
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,405
You'll have to fight
them sooner or later.

185
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,845
Join me. You can kill two
birds with one stone, right?

186
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,418
I don't think so. Now why
don't you just leave me alone?

187
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,152
I see. Too bad.

188
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,126
Such a pity...

189
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,192
You'll lose your precious life.

190
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,660
You're stubborn.

191
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,831
No, what I speak of is literally
of life or death importance to you.

192
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,309
You see, the point of that
throwing star was poisoned.

193
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,313
It won't kill you instantly,
but in a day and a night...

194
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,679
...when it starts to work,
nothing can stop it.

195
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:44,484
Unless you get the antidote.
And only I know what it is.

196
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,524
Work for me and I'll tell you
the antidote along with the...

197
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,186
...hundred gold pieces
when the job is done.

198
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,222
You're bluffing.

199
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,101
I speak the truth.

200
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,834
Tell me now.
What's the antidote?

201
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:08,572
Not until you work for me.
Kill me and you've killed yourself!

202
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,219
Now you'll need the
antidote for yourself.

203
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:19,449
Poor boy...
You've so much to learn.

204
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,186
That isn't the one that hit you.

205
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,686
I threw THAT one away.

206
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,764
Shit!

207
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:35,234
Kibagami Jubei...
You've lost... amateur!

208
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:40,243
My name is Dakuan.
How do you do?

209
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,881
So, Benisato...

210
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:50,182
This man, Kibagami Jubei, is a
remnant of the Shogunate's spies?

211
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,050
Possibly.

212
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,387
Why didn't you kill him?

213
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,892
Someone interfered.

214
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,188
No excuses!

215
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:04,730
If he's a government spy,
he'll show up here soon.

216
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,701
Be sure to kill him this time!

217
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,730
I don't need your
advice to do that.

218
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:14,939
Yurimaru... I'll tell Gemma
about this in bed. Do you mind?

219
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,942
Not at all.

220
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,883
Jubei...

221
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:30,384
There's something
I've been wondering.

222
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:34,022
Are you, by any chance,
the ninja who killed...

223
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,896
...the chief retainers of the
Yamashiro clan five years ago?

224
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,434
He was supposedly a
master swordsman, like you.

225
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,710
The retainers who were killed
had gorged themselves with gold...

226
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:51,077
...they secretly dug
out of a hidden mine.

227
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,049
The ninja must have killed
them by order of the lord...

228
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,121
...who wanted to report to
the government about the mine.

229
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,055
Because if the government found
the hidden gold mine first...

230
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,149
...the lord would have
lost his fief.

231
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:06,262
But does that ninja know that
after the retainers were killed...

232
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,663
...the government received
no report about the mine?

233
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:15,101
Why? If a government spy
like you knows all that...

234
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,674
...then why don't
you do something?

235
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:23,105
No... Even the government can't
move without definite evidence.

236
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:27,412
Our spies tried many times
to infiltrate the clan...

237
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,079
...to find evidence,
but none returned alive.

238
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,985
The Shogun of the Dark...

239
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,684
He stopped them by
using the Kimon ninja.

240
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,724
Why is the Shogun of the Dark
helping the Yamashiro clan?

241
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:43,199
Simple. He wants the
gold mine for himself.

242
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:49,506
Do you know how he found the
gold mine before the government?

243
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,736
Because somebody
gave him the information.

244
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:56,245
Somebody who was the leader of
the ninja of the Yamashiro clan.

245
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,947
Himuro... Gemma?!

246
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:01,943
Precisely.

247
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,955
I doubt that. He isn't
in this world anymore.

248
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,994
No, he's still very much alive.
And you'll see him soon.

249
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,963
Himuro Gemma is the boss
of the Kimon monsters.

250
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:14,963
What?!

251
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,466
Shh! Not so loud!

252
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,332
You can't trick me
the same way again!

253
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:22,964
Don't be hasty.
You'll soon know the truth.

254
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:28,209
But you must admit that you
and he share a strange fate.

255
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,688
Stop!
You'd kill your own friend?!

256
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,247
- The lord orders it!
- As did our leader!

257
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,596
It's a trick! Now that we
know the traitors' secret...

258
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:49,064
...they want to get rid of us
by making us kill each other.

259
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,604
This is a trap for all of us.
Shinkuro, believe me!

260
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,068
Jubei... Forgive me.

261
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,573
Shinkuro!

262
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,902
His word...

263
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,445
...is law!

264
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:46,586
I avenged Shinkuro and others myself.
Gemma can't be alive.

265
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:51,561
We're getting close. This place
is thick with ghosts and blood.

266
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,188
Beyond lies hell itself.

267
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:02,328
Heaven must have sent
this mist to help us.

268
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,852
Hey!

269
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,525
Double damned mist!

270
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,856
How could he have
dodged Shijima's claw?

271
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,415
Who are you?

272
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:29,015
I heard a voice
chanting the sutra.

273
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:32,290
I was praying for
the dead villagers.

274
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:37,560
Don't you know an epidemic
is plaguing this village?

275
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:43,433
Poor soul! You'll never
leave this village alive.

276
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,433
Here now, let us go to
the land of Buddha together.

277
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:57,453
Have you seen a
traveling monk here?

278
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:03,083
He'll meet Buddha soon enough.
I'll send him there.

279
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,587
Such a benevolent nun...

280
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,039
Shit!
Another cast-off skin!

281
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:30,476
Gone...
He uses a strange technique...

282
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,224
As do you.
Very strange indeed!

283
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:58,240
Answer me. Are there any
others with you besides the monk?

284
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,785
Of course.
And not just ten or twenty.

285
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:06,755
You can send a snake for each
and it won't be enough.

286
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,459
Liar!

287
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:14,156
All right!
I'll tell you the truth.

288
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,928
There's two. One's the
traveling monk. The other...

289
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,298
...is right behind you.

290
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,775
Lose the snakes.
Down to the last one!

291
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,143
You'll be dead soon.

292
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,552
Get rid of them!

293
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,504
Now it's your turn to answer.

294
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,271
What are you doing
in this village? Talk!

295
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,168
Twice failed. Unforgivable.

296
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,229
I cast another line onto your
neck, but you didn't notice.

297
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,606
In the end,
just a foolish amateur.

298
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,553
Idiot! There's still time
to suck the poison out!

299
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,063
Poison doesn't work on me.
My body's immune to it.

300
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,496
I think I've cleared
my debt to you.

301
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,406
Yes. You saved me.

302
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:10,572
Your name's Kagero, right?
What are you going to do now?

303
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,047
That's none of your concern.

304
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,819
If it isn't, then what
the hell am I doing here?!

305
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,550
I have to discover their plan.

306
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,682
By yourself? Impossible!

307
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,819
They're too strong.
Think this over.

308
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,220
Stay out of my way.

309
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,425
I've no reason to
take orders from you.

310
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,302
Hold a moment,
ninja woman of Koga.

311
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:41,572
My name is Dakuan.
Why don't you join me?

312
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,171
This man is my
trustworthy assistant.

313
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,251
I wasn't planning on
helping a government spy.

314
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,320
Oh, quit complaining!

315
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,945
What do you say, woman?

316
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:56,425
Our aims may differ, but we
three share a common enemy.

317
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,462
And three is mightier than one.

318
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,465
And I happen to have some
information you don't know.

319
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,934
Such as who is giving
them their orders.

320
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,834
I'll tell you on the way.

321
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:12,834
I need no friends.

322
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:17,640
But I may need
your information.

323
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,375
Very well.

324
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:30,316
My, she's a lovely,
sexy little thing, isn't she!

325
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,953
What's running through
that twisted skull of yours?

326
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,359
Well now, that ninja girl
could prove very useful.

327
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,960
She has a technique to poison
the man she sleeps with.

328
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:46,469
The big guy you killed
had been poisoned by her.

329
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,385
Anyone who makes
love to her dies.

330
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,980
A perfect woman for
this hellish world.

331
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,600
Your skill is as
marvelous as ever.

332
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,796
No... He was able to kill
a mighty ninja like Tessai.

333
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:52,308
Don't be off guard.
It's possible he got away.

334
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,742
The four of you
will check it out.

335
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,177
You're a cautious one,
Yurimaru.

336
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:02,275
We have an important mission.
We take every precaution.

337
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,013
I know, I know. Don't worry.

338
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,484
Then go.

339
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,822
Yurimaru, Benisato's death...
How fortunate for you!

340
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,404
Only things he
killed were the fish.

341
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,773
Good. Otherwise we
wouldn't get our chance.

342
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,176
It's getting quite
interesting, isn't it?

343
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,057
How is it?
Just as we thought?

344
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,859
They poisoned the wells
and killed the villagers.

345
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,732
And then blamed it
on an epidemic disease.

346
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,765
A trick to keep
the villagers away.

347
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:03,773
They're planning something...
very extraordinary.

348
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,020
I'd like to
know what it is.

349
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:20,364
That's fine, just don't get
yourself involved too deeply.

350
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,398
It could prove fatal.

351
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,984
I see. Guide the others.

352
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,106
Run for it!

353
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,132
We can't outrun them.

354
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:31,967
Kagero...

355
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,081
So, the pollen is mixed
with a sleeping potion.

356
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,124
But how long will
it hold them back?

357
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,490
Why, you!

358
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,125
Girl!

359
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,761
You have to hold them off
till Jubei kills him!

360
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,834
Do whatever it takes!

361
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,741
Call off your wasps!

362
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,513
I'm afraid you
must beat me first.

363
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,490
You don't know
anything, do you?

364
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,526
Do you think I ran
in here to escape you?

365
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:32,126
No, I don't.

366
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,130
I have lots of questions for
you, but no time to ask them.

367
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,759
No, just one thing.
Tell me, is Himuro Gemma alive?

368
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,803
So what if he is?

369
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,465
Because I sent him to hell before.

370
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,304
Is that so?
Then I'll have to be careful.

371
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,779
Unlike Gemma, I don't have the
technique to reincarnate myself.

372
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,807
Reincarnation?

373
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,556
Fool!
You've damaged the hive!

374
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,242
The second you come up for air
is the second you die!

375
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,475
He's mine!
Keep your hands off him!

376
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,179
What about
the ninja girl and the monk?

377
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:35,349
My wasps should
finish them off soon.

378
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:48,368
How far is he trying to run?
What a poor loser!

379
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,120
Do you think he's fallen
victim to the throat needle?

380
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:21,230
No... The wasps in the hive
are trying to escape the water.

381
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:25,604
Desperately stinging his body
as they do so... Mushizo's lost.

382
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,788
Took his time about it,
but he finally killed him.

383
00:42:53,500 --> 00:43:00,004
Reincarnation? Did he mean
Himuro Gemma's come back to life?

384
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,672
Impossible!

385
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,518
Reincarnation?
I've heard about the technique.

386
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:25,797
You must control your flesh and
blood down to the tiniest bones.

387
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,838
If your limbs or even
your head were cut off...

388
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,965
...you'd be able to rejoin them.

389
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,977
Reincarnation...
That's a technique of immortality.

390
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,047
It can never be achieved
by a human being.

391
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:40,444
Well, well...
That's a hell of a trick!

392
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:44,817
Anyway, the Kimon monsters
are now all after you.

393
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,550
That means I can move easily.

394
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,888
If you're lucky,
we'll meet again.

395
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,197
Why did you join him?

396
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,465
He hired me...
For 100 gold pieces.

397
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,405
You're a mercenary ninja?
One who'd do anything for money?

398
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,439
You could say that.

399
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:11,844
But he suckered me into it.
Trapped me.

400
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,679
I'll die of his poison
in half a day.

401
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:20,019
He promised me an antidote
along with the gold.

402
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:24,527
That's why I work for him.
I can't back out now.

403
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:28,189
You'd better run for it
while I divert their attention.

404
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,131
I can't do that.
I'd owe you another debt.

405
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,493
Forget about any debts.

406
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,835
And I told you I don't
have to take orders from you.

407
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,067
Besides,
I'm ready to die any moment.

408
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,167
Relax.
Stop pretending you're so tough.

409
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:42,370
What?!

410
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,478
It's this humid weather!

411
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,610
I wish a storm would come and
cool off that hot head of yours.

412
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,826
You're in no position
to worry about me.

413
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,294
Storm...

414
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:11,638
They came on the night
of that big storm...

415
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,376
Hey, where can I get
a good look at this area?

416
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,417
How about there?

417
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,956
Nothing.

418
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,184
Keep looking!

419
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:42,801
Hanza...

420
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,529
Wait!

421
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,369
Hanza!

422
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,883
There's a cliff
in front of you! Stop!

423
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:55,418
Damn!

424
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,230
Gotcha!

425
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,334
Shit!

426
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:24,342
Fool! They got you so soon?
We still had a lot to do.

427
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,154
The scent of blasted flesh,
grilled to perfection...

428
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:34,588
Such a lovely smell.

429
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,075
Don't... move...

430
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:02,518
That's enough. Let me go.

431
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,587
It's my fault
I fell for their trap.

432
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,282
Shut up! Don't talk!

433
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,092
Let go of me!
I don't want your help.

434
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,094
Shut up!!!

435
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,968
Go on, grab it!

436
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,321
Just gonna hang onto me all day?

437
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:00,142
I am Utsutsu Mujuro.
I've been longing to challenge you.

438
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,882
He's here for me.
Stay here.

439
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:26,198
You lured me here because I'm blind?
Is that your plan?

440
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,279
If you want to kill me,
then don't make a sound.

441
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:48,289
That's impossible. But maybe I can
turn your skill to my advantage.

442
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,730
I told you to stay back!

443
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,868
Your sight is your weakness.

444
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,275
Outta the way!

445
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,052
Impossible...

446
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,784
Would you give it a rest?!
What the hell were you thinking?!

447
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,687
What are you so obsessed about?

448
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:30,354
Shut up! You're the one obsessed
with repaying me for saving you!

449
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,452
You act like you've got
some kind of death wish!

450
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,193
Is it because of your body?

451
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:44,133
Is it true the men you sleep
with die from the poison?

452
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,446
Embrace me and you'll find out.

453
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,446
Idiot!

454
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,415
My body is saturated with poison.

455
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:05,484
It's so strong that a touch of
my lips will kill instantly.

456
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:11,832
No one can touch me.
Anyone who dares to... dies.

457
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,834
Did the poison
twist your heart, too?

458
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,933
How dare you!

459
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,977
I hate people who don't
value their own lives.

460
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:48,529
You've no idea...
You couldn't understand!

461
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,440
The cargo from the ship that ran
aground in the storm two days ago.

462
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,540
That's what they're after.

463
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,916
They butchered the villagers
like animals for it.

464
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,967
Where does this road lead?

465
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:00,907
Chamberlain!

466
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,811
Lord Hyobu, is it true?
That the Koga ninja who...

467
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:08,874
...went to investigate Shimoda
Village were wiped out?

468
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:09,883
Exactly.

469
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:14,184
But how?!
This is an emergency.

470
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,555
I'll take my men to the
village immediately.

471
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,786
No!

472
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:22,228
If this is serious
enough to jeopardize...

473
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,199
...the safety of our clan,
we must move very carefully.

474
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,395
That's how small clans
like ours can survive.

475
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:28,630
But...

476
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:32,606
The ninja woman who survived
is continuing the investigation.

477
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,643
Wait for her report.

478
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,922
You're tired from being
tensed up all the time.

479
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,654
Get some more sleep.

480
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:48,143
Those wheel tracks lead
to Kashima Harbor.

481
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,981
They're probably going to
transport the cargo out by boat.

482
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,486
If I don't stop them...

483
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,615
...the dead villagers and Koga
ninja will never rest in peace.

484
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,325
I'll cooperate with you
till the mission's over.

485
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:05,527
But if you insult me again,
I'll kill you where you stand!

486
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:25,218
Listen well, you who labor
for the Shogun of the Dark.

487
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,655
This mission could very
well decide our fate!

488
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,226
This ship will reach the
Mochizuki domain in a few hours.

489
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:35,196
We must retrieve the
cargo at any cost!

490
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,766
Understood? At any cost!

491
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:00,116
The townsmen must have cleared out
out fear of the epidemic.

492
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:03,954
One horse was enough
to scare them all away.

493
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:11,524
So, you're still alive.
I've been worried.

494
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,527
It's nice to see you, too.

495
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:18,300
They're waiting for a boat
to transport the cargo.

496
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:20,710
Did you check
what the cargo is?

497
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:25,406
No, I couldn't reach it.
But I can guess what it is.

498
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,540
Actually, I guessed before
I came here to Mochizuki.

499
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:29,082
What?!

500
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,415
You haven't figured it out?

501
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:34,046
It's something that has
to do with your past.

502
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:40,555
It's gold, boy. Gold produced
from that secret Yamashiro mine.

503
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,065
The ship ran aground
during the storm...

504
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:48,763
Probably on its way to the Shogun
of the Dark with caskets of gold.

505
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:53,366
Gold that's probably been
hidden for the last five years.

506
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,706
If it reaches his hands,
he'll be powerful enough...

507
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:58,372
...to topple the
Tokugawa government...

508
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,608
...and plunge the country
into another civil war.

509
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:03,015
We have to stop it at any cost!

510
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:09,748
Dakuan, you've got a tail.

511
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:10,684
What?!

512
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,171
Girl, what are you doing?!

513
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:27,209
I'm calling a Koga ninja bird
that's in this village.

514
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,834
Calling a bird? What for?

515
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,142
It'll carry my message
to the castle chamberlain.

516
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:34,148
I've discovered
what they're after.

517
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,186
In two hours, his army
will surround the town.

518
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,188
It's not as easy as you think.

519
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,555
The Mochizuki clan will probably
ignore this whole thing.

520
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,554
Why?!

521
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,856
The future of the clan is at stake.

522
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,164
This is a power struggle between the
Tokugawa and the Shogun of the Dark.

523
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:58,070
If a small clan like the Mochizuki
got involved, it'd be smashed!

524
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:05,173
See nothing, hear nothing.
That's the best course for the clan.

525
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:19,421
We'll find out soon whether or
not the Mochizuki will move.

526
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,534
So, now what are you playing at?

527
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:35,873
The man you hired is going
to die from your poison.

528
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,140
Tell me how to save him.

529
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:43,276
Amazing! You've fallen in
love with Jubei, haven't you?

530
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:48,848
Fool! I'm only doing it
to clear my debt with him!

531
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,051
I don't think so.

532
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,319
A ninja woman falling in love!
What's the point?

533
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,767
If you kill me,
there'll be no saving him.

534
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:04,966
Yes, and your mission
will be a failure.

535
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:21,985
Shit!

536
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,489
Uh-oh!

537
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:28,530
Calm down!
That's the real cure for him.

538
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:31,293
If you want to save his life,
there's no other way.

539
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,665
It's up to you.

540
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:06,030
It must have happened when
I went off for a moment.

541
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:11,032
She's most likely dead.

542
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:14,676
Well, we've got work to do.

543
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,337
We'll get no help
from the Mochizuki clan.

544
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,542
Don't fall for their trap.

545
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:24,547
Wait!

546
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:28,322
What if their ship comes
while you're at it?

547
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:31,860
Let her alone! A dead ninja
girl isn't that important!

548
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,662
Not important compared
to the great mission?

549
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,664
You're as much of
a monster as they are!

550
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,757
Fool! When you fight monsters...

551
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:42,235
...you become one yourself
or you can't win.

552
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:47,641
You damn fool boy!
Go ahead! GO TO HELL!

553
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:50,736
You god damned!!!

554
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,175
Are you all right?

555
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,143
Kagero!

556
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:19,691
You're hard to kill, but...
Woman, release his pain.

557
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,117
Kibagami Jubei?

558
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:48,129
Yes. But we've already
killed them all.

559
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,927
Idiot! They still live.

560
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,800
I'll kill him, for sure!

561
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:58,465
Stay where you are.
Lure them there and kill them.

562
01:02:58,574 --> 01:02:59,768
Understand?

563
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:01,207
Yes.

564
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:09,143
Never would I have
imagined to see him here.

565
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,686
I look forward to
seeing you again, Jubei.

566
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:14,888
Gemma!

567
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:21,563
I'm sorry.

568
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:26,167
Forget it. I take it the castle
retainers haven't taken any action?

569
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,268
It's been two hours.

570
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,271
I see.

571
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:39,875
Why... You knew it was a trap,
but you came to help me.

572
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:43,179
It was stupid.
Why risk your life for me?

573
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:45,277
Because you're my comrade.

574
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,184
Comrade?

575
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:50,955
Yes. We've saved each other
over and over since yesterday.

576
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,186
You're a precious friend to me.

577
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,398
Stay!

578
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,530
The Mochizuki clan
is sitting this one out.

579
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,199
Your mission is over.

580
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:11,201
No, it isn't.
I'm still in debt to you.

581
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,482
You can pay it back later.

582
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:17,545
Not if you're dead!

583
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:19,484
I'll repay it here!

584
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:31,327
What are you doing?

585
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,774
The old man told me how
to counteract the poison.

586
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,769
"Kill poison with poison."

587
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:48,579
He said if you make love
to me, you'll be cured.

588
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,015
Take me...

589
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,704
Why?!
You'll die if you don't!

590
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,710
Why? JUBEI!

591
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,347
We've been waiting!
Load the ship immediately!

592
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,440
You! Well,
I warned you, didn't I?

593
01:06:56,545 --> 01:07:00,606
We're screwed.
We'll never beat that many men.

594
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:05,620
I don't intend to let them go.
We'll make our stand soon.

595
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,382
What are you planning?

596
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,425
When they finish loading
the gold onto the ship...

597
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,460
...go to the tower
and ring the bell.

598
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:15,928
While they're distracted,
I'll sneak onboard the ship.

599
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,933
When we're out at sea,
we won't need any storm.

600
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,627
I'll sink it myself.

601
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:21,634
Very well.

602
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:26,497
By the way, did you make
love to the ninja girl?

603
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,836
None of your damn business!
Now get going!

604
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:56,804
Gemma... Where are you?

605
01:07:56,906 --> 01:08:00,000
When I die, I'll take
you to hell with me!

606
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,640
The Mochizuki clan?!
They're moving against them!

607
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,116
Ah, Kagero!
You've done a fine job.

608
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,610
Hurry, before they get away!
Where are the others?

609
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:49,121
Don't worry. They've
got this place surrounded.

610
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,593
Then hurry!

611
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:11,606
Jubei...

612
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:21,269
Kagero!

613
01:09:22,613 --> 01:09:24,171
Stop! It's a trap!

614
01:09:24,916 --> 01:09:29,182
Fools! Sakaki Hyobu
died two days ago.

615
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:45,199
I killed him personally.

616
01:09:45,636 --> 01:09:48,469
GEMMA!!!

617
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,631
Sir, please get
aboard the ship quickly.

618
01:10:18,736 --> 01:10:22,297
The retainers of the
Shogun of the Dark are waiting.

619
01:10:23,341 --> 01:10:27,334
Leave Jubei to me.
Upon my honor, I will not fail.

620
01:10:28,546 --> 01:10:32,312
Please grant me this one wish.

621
01:10:36,054 --> 01:10:37,817
Very well then. Go.

622
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:09,709
Stay out of this. Don't shame me
any more than you already have.

623
01:11:12,356 --> 01:11:13,880
So, you are Gemma?

624
01:11:14,425 --> 01:11:17,952
The Mochizuki clan
suspect nothing, correct?

625
01:11:18,062 --> 01:11:19,893
Yes. All is well.

626
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:24,400
You've done a splendid job.
I admire you Devils of Kimon.

627
01:11:24,502 --> 01:11:27,369
The Shogun of the Dark
will be pleased.

628
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:02,630
Writhe in pain before you die.

629
01:12:38,509 --> 01:12:41,410
Yurimaru seems to have
suffered some ill fortune!

630
01:12:41,512 --> 01:12:44,970
How careless of him
to have fallen into my trap.

631
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:49,146
It was your own fault,
Yurimaru.

632
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:53,989
Let's go.

633
01:12:56,827 --> 01:12:57,816
Kagero!

634
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:09,837
Hang on! Kagero!

635
01:13:13,544 --> 01:13:14,841
Jubei...

636
01:13:15,246 --> 01:13:16,838
I told you not to come.

637
01:13:18,216 --> 01:13:21,845
I wanted... to apologize...

638
01:13:25,223 --> 01:13:27,623
It was the first time...

639
01:13:27,725 --> 01:13:31,456
You didn't treat
me like a ninja woman...

640
01:13:31,562 --> 01:13:34,861
...but like
a normal woman.

641
01:13:35,733 --> 01:13:39,499
I knew I was becoming attracted
to you, and I was afraid.

642
01:13:39,604 --> 01:13:43,870
So I tried to push you away.
Forgive me...

643
01:13:46,544 --> 01:13:49,877
I don't care
what you think of me!

644
01:13:51,249 --> 01:13:55,879
If for an antidote... or out
of pity... I don't care...

645
01:13:56,587 --> 01:13:59,886
I just wish... that
you'd made love to me.

646
01:14:06,931 --> 01:14:11,163
I was stupid... and weak.

647
01:14:11,269 --> 01:14:14,568
Why couldn't I have
been more honest?

648
01:14:14,905 --> 01:14:18,568
Enough.
Don't say any more!

649
01:15:07,291 --> 01:15:12,957
Jubei...
I'm glad... I met you...

650
01:16:47,091 --> 01:16:52,688
Gemma, with the gold's help
our dream will soon be reality.

651
01:16:52,797 --> 01:16:53,821
"Our" dream?

652
01:16:53,931 --> 01:16:56,866
Our great dream to
topple the Shogunate...

653
01:16:56,967 --> 01:16:59,936
...and restore the reign
of the House of Toyotomi.

654
01:17:00,037 --> 01:17:01,937
You don't understand...

655
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:05,736
How we, the former retainers
of Toyotomi, have suffered.

656
01:17:05,843 --> 01:17:09,438
Now it'll be the Tokugawa who
suffer the agony and torment.

657
01:17:09,547 --> 01:17:12,414
We'll use the gold to buy the
most advanced weapons from Spain...

658
01:17:12,516 --> 01:17:15,383
...and defeat the
Tokugawa government.

659
01:17:15,486 --> 01:17:19,752
That is the dream of all of us who
work for the Shogun of the Dark.

660
01:17:20,558 --> 01:17:21,752
Nonsense.

661
01:17:23,561 --> 01:17:24,755
What did you say?!

662
01:17:24,862 --> 01:17:26,727
I said nonsense.

663
01:17:26,831 --> 01:17:29,800
Hold your tongue!
You're a mere ninja!

664
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,765
My dream is different.

665
01:17:31,869 --> 01:17:34,736
The gold isn't going
to the Shogun of the Dark.

666
01:17:34,839 --> 01:17:35,564
What?!

667
01:17:35,573 --> 01:17:37,803
We, the Devils of Kimon,
will take the gold.

668
01:17:37,908 --> 01:17:39,341
You impudent!

669
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:45,811
I'll use it to organize the most
powerful army of ninja ever.

670
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:50,649
And we'll rule the country with
terror and power from the shadows.

671
01:17:50,754 --> 01:17:53,416
Anyone who opposes me,
Tokugawa or Toyotomi...

672
01:17:53,524 --> 01:17:56,550
...even the Shogun of the Dark
himself, shall die.

673
01:17:58,195 --> 01:18:02,222
Meaning the true Shogun
of the Dark... will be me.

674
01:18:19,617 --> 01:18:25,487
Well now, you're here!
I was just wishing you'd come.

675
01:18:25,589 --> 01:18:26,556
I'm glad to hear that.

676
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:28,690
Of course.

677
01:18:28,792 --> 01:18:32,057
Without your help, sinking
a big ship like this...

678
01:18:33,297 --> 01:18:35,265
...would be impossible!

679
01:18:40,671 --> 01:18:41,695
Pathetic old fool!

680
01:18:43,307 --> 01:18:44,706
Over here.

681
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:55,952
What's wrong?

682
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:59,885
Fire in the hold!
We're gonna sink!

683
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,548
Idiot!
Put out the fire!

684
01:19:01,659 --> 01:19:03,923
Impossible!
It's a sea of flame!

685
01:19:04,028 --> 01:19:06,519
Put it out! Fight it!

686
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:08,621
Move it! Move it!

687
01:19:09,133 --> 01:19:11,431
Forget it! Run!

688
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:20,206
Master Gemma!

689
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:22,903
Pass this message to everyone:

690
01:19:23,013 --> 01:19:28,212
"Abandon ship and hide yourselves.
I'll call for you someday."

691
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:29,286
Go.

692
01:20:08,859 --> 01:20:10,349
Gemma!

693
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:15,790
I see you brought back some
devils from your trip to hell.

694
01:20:24,274 --> 01:20:25,969
Kibagami Jubei...

695
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:29,443
I should've finished you
with my own hands.

696
01:20:29,813 --> 01:20:32,475
Stop your whining.
It's too late.

697
01:20:34,385 --> 01:20:37,980
You want to avenge
the ninja girl Kagero?

698
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:41,182
She was trash in comparison
to what I've lost.

699
01:20:45,229 --> 01:20:47,129
You alone I can't forgive!

700
01:21:40,684 --> 01:21:44,347
I won't kill you yet.
Not before I make you suffer.

701
01:21:44,455 --> 01:21:46,446
I'll make you pay
for smashing my dream.

702
01:21:46,824 --> 01:21:51,454
Your dream? That you were going
to be the true Shogun of the Dark?

703
01:21:52,429 --> 01:21:53,987
Don't make me laugh.

704
01:21:54,698 --> 01:21:59,465
If you became shogun, you'd
make this a world of devils.

705
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:01,967
If you enjoy
their company so much...

706
01:22:02,506 --> 01:22:04,974
...then go back to hell!

707
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:23,683
I'll kill you!

708
01:22:27,197 --> 01:22:29,165
No one can kill me.

709
01:22:33,604 --> 01:22:36,505
You of all people
should know by now...

710
01:22:39,676 --> 01:22:42,577
I am immortal.

711
01:22:45,516 --> 01:22:47,507
Is that so?

712
01:23:02,199 --> 01:23:06,101
If you keep coming
back to life...

713
01:23:06,203 --> 01:23:10,003
...then I'll kill you as
many times as it takes!

714
01:24:21,912 --> 01:24:23,345
You fool!

715
01:25:12,696 --> 01:25:15,529
GEMMA! HERE YOU DIE!

716
01:26:14,057 --> 01:26:15,354
Jubei!

717
01:26:15,459 --> 01:26:20,021
You seem to be rid of the
poison, thanks to Kagero.

718
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:23,031
The combination of a poison-
tasting ninja girl and...

719
01:26:23,133 --> 01:26:27,001
...a talented lone wolf worked out
even better than I had planned.

720
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:28,731
Go away.

721
01:26:32,943 --> 01:26:37,676
By the way, I'm sorry about
losing Kagero. A real pity, that!

722
01:26:37,781 --> 01:26:40,648
But for a scant few moments,
she was able to...

723
01:26:40,751 --> 01:26:44,118
...be an ordinary girl
and make love with you.

724
01:26:44,788 --> 01:26:47,018
Was that part
of your plan, too?

725
01:26:47,124 --> 01:26:49,649
Exactly. To read and
control peoples' hearts...

726
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,126
...is the true secret
of the ninja.

727
01:26:53,764 --> 01:26:58,394
Still, only true sincerity
can move the human heart.

728
01:26:58,502 --> 01:27:01,403
A twisted old bastard
like me couldn't do it.

729
01:27:01,505 --> 01:27:05,305
You're a hell of a guy.
I really admire you.

730
01:27:05,409 --> 01:27:08,037
As promised, I'll be waiting in
Edo with your 100 gold pieces.

731
01:27:08,145 --> 01:27:10,113
Come and get it,
if you're still alive.

732
01:27:17,154 --> 01:27:20,385
That makes us even.
Now never cross my path again.

733
01:27:21,491 --> 01:27:25,086
You've beaten me. I thought I'd
shut your mouth in Edo, but...

734
01:27:25,195 --> 01:27:29,359
Still, in your condition you likely
won't even make it to the shore.

735
01:27:29,466 --> 01:27:32,128
Everything will end
just as I planned.

736
01:28:17,948 --> 01:28:22,681
Come with me, let's go
out to see the stars.

737
01:28:24,354 --> 01:28:29,519
Evening has only just begun.

738
01:28:30,527 --> 01:28:36,362
I don't want anything,
only for you...

739
01:28:36,867 --> 01:28:42,770
...to be at my side,
a smile on your face.

740
01:28:43,273 --> 01:28:48,040
A distant summer,
the two of us alone...

741
01:28:49,713 --> 01:28:55,208
Sitting on the beach
we used to walk.

742
01:28:55,852 --> 01:29:01,755
Trying to retrieve
the gentleness...

743
01:29:02,259 --> 01:29:06,889
...that we left behind.

744
01:29:08,598 --> 01:29:14,433
A distant ballad sung
to no one at all...

745
01:29:14,938 --> 01:29:19,898
I can still
hear it even now.

746
01:29:21,244 --> 01:29:27,149
It embraces
my wandering heart...

747
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:33,246
...just like the cool night wind.

748
01:29:59,182 --> 01:30:03,949
Looking at you,
only you...

749
01:30:05,455 --> 01:30:10,950
...saying things
hard for us to say.

750
01:30:11,661 --> 01:30:17,461
Times may have changed,
but I know...

751
01:30:17,968 --> 01:30:22,803
...my feelings are
still the same for you.

752
01:30:24,374 --> 01:30:30,209
A distant ballad sung
to no one at all...

753
01:30:30,714 --> 01:30:35,651
I can still
hear it even now.

754
01:30:36,953 --> 01:30:42,892
It embraces
my wandering heart...

755
01:30:42,993 --> 01:30:48,991
...just like the cool night wind.
