1
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,700
Ladies and gentlemen!

2
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,100
Please welcome the man who knows
what you're gonna do before you do it!

3
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,100
The amazing,
Frank Cadillac!

4
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,400
This is for the world peace.

5
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,400
Good evening. Welcome to the
beautiful downtown Las Vegas.

6
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,300
How many people are here
from the orient? Raise your hands.

7
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,700
You, sir...
Where are you from?

8
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,400
No, wait, wait...
Don't tell me.

9
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,200
I'm sensing,
you must have soul.

10
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,300
You're a soul man.

11
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,200
Why don't you share with
everyone where are you from?

12
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,900
- Korea.
- How about that, folks?

13
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,800
May I assume
this charming young lady...

14
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,400
...is your daughter?
- She is my wife!

15
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,800
Well, of course she is!

16
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,600
What happens in
Vegas stays in Vegas.

17
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,700
- What's your name?
- Yhun-Kihong.

18
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,100
Yhun-Kihong.

19
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,800
Would you be kind enough to join
me up on the stage please?

20
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,900
Are you serious about this guy?
This is a joke?

21
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
Going behind some mimes
and clowns while we're in it?

22
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,500
Yhun-Kihong.

23
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,800
What if I told you that
that pretty necklace your wearing...

24
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,400
...has a broken catch and on my count
of three, will fall in your drink.

25
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,700
Wouldn't that be something?
Wouldn't that just blow your mind?

26
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,600
- Yeah.
- Yes. Wouldn't it blow all your minds!

27
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,100
Three, two, one...

28
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
...now.

29
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,100
Somebody said "spooky"?

30
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,000
Wait a minute, look at your glass.
Where did it go?

31
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,600
Yhun-Kihong, why don't you
look inside my pocket?

32
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,200
Reach in. Dig deep.

33
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Let's have a big hand
for Yhun-Kihong.

34
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Well... that's magic folks.
And that's why I'm here.

35
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,600
You've probably seen
a lot of those shows.

36
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,600
Mentalists,
magicians, illusionists...

37
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,500
You'd would be shocked to know
that sometimes...

38
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,100
...not often, but sometimes,
it's the real deal.

39
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,700
Masquerading as an act...

40
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
...hiding behind
a few 50 dollar tricks...

41
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
...hiding in a plain sight.

42
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,600
Because if the magician
doesn't do that,...

43
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
...the alternative is impossible
for others to live with.

44
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,400
Anyway. Wednesday nights
The Back Page doesn't pay very well.

45
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,400
So I gamble.

46
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,700
But I don't play against other people,
only against the house.

47
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,200
So, no mega Jack Pots,
no wash outs.

48
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,100
The idea is to go unnoticed.

49
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,400
That way I can keep coming back.

50
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,200
I'm not a God.

51
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,600
I can't see everyone's future,
only my own.

52
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,100
And only within 2 minutes,...

53
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,200
...except for when I saw her.

54
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,000
But we'll come back to that.

55
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,500
There is no pattern to this guy,
he is all over the map.

56
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,900
He's not counting,
not enough the top of that deck.

57
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Wait a minute.

58
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,300
Isn't it that "Two Bit Magic Act"
that called Back Page.

59
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
- What's his name?
- Cadillac.

60
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,900
Yes, Frank Cadillac.

61
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Is he pulling tricks on us?
Is that legal?

62
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,400
He can't trick the deck.

63
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,300
I'm telling you. That little prick
knows what's coming.

64
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,400
If he's really knocking a system
why's he not betting more.

65
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,300
That's gonna be my second question.

66
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,800
Look at that.
He is looking at us.

67
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
It's like he can hear us.

68
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,400
- What table was that?
- 27.

69
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,300
It's Roybal, send security to table 27!
Coming right now!

70
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
Your bets please.

71
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,700
Here is the thing
about the future.

72
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,700
Every time you look at it,...

73
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
...it changes.

74
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,100
Because you looked at it,...

75
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,900
...and that changes
everything else.

76
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Nine thousand and seventeen.

77
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,800
Empty the drawer.
Move!

78
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,600
Drop the gun, now!

79
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Nine thousand and seventeen.

80
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,800
Drop the gun, step back.

81
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,700
It's his gun.
He's gonna shoot you people.

82
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
Step back,
we'll decide this right now.

83
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,900
What's he doing?

84
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,700
Security the doors, elevators, escalators
every way out of this damn place, now!

85
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Clayman! Seal off the Black Jack tables!
Sullivan, linkup with Roybal!

86
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,600
- We are on the floor! On the floor!
- Bring the view of the cameras!

87
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
That way! This way!

88
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,700
He's right next to
the ten dollars slots. Aisle 14.

89
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,600
There he is! Behind you!
Your left. Turn around!

90
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,900
He's right between you.

91
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,200
He's in the mensroom!
Near the Gameshot! Gameshot!

92
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,500
Davis, where the hell is he?

93
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Black t-shirt, straw hat,
heading towards the entrance.

94
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,100
Come on, let's go.

95
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Call Vegas PD.

96
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,900
He just stole a silver Charger,
tag 585-G4S.

97
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,800
- Drop the gun, step back!
- It's his gun.

98
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,800
He was in the top of gambling bureaux's
wish list about 2 months ago.

99
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,700
And what he does
has nothing to do with luck.

100
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,400
It's a definite ability. Look at him!
He knows exactly what to do not get caught.

101
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,100
Can you explain that to me?

102
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,600
No, I can't explain it, Kelly,
nor do I have the time.

103
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,700
The Russian Federation has a 10 kiloton
nuclear munition, unaccounted for...

104
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
- I understand that.
- I'm not sure you do.

105
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,000
We need every agent available
beating the street.

106
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,000
That bomb was stolen
5 weeks ago.

107
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We have just been informed of it now.

108
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,300
Which means it could be parked
under this truck for all we know.

109
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,800
I need actionable intelligence.

110
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,200
Not paranormals
and bullshit magicians.

111
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,500
With all due respect sir,
this bullshit magician...

112
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,700
...achieved paranormal advanced awareness,
it's statistically impossible.

113
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,900
You let me bring him in,
and you get what you want.

114
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,400
5 days, Kelly.
That's it.

115
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,000
Get me the head of casino security.

116
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,300
- You ROYbal?
- It's RoyBAL.

117
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,100
- Whatever.
- Who are you?

118
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,000
Cavanaugh, take a walk.

119
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,400
Hey, Roybal. This isn't
a pissing contest. Come on.

120
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,100
What did you do?
You bought a new car?

121
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,000
- Stole it.
- Oh, look it is.

122
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,400
20 minutes to walk 20 steps.

123
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,200
Well, that's what you get
from two packs a day.

124
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,700
I got you two sandwiches.

125
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,600
Two sandwiches?
That's plenty grand.

126
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,400
Come on, take it. I love you.

127
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,500
Oh, Jesus.
How can I repay you?

128
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Must be a big
to drive this thing.

129
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,300
Chief Roybal,
Special Agent Ferris.

130
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,900
I'm sure Agent Cavanaugh
has explained to you...

131
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,600
...everything you say is has been
concealed. You only admit...

132
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,000
...it can be used against you.
Do we understand each other?

133
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,100
Sure.

134
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,500
- Tell me about Cris Johnson.
- I don't know who that is.

135
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,200
How about Frank Cadillac?
You chased him in the casino tonight.

136
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
- He stole a car from valet parking.
- Yes, yes I know Cadillac.

137
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
I thought he was cheating us at cards,
the next thing I know...

138
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,100
...he's tackling some guy waving a gun.
- The gun wasn't his.

139
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,800
The man he tackled was
one of the two casino killings in Reno.

140
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,200
He is in custody now.

141
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,300
Come on, I'll show you something.

142
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
You remember this?

143
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,500
Oh, yeah, of course I do.

144
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,900
We were saying that
he was looking right at us.

145
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,900
- How did you get this?
- Now think carefully.

146
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,200
What were you talking about
when he looked up?

147
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,600
We were saying if he has a system
why wasn't he betting more.

148
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,300
You sure you weren't doing
or saying anything else?

149
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,800
Just going down and pick him up...

150
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,700
And right then? That's when
he looked up? Very specific.

151
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,400
That's what I said.
He looked up. Really.

152
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,000
So he doesn't have to be there to do it.
Once you entered his consciousness,...

153
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,100
...he can pick it up.

154
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,000
Is that to work the system?

155
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,000
Thank you.
We're finished.

156
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Done some good here, Mr Roybal.

157
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,300
None of these up for the discussion.
As far as your concerned...

158
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,900
...Chris Johnson never existed.

159
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,300
That's going to be difficult, considering
a hundred cameras saw him at the casino.

160
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,100
Don't worry.
The tapes have been destroyed.

161
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,400
Hey! Is she single?

162
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,300
Chris, you can keep stealin' cars
and have been chasin'...

163
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,800
...but that's not a life.

164
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,700
And you gotta forget this girl
that you keep seeing in your head.

165
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
No, I am not going anywhere
until I meet her.

166
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,600
What supposed
she doesn't show up?

167
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,400
She already did.
At the diner.

168
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,700
10 min. after 8.

169
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,700
You've got a couple of hours.
How about a game of pool?

170
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,600
Alright, Irv.
We'll shoot some pool.

171
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,700
We timed every hand
in the Black Jack.

172
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,900
The longest was 89 seconds
and Jonhson pulled 6 cards 21.

173
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,800
So we know he can stay
at least a minute and a half ahead.

174
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,400
I had a text from a radio
frequency spectrum analysis.

175
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
He came up dry.

176
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,700
He is not receiving
any form of electronic help.

177
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,900
At one point there was a
2 minutes and 16 seconds delay.

178
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
He never backed.
Just got up and walked away.

179
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,500
Maybe 2.16 is too long
and he can't see that far.

180
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,900
Narrows the window
a little bit any way.

181
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
We got him.

182
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,100
Vegas PD got a lo-jack hit
on the stolen vehicle.

183
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,900
Listen.
About that girl.

184
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,400
When you looked at the clock,
did you happen to see a calendar?

185
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,500
Because...

186
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,500
...it could be 10 years
from now she gets hungry.

187
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,000
It's gotta be soon.

188
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,800
I never seen further ahead
than two minutes.

189
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,400
Except for her.

190
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,800
And what do you think
the reason is for that?

191
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,700
I don't know.
Maybe she doesn't scare easy.

192
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,800
Maybe she is the one.

193
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,700
Well, when you get like this...

194
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,400
...there is no talking to you.

195
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,500
- She is almost here.
- What happened to the diner?

196
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,900
Somebody else. A cop.

197
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,800
A cop?
Well, then you gotta go.

198
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,800
Wait, I wanna see how much she knows,
what she wants from me.

199
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,000
Chris Johnson.
Still here huh?

200
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,400
Where else would I be?

201
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,400
Special Agent Ferris.
Next time steal a car without lojack.

202
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,900
Can we speak privately?

203
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,800
It's ok, Irv, go ahead.
Thanks.

204
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,300
I'm sure you know why I'm here.

205
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,400
Cause you're the man who knows
what I'm going to do before I do it. Right?

206
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,800
The show, right. Right.
I saw you there.

207
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,500
- Wonderful. Do you like magic tricks?
- Yeah, yeah I do. Like your...

208
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,800
...magic tricks, clairvoyance,
whatever you callin' it.

209
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,700
Let's talk something hard.

210
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,500
A stolen nucleur munition has being smuggled
into the U.S. and may -in fact- already be here.

211
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,300
I want you to look ahead and tell me
where it is gonna be deployed.

212
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,400
I think you got the wrong guy.
It's a magic act.

213
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,400
You gonna stick with that story.

214
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,400
Because millions of lives are at risk and
you could maybe prevent a major catastrophe.

215
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
On a practical note. We are standing
in front of a stolen vehicle...

216
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,800
...and you are wanted for assault
involving a weapon at the casino.

217
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,800
That was an accident. He had a gun
and he was going to shoot two people...

218
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,600
Yeah?

219
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,600
How did you know that?

220
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,900
The deed goes unpunished, does it?

221
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,700
I can fix your legal problems
but first you gotta step up...

222
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,900
...otherwise your next magic show
is gonna be in Fulsom State Prison.

223
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,200
It's ironic but...

224
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,900
...people like you who try to help
had been torturing me.

225
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,400
In the full sense of the word
since I was 3 years old.

226
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,500
What do they call it?

227
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,600
Oh, yeah.
Observed play therapy.

228
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,200
Featuring a marathon 36 hours...

229
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,400
..."can you guess
the next flash card" game?

230
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,500
So, please,
leave me alone...

231
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,200
...and let me live
some semblence of a normal life.

232
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,700
I would love to indulge
your feelings. But I'm dealing...

233
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
...with a slightly larger picture
right now.

234
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Now you can exercise your responsibility
to help your fellow men...

235
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,600
...or I will exercise that
responsibility for you.

236
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,200
You're right, I gotta go.

237
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,300
He's gone, right?

238
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,100
I missed him by seconds tonight.

239
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,500
Excuse me honey,
can you get off my car?

240
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah. Thank you. Jesus.

241
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,600
- Sr. ROYbal?
- It's RoyBAL. Can I help you man?

242
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,200
I have a few questions
if this is a good time?

243
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,100
Gaming Commission is after hours,
you guys should be in a strip club, come on.

244
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
What can you tell us
about Chris Johnson?

245
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
I don't know
who your talking about.

246
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
Let me rephrase the question.

247
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,500
- Here you go, honey.
- Thanks.

248
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,500
Excuse me.
Hello!

249
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,400
I noticed you're alone too.
Do you mind if I join you?

250
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,800
Actually I do.

251
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,200
Sorry to bother you but I have
a question about the coffee,...

252
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,800
...the bean they use...

253
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,700
Isn't that something you should
probably ask your waitress?

254
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,800
Yes, it is.

255
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,400
Excuse me, do you have a light?

256
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,600
I don't smoke.

257
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,500
- Here you go, honey.
- Thanks.

258
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Please. Don't.

259
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,500
- Hi, Liz.
- Did you follow me here Kendal?

260
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,100
No, no. I just thought
we could talk.

261
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
You know we got
really nothing to talk about.

262
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
And I told you that
3 weeks ago.

263
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,900
Liz, come on. I had an off day,
just give me another shot.

264
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,300
It's not gonna happen, OK?
So maybe you should just go.

265
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,600
Do you know how hard
it was to find you?

266
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,100
I was at your apartment,...

267
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,600
...I tried the Starbox in Lexington,
I was at the dry cleaner...

268
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,100
All I'm asking for is a few minutes
of your time, so we can work things out!

269
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,100
Ok, Jesus!
You're stalking me now.

270
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,300
Don't! Don't say that, please.
That's a terrible thing to say...

271
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,000
Let go of me, Kendal.

272
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Look, I just... I thought we can talk.
You know, maybe we can take a drive...

273
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
...and now your ruining it.

274
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,700
Your hurting me.

275
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Kendal?
I think your having another off day.

276
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,500
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her future.

277
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,700
Really?

278
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,200
Hi, my name is Chris.

279
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,600
You okay, Kendal?

280
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,100
The thing is I feel connected to you
and I don't know the reason why.

281
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,500
Now listen.

282
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,700
I think it's only fair that
you pay for the lady's breakfast.

283
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,400
What are you having?
Pecan pies are amazing.

284
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,500
Excuse me.
I can pay for my own breakfast.

285
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,800
And you know what?
You two, work things out.

286
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,000
Your hurting me.

287
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,500
Kendal?
I think your having another off day.

288
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her future.

289
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,000
Really?

290
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,100
Incoming.

291
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,900
- God damn it, Kendal!
- What? Don't point at me. This is your fault.

292
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,200
Get out of here!
Will somebody please call the cops?

293
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm so sorry.
Are you OK?

294
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,700
Let me help you.

295
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,500
Come on, let's get you
cleaned up.

296
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Come on.

297
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,900
OK.

298
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,100
- I'm seeing some stars.
- Yeah?

299
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,100
I am Liz.

300
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,200
Chris.

301
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,600
You must have a death wish
getting involved in that.

302
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,900
- Here. Just...
- OK.

303
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,600
OK. Hold it there.

304
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,200
- Feel a bit.
- OK.

305
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,100
- It well.
- What well?

306
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,500
Your luck.
It's gonna change.

307
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,800
What are you?
A leprechaun?

308
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Do leprachaun's get punched in the face
or have their car stolen?

309
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,900
- Your car was stolen?
- Yeah.

310
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
I'm hoping they find it today.

311
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,000
Supposed to be in Flagstaff.

312
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,400
Hey, is this tooth loose here?

313
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
I don't know.
I don't think so.

314
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,000
It hurts.

315
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,300
Listen, maybe I can give you a ride.

316
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,700
- I'm gonna go that way.
- That would really be helpful, Liz.

317
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,800
Thank you.

318
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,700
- I do have to make a stop though.
- It's OK.

319
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,800
And it may take a few hours,
so cool with that?

320
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,600
Hey, look. If you're uncomfortable
with this all, I'll take a bus.

321
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,100
No, no, no. It's fine, it's fine.
You're not a psycho.

322
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,500
Right?

323
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Because the first psycho vibrate
you're out of the car.

324
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
- OK. Yes Ma'am.
- OK.

325
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,000
Deal.

326
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,700
Deal.

327
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,400
It's amazing. Wasn't it?

328
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,300
I end up in a diner where you are
and both heading in the same direction.

329
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
I don't know if I can call
that amazing, but...

330
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,000
Destiny.

331
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,800
That's what it really is.

332
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,500
OK. I'm starting to get
that psycho voice.

333
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,000
Ah, no...
You don't believe in destiny?

334
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,300
Well, even if it does exist,
I don't think I want to know.

335
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,600
I mean if every move we make
is pre-ordained and...

336
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,300
...what is the point of that
life is supposed to be a surprise?

337
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Isn't it?

338
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,900
It would be nice.

339
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,100
Yeah.

340
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,800
So he came in twice a day
for a week at exactly 9 past 8?

341
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,300
Yeah, he would stay a few minutes,
have a martini and then he'd go.

342
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,700
Until today
when he met that lady.

343
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,800
Did you find anything strange
about that?

344
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,200
Not strange enough
to call the police.

345
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,200
We got a regular who counts
the cornflakes in his bowel...

346
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,300
...it has to be an even number.

347
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,200
- Got any cameras?
- Inside? No.

348
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,500
Outside?

349
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,700
No.

350
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,800
Noticed what kind of car
he was driving...

351
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,400
...maybe overhear
where they were going?

352
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,500
I don't know what car but
they were heading up Flagstaff.

353
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,300
- Flagstaff?
- That's what they said.

354
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,000
Got another regular. She's always on a diet.
Brings in a scale to weigh the salad dressing.

355
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

356
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,200
Guy knows we are after him,
he still risks coming here.

357
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
8 or 9. Twice a day.

358
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,600
He didn't know if it's day or night,
just the time. He was waiting for her.

359
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,200
Alright. There is a traffic cam
over there, the bank,...

360
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,700
...7-11 across the street.
Run all the tapes. We will get lucky...

361
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,100
...and catch them at the wide.

362
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,700
Hey, remember Roybal,
the casino chief?

363
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,400
He had his throat cut last night
after getting a knee cap shot off.

364
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,100
You're telling me this now?
We just talked him about Johnson.

365
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,700
- Hey, I just found out.
- Alright.

366
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,400
- Local weapon?
- Dead end.

367
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,300
Forensic's came up emtpy.
Not a hair or a fibre.

368
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,100
Somebody wants information.
Now, next time anything happens...

369
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,000
...relevant to Johnson,
I want to know right away.

370
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,500
- I don't care if it's a paper cut.
- OK, boss.

371
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,200
The head of casino security.
What did you learn from him?

372
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,500
For a macho guy,
he screams like a girl.

373
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,100
He was questioned by federal agents,
looking for Chris Jonhson. Yes?

374
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,300
He said
they hadn't found him yet.

375
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,900
Do you believe this shit?

376
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,900
He can see things
before they happen?

377
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,600
It makes no difference
what I believe.

378
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,500
Look, we spent two years
setting this up.

379
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,200
And that man out there is worried
all this will be comprimised by Johnson.

380
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,900
We're wasting our time
looking for some magician.

381
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,400
We are being paid to secure
the operations, Jones...

382
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
...not to hunt down some
carnival barmy.

383
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
Really?

384
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,000
Then why are the same authorities that
are looking for us so interested in him?

385
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,400
Get rid of him.

386
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Do it now.

387
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,300
Hi.

388
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,900
We have a super reservation.
I teach here once a week.

389
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,900
The conditions are pretty lousy.

390
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,400
But it's in the Canyon.
One of the eight wonders of the world.

391
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,900
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Liz.

392
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,400
A couple hundred years ago
this tribe was booming.

393
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Plenty of food and thriving culture.

394
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,700
They should be better off
but I guess this is just their destiny.

395
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,900
I would like to meet there shaman.

396
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,400
I read once that in the many
North American tribes...

397
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,600
...their shamans purpose
wasn't only healing.

398
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,100
But they also claim
their power of the atmosphere.

399
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,300
To bring on or stop rain...

400
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,400
...even though future advance.

401
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,200
Do you think that's possible?

402
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,600
I believe any thing is possible.

403
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,200
Me too.

404
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,000
- Whose birthday?
- One of my students.

405
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,200
Hi.

406
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,000
How is it going?

407
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,000
Hello, how is everybody?
Good?

408
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,400
That's good.

409
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,300
That, that was a lot good.
But you messed up on the last part.

410
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
On the last part, yeah.

411
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,000
I thought you weren't coming back
til next monday.

412
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,500
Well I'm not, but it's Jake's birthday.
How could I miss that?

413
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,100
Who is that man you're with?

414
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,200
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No, no, he's not my boyfriend.

415
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,600
He's just my friend.

416
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,600
I think he likes you.

417
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,400
Why did you say that?

418
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,600
Because he looks at you like
my brother looks at his girlfriend.

419
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,200
Hey, Jake.
Do you want to see some magic?

420
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,800
I'll show you something.
Come here.

421
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,400
I found this rock out
in the Canyon.

422
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,100
And I want you to hold it
because it's a magic rock. That's right.

423
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,800
Hold it really tight,
keep squeezing.

424
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,200
It's magic.

425
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,000
It won't bite.
Happy birthday.

426
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,500
So you're a magician?

427
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,100
Well.

428
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,600
I have a small magic act
back in Vegas.

429
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,800
Frank Cadillac show.

430
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,000
- I thought your name was Chris.
- It is.

431
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,500
Frank Cadillac is my stage name.

432
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,900
How did you come up with that?

433
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,700
I picked two things I really like
and I put them together.

434
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,700
Frankenstein and Cadillacs.

435
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,300
You're odd.

436
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,100
Charming.

437
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,100
But odd.

438
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,900
Cease fire!
Get out of the range!

439
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,500
Nice.

440
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,300
A little closed, huh?

441
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,800
OK.

442
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,300
You were right about
the traffic cam.

443
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,700
We got a positive ID.

444
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,700
I'm sorry.

445
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,300
Don't be sorry.
It's OK.

446
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,300
- Did I drop?
- Drop?

447
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,000
- Yeah.
- Ah, no.

448
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,900
- God! It's coming down so hard.
- Yeah.

449
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I like rain.

450
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
I like rain too.

451
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,000
Do you know once,
I think was in Denmark,...

452
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,700
...it rained fish.

453
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,300
Because the sun
dehydrated the water.

454
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,600
Took it out in the atmosphere.

455
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,200
Rehydrated the fish eggs,
and they hatched...

456
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
...and rained fish.

457
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,300
Is it truth?

458
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,700
Yes, in the clouds. True story.
Happened 50 years ago.

459
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,700
Just felt like sharing
that way to you.

460
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,900
The road washed out ahead.
You can't cross until morning.

461
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,300
Not even if it rains like this.

462
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Spin around and go back about
two miles, take your second left...

463
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,200
...there will be a motel they called...
- Cliffhanger. Thanks.

464
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,500
Right.

465
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Him right?

466
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
That's it.

467
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
There is no front plate,
where is the other side?

468
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,600
I don't have it.

469
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,700
What was that at the front window?
Go back. Back, back.

470
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Back, there!
Zoom in.

471
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,000
It's a permit.

472
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,400
Track it and find her.

473
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
I'll light a fire.

474
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,300
Chris, one little problem.

475
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,500
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm gonna sleep in the car.

476
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,300
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

477
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,600
Sure.

478
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,600
Hey, did you hear the joke about
the zen master who ordered a hot dog?

479
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,700
No.

480
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,000
He said he would have
one with everything.

481
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Good night.

482
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Good night.

483
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,700
What do we have?

484
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,500
They're in the Cliffhanger Motel
outside Flagstaff.

485
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,400
We found an Arizona foreman
who remembers the land cruiser.

486
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,600
How did they do that?

487
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,000
The road was floaded and he was
about to suggest a place to stay.

488
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,200
- But Johnson already knew, right?
- Exactly.

489
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,200
Callie, it just got worse.

490
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,100
All right people,
we got a nuclear alert. Code red.

491
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,600
In the southern California region.
L.A. to San Diego, 95% certainly.

492
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,100
Nuclear emergency search teams
are on the way, but until they get here...

493
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,200
...somebody please tell me what
my agency, the FBI is doing about it?

494
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,700
Well, sir, two main suspects
have been interrogated.

495
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,600
Cars and primacies
have been checked.

496
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,900
We have opened up surveillance on 2 or 3
suspects but nothing actionable yet.

497
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,600
All was that we are doing?
Waiting for something actionable?

498
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,000
There are 8 million lives
that are precaurious at best...

499
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,800
...so I say we widen this net
to slightly suspicious...

500
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,000
...and get some decent Intel before
this nuke blows up Los Angeles.

501
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,300
Alright, Callie.
What do you propose we do next?

502
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
I believe that
the urgency of the situation...

503
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,000
...compels the use of any and
all resources to obtain Chris Johnson.

504
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,400
We know where he is.
Let my team pick him up.

505
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,100
The FBI are mobilizing.
Continue watching.

506
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,300
- Did you have the image?
- Yes.

507
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,200
He said they're mobilising.

508
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,200
Standard procedure
when security is escalated.

509
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,500
Tell him to wrap it up.
They'll lead us straight to Johnson.

510
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,700
- Don't lose sight of them. Understand?
- OK, certainly.

511
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
You hungry? There is
a coffee shop down the road.

512
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,900
I'd rather eat here,
if that's OK.

513
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Sure.

514
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,000
What?

515
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,200
There is an Italian painter
named Carlatti.

516
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
And...

517
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,300
...he...

518
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,000
...defined beauty.

519
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,200
He said it was
a summation of the parts...

520
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,000
...working together
in such a way that...

521
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,600
...that nothing needed
to be added.

522
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,900
Taken away or altered.

523
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,400
That's you.

524
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,700
You're beautiful.

525
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,300
That was incredible.

526
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,700
What was?

527
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
This.

528
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,400
Over here. This is a good stand,
our position had a good view of the motel.

529
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,000
We'll put our removable area surveillance,
this formation, over here and that turn off.

530
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,000
A team with a parabolic step
right here.

531
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,300
That's fine, but I also want
mobile surveillance,...

532
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,300
...get me 2 or 3 hummers.
If they run on us, I wanna be flexible.

533
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,600
Ferris.

534
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Call the local police in Flagstaff.
Tell them patrol the outside perimeter.

535
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,300
I want that area locked down.

536
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,700
A body turned up at an apartment,
in line of sight of my office...

537
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,500
A slit throat, like Roybal.

538
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,400
Somebody trying
to follow us to Johnson.

539
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,300
Chris?

540
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,500
Yeah?

541
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,600
Maybe there is
such a thing as destiny.

542
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,500
Give her 40 seconds.

543
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,300
So after two minutes, he just
stop seeing what's gonna happen?

544
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,600
Not sure, I hope so.

545
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,400
- Elizabeth Cooper?
- Yeah.

546
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,000
Federal Agent Ferris.

547
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,000
- What is this about?
- I'm gonna need a few minutes of your time.

548
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,900
Yeah, OK.

549
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,800
They are putting her in the car.

550
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,500
- Drop the gun, step back!
- It's his gun. He's gonna shoot you people.

551
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,000
This was 3 days ago?

552
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,400
He used you to get away
from Las Vegas.

553
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,400
You can be pretty sure,
everything he told you...

554
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,700
...is a lie. He's delusional.
A sociopath.

555
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,000
Oh, my God.

556
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,700
My God.

557
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,500
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

558
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,800
Go back to the motel. Have a drink.
Put one of these in his glass.

559
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,200
It'll take 5 minutes to put him to sleep,
then we will come in and get him.

560
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Nobody is being hurt.

561
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,900
But this is important, you need
to do it at least 2 minutes...

562
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,600
...after you get him out of the room.

563
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,700
Why do you need me?
Why can't you just get him?

564
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,300
Liz, as I understand that you work
for a federal founding program...

565
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,300
...teaching on a native reservation,
is that true?

566
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,900
Yes, that's true.

567
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,100
Well, I think you're here to help us.
We are on the same team.

568
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,600
Now they letting her go.

569
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,000
- Thanks for the note.
- Sure.

570
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,700
- Get a nice walk?
- I did. You know, it's really beautiful here.

571
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,900
Ah! I'm...
I have a present for you.

572
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,100
Ah, thanks.
I need that.

573
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Yeah.

574
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,000
Is something wrong?

575
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,400
Oh, no, no. I'm fine.
Now, why don't you go wash up...

576
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,200
...I'm gonna make us breakfast.
- OK.

577
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,600
45 seconds.

578
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,200
1 minute 30.

579
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,400
And that's 2.

580
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,500
- Looks good.
- You think so?

581
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Thank you.

582
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,000
Don't drink that!
It's drugged.

583
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,700
Oh, God, I don't know what I'm doing!
I don't know what I'm doing.

584
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,300
Some federal agent came up to me and
said that you are a delusional sociopath.

585
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,500
And they showed me this tape.

586
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,600
So maybe you are
but I don't want to believe that.

587
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,100
I don't think I can believe that.

588
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,400
They also said that if you run
they will shoot you.

589
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,700
So I should drug you instead.

590
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,200
Even if what they said is true,
I don't want you to die.

591
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,700
I don't want you to die.

592
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,100
Chris, is it true?

593
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,700
Oh, shit!

594
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,400
Give me broadband noise reduction,
I don't like to hearing this.

595
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,300
Speak quietly and act normally.

596
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
How long they have said
this drugs will take?

597
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,400
About 5 minutes.

598
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,400
- What is he doing?
- He's drinking. Give it a minute.

599
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,200
Got a clean shot?

600
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,600
Not yet.

601
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,700
The man that in the casino
would have killed two people.

602
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,600
It happened,
it just hadn't happen yet.

603
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,400
Oh, my God,
you're delusional.

604
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,900
Fluffy cranberry or a stack of
chocolate pancakes for the kids.

605
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,900
Fluffy Cranberry or a stack of chocolate
cheap pancakes for the kids in a...

606
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,500
Safe?
Who knows what's safe?

607
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,600
I know a man dropped dead
from looking at his wife.

608
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,300
Safe?
Who knows what's safe?

609
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,500
I know a man dropped dead
from looking at his wife.

610
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,500
You can't get lost in the woods,
if you never go in to the woods.

611
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,000
You can't get lost in the woods,
if you never go in to the woods.

612
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,300
Boy, you got
an answer for everything.

613
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,600
That's right sir. You're the only person
authorised to do so.

614
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,700
That's right sir. You're the only person
authorised to do so.

615
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,000
- How are you doing this?
- I have no idea how...

616
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,400
...but I can.
I was born with it.

617
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,000
- This is some kind of a trick?
- You know we don't have time for that.

618
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,600
You said anything is possible.

619
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,100
So, you see things
before they happen.

620
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,900
- You see the future?
- My future,...

621
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,500
...when it affect me
and only 2 minutes ahead.

622
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,100
Excepting you.
For some reason I saw you.

623
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,300
For some reason I saw you. Far beyond
anything I've ever seen before...

624
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,700
...and I don't know why.

625
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,700
What do you mean,
you saw me?

626
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,100
You have been...
You have been doing that to me?

627
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,300
You know what I'm gonna do
and what I'm gonna say...

628
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,000
...that your just setting me up?
- No, I haven't.

629
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,900
I wanted to find you because
I need to know why I was seeing you.

630
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,100
Because I...

631
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,900
It wasn't a setup.

632
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,100
What are they want from you?

633
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,800
They think I can help them
in matters of national security.

634
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,000
I don't understand if
you can help them why don't you?

635
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,500
Because I can't.

636
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,900
I can only give them
2 minutes ahead start...

637
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,900
...and that's if my life
has personally involved.

638
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,300
- But with me you can see further.
- Yeah.

639
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,300
But they don't know that.

640
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,200
There is almost 10.000 dollars
in this envelope.

641
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,300
They know about you.
You need to get away from here.

642
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
What time do you have?

643
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,600
- 09:10.
- Set your watch 09:17.

644
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,100
Read this when I leave,
and wait exactly...

645
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,000
...45 seconds before
you do what it says.

646
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,500
I will take Ferris with me.

647
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,000
I might be away a week or month...

648
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,800
...but if you can wait,
I'll find you.

649
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,900
Something's wrong.

650
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,800
- Don't do it.
- I already have.

651
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,100
Go, get him!
Alive!

652
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,200
Let's go!

653
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
Son of a bitch!

654
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,200
Chris.

655
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,600
Oh, shit! Run!

656
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,000
Johnson!

657
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,300
You're not gonna shoot.

658
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,000
You gonna let me die?

659
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,100
Hey, I need some help!
Get him out of here.

660
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,400
Let's get him out of here.

661
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,700
I got you.

662
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,500
You alright? You OK?
Open your eyes. Look at me.

663
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,700
No good deed
goes unpunished, does it?

664
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,700
- She got him.
- Now what?

665
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,700
- Did you see her?

666
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,200
Smoke?

667
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,700
Thanks for today.

668
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,200
You didn't let me die.
I appreciate.

669
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
That was a really showed character.

670
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,900
I know, I seem like a bad guy,...

671
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,100
...and all of this but in the interest
to preserving our freedom...

672
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,200
...there are larger issues at play.

673
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,100
- What about my freedom?
- With freedom comes responsibility.

674
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:30,700
- I have rights.
- This isn't about you.

675
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,500
This is about 8 million other people.

676
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,000
If I do what you want,
you will keep me in this chair forever.

677
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,800
There is a nuclear bomb
somewhere in Los Angeles.

678
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,400
And every television station
in the world will broadcast...

679
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:53,800
...precise details of it's detonation. So go on,
push that two minutes as far as you can...

680
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,800
...and find it.

681
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,300
...broadcast this afternoon for a
breaking news downtown in Los Angeles.

682
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,100
...the largest technology corporations opposed
this idea. And tech lobyying is blame for...

683
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,800
...and members of the LAPD bombsquad
are staging in that area.

684
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,900
We gonna live now, our reporter
Lisa Joiner, at the scene with very latest.

685
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,900
- Lisa? - Jeff, this all began when police
received an anonymous phone call...

686
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:04,500
...saying that explosives would be
detonated at this parking garage...

687
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,200
...at Second and Broadway
at 6 o'clock tonight.

688
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,100
There is no, um...
They have no idea of the motive.

689
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,700
- The victim however...
- Oh, Liz, I'm sorry.

690
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,300
What?

691
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,900
What did you say?

692
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,700
We saw the LAPD surrounded the area.
They've secured a perimeter.

693
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,600
But now the bomb squad
is making there way onto...

694
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,600
...the deck of this building.

695
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,800
And there the men are walking up
with black suit on the sight.

696
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,900
Oh, my God!

697
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,200
There... There has been an explosion.
There has been an explosion.

698
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,100
Oh, my God.

699
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,000
The victim has been identified
as Elizabeth Cooper of Las Vegas.

700
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,700
And she was strapped
to a wheel chair.

701
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Sorry.

702
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,200
...tax of %10 U.S. workers
receives that options.

703
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Many technology companies will be...

704
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,700
- Tell me what just happened?
- I, I can't.

705
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,600
It won't work like this.

706
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,800
Just get me out of this room
and I will do what you want.

707
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,200
I'm begging you.
Please, get me out of this room.

708
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,200
Let him out.

709
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,600
- Cally! Cally, wait up.
- What?

710
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,100
The residue report of Betty Peterson.

711
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,900
The dead girl in the apartment.
Her throat was cut bleed out,..

712
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,400
...otherwise, nothing to the DNA,
the place immaculate again.

713
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,000
- How did it go with Johnson?
- Something happened...

714
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,600
...but he's not sharing.
There are traces of potassium iodine.

715
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,400
Some medication
Peterson was taking.

716
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,500
- They found an empty pill box.
- No. the only reason to take it is...

717
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,100
...to prevent radiation poisining.

718
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,000
Hey, wait, wait. Can I get a smoke
or something? I need to relax.

719
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Thanks.

720
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,400
Hey, can I get a light?

721
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,600
Look.

722
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,200
Bay 01. Bay 01.
I got a visual.

723
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,300
Target is heading the south route
in the Seen street.

724
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,400
Subject is turning east
onto Broadway.

725
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,800
Stay here.
Let me deal with this.

726
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,000
Why are you here?

727
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,100
They killed her.

728
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,100
Two hours from now.

729
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,800
They killed Liz.

730
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,100
Tell me what you saw.

731
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,400
I saw them execute her.

732
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:25,400
Right there.
On the roof.

733
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,700
It hasn't happened yet
and I know who has her.

734
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,100
The same people we are after.
There is a reason that...

735
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,100
...they brought you here.
They are using Liz as bait.

736
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,000
10 to 1, you go out on that roof,
they are gonna put a bullet in your brain.

737
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,400
I know.

738
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,200
Right now, she is still alive.
She is, you are, we all are.

739
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,100
Let's try to keep it that way.

740
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,200
I help you,
you help me, alright?

741
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:59,200
I want a two mile radius.
Every telephone grid, short waves,...

742
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:04,100
...satellite tower, shut it down.
- What do you want me to do?

743
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,500
Let him shoot you.

744
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,200
You called an unpickable style.
Turn number and dial again.

745
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,100
You called an unpickable style.

746
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:57,400
FBI! Get on your knees!

747
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,900
You OK?
That looked pretty close.

748
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,900
Slide of hand.

749
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,800
- You didn't get him?
- Not alive. He fired on the chopper.

750
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,800
But doesn't matter,
he couldn't call in the hit.

751
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,600
As far as they are concerned,
you're not here yet.

752
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,600
Buys us time.

753
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,600
Everyway I tried,
she still ends up dead.

754
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,000
What if you do it earlier? I think, they'll
have to bring her here in a vehicle, right?

755
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,800
- Looking for a license plate.
- Right.

756
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,100
Can you see it?

757
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,800
It helps if you
don't speak right now.

758
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:47,300
California plate number:
50KF272.

759
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,100
California tag: 50KF272.

760
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,800
Please, where are you taking me?

761
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,400
- OK. Not a problem.

762
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,700
What do you want with me?

763
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,400
Be careful.

764
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,700
Who the hell are you people?

765
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,600
You set them up Cavanaugh?

766
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,500
Local SWAT has been deployed and
the regional team is here to show back us up.

767
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,100
Alright, listen up.
The van, carrying Elizabeth Cooper,...

768
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,800
...will exit the warehouse, crossed over here,
18 compounds, approximately 5 minutes.

769
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,400
4 minutes and 27 seconds.
Do you mind?

770
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,200
- Not anymore. Go ahead.
- They've got a wrap of explosives...

771
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,000
...wired to a cell phone.
- Remote trigger.

772
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,900
When the cell phone has setted off
they'll use one of speed dial.

773
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,800
They will take this road
to the entrance gate.

774
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:53,100
At that point, Alpha and Bravo
will swarm to the entrance...

775
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,100
If you can just be quiet
and do exactly what I say...

776
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,000
...I will save your life.

777
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,300
We needed to stop the vehicle here
before it gets into the gates.

778
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,600
Alpha and Bravo will hold
and contain here,...

779
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:09,000
...sniper teams will initiate on
Johnson's call. On his call. Are we clear?

780
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,800
Our elements
shoot to kill any hostiles.

781
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,800
- What about the intel?
- We don't need them. We have him.

782
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,300
Alright everybody!
Let's go.

783
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,500
Go! Let's go! Move!

784
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,900
Back up! Back up! Back up!

785
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,200
Go, go, go!

786
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,800
- Stop the van.
- Not yet. You'll kill her.

787
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,300
Now!

788
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,100
We gotta go! Now! Now!

789
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,900
Pull back! Pull back!

790
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,500
They've got a gun on the crane,
northeast corner.

791
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,500
Negative, no visual.

792
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,100
Give me that.

793
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,800
The opened door way,
eight inches above the guard rail.

794
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,100
Alright, let's go!

795
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:50,800
The girl escaped.

796
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,400
David, Charlie,
heading the entry point!

797
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,600
Turn right.

798
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:28,900
Clear.

799
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,300
Go! Go! Go!

800
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,400
Come on, let's go!

801
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,400
Round up!
They're coming to round up!

802
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,600
Stop.

803
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,100
No!

804
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,800
Go.

805
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,400
This is Charlie-1,
element clear, over.

806
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Thanks.

807
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:29,800
There is explosives,
there, there and there.

808
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,400
Stay close.

809
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:00,900
- Sniper.
- Where?

810
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,500
- Behind us.
- Sniper at 6 o'clock. Got a visual?

811
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,500
Nobody move.
I'll find him.

812
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,600
Cat walk, second level.

813
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,200
Cat walk, 6 o'clock, second level.

814
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,300
I got him.

815
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:40,000
We have to clear this
deck by deck.

816
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:41,900
You check this one.
I'll do the rest.

817
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,100
Let's sweep and clear.

818
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,600
She is near the engine room.

819
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,300
Come on, man.
Release the hostage...

820
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,700
...if still wanna get out of this.
- Don't patronise me.

821
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,900
- How good are you with that gun?
- Very good.

822
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,300
- You gonna be OK, Liz.
- Back off!

823
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,800
I've seen
every possible ending here...

824
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,200
...none of them are good for you.
- I will take my chances.

825
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,400
One more step fortuneteller
and it definitely won't be good for you.

826
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,700
You have one way out of this.

827
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,000
That wasn't it.

828
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:28,000
Liz, look at me. It's OK.
Look at me. It's over.

829
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:31,900
It's over.

830
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,800
No, it's not.

831
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:42,700
The nucleur device was moved.
We need to find its exact location.

832
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,400
Now, this registers any significant
detonation in the earth's crust.

833
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,600
Take a look.
Tell me what you see.

834
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,200
Something's wrong.

835
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,900
- I made a mistake.
- What?

836
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,800
I made a mistake.

837
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,300
- It's happening.
- When?

838
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,200
Now!

839
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,000
I've got 4 teams in the place,
we just waiting on road group.

840
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,100
Alright.
Ferris.

841
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:55,500
It's me.

842
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,300
I'll do it but I have conditions.

843
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,800
I want her left out of it.

844
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,700
I'm sure we can work
something out.

845
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,300
Liz.

846
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:40,900
Liz.

847
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,800
Come back to bed.

848
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:51,800
I gotta go.

849
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,500
Go where?

850
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:03,600
Something that I have to do.
I can't put it off any longer.

851
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,500
- Are you coming back?
- Yeah.

852
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:27,100
Maybe a week or a month.

853
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,700
But if you can wait
I'll find you.

854
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,600
Here is the thing
about the future.

855
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,600
Every time you look at it,
it changes.

856
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:17,300
Because you looked at it.
And that, changes everything else.

857
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
You ready?

858
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,500
Yeah.
