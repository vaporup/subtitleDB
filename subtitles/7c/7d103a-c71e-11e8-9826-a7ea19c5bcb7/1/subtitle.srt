1
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,920
I am Korean.

2
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,960
I was born in Seoul

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,680
but many people
mistake me for Chinese.

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,360
I am definitely Korean
and my home town is Seoul.

5
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,400
Looking back now,
it seems a long time ago.

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,920
I think it was about
when I was 8 years old.

7
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,440
At that time I was small for my age.

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,800
My father sent me to Taekwondo
lessons with my older brother.

9
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,160
I remember I had very tough training
at those Taekwondo classes.

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,080
Because I was small,

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,120
my father was worried that I would be
bullied by other kids.

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Ever since I have participated
in martial arts.

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,040
When I was about 18 years old,

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,760
Bruce Lee became
very popular worldwide.

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,880
After I saw one of his movies,
I fell in love with his style.

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,640
Because of Bruce Lee,
I entered the action movie industry.

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,160
From that moment,
I exercised hard.

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,240
And I was ambitious
to be an action star like Bruce Lee,

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,840
I managed to get myself
into the movie industry.

20
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,320
I started out in martial arts...

21
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,840
by taking up Taekwondo.

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,600
Then gymnastics, to pursue
my career in the film industry.

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,200
After that I took up Hapkido,
Kung Fu

24
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,440
and all sorts of other martial arts.

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,280
Even now, Bruce Lee remains
my biggest hero and inspiration.

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,160
After I watched Bruce Lee's movie,
I decided to be an action star like him.

27
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,240
Back then, the audience cheered
Bruce Lee really loudly in the cinema.

28
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,960
I was very impressed.

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,560
I wanted to be a martial arts movie star,
so I got into the movie industry.

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Now, I am working in
the Korean movie industry.

31
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,840
In Korea, there are not as many
martial arts action movies

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,960
as there are in Hong Kong.

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,480
I don't think there is a lot of space for
Korean martial arts actors in Korea.

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,880
So I had a lot of difficulties building
my career in this field in Korea.

35
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,280
I think things are a bit different
these days.

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
Things are looking up for
the Korean action movie industry.

37
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,840
Right now, I am also working as
a fight coordinator.

38
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,720
I seldom get the chance to work
as an actor in Korea.

39
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,920
My friends and directors
in Hong Kong

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,240
sometimes call me
to offer me roles.

41
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
Acting and fight coordinating

42
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,720
are both very appealing to me.

43
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,000
As long as my ability continues,
I won't give up these two roles,

44
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,640
and I'd like to do them
for the rest of my life.

45
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,440
For some time, there has been
a trend of changing Hong Kong movies

46
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,080
from martial arts to
Chow Yun-Fat's gun-fighting movies.

47
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,800
The trend continued
for about five years,

48
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,280
and hardly any martial arts
movies were made.

49
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,200
So Golden Harvest Productions
wanted to bring back

50
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,040
traditional martial arts action movies,

51
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,320
and I had heard that they were
looking for someone

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,320
who specialises in side-kicks
and who comes from Korea.

53
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
As soon as I heard that,

54
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,720
I made a demo tape and sent it
to Golden Harvest Productions.

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,280
David Lai and his team from
Golden Harvest Productions

56
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,720
watched my demo tape

57
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,600
and happily gave the role to me.

58
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,640
David Lai and the writer flew over
to Korea and met me for an interview.

59
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
In the original script,

60
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,720
the character was a well-built
and handsome guy,

61
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,720
obviously not like me.

62
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,920
After watching my demo tape,

63
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,560
they changed the script so that
it was tailor-made for me.

64
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,200
I think David and I have
some kind of strong connection

65
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,000
which you can't really explain.

66
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,920
And even he describes
the same thing to me.

67
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,840
When he met me for the first time,

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,080
he felt he'd met me before,
as if in a previous life.

69
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,120
That's what he said and
we both believe this.

70
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,560
In "The Scorpion King" my character
is not an entirely bad person.

71
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,360
Of course, my character's father
is a gangster pimp.

72
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,840
When his adversaries
come to rescue the girls,

73
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,720
my character fights against the men

74
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
who try to attack his father.

75
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,840
Personally speaking,

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,120
I think my character is a guy
who loves his father

77
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,080
and likes to try and protect him.

78
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,440
I think he's a good man.

79
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,320
Of course, my character's father
is a bad man

80
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,800
and my character doesn't like
what his father does.

81
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,600
Character-wise, I like him 100%.

82
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,320
His hairstyle covers one side of
his face and reaches down to here,

83
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,640
and the idea for this appearance
mainly came from David Lai.

84
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,040
The character's appearance,
the movie concept

85
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,400
and my style of martial arts
all fit together very well.

86
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,280
That is...

87
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,360
because the movie's concept
was so good,

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,320
it became extremely successful.

89
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,680
The martial arts coordination in
"The Scorpion King"

90
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,000
wasn't done by just one person.

91
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,000
At first, the fight coordinator
was Yuen Biao

92
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,280
and then it changed to Yuen Tak.

93
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,920
And my martial arts action
was modified by monitoring

94
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,920
my demo tapes
scene-by-scene whenever needed

95
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,440
with input from the director
and fight coordinators.

96
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,880
We'd be like: "Let's do it
this way for this scene",

97
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,040
because certain sidekicks were more
suitable for certain scenes, and so on.

98
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,920
My action is entirely my idea

99
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,120
and the fight coordinating was done
by Yuen Tak, Lau Kar-Leung

100
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,920
and David Lai - all of us directed
the fight scenes.

101
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,320
In the movie, all special sidekicks
which I hadn't performed before,

102
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,920
were developed by me in Korea.

103
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,600
The demo tape
which was made in Korea

104
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,840
was actually very useful when
making the film in Hong Kong.

105
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,440
Talking about Lau Kar-Leung,

106
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,960
even before I went to Hong Kong
I watched his movies

107
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,160
and I was curious about him
and wondered who he was.

108
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,600
When I saw him in person
at Golden Harvest Productions

109
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,560
I was...

110
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,440
rather disappointed.

111
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,400
He's about my height,

112
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,080
and looks, in some way, a bit like
someone from the countryside.

113
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,600
But I was very impressed with him
when we were on location

114
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,040
due to his spirit and professionalism.

115
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,320
When he appeared on location,
he would bring a flask of coffee

116
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,520
and he seemed to drink about
20 cups of coffee

117
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
until shooting
was finished for the day.

118
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
This was to keep himself alert...

119
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,520
so he could show his action style
as much as possible,

120
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,360
and set good examples for younger
actors in the action movie field.

121
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,720
I really respect
his professional attitude.

122
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,840
He is a well-known Kung Fu master
in Hong Kong.

123
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
He's about 60 years old

124
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,160
but his muscle tone and
general fitness level

125
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,640
seem to be like that of...

126
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,400
a 20 or 30 year-old man.

127
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,640
Compared with any other man
younger than him,

128
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,440
he has excellent fighting ability.

129
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,840
I like to call him my "master". He's a
role model for many people in this field.

130
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,160
Watch it! Right foot!

131
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,040
Kar Lok, Chin Kar Lok...

132
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,480
or Chung Ka Rak in Korean,
is a very special friend.

133
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,920
Recently, he was directing a movie

134
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,840
and asked me to be a special guest
in his movie

135
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,680
which was being made
in Hong Kong.

136
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,120
Just thinking about Chung Ka Rak
makes me smile.

137
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,800
He's very funny,
and is a very close friend of mine.

138
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,440
Recently, Chung Ka Rak made
a movie called "No Problem 2".

139
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,800
He offered me a role in the movie
so I went to Hong Kong to do it.

140
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,360
"The Scorpion King" was the beginning
of my life in Hong Kong.

141
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,200
In his own way,
he gave me a lot of advice.

142
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,640
He has been a good friend
ever since.

143
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,560
He has excellent ability in this field,

144
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,440
and used to be an action double for
Jackie Chan's action sequences.

145
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,320
He has good skills
and is easy to work with.

146
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,600
He's always smiling,

147
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,000
and I think he's a very happy person
and enjoys his life.

148
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,240
In "The Scorpion King",
there are mostly action scenes.

149
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,400
I feel that the movie reflects
a lot about myself.

150
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,520
Regarding the action sequences,

151
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,480
even when I went back to Korea
after shooting,

152
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,840
there was hardly any editing done,
just a few scenes added.

153
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,520
So I'm very satisfied with the movie.

154
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,960
One of the episodes at the time...

155
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,720
Almost every time I finished
my action scene,

156
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,600
having pulled it off successfully,

157
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,920
the guy who was my character's
father took me out to nice restaurants

158
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,840
almost every day and bought me
delicious meals.

159
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,400
And David Lai...

160
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,200
took me to fancy bars after shooting
one scene after the other.

161
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,600
They showed me around the town
and gave me a good time.

162
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,120
At the beginning in Hong Kong,
the difficult thing was that

163
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,840
because it was my first time,
I didn't have any translation support.

164
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,760
I only had translation support
at the beginning

165
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,560
and after that,
I had to manage on my own.

166
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,040
Their instructions and my intentions

167
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,000
went totally the opposite way
from each other.

168
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,240
My instruction was to do one thing
but what I did was something else,

169
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,960
and this made everybody laugh.

170
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,640
After completing the movie, I feel...

171
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,880
there were a lot of difficulties.
At the time of shooting,

172
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,840
I wanted to run back to Korea,
because it was that difficult.

173
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,480
But after the shooting,
when I watched the movie,

174
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,440
I felt this was a Hong Kong movie,
different from Korean action movies.

175
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,160
This is a Hong Kong movie
which can survive worldwide

176
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,000
due to all the hard work
that went into it.

177
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,240
I can never forget
"The Scorpion King".

178
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,200
Even in the future,

179
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,800
personally I don't think I could do
a movie as good as this.

180
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,360
I think it is only possible
in Hong Kong.

181
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,320
From the very beginning of pursuing
a career in the film industry,

182
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,000
Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao and Sammo
Hung Kam-bo were my favourites.

183
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,760
The first time I met Yuen Biao,
I felt very excited and tense.

184
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,240
In action scenes with him...

185
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,320
I was very impressed
with his excellent skills.

186
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,760
That's why he is a very popular guy.

187
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,360
He's a team player,
he's very strong,

188
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,960
and is also a really good actor.

189
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,480
Starting with "The Scorpion King",
I lived in Hong Kong for five years.

190
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,360
I felt very rewarded
and have few regrets left.

191
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,280
When shooting movies, the most
important thing is one's health.

192
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,840
When I wasn't filming,

193
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,520
I spent most of my time
training alone.

194
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,240
While I was doing that...

195
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,360
because the food in Hong Kong
was so oily,

196
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,320
I felt the food wasn't right for me
and my health suffered a little bit.

197
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,040
At the end of that year,

198
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,960
I finished "Saviour of the Soul"
with Andy Lau.

199
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,520
And then I went back to Korea
to get married.

200
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,720
I got married and settled in Korea

201
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,320
and after that I didn't have a chance
to go back to Hong Kong.

202
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,920
Based on my Hong Kong experience,

203
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,280
I made up my mind
to build my career in Korea.

204
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,080
Right now...

205
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,960
in Seoul...

206
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,080
I'm working in the Korean
movie business.

207
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,080
In the future,

208
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,160
if there are any good offers as a fight
coordinator or martial arts actor,

209
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,040
I would like to show
something different

210
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,920
that hasn't been shown before
by a fight coordinator,

211
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,680
combining Hong Kong
and Korean action movie styles.

212
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,000
Furthermore...

213
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,680
I'd like to encourage
many junior actors.

214
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,560
I'd also like to get into
the Hollywood market with them.

215
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,080
I also have the desire to be famous
as a Korean action star.

216
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,480
Please wish me well with it.

217
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,280
Thank you for watching me.
