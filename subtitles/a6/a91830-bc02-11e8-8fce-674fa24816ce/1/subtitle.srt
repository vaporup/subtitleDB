1
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
- Come on.
- Central Security Agency.

2
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,535
This is Wallace.

3
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,274
Operation Big Drip
is cresting Level Two.

4
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,645
I need Devlin.
I need him now.

5
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,706
Hold, please.

6
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,717
No, no, don't put me on hold!

7
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:06,616
Mother...

8
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,930
Hello, Agent Wallace.

9
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,992
I need your nine-digit
security code, please.

10
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:27,466
Hello? Agent Wallace?

11
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,099
Agent Wallace?

12
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:34,606
Agua la vista... baby.

13
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,880
Hello, my name's Jimmy Tong

14
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,255
and I was wondering
if there's anything I could say

15
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,284
that would convince you
to have lunch with me.

16
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,524
Oh, Jimmy, you're so cute.

17
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,998
Let's go back to your apartment

18
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,058
and make like... donkey.

19
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,194
You got me nervous again.

20
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,262
It's just a salesgirl.

21
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,865
To you... but to me...

22
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:05,071
I dream of her

23
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,669
before I ever saw her.

24
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,180
No, that there! That!

25
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,181
Shh.

26
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,477
That is the line.

27
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,575
Go tell her that. That line.

28
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,314
Listen.

29
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,446
Hi.

30
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,956
My name is Jimmy Tong.

31
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,085
When I see you,
I have a wet dream.

32
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,094
Is that what I say?

33
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,095
No, no, you know...

34
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,960
just ask her out to lunch now

35
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,091
and later,
we work out that line.

36
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,033
But hurry up, man.
We be wasting time, man.

37
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,228
Come on. We have to drive.

38
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,464
And whatever you do,
do not be yourself.

39
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,908
Just joking.

40
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,612
Thank you so much.

41
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,742
You're welcome. Good-bye.

42
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,290
I can do it.

43
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,730
Hi. My name's Jimmy Tong.

44
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,358
Okay...

45
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,632
Hi.

46
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,007
Hi.

47
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,173
Pretty colors.

48
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:19,115
Will you excuse me
for just one moment?

49
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,414
Okay.

50
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,386
Ah...

51
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,427
Just between us guys...

52
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,397
you don't come around
here for the art, do you?

53
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,593
Who would?

54
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,693
Heh. Yeah.

55
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,671
Uh... let me,
as owner of this gallery

56
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,937
give you a little bit
of friendly advice.

57
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,906
Don't waste any time.

58
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,006
You go over there and
you ask Jennifer out.

59
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,380
You think so?

60
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,783
Yes. That way, she can say no

61
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,312
and we can get on
with our little lives.

62
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,255
Thank you for your advice.

63
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,125
Yeah.

64
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,235
Hello. My name Jimmy Tong.

65
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:17,368
What can I say to convince you
to have lunch with me?

66
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,498
Oh!

67
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,300
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

68
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,635
I'm terr... I didn't...

69
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,209
Come here, you little runt.

70
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,178
Hi. Hello.

71
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,992
Get back here! Come here!

72
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,126
Where'd you go?

73
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,033
Where are you?

74
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,468
Sauer... sauerkraut
or sauercrop?

75
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,994
Sauerkraut?

76
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:26,803
Hey... hey, hey!

77
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,939
Hey! I just washed that car.

78
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,471
What the hell
wrong with you, boy?

79
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,347
Want I jam this in your ass
and break it?

80
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,012
You want a go? Come down here.

81
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,782
Whoa, whoa, wait, oh.
Not too fast.

82
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,153
Not too fast.

83
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,248
Hey, I just want to talk.

84
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,282
Eh, eh, you do that
there, man. You do that.

85
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:43,056
Oh, you're scared now.

86
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,297
Just-just go
and get yourself

87
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,027
some training wheels!

88
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,466
Go get a tattoo of a chicken!

89
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,436
- Go!
- I thought all your people know karate.

90
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,666
Not everybody Chinese
is Bruce Lee.

91
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,699
Just calm yourself, eh,
Jimmy, calm yourself.

92
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,472
Just not my day.

93
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,882
Whoo! Wow.

94
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,714
Do you think you can get me
to 70 Fleming Street?

95
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,084
Of course. Wait a second.

96
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,020
You Jimmy Tong?

97
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,256
That's who I am.

98
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,285
Who are you?

99
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,923
The name is Steena.

100
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,661
So, how come you drive so fast?

101
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,690
More fares.

102
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,396
Mmm. Is that why
you had your license

103
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,405
suspended nine times
for speeding?

104
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,997
But no accidents.

105
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,337
Do you remember where I'm going?

106
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,808
70 Fleming.

107
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,743
Get me there before
I finish putting on my makeup

108
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,245
and I'll, uh, double the meter.

109
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,474
You serious?

110
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,382
Do I look like
I have a sense of humor?

111
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,884
Okay.

112
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,223
Hurry, open the gate!

113
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,695
Hey, Jimmy... ho, ho, ho, ho!

114
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,062
LAZY ASS! OPEN THE GATES!

115
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,465
I'M ON MY COFFEE BREAK.
SHUT UP, OLD MAN!

116
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,662
IT'S JIMMY, YOU FOOL!

117
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,567
DON'T RUN OVER THE CHICKENS!

118
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,736
You drive too fast!

119
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,353
Yeah, I got mascara
and eyeliner left.

120
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,328
You got five blocks.

121
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,966
Don't tell me
you're slowing down.

122
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,343
You know, you drive like
an old woman.

123
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,110
Hmm.

124
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,279
You're not scared, are you?

125
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,816
Hey, you!
What do you think you're doing?

126
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,911
Back off, buddy.

127
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,353
She's mine.

128
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,947
Oh, it's you, miss.

129
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,220
Well, you lived up
to your reputation.

130
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,227
The job is yours.

131
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,956
I have a job. A good one.

132
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,931
Oh, yeah? How much do you
make at this "good job"?

133
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,264
$475 a week, plus tips.

134
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,600
So how would you like to make
$2,000 a week

135
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,071
plus room and board?

136
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,368
When do I show up?

137
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,398
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.

138
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,639
You'll be driving
Clark Devlin, Mr. Tong.

139
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,340
Good day, miss.

140
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,713
Now, you!
Out of here!

141
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:58,748
Good morning, Mr. Tong.

142
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,000
Huh.

143
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,518
You put your face on
without me, huh?

144
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,291
Please have a seat.

145
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,330
Those are the house rules.

146
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,996
Memorize them.

147
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,939
Especially number one.

148
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,966
"Never talk directly
to Mr. Devlin."

149
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,136
If you have any questions

150
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,645
you'll find
all the answers in there.

151
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,741
And, if I were you, I'd get rid
of the mildew on the chin.

152
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,309
My soul patch?

153
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,344
Uh, yeah.

154
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,424
You like working
for this Devlin guy?

155
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,359
I don't work for him.

156
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,313
I'm not a professional driver,
but I'd always believed

157
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,619
that thing you're staring
into is designed

158
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,922
for the monitoring of traffic,
not passengers.

159
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,019
Am I wrong?

160
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,131
While I'm really enjoying
our time together

161
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,261
shall we try moving?

162
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,734
Wallace has been my partner for years.

163
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,904
Something's happened to him.

164
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,072
He wouldn't just disappear.

165
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,206
Now, you get your job done

166
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,215
and find my partner.

167
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,341
So tell me how.

168
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,907
You're the head
of an intelligence agency.

169
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:33,976
Why don't you be intelligent?

170
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,680
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

171
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:36,813
Well, why don't you call me back

172
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,448
when you do understand
what I'm talking about.

173
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:45,487
Did we just take
the Balsam Road exit?

174
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,498
Of course.

175
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,864
You have to take
the surface street.

176
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,760
Sorry.

177
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:53,737
Did you get a copy
of the rules?

178
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,866
Did you read them?

179
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,101
Jimmy, let me tell you
something, my friend...

180
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,778
I hate the rules.

181
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,112
Take Grant Boulevard
all the way.

182
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,117
The lights are timed.

183
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,618
Thank you.

184
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,144
And, Jimmy...

185
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,157
crank the music up.

186
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,818
Yes, sir.

187
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,490
C.S.A. HEADQUARTERS

188
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,797
Deputy Director Chalmers,
ladies, gentlemen

189
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,702
I present to you
Special Agent Wallace.

190
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,866
Deceased two days, 14 hours,
five minutes... approximately.

191
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,535
Pretty interesting.

192
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,601
Now, why don't you, uh,
tell me a little about him?

193
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,637
Well, in simplest terms,
he drowned in his bathtub.

194
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,615
Contusion here suggests
he hit his head

195
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,914
fell prone, unconscious.

196
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,113
The man infiltrated
a Serbian death squad

197
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,348
with not even a scratch.

198
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,482
He goes down in a bathtub?

199
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,491
Life's a bitch.

200
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,822
You want to put him
back in the fridge?

201
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,589
He didn't drown, sir.

202
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:51,653
He was murdered.

203
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:55,394
Does that make life
a little less bitchy?

204
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,299
And-and you would be?

205
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,928
That's Del Blaine, sir.

206
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,598
She's having a filter installed

207
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,664
between her brain and mouth
next week.

208
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,801
So you don't think he drowned?

209
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,176
Well, sir, there was water
in his lungs

210
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,578
but the pulmonary vein

211
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,275
was filled with
collapsed platelets

212
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,647
indicative of dehydration.

213
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,118
He died of thirst.

214
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,120
Thirst.

215
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,382
And it wasn't just
city tap water.

216
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,253
The mineral profile fit
a high-end bottled water

217
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,518
but what was really weird
is that

218
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,685
it contained a strain
of bacteria that I, so far

219
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,092
haven't been able to culture.

220
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:27,896
Anyway, uh... didn't
mean to interrupt.

221
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,061
Ooh, the woman seems to know
a lot about water.

222
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,163
Yeah. She thinks she knows
a lot about a lot of things.

223
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,970
You know, we have a special
situation in the field.

224
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,408
I think we could use
your talents.

225
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,708
You interested?

226
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,179
When do I start?

227
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,772
You ever hear of Clark Devlin?

228
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,579
Rumors and innuendo.

229
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,108
Del, I could tell you
a thing or two

230
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,414
about Clark Devlin.

231
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,888
Uh, you think we
could keep our minds

232
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,720
out of the gutter
for about a second?

233
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:53,918
Meet me upstairs
in an hour.

234
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,654
You might just become

235
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,286
Clark Devlin's next partner.

236
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,853
I'm going to need

237
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,196
that Gerris marginalis
as soon as possible.

238
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,825
Yes. My contacts in Guatemala

239
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,529
have what you're looking for,
I'm sure.

240
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,902
Good.

241
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,201
And, meanwhile...

242
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:13,243
I'll take one of these
beautiful Uticella marginalis.

243
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,039
Just gorgeous.

244
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,687
Now, you're going to call me?

245
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,018
Is your phone number on file?

246
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,284
I'm having a bit of trouble

247
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,053
with the phones at the moment.
It might be better

248
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,559
if you dropped it off yourself.

249
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,754
It may take a while.

250
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:30,762
Well, why don't you

251
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,161
familiarize yourself
with the route?

252
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,189
There's a little gathering
at my house tonight...

253
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,361
a fund-raiser for
the Natural History Museum.

254
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,200
I would so love to have you.

255
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:42,737
Should I send a car?

256
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,504
I drive myself.

257
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,840
Admirable.

258
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,779
Eight o'clock.

259
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,839
And, uh, be sure
not to wear anything

260
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,579
too distracting, or no one
will get their checkbooks out.

261
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,490
How did you learn
to be so smooth?

262
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,515
I've seen the way you drive.

263
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,550
And the same instincts I do.

264
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,856
You lack confidence.

265
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,524
The girl in the art gallery's
not beyond you, you know.

266
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,827
You know about her?

267
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,333
Every time we leave the house

268
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,359
we go by the art gallery
and slow down.

269
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,700
You just need a little polish.

270
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:16,731
I'll never be a Clark Devlin.

271
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,766
Don't tell anyone this, Jimmy,
but there's a lot less

272
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,745
to Clark Devlin
than meets the eye.

273
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,871
I've got a couple of good lines

274
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,279
and a couple of
very expensive suits.

275
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,907
Apart from that,
we're exactly the same.

276
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,918
How about
a couple hundred million?

277
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,476
Trust me...
90% of it is clothes.

278
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,680
The other ten percent?

279
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,553
The other ten percent's
in there.

280
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,989
You've got plenty of it.

281
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,256
Oh, Mr. Devlin,
can I ask you a big favor?

282
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,489
Yeah?

283
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,895
Can I stop wearing my hat?

284
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,805
All right.

285
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,864
Thank you.

286
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,205
No, just stay smooth.
Remember... smooth.

287
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,369
Thank you.

288
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,471
Steena, Devlin.

289
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,177
This driver, this Jimmy,
I like him.

290
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,413
Let's get him a proper suit.

291
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,852
Something sexy. You pick it out.

292
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,822
All right.

293
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,518
Always a delight
talking to you, too, darling.

294
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,293
Home, James.

295
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,956
Absolutely, Mr. Devlin.

296
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,039
Oh!

297
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,201
Oops.

298
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:01,512
Watch your step.

299
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,310
Thank you, sir.

300
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:37,578
Oh...
This definitely not a rental.

301
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,583
Hello.

302
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,517
My name's Clark Devlin.

303
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,611
Would you like to dance?

304
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,315
Would you like to dance?

305
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,491
Admirable.

306
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,128
There is just one rule.

307
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,093
Never touch my tuxedo.

308
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,263
I didn't.

309
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,362
Good.

310
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,804
Don't.

311
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,774
Yes, sir.

312
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,107
Jimmy.

313
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,134
Get the car.

314
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,339
Let's go for dinner.

315
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,413
Yes, sir.

316
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,126
What'll you have? It's my treat.

317
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,156
Anything.

318
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,168
All right.

319
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,693
Two Whoppers,
hold the onion, extra ketchup.

320
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,467
Toast the bottom bun only,
medium well-done.

321
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,700
Two large fries,
extra well-done.

322
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,733
Two chocolate milkshakes,
however the chef likes.

323
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:39,744
That's it.

324
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,678
Your order's ready.
Pull forward.

325
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,215
That's pretty quick.

326
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,742
It's fast food. Anything else?

327
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:49,811
Yeah.

328
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,846
I'll have a personal pizza,
crispy crust.

329
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,721
He doesn't eat out much.

330
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,421
They don't serve pizza
at Burger...

331
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,194
New item, huh?

332
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,101
Do you have chicken chow mein?

333
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,861
Thank you.

334
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,169
- Jimmy?
- Yes?

335
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,203
It's a drive-through.
Let's drive.

336
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,646
Watch out!

337
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,414
Watch it, man!

338
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,653
Sorry, pal.

339
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,785
Let's go.

340
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,539
Why are we running away

341
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,700
from a skateboard?

342
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,471
I think it's probably a bomb.

343
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,477
I thought you said a bomb.

344
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,882
What do you mean, a bomb?

345
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,558
No good. Out!

346
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,737
Mr. Dev...

347
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,670
Move!

348
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,086
Jimmy, you okay?

349
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,098
I'm fine.

350
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,326
You okay, boss?

351
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,834
Yeah.

352
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,668
Yeah, all in a day's work, eh?

353
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,570
Look.

354
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,003
Oh, damn.

355
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,747
Mr. Devlin.

356
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,373
You got any aspirin?

357
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,440
Who did this to you?

358
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,850
Water stri...

359
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,820
Walter Strider... he's the one?

360
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,652
Wat... er... stri...

361
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,817
Walter... Walter Strider.

362
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,525
No... no police.

363
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,358
Okay. Uh...

364
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,227
I need an ambulance right now.

365
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,458
His name is...

366
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,366
Trust nobody.

367
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,994
Uh... his name is...

368
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,567
Brad Dillford.

369
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,141
Wear it.

370
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,050
Wear...

371
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,089
Boss! Boss!

372
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,127
Hold on, boss. You'll be fine.

373
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,430
Give me the clipboard.

374
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,436
I'll take care of you.

375
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,030
Wa...

376
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,563
stri...

377
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,802
- Huh?
- Sir!

378
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,866
Oh!

379
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,309
Please wait in the waiting room.

380
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,312
Okay.

381
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,314
I will find Walter Strider.

382
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,315
Hey! Hey!

383
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,941
Huh? I'm sorry.

384
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:41,612
I promise.

385
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,815
What do you want

386
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,290
my mother's maiden name for?

387
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,589
Last time she was
in here, I was born.

388
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,119
I'm sure my dad had something
to do with it

389
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,153
at least I hope so.

390
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,224
Dr. Angela.

391
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,327
Where is Dr. Angelo?

392
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,496
Dr. Angelo.

393
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,132
Are you Dr. Angela?

394
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,309
Dr. Angela.

395
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,939
Dr. Ang... ela.

396
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:10,970
Hey!

397
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,746
There's no smoking
in a hospital.

398
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,377
I was nervous. How is he?

399
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,717
He might be here a while.

400
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,949
You might want to get him

401
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,617
some things from home
in case he comes to.

402
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,683
Oh.

403
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,125
He had this clutched
in his hand.

404
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,628
I don't know
if it means anything.

405
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,995
"Orderly with wheels

406
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,431
to the front desk."

407
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,834
I do need Dr. Angelo.

408
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,837
Dr. Angelo.

409
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,499
Dr. Angelo is on holiday today.

410
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,441
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

411
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,146
BANNING, INC.,
FLOATING HEADQUARTERS

412
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,744
I'll tell you,
I'm pretty excited.

413
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,415
I mean, nervous,
but I'm excited.

414
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,753
I'm pumped, you know.

415
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,850
I knew I was doing good work
for Banning International

416
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,155
but I didn't know Mr. Banning

417
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,128
would be taking so much notice
of me so soon.

418
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,154
I'll say this, though,
when I'm CEO of this place

419
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,597
I won't be having
my headquarters

420
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,464
in the bottom of a boat,
you know what I mean?

421
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,734
Why did you choose Mr. Lundeen?

422
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,366
He questioned my growth projections.

423
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,815
No, that's not it.

424
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,978
I don't like his hair.

425
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:25,247
Mr. Banning.

426
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,056
So, word filtered
down to me

427
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:33,155
that you don't share my optimism
about our company's future.

428
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,063
Oh, no.

429
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,032
Actually, I just...

430
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:36,863
Drink?

431
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,233
Oh, yes, thank you.

432
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,067
I just felt that to meet

433
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,573
your projections, pretty much
every person on Earth

434
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,871
would have to drink
only Banning Springs water.

435
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,502
Yes, indeed.

436
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,981
Water, Mr. Lundeen,
comprises 60% of your body.

437
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,915
Don't you find it incredible

438
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,613
that two hydrogen atoms
and an oxygen atom can combine

439
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,383
to create something
so beautiful

440
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,117
so useful, so essential?

441
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:01,182
I find water to be

442
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,387
miraculous.

443
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,089
Do you think I'm silly?

444
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,722
Not at all.

445
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,764
Feeling thirsty?

446
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,429
Yes.

447
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,098
You're helping me out
by being a guinea pig

448
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,437
for a new product.

449
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:17,406
Oh, I see.

450
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,239
What a brilliant idea.

451
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,677
Water that makes you thirsty.

452
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,704
What's in it?

453
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,772
Salt?

454
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,543
There's no profundity in salt.

455
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,779
Bacteria.

456
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:32,881
Once ingested

457
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,553
its DNA will instruct
your cells' cytoplasm

458
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,655
to spill electrolytes
into your bloodstream

459
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,996
causing dehydration.

460
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:43,830
It's virulent

461
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,961
but, unfortunately,
it's too fast.

462
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,266
Way too fast.

463
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:51,139
As we speak, your internal
organs are shriveling.

464
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:55,078
You're becoming as dry as...

465
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,082
Well, as dry
as your limited imagination.

466
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,519
Gentlemen,
fetch the vacuum, won't you?

467
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,583
Thank you.

468
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:17,857
Schiffer, Schwartzkopf,
Sondheim, Springsteen...

469
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,028
No Strider.

470
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,876
Wow.

471
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:41,942
Welcome to the Tactical Uniform
Experiment.

472
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,749
Tuxedo recognizing new user.

473
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,589
Mapping user's
neurological structure.

474
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,220
Activate wristwatch
for desired function.

475
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:54,999
Demo...

476
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,557
Okay, show me.

477
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,636
Uh-oh.

478
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,467
Caution... demolition mode.

479
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,904
The Tuxedo will consider

480
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,808
any object a target
and act to destroy it.

481
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,186
Oh, what's happening?

482
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,418
Exit the demolition mode
immediately.

483
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,174
Mr. Devlin, is everything
all right?

484
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,541
This is Jimmy.

485
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,978
I think Mr. Devlin wants you
to clean his room tomorrow.

486
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,948
It's a little bit messy.

487
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,177
I think he threw the party.

488
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,480
Should I send someone up now?

489
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,077
No. Maybe after he leaves.

490
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,110
Very good.

491
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,756
Hmm?

492
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,360
Hello?

493
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,594
Are we on?

494
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,568
Are we on what?

495
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:39,570
C.S.A. OPERATIONS

496
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,663
I take my work seriously,
Mr. Devlin, so please

497
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:42,934
stop using
that ridiculous accent.

498
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:43,941
What?

499
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:44,999
What accent?

500
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,032
All right.

501
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,101
You're the senior officer.

502
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,407
I'll play it however you want.

503
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,812
Deitrich Banning is holding
a meeting with water CEOs.

504
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,817
The Agency wants us to find out
what he's planning.

505
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,479
Wh-What about Walter Strider?

506
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,953
Who is he?

507
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,819
I don't know. You tell me.

508
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,051
Okay.

509
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,855
So, we will meet tomorrow.
V-15, 10:00.

510
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,794
I'll be wearing a gray suit.

511
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,265
Your code is "nice rack."

512
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,267
I'll respond

513
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,031
"I forgot my bra."

514
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:14,732
That passes

515
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,330
for humor around here.

516
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,671
10:00, V-15.

517
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,472
What's the cross street?

518
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,602
Very funny.

519
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:31,983
May I join you?

520
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,650
Uh, yeah.

521
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,993
Nice rack.

522
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,900
Hello.

523
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,343
Mr. Devlin, there's been
a change of plans.

524
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,846
But I'm here already.
Where are you?

525
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,211
Don't get all pissy about it.

526
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,977
They just told me,
so I'm telling you.

527
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,143
We'll meet tonight

528
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,675
8:00, Pier 17,
base of the silo and...

529
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,813
forget the password.

530
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,156
Oh, now you tell me.

531
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,717
Oh, hey, there he is.
Oh, my God, that's him.

532
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,729
I got to go.

533
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,730
Guy in the raincoat. Get him!

534
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,731
I see you tonight. Sorry.

535
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,732
Stop!

536
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,165
Get back here, you creep!

537
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,382
So, we've got five minutes
to get into position.

538
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,587
I secured the rooftop.

539
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,027
The equipment's good to go

540
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,257
and I just have to say

541
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,290
it is such an honor to be
working with the legendary...

542
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,395
Clark Devlin?

543
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,437
I'm Del Blaine.

544
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,308
Have we met before?

545
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,245
No.

546
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,838
Good.

547
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,679
Okay, Del Blaine, let's do
what we've come here to do.

548
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,709
I'll follow you.

549
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,515
Ladies first.

550
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,786
Okay.

551
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,190
A couple of details changed
from what was in the file.

552
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,219
You read it?

553
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,231
The files are crap.

554
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,357
Give me the
short version.

555
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,061
Deitrich Banning's
holding a meeting

556
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,434
of international
water company CEOs.

557
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,699
We think he's trying
to force them

558
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,070
into selling
their companies to him.

559
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,301
Where are you going?

560
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,365
Huh?

561
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,637
I'm thinking.

562
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,338
We had Agent Wallace
working undercover

563
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,641
at his bottled water factory.

564
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,874
That is, until last week.

565
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,506
Wallace calls us
on his cell phone

566
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,177
to tell us that the operation
had reached critical mass

567
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,379
and, suddenly, wham! Dead.

568
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,762
As you requested, a Klineholtz
bolt-action nine-millimeter

569
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:01,101
titanium folding stock with
20-time infrared sniper-scope

570
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,164
and counterweighted
micro-rifled barrel.

571
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,176
My favorite gun.

572
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,577
But I don't kill
people anymore.

573
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,581
Killing?

574
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,378
You're planting a bug.

575
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,909
It was all in that "crap" file.

576
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,750
Go look through your binoculars.

577
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,792
They're arriving.

578
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:57,795
Ready?

579
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,059
It's critical we get
a listening device

580
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,690
in Banning's meeting.

581
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,530
Range... 962 feet.

582
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,432
Aim for the briefcase.

583
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,441
Should be a piece
of cake for you, sir.

584
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,284
You kind of missed.

585
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,317
In the year 2001

586
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:01,382
$35 billion worth of bottled
water was consumed worldwide.

587
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:05,088
Today, bottled water costs more
per gallon than gasoline.

588
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:09,395
We, my friends,
are the new oil barons.

589
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,196
We at Banning Springs

590
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,532
have developed
a new filtration process

591
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,128
that would protect your assets

592
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,539
against the biological holocaust
that's coming.

593
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,133
Looks like we got company.

594
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,439
CSA would be my bet.

595
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,412
You've heard what I have to say.

596
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,043
Now I'd like to hear you.

597
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,144
How much is this plan
going to cost us?

598
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,656
It won't cost you a penny,
out of pocket.

599
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,055
All I ask is to become

600
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,821
your slightly-more-
than-equal partner.

601
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,056
Banning says he's got
the only process

602
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,586
to make their water safe.

603
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,121
But to use it,
they've got to give him

604
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,963
half of their companies?

605
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,263
He's trying to muscle
these guys

606
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:47,271
into selling
their companies to him.

607
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,034
Banning says that their
water sources are in danger.

608
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,337
Something about everyone
being defenseless

609
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,206
against more deadly
forms of bacteria.

610
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,439
I can barely make out
what he's saying.

611
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,208
Do you want to listen to this?

612
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,284
What do you think
that means, sir?

613
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,287
Del Blaine!

614
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,585
Yeah, I'll be there
in a minute.

615
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,683
Yeah, I'd really like
some help up here, sir.

616
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,052
Del Blaine!

617
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,893
Do you hear me, sir?

618
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,558
I know this is not
near as exciting

619
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,091
as most of your missions,
but could you humor me

620
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,830
with just a little
professionalism?

621
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,304
I would really
love some help...

622
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,602
What are you doing?

623
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:28,673
What's with the jumpy-jumpy?

624
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,680
Take off your headphones!

625
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,113
- What?
- Your headphones!

626
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,859
Okay, Chapter Six
of the training manual.

627
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,758
Unarmed assailant...
frontal attack.

628
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,092
Begin!

629
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,098
Stomach, head! Stomach, head!

630
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,137
God!

631
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,167
What's my name?!

632
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,406
Yeah!

633
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:14,950
You okay?

634
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,056
Oh! Where the hell
have you been?!

635
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,860
Stop pushing!

636
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:21,762
Aah, my hand!

637
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,596
Whoa!

638
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,041
Yeah! Not bad.

639
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,481
Sir?!

640
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,476
Sir, are you okay, sir?

641
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,126
Don't let go! Don't!

642
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,127
No, no, no, let go!

643
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,990
You're-you're-you're ripping...

644
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,522
my sl-sleeve! You-you...

645
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,027
No, no. No, not, not my...

646
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,972
Sir!

647
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,271
My ring.

648
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,780
Oh, my God!

649
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,014
Oh, my... Oh!

650
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:37,737
This was not...
part of the plan.

651
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,545
Del Blaine?

652
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,950
Del...

653
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,427
Confidence.

654
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,805
Del...

655
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,148
Nice of you, moron.

656
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,048
Not in the manual.

657
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,088
Creep!

658
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,915
Del Blaine! Stop!

659
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,691
Get off of me!

660
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,119
Why didn't you stop?

661
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,925
God, what the hell
is wrong with you?!

662
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,727
How do you...
fall off a building

663
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,324
and end up... uh...

664
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,665
You okay?

665
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,068
Would you stop that?

666
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,045
It's okay.

667
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,410
I am in the car
with a psychopath.

668
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,438
We are not safe.

669
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:33,575
Are you upset?

670
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:34,777
Why would I be upset?

671
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,150
I've always wanted
to begin and end my career

672
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,779
with a big fat failure!

673
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,154
Thank you very much, Mr. Devlin.

674
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,216
It's my first time.

675
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,354
I mean... every mission
is like my first time.

676
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,560
It's so difficult
being Clark Devlin.

677
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,966
Oh.

678
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,436
Sorry.

679
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:58,830
Aah!

680
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,603
I didn't do that.

681
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,612
What...

682
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,012
i-is wrong with you?!

683
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,448
I'm not who you think I am.

684
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,609
Stay away!

685
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,211
I'm a little over-amped
myself right now.

686
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,846
Let's just call it a day.

687
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,789
Get some rest and medication.

688
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:14,654
What?

689
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,785
We'll be in communication.

690
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:17,885
Oh.

691
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:23,730
I don't have your phone number!

692
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,469
C.S.A. TARGET RANGE

693
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,376
Who am I kidding?

694
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,005
I have no idea what I'm doing

695
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,208
or why I'm doing it.

696
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,409
I felt the same way

697
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,112
when I took my first
field assignment.

698
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,244
Then I met Clark Devlin

699
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,777
and life just got
a whole lot better...

700
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,154
and a little more complicated.

701
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,681
Let's, uh, can we get
a close... can we...?

702
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,624
How do we pan down...

703
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,922
Yeah. Just hit the
second button there.

704
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,521
DEL:
Everybody warned me,
he was unorthodox

705
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,532
but he's way irrational,
bordering on nutso.

706
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,261
We'll just get, uh... That's it.

707
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,928
There, yeah. That's it, there.

708
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,027
Look at that.

709
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,799
Move it over, over just a bit.

710
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,101
He's getting under your skin,
isn't he?

711
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,335
He got under my skin once

712
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,207
and I'm still feeling it.

713
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,878
Yeah, you told me.

714
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:12,939
What about his English?

715
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,213
Oh, I can never understand
half of what he says

716
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,913
but don't you just love
his accent?

717
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,785
She can't hear
anything from here...?

718
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,653
No, I don't think... Whoa!

719
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,216
God, I wish I was
still back in the field.

720
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,356
How do you like me now?

721
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,766
She's got issues, man.

722
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:37,774
Holy...

723
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:38,900
Can your, uh, can your

724
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,068
girlfriend shoot, uh...

725
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,304
A groin out of a target?

726
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,312
Let's go.

727
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,211
Let's get our nails done.

728
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,512
Okay.

729
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,484
Have a nice day, boys.

730
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:52,444
"Dr. Angelo, Dr. Angelo..."

731
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:56,357
They ran out of "Get well soon."

732
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,021
You said to wear this,
but I don't know.

733
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:02,055
Being Clark Devlin is not easy.

734
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,800
Hello.

735
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,000
So, Mr. Devlin

736
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,508
how are you feeling today?

737
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:14,871
Not so good, I'm afraid.

738
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,573
Well, you've got a few hours

739
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,171
to pull yourself together.

740
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,239
What do you mean?

741
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,717
After the fiasco
of planting the bug

742
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:22,776
I'd say we have
only one choice:

743
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,311
Level One surveillance.

744
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,322
In other words...

745
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,550
Infiltration.

746
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:29,320
Banning's going to be at
the Lanford Hotel tonight

747
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,293
entertaining three
of his new partners.

748
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:34,491
Chalmers has agreed to...
get us at the next table.

749
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,431
Is this a black-tie event?

750
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,991
No. But I'm sure you'll
wear whatever you want.

751
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,663
Maybe we can find
Walter Strider.

752
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,262
Meet you there at 8:00.

753
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,603
Water... strider...

754
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,607
What?

755
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,630
Water...

756
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,337
Mr. Clark Devlin.

757
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,470
Stri... der...

758
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:50,673
What are you doing?

759
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,011
Huh?

760
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,482
Uh, he needs help.

761
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,109
Security! Security!

762
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,350
Del Blaine.

763
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:28,442
Hey.

764
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,113
I know how partial you are
to that monkey suit of yours

765
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,349
so I got gussied up.

766
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,414
Good job. You gussy very well.

767
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,154
Oh, and here's a little
something for you.

768
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,422
Hmm?

769
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,451
Oh.

770
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,293
Thank you.

771
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,162
Sorry, I don't have
anything for you.

772
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,895
It's a video camera.

773
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:45,594
Shh. Act normal.

774
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,570
We don't want everybody to know.

775
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:48,593
Sorry.

776
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,606
Good evening.

777
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,607
Good evening.

778
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,630
Uh, name, please.

779
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:52,642
Name?

780
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:53,734
Um...

781
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,271
Lincoln.

782
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,047
Washington.

783
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,615
Washington.

784
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:09,749
You're a billionaire

785
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,227
and you try to grease
the guy with seven bucks?

786
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,162
You think I have money
to throw away?

787
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,496
You on the list?

788
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:17,693
Perfect.

789
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:18,723
Let me talk to him.

790
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,327
No. You know what,
we'll do this my way.

791
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,861
I've got a T-135
disorientation module.

792
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,271
You just stand there.

793
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,869
Hi. Could you...
hold this for me?

794
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,572
Aw, thanks.

795
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:33,447
Now, where did I put
those tickets?

796
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,446
What's happening, Snowman?

797
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,578
What's happening?

798
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,418
What's happening, Snowman?

799
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:40,514
What's happening, Snowman?

800
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,286
Hey... what's happening?

801
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,258
Oh, hey.

802
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,288
I can't believe it.

803
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,960
James Brown.

804
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,868
The Godfather of Soul.

805
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,301
- What's happening?
- Hello.

806
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,330
Mr. Brown.

807
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,603
Forgive us for bothering you.

808
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,543
We came to see your show and...

809
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,205
Yeah, she forgot
to make reservations.

810
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,214
Don't worry about it.

811
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,545
I can get tickets
for the front row for you.

812
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,743
Oh, thank you very much,
Mr. Brown.

813
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,149
See? The things work out.

814
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,053
There's one more thing
I'd like to say, um...

815
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,784
It's not the in thing today

816
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,189
to give compliments
to a young lady

817
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,318
but I just got
to let you know that...

818
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,159
you got a nice rack.

819
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,688
Oh, thank you, Mr. Brown.

820
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,893
Enjoy the show.

821
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:27,067
What...

822
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,401
is wrong with you?!

823
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,099
He f-fell down by himself.

824
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,869
You killed James Brown.

825
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,137
No, he's fine.

826
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:34,302
He's not fine.

827
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,471
And Banning is going to leave.

828
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:37,480
Don't panic.

829
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,947
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

830
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:40,244
Are you... praying?

831
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,014
Miss Cleo told me
this would happen.

832
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,918
$4.99-a-minute Miss Cleo?

833
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,855
Just go out and tell them

834
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,983
Mr. Brown is not here.

835
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,517
There will be another act.

836
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,722
Nice to meet you.

837
00:48:55,098 --> 00:49:02,800
And right about now,
it is style time!

838
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,003
If you will,
ladies and gentlemen

839
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:09,570
introducing the hardest-working
man in show business

840
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,945
ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Dynamite...

841
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:15,213
James Brown!

842
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,851
Uh, l-ladies and gentleman...

843
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,054
What's going on?!

844
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,620
Mr. James Brown will not be
appearing tonight...

845
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,398
due to unforeseen circumstances

846
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,130
but stay right where you are

847
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,869
because the Lanford Hotel is
really proud to present

848
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,206
the Last Emperor of Soul.

849
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:43,542
And, um, well, here he is.

850
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,351
Hi.

851
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,910
Hi, everybody. Good evening.

852
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,957
How are you tonight?!

853
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,186
Go home!

854
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,595
Who wants to get funky tonight?!

855
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,153
Go ahead and make it funky.

856
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,460
Yeah.

857
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,923
Oh!

858
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:38,589
Ooh.

859
00:52:13,362 --> 00:52:14,922
Good God!

860
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:17,200
So, you had fun up there.

861
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,598
I was blending;
that's what agents do.

862
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,967
Would you please stop?

863
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:23,336
I'd like to get to Banning's
table before morning.

864
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:24,931
Whoa! Hey, slut, thanks.

865
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,842
I hate celebrities
who brush off their fans.

866
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,403
Banning's girlfriend
has been drinking.

867
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,005
Okay, she might be
able to tell... Clark!

868
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:33,015
Yes.

869
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,016
Stop.

870
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,915
Get on the scene, Sex Machine.

871
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:38,847
Great job, man.

872
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,516
Hi.

873
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,388
Hi. Good evening.

874
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:43,892
Hello.

875
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:44,951
Well, we're all

876
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,021
vaguely honored
you could join us, I suppose.

877
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,659
Singing is my favorite
type of music.

878
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:53,259
Oh, admirable.

879
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,168
Regrettably, this is

880
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,173
my vacuous fiancee.

881
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,731
I think her name is Cheryl

882
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,333
something.

883
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,469
Oh, charmed.

884
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,071
I could look at you all day.

885
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,343
Do you ever dance
unprofessionally...

886
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,181
Emperor?

887
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:10,379
Let's see what I can do.

888
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:12,779
Oh, excuse us.

889
00:53:13,822 --> 00:53:16,223
Of course.

890
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,294
Do you know how to mambo?

891
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,387
I hope so.

892
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,863
Whoo!

893
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:39,307
Hmm... '92 Dasani.

894
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,341
Gentle bouquet with a hint
of vinyl polychloride.

895
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:46,014
Earthy yet... ethereal.

896
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,546
Cheers.

897
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,854
Oops.

898
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,020
I spilled.

899
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,535
You and Banning seem very close.

900
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,834
Tell me about his work.

901
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,637
I don't want
to talk about him.

902
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,337
I want to talk about you.

903
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:10,312
You're such a handsome devil.

904
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,373
So are you.

905
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:17,853
When I can't sleep at night,
which is quite often

906
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,481
I step into my
laboratory and I play.

907
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,616
It's not work, you see.

908
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:23,853
It's glorious

909
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:27,590
wet... play.

910
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:31,931
Well, maybe I can
come over and play.

911
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:35,426
That would be very nice.

912
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,407
The thing is, I, uh...

913
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:43,572
I have a small problem...
trusting people.

914
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:48,710
I don't know if I can trust
myself with you, Deitrich.

915
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:51,152
Well, maybe we can come up

916
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,815
with a way for you to pro...

917
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,328
Her name's Del Blaine.
She's CSA.

918
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,924
Oh, bloody hell.

919
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:09,302
He drives a BMW,
registered to Clark Devlin.

920
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:12,831
You told me you
dealt with Devlin

921
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:15,538
with the skateboard bomb.

922
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,604
Yeah, well, he looks
pretty alive to me.

923
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,548
Pretty good dancer.
He's all over Cheryl.

924
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,414
You want me to do
something about that?

925
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,386
No.

926
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,581
Maybe the rancid tart

927
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,783
might actually be
of some use for once.

928
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,155
Get the boys, would you?

929
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,959
Whoo! I am so bushed.

930
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,989
I'm sorry,
you'll have to excuse me.

931
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,898
Unfortunate interruptus.

932
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,835
So, my long streak of love,
here is the key

933
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,098
to the hospitality suite

934
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:45,266
should you feel the need
to spend the night.

935
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,832
Good-bye.

936
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,901
Well, I think I'll just go up

937
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:52,278
to room 7-2... excuse me... 6-8

938
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,942
and take a long, hot bath

939
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:57,510
in room 7-2-6-8.

940
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:58,282
Good night.

941
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,310
Good night.

942
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,962
And once again,
we end up with nothing.

943
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,760
I can get her to talk.

944
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,232
And say what?

945
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,565
Oh, Emperor,
would you sign my bra?

946
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,901
Oops, I'm not wearing one.

947
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,038
What is it with you and bras?

948
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,406
She has information.

949
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,911
Oh, right, and that's why you
have to go up to her hotel room.

950
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,141
You have never seen my work.

951
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:28,116
This is what
Clark Devlin does best.

952
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,641
Can I go home?

953
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:31,313
No, you have to cover me.

954
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:32,981
With what, a shot of penicillin?

955
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:33,989
Huh?

956
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:34,990
Fine.

957
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,356
I'll be waiting by the pool.

958
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,361
Oh, wait.

959
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,363
What's her room number again?

960
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,864
7-2-6-8.

961
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,163
7-2-6-8. 7-2-6-8. 7-2-6-8.

962
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,225
Yoo-hoo!

963
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,394
Cheryl!

964
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,903
Hey, you little devil.

965
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:23,765
What kind of bubbles
do you like?

966
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,069
Little...

967
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:27,443
...or big?!

968
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,910
Hang it for me, will you?

969
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:40,890
So...

970
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:43,085
I know you can dance, but...

971
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,923
what else can you do?

972
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,019
Get on the bed.

973
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,029
I'll show you.

974
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:49,365
Oh!

975
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:55,365
Okay, Mr. Devlin,
let's see your magic.

976
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,906
Oh, my God, your hands
are like a machine.

977
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:02,969
Oh, I am never working
with him again.

978
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:06,948
So, tell me about Deitrich's
good friend, Walter Strider.

979
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,847
Oh! Never heard of him...

980
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,945
but I know Dry Martini.

981
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,354
Maybe someone should mix us
a couple.

982
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,791
Y-O-U spells "you."

983
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:22,220
Oh.

984
00:58:24,265 --> 00:58:25,291
You're smart.

985
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,996
Really?

986
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,162
And a good speller.

987
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:30,536
Thanks. I graduated
top two-thirds

988
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,370
of my sixth grade class.

989
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:37,674
What a gentleman.

990
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:45,513
Look, it's Cocktail Barbie.

991
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,045
Take your clothes off
and stay a while.

992
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,079
L-I like my clothes on.

993
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:49,091
Kinky boy.

994
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,149
Wh-Wh...?

995
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,125
Where did you
get that pin?

996
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,094
Oh. Deitrich.

997
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,255
Want to have a closer look?

998
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:54,991
Huh?

999
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,192
I'm sorry.

1000
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,999
Look at the time. I got to go.

1001
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,164
Oh, Emperor.

1002
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,669
Where are you going?

1003
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,768
What are you doing?

1004
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:09,573
Oh, Emperor.

1005
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:13,880
Oh, where are you going

1006
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,384
you naughty boy?

1007
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:19,013
I adore romance when it's rough.

1008
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:19,885
Whoo!

1009
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:33,761
Get back here!

1010
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:34,633
You're dead meat!

1011
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:35,831
Come on!

1012
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:53,019
Take a bath.

1013
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:55,923
Oh, yes, because I've been
a dirty, dirty girl.

1014
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,884
Go fill the tub.

1015
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,020
Do you like it with bubbles?

1016
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:01,030
Hot bubbles.

1017
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:02,998
Oh, yippee!

1018
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:03,999
Yippee!

1019
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:08,971
Tiny bubbles in my wine...

1020
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,734
Makes me feel fine

1021
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,832
Come on, her voice reminds me
of my mother.

1022
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,978
Is that room service?

1023
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:41,802
What's happening?

1024
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:48,607
What's going on under those
cute little boxers of yours?

1025
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,351
Emperor, the bubbles
are perfect.

1026
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:11,090
Come to mama, Emperor!

1027
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,499
Coming!

1028
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,940
Ow!

1029
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:38,191
Help!

1030
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,732
Say good night... agent!

1031
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,864
Del Blaine. Del Blaine.

1032
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,748
Sorry.

1033
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:13,262
Emperor...

1034
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,354
This is not what I signed up for!

1035
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,421
I need my bathroom bud.

1036
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:16,625
Shh. She's in there taking a bath.

1037
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:17,564
What happened to your nose?

1038
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,761
Sorry!

1039
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:23,772
Honeymooners.

1040
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,001
Yes, some things never change.

1041
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,873
Emperor!

1042
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,969
Emperor, come back!

1043
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:32,378
Please!

1044
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:35,674
Oh...

1045
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,686
Go! Get going.

1046
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:40,678
Ouch!

1047
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:45,353
Can't you do anything?

1048
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:47,123
Why are you so mad?

1049
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,427
Gee, let me think.

1050
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:52,366
Because big, ugly men
are trying to kill me?

1051
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,834
Because I got stuck

1052
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,805
with a millionaire playboy
dilettante for a partner?

1053
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:59,000
You don't care
how you make people feel.

1054
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,133
I happen to be

1055
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,667
an extremely sensitive person.

1056
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:03,701
Ow!

1057
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,682
Okay, you think
you know feelings.

1058
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:08,843
Look at me.

1059
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:12,377
How do I feel?

1060
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:13,388
Sick.

1061
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:14,354
Sad.

1062
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,618
What about now?

1063
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,553
Constipated.

1064
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,695
Creepy.

1065
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,290
Horny.

1066
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:26,893
Is funny.

1067
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,563
Is angry.

1068
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:30,037
Is crazy.

1069
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,403
You know nothing.

1070
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,908
This is why you don't have
a boyfriend.

1071
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:36,309
No wonder you didn't get
anything from Banning.

1072
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:39,280
Oh... right, I didn't
get anything from Banning

1073
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,647
except where
his friggin' lab is.

1074
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,413
Where?

1075
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,977
Let's see if the great master
"agent" can figure it out.

1076
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,081
Banning said he sometimes
has trouble sleeping.

1077
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,091
Big secret.

1078
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,753
All men have trouble sleeping.

1079
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:54,695
Sometimes at night, he goes
down and works in his lab.

1080
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,960
He sleeps in his lab?

1081
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,626
He sleeps in his bedroom.

1082
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,296
His lab's in his bedroom?

1083
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,099
No.

1084
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:03,969
Get your facts straight.

1085
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,975
His lab is at his house...

1086
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:10,274
his casa, where he lives...
get it?

1087
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,743
Excellent.

1088
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,343
You passed the test.

1089
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,285
I put in a good word
with the boss.

1090
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:19,845
Well, let's go
see Chalmers tonight.

1091
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:20,821
No.

1092
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:21,983
Keep him out of this.

1093
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,821
Just you and me.

1094
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,054
You know,
if you're so good at this

1095
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,618
why-why don't you tell me
something about me?

1096
01:04:27,662 --> 01:04:29,460
Okay.

1097
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:32,558
You have big crush on me

1098
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:35,162
and I know your
name is Del Blaine.

1099
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,934
First of all, you wish, and...

1100
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,333
my real name is Delilah.

1101
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,538
Delilah?

1102
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,142
Suits you.

1103
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:49,284
Hey...

1104
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:50,307
Hmm?

1105
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:02,596
Ooh!

1106
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:03,758
Oh!

1107
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:06,359
Oh... oh, Emperor!

1108
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,460
Hey!

1109
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:10,836
Oh, God, Clark,
isn't anything sacred?

1110
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:13,808
Oh, rug burns are so sexy!

1111
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,538
It's the driver.

1112
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,545
Oh, my God.

1113
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:23,647
Thank you.

1114
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:24,880
Invitations?

1115
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,252
Oh, yes.

1116
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:28,257
Why don't you offer him
five bucks?

1117
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:29,918
I have them somewhere.

1118
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:32,052
Birds of a feather...

1119
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,085
Nice party, huh?

1120
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,062
So, you're the strong,
silent type, huh?

1121
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,794
That's the whole
bouncer package.

1122
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:42,633
I didn't mean your package.

1123
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:43,639
Thank you...

1124
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,164
Dr. Schwartz.

1125
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,175
Shalom.

1126
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,198
Come, darling.

1127
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:51,946
Product launch, my ass.

1128
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:54,313
Let's go find
Banning's lab.

1129
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:27,947
Let's go.

1130
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,741
Are you trying to get me alone?

1131
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:57,939
Where'd they go?

1132
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,448
Don't tell me
the great Clark Devlin

1133
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,542
can't come up with an answer.

1134
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,891
Although

1135
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,990
he can walk on water.

1136
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,268
It's a trick, right?

1137
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:39,579
Come on.

1138
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:51,957
Wow!

1139
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,628
Mr. Devlin likes insects, too.

1140
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:54,636
What?

1141
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,035
Oh, uh, uh, I mean

1142
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,836
sometime I speak of myself
in the third person.

1143
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:01,138
Hmm, Del Blaine
thinks you're a freak.

1144
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,711
Have you cleaned the tanks?

1145
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,847
What are they doing down there?

1146
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:07,871
I don't know.

1147
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,282
When you're done here

1148
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,512
you can go and sweep the tunnels.

1149
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:11,542
Don't use the blower!

1150
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,952
I can tell the difference.

1151
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:14,853
And don't touch the tequila
for me and Mr. Banning.

1152
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,016
Whatever you say there,
Dr. Simms.

1153
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:17,025
Yes, Dr. Simms.

1154
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:18,026
Louder!

1155
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,085
- Yes, Dr. Simms.
- Yes, Dr. Simms.

1156
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:22,654
We better hope the little
ones follow the queen.

1157
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:23,756
Well, if they don't

1158
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:24,993
the stock is going
to be worthless.

1159
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:26,558
"Follow the queen"?

1160
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,570
Huh? Have you seen Cheryl?

1161
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:29,798
Maybe he's gay.

1162
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:30,999
Cheryl? No.

1163
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,302
Man, let's get out of here.

1164
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:33,774
Let's go have a smoke.

1165
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:36,175
It still stinks.

1166
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,285
Hey.

1167
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,378
How did you...?

1168
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:46,979
Whatever.

1169
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,990
Look at this.

1170
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:54,519
He's pinpointed
the national reservoirs.

1171
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:55,825
He's going to poison
the water?

1172
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:56,889
Not with that stuff.

1173
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:58,058
It's too detectable

1174
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,590
and there's
government safeguards.

1175
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:00,932
Let's check out the computer.

1176
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,335
Now you're thinking.

1177
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:07,568
Who are they?

1178
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,441
They shouldn't be in the lab.

1179
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,036
Let's go.

1180
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,980
Oh, my God.

1181
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:13,982
Oh, your God what?

1182
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,381
DNA recombinant microbes

1183
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:17,351
carrying a T-4 genome.

1184
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:18,876
English.

1185
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,389
Genetically induced
hydrogen-oxygen barrier.

1186
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,948
Normal person's English.

1187
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,187
Dehydrating water.

1188
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,024
Drink it,
you'll shrivel up and die

1189
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:28,654
but the big question is,
how is he possibly

1190
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:30,460
going to introduce it
into the water supply?

1191
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,198
I think we better go.

1192
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:34,202
Huh?

1193
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:35,203
Go.

1194
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,065
Quick, over there by the wall.

1195
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:44,804
Nobody here.

1196
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,610
Let's check the hatchery.

1197
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,153
You're on my foot.

1198
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:56,949
What was that about?

1199
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:58,892
Shh! Go!

1200
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,486
How did they miss us?

1201
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,520
What, are they blind?

1202
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,692
Don't look up my skirt.

1203
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:32,253
Banning's got the bacteria

1204
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,285
but he has to transport it
from his lab to the water.

1205
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,319
There's no way he can.

1206
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,592
Maybe with airplanes.

1207
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,031
Not possible.

1208
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,331
Besides, even if he could get it
to a reservoir undetected

1209
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:41,666
an alarm would trigger

1210
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,399
the second the surface
of the water's broken.

1211
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,703
You're really smart.

1212
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,106
It's an act.

1213
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,200
I'm an inexperienced girl

1214
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,871
who's trying to bluff
her way through.

1215
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,937
You are?

1216
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,380
Come on, stop humoring me.

1217
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:54,905
Just be honest.

1218
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:58,385
Honest?

1219
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,513
All right.

1220
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,183
You think
I'm the great Clark Devlin.

1221
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:07,118
Yeah, hello?

1222
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:09,562
Steena, I can't talk right now.

1223
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:15,937
Yeah.

1224
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:18,633
Yeah, I can handle it.

1225
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:21,335
Bad news?

1226
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,369
Can we go somewhere
and be... alone?

1227
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:26,506
Sure.

1228
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,151
I didn't know
you were so strong.

1229
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:33,484
Take off your clothes.

1230
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:34,614
Let's not do anything
we'll regret.

1231
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,386
Take off your clothes.

1232
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:37,392
What's happening?

1233
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,053
Look, I knew
the second I met you

1234
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:40,425
you weren't Clark Devlin.

1235
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,430
Now take off the tuxedo.
It doesn't belong to you.

1236
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,329
I wanted to tell you,
but I just didn't know how.

1237
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:45,390
Take off your clothes.

1238
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:48,266
What is that?

1239
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,271
Hey!

1240
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,272
Whoa!

1241
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,273
You, out here!

1242
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,205
Okay.

1243
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:53,674
Take the clothes.

1244
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:54,676
Okay.

1245
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:55,540
Slow down.

1246
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:56,566
My name is Jimmy Tong.

1247
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:57,772
I'm Mr. Devlin's driver.

1248
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,303
He asked me to find
Walter Strider.

1249
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:00,337
I don't want to hear

1250
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:01,713
any more of your lies.

1251
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,978
Now, give me the watch
and the shoes.

1252
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:04,508
Now, where's Clark Devlin
and how did you think

1253
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:05,713
you were going
to get away with this?

1254
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,085
Things happened.

1255
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,522
I decided to go with the flow.

1256
01:12:10,558 --> 01:12:12,755
What about the underwear?

1257
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,387
They're mine.

1258
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,988
L-I mean, my roommate.

1259
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:17,020
Jimmy.

1260
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:19,064
Suits you.

1261
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,632
These are my roommate's, too.

1262
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,004
Go finish your business.

1263
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,144
Have you seen the Emperor?

1264
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,171
No.

1265
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,142
Impolite to leave

1266
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,085
without saying good-bye
to the host.

1267
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,111
I was just looking for Deitrich.

1268
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,383
I'll take you to him, then.

1269
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:49,094
Like a big terrier
with a little rat.

1270
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:50,564
I think she was
down in the lab.

1271
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:54,228
Well, at least your interest
in water was genuine.

1272
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,396
Look, I'm here because of you.

1273
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:59,498
You wanted to know
if I could be trusted?

1274
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:03,671
I bet this tux
is just your size.

1275
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,079
Thank you.

1276
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:19,553
We got a positive location
on Blaine, sir.

1277
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:21,529
How long till we get to her?

1278
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,428
20 minutes.

1279
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:25,490
I've transmitted
the coordinates.

1280
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:28,230
Dear Mr. Devlin

1281
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:31,296
I did the best I could,
but it wasn't good enough.

1282
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,831
I did not find Walter Strider
for you.

1283
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:36,106
I also lost your tuxedo.

1284
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,306
I'm sure you will get it back.

1285
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:43,979
I guess I will go back to being
what I was before I met you.

1286
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,008
Oh!

1287
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:15,945
Water Strider.

1288
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,583
Water strider.

1289
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:24,626
Water strider!

1290
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,093
Stupid!

1291
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:29,291
My beautiful little darlings.

1292
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,060
Gerris maginatus.

1293
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:33,397
Species native
to Southeast Asia.

1294
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,960
Commonly known
as the water strider.

1295
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:39,599
Walter Strider.

1296
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:40,869
Yes, the water strider.

1297
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,001
Very good. Very good.

1298
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,739
Well, it's brilliant.

1299
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,747
They touch down
on the reservoirs.

1300
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,749
Their little feet transfer
a deadly bacteria

1301
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,512
without breaking
the surface of the water

1302
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,712
so no alarms sound,
and it looks like

1303
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:54,347
a nasty little trick of nature.

1304
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:55,356
Fortunately

1305
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:57,153
there is one drinkable
water source.

1306
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:00,053
Yours.

1307
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,961
Deitrich,
you're a genius.

1308
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,024
Too bad it won't work.

1309
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:10,567
Oh... you so wrong.

1310
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:13,439
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong.

1311
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:15,670
It will work because
my plan is perfect.

1312
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:18,874
Sorry, Mr. Banning,
it's your plan... and mine.

1313
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:21,212
Um... it's ours.

1314
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,649
Shut up. Explain.

1315
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,709
Oh, all righty.

1316
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:27,153
The life cycle
of the Gerris maginatus

1317
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,089
begins with mating...

1318
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:33,220
something Dr. Simms
is not personally familiar with.

1319
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,162
Anyhoo, the insects swarm

1320
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,664
to freshwater

1321
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:39,064
where fertilized eggs are then
deposited on the underside

1322
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:42,400
of lotus leaves
and hatch into larvae.

1323
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:45,429
Spare me
the Discovery Channel blather.

1324
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:48,669
Tell me why it won't work.

1325
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:49,836
Yes, tell us.

1326
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,641
Why it won't work?

1327
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,945
This is the northern
hemisphere, correct?

1328
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:57,474
You incubated insects native
to the southern hemisphere.

1329
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:01,979
So, simply, it is too cold
for them to mature sexually...

1330
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:05,323
much like Simms here.

1331
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,486
Therefore...

1332
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:07,495
they won't mate.

1333
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:10,794
Therefore,
they won't seek out water.

1334
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:12,527
Is this true?

1335
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:16,197
No, I knew a girl once,
in college, quite well.

1336
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,705
Very well.

1337
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,604
And then you remember
cousin Doris?

1338
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:21,973
No, Simms, the bugs.

1339
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:23,307
The bugs.

1340
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,337
Oh, you're not going
to believe this hootchie

1341
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:27,814
are you, Mr. Banning?

1342
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:28,838
Oh, yeah?

1343
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:31,876
Ask him if I lied
about the tuxedo.

1344
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,980
This tuxedo is...
it's all right. It's...

1345
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,081
"All right"?

1346
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,058
That is the most incredible
piece of technology

1347
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,958
on the planet.

1348
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:45,627
And I am laying it
in your big, hot hands.

1349
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:48,261
Mr. Banning, release the bugs.

1350
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:49,270
Go ahead.

1351
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:50,271
Do what he tells you.

1352
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:51,897
You might have a chance
at second prize

1353
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,430
at a junior high school
science fair

1354
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:56,171
but you can forget your dreams
of world domination.

1355
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:57,940
Slip into it, Deitrich.

1356
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,880
See how it feels.

1357
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,885
The other ten percent's
in there.

1358
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:15,294
You've got plenty of it.

1359
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:25,873
Hey, Dr. Schwartz.

1360
01:17:26,907 --> 01:17:29,900
Tell your boss
Clark Devlin is back.

1361
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:44,749
Drapes nicely.

1362
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:05,474
Well, it certainly puts
a spring in one's step.

1363
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,448
Happy to have lightened
your loafers, Deitrich.

1364
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:09,040
One question.

1365
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:10,346
Why are you doing this?

1366
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,348
Hey, what the hell is this?

1367
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:20,691
This is the moment where
50 CSA commandos storm in

1368
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,924
take you,
your pretentious accent

1369
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:24,454
your jackass sideburns

1370
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:26,626
to the Federal pen where,
guess what?

1371
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:31,264
All they serve is highly
chlorinated tap water.

1372
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:34,298
Presenting Clark Devlin.

1373
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:46,212
Have I told you how amazing
you look in this tuxedo?

1374
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:49,248
Simms, prepare for release.

1375
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:51,782
With pleasure, sir.

1376
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:54,489
Hatchery doors opening.

1377
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:55,860
Water sources targeted.

1378
01:18:55,897 --> 01:19:00,459
Pods will begin releasing
striders in five minutes.

1379
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:08,438
Maturation level: 85%.

1380
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:14,549
Why are you here?

1381
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,550
I've come to save you.

1382
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:16,551
That's great.

1383
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,485
What about the big guys
with the big guns?

1384
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:25,419
For years, I've heard about you.

1385
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,793
Now we finally meet, I find
that the great Clark Devlin

1386
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,957
is nothing more
than an ordinary man

1387
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:34,594
who's about to die
an extraordinary death.

1388
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:35,694
You're right

1389
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:37,637
except for one thing.

1390
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,071
My name's Tong.

1391
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:40,131
James Tong.

1392
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,677
You okay?

1393
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,687
Uh, Jimmy, is there

1394
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:53,847
something you want to tell me?

1395
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:54,878
Later.

1396
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,751
Oh, you've got
a good suit as well.

1397
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:14,306
All right!

1398
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:15,274
Let go!

1399
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,256
X-4 genome bacteria-induced

1400
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,554
water striders: 100% mature.

1401
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:09,258
Bacteria drop sites identified.

1402
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:10,958
Pods now opening.

1403
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:13,627
What are you doing?! No! No!

1404
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:16,603
She's ruining everything.

1405
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:20,039
Electrical malfunction.
Hatchery door is disengaged.

1406
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:23,238
Ah, I knew girls like you
in high school.

1407
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,802
Yeah? Did they do this?

1408
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,638
Uh-huh, they did.

1409
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:30,674
Mr. Banning, you must
open the hatch manually.

1410
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:31,811
Sod off.

1411
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:35,619
Manual hatch release required.

1412
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:45,990
Manual hatch release required.

1413
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:57,200
Rotate valve counterclockwise
to open hatch.

1414
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:20,498
Get off.

1415
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:25,673
Bloody open!

1416
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:28,471
Manual procedure complete.
Hatchery doors opening.

1417
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:39,016
Airborne striders
awaiting queen release.

1418
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:47,760
Hatchery doors opening.

1419
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:51,594
Clark!

1420
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:54,397
I mean, Jimmy, help me!

1421
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:55,494
I'm busy.

1422
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:58,764
All mature striders
ready for release.

1423
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,866
Bacteria-laced microbes
fully activated.

1424
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:10,411
His head's about to explode.

1425
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:11,441
Look at him.

1426
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:14,747
Look at him!

1427
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:18,317
You might know a few tricks

1428
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,488
but you're just
a sad, pathetic man.

1429
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:48,587
Smoking is bad for your health.

1430
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:49,590
You okay?

1431
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:50,591
Yeah, duh.

1432
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:51,649
By the way, nice going.

1433
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:54,025
Now millions of people are going
to die of dehydration.

1434
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:55,086
You left the hatch open.

1435
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:57,860
They're not flying away.

1436
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:01,695
Yeah, what are they waiting for?

1437
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:04,637
They are waiting...
to follow the queen.

1438
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:07,197
Airborne striders
awaiting queen release.

1439
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:09,369
Oh, my God.
For once, you're right.

1440
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:11,140
The queen is going
to lead the striders

1441
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:13,170
to freshwater sites
all over North America.

1442
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:15,341
Quick, grab it
before it's released.

1443
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,044
Queen strider disengaged.

1444
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:18,780
Alert!
Queen strider disengaged.

1445
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:21,914
Let's go.

1446
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:25,157
He's got the queen!

1447
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:35,499
Wait!

1448
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:39,234
You dropped it.

1449
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:11,636
Don't move!

1450
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:44,764
Oh!

1451
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:02,890
Ow.

1452
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:52,873
Sir, excuse me,
I deserve to see this.

1453
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,699
Ugh.

1454
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:02,676
Trouble.

1455
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:16,589
Okay, okay, make hustle, ladies.

1456
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:17,893
Let's go. Let's go.

1457
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:19,126
Watch out, Aqua-Lung.

1458
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:21,931
Hey, pal, nice suit.

1459
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:22,937
It's okay, kitten.

1460
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:24,199
Everything's going
to be all right.

1461
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,228
It is not okay.

1462
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:27,002
You just decked the hero.

1463
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:30,704
L-I'm a genius and I can testify
for a piece of immunity.

1464
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:32,975
Also, I'm from
a neutral country...

1465
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:34,242
Shut it.

1466
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:36,341
Well, looks like we
got here just in time.

1467
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:37,783
Oh, to what? Take credit?

1468
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:39,844
Oh, you're hilarious, Blaine.

1469
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:41,445
Winton Chalmers, CSA.

1470
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:43,514
I spearheaded the operation
that took down Deitrich Banning.

1471
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:45,116
I bet you're Jimmy Tong.

1472
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:47,024
Here's your tuxedo.
You happy now?

1473
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:50,326
Well, I will be when I get it
safely back to headquarters.

1474
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:51,764
By the way, Blaine,
not a bad job

1475
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:54,131
for your first time
in the field.

1476
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:55,635
Well, I didn't do it alone.

1477
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:57,604
She always says
nice things about me.

1478
01:27:57,639 --> 01:27:58,799
When you finally

1479
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,467
do something right,
you deserve the credit.

1480
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:01,566
Well, sir

1481
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:03,008
it's an honor to help

1482
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:05,012
the United States of America.

1483
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:06,274
I feel exactly
the same way, soldier.

1484
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,111
You don't think you're going
to be able to get away

1485
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:10,515
with a bureaucratic pat
on the butt, do you?

1486
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:11,916
Well, I'm hoping to.

1487
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:24,559
Ooh, man down, people.

1488
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:33,105
Well... there is one thing
you can do for me.

1489
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,109
And that would be?

1490
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:37,271
All right, tracking
systems locked on.

1491
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,177
Anybody screws up
and your ass is mine.

1492
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:40,407
Block off this end
of the street.

1493
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,415
Roger that.

1494
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:42,848
All right, we're at
T minus 30 and counting.

1495
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:44,181
Is everyone in position?

1496
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:45,310
Manhole agent up.

1497
01:28:45,353 --> 01:28:48,049
Flower lady, hot dog vendor, go.

1498
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:49,681
Replace the hot dog vendor.
Come on, hustle.

1499
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:50,782
Let's go.

1500
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:52,554
This is Bird Three,
the street is secure.

1501
01:28:52,593 --> 01:28:54,117
Uh-oh, bike messenger.

1502
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,790
Hostile forces moving in.
Go on, Randall, take him out.

1503
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:57,798
Roger. T-14 descending.

1504
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:00,392
Advance the lead
operation vehicle.

1505
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:04,171
Bring in the package
as soon as I cross.

1506
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:05,263
Roger that.

1507
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:07,001
Hustle, people.

1508
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:08,008
The package is on the move.

1509
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,033
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's show time.

1510
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:13,106
How's our package?

1511
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:14,512
I forget what to say.

1512
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:15,709
But you can do this.

1513
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,717
Focus. Go.

1514
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:17,718
Huh?

1515
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:18,719
Go.

1516
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:20,084
Package dropped.

1517
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:21,986
Roger. Target locked.

1518
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,684
Jimmy, what do you say?

1519
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:33,223
The name's Tong. James Tong.

1520
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:35,292
I'm the man. I'm the man.

1521
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:36,928
Del, did you tell him
to say that?

1522
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:39,132
No. Well, sort of.

1523
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:40,140
Oh, God.

1524
01:29:40,174 --> 01:29:41,266
Come on, ladies, relax.

1525
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:42,333
He's just pumping out
pheromones.

1526
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,344
Clark, shut up.

1527
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,005
I do believe I'm in charge
of this operation.

1528
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,070
Package is locked on target.

1529
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:47,672
Why did you wear those pants?

1530
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:49,478
He's stopping.

1531
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:51,348
- What's he stopping for?
- Why is he stopping?

1532
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,182
Use the door, Jimmy.

1533
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,278
He's really
breathing heavy now.

1534
01:29:53,321 --> 01:29:54,288
Have you seen her?

1535
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:55,789
He's out of his league,
if you know what I mean.

1536
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:56,790
Shh!

1537
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:58,086
- He's like a hunter.
- It's the gallery owner.

1538
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:00,151
Randall, quiet.

1539
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:01,593
Nice.

1540
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:02,994
Clark, please,
would you focus?

1541
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:04,088
He's about to speak.

1542
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:04,860
Open your mouth.

1543
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:06,161
Hi.

1544
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,292
- He said, "Hi."
- Hi.

1545
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,302
That's the girl?

1546
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:10,031
He came up with that on his own.

1547
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,095
She's not that pretty.

1548
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:12,265
Jimmy, smile, come on.

1549
01:30:12,306 --> 01:30:13,933
Move on to something else...
quick.

1550
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:15,272
He doesn't look so good.

1551
01:30:15,309 --> 01:30:16,298
He doesn't look so good.

1552
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:17,368
He doesn't look so good.

1553
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:18,902
- Jimmy? Jimmy?
- He doesn't look so good.

1554
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:19,742
Clark, give him a line.

1555
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:20,748
Steena, shut up.

1556
01:30:20,782 --> 01:30:22,613
- Just look deep into her eyes...
- Clark, no.

1557
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:23,378
That crap doesn't work...

1558
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,407
Looks like
he's hyperventilating.

1559
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:25,510
If I remember rightly,
it worked...

1560
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:26,918
Don't listen to them.
Listen to me.

1561
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:29,684
I can't think with you
screaming in my ear.

1562
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:30,816
Everybody calm down, all right?

1563
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:31,825
Not you, her.

1564
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:33,121
No, no, her, her.

1565
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:34,355
Look deep into her eyes...

1566
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:35,453
It's me.

1567
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:37,487
...and tell her you had a dream
about her last night.

1568
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:38,294
Clark, be quiet.

1569
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:39,321
Del, will you shut up?

1570
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:40,391
Uh...

1571
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,096
I hate to say this, Jimmy

1572
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:44,229
but don't take advice
from women about women.

1573
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:45,296
Shut up.

1574
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:46,328
Clark, you've been reassigned.

1575
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:47,500
The voices are screaming in my ear.

1576
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:48,702
Hey, if you can hear me

1577
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:50,506
wipe that look off your face.

1578
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:51,637
Remember me?

1579
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:52,646
Hooters.

1580
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:55,139
Soul patch.

1581
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:57,549
Okay, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

1582
01:30:57,585 --> 01:30:58,552
I'm the love of my life...

1583
01:30:58,586 --> 01:30:59,553
No, no! No, no!

1584
01:30:59,587 --> 01:31:00,554
You're the love of my life.

1585
01:31:00,588 --> 01:31:02,385
No, you never tell them
you love them, Jimmy.

1586
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:04,550
Can you have... dinner with me?

1587
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:06,150
Get out.

1588
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:08,185
Pretty sure he craps
his pants, people.

1589
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:09,196
I just want to have dinner.

1590
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:10,197
Get out now.

1591
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:11,198
- Lunch?
- Now!

1592
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,290
Oh!

1593
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:13,800
All right, we're
terminating this mission.

1594
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:15,393
Pack it up and roll home.

1595
01:31:16,436 --> 01:31:19,202
I think I blew it, Mr. Devlin.

1596
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,764
Jimmy, I wrote the book
on this stuff.

1597
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:22,708
Trust me, you didn't blow it.
You outgrew her.

1598
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:23,710
Maybe.

1599
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:24,836
Tell you what.

1600
01:31:24,879 --> 01:31:26,039
Take the weekend off.
First thing Monday morning

1601
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,048
we'll head for somewhere with
more interesting prospects.

1602
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:29,982
How about Monte Carlo?

1603
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:30,984
Sounds good.

1604
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:32,451
Thanks, Mr. Devlin.

1605
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:33,920
Thanks, everybody.

1606
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:34,922
It's okay, Jimmy.

1607
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:35,923
Hang in there.

1608
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:37,424
Next time.

1609
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,892
Well, if you were trying
to get her to notice you

1610
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:40,951
mission accomplished.

1611
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:43,088
What are you planning
for the second date?

1612
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:44,119
Running at her with a knife?

1613
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,326
It's difficult for me.

1614
01:31:46,367 --> 01:31:47,334
What is so hard?

1615
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:48,892
You just have to say
something like...

1616
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:50,699
"Excuse me, you want
to go get some coffee?"

1617
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:54,504
When I around beautiful
women, I can't talk.

1618
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:57,443
Sure. Beautiful women.

1619
01:31:57,478 --> 01:31:58,706
You know, a real knockout.

1620
01:31:58,746 --> 01:32:00,611
Like the beautiful lady
in the gallery.

1621
01:32:00,648 --> 01:32:01,637
Thank you.

1622
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:03,775
Thank you very much.

1623
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:05,683
What's wrong?

1624
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,119
Nothing.

1625
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:08,883
What?

1626
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:11,323
You can't tell how I feel?

1627
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,157
You look sad.

1628
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,423
No.

1629
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:17,363
Sick?

1630
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:18,365
No.

1631
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:20,867
Constipated?

1632
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:21,994
No.

1633
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:23,435
A little.

1634
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:25,803
Tell me, what's wrong?

1635
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:29,276
It's just no guy would ever
do anything for me

1636
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,301
like what you did for her.

1637
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:32,505
Or tried to do.

1638
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,071
You know why?

1639
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:38,381
Because you are
a pain in the butt.

1640
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:40,944
Yeah, nice working
with you, too.

1641
01:32:42,988 --> 01:32:43,548
Hello.

1642
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:45,456
Delilah, excuse me.

1643
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:48,587
You want to have a coffee?

1644
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:51,257
I only drink organic green tea.

1645
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:53,556
Wrong answer.

1646
01:32:53,601 --> 01:32:55,865
You're never going
to have a boyfriend.

1647
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:56,870
Fine.

1648
01:32:56,904 --> 01:33:00,738
Coffee. I love coffee.

1649
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:02,436
You learn quick.

1650
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:07,104
Is that your happy face
or your horny face?

1651
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:09,013
I tell you later.

1652
01:33:17,725 --> 01:33:19,590
James. James...

1653
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:20,594
Tong...

1654
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:23,586
Cut.

1655
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,800
Oh...

1656
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:31,862
Couldn't tell you
what I'm about to say.

1657
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,129
Purse!

1658
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:38,178
Cut.

1659
01:33:38,212 --> 01:33:39,577
I'm sorry.

1660
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:42,305
Huh?

1661
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,154
The bird hit the guy.

1662
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:49,156
Huh?

1663
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:50,487
Is this a bunch of crap.

1664
01:33:50,524 --> 01:33:51,718
Is this a bunch crap?

1665
01:33:51,759 --> 01:33:53,158
Bunch of crap.

1666
01:33:53,194 --> 01:33:54,456
Okay.

1667
01:33:54,495 --> 01:33:57,953
You think I'm speak
very good English, huh?

1668
01:33:57,999 --> 01:34:00,263
What's in your head,
flies out your mouth.

1669
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,735
What's in your head,
fly from your mouth.

1670
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:03,964
What's in your mouth...

1671
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:06,200
That's okay. Cut.

1672
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,207
No wonder.

1673
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:09,300
This is why
you don't have a boyfriend.

1674
01:34:10,778 --> 01:34:11,767
That's...

1675
01:34:13,714 --> 01:34:16,376
That's... thought...

1676
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:17,349
Frog?

1677
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:18,317
Fraud.

1678
01:34:19,353 --> 01:34:20,320
Look at...

1679
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:22,015
Look at her ugly face.

1680
01:34:22,056 --> 01:34:23,717
Every time I look...

1681
01:34:23,758 --> 01:34:25,851
Every time, she just like this.

1682
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:29,090
How can I act?

1683
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:30,757
- Can we do a single on me?
- No.

1684
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:31,765
Action!

1685
01:34:31,799 --> 01:34:32,993
Aah...

1686
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:35,235
No, no, no.

1687
01:34:35,269 --> 01:34:36,861
Cut! Cut!

1688
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:44,240
Let's follow 'em.
They'll take us to the lab.

1689
01:34:44,278 --> 01:34:45,302
Who?

1690
01:34:46,881 --> 01:34:47,973
Let's...

1691
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:51,149
Cut.

1692
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:53,676
I got the happy partner
over here.

1693
01:34:56,924 --> 01:34:58,255
Jimmy.

1694
01:34:58,292 --> 01:34:59,259
What do you...?

1695
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:04,897
She smile the whole movie.

1696
01:35:04,932 --> 01:35:07,264
Waste of film, waste of time.

1697
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:09,963
What is she doing?

1698
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:10,766
Hit me!

1699
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:11,464
Oh, no!

1700
01:35:12,506 --> 01:35:14,098
You're fast.

1701
01:35:14,141 --> 01:35:15,472
But I'm faster.
