1
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,202
Tokuma Shoten, Studio Ghibli,
Nippon Television Network.

2
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,105
Buena Vista Home Entertainment,
Hakuhodo, Mitsubishi and Toho Present

3
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,716
If you find yourself troubled

4
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,021
by something mysterious

5
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,188
or a problem that's hard to solve

6
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,731
there's a place you can go

7
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,858
a place where...

8
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,288
Oh no!

9
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,919
Haru, are you awake?

10
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,015
Just got up!

11
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,261
Good

12
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,666
Morning

13
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,173
Really...

14
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,541
Why bother to set
your alarm clock?

15
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,005
Bye

16
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,706
Aren't you having breakfast?
It's so delicious

17
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,247
Ooh, so delicious

18
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:30,784
Not fair

19
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,448
Bye

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,380
My shoe!

21
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,247
Excuse me

22
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,887
Oh no!

23
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,289
The Kingdom is now gone

24
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,728
Yet the mountains and rivers remain

25
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,494
The castle draped in the

26
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,469
Dense greens of spring

27
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:19,997
Miss Yoshioka

28
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,472
You don't have time to sneak in
just get to your seat

29
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,472
Yes sir

30
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,143
Caught again

31
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:55,098
The Cat Returns

32
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,309
I hate this

33
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,508
Late again and embarrassed
in front of the whole class

34
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,684
Machida was laughing at me too

35
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,255
He was laughing

36
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,687
Why?

37
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,884
What's wrong with me?

38
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,195
Well, this must be a sign

39
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,458
Something even worse
is about to begin

40
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,832
Thanks for the sympathy

41
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,005
That's an unusual cat

42
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,010
What's so great about Machida?

43
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,216
He's just so cool!

44
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,151
Have you told him that?

45
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,950
He seems to have a girlfriend

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,548
She's a freshman and
very good-looking

47
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,717
So you already know

48
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,053
In case you get dumped
I'm ready to console you

49
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,688
Thanks a lot

50
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,163
I think Tsuge is cool

51
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,702
Good, if he dumps you...

52
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,511
Had something in his mouth

53
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,545
Stolen goods?

54
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,443
Hmmm...

55
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,254
What's he doing?

56
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,983
Hey cat! Watch out!

57
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,195
Anyway, it's just a cat

58
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,732
Hey, that's dangerous

59
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,273
Oh no, what's he doing?

60
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,208
Wait, Haru!

61
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,113
Good going Haru!

62
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,159
Hey! Stop that truck!

63
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,431
Cat...

64
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,502
Are you OK?

65
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,917
Thank you for saving me
from a dangerous situation

66
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,422
I hope you haven't injured yourself

67
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,665
Please excuse me,
but I really must be going now

68
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,665
Allow me to express my gratitude later

69
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,599
Don't mention it

70
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,604
Haru!

71
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,117
Ah, you broke it

72
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,287
Never mind,
a cat's life is more important

73
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,548
Did you see that?

74
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,247
Huh?

75
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,223
The cat bowed to me

76
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,752
Haru... did you hit your head?

77
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,299
I'm home

78
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,629
Don't step on that!

79
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,843
Sorry.
I can't decide which pattern to use

80
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,314
Honey. Can you make dinner?

81
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,213
Mom

82
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,216
Can cats talk?

83
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,988
Well... Let's see

84
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,193
What!?

85
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,060
Come to think of it
you said so before

86
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:40,996
Really?

87
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,624
When you were very small

88
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,034
you used to say
"I can talk with cats"

89
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,294
Did I?

90
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,398
Yes, don't you remember?

91
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,194
What's wrong?

92
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,964
I see, you're hungry

93
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,701
Do you like fish?

94
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,375
OK, take these

95
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,038
You're so dirty...

96
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,706
Good?

97
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,218
OK, OK

98
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,050
More?

99
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,348
Good girl

100
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,358
Eat them all

101
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,996
No need to thank me

102
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,090
Haru

103
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,963
Oh, Mom!

104
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,629
What were you doing?

105
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,674
Talking with a cat

106
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,141
Remember I asked you what did you
talk about with the cat?

107
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,580
Then you said, "she told me it's
tough to make a living in this world"

108
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,815
and I thought it was so funny

109
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,855
I guess that did happen

110
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,267
Anyway,
I'll get up after early tomorrow

111
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,801
in time for breakfast

112
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,387
Uhm... over here please

113
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,261
A little closer

114
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,064
Allow me to introduce

115
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,505
The King of the Kingdom of Cats

116
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,600
A King among Kings

117
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,075
The Cat King

118
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,478
That's me

119
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,282
The cat you saved today was

120
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,724
the son of the King, Prince Lune

121
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,426
Given the importance
of the matter,

122
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,761
the King himself has come to
show his gratitude

123
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,272
Uh... mmm...

124
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,941
Thank you

125
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,704
This is the program

126
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,179
From tomorrow,

127
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:34,055
countless joys will befall you

128
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:37,985
Thank you

129
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,488
See you

130
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,733
A dream?

131
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,405
You're saying...

132
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,374
it really wasn't you
who did this?

133
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,241
I have no idea

134
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,506
Then who did it?

135
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,587
Haru!

136
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,386
Haru, hurry up!

137
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,488
What is this!

138
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,092
Cattails!

139
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,430
Oh, I work too hard.
I'll be in bed today

140
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,649
No!

141
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,244
Why?

142
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,885
Haru, it's this one, see?

143
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,816
Morning!
Sorry, got to run

144
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,225
What's she up to?

145
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,126
You think she has catnip?

146
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,996
Catnip? Why?

147
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,067
Don't know

148
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,296
Hey Yoshioka!
Leave your cats at home

149
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,568
They're not mine

150
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,569
What is this?

151
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,940
It wasn't a dream

152
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,976
It was those cats that did this

153
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,910
Was it a mistake to save a cat?

154
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,350
Haru

155
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,891
Wha... What is it?

156
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,088
Did you get rid of
the catnip smell?

157
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,196
Yeah, it seems OK

158
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,890
and the cats aren't after me anymore

159
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,431
That's good

160
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,126
Yeah

161
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,198
Say, can I ask you a favor?

162
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,939
Can you take my turn
for clean-up?

163
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,201
Tsuge has a game today

164
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,972
and I can't make it,
if I don't leave right now

165
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,111
Please!

166
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,876
Oh... sure...

167
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,115
Clean-up. Right?

168
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,980
Thank you Haru!

169
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,831
Tsuge! Go for it!

170
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,834
Hurray Tsuge!
You're so cool!

171
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,726
Be careful of the step

172
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,595
Thanks

173
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,728
Ouch, that hurt

174
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,104
Oh no!

175
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,300
What a mess

176
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,876
Uh oh

177
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,051
What on earth am I doing here?

178
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,924
There you are,
Miss Haru, Miss Haru

179
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,798
You cats!
One thing after another all morning

180
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,173
We're glad you're pleased

181
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,376
NOT!

182
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,640
Why is that!?

183
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,739
This project has been taken on
by the whole kingdom

184
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,444
to express our maximum gratitude!

185
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,210
What are you saying?

186
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,312
I don't eat mice

187
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,085
I don't like cattails or catnip

188
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,660
Oh. Is that so...

189
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,987
Excuse our ignorance

190
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,793
This is unexpected

191
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,562
How shall I report to the King?

192
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,394
Sorry, did I hurt you?

193
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,163
Maybe I said too much

194
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,572
To tell the truth,
a lot happened to me recently

195
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,073
Such as?

196
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,416
Such as many things

197
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,180
I see. Is that so?

198
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:06,383
Even a beautiful lady like
Miss Haru has troubles

199
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,091
Again... that's enough

200
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,685
No, it isn't enough

201
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,560
We can't stop now

202
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,327
We'll do our best to
make you satisfied

203
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,868
You have more?

204
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,092
Yes

205
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,039
Please come visit us in
the Kingdom of Cats

206
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,834
The Kingdom of Cats?

207
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,269
It's a nice place

208
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,372
Lots of natural scenery
and good food

209
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:35,317
The whole Kingdom will
welcome Miss Haru

210
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,115
And what's more

211
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,388
The King is expecting

212
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,928
Prince Lune, who you
saved yesterday,

213
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,521
to welcome Miss Haru
as his bride

214
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,869
No way! That's impossible

215
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,769
The Prince is a cat

216
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,565
What's the problem?

217
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,702
He is a cat but he's cool!

218
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,308
Cool?

219
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,325
Well...

220
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,298
A Kingdom of Cats might be good

221
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,760
Just laying around all day

222
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,858
Exactly!

223
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,665
It might be heaven

224
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,802
Eat tons of great food
then have a nap,

225
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,433
forget all your troubles...

226
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,978
But a cat's bride...
that's going too far

227
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,911
Even if he is a prince. That's...

228
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:37,606
Huh?

229
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,779
Well then,
we'll come for you tonight

230
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,612
What do you mean?

231
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:45,519
Hey! Wait!

232
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,452
Ouch

233
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,186
That really hurts

234
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,895
Wait, give me time to think

235
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,729
That is to say... in a word...

236
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,461
What can I do?
I'm sure those cats will do it

237
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,437
They'll take me to
the Kingdom of Cats

238
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,702
They'll make me the cat's bride

239
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:14,208
No, no, no! Never!

240
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,414
Haru

241
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:17,944
Haru

242
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:19,880
Who is it?

243
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,884
Haru, the Cat Business Office

244
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,826
Find the Cat Business Office

245
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,729
Not this

246
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,726
Who is this?

247
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,495
What is the Cat Business Office

248
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,432
I'm sure they'll help you

249
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,437
A large white cat at the Crossroad
will show you the way

250
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,066
A large white cat...

251
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,740
Haru, go to the Crossroad

252
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,839
and find the Cat Business Office

253
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,025
Never heard of
the Cat Business Office

254
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,205
A large white cat...

255
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,711
But the voice was beautiful.
Might be a nice white cat

256
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,377
Oh. I'm tired

257
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,551
I'm taking a break

258
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,256
What? What is it?

259
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,793
What's this big fat cat

260
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,229
What are you doing here?

261
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,631
A large white cat!

262
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:37,731
Is this it?

263
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,898
Hey you, do you know
the Cat Business Office?

264
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,639
I need your help

265
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,315
I mistook you for a different person...
oops, a different cat

266
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,250
I'm sorry I sat on you

267
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,358
Follow me

268
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,656
You are the one

269
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,424
Hey, wait for me!

270
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,552
Hey, isn't there an easier way?

271
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,792
Is this revenge?

272
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,858
Because I said you're fat?

273
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,049
What a strange place

274
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,504
Where's the Cat Business Office?

275
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,176
Are you listening?

276
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,113
I have a big problem

277
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,085
These cats are taking me
to their kingdom!

278
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,334
Is... this...

279
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,984
Hey, Baron!
You got a visitor!

280
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,359
Cut the theatrics and just come out!

281
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,688
Welcome to the Cat Business Office!

282
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,586
Cool...

283
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:04,533
This place is in a dimension
a little different from yours.

284
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,804
A world for beings who have souls

285
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,600
When people create something

286
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,439
with all their heart and hopes,
the creation is given a soul,

287
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,871
like me and him

288
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,218
Oh my gosh!

289
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,091
He is Toto. A gargoyle with a soul

290
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,532
Baron, it's quite rare for you
to have a visitor

291
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,132
Yes. And a quite charming one,
don't you think?

292
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,801
Baron...?

293
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,573
I'm Baron Humbert von Gikkingen

294
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,402
The person who created me named me so

295
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,440
So that's why you're called Baron

296
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,408
I heard your story

297
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,413
Trouble with some cats from
the Cat Kingdom?

298
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,349
That's right

299
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,115
I saved a cat from being run over

300
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,885
Now they're saying, in return,
they want to take me to their kingdom

301
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:01,959
In return?

302
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,923
Heh, it figures,

303
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,953
too kind for your own good

304
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:12,102
You shouldn't have bothered

305
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,431
Your mind is nasty as ever, Muta

306
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:18,066
You can't appreciate the kindness
which saved a cat

307
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,671
And she is in trouble for it, right?

308
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,771
Never mix in somebody else's business

309
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,176
Where did you meet this girl?

310
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,513
At the Crossroad place

311
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,953
She already knew about this place

312
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,112
Hmmm

313
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,793
Uh, I heard a voice,

314
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,590
though I don't know who it was

315
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:39,356
A voice?

316
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,955
You listened to some strange voice!?

317
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,762
How naive can you get... Yeow!

318
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,397
What are you doing?

319
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,630
Why don't you hold your tongue!

320
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,439
You stay out of this...!!

321
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,405
Don't fight because of me...

322
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,077
You said your name was...?

323
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,873
Oh, it's Haru.
My name is Haru

324
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,310
Okay, Haru.
Please do come in

325
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,881
Don't worry about them

326
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:05,712
You lousy black bird!

327
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,258
Don't you even know I'm a crow?

328
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,556
Come out from the dark, you fowl!

329
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,655
Nobody can miss a giant
marshmallow like you!

330
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:15,755
You big hog of a cat!

331
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,859
Go get fried, chicken wings!

332
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,130
Shut up, moo shoo pork!

333
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,229
Pollo loco

334
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,072
I'm coming in

335
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,411
Oh... This place is gorgeous

336
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,679
Now, do come in and have a seat

337
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:36,583
Thank you

338
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,220
Any lemon or milk with your tea?

339
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,314
Milk, please

340
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,699
You have a beautiful office

341
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,268
Here you are

342
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,436
Thank you

343
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,638
Cute

344
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,239
It's my special blend

345
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,641
Can't guarantee the flavor though,
it's different each time

346
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:09,817
This is good!

347
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,285
This is really good

348
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,885
Then. You're lucky

349
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,888
How can you drink green leaves?

350
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:20,123
Too refined for your
tongue, I bet

351
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,994
Go catch a worm, bird

352
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,399
Muta...

353
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,898
Tell me about
the Kingdom of Cats again

354
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,240
That whole place is fake,
a place for

355
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,741
those who don't have
a mind of their own

356
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,335
Mind of their own...

357
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,877
One of the Cat King's men said.

358
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:41,349
They want me to marry their Prince...

359
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,917
Why not?
A cat's bride?

360
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:44,954
What!?

361
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,717
Might not be so bad

362
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,256
This is going nowhere

363
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,250
Could be an interesting experience

364
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,584
I see

365
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,664
I did want to visit
the Kingdom of Cats once

366
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,435
This might be a good opportunity

367
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:02,664
How brave of you, Baron,
but I think I'll give it a miss

368
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,372
You are coming with me

369
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,502
No thanks. It's not my territory

370
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,339
You're not taking her, are you?

371
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,641
That won't be wise

372
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,515
But I can't leave her here all alone

373
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,991
Babysitting isn't my thing either

374
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:21,922
Are you busy?

375
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,288
Not really

376
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,554
Um, I think I'll go home

377
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,631
I'm just making trouble for all of you

378
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,561
I started all this mess

379
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,869
I have to solve this myself

380
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,136
I see

381
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,740
I'm sorry
I couldn't be of any help

382
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,444
Okay, okay, I'll do it

383
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,818
I'll just hang around for a while

384
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,319
You're a good cat, Muta!

385
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,219
It's set then

386
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,090
Haru, you can come back now

387
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,388
But...

388
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,158
Muta complains a lot

389
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,599
but doesn't actually mean it

390
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,330
I see

391
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,836
He is actually nice then

392
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,170
That's right

393
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,511
I'm not listening

394
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,679
Thank you for your help,

395
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,179
Moota

396
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,574
Moota?
Did you say Moo!?

397
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,183
Are you saying I am a fat cow!

398
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,948
No, you're just fat... oops!

399
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:25,989
Ha ha. This girl is not bad

400
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,588
No way I am going to help!

401
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:31,890
Didn't we have some delicious
chiffon cake in the cupboard?

402
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,327
Where?

403
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,025
On the upper right shelf

404
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,591
Why didn't you say so

405
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,863
Let's have a piece before we start

406
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,641
I'll go get my special
mulberries then!

407
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,042
It seems like this is
going to be fun

408
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,911
Let me help too

409
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,945
Haru, you need to think about

410
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,621
how you can learn to be yourself

411
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,291
Then, you should have nothing to fear

412
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,625
Okay

413
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:08,394
Baron! Give me a hand.
I'm putting some whipped cream on top

414
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,064
We're really going full-scale

415
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,601
Of course we are

416
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,297
Maybe, I'll find something here

417
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:19,471
Yes

418
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:20,938
Is that Toto at the door?

419
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,480
Miss Haru. We have come for you

420
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,312
No!

421
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,086
What is this?

422
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,088
Not good

423
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,035
You promised to help me!

424
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:49,030
Baron, horde of cats headed this way

425
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,529
You're blind as a bat!

426
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,574
After them!

427
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,545
Owwwww...

428
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,482
Miss Haru, we looked
all over for you!

429
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,177
I'm going home

430
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,456
Careful!

431
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:07,955
Let me off! Take me back!

432
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,287
I am going back, this instant!

433
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:13,490
You must be having
pre-marriage blues

434
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,997
I am not!

435
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,461
Things got a bit out of hand

436
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:23,806
Owwwwww

437
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,399
Hey, you. Wait. Ouch, let go!

438
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,802
Muta, and Baron!

439
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,676
Let go, I'm telling you!

440
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,272
Toto, now!

441
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,480
Don't let go!

442
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,053
Why did we get out of the way!

443
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,488
No choice

444
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,559
I'm really mad now!

445
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,159
Yeay!

446
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,922
This is over the weight limit!

447
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:50,727
Toto!

448
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:51,927
I see it

449
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,485
Where are you going!?

450
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,418
Out-maneuvered

451
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,127
Go up

452
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,098
OK

453
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,473
Now what?

454
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,716
The wind. Follow the lights

455
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,913
OK!

456
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,397
Ooooh...

457
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,570
I landed on my back...

458
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,736
Why?

459
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,501
Where am I?

460
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,945
Muta? Did you get bigger?

461
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,853
No. You got smaller

462
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:22,254
Why?

463
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,659
Because we're here

464
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,505
This is the Kingdom of Cats?

465
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,120
This is it

466
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,351
Wow, cats really live here

467
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,484
Well, this is their kingdom,
you know

468
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:28,824
Hey, come on

469
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,599
Ahh. It's so nice and relaxing here

470
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,396
We should find a way out
and go back

471
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,338
Just a little longer

472
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,636
Let's get going

473
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,409
But... it feels so nice

474
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,010
No! You must go back at once

475
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,453
Hurry. Run away!

476
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,920
Hey. What a pretty cat

477
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,083
Even the cats are prettier here

478
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,424
Please,
you have no time to lose!

479
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,756
Haru,
you are not meant to be here

480
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,097
Why do you know my name?

481
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,532
Miss Haru!

482
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,401
It's that cat again

483
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,704
I am so relieved to find you

484
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:23,607
Seems we dropped you
when coming in

485
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:26,545
Your servant exceeded
our weight limit

486
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,945
Servant!?

487
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,487
No no, this is Muta

488
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:36,121
Shall we? A banquet is being
prepared in your honor

489
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,216
You are welcome to join us, Moota

490
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,220
Moota? Moo?

491
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:40,786
But I...

492
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,332
His Majesty is waiting
at the palace

493
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,264
Palace?

494
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,302
The palace is right over there

495
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,636
Oh. Really

496
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,899
Yes, indeed

497
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,173
Hey, you're not thinking of...

498
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:57,873
Maybe it's rude not to
greet the King first

499
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,246
Are you out of your mind?
Let's go!

500
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:00,942
Please, this way

501
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,212
Wait

502
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,481
Can she come with us?

503
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,482
What is your name?

504
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,426
Yuki, sir.
I serve at the royal table

505
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,325
So you work at the palace

506
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,922
Miss Haru, you'll see her later

507
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,328
Okay, I'll see you again

508
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,605
Haru

509
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,166
What's that? Creepy!

510
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,976
There's my future daughter-in-law

511
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,220
Well, I must go see her in person!

512
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,891
He's strangely familiar

513
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,074
Please change before
meeting the King

514
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,612
I need to change clothes?

515
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,178
Please wait in the next room

516
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,719
Why can't I go in with her?

517
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,753
Don't be gross

518
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,186
Gross?

519
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,257
We prepared refreshments for you

520
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,552
Okay, I'll wait

521
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,367
Not bad

522
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,103
The dress is very becoming on you

523
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,974
Prince Lune is the idol of all
female cats in this Kingdom

524
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,742
You'll be very happy with him

525
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,679
Really?

526
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,116
I mean, no, that's not why I'm here

527
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:19,287
You look lovely

528
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:24,117
You are the purrfect bride for Lune

529
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,479
Natoru, who is that cat?

530
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,575
A servant named Moota, I believe

531
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,808
Moota?

532
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,181
Never heard of him

533
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,553
No match for my stomach

534
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,493
Um, I am sorry but

535
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,198
I can't really accept marriage to...

536
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,009
I thought you already said yes?

537
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,770
That was what I was told

538
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,172
Where is the Prince?

539
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:21,515
He is away at an official function

540
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,456
Anyway, I don't really know him

541
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,752
And the Prince, he is a cat, right?

542
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,350
I'm not a cat,
so I can't marry him

543
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,968
That,
you don't need to worry about

544
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:40,799
You already are a cat

545
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,651
Wow, real cat ears

546
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,253
I'm a CAT!!

547
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,723
Muta. Where are you?

548
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,900
What happened to him?

549
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,071
He insisted on having
a bowl full and

550
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,835
dunked himself in catnip jelly

551
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:22,936
He didn't have to die like this!

552
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,773
Muta, how could you
do this to me?

553
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,412
...the banquet is ready to begin

554
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,454
No! I don't want to leave him

555
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,689
Then. He will come with us

556
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,895
Is this Miss Haru?

557
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,939
She has a perfect pair of ears!

558
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,099
Such full, attractive paws!

559
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,044
I was told you don't like mice,

560
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:02,641
so I have prepared
fresh fish for you

561
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,949
Miss Haru doesn't seem pleased

562
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,947
What do we have
for entertainment?

563
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,423
I will bring them in

564
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,817
I want something more amusing

565
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,619
Next!

566
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,483
Can't you do anything better!?

567
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,772
I shall amuse Miss Haru

568
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,081
What should we do?

569
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,249
Why not?

570
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,592
Shall we dance?

571
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,355
I can't dance meow

572
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,956
Oh no, I even sound like a cat!

573
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,259
...trust me

574
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,246
They dance well together

575
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,859
What is this...

576
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,365
I never felt like this before

577
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,661
Being a cat might
not be that bad

578
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:48,607
No, Haru. Don't lose yourself

579
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,005
You must learn to be yourself

580
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,781
I already told you that,
didn't I?

581
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:04,850
You are...

582
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,466
Stop this music!

583
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,043
You suspicious cat

584
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,645
Exactly who are you?

585
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,143
Apologies for my
belated introduction

586
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,222
There is nothing to fear

587
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,493
I am Humbert von Gikkingen

588
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,034
I have come for Haru

589
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,228
Baron!

590
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,038
Can this be?

591
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,570
What?

592
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,068
No way

593
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:52,904
Guards, get him!

594
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,020
I can't eat anymore

595
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,022
It's alive!

596
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,153
Yeay, Muta, you're alive

597
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:15,390
Uh oh

598
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:19,031
Stop, you scoundrel!

599
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:21,263
Take His Majesty
to a safe place!

600
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,531
Don't let him get away

601
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:29,443
Guests' emergency exit this way

602
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:37,781
Out of my way!

603
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,550
Muta. You're strong!

604
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,451
I didn't start it

605
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:45,454
This way

606
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,455
You're the cat...

607
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:53,130
Baron, I knew you would come

608
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,568
How do you know me?

609
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,333
I've heard about you
and your Office

610
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,905
If I had listened to you,

611
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,978
this wouldn't have happened

612
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,305
If you leave before dawn,
you can still become human

613
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:07,576
Really?

614
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,083
A secret passage to the outside

615
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:11,119
This is convenient

616
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,811
What about Muta?

617
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,533
He'll be all right.
Haru. Hurry

618
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:25,465
Yes

619
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:36,968
This is the back of the castle

620
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,015
Top of that tower leads to the exit

621
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,884
It's so tall!

622
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:46,779
You must go through the ruins
to the tower and then climb up

623
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,685
We'll make it

624
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:52,189
Good. Please take care of Haru

625
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:53,952
Wait

626
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:57,963
She is gone. I haven't even
thanked her yet

627
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,863
Haru, this is just my guess

628
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:04,634
but isn't she the one
who led you to me?

629
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:09,038
Haru, the Cat Business Office

630
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,642
Yes, that beautiful voice was hers

631
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,080
But why?

632
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:29,721
Because of you. I almost died

633
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,625
Must hurry now

634
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:32,394
Right

635
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,501
You guys, listen to me

636
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,011
Did they go in?

637
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,047
Yes, Your Majesty

638
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,410
Purrfect

639
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,344
That labyrinth was built with
our state-of-the-art technology

640
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,387
We'll enjoy the view from here

641
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,523
Tricky

642
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:58,954
The sun is still high, though

643
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,996
It's always daytime here

644
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,420
What? It is?

645
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,564
It's probably past
midnight outside

646
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,261
Then, we have to hurry!

647
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,033
This way? That way?

648
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,868
Which way should we go?

649
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:15,977
They are lost

650
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,205
It won't be easy to
get out of there

651
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,381
Right. Your Majesty?

652
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,446
Yes... we have nothing
to worry about

653
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:24,979
Where are the soldiers?

654
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,077
Over there

655
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:30,548
Let's go this way

656
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,026
We must keep trying,
one by one

657
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,053
Keep your eyes on the tower

658
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,655
You won't lose your way

659
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,060
Smart

660
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,160
Muta, you're cheating

661
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:43,168
Why get lost just 'cause
it's a maze

662
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:45,497
There he is!

663
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,439
Why does it have to be me?

664
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,776
Let's hurry while he keeps
them busy

665
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,475
Right

666
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,909
Why do I have to be the bait!

667
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,697
Get back. Haru!

668
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:29,782
You're strong!

669
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:32,114
Your cane got bent?

670
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:35,055
I was going to buy
a new one anyway

671
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,115
Used is best

672
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:45,931
Nice shot!

673
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,306
It hit one of ours!

674
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,342
What?

675
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,839
Your Majesty,
how could you?

676
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,881
Don't tell anyone, okay?

677
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,143
Excuse me, sir

678
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,913
Our men are all scattered

679
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,181
They are all lost

680
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,381
Where is Haru?

681
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,219
They already got that far!

682
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,160
Hi!

683
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,356
Welcome back

684
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,329
How's that way?

685
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,660
It's a dead end

686
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:37,213
Everything as planned

687
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,020
Is this another dead end?

688
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,856
It's getting more difficult

689
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,125
Something's wrong! There was
no wall here a minute ago

690
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:50,956
It must be your imagination

691
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,627
No, we walked through here

692
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,932
Are you saying that
walls have feet?

693
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,870
This is no wall

694
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,138
It's fake

695
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:15,821
See?

696
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,359
Good work, Haru!

697
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,791
What is all this?

698
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,426
I told them not to get in line!

699
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,600
They are getting away!

700
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,469
Your Majesty, wait!

701
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,347
Go ahead, I'll catch up with you

702
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,584
Show off!

703
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,355
No. Baron...

704
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:52,086
Don't worry!

705
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,780
Your Majesty, please,
it's dangerous

706
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,282
I can't let this happen!

707
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:19,619
I have soldiers waiting
in the tower, just in case

708
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,325
Brilliant move!

709
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,729
Good, good

710
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,976
I'm afraid the tower's
getting old...

711
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,979
This is not good at all!

712
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,048
We have no choice
but use THAT

713
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:56,421
What? No, not that!

714
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:59,461
If you do that, Your Majesty,
your image will go to shambles

715
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:00,654
Give me the button!

716
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,755
There is no such thing here

717
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,197
Here's the remote control

718
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,598
Yeay, we came out
to an opening

719
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,929
Just a bit more

720
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:16,501
Now!

721
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:22,944
What?

722
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:23,815
Hold on!

723
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,734
That was a great spectacle!

724
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,734
Let's go!

725
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,374
We're back on the ground

726
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,380
Let's see how things go

727
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,078
We have no choice

728
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,815
Come on, come on

729
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,762
Gikkingen. Nice to see you again

730
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:10,458
Haru! We'll go back to
the castle right away

731
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,335
Being a cat is not so bad

732
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,061
Do I have to learn to like mice?

733
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:19,339
It's too early to give up

734
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:38,187
What's all this?

735
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,259
Father!

736
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:45,190
Lune, you're back already?

737
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,696
His Highness the Prince!
As you were!

738
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,435
Prince?

739
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:58,111
I hurried back thanks to Yuki

740
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,647
What is all this?

741
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,114
Haru

742
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,712
Oh, Yuki

743
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,482
I'm glad we made it

744
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,114
Err. I just wanted to thank her

745
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:13,126
I thought you'd be happy

746
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,754
to have Haru as your bride

747
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,796
You don't need to
worry about me

748
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,058
I want to marry Yuki

749
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,371
What!?

750
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,074
Looks like news to everyone

751
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:27,609
This Prince is not bad

752
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,249
Yuki, look

753
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:36,809
I went to your old
home to find this

754
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:46,159
Oh, could this be
what I think it is?

755
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,865
Those cookies...
I used to love those

756
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:50,660
That's right

757
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:55,763
These are the fish cookies you gave
me when I was an orphan kitten

758
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:58,340
That kitten, that was you!

759
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:02,044
You're so beautiful now that
I didn't recognize you

760
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:03,471
Yuki

761
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:06,846
Will you accept these as a token

762
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,643
of our life together from now on

763
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:13,087
That means

764
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,817
you two are getting married?

765
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,796
Oh, I am so happy
for you Yuki!

766
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,091
Thank you, Haru!

767
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,466
If I hadn't met you then,

768
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:28,093
I could have starved
on the streets

769
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:31,298
You also saved me from danger

770
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:35,070
I didn't know you were the person
Yuki told me so much about

771
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,471
You saved both of our lives

772
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,338
How can we thank you?

773
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,206
I don't want anything

774
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:43,478
You two made me
so happy already

775
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,382
Saving a cat was a good thing

776
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,151
This is such a moving sight

777
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:56,426
So you already had a fiancée

778
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,058
I didn't know,
but that is all right

779
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:02,433
Haru, you must be disappointed

780
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,164
Not really

781
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,231
No need to be polite.
If you can't marry my son.

782
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,276
Why don't you marry me?

783
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,275
You can eat all the cookies

784
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,578
and fishes you want

785
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:15,976
How about it?

786
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,412
Just put me back
to the way I was

787
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,416
That depends on your answer

788
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,018
Are you out of your mind!?

789
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:31,458
Of course I don't want
to marry you

790
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,160
You pervert!

791
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,569
Why can't you...?

792
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:43,041
This is hilarious!

793
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:45,813
It's out of the question!

794
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,577
I admire a woman with
a mind of her own

795
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:52,554
You found yourself an ally

796
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,280
I, Renaldo Moon will
lend you a hand!

797
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:56,547
Renaldo?

798
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:57,819
Renaldo Moon?

799
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,622
That Renaldo Moon?

800
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,219
That's it!

801
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:01,990
Who?

802
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,690
Have you forgotten,
Your Majesty?

803
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:07,396
The worst, most notorious crime
in this Kingdom's history!

804
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,499
A cat suddenly came from nowhere

805
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,268
and devoured all the fish
in the lake and escaped

806
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,538
the criminal of the century,
Renaldo Moon!

807
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:16,634
Unbelievable...

808
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,008
He's a monster

809
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:21,078
Muta, you did this?
Disgraceful

810
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,412
I'll eat the whole castle this time!

811
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:28,089
Take His Majesty to a safe place!

812
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:33,088
No!

813
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:35,657
Men. Protect Haru

814
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:36,823
Yes. Sir

815
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,525
All forward!

816
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:43,431
Get that culprit!

817
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:44,528
Your Majesty!

818
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,534
Leave my father to me

819
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:49,540
Everybody, please run

820
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,307
But the tower has fallen

821
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,746
It's still connected to the other side

822
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:01,448
Strange...

823
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:03,149
Oh no, it's dawn

824
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:03,918
Leave it to me!

825
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,619
What? Are you... doing!?

826
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,288
Don't!

827
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,861
Haru, run!
We'll be right behind you!

828
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,129
Take care!

829
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:15,803
You too

830
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,640
Thanks, Yuki

831
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:25,738
I wasn't wrong

832
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,648
Saving a cat,

833
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,741
feeling lost and down.

834
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:33,380
That was all part of
finding out who I am

835
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:38,824
You go ahead!

836
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:39,860
Thanks

837
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:41,886
Where is Father?

838
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,163
Up there

839
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,661
Father, you'll hurt yourself.
Please come down

840
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,662
What a rash thing to do

841
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,363
I will bring His Majesty back down

842
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,412
We'll settle this with a duel!

843
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:09,188
My pleasure!

844
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:10,183
Baron!

845
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:11,554
Take care of Haru!

846
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:12,423
Right

847
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,843
I win, King

848
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,636
Drat!

849
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:18,423
I've heard about a statue of a cat
that doesn't mind his own business

850
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,758
Had no idea you were this good

851
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:24,999
I heard you were just a window
display standing in some back alley

852
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:30,000
You should have come to
my Kingdom and joined me

853
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,936
Unfortunately, I'm quite happy
with my present way of life

854
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:42,681
Where am I!?

855
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:45,219
What did you do?

856
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:50,018
I didn't do a thing

857
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:53,284
With the tower collapsed this much,

858
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:56,797
I wouldn't be surprised if the exit
moved to a different point

859
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,022
I must go!

860
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,168
Miss Haru!

861
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:06,970
I should have foreseen this

862
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,840
But look! Haru is human again!

863
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:19,746
I think I'm going to fall

864
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:22,323
oh no, I'm falling

865
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:26,594
I'm going down!

866
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,530
Haru!

867
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,839
Muta, please don't say I'm heavy

868
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:43,935
Hang on... but next time...

869
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:47,849
loose some weight!

870
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:01,929
I can't hold on!

871
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,267
Haru!

872
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,300
I'm going to die!

873
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,736
You're not dead yet!
Open your eyes!

874
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:16,504
Baron?

875
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:17,939
Straighten up

876
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,411
and look down!

877
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,211
I can't!

878
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,409
Trust me!

879
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,498
Are we... still alive?

880
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,191
Yes!

881
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,563
I think so!

882
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:53,178
You know what?

883
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,614
We look fantastic!

884
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:08,821
What is this?

885
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,225
There are so many of them

886
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:13,427
We're saved

887
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,141
Hey, Muta!

888
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:24,804
How is it, being saved by birds?

889
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:25,744
Toto!

890
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:27,839
Oh, it's lousy black bird

891
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,474
Thanks for saving us, Toto

892
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:33,082
Glad I had my friends
waiting up here

893
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,650
Doesn't it hurt walking on them?

894
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:37,919
You're light as a feather, Haru

895
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:38,789
Really?

896
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:40,555
I disagree

897
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,925
Look. Haru!

898
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,924
It's my school!

899
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,330
I'm home.
I was able to come back!

900
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:50,697
Everybody, thank you so much!

901
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,676
Yes! They made it!

902
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,213
Hooray. Miss Haru!

903
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,440
I'm relieved

904
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,346
Take care, Haru!

905
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,120
Your Majesty!

906
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:13,556
Natori

907
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:16,654
My time on the throne is over

908
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:19,493
Then I must resign with you

909
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,872
Toto, thank you

910
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:36,044
My heart is still pounding

911
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,141
Of course

912
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,310
But it was a bit fun

913
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:40,886
Yeah, right

914
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:44,587
Haru has to go to school,

915
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:48,153
so she'd better go home and rest

916
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:49,896
Yeah

917
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,325
Is this going to be goodbye?

918
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,659
Must do one last thing

919
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:11,910
Baron, I might have
a crush on you

920
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:16,755
I admire your sincerity, Haru

921
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:24,864
Haru. When you really need us,

922
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,696
our doors will open to you again

923
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:32,538
Until then, goodbye!

924
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,547
Goodbye

925
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,058
Thank you!

926
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:54,488
Baron! Toto!
You too, Muta!

927
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,164
What do you mean, me too?

928
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,801
Me too?

929
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,168
Oh no, better get up

930
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,708
Morning

931
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:49,281
Why are you up so early?

932
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,680
Today is Sunday

933
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,049
I'm going to the movies
with Hiromi

934
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:54,816
Going early before
it gets crowded

935
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:57,347
I better get going

936
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,959
I made eggs and salad for you

937
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:01,654
What?

938
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:03,254
I already ate so please
help yourself

939
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,026
There is also English tea
in the pot

940
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:08,561
And about the tea

941
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:11,364
That's Haru's special blend

942
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:15,533
It's a bit different each time,
so no guarantees about the flavor

943
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:19,138
I see...

944
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:25,476
Hey. Smells good

945
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:31,254
Haru! News from a reliable source!

946
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,021
What's the big fuss about?

947
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,758
Machida, he broke up!

948
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,666
Oh, he did, huh?

949
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,966
What kind of reaction is that?

950
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,006
What?

951
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:48,099
Don't you have more
to say than that?

952
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,404
No

953
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,671
It doesn't matter anymore

954
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,788
Did something happen, Haru?

955
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:05,552
No

956
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:06,423
You're lying

957
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,120
No. Honestly

958
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:10,996
How about you, Hiromi?

959
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,089
What?

960
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,691
How is it going with
you and Tsuge?

961
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,464
Err, no, nothing at all
