1
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,200
Miss Carmichael please,
Dr. Petersen is ready for you.

2
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,680
Sorry I have to go, had a perfect
hand, would've beaten all of you.

3
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
- Harry will take you Miss Carmichael.
- Thank you.

4
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,480
Watch her carefully,
don't take your eyes off her.

5
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,080
- How are you today, Harry?
- Fine.

6
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,760
- You look a little bilious.
- lt's the light.

7
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,080
- I worry about you, dear.
- I'll be all right.

8
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,920
Must we dash into
Dr. Petersen's office?

9
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,120
Can't we go sit somewhere
in private...

10
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,560
- and talk, just you and I?
- I'd love it, if I had time.

11
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,600
Would you?

12
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,760
Come in.

13
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,840
You ruined a very interesting
card game, Dr. Petersen.

14
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,760
- You may go now, Harry.
- I'll be outside.

15
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,120
- I hope you feel better today, Mary.
- Well, I don't.

16
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,960
- You will.
- This whole thing is ridiculous.

17
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,640
- What whole thing, Mary?
- Psychoanalysis, it's so boring...

18
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,440
Lying there on the couch,
like some dreary nitwit, telling all.

19
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
You can't expect to get anywhere...

20
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,400
listening to me babble about my
idiotic childhood. Really?

21
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,440
My patients always regard me
as a nuisance during our first talks.

22
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,000
I see, it's my subconscious
putting up a fight...

23
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,720
- lt doesn't want me cured.
- Exactly...

24
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,120
it wants to continue
enjoying your disease.

25
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,720
Our job is to
make you understand why.

26
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,920
When you know why
you do something...

27
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,960
and when you first
started doing it...

28
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,720
- Then you can start curing yourself.
- You mean I've been telling you lies.

29
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,400
The usual proportion.

30
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,480
You're right.
I've been lying like mad...

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,960
I hate men, I loathe them.

32
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
If one so much as touches me
I want to sink my teeth...

33
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,040
into his hand
and bite it off.

34
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,920
In fact I did that once.
Would you care to hear about it?

35
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,440
- Tell me anything you remember.
- We were dancing...

36
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,920
He kept asking me to marry him,
panting in my ear...

37
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,200
I suddenly pretended
I was going to kiss him...

38
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,200
and sank my teeth into his moustache.
Bit it clear off.

39
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,760
You're laughing at me. That smug
face of yours doesn't take me in...

40
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,720
You just want me to tell you all this
so you can feel superior to me.

41
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,120
You and your drooling science.
I detest you.

42
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,640
I never want to see
that nasty face of yours again.

43
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,720
I can't bear you. You and your
nickelsworth of nothing.

44
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,200
- Come on, Miss Carmichael.
- Silly fool...

45
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,640
letting a creature like that
worry me. Miss Frozen Puss.

46
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,960
Dr. Floreau. I want to talk
to you alone...

47
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
I can't stand that woman.

48
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,080
- I'll see you later, Mary.
- Come on Miss Carmichael.

49
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,680
Mercheson must be out of his mind
to assign Carmichael to you.

50
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,760
You may report your findings
to the new head when he arrives.

51
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,240
You can't treat a veteran like her
without some inside information.

52
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,840
I have done much research
on emotional and love difficulties.

53
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,760
Research, my eye.

54
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,600
I've watched your work for 6 months,
it's brilliant, but lifeless.

55
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,240
There's no intuition in it.

56
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,960
You approach all your problems
with an icepack on your head.

57
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,840
- Are you making love to me?
- I will in a moment.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm just clearing
the ground first.

59
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,240
I'm trying to convince you that
your lack of emotional experience...

60
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,160
is bad for you as a doctor...

61
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,040
and fatal for you as a woman.

62
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,160
I've heard that argument from
a number of amorous psychiatrists...

63
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,400
- wanting to make me a better doctor.
- I've got a much better argument...

64
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,440
- I'm terribly fond of you.
- Why?

65
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,400
- lt's like embracing a textbook.
- Why do you do it then?

66
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,080
Because your not a textbook. You're
a sweet, pulsing woman underneath.

67
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,240
I sense it every time
I come near to you.

68
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,880
You sense only your own desires
and pulsations.

69
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,440
- Mine in no way resemble them.
- Stop it. I'm mad about you.

70
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,600
- I'm afraid I'm boring you.
- No.

71
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,680
Your attitudes
are very interesting.

72
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,080
I feel exactly like Miss Carmichael.
I'd like to throw a book at you...

73
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,840
But I won't.

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,920
- May I borrow this?
- Certainly.

75
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,160
Forgive me for my criticism.
I think I better stick to books.

76
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,120
- And another thing...
- Pardon me for marching in...

77
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,080
but I'm spreading the tidings.
My successor will be due any moment.

78
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,040
Well, Dr. Mercheson, it's been
a pleasure working under you.

79
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,320
Thank you very much.
Coming, Dr. Petersen?

80
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm in no mad hurry
to welcome Dr. Edwardes.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,240
It's hard to imagine
this place without you.

82
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,800
- I sort of go with the fixtures.
- More than that, you are Green Manors.

83
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,880
- lt seems unfair.
- You're very young in the profession.

84
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,000
You haven't learned the basic secret,
the old must make way for the new...

85
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,040
particularly when he's suspected
of a touch of senility.

86
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,000
That's ridiculous, the directors
should realise you're much better.

87
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,840
You've been like a new man
since your vacation.

88
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,800
The board's as fair and all-knowing
as a hospital board can be.

89
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,240
I agree, I'm as able and brilliant
as ever, but having crumbled once...

90
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,000
- I might crumble again.
- You were overworked.

91
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,800
A charming diagnosis
for a broken down horse.

92
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,680
I shall always remember
your cheerfulness today as...

93
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,800
- a lesson in how to accept reality.
- Don't be taken in by my happy air...

94
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,680
it's the least difficult way of
saying goodbye to 20 years.

95
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,520
Yes, I know...
Come in.

96
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,120
Your mail, Dr. Petersen.
And Mr. Garmes.

97
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,840
Come in, Mr. Garmes.

98
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,280
You're not leaving today?
I'll see you again?

99
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,160
I'll hover around for a while...

100
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,240
Like a mother hen, at least until
Dr. Edwardes is firmly on the list.

101
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,440
- How do you feel today, Mr. Garmes?
- Somewhat better, Doctor...

102
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,880
the thing seems a little
less troublesome.

103
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,360
May I do that for you, Doctor?

104
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,320
No, thank you, no. I can
do this myself very well.

105
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,720
Please sit down, I'll be
with you in a moment.

106
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,640
- That's the mighty Anthony Edwardes.
- He's younger than I expected.

107
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,200
He's only brought one suitcase.
Perhaps he doesn't mean to stay long.

108
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,360
Leave those daydreams
to Dr. Mercheson.

109
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,240
Gentlemen, our new chief.
Dr. Anthony Edwardes.

110
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,880
- Dr. Floreau.
- How do you do?

111
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,240
- I'm Dr. Graff.
- How do you do?

112
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,640
- Dr. Hamish.
- How do you do?

113
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,320
There's still some staff members
missing, Dr. Edwardes.

114
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,400
These are your quarters.

115
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,800
They're very festive
for an institution.

116
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,360
Dr. Edwardes, Dr. Mercheson.

117
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,640
How do you do? I've heard
a great deal about you, sir.

118
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,680
And I naturally, about you.

119
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
- You're younger than I thought.
- My age hasn't caught up with me yet.

120
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,920
Mine has. I'm pleased to hand over
the reins to steadier hands.

121
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,680
I'm leaving you my library, which
contains, amongst other items...

122
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,440
"your latest volume, ""The labyrinth
of the guilt complex""..."

123
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,160
an excellent work. I hope
Green Manors will inspire others.

124
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,680
I'm very grateful.

125
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,160
I don't know the formal words
for an abdication, Dr. Edwardes...

126
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,200
May I say merely that these quarters
which I've occupied for 20 years...

127
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,240
are now yours.
Will you excuse me?

128
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I spent a half hour with Dr. Edwardes.
I must say I was most impressed.

129
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,800
I intend to learn
a great deal from Dr. Edwardes...

130
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,520
I think we all can from a man
of such obvious talent.

131
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,760
- You're familiar with his work?
- I've read all his books...

132
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,840
a very keen, unorthodox mind.

133
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,840
It'd be dreadful if Dr. Mercheson's
successor was unworthy of him.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,520
He's joining us.

135
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,720
I think you know everyone here,
Dr. Edwardes.

136
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,360
No, not yet.

137
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,640
- This is Dr. Petersen.
- How do you do?

138
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,560
Dr. Edwardes.

139
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,800
Dr. Hamish has been showing
me the grounds.

140
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,720
A remarkable institution
must be beautiful in the summer.

141
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,960
I pointed out to Dr. Edwardes
our various open air diversions.

142
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,400
Dr. Mercheson always argued we didn't
do enough in that direction, I agree.

143
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,960
Let me warn you that Dr. Petersen
is a frustrated gymnast.

144
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,360
Dr. Floreau considers anything beyond
sitting and standing gymnastics.

145
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,240
- I imagine you're very fond of sport.
- Yes, I am...

146
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,240
I miss them, particularly
winter sports.

147
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,160
- Did you show Dr. Edwardes the grove?
- Yes, yes indeed.

148
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,280
That's where we hope to have
our new swimming pool.

149
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,600
- I'm a great believer in a pool.
- There's a perfect spot for one.

150
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,640
Not an oblong one, but an
irregular pool, something...

151
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,520
something like this,
you know?

152
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,760
The bath houses should be here...

153
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,520
I take it that the supply of linen
at this institution is inexhaustable.

154
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,000
Forgive me.

155
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,680
That reminds me of my professor
in psychiatry, Dr. Brulov...

156
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,880
He could never stand
a sauce bottle on the table...

157
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,600
or even a salt shaker,
they took his apetite away.

158
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,920
I remember once
at a banquet in his honour...

159
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,800
he refused to sit at the speaker's
table because he was surrounded by...

160
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,800
by ketchup.

161
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,560
Last night, a dimple appeared in your
cheek, that was never there before.

162
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,240
And I detected the outcroppings of a
mother instinct toward Dr. Edwardes.

163
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,160
I detest that sort of
high school talk.

164
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,040
Your reactions have upset
one of my pet theories about you...

165
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,640
that you are immune
to psychoanalysts...

166
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,200
and would end up in the arms
of some bold nut with spiked hair.

167
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,040
If I were looking for that type,
I would've long ago adored you.

168
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,120
Come in.

169
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,120
I... excuse me.
It's from Dr. Edwardes.

170
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,360
Love notes already,
the frank school of science.

171
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,680
I didn't want to come to this
institution, but my brother insisted.

172
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,040
I can see no sense in it myself.

173
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,600
You see I'm not suffering from a
hallucination, my guilt is very real.

174
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,840
I know, Dr. Edwardes,
that I killed my father...

175
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,840
And I'm willing to pay
the penalty.

176
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,400
Come in.

177
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,320
Thank you for coming so soon.

178
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,800
I've been listening to Mr. Garmes
and I thought you might help me out.

179
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,680
Mr. Garmes, you shouldn't have
disturbed Dr. Edwardes.

180
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,200
It's all right. I'm very interested
in his case.

181
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,760
I knew you would be, he fits your
chapters on the guilt complex.

182
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,200
Would you mind telling me
what you're talking about?

183
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
You're here to see if we can cure
your guilt complex by psychoanalysis.

184
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,680
I have no guilt complex.
I know what I know...

185
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,560
- I killed my father...
- No you didn't...

186
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,480
that's a misconception
that's taken hold of you.

187
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,640
I'm sorry Doctor,
you were talking to him.

188
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,840
No, go on.

189
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,880
People often feel guilty over
something they never did...

190
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,840
it usually goes back to childhood.

191
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,040
A child often wishes something
terrible would happen to someone...

192
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,000
and if something does happen,
the child believes he has caused it.

193
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,840
He grows up with a guilt complex over
a sin that was a child's bad dream.

194
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,440
What I'm thinking isn't
true then?

195
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,240
No, and by analysing yourself,
you'll see that.

196
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
Would you care to go back
to your room, Mr. Garmes?

197
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,920
Harry.

198
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,240
We better put him on drugs
for a few days, he looks agitated.

199
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,880
His conviction is curious.

200
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,120
But you've encountered such cases
very often...

201
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,640
you described them perfectly
in your book.

202
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,840
Yes...

203
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,120
Yes, so I did.

204
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,720
- Would you mind doing me a favour?
- Not at all, Doctor.

205
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,600
I've a headache. I'd like to take
the afternoon off, with you.

206
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,120
I understand you're not on duty
till after dinner.

207
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
- I intended typing up...
- I need some fresh air...

208
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
and you look like
it might do you good.

209
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,880
I was going to lunch with Dr. Hamish.
He has a new patient, a cleptomaniac.

210
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,400
Cleptomaniacs for lunch, they'll
steal the food out of your mouth.

211
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,360
Excuse me.

212
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,880
Hello.

213
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,880
Yes, Dr. Edwardes.

214
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,640
What? Yes, Anthony Edwardes.

215
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,920
Who? Sorry,
I don't get your name.

216
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,720
Norma Cramer?

217
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,840
Please, Miss Cramer, I'm very
busy and I don't know you.

218
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,120
Some girl, claiming to be...

219
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,520
I hate practical jokes, don't you?

220
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
"People calling up
and chirping, ""Guess who I am?"""

221
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,640
Sounds like an ex-patient.
They're always full of coy tricks.

222
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,960
Very likely.
Come on, let's go.

223
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,120
We'll look at some sane trees, normal
grass and clouds without complexes.

224
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,800
I think the greatest harm done to
the human race was done by poets.

225
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,800
Poets are dull, most of them,
but not especially fiendish.

226
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,880
They keep filling peoples's heads
with delusions about love...

227
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,840
writing as if it were a symphony
orchestra, or a flight of angels.

228
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,880
- Which it isn't?
- Of course not...

229
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,160
People fall in love because they
respond to certain hair colouring...

230
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,320
or mannerisms that
remind them of their parents.

231
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,400
- Or sometimes for no reason at all.
- But the point is that...

232
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,920
people read about love as one
thing and experience it as another.

233
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,280
Or they expect kisses to be
like lyrical poems...

234
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,320
embraces to be like
Shakesperian drama.

235
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,960
Then when they find out differently,
they get sick and need analysis?

236
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,480
Yes, very often.

237
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,960
Professor, you're suffering
from mogo on the gogo.

238
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,120
I beg your pardon?

239
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
- You can't get through there.
- Of course I can...

240
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,400
I've been through here
many times.

241
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,280
- Hurt?
- Not at all.

242
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,600
- Here.
- I'm all right.

243
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,080
- I usually come here alone.
- That doesn't sound like fun.

244
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,960
I haven't done it for fun.
Isn't this beautiful?

245
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,480
Perfect.

246
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,760
Lunch. What'll you have?
Ham or liverwurst?

247
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,040
Liverwurst.

248
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,400
Has anybody seen
our new chief today?

249
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,760
He has been tied up.

250
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
He frisked off with Dr. Petersen
at noon.

251
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,320
It's odd, spending his first day
running after her...

252
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,080
like a drooling college boy.

253
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,280
It'll do her good to be
drooled over...

254
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,280
poor girl's withering away
with science.

255
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,200
I was telling her recently something
vital was missing from her life.

256
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,840
Don't get up, I came
because I heard Mr. Garmes...

257
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,960
- became agitated again.
- Yes, I gave him a sedative.

258
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,640
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

259
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,120
Nonsense, you look as if
you had an instructive time.

260
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,840
- lnstructive?
- Gentlemen, notice her stocking...

261
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,640
the lady's been climbing trees.

262
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,720
Or lolling in a briar patch.

263
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,400
No, it's trees,
there are leaves in her hair.

264
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Allow me, Dr. Petersen.

265
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,080
You're surpassing yourself
as a charmer.

266
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,960
- Don't run away, have some coffee.
- Dr. Petersen's already eaten...

267
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,720
as one can tell from the mustard
on her finger...

268
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,560
I'd say hotdogs
on the state highway.

269
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,600
Would you really? Your diagnosis
is as usual, wrong...

270
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,400
Not hotdogs, liverwurst.

271
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,400
I'm sorry I have to leave
this nursery, I must see Mr. Garmes.

272
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,920
Looks as if we have Casanova himself
at the head of Green Manors...

273
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,720
Did you notice her blush
everytime we mentioned his name?

274
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,400
It's very late.

275
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,440
I was going to read your book
again. I'd like to discuss it...

276
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,720
I've never discussed
an author's work with him...

277
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,000
At school we had several literary
professors, but that was different.

278
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,120
- I sound rather nervous, don't I?
- Not at all.

279
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,760
I thought I wanted to discuss your
book, I'm amazed at the subterfuge...

280
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
I don't want to discuss it.

281
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,680
I understand.

282
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,560
It's remarkable to discover
one isn't what one thought.

283
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,560
I've always been aware
of what was in my mind...

284
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,760
And you're not now?

285
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,720
It's quite ridiculous.

286
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,520
I was stupid to come in here
like a distracted child.

287
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,640
You're very lovely.

288
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,120
Don't talk that way, you'll
think I came in to hear that.

289
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,360
I know why you came in.

290
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,520
Why?

291
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,920
Because something
has happened to us.

292
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,920
But it doesn't happen like that,
in a day.

293
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,400
It happens in a moment sometimes.
I felt it this afternoon.

294
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,760
Like lightening striking.

295
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,560
It strikes rarely.

296
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,200
I don't understand
how it happened.

297
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,880
- What is it?
- lt's not you...

298
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,000
- it's something about your robe.
- My robe? I don't understand.

299
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,960
Forgive me, something struck me...

300
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,960
I've been having a bad time
with my nerves lately, your robe...

301
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,040
- the dark lines...
- You're ill.

302
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,640
I'll be all right.

303
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,560
Hello. Yes, Dr. Edwardes.

304
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,520
Yes, yes. What?

305
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,800
Where is he?
I'll be there right away.

306
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,800
Garmes has tried to murder
Floreau, then cut his own throat.

307
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,600
- ls it bad?
- I think so, he's in surgery.

308
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,160
I'll be right along.

309
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,360
He's lost a lot of blood,
but he'll pull through.

310
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,640
- What's the pulse?
- 140.

311
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,600
It's going down.

312
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,800
- Why are the lights out?
- What do you mean?

313
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,520
It's dark, that's why he did it,
because the lights are out.

314
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,840
Put them on! And the doors,
unlock them...

315
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,200
- You can't keep people in cells.
- Dr. Edwardes.

316
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,680
Fools babbling about guilt complexes,
what do you know about them?

317
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,320
He did it. He told me,
he killed his father...

318
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,640
Put the lights on, quick.

319
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,160
It's dark, it's dark.

320
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,800
- He's going to collapse.
- Come here.

321
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,120
- lt looks like his heart.
- Not heart, shock of some sort...

322
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,480
brought about by exhaustion.

323
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,920
Take him to his room,
I'll take care of him.

324
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,960
I'm sorry...

325
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,400
I suppose I made quite
an exhibition of myself.

326
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,680
Who brought me here, you?

327
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,720
Rather a mess,
going to pieces in surgery.

328
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,360
Who are you?

329
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,040
I remember now,
Edwardes is dead...

330
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,440
I killed him, took his place.
I'm someone else, I don't know who.

331
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,240
I killed him, Edwardes.

332
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,920
I've no memory, it's like looking in
a mirror and just seeing the mirror.

333
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,120
And yet the image is there,
I know it's there.

334
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,640
I exist, I'm there.

335
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,400
How can a man lose his memory
and name, and still talk like this?

336
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,600
As if he were quite sane.

337
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,520
- Are you afraid of me?
- No.

338
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,160
You're ill, loss of memory
is not a difficult problem.

339
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,040
Yes, I know. Amnesia...

340
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,440
a trick of the mind
for remaining sane.

341
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,400
You remain sane by forgetting
something too horrible to remember.

342
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
You put the horrible thing
behind a closed door.

343
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,560
- We have to open that door.
- I know what's behind it...

344
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,080
- Murder.
- No...

345
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,480
that's a delusion you've acquired
out of illness...

346
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,920
Will you answer me truthfully
and trust me?

347
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,880
I trust you but I can't
think, I don't know who I am.

348
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,200
I don't know, I don't know.

349
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Who telephoned you yesterday?

350
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,680
- Telephoned me?
- Yes, in the office.

351
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,920
Yes, I remember.

352
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,720
What did she say?

353
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,840
She said she was
my office assistant...

354
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,360
She was worried about me,
hadn't heard...

355
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,240
So she was Dr. Edwardes
assistant and hadn't heard from him.

356
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,720
What else did she say?

357
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,960
That she didn't recognise my voice,
that I wasn't Dr. Edwardes.

358
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,760
- So you hung up in anger?
- I was confused...

359
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,160
- my head ached.
- Was that your first doubt?

360
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,240
- First doubt?
- The first time you became confused?

361
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,720
Did anything else
happen before that?

362
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,440
Yes, when I was in the hotel,
packing to come here...

363
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,160
I found a cigarette case in my coat.

364
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,720
It frightened me,
I didn't know why. Here.

365
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,440
The initials J.B., see them?
When I saw them in the hotel room...

366
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,360
they made my head ache.

367
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,080
They're probably your initials.

368
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,240
J.B. J.B.

369
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,400
You must sleep, when you wake up
you'll be able to tell me more.

370
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,320
- lf you trust me.
- I trust you.

371
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,760
It's late, you better get some sleep.
I'll be all right.

372
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,880
I'm sure there will be no police
enquiry for a few days...

373
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,760
We'll talk and straighten
things up before anything happens.

374
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,360
I'll come in the morning and
report you too ill for service.

375
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,640
I have been in Dr. Edwardes
office for 5 years...

376
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,560
and the man who spoke to me
is not Dr. Edwardes.

377
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,240
He let me have my vacation
when he left on his...

378
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,600
I was very worried when I didn't
hear from him last week.

379
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,720
Then I thought he might've just come
here without reopening his office...

380
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,440
- That's why I telephoned.
- Show them the picture.

381
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,880
- That's a different man.
- He was taking a chance.

382
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,240
Somebody might've known
what Edwardes looked like.

383
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,880
- You never saw the real Edwardes?
- No, I never met him.

384
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,080
But I felt something was wrong
from the moment our man appeared.

385
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,240
He didn't impress me
as a scientist...

386
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,160
and last night when he collapsed,
I became actually alarmed.

387
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,720
What do you think made him
break down last night?

388
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,200
It's obvious now, Garmes.

389
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,240
Our impostor, I'm almost certain,
is an amnesia case.

390
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,240
Garmes brought him back to reality
for an instant...

391
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,120
Being unable to face the truth,
he collapsed.

392
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,360
- Do you think he killed Edwardes?
- There's no question of it...

393
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,160
He killed Edwardes and took his place
in order to conceal his crime...

394
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,760
by pretending the victim
was still alive.

395
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,520
This sort of act is typical
of the short sighted cunning...

396
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,720
that goes with paranoid behaviour.

397
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,840
We're wasting time,
his room is upstairs.

398
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,440
This is Dr. Petersen.

399
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,520
- These gentlemen are from the police.
- The police?

400
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,920
- What has happened?
- Nothing to be alarmed about.

401
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,920
Our Dr. Edwardes
is a paranoid impostor.

402
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,800
And is very likely guilty of having
murdered Edwardes...

403
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,560
he's disappeared.

404
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,280
He is not in his room?

405
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,440
- You left him in his room?
- Yes.

406
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,080
Did he say anything? About himself,
about why he broke down?

407
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,720
No, he wasn't himself, he was
unable to speak coherently.

408
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,000
You don't seem surprised to hear that
he's a fake and maybe a murderer.

409
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,200
I'm used to surprises
in my work.

410
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,480
You suspected something?

411
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,320
No. I thought his collapse
due to mental strain.

412
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,480
That's a funny diagnosis for a fellow
who's just come from vacation.

413
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,520
I made no diagnosis, I was shocked
he collapsed. I didn't think.

414
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,720
We're all pretty shocked, Sheriff,
the fellow took us all in...

415
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,600
all except Dr. Mercheson.

416
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,040
And he didn't say anything to
give you an idea where he went?

417
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,520
No.

418
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,680
He may be hanging around, we'll have
to go over the grounds first.

419
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm sorry this has happened
to you, Constance...

420
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,920
I felt like warning you about him
but I wasn't certain.

421
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,480
Don't worry, it's not your fault.
They're bound to find him.

422
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,880
I'll keep you informed
of the police activities.

423
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,880
The fellow expected to get away
with it, like any criminal.

424
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,400
Nonsense, obviously an amnesia case,
he didn't know who he was...

425
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,520
or what he was doing.
What do you say, Constance?

426
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,200
I don't know.

427
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,600
If you were anyone but Constance
Petersen, the human glaciar...

428
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,800
- and custodian of truth, I'd say...
- You'd say what?

429
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,360
My dear, forgive me my thoughts,
you are telling the truth...

430
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,720
I was going to say that you were
holding something back.

431
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,040
I'm a sentimental ass...

432
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,520
A woman like you couldn't get
involved emotionally with any man...

433
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,120
- sane or insane.
- I suggest you change the subject.

434
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,200
I will be interested to ask him
certain questions...

435
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,200
when they bring him
back here.

436
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,120
- You'll never ask him any questions.
- Why not?

437
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,120
For the simple reason the police
will never find him alive...

438
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,800
An amnesia case, with the police
after it, is an obvious suicide.

439
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,200
He'll put an end to his pain
and nightmares...

440
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,520
by blowing his brains out,
or dropping himself out of a window.

441
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,320
You're offending Dr. Petersen
with your callousness.

442
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,480
I'm sorry, Constance, that some still
have the manners of medical students.

443
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,560
I'm not offended. I think
Dr. Floreau's ideas are accurate.

444
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,160
But I'm rather tired.
Goodnight.

445
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,080
The police have announced
that our neighbourhood...

446
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,760
is free of the dangerous madman
who escaped from Green Manors...

447
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,640
The search for the impostor
has shifted to Manhattan...

448
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,480
This is WQZK, Rutland,
George Bell.

449
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,520
We now resume
our scheduled program.

450
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,720
Sure feels good to take
the weight off your feet.

451
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,320
I'm from Pittsburgh.
There's a town for you.

452
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,520
You really can meet people
in Pittsburgh...

453
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,080
friendly, a fellow could live and die
in this town and never meet nobody.

454
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,320
How about you and me having a drink
together, now we're aquainted?

455
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,640
No, thank you.

456
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,120
You don't have to be
so snooty about it.

457
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,240
I'll have you know, I know better
people than you in Pittsburgh.

458
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,440
I'm sure you're a great social
success, given half a chance.

459
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,480
Now you're talking.

460
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,600
Do you mind not sitting
in my lap in public?

461
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,200
That's enough of that.

462
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,400
- Beat it.
- I'm a guest in this hotel.

463
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,360
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm the house detective. Get going.

464
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,240
This town's getting
worse and worse.

465
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,240
It's all right,
you don't have to go.

466
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,480
I'm sorry you were being annoyed.
I've been watching you...

467
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,560
and I figured something
like this might happen.

468
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,640
The chief duty of a house detective
is to spot trouble in advance.

469
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,560
- You're not registered here, are you?
- No.

470
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,360
I didn't think so, the way you were
wandering around.

471
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,440
Looking for somebody?
Don't be afraid of me...

472
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,280
I've got you spotted as a lady
in trouble, from out of town.

473
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,280
Schoolteacher, or librarian,
which is it?

474
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,120
- Schoolteacher.
- I thought so...

475
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,680
they always look like they lost
something. Maybe I can help you.

476
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,440
- I don't think so, thank you.
- Looking for some man, I suppose...

477
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,240
must be a relative.

478
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,000
And from the worried look,
I'd say a close one.

479
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,920
A husband, for instance.

480
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,600
- I'm really amazed.
- I hit it?

481
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,600
- But how could you tell?
- I'm a kind of psychologist.

482
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,000
You've got to be in my line.

483
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,000
Now, would you mind filling in
a few of the blank spaces for me?

484
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,760
- No, it's just that we quarrelled.
- And then you got sorry...

485
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,800
and you came running after him?
That's the usual psychology.

486
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,120
- But now you're afraid to face him?
- No, no...

487
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,120
It's that I don't know
what room he's in...

488
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,000
He told a friend he was coming here,
but under a different name...

489
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,040
so I couldn't find him.
But I must find him and apologise.

490
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,440
When did he arrive here?

491
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,880
- Yesterday morning.
- Give me a description of him.

492
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,840
He's very tall and attractive...

493
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,840
dark hair, rather rugged face...

494
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,520
- brown eyes, and one suitcase.
- I'll go check on him.

495
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,520
- Did you find him?
- I think we got a line.

496
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,760
About 25 guys answering your
description came yesterday...

497
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,360
These are their registration cards.
You might recognise the handwriting.

498
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,120
That's very clever of you.

499
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,360
- This is his handwriting.
- John Brown?

500
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,880
Not much imagination
for an alias. Room 3033.

501
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,560
Thank you, I was going to stay
all day watching for him.

502
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,920
I knew you would, glad to be
of service. I'm married too...

503
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,640
and I know how it feels to have
a wife chase after you to apologise.

504
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,240
Constance.

505
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,840
Take care of you and cure you and
remain with you till that happens.

506
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,600
But you can't help
hide a criminal.

507
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,800
You can't jeopardise your standing as
a doctor, you're just starting out...

508
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,760
- I won't let you be stupid about it.
- I couldn't bear it away from you.

509
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,200
I went through yesterday holding my
breath as if I were being hunted...

510
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,280
I couldn't eat, work,
do anything but think of you.

511
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,600
So I had to come.

512
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,480
I'll get a room on this floor,
I'm here as your doctor only...

513
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,520
It has nothing
to do with love.

514
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,280
Nothing at all,
nothing at all.

515
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,360
Try remembering, let your mind
go back to your childhood.

516
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Was it happy?
Whom did you know?

517
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,800
I'm haunted,
but I can't see by what.

518
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,040
- lt's no use.
- You lived somewhere...

519
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,000
you had a mother, you were loved,
had friends.

520
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,760
Yes, and probably a wife.

521
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,320
Can you remember her?

522
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,760
I didn't say I had one.
I said I probably had.

523
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,480
No, darling. Thank heaven
I can't remember a wife.

524
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,920
- I'd like to ask a medical question.
- Constance...

525
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,840
would you mind not prodding me,
it mixes me up...

526
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,880
I can't remember anything.
Except that I love you.

527
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,560
How would you diagnose a pain,
in the right upper quadrant...

528
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,800
a pain that is persistant?

529
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,400
Gall bladder, a heart case,
or pneumonia...

530
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,680
depending
on the patient's history.

531
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,640
It's obvious you're a doctor.

532
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,280
Yes, the eminent Dr. X.

533
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,280
If we can unlock one tiny memory,
it'll give us the key to the others.

534
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,600
The only thing that comes to mind
that I keep thinking...

535
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,680
- is the logic of the situation.
- What logic?

536
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,200
That I was with Edwardes.

537
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,600
Police believe the impostor who
escaped from Green Manors...

538
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,480
to be the patient that visited
the real Dr. Edwardes...

539
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,040
in the Cumberland mountains
the day that he disappeared.

540
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,520
No trace has been found, since
he left the Cumberland resort...

541
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,960
"in the company of his
supposed patient""."

542
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,600
Do you remember that? Why do you
believe you were with him?

543
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,240
Because wherever we went,
I came back with his identity...

544
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,080
I wouldn't have come back as Edwardes
if I hadn't known he was dead.

545
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,240
How would I know that, if I hadn't
been with him when he died?

546
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,200
- Were you?
- I don't remember...

547
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,080
but logically
I know that I must've been.

548
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,120
And logically, I also know why
the body hasn't been found...

549
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,240
because it was hidden
by me.

550
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,800
Don't you see that you're
imagining all this?

551
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,720
You call yourself names, insist
without proof that you're a murderer.

552
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,280
You know what that is, don't you?
A guilt complex that speaks for you.

553
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,200
A guilt fantasy that goes way back
to your childhood.

554
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,800
I think you're quite mad.
You're much crazier than I...

555
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,400
to do all this for a creature
without a name.

556
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,760
To run off with a pair of initials.

557
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,960
The police have not given your name
or case history to the papers...

558
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,560
That must mean that your name was
not in Dr. Edwardes' files...

559
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,120
You were in an accident.

560
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,920
Where was it?

561
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,320
What happened to your hand?
It was burned.

562
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,320
You had an operation
in the last 6 months.

563
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,320
A skin graft, 3rd degree burns.
Your hand was burned. Where?

564
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,000
- lt hurts.
- Try remembering.

565
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,560
- My hand hurts.
- Your hand is remembering...

566
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,760
open your mind
and the pain will leave.

567
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,640
- Where did it happen?
- I can't it hurts.

568
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,520
- What happened?
- My hand's burning.

569
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,360
Try to remember.

570
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,640
- My dear are you all right?
- I'm all right. What happened?

571
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,520
You re-lived an accident
you'd been in...

572
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,360
But the memory only touched
the part of your mind that feels...

573
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It's beginning, it really is.
You'll feel better soon.

574
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,480
- Who could that be?
- I know.

575
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,040
I sent down for
the latest editions of the papers.

576
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,560
You ordered the afternoon papers?
They just came, I brought them up.

577
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,120
Just a minute.

578
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,640
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

579
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,120
He recognised me in the paper.
We've got to go, we can't pack.

580
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,400
Listen, when you left the mountains
you must've passed through New York.

581
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,360
Wherever you went, you must've been
in the railroad station...

582
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,200
you must've heard Edwardes
ask for tickets to somewhere.

583
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,840
- I don't remember.
- You will...

584
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,800
when you come to the ticket window,
try to re-live the other time...

585
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,680
try to repeat what was said.
Ask for the same tickets.

586
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,720
I'll try.

587
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,120
Philedelphia, 6.39.
Thank you.

588
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,640
You went someplace with Edwardes,
ask for tickets to that place.

589
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,520
8.46, thank you.

590
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,720
What is it?

591
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,920
What do you want, sir?

592
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,040
Please step aside.

593
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,160
- I want 2 tickets.
- Where to?

594
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,880
Rome.

595
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,400
- Rome.
- To where?

596
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,600
Rome.

597
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,080
What Rome?

598
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,120
He means Rome, Georgia.

599
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,240
- Anything wrong?
- My husband's ill, we're going home.

600
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,200
Here you are, 2 tickets
to Rome, Georgia.

601
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,800
He'll be all right in a minute.
These dizzy spells go away.

602
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,480
He looks pretty sick,
I'll call a doctor.

603
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,720
No, he'll be all right.
Do you feel better now, darling?

604
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,120
Pull yourself together.
You're all right.

605
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,040
- When does the train leave?
- Birmingham special...

606
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,280
in 10 minutes, track 17.

607
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,280
- I got confused.
- Thank you.

608
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,440
I'll take you to the train
in case anything happens.

609
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,640
He's recovered now. You're very nice
to offer help, but I can get along.

610
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,440
Act as if we're taking this train.
We'll walk down and turn back.

611
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,840
- What's the matter with this train?
- The policeman heard us buy tickets.

612
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,480
- Did he act suspicious?
- No...

613
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,480
but if he goes to the police station,
he may find descriptions of us...

614
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,960
remember us, and telephone Rome,
Georgia to have us picked up.

615
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,120
We can't go back to the hotel.
They'll have a million police there.

616
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,760
We're not going back,
we're going to Rochester...

617
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,480
Come on, we'll go to
Grand Central Station.

618
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,200
By the way, what are we
going to Rochester for?

619
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,800
- We're going to visit Dr. Brulov.
- The one who doesn't like ketchup.

620
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,200
He was my analyst,
he psychoanalysed me.

621
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,520
- Really? What was wrong with you?
- All analysts have to be analysed...

622
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,040
by other analysts before
they start practicing.

623
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,400
That's to make sure
they're not too crazy.

624
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,320
Apparently the mind is never too ill
to make jokes about psychoanalysis.

625
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,280
- I'm sorry. I'm a pig.
- I keep forgetting you're a patient.

626
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,960
So do I. When I hold you
like this I feel well.

627
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,200
Will you love me as much
when I'm normal?

628
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,400
- I'll be insane about you.
- I am normal.

629
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,760
At least there's nothing wrong with
me that a long kiss wouldn't cure.

630
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,400
I've never treated a guilt complex
like that before.

631
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,800
- We don't want to attract attention.
- Everybody's doing it.

632
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,320
- You both going?
- Yes, yes.

633
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,720
Don't read the paper.
Let's pick up where we left off.

634
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,880
What?

635
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,680
Try to recall the first moment
you thought you were Edwardes.

636
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,160
- Darling, I've a confession to make.
- I'm listening.

637
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,480
As a doctor, you irritate me.

638
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,000
I'm here, swooning with love.
You ask me a question...

639
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,560
and I don't like you anymore.
Do you have to sit there smiling...

640
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,640
like some know-it-all
schoolteacher?

641
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,440
I can't help it, that's
what happens in analysis...

642
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,120
As the doctor begins to uncover
the truth...

643
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,680
the patient develops a fine hearty
hatred of the doctor.

644
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,600
You're going to hate me a great
deal before we're through.

645
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,440
- And you're going to like that?
- As a scientist, yes.

646
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,200
And if I biff you one, you'll
consider it a sort of diploma?

647
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,600
- Yes, but don't biff too hard.
- No...

648
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,720
I think we should go on
with our investigation.

649
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,840
- We have some new facts now.
- What facts?

650
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,080
You're a doctor, you were in an
accident, your hand was burned...

651
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,480
- and you were in Rome.
- I was never in Rome in my life.

652
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,960
You were either there,
or going there.

653
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,880
You remembered something no doubt
connected with burning your hand.

654
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,360
Rome, think of Rome.
Maybe Rome, ltaly.

655
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,800
When did you go to Rome?
What did you do in Rome?

656
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,880
Think.

657
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,320
Think.

658
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,880
Rome...

659
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,680
I remember something.

660
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,560
- Fighter planes spotted us.
- You were flying?

661
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,040
Transport. Medical core.
Over Rome, heading north.

662
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,000
- What happened?
- They hit us.

663
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,160
Caught fire, uniform burned,
bailed out.

664
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,840
What else?

665
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,880
I don't know. It blacks out.

666
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,520
- You left the army?
- Yes.

667
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,000
I probably deserted, I hated it.

668
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,080
I hated killing, I can remember
that much.

669
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,360
Your guilt complex was obviously
inflamed by being a soldier.

670
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,640
Stop it, babbling like some
phoney King Solomon...

671
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,920
half-witted devil talk
that doesn't make sense...

672
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,240
if there's anything I hate
it's a smug woman.

673
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,200
Darling, we're just beginning.
Don't biff too hard yet.

674
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,920
I worked as Dr. Brulov's assistant
for a year after my internship...

675
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,920
He got me the post at Green Manors.
You'll like Alex.

676
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,440
I doubt that. One psychoanalyst
in my hair is enough.

677
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,120
- What are you going to tell him?
- That we're on our honeymoon.

678
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,560
Doctor, you think of the most
wonderful prescriptions.

679
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,760
- Good evening, is Dr. Brulov in?
- No, he went out after dinner.

680
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,960
He ought to be back soon.

681
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,760
Would you tell him his
supper is on the table...

682
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,760
I'm sorry, I can't wait any longer.

683
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,800
And there are 2 men
waiting for him in there.

684
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,080
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

685
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,760
- How's your mother been lately?
- Still complaining about rheumatism.

686
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,480
She figures I ought to get
transferred down to Florida.

687
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,920
"I said, ""Do expect me to sacrifice
all chance of promotion..."

688
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,040
"just because you got rheumatism?"""

689
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,120
Did you take the subject
up with the head?

690
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,840
Yeah, he said a transfer
could be arranged, but...

691
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,680
I'd have to start over as a
sergeant. I think that's unfair...

692
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,200
after all the work I did
on that narcotics case.

693
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,240
- What did he say to that?
- A lot of things...

694
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,080
he made some crack about
me being a mama's boy...

695
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,320
Pardon me, that may be for me
I gave headquarters this number.

696
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,120
Hello.
Yes, Lieutenant Cooley.

697
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,840
Any new developments?

698
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,760
When did you find that out?

699
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,120
No, right,
I'll be down later. Goodbye.

700
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,560
Deiter, what is this kind
of persecution?

701
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,880
I told the police yesterday,
I know nothing about Edwardes.

702
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,320
But yesterday you had some kind
of theory...

703
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,800
I explained to the policeman
that if Edwardes...

704
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,240
took on vacation
a paranoid patient...

705
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,520
he was a bigger fool than
I ever knew he was.

706
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,480
It is the same as playing
with a loaded gun.

707
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,640
Do you think this patient
might've killed him?

708
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,200
I'm not thinking anything,
I'm not a bloodhound.

709
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,040
Was Dr. Edwardes
a great friend?

710
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,200
What are you talking about?
The man was impossible.

711
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,200
You had a quarrel with him,
when you were in New York?

712
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,640
Not New York, in Boston
at the Psychiatry Convention...

713
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,400
What kind of analyst wants to cure
psychosis by taking people skating?

714
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,880
Or to a bowling alley?

715
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,440
I understand you threatened
to punch his nose.

716
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,680
All I did was get up and walk out,
and kick over a few chairs...

717
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:06,320
which nobody was sitting in.
So don't ask me any more questions...

718
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,960
- You have now the facts.
- Thank you very much.

719
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,840
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

720
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,640
If anything turns up,
we'll let you know.

721
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,720
Good bye ma'am.
Good night, sir.

722
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,960
What do you suppose they're
snooping around for?

723
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,080
Next they'll give me
the third degree.

724
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,720
Alex, I was going to write,
but it happened so quickly...

725
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,720
- I got married.
- Who is married?

726
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,760
- Alex, my husband, John Brown.
- I'm glad to meet you officially.

727
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,680
You are married? There is nothing
so nice as a new marriage...

728
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,000
no psychosis yet, no aggression,
no guilt complexes...

729
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:58,040
I congratulate you, and wish
you have babies and not ogres...

730
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,840
How about we have a glass of beer,
like in the old days?

731
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,720
The truth is, we have no hotel room.
All the hotels were so crowded.

732
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,680
What do you want with a hotel? That's
for millionaires, not lovebirds.

733
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,680
You'll stay right here. Look how I'm
living by myself with a can opener.

734
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:21,360
My housekeeper has gone to work,
my secretary is a wreck...

735
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,840
and I've got a cleaning woman
who can't cook and hates me...

736
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,680
Cook me my coffee in the morning
and the house is yours.

737
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,280
- That's wonderful of you.
- There's nothing wonderful about me.

738
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:38,240
It's nice to see my old assistant.
The youngest but the best I ever had.

739
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,440
But who knows now? As my old friend
Sanabaum used to say...

740
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:50,200
Women make the best psychoanalysts,
until they fall in love...

741
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,080
"after that, they make
the best patients."""

742
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,040
Good night and happy dreams...

743
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:04,240
- Which we will analyse at breakfast.
- Goodnight and thanks for everything.

744
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,520
Any husband of Constance
is a husband of mine.

745
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,640
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

746
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,480
- He was so pert with the police.
- Wasn't he?

747
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,800
He carried it off like an expert.

748
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,040
I felt stupid for a few
minutes, but it turned out well.

749
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,480
Providing the professor
isn't wiser than he seems.

750
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,800
Alex, no. Things are different here
since my time.

751
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,080
Alex didn't think anything,
he's sweet.

752
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,440
Maybe, but he didn't even
ask us where our bags were.

753
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,480
He's always like that, in a
complete dream state socially.

754
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,960
You know, this room does
look changed, but it isn't...

755
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,880
It's I who am changed.
It's called transfer of affects.

756
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,120
What is?

757
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,840
The fact that everything seems
so wonderful in this room.

758
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,040
- That's what it's called, is it?
- Did the police disturb you?

759
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,920
No, one ignores such trifles
on a honeymoon.

760
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,080
I take it this is your
first honeymoon.

761
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,080
Yes, I mean,
it would be if it were.

762
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:41,280
For what it's worth, I can't remember
ever having kissed any other woman.

763
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,840
I have nothing to remember
of that nature either.

764
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,760
You're very sweet.

765
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,560
- Of course, I'm no child.
- Far from it.

766
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,600
I'm well aware that we're all
bundles of inhibitions.

767
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,240
Dynamite.

768
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,960
- Please don't do that.
- Why?

769
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,280
It isn't ethical,
I'm here as your doctor.

770
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,480
Well, you can stop worrying doctor,
I'm going to sleep on the couch.

771
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,200
No, that's also unethical.

772
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,280
This honeymoon is complicated enough,
without you dragging ethics into it...

773
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,840
I suppose the floor is out.

774
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,560
The patient always sleeps in the bed,
the doctor occupies the couch...

775
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,800
- fully dressed.
- I see you know the rules.

776
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,880
- You remember something.
- No.

777
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,680
- This room reminds you of something.
- No.

778
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,400
You're resisting a memory,
what is in your mind?

779
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,080
- I don't know.
- Yes you do, you're resisting it.

780
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,280
Don't start that again. Don't stand
there with that wise look...

781
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,680
- I'm sick of your double talk.
- You're looking at the bed.

782
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,320
What frightens you?
White, lines...

783
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,240
When I made fork marks
on a tablecloth it agitated you...

784
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,240
and that night you kissed me, you
pushed me away because of my robe...

785
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,720
it was white, with dark lines.
Try to think...

786
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,040
Why does white frighten you?
Why do lines frighten you?

787
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,520
- Think of white.
- lt frightens me, I can't look.

788
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,440
Don't run away, stand still.
Look, remember.

789
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,320
Darling.

790
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,320
Oh darling,
you mustn't be frightened...

791
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,400
You mustn't,
we're making progress.

792
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,840
We have the word white
on our side.

793
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,760
Is that you, Mr. Brown?

794
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,200
I thought it was you.

795
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,960
I was unable to sleep,
so I came down to work.

796
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,560
When you're old, you don't
need to sleep so much.

797
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,800
I'm having a glass of milk and
some crackers, join me please...

798
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,080
I'll get another glass.
I'm glad to have company.

799
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:27,080
Nobody likes to have crackers
and milk by himself.

800
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,760
When I was a young man,
I was always saying...

801
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:38,640
If I could only get alone, instead
of wasting time with people...

802
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,320
"I would be happy."""

803
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,960
Now I am saying
just the opposite.

804
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:50,240
This is the secret of old age,
everything becomes just the opposite.

805
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,160
Do you know who makes the most
trouble in the world? Old people.

806
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:59,680
They are always worrying what
will be in the world tomorrow...

807
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,880
after they are gone.

808
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,720
That's why we have wars.

809
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:09,720
Because old people have nothing else
they can get excited about.

810
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,200
Well, we'll drink to you...

811
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:21,240
to when we're young, and know
nothing except living.

812
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,600
Alex, Alex
are you all right?

813
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,960
Good morning. Yes I am all right.
Thank you.

814
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,320
- I fell asleep in the chair.
- Yes.

815
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,320
- What time is it?
- Seven o'clock.

816
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:20,720
I was dreaming. This morning
I get some real coffee.

817
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,920
My husband must've gone out
very early, you didn't...

818
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,200
He didn't go out.
He's over there on the couch.

819
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,800
He's all right,
he's sleeping fine.

820
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:39,400
My dear child, do you think
old Alex Brulov...

821
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,480
one of the biggest brains
in psychiatry...

822
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,120
is unable to make 2 and 2
come out 4?

823
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,400
I should've known.

824
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:54,840
The moment I see you with a husband,
whose pupils are enlarged...

825
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,560
who has a tremor of the left hand,
who is on honeymoon with no bags...

826
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:04,840
and whose name is John Brown.
I know practically what is going on.

827
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,920
- What happened?
- Only what I expected.

828
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:15,560
There is no use taking chances
with a possibly dangerous case.

829
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,000
I sit here waiting,
if you scream, I'm ready...

830
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:26,560
So, he comes downstairs and he's
dangerous, I can see by his face.

831
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,760
So I keep talking, while I put some
bromide into a glass of milk...

832
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,760
enough to knock out 3 horses.

833
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:41,680
When he falls down, I run up to see
you, you're sleeping like a baby...

834
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,280
and I come back
here to watch out.

835
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,240
The struggle against his condition
agitates him at times...

836
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,200
but there's no danger in him.

837
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,160
This is what I found
in his hand last night.

838
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,400
He didn't know he had that.
You mustn't think that.

839
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,360
He didn't try to hurt you,
he couldn't.

840
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,200
- My child he is not responsible.
- That's not correct.

841
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:12,400
I'm just a little more experienced
with his type than you.

842
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,120
I grant you know more
than me, but...

843
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:19,840
Do not complete this sentence with
the usual female contradictions.

844
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:24,000
You grant I know more than you,
but you know more than me?

845
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,560
Women's talk!

846
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,640
- What are you going to do?
- Something more for you than me...

847
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,400
- I'm calling the police.
- No, please...

848
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,400
You are giving me orders?
My pupil?

849
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,520
You don't know this man,
you know only science...

850
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,560
you know his mind,
but not his heart.

851
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:43,280
We are speaking of a schizophrenic,
and not a valentine.

852
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,080
We're speaking of a man.

853
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,120
Love.

854
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,680
Look at you, Dr. Petersen,
the promising psychoanalyst...

855
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:04,280
is now all of a sudden a schoolgirl
in love with an actor, nothing else.

856
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,640
- Alex, let me tell you about him.
- What is there for you to say?

857
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,520
We both know that the mind
of a woman in love...

858
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,960
is operating on the lowest level
of the intellect.

859
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,960
Doctor told me not to smoke in the
morning, but I'm too excited.

860
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,000
You're right. I'm not an analyst,
I'm not even a doctor here...

861
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,160
I'm not talking to you as one.

862
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,320
Believe not what I say,
but what I feel.

863
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,040
The mind isn't everything, the heart
can see deeper sometimes.

864
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,680
A police investigation
might ruin his chance of recovery...

865
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,080
I can save him.

866
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,880
But if he killed Dr. Edwardes,
how can you help?

867
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,640
He didn't, he didn't.

868
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,560
But if it turns out he did,
which I'm certain it will...

869
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:52,600
It won't. You told me what Freud said.
A man can't do anything in amnesia...

870
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,200
that his real character
wouldn't have done.

871
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:57,080
And how do you know
what his real character is?

872
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,320
- I know, I know.
- She knows...

873
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,920
This is the way science
goes backward...

874
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,240
Who told you what he is?
Freud? Or a crystal ball?

875
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,720
I couldn't feel this way toward
a man who was bad...

876
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,760
or who had committed murder.

877
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,440
I couldn't feel this pain
for someone who was evil.

878
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,040
You are 20 times
crazier than him.

879
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,000
She couldn't love him
if he was no good.

880
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,320
This is baby talk, nothing else.
What do you want I should do?

881
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,720
Give me time to treat and cure him,
before the police find him...

882
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,920
and shock him into
an incurable condition.

883
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,480
- This could take a year.
- No, no.

884
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,880
Half a year? We should sit
and hide for half a year?

885
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:52,920
Waiting to find out if he'll cut
your throat, my throat...

886
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,560
and set fire to the house.
My dear girl...

887
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:01,880
even to a woman in love,
it must seem a little unreasonable.

888
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,880
Just a few more days,
before you turn him over...

889
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,040
a few more days, and then
if I can't do anything...

890
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,080
if we both can't, then you
can call the police.

891
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,240
You're not hiding a criminal.
There's no evidence...

892
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,240
except his own guilt fantasies.
He's just a possible witness...

893
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,280
to what happened to Edwardes.

894
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,960
In his condition, he could
tell the police nothing.

895
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,600
You're doing nothing
against the law, we're helping...

896
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,480
by investigating him as doctors...

897
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,720
Doctors who want the truth
even more than they do.

898
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:43,040
- All right.
- You'll wait?

899
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,680
Go make me coffee. I'll pretend
I'm acting sensible for a few days.

900
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,120
Thank you, thank you very much.

901
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,880
I'll make you coffee,
with an egg in it.

902
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,960
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Brulov.

903
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,280
Brulov? That's right.

904
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:55,360
- Who's been feeding me bromide?
- I gave you, to sleep.

905
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,400
Brulov.

906
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,680
Oh, yes, Rochester.

907
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:10,240
- What's your name?
- I don't know.

908
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,920
- Constance told you.
- Nobody told me...

909
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:22,040
if I don't know an amnesia case
when I see one, what do I know?

910
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,440
You don't remember
your father or mother?

911
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,160
- Wife, or sweetheart?
- No.

912
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,320
Don't fight me, I'm going
to help you if I can.

913
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,160
I'm going to be your father image.
You must look on me as your father.

914
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:43,760
Trust me, lean on me. It's a
short cut, but we haven't much time.

915
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,600
All right, go ahead, I'm leaning.

916
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,880
Maybe you've got something
to tell me...

917
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,080
a single thought, a few words
in the corner of your head?

918
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:57,080
Go on, talk to me, whatever comes
in your head, just say.

919
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,760
- There's nothing.
- Maybe you dreamt something?

920
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:07,360
- Yes.
- What did you dream?

921
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,240
I don't believe in dreams,
that Freud stuff's a lot of hooey.

922
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,600
You're a fine one to talk.

923
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,080
You've got amnesia,
and a guilt complex...

924
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,920
you don't know if
you're coming or going...

925
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,400
but Freud is hooey,
this you know.

926
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,480
Wise guy.

927
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:38,240
- You don't like me, Papa.
- You want I should help you, or not?

928
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,040
I'm sorry.

929
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,360
I'll explain to you about dreams
so you don't think it is hooey.

930
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,000
The secret of who you are and
what has made you run away...

931
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:57,360
all these secrets are
buried in your brain...

932
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,920
but you don't want
to look at them.

933
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:03,280
The human being often doesn't want
to know the truth about himself...

934
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,960
because he thinks
it'll make him sick.

935
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:11,200
So he makes himself sicker,
trying to forget. You follow this?

936
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,080
- How do you feel?
- Coffee.

937
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,600
Awful.

938
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,640
The patient is going to tell us
what he dreamt.

939
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,880
Fine, I'll take notes,
I'll get my glasses.

940
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,160
Now, here's where dreams
come in.

941
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,760
They tell you what
you're trying to hide.

942
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:39,160
But they tell it to you all mixed up
like pieces of a puzzle.

943
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:44,240
The problem of the analyst is
to examine this puzzle...

944
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:47,280
and put the pieces
in the right places...

945
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,480
and find out what the devil
you're trying to say to yourself.

946
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:01,040
Let's see. I kept thinking while
dreaming that it all meant something.

947
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,640
There was some other meaning in it
that I ought to find out.

948
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,360
We'll find out.

949
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:16,040
I can't make out just what
sort of a place it was...

950
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,400
it seemed to be
a gambling house.

951
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,960
But there weren't any walls, just
curtains with eyes painted on them...

952
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:38,480
a man was walking around with a pair
of scissors, cutting them in half...

953
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:48,760
and then a girl came with hardly a
thing on and started kissing everyone.

954
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,360
She came to my table first.

955
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,920
Did you recognise
this kissing bug?

956
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:59,440
I'm afraid she looked a little
like Constance.

957
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,200
This is plain, ordinary,
wishful dreaming. Go on.

958
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,480
I was sitting there, playing cards,
with a man who had a beard...

959
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,960
I was dealing to him,
I turned up the 7 of clubs.

960
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:21,000
"He said, ""That makes 21, I win"".
But when he turned up his cards..."

961
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:24,520
they were blank. Then the proprietor
came and accused him of cheating...

962
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,280
"He yelled, ""This is my place..."

963
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,720
"if I catch you cheating,
I'll fix you."""

964
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,040
I'm sorry about
that kissing bug.

965
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,600
I'm glad you didn't dream of me
as an egg beater as one patient did.

966
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,120
- Why what would that mean?
- Never mind.

967
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,200
Does it make any sense to you,
what I dream?

968
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,440
Not yet. You're trying to tell
yourself something...

969
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,640
what it is,
we'll figure out later.

970
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:53,680
- There's a lot more to it.
- Go on, try to recall the details...

971
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,160
the more cockeyed, the better
for the scientific side of it.

972
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:05,760
Leaning over the sloping roof of a
high building was a man with a beard.

973
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:11,200
I yelled at him to watch out. Then
he fell, slowly, his feet in the air.

974
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:15,560
Then I saw the proprietor again,
the man in the mask...

975
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:20,200
he was hiding behind a tall chimney
and he had a small wheel in his hand.

976
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,200
I saw him drop
the wheel on the roof.

977
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,320
Suddenly I was running, then I heard
something beating over my head...

978
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,080
it was a great pair of wings...

979
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,480
they chased and almost caught me,
and I came to the bottom of the hill.

980
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,320
I must've escaped,
I don't remember.

981
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,160
That's all there was,
I woke up and saw Dr. Brulov.

982
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,120
- Have some coffee.
- Thanks.

983
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,480
- Something's happening.
- What is it?

984
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,280
- Snow.
- The light frightened him...

985
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,920
photophobia.

986
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,520
No, it was the snow.

987
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,200
That's the white he's afraid of,
snow and those tracks.

988
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,600
- What tracks?
- The sled tracks in the snow.

989
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,680
His first sympton was shock at the
sight of fork lines on a white cloth.

990
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,600
And my robe
had dark lines on it.

991
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:55,920
And last night the white coverlet,
and those tracks in the snow.

992
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,080
- We'll pull the blinds down.
- Dr. Edwardes was fond of sports...

993
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,360
he mentioned tennis and skiing
as valuable...

994
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,640
in the treatment
of mental disorders.

995
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,800
Skiing...

996
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,760
ski tracks in the snow.

997
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:17,280
That's what those dark lines
symbolise for him...

998
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,800
his horror of them means...

999
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,320
they're immediately connected
with the cause of his amnesia.

1000
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,880
Yes, imagine you're on skis.

1001
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,080
Where did Edwardes go skiing?
We must find out.

1002
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,160
Can you tell us where? Try.

1003
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:44,800
He has told us, in his dream.
Let me see your notes.

1004
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,680
What can we do for him?

1005
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,360
You're not his mama
you're an analyst...

1006
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,560
leave him alone he'll come out
of this by himself.

1007
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:00,000
The sloping roof, that means
mountainside.

1008
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:04,280
They were skiing. The father image,
the bearded man is Edwardes...

1009
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,240
That's simple, he plunged over
the precipice while skiing.

1010
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:12,120
And then a shadow chases him
up and down a hill.

1011
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,400
That could mean he was escaping
from a valley.

1012
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,800
Ski resorts are called valleys,
like Sun Valley.

1013
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:23,160
He was being pursued by a
winged figure, a witch or...

1014
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:28,840
No, the figure was you. If you grew
wings, you'd be an angel.

1015
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,480
The dream is trying to tell him
the name of the resort.

1016
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,240
Angel, Angel Valley...

1017
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,480
Do you remember Angel Valley?

1018
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,240
We can call a travel agency and check
all the resort names.

1019
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,600
It wasn't Angel Valley,
I remember it.

1020
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:56,320
- lt was a place called Gabriel Valley.
- What else do you remember?

1021
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,200
Who was the masked figure
in your dream?

1022
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,080
It was an accident, a skiing
accident, remember?

1023
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,680
- Dr. Edwardes went over...
- lt was no accident.

1024
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,880
I can't stand this anymore.
I've had enough.

1025
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,760
We've got to call the police.

1026
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:12,000
No, we have to go to Gabriel Valley,
you have to go with me.

1027
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,640
- This is for Cooley when he comes in.
- I'll tell him.

1028
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,000
At 4.45? Thank you, goodbye.

1029
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:32,400
There's a train leaving in an hour,
we can connect for Gabriel Valley.

1030
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,520
I know what I have to do,
I can't go on endangering you...

1031
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,960
I know about last night.

1032
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,080
- Nothing happened.
- But it will, I've got to end it.

1033
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:46,200
I love you, but I'm not worth loving.
You can help me afterward.

1034
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,040
There's no help afterward...

1035
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,560
If you give yourself up in your
condition, there is no afterward.

1036
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:54,400
- I can cure you.
- But you can't undo a murder.

1037
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,160
- There is none to undo.
- I killed him.

1038
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,400
- Oh, stop.
- And now you, last night I...

1039
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,720
- Don't try to stop me, I have to go.
- Guilt...

1040
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,520
you've lived with it a long time,
haven't you?

1041
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,360
- Yes.
- Since childhood.

1042
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,960
- What?
- Ever since your childhood...

1043
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,920
you've tried to run away
from something.

1044
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:12,040
You always felt guilt for everything.
What was it in your youth?

1045
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,880
It must be terrible if you'd
rather think you murdered him...

1046
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,800
- than remember what happened.
- Enough.

1047
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:22,320
You said you loved me. Look at me,
why am I fighting for you?

1048
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,240
- Because I love you, I need you.
- But I'm nothing.

1049
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,920
- Come with me to Gabriel Valley.
- What good will that do?

1050
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,680
When you see the hill where
it happened, you'll remember.

1051
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,360
We'll go skiing like you did
with Edwardes...

1052
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,920
- I was there, I killed him.
- You'll see what really happened.

1053
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,880
- You mean because it'll happen again.
- Yes.

1054
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,960
And what if I killed him?

1055
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,800
Isn't it true that if
the episode is repeated...

1056
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,560
I'm likely to do the same thing
I did before?

1057
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:56,120
- How do you know I won't kill again?
- Because I know you didn't kill him.

1058
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,240
You believe in me enough
to take such a chance?

1059
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,880
Of course. We're going back
to that ski run.

1060
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,480
We'll find out what in your childhood
has haunted you all your life.

1061
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,240
We'll also find out what happened
to Dr. Edwardes.

1062
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,880
Ever seen her before?

1063
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,680
Let's go.

1064
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:45,760
I've always loved feminine clothes
but never dared to wear them...

1065
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,000
but I'm going to after this, I'll
wear exactly what pleases me...

1066
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,240
and you...

1067
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,200
even very funny hats...

1068
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,440
the kind that make you
look a little drunk.

1069
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,440
Put them on.

1070
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:24,680
It was something in my childhood.
Something in my childhood!

1071
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,040
I remember now.
I killed my brother.

1072
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,680
I didn't kill my brother,
it was an accident.

1073
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:46,600
That's what has haunted you all your
life, the memory you were afraid of.

1074
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,800
It's like looking into
an old picture book...

1075
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,320
seeing familiar pictures
one at a time.

1076
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:16,840
I went to Colombia Medical School,
had a girl with a giggle...

1077
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:21,240
who luckily married my roommate,
Kim. And by the way...

1078
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,760
- My name's John Balentine.
- I'm very pleased to meet you.

1079
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,560
My army record's all right.
I was invalided out.

1080
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,080
I ran into Dr. Edwardes when I was
in the Cumberland Mountains...

1081
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:35,360
trying to recover from some nerve
shock I got when the plane crashed.

1082
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,640
He was on vacation,
but I asked him to help me...

1083
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,480
and he invited me to go skiing.
We went through New York...

1084
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:46,680
and I seem to remember going
to lunch, I'm still a little vague...

1085
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:51,320
We arrived here, and the accident
happened at that spot.

1086
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,120
Where you saved me.

1087
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,400
Let's not have any confusion
about who saved whom...

1088
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:00,520
He went over there, it's still
a little foggy, but...

1089
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:05,000
I do know he was about 50 feet
ahead of me, I saw him plunge...

1090
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,000
that was the thing that set you off,
the start of your guilt complex...

1091
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:11,840
that made you think you'd killed him.
So you had to run away from that too.

1092
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,400
You took on the role of Edwardes, to
prove to yourself he wasn't dead...

1093
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,480
and so therefore
you hadn't killed him.

1094
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:22,560
Professor, I never realised in my
amnesic state, how lovely you are.

1095
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:26,240
Now that you got your head back,
you musn't lose it again.

1096
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,400
It's too late,
I'm beyond cure.

1097
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:33,320
- How's it feel to be a great analyst?
- Not so bad.

1098
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,880
- And a great detective?
- Wonderful.

1099
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,320
And madly adored?

1100
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,200
Very wonderful.

1101
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,440
You'll look wonderful...

1102
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:47,160
in white, with a little orange
blossom in your hair.

1103
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:51,520
That sounds vaguely as if it has
something to do with marriage.

1104
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:53,960
A brilliant analysis, Doctor.

1105
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,320
Hello.

1106
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,480
You know Lt. Cooley
and Sg. Gillespie from Rochester?

1107
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:06,200
- Yes, we know them quite well.
- How did you find us?

1108
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:10,360
- No thanks to your friend Dr. Brulov.
- We made enquiries at the station...

1109
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,560
- You left a trail a mile wide.
- You arrived in the nick of time.

1110
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,840
I believe that's
the usual expression.

1111
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,440
We found the body of Dr. Edwardes...

1112
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,720
It's almost exactly where you told
the local police it would be.

1113
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,240
- You remembered the spot very well.
- Thank goodness it's all cleared up.

1114
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,960
Not quite, Dr. Petersen. I'm afraid
a bullet was found in the body.

1115
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,600
That's impossible.

1116
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,320
- lt was in his back.
- The case is one of murder.

1117
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:46,120
We have to detain you, sir.
It's my duty to inform you...

1118
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,600
that anything you say may
be used against you.

1119
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,760
No, you mustn't say you killed him.
Try to remember what happened...

1120
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,600
before Edwardes went over.

1121
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,240
But when he said he killed him,
he wasn't himself...

1122
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,440
he was in a state of great
mental distress.

1123
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:08,760
You can't put him away,
you can't...

1124
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:11,360
It'll destroy his mind,
don't you understand?

1125
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,280
Goodbye my dear.

1126
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,840
We won't give up.
I'm going to fight and get you free.

1127
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:32,200
My dear girl, you can't keep bumping
your head against reality...

1128
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,720
and saying it is not there.

1129
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,400
The evidence was definite.

1130
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,320
We can't remove it by wishing
or crying.

1131
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,760
He trusted me. I led him into a trap.
I convicted him...

1132
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,240
Is that real enough for you?

1133
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,640
There is no one to blame...

1134
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:58,680
The case was a little deeper than
you figured, this often happens.

1135
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,840
You must realise one thing:
it is over, for both of you.

1136
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:06,280
It's not over.

1137
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,360
- You will have other cases.
- lt's not over, it never will be.

1138
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,520
Don't ask me to stop,
I can't.

1139
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,080
I'm sorry...

1140
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:29,120
Thanks for straightening things out
with Dr. Mercheson and everyone.

1141
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:41,360
It is very sad, to love
and lose somebody...

1142
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,160
but in a while you will forget...

1143
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:49,840
and take up the threads of your life
where you left off, not long ago...

1144
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:55,280
and you will work hard, there's lots
of happiness in working hard...

1145
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,880
Maybe the most.

1146
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,600
I will write to you.

1147
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,600
Alex, you're very good.

1148
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,440
I'm sorry to hurry you Dr. Brulov,
but your car is waiting...

1149
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,960
- You've just time.
- Thank you...

1150
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:23,040
I'm always late,
always forgetting.

1151
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:57,240
- A brilliant man.
- I should've gone to the station.

1152
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:01,280
You're too tired. I know that feeling
of exhaustion well.

1153
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,760
One must humour it,
or it explodes.

1154
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,240
I'll try to help you,
in every way.

1155
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,560
- You will take care of yourself?
- Yes.

1156
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,400
And try to forget things
better forgotten.

1157
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,080
You've got a great career
ahead of you Constance.

1158
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:20,520
Thank you. At least one good thing
came out of this...

1159
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:22,600
you're back at Green Manors.

1160
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:25,360
Who knows what would've happened
under Dr. Edwardes.

1161
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,040
I knew Edwardes only slightly,
I never really liked him...

1162
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,720
but he was a good man,
in a way, I suppose.

1163
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:39,320
Well, goodnight Constance, I hope
you feel rested in the morning.

1164
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,160
I knew Edwardes only slightly...

1165
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,880
I never liked him.

1166
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,920
I knew Edwardes only slightly...

1167
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,760
knew Edwardes slightly...

1168
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:03,960
knew Edwardes...
knew Edwardes slightly...

1169
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,880
knew Edwardes...

1170
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,480
knew...

1171
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,600
knew...

1172
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:14,440
knew...

1173
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,400
Come in.

1174
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,440
I want to talk to you,
Dr. Mercheson.

1175
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,200
It's rather late,
and you need rest, Constance.

1176
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:30,040
I must talk to you.

1177
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,880
Nocturnal conferences
are bad for the nerves.

1178
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,040
- ls it something about work?
- Yes.

1179
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,280
- Can't it wait till morning?
- lt can't wait.

1180
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,320
Do sit down.

1181
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,920
Now, what's your problem?

1182
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,360
It's a dream one of my patients
reported...

1183
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:54,280
- May I ask who the patient is?
- The patient is John Balentine.

1184
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,920
I fancied that.

1185
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,480
You're still working
on the possibility of his innocence?

1186
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:04,840
Charming loyalty, one of your most
attractive characteristics.

1187
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,080
What did he dream?

1188
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:12,640
That he was in a gambling house, full
of people playing with blank cards...

1189
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:21,160
Blank cards? Obviously he was trying
to deny it was a gambling house.

1190
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:24,800
One person went around cutting
the drapes in half...

1191
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,560
another was a scantily dressed girl
who was kissing everybody...

1192
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:31,840
With a little imagination one could
imagine them inmates of Green Manors.

1193
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:34,240
That's what I had in mind.

1194
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:39,800
Interesting notion to play around
with, do go on.

1195
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,480
There were eyes painted on
the curtains around the walls.

1196
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:48,160
Oh, the guards at Green Manors.

1197
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,280
The patient was playing cards,
no longer blank...

1198
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:56,080
a game of 21 with a bearded man,
who was evidently Dr. Edwardes...

1199
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:59,960
Yes, one usually dreams of one's
analyst with a beard.

1200
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:04,800
"He dealt Edwardes the 7 of clubs, and
Edwardes said, ""That makes it 21 ."""

1201
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,960
I'd say the patient was trying
to mention a locale...

1202
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:14,360
- the 7 of clubs might mean a club.
- Yes, with the word 21 in it.

1203
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:17,600
There is such a place in New York,
it's called the 21 Club.

1204
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,120
I've heard of it.

1205
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:24,960
The patient dreamt...

1206
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,960
the proprietor came in and began
accusing Dr. Edwardes of cheating...

1207
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,080
"He ordered Edwardes out and said,
""I won't allow you to play here..."

1208
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:34,760
"this is my place,
I'm going to fix you."""

1209
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:40,320
The locale has a double identity:
the 21 club, and Green Manors...

1210
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:43,640
But the proprietor seems to belong
more to the latter.

1211
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:51,920
In fact, I would say that this angry
proprietor who threatened Edwardes...

1212
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,360
was myself.

1213
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:58,680
It seemed that way to me.

1214
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,920
I presume you only arrived
at this solution tonight?

1215
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,480
Yes.

1216
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:12,280
And have confided your
psychoanalytical findings to nobody?

1217
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:13,520
Not yet.

1218
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,760
Was there any more of the dream?

1219
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:25,560
Yes. The patient dreamt he and
Edwardes were on a sloping roof...

1220
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,640
he saw Edwardes plunge
over the edge to his death.

1221
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,520
He also saw the angry proprietor
hiding behind a chimney laughing...

1222
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,440
holding a small wheel,
he dropped the wheel.

1223
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,160
The symbolism of the wheel
escapes me.

1224
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,600
It was a revolver.

1225
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:48,600
The proprietor who threatened
Edwardes life in the 21 Club...

1226
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:53,320
dropped a revolver in the snow,
after shooting him in the back.

1227
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,800
The weapon is still there
at the foot of a tree...

1228
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:59,360
with the murderer's
fingerprints on it.

1229
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,080
I can't agree with this part
of your interpretation...

1230
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,440
for the good reason that
the weapon is now in my hand.

1231
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,120
I imagined something
like this might happen...

1232
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,520
when I made the slip
about knowing Edwardes.

1233
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:16,160
That started your agile
young mind going.

1234
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:18,360
You were having a breakdown...

1235
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:22,600
In a state of panic you heard that
Edwardes was to take your place.

1236
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,760
So you sought him out
in the restaurant...

1237
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,880
where he was lunching
with John Balentine.

1238
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:33,240
You accused him of stealing your job.
You threatened to kill him.

1239
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:37,400
He calmed you down and told
you he was going skiing.

1240
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:43,040
You followed him there,
and shot him from behind a tree.

1241
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,480
That's enough.
Your story is ridiculous.

1242
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,440
You'll make a fool of yourself...

1243
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:50,120
a love smitten analyst,
playing dream detective.

1244
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,800
There'll be no dreams
for the police.

1245
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,880
They'll find out from the waiters
in the 21 Club that you were there...

1246
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,680
You'll be identified as the man who
had a row with Dr. Edwardes...

1247
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:05,600
There'll be people who saw you
on the train to Gabriel Valley.

1248
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:10,160
There'll be no dreams necessary
for this case.

1249
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:13,360
I see...

1250
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:19,320
you're an excellent analyst,
but a rather stupid woman.

1251
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:24,560
What did you think I'd do when you
told me this, congratulate you?

1252
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,120
You forget, in your devotion
to your patient...

1253
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:34,880
that the punishment for 2 murders
is the same as for one.

1254
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:40,640
You're not going to commit a
second murder, Dr. Mercheson.

1255
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:47,080
I hadn't planned to, but you're here.
You're not leaving.

1256
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:52,840
A man with your intelligence,
does not commit a stupid murder.

1257
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:57,680
You're thinking you're not mentally
responsible for that other crime...

1258
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:01,720
there were extenuating circumstances
in the state of your health...

1259
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:05,080
They'll not execute you
for the death of Dr. Edwardes.

1260
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,520
You can still live, read,
write, research...

1261
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:12,600
even if you are put away.

1262
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,960
You're thinking that now,
Dr. Mercheson.

1263
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:24,000
If you shoot now,
it is deliberate murder...

1264
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,960
You'll be tried as a sane murderer...

1265
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:32,840
convicted as a sane man, and killed
in the electric chair for your crime.

1266
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:36,560
I'm going to telephone the police,
Dr. Mercheson...

1267
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,880
And remember what I say...

1268
01:45:57,080 --> 01:46:01,560
Any husband of Constance,
is a husband of mine.

1269
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:03,800
- Goodbye, good luck.
- Goodbye.
