1
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:10,844
Here you go.

2
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,349
- You don´t want me to wait?
- No thanks, l´ll walk back.

3
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:34,952
Georgie.

4
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,873
How could I have forgotten?

5
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,459
l´m so sorry.

6
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,889
Take your pick.

7
00:00:58,684 --> 00:00:59,685
Billy-boy.

8
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,232
Except for the one on the end.

9
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,818
That´s already taken.

10
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,570
Sorry.

11
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,448
I remember you.

12
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,909
And I remember we beat you.

13
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,079
l´m not afraid of you.

14
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,501
l´m not afraid of you.

15
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,609
I know how old I look.

16
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,028
It´s just that I remember you as a kid.

17
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,280
Welcome home, Bill.

18
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,201
I wish it was under happier...

19
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,787
Come on, let´s go out.

20
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,292
I realized that I shouldn´t create any more
paranoia than we already have here.

21
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,503
I got a taste of it myself, earlier.

22
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,674
At least people seem to care now.
Or maybe it´s just that l´m a grown-up.

23
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,928
I feel so thick, Mike.
I don´t remember much at all.

24
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,015
I don´t even remember why I came back,
except for Georgie.

25
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,185
l´ll bet it doesn´t all come back at once.

26
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,895
How come you remember?

27
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,939
I never left, how could I forget?

28
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,942
I look on the street corner
and there we were. Seven of us.

29
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,068
Lucky seven.

30
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,280
Man, that just came back.

31
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,699
Something else.

32
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,410
- One of us lived around here.
- Right.

33
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,162
Bev!

34
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,747
Right down the street.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,961
She was poor. Her father was the janitor.
This was Poor Town.

36
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,921
Yeah, still is.

37
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,554
Yours?

38
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,100
l´m a bachelor, Bill. It´s all I need.

39
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,311
It´s clean and better yet, paid for.

40
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,484
- You hungry?
- I haven´t had an appetite since your call.

41
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,529
l´ve arranged dinner tonight for all of us.

42
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,489
Have you seen the others?

43
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:03,535
No. l´ve had a feeling all afternoon...

44
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,247
...I could tell when everyone has hit town.
We´re not all here, yet.

45
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,625
No.

46
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,460
You, too?

47
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,004
There it is. It´s powerful stuff.

48
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,381
Here´s to remembering.

49
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,094
What?

50
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,641
Maybe this will stimulate
those old memory banks a little.

51
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,274
Silver.

52
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,152
I found it in a pawn shop a year ago.

53
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,238
Something made me buy it.

54
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,700
It has a flat tire, but that´s all
that´s wrong with it. Here´s the kicker:

55
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,039
I bought this tube repair kit on impulse.

56
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,501
Three months before I saw this bike.

57
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,006
There was some kind of force
guiding us that summer.

58
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,176
I don´t know if we created it
or it came to help us.

59
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,846
Maybe it´s still here.

60
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,850
l´m going to change clothes.

61
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,589
"l´m getting bugged driving
up and down the same old strip

62
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,718
"I got to find a new place
where the kids are hip"

63
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,556
Oh, come on!

64
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,350
Not the Paramount, you slimeballs!

65
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:53,353
Where are the people
supposed to get their culture?

66
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,746
- May I help you?
- Mike Hanlon.

67
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,748
He stepped out a short while ago.

68
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,501
- l´m pretty sure he´s coming back.
- Good.

69
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,589
l´ll wait here for him.

70
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,134
Come on, Tozier, get a grip.

71
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,307
You looked like you could use this.
It´s just water.

72
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,185
Thank you.

73
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,238
A little young for you, isn´t she?

74
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,449
Beep, beep, Richie.

75
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,284
I didn´t hear that.

76
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,786
I didn´t!

77
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,038
I beg your pardon?

78
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,290
Come on up, Richie!

79
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,836
I got a balloon for you.

80
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,588
Don´t you want a balloon?

81
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,970
What´s the matter,
one balloon not enough?

82
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,264
Try a bunch!

83
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,165
Is everything all right?

84
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,209
Last chance, Tozier.

85
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,171
Get out before it gets dark tonight.

86
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,215
You´re all too old to stop me.

87
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,509
You´re all too old.

88
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,846
Tell Mike Hanlon if you see him...

89
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,682
Excuse me. Do you have Prince Albert
in a can?

90
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,728
You do? You´d better let the poor guy out.

91
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,399
Tell Mike Hanlon that I had to go.

92
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,028
I had to get cleaned up. Tell him.

93
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,738
Tell him.

94
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,407
Tell him l´ll see him tonight.

95
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,161
Last chance, Tozier. Get out!

96
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,538
Get out while you can.

97
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,916
Excuse me, ma´am...

98
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,336
...is your refrigerator running? It is?

99
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,714
You´d better catch it before it runs away.

100
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,637
All right!

101
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,574
Son of a gun.

102
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,785
Not just any cards, Bicycle.

103
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,663
They always make the best noise.

104
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,634
Bill?

105
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:56,972
I see it.

106
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,107
Follow up on the Miller thing.
l´ll call Todd myself.

107
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,902
What about the engineer´s report?

108
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,111
What´s that?

109
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:16,158
You´re breaking up.
l´ll call you from the hotel.

110
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,046
Pull over here.

111
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,845
Wait for me.

112
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,748
You´re it! You´re it!

113
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,626
- You´re dead, fat boy.
- Come on!

114
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,461
You´re going to die!

115
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,007
Come on!

116
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,595
You´re dead! You´re dead!

117
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,728
- You´re it, porky.
- You´re it!

118
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,773
- Have a nice trip.
- See you later, porky.

119
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,577
- Are you okay, buddy?
- My knee.

120
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,964
Lucky for me you had that hankie.

121
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,051
Be prepared. You can keep it.

122
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,763
l´ll be okay now.

123
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,474
Hang tough, champ. You´ll make it.

124
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,313
Ben Hanscom!

125
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,734
Nice to see you again.

126
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,863
What have you been up to all these years?

127
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,791
We can´t wait to get you
down here with us.

128
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,630
You´re only in my mind.

129
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,726
Any spare change, mister?

130
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,479
Hey, who walked all over your grave?

131
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,190
I wasn´t going to hurt you.

132
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,943
I don´t even know you.

133
00:12:59,029 --> 00:12:59,988
Let´s go.

134
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,288
- Derry Inn, did you say?
- Yeah.

135
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,124
Reliving your childhood down there?

136
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,004
Something like that.
Saying hi to some old ghosts.

137
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,039
Time does go by.

138
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,882
Here´s that prescription.

139
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,050
How old are you now?

140
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,845
Eleven. Almost 12.

141
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,223
Come with me.

142
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,278
Relax, l´m not going to bite you.

143
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,240
Most of your troubles comes
from being so tight all the time.

144
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,910
Take your asthma, for instance.

145
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,831
You know what a placebo is?

146
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,541
I got to go.

147
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,212
It´s water with a squirt of camphor
to make it taste like medicine.

148
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:39,588
No.

149
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,133
Your doctor is weak and your mother
is determined that you´re ill.

150
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,135
You´re caught in the middle.

151
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,640
It´s a lie. I do have asthma.

152
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:53,936
Sir?

153
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:56,897
Your prescription.

154
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,238
Nothing like a good pull
on the old lung sucker.

155
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,823
Thank you.

156
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,661
Junior, bring me a cigar.

157
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,704
You can´t have one, Granddad.

158
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:16,500
Mr. Keene?

159
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,048
Mr. Keene. Hello.

160
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,468
Cigar for the old man?

161
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,470
l´m sorry. I don´t have any.

162
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,807
l´m Eddie, Sonia Kaspbrak´s son.

163
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:34,476
Any licorice?

164
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,938
I was always partial to licorice.

165
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:45,445
I wanted to thank you for trying
to tell me the truth long ago.

166
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,161
You look a little peaked, sonny.

167
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,040
l´d better go.

168
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,500
Hydrox.

169
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,756
H2O. Water.

170
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,510
It´s only water.

171
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,513
It´s all in your head, sonny.

172
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,850
You do remember me.

173
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,146
Mr. Keene?

174
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,774
Get out of Derry while you still can.

175
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,776
Mr. Keene, please.

176
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,362
Beware, little Eddie.

177
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,365
Beware, girly-boy.

178
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,247
No cigar, sonny.

179
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,959
I was always partial to licorice.

180
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:24,044
I must have rung the wrong bell.
I was looking for Marsh.

181
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:27,297
There´s no Marsh here. Unless...

182
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,925
Do you mean Alvin Marsh?

183
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,760
Yes, my father.

184
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,554
Oh, Miss...

185
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:38,600
...I hate to be the one to tell you,
but your father´s been dead for five years.

186
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,103
But on the bell...

187
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,693
Kersh. I thought it said, "Marsh."

188
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,863
l´m Mrs. Kersh. I knew your father a little.

189
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,117
- Come in for some tea.
- No, I couldn´t.

190
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,452
You could and you will. I insist.

191
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,509
Feel free to look around.

192
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,637
Perhaps you´d like to freshen up?

193
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:53,425
Did you fall asleep in there? lt´s teatime.

194
00:18:58,597 --> 00:18:59,389
Tea.

195
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,309
Tea would be nice.

196
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,354
I love what you´ve done with the place.

197
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:08,106
It´s so different, so cozy.

198
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,025
How kind you are, miss.

199
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,445
I call all the young girls, miss.
Don´t take offense.

200
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:14,988
No.

201
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,251
Go on, dear, drink it while it´s nice and hot.

202
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:45,310
Don´t trouble your pretty little head.
l´ll get it.

203
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,230
It did say Marsh on the doorbell.

204
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,275
If you´re wise, you´ll run, dear.

205
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:56,071
Because to stay will mean worse than
your death. They float down there.

206
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:58,740
They float.

207
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,746
I worry about you, Bev. I worry a lot.

208
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,334
It won´t do you any good to run.

209
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:15,424
You´re not real! Not real!

210
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,345
Beep, beep!

211
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:16,026
Since you first introduced me to him
I told you he was a twit.

212
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:19,446
- Remember?
- I didn´t ask you here to insult Bill.

213
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,615
How dare he do this to me.

214
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,826
You´ve complained about him
since we started the picture.

215
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,371
He´ll never work in movies again.
You know that.

216
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:31,041
If you could have seen his face.
It was frightening.

217
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:35,838
Nothing like a crisis to bring
the estranged couple closer together.

218
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,800
Or perhaps pull them farther apart,
if the gods are smiling.

219
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,093
Greco, please.

220
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:45,222
I am simply pointing out that this
could be a blessing in disguise.

221
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,559
Could you give me a few days?

222
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,521
I shall pretend I didn´t hear that, Audra.

223
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,108
I can replace your imbecilic husband,
but not you.

224
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,279
Don´t think about leaving.

225
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,157
You´ve worked hard to get where you are.

226
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,743
I know you won´t jeopardize that.

227
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:10,539
Or damage our professional relationship.

228
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:15,586
Or turn a friend into a violent enemy,
ready to crucify you at any cost.

229
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,675
There´s no need to talk now.

230
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,013
See you tomorrow.

231
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,449
International reservations, please.

232
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,536
l´d like a seat on your next flight
to the United States.

233
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,101
l´m looking for the Hanlon party.

234
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,231
Eddie?

235
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,150
- Eddie Kaspbrak.
- Haystack!

236
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:24,988
- What happened to the rest of you?
- Gone but not forgotten.

237
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:29,868
My god.

238
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,831
Where´s Richie Tozier
when you need a good line?

239
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,125
- Ben?
- l´m afraid so, Bill.

240
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,418
Look at you.

241
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:44,842
- Mike, is that you?
- Such as I am.

242
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,640
Who wants a drink?

243
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,600
- Set them up.
- l´ll have one.

244
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:55,310
- What is this?
- That´s my dog.

245
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,896
- l´ll have a club soda, okay?
- This is pretty good.

246
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,947
Tozier, get a grip.
Don´t let them see you like this.

247
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:11,243
It was a flashback
from too much fun in ´67. Get a hold.

248
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,621
You´re working too hard.

249
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,792
I got a toast. I propose...

250
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:21,003
Who got bald, who got wrinkled...

251
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,130
...and how many of God´s children
got wings?

252
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:26,425
Beep, beep, Richie!

253
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,514
- Hey, buddy, how are you?
- Fine, fine. You?

254
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:34,224
Beverly?

255
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,978
What a bunch of handsome old men.

256
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,494
Hi, good-looking.

257
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:56,914
Richie.

258
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:00,876
Eddie!

259
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:04,421
l´d rather catch you than anyone else
in the world, Beverly Marsh.

260
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:14,806
I saw all of you standing there and so
much came flooding back, like a wave.

261
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,061
What are we getting ourselves into?

262
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,153
l´m so proud of you.

263
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:30,489
Where´s...

264
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,211
Are you all right, Bev?

265
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,630
Yes.

266
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:49,049
No. I...

267
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,469
I saw something today.

268
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,763
- Same with me.
- Oh, man!

269
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:58,058
- What I saw at the library...
- Was it Pennywise?

270
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,519
With both barrels, it was Pennywise.

271
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:02,062
He´s working on us already.

272
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,690
- Trying to chip away.
- Maybe that means he´s afraid.

273
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:06,942
It. It´s afraid.

274
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:08,735
Oh, man. It!

275
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,989
Help us remember, Mike, fill in the gaps.

276
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:15,993
Yes, because I don´t know what
you´re talking about.

277
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:22,499
I can´t remember much of anything.
When I try, it clouds over.

278
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:25,752
Didn´t you feel it?

279
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:30,799
As soon as I crossed the county line
a veil dropped over my eyes.

280
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,801
Maybe it´s the water.

281
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,512
Water? Maybe it´s the sewer.

282
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,475
This is battery acid, you slime!

283
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:52,946
l´m okay.

284
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:55,949
I remember who Pennywise was now.

285
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,744
Big white guy, red nose...

286
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,998
...about 75 feet tall,
mouth full of razor sharp teeth.

287
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,709
Oh, Eddie.

288
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,007
What the hell is happening, you guys?

289
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,468
What is going on?

290
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:21,350
l´m sorry. It was a very vivid memory.

291
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:25,521
l´d forgotten I stared into that creep´s face.

292
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,732
You saved Stan´s life. Remember?

293
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,484
Yeah.

294
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:33,028
Yeah, now I do.

295
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:36,114
Speaking of Stan. Stan? Stan!

296
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:40,786
- Where is his royal straightness?
- You talked to him, right, Mike?

297
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:42,663
I think he´ll be along.

298
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:46,458
We ought to start without him.
We can fill him in when he gets here.

299
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:49,628
- Mike, help us remember.
- Wait a minute.

300
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:54,716
This is the first time since I got here
that I feel good. Halfway safe.

301
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:59,179
Let´s have a couple of drinks,
some good food and a couple of chucks.

302
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:02,558
- Leave the wolf out the door.
- Spoken like a real loser, Richie.

303
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,893
Hey, to the loser´s club.

304
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,813
To the loser´s club.

305
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:22,721
Talking about your wives?

306
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,265
How many times have you been
to the altar, Richie?

307
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:30,354
Four or five. Women all want
the same thing. No offense, Bev.

308
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:34,149
None taken, creep.
Welcome to the fourth century.

309
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,734
Ben, are you married?

310
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,695
Nope, l´ve dodged the bullet
a number of times, now.

311
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,072
Eddie?

312
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,161
l´m seeing a wonderful woman,
but with work I don´t have much time.

313
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:50,040
Take it from me, spaghetti man,
better dead than wed.

314
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:53,752
- Any little crumb snatchers for you, Richie?
- None that I know of.

315
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,921
- How about you, Bev?
- What?

316
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:57,840
How about you?

317
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:03,178
l´m not married.

318
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,141
- What happened to those glasses?
- Contact lenses.

319
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,645
For the many times as you broke
those glasses...

320
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:14,815
...you should have had stock in an
adhesive tape company.

321
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,775
Me and Henry Bowers.

322
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:22,990
Please tell me he was hit
by a freight train and put out of his misery.

323
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:26,243
No such luck. He´s at Juniper Hills.

324
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,330
Ever since he confessed to murdering
all the children.

325
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,125
- He was down in the sewers.
- He tried to kill Stan.

326
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,668
He was going to kill us all.

327
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:37,963
I remember when they pulled him out,
his hair was white.

328
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,591
- He was babbling about a bright light.
- And a clown.

329
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,301
No one believed him.

330
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:44,052
Except when he said he killed them.

331
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:47,389
- We didn´t say anything.
- Not a word.

332
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:50,767
But It was the killer and we stopped lt.

333
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:52,978
We thought we did.

334
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:04,156
Henry.

335
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:06,992
Henry Bowers.

336
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,124
Up here, sharp stuff.

337
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:17,586
Up here!

338
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,048
You helped me once. Remember?

339
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:26,136
You chased those brats.
Almost got them. Almost.

340
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,348
Don´t you want another chance?

341
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:32,684
You´ve got to go back and finish the job.

342
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,772
Go back to Derry and kill them all. For me.

343
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,192
Kill them all.

344
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,869
Kill them all!

345
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:56,375
This has been a real hoot...

346
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:58,919
...but I have a plane out at 6:00 am.

347
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,254
You´re not leaving?

348
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,422
Bev, you want an adventure?

349
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,760
You want to relive that old nightmare?

350
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:10,597
I love you, but count me out.
l´m going to a hotel.

351
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:14,393
In the morning,
l´m on a plane and out of here forever.

352
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,187
- I will remember all of you fondly.
- Richie?

353
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:21,608
- We´re all scared. Don´t be ashamed.
- Maybe he´s right.

354
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:25,946
Are you talking about going back
in the sewer?

355
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:29,575
We haven´t talked about anything yet.

356
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:33,829
Give Mike a chance to fill us in before
we scatter to the four winds.

357
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,414
Is that too much trouble?

358
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,542
I just want to go get some sleep.
Is that too much to ask?

359
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:42,004
- Why don´t we show Mike some courtesy...
- Guys! Come, on!

360
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:44,464
It´s all right.
If Richie wants to go, he goes.

361
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,342
We came here based on the strength
of a promise.

362
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:50,846
Everyone at this table
made good on that promise.

363
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,764
Wherever we go from here...

364
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:55,726
...I have no expectations.

365
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:57,811
Well said, Michael.

366
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,688
It´s taken care of, Richie.

367
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,857
No, you can´t do that.

368
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:03,734
That´s just the way it is.

369
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:09,740
A toast to Mike Hanlon.

370
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:13,035
A man without whom none of this
would have been necessary.

371
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:14,578
I can see my fortune now:

372
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:18,332
"You´ll be eaten by a big,
greasy monster. Have a nice day."

373
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:46,735
Dummy up, everybody.

374
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:58,497
What is it? Is something wrong?

375
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,584
Our friend had an asthma attack.

376
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:05,420
l´m much better now. Thank you.

377
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,298
Everything was okay?

378
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,801
Fine. Thank you.

379
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:22,271
l´m not so sleepy anymore.

380
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,482
Let´s get the hell out of here.

381
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,998
Is this the Uris residence?

382
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:45,043
Is Stan there?
This is an old friend, Mike Hanlon.

383
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,630
What are we supposed to do now?

384
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:52,926
A little soap and elbow grease
ought to clean this right up.

385
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:13,780
Why are we the only ones
that can see this?

386
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:18,327
l´m stumped. Let´s ask the answer man.
Oh, Mike?

387
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:22,331
Michel...

388
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,041
...garçon?

389
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:27,503
Hello, Stan? Mike Hanlon.

390
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:30,672
Is this the Uris residence?
l´m trying to reach Stan Uris.

391
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:34,676
Tell him if he hasn´t left yet,
he´s a dead man.

392
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:38,680
We all managed to show up.
That matches your real hair.

393
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:41,058
Is anyone from out of town?

394
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:45,771
I flew in from L.A.,
and my tail section is tired.

395
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:52,194
It´s great to be back in Derry,
breathing that old Derry air.

396
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:56,532
I have never felt so much love in one
room in my entire life.

397
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:59,701
Eddie, get their names
for my Christmas mailer.

398
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:04,248
Wait, put Denbrough there,
on my Norman Mailer!

399
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:11,630
This man is like the brother I never had.
He is the brother I never had.

400
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:13,924
Stan?

401
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:24,852
Thank you.

402
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:30,190
Stan is dead.

403
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:43,287
He cut his wrists in the bathtub
right after I phoned him.

404
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:13,942
Stan was the last one to see It
that summer.

405
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:16,778
Remember?

406
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:20,240
He just kept saying
it wasn´t empirically possible.

407
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,203
Even seeing the clown
didn´t make it real for him.

408
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,121
Nothing did.

409
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:28,415
Until that afternoon in August.

410
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,133
I was coming down Chestnut Street.

411
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:41,345
I saw Stan running like something
was after him.

412
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:43,514
Go!

413
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,934
- Go!
- Hi yo, Silver. Away!

414
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:51,188
Stan saw It that day, I honestly didn´t.

415
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:57,903
I was pedaling too fast to turn around.
I didn´t want to see it. Whatever it was.

416
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:01,114
It took hours before he could tell me
what happened.

417
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:06,036
He was in Lampkin Park by a bird feeder.

418
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:08,539
Watching birds.

419
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,583
Like a good boy scout. Remember?

420
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,794
He used to call it collecting birds.

421
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:23,887
Stan...

422
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:27,808
Stan...

423
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,573
He said he didn´t mean
to go into that house, but...

424
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:46,743
...this voice kept whispering to him.

425
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:51,206
Being Stan, he figured there was
a rational explanation.

426
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,209
Hello?

427
00:38:57,254 --> 00:38:58,714
Stanley.

428
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,801
Yeah? l´m right here.

429
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:33,916
He was trapped.

430
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:37,836
He held his bird book out
in front of him like a shield and...

431
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:41,298
...say loudly the names
of all the birds he could remember.

432
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,382
Longneck finch...

433
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:44,593
...speckled grouse, Baltimore oriole...

434
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:51,225
...gray egret, hammerhead woodpecker
and brown thrush.

435
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:55,062
Brown thrush.

436
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:59,024
The day we went into the sewer...

437
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,318
...Stan saw lt.

438
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:04,279
Face to face.

439
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:10,869
He saw what was behind the clown.

440
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,291
He ran up to me in school and said:

441
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,210
"I saw lt, Eddie.

442
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,964
"I looked right into its..."

443
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:25,717
Some kind of lights.

444
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:30,305
"I looked right into its deadlights."

445
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:36,603
I hadn´t thought of it until now, he said:

446
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:42,025
"I looked into its deadlights
and I wanted to be there."

447
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:43,986
Deadlights.

448
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:58,625
- I need a drink.
- Me, too.

449
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,462
l´m sure I have something here.
Anybody else?

450
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:15,934
Sorry l´m late. Let´s see who´s here.

451
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,189
Billy-boy!

452
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:24,151
You still here, Richie?
We didn´t expect you to stick around.

453
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:26,528
Nice nose job. No one would ever suspect.

454
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:27,988
Haystack...

455
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:29,615
...putting on a little weight?

456
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:33,744
Bev, your dad isn´t worried anymore.
Your dad loves your taste in men.

457
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:37,331
Wheezy, how´s your sex life?
What´s your sex life?

458
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,709
Mike you did it. You got us all back here.

459
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:44,713
It´s the only way you´d ever see us
since you´ll never leave this town.

460
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:48,217
I made it. l´m in the deadlights now.

461
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:53,639
It´s true what they say.
We float down here and you will, too.

462
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:57,017
In fact, they all float!

463
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:59,811
They all float!

464
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,084
My God!

465
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,458
I don´t know about the rest of you,
l´m getting real sick of this place.

466
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:07,588
l´ll listen to anything anyone has to say,
but can we go someplace else?

467
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:08,755
Please!

468
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:10,632
Help me with the stuff.

469
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,601
What is it?

470
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:34,656
"He thrusts his fists against the post
and still insists he see the ghosts."

471
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:36,783
It says that over and over again.

472
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:41,622
My mom gave me that to say...

473
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,293
...to help with my stutter.

474
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:52,841
No offense, pal, it ain´t helping.

475
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:01,266
Let´s get the hell out of here.
What do you say?

476
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:24,414
Henry!

477
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:26,542
Down here.

478
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:36,176
What are you doing down there?

479
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:40,222
You have a problem in there,
you need help with, Henry?

480
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:46,186
That´s a good boy.

481
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:54,444
You don´t have to talk. I can hear
what you think and they can´t hear me.

482
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:58,156
- What do you want?
- Same thing you want.

483
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:00,242
I want to pay them back.

484
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,495
Yeah, pay them back.

485
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:07,040
You have to get out of here
and go back to Derry.

486
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:12,880
I need you, Henry. We all need you.

487
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:15,299
They can´t hurt you.

488
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:18,552
We didn´t think they could hurt us
back then, but they did.

489
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:21,597
- Bested you all summer.
- Don´t talk about that.

490
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:24,808
I can take care of them
if they only half believe.

491
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,603
But you´re alive, Henry.

492
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:32,191
You can get them if they believe,
half believe or don´t believe at all.

493
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:35,736
One by one, Henry.

494
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:37,362
I can´t get out of here.

495
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:40,282
There are wires on the windows and...

496
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:44,745
...Koontz on the door tonight.
He´s the worst.

497
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:46,580
I hate him.

498
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:48,749
l´ll take care of Koontz.

499
00:45:57,841 --> 00:45:59,259
Lead the way, Henry.

500
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,304
Lead the way.

501
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:25,827
l´ve had it with you. Your head will be
be bouncing off the floor!

502
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:00,529
No, Mike.

503
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:06,660
I will have no need of this stuff.
Thanks for thinking of me.

504
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:10,455
But none for me, thank you very much!

505
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:12,541
- Richie, you´re shouting.
- I know!

506
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:15,377
Beep, beep, Richie. Beep, beep.

507
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:18,380
Talk to us, Mike. Tell us stories.

508
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:22,217
So we don´t have to remember
what we saw in the library.

509
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,890
Don´t let it get you. Fight it.

510
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,437
I saw myself today.
I saw myself back there.

511
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:37,649
I know it´s just camphor water,
but I need it.

512
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:39,568
Take it easy, pal.

513
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:44,573
If it works, it´s good medicine.
You believe in it, that´s all that matters.

514
00:47:47,284 --> 00:47:51,079
l´m sure you all remember
what happened 30 years ago.

515
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:55,792
There was a rash of killings,
disappearances, mostly of children.

516
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:58,754
Everybody was afraid,
but nobody did anything.

517
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:01,340
Until we went after lt.

518
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,886
We almost killed lt.

519
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:11,892
Henry Bowers confessed
and the killings stopped.

520
00:48:11,975 --> 00:48:14,603
Until this year, exactly 30 years later.

521
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:16,605
First thing you should know:

522
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:20,067
If you count backwards in 30-year
increments, every date corresponds...

523
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,861
...to a huge disaster in Derry´s history.

524
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:25,405
In 1960, the big fire at the Black Spot Club.

525
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:28,283
In 1930, the explosion at the old ironworks.

526
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:31,954
In 1900, the massacre at Drake´s Creek.
And on, and on.

527
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:38,627
The biggest mystery is how 253 settlers
just disappeared without a trace.

528
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:44,091
Thank you for that illuminating,
if somewhat morbid, history.

529
00:48:44,842 --> 00:48:46,510
She didn´t want to know.

530
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,720
You knew about this even then...

531
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:50,764
...Miss Douglas didn´t want to know.

532
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,808
It´s a disease, Bev.

533
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:55,811
The Derry disease.
None of them wants to know.

534
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:59,565
- It´s too horrible they...
- They act like nothing happened.

535
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:02,693
I remember a man, Mr. Ross...

536
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:08,407
...he was on his front porch,
I was coming home from school.

537
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:12,536
Henry Bowers was waiting
right outside my house.

538
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,958
I saw Mr. Ross across the street.

539
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:22,921
He looked so concerned, I thought
he was going to help me, but...

540
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:27,467
...he just turned around and went inside.

541
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:39,813
That was when I knew there was
something terribly wrong with Derry.

542
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:42,524
How did you get out of that, Bev?

543
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:47,237
Daddy came home, one of the only times
I was glad to see him.

544
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:54,203
So, it´s 30 years later
and the killings are right on schedule.

545
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:58,665
Six so far, maybe more.
Some have disappeared with no trace.

546
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:02,211
I wanted to be certain
before I called anyone.

547
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:06,548
I became certain when I found something
at the latest crime site.

548
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,009
That was just yesterday.

549
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:14,097
Anyway, this is it.

550
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:20,896
Georgie?

551
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:31,490
There´s something special
about us being together.

552
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:35,202
We found each other that summer
and together we were strong.

553
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:38,580
Otherwise, It would have picked us off,
one by one.

554
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:43,418
Is it an accident that none of us have kids?
Including Stan.

555
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:48,715
When we first came together,
we were all losers.

556
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:52,803
Now look at you.

557
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:56,098
Six of you left Derry
and became unusually successful.

558
00:50:56,265 --> 00:50:57,599
Big-time breadwinners.

559
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:59,184
Leaving you holding the bag.

560
00:50:59,268 --> 00:51:03,146
You kept the lighthouse for the rest of us.
I feel like a real jerk about that.

561
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:04,314
Me, too.

562
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:09,361
It´s no one´s fault.
Our parents decided who stayed and went.

563
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,239
When I grew up, I wanted to stay.

564
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:15,033
I think you stayed because you had to.

565
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:18,120
I don´t know what will happen
when the sun comes up...

566
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:21,206
...but I appreciate what you´ve done
for everyone.

567
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:48,567
- Good evening. You´re up late.
- How much farther is Derry?

568
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:55,199
About 500 yards to the city limits.

569
00:51:55,908 --> 00:52:00,120
Thank God. I nearly fell asleep.
I feel like l´ve been driving forever.

570
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:03,165
Cross the bridge at the barrens
and turn left.

571
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:04,750
The barrens?

572
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,920
Yes, where they used to play
when they were kids.

573
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:13,383
Thank you. l´ll be going now.

574
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:19,264
Don´t you want your balloon,
Mrs. Denbrough?

575
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:21,558
Don´t you want it?

576
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:24,478
Don´t you want it?

577
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:27,272
Don´t you want it?

578
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,358
Don´t you want it?

579
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:31,235
Don´t you want it?

580
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:43,455
They caught me and started slapping me.

581
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:48,544
The coach found me crying
and I thought he would help me.

582
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:52,464
Instead, he made fun of me and I got mad.

583
00:52:52,548 --> 00:52:56,844
I said, "You coach track, right?"
He sneered at me and nodded, and I said:

584
00:52:56,927 --> 00:53:00,264
"Listen, stone-brained son of a bitch,
l´ll go after the track team.

585
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:02,140
"l´ll run down everything you got.

586
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:06,395
"l´ll beat your best
and expect an apology from you."

587
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:07,688
All right.

588
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:09,690
So you did it?

589
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:13,527
I ran until my heart pounded so hard...

590
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,070
...I thought I would pass out.

591
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:17,281
After my first mile, I puked, then fainted.

592
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:22,578
Finally, I was holding up my pants as I ran.
I ate salads like there was no tomorrow.

593
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:26,540
By March, l´d lost 70 pounds
and l´d grown two inches.

594
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,042
Every time I ran, I felt like I could fly.

595
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:31,753
- And you went out?
- I went out for track like I said.

596
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:34,756
First time I was out there
I won the 220 and the 440.

597
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:38,427
I just blew away the coaches.
After practice I walked up to the coach...

598
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:41,430
...and I asked for apology.
He was so furious, he hit me.

599
00:53:41,471 --> 00:53:43,390
- No! After all that...
- It was perfect!

600
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:45,767
- You beat him!
- And everybody knew it.

601
00:53:46,143 --> 00:53:48,937
I graduated from El Paso High
with a letter in track.

602
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:52,566
The coach lost his job
over that little love tap.

603
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:56,111
It´s great! You ought to write that down.

604
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:58,697
- Bill´s our writer.
- Only horror stories.

605
00:53:58,864 --> 00:54:01,867
We haven´t talked about what
we´re going to do, if anything.

606
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:04,953
Oh, Mike.

607
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:10,125
Listen, kids.
This campfire stuff is fun, it really is...

608
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:13,629
...but no matter how painstakingly
we go over these sewer plans...

609
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:16,798
...or how many damn flashlights
or helmets you got in that box...

610
00:54:16,882 --> 00:54:21,261
...when the sun rises, l´m dust,
and I suggest the rest of you follow.

611
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:23,263
And get the hell out of Dodge!

612
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:25,724
- I cleaned it up once.
- Cleaned what?

613
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,144
The blood.

614
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,481
I cleaned the whole thing up
that very same night.

615
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:08,267
I decided if I was going to sleep in this
house again, l´d have to know the truth.

616
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:11,603
To see if anyone besides me
could see the blood.

617
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:27,077
What happened in here?
Somebody get murdered?

618
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:32,124
You see it? You really see it?

619
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:38,088
Come on, let´s clean this up.

620
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:46,930
Until that moment,
I thought I was going crazy.

621
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:50,601
It was strange to be happy
about something so grim.

622
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:54,146
I fell in love with all of you that day.

623
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:57,774
After we cleaned it up,
the blood never came back.

624
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,409
It will be morning soon.

625
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,747
- l´m cold.
- Me, too.

626
00:56:12,456 --> 00:56:15,250
- l´ll get you something.
- There´s a shawl in my room.

627
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:18,170
Give me your key and l´ll get it.

628
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:20,589
Richie, you have a key?

629
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:22,299
Listen up.

630
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:24,468
Stay together. No stragglers.

631
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:29,473
- Just get the first thing you find.
- I need to stretch anyway.

632
00:56:29,723 --> 00:56:30,724
Ben.

633
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:33,769
- Don´t go alone.
- I need a refill anyway.

634
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:35,979
l´ll join you.

635
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:49,618
l´ll take care of Richie.

636
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:52,955
We meet back here in three minutes,
no more. Keep your doors open.

637
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,675
Hello, nigger. l´ll pay you back.

638
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:48,302
l´ll pay you all back.

639
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:04,818
Oh, good. You found lt.

640
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:11,867
l´m glad we´re alone for a minute.
I want to tell you something.

641
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:18,081
"Your hair is winter fire. January embers."

642
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:22,920
- "My heart burns there, too."
- It was you.

643
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:26,798
l´ve been waiting a long time
to thank the poet.

644
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:34,056
- Did you ask Bill first?
- No.

645
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:37,601
I knew it was you.
l´ve always known it was you.

646
00:58:39,394 --> 00:58:42,356
I think I must have been waiting
until we were both ready.

647
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:45,567
l´m ready now. Are you?

648
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,225
Kiss me, fat boy!

649
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:07,357
Mike! Mike!

650
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:09,026
Mike!

651
01:00:13,322 --> 01:00:14,323
I got him.

652
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,369
- In a minute.
- Give me a hand.

653
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:21,538
Watch it! Okay, easy.

654
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,543
- In the car.
- Hurry up!

655
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:28,545
Go! Go! Go!

656
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,793
If Mike dies there will be five of us left.

657
01:01:09,378 --> 01:01:11,755
Who comes next? Which one of us?

658
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:15,717
Why is It doing this?

659
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:17,761
Why does It hate?

660
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,806
Why is It so mean?

661
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:31,441
Oh, Ben.

662
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:35,737
I want to tell you something.

663
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,407
Remember what my father was like?

664
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:42,578
I fell in love with a man who...

665
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:47,082
...who turned out to be
everything I hated in my father.

666
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:54,214
Why would I do that?
How could I be so blind?

667
01:01:55,632 --> 01:01:59,928
If you see it now, you´re not blind anymore.

668
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:03,140
Congratulations. That´s a miracle.

669
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:07,060
Besides, at least you fell in love
with somebody.

670
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:11,315
At least you felt something.

671
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:14,109
That´s a miracle, too.

672
01:02:15,485 --> 01:02:17,446
You have the heart of a poet, Ben.

673
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:23,660
"Your hair is winter fire."

674
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:28,916
- Why did you say that?
- You wrote it didn´t you?

675
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:32,127
"Your hair is winter fire.
January embers."

676
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:35,297
I first thought it was Bill,
but it was you, wasn´t it?

677
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,508
Damn it, is that you or the clown?

678
01:02:37,716 --> 01:02:40,677
I don´t know what´s going on!
How am I supposed to know?

679
01:02:42,888 --> 01:02:43,680
It´s me.

680
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:58,237
"My heart burns there, too."

681
01:03:33,814 --> 01:03:35,858
- Mike will be okay.
- Can we see him?

682
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:39,444
He´s not out of the woods yet.
One of you can go in for a minute.

683
01:03:49,997 --> 01:03:50,998
Mike?

684
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:54,668
Everyone else is right outside.

685
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:58,046
- Henry?
- He´s dead.

686
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:01,091
- Police?
- Not yet.

687
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:05,304
We can´t trust anyone.

688
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:10,142
If anyone asks, a party got out of hand.
You were dancing on a table and fell off.

689
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:14,229
Anyone who´s seen me dance will buy that.

690
01:04:16,023 --> 01:04:18,942
- What are you going to do?
- I don´t know, man.

691
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:20,944
I honestly do not know.

692
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,072
My jacket. Outside pocket.

693
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:37,836
It´s silver. It can kill lt.

694
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:41,340
We left these down in the...

695
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,345
You went back?

696
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:50,015
I was pretty sure It was asleep.

697
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:52,267
Pretty sure?

698
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,603
You went alone?

699
01:04:55,646 --> 01:04:59,233
Ten years ago my life was going downhill.
I was close to suicide.

700
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:02,402
Maybe I wanted It to wake up and kill me.

701
01:05:02,694 --> 01:05:06,281
Took me all day in the dark.
I found one right away.

702
01:05:06,907 --> 01:05:08,242
In the drain trap.

703
01:05:08,534 --> 01:05:11,912
The one that hit Pennywise was lodged
in a crack in the wall.

704
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,834
I figured we might need them again
some day.

705
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:21,088
When I came out I got my life together.

706
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:24,299
The only change was this.

707
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,301
Almost overnight.

708
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:30,514
Fear.

709
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:33,809
Bill.

710
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,395
If you decide not to use those...

711
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,982
...if you leave, l´ll understand.

712
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,615
That is a dead body.

713
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:51,910
You´re not suggesting we walk out
and leave it here?

714
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:53,161
That´s what I am suggesting.

715
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:55,873
- I think we should call the police.
- I agree.

716
01:05:55,956 --> 01:05:59,626
You don´t understand. This whole town
is It in some way. All of them.

717
01:06:10,387 --> 01:06:11,680
Bill´s right.

718
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:16,226
If we call the police something bad
will happen to one of us.

719
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,561
Maybe all of us.

720
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:22,816
Have it your way. Stan is dead.
Mike came close. l´ve seen enough.

721
01:06:22,941 --> 01:06:26,069
- l´m with you, boy?
- You can put this behind you like that?

722
01:06:26,153 --> 01:06:29,781
l´m too old for monster hunting.
So was Mike.

723
01:06:30,157 --> 01:06:31,491
So was Stan.

724
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:33,869
Is that how you feel about it?

725
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:36,538
I don´t know.
I can´t stay in this room much longer.

726
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:40,709
I suggest we turn on the TV,
hang a "Do not disturb" sign on the door...

727
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:43,212
...go outside and figure out what to do.

728
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:44,922
I second that.

729
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:00,062
The Police Chief said the victim...

730
01:07:00,145 --> 01:07:03,440
...a five-year-old girl,
was playing near her home.

731
01:07:03,815 --> 01:07:06,777
Authorities have not determined
if there´s connection...

732
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:10,197
...between this
and the other missing young children.

733
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:13,700
They did say, however,
that the body was severely mutilated.

734
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:18,330
In other news, a series of robberies
in the East end has local...

735
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,961
Just put that on my card
and send me the receipt.

736
01:07:24,086 --> 01:07:26,088
- Certainly.
- Me, too, thank you.

737
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:28,298
Loads of fun. Got to go.

738
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:15,929
Need a ride, Bill?

739
01:08:16,263 --> 01:08:18,599
- Where are you going?
- Airport.

740
01:08:18,932 --> 01:08:21,310
- I guess we are, too.
- Come with us.

741
01:08:22,227 --> 01:08:25,898
I just saw something
and I don´t know if it was real.

742
01:08:27,357 --> 01:08:29,401
Or if any of you would have seen it.

743
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:32,279
I can´t go.

744
01:08:33,614 --> 01:08:36,491
If I do l´m going to live with this
until I go insane.

745
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:41,455
Until I can´t tell the difference
between my life and my bad dreams.

746
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:45,000
For years l´ve been paid to scare people.

747
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:49,046
But l´m the one who´s been scared.

748
01:08:50,797 --> 01:08:52,132
All my life.

749
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:55,677
I don´t want to be scared anymore.

750
01:08:58,347 --> 01:08:59,681
l´m going back in.

751
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:04,853
This time I will kill lt.

752
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:06,813
Help me!

753
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:08,690
Help me!

754
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:14,196
Please, help me.

755
01:10:19,219 --> 01:10:23,140
Did anyone think to bring something
useful, like a machine gun?

756
01:10:23,223 --> 01:10:25,642
I brought this.
It´s all I saved from those days.

757
01:10:26,101 --> 01:10:28,604
- You were a dead shot.
- You couldn´t miss.

758
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:31,106
It was like it was supposed to be Bev,
remember?

759
01:10:31,148 --> 01:10:33,442
You hit Pennywise in the head
and broke it open.

760
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:35,777
- And underneath it was a light.
- Bright light.

761
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:37,863
Deadlights.
We saw them, too, for a second.

762
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:39,031
Bev?

763
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:42,201
- Bill, how on earth...
- Mike went down and got them.

764
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,829
These are for him and Stan.

765
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,000
- Lucky seven.
- We´re all here now.

766
01:10:51,585 --> 01:10:55,589
What the hell are you going to do now?
Sing Kumbaya?

767
01:10:56,215 --> 01:10:59,885
Wake up. Take a breath.
Do you smell that?

768
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:04,139
That´s death.
It´s not for Mike or Stan or Henry Bowers.

769
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:06,099
It´s for us and it´s in the air.

770
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:09,978
Losers fight lt, losers die.
And you know that, don´t you, captain?

771
01:11:10,646 --> 01:11:13,565
- You don´t have to go down, Richie.
- Right.

772
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:17,861
I didn´t have to get on a plane,
go to dinner or come here.

773
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:19,613
Now I don´t have to go in.

774
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:28,622
I still say we should have brought
a machine gun.

775
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:40,694
The first thing I saw here
was one of those damn pom-poms.

776
01:12:46,742 --> 01:12:50,954
- This purse looks new.
- Oh, dear God. It´s not possible.

777
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,165
- Audra.
- What?

778
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,791
What in God´s name?

779
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:57,961
She´s down here. It´s got her.

780
01:13:00,172 --> 01:13:01,507
Wait, damn it!

781
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:02,674
Audra!

782
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:19,399
Audra. Audra.

783
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:21,443
Bill, come back, Bill!

784
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:25,531
- Do you want to get killed?
- Oh, god, Bill!

785
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:27,449
God, Bill, you all right?

786
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:31,745
It´s my fault. She followed me.

787
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:35,290
- I told her...
- Bill, that´s enough!

788
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:37,918
If she´s here there´s only one way
you can help her.

789
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:41,755
You know why we´re here
and we´re going to do it.

790
01:13:41,797 --> 01:13:45,634
We need you to stand up for us like before.

791
01:13:45,676 --> 01:13:48,011
Or none of us will get out of here.

792
01:13:59,064 --> 01:14:00,065
Come on.

793
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:07,656
Stay close together.

794
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:28,802
- Looks like we´re off the map.
- I think...

795
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:31,847
That way.

796
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:09,718
We´re here.

797
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,306
- The roots all grow down.
- Yeah.

798
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:17,226
- Remember the walls cracked.
- When It came.

799
01:15:17,309 --> 01:15:20,062
Dear God, please don´t let these things
come to life.

800
01:15:20,103 --> 01:15:24,274
- Don´t think that, spaghetti man.
- Don´t call me "spaghetti man."

801
01:15:24,358 --> 01:15:26,860
I think something´s coming.

802
01:16:04,147 --> 01:16:06,066
- My boat.
- Georgie.

803
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:08,527
It´s all your fault.

804
01:16:09,653 --> 01:16:10,654
Oh, Georgie.

805
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:14,741
It´s all your fault.
You sent me out and It killed me.

806
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:19,371
No. No, Georgie. I didn´t know.

807
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:22,833
Remember that´s not Georgie. Fight it.

808
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,169
It was in the drain.

809
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:28,088
It was in the drain. And you let It kill me.

810
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:31,341
Oh, no. I loved you.

811
01:16:31,508 --> 01:16:35,012
- Damn it, that thing is not your brother.
- Come on, man, fight it.

812
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:38,432
You are...

813
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:40,309
...not George.

814
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:44,146
George is dead...

815
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:46,815
...and it´s not my fault.

816
01:16:55,365 --> 01:16:57,951
You killed my brother, George,
you bastard.

817
01:16:58,368 --> 01:16:59,912
Let´s see you now.

818
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,123
Let´s see you now.

819
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:05,542
Show yourself.

820
01:17:10,589 --> 01:17:12,591
You killed my little brother...

821
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:15,802
...and now you´re going to pay.

822
01:17:21,683 --> 01:17:25,145
Go while you still can.

823
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:29,775
This is your last chance.

824
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,735
Show yourself.

825
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:36,198
Silly boy.

826
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:40,494
You still think you can see me.

827
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:44,373
You´ll never see me.

828
01:17:44,498 --> 01:17:48,168
You see only
what your little mind can allow.

829
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:50,838
Go now!

830
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:52,589
For if you stay...

831
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,926
...you´ll lose your little mind...

832
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:59,263
...in my deadlights.

833
01:18:00,097 --> 01:18:01,515
Like all the others.

834
01:18:02,474 --> 01:18:04,601
Like all the others.

835
01:18:24,162 --> 01:18:29,084
Bill. We can´t fight that thing.
That´s like trying to fight smoke.

836
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:31,962
Don´t you understand
what Mike was telling us?

837
01:18:32,504 --> 01:18:34,339
It feeds, Richie.

838
01:18:34,756 --> 01:18:37,843
It wakes up every 30 years and it feeds.

839
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:42,848
In order to feed it has
to take on some kind of physical form.

840
01:18:44,349 --> 01:18:45,684
It´s here.

841
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:49,104
Down here. Somewhere.

842
01:20:01,093 --> 01:20:03,053
- Are we strong enough?
- We have to be.

843
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:05,472
I have to tell you something
before we go in there.

844
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:07,307
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

845
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:10,894
- l´ve been lying.
- About what?

846
01:20:11,562 --> 01:20:13,730
When I said I was seeing someone.

847
01:20:14,523 --> 01:20:17,651
l´m not. I haven´t ever...

848
01:20:19,111 --> 01:20:21,405
...I mean l´ve never even been with anyone.

849
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,950
- Are you saying you´re a virgin?
- Yeah.

850
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:28,996
I can´t help you, but thanks for sharing.

851
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:30,539
Let him talk.

852
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:33,917
You see...

853
01:20:34,668 --> 01:20:37,963
...I could never sleep with someone
I didn´t love.

854
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:40,841
l´ve never really loved anyone.

855
01:20:43,427 --> 01:20:44,761
Except you guys.

856
01:22:06,552 --> 01:22:07,594
Audra.

857
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:10,556
- For God´s sake!
- Wait for us, buddy.

858
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,599
It´s Audra. l´m going to get her.

859
01:22:49,011 --> 01:22:50,345
Damn you to hell.

860
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:01,690
Please, dear God!

861
01:23:03,567 --> 01:23:07,863
"He thrusts his fists against the posts...

862
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:12,993
"...and still insists he sees the ghosts."

863
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:34,765
It´s taking him. Bill!

864
01:23:39,853 --> 01:23:42,523
Come on, guys! We got to...

865
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,820
Where are you going?

866
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:55,827
What am I going to do?

867
01:23:57,329 --> 01:23:59,540
This is battery acid.

868
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:16,223
I believe in Santa Claus
and the Easter Bunny.

869
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:22,145
I believe in the Tooth Fairy,
but I don´t believe in you.

870
01:24:23,522 --> 01:24:26,859
This is battery acid. Now you disappear.

871
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:47,629
Please God, don´t let me miss again.

872
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:18,410
Eddie! Eddie!

873
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:24,708
Nice shot.

874
01:25:25,042 --> 01:25:28,378
Don´t you talk! Don´t talk!
You´ll be fine, spaghetti man.

875
01:25:29,588 --> 01:25:31,048
Richie, please.

876
01:25:31,381 --> 01:25:34,343
For the last time, don´t call me that.

877
01:25:36,845 --> 01:25:38,472
You know how I...

878
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:43,977
Eddie!

879
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:48,982
Eddie.

880
01:26:04,873 --> 01:26:06,208
This isn´t over.

881
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:09,378
If that thing comes back when l´m 70...

882
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:11,421
- Let´s finish lt.
- Once and for all.

883
01:27:21,241 --> 01:27:22,242
Audra.

884
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:37,257
It´s all coming down.

885
01:28:21,885 --> 01:28:25,347
That´s how l´d like to remember us,
if I could remember us.

886
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:28,767
Standing there by the lake
with the sun going down on our childhood.

887
01:28:29,268 --> 01:28:32,271
This is my last entry. Just in time.

888
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:36,149
Just before the fog of my brains
swept all my memories away entirely.

889
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:41,947
Just weeks later, I look back on that time...

890
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:45,909
...not from memory, but from the pages
of this book. The nightmare is over.

891
01:28:45,993 --> 01:28:48,996
Police involvement was brief and cursory.

892
01:28:49,121 --> 01:28:51,248
As is always the case here in Derry.

893
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:54,918
With no further need
for a lighthouse keeper...

894
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:58,380
...I feel I may move on
down the road a piece.

895
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:03,302
Richie´s still knocking them dead.
He has a part in a movie.

896
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,555
574. Take 18, mark.

897
01:29:06,722 --> 01:29:10,559
He costars with another comic,
a guy any of us would have told you...

898
01:29:10,601 --> 01:29:12,603
...looks and acts like Eddie Kaspbrak.

899
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:17,065
And cut.

900
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:20,944
Ben and Bev left Derry together.
Headed west.

901
01:29:21,195 --> 01:29:24,531
In a week they were married,
a few weeks later they were pregnant.

902
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,158
Another curse broken.

903
01:29:32,873 --> 01:29:35,959
Bill and Audra are still here.
I wish the news were better.

904
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:39,546
Audra´s condition is unchanged.
They´re leaving today.

905
01:29:41,757 --> 01:29:44,092
Hey, Audra. It´s time to go.

906
01:29:44,343 --> 01:29:47,346
Bill thought the time away from work
might help.

907
01:29:47,971 --> 01:29:51,850
But I guess Audra´s gone for good.
One of lt´s many casualties.

908
01:29:52,351 --> 01:29:55,354
Locked in that haunted place
where she saw its deadlights.

909
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:59,483
Bill has been visiting me every day.
We laugh about our failing memories.

910
01:29:59,983 --> 01:30:02,486
Sometimes we have to ask
each other´s names now.

911
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:06,490
His sadness is profound. I wish there was
something I could do.

912
01:30:06,907 --> 01:30:08,909
Something I could have done.

913
01:30:16,834 --> 01:30:19,837
Hi yo, Silver. Away!

914
01:30:20,796 --> 01:30:21,839
Wait.

915
01:30:25,634 --> 01:30:29,721
This bike saved Stan´s life once. Mine, too.

916
01:30:30,305 --> 01:30:32,975
We went so fast I think we beat the devil.

917
01:30:33,642 --> 01:30:35,602
I don´t know if I could go that fast again.

918
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:37,521
Hold on.

919
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:55,497
Beat lt. Beat lt, Audra.

920
01:30:56,164 --> 01:30:57,708
Beat lt. Beat lt.

921
01:31:06,633 --> 01:31:07,843
Come on.

922
01:31:23,192 --> 01:31:24,234
- Bill?
- Yes.

923
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:27,571
- What are we doing?
- It´s all right. Hang on.

924
01:31:28,071 --> 01:31:29,573
Hang on, it´s okay.
