1
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:53,071
"The itsy bitsy spider

2
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:56,450
"Climbed up the water spout

3
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,494
"Down came the rain

4
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,539
"And washed the spider out

5
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,667
"Up came the sun

6
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,545
"And it dried up all the rain

7
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,341
"And the itsy bitsy spider

8
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,552
"Went up the spout again"

9
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,681
Come on, Laurie Ann. It´s going to storm.

10
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,376
Hi.

11
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,436
Laurie Ann?

12
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,569
Honey? Don´t scare Momma.

13
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,793
Excuse me. Move along.

14
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,978
Chief´s going to have a cow
when he sees you nosing around.

15
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,606
I won´t tell him if you don´t.
What have you got?

16
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,066
There´s not much left.
Just like the last time.

17
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,777
- Did anyone see anything?
- The mother said she saw...

18
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,362
I told you to stay out of this.

19
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,364
l´m just a concerned citizen, Chief.

20
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,951
I call six kids missing or dead
a major cause for alarm.

21
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,412
It may be a rash of runaways.
Kids get itchy feet.

22
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,081
Right. A five-year-old in a toy car
gets itchy feet.

23
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,959
A seven-year-old goes to Acapulco
for a wild weekend?

24
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,545
The boy´s father took him.
The other one...

25
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,925
Chief, there´s something terribly wrong
here in Derry. And you know it.

26
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,970
l´m the cop. You´re the librarian.

27
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,472
Okay?

28
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,704
Georgie.

29
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,003
May 28th.

30
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,964
Another killing today.

31
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,468
But this time there was something more.
Something that makes my skin crawl.

32
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,514
A picture that shouldn´t...
That couldn´t have been there.

33
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,684
It´s time to tell the others
what´s happening.

34
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,519
I can´t put it off any longer.

35
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,563
But I hope l´m wrong.

36
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,190
I hope to God l´m wrong.

37
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,043
Taggert steps onto the moors as the
fog curls around his ankles.

38
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,505
He shivers, buttons his coat,
and walks on into the mist.

39
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:43,343
A shadowy figure lurches into frame,
dripping with foul water and dark mud.

40
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,220
Yeah.

41
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,892
Bill, for the last time...

42
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,226
In a minute!

43
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,562
You said that half an hour ago.

44
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,231
- And a half an hour before that.
- Okay!

45
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,906
- It´s cold.
- Sorry.

46
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,159
I like the changes. They´re wonderful.

47
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,913
- I wish you´d tell that idiot, Greco.
- I do. Every day.

48
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:15,501
You didn´t have to take this job.
We don´t need the money.

49
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,420
In case you´ve forgotten,
I took the job to be with you.

50
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,881
If someone
is going to mangle my books...

51
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,966
...it may as well be me.

52
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,969
The idea of taking a vacation
didn´t even occur...

53
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:30,474
So I could hang around the set?
That´s not what I do. Writing is what I do.

54
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,435
At least when you´re doing a novel,
you´re in a good mood.

55
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,562
Audra, could we...

56
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,608
l´m asleep unless it´s Greco.

57
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,568
Greco.

58
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,612
Greco.

59
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:46,490
Yeah?

60
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,618
- Bill, is that you?
- Do I know you?

61
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,204
This is Mike Hanlon, from Derry.

62
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,541
Swear to me.

63
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,252
Swear to me that if it isn´t dead...

64
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,130
...we´ll all come back.

65
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,804
- Sorry, Mike, for a minute there...
- You didn´t know who I was.

66
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,431
For a minute, I didn´t.

67
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,141
Bill...

68
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,686
...it´s back.

69
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,981
You sure?

70
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,652
Yeah. I found a photograph of George.

71
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,905
George?

72
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,122
What is it?

73
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,332
Who was on the phone?

74
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,170
Nobody. Wrong number.

75
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:43,839
Bill?

76
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,551
I have to go back to work.

77
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:49,970
Bill?

78
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,602
Georgie.

79
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,629
Please, Bill. Tell me a story.

80
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,089
Maybe later.

81
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,091
The magic stone story.

82
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,719
Please, Bill. Please.

83
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:35,224
Go bug somebody else, you little cootie.
I don´t feel so hot.

84
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,309
Georgie?

85
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,774
For me? You made it for me?

86
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,193
Can I go sail it?

87
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:51,365
You have to seal it first with paraffin.

88
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,619
- What´s that? Where is it?
- In the cellar.

89
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,366
I wish you could come, too.
She´s your boat, really.

90
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,576
Thanks, Bill.

91
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,455
You got cooties all over me.

92
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,004
Georgie.

93
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,132
Don´t stay out too long
or Mom will have a bird.

94
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,302
- I won´t.
- Georgie!

95
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,141
Be careful.

96
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,727
Sure. I will.

97
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,319
S. S. Georgie!

98
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,449
Come on!

99
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,717
S. S. Georgie, out of the way!

100
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,189
No, please, no!

101
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,283
Hi, Georgie.

102
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,872
Aren´t you going to say hello?

103
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,169
Come on, bucko.

104
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,047
Don´t you want a balloon?

105
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,969
l´m not supposed to take stuff
from strangers.

106
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,595
My dad said so.

107
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:22,349
Very wise of your dad. Very wise indeed.

108
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,688
I am Pennywise, the Dancing Clown.

109
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,732
You are Georgie.

110
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,235
Now we know each other.

111
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,028
Correct?

112
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,947
I guess so.

113
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,116
- l´ve got to go.
- Go?

114
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,159
Without this?

115
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,997
- My boat!
- Exactly.

116
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,417
Go on, kiddo. Take it.

117
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,674
You want it, don´t you, Georgie?

118
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,718
Of course you do.

119
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,764
There´s cotton candy and rides
and all sorts of surprises down here.

120
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,934
And balloons, too. In all colors.

121
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,313
- Do they float?
- Yes.

122
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,775
They float, Georgie.

123
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,652
They float.

124
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:21,116
And when you´re here with me...

125
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,328
...you float, too.

126
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,836
"Fear no evil for thou art with me,
thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

127
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,049
"Thou preparest a table before me in
the presence of mine enemies.

128
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:41,220
"Thou annointest my head with oil,
my cup runneth over.

129
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,973
"Goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life.

130
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:48,894
"I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."

131
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,143
Georgie.

132
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:54,543
Billy?

133
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:57,921
- Are you all right?
- What is it?

134
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,465
The picture. Georgie´s picture.

135
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,970
Mom, don´t you see?

136
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:12,769
- What were you doing in Georgie´s room?
- Nothing.

137
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:17,399
- Dad, listen!
- Never come in here again. Understand?

138
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,361
I mean it, Bill.

139
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,767
I forgot.

140
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:54,478
How could I forget?

141
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,816
Leave? Have you lost your mind?
We´re in the middle of making a movie.

142
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,986
They can replace me.
This is something I have to do.

143
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,074
Who was on the phone?

144
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,246
The call was from a guy
named Mike Hanlon.

145
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,916
I haven´t heard from him in 30 years.
Not since we were kids.

146
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,337
- Audra. My brother, who died...
- Yes, George.

147
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,756
He didn´t just die.

148
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,676
He was murdered.

149
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,178
- Why didn´t you ever...
- Tell you?

150
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,808
Because I forgot. As if it never happened.

151
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,185
I know it doesn´t make sense,
but I have to go.

152
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,603
For God´s sake, why?

153
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,314
Because we made a promise.

154
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:42,901
- Why are you stuttering?
- I used to stutter when I was a kid.

155
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,529
What happened? Tell me.

156
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,740
Damn it, Bill, talk to me! Let me help.

157
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,203
- lf you´re going back, l´m going too.
- Don´t even think that!

158
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,123
- Why not? You´re scaring me.
- Promise me you´ll stay here.

159
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,791
- Promise me!
- You´re crazy.

160
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,836
This is crazy.

161
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,383
I love you.

162
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,465
Oh no, Ben.

163
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,260
Your architect award.
And you just received it. It´s a tragedy.

164
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,639
Yeah, honey.
We´ve got ourselves a real tragedy here.

165
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,974
This is an American tragedy.

166
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,561
Look at this. Would you hang on to this?

167
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,522
I got this and this.

168
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,819
Here you are, my good man. Recycle.

169
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:10,781
Come on.

170
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,034
Go on, honey.

171
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,579
Limbo! How low can you go?

172
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,548
You don´t have to be quiet.

173
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,300
- Is all this yours?
- Yes. Come on in.

174
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,386
Let me see what I can do with this.

175
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:59,204
Come here, beautiful. Come on.

176
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,256
- I love your body.
- I like yours, too.

177
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,759
- Would you believe I used to be fat?
- I bet you were real cute.

178
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,137
Not just fat, a regular butterball.

179
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,348
You bet your fern I was.
We used to say that as kids.

180
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,019
You bet your fern, but I was F-A-T.

181
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,812
- No.
- Yeah.

182
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:31,445
I hear bells. l´ll be right back.

183
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,158
Hello?

184
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,076
Haystack, it´s me, Mike.

185
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:41,997
It´s payback time, piggy.

186
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,544
Hey, fat boy!

187
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:52,174
Ben?

188
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,051
Are you there?

189
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,846
- Mike?
- Yeah, buddy. Listen:

190
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,517
It´s come back.

191
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,395
How much do you remember?

192
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,815
How much do you remember?

193
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:14,404
Very little. Almost nothing.

194
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,406
Will you come?

195
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:19,910
l´ll come.

196
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,221
Are you okay?

197
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,600
I don´t think I am, sweetheart.
Not tonight. Not at all.

198
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,687
Are you going to kill yourself?

199
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,941
I don´t think so.
But it might be better if I did.

200
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,064
My name is Ben Hanscom.

201
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,694
Until last week,
I lived with my mom in Houston, Texas.

202
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,655
We moved here to live with my cousins.

203
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:39,948
Look at that gut.

204
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:44,745
Go on, Ben.

205
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,997
Do you have any hobbies?

206
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,498
I read a lot.

207
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:53,545
Especially about old civilizations,
like the Egyptians and Indians.

208
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,925
We have a wonderful library here.
Welcome to Derry.

209
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,219
Thank you, Miss Douglas.

210
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,065
What a porker.

211
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,984
Henry Bowers...

212
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:19,404
...you will stay for one hour after school
every day this week.

213
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,031
My father will tan my hide.

214
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,909
You should´ve thought of that
before you picked on Ben.

215
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,994
Report to the principal´s office.

216
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,627
You´re dead, fat boy.

217
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,555
It´s going to be some funeral, friend.

218
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,023
Now, class...

219
00:21:55,399 --> 00:22:00,112
...as you know, the Sheriff has instituted
a 7:00 pm curfew.

220
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:05,701
We live in dangerous times, boys and girls.
I want you to be careful.

221
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:16,170
Do you like the school so well
that you´re going to stand there all day?

222
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,296
School´s over, you know.

223
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,339
- Excuse us, please.
- Can we get through?

224
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:23,051
- Some people have no class.
- Some people have janitors for parents.

225
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,268
So long, Ben Hanscom.

226
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,478
l´m Beverly Marsh.

227
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,776
See you tomorrow, Beverly Marsh.

228
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:52,831
- Look, it´s the fat boy.
- Top of the day, fat boy.

229
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,551
- What do you want?
- I want to teach you something, porky.

230
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,845
You like to learn new things, don´t you?

231
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,432
I want to make sure
you remember my name.

232
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,100
l´ll remember. Henry.

233
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:13,894
How can I be sure?

234
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:22,819
Don´t really cut him.

235
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,363
Cut him?

236
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,323
Cut him?

237
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,993
Let´s see, first comes...

238
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,078
Oh, God!

239
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,959
You´re going to die! l´ll bury you!

240
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,627
You´re going to die!

241
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,059
- Nobody kicks me! Nobody!
- You better run, boy.

242
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,228
You´re going to die, man!

243
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,314
Get him! You´re dead, you fat pig!

244
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,827
- What´s this?
- Looks like a geek wading pool to me.

245
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,793
What are you two girls doing here?

246
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:23,255
Look at the stupid little baby dam.

247
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,054
You don´t have to do that.
Why did you do that?

248
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,848
I felt like it. Give me that.

249
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:36,435
- That´s for my asthma.
- Is that a fact? Sissy.

250
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,648
- Leave him alone.
- Shut up, creep.

251
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:50,282
Stop that or l´ll pull your ears down
and tie them underneath your chin.

252
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:52,534
Did you see a fat kid run by here?

253
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,745
- Big, fat kid, all messed up.
- No.

254
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:58,373
You sure, mush-mouth?
You better be sure.

255
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,666
l´m sure.

256
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:01,835
Let´s go.

257
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,423
Ta-ta, girls.

258
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,143
It´s empty.

259
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:24,608
I can´t breathe.

260
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:27,903
Are they gone?

261
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:33,075
Yes. Can you stay here with my friend
while I get his medicine?

262
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:34,743
Yeah.

263
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,495
Let me take this.

264
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:39,456
Take it easy, kid. You´ll be okay.

265
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,459
- You´ll be okay.
- Yeah?

266
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,046
What will we do if they come back?

267
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:53,470
Want some?

268
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:01,937
- My dad died of the big "C".
- Big "C"?

269
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,606
Cancer. I was just a little kid.

270
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,776
My dad died, too.
He was shot down in Korea.

271
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:12,614
- Do you remember him much?
- Sort of, I think.

272
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,451
- Who´s the other guy?
- Bill?

273
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:20,497
Bill´s my best friend. He´s a great guy.

274
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:22,624
Hey!

275
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,209
l´m...

276
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:25,961
...back.

277
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:31,008
- Does he always stutter so much?
- It´s worse since his brother died.

278
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:35,304
Some guy killed George.
His arm was pulled off like a wing off a fly.

279
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,723
- That´s awful.
- I told you because...

280
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:41,226
...lf you want Bill to be your friend,
don´t talk to him about George.

281
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,188
- He´s all messed up about it.
- I would be, too.

282
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:48,150
- Would be too, what?
- Nothing. Thanks.

283
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,402
Thanks for staying.

284
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:55,240
He´s really got it bad. l´m scared he´s
going into a coma like on Dr. Kildare.

285
00:26:55,741 --> 00:27:00,412
- Me, too. You´re Ben.
- And you´re Bill.

286
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:05,209
- This is...
- Eddie. He knows.

287
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:09,171
I hate it when you stutter my name.
You sound like Elmer Fudd.

288
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:13,675
No, Elmer Fudd has a lisp.
Porky Pig stutters.

289
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:15,385
Okay.

290
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:17,679
Why don´t you come back tomorrow?

291
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:21,517
Me and Eddie, we´re trying to make a dam.

292
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,104
You´ve got to have some boards,
and put them in a row, facing each other.

293
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:29,024
Like the bread of a sandwich...

294
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:33,654
- But we do it.
- Yeah, we.

295
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:57,302
- What are you doing?
- Something for school.

296
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,264
- A poem.
- That´s private.

297
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:02,140
"Your hair is winter fire.

298
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,226
"January embers."

299
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:06,603
Hey, Mom, Benny´s in love!

300
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,813
Give this back.

301
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,650
- Mom! Mom!
- Stop that! Benjamin!

302
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:15,237
Stop that immediately, you ruffian.

303
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:16,738
I hate you!

304
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:19,908
You´re only here because
Mom says it´s our Christian duty.

305
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,958
Nobody´s ever going to say
a sister of mine is on welfare.

306
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,252
So you´re welcome
as long as you need to stay.

307
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:34,423
But you´re spoiling the boy, Arlene.
He needs a firm hand, discipline.

308
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,188
We´ll have our own home one day.
I promise.

309
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:50,689
I know, Mama.

310
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,193
As long as we´re guests,
I need you to help me.

311
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:57,988
They wouldn´t treat us like this
if Daddy were still alive.

312
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,781
Come on inside and apologize.

313
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,991
But he was...

314
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:04,786
- You must!
- No! I hate it here.

315
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,788
Come on, Benny.

316
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,958
Benny!

317
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:33,065
Ben! Benny! Up here, Ben.

318
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,025
Daddy?

319
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:41,198
Ben!

320
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:46,787
Hi, Ben.

321
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:53,585
Daddy?

322
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:56,922
That´s my home now, son.

323
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:01,260
Do you want a balloon?

324
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,388
They float.

325
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:06,640
They all float.

326
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:10,477
Come here, son. You´ll like it down there.

327
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,521
You never have to grow up.

328
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,747
They float.

329
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:33,041
They all float.

330
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,377
When you´re down here with me...

331
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:39,965
...fat boy, you´ll float, too.

332
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,355
Please, stop.

333
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:03,697
Beverly By Hand. One moment please.

334
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:08,911
Miss Marsh´s office.

335
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,455
Hold a moment, please.

336
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:21,048
Someone calling from Maine,
says it´s important.

337
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:21,882
Maine?

338
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:25,135
- Pam, I said no calls until...
- We´ve got a minute. l´ll take it.

339
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:28,138
No. Get their number and close the door.

340
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,321
Your hands are shaking.

341
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:46,281
l´m scared to death.

342
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:50,410
That stuff spreads like cancer.
I won´t have it around.

343
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:54,790
There. That´s perfect. Don´t touch it.

344
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,417
Listen to me, Bevy.

345
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:01,547
We have some well-heeled
Japanese gentlemen waiting downstairs.

346
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:06,134
We´ll show them around. You´ll play
the charming flamboyant designer.

347
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:10,305
We´ll make a deal, l´ll play hardball,
and when it´s over, we´ll be rich.

348
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:14,685
If you get a hold of yourself right now.
Do you understand?

349
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:17,771
A kiss for good luck?

350
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:25,654
Okay, let´s go.

351
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:29,449
And don´t ever contradict me
in front of Pam again.

352
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,142
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
l´m Beverly Marsh.

353
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,269
This is my partner, Tom Grogan.

354
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,891
- Hello?
- Beverly, it´s Mike Hanlon.

355
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,977
- Who?
- Mike Hanlon. Remember me?

356
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:42,981
Mike Hanlon. Of course. How are you?

357
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,733
Fine. Are you sitting down?

358
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,616
There you are.

359
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,341
Who was on the phone?

360
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:21,770
You may think this is crazy,
I certainly think it´s crazy...

361
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:23,564
...but I have to go to Maine.

362
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:25,899
It´s hard to explain.

363
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:29,653
That was Mike Hanlon on the phone.
Remember he called at work today?

364
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,613
He´s an old, dear friend. I have to...

365
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:34,408
Shut up! You have to shut up!

366
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:38,787
I make the deal of a lifetime and
you run off to an old boyfriend in Maine?

367
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,956
What do you take me for?

368
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:43,792
l´ve seen this coming.

369
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:47,546
You´ve forgotten your manners, little girl.

370
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:50,924
Contradicting me,
smarting off, and now this.

371
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,637
You´ve forgotten your lessons.

372
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:58,724
It´s been too long since last time.

373
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:00,893
Put that thing down.

374
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,645
I have to get to O´Hare as fast as I can.

375
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:08,317
There´s some very bad trouble.

376
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:13,280
It´s come back, Beverly.
Remember your promise.

377
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:15,073
Put these clothes back.

378
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:17,492
- Get into bed!
- No!

379
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:21,955
Then maybe you can leave this house
in two days, instead of two weeks.

380
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:25,375
Not ever again!

381
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:39,515
If you ever come near me again,
l´ll kill you.

382
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:42,935
Do you understand? I will kill you.

383
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:46,980
Bev, you need me!

384
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:48,565
Bev!

385
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,081
O´Hare, please.

386
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,832
What airline, miss?

387
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:11,088
I need to go to Maine.

388
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:15,717
We´ll find one that goes to Maine.
What´s in Maine, your family?

389
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,262
Friends.

390
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:20,889
The best l´ve ever had.

391
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,392
Daddy, breakfast is ready.

392
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,395
l´ll get it.

393
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:52,087
"Your hair is winter fire.

394
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:54,756
"January embers.

395
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,885
"My heart burns there, too."

396
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,761
Who was at the door?

397
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,972
- What do you got there?
- Nothing.

398
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:03,265
Let me see that.

399
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:09,104
You been doing something you shouldn´t?

400
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:12,691
Are you fooling around with some boy?
Poetry from some boy?

401
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,696
I worry a lot about you.

402
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,574
- Sometimes, I worry a lot.
- Daddy, please.

403
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:24,203
Not even 12 years old
and already seeing some boy.

404
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:26,538
Let me alone!

405
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:27,623
Come here!

406
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:31,877
Don´t make me come and collect you.
Come to me.

407
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:33,045
No.

408
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:36,048
- What did you say?
- I said, "No! "

409
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,013
You get the hell back in here!

410
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:46,517
l´ll whip the skin off of you!

411
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:08,497
Sorry if I scared you. Are you okay?

412
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,082
Yeah.

413
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:18,674
Don´t you have anything better to do
than sneak up on people?

414
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,971
- Sorry.
- You should be.

415
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:28,016
I was thinking, it being Saturday and all...

416
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:32,187
...if you didn´t have anything to do,
you could come with me to the barrens.

417
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,815
The barrens?

418
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,776
This is Eddie...

419
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,903
...and this is Bill.

420
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:43,365
Hi.

421
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:46,493
Hi.

422
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:50,831
Do you guys know each other already?

423
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:58,005
Bev wants to help.
I hope that´s okay. She´s a girl.

424
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,549
Sure.

425
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:04,636
What´s this? By George, Martha...

426
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,513
...it´s the river Nile.

427
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:09,558
And four, count them, four sphinxes.

428
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,185
Richie.

429
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:13,020
You were expecting Gunga Din?

430
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:16,356
Richie´s okay,
but he can drive you to the bughouse.

431
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:20,402
- I heard that, you skirt.
- Hi, Eddie Spaghetti.

432
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:24,907
I hate it when you do that.
Don´t call me "Eddie Spaghetti."

433
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,743
You love it.
It makes you so chuck-a-licious.

434
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,162
Richie Tozier´s my name.

435
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:34,583
And doing voices is my game.
This is Stan the Man Uris.

436
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:38,003
Stanley´s a Jew, which means
he´s really smart and says oy a lot.

437
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:41,256
Richie has a high metabolism,
which tends to make him hyperactive.

438
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:44,801
So you, Haystack,
are you building a dam or something?

439
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,554
- Ever built one before?
- No.

440
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:49,431
How do you know it´ll work?

441
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:51,850
- Why wouldn´t it?
- How do you know?

442
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:52,976
I just know.

443
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:54,436
Yeah, he just knows.

444
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,481
Well, okay.

445
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:29,471
- You´re a genius, Haystack.
- It´s nothing.

446
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,432
It´s great. We stopped it. That´s so cool.

447
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:35,853
We could flood out
the whole barrens if we wanted to.

448
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,021
We did it! We!

449
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,482
Yeah!

450
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,447
l´ll go this way.

451
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,743
- See you later, alligator.
- After a while, crocodile.

452
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:56,665
- See you, Ben.
- Yeah, see you, Bill.

453
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,502
Hi yo, Silver. Away!

454
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,673
See you, Beverly.

455
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:06,008
See you.

456
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:18,520
"My heart burns there, too."

457
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:32,951
77 Sunset Strip will continue
following station identification.

458
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,209
Help me.

459
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,712
Help me, please.

460
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,132
Help me.

461
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,762
- Help me, Beverly.
- Hello?

462
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,932
Is someone there?

463
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:58,852
The clown brought us down here.
We all float.

464
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:00,145
Who are you?

465
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:03,524
- l´m Vickie Burrows.
- l´m Matthew O´Connor.

466
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:06,360
We´re all the dead kids.

467
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:13,700
Come closer, Beverly.
We all want to meet you. We float.

468
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,209
Daddy!

469
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:26,713
- What in the name of heaven?
- The bathroom!

470
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:30,133
- Was someone peeping in at you, girl?
- In the sink!

471
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:37,683
What do you think you saw?
Speak up, girl.

472
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:41,019
I worry about you, Bevy.

473
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:42,855
I worry a lot.

474
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:45,482
Explain yourself.

475
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:50,028
There was this spider. A big, fat spider.

476
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:53,532
He crawled out of the drain,
and I guess, it crawled back down.

477
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:58,620
These buildings are old,
with drains the size of the Holland tunnel.

478
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:00,622
There´s nothing there now.

479
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:06,253
Get to bed.

480
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:12,926
Say hello to your friends, Beverly.

481
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:17,472
You´ll die if you try to fight us.

482
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:21,643
You´ll die, if you try.

483
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,814
You´ll die if you try to fight us, Beverly.

484
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:32,362
You´ll die, if you try.

485
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:57,679
Eddie, where are you?

486
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:00,474
Eddie?

487
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:07,314
- Eddie, where are you?
- l´m in here, Ma.

488
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:18,408
Where are you going?

489
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:20,244
I have to go away for awhile.

490
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:22,704
Away? Where?

491
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:26,542
This isn´t like you.
Tell me where you´re going.

492
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,001
Eddie, stop!

493
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:31,463
You´re in trouble, aren´t you?

494
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:33,090
Eddie?

495
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:37,427
Tell me who was on the phone.
Answer me.

496
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:38,679
Answer me.

497
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:41,890
Mom, please don´t cry.

498
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:45,227
You´re scaring me so bad,
you´ve got to tell me.

499
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:53,193
- Where are you going?
- I have to go back to Derry.

500
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,281
Why would you want to go back
to that dirty little town?

501
00:44:57,406 --> 00:45:00,367
There´s nothing for you there.
There never was, Eddie.

502
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:04,580
Please, Ma. Please.

503
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:08,417
Eddie!

504
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:12,963
Let´s get out of here.

505
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:14,923
- What´s going on?
- Nothing.

506
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:17,843
- You look like you saw a ghost.
- Move it!

507
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,345
Eddie!

508
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:29,938
l´m sorry to leave you holding the bag.

509
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:32,858
- Do we have enough drivers for next week?
- It´s covered.

510
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:37,362
I want you to do the Pacino job.
He likes the Lincoln stretch.

511
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,865
I know, Eddie.
The business is under control.

512
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:43,911
- It´s you l´m worried about.
- l´m fine.

513
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:45,704
Where are we going?

514
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,458
Penn Station. The 1 1:30 pm to Boston.

515
00:46:58,068 --> 00:46:59,111
They saw me.

516
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:02,739
- We better go.
- l´m a dead man.

517
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:05,576
If I were you,
I wouldn´t pay to see a monster movie...

518
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:07,661
...l´d just look in a mirror.

519
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:22,342
Let´s get out of here!

520
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:23,719
Yeah, let´s go!

521
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:28,557
- Did you see those guys?
- I saw you make it worse.

522
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,642
Come on, Eddie Spaghetti.

523
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:33,979
- It was just a joke.
- Sometimes you joke too much.

524
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:36,899
You have to or you´ll die of boredom.

525
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,360
- Are we men or are we mice?
- We´re mice!

526
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:42,446
Then let´s act like mice.

527
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:43,697
Look.

528
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:52,581
That place scares me green.
I think it´s haunted.

529
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,418
Honestly, Eddie,
such things aren´t empirically possible.

530
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,587
In English, it ain´t no such thing.

531
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:02,424
You´re a pretty swift guy for a girl,
my little chickadee.

532
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:06,470
Was that a compliment?
On our very first date?

533
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:10,015
Why is Richie so special?

534
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:12,935
The date wasn´t just with him, Eddie.
I love you, too.

535
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:30,285
Hey, don´t trip!

536
00:48:43,048 --> 00:48:46,844
- Eddie, it´s been great.
- See you later.

537
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:48,428
- See you later.
- ´Bye, Eddie.

538
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:55,352
I wish this summer would never end.
It´s the best summer of my whole life.

539
00:48:56,562 --> 00:48:58,313
Eddie Kaspbrak...

540
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:02,317
...I was worried sick.
I almost called the police.

541
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:04,820
- Eddie was with us.
- Go away.

542
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:06,697
Go home.

543
00:49:06,864 --> 00:49:08,490
Ma, these are my friends.

544
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,660
- See you tomorrow.
- Eddie has to rest tomorrow.

545
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:20,085
I don´t want you to play with them again.
No good will come of it.

546
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:24,089
- But they´re my friends.
- You don´t need any, except for your ma.

547
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:26,133
- You feel warm.
- l´m fine.

548
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:31,471
No showers with the other boys.
I don´t want you catching their germs.

549
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:36,852
Guys, quit that running,
this is a hallway not a track! Come on!

550
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:43,984
- Did you take a shower?
- No, sir.

551
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:47,154
l´ll explain this only one more time:

552
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:51,074
You take phys ed, you sweat,
you take a shower. Got it?

553
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:07,442
It´s okay, Eddie.

554
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:11,113
Hi. I just wanted to say hello.

555
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:15,784
Hot enough for you up there, is it?

556
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:22,124
This is a little inconvenient.

557
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:25,169
l´ll have to make a few adjustments.

558
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,009
Here I am, wheezy.

559
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:36,847
You´ll like it down here.

560
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:44,229
Won´t do any good to run, girly boy.

561
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:50,569
See you in your dreams.
Oh, come back anytime.

562
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:52,321
Bring your friends.

563
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:34,863
So I say, ´´Go ahead, make my day. ´´

564
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:38,742
The next thing you know
l´m feeling my way to the toilet.

565
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:43,497
How much power
does the electric company have?

566
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:44,873
Remember Godzilla?

567
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:47,668
A plane couldn´t stop him,
the atom bomb couldn´t...

568
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:50,128
...even Nancy Reagan couldn´t stop him.

569
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:53,173
But you get him in front of
one high power line...

570
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,845
Look! The creature is attacking the city.

571
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:12,693
You guys are great. Good night.

572
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,862
Hey, guys!

573
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:22,911
- You´re beautiful!
- That political material is getting old.

574
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:25,831
Who knows Betty Ford?
We´ve got to work on this.

575
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:28,625
Hold on, hold on!

576
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:34,047
There she is. How´s my favorite niece?

577
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:37,801
l´m so glad you made it. I want to see
Miller first thing Monday.

578
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:39,219
l´ve got it arranged.

579
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:43,098
If l´m hosting next week. I have to have
that new material. l´ve got...

580
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:45,434
l´ve got somebody you should meet.

581
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:47,144
- I can´t tell you...
- Hold on!

582
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:52,149
Buona sera. This is Richie Tozier.
Who´s this, Elvis?

583
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:53,233
Who?

584
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,905
Mike Hanlon, from Derry.
Do you remember?

585
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:02,117
Yeah. Sure I remember you, pal.

586
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:04,953
What about subbing for Carson
on Monday night?

587
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,456
Who´s going to sit behind the desk
and be funny?

588
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:09,833
- Let Leno do it, I don´t care.
- Richie!

589
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:12,753
- What am I going to tell them?
- Whatever you have to!

590
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:14,796
I need a couple of days.

591
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,923
For what?

592
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:18,967
The reunion of your Cub Scout pack
at Grover´s Corners?

593
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:20,344
Come on, what is it?

594
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:25,307
A broad? The mob?

595
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:28,060
I don´t know what it is.

596
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:31,313
Don´t insult my intelligence.

597
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:33,232
I made a promise.

598
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:35,484
We´ve been through a lot together.

599
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:51,416
You´re fine. You can handle this.

600
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:56,839
No. This can´t be happening.

601
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:02,678
Help!

602
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:05,931
Help! Help!

603
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:21,363
They felt its hot and horrible breath
against their faces.

604
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:25,075
But at that moment, they released
the stones and ran out of the cave.

605
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:29,162
Now they were home,
but nothing could change the way they felt.

606
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:31,498
They learned to be strong together.

607
00:55:31,707 --> 00:55:35,669
They beat the dragon with the magic
stones, and nothing would be the same.

608
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:40,716
Write that one down, Bill.
That´s my favorite.

609
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:43,218
- Really excellent.
- Beautiful.

610
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:47,764
Yeah, Bill´s going to leave
this one horse town, meet Sandra Dee...

611
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:50,017
...and the other babes in Hollywood.

612
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:54,021
Dream on, Richie.
I don´t want to grow up at all.

613
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,192
I do. I want to be a train conductor
and see the world.

614
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,153
If your mom will let you cross the street.

615
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:04,072
I want to be the first rock ´n´ roll singer
from Derry.

616
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:05,407
Or an impressionist.

617
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:08,994
- Your voices all sound the same.
- Thanks a bunch, professor.

618
00:56:09,286 --> 00:56:11,288
- How about you, Bev?
- A painter, maybe.

619
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:13,290
My dad´s teaching me to draw.

620
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:16,460
Fighter pilot. When l´m old enough,
l´ll join the Air Force.

621
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:20,756
An ornithologist. I like cataloguing things,
and finding their logical order.

622
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:22,591
Can I tell you guys something?

623
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:27,554
- lf you laugh, l´ll never...
- We won´t, will we?

624
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:36,104
The other night, in Georgie´s room...

625
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:38,649
What on earth? For the love of Mike!

626
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:41,944
Look at this mess. The saints preserve us.

627
00:56:47,324 --> 00:56:48,742
Officer Nell.

628
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:52,162
You´re fixing to back flood
all the drains in town.

629
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:55,958
- Whose brainstorm was this?
- I showed them how, it´s my fault.

630
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,835
It was my idea.

631
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,837
- Me, too.
- I was in on it, too.

632
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:03,507
- I suppose it was your idea too, lass?
- Yes.

633
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:06,385
Listen to me, all of you.
There´s been another murder.

634
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,388
- Little Velma Daniels.
- Velma Daniels?

635
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:12,140
Her body was found down by the canal.

636
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:15,435
If you come down here to play,
come together. Understand?

637
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:19,857
That means together, all the time.

638
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:23,485
Your hands on it?

639
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:36,832
So what did you think
Bill was going to tell us?

640
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:40,043
I don´t know. He´s been moody lately.

641
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:42,045
They all have.

642
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,882
With this food, who could blame them?

643
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:50,304
Well, hey.

644
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:52,890
- Larry, Curly and Moe.
- Richie!

645
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:55,559
All right, twerp. Who threw it?

646
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:57,853
You? It was you, wasn´t it?

647
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:02,316
Tell me. And you might live
through this, four-eyes.

648
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:05,027
In the Paramount theater, who did it?

649
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:29,718
Way to go, banana-heels.

650
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:35,599
Tozier!

651
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:37,851
Bowers!

652
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:45,484
Go downstairs and get a mop
from Mr. Marsh and clean this up!

653
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:47,903
Go on!

654
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:56,745
Mr. Marsh?

655
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:00,374
Mr. Marsh?

656
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:03,460
Just great.

657
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:07,923
Mr. Marsh, you down here?

658
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:11,260
Probably drunk as a skunk.

659
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:15,556
Mr. Marsh?

660
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,643
Mr. Marsh?

661
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:37,786
Mr. Marsh...

662
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:42,583
...I had a little accident in the cafeteria.

663
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:52,467
No, this isn´t happening.

664
00:59:58,807 --> 00:59:59,766
No!

665
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:02,561
Help!

666
01:00:12,196 --> 01:00:13,655
Beep, beep, Richie!

667
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:16,909
Come back, anytime!

668
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:23,081
l´ll show you how to float down here.

669
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,461
They all float down here.

670
01:00:35,344 --> 01:00:37,804
You´ve got to help me. Somebody, please.

671
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:41,183
In the basement, there´s a werewolf.

672
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,174
Stop him.

673
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:38,490
The day I took that photo
was one of the best days of my life.

674
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:43,370
We were lucky that summer
that we didn´t get ourselves killed.

675
01:01:43,704 --> 01:01:45,914
Maybe it was something more than luck.

676
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:49,543
If so, I hope it returns when they do.

677
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:55,674
Lucky seven.

678
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:03,056
I brought this old photo album from home.

679
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:05,684
My dad was stationed in Derry
during World War II.

680
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:09,104
He collected these old photos
from the olden days.

681
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:11,273
Who´d want a history of this toilet?

682
01:02:11,648 --> 01:02:14,067
How many years
will you be in here with me?

683
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,403
Continue, Michael.

684
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:18,071
This is the old ironworks.

685
01:02:18,488 --> 01:02:21,533
One Sunday, back in 1930,
there was an Easter egg hunt here.

686
01:02:22,534 --> 01:02:25,746
The ironworks exploded,
and all these people got killed.

687
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:30,626
This is the Derry Standpipe.
It supplied all the water to the town...

688
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:33,170
...until a big disaster in 1900.

689
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:39,843
The biggest mystery is how 253 settlers
disappeared without a trace.

690
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:45,432
Thank you for that illuminating,
if somewhat morbid, history.

691
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:47,518
Who´s next?

692
01:02:53,649 --> 01:02:55,025
Howdy, partner.

693
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:57,945
Give it here!

694
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:02,783
Or what, boy? Or what?

695
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:08,830
This nigger lives down the street
from me and my dad.

696
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:10,082
Give it here.

697
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:15,504
You´ve been giving me
and my daddy grief for a long time.

698
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:18,715
You like fireworks?

699
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:23,971
What do you say
to a rocket in your pocket?

700
01:03:29,393 --> 01:03:30,519
Hey, you!

701
01:03:30,686 --> 01:03:32,062
Stop that right now.

702
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,189
Get him!

703
01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:40,988
l´m glad l´m not the only one
who saw something.

704
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:43,782
It wasn´t a clown at first.
It was a werewolf.

705
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:46,493
I didn´t see a werewolf. Just a clown.

706
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:48,537
Don´t you see...

707
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:53,166
...it was a werewolf for Richie
because he saw that dumb movie.

708
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,085
But it was a clown underneath.

709
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:58,547
Maybe it´s an evil being
that can read our minds...

710
01:03:58,714 --> 01:04:01,049
...and take the shape
of stuff we´re afraid of.

711
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:04,428
- That´s what happened to the kids here?
- Get serious.

712
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:27,576
Why didn´t any of us say anything?

713
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:30,621
Personally, I thought
you guys would think I was nuts.

714
01:04:30,913 --> 01:04:33,081
Me, too. I thought it was just me.

715
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:36,585
- You´re not alone.
- Such a thing isn´t empirically possible.

716
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:39,087
It was so real.

717
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:43,050
- It almost had my guts for garters.
- It´s just the influence of the movie.

718
01:04:43,091 --> 01:04:45,969
Could it be a crazy guy
dressed up in a clown suit?

719
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,346
No.

720
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:52,559
It´s some kind of monster,
right here in Derry.

721
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:57,064
l´m going to bury you.

722
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:58,565
God, Henry Bowers.

723
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:03,320
We better get out of here.

724
01:05:03,654 --> 01:05:07,074
- Dummy up. All of you. Rocks.
- Rocks?

725
01:05:07,115 --> 01:05:08,450
Rocks. Ammo.

726
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:27,177
Please, help me.

727
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:34,226
You´re dead!

728
01:05:43,026 --> 01:05:44,486
What do you know?

729
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:47,322
It´s the fat boy, the Jew and the sissy.

730
01:05:47,614 --> 01:05:49,658
Four-eyes and the patch girl, too.

731
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:51,785
Nigger, you know how to pick them.

732
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:53,996
The loser´s club.

733
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:57,165
Yeah, the loser´s club.

734
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:03,589
I got bones to pick with you.

735
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:06,592
l´m willing to let that go for today.

736
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:09,094
Today, I want him. So buzz off.

737
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:10,846
Get out of here.

738
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:13,640
- Who´s going to make me?
- We are.

739
01:06:13,724 --> 01:06:16,977
- What did you say, chubs?
- Dig the wax out of your ears.

740
01:06:17,019 --> 01:06:19,229
You´re through, Bowers. Get out!

741
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:21,273
You stuttering freak.

742
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:29,364
You´re going to get a surprise.
You´ll get such a surprise!

743
01:06:55,557 --> 01:06:56,975
Run, Henry!

744
01:06:58,644 --> 01:06:59,978
Come on!

745
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:10,531
Get out.

746
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:11,990
What if I won´t?

747
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:15,577
The six of us could put you in the hospital.

748
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:17,788
Seven.

749
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,547
l´ll kill you all.

750
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:28,507
Get some new material, champ.

751
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:41,603
l´ll kill you all.

752
01:07:42,771 --> 01:07:43,897
l´ll kill you all.

753
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:47,067
Thanks.

754
01:07:48,819 --> 01:07:49,945
Anytime.

755
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:53,824
Who are you guys anyway?

756
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:56,952
We´re sort of a club.

757
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:02,457
Yeah, the loser´s club.

758
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:03,792
Yeah.

759
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:07,004
You want in?

760
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:09,798
Yes, I do.

761
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:12,759
We´re seven now.

762
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:14,928
Lucky seven.

763
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:18,307
Wait a second.

764
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:37,284
There´s no way to date this one.

765
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:41,955
He says it´s probably from the early 1 700s,
when Derry was a logging town.

766
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,081
Hold it.

767
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:47,002
- Pennywise the Clown?
- That´s him.

768
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:48,253
That´s him!

769
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,090
Two hundred years ago?
He was here then?

770
01:08:52,174 --> 01:08:54,718
Come on! lt´s just a drawing.

771
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:55,928
Look.

772
01:08:56,178 --> 01:08:57,679
Here he is again.

773
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:59,264
The same man.

774
01:08:59,431 --> 01:09:00,557
It´s not a man.

775
01:09:01,016 --> 01:09:02,017
It.

776
01:09:02,893 --> 01:09:03,602
It!

777
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:09,691
That´s what happened
back in Georgie´s room.

778
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,671
Look!

779
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:50,899
l´ll kill you all!

780
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:55,487
l´ll drive you crazy, and l´ll kill you all.

781
01:09:57,072 --> 01:10:02,035
l´m every nightmare you´ve ever had,
your worst dream come true.

782
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:05,914
l´m everything you ever were afraid of.

783
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:14,506
- No!
- Yes! Yes!

784
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,091
- Yes.
- No!

785
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:18,135
Yes. Yes.

786
01:10:19,219 --> 01:10:21,638
- You saw it, too.
- I didn´t want to.

787
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:23,223
But you did.

788
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:30,189
Yes. If that´s what you want.

789
01:10:31,857 --> 01:10:32,608
Yes.

790
01:10:33,233 --> 01:10:35,485
That´s what I wanted, you turkey.

791
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:39,031
- What are we going to do?
- What do you mean "do"?

792
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:41,241
I just want to forget about it.

793
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:42,576
It´s not just us.

794
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:46,330
It´s all the other kids, too.
Like Velma Daniels from my class.

795
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:48,290
Who´s going to be next?

796
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:51,001
Bev´s right. We have to do something.

797
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:54,087
- We should tell somebody.
- They don´t see what we see.

798
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:56,632
When you grow up, you stop believing.

799
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,260
They´ll laugh and put us in a nuthouse.

800
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:03,514
- It kills kids, damn it.
- We have to do something.

801
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:15,192
Help me.

802
01:11:23,242 --> 01:11:25,619
You killed my brother, you bastard.

803
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,497
Let´s see you now.

804
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:31,500
Let´s see you now.

805
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:34,002
It´s scared of us, you know?

806
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:37,548
I can feel that. I swear to God I can.

807
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:44,346
I want to kill lt.

808
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:51,937
Help me.

809
01:13:35,749 --> 01:13:37,459
We got a letter from Mom today.

810
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:40,420
She asked when
we´re going to make her a grandma.

811
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:43,257
She´s uncanny.
I was just thinking the same thing.

812
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:46,718
I was, really.

813
01:13:50,806 --> 01:13:54,184
Does she know l´m a sex maniac
and that you prefer Perfect Strangers?

814
01:13:54,268 --> 01:13:56,395
You want to pay attention to me.

815
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:02,317
Don´t move.

816
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:09,116
Uris residence. Stan speaking.
This better be good.

817
01:14:09,283 --> 01:14:11,326
Hello, Stan. It´s Mike Hanlon.

818
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:13,620
- Who did you say?
- Mike Hanlon.

819
01:14:13,704 --> 01:14:15,163
- Mike Hanlon?
- Yeah.

820
01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:18,333
l´ll be damned.

821
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:20,836
Stan, it´s come back.

822
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:24,173
- Are you sure?
- l´m sure.

823
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:27,342
- Do you understand? l´m sure.
- I understand.

824
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:30,804
- You know how hard it is to call...
- I get the picture.

825
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:33,056
Can you make it, Stan? Please.

826
01:14:34,016 --> 01:14:39,605
- I can´t promise that, but l´ll consider it.
- Don´t you remember, Stan?

827
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:42,900
- Don´t you remember your promise?
- Yes, Mike.

828
01:14:42,983 --> 01:14:45,194
- You promised.
- Yes, I remember.

829
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:46,820
I hope you come.

830
01:14:47,029 --> 01:14:48,530
- Goodbye.
- ´Bye, Stan.

831
01:14:55,662 --> 01:14:57,289
Who was it, honey?

832
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:02,002
Stan?

833
01:15:02,753 --> 01:15:03,754
No one.

834
01:15:05,672 --> 01:15:06,757
No one, really.

835
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,636
I think l´ll take a bath.

836
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:12,971
Now?

837
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:40,791
A scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful,
friendly, courteous, kind...

838
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:43,043
...obedient, cheerful, thrifty...

839
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:46,380
...brave, clean and reverent.

840
01:15:47,464 --> 01:15:50,217
- Are you okay?
- I think this is crazy.

841
01:15:57,933 --> 01:16:01,311
One out of 10. You´re worse than I am.

842
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,189
We might as well let that damn clown
take us one by one.

843
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:05,399
Beep, beep, Richie.

844
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:09,069
Who´s left? Ben? Bev?

845
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:11,613
One of them better be good.

846
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:14,575
You´re in the lead
with a pathetic three out of 10.

847
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:16,243
Will you please shut up?

848
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:19,621
- You don´t stutter all the time.
- Ladies first.

849
01:16:43,896 --> 01:16:46,857
Ten out of 10. I don´t think I need to shoot.

850
01:16:47,316 --> 01:16:49,318
It´s like it´s supposed to be Bev.

851
01:16:50,027 --> 01:16:51,028
Yeah.

852
01:16:52,196 --> 01:16:53,697
This is still crazy.

853
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:57,201
- No, it´s not.
- l´m with Stan.

854
01:16:57,826 --> 01:16:59,828
So what if I can shoot good?

855
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,165
- You think a handful of stones are going...
- Show them, Richie.

856
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:06,376
My mother´s earrings. Solid silver.

857
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:09,630
That´s just stuff in movies.
What good is it going to do...

858
01:17:09,713 --> 01:17:13,342
They´re silver. They can kill it.
We have to believe that.

859
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:26,647
On my honor, I will do my best
to do my duty to God and my country...

860
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:31,818
...to help other people at all times,
keep myself physically strong...

861
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:35,656
...mentally awake and morally...

862
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:39,284
- Maybe this isn´t such a good idea.
- What are you mumbling about?

863
01:17:44,748 --> 01:17:46,041
Now, listen up.

864
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:49,044
You guys don´t have to do this.

865
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:51,755
My dad says you have to know
when to take a stand.

866
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:57,594
Lucky seven, Stan.

867
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:00,180
I said I was in.

868
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:04,017
You think we´re going
to let you have all the fun, Billy-boy?

869
01:18:04,726 --> 01:18:05,727
Eddie?

870
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:08,438
l´m with my friends. Right?

871
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,568
Give me that.

872
01:18:15,696 --> 01:18:17,573
It tastes like battery acid.

873
01:19:05,329 --> 01:19:08,165
- Where are they going?
- Down in the sewer, stupid.

874
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:10,250
Guess what?

875
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:14,463
They´re not coming back out.

876
01:19:42,241 --> 01:19:44,368
You mean we have to go down there?

877
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:48,497
Stan, if you don´t want to go,
now´s the time to turn back.

878
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:54,378
Great choice. Let´s go.

879
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:35,335
They´re going down into the pipes
where we chased that dog.

880
01:20:36,545 --> 01:20:40,007
You go how we went. Go ahead of them
and chase them back towards us.

881
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:44,761
Me and Belch will catch them.
Hurry or there will be nothing left for you.

882
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:51,351
- Go by myself?
- Yeah, go by yourself.

883
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:55,314
What are you afraid of? The boogeyman?

884
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:24,593
Hardy, har-har.

885
01:21:24,676 --> 01:21:26,678
At least we know we´re on its trail.

886
01:21:26,762 --> 01:21:29,097
Maybe this is where it wants us to be.

887
01:21:29,306 --> 01:21:31,308
Eddie, which way is Derry?

888
01:21:34,811 --> 01:21:38,106
Bev, get up front
where you can get a clear shot.

889
01:21:38,398 --> 01:21:41,109
Stay together. No stragglers.

890
01:23:07,404 --> 01:23:08,405
Hi, kid.

891
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:10,616
I guess you´re the first.

892
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:02,709
- Who´s missing?
- Stan.

893
01:24:02,793 --> 01:24:03,794
Oh, no!

894
01:24:11,426 --> 01:24:16,390
Now, before you die, I want you
to think of every rock you threw...

895
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:18,642
...and everything you said.

896
01:24:19,309 --> 01:24:21,520
Think about that before you die.

897
01:24:38,745 --> 01:24:39,746
What was that?

898
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:19,036
God, he´s not in there anymore.

899
01:25:20,162 --> 01:25:21,288
Belch!

900
01:25:59,826 --> 01:26:00,827
Help!

901
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:06,917
Stan!

902
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,252
It´s coming!

903
01:26:12,214 --> 01:26:13,882
Hands, quick!

904
01:26:57,634 --> 01:26:59,803
Is that it? Did we do it?

905
01:27:00,012 --> 01:27:01,013
Look!

906
01:27:17,404 --> 01:27:20,282
Quick! Take hands
before we get lost in this stuff.

907
01:27:21,283 --> 01:27:22,284
Grab hold.

908
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,120
Is everybody here?

909
01:27:25,996 --> 01:27:28,248
- l´m here. Stannie?
- Yeah.

910
01:27:28,498 --> 01:27:29,499
Richie?

911
01:27:29,917 --> 01:27:31,293
Yeah. Mike?

912
01:27:32,836 --> 01:27:33,837
Here.

913
01:27:34,296 --> 01:27:36,006
- Whose hand is this?
- Mine.

914
01:27:36,298 --> 01:27:37,799
That you, Ben?

915
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:39,426
Yeah.

916
01:27:39,801 --> 01:27:41,637
Whatever happens, hang on.

917
01:27:41,803 --> 01:27:45,432
It´s not as strong as it thought it was,
or it would´ve killed us then.

918
01:27:45,474 --> 01:27:47,142
We have to resist.

919
01:27:48,602 --> 01:27:51,939
Bill! Bill!

920
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:53,815
Georgie?

921
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:55,776
No, Bill.

922
01:27:57,194 --> 01:28:00,197
That´s not George. Don´t break the circle.

923
01:28:00,614 --> 01:28:01,615
Bevy!

924
01:28:02,783 --> 01:28:07,120
What are you doing down here
with these boys. Now, get home.

925
01:28:07,913 --> 01:28:10,624
Daddy? Daddy, l´m...

926
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:13,752
Wake up, hot stuff. That ain´t Daddy.

927
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:16,255
There ain´t nothing there.

928
01:28:22,094 --> 01:28:27,140
I said, "There ain´t nothing there."

929
01:28:33,689 --> 01:28:38,360
On my honor, I will do my best
to do my duty to God and my country.

930
01:28:56,795 --> 01:28:57,796
Stan.

931
01:28:58,088 --> 01:29:00,048
Stanley, boy.

932
01:29:07,222 --> 01:29:08,473
Stanley, resist!

933
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,269
Let go! Be afraid!

934
01:29:13,061 --> 01:29:14,354
Bev, the stones!

935
01:29:14,688 --> 01:29:18,150
You all taste so much better
when you´re afraid.

936
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:19,651
Hurry, Bev, kill it!

937
01:29:19,735 --> 01:29:20,694
Kill!

938
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:23,197
Me!

939
01:29:23,405 --> 01:29:25,741
You are priceless, brat.

940
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:28,994
I am eternal, child.

941
01:29:29,328 --> 01:29:32,247
I am the eater of worlds...

942
01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:33,999
...and of children.

943
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:37,920
And you are next.

944
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:45,844
This is battery acid, you slime!

945
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:06,657
Kill it! Kill it, Bev!

946
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:09,910
Kill it!

947
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:11,453
Die!

948
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:23,090
Help me! Help me!

949
01:30:37,688 --> 01:30:39,439
- Is it dead?
- I don´t think so.

950
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:41,692
- We have to get out.
- We have to go after it.

951
01:30:41,775 --> 01:30:43,652
- No, it´s dead.
- We have to make sure.

952
01:30:43,694 --> 01:30:46,196
- It sounded like it was dying.
- What if it didn´t?

953
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:20,606
Swear to me...

954
01:31:22,608 --> 01:31:25,027
...that if it isn´t dead...

955
01:31:26,653 --> 01:31:28,113
...you´ll all come back.

956
01:31:35,204 --> 01:31:36,622
I swear.

957
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:42,002
I swear.

958
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:47,299
I swear it.

959
01:31:57,017 --> 01:31:58,060
Yeah, I swear.

960
01:32:03,232 --> 01:32:04,483
I swear, too.

961
01:32:19,456 --> 01:32:20,457
I swear.

962
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:25,754
I swear.

963
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:40,561
Stannie?

964
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:45,524
l´m coming upstairs to scrub your back...

965
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:47,776
...and your chest.

966
01:32:48,694 --> 01:32:49,695
And...

967
01:32:55,534 --> 01:32:56,535
Stanley?

968
01:33:00,789 --> 01:33:01,790
Stanley?

969
01:33:05,711 --> 01:33:06,712
Stan?
