1
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,900
Hey Rahul!
Want to be friends?

2
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,800
She's just like her
father. Isn't she?

3
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,300
Tina's very critical Rahul.

4
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,100
She doesn't have much time.

5
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,500
We tried our best.

6
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,200
She had severe internal bleeding.
We couldn't do anything.

7
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,200
She knew there would be
complications in her delivery.

8
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,000
She also knew how much you
wanted this child.

9
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,800
She loved this baby more
than her life.

10
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,900
I want my daughterto now me.

11
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,200
Who her motherwas,
what she was like.

12
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,900
I want herto be able to answer
all these questions herself.

13
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,100
I am leaving these 8 letters
for her...

14
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,500
...1 each of her 1st
8 birthdays.

15
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,900
These letters have everything
that I want to tell my daughter

16
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,300
These letters are going
to be her memories.

17
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,800
You are very bad.

18
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,600
You are very bad.

19
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,900
Rahul, Want to be friends?

20
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,600
Promise me you will never cry.

21
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,800
Anyways, you look very bad
when you cry.

22
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,600
Also promise me that...

23
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,600
...you'll name our daughter
Anjali.

24
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,500
I am sorry Rahul.
I am really sorry.

25
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,500
Don't go.

26
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,400
Promise me you'll name
our daughter Anjali.

27
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,700
Hi! I am Anjali...

28
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,700
...and you're watching
channel Anjali.

29
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,700
I am going to grow up
and be a V. J...

30
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,800
...you know just like
Neelam.

31
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,800
Hey cut cut cut.

32
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Ooops I'll be back
afterthe break.

33
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,100
My hobbies are eating
chocolates...

34
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,800
...beating up boys,
irritating granny...

35
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,600
...and reading mom's letters.

36
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,500
Hey I'm late.

37
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,800
I have to get ready and
go to meet papa.

38
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,300
Watch me.

39
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,500
Hi, Anjali, listen to me.
Look.

40
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Look... I'm only...

41
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,600
...2 hours late.

42
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,400
Right.
- Okay. Sorry. I was busy.

43
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
So was I.

44
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,700
I haven't even watched
television today...

45
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,300
...because I had to come
to do your shopping.

46
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,600
I can't handle everything.
I'm your daughter not yourwife.

47
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,500
Why?

48
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,000
Lf I can be both your dad
and mom...

49
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,800
...why can't you be both...
Okay.

50
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,200
What?
- Felt bad?

51
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
A bit.

52
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,000
Sorry
- Okay.

53
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,500
That is why one says...

54
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,300
...there is only one god
in many forms.

55
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,900
No matterwhat form,
he knows our devotion.

56
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
It is important to keep
this bond with god.

57
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
She speaks so well, doesn't she?

58
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,800
So, that's all fortoday

59
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,600
Now we'll have...

60
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,700
I got this gift for
St. Valentine's day

61
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,900
Rupa!
- Me?

62
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Rupa will chant the
divine hymn.

63
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,000
Me?

64
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,400
Chant Rupa.

65
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The divine hymn...
I forgot it.

66
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What?
What are you saying Rupa?!

67
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,400
Can you believe that sisters?
She has forgotten the divine hymn.

68
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,400
My dear if you don't pay
attention to prayer...

69
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
...what will you teach
your children.

70
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,100
The way we think and
the things we say...

71
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,200
...have a deep impact
on our children.

72
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,200
Granny.

73
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,500
Speaking of children...
Namaste. Hi! Sexy.

74
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,300
Who taught you that?
- Papa.

75
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,600
Go get ready for your
School function.

76
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,300
Granny... the letter.

77
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,900
When is your birthday?
- Tomorrow.

78
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,300
Come on, hurry up.

79
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes, there are our seats.
- Come sit.

80
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,500
Come Mr. Khanna, sit.

81
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,700
Good evening ladies
and gentlemen.

82
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,600
Welcome to the Just
one-minute competition.

83
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,000
It's a strange competition. Children
have to talk on the stage...

84
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,800
...and the topic is given right
there in some strange bowl.

85
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,800
On the spot sir, on the spot.

86
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,300
Stop it Balbir, control yourself.
- Never mind. It's ok.

87
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,200
Every student will be given only
one minute. Just one minute.

88
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,900
Just One Minute?
Only one minute to speak?

89
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,200
Exactly. Very unfair.

90
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,800
But yet ourJassu wins
every year.

91
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,500
She's so talented you know.

92
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,200
Best of luck Jaswinder.
- Same to you.

93
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,900
OurJaswinder is the best.

94
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,100
Actually Anjali is also
taking part.

95
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,700
She'll come second.
Don't worry.

96
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,000
Thank you.
- Oh welcome!

97
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,500
Our first contestant is
Jaswinder Singh.

98
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,200
Oh! My sweetheart.

99
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,100
My topic is Prayer.

100
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,800
Every morning we pray
to the lord.

101
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,500
Papa says prayers will
keep god happy...

102
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,900
...and he will protect us.

103
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,400
Mummy says that by praying
Grandma will get impressed...

104
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,200
...and will leave the big
house for us in the will.

105
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,700
Prayer... yes, my favourite
actress's name is Puja...

106
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,600
...and even my best friend's
name is Puja.

107
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,000
Wow! My daughter is
the best.

108
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Next we have Anjali Khanna.

109
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,700
Pick yourtopic.

110
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,800
Second!

111
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,900
Yourtimer starts now.

112
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,000
Say!

113
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,800
Mother!

114
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,600
Mother!

115
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,300
Mother!

116
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,800
I am sorry.

117
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,800
Mother...

118
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,000
A mother is someone
who loves us so much...

119
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,900
...that we sometimes can't
understand it.

120
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,300
A mother is someone who makes
us realise how good we are...

121
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,500
...there is no one better
than us.

122
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,300
Her happiness is in our
laughter...

123
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,200
...and sorrow in our
sorrow.

124
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,700
She is someone we can't
live without...

125
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,300
...she is everything.

126
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,200
Only we don't have her.

127
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:25,300
But we have papa, and
he is quite nice too.

128
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,600
Then you give me a hug.

129
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,700
That's number one!

130
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,800
Rahul, you remember
Mr. Shama? He had phoned.

131
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,800
Who?

132
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,100
Our neighbour in Delhi.
He has sent a proposal.

133
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,100
Forwhom?

134
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,800
Me.
Shut up.

135
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,800
He said the girl is
sweet and beautiful...

136
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,800
...but I refused flatly.

137
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,500
I did the right thing, didn't I?
- Yes.

138
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,200
I did the right thing?
- Yes.

139
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,700
I was right?

140
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,600
Yes mom.

141
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,900
Well I must have done
the right thing.

142
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,000
I never do anything wrong.

143
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,500
So what if the girl is
sweet and beautiful.

144
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,300
Everyone is beautiful these days.

145
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,300
Who wants to get married?
Mr. Sharma has gone mad.

146
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,200
Keeps sending me proposals.

147
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,500
Why doesn't he get himself married
and just leave me alone.

148
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,400
What's wrong mom?

149
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,000
I just find this family
incomplete.

150
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,500
Why? You are there.
L'am there...

151
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,400
...Anjali is there, I don't
find it incomplete.

152
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,600
When I go out with my
friends...

153
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,000
...they all complain about
their daughters-in-law.

154
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,700
I can't even do that.

155
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,200
This is a big problem.

156
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,000
So you need a daughter-in-law
to complain about.

157
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,000
No son.
I just want you to be happy.

158
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,200
I am happy mom.

159
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,400
So you won't marry again?

160
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,900
Mom, we live once, die once,
get married once...

161
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,100
...and love once.

162
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,400
We don't do these again.

163
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,800
You are fine, but what
of Anjali.

164
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,100
Why? What's happened to her?

165
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,700
You don't feel she needs
a mother?

166
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,200
She's okay.

167
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,000
She's just fine.

168
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,400
She's got something which
even I don't have.

169
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,000
Her mother's letters.

170
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,000
Happy Birthday Anjali.

171
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,800
My dear, Anjali.
Happy Birthday Anjali.

172
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,600
You are 8 years old today.

173
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,300
I'm sure you look just
like your dad.

174
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,700
That same smile, those
same eyes.

175
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,400
No. I look like you.

176
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,700
Does your father still go
Old habits die-hard.

177
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,500
Today you are a big girl and
you will be able to understand...

178
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,700
...what I have to tell you.

179
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,800
Today, I will tell you a story...

180
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
...about your father, me and
Anjali.

181
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,800
Anjali?

182
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,100
You're late again.

183
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,200
Can't wake up so early.

184
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,900
Can't wake up orwere
you scared.

185
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,400
Rahul Khanna is never
scared.

186
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,200
But loses to Anjali Sharma
everyday in Basketball.

187
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,600
Don't want to play?

188
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,000
What's the point, you
will lose again.

189
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,100
I won't lose today.
- You say that everyday.

190
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,200
We'll see.

191
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,600
We'll see.

192
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,900
If you can't play
atleast don't cheat.

193
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,100
Don't call me a cheater.

194
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,600
Anjali, don't call me
a cheater.

195
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Rahul is a cheater

196
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,900
He is a cheater, cheater.

197
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,800
I am not a cheater.
- Cheater.

198
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,500
Stop screaming like a girl.
- Hey! Don't call me a girl.

199
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,400
You're right, you're not a girl.

200
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,900
Atleast betterthan those
girls you run after.

201
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,500
Excuse me! I don't run after
them, they run after me.

202
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,600
Wow! Rahul's so cute.
- Yes.

203
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,000
He's so sweet, he's so
handsome.

204
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,400
Not as handsome as you,
you have a better moustache.

205
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,100
Was that a joke?
- What if it was?

206
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,800
I don't like jokes.
- I don't like you.

207
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,600
Shut up

208
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Rahul and Anjali have
fought again.

209
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,200
Rahul and Anjali have
fought again.

210
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,100
Rahul and Anjali
have fought.

211
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,700
Rahul and Anjali
have fought again.

212
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,200
"What sort of a boy is this?"

213
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,200
"What sort of a girl is this?"

214
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,700
"What do I do with him?"

215
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,400
"What do I say to her?"

216
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,700
"He fights with me!"

217
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,400
"She irritates me!"

218
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,700
"He troubles me"

219
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,200
"She gets upset"

220
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,400
"He is crazy"

221
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,800
"She is crazy"

222
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,900
"But he is your best friend dear"

223
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
"But she is your best friend dear"

224
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
"Oh my! Oh my! This boy.
Oh my! Oh my!"

225
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,400
"Why does he play these pranks?
Ask him please, why"

226
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,800
"Sometime he fights with me,
sometime he quarrels with me"

227
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,500
"Stay away from him"

228
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,900
"This boy is crazy"

229
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,100
"Crazy... Crazy..."

230
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,800
"Oh my! Oh my! This girl
Oh my! Oh my!"

231
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,800
"Why does she play these pranks?
Ask her please, why"

232
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
"Sometimes she fights with me"

233
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,600
"Sometimes she irritates"

234
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,700
"Trouble her, but only
from a distance"

235
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,900
"This girl is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy..."

236
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,000
"Only she understands
what she says"

237
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,400
"No one else can
figure that out"

238
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,800
"She's like this
and she's like that"

239
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,800
"No one can figure her out"

240
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:24,600
"So run for your life,
she is surely upto some mischief"

241
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,600
"This girl is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy..."

242
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,800
"This boy is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy..."

243
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,500
"He teases us
as he comes by"

244
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,600
"He does not listen"

245
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,700
"Look, look, he is crazy
beware of him"

246
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:43,000
"He is weird and yet
he is dearto me"

247
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,500
"This boy is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy..."

248
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,900
"This girl is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy..."

249
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,100
Oh God! Just look at
this room. Filthy.

250
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,000
These girls will drive
me crazy.

251
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,600
Hey! What is this mountain
on your head?

252
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,400
These are rollers, Rifat bi

253
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,900
Rollers don't impress boys.
You can take that from me.

254
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,800
Then how do they get impressed,
Rifat bi.

255
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,700
Oh god! What are you wearing?

256
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,600
Come on tell us.
- I don't know.

257
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,100
Tell us please.
- No!

258
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,900
Tell us.

259
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,800
Okay! Boys get impressed by
a girl's mannerisms...

260
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,700
...herwalk, hertalk
And?

261
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,200
And I don't know.

262
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,300
You girls talk to much.
Come on, clean up this mess.

263
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,400
God! What do I do with
this girl, Anjali, what is this?

264
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,300
What are you wearing?

265
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,200
Lt's cool Rifat bi.

266
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,300
Cool? Try to be feminine once
in a while atleast.

267
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,200
Not like them but...

268
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,300
Rifat bi, you say the
same thing everyday.

269
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,800
You know, I beat Rahul
in basketball again.

270
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,200
Stay away from that boy.

271
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,600
Why? He is my best friend.
He is my buddy.

272
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,400
When best friend becomes
boy friend...

273
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,900
- one doesn't even get to know.
- Rahul? Please.

274
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,700
Yes, yes. I know all about that.

275
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,500
Here I've got you some pudding.
Don't tell anyone.

276
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,100
Oh! Thank you Rifat bi.
- Leave me, mad girl.

277
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,900
No short skirts in the
college please.

278
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,700
Good morning Ms. Briganza.

279
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,000
Good morning boys,
Nice colour Piyush.

280
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,200
L'll complain to your
parents that...

281
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,400
...you wear short skirts to
college in orderto excite the boys.

282
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,700
Excuse me!

283
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,400
I said no short skirts
in college please.

284
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,400
Oh! Ms. Briganza.

285
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,200
You said something Malhotra?

286
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,700
Oh! I was just saying, that short
skirts are not allowed in college.

287
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,200
What? But this is the
latest fashion...

288
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,800
...infact, some girls don't
even wear skirts these days.

289
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,900
Don't tell me Ms. Briganza.
- Yes!

290
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,200
And am I not looking
nice today?

291
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,500
You're very queet. Queet?

292
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,200
Cute.

293
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,200
You're very cute.

294
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,000
But if you expose like this,
then these youngsters...

295
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,500
What do you mean by these youngsters.
Am I not young?

296
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,800
You're... young. Very young.

297
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,400
But you wear very boring
clothes.

298
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,700
I Know. Till Mrs. Malhotra
was alive...

299
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,600
...I would occasionally wear
fancy clothes.

300
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,400
Really?

301
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,800
But now there is no point.
- What do you mean?

302
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:01,700
Mr. Malhotra... Ms. Briganza...
Mrs. Malhotra.

303
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,300
Happy friendship day.

304
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,400
Sharma. Always scaring me.

305
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,600
What are you doing now.
- It's a friendship band sir.

306
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,400
Besides being your student,
I am also your friend now.

307
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,900
Oh! Good!

308
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,100
Sir, you look very happy today.

309
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,800
What do you mean?
- Just generally.

310
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,600
Oh! Generally. Well, my daughter
is coming home today.

311
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,500
Your daughter?
- Tina.

312
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
- She is coming back from London.
- From London?

313
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,900
She was studying at
Oxford University.

314
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,400
Oxford University?

315
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,700
We used to all live there.

316
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,200
But when Mrs. Malhotra died,
I couldn't stay there anymore.

317
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,000
- So I came back to my country.
- Tina didn't come back with you?

318
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,700
No. She had to finish
her education.

319
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,800
But I miss her, so I told her
to complete her final year...

320
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,800
...in our college, after all
we are no less than Oxford.

321
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,500
Yes Sir!

322
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
You'll take care of Tina, won't you?
- Of course sir.

323
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,600
Happy friendship day.
- Thank you sir.

324
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,100
Who? Rahul?

325
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,700
Yes! I'm the first girl forwhom
Rahul has tied a friendship band.

326
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,200
Isn't it exciting.
- Of course.

327
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,700
You know I am tying a friendship
band only for you.

328
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,400
Really Rahul?
- Really Sonia.

329
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
That is because you're the
nicest...

330
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,200
...and most beautiful girl
I've known.

331
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,000
Really Rahul?
- Really Sonia.

332
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,200
Oh Rahul! You are telling
the truth, aren't you?

333
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,100
Really Tanya.
- My name's Sonia.

334
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,000
See! I got so lost in
your eyes, I forgot your name.

335
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,600
I just can't believe this Rahul.
- Trust me.

336
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,900
Oh Rahul!
- Oh Sonia!

337
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,200
Oh Rahul!

338
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,500
These fell off.
- You cheat, you liar.

339
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,500
Hey come on... Tanya...
What's your name?

340
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,900
Sonia.
- Go away! Wasted my half-hour.

341
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,900
You don't get tired running
afterthese stupid girls.

342
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,900
Hey! I don't run after...

343
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:48,500
I know. Can't you find one girl
with beauty and brains?

344
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,900
Beauty and brains?

345
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,800
Where will I find
such a girl?

346
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,200
I'm only passing my time with these
girls. I haven't found her as yet.

347
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,500
Her?

348
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,800
Her.

349
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,800
I'm looking for a girl who
makes something happen.

350
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,300
Makes what happen?

351
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,500
Makes something happen
in my heart.

352
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,200
Makes what happen?

353
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,100
Something happens.

354
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,700
You won't understand.

355
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,200
When she walks, the
world looks on.

356
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,200
And when she stops, time stops.

357
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,200
And when she smiles...

358
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,700
She, she, she. What will you
do when you find her?

359
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,600
What will I do?
- Yes.

360
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,800
L'll kneel down in front of
her, spread my arms and say...

361
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,800
...Hey! Whoever you are...
I love you.

362
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
I love you.
- Sorry?

363
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,900
Don't be. I love you.

364
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,300
Excuse me.

365
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,800
Tina!

366
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,300
Tina.

367
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,400
Hi! I'm Anjali and you are...

368
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,900
Rahul.

369
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,400
Tina! Right?
- How do you know?

370
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,900
This morning the principal...

371
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,600
Ya! Ya! Don't take that old slob's
name first thing in the morning.

372
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,000
So Tina! Your first day in
college?

373
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,100
Yes. She just got back from London.
- How do you know?

374
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,800
Rahul, this morning the
principal...

375
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,100
I just told you not to talk
about that baldy.

376
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,100
Baldy!
- So Tina...

377
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,200
- Where were you studying in London?
- Oxford University.

378
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,800
Ox... How do you know?

379
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,400
Rahul, this morning the
principal...

380
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,100
Yeah! Yeah! Let the
Baldy be.

381
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,000
We have this grouch of
a Principal. She's his fan.

382
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,800
Grouch?
- Grouch is right. But forget him.

383
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,900
Tell me how is your
first day in college?

384
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,100
Great.

385
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,800
Good morning Archana.

386
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,500
Feroze... cut your hair.

387
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Short skirt... Oh god.

388
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,800
There's groucho.
Morning Sir.

389
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Short skirts are not allowed
in college, you know that?

390
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,400
You know I just got back
from London...

391
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,000
...and haven't had the time
to unpack.

392
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,900
Sir, it's Tina's first day here,
she's just gotten back...

393
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,100
...from London and hasn't had
the time to unpack.

394
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,500
- She wore whatever she could find.
- And how do you know that?

395
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,900
Sir, I've known Tina
since childhood.

396
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,600
Since childhood? Really?

397
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,900
Really Papa.
- Really Pa... Papa?

398
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,800
Mr. Malhotra I need you here.

399
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,600
Not there sir, in the
staff room.

400
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,800
He's an old slob, a baldy,
and a g...

401
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,100
Great? Good?

402
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,300
Grouch. But he's not
all that bad.

403
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,700
Happy friendship day.

404
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,400
We've only just met,
friendship is a farthought.

405
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,700
So... something happened?

406
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,700
No, she's not my sort.
- Why?

407
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,400
She's not Indian enough.
She's born and brought up in England.

408
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,600
And these London returns
are little weird.

409
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,500
A girl should be one you can
take home to your mother.

410
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,700
No. She's not my type.

411
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,400
She's not my type.
You won't find anyone this way.

412
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,200
Why? You're there.

413
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,600
Me? Just shut up.

414
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,800
If I don't find anyone else,
I'll marry you.

415
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,100
See. Anyway no one will
marry you.

416
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,700
Here, this is for you.
What's this?

417
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,100
This is our college sweatshirt.
Cool?

418
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,800
Thanks.
Anjali... May I ask you something?

419
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Sure.

420
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Why is everyone staring at me?

421
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,300
Why the boys are staring,
you know!

422
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,300
And the girls are wondering
what the boys are staring at...

423
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,000
...and that is why even they
are staring at you.

424
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,900
And look if you have any
problems...

425
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,200
...just come to me or
to Rahul.

426
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,500
Rahul? The one who yesterday...

427
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,100
Yeah! He's my best friend and
we sort of rule this college.

428
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,100
This is Rahul.

429
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,400
We have a rule in this college.

430
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,700
We make every newcomer sing.
You know Do Re Me...

431
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,900
Rahul, she's the principal's
daughter.

432
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,900
So! We can't break our rules
for anyone. Right?

433
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,900
But Rahul?
- Shut up,

434
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,700
You have to sing a song for us,
forthis college, in Hindi.

435
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,500
Hindi?

436
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,600
Why you forgot how to speak
Hindi in London, is it?

437
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,000
Sorry! One minute.

438
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,000
Rahul how can she sing
a Hindi song?

439
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,300
Why? She's the principal's
daughter.

440
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,000
If he can't teach her
then how will he teach us...

441
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,200
...and you shut up.

442
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,400
So, Tina, you will sing
a song in Hindi...

443
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,500
...and fast because we don't
have much time. Right?

444
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,800
Living in London and studying
and growing up there...

445
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,300
...has not made me forget
my roots...

446
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,300
...and you don't forget that.

447
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,100
Hey! You're sitting in my place.
- Oh! I'm sorry.

448
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,600
No it's okay. Hey Adi move.

449
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,500
Good morning class.

450
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,800
Good morning Ms. Briganza.

451
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,900
Today we are going to start
a new lesson - Romeo & Juliet.

452
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,900
An eternal love story.

453
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,300
Before we begin, I want to
ask you all ...

454
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,500
...What is Love?

455
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,800
Tina? You tell us,
What is love?

456
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,700
Me? I don't know.

457
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,000
You tell us, what is love?

458
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,400
Love?

459
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,200
Anyone?

460
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,100
Rahul... What is love?

461
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,700
Love is friendship.

462
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,500
If she can't be my best friend,
I can't be in love with her.

463
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,300
Without friendship there is no love.

464
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,800
Love is friendship.

465
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,800
Thank you for sharing
that with us Rahul.

466
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,900
Love is friendship.

467
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,300
So! Want to be friends?

468
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,300
Oh my head! My feet.

469
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,500
Oh Sorry Mr. Malhotra,
Ms. Briganza here.

470
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,300
I hope I didn't disturb you...

471
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,300
...and even if I did
I'm sure you don't mind.

472
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,800
Of course not Ms. Briganza.

473
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,500
I called to tell you that
the rehearsals are complete...

474
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,300
...and our college will
come first tomorrow.

475
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,800
Rest of the teams don't stand
a chance. You know what I mean.

476
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,900
This is all because of
you Ms. Briganza.

477
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,200
And it's all for you Malhotra.

478
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,700
Really Ms. Briganza?

479
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,400
Really Malhotra.

480
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,400
Oh Ms. Briganza.

481
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,700
Oh! I have fallen.

482
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,200
And the next college is
our college... St. Xavier's.

483
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,600
What! Oh my god.
They can't make it?

484
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Ms. Briganza, there is a
curfew in their area...

485
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,300
...and they can't leave.
Now what do we do?

486
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:52,900
Mr. Malhotra let me think
please. Idea...

487
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,600
Idea.

488
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,800
You have to do this or else
you both are going to fail.

489
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,900
Bur Sir, how can we sing and dance.
We don't know anything.

490
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,100
You know these students,
they will skin us alive.

491
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,600
Of course it's a good idea.
Nothing will happen to you.

492
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,500
The students who were
going to perform today...

493
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,200
...have recorded a tape of
their rehearsals.

494
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,600
L'll play that tape and
you just have to move your lips.

495
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Like in the films. Okay.

496
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,900
It won't work.

497
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,500
What do you mean it won't
work. Of course it will work.

498
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,800
My name is Chin Chin Chu

499
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,000
Moonlit sky, you and me,
Hello Mr. How do you do?

500
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,400
Anjali, you don't have any concern
forthe reputation of your college?

501
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,400
Come on Rahul, it is for
the college.

502
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,000
Come on, help us Tina.
- No, I'm not coming.

503
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,200
What are you saying?

504
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,900
Why are you asking her?
Let's go.

505
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,000
What do I play?
This must be it.

506
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,300
"You are a foreigner,
You are a foreigner,

507
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,400
You won't be here with us
for long..."

508
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,700
Looks like, I have put the
wrong tape.

509
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,700
"I found someone"

510
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,300
"I found someone"

511
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,300
"I found someone?"

512
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,200
"What's come over me?"

513
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,500
"Why do I feel so lost?"

514
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:09,600
"Either I was insane earlier
Or I've just become so."

515
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:16,900
"Dreamy eyes and unkempt hair,
What have you done to yourself."

516
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,600
"I found someone..."

517
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,100
"I've lost my heart..."

518
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,800
"What can I tell you my friends..."

519
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,800
"I am all shook up..."

520
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,900
"I've found someone..."

521
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,400
"I don't know
what's happened to me?"

522
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,800
"People have begun
calling me Romeo."

523
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,700
"And why is that so?
We should also know."

524
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,400
"What's happened to you?"

525
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,500
"Till yesterday I was
quite fine."

526
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,900
"My heart was filled with
happiness divine."

527
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,800
"Then why are you upset?
What are you disturbed about?"

528
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,000
"Have you lost something?"

529
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,500
"I have found someone..."

530
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,300
"Who is this disguised
as a cloud?"

531
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,600
"Who has come and taken
over my heart?"

532
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,300
"I would like to say it
but I can't name it."

533
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,300
"Don't name it but say
something."

534
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,800
"Give us a slight clue."

535
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,600
"It's in my eyes
It's in my heart"

536
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,600
"What can I tell you friends..."

537
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,100
"I've found someone..."

538
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,800
"I don't know what's happened to me"

539
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,100
"Why am I so lost"

540
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:59,400
"Either I was insane earlier
or I've become so now"

541
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,400
"Dreamy eyes and unkempt hair"

542
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,700
"What have you done
to yourself"

543
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,300
"I've found someone..."

544
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,900
"I've lost my heart..."

545
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,400
"What can I tell you my friends..."

546
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:21,000
"I'm all shook up..."

547
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,600
"I've found someone..."

548
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,600
Anjali, what's wrong?

549
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,700
Don't know why, I am
missing mom today.

550
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,400
How can you say this when
I am here for you?

551
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,000
Stupid, tears don't
solve anything.

552
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,200
Anjali how long have
you known Rahul?

553
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,700
From the first day at college.

554
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,200
You know what I did?
I defeated him in arm wrestling.

555
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,200
Eversince we've been
best friends.

556
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,200
Rahul is your best friend,
isn't it?

557
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,500
I am Rahul's best friend.

558
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,200
Aren't you in love with him?

559
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,500
Hi! Shall I go?
- Where?

560
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:06,100
Today's Tuesday...

561
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:09,600
Rahul goes to meet his
relatives every Tuesday.

562
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,100
But I'll stay if you want.

563
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,100
No, you go Rahul. You'll get late.
- I have some time.

564
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,900
No Rahul you'll be late,
go, go, bye!

565
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,000
God please see that I don't fail
in my exams this time as well

566
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,700
I am a bit weak in Chemistry.
So, you take care of it.

567
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,800
Hey! Look forward.

568
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,100
So, your relatives
stay here?

569
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,900
Yes, here... here... here...

570
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,200
So, Rahul Khanna comes
to the temple every Tuesday.

571
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,500
Yes.
- How sweet.

572
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,500
Why did you lie at college then?

573
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,400
Actually boys don't go to
the temple. So!

574
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,200
But you do...
- Yes.

575
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,300
You come every week?
- Yes.

576
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,000
How sweet...
- Don't call me sweet.

577
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,200
Actually my dad used
to say that...

578
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,600
...don't tell this to
anyone at college.

579
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,800
He says that a Man should
bow to 3 women...

580
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:48,000
...to mom-to one's mother,
to the Goddess Durga... and...

581
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,600
And?
- And...

582
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,700
Wear it. What do they say,
cool, you'll look cool.

583
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,900
I was just trying. Don't
know, how they wear all this.

584
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,600
There's nothing wrong in looking
girlish once in a while.

585
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,800
Here, your mother's letter.
You were missing her, weren't you?

586
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,900
And listen, take this too.
- What is this?

587
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,100
Present.

588
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,800
Hey Tina.

589
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,400
Rahul... what are you doing
here at this hour?

590
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,700
Actually I couldn't sleep and I
thought even you won't be asleep...

591
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,300
...and would be thinking of
me, so I came...

592
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,900
Do you like flowers or chocolates?
- What?

593
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:59,100
I haven't got either,
I was just curious...

594
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,900
Got chocolates too...

595
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,800
...don't you think
it's too hot out here?

596
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,400
Okay! Lf you insist.

597
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,900
Hey sit down... feel at home.

598
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,400
Isn't this the novel where the
butler murders the married couple?

599
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,700
Why are you wasting yourtime
reading such a thick book, ask me!

600
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,100
Rahul, you didn't finish
your story.

601
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,800
This couple goes on a holiday and
leave their butler behind...

602
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,300
Later one finds out the
butler is...

603
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,200
Not this story...
- Then?

604
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,200
The one you were telling me
at the temple

605
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,300
Which temple? I don't know
any temple.

606
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,900
The story about a man bowing to
three women...

607
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,900
...one's mother, the goddess
Durga, and...

608
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,400
- And?
- And...

609
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,000
Papa?
- Groucho...

610
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,100
Shut up. Rahul, papa's coming...

611
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,300
Congratulations.
- Shut up Rahul, go from here.

612
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:27,100
No... not from there,
go from there.

613
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Rahul!

614
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,600
And.

615
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:17,000
L'll climb this ladder
and catch the culprit

616
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,500
What is it?
- Torch.

617
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,300
Throw it.
- Okay.

618
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,300
Groucho...

619
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,200
Who hit me?

620
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,000
A ghost! L'll become a ghost as well.
The ghost will also get scared of me.

621
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,400
Where has the ladder gone?

622
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,600
Malhotra!

623
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,100
Why are you sneaking into
your own house?

624
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,300
Rahul, what are you doing?
- I was on my way to see you.

625
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,200
Me? Why?

626
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,500
Hey look, a shooting star.

627
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,900
Where?
- Not down here, up there!

628
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,600
They say if you make a wish on a
shooting star, yourwish comes true.

629
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:14,300
You believe that?
- Let's try. Come on.

630
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,200
"You came close to me"

631
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,300
"Smiled ever so sweetly."

632
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:44,500
"You gave me dreams."

633
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,000
"These days my heart is neither
awake nor asleep"

634
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:05,100
"What should I do?
Somethings happen in my heart."

635
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,300
"Oh! What a feeling this is!"

636
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,700
"What is this unquenchable thirst?"

637
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:15,600
"I know not, this drunken stupor
of love that's consuming me?"

638
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,400
"No one knows, why one loses
one's peace, when in love"

639
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:26,500
"What should I do?
Somethings happen in my heart."

640
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,100
"My prayers have been answered"

641
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,800
"God knows when and how
I fell in love."

642
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:26,300
"I wonder how,
I found peace in turmoil."

643
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,800
"I sit alone, weaving memories."

644
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,100
"What should I do?
Somethings happen in my heart..."

645
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,300
Butler's the killer...
Butler's the killer...

646
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,600
Hey! Look at that.

647
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,000
Hi guys! How do I look?

648
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,500
Just like Tina, right?

649
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,400
Here? Okay.

650
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,600
I'm mad, aren't I?

651
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:07,200
I wanted to look beautiful
like you...

652
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:12,000
...but I don't even know
how to.

653
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,100
You are beautiful, Anjali.

654
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,900
You're lying.

655
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,900
Didn't you hearthem
laughing?

656
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:24,000
Those people are...
...idiots like me.

657
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:27,300
Actually you're the most beautiful,
because you're very special.

658
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,600
Atleast you're not like those
girls, I keep running after.

659
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,600
You know, you can have
any boy you want.

660
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:42,300
Anyone?
- Anyone.

661
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,400
Anyone?
- Anyone.

662
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
But he has to be cockeyed.

663
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,000
Where did you get this
lipstick?

664
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,000
L'll bash her nicely.

665
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:23,600
Love is strange,
love is weird.

666
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:30,700
It's unaware of happiness
and pain.

667
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:32,900
Papa

668
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,900
Rahul.
- Papa?

669
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,600
What papa?

670
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,700
You can't keep secrets from me.

671
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,700
But Rahul? Couldn't
you find anyone else?

672
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,900
Come on papa.

673
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,400
Actually, I would have felt
as bad...

674
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,200
...even if it were someone else.

675
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,300
Why?

676
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:57,200
Because I'll have to share
your love with him.

677
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,900
I love you papa.

678
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:06,100
That is the problem.
I love you too.

679
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,300
Have you told him as yet?

680
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,600
I just feel that Rahul
and Anjali...

681
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,600
Tina, Rahul only loves you...

682
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,100
...and Anjali is his best
friend, nothing else.

683
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,700
No papa.

684
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:39,600
Somewhere hidden in this
deep friendship is deep love...

685
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:45,200
...and I don't want to come
in the way of this love.

686
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,300
The whole college knows that...

687
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,500
...Rahul and Anjali are just
friends and nothing else.

688
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,400
Go tell him that you love him.

689
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:01,100
But I don't even know,
if he loves me.

690
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:06,100
Don't keep matters of the heart
a secret. Go and tell him.

691
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,600
I love you.

692
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,000
I really love you.

693
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,100
I neverthought I'd say
this to someone...

694
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,100
...but I really love you.

695
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,400
I hope I can get myself
to say this to her...

696
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,700
I wanted to say it to her
so often...

697
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,900
...but couldn't get the
courage...

698
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:03,100
...and whenever I meet her
I decide to, but... somehow...

699
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,400
Tell whom?
- Tina. Who else?

700
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,900
Let's do this again.
L'll be Rahul you be Tina.

701
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,100
I love you.

702
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,500
I love you too.

703
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,900
She'll say the same thing,
won't she?

704
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:47,000
Ya.
- Come here.

705
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:54,100
Shall I tell her?

706
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:57,900
Shall I go right now?

707
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:13,900
"O! My Lord, love comes with
so much pain"

708
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:39,000
"The heartfelt remains in
the heart..."

709
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:50,200
"and does not escape from
one's lips"

710
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:27,400
My first love is incomplete Rifat bi.
My first love is incomplete.

711
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,300
I love you.

712
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:52,100
"You did not remember me,
there's nothing more left to say"

713
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,300
"The heart cried and the eyes welled up
There's nothing more left to say"

714
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:13,700
"You did not remember me
there's nothing more left to say"

715
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:30,100
"The heart cried and the eyes welled up
There's nothing more left to say"

716
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,000
Mother!

717
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:00,900
"I gave you all my joys,
gave you all my smiles"

718
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:13,100
"Your locks enticed me, bidding
messages of faithfulness"

719
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:22,500
"You couldn't care for my love.
There is nothing more left to say"

720
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,500
"You did not remember me
there's nothing more left to say"

721
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,200
Anjali... Anjali.

722
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,100
Rahul you look ahead,
I'll look there.

723
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,500
Anjali... Anjali...

724
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,700
One minute.

725
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,500
Where are you off to?

726
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,400
Home.
- What?

727
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,600
I got a letter from mom.
My father's not well...

728
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,400
...and there is lots of work
in the new house.

729
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,700
Have you gone mad? You got
a letter and you're leaving?

730
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,400
You're not going anywhere.
- Rahul, I have to go.

731
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,400
How can you go in the middle
of the term?

732
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,100
Rahul please...
- Go afterthis semester.

733
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:19,500
Rahul I have to go.
- You can go afterthe final exams.

734
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:23,500
Rahul I might not come back
even forthe final exams.

735
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,900
I'm not coming back Rahul.

736
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:37,100
You are leaving college,
leaving me...

737
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:44,100
...and you didn't even tell
me about it.

738
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Rahul please...
- I don't want to know.

739
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,800
Rahul I'm going.
- So go.

740
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:57,900
Rahul I'm not coming back.
- I don't care.

741
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,700
Anjali don't go.
Who'll I play basketball with?

742
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,400
You used to lose everyday, anyways.

743
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,400
But why are you going?

744
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,700
My parents need me...
- And I don't?

745
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,400
Now you irritate Tina. You've
bothered me enough.

746
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,700
L'll fail.
- Then fail.

747
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,100
Anjali...

748
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,400
Stop chasing those stupid
girls now.

749
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:30,200
L'll miss you Anjali.
- L'll miss you too.

750
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,100
That day I realised that
perhaps...

751
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:14,600
...I had come between
Rahul and Anjali.

752
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,800
Perhaps, I had come between
two friends...

753
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:21,200
Anjali's silence told me
everything.

754
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:25,500
And that day I was sure...
...that she loved your father.

755
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,100
Perhaps even I couldn't
love him as much.

756
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,400
Anjali neither called norwrote.

757
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:37,300
She had gone away from
our lives. Forever.

758
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:47,300
Yes. I became his friend but
could never be his best friend.

759
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:54,300
Your father is alone now
but won't say anything.

760
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,200
He needs a friend, he needs
love...

761
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,100
that friend is Anjali,
that love is Anjali.

762
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:07,200
Get Anjali back into
your father's life.

763
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,100
Return Anjali her first love.

764
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,700
Anjali and Rahul are made
for each other.

765
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:21,000
This is the truth and
this is my dream.

766
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,800
Will you fulfil your mother's dream?

767
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,100
Get Anjali back in Rahul's life.

768
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:39,400
Get Anjali back in your
father's life.

769
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:43,600
Make my dream come true.
