1
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:14,985
Happy Birthday!
Give me five.

2
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:45,155
This is Malhotra speaking,
using STD on my personal line.

3
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:47,952
Are you all coming tomorrow?

4
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:51,748
Yes! As soon as we reach Delhi,
we'll take the Faridabad train.

5
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:56,243
The one at 4 O'clock?
- Yes! What are you doing?

6
00:00:57,242 --> 00:01:00,539
Me? I was just... nothing.

7
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,637
No... sorry not you.

8
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:04,435
These Mumbai butlers
are something else.

9
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:07,732
Okay then, I'll pick you
up tomorrow.

10
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,129
Sure? You forgot last time.

11
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:13,926
Last time... this time
I'll be there

12
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:17,123
...by the way, the requirements
forthe death anniversary...

13
00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:19,520
Yes! I am getting it all
with me. Don't worry.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,017
Okay then, bye.
- Bye.

15
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:29,810
Hi Guys!

16
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,007
This is Neelam and you're watching
your favourite show, The Neelam Show.

17
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:35,904
Like always we are going to
do something new...

18
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:38,002
We are going to play a game.

19
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:41,498
Would you all like to play
this game?

20
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:46,293
Lt is said that this game gets
matters of the heart to the fore.

21
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,789
I will say a word...

22
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:54,186
...and you have to say the first
word that comes to your mind.

23
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:57,982
But you get no time
to think.

24
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,676
We'll start with you, Clouds?

25
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:06,174
Sorry. Times up. Clouds?

26
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:08,172
Rain.

27
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,469
Beautiful?
- Neelam.

28
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,667
Thanks!

29
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,665
Heart?
- Love.

30
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:16,963
Okay... Love?
- Seema.

31
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:19,960
What? You love me?
- Yeah!

32
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:23,656
This game really works.

33
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:26,753
You saw how real feelings came
rushing out. Now you try this game...

34
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:30,749
...and we'll be back
after a break.

35
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:35,944
Stupid game, stupid Neelam.
- Don't call my Neelam stupid.

36
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:41,638
Okay! Let's play your game.

37
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:47,632
Okay! Ready, start, go... Sexy?
- Granny.

38
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,328
Papa play seriously.
- Okay.

39
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:53,526
Clouds?

40
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,025
Papa you can't take so long.

41
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:58,821
I'm having water. Okay, now
we'll start. Tell me.

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,019
Clouds?
- Air.

43
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,317
Mad?
- You.

44
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:03,416
Home?
- Us.

45
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,915
Love?
- Friendship.

46
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:07,113
Anjali?
- Sharma.

47
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:09,410
Sharma?

48
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,507
Who is Anjali Sharma?

49
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:16,703
Who is she?

50
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:18,401
Nobody.

51
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,499
Papa, it's my birthday...

52
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:23,796
Okay. Anjali Sharma studied
in college with me.

53
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:28,092
In your College?

54
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,087
She was my friend.
- Friend!

55
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,685
My best friend.

56
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:38,082
Her name's very nice,
what was she like?

57
00:03:41,978 --> 00:03:45,075
She was unlike any other girl.

58
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:48,771
She was like one of the boys.

59
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,165
All the other girls spent
time on make up...

60
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,160
...but Anjali played
Basketball.

61
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:07,252
She wore clothes like me.
Yeah! Really.

62
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:17,143
Anjali was mad. Dressing
up and looking beautiful...

63
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:21,039
...was just not her scene.

64
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:26,733
Enough or do you still
want to hear more?

65
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,930
Papa where is she now?
- I don't know.

66
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:40,819
Anjali, I can't believe that
you are getting engaged.

67
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,114
By the way, Guruji has come
to fix the wedding date.

68
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:51,109
Show me that one.

69
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:53,606
How much will you adorn yourself,
Aman's getting impatient.

70
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:06,493
"Your groom has been
waiting for long"

71
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:11,288
"Don't delay anymore
come soon"

72
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:36,363
"I've come to your doorstep
I've come to take you away"

73
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:41,458
"I've come to exchange
my heart for yours"

74
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:56,343
"My every heartbeat has a message
for you... listen to my heart"

75
00:05:57,043 --> 00:06:01,238
"The Bridegroom has come home..."

76
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:03,836
"Why's the bride shy?"

77
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:07,232
"The Bridegroom has come home"

78
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:20,619
"Oh! Dear heart you can't make
excuses... no more"

79
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:25,514
"Now the bride will have
to go with her groom"

80
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:30,709
"What's her vermilion
whispering to her?"

81
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:21,458
"I've got hooked in
his net of love"

82
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:24,555
"Dear friends, how
did this happen?"

83
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:26,853
"Tell me, tell me"

84
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:31,248
"Oh my darling! Your friends
too have a crush on me"

85
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:34,745
"They won't have much to say
Ask them"

86
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:40,739
"Go, go, dear liar
Why do you make self praises"

87
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:51,029
"Your love has something to say
Will you listen to my heart!"

88
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,475
"He is innocent and oblivious. I've
done him a favour by accepting him."

89
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:47,872
"Someone please convey to him."

90
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:56,363
"She teases me deliberately I've given
my heart in return of her favour"

91
00:08:57,163 --> 00:09:00,160
"Do convey to her"

92
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,556
"You're not aware of heartbreak"

93
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,946
"Your love has something to say
Will you listen to his heart"

94
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:57,702
"With henna on your hands
bedecked with jewellery"

95
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:08,192
"Teary eyed you will make us all,
and leave in the morning"

96
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,887
"We will miss you lots,
We will miss you lots"

97
00:10:57,842 --> 00:11:01,838
"I've come to your doorstep
I've come to take you away"

98
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:06,433
"I've come to exchange
my heart for yours"

99
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:11,628
"My every heartbeat has a message
for you... listen to my heart"

100
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:15,524
"The Bridegroom has come home"

101
00:11:17,222 --> 00:11:20,519
"Why's the bride shy?"

102
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:10,669
This is the old address.
Where do I get the new one from?

103
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:13,366
What Grandpa, you can't even
do this much for me?

104
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,664
I can do it for you but...
- Really!

105
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:19,260
The college principal can't even
do this much.

106
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:28,451
One minute... She would definitely
know where Anjali Sharma is.

107
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,738
I'm sorry. I had promised
Anjali that...

108
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:44,435
...I would not give her
address to anyone.

109
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:46,733
We were hopeful that...

110
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:50,529
I understand sir, but I made
a promise to Anjali.

111
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:56,323
Rifat bi, I'm also Anjali,
you won't tell me either?

112
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:03,716
Sir, she's getting engaged
today...

113
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:06,813
...and herwedding is within
this week.

114
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:09,810
Her Guruji will finalise
the date today.

115
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:12,407
The preparations forthe
wedding are underway.

116
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:15,404
You have come very late.

117
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:18,201
I am also going by
tomorrow afternoon's train.

118
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:22,198
This marriage cannot happen.
Mummy said so.

119
00:13:26,793 --> 00:13:29,191
Guruji, we need to finalise
the wedding date.

120
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,888
Yes dear.

121
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:34,585
This is Aman's horoscope.
- Yes.

122
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:38,281
Aman wants to go to
London this month.

123
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,678
If you could find a date this
month itself?

124
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:44,875
This month?
- Yes Guruji.

125
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,272
Sir, if you would have
come earlier...

126
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:51,169
Yes, but we didn't know...

127
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:17,942
Anjali's stars have a negative
influence right now.

128
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:20,439
Until it changes she
cannot get married.

129
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:30,529
What about next month Guruji?
- Not even next month.

130
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:40,819
Not before December.

131
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:07,792
I had heard of God's grace,
today I've seen it.

132
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:13,486
The child's prayers
have been answered

133
00:15:13,486 --> 00:15:16,783
Anjali's wedding is
postponed to December.

134
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:25,274
Anjali, can I ask you something?
- Yes.

135
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:30,569
Are you happy?

136
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:37,562
What sort of a question is that?
Of course I'm happy.

137
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,257
I've got engaged.

138
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:47,952
Aman's really nice, he
loves me a lot and...

139
00:15:48,451 --> 00:15:51,149
But do you love him?

140
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:58,142
Anjali...

141
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:06,233
I have already loved mom.

142
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,326
I'm not sure I can do
it again.

143
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,121
Just think of this
as a compromise.

144
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:21,218
Compromise?

145
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:28,112
I neverthought that my daughterwould
marry out of compromise and not love

146
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:35,604
I'm your mother and I want
you to be happy too.

147
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:43,896
But a home based on a compromise
is a house, not a home.

148
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,887
The rest is upto you.

149
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:37,442
Oh! I can't handle this
religious stuff... Yes I can.

150
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,237
Today Guruji is going to chant
hymns and read the sacred book.

151
00:17:42,637 --> 00:17:45,434
Wow! How exciting. This
Guruji will get a...

152
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,930
Why? He has delayed my wedding.

153
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:52,827
I can't stand these hymns any more.

154
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:55,224
Even God gets fed up with
so many hymns.

155
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:57,722
Why? Don't you want to ask
God for anything special?

156
00:17:57,722 --> 00:18:00,020
I've got you...
what more could I ask for?

157
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,414
Well I do want some kids but that
I'm afraid I'll have to do myself.

158
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:08,211
Behave yourself!

159
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,603
Aman I saw you bare bodied,
exercising this morning.

160
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:21,199
What are you saying?
- Kammo... even in your old age?

161
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:24,096
Old! Old must be you.

162
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:30,689
Don't trouble him.
Do you have a brother?

163
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:34,485
My Gurpreet is also very pretty.
- What are you saying?

164
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:40,279
Forget Gurpreet,
My Jaspreet is Ms. Chandigarh.

165
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:44,475
Ms. Chandigarh or Ms. Sector 11.

166
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:49,970
Okay come on now, Guruji
has started.

167
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,067
Okay, bye Aman.

168
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,362
Anjali, there is a call for you.

169
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:01,358
Thanks a lot mother-in-law.
- Welcome son-in-law.

170
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:12,247
Hello!
I love you.

171
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:15,944
Huh... Aman!
- Listen, I have a problem.

172
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:20,140
What?
- Don't leave me like this.

173
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,836
Aman I don't know who is
on the line.

174
00:19:23,836 --> 00:19:25,934
And anyway you are going to
Shimla for your summer camp.

175
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,730
You're going to Bombay as well.

176
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,727
For24 hours and you're
going for a month.

177
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:36,223
Aman, I go there every year
to teach singing and dancing.

178
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:39,220
Those kids are part of my life.

179
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,616
Even they are a part of
your life.

180
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,413
Only I'm left out.

181
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:53,506
Why do I get the feeling, you
don't love me?

182
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:55,204
Because I don't.

183
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:58,601
And that you don't want to marry me.
- Right, I don't.

184
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,197
Hey! Any tantrums this time...

185
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:06,693
...and I'll drag you by the
hand to the marriage pandal.

186
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:09,590
You'll force me?
- If need be.

187
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:14,885
You have the guts to do it?

188
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:17,582
Try me.

189
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:21,378
L'll stay here with
your aunts.

190
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:23,776
You go to Shimla
for your Summer Camp

191
00:20:23,776 --> 00:20:25,974
Summer Camp!

192
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:28,371
Shimla!

193
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:31,868
Summer Camp? Shimla?

194
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,364
No way. Too much snow there.

195
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:39,960
Papa, it's a summer camp.
- Whatever... Is this okay?

196
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,157
Yes. Papa they teach singing
and dancing there...

197
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:46,253
...and you know I am fond
of that.

198
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,951
Since when have you been fond
of singing and dancing?

199
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:51,648
I've said no means no.

200
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:54,745
Papa not fair.
- Let her go.

201
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:58,941
All kids go to camps. She'll also...
- Mom! L'll handle this okay.

202
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:03,236
But Rahul try and understand.
L'll also go with her...

203
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:06,733
Papa I want to go, I want
to go, please papa.

204
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,931
No Anjali.

205
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:17,322
Shut up. I said no. Now
neither of you will go.

206
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,296
You felt bad? I'm sorry.

207
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:49,091
It's okay.

208
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:54,285
This doesn't mean you're going.

209
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:57,382
I'm going to the conference.
We'll talk when I get back.

210
00:21:58,581 --> 00:22:01,278
Papa.
- Now what?

211
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,176
You haven't worn your pants.

212
00:22:07,173 --> 00:22:09,770
It's okay, you wear it
if you want to.

213
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:30,449
Drivertake out the pant...
the car.

214
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:37,442
Anjali... How will we make
your father come to the camp?

215
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:45,734
Oh Granny! Rememberwhen dad was
in London and I fell sick.

216
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,632
Yes my baby.

217
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,629
Granny. Papa left everything
and came back immediately.

218
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:07,812
- Oops sorry!
- Don't worry about it man, it's okay.

219
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:14,805
Indian Exporters Conference,
good evening!

220
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:16,903
May I speak to Aman Mehra please?

221
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:20,399
Whom shall I say is calling?
- Anjali.

222
00:23:23,396 --> 00:23:25,494
Indian Exporters Conference,
good evening!

223
00:23:25,494 --> 00:23:28,491
Hello! Can I speak to papa?
- Papa?

224
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,189
Your father's not a film star.
Tell her his name.

225
00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:33,986
Sorry. May I speak to
Mr. Rahul Khanna please?

226
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:37,282
Whom shall I say is calling?
- Anjali

227
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,480
Certainly, Anjali.

228
00:23:41,578 --> 00:23:44,875
Quickly tell him we're going
and put the phone down.

229
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,168
Hi! Rahul Khanna.

230
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:07,752
Hello! Aman, I can't hear you.
- I can hear you. Tell me?

231
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:12,148
Hi sweetheart!
I'm really missing you.

232
00:24:15,644 --> 00:24:17,842
Listen, I'm off to the camp tomorrow.

233
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:20,839
- Where to?
- Summer camp.

234
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,836
Again summer camp. I said
no once to you, didn't I?

235
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:29,330
Listen. I'm feeling very...
give me a kiss.

236
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:33,626
This is your mother speaking.
- Look. I don't like these jokes.

237
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:36,124
My mother passed away
10 years ago.

238
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:38,621
Why is everyone trying to
pronounce me dead today?

239
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,418
No summer camp, no summer
camp. Understood?

240
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:43,816
Aman why are you screaming?

241
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,413
That's because I've told you,
you're not going.

242
00:24:47,113 --> 00:24:50,709
If you say one more thing,
I'll get home and... slap you.

243
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:54,305
Aman you've gone mad.

244
00:24:56,303 --> 00:24:57,902
Anjali?

245
00:24:57,902 --> 00:25:00,599
Your dad's gone mad.

246
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:04,196
Anjali?
- Anjali?

247
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:14,385
Hi! I'm Rahul Khanna.
- Aman Mehra, how're you doing?

248
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:16,583
I guess because of the same
name she got confused...

249
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,980
Bet you, my Anjali is
prettierthan yours.

250
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:24,275
No! My Anjali is very beautiful.

251
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:26,673
I'm sure but not as
beautiful as mine.

252
00:25:27,572 --> 00:25:29,970
My Anjali is my 8-year-old daughter.

253
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,266
Shit! You're right.
Your Anjali is prettier.

254
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,957
Dear Papa, How are you? Sorry
we left without informing you...

255
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:46,853
...but you know how much I love
singing and dancing.

256
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,047
Don't miss me too much.
Love Anjali.

257
00:25:55,344 --> 00:25:58,441
That's not possible for me to do...

258
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:03,236
Good Morning kids.

259
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:07,033
I am Col. Almeida, the camp manager.

260
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,129
L'll now measure your height
and weight.

261
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:16,623
24 - very nice, 30 - very good.

262
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,618
80 - very... what child is this?

263
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:25,314
Hey! Who are you?

264
00:26:26,513 --> 00:26:29,510
Me? I am Granny.
- Whose Granny?

265
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,307
Anjali's. Who are you?

266
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:35,604
Col. Almeida. Camp Manager.

267
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:40,599
No grannies', mummies' and
daddies' allowed on this camp.

268
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,496
So I should've let Anjali
come here alone?

269
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:45,494
What?

270
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:47,792
Have you seen Ms. Anjali?

271
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:49,990
Ms. Anjali!

272
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,187
What? What?

273
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:05,374
The British flag in India...?
L'll sort him out. Almeida...

274
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:14,365
You have no shame?
You've hoisted the British flag.

275
00:27:16,164 --> 00:27:18,261
I love England.

276
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,358
My fatherwas an English tailor.

277
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:25,055
He made this flag.

278
00:27:25,654 --> 00:27:28,551
Britishers went away and
left you behind.

279
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:32,048
You fool, you should teach
the kids "My Bharat is the best".

280
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:24,096
Here you go.
- Thank you.

281
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:26,194
Hey! What's your name?

282
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,087
Sorry. What's your name?
- Anjali.

283
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:36,583
Hey that's my name too. Hi!

284
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:39,880
Why is your name Anjali?

285
00:28:41,478 --> 00:28:44,176
Perhaps my parents liked
the name.

286
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:49,470
Why is your name Anjali?
- Perhaps my parents liked you.

287
00:28:56,863 --> 00:28:59,660
Where is this Almeida?

288
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:09,550
Namaste.

289
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,139
Almeida...

290
00:29:25,035 --> 00:29:27,133
I need your blessings mummy.
- Almeida.

291
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,427
Stop following me.
- Where is the kitchen?

292
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:35,724
I want to see how you cook food.

293
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:38,921
- And where is the prayer room?
- Puja has not come on duty today.

294
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,817
Prayer room, where one prays
to the lord.

295
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:46,413
We don't do that here.

296
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:48,611
What? There is no prayer
to the lord.

297
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,807
Lord? Who is the Lord?

298
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:06,593
Counting stars?

299
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,587
Counting stars?

300
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:23,876
London Bridge is falling
down, falling down... up

301
00:30:44,555 --> 00:30:47,053
Dear God, How are you?

302
00:30:47,252 --> 00:30:51,548
Please keep papa happy and see that
he doesn't miss me too much.

303
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:56,643
You know he can't do anything
without me. Okay.

304
00:30:57,942 --> 00:31:00,140
Caught you.

305
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,134
All prayers for papa,
nothing for mama?

306
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,130
Why ask God for anything for mummy?

307
00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:13,326
Why?
- She's with him.

308
00:31:13,326 --> 00:31:15,424
Whatever she wants,
she can ask for it herself.

309
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:27,912
Hey! Now go to sleep.
Sweet dreams.

310
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:40,299
Miss you papa.

311
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:50,889
Hi guys! Welcome to the
Neelam Show...

314
00:32:12,168 --> 00:32:15,264

00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:19,760
Like always we're going to do
something new and different.

317
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:23,456
Today's theme is love messages.

318
00:32:26,953 --> 00:32:28,851
Messages anyone?

319
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:31,149
I have a message.
- We've got one here.

320
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:35,344
Whom is your message for?
- Superna.

321
00:32:35,344 --> 00:32:38,741
Who is Superna.
- My girlfriend.

322
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,837
Your message?

323
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:46,433
Look Superna. Don't call me.
I've found someone else.

324
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:59,820
Hey! Another message.

325
00:33:06,014 --> 00:33:08,911
I want to give a message too.

326
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:18,501
Like the one he gave...
- And his message is for...

327
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:21,598
For Anjali.

328
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:25,994
I love you Anjali.

329
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,688
Why have you left me and gone?

330
00:33:31,888 --> 00:33:35,284
You know I feel lost without you.

331
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:39,280
Come back or else... just come back.

332
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,972
Please come back.

333
00:33:48,971 --> 00:33:51,968
Who is Anjali?

334
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:57,163
She's my 8-year-old daughter.

335
00:33:57,362 --> 00:33:59,960
She's gone to some camp in Shimla.

336
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:04,655
Neelam can you tell herto come
back? She'll listen to you.

337
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,850
Anjali... Papa really loves you.

338
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,047
Come back soon. He misses you.

339
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:16,343
Come back home. Okay.

340
00:34:54,006 --> 00:34:56,403
Mr. Khanna, meeting fortomorrow
at 11 a.m. Is confirmed.

341
00:35:02,098 --> 00:35:05,195
Hi Rahul! Party at my place
tomorrow. See you there.

342
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:09,091
Papa... aachoo.
- Cold...?

343
00:40:02,597 --> 00:40:04,795
Are you feeling okay?

344
00:40:04,795 --> 00:40:06,793
Yeah. Why?

345
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:12,987
No. You're looking... beautiful,
that's why... Saree.

346
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:23,576
I didn't know about Tina.
I'm sorry.

347
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:30,070
How could you know? You just
disappeared.

348
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:34,465
We changed our residence.
- You changed your friends as well?

349
00:40:37,362 --> 00:40:40,859
When I needed my friend the most,
you were not there.

350
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:49,650
You didn't marry again?

351
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,948
Couldn't find you... or else would
have married you.

352
00:40:56,543 --> 00:41:02,237
We live once, die once, get
married once and love...

353
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:05,234
Only once.

354
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:09,530
You didn't get married either?

355
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,327
Couldn't find you.

356
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:20,120
Hey! Look a shooting star.
- Still believe in it?

357
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:25,414
No. You?
- No.

358
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:53,386
What did you wish for?

359
00:42:17,362 --> 00:42:19,360
Granny.

360
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:23,656
What news?
- Bad news.

361
00:42:23,656 --> 00:42:25,854
They are behaving like they're
meeting forthe first time.

362
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:29,350
Good night Rahul,
Good night Anjali.

363
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,247
Now what do we do?

364
00:42:35,045 --> 00:42:37,942
You have any idea granny?

365
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,335
The solution now lies in
prayer and devotion.

366
00:42:45,534 --> 00:42:50,030
Oh Granny. Now you only
tell me what to do?

367
00:43:05,914 --> 00:43:08,411
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

368
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:11,508
Ls this what I have taught you?

369
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:13,906
Big boys don't fight, she's a girl.
- Why are you fighting?

370
00:43:13,906 --> 00:43:15,404
She hit me first.

371
00:43:15,404 --> 00:43:18,601
I just said that girls can play
Basketball and he said...

372
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,199
Boo girls can't play Basketball.

373
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,997
He said the truth and you
fought with him.

374
00:43:22,997 --> 00:43:25,894
Why! In college Ms. Anjali beat
you everyday in Basketball.

375
00:43:26,493 --> 00:43:32,188
Shh! Quiet!
Not everyday, sometimes.

376
00:43:33,686 --> 00:43:37,282
- Rahul, you lost everyday.
- Remember Anjali, you lost everyday.

377
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:40,579
Rahul, you lost everyday.
- No Anjali.

378
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:41,978
Yes Rahul.

379
00:43:41,978 --> 00:43:44,475
Don't lie in front of
the kids.

380
00:43:44,475 --> 00:43:47,572
What I'm lying?
- So am I lying? Liar.

381
00:43:47,572 --> 00:43:49,171
What?

382
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:52,567
The truth is you could only
Hey! Don't call me a cheater.

383
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:56,763
That's what you are... a cheater.

384
00:43:57,362 --> 00:43:59,760
Anjali, not cheater.
- Rahul is a cheater.

385
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:21,139
I challenge you right now,
let's play.

386
00:44:25,534 --> 00:44:28,431
Don't be silly Anjali.

387
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:31,228
Why? Are you scared Rahul?

388
00:44:34,026 --> 00:44:36,423
Rahul Khanna is never scared
of anyone.

389
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,817
We will see.
- We will see.

390
00:44:56,203 --> 00:44:59,400
I'm sure Rahul will win.
- We will see!

391
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,180
You'll lose again Rahul.

392
00:45:20,779 --> 00:45:23,476
I've been practicing for
8 years, I won't lose.

393
00:45:26,773 --> 00:45:29,470
Listen, be careful
with your saree.

394
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,562
Don't hit me.

395
00:46:04,036 --> 00:46:06,433
What was that!

396
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,654
Hey! Lf you can't play
atleast don't cheat.

397
00:47:25,654 --> 00:47:27,752
Hey! Don't call me a cheater.

398
00:47:27,752 --> 00:47:30,849
That's what you are -
a teacher... cheater.

399
00:48:57,862 --> 00:49:01,958
"There is a strange girl,
she is a dream..."

400
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:04,755
"Is she for real or a story"

401
00:49:05,754 --> 00:49:08,551
"Look at this mad one,
she's not changed"

402
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,347
"She is still the same
crazy one"

403
00:49:21,738 --> 00:49:25,634
"There is a strange boy,
he is a dream..."

404
00:49:26,134 --> 00:49:28,631
"Is he for real or a story"

405
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,627
"Yes, yes, this mad one has
not changed"

406
00:49:33,726 --> 00:49:36,223
"He is still the same
crazy one"

407
00:50:25,474 --> 00:50:28,971
"We were close and yet so far
those were strange circumstances"

408
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:39,760
"Those were strange times
when you were so close"

409
00:50:41,258 --> 00:50:48,052
"Where are you lost, I'm right
here if only you would look"

410
00:52:02,777 --> 00:52:05,274
"I was lonesome even in a crowd"

411
00:52:06,673 --> 00:52:09,370
"You were forever in my memory"

412
00:52:10,569 --> 00:52:16,963
"If someone stops me now
my heart will brim over"

413
00:52:18,361 --> 00:52:24,755
"I can't stand steady
only you can help now"

414
00:52:34,345 --> 00:52:38,441
"There is a strange girl,
she is a dream..."

415
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:41,139
"Is she for real or a story"

416
00:52:42,337 --> 00:52:45,135
"Yes, yes, this mad one has
not changed"

417
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:49,131
"He is still the same crazy one"

418
00:53:22,297 --> 00:53:28,491
"You gave me dreams"

419
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:37,183
"I am neither awake
nor asleep"

420
00:53:41,778 --> 00:53:44,575
"Somethings happen in my heart..."

421
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:52,168
"Somethings happen in my heart..."

422
00:54:03,057 --> 00:54:05,654
Mamata here's your letter.

423
00:54:06,353 --> 00:54:08,251
All your mothers are
complaining that...

424
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:11,049
you all are not writing to them and
I have complained to your mother...

425
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:14,445
...that you don't say anything.

426
00:54:17,742 --> 00:54:20,040
Everyone is going to write
home, in front of me.

427
00:54:22,138 --> 00:54:24,635
Here pass these on.

428
00:54:24,635 --> 00:54:27,532
Anjali, come on write a
letterto your mom...

429
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:05,494
If you were here, you'd be proud of
Anjali being your daughter.

430
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,587
Because she's so nice.

431
00:55:14,885 --> 00:55:17,382
She has to be, her name's
Anjali after all.

432
00:55:22,877 --> 00:55:26,174
But the best thing about
her is that...

433
00:55:28,971 --> 00:55:31,968
...she looks just like you.

434
00:55:33,766 --> 00:55:36,663
The same eyes, the same face.

435
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,038
I don't find this family
incomplete anymore...

436
00:56:06,933 --> 00:56:10,429
Hello kids! Good morning.
Are you ready?

437
00:56:11,828 --> 00:56:14,625
Say cheese.

438
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:20,020
Taking photographs without me?
Anyway I'm here now.

439
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:27,212
My saree looks nice?
- Beautiful.

440
00:56:27,912 --> 00:56:30,309
Shall I sit there?
- Come sit please.

441
00:56:33,806 --> 00:56:36,803
No not there, a little higher.

442
00:56:37,502 --> 00:56:39,900
No not there, a little higher.

443
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,897
Where is he sending me? Higher.

444
00:56:43,596 --> 00:56:47,093
Little higher. Yes.
- Shall I sit here?

445
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:53,286
How do I look?
- Fantastic, beautiful.

446
00:57:16,363 --> 00:57:18,861
What happened?

447
00:57:19,161 --> 00:57:22,357
I don't know. Something
is missing. Something wrong.

448
00:57:26,054 --> 00:57:28,351
Okay now?

449
00:57:34,945 --> 00:57:38,241
Lt's perfect. Shoot it.

450
00:57:42,637 --> 00:57:45,734
Excuse me. Now one of
just the 2 of you.

451
00:57:52,627 --> 00:57:55,125
No Mr. Almieda, enough.

452
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:57,922
Anjali, just one.

453
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:01,418
Colonel, please colonel, really.
- Come on Anjali.

454
00:58:13,606 --> 00:58:16,803
Wow! How can anyone look
so good?

455
00:58:18,002 --> 00:58:20,999
Yes! Anjali is looking
very nice here.

456
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,396
Really, I didn't even
notice her.

457
00:58:23,396 --> 00:58:29,590
Liar. She's not here so you
What to do mother-in-law?

458
00:58:32,287 --> 00:58:34,685
Aman, Since the wedding is
in December...

459
00:58:35,284 --> 00:58:36,983
...why don't you go back
to London for a while?

460
00:58:36,983 --> 00:58:39,680
I'm not budging from here.
- Why?

461
00:58:40,879 --> 00:58:43,976
I don't trust your daughter.

462
00:58:43,976 --> 00:58:47,372
She's taken forever, to agree
forthe marriage. Till we don't...

463
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:49,770
Tie the knot...
- Yes!

464
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,667
Tie the knot I'm not
going anywhere.

465
00:58:53,966 --> 00:58:56,463
You love her a lot don't you?

466
00:58:56,463 --> 00:58:59,360
No... Yes.

467
00:59:01,558 --> 00:59:06,054
But I get the feeling
she doesn't love me.

468
00:59:12,447 --> 00:59:15,045
She doesn't, right?

469
00:59:16,943 --> 00:59:20,339
Hey! Mother-in-law...
she doesn't right?

470
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:24,635
Aman, you've gone mad.

471
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,025
She didn't answer.

472
00:59:35,025 --> 00:59:37,422
Today we are going to play
a new game.

473
00:59:37,422 --> 00:59:39,021
It's called Dumb Charades.

474
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:41,518
In this game there are 2 teams.

475
00:59:41,518 --> 00:59:44,315
This is team A.

476
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:48,311
And this is team B.

477
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:54,505
One team will secretly tell
1 or2 members of the otherteam...

478
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:57,502
...the name of a film

479
00:59:58,102 --> 01:00:03,296
The players have to act
out the film

480
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:07,193
And make theirteammates
guess the name of the film.

481
01:00:08,092 --> 01:00:12,088
You can't say anything.
Simple! We'll start with team A

482
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,878
Yes! But how do I do this?

483
01:00:30,569 --> 01:00:32,467
Now look, it's like...

484
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:35,065
You can't say anything.
Cheating...

485
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:40,859
This is cheating,
you are a cheater.

486
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:45,454
Come on! Can't you do this much.
Come on.

487
01:00:56,543 --> 01:00:59,640
Yeah! Everybody yeah!
She's doing it.

01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:25,314
"The Colourful One"

489
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:27,612
Yeah! That's right.
- "The Colourful One" yes.

490
01:01:34,705 --> 01:01:41,099
You were really sexy!
- Thanks.

491
01:01:46,393 --> 01:01:48,491
No, no, no,
I can't do this.

492
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:52,487
Come on granny...

493
01:01:54,186 --> 01:01:57,382
At this age kids! No. No

494
01:01:57,582 --> 01:01:59,680
Even I don't see Hindi films,
you know.

495
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,877
I like"Gone with the wind"
- Shut up!

496
01:02:06,573 --> 01:02:08,871
Okay son.

497
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:11,268
But she's my mom.

498
01:02:11,268 --> 01:02:13,067
You go there.
- Where?

499
01:02:13,067 --> 01:02:15,065
Go there...
- Why?

500
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:18,261
Becuase I'm telling you that's why.
- Granny gone mad.

501
01:02:18,261 --> 01:02:21,059
Yeah! Now bend.
- Bend.

502
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:23,456
Like this?

Mummy... Madhuri...
"How Are We Related"

504
01:02:48,032 --> 01:02:50,729
It's my turn.

505
01:02:54,725 --> 01:02:56,024
There's no such film.

506
01:02:56,024 --> 01:02:58,721
There is papa.
- No there isn't.

507
01:02:58,721 --> 01:03:01,218
There is.
- But I haven't seen any such film.

508
01:03:01,218 --> 01:03:03,117
But, hey wait a minute.

509
01:03:03,117 --> 01:03:06,114
Ofcourse, it's a film.
I've seen it myself.

510
01:03:06,813 --> 01:03:09,710
But what is the name
of the film.

511
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:24,995
Three... three words.

512
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:33,786
Yes I've understood there
are three words, what else?

513
01:03:36,084 --> 01:03:38,881
Rahul, what are you doing?
- Your son has gone mad.

514
01:03:43,476 --> 01:03:45,674
Rahul I can't understand anything,
what are you doing?

515
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:01,358
What is it?

516
01:04:07,352 --> 01:04:10,150
I love you...

517
01:04:17,043 --> 01:04:19,540
Do it again...

518
01:04:24,136 --> 01:04:27,033
I love you.

519
01:04:33,027 --> 01:04:35,824
You couldn't do that much?
- No.

520
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,720
I wish you would've,
we would have won.

521
01:04:46,513 --> 01:04:49,910
Come on kids, hurry up get into
the barn...

522
01:05:06,793 --> 01:05:09,690
Hey give me that, thanks.

523
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:19,280
Have you gone mad?

524
01:05:22,178 --> 01:05:25,175
I'm feeling very cold.

525
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:29,970
Come with me. L'll take you
to a place.

526
01:05:57,242 --> 01:05:59,740
No music.

527
01:08:42,677 --> 01:08:44,875
I love you.

528
01:08:51,468 --> 01:08:54,565
Hey! I love you too.

529
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:05,055
Almeida you can't even
fix a leakage. Go on, go up.

530
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:08,451
Mom, did Anjali come here?
- Her she is.

531
01:09:08,551 --> 01:09:10,349
No... not this one,
the other one.

532
01:09:10,349 --> 01:09:13,147
Here hold this and help.

533
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:24,036
I want to talk with you.

534
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:32,128
You call this sty a summer camp?

535
01:09:33,326 --> 01:09:38,421
Hi guys! Hey, I know you from
somewhere.

536
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:42,018
Telephone man.

537
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:46,114
What's up dude.
What're you doing here?

538
01:09:50,409 --> 01:09:53,107
Ls that your Anjali?

539
01:09:57,502 --> 01:10:00,299
This is my Anjali.

540
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:04,795
And this, is my Anjali.

541
01:10:25,474 --> 01:10:27,872
You're just like Michael Jordan.
You're too good.

542
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:30,769
L'am not that good.
I've been beaten.

543
01:10:31,368 --> 01:10:34,066
I don't believe it... Who won?

544
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:38,561
Anjali.
- Your Anjali.

545
01:10:38,561 --> 01:10:41,358
No, your Anjali.
- My Anjali...

546
01:10:42,557 --> 01:10:45,155
She played basketball?

547
01:10:45,654 --> 01:10:50,649
Tell me, what kind of a girl
was she in college?

548
01:10:52,347 --> 01:10:54,146
She was the life and pride
our college.

549
01:10:54,146 --> 01:10:57,143
Everyone came to herwith
their problems.

550
01:10:57,143 --> 01:10:58,841
Well, nothings changed.

551
01:10:58,841 --> 01:11:02,337
Even I've come to herwith
my problem.

552
01:11:02,937 --> 01:11:05,534
What problem do you have?

553
01:11:05,834 --> 01:11:09,430
My problem is that
I love hertoo much, you know.

554
01:11:10,529 --> 01:11:12,727
I know.

555
01:11:14,925 --> 01:11:17,622
What kind of friend are you?

556
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:19,920
You didn't even come
for our engagement.

557
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,417
You're engaged?

558
01:11:24,016 --> 01:11:27,113
Yes, but with great difficulty.

559
01:11:27,113 --> 01:11:29,410
The wedding is in December,
hopefully.

560
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:34,505
Hey! Tell your friend...

561
01:11:34,505 --> 01:11:36,703
If she doesn't marry
me in December...

562
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:40,799
I'll... marry this basketball.

563
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:02,277
We live once, we die once,

564
01:12:03,576 --> 01:12:06,573
we get married once and
love...

565
01:12:24,655 --> 01:12:27,852
Men are very weak...

566
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:34,645
They make principles but
don't realise that...

567
01:12:35,145 --> 01:12:37,842
...no principle can override
the heart.

568
01:12:40,339 --> 01:12:45,135
And we remind these stubborn
weak men that...

569
01:12:45,734 --> 01:12:49,530
...bonds of the heart are based
on feelings not principles.

570
01:12:52,527 --> 01:12:55,125
But these bonds are created...

571
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:58,321
...by telling the other person
about one's inner feelings.

572
01:13:01,918 --> 01:13:04,915
Tell him what you feel Anjali.

573
01:13:08,611 --> 01:13:11,908
Sometimes saying what one feels
can break one's heart.

574
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,403
But by not saying it you won't,
be happy.

575
01:13:28,192 --> 01:13:31,089
Congratulations and
celebrations...

576
01:13:31,788 --> 01:13:34,585
...we wish Ms. Anjali a
happy wedded life.

577
01:13:36,683 --> 01:13:38,981
Congratulations and
celebrations...

578
01:13:42,078 --> 01:13:44,675
Anjali, you didn't even
tell me.

579
01:13:44,775 --> 01:13:47,872
Aman told me that you
are getting married.

580
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:52,567
Are you happy?

581
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:54,865
You are happy, aren't you?

582
01:13:54,865 --> 01:13:57,662
Having heard this, are
you happy?

583
01:13:57,662 --> 01:14:00,060
I'm very happy.

584
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,857
Then how can I be happy?

585
01:14:03,256 --> 01:14:05,654
I don't understand.

586
01:14:06,953 --> 01:14:10,749
Somethings happen Rahul,
you won't understand.

587
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:24,136
Somethings happen Anjali...
you won't understand.

588
01:14:32,028 --> 01:14:35,224
Uncle, May I ask you something?
- Sure

589
01:14:35,924 --> 01:14:38,221
Why are you marrying Ms. Anjali?

590
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:41,918
What? Why? Ls something wrong?

591
01:14:41,918 --> 01:14:46,613
Yeah! Lt's simple.
You're so handsome.

592
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:50,809
What happened?
- So good-looking.

593
01:14:50,809 --> 01:14:53,206
Oh! Thank you so much.

594
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:56,503
But Ms. Anjali is not
that good looking.

595
01:14:57,602 --> 01:15:01,099
You're right. She's dark,
fat and short.

596
01:15:03,197 --> 01:15:05,594
You know, you can get anyone.

597
01:15:05,594 --> 01:15:07,992
Anyone?
- Yes!

598
01:15:07,992 --> 01:15:11,688
Then will you marry me?
- Me? No, no, no...

599
01:15:12,687 --> 01:15:15,484
Why am I that bad?

600
01:15:15,984 --> 01:15:18,281
Then you'll have to find
me a nice girl.

601
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:20,879
Found her.
- Who?

602
01:15:20,879 --> 01:15:23,077
She.

603
01:15:27,173 --> 01:15:30,170
This MTV one? Hi!
This is the Neelam Show... Yo!

604
01:15:32,867 --> 01:15:34,865
Then what about this Anjali?

605
01:15:34,865 --> 01:15:36,363
You'll have to find someone
for hertoo.

606
01:15:36,363 --> 01:15:38,861
Found him.
- Found him?

607
01:15:38,861 --> 01:15:41,558
Shall I tell you?
- No, no, no...

608
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:45,055
Please, let me tell you.
- No, no, no...

609
01:15:46,853 --> 01:15:49,850
I want to leave tonight itself.

610
01:16:31,808 --> 01:16:34,505
Goodbye Mr. Almeida

611
01:17:13,266 --> 01:17:16,064
You're leaving?

612
01:17:19,161 --> 01:17:21,858
Please don't go.

613
01:18:33,286 --> 01:18:37,782
You gave this to Tina when
she was beginning a new life.

614
01:18:42,078 --> 01:18:45,274
Today you are going to begin
a new life...

615
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:54,765
...and I am sure, you and Rahul
Start preparing forthe wedding.

616
01:19:52,008 --> 01:19:54,205
I don't want to wait anymore.

617
01:19:54,205 --> 01:19:57,602
But Guruji said that there is no
auspicious date before December...

618
01:19:58,102 --> 01:20:03,496
Mother, dates don't bring
happiness, destiny does...

619
01:20:05,494 --> 01:20:08,391
...and no one can change that.

620
01:21:26,613 --> 01:21:29,011
Look! Aman's here and
that too on a mule.

621
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:39,001
Bindya... Panditji has come. Leave
everything and look after him.

622
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:49,091
You are Rahul, right?
- Yes, Anjali and I...

623
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:51,888
I know.

624
01:21:51,888 --> 01:21:53,886
Anjali is getting married today?

625
01:21:55,784 --> 01:22:00,779
Yes. She decided to get married
so suddenly that...

626
01:22:01,678 --> 01:22:05,175
...I didn't get any time to
prepare...

627
01:22:05,474 --> 01:22:11,268
Yes, I'm coming.
Please sit, I'll just be back.

628
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:21,458
Anjali!

629
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:25,554
They say if you make a
wish on a shooting star...

630
01:22:26,253 --> 01:22:29,151
...it comes true...

631
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:02,837
The auspicious time is running
out, please call the bride.

632
01:26:04,136 --> 01:26:06,433
Anjali.

633
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:11,528
The auspicious time is almost
over, please call the bride.

634
01:26:14,725 --> 01:26:17,622
Anjali, let's go.

635
01:27:06,773 --> 01:27:09,570
L'll drag you to the marriage
pandal, I told you so didn't I?

636
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:13,806
You know, I always wanted to see
that love in your eyes...

637
01:28:15,504 --> 01:28:18,301
...that I have in mine.

638
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:24,196
Today, I've seen it,
but it's not for me.

639
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:31,588
You're mad Anjali.
You've always loved him

640
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:38,082
Eversince you've known love,
understood love...

641
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:42,577
...You've loved only him.

642
01:28:42,777 --> 01:28:45,774
Rahul is your first love...

643
01:28:47,772 --> 01:28:50,769
...and no one understands
first love more than I do.

644
01:28:56,763 --> 01:29:01,758
You were going to give this
all up for me? Stupid!

645
01:29:05,254 --> 01:29:08,152
How can I come between
this love...

646
01:29:10,449 --> 01:29:13,346
...that was never mine
in the first place?

647
01:29:17,642 --> 01:29:19,740
And anyway, someone told
me that...

648
01:29:20,339 --> 01:29:23,536
...I'm so handsome,
I can get anyone.

649
01:29:37,822 --> 01:29:40,819
Aman I...
- What are you saying...?

650
01:29:54,805 --> 01:29:57,302
Go...

651
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:05,494
Go...
