1
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,444
Welcome back to

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,811
<i>Eye on East Hills</i>
<i>with Jon Howard.</i>

3
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,213
Look, people think

4
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,443
that sports is fair,
you know,

5
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,007
just 'cause it got
rules and stuff.

6
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,783
You know,
but is it fair that,

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,187
you know,
Chinese people are short

8
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,953
or, you know, we have fewer
fast-twitch muscles in our legs?

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,460
How do you explain
Yao Ming then?

10
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,259
Yao Ming is a statistical
anomaly, all right?

11
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,460
You take a country
of 1.3 billion people,

12
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,333
you're sure to have a few
hundred tall ones, right?

13
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,895
And out of that few hundred,
you know,

14
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,237
you're bound to have at least
one or two that can play ball.

15
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,536
Statistical anomaly.

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,134
Never seen Charlie Chan.

17
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,405
Never forget Vincent Chin.

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,003
I'm 'bout to drop
some knowledge on you.

19
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,378
Let the lesson begin.

20
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,280
Now, I'ma teach
this assignment in slang,

21
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,251
brother, change
the whole world to see shit

22
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,877
like <i>The Eye</i>
by the Pang brothers.

23
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,854
Asian American
who ain't afraid to say

24
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,413
comparing me
to David Carradine

25
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,391
will get you set ablaze
with kerosene.

26
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,291
I don't call
television racist,

27
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,262
but I do watch <i>The Simpsons</i>
and <i>SpongeBob</i>

28
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,264
just to see
some yellow faces.

29
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,357
I take the yellow haters
down like elevators.

30
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,527
Left hand on your girl.

31
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,627
right foot
on the accelerator.

32
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,728
You ain't laughing at that.

33
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,330
I'm that new type of Asian.

34
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,102
I'll let you
do the math on that one.

35
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,404
I'ma teach you who's me

36
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,001
'cause I'm the Bruce Lee
of loose-leaf,

37
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,046
the Donnie N. of rhyming,

38
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,478
and the Jackie Chan
of rapping, man.

39
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,108
Orient Express coming through!

40
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,981
Forget what you think you know.

41
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,542
I'll teach
your ashes a lesson.

42
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,850
Listen and learn
and don't ask me no questions.

43
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,448
Wake up, kids, and keep
your eyes in my direction.

44
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,117
Welcome
to my Chinese school.

45
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:38,722
Class is in session.

46
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,412
You're awesome.
You should be in the NBA.

47
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,509
My name's Felix.

48
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,712
Good for you.

49
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,186
Hey, hook me up
with some of that, man.

50
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,620
Shot was off.

51
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,318
The big guy made a
bunch of lucky shots anyway.

52
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,121
W-w-wait, hold up, dog.

53
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,526
Hey, you want
to run that back?

54
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,327
Ball.

55
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,832
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

56
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:16,994
Come on,
what you gonna do?

57
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,264
Come on.
Come on.

58
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,238
You ain't got it.
You ain't got nothing.

59
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,833
Ah, get some!

60
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,142
Ah, stuffed like a turkey!

61
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,181
Booyah!

62
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,042
I don't think so.

63
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,553
Go play piano!

64
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,919
Access denied!

65
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,321
Access denied!

66
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,052
Ah, access denied!

67
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,286
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>you want some of this?</i>

68
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,555
Yeah, get him!

69
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,597
Where you going?
Where you going?

70
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,689
Where you going?
Where you going?

71
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,698
Where you going?

72
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,463
That's where you're going.

73
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,765
Who's lucky now, huh?

74
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,567
What you looking at?

75
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,679
Aw, yeah.

76
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:01,714
Yeah, you better step off.

77
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,976
Hey, this is my neighborhood.

78
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,176
Who's the master?

79
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,275
You are.

80
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,717
And what's my name?

81
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:08,754
Chris?

82
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,788
Call me C-Dub.

83
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,983
And what time is it?

84
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,355
3:35.

85
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,485
Dog, dog, when I
ask you what time it is,

86
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,621
you're supposed to say
"game time," all right?

87
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,755
Wait, wait,
what time is it?

88
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,128
Game time.

89
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,293
No, no, no, on the
reals, man. What time is it?

90
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,335
3:35.

91
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,461
Mother-

92
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,769
All right, man,
I'm sorry I'm late, man.

93
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,040
There was this big-ass accident
on the 305, man.

94
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,911
This mofo was speeding,
picking his nose, man.

95
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,110
His ass ran, pow, right into
the back of a chicken truck.

96
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,482
Man, I saw blood.

97
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,578
<i>There was glass, blood,</i>
<i>feathers, everywhere, man.</i>

98
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,917
<i>I'm telling you, J.P.,</i>

99
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,254
you should've seen
this <i>wang ba dan,</i> man.

100
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,351
He might as well have been down
on his hands and knees.

101
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,395
He was begging me to stay.

102
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,861
I swear on the grace

103
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,488
of 18 generations
of my ancestors, man.

104
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,930
I ain't gonna be
late again.

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,025
All right, you can't get
a better guarantee than that

106
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,364
from a Chinese brother.

107
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,064
You know what
you had to do, right?

108
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,105
Don't playa-hate.

109
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,162
Negotiate.

110
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,674
For sure, so check it.

111
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,267
This fool starts talking fast
about bonuses, vacation days.

112
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,972
Man, he tried
to straight-up bribe me.

113
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,843
I'll give you my autographed
Michael Jordan jersey, man.

114
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,075
You know how much
that's worth?

115
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,343
Really?

116
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,180
All right, maybe I ain't
going to give you that,

117
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,118
but, hey, I'll give you
my Larry Johnson jersey.

118
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,348
Who?

119
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,287
You know, UNLV, Charlotte
Hornets, Grandma-ma.

120
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,155
Come on, man.
I'll wash your car, man.

121
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,352
Right, r-r-r-right.

122
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,394
So you had to show him

123
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,895
who was the real
<i>lao fan,</i> huh?

124
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,329
Oh, man, you know it, baby.
Set the record straight.

125
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,197
We ain't building railroads
for free no more, you hear?

126
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,701
Hey, man, how you
going to reach out

127
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,897
to your Asian customers, man?

128
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,166
Hey, they feel me,
feel me, man?

129
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,798
There's like 2 million of us
in L.A., man.

130
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,433
How you going
to communicate with them?

131
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,534
Wilson?

132
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,111
I was thinking, man.

133
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,980
Can't be wasting all my time
working for the man.

134
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,076
Right.

135
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,415
You know that comic book
I was working on,

136
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,046
the one with the gun-toting,
crime-fighting pandas?

137
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,454
That's where I need
to devote more of my time.

138
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,515
Yeah, and don't forget
about our T-shirt company.

139
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,026
That's what I'm saying, man.

140
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,721
And then
there's the casino.

141
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,491
Aw, can't
forget the crown jewel.

142
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,031
Cha-Ching Dynasty.

143
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,066
Booyah.

144
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,362
Hey.

145
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,800
Make money, money,

146
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,928
make money, money, make.

147
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,528
You know what the Donald says?

148
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,836
Ah, wait, you can't fire me, dog.

149
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,207
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, 'cause I quit.

150
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,918
Hm.

151
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,940
Oh, you're too polite.

152
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,535
I'm just a lousy player.

153
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,843
Not everybody can play
like that guy.

154
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,214
Hey, Pa, I fixed your modem.

155
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,378
<i>You should really think</i>
<i>about going wireless, though.</i>

156
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,512
It's a lot faster.

157
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,556
Hey, Michael,
you remember Mr. Lin?

158
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,681
Oh, of course.

159
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,288
Tournament's coming up.

160
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,886
You training hard?

161
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:04,930
Not that you need to.

162
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,430
You could probably win
blindfolded.

163
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,693
I'm just very lucky.

164
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,166
I definitely
should practice more.

165
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,135
Oh, I don't see how
you could find the time.

166
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,796
I got a nephew
in residency at General.

167
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,134
They're killing him
over there.

168
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,072
Well, my hospital's
definitely going to kill me

169
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,268
if I don't get back
right now,

170
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,469
so... good to see you.

171
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,808
- See you later.
- Pa.

172
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,370
Bye.

173
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,451
William?

174
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,287
He's too lazy...

175
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,385
and fat.

176
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,639
Ah, tell Mike, man.

177
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:03,841
He ain't doing nothing.

178
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,247
Doing nothing?

179
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,547
Yeah, but he don't have to work
on Saturday morning.

180
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,989
All right, all right,
all right!

181
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,156
<i>Ow.</i>

182
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,566
What up, playa?

183
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,936
<i>Oh, man, what time is it?</i>

184
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,499
Time for you
to get your ass up, homey.

185
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,135
Man, aren't you supposed
to be in school?

186
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,236
<i>Yeah, it's recess.</i>

187
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,575
Hey, you need
to get down here.

188
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,548
No can, man, I told the dads
I was going to work.

189
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,380
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

190
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,386
I'll tell him later, man.
No biggie.

191
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,046
<i>All right, but don't complain</i>

192
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,215
when everybody tells you
they seen the new ride.

193
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,317
Hold up.
You got a new ride?

194
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,361
I'll see you in a minute.

195
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,261
Sweet.

196
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,020
thud!

197
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,197
Ow.

198
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,173
Oh, shit.

199
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,904
Man, I was going
to tell you later, man.

200
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,107
I mean, you and Mom
have been bugging me

201
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,710
to lose that lame-ass job
anyway, right?

202
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:49,777
Hey, so check it out, man.

203
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,288
I got an email
from my friend Ian

204
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,053
about how his friend opened up
an online clothing store, man.

205
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,491
He works from home, man.

206
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,155
He makes like a few thousand
dollars, man, every month, man.

207
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,596
I said, "Hey, let me key in
on some of that."

208
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,293
And then,
you know Henry, right?

209
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,427
Hey, he self-published
this comic book last month.

210
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,061
I'm going to talk to him
about that too.

211
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,936
I mean, he got, like, his own
website and everything, man.

212
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,999
Yo, you feeling me
on this?

213
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,044
Mr. Waaang?

214
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,942
It's Wang, dog.

215
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:14,945
I'm sorry, "Wong."

216
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,538
Wang, not Wong.
Wang.

217
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,708
- "Wong."
- Wang.

218
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,273
- "Wong."
- Wang.

219
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,320
- "Wong."
- Is she all right?

220
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,354
<i>Good news.</i>

221
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,683
<i>Your wrists</i>
<i>are just sprained.</i>

222
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,724
<i>You'll need</i>
<i>to take it easy for a while.</i>

223
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,955
You can start physical therapy
in a couple weeks.

224
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,018
Just goes to show you

225
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,792
you can never be
too careful driving.

226
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,356
Wait, wait, hold up, dog.
What's that supposed to mean?

227
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,799
Excuse me?

228
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,359
You just assume that just
because my moms is Chinese

229
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,404
that she's a bad driver?

230
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,769
Like she couldn't break her hand

231
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,637
gardening or baking pies,
some Martha Stewart shit.

232
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,800
Hey, that's straight-up
racialism, dog.

233
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,002
You better have
malpractice insurance.

234
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,305
I just read her chart.

235
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,937
It said
"car accident" on it.

236
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,538
Yeah, so?

237
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,106
This is for the pain.

238
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,482
The nurse
will sign you out.

239
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,523
Ow.

240
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,190
I'm okay.

241
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,701
They gave you
ibuprofen, huh?

242
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,170
We should make sure
you get the good stuff, okay?

243
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,467
We'll get you Vicodin, Ma.

244
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,190
Oh, wait a minute now.

245
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,292
People always think that,
you know, Chinese people,

246
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,700
all they're good at are math,

247
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,567
martial arts,
and mu shu pork, you know?

248
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,131
But basketball, hey, that was
really my thing back in the day,

249
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,176
you know what I'm saying?

250
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,006
I used to play
on the JV squad.

251
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,444
Booyah.

252
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,276
<i>They called me</i>
<i>The Orient Express.</i>

253
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,680
They call me The Orient Express
for more than one reason.

254
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,945
You know what I'm saying?

255
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,146
Feel me, man?
Feel that?

256
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,246
Actually, I don't.

257
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,381
<i>Uh...</i>

258
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,465
A, B, C.

259
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,626
A, B, C.

260
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,795
A, B, C.

261
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,805
A, G, C.

262
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,171
A, B, C.

263
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,369
Superstar.

264
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,413
Nerds.

265
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,475
Yeah, homeboy
was on the news last week.

266
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,986
Supposed to be
some kind of genius.

267
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,646
So when we going
to play some ball, man?

268
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,918
Oh, no, man.
I got that thing later.

269
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,324
Oh, that's right.
Ping-Pong.

270
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,622
When you gonna get
a bowl cut?

271
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,390
I'm just helping out my moms, man.

272
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,432
Kick her while she's down,
why don't you?

273
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,492
You're in Ping-Pong too?

274
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,094
No, dog,
I ain't in Ping-Pong.

275
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,196
I'm teaching Ping-Pong.

276
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,433
Awesome!

277
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,873
I'm in that class!

278
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,391
This it?

279
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,722
Yep.

280
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,126
All right, all right.

281
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,825
What's going on,
everybody?

282
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,197
<i>Come on over.</i>

283
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,268
Is it true that
Coach Wang broke ten bones?

284
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,274
I heard they
had to cut off her arm.

285
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,105
What are you smoking?

286
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,371
All y'all need to know is,

287
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,208
I'm going to be teaching
for a little while.

288
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,247
Who are you?

289
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,907
I'm Chris,
but call me C-Dub.

290
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,746
Are you the guy that wins

291
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,945
the Ping-Pong tournament
every single year?

292
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,112
No.

293
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,120
But isn't Coach Wang
your mom?

294
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,679
That's her other son.

295
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,317
Yeah, better get that straight.

296
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,951
- What's your name?
- William.

297
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,325
Free Willy,
listen up.

298
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,624
Don't ask stupid questions,

299
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,290
and you won't get
stupid answers.

300
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,425
All right, the rest of y'all,
come up here real quick.

301
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,230
Put a check
next to your name.

302
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,533
Hey, what's your name again?

303
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,573
Felix.

304
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,471
F-Bomb, hey.

305
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,941
What's the deal
with the white boys?

306
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,944
<i>Coach Wang lets them practice here.</i>

307
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,912
<i>They're, like, pros</i>
<i>or something.</i>

308
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,676
All right, whatever.

309
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,651
<i>So what y'all</i>
<i>normally do?</i>

310
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,449
We usually warm up first.

311
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,488
Coach Wang always says-

312
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,750
Ah, t-t-t-t.

313
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,519
Don't just stand there
and tell me about it.

314
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,889
Step to it.

315
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,969
We're done.

316
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,970
20 forehands
and 20 backhands each.

317
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,300
Well, good for you.

318
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,431
Now do another 20.

319
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,235
Make that 30.

320
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,479
Aw, yeah.

321
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,357
What's up, playa?

322
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,950
Oh, I see you got
your eye on that.

323
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,188
So what's the holdup?

324
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,854
Aw, man, you can't just run up

325
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,330
and start
humping her leg like a dog.

326
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,230
You got to be
like a tiger, man.

327
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,893
You got to stalk the prey.

328
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,130
You got to wait for it
and then...

329
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,502
bam,
pounce on that shit.

330
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,438
Yeah, I feel you on that, man.

331
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,773
<i>I feel you.</i>

332
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,436
Hey, what you up to, man?

333
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,674
Joe put that issue of <i>Hellboy</i>
on hold for me.

334
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,874
Aw, man, I got to work.

335
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,939
On Saturday?

336
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,177
Work sucks, man.

337
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,947
Oh, I forgot.
You wouldn't know.

338
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,282
Ah, it's like that, huh?

339
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,982
I help you out
with your Chinese homework,

340
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,115
and this is how
you repay me?

341
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,624
Don't worry.

342
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,957
When I'm making my millions
in the exploding China market,

343
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,053
I'll be sure to cut you in
on a little RNB.

344
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,495
Yeah, you better.

345
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,260
Oh, hey, keys.

346
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,392
How long?

347
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,936
Brother's car
is still in the shop.

348
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:12,971
Later.

349
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,369
Take care of my baby.

350
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,551
My rims keep shining,
and my paint keeps chipping.

351
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,786
My rims,
m-my, my rims keep shining.

352
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,727
My rims keep shining,
and my paint keeps chipping.

353
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,993
My rims,
m-my, my rims keep shining.

354
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,364
My rims keep shining,
and my paint keeps chipping.

355
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,834
<i>So glad you came by.</i>

356
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,564
<i>Well, I was in the neighborhood.</i>

357
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,469
<i>I wanted to step in</i>
<i>and check on things.</i>

358
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,303
<i>Just give him a few more days.</i>

359
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,367
<i>He's starting to practice</i>
<i>a little already.</i>

360
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,244
Well, everyone at the ATTF
will be happy to hear that.

361
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,079
It's always a treat watching
Michael defend his title.

362
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,709
About the sponsorship...

363
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,414
We can talk about
it once Michael's recovered.

364
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,014
And I hope Mei
is feeling better too.

365
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,251
Just goes to show you,

366
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,318
you can never be too careful
when driving.

367
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,954
Excuse me.
How much are these?

368
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,998
'Cause I'm kind of
in a hurry.

369
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,157
Well, I can see you're busy.

370
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,633
I'll call you later.

371
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,329
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

372
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,568
Hey, I ain't the rude one.

373
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,337
Cheryl Davis
is the regional director

374
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,072
of the table tennis federation.

375
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,670
So? It don't give her the right

376
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,147
to perpetuate
racial stereotypes.

377
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,547
What do you want?

378
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,086
Ma, I don't know
if I can teach that class.

379
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,150
That's not
what I'm talking about.

380
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,451
It's boring, man.

381
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,083
I ain't trying to coach
no Bad News Bears.

382
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,758
Come on, man.
It's not my thing.

383
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,264
Make Michael
teach the class then.

384
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,465
Hey, I play sports,
not games.

385
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,497
The Chinese, we're the masters
of Ping-Pong.

386
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,702
You always say
Chinese this and Chinese that,

387
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,438
but all you want to do
is play basketball.

388
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,072
Do you see any Chinese people
playing in the NBA?

389
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,308
As a matter of fact-

390
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:33,970
<i>China!</i>

391
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,494
Man, are you still trying to
play in that stupid tournament?

392
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,692
Everything's always stupid
to you, isn't it, Chris?

393
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,064
That's 'cause I know you, man.

394
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,866
You just want to go
to that dumb-ass parade.

395
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,667
I can see your future,

396
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,074
and you are not going on a date
with Miss Chinatown.

397
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,545
It's not about
Miss Chinatown.

398
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,206
You just love
the Miss Chinatown, though.

399
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,977
Well, at least
I've got standards.

400
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,416
Is that what you're calling
the Ten Commandments these days?

401
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,078
There are only eight, Chris.

402
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,352
You find an Ivy League graduate
who's over 5'6",

403
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:23,019
can sing, run a six-minute mile,
and look good in a bikini,

404
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,323
and is interested in you,

405
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,490
there's still
something wrong with her.

406
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,195
You think that's why I play
in the tournament every year?

407
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,830
Does Yao Ming
like Chinese food?

408
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,204
Oh, my God,
you're so stupid.

409
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,505
Listen, genius,
this is how it works, okay?

410
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,102
I play in the tournament.
Then I win the tournament.

411
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,704
Now, all the Chinese parents
out there,

412
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:43,839
they get really excited,

413
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,781
and they put their kids
in our classes,

414
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,875
which Mom teaches.

415
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,852
Then they buy
the gear in our store.

416
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,515
And ultimately, that gives us
money to pay for the Wheaties

417
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,387
you stick up your ass
every morning.

418
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,948
<i>It is Marketing 101.</i>

419
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,120
Wow, did you come up
with that yourself?

420
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,595
Shut up.

421
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,531
Chris, you need to get a job.

422
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,794
<i>And I'm not talking about</i>

423
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,063
<i>hawking cell phones</i>
<i>at the mall, okay?</i>

424
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,570
I'm talking about a real job,

425
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,003
so you can make
some real money

426
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,938
so you can move your ass
out of the house

427
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,203
<i>and maybe just stop living</i>
<i>over the garage</i>

428
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,472
like some sort
of yellow Fonzie.

429
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,377
<i>There's some admin work</i>
<i>over at the hospital.</i>

430
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,779
All the time I've known you-

431
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,874
No, I ain't going to work
in no hospital, please.

432
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,510
Well, dude,
figure it out, okay,

433
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,283
'cause I'm tired of hearing it
from Ma and Pa all the time.

434
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,584
Well, now you know
how I feel.

435
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,454
No, I don't, 'cause this
is not my fault, Chris.

436
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,585
Hey, this whole effed-up
situation is your fault.

437
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,562
Oh, please, elaborate.

438
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:36,032
You're just
a terrible driver, dog.

439
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,068
Ow.

440
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,193
That was going in, man.

441
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,294
You ever see you drive, huh?

442
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,668
- At least I got a car.
- Ma!

443
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,933
<i>Yeah, call for Mama.</i>

444
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,100
"Stop."

445
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,200
<i>Ow.</i>

446
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,074
Yeah, homey.

447
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,705
You don't think if I was 7'6"
like Yao Ming,

448
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,375
that I wouldn't be dunking on
fools all over the place, man?

449
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,715
I mean, even if I was just 6'6",
you know?

450
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,482
I mean, and not to say that
if I was black or white that,

451
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,683
you know, I'd be the next,
you know, Kobe Bryant

452
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,022
or Manu Ginobili,
you know, but-

453
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,086
all I'm saying is that I'd be
at least a Moochie Norris,

454
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,926
you know, or at least
a Mark Madsen,

455
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,364
at the very least,
you know?

456
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,560
Chinese people
are just not meant

457
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,228
to be tall, man,
you know?

458
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,068
We're good at badminton,
fencing, stuff like-

459
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,630
I don't know.

460
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,176
You know, like gymnastics
and shit, man, Ping-Pong.

461
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,211
Ah!

462
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,225
Man, we should be running
some ball right now, feel me?

463
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,260
I feel you.

464
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,726
Take it from me, man.

465
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,059
Unless you want to become
the Chinese Napoleon Dynamite,

466
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,098
get out of Ping-Pong.

467
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,132
Got it?

468
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,496
Got it.

469
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,330
I'm just here
'cause my moms is hurt.

470
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,132
<i>Otherwise, I'd be taking it</i>
<i>to the hole, man,</i>

471
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,195
<i>crossing fools over.</i>

472
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,639
<i>Did I ever tell you about that</i>
<i>championship game at district?</i>

473
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,041
<i>Man, it was awesome.</i>

474
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,601
<i>There was this</i>
<i>half-court shot, man.</i>

475
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,477
<i>It was like football field</i>
<i>delivery, man.</i>

476
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,879
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

477
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,612
Chubby, let me show you
the backhand serve.

478
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,987
<i>Ah, hey, I got this. I got this.</i>

479
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,526
Sure thing, coach.

480
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,618
Free Willy, man,
you working too hard, man.

481
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,721
You don't need to swing it
like a baseball bat, man.

482
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,666
Just chop it, all right?

483
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,702
Thanks.

484
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,361
That's awesome.

485
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,735
Teach me too.

486
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,967
Class is over, F-Bomb.

487
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,508
What did I tell you anyway?

488
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,010
You better start working
on your jump shot.

489
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,410
Please?

490
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,375
I'll give you $10.

491
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,527
Whoo!

492
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,570
Game over, man, game over.

493
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,537
Again. Again.

494
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:55,834
Aw, come on, man.

495
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,068
I got to get going.

496
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,043
Please?

497
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,739
All right,
you talked me into it.

498
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,405
Yes.

499
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,212
You have a reputation for
being sort of hard on the children.

500
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,808
Why is that?

501
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,150
Look, I'm just trying
to keep it real, all right?

502
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,087
I'm trying to teach them
life lessons, you know,

503
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,148
so they don't have to go
through all the pain

504
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,591
and humiliation and suffering

505
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,594
that I had to go through,
you know what I'm saying?

506
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,357
What do you
mean by "suffering"?

507
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,922
You know, man, you think
my parents supported my dream

508
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,934
of becoming the first
Chinese player in the NBA?

509
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,970
Man, hell, no, man,
it was always about, you know,

510
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,699
"Go study, hit the books,"
man, "Go play violin."

511
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,332
And you feel that held you back?

512
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,671
Hell, yeah, man.

513
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,075
I mean, dude, look at
my one Chinese brother, man.

514
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,546
His parents made him play the
accordion for ten years, man.

515
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,105
Look at what happened to him.

516
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,411
What happened?

517
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,418
Homey's in
tech support now, man.

518
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:45,081
It hurts me, dog.
It hurts me.

519
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:48,718
I'm sorry.

520
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:49,886
Don't touch me.

521
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:56,629
Aw, yeah.

522
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,692
Hey.

523
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,499
What you doing?

524
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,699
Man, I'm just trying
to holler at some honeys.

525
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,832
Feel me?

526
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:04,967
You mean that girl?

527
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,442
Hey, don't point like that.

528
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,308
That's not a honey.
That's my sister.

529
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,347
For real?

530
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,711
Damn, man, all this time,

531
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,579
why didn't you tell me
your sister was a hottie?

532
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,879
Ew.

533
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,647
Hey, she isn't
one of those girls

534
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,880
that only dates white boys,
is she?

535
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,922
You want to help
a brother out?

536
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,320
Okay.

537
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,882
Just tell your
sister about Ping-Pong class

538
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,825
and how cool your teacher is
and stuff, all right?

539
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:24,884
All right.

540
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,396
But don't be obvious or nothing.

541
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,262
Just tell her, like, you know,
how your day went and all that

542
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,493
and your teacher
just happens to be

543
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,728
this really cool guy; got it?

544
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,531
Oh, good-looking too.
Don't forget that.

545
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:33,571
And good at basketball.

546
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,832
Got it.

547
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,170
All right. My ninja.

548
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,544
My ninja.

549
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,839
I want it.

550
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:53,180
You deserve it.

551
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,015
<i> A- Train, hand over that PSP
and go with B-Diddy over here.</i>

552
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,487
Hey, what did I tell you about
eating dried squid in class?

553
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,081
Man, you got
to take that outside.

554
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,125
That's him.

555
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,092
He's awesome.

556
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,565
What you doing, dog?

557
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,262
That's Henry.
He's from Manila.

558
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,827
Yeah, so?

559
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,271
He said he's better
than everyone at Chinese school.

560
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,366
That's why he doesn't
take Ping-Pong here.

561
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,808
I said you could beat him.

562
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,073
Come on, man.
I got a class to teach, man.

563
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,672
Plus, you know I haven't really
played in a little while.

564
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,182
Please?

565
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,719
I'll give you some money.

566
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,084
Ooh.

567
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,452
What if I lose?

568
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,320
You can still have it.

569
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,518
All right, hold up a second.

570
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,925
<i>Free Willy,</i>
<i>Adam.</i>

571
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,595
What you doing, dog?

572
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,726
Don't you know that "boba"
is Chinese for "boob"?

573
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:45,735
You know why?

574
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,032
You drink enough of it,

575
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,333
that's what you're
going to get, man boobs.

576
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:49,771
Is that what you want?

577
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,503
Is it?

578
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,340
All right, you're going
to be my scorekeeper.

579
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,437
Watch and learn,
all right?

580
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,640
All right.

581
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,085
Game over, sucker.

582
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,456
<i>Kablamo!</i>

583
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:10,789
We showed him.

584
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,992
All the way back
to Chan Marino.

585
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,034
You got any more friends?

586
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,569
You got to
rock to the rhythm with 'em.

587
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,012
Got to give it to 'em.

588
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,981
Got to give a lot more
than the minimum.

589
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,677
Rock to the rhythm
with 'em.

590
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,844
Got to give it to 'em.

591
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,183
Got to give a lot more,
more, more.

592
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,517
Yo, wake up,
wake up.

593
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,648
It's a new day now.

594
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,918
Side step, right, left,

595
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,425
move when I break down.

596
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,518
How I get down?

597
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,085
Make 'em all sit down.

598
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,724
Either that or have them
hurrying to skip town.

599
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,267
Yeah, you're just like
good tobacco,

600
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,202
<i>'cause I just put you</i>
<i>in my pipe and smoked you.</i>

601
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,363
There you go.

602
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,374
Yeah, hey,
time to go to bed, old man.

603
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,606
Thanks for your business.

604
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,309
A pleasure to serve you.

605
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,350
Who's next?

606
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,385
That's it.

607
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,749
That's it?

608
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,447
Come on, man.
That's like barely 30 bucks.

609
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,513
Man, where are
all your rich friends?

610
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,830
You got something to
say, come say it to my face.

611
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,093
You're a real boon
to the sport of table tennis.

612
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,567
You're using your mom's class
to hustle suckers.

613
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,796
What did you say
about my mama?

614
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,428
All he's saying is,
maybe these students

615
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,166
deserve someone
a little more qualified.

616
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,571
Oh, you know,
all right, let's go.

617
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:31,973
Come on, what you want
to play for?

618
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,843
Please; whatever happened
to playing for sport?

619
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,205
All right,
you know what?

620
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,911
I got a few minutes
to kill.

621
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,754
Booyah.

622
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,559
Take my coat.

623
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,064
Oh, that's a bad China word.

624
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,795
Okay, first to 11 wins.

625
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,030
Skunk at 7.

626
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,984
- Come on, C-Dub.
- Do it. Booyah!

627
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,523
Two more points.

628
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,751
<i>I think I smell skunk.</i>

629
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,417
<i>Smells pretty good to me.</i>

630
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,961
Sorry, chum.

631
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,825
I got some more important
business to attend to.

632
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,524
Oh, he's walking away.

633
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,861
Gee, I'm shocked.

634
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,595
F-Bomb, finish
up with this fool.

635
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,364
Can we switch scores?

636
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,632
No.

637
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,764
<i>Hi, how you doing?</i>

638
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,932
<i>Hi.</i>

639
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,767
Yeah, I seen you around.

640
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,107
You play Ping-Pong?

641
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,807
Are you the instructor,

642
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,816
the guy that's been stealing
my brother's allowance?

643
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,146
Oh, wait, wait, hold on.
No, no, no.

644
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,185
You got the wrong dude.

645
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,379
That's the guy you want.

646
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,081
<i>That kid?</i>

647
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,851
<i> He's like a
Ping-Pong prodigy or something.</i>

648
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,391
- I'm serious.
- Really?

649
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,086
Yeah, he was on the news
the other day, man.

650
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,061
News lady said he's, like,
a genius or something.

651
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,118
Okay, thanks.

652
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,207
I like, I like, I like cereal.

653
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,841
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

654
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,545
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

655
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,179
Don't put the box away;
I'm about to have me some more.

656
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,553
My favorite kinds
was made by Meneral Gills.

657
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,990
Big spoon, big bowl,
I got minimal spills.

658
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,357
I ain't finished
about yet.

659
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,452
In a minute,
I will.

660
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,053
While I'm
getting my cartoon,

661
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,621
it comes
from cinema thrills.

662
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:37,065
I be watching <i>Master Killer</i>
chomping 'Zilla Vanilla.

663
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,763
Maybe grape, that's the one
that had the purple gorilla.

664
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,203
I crunch,
Chumpster Hunch Munch,

665
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:42,762
watch the Dukes
doing stunt jumps.

666
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,435
Christopher...

667
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,004
Christopher?

668
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,073
You got to be kidding.

669
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,243
Why not?

670
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,650
He has enough
free time now.

671
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,709
Ma, no way.

672
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,777
No way.

673
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,119
All he does is play video games
and read comic books all day.

674
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,186
No way.

675
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,195
Ma, this wasn't my fault.

676
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,536
Booyah!

677
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,819
Man, I'm telling you, man,

678
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,651
if I was just
one inch taller, man,

679
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,248
I'd be dunking
all the time, man.

680
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:40,730
Tomahawk, windmill, 360-degree
peanut butter and jam sandwich.

681
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:41,992
Uh!

682
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,897
<i> Yeah, so we going to
run another game or what?</i>

683
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,131
<i>We can take these jabronis.</i>

684
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,434
<i>Can't. I gotta go.</i>

685
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,474
Where?

686
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,532
Birthday party.

687
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,043
I don't even want to go.

688
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,272
Well, then, don't go.

689
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,540
My sister's making me.

690
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,047
Man, and another thing, man.

691
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,845
Why you have to go all off
and tell your sister

692
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,044
about what we were doing, man?

693
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,416
I thought we was tight.

694
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,148
You said to tell
her about Ping-Pong class.

695
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,452
That means telling
her that you play Ping-Pong,

696
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,185
not that you
play Ping-Pong for money.

697
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,420
Just tell her that you made
all that up, all right?

698
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,759
I'm not as good
at lying as you are.

699
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,695
Hold up; Why you
got to be hurtful, man?

700
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,233
I'm not asking you
to lie, man.

701
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,462
I'm just asking you
to finesse the truth.

702
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:19,525
You got it?

703
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,696
Okay.

704
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,366
So where
this party at, man?

705
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,807
<i>Geometrically speaking,</i>

706
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:36,217
<i>the probability of striking</i>
<i>all ten pins is highest</i>

707
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:40,189
when the ball enters formation
at a 35-degree angle.

708
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,950
<i>That didn't work.</i>

709
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:47,020
Perhaps I should
try launching with more force.

710
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,402
thud!

711
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:58,564
It's a shame,
isn't it?

712
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,577
What's that,
the nerds?

713
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,237
Matter of speaking, yes.

714
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,746
The birthday boy guy,

715
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,079
he's the biggest nerd
of them all.

716
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,051
Yes, my son,
the biggest nerd.

717
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,315
Oh, I didn't mean it
like that.

718
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,857
No, no, no,
it's quite all right.

719
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,517
It's a thing
with my son.

720
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:18,687
What good is it being able to
play Rachmaninoff at age six

721
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,754
<i>if you don't have</i>
<i>an audience to play for, huh?</i>

722
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,663
<i> Hey, man, I don't
mean no disrespect,</i>

723
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,396
but he ain't going to make no
friends warming a piano bench.

724
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,596
You know what I'm saying?

725
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,571
You have a point.

726
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:29,697
Oh, D.B. Reddy.

727
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:30,741
C-Dub.

728
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:31,866
I'm here
with my boy, Felix.

729
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:32,910
Oh.

730
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,103
Speak of the devil.

731
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,440
What's up?

732
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,413
Yo, yo, yo.

733
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,683
Yeah, F-Bomb, eh,
this is Prabakar's dad.

734
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,155
Hello, Felix. Welcome.

735
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,691
Please,
make yourself comfortable.

736
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,090
There's some
pepperoni pizza.

737
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,525
<i>Cool, thanks.</i>

738
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,994
Amazing.

739
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,223
This boy,
he is your...

740
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,764
That's my basketball homey.

741
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,629
Oh, you're his basketball teacher.

742
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,669
Uh, I actually
teach him Ping-Pong

743
00:33:58,736 --> 00:33:59,964
at the Chinese school.

744
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,199
Ah, is that
your primary occupation?

745
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,968
No, no, no.

746
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,942
I'm actually getting ready
to start up a business

747
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,204
with a friend of mine,
you know?

748
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,768
We're going to press
some comic books,

749
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:09,904
start our own clothing line.

750
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,539
You know,
entrepreneurial-type stuff.

751
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,345
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

752
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,385
Yeah.

753
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,443
I was just like you
starting out,

754
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:20,218
less than $100 in my pocket
when I came from India.

755
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,418
And now I own
my own textile company.

756
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,551
That's tight, man.

757
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,061
That's like
kitchen tiles and stuff?

758
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,653
Oh, no, no, no.

759
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,894
Textiles as in fabric
for clothing and shoes.

760
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,298
Oh, oh, my bad.

761
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,667
No, it's quite all right, my friend.

762
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,433
Well, I wish you luck
in your endeavors.

763
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,167
I think you have
what it takes.

764
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,538
Yo, for real?

765
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,837
You think
I could roll like you?

766
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,675
Listen, most people
underestimate

767
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,274
the social skills needed
to succeed in business.

768
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,978
Prabakar doesn't need
more math classes.

769
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,611
He needs to learn
to socialize,

770
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,452
to be a kid.

771
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,991
Yeah, so I ask you,

772
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,186
would you take on my son
as one of your disciples?

773
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,593
Disciple?

774
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,655
Yeah!

775
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,064
I like the sound of that.

776
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:11,341
Prepare for practice games,
y'all.

777
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,502
What do I do,
Coach Chris?

778
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,567
Call me C-Dub.

779
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,634
- l-
- Oh, you know what?

780
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,044
I got a better idea.

781
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,104
Call me <i>sifu.</i>

782
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,649
Yes, <i>sifu.</i>

783
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,550
I've done some studying
on the physics of table tennis.

784
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,485
Practice. Don't talk.

785
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,852
See that over there?

786
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,390
That's for you.

787
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,688
Practice until you can hit it
back to yourself ten times...

788
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,159
That should be quite-

789
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,196
In a row.

790
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,408
I've been watching you.

791
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,975
I think you could be
a brilliant paddler.

792
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,020
Paddler?

793
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,646
It's Felix, right?

794
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,247
Yeah.

795
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,758
Your forehand smash
could use a bit of tinkering,

796
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,920
and your teacher's
been rather busy.

797
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:09,490
<i>Anyway, I am opening a new</i>
<i>school in a couple of weeks,</i>

798
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:10,556
all brand-new tables.

799
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,603
You should come down,
check it out.

800
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,694
Here, you know what?

801
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,261
Take a couple.
Put them in your pocket.

802
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,306
Give them to your parents.

803
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,671
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

804
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,040
Don't be passing out no porno
to none of my kids, yo.

805
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,544
No worries, m'laddo.

806
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,842
Just offering a little friendly
advice to my buddy here.

807
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,849
Yeah, we ain't buying
your opium around here.

808
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,351
Sure thing,
Chrissie.

809
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,977
Booyah!

810
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,384
'Sup with
Prince Charles, man?

811
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,924
You got a question
you can't ask me?

812
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,391
I can't smash it like you.

813
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,427
Let me see.

814
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,462
Free Willy,
balls.

815
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,791
All right.

816
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,794
Dog, you got no
energy in your swing, man.

817
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,496
Pull your arm
back like this.

818
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,402
Angle it down like that,
all right?

819
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,700
Now swing away,
all right?

820
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,765
Like that,
okay?

821
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,175
Free Willy,
come on, man.

822
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,271
You're going to get chocolate
all over the balls, man.

823
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,647
Ain't you tell me your dad
sent you here to lose weight?

824
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,515
Then why you keep bringing
candy to class, man?

825
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,918
I got a rep to uphold.

826
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,253
All right, just remember
what I showed you

827
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:11,818
and keep flapping
them back, okay?

828
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,333
All right,
here we go.

829
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,698
<i>Remember that angle.</i>

830
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:19,793
<i>There you go.</i>

831
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,030
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>smack that sucker.</i>

832
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,333
<i>Tell that white boy</i>
<i>who's boss.</i>

833
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,566
Ow.

834
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,244
Speaking of the competition,

835
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,045
are you entering
Miss Chinatown this year?

836
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,086
Because if you
don't mind me saying so,

837
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,917
you're certainly
beautiful enough to win.

838
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,481
<i>C- Dub in the hizzouse.</i>

839
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:46,690
Yo, J.P., money,
money, money, money, money.

840
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,924
What's up?

841
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,967
Speaking of which,
I was just telling my boy Felix,

842
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,628
we got a little cash money game
going on across the street.

843
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:53,727
Some of my boys
swinging by.

844
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:54,771
Come run with.

845
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,170
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, man.

846
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,264
I just finished class, man.

847
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,365
Hold up.

848
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,603
Now you too tired
from playing Ping-Pong?

849
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,043
Coaching, dog.

850
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,478
Responsibility's tiring.

851
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:07,108
Always one good excuse
after another from balling, man.

852
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,617
I haven't seen you
on a court since JV.

853
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,483
Aw, man, come on,
you know that ain't true, man.

854
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,784
You're too busy working
to see me in action anyway.

855
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,552
Come on, Orient Express.

856
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,922
I mean,
this is easy money.

857
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,154
It's just my boy Kev
and a bunch of old geezers.

858
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,787
Really? Like how old-old?

859
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,058
Man, I don't know.

860
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,362
They're like grandpas
and shit.

861
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,459
My bad, homey.

862
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,527
All right, fine. Let's roll.

863
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:31,234
This is a wake-up
call to all my hustlers on the block

864
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,503
trying to make some ball.

865
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,601
See, I told
you, dog. We got this.

866
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,374
J.P., what's up, boy?

867
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,005
What's up, homey?

868
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,277
This is my boy, C-Dub,
I was telling you about.

869
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,751
J.P. tells me about
this last-second shot you hit

870
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,344
at district
back in the day.

871
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,821
Yeah, back in the day.

872
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,152
$30 to the winner, right?

873
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,851
Yo, $30.
You still owe me In-N-Out.

874
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,791
Oh, we gonna
serve you a Double-Double.

875
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,351
Just you wait.

876
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,624
Yo, let me hydrate first.

877
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,665
Then we run.

878
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,131
Whatever.

879
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,861
Hey, yo, man, I just
want to let you know, man,

880
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,300
I haven't played
in a couple weeks.

881
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,270
Felix said
you played last week.

882
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,705
Don't sweat it, playa.
You got this.

883
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:04,968
All I'm saying is, man,

884
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,873
can't expect my regular
20-10 game, that's all.

885
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,072
When we clean these
fools out, Cinnabon's on me.

886
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:14,015
Cinnabons, baby.

887
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,993
Yo, I wish
I was a little bit taller.

888
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,288
I wish I was a baller.

889
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,693
I wish I had a girl
who looked good.

890
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,025
I would call her.

891
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,190
Wish I was a baller.

892
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:30,256
I wish I had,
I wish I had a 6-3 Impala.

893
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,460
Got to get tall.

894
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,729
Got to touch trees.

895
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,271
Got to show my hometown
it ain't anything.

896
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,671
Got to live large
with a black car.

897
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,370
Got to get my mom and dad
a brand-new yard.

898
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:43,004
Let's pretend I was seven-tré,
built like a tree

899
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,480
and a guy from east end,
and my man, Yao Ming,

900
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,109
got more bottle
'cause I'm living tall Gs.

901
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,619
I'll be a model
for a can of green beans.

902
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,384
You think it's funny,
but it ain't when you're broke.

903
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,516
It's like that
when the alarm is reset.

904
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,788
Try and sign a deal
but don't drop the soap.

905
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,262
If I roll a few feet,
then I know that there's hope.

906
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,231
I wish I was
a little bit taller.

907
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,459
I wish I was a baller.

908
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,831
I wish I had a girl
who looked good.

909
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,869
I would call her.

910
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:06,994
I wish I was a baller.

911
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,699
I wish I had,
I wish I had a 6-3 Impala.

912
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,264
Yo, I wish, wish, wish.

913
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,708
Wish, wish,
wish, wish.

914
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,919
Dad, dude, calm down, man.

915
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,590
Take it easy, man.

916
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,962
That money's
for you and Mom, man.

917
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,398
I was saving it
to fix the car, man.

918
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,891
Michael don't even
have a girlfriend, man.

919
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,195
He's always trying to get
them ugly-ass Miss Chinatowns.

920
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,236
But he has a good job.

921
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,361
And he's responsible.

922
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,428
I'm running your class,
ain't I?

923
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,269
What else I got to do,
become Ping-Pong king?

924
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,077
Yeah, right.

925
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,618
Okay?

926
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,281
<i>Fine.</i>

927
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,696
They're never cute.

928
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,322
They always
look like newscasters

929
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,094
<i>cruising for prom dates.</i>

930
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,930
<i>Hey, remember</i>
<i>that cross-eyed one last year?</i>

931
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,663
<i>Hey, she looked</i>
<i>like a Chinese Lassie.</i>

932
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:55,761
Oh!

933
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,284
Nice mailbox.

934
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,585
Nice ride.

935
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,421
Zero to 30
in 8-flat.

936
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,461
Mm-hmm.

937
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:19,894
So I'm telling you, man.

938
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,932
She's just mad jocking me
from the start, man.

939
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:22,966
How's that?

940
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,024
The eyes, smoldering.

941
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,969
Genius child-prodigy
Ping-Pong teacher, huh?

942
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,603
Yeah.

943
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:32,664
That was kind of funny.

944
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,638
Yeah, so is Felix home?

945
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,706
What do you want?
He's doing his homework.

946
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,808
All right, playa, so you
got your game face on, huh?

947
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,046
Yeah, so you know,
she's all up in my grill, man,

948
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,145
trying to get up close, man.

949
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,655
And I said,
"Wait a damn minute now."

950
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,715
No one takes a ride
on the Orient Express

951
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,783
without paying
for a ticket.

952
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,852
I just wanted to give
the little man his money back.

953
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,522
Got caught?

954
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,225
Hey, look, lady,
I'm just trying to be nice.

955
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,665
I won that money
fair and square.

956
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:00,135
You think taking money from
old people and third graders

957
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,866
is fair and square?

958
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,204
Come on, she gonna take a ride
on the Orient Express?

959
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,266
Hey, wait, don't go jumping
the line now, man.

960
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,710
First, all right, she starts
giving me the sweet talk, right?

961
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,010
Talking about how little F-Bomb
looks up to me and shit.

962
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,073
Aw, that's so sweet.

963
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,812
You know, I
tried to get my parents

964
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,285
to make him
stop going to your class,

965
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,753
but he convinced them
you're, like,

966
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,016
his best friend
or something.

967
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,182
F-Bomb said that?

968
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,452
Just shows
how mature you are.

969
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,357
Your best friend is still
in elementary school.

970
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,363
You're so funny.

971
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,989
You're just lucky
he's the only boy in our family.

972
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,363
My parents spoil him.

973
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,265
Yeah, well, maybe they know
what's good for him.

974
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,770
Hey, better me teaching him than
some pasty Hugh Grant wannabe.

975
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,135
<i>Yeah, I saw</i>
<i>y'all talking to him.</i>

976
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,401
Hey, we don't talk to no...

977
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:39,669
They are the enemy.

978
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,768
Please, like I chose
to have him breathing on me

979
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,403
and shoving his flyers
in my face.

980
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,107
Someone's got to put
that guy on a bus.

981
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,376
Hey, I feel you
on that.

982
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,815
So why don't you,

983
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:50,149
if you're so offended
by him taking your students?

984
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,346
Well, maybe I will.

985
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,389
Good.

986
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:53,423
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

987
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,855
- All right.
- Get on it.

988
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:56,756
Hey, I'm on it.
Feel me?

989
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,124
No, thanks.

990
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,426
Hey, you know, we got
some room in the class

991
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,125
if you want
to swing on by, you know?

992
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,725
Or I could give you some
private lessons on the side.

993
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:08,431
You and me
and Ping-Pong.

994
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,530
We could leave F-Bomb
at my mom's house.

995
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:14,065
If my sorry-ass manager
don't lay off the Saturdays-

996
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,475
No, I don't-
What's this?

997
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,672
My treat, dog.

998
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,305
Well, I like
the sound of that.

999
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,713
Oh, sure.

1000
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,182
Nice.

1001
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:24,345
Hey, you know, I let you down
on the court the other day, man.

1002
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,218
These are good
when they're hot, man.

1003
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,190
Absolutely.

1004
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,953
Listen, I
didn't want you to think

1005
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,392
I was pulling
a Latrell Sprewell,

1006
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,724
so I didn't say nothing.

1007
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,696
My knee was acting up, man.

1008
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,699
Yeah, well, ain't no thing.

1009
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,826
Those guys were just better,
that's all.

1010
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,096
Those geezers?

1011
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,694
Hey, come on, man,
be real.

1012
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,000
You know if my knee
was 100% -

1013
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,065
Your knee has
never been 100%, man.

1014
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,770
What's that supposed to mean?

1015
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,472
You just ain't a baller, man.

1016
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:51,980
Man, if you mad about
losing that money, man, hey-

1017
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,381
Dude, I knew I was
going to lose that money.

1018
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:55,645
You set me up, man?

1019
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,981
Double betting
on the side, man?

1020
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,078
Come on, money.

1021
00:45:58,155 --> 00:45:59,588
You know you can count me
in on that-

1022
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,715
No, dog, it's not like that.

1023
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,054
I was just trying
to help you

1024
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,685
face up to
your real skills, that's all.

1025
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:05,956
My real skills?

1026
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,462
Yeah, look, we tight and all,

1027
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,556
but if I got to hear
about your genetic disadvantage,

1028
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:11,396
otherwise I'm gonna be
in the NBA bullshit

1029
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:12,594
one more time,
I swear to God,

1030
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,193
I'm going to have to
kill somebody.

1031
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,568
I mean,
even if you're 8 feet tall

1032
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,004
with a 12-pack, man,

1033
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,008
you ain't never going
to be no Kobe Bryant.

1034
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,670
Come on.

1035
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,872
What?

1036
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,245
Hey, C,
come on, man.

1037
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,527
<i> Hey, you got something
to say, just say it, man.</i>

1038
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,831
I just think you should
cut the wannabe crap, man.

1039
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,371
I mean, we're still
going to be homies.

1040
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,303
Hey, you think this is
about impressing you, man?

1041
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:51,568
Look at you, man,
salary man,

1042
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,473
9:00 to 5:00,
tied to the desk,

1043
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,307
playing ring around
the water cooler.

1044
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,677
You the one always talking
about the next big scheme, man.

1045
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,046
And Mr. Entrepreneur
don't even have a business card.

1046
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,209
I see.

1047
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,946
So the best defense
is a good offense, huh?

1048
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,612
Look, all I'm saying, man,

1049
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,519
better a wannabe
than a bean counter.

1050
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:07,989
Better a bean counter
than a loser.

1051
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,856
Hey, a loser is someone who
gives up the game, all right?

1052
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:13,089
No, no, a loser's somebody
who's got so many excuses

1053
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,892
they never get in the game
in the first place.

1054
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,330
Hey, you really
want to play this?

1055
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,867
How about this then?

1056
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,096
A loser's someone who takes
Chinese class for three years

1057
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,138
<i>and is still scared to order</i>
<i>dinner at Panda Express.</i>

1058
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:23,571
What?
Who?

1059
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,335
<i>What? You think I'm afraid</i>
<i>to use my Chinese?</i>

1060
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:26,376
Yeah.

1061
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:30,038
Wait.
Read my lips.

1062
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,549
Dog, dog, dog.

1063
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,279
What?
What'd I say?

1064
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,412
Are you trying to tell me
my basketball stinks?

1065
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:39,614
Yeah, and?

1066
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,351
All right,
try this, man.

1067
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,394
Right, right.

1068
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,465
Hey, dog,
that's harsh, man.

1069
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,662
That's just harsh.

1070
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,039
Sifu, <i>I read in my book</i>

1071
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,240
about the topspin
you have to put on the ball

1072
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,806
in order for it to have
a higher probability-

1073
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,614
Dog, before you start fretting
about topspin,

1074
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:10,914
you have to actually
hit the ball first.

1075
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,250
Ah, so one must-

1076
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,311
Ah, t-t-t-t.

1077
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:18,787
Unscrew it.

1078
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,295
That's what I'm trying to do.

1079
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,388
It's, like, welded.

1080
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,126
Unscrew the top.
Unscrew the top.

1081
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,724
- I tried the top.
- No, the other top.

1082
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,701
Listen, guys, you want to start
your own school?

1083
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,794
No problem.

1084
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,498
But you cannot take
our students.

1085
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,801
It's a free country.

1086
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,171
Kids can choose
their own school.

1087
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,607
Yeah, it's a free country.

1088
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,372
My wife
lets you practice here.

1089
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:36,912
You cannot do this.

1090
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,744
Can't handle a
little friendly competition.

1091
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,010
Fine.

1092
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,415
We'll go.

1093
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,386
I'm sick of watching
these kids waste their time

1094
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:45,819
with Conan the babysitter
anyway.

1095
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,117
If they want real training,

1096
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,919
they'll come learn
from the real masters,

1097
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,961
the ones who invented
table tennis.

1098
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:01,204
The Chinese invented Ping-Pong.

1099
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,535
Still smoking the opium, old man?

1100
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,904
That's so sad.

1101
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,540
Don't come back again.

1102
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:26,863
Hey, yo, Wonder Bread.

1103
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,363
Hey, you got a problem
with my family,

1104
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:29,524
you take it up with me.

1105
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,328
You know, I feel for your old man.

1106
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,301
One son's a champion
with a bum wrist,

1107
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,235
and the other one
is, um, you.

1108
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,330
Hey, you come back here again,
and I'm going to show you

1109
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:38,999
my fists of fury in closeup,
for real.

1110
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,600
I don't need to come back here,

1111
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,201
because after
I win the Golden Cock,

1112
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:45,510
those kids are going to be
begging me to teach them.

1113
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:46,571
You know what?

1114
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,049
You can take
your dumb-ass school

1115
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:49,585
and your raggety-ass fliers

1116
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,817
and shove them up
your motherfuckin' ass.

1117
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,414
Spoken like a true gentleman.

1118
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,723
You know, I fancy a good parade
every now and then,

1119
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,355
don't you, Tom?

1120
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:04,559
Plus, I hear Miss Chinatown,
hot this year.

1121
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,177
All right, look,
I'll do it,

1122
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,736
but you got to train me.

1123
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,182
Michael's Ping-Pong tournament,
I want to play.

1124
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,014
Come on, man, don't pretend
like you don't know

1125
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:24,144
what I'm talking about, man.

1126
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,620
I heard y'all
talking in the kitchen

1127
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,815
about how
you want me to play.

1128
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,054
I just want you to know
I'm willing to represent.

1129
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,353
What?

1130
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,163
The store?

1131
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,730
Hold up; you don't think
I got the chops

1132
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,469
to hold down the store?

1133
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,839
Man, I could work
the cash register, Dad.

1134
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:50,937
I'm not an idiot.

1135
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,039
Don't worry.
We'll manage.

1136
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,414
Yeah, how?

1137
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:56,975
I mean,
no one in our family plays.

1138
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,043
No one represents.

1139
00:50:58,121 --> 00:50:59,816
Mom don't get students.

1140
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:00,822
You don't get sales.

1141
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,882
But you don't need my help.

1142
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,120
Fine.

1143
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,560
Man, I can't remember
the last time

1144
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,892
I came up with an idea

1145
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,455
and you said,
"Good idea, Chris."

1146
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,831
Hey, remember that time

1147
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,097
<i>you connect the TV</i>
<i>and the massage chair</i>

1148
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,139
with the remote control?

1149
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:17,639
That was pretty good.

1150
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:19,072
Man, whatever.
Forget it.

1151
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,439
I'll train myself.

1152
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,357
Yeah.

1153
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,435
Why did you have to cancel class?

1154
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,033
Sorry, grasshoppers.

1155
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,942
I can't be honing my skills
at the same time

1156
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,377
I'm teaching y'all
Ping-Pong 101.

1157
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,709
So? We'll watch you.

1158
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,908
No can do.

1159
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:01,644
Then we'll help you.

1160
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,379
No disciple
would abandon his <i>sifu.</i>

1161
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,182
Look, that's all good, Prabakar,

1162
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,382
but this calls for ninja mode,
not <i>sifu</i> mode.

1163
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,152
I got to work on my drills,
skills, and kills.

1164
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,626
See, I can't be stopping
to take attendance.

1165
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,287
Why not?
Why can't we run with?

1166
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,456
Dude, calm down.
You'll survive.

1167
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,464
No, we won't.

1168
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:17,864
<i>If you cancel classes,</i>

1169
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,732
my mom will make me
take calligraphy.

1170
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,965
My parents will
put me in S.A.T. prep.

1171
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,028
<i>S.A.T. prep?</i>

1172
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,574
You in, what,
like sixth grade?

1173
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,371
Fourth.

1174
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:28,911
For me,
language lab.

1175
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,173
Brush painting.

1176
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,339
Origami.

1177
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,813
Folk dance.

1178
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:33,815
Music theory.

1179
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,044
Flower arranging.

1180
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:36,517
- Computer camp.
- Test camp.

1181
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:37,917
- Mental math.
- Abacus.

1182
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,979
- Boys' choir.
- Boys' choir.

1183
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:42,786
- Boys' choir.
- Boys' choir.

1184
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,531
All right, fine.
Let's roll.

1185
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,408
What happens if you get stuck
with this loan

1186
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:12,812
for more than one year?

1187
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,713
This is
an adjustable rate mortgage.

1188
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:32,993
<i>I have a friend</i>
<i>at City Federal...</i>

1189
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,730
<i>I think it's actually</i>
<i>a little bit better.</i>

1190
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,398
Okay, game over,
grasshoppers.

1191
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,681
I already
played a bunch of people.

1192
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:24,742
It works.

1193
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,420
Hey, a point
is a point.

1194
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,563
Don't worry about it.
I'll manage.

1195
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,263
I'll work it out.

1196
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,607
Why not now?

1197
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,340
Christopher,
I'm going to train you.

1198
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,143
Really?

1199
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:54,308
What about the store?

1200
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,375
Mom can handle it.

1201
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,557
Deal?

1202
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:02,886
All right,
but as part of the deal,

1203
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,290
I don't want
to hear no complaining

1204
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,419
from you or mom either.

1205
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:06,985
I mean, you know,
nothing about the job,

1206
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,223
you know,
still living at home,

1207
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,765
where's his girlfriend,
none of that.

1208
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,824
- Come on, man.
- No way.

1209
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,266
All right,
all right, all right.

1210
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,495
Swing it, baby.

1211
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,371
Swing it, baby.

1212
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,433
Let me take you higher, swing it.

1213
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,240
I got
that good foot moving.

1214
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,780
Just gotta love
the way I swing.

1215
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,782
Girl, move, don't stop;
keep moving.

1216
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,545
Let me teach you
how to swing.

1217
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,245
Hey, I got
that good foot moving.

1218
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,912
Just gotta love
the way I swing.

1219
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:33,956
Girl, move, don't stop;
keep moving.

1220
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,388
Here we go.

1221
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,618
Hey, here we go.

1222
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,785
Let's move.

1223
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,453
Here's a kid
who learned to swing.

1224
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,053
Getting love
when trouble swings.

1225
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:42,564
Got you in the mood,
I'm like red wine.

1226
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:44,497
Swing, baby, swing,
'cause tonight you're mine.

1227
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,194
Let me make your whole world
start to spin.

1228
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:48,066
You're spending the night
with an African.

1229
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:49,571
I'm on the good foot
as long as I can.

1230
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,300
Swing, baby, swing,
let's swing, let's go.

1231
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,711
Have fun,
We're done, done, done.

1232
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,804
Now stop.

1233
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,322
Let me teach you
how to swing.

1234
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,981
Hey, I got
that good foot moving.

1235
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:10,025
Just gotta love
the way I swing.

1236
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,560
Girl, move, don't stop;
keep moving.

1237
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,255
Let me teach you
how to swing.

1238
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,263
Hey, I got
that good foot moving.

1239
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,958
Just gotta love
the way I swing.

1240
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:18,694
Girl, move, don't stop;
keep moving.

1241
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,759
Come on,
teach me how to swing.

1242
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,236
I got my body moving.

1243
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,000
Just gotta love
the way I move.

1244
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,802
Boy, move, don't stop;
keep swinging.

1245
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,570
Come on,
teach me how to swing.

1246
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:29,544
I got
your body moving.

1247
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,136
Just gotta love
the way I move.

1248
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,045
Boy, move, don't stop;
keep swinging.

1249
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,050
Swing, baby, swing.

1250
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,585
Swing, baby, swing.

1251
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,451
Oh, tell 'em.

1252
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,185
I'm still not clear

1253
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,955
on the reason you chose
Ping-Pong over basketball.

1254
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,326
Wait, look, look, look.

1255
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:50,264
I didn't choose Ping-Pong
over nothing, all right?

1256
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,631
Okay, well, it just
seems like an odd decision.

1257
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,226
What is that supposed to mean?

1258
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,033
Well, I mean, we've been talking,

1259
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:58,335
and it seems like you're
trying to buck the stereotype

1260
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:02,469
of the Asian community,
yet Ping-Pong seems...

1261
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:06,140
Wait, like, I can't get
in touch with my roots and stuff?

1262
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,184
My family owns
a Ping-Pong store, you know?

1263
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,513
I mean, what do you even know

1264
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:12,783
about the Asian or the Chinese
experience anyway, man?

1265
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:15,120
I mean, what's the last time
you even had Chinese food, man?

1266
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,216
As a matter of fact,
I had some last night.

1267
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:18,260
It was B.S. Chang's.

1268
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,295
It was a delightful meal.

1269
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:20,852
B.S. Chang's?

1270
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,331
Dog, B.S. Chang's is about as
Chinese as Charlie Chan, man.

1271
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,561
B.S. Chang's
ain't no real Chinese.

1272
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:30,436
Charlie Chan isn't Chinese?

1273
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,940
Is that true?

1274
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,637
You a dumb-ass motherfucker,
you know that?

1275
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,922
Man, I'm getting it in,
ain't I?

1276
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:03,266
<i>Sifu,</i> do we have
to drill again after wind sprints?

1277
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:07,867
Yo, I'm training just like y'all, man.

1278
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,377
Come on, little homies,
what's up?

1279
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,879
- Ping-Pong's not fun anymore.
- Yeah.

1280
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,040
Well, y'all ain't coming here
to have fun.

1281
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,276
You're here to learn.

1282
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,942
Well, I'm tired of learning.

1283
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,283
Can't we still, like,
play games or something?

1284
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,542
Pull a little something.
This is how we does.

1285
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:45,638
Follow step, step,
but you catch a buzz.

1286
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:46,909
At the back of the pool,

1287
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,416
we be jigging
till we nauseous.

1288
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:51,317
Acting a dance fool
like no one's really watching.

1289
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:22,246
Do that, do
that, do that, do that, do that.

1290
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,616
Nine to five,
overdrive.

1291
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:27,178
Do that, do that,
do that, do that, do it.

1292
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,314
Dance.

1293
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,380
Dance.

1294
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,723
Do that, do that,
do that, do it.

1295
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:45,666
I know, man,
I know.

1296
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,239
Come on, dog, man,
it's just-

1297
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,541
Dog?

1298
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,111
It's just an expression-

1299
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:02,315
Come on,
I'll practice an extra hour now.

1300
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:05,691
Okay, just serves, okay?

1301
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,365
Dad!

1302
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,766
You didn't
bring him back on-

1303
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,832
Where's the bike?
Hit a fire hydrant?

1304
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:21,899
Very funny.

1305
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:25,744
You know, it did
make you look taller.

1306
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,339
I went to the mall after class.

1307
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:31,251
Thanks, like he's not
spoiled enough at home already.

1308
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,685
Later.

1309
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:35,724
Hey, what happened to Mr. Smack?

1310
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,589
Just ain't in the mood.

1311
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,458
Mmm.

1312
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,656
Stressed out, huh?

1313
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:42,993
Stuff with your brother,
right,

1314
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:44,624
taking his place
in the tournament?

1315
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,168
How you know about that?

1316
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,465
My brother talks
about you all the time.

1317
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,768
It's not like I'm even trying
to win this thing for myself.

1318
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,068
I'm doing it
for my family, man.

1319
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:53,802
Ain't doing it so I can get
no stupid parade

1320
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:56,436
and ride around with
Miss Chinatown and shit.

1321
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,104
God, I hate that
Miss Chinatown shit.

1322
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,149
Yeah.
Yeah.

1323
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:03,708
It just perpetuates the whole
idea of the exotic Asian women.

1324
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,686
I mean, half the people
that go see Miss Chinatown

1325
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,052
aren't even Chinese.

1326
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:09,091
Yeah, I feel
you on that. I feel you.

1327
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,251
You know, a lot of those girls
don't even speak Chinese.

1328
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:12,453
Serious?

1329
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,120
That's what
my whole dissertation is on,

1330
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,597
the objectification and
exoticizing of Chinese women.

1331
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,133
Oh, that's tight.

1332
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,668
So you in college, then?

1333
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,862
Grad school.

1334
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,531
Asian-American studies.

1335
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:24,732
Cool.

1336
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:29,273
Anyway, I got to go make Felix
ingest some protein.

1337
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:30,607
Thanks for bringing him back.

1338
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,669
No worries.

1339
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:37,809
Oh, are you going to
the tournament next weekend?

1340
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,684
Um, dissertation.

1341
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:47,128
But maybe I'll try to make-
stop by.

1342
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:12,084
What?

1343
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:22,493
Christopher.

1344
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:35,533
Oh, hell no.

1345
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:40,644
All right, look, man,
hey, I said

1346
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,149
I was going to play
in the tournament,

1347
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,981
but I didn't agree to wear
no damn Daisy Dukes.

1348
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:45,111
Daisy what?

1349
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:46,621
Man, why I got to wear those?

1350
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,850
This is standard
Ping-Pong clothes.

1351
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:50,358
All competitors
wear these.

1352
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:52,053
Man, Michael
didn't have to wear these.

1353
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,061
Son of a bitch.

1354
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,986
It's Cheryl,
not Shee-lo,

1355
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:21,580
Cheryl Davis,
regional administrator.

1356
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:23,716
Regional administ-

1357
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:26,193
You can just say
I'm the boss.

1358
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,422
You understand boss,
right?

1359
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:29,521
Boss?
Right?

1360
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:30,623
You know,
"You're fired!"

1361
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,099
Boss.

1362
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:08,670
Hey, man,
make sure your sister

1363
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,569
don't see me in these
tight-ass shorts, man.

1364
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,631
And I don't mean like
tight-tight, you hear me?

1365
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:13,902
Word.

1366
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:15,273
Look.

1367
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:16,436
That's tight, man.

1368
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:17,911
My ninjas.

1369
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:25,919
- Dog-
- Not one word.

1370
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:27,216
What are you
doing here anyway?

1371
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,882
You going to tell me
my Ping-Pong stinks?

1372
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,482
Now, come on, man.

1373
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,459
I came here
'cause I got your back.

1374
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,996
<i>Round one will begin in five minutes.</i>

1375
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:42,595
<i>Competitors, please report</i>
<i>to your tables.</i>

1376
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:46,233
All right, man,
let's do this thing.

1377
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:52,470
Aw, yeah,
what's up?

1378
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:12,659
Whistling here,
whistling there.

1379
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,532
Whistling
almost everywhere.

1380
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:16,298
Whistling up,
whistling down.

1381
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,465
Whistling while
I turn around.

1382
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,031
Whistling here,
whistling there.

1383
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:21,701
Whistling
almost everywhere.

1384
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,972
Whistling up,
whistling down.

1385
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:25,673
Whistling
while I turn around.

1386
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,140
I can't believe it.

1387
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,507
One motherfuckin' match,
and it's already over.

1388
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:56,875
Prince Charles
is going to win.

1389
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:58,174
Maybe I'll see you later?

1390
01:06:58,247 --> 01:06:59,578
What's that supposed to mean, man?

1391
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,115
Like you're trying
to kick me while I'm down?

1392
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,980
Like you think that just
'cause you win one stupid game

1393
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:04,917
that you're like my master
and commander or something?

1394
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,454
<i> No, no,
that's not what I meant.</i>

1395
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,080
<i> You think that</i>
<i>just 'cause I'm Chinese</i>

1396
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,852
<i>that I'm going to be a passive,</i>
<i>non-aggressive motherfucker?</i>

1397
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:10,914
Hey, hold me back, man,
hold me back.

1398
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:12,324
Please, I just meant that maybe

1399
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:13,919
I'll see you later
in the elimination round, man.

1400
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:14,963
Come again?

1401
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,430
The first half of the day, man,

1402
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:17,693
round robin, man,
round robin.

1403
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:19,701
- You mean I'm still in?
- Yes.

1404
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:23,102
Dog, why
didn't you just say so?

1405
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,577
Whistling here,
whistling there.

1406
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,589
Whistling
almost everywhere.

1407
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:43,420
Whistling up,
whistling down.

1408
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,392
Whistling while
I turn around.

1409
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,088
Whistling here,
whistling there.

1410
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:49,131
Whistling
almost everywhere.

1411
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,722
Whistling up,
whistling down.

1412
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,064
Whistling while
I turn around.

1413
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,672
<i>First elimination begins in ten minutes.</i>

1414
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,406
<i>All scorers report</i>
<i>to officials' table.</i>

1415
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,684
You can't expect
him to change overnight, Ma.

1416
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:56,230
<i>The good thing is, he's finally</i>
<i>following through for once.</i>

1417
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,890
Hey, that was-
that was in, man.

1418
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,696
<i>Hey, it glanced off</i>
<i>the side of the table, man.</i>

1419
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:00,996
<i>Did you see it</i>
<i>change angle, man?</i>

1420
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,469
<i>Dude, it glanced</i>
<i>off the table, man.</i>

1421
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:04,062
<i>Did you see it?</i>
<i>It changed angle, man.</i>

1422
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,505
Didn't you see it?

1423
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:06,541
Give me that.

1424
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:07,871
Come on, Chris.

1425
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:09,205
Go back and change
the score, man.

1426
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:10,302
That was a deuce.

1427
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:11,846
We can play that again.
That's a deuce.

1428
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,211
<i>Hey, what are you doing, man?</i>

1429
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:14,874
<i>What are you doing,</i>
<i>going back to your chair, man?</i>

1430
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,851
Ya!

1431
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,552
Man, that last game
was bullshit, man.

1432
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:27,152
That motherfuckin' ref
is blind as a motherfucker-

1433
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:31,558
How would you know, man?

1434
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,124
You don't even go
to any of my games, man.

1435
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:34,169
Middle school, JV-

1436
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:36,227
You're too old
to remember.

1437
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:37,499
I'm talking
about Ping-Pong.

1438
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,852
Man, what are you
ragging on me for, man?

1439
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,295
I'm doing this
for you and Mom, man.

1440
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:03,456
I don't even
want to be here.

1441
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:09,994
Actually had some lucky draws.

1442
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,623
That last guy
was a-

1443
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:30,207
You feel me?

1444
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,483
That's tight.

1445
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:36,387
I like that.

1446
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,493
It's very nice.

1447
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,172
We're coming
correct, you got to be hectic.

1448
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:54,402
The people are jumping 'cause
they're feeling electric.

1449
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,034
But give me a second
to reject the strike.

1450
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:58,272
Respect the rock beat, people,
I'm the psycho.

1451
01:11:58,347 --> 01:11:59,678
Zap the bottle,
twist the cap,

1452
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:01,010
tip the bottle back,
and relax,

1453
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,414
as you get whack,
it's just a fact.

1454
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:03,678
Nobody does it
better than us,

1455
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:04,776
and we get so stupid

1456
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:06,115
that we got
to ride the short bus.

1457
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:08,019
Who rock the party?
We rock the party.

1458
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,354
Never gonna,
never gonna give up now.

1459
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:31,735
Uh!

1460
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,354
Who wants to party?
We want to party.

1461
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:51,296
'Cause tonight
the party don't stop.

1462
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,994
Who wants to party?
We want to party.

1463
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:54,535
'Cause tonight
the party don't stop.

1464
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:57,003
Take that one back to your master.

1465
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,735
Ah!

1466
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:04,904
Booyah!

1467
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,004
You're next!

1468
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:07,275
We want to party.

1469
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:08,748
'Cause tonight
the party don't stop.

1470
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:10,614
Who wants to party?
We want to party.

1471
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:12,847
I got it going on.
A-give me what you got.

1472
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,650
Who wants to party?
We want to party.

1473
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,350
'Cause tonight
the party don't stop.

1474
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:18,620
Who wants to party?
We want to party.

1475
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:20,389
Never gonna,
never gonna...

1476
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,233
You got this.

1477
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:27,996
These goddamn shorts, man.

1478
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,503
<i>Sifu.</i>

1479
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:32,062
What's up, little Gs?
Where you been at?

1480
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,540
I've taken the liberty

1481
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:35,975
of outfitting
the shoes you threw away.

1482
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,568
I've modified them to include

1483
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:39,443
a hybrid rubber molding
on the side

1484
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:43,007
as well as helium pockets
designed specifically to enhance

1485
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,212
your jump-smashing style
of play.

1486
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:48,017
P.B. Rizzle, my own shoes.

1487
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,250
My own nickname.

1488
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:50,916
I mean, can
I wear these, though?

1489
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:52,517
I mean, is it,
like, regulation shoes?

1490
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,027
Regulation?

1491
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,927
You know,
like the shorts and stuff.

1492
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:59,092
According to the
American Table Tennis Federation,

1493
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,658
there is no standard uniform.

1494
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:02,761
Are you kidding me?

1495
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:05,306
You mean all these fools
wear this shit by choice?

1496
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:06,864
Son of a-

1497
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,972
<i>Christopher Wang,</i>

1498
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,308
<i>please report for</i>
<i>the championships presentation.</i>

1499
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:46,279
<i>Christopher Wang.</i>

1500
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:50,750
Hey!

1501
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,021
I got this.
I got this, man.

1502
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:57,217
I was listening
to you, man.

1503
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:59,317
No matter what happens,
Ping-Pong is like life.

1504
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:00,918
It's not the quick sprint
that matters.

1505
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,362
It's-

1506
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:04,763
Just kick his ass.

1507
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,595
Booyah.

1508
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,867
Booyah.

1509
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:25,042
I got this feeling, man.

1510
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,212
I got it,
I got it.

1511
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:27,721
You'll never understand.

1512
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,120
You know, uh,
you know, uh,

1513
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,921
you know the place to be-
on top, on top,

1514
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:33,325
right next to Booker T.

1515
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:35,260
Let's play,
ha-ha.

1516
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:49,006
Welcome, everyone,
to the championship match

1517
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:52,274
of the Golden Cock
Ping-Pong Championship.

1518
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:56,809
<i>You know,</i>
<i>people ask me,</i>

1519
01:15:56,885 --> 01:16:00,844
"Cheryl, how does a girl from
Iowa end up directing an event

1520
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,892
sponsored by
the Chinese Community Center?"

1521
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:05,824
And I just say to them,

1522
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,759
"Me love a-Ping-Pong
long time."

1523
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:18,234
So our first competitor,
representing

1524
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:21,572
the new Harcourt International
Institute of Table Tennis

1525
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:23,167
of West Covina,

1526
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,179
Gerald Harcourt.

1527
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:33,153
<i>And his challenger,</i>
<i>challenging for the title,</i>

1528
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:35,246
<i>representing</i>
<i>Ping-Pong Palace,</i>

1529
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,588
Christopher Wang.

1530
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:42,989
Excuse me.

1531
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,932
Christopher "C-Dub" Wang.

1532
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:56,169
Three games
for the match.

1533
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:58,508
The first to 11 wins.

1534
01:16:58,580 --> 01:16:59,547
Good luck,
gentlemen.

1535
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:09,088
<i>Christopher Wang to serve.</i>

1536
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:22,833
Oh.

1537
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:25,031
C-Dub, come on, you can do
better than that, baby.

1538
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,820
<i>Downtown to Chinatown, uh!</i>

1539
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:48,419
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you get a point?

1540
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,294
<i>So fast, you missed it.</i>

1541
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,971
<i>Son of a...</i>

1542
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,857
<i> Game one</i>
<i>to Gerald Harcourt.</i>

1543
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,660
<i>Harcourt leads</i>
<i>one to zero.</i>

1544
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,670
Gerald Harcourt to serve.

1545
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:50,150
Ha-ha, who wants
to play some whack-a-fool?

1546
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:51,920
<i>That all you got,</i>
<i>weak nut?</i>

1547
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,025
Ah!
Like that?

1548
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:02,263
<i>Yeah, baby.</i>

1549
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:05,864
Make some noise, make noise.

1550
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:08,205
Aw, yeah, yeah. Come on.

1551
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:09,868
<i>Where my peoples at?</i>

1552
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,647
P.B. Rizzle!

1553
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:20,779
<i>No mercy.</i>

1554
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:21,788
That's my son.

1555
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:23,290
He also plays piano.

1556
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:26,020
Rachmaninoff, no problem.

1557
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:29,257
Better bow
down to the new master.

1558
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:30,320
Ah!

1559
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:42,165
Make some noise,
make noise.

1560
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,007
Go.

1561
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:46,775
<i>Thing of beauty. So pretty.</i>

1562
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:49,180
That's all you, baby.

1563
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,811
Game point, Wang.

1564
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,033
<i>What time is it?</i>

1565
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,072
<i>Game time!</i>

1566
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,937
<i>Game 2 to Christopher Wang.</i>

1567
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:16,500
<i>Game tied</i>
<i>1 to 1.</i>

1568
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:17,545
Lost your collar, dog?

1569
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:18,636
If you're
looking for your owner,

1570
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:19,680
he's standing right here.

1571
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:20,680
Tom, what do you do

1572
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,580
with a dog
that barks too much?

1573
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,209
P-T-S.

1574
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:25,913
Oh, that's right,
you're putting everyone to sleep.

1575
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:27,614
It's his best weapon, you know.

1576
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:29,179
Chinese chatter torture.

1577
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,498
<i>Christopher Wang to serve.</i>

1578
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:38,863
I hope you're hungry,
'cause I'm getting ready

1579
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:39,992
to serve you
some Chinese take-out.

1580
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:48,205
Oh, who's smoking the opium now,
Sir Chokes-a-Lot?

1581
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:50,506
<i>Stuff that in your knickers,</i>
<i>blue boy.</i>

1582
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:52,774
Miss Davis, many, many rules

1583
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,907
have been flaunted
during this match:

1584
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:56,974
the showboating,
the profanity.

1585
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:59,418
But this
I simply cannot let slide.

1586
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:02,285
Under section 4-F
of the ATTF rulebook,

1587
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:04,723
it clearly states
that unsportsmanlike conduct

1588
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:05,885
<i>may be defined as:</i>

1589
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:07,690
"Baiting, tounting"-

1590
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:09,286
Taunting.

1591
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:10,524
There's a U.

1592
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:13,067
"Baiting, taunting, or any other act

1593
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,568
"designed to embarrass,
ridicule, or demean others

1594
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:18,401
on the basis of race, gender,
or national origin."

1595
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:19,770
You got to be kidding me.

1596
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:22,173
Furthermore,
it states that players who exhibit

1597
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:23,643
unsportsmanlike conduct
may face ejection.

1598
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,009
Hold up,
you calling me a racist?

1599
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,479
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen.

1600
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,175
I will not
be a pawn in this forum

1601
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,979
with these attacks
on my national heritage.

1602
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,951
Dude, you're
from, like, Encino.

1603
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:33,487
I demand his ejection.

1604
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,386
Looking for
the easy way out, huh?

1605
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:36,549
You're one to talk.

1606
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,887
Someone get a cup
of shut-up juice

1607
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:38,983
for this mama-jama.

1608
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,652
Mr. Wang,
please do not speak Chinese.

1609
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:44,927
<i>The official language</i>
<i>of the ATTF is American.</i>

1610
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,490
The committee
will discuss this.

1611
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:47,967
Please step away.

1612
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:09,679
<i> The committee has
ruled on Mr. Wang's violation</i>

1613
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,692
of ATTF section 3.

1614
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,751
<i>Because this is</i>
<i>a first infraction,</i>

1615
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:18,731
Mr. Wang
will not be ejected.

1616
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,997
<i>However, he will be required</i>
<i>to refrain</i>

1617
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,163
from all verbal ejaculations

1618
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,139
for the remainder
of the tournament.

1619
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:27,606
Verbal what?

1620
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:30,668
What it means,
old chum, is, you can't talk.

1621
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:32,872
Hold up, you know,
I got a right to free speech,

1622
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,643
<i>especially when the subject</i>
<i>of that speech</i>

1623
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:37,412
is a student-poaching,
female-harassing,

1624
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:40,784
SPF-50-wearing,
Grey-Poupon-smearing mother-

1625
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:44,882
Sir, you are one word away
from disqualification.

1626
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,188
One.

1627
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,058
Was th-

1628
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,258
Was there something you-

1629
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,563
He can't talk.

1630
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:07,574
Back on my feet.

1631
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,139
My game is,
my aim is

1632
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:11,151
to get those
that's painless, not brainless.

1633
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:12,208
Say something mean.

1634
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:13,549
I know you want
to lash out.

1635
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:15,953
Another reason I know
that I got to get out.

1636
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:17,719
It's over.

1637
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,692
Yes, this is the end.

1638
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,956
We don't need
to be friends.

1639
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,863
So once you get to know me.

1640
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,798
Yes, it's over.

1641
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:28,597
Yes, this is the end.

1642
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,694
Yes, it's-

1643
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:30,863
We don't need
to be friends.

1644
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:31,997
Lights out.

1645
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,233
So why don't you
get to walking?

1646
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:36,334
It's on now.

1647
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:38,504
You know,
you're really unbelievable.

1648
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,275
I mean,

1649
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:41,975
you cheating me
in things,

1650
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,745
but I wasn't going to say
nothing about this.

1651
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:46,709
Serve the ball.

1652
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:56,089
You guys are being crazy.

1653
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:59,793
Yes, this is the end.

1654
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:00,994
Lights out.

1655
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:02,798
We don't need
to be friends.

1656
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,840
So why don't you
get to walking?

1657
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:07,807
Yes, it's over.

1658
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,434
Yes, this is the end.

1659
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:12,378
We don't need
to be friends.

1660
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:14,005
So why don't you
get to walking?

1661
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,642
It's over now, uh.

1662
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:33,660
<i>Injury time-out, five minutes,</i>

1663
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,862
<i>pending medical review.</i>

1664
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:41,169
Shake it off, C-Dub.

1665
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:43,176
You know, he wouldn't have fallen

1666
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:45,269
<i>if his footwork was just</i>
<i>a little bit neater.</i>

1667
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:46,438
He was airborne.

1668
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:48,141
I don't think footwork
was the issue.

1669
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,150
You'd be surprised.

1670
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:51,810
You're the brother, aren't you?

1671
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:53,751
That's me.
Do you play?

1672
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:54,789
No.

1673
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:56,380
Would you like to learn?

1674
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:58,085
Why does every guy I
meet want to teach me Ping-Pong?

1675
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:59,922
I hate to break it to you,

1676
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:02,053
but it's not exactly
a chick-magnet sport.

1677
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,530
Well, it's like that
in America, but you know what?

1678
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:08,626
In China, they would treat me
like Michael Jordan.

1679
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:09,863
Excuse me.

1680
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:16,603
What happened to the posse?

1681
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:18,009
I'm too nervous.

1682
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:19,774
I feel like
I want to throw up.

1683
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,042
Suck it up.

1684
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,708
C-Dub's out there
sweating and bleeding.

1685
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,081
Worse,
he can't talk,

1686
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:26,347
and you guys sit here
like the see-no-evil monkeys?

1687
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:29,288
Perhaps you
could suggest some cheers?

1688
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:31,416
Do I look like
a cheerleader to you?

1689
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,795
Boys, let's show them
what you got.

1690
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,491
<i>Mr. Wang is cleared for play.</i>

1691
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:12,055
<i>The final game</i>
<i>will resume.</i>

1692
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:14,397
<i>Harcourt leads</i>
<i>9 to 6.</i>

1693
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:54,932
Yes.

1694
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:12,486
<i>The score is tied.</i>

1695
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,619
<i>Champion must win</i>
<i>by 2 points.</i>

1696
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:43,857
<i>Match point, Wang.</i>

1697
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,621
Harcourt to serve.

1698
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:35,300
Ah!

1699
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:37,503
Uh!

1700
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:38,909
Ah.

1701
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,641
Ah!

1702
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:46,720
<i> Game and
match to Christopher Wang.</i>

1703
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:02,026
He was fantastic,
absolutely fantastic.

1704
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:03,695
That's my son.

1705
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:06,035
Ah!

1706
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:10,741
Gerald, they're going
to make you pay for that.

1707
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:11,904
You want some tea?

1708
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:13,606
I got the thermos open.

1709
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:16,975
Yeah!

1710
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:24,988
Edward, you're late.

1711
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:26,219
We need a partner
for Mrs. Lu.

1712
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:27,921
Grab a paddle.

1713
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:32,955
Oh, you did that.

1714
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,093
Dad, hit it like this.

1715
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:50,748
Tell your dad the
manufacturing deal's locked up.

1716
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:53,184
All I need from you is to get
those specs for those shoes.

1717
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:54,585
First thing tomorrow.

1718
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:55,622
Word.

1719
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:56,657
Yo, yo.

1720
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:58,055
What's up, homey?

1721
01:29:58,126 --> 01:29:59,889
How's it feel
to be off the leash, man?

1722
01:29:59,961 --> 01:30:01,326
Oh, it's all good, playa.

1723
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,455
When you got a big dog
like Rabakar's dad in the yard,

1724
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:04,555
ain't no need to be sweating.

1725
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:05,963
Hey, heard that.

1726
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:07,967
Hey, do you want to
play some basketball later?

1727
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:09,161
We haven't played
in forever.

1728
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,261
Sorry, dog.

1729
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:11,771
I have to give my moms
a ride home.

1730
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:14,103
But I'll hit you up in the
neighborhood later, all right?

1731
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:15,233
All right.

1732
01:30:15,309 --> 01:30:17,174
As long as
your sister's home.

1733
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:33,449
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, Ma.

1734
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:35,496
One last lesson.

1735
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,461
Always watch your back!

1736
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:01,582
How you doing?

1737
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:03,283
splat!

1738
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:13,425
I like, I like, I like cereal.

1739
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:15,901
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

1740
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,803
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

1741
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:21,398
Don't put the box away;
I'm about to have me some more.

1742
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,967
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

1743
01:31:24,045 --> 01:31:26,536
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

1744
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:28,844
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

1745
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:31,680
Don't put the box away;
I'm about to have me some more.

1746
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:34,118
Sitting at the table
throwing fits at my mother.

1747
01:31:34,188 --> 01:31:35,246
Want my own box.

1748
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,154
I don't want to split
with my brother.

1749
01:31:37,225 --> 01:31:39,785
The one thing I hated
to admit, he discovered.

1750
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:42,329
Certain cereals will make
the milk different colors.

1751
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:44,830
If you took away my cereal,
you heard screams.

1752
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:47,595
I like Kaboom! 'cause it
always made my poo turn green.

1753
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:48,862
I make a scene
in the store

1754
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:50,528
and start
to act disobedient

1755
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:53,369
if sugar didn't come first
in the ingredients.

1756
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:56,001
Make my mom buy me some,
no matter what it costed.

1757
01:31:56,077 --> 01:31:58,568
The best ones started
with the same word, "frosted."

1758
01:31:58,646 --> 01:32:00,841
'Cause if it ain't sugary,
it ain't no good.

1759
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:02,348
I hate
health food cereals.

1760
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:04,247
They taste like wood.

1761
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:07,378
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

1762
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:09,116
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1763
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,385
No one can mess with
the champ.

1764
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:12,790
I'm the champ.
Oh, yes.

1765
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:14,020
Today I'm a winner.

1766
01:32:14,095 --> 01:32:15,460
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1767
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,828
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1768
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:19,059
God gave me talent.

1769
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:20,566
I'm a super machine.

1770
01:32:20,635 --> 01:32:22,865
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1771
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:24,097
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1772
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:25,331
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1773
01:32:25,406 --> 01:32:26,532
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1774
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:28,131
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1775
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:29,233
I'm rated number one

1776
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:30,777
at the top of the game.

1777
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:31,812
Hey, the dynasty's begun.

1778
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:33,073
Ain't no stopping
this reign.

1779
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:34,205
Better recognize the face,

1780
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:35,476
start jocking the name.

1781
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:36,744
With my whole line of shoes,

1782
01:32:36,817 --> 01:32:38,045
watch 'em
walkin' the Js.

1783
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,747
Oh, I'm something special,
one of a kind.

1784
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:41,810
Got my big bowl of Wheaties.

1785
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,015
I was born to fly

1786
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:45,581
Yes, I'm extra lifted,
extra gifted.

1787
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,254
I'm going down in history
frozen in time.

1788
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:49,421
Got trophies
by the dozens

1789
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:50,759
and medals to count.

1790
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:53,163
And I'm on your television show
and off my house.

1791
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:54,428
Everybody wants to see me.

1792
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:55,628
I'm the talk of the town.

1793
01:32:55,703 --> 01:32:56,965
Just the life
of a champ.

1794
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:58,164
Take a look
at me now.

1795
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,706
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1796
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:02,174
No one can mess with
the champ.

1797
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:03,574
I'm a champ.
Oh, yes.

1798
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:04,611
Today I'm a winner.

1799
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:05,839
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1800
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:08,609
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1801
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:09,809
God gave me talent.

1802
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:11,351
I'm a super machine.

1803
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,649
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1804
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:14,881
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1805
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:16,116
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1806
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:17,316
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1807
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:18,551
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1808
01:33:18,626 --> 01:33:19,923
I feel great
in the morning

1809
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:21,154
when I wake up.

1810
01:33:21,228 --> 01:33:23,093
I'm a man on a mission
with no makeup.

1811
01:33:23,164 --> 01:33:26,292
I got lots to do today,
like find the right girl,

1812
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:28,562
get my oil changed,
and take over the world.

1813
01:33:28,636 --> 01:33:31,503
See, everything you do,
I bet I could do it better.

1814
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:33,836
If you climb a hill,
I'll climb the Staples Center.

1815
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:36,240
If you say "what,"
then I'ma say "whatever."

1816
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,470
And if you
got the cheese,

1817
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:38,773
then I'ma bring it better.

1818
01:33:38,846 --> 01:33:40,905
See, I don't even stop
at a stop sign.

1819
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:43,780
With a off rhyme,
I can still sound dope on time.

1820
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:46,251
I can sound proper.
I can sound unsigned.

1821
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,652
Don't step to your man.
He's a land mine.

1822
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:50,418
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1823
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:52,652
No one can mess with
the champ.

1824
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:54,058
I'm a champ.
Oh, yes.

1825
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:55,095
Today I'm a winner.

1826
01:33:55,162 --> 01:33:56,356
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1827
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:59,092
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1828
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,326
God gave me talent.

1829
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:01,732
I'm a super machine.

1830
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:04,134
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1831
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:05,365
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1832
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:06,599
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1833
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:07,663
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1834
01:34:07,742 --> 01:34:09,004
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1835
01:34:09,076 --> 01:34:11,704
Too short to be a baller, nope,
let alone a starter.

1836
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:12,711
Warming up the bench,

1837
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,304
I got it hotter
than a sauna.

1838
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:16,850
Never getting called 'cause
I was skinny like my mama.

1839
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:19,385
Couldn't land a chick
because my daddy sang opera.

1840
01:34:19,453 --> 01:34:21,683
Had a lot of time to think
stuffed inside my locker.

1841
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:22,882
Penny for my thoughts,

1842
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:24,424
then I'd have
a million dollars.

1843
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:27,017
Didn't like to read,
so I couldn't be a scholar.

1844
01:34:27,094 --> 01:34:29,289
Didn't like the coppers.
Think a little harder.

1845
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:31,558
Put it all together,
and what did I see?

1846
01:34:31,632 --> 01:34:32,758
What?
What could I be?

1847
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:34,266
I could be an MC.

1848
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:35,461
I ain't making money trees.

1849
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:36,764
I'm just planting
my seeds.

1850
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:37,997
But I'm doing what I feel,

1851
01:34:38,072 --> 01:34:39,232
and that's
a winner to me.

1852
01:34:39,306 --> 01:34:40,739
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1853
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:42,901
No one can mess with
the champ.

1854
01:34:42,977 --> 01:34:44,638
I'm a champ.
Oh, yes.

1855
01:34:44,712 --> 01:34:45,679
Today I'm a winner.

1856
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:46,940
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1857
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:49,676
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1858
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:50,910
God gave me talent.

1859
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:52,213
I'm a super machine.

1860
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:54,186
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1861
01:34:54,255 --> 01:34:55,552
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1862
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:56,851
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1863
01:34:56,924 --> 01:34:58,084
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1864
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,024
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1865
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:18,478
Hi, I'm Gerald Harcourt

1866
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:22,448
of the Harcourt Institute
of Table Tennis of Canoga Park.

1867
01:35:22,516 --> 01:35:27,010
And, um, we're here to make
learning table tennis a smash.

1868
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:35,160
We've got four hands
to perfect your forehands.

1869
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:40,599
And you'll come back
to learn the backhand.

1870
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:41,760
Table tennis:

1871
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:46,933
Truly a sport of kings
and queens.

1872
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:48,565
I lob it.

1873
01:35:48,642 --> 01:35:52,806
Harcourt Institute
of Table Tennis of Canoga Park.

1874
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,745
You'll all lob it too.

1875
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:02,550
That's a-
I think that was a good one.

1876
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:04,284
I liked it.
That was good.

1877
