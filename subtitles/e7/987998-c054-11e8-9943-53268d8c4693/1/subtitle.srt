1
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,061
Miss Tracy, please look this way

2
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:12,802
Have a smile

3
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:16,931
Thank you

4
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,210
Hi! Tracy!

5
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:19,801
Tracy, cheer

6
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,914
Tracy! If you've time
we can do something together

7
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,677
No kidding, you're a hot producer,

8
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:29,879
how can you spare your time?

9
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,751
I'm always ready if it were you!

10
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,414
Really?

11
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,255
Kit, any new masterpieces?

12
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,190
I heard you have released a CD,

13
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,192
is it Jazz?

14
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,126
Kit!

15
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,463
Sometimes I really envy artist like you

16
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,294
You don't need to cater for the market,

17
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,932
and just do the Jazz,
but who will listen to you?

18
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,904
Can you write some pop music?

19
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,673
Actually, it's quite commercial

20
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,375
I've asked my P.A. to send you some CD,

21
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,379
you haven't listened, have you?

22
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,778
I don't need to, but I can tell

23
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,021
any way, if you are going to write again

24
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,018
let me listen to it first

25
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,315
If I don't even understand,

26
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,856
who will?

27
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,089
There're many things that
you don't understand

28
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,455
but it isn't bad

29
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,187
Maybe you're just too stupid

30
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,024
I gotta leave

31
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,437
Stay longer

32
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,572
Aren't you leaving?

33
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,837
Dinner time!

34
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,915
Bo, Backie, come over

35
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,881
It smells good, hurry up

36
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,157
Where is your dog-belt?

37
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,996
You keep losing your dog-belt,
it's expensive!

38
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,688
If you're caught, you're dead

39
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,475
That guy doesn't seem friendly

40
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,048
You guys have to watch out,
don't be cheated

41
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,723
People do eat dog meat in summer,
understand?

42
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,088
Go! Bye!

43
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,711
Man can't get rich without a fortune

44
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,610
Come for your fortune telling

45
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:24,622
You look obsessive, let me have a look

46
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,862
I've helped many people

47
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,567
Sit down, you don't need to pay
if I'm not accurate

48
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,470
What's your name?

49
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,371
Lam

50
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,599
Mr. Lam?

51
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:40,542
How old?

52
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,947
29

53
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,512
29, snake?

54
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:44,580
Dragon

55
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,778
Dragon? That's 30

56
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,312
30...

57
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,055
Let's have a general examination,
it costs $1000,

58
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,387
it'll summarize your 10 years' fortune,

59
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,129
or, palm-reading...

60
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,958
I'll charge you $300

61
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,697
I could tell you things happen...

62
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,363
in 3 to 5 years accurately

63
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,441
I think it will be something
about your career

64
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,175
Let's look at career

65
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,277
Career, I'll charge you $30

66
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,817
Sorry, I want to know...

67
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,852
about my emotional affairs

68
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,592
Emotional problem?

69
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:27,791
Yeah

70
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,791
Romance, I'll take $30

71
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,356
Do you know your birthday?

72
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,191
No

73
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:34,931
No?

74
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,160
No problem, I can find it out

75
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,764
When I stay in,
you've nothing to talk to me,

76
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,907
when I go out, you're not happy

77
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,042
What do you want?

78
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,103
I'm a singer, I can't just stay in

79
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,008
I must socialize with others

80
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,079
How many times have I told you...

81
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,113
not to use your money?

82
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,412
You won't listen!
$3-400,000 is not a small sum

83
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,621
You've lost this time! Aren't you happy?

84
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,323
I've told you...

85
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,984
not to wear these messy clothes,

86
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,920
dress properly,
or they won't respect you!

87
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,660
I've no money to buy new clothes

88
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,392
I've bought you clothes,
why don't you wear it?

89
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,398
I live here, but it doesn't mean
you're supporting me!

90
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,502
I lost my money,

91
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,604
not yours

92
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,467
Are you blaming me? I don't mean it

93
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:16,467
I don't want to talk to you

94
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:29,613
Where's my box?

95
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,387
What have you done?

96
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,961
I know you're in bad mood,

97
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,064
but it can't solve the problem

98
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,034
Have you ever thought it over?

99
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,602
Your work is not bad,

100
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,000
but how come no one wants it?

101
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,532
Just because
you've offended too many people

102
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,936
They just comment a few words

103
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,839
It's not big deal! Take it as a joke

104
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,307
You won't be hurt!

105
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,206
But does it hurt your pride?

106
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,077
We've different. I've my style and

107
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,183
my working attitude

108
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,216
Alright... I don't want to argue,

109
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,183
give my stuff back

110
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,930
You're going to have a romance
and get a fortune!

111
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,925
This woman is a good house-keeper and

112
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,931
good-looking, don't miss it!

113
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,061
Not correct?

114
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,810
Incorrect, no way!

115
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,909
Anyway, it's alright

116
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,514
Thanks

117
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,525
Where have...

118
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,756
you been lately?

119
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:20,488
I've been to Macau

120
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,998
Macau! Have a fortune? Sit...

121
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,227
Thanks

122
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:24,959
Pick a song

123
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:25,865
Alright

124
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,571
You're my support,

125
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,674
you must come more often

126
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,273
Thanks, Bill

127
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,777
Bill gives us $200

128
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,955
Min...

129
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,095
Uncle you're late,
Mom is going to scold you

130
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:51,992
Where's my stuff?

131
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,096
I've taken it out

132
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,227
Quick

133
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,313
What? Playing mahjong again?

134
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,005
No, just talk!

135
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,672
About what?

136
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,587
Brother, I've told you not to smoke

137
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:16,617
You're old enough,

138
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,017
how come you still can't
take care of yourself!

139
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,963
Hurry up!

140
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,393
Why are you so hurry?

141
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,367
I must hurry home to prepare dinner

142
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,005
You're the greatest!

143
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,639
How come our business is getting worse?

144
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,677
But lots of people here!

145
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,249
Lots of people? But it doesn't help

146
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,787
They just sit here, and we lose money

147
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,820
Don't drink anymore!

148
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,894
Don't worry,
I've got the Asthmatic drugs

149
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,527
God! You take wine as medicine
Aren't you going to die?

150
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,200
I wish I could die, it saves a lot

151
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,374
Now I understand why we're losing money

152
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,042
Because you shirk work

153
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,805
He plays his saxophone...

154
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,741
as if he's sucking his dummy

155
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,917
Don't blame me,
I just don't want to over shadow you

156
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,383
Can you?

157
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,084
Mom

158
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,215
Let's play something popular tomorrow

159
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,516
Popular?

160
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,024
The life is tough nowadays,

161
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,320
let's give them some fun

162
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,293
Yeah! Min is right

163
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:09,127
No one wants to hear "Send you to hell"

164
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,825
It's your wife
who dedicates this song to you,

165
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,435
she wishes you dead

166
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,900
Your uncle is always against me!

167
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,134
Ling, let's try something new tomorrow?

168
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,507
Alright, let's do it

169
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,281
Listen... it comes again

170
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,922
The guy upstairs!
Every night is the same

171
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:44,931
New comers?

172
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:46,737
Who knows?

173
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,931
Let's get a Chinese clarionet and

174
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,569
do the same to him

175
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,938
What's this song?
I've never heard it before

176
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,581
It's a song? Just bull shit

177
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,884
No bull shit, it's quite nice

178
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,279
Turtle? Let's have a sip

179
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,052
Min, drink it

180
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,523
It's better to drink hot soup

181
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,559
Uncle, does he play good?

182
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,835
He's composing a song

183
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:17,627
Really?

184
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:18,833
Not sure

185
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:27,705
Aren't you going to sleep?

186
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,144
Still early,
please close the door for me

187
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,677
Are you calling me?

188
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,185
How come you know my song?

189
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,352
Is it really your song?
How come there's no ending?

190
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,617
I've not finished yet...
how come you know it?

191
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,220
You're making a noise every night,

192
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,259
our neighbourhood know it too

193
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,257
Did I disturb you?

194
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,403
It's alright for me,
but you're disturbing my family

195
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,065
But you're also singing in the morning

196
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,502
and with drums

197
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,310
Early morning?
We start at almost 11:00 a.m.

198
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,306
You must go to sleep very late

199
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,539
In the morning... no... I

200
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,450
I sleep in the morning and work at night

201
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,179
How come you're stammering

202
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,878
I think
you should take some chinese herbs

203
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,983
The way that I talk to you,
make me feel tired

204
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,990
Give me your telephone number,

205
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,219
I'll call you

206
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,461
I have to work now

207
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,997
So late? Aren't you a car thief?

208
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,926
No, I play organ in a bar

209
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,503
Does such kind of job still exist?

210
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,366
I know! Isn't it the topless bar?

211
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,133
No, just common bar

212
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,407
Any food served?

213
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:41,303
Yeah

214
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,445
Anyway, we've just met,
talk to you later

215
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,648
What?

216
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,786
You look cool

217
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,920
but you don't look like a bad guy

218
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,249
See you downstairs

219
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,791
Delicious! Min, pay the bill

220
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:04,469
Me again?

221
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,499
I don't have small change

222
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,097
Every time it's like this

223
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,441
You don't look that tall?
What's your name?

224
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:15,609
Call me Kit

225
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,107
I'm Min, she's Ling,

226
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,944
this is what they call us

227
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,344
In fact I saw you before

228
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,916
You're always alone in the park

229
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,279
You always feed the dogs

230
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,217
You remembered?

231
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,253
You love swimming?

232
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,187
How come you're so dark?

233
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,057
Please be polite!

234
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,556
I tell the facts

235
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,824
Where should we go?

236
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,194
So late, are you scared?

237
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,468
No!

238
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,765
We're in the same field and
we're neighbours too

239
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,032
Even if you're off key,
we won't tease you

240
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,444
Go

241
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,886
Go and get a karaoke!

242
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:58,646
You pay?

243
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,292
I'll buy your place off

244
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,260
This store is famous
for their roasted snails

245
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,293
One more order

246
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,700
You can play it quite well

247
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,000
Just try to earn a living

248
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,577
Anyway, it's not easy

249
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,082
Just like spilling the pearls
before pigs

250
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,708
You've been in this field
for a long time, haven't you?

251
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,952
I used to be a musician,

252
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,583
playing session in the studio

253
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:33,421
You're a musician

254
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,492
No big deal!

255
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,919
They can make up
many different music without us

256
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,289
So we've nothing to do now

257
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,326
Therefore you're composing songs

258
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,627
We're having economic depression,
we'd save our expenses

259
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,199
So you've made a right move to live here

260
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,668
Don't worry,

261
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,306
you'll grow back. You can get over it

262
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,164
Roasted snail, half dozen

263
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:56,271
I've ordered roasted snail!
How come it's so fast?

264
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,709
Because somebody has ordered more,
don't you want it?

265
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:00,986
Alright, I'll give you another one

266
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,383
I'm giving you a favour,

267
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,420
don't you understand?

268
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,227
Anyway... thank you

269
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,088
You're hungry like a wolf!

270
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,121
He's crazy!

271
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,625
He likes joking

272
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,531
He'll give you the same old stuff,

273
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:17,665
maybe he'll add something else

274
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,666
Let's eat

275
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,929
Dare him!

276
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,438
How much did you earn for a month?

277
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,837
You're sick,
how can you ask this question

278
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:25,869
Why not?

279
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:26,702
The Chinese opera...

280
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,741
makes her become crazy

281
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,442
Are you both singing Chinese opera?

282
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,349
She's the leading, I sing whatever

283
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:34,815
You like music, don't you?

284
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,045
Yeah!

285
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,951
Pop, English song, whatever...

286
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,648
I do know a bit about yours,

287
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,293
but not an expert

288
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,054
Please play your piece to us

289
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,265
I've no saxophone here, next time

290
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,292
Alright

291
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,438
Aren't you going back?

292
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,104
Lend me some money for taxi

293
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,008
Where are you going so late?

294
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,973
She doesn't sleep

295
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,153
Taxi, coming or not?

296
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,755
It's late, let's go back

297
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,025
I go for an adventure, aren't you coming

298
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,561
Let's go

299
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,874
Beautiful

300
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,412
$40 for 30 pieces, how's that?

301
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:37,845
Let me see

302
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,911
Great

303
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,690
This colour is newly painted,
it will fade away after 2 days

304
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:47,922
Right?

305
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,852
Not this! Don't shake it!

306
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,223
I never know there's a place like this

307
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,429
You certainly don't know!
You're abnormal

308
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,228
I'm abnormal! Aren't you normal?

309
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,035
Go

310
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,901
There're still lots to see over there

311
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,802
You're home so late,

312
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,138
don't you scare of your mom?

313
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,847
No, my mom is so tolerant about me

314
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,274
Don't you have any work to do
in day time?

315
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,313
Play

316
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,515
Not exactly! The band is my mom's

317
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,383
We do our business over there at night

318
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,788
Ling is the leading,
and also my mom's fellow

319
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,421
Your opera must be great!

320
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,296
Just like yours, trying to earn a living

321
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,928
Anyway, we do sing
some classical Chinese Opera

322
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,897
We're famous in the villages

323
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,229
Don't you know
what's outdoor performance?

324
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,996
Yeah...
something like setting up the stage

325
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,866
Not setting up stage

326
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,270
but on the stage

327
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,376
How come you're stammering

328
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,480
I know, it must be too many over nights

329
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,383
You should have
some stewed ginger with crow

330
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,507
Stewed crow?

331
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:52,719
No! White feature chicken
You've infected me

332
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,219
Next time when I've my recording

333
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,622
You come to play saxophone for me

334
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,795
It'll be perfect
if there's more musical back up

335
00:19:58,997 --> 00:19:59,463
What's you recording?

336
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,461
Cover version,

337
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,562
those $10 stuff in the night market

338
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,792
Chiang Chi Kwong used
to sing George Lam's part

339
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,367
Life is fair, he's a big hit

340
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,072
What about you?

341
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,172
Red bean cake

342
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,368
Give me a white one and

343
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,101
a coffee for him

344
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,275
What about you?

345
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,776
Any one who is hit!

346
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,278
Like Tracy, Sarah Chan Suk Wah

347
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,944
Tracy, really?

348
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,348
There's no big deal
to sing cover version

349
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,582
Why should I lie? I'll give you
my cassettes some other time

350
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,292
But the tape is not good, always jammed

351
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,927
It's getting dawn,
let's see the sun rise in the Peak

352
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:35,964
To the Peak?

353
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,359
I'll pay for the taxi and

354
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,763
it takes 30 min to walk down the peak

355
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,964
No! I'm tired

356
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,166
No taxi?

357
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,975
It's not far, let's walk

358
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:45,802
Walk back?

359
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,869
In the morning, the air is fresh

360
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:52,811
Here is a taxi

361
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,282
Let's go and have a breakfast

362
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,581
You haven't finished your red bean cake

363
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,283
If you aren't enough, take mine

364
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,554
Great

365
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:00,753
Why don't we...

366
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,292
Nothing

367
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,747
Good morning, it's late,
why don't you get up?

368
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,442
I'm just about to sleep,
how come you get up so early?

369
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,581
My phone broke down,

370
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,449
I just want to borrow yours

371
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,055
I've no phone

372
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,253
No phone? Not possible!

373
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,892
My Grand Ma in China
does have a telephone

374
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,324
Check it yourself

375
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,530
OK

376
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,332
I thought you want to pretend that
you're poor

377
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,664
You're really broke

378
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,103
You eat instant noodle everyday

379
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,907
No wonder,
your face is just like a noodle cake

380
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,447
Great

381
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,292
It won't work!

382
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,694
I haven't put on the bamboo slip yet
Make yourself at home

383
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,797
You still want to sleep, don't you?

384
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,333
Remember to close the door for me

385
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,544
Don't! Don't waste your time,
find some friends

386
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,713
I've no day time friends

387
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,674
Now you have

388
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,243
You've just arrived here,

389
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,010
let me show you around

390
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,217
Let me give you a treat

391
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,754
I don't like to owe you a favour

392
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,992
I'm sorry for last night,

393
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,787
I've made you buy us right snack

394
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,561
Could you do me a favour?

395
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,388
We're not close friend

396
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,165
You're not going to borrow money
from me, aren't you?

397
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,468
I go and get changed

398
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,181
It's big and beautiful

399
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,251
You're the son of a wealthy family,
aren't you?

400
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,757
But you're rebellious and
like to join the band

401
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,895
So your Pa kicked you out, am I right?

402
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,327
Come and help me

403
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,832
You sleep here, the mezzanine?

404
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,299
We also have one,

405
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,408
but it's full of my Mom's stuff

406
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,008
Help me

407
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,344
I'll ask my mom to clean out
the mezzanine for me to sleep

408
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:10,775
Put it in my bag, be careful

409
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,053
How do you know Tracy?

410
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,155
Girl friend

411
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:23,725
Ex...

412
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:04,729
Master

413
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,465
Hurry...

414
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,872
Go over there and have leg exercise

415
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,407
You're on performance so young?

416
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:17,474
Yeah!

417
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,207
I was on stage at eight,
I've worked for 12 years

418
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,516
You know how old I am now

419
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,087
What about your mom? Was she a singer?

420
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,485
Yeah! She's great!
Like me, she knows everything

421
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,257
But she wasn't hit

422
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:31,590
Why?

423
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,660
My uncle said she's hot temper

424
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,263
And offended many people

425
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,292
The one playing dulcimer is my uncle,

426
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,163
nick named "Cheung Po Tsai"

427
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:40,961
He is responsible
for our outdoor performance

428
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,133
Isn't he playing saxophone?

429
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:44,400
No!

430
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,440
Just like me, he knows everything

431
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,078
I forget,
I should not always speak high of myself

432
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,341
I know...

433
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,884
why you pulled a long face and
ran away that day

434
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,356
Come

435
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,058
Come here

436
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,131
Get in

437
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,589
Don't worry! Come in

438
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,841
I give you a cassette

439
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,911
You've a lot of tapes

440
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,870
Yeah, I've a big collection

441
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:27,513
You really did it?

442
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,620
Please give me your comments

443
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,834
Blacky, who is this?

444
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,208
Sarah Chan! Haven't you heard this!

445
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:58,880
Be careful, don't break my tape recorder

446
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,645
No, the tape jammed

447
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,269
Your tape is really shit

448
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,436
Look, what a tape...

449
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,182
Aunty, how are you? I'm looking for Min

450
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,346
Don't you even knock?

451
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,187
Get up, it's ten already

452
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,263
Where's your mom?

453
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:20,954
Are you looking for her?

454
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,258
No

455
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,566
Last night, I've mistaken her as you

456
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,568
There's no big deal

457
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,540
I feel that your mom doesn't like me

458
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,904
I don't think so

459
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,308
Let me ask her

460
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,306
Don't

461
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,977
Look at yourself

462
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,588
You think I'm nuts

463
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,249
My mom's gone out early in the morning

464
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,886
Don't bother her, you both are the same,

465
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,794
always pulling long face,
why were you looking for me?

466
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,865
The tape dropped down,
and they're all poor

467
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,927
Yeah

468
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,272
Even I sang not good
but you shouldn't drop them

469
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,165
Could you give me some face?

470
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,435
I don't mean it,

471
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,509
but just missed it unintentionally

472
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,636
Alright! I'll give you a new one

473
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,847
So soon

474
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,928
Won't you let me in?

475
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,147
How can you live in this sort of places?

476
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,513
The rent is cheap!

477
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,350
Why don't you move in with your brother?

478
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,390
Not convenient, my sister-in-law,
you know...

479
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,918
I forgot, you two are incompatible

480
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,493
You're incompatible to everybody too

481
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,167
I heard Tat say,

482
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,272
you refused to perform in the concert,
didn't you?

483
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,905
There's no need to fight against money!

484
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,938
Don't talk about money
all the time please

485
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,111
Am I?

486
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,244
I've known you for so long,

487
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,813
have I ever mentioned money with you?

488
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,875
Don't be so weird

489
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,414
Not everyone on earth is your enemy

490
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,414
What do you really want?

491
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,219
Do you want to stay here
for the rest of your life?

492
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,491
Come back, will you?

493
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,695
Don't you want me to beg you?

494
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,869
Kit! I think this tape won't...

495
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,670
Sorry, I'll come later

496
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,979
I'll close the door for you,
there're many people passing by

497
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,946
Who is she?

498
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:01,284
Just met. She's nice

499
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,524
You've just met and you know she's nice

500
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:06,953
Cheap

501
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,605
Tracy, why do you leave so early?

502
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,731
Could you give me your autograph?

503
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,137
I love your songs

504
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,436
This is for you

505
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,444
I'm busy

506
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,660
He's still angry, don't bother him

507
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,250
Hi!

508
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,346
Are you calling me?

509
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,651
Why don't you say hello?

510
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,715
I'm very observant

511
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,617
You hate woman, I dare not bother you

512
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,022
How do you know?

513
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:09,988
Can't you see?

514
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,527
All the female sparrows...

515
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,788
fly away from you

516
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,099
What about your dogs? Throw away?

517
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,331
Here comes the dog-catcher

518
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,403
They're really clever
And hide under the bridge

519
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,996
Are you jobless?

520
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,072
Traveling around?

521
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,170
Who said I'm jobless?
I'm going for the recording session

522
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:27,101
Cover-version?

523
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,174
They said the oldies will be popular,

524
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,713
early release makes big money

525
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:32,708
Can I visit?

526
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,307
Of course, come!

527
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,387
This way

528
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,323
I just saw you go that way

529
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,817
Am I? No, I'm going this way

530
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,386
No, you're going that way

531
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:46,587
This way

532
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,023
Alright, this way

533
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:49,829
Cheung Sha Wan

534
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:50,558
Take the MTR?

535
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,830
MTR? Let's walk

536
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,400
Walk, but it's far away!

537
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,039
No, it's not far away

538
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,405
Ga Lip So Cha Cha Cha

539
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,347
Ga Lip So Cha Cha Cha,

540
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,739
Thank you very much!

541
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,635
Just now Yau Ling has sung you...

542
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,640
"The Love Affair in a Distant Land"

543
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:07,800
Is it great?

544
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,876
This song was dedicated by Fat
from the Fat's Restaurant,

545
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:14,107
and Mr Cheung
from the Cheung's Restaurant

546
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,284
If anyone of you want to hear anything,

547
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,921
just tell me

548
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,852
Our band will be glad to perform it

549
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,683
We're now taking a break

550
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,327
Because our Masters need to go to toilet

551
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,359
And will be back soon

552
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,122
Thank you...

553
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,563
Uncle

554
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,633
You're late today

555
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,363
I've gone to studio! Where's mom?

556
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,096
You're lucky,
she's gone for a wedding banquet

557
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,342
Take a seat, I'll give you a treat today

558
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,079
Min! Sing us a song

559
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,041
Sure, you sit here

560
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,651
What do you want me to sing?

561
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,747
"Tang Bai Fu dates Qiu Xiang"

562
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,622
Tang Bai Fu? That's not good

563
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:53,983
What about a pop song?

564
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:54,886
Good

565
00:34:55,426 --> 00:35:00,659
"Keep coming even you've lost"

566
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,001
Are you crazy?

567
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,864
I've blown it! Let's do something to it

568
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,907
Yeah. Let's have Yan Ling to sing us...

569
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:12,940
the "The Work Repairer"

570
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,433
Great!

571
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,077
Thanks

572
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,582
What do you expect from me?

573
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,219
I was in the studio the whole day
I'm tired

574
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,124
And you have to stay
with your Prince of the White Horse

575
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,260
No, it's the Prince of the Black Horse

576
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,121
What are you talking about?

577
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,602
Thank you very much

578
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:15,961
Good!

579
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,574
Please come next time

580
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,840
Thank you

581
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:22,744
Thank you

582
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:25,807
Go this way

583
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,907
Why did they throw the money
on the floor?

584
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,867
It's a majestic act

585
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,673
It'll give face to our leading artiste
as well as to our customers

586
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,582
I really appreciate you guys...

587
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,150
to have the guts to sing in the public

588
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,713
Are you afraid?

589
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,420
Afraid of what? Even in the HK stadium,
it's not that crowded

590
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:07,318
but it's different

591
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,789
What different? Just for a living

592
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,326
But they eat shark fin soup and
we eat vermicelli

593
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:13,491
You sing well,

594
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:14,596
why don't you enter
a singing competition?

595
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,892
I can't, I just know how to imitate

596
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,624
But I feel that you have the potential

597
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,237
As a singer you should have
a pretty face and you aren't ugly

598
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,607
Really? But I'm not pretty enough

599
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:25,764
You are pretty!

600
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,975
You know how to flatter now

601
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,444
You must have eaten
the ginger soup with crow

602
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,049
I'm serious,

603
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,979
you shouldn't hide yourself

604
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,746
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life singing here?

605
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,982
Don't you think I'm like a beggar?

606
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:41,817
Don't be misunderstood,

607
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,893
I don't mean to look down upon you

608
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,323
Anyway...

609
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,194
there's no different for professions

610
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,460
Look at these people,

611
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,160
what kind of entertainment do they have?

612
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,235
They just like to hear some songs

613
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,338
If they've money
they will dedicate a song,

614
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,099
we won't force them

615
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,571
In case of typhoon,

616
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,542
they'll be very disappointed

617
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,705
At least, they don't play here

618
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,143
Yeah, but you should try

619
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,548
Maybe you'll have further development

620
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,820
In fact I've considered it,
but my mom doesn't approve it

621
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:14,582
Why?

622
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,124
I've to help her

623
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,262
We've to spend a lot to hire
a leading artist

624
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,662
If I could get a big hit,

625
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,197
it isn't bad

626
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,566
Let me get a chance to talk to your mom

627
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,366
Let's talk about you

628
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:33,532
Look at your long face,
watch the performance!

629
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,746
How come it is closed?

630
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,113
Blacky, what?

631
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,309
A new boss

632
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,987
No? It's the pay date

633
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,125
That's it

634
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,918
How come this guy is so heartless!

635
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,023
Let's go for him

636
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,057
Where do you go?

637
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,896
He'll be in deep shit if I find him

638
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,596
If you find him call me

639
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,528
Great

640
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,172
Do you need money?

641
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,331
Let me lend you some for emergency

642
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,506
Where are you going?

643
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,579
Borrow money! Do you think
I really want to borrow from you?

644
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,211
If you have an alternative,

645
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,347
then I'll save it

646
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,008
Wait for me

647
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,466
Your pals are great

648
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,763
Yeah! Their music is better than me

649
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,499
But poorer than me

650
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,735
Keung, you should be
in the nightclub, shouldn't you?

651
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,344
They've got a DJ
so they kicked away the band

652
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,812
And changed into a Disco

653
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,774
Tat is even worse, his shop
has been changed into a gigalo bar

654
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,750
Why didn't he stay behind as a gigalo?

655
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:53,889
I want to,

656
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,320
they told me a gigalo could earn
over $10,000 a night

657
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,551
However I'm just too weak

658
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,497
The world is different now,
man is more costly than a woman

659
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,331
The world is changing now,

660
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,163
the ball bottom is popular again

661
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,736
We're of the last decade already

662
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,364
Don't be too pessimistic,

663
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,804
your music is great

664
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,706
in fact you can write the lyrics and

665
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,540
maybe you'll become a big hit

666
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,714
They've tried lots of time but in vain

667
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,283
Is there anything wrong
with your lyrics and song?

668
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,385
Is it too artistic?

669
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,747
What's wrong with it?

670
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,786
I don't mean it's bad,
but it's not popular

671
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,117
There's many good songs in Chinese opera

672
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,123
but can't sing here

673
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,955
Interest and living are
two different things

674
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,391
You look young
but you seem to be a man of the world

675
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,227
Who are you?

676
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,867
Second leading of the Vocal Band Group

677
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:40,901
Nice to meet you

678
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,067
Nice to meet you

679
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:45,700
Have you ever been jobless?

680
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,340
No. Touch wood

681
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,512
Kid shouldn't interrupt
when adults are talking

682
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:50,805
Have your coke

683
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,175
I am in this field
much earlier than you guys

684
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:55,843
It must be...

685
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,011
you guys like to put on air

686
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,350
And not smooth enough
in handling human relationship

687
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:03,220
Or get fierce if people criticize you

688
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,260
Incorrigible

689
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:10,791
It's gone

690
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,101
Keung, come and have some wine

691
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,538
I don't want to talk anymore,
I don't want to irritate you

692
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,336
Don't you want to irritate me? Never

693
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,814
It's easy said than done

694
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,517
You must have connection

695
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,285
I see people's face
much more than you do

696
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,418
Let's try some other time

697
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,827
Are you upset about me?

698
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:44,999
No

699
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,328
If no... then tomorrow morning...

700
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,132
If you don't wake me up so early

701
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,103
Then I won't be angry, alright?

702
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,740
Look at you, you're sweat all over,
have a wipe!

703
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,856
No one here, it's impossible!

704
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,061
Should he be alright?

705
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,503
Kit! Are you alright?

706
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,810
Get up

707
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,187
Get up! It's 4:00 already

708
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,553
What's up?

709
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,395
Last time I've helped you,

710
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,362
it's my turn now

711
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,794
Let's talk about it later

712
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,175
Hurry... your uncle is very angry

713
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,276
I understand

714
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:02,974
Hurry up

715
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,777
Hurry up! The ferry will leave at 8:30

716
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,385
It's only 7:00, and you lie to me

717
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,752
If I didn't lie,
you wouldn't have waken up

718
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,617
Let's go

719
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:52,559
Grandpa, clam

720
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,759
That's mussel, stupid

721
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:00,501
Fight...

722
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:20,385
Alright

723
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:26,926
Be smart

724
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,135
Ling can fight pretty well

725
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:26,075
Last time, there came some bastards
She just kicked them away

726
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:26,977
Last time the leading...

727
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:29,379
of the next door took away her customers

728
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:30,642
and Ling just "pa pa pa..."

729
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,982
pounded her wig away

730
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,452
and made the uncle clap his hands

731
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,424
Don't you believe?
Don't you think I lie to you?

732
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:39,629
No

733
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:44,267
Just say it! I can take it

734
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:48,565
I just know people do have
their ways of living,

735
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,070
whatever you do,

736
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,034
you're betraying yourself

737
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,106
Yeah

738
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:55,569
But I think...

739
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:59,011
Ling has the potential,
she doesn't need to be like this

740
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,751
If I didn't see her sing

741
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,982
I'll think she is trying to...

742
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,678
Seduce people?

743
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,581
You're not the first one to say so

744
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,919
Let me tell you,

745
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,319
Ling starts singing long before

746
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,189
and she just wishes
to be the leading artiste,

747
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,595
and have the performance
in a formal theatre

748
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,263
But now the Lee theatre was gone,
and she says it's alright

749
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:21,665
Because there're still some cinemas

750
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,735
In fact, uncle has tried...

751
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,238
his best to help

752
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:26,303
However,

753
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,967
there's no opportunity

754
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,111
She has had a deep thought

755
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,509
before she agreed to sing here

756
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,649
in fact she's earned a lot,
but she's very mean

757
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:36,979
Last time,

758
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,815
she made you pay for the roasted snails

759
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:40,585
What's she doing with the money?

760
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,189
Buy some costumes, accessories...

761
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,761
and it takes a few hundred thousands

762
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,056
Don't you have to buy it yourself?

763
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,698
Of course! It's not TV shows,
there's no sponsorship

764
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:52,333
If I have the chance

765
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:53,935
I'll give your pals a lesson

766
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,798
Ling has never complaint before

767
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:56,940
She said if she works harder,

768
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:57,937
she can enjoy the fruit herself

769
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,633
If others get a fortune,
are they going to give you a share?

770
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,536
If you want to win the Mark-six,

771
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,045
you gotta go and buy it

772
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,942
Don't look down upon me,

773
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,141
I'm not big mouth

774
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,546
I've walked from the death,

775
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,153
don't you know?

776
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:14,783
You fought in Vietnam?

777
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:15,959
Similar

778
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,925
It's easy said than done

779
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,097
Maybe if I really face the problem

780
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,893
I may not know how to handle it

781
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,066
Anyway, I've got a friend like you,

782
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,601
you'll help me

783
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,204
I want you to do me a favour

784
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:32,738
We've just met,

785
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,877
are you going to borrow money from me?

786
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,171
You don't even has gas,

787
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:37,142
how will I dare to do it?

788
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,273
Indeed, I've a dream...

789
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:41,814
Wanna to build up your character?

790
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,250
How do you know
I don't have that quality?

791
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,054
Sorry

792
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,651
I mean I've sung so many cover-version

793
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,087
I'm not even acknowledged,

794
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,228
if I were dead, I'll regret

795
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,698
Come on. Don't be lazy, finish your song

796
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,563
Ask your pal to write the lyrics,

797
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,567
and send it to the record company

798
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,233
You can't just sit here

799
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,967
It doesn't help if you just sit here

800
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:08,637
As if you're helping me

801
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,570
Alright! I take you
to the record company for a try

802
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,210
Yeah, our group will be fantastic

803
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,349
If we work together,

804
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,010
we'll draw a big hit

805
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,051
Min! Min...

806
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,485
Fellow sisters...

807
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,090
Come

808
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,756
They're my fellow sisters, he's Kit

809
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:38,626
Sit...

810
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,165
Roast goose noodle

811
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:49,711
Is it good?

812
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,574
Delicious

813
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:52,605
Give you another one

814
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:54,308
What about you?

815
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:55,280
You eat...

816
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,014
We're just friends

817
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,353
Of course, aren't you enemy?

818
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,026
He refers me to the record company,

819
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,391
so I give him a treat

820
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,095
We can sing pretty well,

821
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:12,426
can we try too?

822
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,728
If I'm going to release a record,
you'll be my chorus

823
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,099
Come over here

824
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:19,172
Coming

825
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,433
Go over there

826
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,021
We've to leave

827
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,657
Stay longer

828
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:37,189
No, please take us ashore

829
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,096
Alright, ashore!

830
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,465
Where are you going?

831
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,237
Come here...

832
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,510
Just a minute...

833
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,574
Don't you want to have business?

834
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,944
Leaving? Forget it

835
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,216
Min, what's up?

836
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,516
What are you afraid of?
Do you feel ashamed just now?

837
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:08,953
You're afraid to be seen sitting with us

838
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:10,385
No

839
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,288
You are!

840
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,985
You don't respect
my fellow sisters and me

841
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:14,557
Do you feel ashamed to be with me?

842
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:19,229
I don't really mean this,
I just don't want to see her

843
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:28,172
Sorry! Don't be angry!

844
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,942
It's alright

845
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,321
Are you still angry?

846
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:42,723
No

847
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,021
That's good, I thought you're...

848
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,094
What?

849
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,222
Jealous

850
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,498
I'm

851
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:53,826
Can I?

852
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,140
Come with me

853
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,213
Where?

854
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:09,116
Let's tell her, you're my girl friend

855
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:10,245
Great

856
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,962
Next time, I want to dress better

857
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,954
Not necessary, you're very pretty today!

858
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:22,722
Let's go

859
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:23,866
No!

860
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,092
Why?

861
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:26,329
Next time

862
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,093
Why next time?

863
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,838
Where are you going?

864
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,623
I'm going home, good night

865
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,168
It's late, who is it?

866
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,041
Is it mom?

867
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,338
It's calling from the recording co.
They ask Min to go for a trial recording

868
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,711
I really thank you for your help

869
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,077
Let Min sing your master piece

870
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,920
But you see...

871
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,353
we have to do our business

872
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,317
if Min doesn't sing here

873
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,326
it'll affect our income

874
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,897
And Min is not free

875
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,692
This time...

876
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,302
I must make it clear

877
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,507
I think you know what I mean

878
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,412
Feel free to come again

879
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:06,926
Don't go

880
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,095
Why? I've come

881
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,132
Your mom doesn't want you to come

882
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,865
Don't bother about her!
She doesn't mean it

883
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,864
I don't think so,

884
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,503
what if you run into her downstairs?

885
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,971
Kit, don't drag on

886
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,612
Once it's decided,
there's no need to worry

887
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,714
Maybe we'll make it

888
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,644
Are you afraid I'll become another Tracy

889
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:34,180
Sorry, I'm too strong, don't get upset

890
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,050
I'm not upset,

891
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,786
I just afraid your mom won't like it

892
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:40,388
Let's go

893
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,497
Kit! You're great

894
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,401
All your girl friends
can sing pretty good

895
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:52,733
I think you better be the manager and

896
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,002
get your commission

897
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,673
See which songs you know

898
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:01,848
Aren't we going to sing Kit's?

899
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:03,881
His song is not ready yet

900
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,452
We've got all these MMO

901
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,683
It would be better you pick one you know
and we book the studio

902
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:11,292
And have your trial recording

903
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,695
The contract is ready, have a look

904
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:15,091
Thank you

905
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:24,637
Where are you going?

906
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,105
I've forgotten, I've an appointment

907
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:26,674
What's up?

908
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,003
Kit, she said
she doesn't want the recording!

909
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,612
But the studio is ready
Why don't you try?

910
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,541
Fatty, call me after you've finished...

911
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:33,682
with Kit's song, OK?

912
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:34,779
Let's go

913
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,312
Kit

914
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,318
Director

915
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,831
Quiet, it's the deputy not the director

916
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,399
It's the same!

917
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:54,196
Any candy!

918
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:55,897
These are for the kids

919
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:56,831
I'm

920
00:57:58,508 --> 00:57:59,270
Is he Kit?

921
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:00,498
How are you?

922
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,009
Buy me a red bean ice

923
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:04,404
Come on

924
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:05,681
How's he?

925
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:06,838
Tall and masculine

926
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,179
Min

927
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:10,113
Nurse-in-chief

928
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:11,212
Are you coming to visit us?

929
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:14,585
Why are you still so slim?

930
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,682
She only eats snacks,
of course not enough nutrition

931
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:17,822
Maybe Anaemia

932
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:21,023
Measure her blood pressure,
and get some blood sample

933
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,897
No! I'm alright

934
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,999
Go... Be quick

935
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,192
I'll wait for you in the canteen

936
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,431
Let's go to the canteen

937
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,336
When she was nine

938
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,811
Normally if a child gets bone cancer,

939
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:41,212
the chance to recover is very small

940
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,714
I don't believe at the beginning

941
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,184
Maybe it's a miracle,
her illness is under control

942
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:49,923
I still remembered

943
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:51,685
when she passed her
1st 5 years' observation period

944
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,522
We held a party for her

945
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,060
She was very lovely

946
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:58,996
She knew how to sing and dance

947
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,596
And she's not afraid of injection
and taking pills

948
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,831
The medicine is very strong,

949
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,498
not everybody can take it

950
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:09,670
What about her situation now?

951
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,174
Don't worry,

952
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,111
the 2nd observation period is over

953
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,718
She's recovered

954
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,110
Her will power is very important,

955
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:21,923
she's strong and optimistic

956
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:24,283
I've faith in her

957
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,127
But, it's strange

958
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,265
Why did she want me to talk to you?

959
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:35,527
She's dexterous

960
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,987
Be quick, it's coming

961
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:11,406
Kit, I've something to talk to you

962
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,444
But you don't need to come so high here

963
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,306
Maybe it's your pride that stop you...

964
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,415
from telling me your problems

965
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,052
For example your career problem

966
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,246
And your relation with Tracy

967
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,025
In fact, there's no big deal

968
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,054
I really want to...

969
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:33,987
share with you,

970
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:35,821
and tell you my history

971
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:38,300
Then you'll know how unlucky I was

972
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,935
God is really fair to you

973
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,227
But I feel that life is more important

974
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:43,427
So to me,

975
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,267
there's nothing that can't be solved

976
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,133
How can you be so optimistic

977
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,941
I was born to be like this

978
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:53,381
Maybe it's my experience?

979
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:55,875
But I remembered what my uncle told me

980
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:57,610
Not everybody are lucky enough to get...

981
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,345
what they want

982
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:01,147
Of course
it's good to have a house and a car

983
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:02,654
Are you going to cry if we got nothing?

984
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,450
So, we should be satisfied with
what we have

985
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,923
We're friends before,

986
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,295
but now it's different

987
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:12,530
You can't hide everything

988
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:15,296
Or sooner or later
we've going to quarrel about this

989
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,572
I guess that's the reason...

990
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,105
why Tracy broke up with you

991
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:20,968
Maybe...

992
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,980
my temper is too bad

993
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:27,314
Tracy is good to me,

994
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:28,973
but I treat her badly

995
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:31,080
Man is always like this

996
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:33,188
They treat their friends
better than his wife,

997
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,323
and express their temper to his family

998
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,422
How come you know everything...

999
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:38,821
just like an old woman

1000
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,490
I can't help it, because
I have a whole family of old guys

1001
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,331
So you have to speak out

1002
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,165
Are you going to tell me or Tracy?

1003
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,766
Of course you

1004
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:59,943
I've to tell you something,
but you can't laugh at me

1005
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,250
I've never been on a plane before

1006
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,448
So what?

1007
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:09,383
I've been on the train
and roller-coaster...

1008
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,827
Just a couple of times

1009
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,729
How come you don't even laugh?

1010
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,590
You said I was not allowed

1011
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:20,132
Come on

1012
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,496
I'll do it once...

1013
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:23,832
and you follow me, alright?

1014
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,971
Start! One, two, three

1015
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:40,414
Stop

1016
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:41,519
Not enough

1017
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:46,058
Again, one, two, three

1018
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:59,267
Aunty, I know you realise
Min and I are going out together

1019
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,238
I also know you don't really like me

1020
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,036
But if you don't approve,

1021
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,074
I'm afraid
it'll affect your relationship

1022
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:08,581
I don't really want to see...

1023
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,916
poor relationship between you and Min

1024
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,854
But I feel that I must be frank to you

1025
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:16,047
I really like her

1026
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,485
She had cancer

1027
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,522
I know

1028
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,258
Aunty, I hope you won't mind

1029
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,024
I don't feel alright about the way

1030
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,226
you handle this

1031
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,604
I can understand

1032
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:31,933
why you don't want us to be together

1033
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,376
Just because you don't understand me

1034
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:38,538
But I think you shouldn't stop...

1035
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,875
Min going for a trail recording...

1036
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:43,479
...For your business,

1037
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,621
Min wishes to be a singer

1038
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:46,884
She's a chance now,

1039
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:48,887
why don't you let her try?

1040
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:52,188
This is only an excuse

1041
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:56,097
As a mother who doesn't want her
to have a better life?

1042
01:03:57,066 --> 01:04:00,001
I don't want her to sing
on the street for good

1043
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,568
You've your point,

1044
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,401
because I really don't understand you

1045
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,305
So how can I trust you?

1046
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:15,316
Min wasn't healthy,
and she's suffered a lot

1047
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:17,746
I don't want her...

1048
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,888
to be hurt,

1049
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:25,185
in fact, I shouldn't bother so much

1050
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:26,952
Because I can't control everything

1051
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,125
As long as she likes it,
it's alright for me

1052
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,628
So you ask me out,
and from what you have said

1053
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:38,535
I feel that you really like her

1054
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:40,965
I'm glad

1055
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:44,309
You can go out with her

1056
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:54,948
Happy Birthday to you...

1057
01:04:55,124 --> 01:05:03,463
Happy Birthday to mom

1058
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:05,923
Make a wish!

1059
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,350
Best wishes to all of you

1060
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,312
Blow the candles out

1061
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,854
How old are you?

1062
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,788
Anyway I'm younger than you guys

1063
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,151
21. Just 21

1064
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,529
How come you've invited
so many Filipinos?

1065
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:40,234
Yeah!

1066
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:41,927
They used to be my mom's musicians

1067
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,333
They were the guys in the photo

1068
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,342
We're old

1069
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,520
Uncle Hung, help yourself

1070
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,282
I've told you not to drink so much!

1071
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,495
Have a sip!

1072
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:37,209
You have helped me...

1073
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:38,437
to beat those guys

1074
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,081
I've Asthma, they want to abuse me

1075
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:41,910
If it were before, they wouldn't
have been qualified to be my rival

1076
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,377
I know

1077
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:49,949
Min said
you're not going smooth these days

1078
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:51,657
Yeah!

1079
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:55,529
Afraid of what?
Youngsters have more chances

1080
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:58,596
Everybody got many chances in their life

1081
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,096
But it matters
if they know how to grasp it

1082
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:04,038
What about you?

1083
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:05,001
Me?

1084
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,666
I was too lazy

1085
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:10,910
When I was in the band, I was hot

1086
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:12,339
However I've spent my life chasing women

1087
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:16,108
But now I don't even have a wife

1088
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:19,287
But I will only blame my bad luck

1089
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:22,785
I never doubt my ability

1090
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:27,025
Remember, never question yourself

1091
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:40,874
You're out so early?

1092
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,710
No, I'm at home

1093
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:44,811
You've your telephone?

1094
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:46,305
Yeah! Go outside

1095
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:47,276
Alright

1096
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:52,679
A powerful mobile phone

1097
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:53,718
That's wonderful,

1098
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:55,857
I don't need to raise my head up again

1099
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,492
What's your no? I'll call you

1100
01:09:57,826 --> 01:09:58,918
How come you're so impatient?

1101
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,096
I'll treat you tonight

1102
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:05,261
You've got a job?

1103
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:08,766
Yeah! I'll play in Jacky's concert

1104
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:10,069
I've got the deposit

1105
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:13,498
That's great!
Remember to take me to the back stage,

1106
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:14,506
I like him

1107
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:16,608
See you downstairs at 8:00 p.m.

1108
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,940
Alright! You wears your suit,
I wear my make-up

1109
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,760
Don't laugh at me,
I've got only 2 dresses

1110
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:40,729
Do I look weird?

1111
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:47,132
You've shaved!

1112
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,274
Very cute!

1113
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:53,637
That's for you

1114
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,496
You make me almost faint

1115
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:11,960
Crabs

1116
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:13,732
Eat

1117
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:17,795
Let's go some places else!

1118
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:20,271
Why? You want to come here

1119
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:26,980
Look at this girl

1120
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:28,013
It's Min

1121
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:29,012
Min?

1122
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:33,079
Min is wearing dress?

1123
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:35,890
When she falls in love,
she'll wear dress

1124
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:38,587
And lipstick too

1125
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:45,363
If you go on, I'll not come again

1126
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,103
She's angry

1127
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,596
Excuse me everybody

1128
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:52,965
I just wish to enjoy...

1129
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,110
a romantic dinner quietly
with my girl friend

1130
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:56,505
I hope you won't disturb us

1131
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:58,108
Romantic...

1132
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:06,246
Let's be romantic

1133
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:30,738
Isn't it cute?

1134
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:31,811
Yeah

1135
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:33,912
Don't you like it?

1136
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:35,544
How much?

1137
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:36,650
$50

1138
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:38,477
No!

1139
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:41,485
My mom told me not to take other's ring

1140
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:43,421
Don't you regret?

1141
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,051
Let's go

1142
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:50,228
I'll buy it myself

1143
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:03,308
You said you don't want it

1144
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:07,337
Kit...

1145
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:11,184
Min, what's up?

1146
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:13,316
The pain!

1147
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:18,050
Calm!

1148
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:24,189
Min...

1149
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:27,560
What's happening?

1150
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:28,896
Call the ambulance

1151
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:31,973
Fetch the medicine

1152
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:09,642
Deputy Director, here you are!

1153
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:13,376
I know it must be my bed

1154
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:14,709
That makes my body sore

1155
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:18,018
I'm alright! Can I go home?

1156
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,633
Say

1157
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:41,935
From the X-ray,
it's found in your pelvis

1158
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,507
Injection will begin tonight

1159
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:54,679
I know you don't like to stay in ward,

1160
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:56,420
I've arranged a private room for you

1161
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,151
You may ask your mom to accompany you

1162
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,189
Or ask Kit to come, alright?

1163
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:01,521
Are you kidding?

1164
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,191
What's that?

1165
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:06,434
You said I'll recover

1166
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:08,759
But how come you take your words back?

1167
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:10,171
Min

1168
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,133
Shut up!

1169
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:23,747
How can you do this?

1170
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:26,010
You deny your words

1171
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:54,808
It's alright...

1172
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,384
I'm alright

1173
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:03,351
Get out

1174
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:04,787
Min, don't do this

1175
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:06,025
Get out

1176
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:41,625
I can't stay here

1177
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:42,860
Min, what are you doing?

1178
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:47,157
I don't want any injection!
I can't take it

1179
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:50,399
I don't want to lose my hair

1180
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:55,643
Min...

1181
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,022
Get lost!

1182
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:51,828
Don't do this!
The doctor is coming to see you

1183
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:52,932
Go away!

1184
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:55,535
Can't you hear? Go away...

1185
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:15,479
Don't worship him! He can't help you!

1186
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:16,521
Go to the hospital

1187
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,384
You can't say so. God will help her

1188
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,221
Granny, excuse me

1189
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,262
Please come with me to the hospital,

1190
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,159
leave me alone

1191
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:27,460
You know,
faith is more important than creed

1192
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:29,604
Don't you remember
how you used to encourage me?

1193
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:33,808
Kit, I know my business

1194
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:35,241
Let's break up

1195
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:36,035
Why?

1196
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,008
Don't you think
it'll make me feel better?

1197
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,180
You hurt me, don't you know?

1198
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,347
Let me do it please! It may help

1199
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:44,643
Go with me

1200
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:45,844
Don't force me

1201
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:46,850
Hurry up

1202
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:48,385
Leave me alone

1203
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:49,555
Where are you taking her?

1204
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:24,919
I know you can stand up!

1205
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:03,350
How is she?

1206
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:18,797
Keung and Tat do have a share,
it's our idea

1207
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:21,707
Take this to her family

1208
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,140
I want to see her

1209
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,386
I come to see you, don't you mind?

1210
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:46,025
I'm more than happy

1211
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:47,726
Please come in

1212
01:21:58,213 --> 01:21:59,237
This is for you

1213
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:02,581
It's beautiful, thank you

1214
01:22:04,886 --> 01:22:07,081
Kit's music is very good,

1215
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:08,584
our company has bought his piece

1216
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:11,258
And I'll be singing this song,
will you be upset about this?

1217
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:14,695
No! You're more suitable

1218
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:19,698
In fact I can't,
I only know how to imitate

1219
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:24,264
This is a wig! Isn't it ugly?

1220
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,841
You're very slim

1221
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:31,235
I can't help it

1222
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:35,247
If I know you're coming,
I'll wear some make-up

1223
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:37,848
You're pretty

1224
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:40,584
But Kit is getting haggard

1225
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:44,748
I ask him to go home,

1226
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,655
but he doesn't listen

1227
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:49,897
Kit is good to you

1228
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:54,324
Are you still thinking about him?

1229
01:22:58,006 --> 01:22:59,064
No

1230
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:05,242
I heard his friend say

1231
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:06,971
He become more cheerful after he met you

1232
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,346
and his laughter is louder than before

1233
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,953
Can you tell me
how can you make him laugh?

1234
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,152
Just cheer him up

1235
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:16,288
I've tried,

1236
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,583
but it didn't work

1237
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:25,092
Maybe he was in bad mood

1238
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:29,668
And you both are hot tempered

1239
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,338
Then you've to teach me

1240
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,202
Let me try this on the next guy

1241
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:39,941
When he meets disappointment,

1242
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:41,945
you should encourage him,

1243
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:46,815
when he is in bad mood, cheer him up

1244
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,290
When he's down, talk to him

1245
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:55,225
But never leave him

1246
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:59,097
Then he'll be alright

1247
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:11,778
In fact, it's just theory

1248
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:19,080
I know Kit still loves you

1249
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:23,252
He always thinks about you

1250
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:28,652
He won't take the initiative to call you

1251
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,626
When the time comes, you go and find him

1252
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:32,664
Don't talk like this

1253
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:37,163
I wish he's happy

1254
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:42,971
You'll recover, you'll be alright

1255
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:56,749
It fits!

1256
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,450
Look, you don't even need to alter it

1257
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:07,662
I want to go out again

1258
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:10,501
Haven't you said you've quitted!

1259
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,536
Everybody knows about Min,

1260
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:15,138
I guess no one will laugh at me

1261
01:25:16,177 --> 01:25:17,439
I still have some money

1262
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:23,841
Don't!

1263
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:27,210
What's happened to you?

1264
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,925
I used to be a bit mean

1265
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:33,859
But now...

1266
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:36,929
That's why I have money to lend you now

1267
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:39,764
How long can you help me?

1268
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,865
This house is going to be demolished,

1269
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:44,766
am I going to send these old guys
to the park?

1270
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:48,534
We gotta find a house for them

1271
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:53,839
Ling, this instrument is taking over you

1272
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:58,679
It's an antique, still in good condition

1273
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:31,915
What a pity!

1274
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:34,681
It doesn't really matter

1275
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:37,617
I know you'll write a better one for me

1276
01:26:37,892 --> 01:26:39,484
Sure

1277
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,991
I've something for you

1278
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:06,615
I've many deficiancy,

1279
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:09,188
when I love somebody

1280
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:10,847
I don't know how to put it in words

1281
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:13,018
And when I want to thank somebody,

1282
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:15,128
I don't know how to express it

1283
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,326
But I really thank you so much

1284
01:27:20,268 --> 01:27:23,169
You've changed me

1285
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,268
You propose to me just
because you feel grateful, don't you?

1286
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:30,809
No, of course not

1287
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:33,143
I'm serious

1288
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:38,181
Kit! I couldn't be a wife

1289
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,178
I may not be able to walk

1290
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:41,481
I'll carry you

1291
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:43,788
But I can't do the house work

1292
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:45,118
I can do it

1293
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:48,795
Maybe I'll die

1294
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:52,228
No! We won't die so soon

1295
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,197
We'll live at least up to 70 years old

1296
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:55,668
If you start to worry,

1297
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,361
you'll become old and ugly

1298
01:27:57,972 --> 01:28:00,304
We take away 2 years, then 68

1299
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:04,369
We'll stay together forever, alright?

1300
01:28:05,346 --> 01:28:06,904
If I really...

1301
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:11,785
I won't let you sit in the park alone

1302
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:16,255
You may only cry for a short time

1303
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:19,750
Woman like to be spoiled

1304
01:28:20,928 --> 01:28:24,728
Sometimes you may have to compromise,
but it won't harm you

1305
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,865
Tracy still loves you

1306
01:28:28,169 --> 01:28:28,999
Min

1307
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:34,231
You don't need to worry about my future

1308
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,109
When you're with me,

1309
01:28:37,278 --> 01:28:39,371
I've changed a lot

1310
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:42,415
There's only one thing on earth
that will hurt me

1311
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:44,676
If you don't marry me

1312
01:28:49,257 --> 01:28:51,157
I'll be hurt forever

1313
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:18,918
Will you marry me?

1314
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:22,483
Yes

1315
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:07,227
The nurse-in-chief said
you stop any pills

1316
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:10,795
Yeah

1317
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:12,939
Why don't you have injection?

1318
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:16,170
Those are poison

1319
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:19,539
Her leucocyte level
is getting lower and lower

1320
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:21,409
I'm afraid she can't stand it

1321
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,778
Can you think of any solution?

1322
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:25,782
I know she tries to stand the pain

1323
01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:27,181
But don't tell me you've given up

1324
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:28,720
I've not given up

1325
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:30,154
Nine out of ten kids...

1326
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:32,053
of my own were dead

1327
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:34,260
If it weren't her
who has given me some hope

1328
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,522
I would have quitted this job

1329
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:39,424
How can I... give her up?

1330
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:42,966
But how's her condition?

1331
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:45,269
I know she's trying to stand the pain

1332
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:47,005
I hope...

1333
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:49,006
she can get over it

1334
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:04,757
Don't... don't

1335
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:07,627
If she sees you like this,
she'll feel very uncomfortable

1336
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:12,822
Cheer up

1337
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:39,760
Why do you get up?

1338
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:42,690
If you want anything,
just tell me to do it

1339
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:45,223
I'm hungry

1340
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:47,697
Hungry, don't you want some milk?

1341
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:50,063
I want to eat red bean cake

1342
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:52,272
Now?

1343
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:57,537
It's alright

1344
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:00,537
Don't worry, it's just 10 o'clock,
I may get it

1345
01:32:00,715 --> 01:32:02,740
I'll go to check, you take a rest

1346
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:13,157
Wait for me

1347
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:18,688
Buddy

1348
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:19,628
What's the matter?

1349
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:20,596
Are they all closed?

1350
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:21,426
Which one?

1351
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:22,796
Is there any red bean cake?

1352
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:24,369
They've closed already

1353
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:04,895
Red bean cake, thank you

1354
01:34:11,946 --> 01:34:12,674
What color?

1355
01:34:12,913 --> 01:34:13,811
Coffee

1356
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:16,441
And one more white one
