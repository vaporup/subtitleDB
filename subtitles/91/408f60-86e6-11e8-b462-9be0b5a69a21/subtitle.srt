1
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,741
It's millennium year, besides HK

2
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:06,743
Macau also goes back to China.

3
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:10,242
It all looks prosperous and stable.

4
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:13,786
I'm Ho, from Macau.

5
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:16,280
There's nothing special about me.

6
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:19,583
But I want to tell you
a love story of a triad member.

7
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:22,027
This story occurs around me.

8
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:25,258
In Macau,
except porn and gambling industries

9
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:27,026
there's nothing else.

10
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:29,902
I am a waiter at a nightclub.

11
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:33,129
I work there because
my girlfriend is receptionist there

12
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:34,905
and I love her so much.

13
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:37,238
The boss of this place is Yu.

14
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:39,942
And recently
he has invited some new bosses

15
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:43,139
and that's Ben Hon
and Miss Thirteen from HK.

16
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:47,550
Tonight the boss he's serving is Cock.

17
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:52,082
In fact, I've known him since childhood

18
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:57,057
but I guess he has forgotten me already.

19
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:01,199
You two come here the first time,
so you must enjoy.

20
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:03,529
Let me get two beauties
for each of you, OK?

21
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:06,572
- So few?
- No, I'd prefer sitting here

22
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:07,867
Prepuce, come on

23
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:09,304
don't tell me you're still virgin.

24
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:11,308
Right, his ear.

25
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:13,709
- Prick at it.
- It's through!

26
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:15,781
Right, where're your assistants?

27
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,848
What assistants?

28
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:19,111
- You have many assistants?
- Miss thirteen.

29
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:20,345
She knows you two come

30
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:22,489
so she keep two beauties for you.

31
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:24,591
- She's so good to me?
- Coming.

32
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,756
Let me introduce my partner to you.

33
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:28,486
Brother Yu, come on.

34
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,930
Yu Yeung, Master of Macau.

35
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:33,225
There's no master in Macau anymore.

36
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:35,528
We business just do
some mischief business.

37
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,568
- I'm Cock.
- I've heard about you for ages.

38
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:37,795
- I'm Prepuce.
- I've heard about you for ages.

39
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:40,702
- Sit down...
- Cheers...

40
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:42,170
Have you sold the 323 yet?

41
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:43,775
Why? You ask me not to sell it
before it reaches $3.

42
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:45,002
On the contrary

43
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:47,680
I bought in 500,000 shares
when it was at $1.8.

44
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,383
Cock, do you buy shares?

45
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:52,946
Me? Last month I did the queue as others

46
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:55,078
and bought that...
I forget the name... tom. Dog. Come.

47
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:56,985
It's Tom. Com.

48
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:59,715
You went for the queue?
Your men queued for you.

49
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,588
I did tell you it's dog. Come.

50
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,788
Right, you dog come.

51
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,125
You take me as dog?

52
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:09,201
Mr. Yu, that 774 wants to set up website.

53
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:12,170
- Is it worth buying?
- Yes,

54
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,706
Everyone is sensitive to number recently.

55
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:15,866
They seem to bee hit by number spell.

56
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,272
But it is in trend now.

57
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:19,309
We must stick to the trend
being on the walk.

58
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:22,974
Right, our nightclub is doing
"selecting hostess on the internet"

59
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:23,913
You want a try?

60
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:26,178
So trendy? Show me how to.

61
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,480
Point at it.

62
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:29,885
Not that troublesome now.

63
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:30,956
You can find any girl
on the internet now.

64
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:33,583
From Beijing, Dailian, Harbien...

65
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:35,625
Even from Szechuan.

66
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:39,564
Isn't it better...
to see the girls actually?

67
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:41,827
Like now, I can't even touch them.

68
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:42,958
And I don't see then naked.

69
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,900
- There's one...
- Cock

70
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:47,404
- Sister!
- No problem...

71
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:48,473
You so care about me?

72
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:50,509
I've prepared a dozen for you.

73
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:52,305
I want one who is sweet.

74
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:53,739
I don't want tom boy.

75
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:56,141
You imply me?

76
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,317
Cock

77
00:04:57,451 --> 00:04:59,351
you know, Miss Thirteen
has changed a lot now.

78
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:01,521
Sure, everyone of Hung Hing
know you live together.

79
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:03,247
A gay or lesbian can become straight too.

80
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:07,023
No man wants me
so we work together for money.

81
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:09,185
Brother Yu, please give them some shares.

82
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,228
No thanks

83
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:13,527
I need not run the place
though I like girls.

84
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:16,363
You'd better find a girl and get married.

85
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:20,730
No girls will want
to marry people like us.

86
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,201
What about the Preacher's daughter?

87
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:26,040
She wants to learn Japanese in Japan.

88
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:27,771
I've parted with her for ages.

89
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:30,140
Who are you with now?

90
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:33,678
Stand still,
and let Brother Cock choose you.

91
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:38,353
where's no real love in this world.

92
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:41,518
I just love all girls.

93
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:45,825
Cock, choose the one you like.

94
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:48,698
The girl in black.

95
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:53,899
How is it, Cock?

96
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,668
Your taste has changed?
You love young girls?

97
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:57,534
I like her as she's cute.

98
00:05:57,678 --> 00:05:58,838
Want another girl?

99
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:00,946
OK, where's Prepuce?

100
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:02,639
No, I prefer sitting.

101
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,180
My mission is over, I'll leave now.

102
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,786
No, sister

103
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:08,286
I want to drink with you all night.

104
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:11,255
Damn you!
You are to get up at 10 tomorrow.

105
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:13,019
- What for?
- Watching the stock market.

106
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,388
What?

107
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:17,861
Stock market, it makes money, nuts.

108
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:19,295
Enjoy yourselves.

109
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:21,264
Prepuce

110
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:23,097
- You want some wine?
- Who are you from?

111
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:26,104
- Hangzhou
- Hangzhou?

112
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:30,833
From Hangzhou...
Must you take a bath so long?

113
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:32,878
Hurry up, I need it badly.

114
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:36,914
- Take a shower.
- Here comes Hangzhou beauty.

115
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:39,210
Is the West Lake in Hangzhou very pretty?

116
00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:40,216
Of course.

117
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:42,150
Someone says there're ten famous scenery?

118
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:43,847
Sure, have you been there?

119
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:45,117
No.

120
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,784
But I'll have the chance
to screw a Hangzhou girl tonight.

121
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:50,122
Take bath now, don't bullshit.

122
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:51,424
Why must you force me for a bath?

123
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:53,396
There's real show after the bath.

124
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,898
Real show after the bath?

125
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:56,468
- Right, go now.
- Is there candy.

126
00:06:56,604 --> 00:06:58,037
Yes, quick...

127
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,365
What are you doing?

128
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,607
Kid...

129
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:01,639
Take your hands off, what are you doing?

130
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:02,707
I've asked you to quit many times

131
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:03,775
but you never listen.

132
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:06,607
Shit, if I don't, how can I get money
to build a house home?

133
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:08,681
- You speak back?
- Don't beat women!

134
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:11,508
Brother Cock, she's my girl,
none of your business

135
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:14,777
- Come with me!
- Hands off, what are you doing?

136
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:16,979
You're daring!

137
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:21,252
Bastard, you disturb my VIP?

138
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:29,034
You must undergo what you've promised

139
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,434
She's a hostess, she must work out.

140
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:36,609
I only want to take my girl away.

141
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,745
Brother Ben, let him off, don't beat him.

142
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:42,211
Stop beating...

143
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:43,441
- Bastard!
- No...

144
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:46,052
Brother Cock... I'm Ho...

145
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:48,086
I'm Lok Wing Ho.

146
00:07:57,631 --> 00:08:00,794
I didn't expect to see you here.

147
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:05,367
She's Cutie, very cute.

148
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:08,534
We've been dating for 3 months.

149
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,777
I ask her not to be hostess,
but she doesn't listen.

150
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:16,144
I don't know
why I'm so jealous this time.

151
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:20,152
Brother Cock, thanks for helping me.

152
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:23,552
Or else... I... I don't know
what would happen.

153
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:25,048
Don't know?

154
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:28,726
The worse is you lose a hand or leg.

155
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,059
First dating?

156
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:39,503
Are you of age already, kid?

157
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,766
I remember...

158
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,209
I was 12 when my sister
nearly married you.

159
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:50,014
Now 19 years old, it's 7 years.

160
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:58,323
Why are you in Macau?

161
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:01,557
You forget I was born in Macau?

162
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:04,757
I see.

163
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:09,093
I remember asking your sister
when she moved in...

164
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,598
"I'm a mixed of HK and Macau."

165
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:14,531
- You remember?
- Yes

166
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,542
My name is Wing Ho

167
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:22,247
and Ho stands for Macau.

168
00:09:22,883 --> 00:09:25,909
My name means I belong to Macau forever.

169
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:36,354
Where's your sister?

170
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,155
She's in London now.

171
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:45,264
For a long time?

172
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,735
We only talk over the phone
several times a year.

173
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:52,806
Frankly speaking, Brother Cock

174
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:57,413
I want very much you become
my brother-in-law. It's really.

175
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,290
I want to be your brother-in-law too.

176
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:11,127
- Is it hurt?
- Yes

177
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:15,696
When I the first time moved in
a estate in the age of five,

178
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,900
I remember that
everything was so new to me.

179
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:29,047
Someone is moving in.

180
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:30,911
- A child.
- Go take a look.

181
00:10:32,686 --> 00:10:35,655
Where do you live?

182
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,418
Do you know us?

183
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:41,085
- Where are you from?
- Mom!

184
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:45,128
Ho, what's wrong?

185
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:48,194
- Someone bullied you?
- No!

186
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:50,895
Madam, we just want to help.

187
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:53,199
Don't call me Madam,
you may call me Sister Chin

188
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,072
Sister Chin!

189
00:10:57,377 --> 00:10:58,867
Take it upstairs for me.

190
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:06,618
Very cute.

191
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:08,485
This chick belongs to me.

192
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,179
Take it back, chick

193
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,893
Chick...

194
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:15,289
Gee, come and help.

195
00:11:15,996 --> 00:11:17,623
Chick, come and help.

196
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:23,426
Where are you from?

197
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,663
From far away, I'm a mixed.

198
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:27,103
You're a mixed?

199
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:30,210
Sure, I'm a mixed of HK and Macau.

200
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:31,538
I moved from Macau.

201
00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:34,670
- Then I'm mixed too.
- Are you?

202
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:38,307
Sure, I used to live in Saukeiwan

203
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:40,477
and now I live here.

204
00:11:40,654 --> 00:11:42,918
So I'm a mixed of Kowloon and HK.

205
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:44,683
Of course not.

206
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,060
- Keep the change.
- Thanks...

207
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:51,323
You live here?

208
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:53,626
Yes, your expression is weird.

209
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:55,758
No, I live over there.

210
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:57,937
Do you? What family members do you have?

211
00:11:58,071 --> 00:11:59,402
Mom and Uncle.

212
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:02,173
We're neighbors now, nice to meet you.

213
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:04,174
No problem...

214
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,744
And we become neighbors now.

215
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:10,713
- So don't bully me and my brother.
- OK

216
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:12,112
I'm called Gee.

217
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:14,117
You mustn't call me Chick from now on.

218
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,414
Call me Chiu Shan Ho.

219
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:16,545
No

220
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,023
I want to call you Chick...

221
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,621
Chick...

222
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:55,588
Bitch, you steal my book?

223
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:56,855
What? I'm going to pay.

224
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,191
You're going to pay?
You're going to fooling me.

225
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,493
I don't want it.

226
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:02,659
Don't go, I won't let you go.

227
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:05,328
- What do you want?
- I want to search you.

228
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:07,973
- I'll call molest!
- You threaten me?

229
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:10,837
You know who I am? I'm Tim.

230
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:12,536
Have you watched kung fu movies?

231
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,580
The evil man in there is me, Tim.

232
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:18,216
You won't let me search you

233
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:21,012
then you can never leave.

234
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:23,052
You bully a girl? Are you a boy?

235
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,054
Who are you?

236
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:26,785
I'm the here in movies! I beat evil men!

237
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:27,825
What evil men?

238
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:29,622
Don't panic, I'll protect you.

239
00:13:29,763 --> 00:13:31,162
Forget it, let's go.

240
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:33,027
Want to leave after stealing my book?

241
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,498
I didn't steal it.

242
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:37,831
She said she didn't.

243
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:42,038
Stop beating...

244
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:44,674
Stop fighting...

245
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:47,403
Don't worry, Cock can fight well.

246
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:49,710
You mean he can?

247
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:52,408
Don't worry, he can hold on.

248
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:57,418
You won't help him?

249
00:13:57,991 --> 00:13:59,822
- You know who am I?
- Hurry

250
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:04,992
Damn you! Kill you...

251
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:08,259
Damn you!

252
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:09,899
I'll beat you whenever I see you!

253
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:12,330
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

254
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:15,372
- Really OK?
- Alright.

255
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:32,757
Chick... come out.

256
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:35,486
What is it?

257
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,421
Your mom knows you had a fighting today?

258
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:41,932
She's too busy to take care of me.

259
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:45,004
- Why?
- She has to work.

260
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:46,665
You mean it.

261
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:49,502
My mom is strict to me.

262
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:53,874
I can tell your mom is furious.

263
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:55,514
Why don't you go to school?

264
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:58,580
I don't like doing homework.

265
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:01,686
It's simple, let me teach you.

266
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:03,286
No.

267
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,154
Your face...

268
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,025
It doesn't hurt, look it's OK.

269
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:09,920
I must thank you for today.

270
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:13,462
No, I should protect you.

271
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,589
Why?

272
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:19,667
You live opposite me,
so I must protect you.

273
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:21,637
What if I don't live opposite?

274
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:23,466
- I still will.
- Why?

275
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:26,134
I don't know.

276
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:27,644
Anyway, tell me if anyone bullies you

277
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:29,442
- And I'll stand out for you.
- All right...

278
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,312
- Do you hear?
- Yes, I do.

279
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:33,419
- I'll repeat it to you!
- Good.

280
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:36,989
- I'll forever protect you!
- Good.

281
00:15:37,624 --> 00:15:38,750
Say it again.

282
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:41,156
Protect me forever!

283
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:45,025
- Repeat again!
- Protect me forever!

284
00:15:48,468 --> 00:15:49,799
Let's play football.

285
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,560
No, it's boring.

286
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:52,568
Where to?

287
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:55,231
None of your business,
you're not counted in!

288
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:58,510
- We don't revenge?
- Sure!

289
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:01,078
I'll call you up tonight
and let's discuss.

290
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:03,613
I won't talk on, I must go now, bye.

291
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,447
Is he mistaken?
Is this Three-Man-In-A-Boat?

292
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:15,856
Chick, what are you doing?

293
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:18,964
I thought you wouldn't come
so I don't com.

294
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:20,066
Of course not.

295
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:23,134
But mom called me when I was leaving.

296
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:25,667
- She won't let you out?
- Of course not.

297
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:29,137
Stand up, now, quick.

298
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:30,334
What for?

299
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,738
Get up, come here.

300
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:34,880
Close your eyes. Don't move.

301
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,912
- It hurts!
- I'm very happy!

302
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:43,113
I like biting others
whenever I'm happy or upset.

303
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:44,484
You're nuts?

304
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:45,690
Of course not

305
00:16:45,826 --> 00:16:48,260
mom say I've made progress in school.

306
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:49,987
So she bought me a cassette player.

307
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,097
I can listen to Leslie's song

308
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:53,459
when I go to school now.

309
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:56,966
Good, your mom pampers you so much.

310
00:16:57,104 --> 00:16:58,571
If you will study hard...

311
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:01,139
your mom will pamper you too.

312
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:02,969
No way.

313
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,243
Now you don't go to school,
what are you going to do?

314
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:08,074
One need not always go to school.

315
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:09,978
I want to be a Boss!

316
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:12,312
I'll walk the world
with Prepuce and Wrinkle.

317
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:14,386
Boss? Boss of triad?

318
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:17,513
I'll not talk with you
if you become triad boss.

319
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,153
If I don't, others will bully me.

320
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,591
No one will bully you
if you behave yourself.

321
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:23,821
What about Tim?

322
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:26,262
If you stay away from him,
he won't find faults in you.

323
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:28,663
Anyway, I hate triad people.

324
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:32,862
You know why I come to HK
with my brother?

325
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:34,200
How come I know?

326
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:39,007
As my dad used to be triad boss in Macau.

327
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:40,113
I hate him!

328
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:43,848
What about you?
What do you want to become?

329
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:47,147
I want to study abroad
and make lots of money.

330
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:49,152
I must buy a house for mom and brother

331
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:53,190
and get a handsome rich man
who is good to me.

332
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,926
You're dreaming.

333
00:17:56,129 --> 00:18:00,065
Everyone must have his ambition.

334
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:02,531
Being a boss is also an ambition.

335
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:03,828
You still say?

336
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,562
Then I'll become stunt man
like Jackie Chan.

337
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:06,672
OK?

338
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:08,501
OK! Show me some kung fu.

339
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:11,736
- This is Seven Chop. Isn't it nice?
- No.

340
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:13,937
This is Dragon Fist, nice?

341
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,571
Do me some kicking.

342
00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:31,787
You fat bottoms!

343
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:33,831
Don't beat me...

344
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,525
Don't go, dare you throw at me?

345
00:18:36,636 --> 00:18:38,570
Fat bottoms, don't go!

346
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:40,965
Don't go!

347
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:46,008
Set fire! Quick!

348
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:51,479
Dare you bully my girlfriend again!

349
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:54,610
Let me burn your paperstand!

350
00:18:58,525 --> 00:18:59,583
Put out the fire now!

351
00:18:59,726 --> 00:19:01,990
You two bastards dare set fire?
Come with me!

352
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:11,527
My paperstand...

353
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:15,468
Compensate now!

354
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:18,942
- What are you doing?
- Compensate me now!

355
00:19:24,684 --> 00:19:26,743
Set fire? You burnt a horse

356
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:28,319
you know it's serious?

357
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:30,516
You'll be sent to jail, you know?

358
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:32,957
You do nothing but stir up trouble.

359
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:35,687
Now dad's paperstand is burnt down.

360
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:38,487
Boss Bee, we dare not again!

361
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:42,196
We live in the same estate.

362
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:45,327
We must help each other in future,
got it?

363
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:46,871
Shake hands and be friends!

364
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:51,976
Cock!

365
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:09,927
Cock, Prepuce, Wrinkles, Tim

366
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,958
are the 4 rascals in our estate.

367
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,626
Luckily my mom Sister Chin
can control them.

368
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:21,401
Collecting garbage!

369
00:20:21,574 --> 00:20:25,032
Take our all garbage!

370
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:27,839
You, he and me...

371
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:29,239
Chick!

372
00:20:29,382 --> 00:20:32,044
Softly, my son is ill.

373
00:20:32,252 --> 00:20:34,117
Chick is not the name? Call him Cock!

374
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:35,288
Mrs. Leung

375
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:37,356
why don't you
take your son to a doctor...

376
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:39,082
but keep him in here instead?

377
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:40,317
Keung, let's go to see the doctor!

378
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:42,427
When did your Chick become Cock?

379
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:44,029
Stop shouting.

380
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:46,724
We're not shouting.

381
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:49,130
- It's not noise control zone.
- Right.

382
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:50,167
And you, Mr. Leung

383
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,238
your son keeps stealing
porno books from my stand

384
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,271
I wonder if he's impotent?

385
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:57,735
What? My son is only 12...

386
00:20:57,944 --> 00:21:01,573
Mrs. Leung, when I was 11,
I began wanking...

387
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:03,112
I shouldn't have told you!

388
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:08,209
- Keung, let's go to see doctor!
- Return books!

389
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,781
Why fear? You fear your mom scolds you?

390
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:14,458
I don't fear that.

391
00:21:14,594 --> 00:21:15,652
- No? What do you fear then?
- Right.

392
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:20,661
Anyway... don't shout near here, OK?

393
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,826
- You live here, not the opposite side.
- Right.

394
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:26,768
Anyway, don't shout.

395
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:28,973
I watch it here.

396
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:31,009
If you must shout, go elsewhere.

397
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:32,372
OK...

398
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:34,670
- 100 for 1 set!
- Play 4 rounds!

399
00:21:34,814 --> 00:21:37,578
4 rounds, 3 fold at least!

400
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:45,624
Let me go first.

401
00:21:48,128 --> 00:21:50,528
- Where's your sister?
- Studying.

402
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,060
- Where are you going?
- None of your business.

403
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,632
Bastard, don't be busybody.

404
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:56,534
He's right.

405
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:57,761
You stand for that bastard?

406
00:21:57,971 --> 00:21:59,563
None of your business.

407
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:03,073
She's studying, Cock is wooing her.

408
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,674
Don't insult her, what wooing?

409
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:06,972
She's studying, we live opposite.

410
00:22:07,113 --> 00:22:08,410
We must look after each other.

411
00:22:08,581 --> 00:22:11,072
You'll soon become chief.

412
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:13,777
Sister Chin!

413
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,751
Chick, what is it?

414
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:21,359
Gee is studying, we don't make a noise.

415
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:23,723
You disturb her by standing here.

416
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,357
Go inside...

417
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:30,998
OK

418
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:36,004
And the English exam tomorrow
is important.

419
00:22:36,142 --> 00:22:37,700
Be good.

420
00:22:42,248 --> 00:22:43,806
Let's start!

421
00:22:49,422 --> 00:22:51,413
I sit here, you find yourself a seat.

422
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:54,452
- And you two sit oppositely.
- Troublesome.

423
00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:56,755
- Why? You fear someone will cheat?
- How to?

424
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,027
Quiet, OK?

425
00:22:59,432 --> 00:23:03,266
Quiet, don't disturb his girlfriend.

426
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:04,734
But playing mahjong does make noise.

427
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:05,962
What do you mean with noise?

428
00:23:06,105 --> 00:23:07,333
Haven't you heard this song?

429
00:23:07,474 --> 00:23:10,409
If you're in love, you lose money.

430
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:11,942
You'll lose much, kid.

431
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:15,046
- You'll lose much...
- Go on playing.

432
00:23:22,422 --> 00:23:23,787
Hurry.

433
00:23:25,358 --> 00:23:26,950
You lose all!

434
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:29,052
You pay me $128

435
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:33,331
Prepuce is right, if you lose,
means you're in love.

436
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:34,397
Is it finished?

437
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:35,865
It smells good, who is cooking?

438
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,628
Really.

439
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:40,263
Sister Chin does.

440
00:23:56,189 --> 00:23:58,555
She's always pretty.

441
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:00,989
Go to hell!

442
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:02,685
You pay me $128, time to eat now.

443
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:04,490
- Pay now.
- Hurry.

444
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:11,098
Frankly speaking,
does she know you love her?

445
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:14,496
I needn't make that so clear?

446
00:24:15,575 --> 00:24:16,769
Will she let you woo her?

447
00:24:17,844 --> 00:24:19,277
Man, she lives opposite me

448
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:20,969
and we've always seen each other.

449
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:24,514
We've been in good terms...
she should know?

450
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:28,514
Have you ever... made love with her?

451
00:24:28,655 --> 00:24:30,145
Shit! She's not that casual.

452
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,348
Not even a caress?

453
00:24:31,524 --> 00:24:32,752
- That means you never!
- No!

454
00:24:32,892 --> 00:24:33,790
Nothing ever?

455
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,327
Gee...

456
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:40,963
Look at her, what is she like?

457
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:44,465
She's a cute angel.

458
00:24:46,873 --> 00:24:48,170
Gee, what a coincidence?

459
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:50,799
- What a coincidence!
- We happen to meet here.

460
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,935
Of course not,
he comes all the way for you.

461
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:56,808
Where's that fatty and Wrinkles?

462
00:24:57,016 --> 00:24:58,779
Aren't you the Four-Man-On-A-Boat?

463
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:02,250
They're busy,
so I come to wait for you here.

464
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:05,050
- How's exam today?
- Not bad.

465
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:07,759
Lok Wing Gee, they're your friends?

466
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:09,756
They live opposite me.

467
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:13,127
This is Cock, this is Tim.

468
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:16,093
I won't hinder you, we'll leave now.

469
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:19,671
- Bye...
- Bye...

470
00:25:19,973 --> 00:25:22,601
- She called you Camel?
- Lok Wing Gee!

471
00:25:22,742 --> 00:25:23,709
Lok Wing Gee

472
00:25:23,843 --> 00:25:25,435
Why are you here?

473
00:25:25,845 --> 00:25:28,109
Your friend is pretty clever.

474
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:30,180
I'll leave now, won't hinder you.

475
00:25:30,316 --> 00:25:31,374
- So soon?
- Right...

476
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:33,747
- Sit for more a while.
- Bye...

477
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:39,283
- Where are you going?
- Back home.

478
00:25:42,795 --> 00:25:44,285
Why do you come here for?

479
00:25:44,464 --> 00:25:48,764
There's an amusing movie
so I come to ask you for it.

480
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:51,062
I know, "A Horny Man"

481
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:52,068
I want to see it too.

482
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:54,036
OK, I'll get tickets.

483
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:57,074
You can... take it as relaxation.

484
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,800
I've got it.

485
00:26:01,447 --> 00:26:02,607
You're so good to me.

486
00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:04,916
I have an appointment.

487
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:10,923
Sorry, Chick, my friend asked me first.

488
00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:15,819
- He has arrived, bye.
- Bye

489
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:17,853
You've waited for long?

490
00:26:18,431 --> 00:26:19,489
Gee!

491
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,892
Cock! Come here.

492
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,338
This is George, this is Cock.

493
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:30,837
Chiu Shan Ho!

494
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,800
Nice to meet you!

495
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:35,010
Cock lives opposite me

496
00:26:35,148 --> 00:26:36,274
we've grown together.

497
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,542
We're sort of buddies.

498
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:39,512
Sort of Buddies?

499
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:45,055
Cock, let me ask Ho
to see that movie with you.

500
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:48,256
It's time we leave, come on, bye.

501
00:26:48,394 --> 00:26:50,055
Bye.

502
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:57,262
Go home and see porn movie!

503
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:00,332
You play with me.

504
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:02,441
Press this...

505
00:27:03,242 --> 00:27:04,573
You've lose.

506
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:07,772
Stop bothering brother.

507
00:27:08,014 --> 00:27:10,676
Go and play there, go.

508
00:27:13,352 --> 00:27:16,116
- Hey, is her troublesome?
- It's Ok.

509
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:18,318
But I am bad at playing this.

510
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,789
We'll eat soon, wait a while.

511
00:27:22,161 --> 00:27:23,423
Are we really eating here?

512
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,625
Mom is the best cook.

513
00:27:27,366 --> 00:27:29,596
I want to eat Japanese food with you.

514
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:31,294
People say movie stars always go there.

515
00:27:32,438 --> 00:27:36,306
Next time, mom wants to chat with you.

516
00:27:37,944 --> 00:27:39,673
- Eat now.
- It smells good!

517
00:27:39,812 --> 00:27:42,781
Help yourself...

518
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:45,907
This is my mom's best dish,
Coke Chicken Wing.

519
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,518
- Eat one.
- Thanks.

520
00:27:48,888 --> 00:27:50,287
Mom, explain how you cook it.

521
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:51,822
I marinate chicken wings with coke

522
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:53,516
so they taste sweet.

523
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:57,485
Mom's Coke Chicken Wing
is my favorite dish.

524
00:27:57,797 --> 00:27:59,287
It tastes really good, Aunt.

525
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:03,026
It's better than those
prepared by restaurants.

526
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:07,330
George, where do you live?

527
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:09,033
Jardine Hill.

528
00:28:09,642 --> 00:28:12,440
It's rich area, isn't it?

529
00:28:12,712 --> 00:28:14,270
I want to see that area too.

530
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:15,812
I'll go too, I want to play TV games.

531
00:28:15,948 --> 00:28:17,279
Go to hell! Eat now!

532
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,974
My parents seldom stay in HK.

533
00:28:19,585 --> 00:28:21,849
George, where did you meet Gee?

534
00:28:24,157 --> 00:28:27,888
I met him in a library.

535
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,152
I'm not asking you.

536
00:28:30,263 --> 00:28:34,165
I went to borrow books, and so did she

537
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:36,867
then we met each other.

538
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:40,036
You young men are open.

539
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,570
- Eat now, come on.
- Eat more.

540
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:52,147
You snatch my girl? Go to hell!

541
00:28:57,523 --> 00:29:00,515
I got dumped, help me.

542
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,628
Can you comfort me?

543
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:04,523
Can you just comfort me?

544
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:07,626
Comfort my lips.

545
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:13,637
You're bad, come on...

546
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,173
How is it?

547
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,073
Don't shout...

548
00:29:20,446 --> 00:29:23,973
What are you doing?
Why don't you become my boyfriend?

549
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:25,674
Damn your boyfriend...

550
00:29:25,952 --> 00:29:26,850
What is it?

551
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:28,613
- I'll pay you... $90.
- No way.

552
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:30,119
Get me $100.

553
00:29:30,256 --> 00:29:33,453
Go away! I'll come for you later...

554
00:29:52,578 --> 00:29:53,476
How is it?

555
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,738
Tell me if anyone bullies you,
I'll teach him a lesson!

556
00:29:55,948 --> 00:29:57,779
None of your business!

557
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:04,787
I know none of my business

558
00:30:04,924 --> 00:30:06,949
but you live opposite me

559
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,594
so I must take good care of you.

560
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:17,626
I know you're not interested in me.

561
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:21,633
Of course I'm not as rich as George...

562
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:24,605
- He's born with a silver spoon.
- Stop mentioning him, OK?

563
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:29,109
He bullies you?

564
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,742
None of your business, I repeat.

565
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:34,179
You mean none of my business?

566
00:30:35,588 --> 00:30:36,816
Why can't you tell me everything

567
00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:38,423
just like when you were small?

568
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:51,633
You won't even do that?

569
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:13,790
He said, this estate is not for human.

570
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,489
Ass-hole!

571
00:31:17,063 --> 00:31:19,657
He even said he hates
my brother pastering him.

572
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,861
Ass-hole!

573
00:31:23,402 --> 00:31:26,496
He says he loves
the Coke Chicken Wing my mom makes.

574
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:31,001
Ass-hole!

575
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,174
You're nonsense, don't curse every time.

576
00:31:37,016 --> 00:31:41,544
He means to part with you.

577
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:44,351
Have you got some money from him?

578
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:46,519
What do you take me as?

579
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:52,994
Then... Has he slept with you?

580
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,567
Chick, mind your vulgar words.

581
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,533
You think so dirty.

582
00:31:59,905 --> 00:32:01,668
Of course I must make it clear.

583
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:03,274
If that ass-hole takes advantage of you

584
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:05,500
I will not only kill him.

585
00:32:05,644 --> 00:32:07,703
Everyone in this estate will kill him!

586
00:32:08,848 --> 00:32:10,611
I won't talk with you now!

587
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,746
I'm comfortable now.

588
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:18,647
In fact...

589
00:32:19,392 --> 00:32:20,723
I don't understand, not now

590
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,155
I didn't understand
when I was small already.

591
00:32:22,928 --> 00:32:24,361
Why are you so tall?

592
00:32:26,098 --> 00:32:29,090
- OK, I'm not short indeed.
- What?

593
00:32:31,937 --> 00:32:33,268
Thanks, Chick.

594
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,834
I won't think about that ass-hole again.

595
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:41,538
You shouldn't get along with
that ass-hole from the beginning!

596
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,841
If you want a man,
you must get one from our estate.

597
00:32:43,983 --> 00:32:47,976
They're all like you,
I can't get an ideal one.

598
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:51,222
What? At least I am not horny.

599
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:54,350
I want rice roll.

600
00:32:55,261 --> 00:32:58,628
OK, let's eat rice roll.

601
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:01,492
Eat it, and shit on him!

602
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:07,970
Stop!

603
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:11,069
Get off!

604
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,805
Get off!...

605
00:33:18,784 --> 00:33:20,615
Have you courted a girl
called Lok Wing Gee?

606
00:33:20,753 --> 00:33:21,811
What do you want?

607
00:33:22,021 --> 00:33:25,821
How dare you dump her?

608
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:27,219
No one can do that!

609
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,918
Aren't you Brother Cock?

610
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:31,120
What? Why are you stammering?

611
00:33:31,297 --> 00:33:32,594
I've parted with Gee already

612
00:33:32,731 --> 00:33:34,858
but I haven't wronged her.

613
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,332
You haven't wronged her?

614
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,970
You cheated her love, you've wronged her?

615
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:42,265
You screwed her, you've wronged her?

616
00:33:42,475 --> 00:33:44,375
- Have you screwed her?
- No

617
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,738
No? You must have held her hand!

618
00:33:46,812 --> 00:33:49,212
I don't care, you touched my wife.

619
00:33:49,515 --> 00:33:52,348
Now, in order to heal her wound.

620
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:55,916
- You must compensate $54,000!
- $54,000!

621
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:59,123
Brother Cock,
I don't have so much cash with me.

622
00:33:59,258 --> 00:34:00,225
No?

623
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,793
- Go and draw from ATM!
- Right.

624
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:05,954
Ray at once or I'll beat you
every time I see you!

625
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:07,458
Go!

626
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,449
- What do you mean?
- Come out.

627
00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:37,027
So late?

628
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:55,736
What are you up to at this late hour?

629
00:34:56,282 --> 00:34:57,715
I want to give you a watch.

630
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:01,419
Why give me gift?

631
00:35:02,254 --> 00:35:05,917
I bought you this
from my part time salary. Take it.

632
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:08,483
Why give me such valuable thing?

633
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:10,453
You know I will never take it.

634
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:13,930
I have reason, it's related to you.

635
00:35:14,466 --> 00:35:15,797
What's that got to do with me?

636
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:18,396
That bastard bullied you

637
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:22,235
so Tim, Prepuce, Wrinkles
and I want to beat him up.

638
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,239
- You beat him?
- Of course we must teach him a lesson.

639
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:29,211
He can dump everyone but not you!

640
00:35:29,748 --> 00:35:32,148
Did you injure him?

641
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:35,885
Nothing, just minor injure.

642
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:38,754
Doctor says he'll stay in bed
for 3 months.

643
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:41,419
You're too much!

644
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:46,363
What too much?
I asked him to compensate...

645
00:35:46,498 --> 00:35:49,194
to heal your wound.

646
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:50,996
So I bought a gold watch with this money.

647
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:52,330
I don't want it!

648
00:35:52,571 --> 00:35:55,938
You're no different from a triad member

649
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,503
Living in this housing estate

650
00:36:00,646 --> 00:36:02,511
all others take us as triad members,
though we're not.

651
00:36:03,749 --> 00:36:05,614
You can stay clean by yourself.

652
00:36:05,784 --> 00:36:08,446
No one asks you
to get along with the triad.

653
00:36:11,223 --> 00:36:12,713
Already.

654
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:14,985
What?

655
00:36:16,895 --> 00:36:18,726
Me and Ho Nam

656
00:36:18,864 --> 00:36:22,664
Tim, Prepuce, and Wrinkles
have followed a boss.

657
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,028
You've joined the triad?

658
00:36:28,774 --> 00:36:32,335
You've joined the triad...

659
00:36:32,511 --> 00:36:35,446
I hate triad members most!

660
00:36:36,448 --> 00:36:38,006
Good, triad society.

661
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,051
Triad members can beat others
and do blackmailing.

662
00:36:41,186 --> 00:36:43,416
They are up to doing all evil deeds!

663
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:47,219
- I won't talk with you anymore!
- Gee...

664
00:36:49,028 --> 00:36:50,518
Gee...

665
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:20,321
So lonely? Where's your Cheese cake?

666
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:25,421
- What Cheese?
- I mean Gee.

667
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:28,623
Let's eat in night bazaar tonight.

668
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:30,428
You'll treat, Brother Cock?

669
00:37:31,403 --> 00:37:33,098
I've put the gold watch to pawn shop

670
00:37:33,238 --> 00:37:35,331
I've got lots of money,
let's eat like king.

671
00:37:35,574 --> 00:37:37,542
Didn't you want to send Gee
the gold watch?

672
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:39,505
She rejected it, she won't take it.

673
00:37:42,581 --> 00:37:43,775
Sister, Brother Cock.

674
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:48,911
Go!

675
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:03,162
Wait...

676
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:07,226
Can we get into position, Boss?

677
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,367
No warm up needed now?

678
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:11,901
Tim, go, beat him!

679
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:17,840
Earth Monster, Earth worm... no.

680
00:39:19,278 --> 00:39:21,678
Sucking... no, rubbing the knees!

681
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:24,806
Right! Kick at his legs hard!

682
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,508
Try to get this!

683
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:28,483
Great, I've got it!

684
00:39:28,654 --> 00:39:31,248
- How can you do that?
- Come out a bit more...

685
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,957
Left...

686
00:39:33,091 --> 00:39:35,252
So hardworking? Want to kill others?

687
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:36,858
Boss!

688
00:39:37,563 --> 00:39:40,088
So lonely? You don't woo girls with them?

689
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:41,596
Woo girls?

690
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:45,968
Boss, when will you take us
to shopping area?

691
00:39:47,105 --> 00:39:48,538
You want a fame?

692
00:39:48,674 --> 00:39:49,868
Of course we do!

693
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:51,270
We mustn't forever stay here?

694
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,436
We must see the world to make a fame.

695
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:57,572
- You want a fame?
- Of course.

696
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,577
or else I can't improve life.

697
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,179
Furthermore, if I have no fame...
no one will know you.

698
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:06,822
You mean it, good!

699
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:11,553
- I'll take you to disco tonight!
- Yeah!

700
00:40:12,764 --> 00:40:14,994
I've an appointment with the Fukienese.

701
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:17,192
They always steal Mercedes
and Volvo cars.

702
00:40:17,936 --> 00:40:20,530
It's evil to steal cars.

703
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,907
It's just make a living.

704
00:40:25,844 --> 00:40:27,334
I hear you're frustrated.

705
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:31,674
I'm fine.

706
00:40:32,684 --> 00:40:33,844
Just be smart.

707
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,017
Boss!

708
00:40:43,462 --> 00:40:46,056
Foreign girl! Boss, blond hair!

709
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:48,566
Tim, you'll like her!

710
00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:55,270
Beautiful...

711
00:40:55,407 --> 00:40:56,704
Can we touch her, Boss?

712
00:40:57,175 --> 00:40:59,666
There're many girls here!
I'll have a great time now!

713
00:41:01,513 --> 00:41:03,913
How is the container truck affairs?

714
00:41:04,316 --> 00:41:06,580
It's fixed, Boss, very safe.

715
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:08,919
Are you sure? Just don't spoil it.

716
00:41:09,388 --> 00:41:11,015
Brother Fook, Brother Bee has come.

717
00:41:11,156 --> 00:41:13,818
- Has he?
- Come in.

718
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:15,392
- Brother Bee!
- Brother Fook!

719
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:17,722
I'm sorry... I come late...

720
00:41:17,863 --> 00:41:19,421
It's OK... Sit down...

721
00:41:19,565 --> 00:41:20,759
- Great Brother Fook.
- Brother Fook!

722
00:41:20,899 --> 00:41:22,423
Sit down...

723
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:25,233
These are the new force from the estate.

724
00:41:25,404 --> 00:41:26,598
- Are they?
- Please teach us more.

725
00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:28,030
Good youngsters

726
00:41:28,173 --> 00:41:31,142
You're lucky to have Bee as Boss.

727
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,110
You'll surely make a fame.

728
00:41:35,514 --> 00:41:37,345
- You're mighty.
- What?

729
00:41:37,482 --> 00:41:38,642
It's reported in papers,

730
00:41:38,817 --> 00:41:40,250
8 Mercedes are stolen.

731
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:43,819
- You must have made a big profit.
- Just a little.

732
00:41:44,156 --> 00:41:46,681
- Mamasan, bring your hostesses in!
- OK

733
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:49,926
- Young men, cheers!
- Come on...

734
00:41:50,062 --> 00:41:52,860
Brother Bee, for your health and money!

735
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:55,659
- You too...
- Cheers!

736
00:41:59,037 --> 00:42:00,698
Brother Fook, can we eat this watermelon?

737
00:42:00,872 --> 00:42:02,965
Sure, help yourselves...

738
00:42:03,342 --> 00:42:04,741
These kids are impolite...

739
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:07,002
Mamasan, get us more watermelon!

740
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,908
Brother Fook, here come the hostesses.

741
00:42:11,116 --> 00:42:11,878
The girls have come...

742
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:13,917
How to arrange for them to sit?

743
00:42:14,052 --> 00:42:15,451
I don't dare who you are.

744
00:42:15,587 --> 00:42:17,680
If you are here, you must get one!

745
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,154
Tall girl, where do you want to go?

746
00:42:21,293 --> 00:42:22,624
Come and sit here.

747
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:24,888
Fei, Brother Fook wants you, go at once.

748
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:26,792
- Come here...
- Sit with Brother Fook

749
00:42:26,932 --> 00:42:28,524
and serve him well.

750
00:42:28,734 --> 00:42:30,668
- Very good.
- Not bad...

751
00:42:31,637 --> 00:42:34,105
Let me kiss you! Come on...

752
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:36,230
Drink with Brother Fook.

753
00:42:36,575 --> 00:42:37,837
You're shy?

754
00:42:38,377 --> 00:42:39,605
Brother Fook, cheers.

755
00:42:39,878 --> 00:42:41,641
You're not like a whore.

756
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,042
- Right.
- I like that!

757
00:42:43,181 --> 00:42:46,617
Brother Fook, it's her second day here.

758
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:48,219
She's fresh here.

759
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:50,878
Fei? Fei...

760
00:42:51,223 --> 00:42:54,317
Fei, I'll take you tonight! Come on...

761
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:56,321
Very pure.

762
00:42:56,461 --> 00:42:57,951
Do you know she works here?

763
00:42:59,431 --> 00:43:00,989
- Drink with Brother Fook!
- Come on.

764
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:03,198
Come, don't be shy.

765
00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:05,397
Brother Fook, cheers.

766
00:43:05,904 --> 00:43:06,962
I dare say...

767
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:10,040
No one is as competent as me
with dealing with Mainlander.

768
00:43:10,175 --> 00:43:12,040
It's not easy to smuggle cars.

769
00:43:12,177 --> 00:43:14,668
There're lets of obstacles, Brother Bee.

770
00:43:15,447 --> 00:43:19,008
Everyone knows you have
good relation up there.

771
00:43:19,918 --> 00:43:21,545
Not only with good relation

772
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:23,120
but my dick is getting hard on.

773
00:43:23,255 --> 00:43:25,587
Come and touch it, come on.

774
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:27,851
Touch it, and see if it's hard. Come on.

775
00:43:27,993 --> 00:43:29,654
Brother Fook! Take it easy!

776
00:43:30,328 --> 00:43:31,818
What do you mean?
Who do you think you are?

777
00:43:35,534 --> 00:43:38,094
- Man, what is your name?
- I'm called Cock!

778
00:43:40,105 --> 00:43:41,402
I didn't mean bad.

779
00:43:43,075 --> 00:43:45,635
Sorry, Brother Fook, he's drunk, sorry.

780
00:43:45,777 --> 00:43:46,903
I am not drunk, Boss.

781
00:43:48,246 --> 00:43:50,840
- What do you want?
- I want to take your girl.

782
00:43:50,982 --> 00:43:52,847
- What?
- She's my wife!

783
00:43:56,455 --> 00:43:57,979
I didn't know she works as a clubgirl.

784
00:43:59,357 --> 00:44:01,291
- She's your wife?
- Yes.

785
00:44:02,828 --> 00:44:05,353
Man, let me tell you.

786
00:44:05,964 --> 00:44:08,899
She's hostess here, and gets my money.

787
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:13,833
And... who are you
to talk to me like this?

788
00:44:21,413 --> 00:44:24,177
But I like you as you're daring

789
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:25,743
I like guys as you.

790
00:44:25,884 --> 00:44:27,875
Tall girl, come here!

791
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:29,452
Go home with your husband!

792
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:31,680
Manasan, get me a hostess with big busts!

793
00:44:31,823 --> 00:44:33,415
Sure...

794
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:40,025
- Brother Fook, I'm really sorry.
- It's alright now. Be alert!

795
00:44:40,165 --> 00:44:44,124
Brother Fook, I... I didn't mean bad.

796
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,937
She's really my wife.
We've been quarrelling recently.

797
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,638
She looks through me now.

798
00:44:52,978 --> 00:44:54,639
I know she works here to irritate me.

799
00:44:55,447 --> 00:44:58,177
Right? You mean to make me angry!

800
00:44:59,785 --> 00:45:00,979
Gee!

801
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,645
Why? Kid, go and chase her now!

802
00:45:03,922 --> 00:45:06,083
Chase now! Woman are simple.

803
00:45:06,224 --> 00:45:09,489
Go and make love with her,
then she'll calm down.

804
00:45:09,628 --> 00:45:11,118
Go!

805
00:45:13,932 --> 00:45:16,799
- Nuts. Brother Bee, cheers!
- Come on...

806
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:17,991
What's his name?

807
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:19,700
He's called Cock.

808
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:22,806
Cock? Good name...

809
00:45:24,242 --> 00:45:25,140
Lok Wing Gee, stand there!

810
00:45:25,343 --> 00:45:26,332
Go away! I don't want to see you!

811
00:45:26,545 --> 00:45:28,706
Why do you work at nightclub?

812
00:45:28,947 --> 00:45:30,073
I want to make money.

813
00:45:30,215 --> 00:45:32,046
Tell me if you do, I'll help you.

814
00:45:32,751 --> 00:45:36,118
I need $150,000, can you help me?

815
00:45:37,422 --> 00:45:40,516
I've borrowed $120,000 salary,
so I must work.

816
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:42,391
I must go back now.

817
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:44,151
Why do you need so much?

818
00:45:46,464 --> 00:45:49,865
Mom is sick,
we need money for her operation.

819
00:45:51,303 --> 00:45:52,327
Go away!

820
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:54,496
I don't care

821
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:56,732
I've paid for you tonight,
I'm your customer.

822
00:45:57,475 --> 00:45:59,909
What do you take me as?

823
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:02,012
What do you think then?

824
00:46:02,447 --> 00:46:03,971
You really want to be a whore?

825
00:46:04,149 --> 00:46:05,844
I ask you, if the boss just then...

826
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:08,815
wants to sleep with you, what'll you do?

827
00:46:10,455 --> 00:46:11,649
Mamasan will help me out.

828
00:46:11,823 --> 00:46:14,656
Mamasan will help me.
Which mamasan will help you?

829
00:46:14,793 --> 00:46:16,784
You'd better trust me!

830
00:46:17,195 --> 00:46:18,594
What for?

831
00:46:19,064 --> 00:46:20,861
Can you help me? You have money?

832
00:46:20,999 --> 00:46:22,057
What do you take yourself as?

833
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,599
You're just a lousy scoundrel!

834
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:28,999
Right, I'm a lousy scoundrel.

835
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,472
I'm not rich, what about you?

836
00:46:32,043 --> 00:46:33,874
You're a rich girl?

837
00:46:34,045 --> 00:46:35,910
You're pretty? But you're now a whore.

838
00:46:36,114 --> 00:46:37,513
Right, we're the perfect couple.

839
00:46:37,716 --> 00:46:39,616
You're a whore, me a scoundrel...

840
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:43,710
Get lost! I don't want to be
a couple with you. Go away.

841
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:47,154
You think you're very special?

842
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:49,824
Why stay here when you can't help me?

843
00:46:49,961 --> 00:46:51,394
I must work now.

844
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:54,198
Why, a quarrel?

845
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:57,768
You're making a show?

846
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:00,128
Why are you dressed like this?

847
00:47:00,272 --> 00:47:02,638
Come on, try her.

848
00:47:02,807 --> 00:47:04,104
- Can I?
- Try her...

849
00:47:04,242 --> 00:47:08,474
- Is she bouncy?
- Very bouncy.

850
00:47:08,613 --> 00:47:09,807
Again.

851
00:47:09,948 --> 00:47:11,848
I'll show you one more time.

852
00:47:16,021 --> 00:47:17,283
Stop fighting!

853
00:47:36,241 --> 00:47:37,731
I'm always this lousy.

854
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:41,242
You're injured.

855
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,269
Lok Wing Gee

856
00:47:43,715 --> 00:47:45,546
remember when you moved here at first

857
00:47:45,684 --> 00:47:46,981
that Tim bullied you hard

858
00:47:47,218 --> 00:47:48,947
and that I beat him up?

859
00:47:50,488 --> 00:47:53,286
Chiu Shan Ho, you're not a child anymore.

860
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,024
I just want to tell you,
if anyone bullies you

861
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,828
I'll stand out for you.

862
00:48:03,768 --> 00:48:06,362
I will not only beat him,
I'll kill him too!

863
00:48:07,505 --> 00:48:08,699
Nuts.

864
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,068
Yes, I'm nuts! Where are you going now?

865
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:11,140
I go back to work.

866
00:48:11,276 --> 00:48:12,243
Why must you go back to work?

867
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,105
I go to change clothes.

868
00:48:14,546 --> 00:48:16,946
You thinks I want to wear this?

869
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:19,416
No, you look good in that.

870
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,319
Gee didn't tell my you were in hospital

871
00:48:27,692 --> 00:48:29,284
or I would have visited you.

872
00:48:29,894 --> 00:48:31,225
Anyway, we live opposite.

873
00:48:31,763 --> 00:48:35,460
What's that go to do?
You are never home.

874
00:48:37,802 --> 00:48:41,898
Do you have good business
with Brother Bee?

875
00:48:44,476 --> 00:48:46,671
Being a scoundrel is never a good job.

876
00:48:48,213 --> 00:48:49,544
What are you looking?

877
00:48:49,914 --> 00:48:52,508
You must study hard,
and don't turn bad, OK?

878
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:55,980
Hey, you want to correct my son?

879
00:48:56,955 --> 00:49:00,152
No, I know I am not up to that.

880
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,585
- Mom.
- Did I say something wrong?

881
00:49:05,296 --> 00:49:07,628
Can you respect my mother?

882
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:12,397
None of his faults, I have sore throat.

883
00:49:13,071 --> 00:49:17,531
Gee, you and Ho go and ask a nurse in.

884
00:49:26,518 --> 00:49:28,850
Sister Chin, you'll be alright soon.

885
00:49:29,821 --> 00:49:33,348
Gee works very hard for your illness.

886
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:36,123
I know she's a good daughter.

887
00:49:36,928 --> 00:49:40,523
Chick, you really love Gee?

888
00:49:47,272 --> 00:49:48,864
But Gee will never love me.

889
00:49:50,442 --> 00:49:53,707
She's not a rich girl at all.

890
00:49:55,547 --> 00:49:57,014
I'm a scoundrel.

891
00:49:58,416 --> 00:50:01,442
If I'm smart, I can be a boss

892
00:50:02,854 --> 00:50:04,981
if not, I'll be small potato forever.

893
00:50:06,524 --> 00:50:07,855
Gee is different.

894
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:13,024
I think she must have
her plan for future.

895
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,827
But we can't always fulfill our plan.

896
00:50:21,206 --> 00:50:22,571
Just like me

897
00:50:23,274 --> 00:50:27,233
I never expected to marry Gee's father

898
00:50:27,946 --> 00:50:30,380
I thought I could get a perfect husband

899
00:50:31,683 --> 00:50:33,674
but we parted at last.

900
00:50:43,128 --> 00:50:46,620
When I was small,
I found you very strong

901
00:50:47,966 --> 00:50:51,766
as you alone raised two children.

902
00:50:54,072 --> 00:50:55,733
You're very great.

903
00:50:58,576 --> 00:51:02,103
In fact, I'm a loser.

904
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:05,041
I only want my daughter

905
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:07,941
finds someone who loves her.

906
00:51:08,753 --> 00:51:14,419
Chick, will you love Gee
with whole heart?

907
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:27,095
I always thought... you hate me.

908
00:51:32,377 --> 00:51:36,313
There're kind-hearted scoundrels too.

909
00:51:37,315 --> 00:51:40,250
Maybe you'll be a good man.

910
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:57,364
I'll treat Gee well.

911
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:06,607
Time for injection, please wait outside.

912
00:52:24,462 --> 00:52:25,952
What did mom tell you?

913
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:34,463
When I grow up, I know what fate is.

914
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,532
Sister worked so hard
for mom's medical expenses.

915
00:52:40,178 --> 00:52:43,170
After so many incidents, I begin to know

916
00:52:43,314 --> 00:52:45,407
why my girlfriend becomes hostess.

917
00:52:46,017 --> 00:52:49,145
Mom died two months later

918
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,818
and Brother Cock accompanied my sister
to Macau, as he had promised.

919
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:54,584
How come there's no taxi?

920
00:52:56,861 --> 00:52:58,192
Cock!

921
00:52:59,664 --> 00:53:01,063
Where're you going with this stuff?

922
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:02,925
I'm going to Macau with Gee.

923
00:53:03,067 --> 00:53:04,898
Why to Macau? Take the next hydrofoil.

924
00:53:05,036 --> 00:53:06,333
Come chat with me.

925
00:53:06,604 --> 00:53:07,866
Boss, I don't want to go.

926
00:53:08,006 --> 00:53:09,701
You know, Sister Chin is dead

927
00:53:09,941 --> 00:53:12,341
and I promised I'd
take care of her children.

928
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:15,777
You said you wanted to go last time,
come on!

929
00:53:15,913 --> 00:53:17,505
- It's no good, Boss.
- Come on!

930
00:53:19,617 --> 00:53:20,982
Anyone answers?

931
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,680
Brother Cock doesn't answer.

932
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:27,551
What's wrong?

933
00:53:29,627 --> 00:53:32,994
Eat some roast goose, it's delicious!

934
00:53:33,498 --> 00:53:35,329
No, Thanks.

935
00:53:35,566 --> 00:53:37,898
What are we going to discuss?

936
00:53:38,269 --> 00:53:40,430
Never mind, since Boss takes us here

937
00:53:40,571 --> 00:53:42,198
of course we must eat.

938
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,672
Don't hurry, Gee will wait for you.

939
00:53:45,076 --> 00:53:47,738
You freshmen are not bad.

940
00:53:48,946 --> 00:53:51,642
Brother Fook, you won't just ask us
to eat roast goose.

941
00:53:52,016 --> 00:53:52,983
Nothing...

942
00:53:53,117 --> 00:53:54,084
I'm going to Macau.

943
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,150
but you bring me here.
What are we going to discuss?

944
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:58,152
Gee is waiting for me at the pier,
you know?

945
00:54:04,028 --> 00:54:06,519
Tim, they hide weapons under the table.

946
00:54:06,831 --> 00:54:09,561
They say some guys from Hung Hing
want to snatch my places.

947
00:54:09,701 --> 00:54:12,033
They are also going to
use speed boats to smuggle cars.

948
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,195
Brother Fook, are you suspecting us?

949
00:54:14,572 --> 00:54:16,267
Boss Bee, you mustn't say so.

950
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:18,739
We're buddies.

951
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,207
We must take initiation.

952
00:54:23,381 --> 00:54:24,712
You bastard! Kwan!

953
00:54:33,658 --> 00:54:35,125
Boss! Run!

954
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:04,846
Macau has changed a lot.

955
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:07,711
The pier used to be tiny

956
00:56:08,286 --> 00:56:11,813
and now there's helicopter service too.

957
00:56:16,427 --> 00:56:17,917
Where did you settle your mom's ash?

958
00:56:18,729 --> 00:56:20,094
Hau Cee Cemetery.

959
00:56:23,968 --> 00:56:28,098
Both your mom and sister are tough women.

960
00:56:28,573 --> 00:56:31,804
That time if you left with us

961
00:56:32,477 --> 00:56:33,944
it would be wonderful.

962
00:56:37,782 --> 00:56:44,119
In this world... everything is destined.

963
00:56:47,124 --> 00:56:49,115
I didn't go to Macau with your sister

964
00:56:50,094 --> 00:56:53,427
because I had to begin my fugitive life.

965
00:56:55,566 --> 00:56:59,263
Boss, how to go to 2728, So Koo Bay?

966
00:56:59,437 --> 00:57:00,597
You want to look for Foul Wah?

967
00:57:00,738 --> 00:57:02,205
He's my cousin.

968
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,739
That boat over there

969
00:58:10,675 --> 00:58:12,233
Damn it!

970
00:58:13,377 --> 00:58:15,345
You peep at me?

971
00:58:18,182 --> 00:58:19,547
What do you mean?

972
00:58:19,684 --> 00:58:21,845
Run... where can you run? Peep at me?

973
00:58:21,986 --> 00:58:22,953
I didn't peep at you.

974
00:58:23,087 --> 00:58:24,520
I just looked at you wash your hair!

975
00:58:24,655 --> 00:58:25,485
Damn it! You peep at me?

976
00:58:25,623 --> 00:58:28,490
Damn! What did you said.

977
00:58:28,626 --> 00:58:31,720
- You... take it easy!
- Bastard! Damn you!

978
00:58:31,862 --> 00:58:35,229
- What are you doing?
- I come to look for someone...

979
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,198
Who?

980
00:58:37,335 --> 00:58:38,859
My cousin, Foul Wah.

981
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:42,667
You're Cock?
Your cousin has just gone to Taiwan.

982
00:58:42,807 --> 00:58:43,796
He told me before he left

983
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:45,340
that you'd come.

984
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:46,674
You're sister-in-law?

985
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,141
Right, come here...

986
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:52,612
This is cousin of your brother-in-law.

987
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,843
Something happened to him,
so he takes shelter here.

988
00:58:55,553 --> 00:58:56,986
So it's a scoundrel on the run.

989
00:58:57,121 --> 00:59:00,090
Don't bullshit! I speak your dialect.

990
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,725
She's my sister, call her Chu.

991
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:05,588
Sister, when are you going to put him?

992
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,127
Of course on the fishing raft.

993
00:59:08,132 --> 00:59:10,293
Cock, I have a shop in HK.

994
00:59:10,468 --> 00:59:11,833
so I often go outside.

995
00:59:12,003 --> 00:59:14,528
Stay here, though the place is small.

996
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:19,207
No, it's a nice place here, fresh air.

997
00:59:19,644 --> 00:59:22,477
There's fish to eat,
and things to see, not bad.

998
00:59:24,682 --> 00:59:27,583
- Let me take it.
- I'll take it myself... thanks.

999
00:59:27,952 --> 00:59:31,353
- Sister-in-law, quick, please.
- Time to eat...

1000
00:59:32,123 --> 00:59:33,681
Cock, just ordinary dishes, don't mind.

1001
00:59:34,091 --> 00:59:38,221
No, I like simple food.

1002
00:59:39,196 --> 00:59:41,824
Bastard! What do you mean?

1003
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:43,227
I don't mean this.

1004
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:45,825
I wouldn't insult sister-in-law for sure.

1005
00:59:46,237 --> 00:59:47,636
Lazy bone...

1006
00:59:47,905 --> 00:59:48,530
Sister.

1007
00:59:48,673 --> 00:59:51,369
Is this correct
to describe such a scoundrel?

1008
00:59:51,976 --> 00:59:55,139
Enough! Stop speaking rudely.

1009
00:59:55,279 --> 00:59:56,769
I was only joking.

1010
00:59:56,914 --> 00:59:59,314
If I dislike you,
I wouldn't eat with you.

1011
00:59:59,517 --> 01:00:01,007
Narrow-minded.

1012
01:00:07,591 --> 01:00:10,025
Sister, can I enter for Miss HK?

1013
01:00:10,995 --> 01:00:14,089
No, you enter for Miss HK?

1014
01:00:14,231 --> 01:00:16,893
You might catch more fish
as you're so pretty.

1015
01:00:17,101 --> 01:00:18,090
Aren't I pretty?

1016
01:00:18,402 --> 01:00:21,803
Cock, if Chu really enters for Miss HK

1017
01:00:21,939 --> 01:00:23,839
does she get a chance?

1018
01:00:23,974 --> 01:00:24,998
Right, is there a chance?

1019
01:00:25,142 --> 01:00:28,441
Yes! If I am one of the judges

1020
01:00:28,579 --> 01:00:30,342
I'd surely give you
a Prize of Miss Tough!

1021
01:00:30,481 --> 01:00:31,243
What?

1022
01:00:31,382 --> 01:00:33,646
Stop behaving rudely, you're a girl.

1023
01:00:33,784 --> 01:00:34,910
I must attack you at night.

1024
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:37,282
Attack me? Let me kill you first.

1025
01:00:37,488 --> 01:00:40,184
Kill you... Eat on, stop speaking.

1026
01:00:41,592 --> 01:00:43,219
It's all cool.

1027
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,323
Very windy, go back.

1028
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:50,791
Can I sit with you?

1029
01:00:54,305 --> 01:00:55,533
Have peanuts.

1030
01:01:00,144 --> 01:01:01,634
You're from Taiwan.

1031
01:01:02,379 --> 01:01:05,143
Why do you stay in this small village?

1032
01:01:05,683 --> 01:01:08,413
We are from a small village of Taiwan.

1033
01:01:08,552 --> 01:01:10,349
Since sister married Wan

1034
01:01:10,488 --> 01:01:11,819
we come to HK

1035
01:01:12,356 --> 01:01:13,687
we have no family in Taiwan now.

1036
01:01:16,293 --> 01:01:17,624
Why are you on the run?

1037
01:01:20,698 --> 01:01:25,226
No, I killed the boss, so I run away.

1038
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:30,898
I tell you, I have sixth sense.

1039
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:33,772
What sixth sense?

1040
01:01:34,578 --> 01:01:36,068
I can sense danger

1041
01:01:36,213 --> 01:01:37,612
before it actually arrives.

1042
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:40,141
So mighty?

1043
01:01:46,157 --> 01:01:48,489
- Where's your boyfriend?
- What?

1044
01:01:48,759 --> 01:01:51,091
Your boyfriend.

1045
01:01:51,228 --> 01:01:54,220
I have none. And you,
where's your girlfriend?

1046
01:02:00,004 --> 01:02:03,565
I used to have one. Now no.

1047
01:02:04,508 --> 01:02:05,668
Why?

1048
01:02:07,511 --> 01:02:09,240
She left me.

1049
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:13,077
- She's gone?
- I left.

1050
01:02:15,386 --> 01:02:16,614
Why ask so much?

1051
01:02:17,922 --> 01:02:20,254
Nothing, I'm just curious.

1052
01:02:22,927 --> 01:02:24,861
OK, I'll go back.

1053
01:02:25,563 --> 01:02:27,292
No, sit for more a while.

1054
01:02:27,932 --> 01:02:30,298
I can sense danger here.

1055
01:02:31,402 --> 01:02:32,960
What danger?

1056
01:02:34,939 --> 01:02:36,463
I catch you now?

1057
01:02:38,209 --> 01:02:40,040
Come on.

1058
01:02:40,377 --> 01:02:43,073
I told you I have sixth sense,
you believed now?

1059
01:02:48,352 --> 01:02:51,913
How come we caught this shoe?

1060
01:02:57,528 --> 01:02:58,790
Still staring at me?

1061
01:03:18,849 --> 01:03:20,578
Chu, the balance.

1062
01:03:21,986 --> 01:03:23,510
These fish are a bit little.

1063
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:25,482
Talk with my sister for that.

1064
01:03:27,491 --> 01:03:30,085
- Where's your dog?
- What dog?

1065
01:03:30,394 --> 01:03:33,227
What dog? I'm human!

1066
01:03:33,364 --> 01:03:34,661
You fool me?

1067
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,661
Damn you bastard!

1068
01:03:39,403 --> 01:03:40,199
- Well...
- Yes.

1069
01:03:40,337 --> 01:03:44,797
What is the sixth sense you mention?

1070
01:03:45,009 --> 01:03:47,842
Any human is born with 5 senses.

1071
01:03:47,978 --> 01:03:53,280
Seeing, hearing,
smelling, touching, tasting

1072
01:03:53,851 --> 01:03:56,513
and the sixth sense is an additional one.

1073
01:03:57,388 --> 01:03:59,219
It's a sense that cannot be described.

1074
01:03:59,356 --> 01:04:03,452
Only some people have it. Understand?

1075
01:04:04,495 --> 01:04:06,258
I have this sense too

1076
01:04:08,732 --> 01:04:11,166
I sense that someone is following us.

1077
01:04:12,303 --> 01:04:14,328
Run! Quick!

1078
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:19,769
Damn you! You have someone to back you.

1079
01:04:19,977 --> 01:04:21,945
It's their choice not to buy your fish.

1080
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,944
Business talks about fair competition.

1081
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:26,275
I don't care, I must eat your today!

1082
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:27,981
How can I greet you?

1083
01:04:28,218 --> 01:04:29,947
Who's most famous here?

1084
01:04:31,088 --> 01:04:32,419
Adam Chow.

1085
01:04:32,589 --> 01:04:35,786
- I'm called Sister Chow.
- Damn you!

1086
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:44,295
Run!

1087
01:04:44,868 --> 01:04:45,926
Don't get near!

1088
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,304
Do you know his brother-in-law
Foul Wah is on the walk too?

1089
01:04:48,772 --> 01:04:51,036
You want to die?

1090
01:05:01,085 --> 01:05:03,246
Lightly... it hurts.

1091
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,947
The bruises won't fade if I rub lightly.

1092
01:05:09,126 --> 01:05:11,287
- Does it hurt here?
- Yes.

1093
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:13,425
Don't shout around.

1094
01:05:17,101 --> 01:05:18,500
Here, does it hurt?

1095
01:05:19,603 --> 01:05:20,797
Horny!

1096
01:05:21,305 --> 01:05:24,638
You say I don't know,
now I make it and you call me horny.

1097
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:26,104
you do it yourself.

1098
01:05:27,478 --> 01:05:30,743
OK, help me, I don't know how to.

1099
01:05:32,316 --> 01:05:33,806
Does it hurt here?

1100
01:05:45,796 --> 01:05:47,423
I rub for you, but why must you kiss me?

1101
01:05:47,564 --> 01:05:50,089
No, as you kiss me
so I must kiss you back.

1102
01:05:50,234 --> 01:05:51,565
How can I face others?

1103
01:05:55,672 --> 01:05:56,832
It's fair now

1104
01:05:57,408 --> 01:06:00,172
Don't kiss me again,
or I'll kiss you back.

1105
01:06:12,056 --> 01:06:13,148
It hurts!

1106
01:06:15,392 --> 01:06:16,359
Did I bite you?

1107
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,926
No, my leg still hurts.

1108
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:20,790
Sorry...

1109
01:06:24,368 --> 01:06:25,596
I'm hungry.

1110
01:06:27,171 --> 01:06:28,604
Please cook me some noodle.

1111
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:33,741
OK, you need food for energy.

1112
01:06:40,517 --> 01:06:43,281
And now, number 12, Miss Lok Wing Gee.

1113
01:06:43,554 --> 01:06:45,112
I'm Lok Wing Gee.

1114
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:47,519
I'm 19, a student.

1115
01:06:47,724 --> 01:06:50,284
My resolution is to become an accountant.

1116
01:06:50,494 --> 01:06:53,088
If I become Miss HK

1117
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:54,959
I'll promote HK and make HK famous.

1118
01:06:55,165 --> 01:06:57,099
Thanks.

1119
01:06:57,701 --> 01:06:59,066
Miss Lok Wing Gee

1120
01:06:59,236 --> 01:07:00,396
gives a good answer.

1121
01:07:00,537 --> 01:07:03,199
No wonder she's the hottest this year.

1122
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:05,240
I'm hungry, is it ready?

1123
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:07,099
What's wrong?

1124
01:07:09,513 --> 01:07:12,949
What to court Miss HK? NO way for you!

1125
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:15,305
I finally know what a dog is.

1126
01:08:16,647 --> 01:08:19,616
What a dog? It's a monstrous dog.

1127
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:22,218
- Horny.
- Not as horny as you.

1128
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,478
My sixth sense tells me

1129
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:27,351
that I'll meet a man who pampers me much.

1130
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:28,888
Very much...

1131
01:08:31,595 --> 01:08:34,689
- What is it?
- Go sell the fish.

1132
01:08:51,915 --> 01:08:53,109
Where's your dog?

1133
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:55,843
I'll have it bite you
if you laugh at me again.

1134
01:08:56,119 --> 01:08:58,553
Great, you have a dog bite you.

1135
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:01,453
Prepuce, Cock speaking.

1136
01:09:01,592 --> 01:09:04,322
I don't care whatever you do

1137
01:09:04,461 --> 01:09:06,088
you must get me Gee's phone number.

1138
01:09:06,296 --> 01:09:07,354
OK, where are you?

1139
01:09:07,497 --> 01:09:08,987
Don't care for that.

1140
01:09:09,766 --> 01:09:11,961
Lok Wing Gee... someone says
you were once a clubgirl.

1141
01:09:12,135 --> 01:09:13,727
No comment.

1142
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:15,932
I make this chicken best.

1143
01:09:16,073 --> 01:09:18,541
I'll make some food, wait.

1144
01:09:20,611 --> 01:09:23,045
We have our duty,
please say something, Miss Lok.

1145
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:01,747
Who are you looking?

1146
01:10:04,187 --> 01:10:06,655
It's me, Chick.

1147
01:10:09,493 --> 01:10:12,428
Where are you? In HK?

1148
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:18,692
I've always been in HK.

1149
01:10:19,169 --> 01:10:21,694
They say you killed someone,
and you're on the run.

1150
01:10:23,073 --> 01:10:27,476
I'm not on the run,
I'm only hiding for a moment.

1151
01:10:27,778 --> 01:10:30,611
I don't want you to get involved,
so I didn't call you up.

1152
01:10:31,048 --> 01:10:32,481
You call me up now?

1153
01:10:34,017 --> 01:10:37,453
I read papers that some one bullies you

1154
01:10:38,789 --> 01:10:40,188
so I want to know the situation.

1155
01:10:44,127 --> 01:10:46,061
Chick...

1156
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:52,228
I miss you much.

1157
01:10:58,709 --> 01:11:00,199
Me too.

1158
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:02,077
I want to see you too.

1159
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,783
I want see you.
But there's no traffic here.

1160
01:11:09,252 --> 01:11:10,981
What do you mean be this?

1161
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:16,152
The first ferry begins at 6 tomorrow.

1162
01:11:16,293 --> 01:11:17,783
Where are you now?

1163
01:11:21,231 --> 01:11:23,358
I'm in Lamma Island.

1164
01:12:21,858 --> 01:12:26,522
Cock, I heard all

1165
01:12:26,797 --> 01:12:28,025
your telephone conversation.

1166
01:12:28,932 --> 01:12:31,958
I was lying on the bed

1167
01:12:32,335 --> 01:12:35,429
but I wasn't sleeping. Go back now.

1168
01:12:36,473 --> 01:12:39,772
She is more important to you.

1169
01:12:40,744 --> 01:12:42,041
I only want to tell you.

1170
01:12:42,412 --> 01:12:43,640
These 2 months were

1171
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,544
the happiest time in my life.

1172
01:12:47,517 --> 01:12:52,454
And... my sixth sense is never accurate.

1173
01:13:22,185 --> 01:13:23,243
Cock!

1174
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,189
I want you to buy me high-heeled shoes.

1175
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:35,488
I want to wear them all my life.

1176
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:47,108
You've promised?

1177
01:14:00,624 --> 01:14:02,114
I'm getting married!

1178
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:08,657
Want to get married?
Have you thought over?

1179
01:14:11,001 --> 01:14:12,195
I've thought over

1180
01:14:13,537 --> 01:14:15,095
I must get married one time.

1181
01:14:15,906 --> 01:14:18,238
But if my life is like Gee.

1182
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:25,106
I believe in this whole world...
all men will envy me.

1183
01:14:26,016 --> 01:14:28,450
I don't think so,
your girl is nice and pretty.

1184
01:14:28,652 --> 01:14:31,212
She'll be ruined if she marries you.

1185
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:32,649
Boss, is it true?

1186
01:14:32,856 --> 01:14:35,791
You should back me up,
but why this remark to me?

1187
01:14:36,593 --> 01:14:38,618
I thought you never want love.

1188
01:14:40,697 --> 01:14:42,062
You're against it?

1189
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,662
I've talked with the Fukienese.

1190
01:14:46,803 --> 01:14:49,704
Go get married,
they say they'd spare you.

1191
01:14:51,541 --> 01:14:54,977
- Thanks, Boss.
- Thanks for what?

1192
01:14:55,111 --> 01:14:56,942
If you hadn't killed their boss

1193
01:14:57,147 --> 01:14:59,479
the new boss is still a nobody.

1194
01:14:59,616 --> 01:15:01,345
He should thank you instead.

1195
01:15:03,887 --> 01:15:08,221
Boss. Be my parent for wedding.

1196
01:15:09,159 --> 01:15:11,684
You want to get married
at this young age.

1197
01:15:11,962 --> 01:15:14,226
I'll say you'll get divorce soon.

1198
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:15,758
Boss.

1199
01:15:30,714 --> 01:15:32,238
You've put tonic on?

1200
01:15:32,382 --> 01:15:33,474
Why drag the face?

1201
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:34,617
Shit

1202
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:36,616
they haven't told us a price yet

1203
01:15:36,786 --> 01:15:38,048
- But we must pay whatever they ask for.
- Right...

1204
01:15:38,188 --> 01:15:40,952
$39,900 to get my wife, it's a bargain.

1205
01:15:41,157 --> 01:15:44,058
I say, my wife is priceless.

1206
01:15:44,194 --> 01:15:46,128
- Priceless.
- I have no idea.

1207
01:15:46,296 --> 01:15:48,161
- She's worthy.
- Damn!

1208
01:15:48,365 --> 01:15:50,595
Will Boss Bee come?

1209
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:54,462
I don't know.

1210
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:57,004
Don't worry, I asked him this morning

1211
01:15:57,807 --> 01:15:58,967
and he said he'd come.

1212
01:15:59,909 --> 01:16:00,671
It's alright now.

1213
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,334
He still pampers me.

1214
01:16:03,413 --> 01:16:05,244
Why does it take them so long
to fetch the bride?

1215
01:16:05,415 --> 01:16:06,939
- Right.
- Brother Bee...

1216
01:16:07,117 --> 01:16:08,982
Pin, Chee, how's your boss Bear?

1217
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,783
Boss Bee, I want to work with you.

1218
01:16:12,889 --> 01:16:14,220
Why do you want to work with me?

1219
01:16:14,357 --> 01:16:15,654
Boss Bee, look.

1220
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:18,624
What's happened to you?

1221
01:16:18,762 --> 01:16:21,162
That boss is SM maniac.

1222
01:16:21,297 --> 01:16:24,391
He not only beats us,
and want to sodomite us.

1223
01:16:25,702 --> 01:16:28,466
Is Bear such a person?

1224
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:30,833
Don't go!

1225
01:16:31,041 --> 01:16:33,271
Don't let him run! Kill him!

1226
01:16:33,576 --> 01:16:35,009
Brother Cock...

1227
01:16:35,979 --> 01:16:36,843
How is your sister?

1228
01:16:37,213 --> 01:16:38,407
Sister is arriving soon.

1229
01:16:38,615 --> 01:16:41,083
Not Brother Cock,
call him brother-in-law now.

1230
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:45,287
Brother-in-law... sister is coming.

1231
01:16:52,962 --> 01:16:53,860
You're pretty.

1232
01:16:54,064 --> 01:16:56,794
Time has come,
go to worship ancestors now.

1233
01:17:05,241 --> 01:17:07,573
Can you repeat, hubby?

1234
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,611
you speak it very lovely, come on...

1235
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,206
Hubby

1236
01:17:12,215 --> 01:17:13,239
Again...

1237
01:17:13,817 --> 01:17:15,045
Hubby

1238
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:20,413
- Wrinkles, Boss Bee...
- What?

1239
01:17:21,591 --> 01:17:23,957
Quick! Burn that ass-hole!

1240
01:17:24,828 --> 01:17:27,023
You bastards! Free me at once!

1241
01:17:30,533 --> 01:17:32,330
- What is it?
- Something happens to Boss Bee.

1242
01:17:33,737 --> 01:17:36,604
- I'll get drunk tonight.
- Don't get drunk.

1243
01:17:36,906 --> 01:17:37,964
Cock.

1244
01:17:38,575 --> 01:17:40,566
Drive now, what are you doing?

1245
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,277
Speak something now.

1246
01:17:42,979 --> 01:17:44,071
Stay with these women.

1247
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,611
We three go to see the situation.

1248
01:17:46,249 --> 01:17:47,443
You must come back on time.

1249
01:17:48,118 --> 01:17:50,245
It's 11 only, well soon be back.

1250
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:52,788
No way, we're the righteous guys.

1251
01:17:54,057 --> 01:17:55,422
I must tell my wife now.

1252
01:18:02,966 --> 01:18:06,367
- Hurry, it won't take more than an hour.
- No way!

1253
01:18:07,403 --> 01:18:08,301
Don't go!

1254
01:18:08,438 --> 01:18:09,996
Don't be like this,
go and stay with your mom, OK?

1255
01:18:10,206 --> 01:18:12,470
Who is more important, your boss or me?

1256
01:18:12,675 --> 01:18:13,835
You're most important.

1257
01:18:13,977 --> 01:18:16,912
You're most important in this world, OK?

1258
01:18:23,419 --> 01:18:26,877
Boss, hold on! Here we come!

1259
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:29,519
Boss!

1260
01:18:32,529 --> 01:18:33,826
How are you? Boss, are you alright?

1261
01:18:35,765 --> 01:18:37,756
Don't be angry, Cheese.

1262
01:18:37,934 --> 01:18:39,526
Don't worry, it'll be alright.

1263
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:48,174
It's more important than the wedding,
you say.

1264
01:18:54,584 --> 01:18:56,017
- Boss, you alright?
- Boss, it's alright now.

1265
01:18:56,286 --> 01:18:58,220
Chee and Pin are beasts!

1266
01:18:58,354 --> 01:18:59,321
Help boss get in the car.

1267
01:18:59,522 --> 01:19:01,649
I'm wearing a suit for your banquet.

1268
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:03,725
- I believe you...
- Help the boss in the car!

1269
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:05,624
OK, Brother Cock.

1270
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:13,093
Kid! Don't die!

1271
01:19:24,013 --> 01:19:25,310
Cock!

1272
01:19:27,283 --> 01:19:30,810
Police! Freeze!

1273
01:19:30,954 --> 01:19:32,285
Don't fire!

1274
01:19:32,889 --> 01:19:34,413
Sit down!

1275
01:19:37,427 --> 01:19:39,418
You won't start a fight on today.

1276
01:19:39,796 --> 01:19:41,923
Don't worry, Gee,
it's going to be alright.

1277
01:19:42,131 --> 01:19:46,124
I assure you can get sleep
with Cock tonight.

1278
01:19:46,603 --> 01:19:49,504
Go!

1279
01:19:49,706 --> 01:19:50,934
Shut up!

1280
01:19:51,274 --> 01:19:53,765
Since I became a policeman...

1281
01:19:53,943 --> 01:19:55,638
I've never see triad
dressed so nicely for a fight.

1282
01:20:01,117 --> 01:20:02,345
Cock!

1283
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:05,718
Miss...

1284
01:20:06,689 --> 01:20:09,351
- Can I talk to her?
- Hurry up!

1285
01:20:11,961 --> 01:20:14,122
What shall I do, Cock?

1286
01:20:28,945 --> 01:20:30,344
Sorry

1287
01:20:43,526 --> 01:20:45,221
Cock!

1288
01:21:03,079 --> 01:21:05,104
I still remember

1289
01:21:05,281 --> 01:21:06,771
all friends and relatives
waited all evening

1290
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:11,380
and the groom never came
and neither did the bride.

1291
01:21:11,688 --> 01:21:13,280
The judge sentenced me manslaughter

1292
01:21:14,157 --> 01:21:15,647
and I was given
four and half year imprisonment.

1293
01:21:18,227 --> 01:21:21,685
The first thing I did
when I was released is to find you two.

1294
01:21:23,232 --> 01:21:25,723
But I failed to.

1295
01:21:26,569 --> 01:21:27,866
We went back to Macau.

1296
01:21:28,938 --> 01:21:30,496
Later my sister went to England.

1297
01:21:31,541 --> 01:21:33,805
She said this city
reminds her the unhappy past

1298
01:21:34,344 --> 01:21:36,642
so she wanted a new life.

1299
01:21:38,715 --> 01:21:39,943
How is she now?

1300
01:21:41,084 --> 01:21:43,245
She gave my a call last year

1301
01:21:43,686 --> 01:21:45,847
but she said
she'd be getting married soon.

1302
01:21:48,091 --> 01:21:49,922
Drink more... help yourselves.

1303
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,387
Cock, when did you come?

1304
01:21:54,564 --> 01:21:55,588
Congratulations!

1305
01:21:55,732 --> 01:21:57,597
- You're back?
- I'm back for almost a year.

1306
01:21:57,734 --> 01:21:59,258
What are you up to now?

1307
01:21:59,469 --> 01:22:02,563
You hold wedding banquet in a restaurant?

1308
01:22:02,705 --> 01:22:05,731
Have you watched the sign? Albertini.

1309
01:22:06,242 --> 01:22:07,140
Don't understand.

1310
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:08,709
I'm not called Ben Hon anymore.

1311
01:22:08,845 --> 01:22:09,709
I have an Italian name

1312
01:22:09,846 --> 01:22:12,178
Albertini Hon.

1313
01:22:12,582 --> 01:22:13,606
Very cool!

1314
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:16,446
Have you watched "God Father" at HBO

1315
01:22:16,652 --> 01:22:18,279
It's classic.

1316
01:22:18,421 --> 01:22:20,855
Now that we're on the walk.
We must run an Italian restaurant

1317
01:22:21,024 --> 01:22:23,015
and get an Italian name. How to run?

1318
01:22:23,259 --> 01:22:25,420
- Sister!
- Cock!

1319
01:22:26,396 --> 01:22:29,661
Thanks... Long time no see.

1320
01:22:29,799 --> 01:22:32,359
Yes, your husband is called... Tini?

1321
01:22:32,568 --> 01:22:33,762
Albertini

1322
01:22:33,903 --> 01:22:35,928
Have you got a weird name then?

1323
01:22:36,072 --> 01:22:39,838
I'm Ginanori Paolighetan.

1324
01:22:40,309 --> 01:22:41,776
And shorted to Thirteen Ghetan.

1325
01:22:41,911 --> 01:22:43,674
- Right, correct.
- How so?

1326
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,509
- Here comes Big Fei, let's drink.
- Good, come on...

1327
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:50,084
Is the VCD you produced of high quality?

1328
01:22:50,219 --> 01:22:51,447
Can't you put more
artistic elements in them.

1329
01:22:51,654 --> 01:22:52,985
Don't make it like pirated VCDs.

1330
01:22:53,122 --> 01:22:58,583
And you must not put mosaic at them.

1331
01:22:59,062 --> 01:22:59,926
Big Fei!

1332
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:01,428
No mosaic please!

1333
01:23:01,564 --> 01:23:03,259
Open up like this! Right!

1334
01:23:03,633 --> 01:23:05,863
- Why lose temper?
- I'm teaching the son!

1335
01:23:06,002 --> 01:23:09,062
Your son? Are you mistaken?
How can you say that?

1336
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:12,036
His son is editor
in a publishing company.

1337
01:23:12,608 --> 01:23:13,438
How old?

1338
01:23:13,609 --> 01:23:15,702
My son in only 16,
finishes primary school.

1339
01:23:15,845 --> 01:23:19,440
So I help him a bit in literature field.

1340
01:23:19,582 --> 01:23:21,311
A porn magazines is literature?

1341
01:23:21,617 --> 01:23:24,381
Then Ben Hon runs this Albertini.

1342
01:23:24,587 --> 01:23:27,852
Makes him the tycoon
of nightclubs and restaurant?

1343
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:29,287
Right.

1344
01:23:29,492 --> 01:23:32,154
- Your jacket is cool.
- I bought it in France.

1345
01:23:33,129 --> 01:23:34,790
Brother Kei, come in.

1346
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:38,458
I put this on, thinking the banquet
being held in Chinese restaurant.

1347
01:23:38,634 --> 01:23:41,262
So I went home to change clothes.

1348
01:23:41,437 --> 01:23:43,530
No, the Chinese costume makes you
stand out, come on...

1349
01:23:43,673 --> 01:23:45,573
- Will this do?
- Cool, sign here!

1350
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:48,142
I become an elephant now.

1351
01:23:48,411 --> 01:23:53,371
Look at Sis, she seems
to enjoy more than you.

1352
01:23:53,616 --> 01:23:55,015
Congratulations! Sister-in-law.

1353
01:23:55,184 --> 01:23:58,210
Don't say such thing,
take Brother Kei to VIP room.

1354
01:23:59,722 --> 01:24:02,282
No matter what enjoyment, let's cheers.

1355
01:24:02,425 --> 01:24:04,791
It's even better with red wine.

1356
01:24:07,497 --> 01:24:08,657
This place is not bad.

1357
01:24:08,898 --> 01:24:10,889
Everyone is here today?

1358
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:13,495
Right, my friend hasn't arrived yet.

1359
01:24:13,703 --> 01:24:14,727
He's just come back from England

1360
01:24:14,871 --> 01:24:16,202
he runs gambling stall in China Town.

1361
01:24:16,339 --> 01:24:17,237
Does he?

1362
01:24:17,373 --> 01:24:18,772
He's called Chris Chong.

1363
01:24:18,975 --> 01:24:21,910
He has business in S.E. Asia
and in Philippines.

1364
01:24:22,445 --> 01:24:23,503
Which field?

1365
01:24:24,247 --> 01:24:26,772
He's my idol anyway,
he's like Harrison Ford.

1366
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:28,474
Like Harrison Ford?

1367
01:24:28,618 --> 01:24:30,518
- He's coming soon.
- What is it?

1368
01:24:30,653 --> 01:24:31,915
Ho Nam has come.

1369
01:24:32,088 --> 01:24:33,419
Here he comes!

1370
01:24:37,793 --> 01:24:38,919
Ho Nam.

1371
01:24:39,061 --> 01:24:42,155
- Congratulations...
- Thanks...

1372
01:24:42,465 --> 01:24:44,023
You finally get married.

1373
01:24:45,201 --> 01:24:46,498
You come back now?

1374
01:24:46,802 --> 01:24:48,201
I've been to Taiwan for one year.

1375
01:24:48,638 --> 01:24:49,627
Where's Liar?

1376
01:24:50,339 --> 01:24:53,206
Say no more, we parted and
she went back to Kuala Lumpor.

1377
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:56,010
- She sends you this.
- Thanks.

1378
01:24:56,145 --> 01:24:57,942
- What about me?
- Double.

1379
01:24:58,314 --> 01:25:00,305
OK, ready, 1, 2, 3!

1380
01:25:10,092 --> 01:25:10,922
Hello

1381
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:13,551
- Hey, Ben! Congratulations!
- Thanks.

1382
01:25:13,763 --> 01:25:17,096
I have an Italian name, Albertini.

1383
01:25:18,067 --> 01:25:20,001
Let me introduce, my wife, Virginia.

1384
01:25:20,136 --> 01:25:21,103
- Hello
- Hello

1385
01:25:21,237 --> 01:25:22,295
Thanks for coming.

1386
01:25:22,438 --> 01:25:24,065
Come... let me introduce you some friends.

1387
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:26,933
Big Fei

1388
01:25:27,410 --> 01:25:28,138
Brother Kei

1389
01:25:28,277 --> 01:25:29,107
- Brother Kei
- Hello

1390
01:25:29,245 --> 01:25:30,473
- My wife
- Hello

1391
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,874
This is Prepuce.

1392
01:25:32,114 --> 01:25:33,172
Cock.

1393
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:37,012
He and Chan Ho Nam are
the two best guys in Hung Hing.

1394
01:25:37,386 --> 01:25:39,877
Ho Nam has just left.

1395
01:25:40,223 --> 01:25:42,714
Chris Chong comes from England
just for my wedding.

1396
01:25:42,858 --> 01:25:43,882
He's my idol.

1397
01:25:44,527 --> 01:25:45,585
Nice to meet you!

1398
01:25:46,229 --> 01:25:48,220
Let me introduce, my wife, Virginia.

1399
01:25:49,098 --> 01:25:50,087
Hello!

1400
01:25:54,904 --> 01:25:57,202
Chris, you're big boss
in London China Town

1401
01:25:57,406 --> 01:26:00,170
no wonder your wife
is as pretty as Miss London.

1402
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:02,971
You're bride today,
you're prettiest today.

1403
01:26:03,446 --> 01:26:04,413
Thank you!

1404
01:26:04,547 --> 01:26:06,481
Help yourselves, drink more.

1405
01:26:06,616 --> 01:26:07,913
Drink red wine.

1406
01:26:08,551 --> 01:26:11,076
I wish the newly wedded couple...

1407
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:12,915
Love each other forever.

1408
01:26:13,055 --> 01:26:14,488
- Thanks
- Thanks

1409
01:26:19,829 --> 01:26:22,593
Virginia,
drink with the pretties bride now.

1410
01:26:23,833 --> 01:26:25,767
- Cheers!

1411
01:26:25,901 --> 01:26:27,198
Cheers...

1412
01:26:27,336 --> 01:26:29,065
Thanks

1413
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:31,968
Don't you want to meet sister?

1414
01:26:33,709 --> 01:26:34,869
Don't you know she's back?

1415
01:26:35,311 --> 01:26:37,404
I wouldn't be
as shocked as you if I knew.

1416
01:26:39,315 --> 01:26:41,715
Mr. Chong, I want to ask you.

1417
01:26:41,917 --> 01:26:46,479
Is cultural business
in London China Town prosperous?

1418
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:48,348
Quite good.

1419
01:26:50,926 --> 01:26:53,588
I mean Chinese porno books.

1420
01:26:55,998 --> 01:26:57,260
You're interested in that too?

1421
01:27:09,512 --> 01:27:10,672
How are you?

1422
01:27:12,815 --> 01:27:14,112
Long time no see.

1423
01:27:14,684 --> 01:27:18,211
I'm doing research work
in this field recently

1424
01:27:19,188 --> 01:27:22,851
and I'm going to
publish an artistic book.

1425
01:27:26,062 --> 01:27:27,552
Give me a call if you have time.

1426
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,730
You know each other?

1427
01:27:34,904 --> 01:27:36,030
No.

1428
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:38,163
I only asked her
about the weather in England.

1429
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:45,547
She has husband, don't woo her.

1430
01:27:46,415 --> 01:27:49,179
Thirteen! Someone wants to see you.

1431
01:27:49,518 --> 01:27:51,918
- Who?
- Go and take a look.

1432
01:27:53,756 --> 01:27:54,780
Who?

1433
01:27:59,462 --> 01:28:01,896
- I'm happy. You show up now?
- You're pretty!

1434
01:28:02,098 --> 01:28:03,565
Why are you still so rude?

1435
01:28:03,699 --> 01:28:05,064
This is my candid side.

1436
01:28:05,234 --> 01:28:06,758
I come all the way back
from Taiwan to congratulate you.

1437
01:28:06,936 --> 01:28:08,335
Thanks!

1438
01:28:10,172 --> 01:28:11,605
I didn't expect you love a man.

1439
01:28:11,774 --> 01:28:14,868
Right, we must try everything.

1440
01:28:15,277 --> 01:28:16,904
- Hubby, come here...
- What is it?

1441
01:28:17,146 --> 01:28:20,582
- My buddies, May Cheung, is she pretty?
- Just so so.

1442
01:28:21,784 --> 01:28:24,116
- Say no more, take a photo.
- Good...

1443
01:28:24,487 --> 01:28:26,853
1, 2, 3, cheese!

1444
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:32,691
Got it, we'll share the market

1445
01:28:32,828 --> 01:28:34,591
I'll surely count you in.

1446
01:28:35,564 --> 01:28:37,691
OK. Bye.

1447
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:44,403
Buy another for it.

1448
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:47,033
Is brand name in HK
better priced than in Europe?

1449
01:28:50,212 --> 01:28:51,804
I really don't want
to go to Kuala Lumpor.

1450
01:28:53,349 --> 01:28:54,782
Give me a reason.

1451
01:28:55,484 --> 01:28:56,917
I want to see my brother.

1452
01:28:58,788 --> 01:29:00,016
This bear is for you.

1453
01:29:02,191 --> 01:29:04,091
Still take me as a little girl?

1454
01:29:04,493 --> 01:29:07,257
I've always taken you as a little girl.

1455
01:29:08,397 --> 01:29:12,060
If you give me this,
it'll only be cut open by Customs.

1456
01:29:12,201 --> 01:29:13,668
You know they check severely in Malaysia.

1457
01:29:13,803 --> 01:29:15,293
No one will check your things.

1458
01:29:15,438 --> 01:29:17,497
There's nothing in there, why fear?

1459
01:29:21,277 --> 01:29:23,211
I really don't want
to go to Kuala Lumpor.

1460
01:29:24,613 --> 01:29:28,777
I stay here and wait for you here.

1461
01:29:30,853 --> 01:29:33,720
You have a date?

1462
01:29:34,623 --> 01:29:38,024
Nuts! I only want to see my brother.

1463
01:29:40,262 --> 01:29:42,355
I hate others insult my talent.

1464
01:29:43,332 --> 01:29:46,597
I haven't been back for ages,
how come I have date?

1465
01:29:54,443 --> 01:29:55,535
You still deny?

1466
01:29:55,744 --> 01:29:59,510
- What does this number represent?
- Old lover.

1467
01:30:00,249 --> 01:30:01,716
Nuts!

1468
01:30:02,952 --> 01:30:03,680
I'll call up my brother now

1469
01:30:03,886 --> 01:30:04,944
just to prove it to you.

1470
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,554
I'm not stupid! I'm not thick!

1471
01:30:10,659 --> 01:30:12,718
It's me.

1472
01:30:13,028 --> 01:30:14,461
How come you know which room I stay?

1473
01:30:15,064 --> 01:30:16,554
Can we chat a while?

1474
01:30:18,734 --> 01:30:19,860
Go ahead.

1475
01:30:20,002 --> 01:30:23,699
I miss you,
I didn't expect to see you again.

1476
01:30:23,906 --> 01:30:25,305
It's true.

1477
01:30:25,574 --> 01:30:27,235
I want to have tea with you tomorrow.

1478
01:30:28,143 --> 01:30:29,610
I don't care if you're married

1479
01:30:30,012 --> 01:30:31,502
I want to court you again.

1480
01:30:33,549 --> 01:30:35,483
Don't tell me that is your brother.

1481
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:38,948
Give it back to me!

1482
01:30:42,057 --> 01:30:46,585
Who is it? No more topics?

1483
01:30:46,962 --> 01:30:49,453
Hello, Chris.

1484
01:30:51,066 --> 01:30:55,435
Brother Cock, everyone knows
you're expert at courting girls.

1485
01:30:55,738 --> 01:30:58,298
Do you know Virginia is my wife?

1486
01:30:58,874 --> 01:31:00,068
I know.

1487
01:31:00,209 --> 01:31:03,235
But she's my old friend.

1488
01:31:03,412 --> 01:31:05,073
Ex-Lover or old friend?

1489
01:31:07,616 --> 01:31:09,243
I'll call you again tomorrow, bye.

1490
01:31:10,052 --> 01:31:11,451
Bitch!

1491
01:31:15,324 --> 01:31:16,586
Stand there!

1492
01:31:18,227 --> 01:31:19,626
You must obey since you're my wife!

1493
01:31:19,828 --> 01:31:21,420
Do I treat you good after we got married?

1494
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:25,726
What are you doing?...

1495
01:31:25,935 --> 01:31:28,233
Listen, I don't want
another man look at you!

1496
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:31,771
No way... I won't let them look at you!

1497
01:31:33,342 --> 01:31:34,468
I won't let another touch you!

1498
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:38,137
You belong to me, got that?...

1499
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:41,008
You bitch...

1500
01:31:41,216 --> 01:31:43,650
No! Not now, never can they!

1501
01:31:43,886 --> 01:31:49,085
Bitch...

1502
01:32:00,836 --> 01:32:02,098
She's going out.

1503
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:08,342
- Sister
- Where's Cock?

1504
01:32:08,644 --> 01:32:10,305
He's been waiting for you
long time outside.

1505
01:32:20,122 --> 01:32:21,146
How is your husband now?

1506
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:24,650
I sneaked out when he didn't notice.

1507
01:32:26,362 --> 01:32:27,795
He must be very angry now.

1508
01:32:30,566 --> 01:32:32,033
He beat you up?

1509
01:32:36,405 --> 01:32:38,464
I never know he's so jealous.

1510
01:32:42,144 --> 01:32:44,772
I don't want to be
related to him anymore.

1511
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:51,579
Do you know he's the
biggest drug dealer in Europe?

1512
01:32:55,157 --> 01:32:57,751
He runs business, he runs restaurants.

1513
01:32:57,893 --> 01:33:00,225
I think he shouldn't be drug dealer.

1514
01:33:03,465 --> 01:33:06,059
He and me are the same type.

1515
01:33:06,268 --> 01:33:07,929
You needn't be so frank.

1516
01:33:12,641 --> 01:33:14,575
We'd better leave this place first.

1517
01:33:25,654 --> 01:33:28,987
He keeps taking me
everywhere these years

1518
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:31,422
so he's making use of me.

1519
01:33:32,094 --> 01:33:33,994
No wonder he insists on packing for me.

1520
01:33:41,437 --> 01:33:42,665
I don't understand

1521
01:33:43,772 --> 01:33:45,603
why did you marry him?

1522
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:50,535
I'll just marry
whichever man I run up to.

1523
01:33:55,818 --> 01:33:57,046
Why?

1524
01:33:59,755 --> 01:34:01,086
I can't wait.

1525
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:05,021
If you hadn't dumped me
and gone for a fight.

1526
01:34:06,361 --> 01:34:08,420
We'd be together now.

1527
01:34:22,578 --> 01:34:25,069
I'll never forget
what happened that day.

1528
01:34:36,058 --> 01:34:37,548
Let's start again.

1529
01:34:43,432 --> 01:34:44,421
I don't know what he will do

1530
01:34:44,633 --> 01:34:46,191
he keeps all my stuff.

1531
01:34:49,705 --> 01:34:51,002
Let's talk with him.

1532
01:34:56,411 --> 01:34:58,242
I dare not face him anymore.

1533
01:35:02,618 --> 01:35:04,017
Brother Cock

1534
01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:09,589
You're come at the right time,
don't waste the airtime.

1535
01:35:13,695 --> 01:35:17,153
You're playing movie The Fugitive?

1536
01:35:17,633 --> 01:35:20,500
Chris, you've been acting
all these years.

1537
01:35:23,071 --> 01:35:25,471
I've never snatched a woman
with others on the street.

1538
01:35:27,209 --> 01:35:32,203
But for your sake... I can get more crazy.

1539
01:35:33,582 --> 01:35:36,779
Virginia

1540
01:35:37,219 --> 01:35:38,311
I apologize about last night

1541
01:35:40,889 --> 01:35:43,983
I don't want to be with you,
I want a divorce.

1542
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,689
But that takes procedures.

1543
01:35:47,329 --> 01:35:49,923
Take back your document,
if you want to leave HK.

1544
01:35:50,966 --> 01:35:51,796
Chris

1545
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,764
It's useless to keep someone next to me.

1546
01:36:00,475 --> 01:36:02,705
When Chris Chong took the document out.

1547
01:36:02,845 --> 01:36:05,177
- Do take care.
- I thought he pulled out a gun.

1548
01:36:06,315 --> 01:36:07,577
But he told sister.

1549
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:11,781
He was a gentleman when he met sister.

1550
01:36:12,354 --> 01:36:15,619
So he must be gentleman when they part.

1551
01:36:20,495 --> 01:36:23,931
But Chris Chong
is a well-known drug dealer.

1552
01:36:24,666 --> 01:36:27,157
Interpol have been
checking for him for ages.

1553
01:36:28,737 --> 01:36:30,398
He has done all the deeds.

1554
01:36:30,806 --> 01:36:32,831
And when he wanted to leave HK.

1555
01:36:33,609 --> 01:36:35,372
He was arrested.

1556
01:36:42,384 --> 01:36:45,785
Brother Cock wants to
court sister a second time.

1557
01:36:46,521 --> 01:36:48,614
Sister finally agrees to marry him.

1558
01:36:49,124 --> 01:36:50,785
It's a happy ending.

1559
01:36:51,159 --> 01:36:53,525
But the story hasn't ended yet.

1560
01:36:53,795 --> 01:36:55,558
I've checked almanac

1561
01:36:55,831 --> 01:36:57,992
15 of August is the best day.

1562
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:00,564
Many people will get married that day.

1563
01:37:00,702 --> 01:37:02,863
So we put forward by 3 months,
it's today.

1564
01:37:03,005 --> 01:37:04,131
We go all the way for registration.

1565
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:05,997
When did you become superstitious?

1566
01:37:06,742 --> 01:37:09,142
Men on the walk are a bit superstitious.

1567
01:37:09,344 --> 01:37:12,370
Do you know why we didn't
get married last time?

1568
01:37:13,782 --> 01:37:15,249
I've checked at last.

1569
01:37:15,384 --> 01:37:17,579
As that day was unlucky day.

1570
01:37:17,753 --> 01:37:20,620
You always have a saying. It'd be OK
if you didn't go for the fight.

1571
01:37:22,758 --> 01:37:24,123
Don't worry.

1572
01:37:25,928 --> 01:37:29,193
I won't go fighting anymore.
It's all done.

1573
01:37:29,831 --> 01:37:32,766
This time at the wedding.

1574
01:37:33,068 --> 01:37:34,695
I must hold lots of banquets.

1575
01:37:34,836 --> 01:37:38,363
You have so many friends?

1576
01:37:38,907 --> 01:37:40,306
I don't care.

1577
01:37:40,442 --> 01:37:43,104
I'll offer banquets to people passing by.

1578
01:37:43,245 --> 01:37:44,303
And our banquet will be hectic.

1579
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,272
I must make our wedding big.

1580
01:37:48,483 --> 01:37:50,917
I want the world to envy me

1581
01:37:51,053 --> 01:37:54,045
I want to tell them I have a pretty wife.

1582
01:37:54,189 --> 01:37:57,625
- A prefect pretty wife.
- You're bad.

1583
01:37:57,759 --> 01:37:59,556
Sure I am.

1584
01:38:09,938 --> 01:38:11,098
I've planned already.

1585
01:38:11,506 --> 01:38:14,236
Let's go honey moon in Macau.

1586
01:38:14,443 --> 01:38:15,774
Macau?

1587
01:38:15,911 --> 01:38:19,005
I was joking, I want somewhere better.

1588
01:38:19,915 --> 01:38:22,475
Olympic Games will be held in Australia.

1589
01:38:26,254 --> 01:38:28,188
I won't care about business.

1590
01:38:28,557 --> 01:38:30,525
I've made some money these years.

1591
01:38:31,026 --> 01:38:33,586
So I want us to live peacefully.

1592
01:38:34,129 --> 01:38:38,156
I'll spend all my time with you.

1593
01:38:41,069 --> 01:38:44,232
There's plenty of time, you needn't rush.

1594
01:38:45,707 --> 01:38:47,197
Why are you in such a hurry?

1595
01:38:48,276 --> 01:38:51,006
I'm going to get married, but not you.

1596
01:38:52,447 --> 01:38:54,574
Why you're in a hurry?

1597
01:38:56,585 --> 01:38:59,145
Wife, I must ask you to help me.

1598
01:39:00,489 --> 01:39:02,218
I want many children.

1599
01:39:02,357 --> 01:39:03,688
May be 10!

1600
01:39:08,897 --> 01:39:11,229
We must retire soon.

1601
01:39:12,134 --> 01:39:13,658
Then we can travel round the world.

1602
01:39:13,969 --> 01:39:15,903
The children can take care of themselves.

1603
01:39:16,505 --> 01:39:17,995
And then we'll be happy.

1604
01:39:18,473 --> 01:39:20,873
Wife, I've prepared for their names too.

1605
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:23,205
The eldest son will be called Sai Tsang.

1606
01:39:23,578 --> 01:39:25,307
He'll be a love machine like his dad.

1607
01:39:25,514 --> 01:39:27,106
Then is Sai Kong, Sai Pang.

1608
01:39:27,315 --> 01:39:29,249
But never Saigon, it's bad.

1609
01:39:29,384 --> 01:39:31,614
Anyone with the name Chiu is great man!

1610
01:39:32,087 --> 01:39:33,645
Brother Cock finally checks out

1611
01:39:33,955 --> 01:39:37,914
the motor killer was sent by Chris Chong.

1612
01:39:38,393 --> 01:39:40,554
From then on, if anyone sees Cock

1613
01:39:40,762 --> 01:39:43,026
and still thinks he's not a good lover

1614
01:39:43,331 --> 01:39:46,823
that he is a horny triad member.

1615
01:39:47,469 --> 01:39:51,405
I can tell you, you misunderstand him.
