1
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,376
Be careful!

2
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,643
Hey, mister.

3
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,176
Mister...

4
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,621
Mister, move over a bit.

5
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,588
Cut it out.

6
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,458
This seat isn't just for you.
Move over a little.

7
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,688
Cut it out.

8
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,632
- Have a seat, please
- It's okay.

9
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,401
Excuse me!

10
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:46,661
Sit down.

11
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,166
Excuse me.

12
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,481
Damn, I said stop it!

13
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,987
I'm waiting for red bean cakes...

14
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,815
If you follow this alley to the end,

15
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,851
there's a place that
sells hamburgers.

16
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,715
The food here doesn't agree
with you?

17
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:42,956
Here it is.

18
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,157
Sung-ho, today I...

19
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,923
Don't worry.
It's not a difficult club.

20
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:53,795
- I don't know history well.
- So you should learn.

21
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,863
Hello, sir.

22
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,071
Did you find the book I requested?

23
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,868
Sure, I've guarded it well for you.

24
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:02,430
Really?

25
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,811
I think the book you want is

26
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,369
way back there.

27
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,415
Wow, things have really
deteriorated since I left.

28
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,553
Gesturing at me with your chin?

29
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,981
Where's the club president?

30
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,585
The new president's policy is,
you get your own book. Sir.

31
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,662
If that's your policy, then, I shall follow it.

32
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,328
You're back!

33
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,327
Who's this?

34
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,869
I'll introduce you.

35
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,341
A freshman, SUH In-ha...
A gift to the club on my return.

36
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,375
The No. 2 in this book club,

37
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,139
med student Choi Jung-ran.

38
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,643
More a sacrificial offering
than a gift, perhaps.

39
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,411
But you'll have no regrets
or retreats once you're in.

40
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,179
- Good luck
- Yes, sir

41
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,556
We'll need everything on
Chosun folk painting,

42
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,992
so let's look for books first.

43
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:53,651
Yes.

44
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,990
Okay! Let's go.

45
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,559
However Confucian the society
was... look!

46
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,163
This is all voyeuristic eroticism.

47
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,999
These were drawn because
there was an audience for them.

48
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,332
The nobility bans the
Songs of Physical Love,

49
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,466
while they order and print these
among themselves.

50
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,342
The Chosun Era is nothing.

51
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,244
In the history of Koryo,
...was it the 16th king?

52
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,876
He was negligent of his rule
due to a homosexual affair.

53
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,215
- Really?
- In where?

54
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,456
You mean our country's gay history
goes that far back?

55
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,015
Then if the king was gay,

56
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,192
the queen was a man?

57
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,359
- Why?
- Hey, move, move!

58
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,297
When you people come,
even I get a bit distracted.

59
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,802
- Am I really a book seller?
- Yes.

60
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,031
You get prettier each time I see you.

61
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,335
- What's up?
- Thank you.

62
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,304
Wait, if they're gay,

63
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,145
then it must be the
Songs of Gay Love.

64
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:52,979
Put this in your mouth.

65
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,383
Eat a shrimp chip.

66
00:05:55,722 --> 00:06:00,853
Sung-ho, what are the
Songs of Love... What was it?

67
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,228
Please understand him.

68
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,556
He went to high school
in the U.S., not here.

69
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,793
Oh, America...

70
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,733
He seems to speak Korean well.

71
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,899
How long were you there?

72
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,941
Hey, I like guys who speak English.

73
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,670
You didn't take entrance exams,
did you?

74
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,777
Wait, everyone.

75
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,109
I'll introduce him properly
over drinks later.

76
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,881
How about sorting though

77
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,746
- the books we found today?
- Yes.

78
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:24,510
Yes!

79
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,284
You grew up in America,

80
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,585
so you had no chance to learn
about our history or culture.

81
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,549
- Is that it?
- What?

82
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,787
Hui-jae!

83
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:39,132
Wherever you're brought up,
isn't it a good idea

84
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,123
to learn about your roots?

85
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,261
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,171
No need to apologize,
but if that's your attitude, go...

87
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,605
Hui-jae... No, President.

88
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,012
Wait a sec.

89
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,547
We know your style,
but you may have startled him.

90
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,778
You think so?

91
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,658
Excuse me.

92
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,495
Sorry to inconvenience you.

93
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,627
I'll study first, and then come back.

94
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,325
Forgive me.

95
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,622
Forgive me.

96
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,059
Forgive me.

97
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,494
Are you okay?

98
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,572
Forgive me. Goodbye.

99
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,608
He's going to destroy my book shop.

100
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,140
Attention, please.

101
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,376
I'm going to say something very moving.

102
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,610
What's that?

103
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,813
- In this beautiful season...
- Yes.

104
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,490
Buy books with hard cash!

105
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,355
She always spoke her mind
with great certainty.

106
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,634
Though I felt like I'd had both
cheeks slapped,

107
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,664
it was good incentive for me.

108
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,112
Oh, anatomy class is
such a headache for me.

109
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,512
You always do well anyways.

110
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,448
What a great day!

111
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,009
Why?

112
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,089
- Hui-jae
- Huh?

113
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,161
Wait a sec.

114
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,162
Hey.

115
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,551
You're working hard.

116
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,585
Jung-ran!

117
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,615
Was your head spinning there
at the book club?

118
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,283
It was fine.

119
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,795
President said it's okay
to come next week.

120
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,728
Then, see you around.

121
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,560
What?

122
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,396
Oh, but one thing...

123
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,538
This isn't next week's text.

124
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,136
We're not doing the Chosun Era?

125
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,810
The President is the one
who chooses texts.

126
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,778
Don't hate me.

127
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,352
Excuse me!

128
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:26,531
Thank you. Thank you.

129
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,873
In-ha! Put those here,

130
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,510
and can you get Hye-mi's books?

131
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,238
Sure.

132
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,114
Wow, sir, you could change
your profession.

133
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,689
I'm sorry, ma'am!

134
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,929
Good work, SUH In-ha!

135
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,426
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

136
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,774
In-ha! Pass!

137
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,142
- Hui-jae
- Pass!

138
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,939
She's not on our team!
You idiot!

139
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,496
- One to six!
- Six to four!

140
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,193
- Four to three!
- Three to two!

141
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,067
- Two to six!
- Six to two!

142
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,369
Try again...

143
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,202
It's no use. You all go ahead.

144
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,606
When In-ha comes, I'll take him.

145
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,307
The new guy's slacking off, huh?

146
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,646
Sung-ho, I'll wait with you.

147
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,820
No, you go and guide the group.

148
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,118
Jung-ran, go and get dinner ready.

149
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,383
Why, are you planning to give
In-ha a beating?

150
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,648
No, Sung-ho.

151
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,655
- Okay, let's go.
- The ship's leaving. Go.

152
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,163
Don't worry. He can take it.

153
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:34,150
Hui-jae!

154
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,825
Oh, I'm sorry. Did everyone...

155
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,964
- Ahh!
- You know what time it is?

156
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,393
But I left early...

157
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,662
So?

158
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,405
Everyone said to come to the wharf.

159
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,929
So what?

160
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,236
I didn't know "wharf" and "harbor"

161
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,376
were the same.

162
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,839
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,946
Let's go.

164
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,002
Hui-jae!

165
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,239
You look so comfortable there!

166
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,284
This is great!

167
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,188
There's so much water
in this country.

168
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,692
When I took the bus
from the airport,

169
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,330
it was impressive seeing
the Han River

170
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,424
next to the highway.

171
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,716
Is it inconvenient for you,
having so many of us here?

172
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,378
Not at all! Having you here
brings the place to life.

173
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,079
Sorry for the trouble!

174
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,087
Oh, it's no problem.

175
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,160
So, should we read
"The Fox and the Crane?"

176
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,719
Yes!

177
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,860
Open to page 20.
Who wants to read?

178
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,628
- Me!
- Me!

179
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,670
Will you do it, Min-jung?

180
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,762
Yes.

181
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,901
A few days later, the crane invited

182
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,737
the fox home.

183
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,641
The fox went happily
to the crane's home.

184
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,908
But the food was served in

185
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,780
bowls with tall necks.

186
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,353
I made this specially for you.

187
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,685
- Hey, Dong-hyun.
- Shit!

188
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,518
Keep reading...

189
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,856
Hey, KANG Dong-hyun!

190
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,322
Stop!

191
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,400
Dong-hyun!

192
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,979
Hui-jae!

193
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,882
Are you okay? What's wrong?

194
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,546
Catch Dong-hyun for me.

195
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,324
Hey, Dong-hyun!

196
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,566
Let me go!

197
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,797
Let me go! Shit!

198
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,441
Let me go! Shit!

199
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,879
- Shit!
- Dong-hyun!

200
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,185
Shit!

201
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,049
It's a spank for every swear word.
You have two now.

202
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,561
If you want to swear,
make noise and run away,

203
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,359
then you should quit camp.

204
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:20,870
But I'd rather that
you stayed at camp.

205
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,335
At camp you can read books
and even win prizes.

206
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,072
Huh, prizes?

207
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,278
Speak politely!

208
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,781
If you read the whole book,

209
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,483
I'll give you a special gift.

210
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,126
You'll give me whatever I want?

211
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,991
Sure.

212
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,035
Do you promise?

213
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,066
I promise.

214
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,706
Be sure to stir it well,
so it doesn't stick together.

215
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:01,813
Okay.

216
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,944
Save some for us.

217
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,109
That rice wine is great!

218
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,588
Work hard, In-ha.

219
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,294
I'm envious, seeing your life here.

220
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,956
Move here after you get married.

221
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,266
Rice wine.

222
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,857
Thank you.

223
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,332
Enjoy it!

224
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,028
Hui-jae, you want a cup?

225
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,004
You go ahead.

226
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,508
This is beautiful!

227
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,702
You could make a great
picture book with this.

228
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,671
Sure. It's a bit expensive, though.

229
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,715
Because it takes a lot of work.

230
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,279
Honey, we're almost
out of lime and glue.

231
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,513
When you go out this weekend...

232
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,057
Sure, I was planning to
go out with Sung-ho.

233
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,185
That new member is a good worker.

234
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,024
Oh, I heard there was a fuss with
Dong-hyun this morning?

235
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,228
He caught me by surprise...

236
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,297
Is he always like that?

237
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,100
Ever since his mother ran off.

238
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,401
She said she'd be back in two days...

239
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,011
But I think someone told him that

240
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,706
she ran away.

241
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,212
Kid's behavior is determined
by parents.

242
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,546
His mother lying like that, well...

243
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,113
He doesn't believe anything

244
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,348
that adults tell him.

245
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,952
Hui-jae looks much stronger
than she did as a freshman.

246
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,560
Leading the children,
presiding over the club...

247
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,364
Words like enthusiasm,
sincerity and responsibility

248
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,269
all fit her perfectly.

249
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,344
You sound like a man
bragging about his wife.

250
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,079
KANG Dong-hyun! Come up.

251
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,352
Good for you!

252
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,978
Nice job.

253
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,090
- KIM Tae-hyun!
- Yes!

254
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,856
Come on up.

255
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,926
- Nice work, Tae-hyun.
- Thank you.

256
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,338
Teacher, you'll keep your promise?

257
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,210
Sure, what is it?

258
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,671
Swim up to there and back.

259
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,282
You see the red flag? To there.

260
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,486
What?

261
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,553
Dong-hyun, why are you so bad?

262
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,092
You know that she can't swim.

263
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:33,324
That's right, your teacher's
afraid of the water.

264
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,295
She fell in as a child.

265
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,130
Dong-hyun

266
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,071
do you want to play soccer
with me instead?

267
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,205
Yeah!

268
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,570
I'll go.

269
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,170
I promised.

270
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,540
Hui-jae...

271
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,278
In-ha, stop her.

272
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,280
She fell in the water
during 1st year

273
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,014
and nearly drowned.

274
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,925
Open your eyes.

275
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,539
Open your eyes, Hui-jae!

276
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,675
Look at me, not the water.

277
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,878
It's okay up to here.
It's not deep.

278
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:28,316
Slowly... I'm here,
so don't worry.

279
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,318
Good.

280
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,184
- Out of the way!
- Just a sec.

281
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,987
Dong-hyun, is that okay?

282
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,859
A bad compromise makes it worse.

283
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,763
Hui-jae...

284
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,363
Is that okay?

285
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,432
Answer him, quick!

286
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,670
Is it okay?

287
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,111
He said it's...

288
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,829
- She hasn't woken up yet?
- No.

289
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,398
But doesn't she need to go
to the hospital?

290
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,046
It's just a combination of

291
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,207
lack of sleep and stress.

292
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,676
She didn't faint,
she's just sleeping.

293
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,716
Hey, why don't you eat something?
You missed lunch.

294
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,522
I'm okay.

295
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,052
In-ha...

296
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,528
Do you like Hui-jae?

297
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,072
If she wakes up she should eat
something, so tell me.

298
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,687
Do you feel okay?

299
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,788
Before... was that you?

300
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,070
Did everything go well?

301
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,199
Yes.

302
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,749
Lie down.

303
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,284
I'm okay.

304
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,382
Have some water.

305
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,219
Stop, it's embarrassing having
a younger man care for me.

306
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,291
If a younger man said
he loved you...

307
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,359
Would you laugh at that too?

308
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,799
You really are laughing.

309
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,973
What's up with you?

310
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,711
Hey, SUH In-ha!

311
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:47,178
I'll forgive you only because
you saved my life today.

312
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,960
I understand, it can happen.

313
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,924
As a freshman, you can be
attracted to

314
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,090
older women.

315
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,138
It may sound trite,

316
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,573
but you'll thank me later
for refusing you.

317
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,272
So you're refusing me now?

318
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,315
Hey, SUH In-ha.

319
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,777
Why are you so serious?

320
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,818
Let's stop this.

321
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,319
We'll feel awkward later.

322
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,020
I'm tired. I want to be alone.

323
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,366
Your attitude now
seems more awkward.

324
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,335
I can't feel moved
by the confession of

325
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,003
a 20-year old.

326
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,917
People always say love is this

327
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,782
or love is that,

328
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,512
but this is what I think.

329
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,059
Love should include the will

330
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,788
to take responsibility.

331
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:09,530
Being overwhelmed with passion
like a sudden fever...

332
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,031
that's not to my taste.

333
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,868
Your hair has the
scent of chrysanthemums.

334
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:21,868
What?

335
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,776
I first saw you in the subway.

336
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,882
You spoke your mind freely,
even if you felt shaky.

337
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,557
I was standing behind you.

338
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:41,962
And when I picked up the coin
in front of the coffee machine,

339
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,026
the wind blew,

340
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:52,770
and I smelled chrysanthemums
from your waving hair.

341
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,881
I'd never smelled
such a thing before...

342
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,611
At the time, I thought
it a passing fancy.

343
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,783
So I didn't speak,

344
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,694
couldn't speak of it until now.

345
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,942
I'm sorry.

346
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,204
Let's go.

347
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,344
I've a favor to ask.

348
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,176
I don't want to lose a...

349
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,170
I've got a strong punch.

350
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,770
When you feel better,
then come out.

351
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,217
She punched my stomach,

352
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,183
but it was my heart that felt pain.

353
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,820
My chest ached from a thin

354
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,022
but deep wound.

355
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,097
When the physical pain healed,

356
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,998
I thought maybe I could forget her.

357
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,258
Hello? Hello?

358
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:19,519
Mister, has the last train left?

359
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,020
What? Soon, the first train
is going to arrive.

360
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,628
- Hello!
- Hi.

361
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,730
Hi.

362
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,702
What's this?

363
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,279
A gift from the male members
of the club.

364
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,871
So no flowers.

365
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,883
Oh, who's this?

366
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,089
In-ha?

367
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,291
Happy graduation.

368
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,059
Who is it?

369
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,764
The student that Hui-jae and
I told you about last time.

370
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,066
Who grew up in America...

371
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,037
Oh, right.

372
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,233
I wanted to see you

373
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,607
after hearing their stories.

374
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,611
Happy graduation.

375
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,814
You're so congratulatory.

376
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,648
You already said that before.

377
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,919
My 20-year old passion

378
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,859
didn't vanish with the next year.

379
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,488
Rather, it gained the weight of time.

380
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:50,774
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

381
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,777
- It's beautiful scenery.
- Uh...

382
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,504
Mom, it's great, huh?

383
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,116
Mother, Father...

384
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,484
It was good of us
to leave today, right?

385
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,490
In-ha!

386
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,672
The hardest thing for me to endure...

387
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,638
Because of me,

388
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,375
she's had to suffer
so much hardship.

389
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,115
That's the most difficult.

390
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,855
She was mine.

391
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,386
But I let her go.

392
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,400
And if I come now to try to win
her back,

393
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,667
I could hurt her even more.

394
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,869
In-ha...

395
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,205
If...

396
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,444
If another chance comes to me,

397
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,207
I'll never...

398
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,387
But I'll wait for her to accept me.

399
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,657
Many days passed
since I said those words.

400
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,692
Each morning

401
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,736
I'd pray, by some miracle,

402
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,635
to meet her again.

403
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,430
Like a bookmark

404
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,874
placed in a book she set aside,

405
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,712
...a person to remember for her

406
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,977
where to start reading again,

407
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,815
I pass another day.

408
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:54,920
This letter was sent
by Mr. Bookmark,

409
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,825
who sends a postcard
every Thursday.

410
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,831
Many listeners now wait

411
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,600
for his messages on Thursdays,

412
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,158
myself included.

413
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,897
Waiting for his love
to re-commence,

414
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,135
with expectant hope, I play
his request for you now.

415
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:15,043
This is JUNG Eun-ah.

416
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,143
Push a little more.

417
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,952
Like a person trying to
avoid the light,

418
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:31,323
or as if bright colors no longer
existed for her,

419
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,265
the works she produces
for this world

420
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:40,766
are like a darkness
crushed by sorrow.

421
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,502
Whenever I see her colors,

422
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,170
my heart still sinks.

423
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:54,814
I thought that time
would heal her wounds,

424
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,287
but I worry now that
they only become deeper,

425
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,881
and I feel more troubled.

426
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,992
It's me.

427
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,343
Come on in.

428
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,481
Have you had dinner?

429
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:30,050
Dinner? You know what time it is?

430
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,952
Isn't it around 8:00?

431
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,492
You want some coffee?

432
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,694
How about a drink?

433
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:47,695
Did anything happen?

434
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,472
Me?

435
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:51,566
What about you?

436
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,434
I'm so-so.

437
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,376
You shouldn't be just
so-so anymore.

438
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:09,821
You should let them go.
Your parents and Sung-ho...

439
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,566
What? I'm okay now.

440
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,703
Hui-jae, you're not okay.

441
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,241
Your wounds haven't healed,
they still hurt.

442
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,212
You just accept it
and live with the pain.

443
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,952
Your sensitivity doesn't suit a doctor.

444
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,051
We ought to switch professions.

445
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,388
Hui-jae!

446
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:02,973
I don't know if I have unhealed
wounds or not.

447
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,177
If I do, it's not a disaster.

448
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,055
I'm living fine as it is.

449
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,886
You call this living?

450
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,125
I haven't died.

451
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,586
This is the program
produced by In-ha.

452
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:51,319
It's Thursday, so shall we hear
from our tragic love?

453
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,863
A letter from Mr. Bookmark.

454
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,197
Is In-ha doing well?

455
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,600
I'm hungry...

456
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,307
Hui-jae, what are you doing?

457
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,807
You want something?

458
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,609
No, hurry back.

459
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:20,213
Her favorite drink was
half a glass of cold beer,

460
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,361
or a glass of cola, lemon,

461
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,989
and ice mixed with gin.

462
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:30,993
Whenever she drank,
she'd say she was hungry.

463
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,631
She'd say a banana
was better than

464
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,868
eating bread or rice.

465
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,411
Perhaps because the banana
was more filling...

466
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,746
she said, unlike a fruit,
it would stick to her throat.

467
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,987
I'm going crazy.

468
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:04,767
If Hui-jae eats fresh yogurt often,

469
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,804
it sustains her, and
makes her feel secure.

470
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,800
You know the convenience store
by her home?

471
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,306
She buys it there.

472
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:20,615
On Wednesday, she stops
at the bookstore for design...

473
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,015
Jung-ran.

474
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,723
You said it. You want her consent
through fate.

475
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,850
I'm telling you how to do it.

476
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:38,625
It won't happen just because
you two live in Seoul.

477
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,203
First, run into her as if by chance.

478
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,001
Then if fate doesn't bring you
her consent, it won't work.

479
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:53,545
Even if you spend the
same time together,

480
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,846
a person you're not destined
for won't be the same.

481
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,852
What are you scared of?

482
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,754
How long will you send letters
she doesn't hear into the air?

483
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:12,335
Young people wasting their time
this way is a crime.

484
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,796
Someday she'll hear it.

485
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,809
No, she won't.

486
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:24,377
She knows it's your program,
so she surely won't listen.

487
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,241
Why not?

488
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:38,656
She's decided not to let
anything enter her life.

489
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,143
Hello?

490
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,322
Oh, yes. No, I wasn't sleeping.

491
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,313
I was just finishing up.

492
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:45,352
Yes. Tomorrow? Okay.

493
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,931
But sir, we don't usually
work this way.

494
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,374
Sure, I know you're busy.

495
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,069
I need it fast without
any loss of quality,

496
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,909
so who else can do it besides you?

497
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:10,987
If it's popular, you can make books
with handmade paper.

498
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,749
Really?

499
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,685
You said it would be hard
because of the price.

500
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:19,058
This is very popular these days.

501
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,926
If all goes smoothly,
it will be a bestseller!

502
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:27,270
You'll get a bonus and
herbal medicine if you do well.

503
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:32,500
This series will be broadcast today,
so be sure to listen.

504
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,006
Okay.

505
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,312
Goodbye.

506
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,016
My trust is in you!

507
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,652
Taewon Publishers here.

508
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,161
Yes, I gave it to MIN Hui-jae
as you requested.

509
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,536
Today Mr. Bookmark

510
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,368
sent a letter about his first kiss.

511
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,238
He asked us to read it

512
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,505
at the start of the program.

513
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:16,382
For most people, a first kiss
comes with the start of love.

514
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,648
But for me,

515
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,748
my first kiss was a farewell instead.

516
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,758
In a dreamlike bliss,

517
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:29,458
I watched over her sleeping
and then she woke up.

518
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,631
I confessed my love for her.

519
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,234
I told her it was love,

520
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,572
but she said it was foolish passion.

521
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:46,581
I told her it was forever,
but she said it was momentary.

522
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:50,443
Now seven years have passed.

523
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,915
I want to say this to her.

524
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:59,122
Even still, she is my only love.

525
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,266
Now I want to call her my wife

526
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:07,133
and be called her husband.

527
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:07,860
Oh my god!

528
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:11,492
Isn't this from the woman on
Producer Suh's program?

529
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,599
- Right?
- What?

530
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,500
- Is it a prank?
- It's real! Look.

531
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,902
Wait.

532
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,411
I feel thankful that

533
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,715
someone has kept love in his heart.

534
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:37,518
But I refused him long ago,

535
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,353
and have been living
without his memory.

536
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:43,898
I feel so sorry, my heart is sore.

537
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:49,500
However, now I want him to let me go.

538
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,669
Please give him this message.

539
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,208
- Hello.
- Yes, come in.

540
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,515
Do you have any yogurt?

541
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,712
Oh, we're all sold out today.

542
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,762
Thank you, come again.

543
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,562
Oh, hello!

544
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,956
I will give you everything

545
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,261
you need.

546
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,169
- Please go.
- Hui-jae!

547
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,869
I have nothing to say
to you. I'm sorry.

548
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:08,676
I didn't wait this long
to hear that answer.

549
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:23,895
Now you can forgive yourself.

550
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,137
You can. It's okay.

551
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,199
Are you listening?

552
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,680
Stealing glances at you

553
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:50,358
in the boat on the way to the camp,

554
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,158
do you know how happy I was?

555
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,823
But now, I want to look you
straight in the eye.

556
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,169
Not from steal a glance at side

557
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:07,788
I barely survived after three operations.

558
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:15,262
A lot was broken in me.

559
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,399
Thank you for surviving.

560
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,783
Why do you love me?

561
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,682
Because it is you.

562
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,186
You were engaged to another man,

563
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:40,557
and he died. Your parents died,

564
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,161
and you're two years
older than In-ha.

565
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:46,361
I didn't want to refuse you
for such reasons.

566
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:51,465
None of this was your making,
and it must have been painful.

567
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:54,710
It's not right to hurt someone again

568
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,408
for such reasons.

569
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:05,849
But I didn't like that

570
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,481
your heart was wounded.

571
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,018
A wounded person...

572
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:17,924
doesn't know how to give
and receive love,

573
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,104
or how to express thanks
with a pure heart...

574
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,837
So I refused.

575
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:34,209
I said this to In-ha,
and he sent me these.

576
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,252
Your designs.

577
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,052
He said, because you are
naturally so warm,

578
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:51,959
he was confident
he could bring you back.

579
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,039
Do you believe you can?

580
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,981
You don't answer quickly.

581
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,645
Good.

582
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:12,815
You aren't a person
to speak casually.

583
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,551
So I will trust you.

584
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,689
Thank you.

585
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,727
With such a strong-willed husband

586
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:31,429
you'll have twice the joy
and twice the trouble as others.

587
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:36,502
Remember that marriage is
the biggest promise of your life,

588
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:41,750
and if you have difficulties,
good times will also follow.

589
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,149
Hui-jae, have some breakfast.

590
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:28,358
What time did you go to bed?

591
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:40,975
Your eyes are red. I think
you should sleep more.

592
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,339
I can't. This is for
tomorrow's meeting.

593
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:47,684
What do you mean?
You read it 5 times yesterday.

594
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:50,209
In-ha!

595
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,585
If you read with those eyes,
you'll see only red print.

596
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,287
Sleep just two hours, okay?

597
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,157
Just two hours...

598
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:05,098
Not two hours and a minute,
just two hours.

599
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,902
- All right...
- Let's go!

600
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,116
Ahem...

601
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,323
The book to be read...

602
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:34,227
No, the man reading is SUH In-ha.

603
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,257
I'll start from page 45...

604
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:46,067
Barthes said mythology is a
...transmission... right?

605
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,874
Transmission system,
springing from a form of...

606
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,311
a semantic process,

607
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,848
which in the issue of Echo...

608
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,278
capturing... There are so many
Chinese characters here...

609
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:03,188
Hui-jae, you really understand all this?

610
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,923
Wow, you must be a genius.

611
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,177
Are you okay?

612
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,797
Come fight!

613
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,106
What is it, In-ha?

614
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:54,609
Are you hurt?

615
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,940
Did you fall and hurt yourself?

616
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:00,607
I'm just thankful.

617
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,854
What do you mean?

618
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,161
It's the first time.

619
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:22,062
Since we married, it's the first time
I heard you laugh.

620
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:30,878
Thank you.

621
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,919
It's very healthy.

622
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:46,594
When it starts to move,
it'll drive you crazy kicking.

623
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,726
It's amazing, huh?

624
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:55,770
Are you that happy?

625
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,437
Hui-jae...

626
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:12,049
In movies, they say something
impressive now.

627
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,050
What should I say?

628
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:15,822
Say congratulations.

629
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,158
- Congratulations
- Jung-ran!

630
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,397
In-ha will be so happy.

631
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:31,069
You know that the normal regimen
doesn't apply to you?

632
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,037
You need a check every week.

633
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:36,407
Don't work hard, sleep well
and eat good food.

634
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:38,672
All right.

635
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,579
Don't just laugh,

636
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,743
it's a miracle you're pregnant.

637
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,979
You need to care for your body.

638
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:46,953
You're not having lunch?

639
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,048
I'll eat with In-ha.

640
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,422
The other mothers will be waiting for you.

641
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,619
Mothers?

642
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:57,297
Okay, I'll yield to In-ha, then.

643
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,834
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

644
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,859
These are In-ha's baby clothes.

645
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:31,724
I thought I'd save them
for when In-ha had a child.

646
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:37,032
After 3 years, I thought
I couldn't give them.

647
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,707
Thank you.

648
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:42,006
You should be happy,
for the baby's sake.

649
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:45,644
Don't think of others,
only of your body,

650
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,273
only move as it is
comfortable for you.

651
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:53,412
Look, I wore this once.

652
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,157
- Does it suit me?
- Give it to me.

653
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:06,501
What a lucky baby!
Your grandmother sent clothes.

654
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,264
Be healthy.

655
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:23,174
Hui-jae, are you okay?

656
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,717
Why do you keep vomiting?

657
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,159
All pregnant women do.

658
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,959
When I vomit,
don't stand so close.

659
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,939
You don't want to ride
in the car, right?

660
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,985
But what can I do?

661
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,680
We can't leave it here.

662
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:06,389
What are you doing?
Tomorrow morning?

663
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,790
How do we get home?
I can't walk that far.

664
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:15,270
I can. Let's go.

665
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,638
- Oh, great!
- You're not cold?

666
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:20,302
Okay, good.

667
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,860
Here's the heart,

668
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:50,828
these are the hands,
and the legs.

669
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,665
It's all there.

670
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,640
Of course.
It feels things too.

671
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:59,809
It feels, but mothers
aren't aware of it.

672
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,011
- I can feel it.
- You can?

673
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:07,186
Sure, when I'm comfortable,
my baby is, too.

674
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,917
If my baby is uncomfortable,
I feel uneasy and tired.

675
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,326
Parents can't change their kids,
but kids change them.

676
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,265
What do you mean?

677
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:24,098
You've become much gentler.
More talkative, too.

678
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:26,737
Really?

679
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,047
- Jung-ran.
- What?

680
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:38,676
Is it possible to have a
Caesarian a bit early?

681
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,823
Of course.

682
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:45,154
If the mother's in bad health,
or if the baby...

683
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,563
- Why, is something wrong?
- No.

684
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:55,395
Oh, look at me.

685
01:02:56,873 --> 01:03:00,832
I'm so happy about the pregnancy,
I wasn't thinking.

686
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:03,474
Get up. Let's go to internal medicine.

687
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,547
Don't worry.

688
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,340
I did it the last time I came.

689
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:09,977
What?

690
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,981
Everything's fine,

691
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,688
but the kidneys may be
pressed a bit,

692
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,395
so they said it'd be best

693
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,623
to deliver the baby at 8 months.

694
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:28,136
Sure, you be the doctor.

695
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,871
What's wrong?

696
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:37,674
Lucky you. You've got
a well-prepared mother.

697
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:42,041
At birth, your mother will have
your schoolbags ready.

698
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:44,981
That's not a bad idea.

699
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:48,783
I can just imagine it.

700
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,021
Bye.

701
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:51,821
- Go on it.
- Yes.

702
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:02,930
Dr. Choi.

703
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:07,207
Do you have so much time
in Internal Medicine?

704
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,873
Do you know the person
who just left now?

705
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:14,249
- She's my friend.
- Your friend?

706
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,081
What kind of friend?
Are you close?

707
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:21,281
No wonder you're single.
You can't tell she's married?

708
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,688
Keep your eyes off her,

709
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:26,125
she's even pregnant.

710
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:29,424
So I wanted to ask...

711
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:33,129
- is she having the baby?
- What?

712
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,039
Nice work, everyone.

713
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,339
Young producers these days,
they're too serious.

714
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,173
- Ah, yes...
- Eun-ha

715
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:47,043
- We should go out for soju sometime.
- Oh sure, goodbye.

716
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:52,046
Are you that opposed to it?

717
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,019
It's not that...

718
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,116
What can we do?
It's been decided above.

719
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,688
It's not like this program
isn't popular.

720
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,725
Do we really need to
broadcast this?

721
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:04,629
Well listeners like it,

722
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,828
and do you really think it's a lie?

723
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,868
I think it's genuine.
Cheer up, producer Suh.

724
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:18,047
For the past few years,

725
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:20,675
I've been so anxious about

726
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,809
not conceiving a baby.

727
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:26,645
I could have spent that
time in anticipation...

728
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:28,585
Now, amidst my joy,

729
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:31,125
I face a situation I never expected.

730
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:34,390
Thinking back now, I so regret

731
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,226
not enjoying the time I had.

732
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:40,526
In the time left to me,
so as not to feel regret,

733
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:45,163
I want to enjoy my life
as much as I can.

734
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,175
A letter from Ms. Paper Village.

735
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,097
Hui-jae!

736
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,598
You're not in bed yet?

737
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:23,338
I slept this afternoon.

738
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:27,746
You should lie down.

739
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:31,318
I read that at the beginning of
pregnancy, you sleep a lot.

740
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:36,114
I rested until early evening,
then I came out to hear your program.

741
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:42,192
- You listened to the program?
- Yeah.

742
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,592
Don't listen anymore.

743
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,795
Why not?

744
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:54,001
Just, it's late at night,

745
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:56,374
there are lots of depressing letters.

746
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,440
Listening when you're alone
isn't good.

747
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:03,310
It's not good for the baby, too.

748
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:05,920
It's because of that letter?

749
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,086
I didn't want to broadcast it, but...

750
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:19,567
Oh! I read that depression is

751
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:22,363
much more common at pregnancy.

752
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:28,071
You believe everything you read?

753
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,307
I'll get washed up,
then I'll massage your legs.

754
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:45,922
What would you do in her situation?

755
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:48,991
What?

756
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,693
Like that woman.

757
01:07:56,505 --> 01:08:01,875
If I had stomach cancer,
with no time for treatment...

758
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,204
Hui-jae!

759
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,611
Just curious...

760
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,418
I want to know your opinion.

761
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,188
This is what I mean.

762
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,185
Don't think about that sort of thing.

763
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,233
I don't like that woman either.

764
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,333
Why not?

765
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:37,544
How can she do that?

766
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:41,440
Hiding it from her husband
as long as possible.

767
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:44,309
Later, with no options left to her,

768
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,886
her husband finds out?

769
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:50,522
She should think of others.

770
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,123
- I think I understand her...
- I don't.

771
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,693
She should give up the baby
and get treatment.

772
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:06,865
No man would give up his wife
for a baby he's never seen.

773
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,145
She'll only live a
couple months anyway.

774
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,253
Two months, one year, 10 years...

775
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:18,811
how can you tell?

776
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:21,313
Medicine is never 100% accurate.

777
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,426
She's not giving her husband
any chance.

778
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,431
Yes... I suppose.

779
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,934
But in my opinion,

780
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,707
I think she wants to live too.

781
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:51,145
If there were a way,
she would want to live.

782
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,678
Let's stop this.

783
01:09:56,525 --> 01:10:00,188
Okay, let's stop.

784
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,950
- Who is it?
- It's me.

785
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,220
Just a minute.

786
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:34,826
One minute...

787
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:42,233
You're here early.
On your way to work?

788
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,832
My morning sickness is lasting
longer than the others...

789
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:51,905
I was just sick now, sorry.

790
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,310
What are you sorry for?

791
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,919
What's wrong, Jung-ran?

792
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:13,460
I'm sorry.

793
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,905
You're crazy.

794
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,279
You're bad.

795
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,807
You're really bad,
you always have been.

796
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,210
In-ha's sleeping.

797
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:45,260
I wasn't going to see you anymore.

798
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,195
Hui-jae's not my friend,

799
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,138
Hui-jae's not my friend,

800
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,810
Like an incantation,
I repeated it all night.

801
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:06,244
In-ha went through
so much for you.

802
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,152
Hui-jae.

803
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:15,229
Let's do an abortion.

804
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:21,293
You may not know it,
but I've always liked In-ha.

805
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,166
If you just go like this,

806
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,808
I might snatch him away in anger.

807
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:37,146
I don't know?

808
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:40,648
You think I don't know?

809
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,750
We like the same ttokbokki stand,

810
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,423
the same singer, the same friends...

811
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:54,397
We're so similar...
How could I not know?

812
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:09,110
When I found out about this, I thought...

813
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:14,984
Knowing that you like him,

814
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:23,160
I should bring you two together.

815
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:30,370
In-ha... In-ha is yours.

816
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,839
You think I was the only one
who liked him?

817
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:40,407
But he picked only you.

818
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:42,240
You know that.

819
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,045
Hui-jae.

820
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,123
Let's live.

821
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:00,992
You're a doctor.

822
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,806
Between the baby and me,

823
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,912
we should choose
the one who will live.

824
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,486
As for In-ha...

825
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:29,093
Don't tell him about this.

826
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:32,299
Please...

827
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:38,273
You won't be able to fool him,

828
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,740
it won't be possible.

829
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,640
I don't want...

830
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:45,806
to cause him pain because of me.

831
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:55,715
It will be too hard for him.

832
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,098
Hui-jae!

833
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,570
Jung-ran stopped by.

834
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:13,870
Oh, you did?

835
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,143
So early?

836
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:21,312
She wanted to give me nutrients,

837
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:23,851
but I never stopped by
to pick them up.

838
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:29,483
Why, is something wrong?

839
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:33,552
Pregnant women should be careful.
She's too thin.

840
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:37,557
In-ha takes such good care of me.

841
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:41,602
Yes, but is there anything else
I can do for her?

842
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:46,433
How about taking a year off,

843
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:48,936
and going somewhere nice

844
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:51,512
- until the baby is born?
- Jung-ran!

845
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:55,510
That's a good idea,

846
01:15:56,585 --> 01:16:00,021
but we should earn a lot to
bring up the baby well.

847
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:08,654
- It's late. I'll walk you to the car.
- Where are you going? I'll do it.

848
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:20,034
Don't worry. I won't steal your husband.

849
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:29,807
- In-ha, you use cologne?
- Yes.

850
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:32,947
I haven't put it on today.
Can you smell it?

851
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:37,825
If you use it a long time,
it becomes part of your scent.

852
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:42,388
But living with a person
who vomits a lot,

853
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:45,431
it might be better not to use it.

854
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,795
Hui-jae said she likes it.

855
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:51,462
I never used it before marriage.

856
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,008
Hui-jae is more sensitive now.

857
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:58,509
You should take great care
with everything.

858
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,413
I understand.

859
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,212
I feel secure having you around.

860
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,348
Thank you, Jung-ran.

861
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,173
His friendly voice is...

862
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:09,978
a great trength for the baby and me.

863
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:15,587
From long ago, he called
my name and soothed me.

864
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:19,021
The voice I waited for...

865
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:26,056
Today too, I lean on his voice
to ease my worries.

866
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,001
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

867
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:20,984
- What is it?
- Nothing...

868
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,924
Hurry, aren't you late?

869
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:28,460
Yeah, I should go.

870
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:44,839
- Do you have the next letter ready?
- Yes, it's ready.

871
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:49,042
- Oh, how's your wife?
- Not bad.

872
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:52,183
Has she been to the hospital?

873
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:55,248
If you're so worried about her,
then visit the hospital.

874
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:56,950
She's already been.

875
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:00,351
Her best friend's an obstetrician,

876
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:01,895
she said everything's fine.

877
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,157
- I'm relieved.
- Yeah.

878
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:07,201
But do I look so worried?

879
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,436
You do.

880
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,734
You look so tired these days,
I feel tired too.

881
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,273
Go on in.

882
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:13,705
- Yeah
- The letter...

883
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,436
Yes, here it is.

884
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:17,808
- Ms. Paper Village...
- Good luck.

885
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,341
Hello? Oh, Mr. Park.

886
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,753
Yes, how are you?

887
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,482
Oh, nothing special.

888
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:28,850
I enjoyed the handmade paper book.

889
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:31,824
Yes, it was really nice.
Just a minute.

890
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:38,625
A letter from Ms. Paper Village.

891
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,564
Yes.

892
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:41,932
I love his scent.

893
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:48,404
He uses a cologne
which matches his bright gaze.

894
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:52,380
The cologne mixes together
with his own scent.

895
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,644
It smells its own scent.

896
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:59,814
But these days, the scent
is difficult for me to bear.

897
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:04,224
At first, I blamed my baby

898
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:06,851
For not liking the scent.

899
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,101
But I discovered it is not
because of my baby.

900
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:14,625
Hello? In-ha...

901
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:18,406
It is because of the cancer

902
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,431
in my stomach.

903
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:24,807
I wanted to remember
my husband's scent a bit longer,

904
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:28,882
Now, even worse than

905
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,450
the pain I feel each morning

906
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,987
is losing my husband's scent.

907
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:50,068
But she hasn't started
receiving patients!

908
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:53,506
It's okay.

909
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:10,948
I'm sorry, In-ha.

910
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:25,736
In-ha.

911
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,501
Pretend that you don't know.

912
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:33,708
Hui-jae wants it that way.

913
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,581
If my mother were alive,

914
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:17,214
do you know what she'd say?

915
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:18,587
What?

916
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:22,425
That you were caring for
a cracked chamberpot.

917
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:24,963
A cracked... what?
What's a chamberpot?

918
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:26,701
If it breaks, you will be in big trouble.

919
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:30,797
So you should always be careful.
Great caution.

920
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:34,269
You look happy, Hui-jae!

921
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:36,844
I am...

922
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:40,707
I have my husband, and my baby...

923
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:43,174
The breeze is nice...

924
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:46,477
Should I skip work
like this every day?

925
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:49,513
Sure! You think I'll refuse?

926
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:54,161
Let's do it, then.
I can leave from next week.

927
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:56,425
You were fired?

928
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,266
Sabbatical.

929
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:03,938
One guy from each department
gets a year off. With pay.

930
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:05,970
The radio station adopted it too.

931
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:07,272
Really?

932
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:09,810
Of course! Why would I lie?

933
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:14,115
Where shall we go?
Is there a place you want to visit?

934
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:15,512
We can really go?

935
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,551
It's paid vacation?

936
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,425
- You'll be cold.
- I'm okay.

937
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:34,531
I got a call from Park a while back.

938
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,069
They're having a paper exhibition,

939
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,333
so they'll be away, and they said

940
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:43,773
we could stay there.

941
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:49,783
- Oh, you're serious.
- Hui-jae.

942
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:56,221
- It's because I'm so happy.
- Are you that happy?

943
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:59,892
- I am.
- Kiss me.

944
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:22,082
Hello, this is JUNG Eun-ah
for Nighttime Music.

945
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:26,983
Today is a sad day
for the staff of this program.

946
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,955
So this will be the final night
with Producer Suh.

947
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:32,219
He will take some time off
for a while

948
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:35,285
So today will be the
last Nighttime Music

949
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:37,092
with Producer Suh

950
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:39,723
Hello, this is SUH In-ha.

951
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:45,128
I'd like to thank all the listeners

952
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,465
who have shared

953
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:50,544
their joys and sorrows
together with us.

954
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:54,107
I'm sorry.

955
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:59,977
In particular... the letters
by Ms. Paper Village...

956
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:04,581
have led us to think about
our lives and families.

957
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:07,961
With thanks and encouragement

958
01:26:08,029 --> 01:26:10,827
I'd like to read her letter

959
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:13,299
in place of a goodbye.

960
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:19,900
The intervals between my bouts
of pain are shortening.

961
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:27,273
At first, this strange feeling was
frightening and painful.

962
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:33,513
But now, the tranquil gaps
between the pain

963
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,452
are more precious to me.

964
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:41,057
I am thankful to still have time

965
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:44,130
when I can laugh, gazing at him.

966
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:48,503
My precious body,

967
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:52,906
that feels the warmth coursing
from his fingers.

968
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:59,211
This long time, which
I thought would last forever,

969
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:02,514
was not enough to
express my love,

970
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:07,645
not enough to express my thanks,
and I want to say

971
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:12,292
that this lost time is
my heart's biggest regret.

972
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:30,834
White flag up!

973
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:34,842
Blue flag down, white flag up!

974
01:28:35,109 --> 01:28:36,770
What's this?

975
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:44,215
Blue flag down, white flag down.

976
01:28:46,187 --> 01:28:47,484
You try it.

977
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:52,023
Okay, white flag up.

978
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:54,922
Blue flag down.

979
01:28:57,131 --> 01:29:02,000
Not that way, this way.

980
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,564
- What is it?
- Just a minute.

981
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:10,908
Okay, to the right.

982
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:15,347
- I'm curious!
- Okay, open your eyes.

983
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:20,578
One, two, three...!

984
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:25,558
Have a seat.

985
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:31,790
I hid this from you

986
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:35,636
in our luggage so we could have it.

987
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:39,663
And this too.
It's okay to have a little.

988
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,203
So that's why you were so busy.

989
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:45,302
Yeah.

990
01:29:48,349 --> 01:29:49,941
Cheers!

991
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:04,127
Are you still scared of the water?

992
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:10,470
Why should I, when I have you?

993
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:26,616
It's chilly. Do you want to go in?

994
01:30:27,822 --> 01:30:30,222
No, let's stay longer.

995
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:35,722
I'll do what I want,
like your mother told me.

996
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:40,099
I'm a good daughter-in-law.

997
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:45,534
You do that.

998
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:51,169
If you don't want to do
something, tell me.

999
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:53,277
I'll do it.

1000
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:06,592
When the baby's born,
you change the diapers.

1001
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:10,254
Okay.

1002
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:15,461
You wash the baby, too.

1003
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:18,761
Yeah.

1004
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:23,806
You should mix the milk as well.

1005
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:28,305
All right.

1006
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:36,211
As for teaching numbers and letters,

1007
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:41,087
I'm ill-tempered,
so I don't think I can do it.

1008
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:49,361
I'll take care of it all.

1009
01:32:00,414 --> 01:32:04,214
I'll have a hard time
watching her get injections.

1010
01:32:05,453 --> 01:32:08,251
So you take the her
to the hospital for shots.

1011
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:14,688
Yeah.

1012
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,598
I said I'll take care of it.

1013
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:26,531
Don't worry.

1014
01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:34,073
There's nothing for you
to worry about.

1015
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:35,535
Hui-jae!

1016
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:38,970
It's nothing.

1017
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,741
It's the television. Stay there!

1018
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:47,310
Okay, I see...

1019
01:33:51,859 --> 01:33:53,827
Is it a couple fighting on TV?

1020
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:01,799
Hui-jae!

1021
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:14,845
Hui-jae, are you okay?

1022
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,842
Look at me, Hui-jae!

1023
01:34:29,463 --> 01:34:30,623
Hui-jae!

1024
01:34:31,799 --> 01:34:33,061
Hold on.

1025
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:37,296
Hold on. Just a minute.

1026
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:57,989
- Don't!
- It's okay, Hui-jae.

1027
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:00,650
- No!
- It's okay, Hui-jae.

1028
01:35:02,763 --> 01:35:05,231
It's not bad for the baby.
It's morphine.

1029
01:35:05,332 --> 01:35:07,357
Jung-ran gave it to me.

1030
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:11,131
Please Hui-jae...

1031
01:35:12,773 --> 01:35:17,005
Please, please...

1032
01:35:17,611 --> 01:35:19,238
Don't!

1033
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:45,630
I'm O.K.

1034
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,110
I'm sorry.

1035
01:36:04,024 --> 01:36:08,358
Why? What are you sorry for?

1036
01:36:17,738 --> 01:36:20,866
- When I go...
- Hui-jae!

1037
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:44,192
At first, I was really angry.

1038
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,595
Why me?

1039
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:51,471
Why me now?

1040
01:36:55,342 --> 01:36:57,674
But come to think of it,

1041
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:03,107
I was much happier than others.

1042
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:09,756
This time together,

1043
01:37:10,591 --> 01:37:12,821
being loved by you, was enough.

1044
01:37:18,432 --> 01:37:19,797
But...

1045
01:37:23,137 --> 01:37:25,901
If I go...

1046
01:37:30,778 --> 01:37:32,871
what about you?

1047
01:37:37,484 --> 01:37:39,782
You can't find things
right in front of you.

1048
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:44,957
Who will get you the nail clippers?

1049
01:37:50,464 --> 01:37:54,696
You always liked tumbling

1050
01:37:55,302 --> 01:37:58,066
in the thick blanket in winter,

1051
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:04,934
don't use a thin blanket
when summer passes.

1052
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:17,251
I wasn't a wife to care well for you,

1053
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:22,424
but when I go, the empty room
will be so large.

1054
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:35,266
Later, later,

1055
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:40,043
much later,
when we meet again,

1056
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:46,579
I'll compliment you.

1057
01:38:49,523 --> 01:38:51,650
Don't feel too stressed,

1058
01:38:53,894 --> 01:38:56,260
don't give up on anything.

1059
01:39:01,535 --> 01:39:06,268
Promise me, okay?

1060
01:39:13,847 --> 01:39:15,576
I promise.

1061
01:39:20,587 --> 01:39:22,487
Hui-jae, I love you.

1062
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:27,086
I love you.

1063
01:39:40,074 --> 01:39:43,601
What you think about Jae-in?

1064
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:46,271
Jae-in?

1065
01:39:48,082 --> 01:39:51,108
Jae-in means...

1066
01:39:51,585 --> 01:39:56,522
...pretty, smart, and sincere,
just like you.

1067
01:39:58,425 --> 01:40:03,089
Jae-in... SUH Jae-in.

1068
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:05,788
Good.

1069
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:10,532
Vital signals?

1070
01:40:10,604 --> 01:40:12,071
She's very unstable.

1071
01:40:12,139 --> 01:40:14,437
- What's her blood pressure?
- 90 over 50.

1072
01:40:15,275 --> 01:40:16,640
Hui-jae!

1073
01:40:17,344 --> 01:40:19,335
Hui-jae! Hang on a little longer.

1074
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:44,528
First knife.

1075
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:52,044
Scissors.

1076
01:40:57,718 --> 01:40:59,845
My dear Jae-in...

1077
01:41:00,287 --> 01:41:03,415
I hope you can express

1078
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:05,856
your love openly.

1079
01:41:07,795 --> 01:41:11,094
To your father, in place of me.

1080
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:16,967
Your mother could only say it once.

1081
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:21,765
Jae-in, say I love you very often.

1082
01:41:24,011 --> 01:41:28,539
To the trees, to the sea,

1083
01:41:29,183 --> 01:41:34,143
to the sky, to your father.

1084
01:41:37,624 --> 01:41:40,115
- Is the baby okay?
- Yes, she's fine.

1085
01:41:41,295 --> 01:41:42,694
Hold this.

1086
01:41:43,297 --> 01:41:45,595
Suction. Hold it tight!

1087
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:47,964
The placenta has passed,
let's do the uterine suture.

1088
01:41:48,035 --> 01:41:49,627
- Chromic one-zero.
- Do the suture now.

1089
01:41:49,703 --> 01:41:51,136
The cancer has spread.

1090
01:41:51,205 --> 01:41:53,571
Her blood pressure is falling.

1091
01:41:55,576 --> 01:41:57,737
Oxygen saturation is falling.

1092
01:42:00,881 --> 01:42:02,678
Oxygen level at 85%!

1093
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:05,486
- Reverse I.V. And oxygen!
- Reverse I.V. Completed.

1094
01:42:05,486 --> 01:42:07,579
Damn, hurry with the CPR.

1095
01:42:16,663 --> 01:42:19,131
Hui-jae, please open your eyes.

1096
01:42:19,366 --> 01:42:21,129
Open them.

1097
01:42:22,503 --> 01:42:23,800
Hui-jae.

1098
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:27,207
If you don't wake up,
you can't see Jae-in.

1099
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:29,471
Please open your eyes.

1100
01:42:32,179 --> 01:42:33,510
Hui-jae.

1101
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:51,590
In-ha... Our Jae-in is so pretty.

1102
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:57,904
But what can I do?
I can't go home with her.

1103
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:03,199
But I'm relieved you

1104
01:43:03,343 --> 01:43:05,208
don't have to go home alone.

1105
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:09,679
Because I leave Jae-in beside you.

1106
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:13,148
You can forgive me, right?

1107
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:16,918
You've been so good to me,
and I was so happy.

1108
01:43:17,658 --> 01:43:21,685
I will carve all this in my soul
before going.

1109
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:33,295
I love you, trees.

1110
01:43:35,275 --> 01:43:37,573
I love you, sea.

1111
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:41,470
I love you, sky.

1112
01:43:44,484 --> 01:43:46,782
I love you, mom.

1113
01:43:49,923 --> 01:43:52,357
I love you, dad.

1114
01:43:57,431 --> 01:44:00,332
I love you very much too, Jae-in.
