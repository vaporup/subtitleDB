1
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,351
Shangkuan, your Eagle's Claw
has destroyed my Snake's Fist school.

2
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,479
Damn you for killing my students!

3
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,198
The Eagle's Claw and Snake's Fist
are mortal enemies.

4
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,638
It is God's will that your diabolical sect
has been destroyed.

5
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,592
As grand master of my school,
I must avenge my dead.

6
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,320
Surely you realise that
your technique is inferior to mine?

7
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,075
I do this to honour my ancestors,
and though I may die today -

8
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,917
- my descendants will ensure
the Snake's Fist doesn't die with me.

9
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,911
Yes, and as long as
Pai Chang-tien lives -

10
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,232
- the flag of the Snake's Fist still flies!

11
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,353
After I've killed you,
Pai Chang-tien is next!

12
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,988
- Where's Pai Chang-tien?
- He's very sly. You won't find him!

13
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,151
Pai Chang-tien...

14
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,036
GUEST HOUSE

15
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,428
I told you not to bother me.
Do you want to die?

16
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,713
No flies on me!

17
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,510
- He owes a month's rent!
- Inn-keeper, be reasonable...

18
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,319
So, he won't pay...

19
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,477
I'll pay you, just give me two days.

20
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,913
See what's in the basket.

21
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,558
What are you doing?

22
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,677
- That's just my snake.
- A snake!

23
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,837
Stop him!

24
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,758
Remember, always use your head!

25
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,152
I can't jaw away all day.
It's hard to stomach, I know.

26
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,154
So, there's no chance of some grub.

27
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,391
What does my kick taste like?

28
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,476
My teeth!

29
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,394
"Cicada's escape."

30
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,198
One, two, three, four
and again, damn it!

31
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,555
You've been bowled over!

32
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,070
Bowl... chopsticks...
bowl... chopsticks!

33
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,557
- I'll... kill... you!
- Using a weapon? Really, brother...

34
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,319
- I must run.
- Come back, you scoundrel!

35
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,073
Excuse me...

36
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,513
Come back!

37
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,120
- What's up?
- That damned rascal had a snake!

38
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,997
A snake...

39
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,672
HUNG-TAI SCHOOL

40
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,071
- Chien-fu, don't neglect your chores.
- I'm... I'm not!

41
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,069
- So, you're splashing me...?
- Sorry. I'll wipe it up.

42
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,910
Damn fool!

43
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,753
- I didn't mean...
- Simpleton!

44
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,395
Clean it up.

45
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,954
That will teach you
to take more care next time.

46
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,677
While the master's away,
Li and I will be in charge.

47
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,958
Today, I'll teach you "dragon-tiger fist".

48
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:36,798
- Then you'll be able to beat ten men.
- Ten eggs maybe.

49
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,755
And don't forget to pay your fees!

50
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,435
Master Li and I will demonstrate.

51
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,829
Watch closely.

52
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,516
- Dragon-fist!
- Tiger-fist!

53
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,752
- Nice going!
- Impressive, huh?

54
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,914
- Stop laughing!
- What's so funny?!

55
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,595
What are you laughing at?!
- Chien-fu!

56
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,995
Why laugh at your teacher?

57
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,958
- What's so funny?
- What?

58
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,877
Ah, Chien-fu...

59
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,159
Fighters must be fast,
accurate and ferocious.

60
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,789
I'll now demonstrate
"golden dragon's claw".

61
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,112
Ready... Observe how
the abdomen is now exposed.

62
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,831
- A hit!
- You see, a hit!

63
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,596
The next stance is "preying-tiger".

64
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,356
Stretch out your hand.
No, no... the other one.

65
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,069
Exposed again...
I didn't tell you to resist.

66
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,154
An irresistable attack.

67
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,837
- Well, was it fantastic?
- Fantastic!

68
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,514
Remember what you've learnt today.

69
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,758
- Carry on with your practice.
- Come on, get moving.

70
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,631
Were you used as
a human punchbag again?

71
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,319
Shall I apply some balm for you?

72
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,631
HING-WEI SCHOOL

73
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,510
I'll rest here.

74
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,278
Here is your drink, magistrate.

75
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,439
It's an honour to welcome the owner -

76
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,680
- of so many restaurants,
pawn shops and funeral parlours.

77
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,675
Although your son is as fat as a pig...

78
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,638
More evidence of your prosperity.

79
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,838
But if he doesn't train his muscles -

80
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,992
- they'll lose the strength
so evident in his father.

81
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,153
Yes, there's truth in what you say.

82
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,916
It's for this reason
that I want my son to learn kung fu.

83
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,112
It's true that there are many
martial arts schools in our province...

84
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,554
Really? So why haven't I heard of it?

85
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,713
If you don't believe me,
believe your own eyes.

86
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,037
I've seen guys in the street
break bricks with their bare hands.

87
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,389
- Can your students do that?
- Such feats are simplicity itself for us.

88
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,268
Demonstrate your brick breaking
for young master.

89
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,031
Breaking stone with your fists
is a marvellous feeling.

90
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,349
Wait! Hold it...

91
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,116
Feel up to it?

92
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,954
Sure, no problem.

93
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,075
That's superb!

94
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,917
- That was marvellous!
- Not at all...

95
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,355
One of our students is competing
in the Three Provinces Championship.

96
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,908
- Really?
- Sure!

97
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,199
- You'd like to study here?
- Yes, I want to join this school.

98
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,829
It's agreed then, he'll start tomorrow.

99
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,275
One moment...
The magistrate's leaving!

100
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,309
I'm coming!

101
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,359
Say goodbye to our new pupil.

102
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,115
His hand looks crushed!
I'm not staying here.

103
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,557
Father, let's try Hung-tai School...

104
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,314
But magistrate...

105
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,589
Magistrate! Magistrate!

106
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,071
Get inside...

107
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,272
The sight of this layabout
is driving away business.

108
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,351
- Get rid of him!
- Yes!!

109
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,680
- What...?
- Who said you could sleep here?

110
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,718
Sorry, I'll leave at once.

111
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,271
Stop! You can't beat an old man!

112
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,628
- He's got guts. Who is he?
- He's from Hung-tai School.

113
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,188
Hung-tai School? Beat him!

114
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,551
Get him!

115
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,114
- Are you hurt?
- No!

116
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,874
Not my hand again!

117
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,079
My back!

118
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,990
Brothers, in the name of God,
don't fight! Brothers, stop fighting!

119
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,039
- Don't, brothers...
- Why not?

120
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,159
If a man strikes one cheek,
offer him the other.

121
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,196
That's your advice?

122
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,236
You dare... God won't forgive you!

123
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,669
- This way.
- Are you hurt?

124
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,389
- No, I'm used to blows!
- You're used to them?

125
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,914
This is the back door
of Hung-tai School. Come in and rest.

126
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,356
This is the back yard.
Very few people come here.

127
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,749
I live in this store room.

128
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,678
Cat, cat, cat
speak to our guest in the hat.

129
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,710
There...

130
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,519
Have a seat.

131
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,158
- Have a bowl of hot tea.
- Thanks.

132
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,716
- Why don't you drink?
- I never drink hot tea.

133
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,634
- I'll get a cold one.
- Good...

134
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,477
Chang, finished your shopping?

135
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,714
Old man, he's our cook.
His cooking is very tasty.

136
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,191
Save your flattery. And this is...?

137
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,960
He's my relative.

138
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,270
Chang, I haven't eaten yet.

139
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,154
Help yourself.
I've kept your meal warm for you.

140
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,710
I have to serve the guests.

141
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,712
Magistrate, I assure you...

142
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,952
The students here
find it's only a matter of time -

143
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,679
- before they become invincible.

144
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,476
Mr. Li, you must be a great teacher!

145
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,556
Is that so? Wei-wu School has
sent students to the championship.

146
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,631
Can you say the same?

147
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,474
What's so special about entering
students for the competition?

148
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:22,477
Although our Mr. Hung will be present
for the contest - he's the judge.

149
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,599
If he's the judge,
then his kung fu must be splendid.

150
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,070
Naturally, he was the best in his day.

151
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,914
- How many bricks can he break?
- Bricks?

152
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,556
I don't teach party tricks,
I teach real kung fu.

153
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,434
Young master, you were obviously
born to be a good fighter.

154
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:59,471
You're clever and tactful. Study here,
and you'll soon be an expert.

155
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,269
- Really?
- Of course!

156
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,753
Chang, bring Chien-fu here.

157
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,870
- What's your name?
- I'm Chien-fu.

158
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,918
- Your father was called Chien?
- No, sir.

159
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,390
I'm an orphan. The school took me in.

160
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,359
They say Chien is a good name
for someone simple-minded like me.

161
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,349
- What's your name?
- Oh...

162
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,195
Chien-fu... Mr. Li wants to see you.

163
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:50,117
You take it easy, old man.
I'll be back soon, so don't go away.

164
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,992
This is the young master
of Chin-san Bank.

165
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,870
He has been here a month,
and his progress is remarkable.

166
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,119
You see this big guy?
He's one tough cookie, I assure you.

167
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,754
Chien-fu, fight with Bean
for the benefit of our guests.

168
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,230
But don't resist, got it?

169
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,276
Be careful.

170
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,952
Begin.

171
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,432
Good! Beat him... Beat him!

172
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,635
You dare to fight back
and disobey Mr. Li?

173
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,871
Hit him!

174
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,160
Stop! That's enough!

175
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,871
Chien-fu, rest up
and you'll be better in no time.

176
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,311
Father, I want to stay here!

177
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,389
Chien-fu, are you okay?

178
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,789
- I'm alright.
- Alright... You've been fighting.

179
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,350
I haven't... It was...

180
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,556
You don't understand.
He's the school's human punchbag.

181
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,831
A punchbag?

182
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,231
Mr. Li forces him
to take the punishment.

183
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,673
Chien-fu, can you grab the bowl?

184
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,790
I don't think you can.

185
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,040
Old man... Old man?

186
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,596
Shabby cat...

187
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,159
"Twist and turn, in a blur
of hands and feet. Writhe like a snake"

188
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,870
"Be supple like a willow before the wind"

189
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:46,956
What is this...?
"Twist and turn..."

190
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,036
The old man's showing me
his tricks... Well, here goes!

191
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,676
Show some mercy
for the poor beggar.

192
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,832
I bring the message of the Lord.
Only His words can save you.

193
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,679
Have mercy on me.

194
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,673
What's the idea of begging at this hour?

195
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,638
Get out of my sight!

196
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,156
That's one fierce lady.

197
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,958
Wretched sinner, ask for
God's forgiveness before it's too late.

198
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,272
just who do you think
you're calling a sinner?!

199
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,595
jesus Christ wants to save you.

200
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,070
Save me? You mean fool me!

201
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,393
Take that, and that! And be
more careful who you call a sinner!

202
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,632
Thanks, lady. You're very kind.

203
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,793
Believe in God and eternal life,
for this is His gift to man.

204
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,439
- Anyone home?
- Why call so early?

205
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,277
jesus Christ died for us, so that
we might experience heavenly joy.

206
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,833
Come in if you want joy! My girls
specialise in bringing it to you!

207
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,319
BROTHEL

208
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:38,753
Don't be shy, come in!
Chun-hua, Chun-yuen! Foreign meat!

209
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,753
You sinners, you'll all go to hell!

210
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,870
Anyone here?

211
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,552
Leaving already?

212
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,109
- Are you looking for Chao Chi-chih?
- Who? I'm looking for food.

213
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,752
What a sad sight you are.

214
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,876
Let me end your misery!

215
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,078
You want to flee, Pai Chang-tien?

216
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,758
Renounce violence!

217
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,270
That's right!

218
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,669
Good!

219
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,832
- Marvellous!
- Your hand should be straight.

220
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,673
- Ah-Kuei!
- Father!

221
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,598
Finished work for the day?

222
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,636
Please sit, sit...

223
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,156
I've come to check on
Ah-Kuei's progress.

224
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,872
You son is a genius,
and he studies extremely hard.

225
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,239
He has good muscles,
fine posture and rock-hard fists.

226
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,710
He has a very bright future before him!

227
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,390
Is this true?

228
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,996
- Have you fought with others yet?
- No, I haven't.

229
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,359
You want to fight?
That's easily arranged.

230
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,830
Chien-fu, come here.

231
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,558
Chien-fu, let's see what
the young master is made of.

232
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,837
You know what I expect.

233
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,870
Young master, don't hit too hard.

234
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,152
Begin!

235
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,312
- Your son fights marvellously.
- So it seems!

236
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,837
Come on!

237
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,869
- Stand still, damn it!
- You have to be faster!

238
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,039
You've asked for it!
My dragon-tiger fist!

239
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,432
Lord in heaven!
Magistrate, are you hurt?

240
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,954
Here's a new move for the great guru
to teach his students.

241
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,154
Ah-kuei, let's get out of here
and go to Wei-wu School.

242
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,795
Magistrate, please!
just allow me to explain...

243
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:54,315
Well, smart guy, you've succeeded
in ruining my reputation.

244
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,317
Now, get out of my sight!

245
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,639
Old man!

246
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,714
- Old man, what happened?
- I was ambushed...

247
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,593
I... I must get help.

248
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,195
Chien-fu... just find a safe place
for me to rest.

249
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,752
Old man... Old man!

250
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,798
PHARMACY

251
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,957
Old man...

252
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,399
Boss!

253
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,189
Chao Chi-chih has been living here.

254
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,070
- How long since he left?
- A month.

255
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,559
Pai Chang-tien is wounded,
he'll seek out Chao Chi-chih.

256
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:21,318
He's bound to leave a trail.
It is your task to discover it.

257
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,633
The picture is ancient,
but the words are new.

258
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,468
The man you seek
awaits you in heaven.

259
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,830
You're awake.

260
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,955
How are you feeling now?

261
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,634
I'll be alright.

262
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,157
That's good news,
I've been very worried about you.

263
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,515
I'll get your medicine.

264
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,073
Drink this, it will give you strength.

265
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,673
Chien-fu, I am indebted to you.

266
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,196
It's nothing. We're friends, aren't we?

267
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,876
And you taught me
how to avoid being hit.

268
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,475
- Well, has it proved useful?
- Yes...

269
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,075
But I irritated Mr. Li and he beat me.

270
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:12,437
- Do you want to learn kung fu?
- Yes, then no one can victimise me.

271
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,229
You must promise me three things.

272
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,590
I'll gladly keep a hundred promises.

273
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,836
Firstly, you must never
refer to me as your master.

274
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,118
- Why not?
- Because we're good friends.

275
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:35,151
Secondly, don't reveal what you've
learnt, unless conflict is unavoidable.

276
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,231
Okay, and third?

277
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,838
Promise that you will not come
to my aid if I fight with my enemies.

278
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,708
How can I promise not to help
if you are losing?!

279
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,156
You must promise me this.

280
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,073
Okay, I promise.

281
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,550
- What will you teach me?
- The Snake's Fist.

282
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:59,150
Shabby cat,
are you missing your master?

283
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,791
You must eat or you'll waste away.

284
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,479
So, smart guy, you want to take me on?

285
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,880
You're becoming crafty.

286
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,996
You're slipping.

287
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:10,119
- Mr. Li, be careful.
- I'm always careful.

288
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,359
- Son of a bitch!
- I said take care.

289
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,237
- Are you hurt?
- Damn it!

290
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,596
Are you here looking for trouble?

291
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,709
I've won the Three
Provinces Championship.

292
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,034
Every kung fu school has
congratulated me, except yours.

293
00:57:05,157 --> 00:57:05,240
“flu-w

294
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,710
- You need to learn respect.
- You're challenging us?

295
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,837
Yes! Who's first?

296
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,630
You're too sure of yourself,
my friend. Therefore, I...

297
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,111
- Yes, he...
- ...nominate my pupil.

298
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,077
You're in big trouble!

299
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,914
- Mr. Li, I defer to you.
- Not at all.

300
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,072
You must have this privilege.

301
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:38,395
I can't deny you this golden opportunity,
you lucky fellow. Go right ahead.

302
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,679
- Please, Master Li, after you...
- No, no, after you...

303
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,591
Shut up! I'll take on both of you at once.

304
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,355
- You go high, I'll go low.
- We'll attack front and back.

305
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,278
He's trapped now!

306
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,599
That was a textbook attack!

307
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,709
My braid!

308
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,148
- I won't use my hands.
- That's more like it!

309
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:18,113
The champion is fantastic.
Let's join Hung-wei School!

310
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,028
Go somewhere else. We're closed...

311
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,039
Master Hung... Master Hung!

312
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,797
Hung, why aren't you
giving classes to your pupils?

313
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,751
If you've nothing to do,
you can be my assistant!

314
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,430
I came here to fight.

315
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,110
Master Hung, no one forced
your students to join my school.

316
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:52,033
You took advantage of my absence
and stole my students.

317
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:56,716
- You can't deny it.
- The boys study where they please.

318
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,915
Then we will settle this by combat.

319
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,233
So, that's it? Well,
I fancy my chances against you.

320
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,395
Chien-fu, stand aside.

321
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:02,111
You posture like a hero,
but you fight like a dog!

322
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,076
Master!

323
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,950
Remain where you are.

324
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,674
My brother's coming!

325
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,869
Master Hung, as I caused
this dispute, I will settle it.

326
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:28,114
- Be careful, he's very powerful.
- Get back.

327
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,518
- You're the so-called champion?
- I have that honour.

328
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:09,795
Under no circumstances
use the snake's fist that I taught you.

329
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,438
Master!

330
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,279
- That's enough, okay?
- You clearly have a death wish.

331
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,397
Don't come closer! I won't fight...

332
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,551
This is for throwing shoes...

333
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,038
- Get up!
- That's enough, okay?

334
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,959
So, you're not a total novice....

335
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,599
- What stance is that?
- This is the "angry mantis"!

336
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,919
Mantis, beware the snake!

337
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,438
"Mantis catches a cicada".

338
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,195
"Reverse snake".

339
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,592
- Chien-fu...
- Stay back!

340
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,588
Looks like Chien-fu just got angry!

341
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,278
I said I don't want to fight.

342
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,269
You can't move now?

343
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:35,792
Your kung fu is quite good,
but a little unreliable.

344
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:40,351
All that waving your arms...
You use bricks now?

345
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,556
- Why use a weapon?
- To impale a snake!

346
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,989
A snake with fangs!

347
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,319
This is "finding a snake".

348
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,391
Master, let's go.

349
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,555
Well done, Chien-fu!
Let's rejoin Hung-tai.

350
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:06,268
Chien-fu, I have had to leave
at very short notice.

351
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,996
Study this book on Snake's Fist
kung fu, until my return.

352
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,399
He's gone...

353
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,832
Old man!

354
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,752
Old man!

355
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,554
Where have you gone?

356
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,354
Who are you?

357
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,680
- Were you looking for the old man?
- I... Yes.

358
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:03,269
- I'm looking for him, too.
- Why do you want him?

359
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,876
- Who are you?
- What's it to you?

360
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,714
He's my mas...

361
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,758
So, he's your master?

362
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:21,038
Then you should call me uncle.

363
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,432
- You're the brother of old man?
- Yes!

364
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,274
- I don't believe it!
- You don't believe...

365
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,954
"Standing snake."

366
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:36,750
- "Snake at the front."
- just like my mas...

367
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,071
It looks right, but I'm not convinced.

368
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:43,789
You still don't believe me?

369
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,874
- Very well, let's fight.
- Fight? Why not?

370
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,239
Uncle, take it easy! I'm choking...

371
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:32,792
You've practised hard,
but not hard enough.

372
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,748
Stay down,
or I'll convince you some more.

373
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,718
You think so? Watch out!

374
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:43,193
- What else can you do?
- I can roll!

375
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,996
I writhe!

376
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,075
You missed me.

377
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:46,112
I've been using kid gloves with you,
but now they're off!

378
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,071
"Finding the snake."

379
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,475
This snake is too fast.

380
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,154
"Snake taking a pearl."
That's too obvious.

381
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,712
Un... cle... it... hurts.

382
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,550
- Are you okay?
- Uncle...

383
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:40,272
- Did you pull your punches?
- Of course. After all, I'm your uncle.

384
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,751
Your attacks seem different
to my master's.

385
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:48,435
That's because your master
didn't teach you everything.

386
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,831
Will you teach me?

387
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,232
I must have your master's
permission. Where is he?

388
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,952
- He just left.
- Left?

389
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,715
- Where has he gone?
- I don't know, but he'll be back.

390
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,713
- When will he return?
- He didn't tell me.

391
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,349
But I'll inform you when he does.

392
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,915
Good! But don't let him know
that I'm looking for him.

393
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,794
- I want to give him a surprise.
- Okay.

394
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:34,711
Why does uncle
fight so differently to my master?

395
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,349
Where's the book?

396
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,551
It must have been the cat.

397
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,151
Catch it!

398
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:26,478
Your claws are very fierce, cat!

399
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,674
Cat's claw with snake's fist!

400
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,591
Chao Chi-chih!

401
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:49,110
So, old man,
Shangkuan has snared you both!

402
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:57,554
Yes, Chao was in the hills, near
heaven. But heaven is still far away.

403
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:00,279
The two of you can rot here.

404
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:11,159
Hsiao chin, you must be dreaming
if you think I die so easily!

405
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,912
The weather is cool,
I don't need fanning.

406
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,432
Hold that pose...

407
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,351
Old man!

408
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,876
- Where were you?
- I had urgent business.

409
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,317
- I missed you. Why take so long?
- I missed you too.

410
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:52,314
- Chien-fu, the tea's ready!
- Coming.

411
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,870
Ah... thanks!

412
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,757
It's hot!

413
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,431
A man came looking for you
after you'd left.

414
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,512
- Who was he?
- You'd recognise him.

415
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,957
I'd recognise him? Who was it?

416
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,589
You sit here, I'll tell you later.

417
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:53,237
Uncle, the old man's back.
I'll take you to him!

418
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:01,995
Hurry! It's not far...
I haven't told him about you.

419
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,672
This way!

420
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,189
Hey, wait for me!

421
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,191
Preacher?

422
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,840
What did you call me?

423
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,595
I follow the Eagle's Claw, not God.

424
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:10,276
What are you saying?
I don't understand.

425
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:15,070
We will wipe the Snake's Fist
from the face of the Earth.

426
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:22,708
And the man you call uncle
is our leader. He has fooled you.

427
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,791
You really are scum!

428
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,115
I almost lost my feet!

429
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,399
Pai Chang-tien,
running any further is futile!

430
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,797
Shangkuan...

431
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:55,716
Are you so sure that the eagle
will always triumph over the snake?

432
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:04,430
Today marks the end of the war
between the eagle and the snake...

433
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,034
The end of the Snake's Fist!

434
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:13,719
I will oppose you with the last breath
in my body. I do not fear death!

435
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:18,517
Then allow me to take your life!

436
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,469
"The eagle swoops."

437
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,748
I'll rip out your heart!

438
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,839
Pai Chang-tien,
time for the snake to shed its skin!

439
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,158
A stone to sharpen your claws on!

440
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:55,555
It was dishonourable
to pretend to be my uncle -

441
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:59,599
- so that you could trick me
into leading you to him.

442
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:05,074
You've got guts, hero...
I'll tear them from your body!

443
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:10,837
You can't hurt him. I swear to you
he isn't my student.

444
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:16,153
Even if he disowns me,
I am proud to call him my master!

445
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,754
You follow the way of the snake.

446
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:24,710
All who wield the Snake's Fist
will be hunted down and slaughtered.

447
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:29,477
Slaughtered...
Master, he's dreaming!

448
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:33,235
Chien-fu, you can't beat him. Run!

449
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:37,711
Master, do you expect me
to flee from this wretch?!

450
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:44,429
It seems that to shut your lying mouth,
I'll have to remove your tongue.

451
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,792
And I'll shave your moustache!

452
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:20,430
- This isn't Snake's Fist... What is it?
- Cat's claw!

453
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,716
Chien-fu!

454
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,317
- What fighting prowess!
- Chang!

455
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,755
Why are you here?

456
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:38,676
- Where did you learn to fight like that?
- My master taught me!

457
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:42,469
Good... fantastic!

458
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,350
It's okay, your master's here!

459
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:55,998
Don't be so pleased with yourselves.

460
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,675
The tea that you drank was poisoned.

461
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,957
You're both going to die very soon.

462
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:15,960
No one can resist
Poison Eagle of Eagle's Claw.

463
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,635
Master never drinks hot tea.

464
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,349
I changed it!

465
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,160
Chien-fu, that was brilliant!

466
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:58,714
You combined Snake's Fist with
cat's claw to destroy the Eagle's Claw.

467
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:02,992
Such an elegant solution
deserves an elegant name.

468
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:07,396
- Master, you name it.
- How about...

469
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:10,996
- "Snake in the eagle's shadow."
- "Snake in the eagle's shadow" it is!
