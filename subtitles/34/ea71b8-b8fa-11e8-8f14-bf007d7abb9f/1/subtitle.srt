Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

355

- Oh, hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

356
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,942
It's got everything. It's got sex,
violence, the ethnic angle--

357
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,569
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

- Oh, sure, Mr. White.

- Oh, I'm sorry.

370

379

Lois, Clark Kent may seem like just
a mild-mannered reporter, but listen...

380
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,847
...not only does he know how to treat
his editor in chief with respect...

381
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,558
...not only does he have a snappy,
punchy prose style...

382
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,645
...but he is, in my 40 years in this
business, the fastest typist I've seen.

383

you could arrange for half my salary...

389
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:27,583
Don't tell me, he sends a check every
