1
00:00:00,077 --> 00:00:01,009
Follow.

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:05,972
But you should show us the money.

3
00:00:06,683 --> 00:00:07,741
Where is the change?

4
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:09,245
Change?

5
00:00:09,453 --> 00:00:10,784
Hey, over there...

6
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:13,488
I'll go and take the money, sit here.

7
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:17,556
Honey, give me few millions.

8
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:19,958
We have separate account, you know?

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,193
But you have 30 million cash
put inside the house.

10
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:24,658
I have forgot where it is.

11
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:27,160
You will remember, you're smart.

12
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:29,132
What should I do?

13
00:00:30,807 --> 00:00:31,796
Get rid of this.

14
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:33,334
You mean it?

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,772
You should trust me.

16
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:36,405
Nine circles.

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,842
- Bingo!
- Me too.

18
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:39,242
Me too.

19
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:44,580
Damn you!

20
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:46,454
Where is Officer Lai?

21
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:47,988
He is having fun inside the CID room.

22
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:55,991
You bastard!

23
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:00,100
I want to discuss something
important with you.

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,794
Can't you see I am busy at beating others?

25
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:04,031
I want you to give me
2 million for gambling.

26
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:06,072
Are you kidding?

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,834
How dare you counter attack?

28
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:12,515
You should give me 2 million.

29
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,377
How can I get 2 million for you?

30
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:16,712
Taior comes for gambling,

31
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:17,854
if I've no money,
our secret will be disclosed.

32
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:20,251
Then we will be in deep shit! Hurry up.

33
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,548
Hands off me.

34
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:22,919
If only you promised me.

35
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:28,790
Where have you gone?

36
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:30,924
I am sorry, I went to get some money.

37
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:32,758
The money is not well kept.

38
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:34,095
I put it inside the maid's room
which is in Yuen Long.

39
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:35,636
Cut the crap, we are waiting for you.

40
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:36,636
The cards please.

41
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:37,739
Deal now.

42
00:01:37,908 --> 00:01:38,875
A pair of 8, it's your turn to call.

43
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:40,475
I want to show...

44
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:42,105
Hold it, just to tempt them.

45
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:44,770
Nothing special, just $200,000.

46
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:46,343
$200,000?

47
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:47,781
I want to raise it to a million.

48
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:49,282
I will follow you!

49
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:57,553
3 eights.

50
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:59,126
No hesitation, just show hand.

51
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,853
How about the newspaper?

52
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,088
Show it too.

53
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:03,192
3 eights?

54
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,866
Shit, it's not much!

55
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:06,161
Follow!

56
00:02:09,806 --> 00:02:10,773
I quit.

57
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:13,606
I have 3 Aces.

58
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:15,267
I don't believe that you've got 4 eights.

59
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,208
Don't be that nervous.

60
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:19,507
Don't cry, pal!

61
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:20,874
4 eights.

62
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:27,454
Why? I have had an eight!

63
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:29,219
You mean the game before you left?

64
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:30,188
Sure it is.

65
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,827
But we have played many rounds after that.

66
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:33,053
Why don't you tell me?

67
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,026
You didn't ask!

68
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:35,323
I...

69
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:39,595
You are back? Win or lose?

70
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,202
You can tell from my head.

71
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:43,395
A great loser.
You said you are the King of Gambling.

72
00:02:43,573 --> 00:02:44,870
I didn't mention it.

73
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:46,473
I have mentioned it.

74
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:48,274
What'll we do now?

75
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:50,174
Give me 1 more million to gamble again.

76
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:52,144
I will show them my real power.

77
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:53,543
You want 1 million more?

78
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:55,617
What I gave you was the money

79
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:56,979
from the bailing account.

80
00:02:57,153 --> 00:02:58,279
Now, we are asked to return the money.

81
00:02:58,455 --> 00:02:59,922
If you don't give us back the money.

82
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,352
You should be in fugitive!

83
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:03,515
Please lend me money for the tickets.

84
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,022
You...

85
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:06,560
- Give us one million more.
- You idiot!

86
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,958
Or we'll be in deep shit!

87
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,128
What would you do if you lose that again?

88
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:13,202
Anyway, let's take risk.

89
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,999
Why do you beat me?
I am making a living only.

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,771
Whom are you hitting?

91
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:20,239
A racketeer.

92
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:22,745
Why don't you respect
such decent professionals?

93
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:24,807
He cheated $2.

94
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,409
Who is cheated by him?

95
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,845
It's me.

96
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:28,743
How can you cheat a beggar?

97
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,408
Beat him to death!

98
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:30,450
Beat him to death!

99
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:37,753
What? The greatest enemy of
the Saint of Gambling: Master Hung!

100
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:39,417
Hello, how are you?

101
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:41,120
I am in deep shit! I lost much money.

102
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:43,198
Pal, ask them not to beat me.

103
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,766
I will teach you how to cheat
on the gambling table.

104
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:48,129
But, show me something first.

105
00:03:58,515 --> 00:04:00,346
Kidding! Where has he gone?

106
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:03,245
We have finished 16 rounds,

107
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,614
he hasn't returned!

108
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:06,849
He is back!

109
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:08,752
Hey, my dear audience...

110
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:31,039
He looks smart!

111
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:43,892
He looks familiar.

112
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:45,992
Who are you acting?

113
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:48,822
Guess.

114
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:13,181
I know!

115
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,288
The Saint of Gambling.

116
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:15,424
Wrong.

117
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,449
I am acting as David Copperfield.

118
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:20,921
Deal.

119
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:22,155
I have 3 Kings.

120
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:23,825
I have 3 Aces.

121
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:24,863
Straight flush.

122
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,434
A bigger one.

123
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:28,201
4 Aces.

124
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:29,929
5 Aces?!

125
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:46,511
What Master Hung taught you are powerful.

126
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:47,678
Win as much as you can.

127
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:48,987
I'd make use of this chance

128
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,389
to find out the truth of Wong's death.

129
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:54,394
One million.

130
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:55,724
I will follow

131
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:01,801
It's your turn, a pair of Aces.

132
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:04,201
You are silly,
it'd be the turn of straight flush.

133
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:05,431
Show hand.

134
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,671
I don't think you're David Copperfield,
I will follow.

135
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:15,348
I have 50 cents left.

136
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:17,112
5 million as credit, OK.

137
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,845
Forget the money,
I want you to answer me a question.

138
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:21,513
Then I will forget the money.

139
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:23,056
What question?

140
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:29,158
Have you ever thought of killing me?

141
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:34,435
Answer me.

142
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:39,701
- I...
- Answer me.

143
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,608
I want to quit!

144
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,346
Your question is nonsense.

145
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:50,179
- Let's go.
- Yes.

146
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:52,315
Just take the money.

147
00:06:54,057 --> 00:06:56,150
Have you found the truth of the case?

148
00:06:56,826 --> 00:06:58,191
The truth is...

149
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:01,025
I had a four only, but the idiot quitted.

150
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,457
Boss, are you alright?

151
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:05,701
Are you hurt?

152
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:08,571
Give me back the money.

153
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:09,939
Just return the loan.

154
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:11,835
We needn't give you a share
of the money we won!

155
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,404
But you should give interest.

156
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:17,943
OK, just follow the bank's rule.

157
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:20,847
Cheap interest rate, 2.75%.

158
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:24,285
$2 million is divided by 365.

159
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:27,348
Just $25 is charged, keep the change.

160
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:28,954
Take one more.

161
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,386
You'd have done that earlier.

162
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:40,100
Any progress?

163
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:44,266
I have found that Judy Tong
was suspicious.

164
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,702
I think she is having a secret.

165
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:48,434
And that Taior Lam...

166
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:50,010
Don't look only at the surface.

167
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,709
When I was trained in Scotland,

168
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:55,778
I have studied all
the extraordinary precedents.

169
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,685
Including the murdering case
of the Eastern Express.

170
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,522
The murdering case of River Nile.

171
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:02,156
The murdering case from Fatal Attraction.

172
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,450
And the hidden corpse under the stove.

173
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:07,087
I have found out a principle.

174
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:08,195
What is it?

175
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,628
The most suspicious criminal
is not the real murderer.

176
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:11,860
Shit!

177
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:13,662
I agree! It always

178
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:15,235
happens in movies.

179
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:16,667
You can put it

180
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,433
in that way,

181
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:22,768
the murderer may or may
not know the victim.

182
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:25,744
He or she has the inclination
of violence acting.

183
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:29,516
Maybe a money digger,
or is greedy for money.

184
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:31,779
As what you have said,
the murderer may be you.

185
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:33,286
Man, arrest him.

186
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:34,480
Yes sir.

187
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:36,852
Are you crazy?

188
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:38,357
Sorry sir.

189
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:39,858
It's just theory.

190
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,291
By the way,

191
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:43,557
you can't get any clue
from Judy Tong's home.

192
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,098
See whether there're any conflicts
between Wong & Taior in office.

193
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:48,703
May be they have had quarrel
in business which made him kill.

194
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:51,430
You said the most suspicious
one isn't the murderer.

195
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,541
It's bull shit,
why don't you go and check now?

196
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,237
Let me finish the most
important thing first, OK?

197
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:21,030
Love you 360 years.

198
00:09:23,373 --> 00:09:25,500
Damn it, you just forget about me!

199
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:33,974
Thank you!

200
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,558
Bitch and bastard.

201
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:47,195
Bitch and bastard.

202
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,196
I wanna kill!

203
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:54,825
Knife?

204
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:01,173
Shit!

205
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:06,771
The door!

206
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:20,821
Taking a seat.

207
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:26,727
Thank you for your flowers.

208
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:28,061
The one who wears the patterned socks.

209
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:31,031
I have boyfriend, you know that.

210
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,135
Although he is poor and selfish...

211
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,039
He is mean and old fashioned.

212
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:37,440
She doesn't mean it.

213
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:39,614
But he is my boyfriend.

214
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:41,306
I can't accept you.

215
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:45,552
Don't...

216
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:49,283
Don't!

217
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:52,253
I will kill you bastard!

218
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:53,893
It's you!

219
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:54,995
It's you!

220
00:10:55,164 --> 00:10:56,392
It's you?

221
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:00,333
Actually, I mean...

222
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:02,198
I want to kill you!

223
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:03,766
Stop it!

224
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,872
What are you holding the knife for?

225
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:05,871
Drop it first.

226
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,509
Hold it, listen to me first.

227
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,234
I have tailed you for a long time.

228
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:10,845
You come to look for this bitch!

229
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:11,877
Me?

230
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:14,039
Why are you still asking?

231
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:18,815
How dare you seduce my wife?

232
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:19,783
I am asking you!

233
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:21,514
Whom do you love?

234
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,281
It's just for fun.

235
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,559
Just for fun.

236
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:26,490
You are played by others.

237
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:28,960
You are bitch, and you are bitch too!

238
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:29,962
You bring me bad luck!

239
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,157
You want money, isn't it?

240
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:32,494
OK, it's just money!

241
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,260
Come on...

242
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,698
Hey, money!

243
00:11:37,874 --> 00:11:39,933
What? You are paid,
why don't you leave now?

244
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:41,337
You two...

245
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:43,035
OK, I am leaving!

246
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:44,873
Ah Man...

247
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:46,412
This is your home,
where are you going to?

248
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,982
Yes, this is my home!

249
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:51,017
You two, leave here at once.

250
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:52,351
Leave!

251
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:53,989
Man, don't get angry, listen to me.

252
00:11:54,157 --> 00:11:55,988
Wait for me downstairs.

253
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:58,022
I will give this bitch a good lesson.

254
00:11:58,194 --> 00:11:59,388
Go, what do you want?

255
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:00,824
I won't give it a damn.

256
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:02,762
I warn you seriously!

257
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:04,490
Never see my wife again.

258
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,363
Or I will beat you! Got it?

259
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:10,529
She has gone, why do you keep on acting?

260
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,737
Don't you feel it funny?

261
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:14,240
We should act!

262
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,843
Don't you think my acting was good?

263
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:16,979
Poor!

264
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:19,580
Kidding? I got a prize in drama acting!

265
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:21,182
But you acted poorly.

266
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,282
How could you be

267
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:24,215
courted by that woman?

268
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:28,155
She is nice and she always
buys flowers from me.

269
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:30,087
So I date with her when I'm free.

270
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:33,194
I can't tell she is a lesbian!

271
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:35,086
I can't tell it's her!

272
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:37,492
She is waiting for you.

273
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:38,929
Why don't you go now?

274
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:40,266
Go!

275
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:41,528
I will accompany you

276
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:43,194
all day after this case, OK?

277
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,902
I have bought you something.

278
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:48,168
What is it?

279
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:49,174
Patterned socks.

280
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:50,573
Burn it.

281
00:12:58,354 --> 00:12:59,946
Mr. Wong, good morning.

282
00:13:00,556 --> 00:13:01,648
Good morning.

283
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,089
Mr. Wong, good morning,
Mrs. Wong is not around.

284
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:05,852
I know.

285
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:06,790
There is an electricity cut inside.

286
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:09,454
Never mind, I just want to
fetch a cup of water.

287
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:31,712
This is sent in this morning.

288
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:39,793
What's the matter?

289
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,293
Nothing, get out now.

290
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:43,795
There must be some problem with you.

291
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:45,866
Nothing to do with you!

292
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:47,393
Get lost.

293
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:56,208
Pay attention.

294
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:05,380
Don't light up with the lighter.

295
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:07,148
What does it mean?

296
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:16,828
It's brandy.

297
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:46,853
Boss.

298
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:52,263
Hello? Taior?

299
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:53,729
How is it?

300
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,369
How did you get my picture?

301
00:14:55,705 --> 00:14:57,104
By camera.

302
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,205
I have waited for this chance for ages.

303
00:14:58,374 --> 00:15:00,672
But I can't imagine
you have courted this one.

304
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:02,309
I think the gossip magazines

305
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:04,878
are interested in such pictures.

306
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:06,412
You bastard!

307
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:07,910
I don't mind.

308
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:10,780
What I want is money.

309
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,420
If you want the pictures back,

310
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:15,216
come to my office at 7 p.m.

311
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:16,619
What do you want?

312
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,427
Fire station, please.

313
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:26,997
What's the matter?

314
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:28,465
Here is Fire Station.

315
00:15:28,638 --> 00:15:30,105
Who is it?

316
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:33,197
Are there any raincoats for sale?

317
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:35,310
Go to buy it in department store, damn you!

318
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:36,877
Who are you scolding? Who are you?

319
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:37,808
You are so impolite!

320
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,878
Don't cut the line, hello...

321
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:40,811
Taior, you are going too far!

322
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,518
You will regret if you don't come.

323
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,144
Don't bother me from doing exercise,
see you at 7.

324
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:03,727
Mr. Wong, what are you doing?

325
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:05,737
Drinking, I have told you.

326
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:23,014
You stepped on my food,

327
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,422
pay it to me.

328
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:45,511
Miss, who are you looking for?

329
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:47,012
I have a date with Mr. Lam.

330
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:48,548
Follow me please.

331
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:54,849
Please come in.

332
00:16:56,592 --> 00:16:57,684
Please.

333
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:03,756
I am so happy to see you.

334
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,193
Give me the file of the 1st 6 months,

335
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,425
I won't listen to any call.

336
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:07,728
Yes.

337
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:11,464
Take a seat.

338
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:15,975
Cut the crap,

339
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:18,136
how much do you want for the pictures?

340
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:20,310
Don't misunderstand it.

341
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:23,642
I am not that rich!

342
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:26,116
But I won't be interested
in 10 or more billions.

343
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,821
Don't you think I want to blackmail you?

344
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:31,026
Give me a price.

345
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:34,895
It's not good to talk money
among good friends.

346
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:37,964
But I do want to give you money.

347
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,830
I have checked that your existing
husband is a fake one.

348
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:45,732
I can kill him for you, but you don't
have to take any responsibility.

349
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:49,935
And, I will give you 3 billion
for the land in Wanchai.

350
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:53,745
You bastard!
The land costs over 20 billions.

351
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:56,247
That's why I won't be interested
in only 10 billions.

352
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,181
I want 20 billions.

353
00:17:58,354 --> 00:17:59,480
Damn you!

354
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:01,418
Don't scold me with foul language.

355
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,581
Which will damage your image...

356
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,818
as a pretty lesbian.

357
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:10,024
Bastard!

358
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,092
- You!
- What?

359
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:14,798
Let's sign the contract 3 days later.

360
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,995
Or, I will send you pictures
to Portland Street.

361
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:18,765
And to the gossip magazines.

362
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:30,914
What are you looking?

363
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:31,643
Stealing?

364
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:33,516
No, there is a naked beauty.

365
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:34,856
I won't trust you.

366
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,489
Come and take a look.

367
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:39,754
I am afraid you'd attack me
if I go near you.

368
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:42,421
Even you don't go,
I can attack you too.

369
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:46,765
What's the matter?

370
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:48,631
I was attacked by a man
who is wearing a business suit.

371
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:50,032
Go and chase after him.

372
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,440
Have you seen a man wearing
a business suit?

373
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,102
This way.

374
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:58,673
Thief!

375
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,510
What kind of noise is it?

376
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:05,611
I don't think so.

377
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:07,619
I will break his neck if I see him again.

378
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,289
Go that way, I will watch over here.

379
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:19,568
Wol...

380
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:24,670
Wolf! Help!

381
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:26,997
This way.

382
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,909
I changed my job,
but why do you still bother me?

383
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:30,773
Arrest him!

384
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:32,140
Go, you bitch!

385
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:54,959
Give me back my teeth.

386
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:26,200
It's you! It's fashionable.

387
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:27,767
What is it?

388
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:31,972
Guess who wants to kill me?

389
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:33,540
Who is it?

390
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:36,377
Give me some hints.

391
00:20:42,718 --> 00:20:43,616
It's her?

392
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:18,016
How dare you!

393
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:19,245
You could be run over!

394
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:36,367
How dare you give me RMB notes?

395
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:37,766
Don't you think I am blind?

396
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:38,939
I will throw you to death!

397
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,178
Are you back?

398
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,890
Where have you been?

399
00:21:58,494 --> 00:21:59,791
I am asking you!

400
00:22:00,162 --> 00:22:01,959
I have been playing mahjong all night.

401
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:02,722
Where have I been?

402
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:04,229
Are you playing mahjong all night?

403
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:05,728
We played 16 rounds.

404
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,767
What's wrong with your husband?

405
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:10,203
There is something wrong with him.

406
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:13,769
You looked so weird, where have you been?

407
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:16,602
What is this?

408
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,105
It's blood!

409
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:21,749
Did you kill?

410
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:31,052
What's wrong with you?

411
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:36,294
I am making fun with you only.

412
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:38,796
The day after tomorrow will be
the 7th anniversary of us.

413
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,298
I want to hold a party to celebrate it.

414
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:41,868
Do you agree?

415
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:45,735
Don't be angry.

416
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,401
Let me give you a kiss.

417
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:14,729
You scared me.

418
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:17,538
Officer Lai, help yourself.

419
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:33,520
Do you know Lam was killed?

420
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:35,912
I do.

421
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:37,556
I am going to die, do you know that?

422
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:39,018
Yes, I do.

423
00:23:39,194 --> 00:23:41,355
If you can't get the murderer,
you'll die too.

424
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:44,156
I am quite confident
to point out the murderer.

425
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,598
Who is it?

426
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:48,600
Don't be anxious,
my 7th sense tells me that...

427
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,362
there will be a result tonight.

428
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:55,275
The real murderer will show up tonight.

429
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,215
- Don't move.
- Put your hands on you head.

430
00:24:04,686 --> 00:24:05,948
It's you!

431
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:08,580
Mr. Wong, I have something to talk to you.

432
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,449
I know what to do...

433
00:24:12,628 --> 00:24:14,619
I am sorry, please go over there.

434
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:16,457
Thank you for your co-operation.

435
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:17,730
Please go over there.

436
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,098
You may talk now.

437
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,294
In fact, I want you to leave alone.

438
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,972
You should tell me earlier,
it cut my pride, you know?

439
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,243
Mr. Wong, take care of Judy.

440
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:34,581
What's wrong with her?

441
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,241
It's none of her business,
nothing to do with her.

442
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:38,511
Tell me clearly.

443
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,154
I can't help telling you now.

444
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:41,846
In fact she...

445
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:43,582
Be frank, tell me!

446
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:46,124
Right, be frank and speak up.

447
00:24:48,397 --> 00:24:49,295
I love this music.

448
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:51,056
Dance with me, come on.

449
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:00,706
Mr. Wong.

450
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:14,778
We hold party every year,
but this is the happiest one.

451
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:16,313
How do you feel?

452
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:19,793
Your feeling is most important.

453
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:22,653
It seems that you are not very happy.

454
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:25,059
What do you think?

455
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:31,500
There must be some reasons
for one to do something.

456
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,800
But I think, anybody do anything...

457
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:38,941
There must be karma.

458
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,883
What's the reason of killing somebody?

459
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,717
Tell me, Judy!

460
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,332
Why don't you talk?

461
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:08,540
I am thinking that,
if you were Million Wong...

462
00:26:09,011 --> 00:26:10,342
that would be very good.

463
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,611
You know I am fake?

464
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:16,143
I knew it on the first day I met you.

465
00:26:16,752 --> 00:26:18,219
You haven't answered my question.

466
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:21,951
Don't make me dislike you.

467
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:27,584
Million and I were not living
happily in these years.

468
00:26:29,564 --> 00:26:30,758
In these days,

469
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:34,261
you recalled the sweet memory of ours.

470
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:37,899
We were poor in those days.

471
00:26:38,707 --> 00:26:40,106
But, our love was true.

472
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:43,074
When he got rich,

473
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:45,875
he loved fooling around.

474
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:48,508
And I...

475
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:50,882
I changed emotionally.

476
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:53,820
I hate being woman.

477
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,355
I want to be man.

478
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,384
To be a man whom can compete
with him for woman.

479
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,327
But when you came here,

480
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:06,230
you made me feel like woman again.

481
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,273
I don't want to know who you are.

482
00:27:15,077 --> 00:27:16,738
I just want tonight...

483
00:27:17,813 --> 00:27:21,840
can you play your
role whole-heartly tonight?

484
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:29,013
Hubby.

485
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:35,053
I want you to accompany me tonight.

486
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:38,095
Will you promise me?

487
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:08,657
I want some make up.

488
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:29,381
You haven't finished.

489
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,813
Who are you suspecting to be the murderer?

490
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:32,777
I suspect it's Judy.

491
00:28:32,954 --> 00:28:34,216
How come?

492
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:36,550
I was in the scene when Taior was killed.

493
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:38,089
I tailed Judy to the scene.

494
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,386
Although I didn't see her kill,

495
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:41,290
there wasn't anybody around.

496
00:28:41,463 --> 00:28:42,794
Why don't you tell me earlier?

497
00:28:42,964 --> 00:28:44,192
Go ahead.

498
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:45,298
I don't know why!

499
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:46,331
Are you kidding?

500
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:47,661
Hold it, listen to me first.

501
00:28:47,836 --> 00:28:48,700
Even Judy did kill Taior,

502
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,132
I am sure she had her reason.

503
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:51,169
What reason?

504
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:52,397
She was the murderer!

505
00:28:52,574 --> 00:28:53,700
But you are a cop.

506
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,172
Don't treat her as your wife.

507
00:28:55,343 --> 00:28:57,174
Mr. Wong, long time no see.

508
00:28:57,345 --> 00:28:58,107
Good morning...

509
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,872
I won't bother you, see you.

510
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:04,009
Tell me the rest that you know.

511
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,651
I think the murderer will kill again.

512
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:07,844
What?

513
00:29:08,023 --> 00:29:09,718
To kill those who know the secret.

514
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:11,283
Luckily I don't know any secret.

515
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,324
You know it now.

516
00:29:12,494 --> 00:29:13,324
I know it too.

517
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:14,189
There is another one who know this...

518
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:15,056
Miss Ching!

519
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,162
Why don't you inform her now?

520
00:29:16,331 --> 00:29:17,798
I will arrest her by all means.

521
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:18,955
Go now.

522
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,936
It's me.

523
00:29:30,178 --> 00:29:30,803
You scared me.

524
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:31,638
Don't do that.

525
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:32,837
This is the most wonderful idea.

526
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:33,844
I have had masked.

527
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:35,880
The real murderer would be fainted
once he looks at me.

528
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:37,382
I will arrest him right away.

529
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:39,310
Let me put on the mask.

530
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:41,954
Hello!

531
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,456
- What's wrong with this?
- You scared everyone!

532
00:29:45,694 --> 00:29:46,991
They have seen the newspaper
about the death of Taior, you idiot!

533
00:29:47,462 --> 00:29:48,326
What'll we do now?

534
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:49,429
Go up to Judy's room and watch.

535
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:50,656
You will get something! I am sure.

536
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:51,662
You mean reward?

537
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:53,122
Where is my gun?

538
00:29:53,535 --> 00:29:54,297
To do such dangerous thing,

539
00:29:54,469 --> 00:29:55,163
you asked me to return your gun?

540
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:56,463
Don't you think I am idiot?

541
00:30:01,743 --> 00:30:03,643
We should take revenge for Brother Taior.

542
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:06,872
He was killed by the Million Wong
and his wife obviously.

543
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,783
You should be careful!

544
00:30:10,485 --> 00:30:11,452
Don't worry.

545
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:16,489
Please.

546
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:17,622
Please.

547
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:50,390
You have another boyfriend.

548
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:51,487
Don't come to me again.

549
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,718
It's a misunderstanding.

550
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:05,504
Maybe, this is a modern dance.

551
00:31:05,674 --> 00:31:06,698
Let's follow them.

552
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,541
Miss, may I?

553
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:18,841
Come here.

554
00:31:19,387 --> 00:31:20,979
Miss Ching, it's very dangerous.

555
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,683
You are the wolf!

556
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:26,658
I changed many jobs because of you.

557
00:31:26,828 --> 00:31:28,853
And I can't escape from you in this party!

558
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:31,488
This is fate!

559
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,031
OK, come and rape me.

560
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:34,293
It's a misunderstanding.

561
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:37,630
Come on... Just once,
never bother me again.

562
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:39,103
Come and rape me.

563
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:40,241
Damn it!

564
00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:46,338
The victim died so horribly!

565
00:31:46,581 --> 00:31:48,606
Isn't it a heart attack?

566
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:50,609
What?

567
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:52,047
A person was shot dead by an arrow.

568
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:55,613
That's him.

569
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,721
Don't move, the cops are coming.

570
00:31:59,227 --> 00:32:00,717
I watched Judy Tong upstairs.

571
00:32:00,895 --> 00:32:02,419
She hasn't left her room.

572
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:08,224
We are trapped.

573
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:26,583
I don't want to be controlled.

574
00:32:26,855 --> 00:32:28,049
I want to go my own way.

575
00:32:28,456 --> 00:32:30,151
Judy, there won't be any good to you.

576
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:31,314
Don't bother me.

577
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:32,551
Judy

578
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:34,786
Leave now, I don't want to see you.

579
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:48,302
It's you!

580
00:32:49,477 --> 00:32:52,105
I have picked the killing weapon
and I want to hand it to you.

581
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,508
You should not hit so heavily!

582
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:01,214
Don't move!

583
00:33:07,062 --> 00:33:07,790
Judy!

584
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:09,361
Don't get mad.

585
00:33:09,931 --> 00:33:11,330
I know you are the murderer.

586
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,691
Yes, I did all the cases.

587
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:22,736
Take back the gun.

588
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,803
Good job, you must be promoted.

589
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:25,809
How?

590
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,878
What do you think?

591
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:28,447
Let's calculate the salary first.

592
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:29,810
OK, just go ahead.

593
00:33:29,984 --> 00:33:30,882
Go!

594
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,486
Give way please.

595
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:47,331
I am leaving, hubby.

596
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:35,375
What are you doing?

597
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:40,244
Do you know what had happened?

598
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:42,078
What happened?

599
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,219
The murderer is arrested.

600
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:45,859
I see, who is the murderer?

601
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:47,392
The murderer is...

602
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:48,551
Judy.

603
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,925
Before taking her away,
you showed great affection to each other.

604
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:52,929
She kissed your left armpit.

605
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:55,001
I know it, my cousin told me that.

606
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:58,404
It's totally wrong.

607
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:01,169
Totally wrong!

608
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:02,340
How dare you deny?

609
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,408
I won't!

610
00:35:03,578 --> 00:35:05,045
But, she didn't kiss my left armpit.

611
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:06,680
Where did she kiss?

612
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,978
Ah Man, trust me, I love you only.

613
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,852
I am willing to take
any punishment you offered.

614
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:16,318
Come on, punish me.

615
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:18,152
Come on...

616
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:19,953
I won't punish you.

617
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:22,594
Well, then I will punish you.

618
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:28,899
You are bad.

619
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,196
You hit me?

620
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:34,940
Come on.

621
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:45,052
Where did you get this?

622
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,778
You said you are willing
to be punished by me.

623
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:48,684
Isn't it alright?

624
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:05,736
Are you scared?

625
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:09,267
I am really scared.

626
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,637
Are you willing to be kissed by others?

627
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,142
Dare you?

628
00:36:21,322 --> 00:36:24,849
Loose me first.

629
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:32,466
What are you doing?

630
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:33,828
Bathing.

631
00:36:50,118 --> 00:36:53,679
Let's not waste any time.

632
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,886
Honey, come on over.

633
00:37:00,628 --> 00:37:02,493
It's jammed.

634
00:37:03,298 --> 00:37:04,322
Punish me.

635
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:09,935
Come on! Baby! Come on...

636
00:37:15,076 --> 00:37:16,134
It's you!

637
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:17,570
You are nosy!

638
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:19,640
Ah Man! Ah Man.

639
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:21,213
You dragged Judy down.

640
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:23,407
What? Repeat once more.

641
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,881
I want to take revenge for Judy.

642
00:37:25,153 --> 00:37:27,587
I can't hear clearly, repeat once more.

643
00:37:27,822 --> 00:37:29,722
I want to take revenge for Judy.

644
00:37:29,891 --> 00:37:31,449
Can you repeat again?
I can't hear clearly.

645
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:32,490
Are you fooling me?

646
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:41,325
Do you want peeping?

647
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:43,931
Watch out!

648
00:37:44,105 --> 00:37:45,800
How dare you!

649
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,577
I wanna kill you!

650
00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:05,791
Damn it, how dare you stab me like this?

651
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,552
Do you mean it?

652
00:38:08,596 --> 00:38:10,928
It's not stabbing, I am going to open you!

653
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:20,133
What are you staring?

654
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:21,873
I want to kill you!

655
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:26,771
Please don't!

656
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:28,742
None of my business.

657
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:31,083
I know!

658
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:48,466
You are over, it's my turn now.

659
00:38:51,406 --> 00:38:52,634
Not exactly!

660
00:38:56,677 --> 00:38:57,735
Thank you.

661
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:16,059
Don't you think I am useless.

662
00:39:18,299 --> 00:39:20,130
I am cramping.

663
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:24,898
These are the dirty pictures of

664
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:27,064
Judy and Ching.

665
00:39:35,116 --> 00:39:37,243
Ching is not only a lesbian.

666
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:38,952
She is insane too.

667
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,810
She has an inclination of violence acting.

668
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:43,156
She wants to kill those who loves Judy

669
00:39:43,324 --> 00:39:45,053
and those who harms Judy.

670
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,758
So she killed Million Wong first.

671
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:48,187
Then she killed Taior Lam.

672
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:50,487
Judy confessed the situation of that night.

673
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:53,925
You can't fall for that fake Million Wong.

674
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,530
I don't want to be controlled.

675
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,032
I want to go my own way.

676
00:39:57,238 --> 00:39:58,432
About this fake Million Wong.

677
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,774
We can have bright future
if only he is killed.

678
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,402
You are crazy.

679
00:40:03,678 --> 00:40:06,670
Am I? It's you who has changed.

680
00:40:07,415 --> 00:40:08,609
Wong hit you.

681
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:10,683
I took revenge for you. So I killed him.

682
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:12,650
It's you who killed Million?

683
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:15,789
So what? I killed Taior too.

684
00:40:16,424 --> 00:40:17,686
I knew it.

685
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:20,259
He took our dirty pictures
to blackmail you.

686
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:21,659
Such rubbish.

687
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:23,820
Only a dead one would do no harm to us.

688
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:27,333
You did everything.

689
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:29,336
Why?

690
00:40:29,504 --> 00:40:32,029
For you only.

691
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,133
I am now going to kill him.

692
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:38,376
I won't let you do so.

693
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:40,140
Are you falling for that man?

694
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:41,245
Get lost.

695
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:43,883
No, no...

696
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:49,483
That's why she wanted to kill me.

697
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:53,586
Ching wanted to kill me with the arrow.

698
00:40:57,598 --> 00:40:59,896
Why Judy wanted to protect Ching?

699
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:01,962
She has deep affection with her.

700
00:41:02,203 --> 00:41:04,603
So she took all responsibilities herself.

701
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:08,498
She is...

702
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:11,541
What? None of your business, you know?

703
00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:12,610
Yes.

704
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,644
That's right.

705
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:14,974
You have done a great job.

706
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:16,639
You are assigned to another case,
to be undercover again.

707
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:18,580
Are you kidding?

708
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,212
This is an order!

709
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:21,546
Is this an order?

710
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:22,955
You...

711
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:24,921
Be polite, call me Sir.

712
00:41:25,092 --> 00:41:27,492
ICAC admitted that it was a mistake
to charge against me.

713
00:41:27,662 --> 00:41:28,856
I resume duty now.

714
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,256
Isn't it true?

715
00:41:30,765 --> 00:41:31,732
Sure.

716
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:33,193
No big deal.

717
00:41:33,401 --> 00:41:34,766
You may have the same rank as mine.

718
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:37,699
You are wrong, the head said that you
always bully your subordinates.

719
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:39,372
You are suspended now.

720
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:40,539
So, before 1997,

721
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,437
You will be bullied by us.

722
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,440
How dare you?

723
00:41:43,678 --> 00:41:44,736
So what?

724
00:41:44,912 --> 00:41:46,402
Stop it please, stop.

725
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:50,073
What are you doing? Hands off please.

726
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:53,050
Just leave them alone.

727
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:54,620
Chow Sing-Sing, someone is looking for you.

728
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:13,097
Big Mouth.

729
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,802
It's you, Big Nose.

730
00:42:16,978 --> 00:42:17,945
Are you fine?

731
00:42:18,112 --> 00:42:18,942
What?

732
00:42:19,113 --> 00:42:20,546
We are having a party tonight.

733
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:22,911
I have bought many girls with us.

734
00:42:24,952 --> 00:42:26,146
What are you waiting for?

735
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,446
Bring some boys to join us.

736
00:42:27,622 --> 00:42:29,021
Right, hurry up.

737
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:30,815
Fine, make it next time.

738
00:42:30,992 --> 00:42:32,289
Enjoy yourself.

739
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,154
Fine!

740
00:42:36,397 --> 00:42:38,331
Wait for me!
