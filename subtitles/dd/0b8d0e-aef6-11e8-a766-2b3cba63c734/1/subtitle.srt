1
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,084
Be serious.

2
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,919
Or I will tell the doctor about that.

3
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,588
Do you have stomach ache?

4
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,994
Yes. I went shitting twice.

5
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,611
Sing-Sing.

6
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,340
Hi, Ah Man.

7
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,909
Cousin, how are you?

8
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,776
I am an experienced police officer.

9
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,945
I won't care about such little injury.

10
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:37,987
But he is different.

11
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,456
He hasn't had such chance to meet
with a senior officer like me.

12
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,719
You are not my boss.

13
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,487
And you are not a police officer either.

14
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,028
You are suspended by the department.

15
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,632
I am just protecting a common witness.

16
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:51,200
I was framed, you'll know that
I am innocent sooner or later.

17
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,096
When I resume duty,
you will regret what you've done to me.

18
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,706
Cut the crap, stop arguing.

19
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,971
Please, you'd encourage him.

20
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,507
Say, being the undercover.

21
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,075
Undercover?
Don't ask him to be undercover again!

22
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,011
I hate people being undercover.

23
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,888
Sing-Sing, you promised me you'd
never be undercover again.

24
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:11,751
Yes.

25
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,859
But I prefer being an undercover than
protecting this scumbag.

26
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,551
I need no protection from you.

27
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:16,695
But you were attacked

28
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,455
over 30 times after you're suspended.

29
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,461
- What?
- Come on.

30
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,931
Stop arguing!
I will give you some soup, come on.

31
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,563
Anything wrong with you?

32
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,532
I have headache, and a little bit dizzy.

33
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,800
I see!

34
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,442
You refuse to leave the hospital,

35
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,511
because the nurses here are so pretty.

36
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,375
My hand is hurt.

37
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,451
Miss, when can I leave the hospital?

38
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,881
No peeping!
You don't even take care of my hand!

39
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,547
Go and get some medicines from the nurse.

40
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,053
No peeping!

41
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,489
I haven't!

42
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:04,773
What are you doing?

43
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,104
It was dangerous! Didn't you notice it?

44
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,803
What? You are insane!

45
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,148
On the floor!

46
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,448
That's too much!

47
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,175
No, he...

48
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,013
Don't bully me!
Try once more if you dare!

49
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,253
Be careful!

50
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,516
Be careful!

51
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:21,921
Damn you, you wolf!

52
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,154
I can recognize you anyway.

53
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,314
Calling control, I am Chow Sing-Sing,
are you calling me?

54
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,245
Yes.

55
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,547
I've just destroyed

56
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,053
a notorious group of killers.

57
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,021
And I've arrested the involved criminals.

58
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,124
Come and take them back to the station now.

59
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:54,953
Tell him I achieved something.

60
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,652
Officer Lai asked you to
go to the scene immediately.

61
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,563
I am now protecting the witness,
I can't leave.

62
00:04:58,731 --> 00:04:59,755
Officer Lai asked you
to leave everything alone.

63
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:00,921
Come now.

64
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,862
Do you mean to leave everything alone?

65
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:02,626
Yes.

66
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,769
Alright.

67
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,798
Don't move, let me pick up the gun first.

68
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,703
Where is Sing-Sing?

69
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,312
Everyone face to the wall, now!

70
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,106
What's the matter?

71
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,606
He is called by the Headquarters.

72
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,786
Hey, the test tube is broken,
give me a cup.

73
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,051
Yes, sir!

74
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,023
Madam

75
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,293
I'll take it for chemical test right now.

76
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,928
What's the matter?

77
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,430
It's a homicide case.

78
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,002
Is the dead a man or an animal?

79
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,073
Man.

80
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,870
Why a tail is found here?

81
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,510
You are the chemical teacher.

82
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,576
Who are you?

83
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,912
I am Chow Sing-Sing,
you taught me Chemistry in last movie.

84
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,943
I can't remember that.

85
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,756
I am the legal medical expert,
who are you?

86
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,215
Chow Sing-Sing.

87
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,552
What did you ask me before?

88
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,421
Nothing.

89
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,788
Nonsense.

90
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,224
Have you seen Officer Lai?

91
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,762
Which one are you talking about?

92
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,058
That scumbag.

93
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,700
He claims himself Bruce Willies,

94
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,166
he is nicknamed Super-Cop.

95
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,504
That scumbag's foot is under yours.

96
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,063
Sorry, sir.

97
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,476
Are you hurt?

98
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,474
Sure! I am hurt!

99
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,577
Yes.

100
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,442
About the homicide...

101
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,105
It's so cruel.

102
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,080
The dead is called Million Wong.

103
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,447
His hands are tied up,
and he is stabbed to death by an ice digger.

104
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,555
There are sperms left on the bed sheet.

105
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,088
The way he was killed is similar
to the story of one recent movie.

106
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,159
So what do you want me
to do with this case?

107
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,894
Take a look at this picture.

108
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,027
When did you take my picture?

109
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,030
I hate this.

110
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,168
This is the picture of the dead,

111
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,667
you two look like the same.

112
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:45,633
But he had a mole more.

113
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,295
It's funny.

114
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,868
What do you want?

115
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,575
It's a merit to you.

116
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,872
I am sorry, clean your face please.

117
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,411
Where did you get the tissue paper?

118
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,017
It's put next to the bed, so what?

119
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,551
It's used by the victim for cleaning.

120
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,517
Cleaning what?

121
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:03,916
What do you think?

122
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,688
It's alright, just take it as facial.

123
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,455
What do you think, Officer Lai?

124
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,156
Where are the sperms of the victim?

125
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,729
Here it is.

126
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,397
It's empty.

127
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,407
You know

128
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,874
it's a serious crime to
destroy the evidence?

129
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,478
Unless you obey my instruction,
or you'll be punished.

130
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,451
Your mission is to act as Million Wong,
and go back to his home.

131
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,415
To keep an eye on his wife, Judy Tong.

132
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,388
And his friend, Taior Lam who always
wants to take his advantage.

133
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,185
They are suspected to be the murderer.

134
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,228
You want me to be undercover?

135
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,922
That's what I want.
Or you can name yourself

136
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,932
"Betrayer",

137
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,332
Or, bag egg, just as you like!

138
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:59,009
I beg you, don't ask me to be undercover.

139
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,476
I promised my girl of
not being undercover anymore.

140
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,740
Or, I will lose my wife.

141
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,181
Please, be merciful.

142
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:11,785
Please show mercy to me, I beg you!

143
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,587
You can refuse going.

144
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,425
Anyone of you,
just take him back and charge him...

145
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,258
of destroying the important evidence.

146
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,464
Yes sir.

147
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,203
You scared me!

148
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,440
Even I refuse, there will be
another one who is willing to go.

149
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,946
OK, I will listen to you,
you are disgusting!

150
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,212
I haven't promised Macdonna

151
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,479
who flattered me 8 times.

152
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,485
So how can you change my mind
by flattering me like this?

153
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,452
I think it's not Macdonna
but Mac Don-Hung.

154
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,613
Macdonna.

155
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,315
Please give me face to let me
excuse from this mission!

156
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,960
No, you should go.

157
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,220
You are too dominant!

158
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,694
"Dominic" is my Christian name.

159
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,400
Damn it, don't go too far!

160
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,595
I am a kung-fu master.

161
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:58,666
I am expert in No-shadow Fist,

162
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,897
and Skeleton Kick!

163
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,298
You can never defeat me.

164
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,272
But I can defeat you just by my tongue!

165
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,035
Do you want me to go?

166
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,781
Well, it must be reasonable for you
to send me as undercover.

167
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,441
Let me think...

168
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,143
I respect your decision.

169
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,284
OK?

170
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,422
Fine!

171
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,215
Actually I love the name of "Undercover".

172
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,121
I didn't push you.

173
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,054
You are silly,

174
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,825
how can you say this to your best friend?

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,467
Are you taking me as your friend?

176
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,603
We're colleagues, lend me
few hundred thousands to buy a flat, OK?

177
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,441
I can tell you are not righteous.

178
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,375
I will support you anyway.
Try hard to solve the case.

179
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,738
My future brother-in-law.

180
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,707
How nice to meet you, it's my treat.

181
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,646
But, lend me $20,000 first.

182
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,352
You are suspended,
how dare you borrow money from me?

183
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,579
Don't lose my face.

184
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:50,819
I come to report a crime, isn't it OK?

185
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,048
I was indecent assaulted by a woman.

186
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:52,986
Hold it...

187
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,389
As you said before,
you'd support me anyway.

188
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,960
If you are willing to do so,
I will do everything to assist you.

189
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,723
That's fine!
I want him to be my assistant!

190
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,201
The 4th seat of the 3rd row.

191
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,613
You are exaggerating!

192
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,847
None of your business.

193
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,357
You are late!

194
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,560
I was busy.

195
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,526
How is the story?

196
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,927
The woman stays with the man on bed,

197
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,692
she kills the man with an ice-digger.

198
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,439
Hey, I want to tell you something.

199
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,575
What?

200
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,335
I quitted the job in school.

201
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,503
I want to help my mom to
take care of her florist.

202
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:57,018
I wish to take some orders
from the hotels and restaurants.

203
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,050
Isn't it a good idea?

204
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,486
Good, very good.

205
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:00,621
I have something to talk to you too.

206
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,623
What?

207
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,455
I will be an undercover starting
from tomorrow morning.

208
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,991
What?

209
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,459
I will be an undercover starting
from tomorrow morning.

210
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,067
Are you tired of that?

211
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,067
Sure,

212
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,001
but not my boss. I can't help.

213
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,436
What identity will you be this time?

214
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,405
A husband of a woman.

215
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,472
Which woman?

216
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,848
Keep this as secret.

217
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,487
Judy Tong, who always appears
in the gossip magazine.

218
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,224
This is what I can tell,
others should be kept confidential.

219
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,689
Don't you mind?

220
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,064
It's not necessary for you
to scare like this!

221
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,528
Or do you want to take advantage?

222
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,166
Sure. Miss Snow White!

223
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,598
I am leaving.

224
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,437
Excuse me.

225
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,732
Ah Man

226
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,503
Ah Man

227
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,303
Where are you going to?

228
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,243
What are you doing?

229
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,575
Where are you going to?

230
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,852
You promised me not to be undercover again!

231
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,555
You silly girl, this is an order,
I can't help.

232
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,221
Tomorrow is the lunar new year eve.

233
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:08,857
You promised to dine with my family.

234
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:09,517
Excuse me.

235
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,855
No, go and piss once more.

236
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,660
It doesn't matter!

237
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,959
Don't be silly...

238
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,001
OK, you want to be
the husband of Judy Tong?

239
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,238
She is weird!

240
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,896
Will you sleep with her?

241
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,198
No,

242
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,366
I will never do that!

243
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,244
But, I am not sure if I get drunk.

244
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,372
Are you going to sleep with her?

245
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,241
I will date other boyfriends in return.

246
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,719
I don't want to do so,

247
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:36,513
it's my job.

248
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,849
- Excuse me.
- No excuse.

249
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:38,921
I have pissed again.

250
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,149
So, go shitting.

251
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,727
I don't care, if you do something wrong,

252
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,591
I will take revenge.

253
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,423
Say, I will sleep with 10 men.

254
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,326
How can you talk

255
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,664
like this to me?

256
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,533
If you do something wrong,

257
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,003
I will learn from
the character of the film.

258
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,904
When you fall asleep,
I will tie you up,

259
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,672
and stab you to death
with the ice-digger.

260
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,110
Tie me up?

261
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,483
Stop kidding, be careful.

262
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,452
What are you doing?

263
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,658
Nothing.

264
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,023
Have you bathed?

265
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,129
Yes.

266
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,098
You should write the Fei Chun first.

267
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,496
Fine, I'll make it tomorrow.

268
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,637
No way, go now.

269
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,875
My hands are tired.

270
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,584
May I stop here?

271
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,218
You can use your feet.

272
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,288
Great! You wrote them with your toes.

273
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,756
Sure! I am really smart!

274
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,390
Sure you are!

275
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,122
Are you loving me more?

276
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,424
If you were so smart that...

277
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,467
eat the noodle with your toes, can you?

278
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:03,966
What did you say?

279
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,719
Hello?

280
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,519
Are you Mrs. Wong?
This is a call from the police station.

281
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,916
We have found your husband.

282
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,854
Where is he now?

283
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,592
In the police station,
come and pick him up.

284
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,056
Thank you.

285
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,169
Madam, someone sent you

286
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,237
some expensive underwears.

287
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,201
Idiot, everyone knows that
I hate wearing underwears.

288
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,067
You may take them as your own.

289
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,210
Thank you.

290
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,536
I am now going to take Master home.

291
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,009
Yes, Madam.

292
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:48,977
Are you Jelly Tong, no...

293
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,246
Are you Judy Tong?

294
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,650
Call me Judy.

295
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,226
Have you found my husband?

296
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,497
Yes, we found him in New Territories.

297
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,959
He seems to have lost his memory!

298
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,725
We suspected that his head
was seriously hurt.

299
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,494
He's got not a penny in his pocket.

300
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,864
Maybe he is robbed.

301
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,066
Robbed by woman, I guess.

302
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,203
Why don't you smoke?

303
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,580
Mrs. Wong, I am sorry,
smoking is not allowed in this room.

304
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,147
Would you put me in jail?

305
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,143
No... but...

306
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,613
$5,000 will be fined.

307
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,352
Here is ten thousand,
I will treat you cigarette.

308
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,414
Mrs. Wong, money is not
the most powerful thing in the world.

309
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,021
It isn't...

310
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,161
but it's important.

311
00:15:59,058 --> 00:15:59,922
You are not my husband.

312
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,491
I haven't said I was you husband.

313
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,419
He is your husband.

314
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,755
I won't forgive him!

315
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,898
You just go fooling around,
that made you crazy!

316
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,299
Speak something.

317
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,202
What? I lost my memory.

318
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,104
She is your wife.

319
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,365
No.

320
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,169
I didn't say yes.

321
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,437
You are couple anyway,
forget his mistake.

322
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,079
You, go and flatter her,
then it'd be alright.

323
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,441
I won't go home with him.

324
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,809
I come and see whether he is dead or not.

325
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,009
I have light memory that,
my wife is rather pretty.

326
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,244
She is pretty.

327
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,478
What do you think?

328
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,953
Although she is not pretty,
she is your wife.

329
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,815
I am sorry, police can't tell lies.

330
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,051
My wife is having nice body.

331
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,388
She has nice figure too.

332
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,155
My wife doesn't wear underwear.

333
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,128
I have just seen that
she hasn't worn the underwear.

334
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,167
I just guess...

335
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,497
Damn it, you are not crazy at all.

336
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,437
You have sharp tongue!

337
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,770
Well, go home now. Come on.

338
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,072
Are you telling me?

339
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,739
What kind of behavior of you?

340
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,279
You reported of missing a husband,

341
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,509
you come and fool us
after your husband is found.

342
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,483
I'd better take you back to Shenzhen!

343
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,552
You know, we can lock you up

344
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,246
for few months without any trial.

345
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,551
What are you looking? You are impolite.

346
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:08,750
Look at me.

347
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,926
How long can he protect you?

348
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,995
In July 1997, I will arrest him too.

349
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,428
Who are you?

350
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,567
The security officer of China. So what?

351
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,735
You look familiar,
when did you go back to China?

352
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,162
I haven't!

353
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,963
You seem to be the commercial criminal

354
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,200
who stole money from government.

355
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,674
Pal, I want to take
them back to Shenzhen now.

356
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,470
Including him!

357
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,670
Me?

358
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,872
Don't be big mouth,

359
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,278
do you want to interrupt the peace?

360
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,146
I will arrest you,
don't you believe? Damn it!

361
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,086
I am sorry! Excuse me please.

362
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,746
Have you finished? Damn it.

363
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,050
I am sleepy.

364
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,125
Don't be big mouth.

365
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,426
Go home to sleep if you feel sleepy.

366
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,391
Follow me home!

367
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,086
Don't go!

368
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:45,889
Let's go

369
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:46,997
Where is my gun?

370
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,157
Just let them go.

371
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,097
Bull shit works, see?

372
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,997
How dare you be so impolite to me?

373
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,640
You know, you are suspended.

374
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,639
If you pretend to be police again,
I'll ask someone to arrest you.

375
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,635
Don't be so cocky.

376
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,301
I pretended as Chinese security officer,
ask them to arrest me!

377
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,173
You...

378
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,337
Stop it. Or I will go & apply
to be the Chinese security officer,

379
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,606
and I will take revenge in 1997.
You go to hell!

380
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,687
Luckily, I am a catholic,
I will go to heaven.

381
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,521
Young master!

382
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:29,002
Wow...

383
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,832
It's your house, what makes you surprise?

384
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,033
I have lost my memory.

385
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,200
So what?

386
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,107
I don't mean it.

387
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,179
Do you know who she is?

388
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,175
My mom.

389
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,049
You mistook it.

390
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,291
She is Toiletpapa. Our housekeeper.

391
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,949
What? She is toilet paper?

392
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,459
It's a Japanese name.

393
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,655
Daddy.

394
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,157
My dear son...

395
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,029
Good boy, I miss you so much!

396
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,294
Damn it!

397
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,801
He is the son of the gardener.

398
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,171
He greeted me daddy.

399
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,204
He greets everyone as daddy.

400
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:02,965
Greet us.

401
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,235
Daddy...

402
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,878
I am glad you are back.

403
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:09,911
Do you know who he is?

404
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:10,912
Is he the cook who makes curry?

405
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:11,913
He is your dad.

406
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:12,982
What?

407
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,244
Good boy.

408
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,750
Daddy.

409
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:18,745
It's good to see you again.

410
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:19,720
Do you know who he is?

411
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:20,916
May be a gardener.

412
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:21,957
Your baby sitter.

413
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,560
What?

414
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,092
Master, do you want to have milk?

415
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,458
Why not later?

416
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,628
Do you know who he is?

417
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:31,866
I don't think he is my brother.

418
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:32,969
- Sure he is.
- What?

419
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,332
You always treat him as your brother.

420
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,666
I see.

421
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:37,398
Call its name,

422
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,668
or it will bite you.

423
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,833
Do you mean it?

424
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:40,774
What name is it?

425
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,174
Use your brain!

426
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,405
Dolly...

427
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,351
David, Peter, Maria, Rose, Gigo...

428
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,613
Gigio Armani, Valentino...

429
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,689
Wong Jing, Ng Man Tat, Gordon Chan...

430
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,096
This dog should be killed.

431
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,300
It's called Dolly Law!

432
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,198
You forget its name.

433
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,236
I said Dolly many times.

434
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,467
No, it's called Dolly Law. Not Dolly.

435
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:12,905
You should mention it's surname Law.

436
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,677
That's why it didn't obey me.

437
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:16,836
Young Master.

438
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:17,777
The vet has arrived.

439
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,110
Which dog should I draw its teeth?

440
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,248
This way.

441
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,818
Thank you, doctor.

442
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,027
Lower your voice.

443
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,912
You always fall asleep
when doing massage to you.

444
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,375
But why are you so excited today?

445
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,346
I don't know why.

446
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,486
Don't pull so hard, OK?

447
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,089
Young master, but you love it.

448
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,020
You mean it?

449
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:00,715
Yes.

450
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:01,950
Forget it.

451
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,469
Why are you interested in this old picture?

452
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,871
I have lost my memory.

453
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,904
So what?

454
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,405
I don't mean it.

455
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,305
I wonder! Why did I take

456
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,413
such picture with an underwear only!

457
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:26,306
It's me who begged you to wear it!

458
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:27,575
You refused to wear anything at first.

459
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,084
You wanted to be sexy.

460
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,778
You didn't satisfy with it at all.

461
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,688
I can't imagine he is that kind of person.

462
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,018
What?

463
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,654
I have lost my memory.

464
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,126
If not judging from your look,

465
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,493
I suspect that you're fake.

466
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,727
What? Are you suspecting me?
I told you I lost my memory.

467
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,632
Actually what did I tell you before I lost?

468
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,363
I don't know.

469
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,932
Toiletpapa.

470
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:50,870
What are you calling her for?

471
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:51,873
To prepare for your bath.

472
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,204
She has slept.

473
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,874
What do you want, master?

474
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,413
You always appear so suddenly!

475
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,447
Madam, she said I appeared so suddenly.

476
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,711
It's the usual practice of
everybody in this house.

477
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,619
I know how to appear in a sudden too.

478
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,465
What are you doing?

479
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,896
Are you pretending to be death?

480
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,625
Hello, Officer Lai, I am Judy Tong.

481
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,894
What's the matter?

482
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,230
You have found me the husband,
he is not my husband.

483
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,431
Thinner, make it thinner.

484
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,203
How do you know that?

485
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,742
He knows nothing

486
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,174
about my family.

487
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,008
He was bitten by our dog.

488
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,776
I asked him to bath, he did it.

489
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,781
But he bathed only 4 times a year before.

490
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,647
He was pushed

491
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,721
to take a bath before our wedding.

492
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:41,085
We asked him to take bath in
the detention centre, he addicted to it.

493
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,022
Hey, he is your real husband.

494
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,628
Treat him nicely, otherwise,

495
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,024
I won't let you go.

496
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,093
Are you Officer Lai?
How can you talk like this?

497
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:48,891
I am not Officer Lai?

498
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,193
Don't you think I am Leon Lai?

499
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,502
Go to hell.

500
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,760
It doesn't seem to be your voice.

501
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,802
You're right.

502
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,607
You deserve severe punishment.

503
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,010
Officer Chan.

504
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,013
What's the matter?

505
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,213
I don't think my husband is my husband.

506
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,153
I don't understand.

507
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,882
Officer Lai found my missing husband.

508
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,152
He looks like my husband.

509
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,226
But,

510
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,658
I have found that,

511
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,990
he isn't my husband.

512
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,154
Officer Lai has found you a husband

513
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,664
who is not your husband.

514
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,529
But you've found that your husband
isn't your husband.

515
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,261
He is not my husband.

516
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,631
So you are suspecting
that he is fake although

517
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,865
he is like your husband.

518
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,065
I think so.

519
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,767
You should ask Officer Lai.

520
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,205
I have called him.

521
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,210
But, I don't know whether
it's Officer Lai or not,

522
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,678
He told me that my present husband

523
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,009
is my husband.

524
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:40,911
That Officer Lai, you don't know
whether he is true or not,

525
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:41,984
he told you,

526
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,213
Your present husband is your real husband?

527
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:45,519
I think so.

528
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,622
I have a suggestion.

529
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,625
Go home and take a bath,
and drink a cup of hot milk.

530
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,194
Come to see Officer Lai
early tomorrow morning.

531
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,796
Then you will discover that,

532
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,522
your husband is your husband again.

533
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,428
Are you suspecting me?
Don't you trust me?

534
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,100
Don't you think I am idiot?

535
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,632
I think so.

536
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,703
He is fake.

537
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,273
I am fake too.

538
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,442
Actually I am Andy Lau,
I pretended to be Officer Chan.

539
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,341
Now, it's 30 minutes passed 12.

540
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,743
Oh, it's the first day of
the Lunar New Year.

541
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,043
Happy New Year.

542
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:13,980
What are you doing? Officer Chan?

543
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,086
- That's it, bye bye.
- I haven't finished.

544
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,181
Bye bye.

545
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,054
You are great, my dear classmate.

546
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,490
Kung Hei Fat Choi!

547
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,254
You are making a dead set at me.

548
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:27,861
She is rich,

549
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,523
she will sue us, you know?

550
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,895
But we are carrying law and justice.

551
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,095
You misjudge righteousness!

552
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,202
How dare you push me?

553
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,431
Go to hell.

554
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,406
So what?

555
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:39,874
How dare you hit me?

556
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,012
I will kill you!

557
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,775
Officer Chan, I have lost my lighter.

558
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,349
Why your eyes are so black?

559
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,854
I don't have enough sleep, that's it.

560
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,582
Mrs. Wong, Kung Hei Fat Choi.

561
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,659
Good luck, good bye.

562
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,126
Anyway, happy anything to you.

563
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:00,995
All are crazy!

564
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:27,753
What kind of noise is it?

565
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:30,826
What are you doing?

566
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,622
What are you doing?

567
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:36,925
You are my boss, I am your assistant,
don't you forget?

568
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:37,864
Yes.

569
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,867
You asked me to protect you, right?

570
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,834
Sure.

571
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,268
I have done what you've instructed.

572
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,634
I haven't told you to cut
the ceiling of others.

573
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,676
Yes, you didn't!

574
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,039
Go away, you idiot.

575
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,409
I don't need your protection.

576
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,349
But, I've to watch over you,

577
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:58,511
to stop you from betraying my cousin.

578
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,214
- Here you are, Madam.
- Yes.

579
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,391
Judy is back, go now.

580
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,767
Shit, a fatty has gone into the room,
what shall I do?

581
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,304
Are you back? Where have you gone?

582
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,574
I just went out to eat noodle.

583
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,907
- Noodle?
- Yes.

584
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,208
Very good.

585
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,441
In order to finish my mission,

586
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,210
I have to flatter her.

587
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,853
I want to tempt her,

588
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,511
and make her tell me the truth.

589
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,586
To find out the truth,

590
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,452
I should flatter him.

591
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,093
I want him to disclose his real identity.

592
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,980
Judy!

593
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,158
Million.

594
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,116
Judy!

595
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,285
Million.

596
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,491
Sorry, I am tired.

597
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,358
I am going to sleep in the study room.

598
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,866
My God, please give me a strong man.

599
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,269
Ask him to enter my dream, thank you.

600
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,450
Really strong.

601
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,118
He is already undressed.

602
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,651
Thank God...

603
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,117
I am coming.

604
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:18,123
Hurry up, fix the present
as soon as possible!

605
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,158
Master and madam are coming down.

606
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,663
Congratulations.

607
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,234
Happy New Year...

608
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,270
Always lucky...

609
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,032
Here is the red pocket.

610
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,133
You give them lucky money too.

611
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,311
I haven't brought them with me,
give me some.

612
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,313
Here is the red pocket.

613
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,278
Congratulations.

614
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,451
Always lucky.

615
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,450
Thank you.

616
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,747
How about me?

617
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,354
You are married.

618
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,650
Give it to me

619
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:48,656
Where is yours?

620
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:49,816
I am not married.

621
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:50,926
You have mistaken. It's mine.

622
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:51,960
Yours will be sent by Madam.

623
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,927
See, they have got two per head.

624
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,194
That's good.

625
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,527
Congratulations.

626
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:58,532
Officer Lai.

627
00:28:58,703 --> 00:28:59,499
This is for you...

628
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,262
Officer Lai.

629
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,803
That's very kind of you.

630
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,769
I should send you some present.

631
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:04,907
Kung Hei Fat Choi!

632
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,634
No, we can't be "Fat Choi" (Getting rich).

633
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,075
Because ICAC would suspect us
if we get any extra money.

634
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,246
Well, wish you to be promoted.

635
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,643
That's good.

636
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,180
Mr. Wong, are you fine?

637
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,949
You'd take a rest for your head's hurt.

638
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,590
Yes, take a seat,
I will fetch you some cake.

639
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,020
Good.

640
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,321
How is it? What have you found?

641
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,965
I tried to seduce her,
I won't mind sacrifice.

642
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,191
But I can't get anything.

643
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,995
Why don't you find another one?

644
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:32,931
Do you want me to kill you?

645
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,628
Give us some tea.

646
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,137
Yes, Master.

647
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,473
I have given you an assistant
who is suspended.

648
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,575
If you can't get me the real murderer,

649
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,143
you'd suicide in front of me.

650
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,143
But I am afraid that I would be killed.

651
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,712
Who dares kill you?

652
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,189
Who is he?

653
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,819
The one wearing fur.

654
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,586
A woman!

655
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,057
Happy New Year! My best friend.

656
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,130
Your girlfriend is bald.

657
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,670
My brother. Amigo.

658
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:11,705
Happy New Year.

659
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,104
Who are you looking for?

660
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,177
Taior!

661
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,605
Judy!

662
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,679
Judy, what's wrong with Million?
He can't recognize me.

663
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,376
I do, you are Taior, right?

664
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,147
No, you never called me like this.

665
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,688
What did you call me before?

666
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:27,756
Speak up.

667
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:28,688
Isn't it "Damn you"?

668
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,849
Damn you?

669
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:33,623
That's right, you fool!

670
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,389
You mean "Fool"?

671
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,367
No, I am "Damn You", you are Fool!

672
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,469
You are "Fool"?

673
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,400
You are "Fool"!

674
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:42,198
Are you "Fool"?

675
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,362
He is "Damn You"!

676
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,872
Right, Damn You!

677
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,010
Oh, you are Damn You, and you are Fool.

678
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,405
He is Damn you, Shithead.

679
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,375
I am Shithead?

680
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,207
Make it simple.

681
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,643
Just call "Scumbag" together.

682
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,541
How can you talk like this
at the beginning of new year?

683
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:54,582
Say it again.

684
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:55,946
Damn it.

685
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,416
You are great!

686
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,015
Sorry...

687
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,350
Who is that scumbag?

688
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,358
He is Officer Lai who found
my husband back.

689
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:08,264
I am not used to stay
with such junior police officers.

690
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,595
My disco is newly opened.

691
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,963
You should come earlier tonight.

692
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,571
I have asked many girls to join us.

693
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,404
You love it.

694
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,102
What did you say?

695
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,306
Kidding.

696
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,178
Shit, I forgot to visit my daddy.

697
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,316
How is your daddy?

698
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,750
He died.

699
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,746
I am hurrying to worship him.
See you tonight.

700
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:33,856
Bye bye.

701
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,352
See you.

702
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,490
He is the best friend of Million Wong.

703
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,894
He always wants to seize Wong's property.
He is worth suspecting.

704
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:47,168
Judy, you look weird.

705
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,933
Do you want it?

706
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,835
It's not necessary to court a woman.

707
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,477
It's just a waste of time.

708
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,976
Where there's money there's woman.

709
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,645
I will pay her money
so that she would listen to me.

710
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,908
I will pay her more money
to make her love me.

711
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:04,416
Money's just drugs,
one will be hooked on it.

712
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:05,981
In that case, you got loads of drugs?

713
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,057
Which movie star are you courting lately?

714
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,955
Have a change, not film stars now.

715
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,857
To court those working girl.

716
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,795
That really turns me on.

717
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:16,897
Really?

718
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,765
The one yesterday
I courted owns a florist shop.

719
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,270
Small world!
The one I had also owns a florist shop.

720
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,137
The girl I am going to date tomorrow
is having one as well.

721
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,239
Which florist shop is it?

722
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,981
What, you want to join the queue?

723
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,083
Have you got your wife's permission?

724
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,884
Don't look at me!
You can do anything you like.

725
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,822
He wants to have fun too.

726
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,258
I couldn't care less.

727
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,928
I'm going to dance.

728
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,233
Stop fussing about my head.

729
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,036
I just want to know

730
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,737
how nice is that florist shop owner.

731
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,704
I don't know how to describe.

732
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:06,612
Anyway, she's got big eyes,
pointed nose, sexy lips,

733
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,879
a pair of nice tits,

734
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,156
- and...
- What's her name?

735
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:17,087
Damn! I just couldn't remember.

736
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,062
Ada? No.

737
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,492
Patty? No.

738
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,530
Cindy? No.

739
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,292
Anyway she's great on bed.

740
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,437
From the bed to the floor,

741
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,799
from the floor up to the bed,

742
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,065
from the bed to the kitchen...

743
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,732
She is so cheap!

744
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,843
It's really cheap.

745
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,140
Another thing, she said,

746
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,783
the boyfriend she's going to dump
is a police as well.

747
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,520
Where's she? I want her now!

748
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,681
Cool it!

749
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,416
We had a date,
she'll be here in a minute.

750
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,185
- Really?
- Sure.

751
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,420
Let me make up first.

752
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,298
Really?

753
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,910
Baby! Give me a kiss.

754
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,286
So cheap!

755
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,560
Baby! Give me a kiss.

756
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:24,927
Alright!

757
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,760
So cheap!

758
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,370
What's up now?

759
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:38,968
Just looking for somebody.

760
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,030
Judy, why don't you introduce
the beauty to me?

761
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,600
Judy!

762
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,672
Son of a bitch! Stop pushing!

763
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,139
You keep the birds

764
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,180
and give us the elbow.

765
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,579
You call that good mates.

766
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,344
You have had enough fun!

767
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,845
Judy!

768
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,125
Let me introduce, she is called Ching,

769
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,985
she is our right hand,

770
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,129
this is Mr. Wong.

771
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,388
We met before.

772
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,121
Right.

773
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,287
I can't imagine how troublesome

774
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,296
if Ching leaves my company.

775
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,798
We don't know what to do.

776
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:11,934
I won't bother you.

777
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,035
Why not a chat?

778
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,501
Bye bye.
Bye bye.

779
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,633
What are you looking?
You always love watching girls.

780
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,206
What else am I going to do?

781
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,636
Have a dance with me.

782
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,023
Who are you looking for?

783
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,488
Just looking for someone.

784
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,593
The bird you're with?

785
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,698
No.

786
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,663
Did you tell lies?

787
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,165
No.

788
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:48,098
Can you concentrate and dance with me?

789
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,909
How sweet are you two!

790
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:55,907
Where've you been?

791
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,570
My girl had come,
I was going to introduce you to her.

792
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:58,339
Where?

793
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,380
She's left!

794
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,609
Never mind, make it next time.

795
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,019
What a nice hair style.

796
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,885
I admire it.

797
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,801
We are having a party tonight,
are you coming?

798
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:28,673
Go and search

799
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,279
more girls to join us.

800
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,506
Fine!

801
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,010
What are you doing?

802
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,883
Nothing, I remember something.

803
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,043
Why not play something new?

804
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,348
New?

805
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,751
We are having a party tonight,

806
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,984
you must come.

807
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,491
Why are you standing here?

808
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,354
Stop frowning,

809
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,020
smile.

810
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:53,667
We are having a party tonight,
you must come.

811
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:54,702
Big Busts.

812
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,134
Big nose.

813
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,001
Sorry.

814
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,507
We are having a party tonight,

815
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,375
You must come.

816
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,242
Why are you standing here,

817
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,974
go and get more girls to join us.

818
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,245
Cut! Very good.

819
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,719
What a job.

820
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,887
Why do you come into my room?
My mom will be back soon.

821
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,451
Your mom?

822
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,461
I tell her that you are my tutor.

823
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,429
If she knows it, she'll be furious.

824
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,162
She told me not to let boys in.

825
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,827
No kissing.

826
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:31,065
No... too.

827
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,802
Is it my turn now?

828
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,773
What are you on about?

829
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,039
What? I don't know.

830
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,183
Remember the camp last time?

831
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,785
You walked in my camp and kissed me.

832
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,646
Well, let's stop here,
I am going back to the study room.

833
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,316
I just want to know
why don't you kiss me tonight.

834
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,351
Well, can I go back to
the study room after kissing you?

835
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,757
Give me a kiss first.

836
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,367
Not here!

837
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,793
Where then?

838
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,073
Come on Judy, Don't go too far.

839
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,475
Naughty!

840
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,543
So what?

841
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,844
Come on...

842
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,608
I won't care!

843
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,186
What are you doing?

844
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,649
Hey, you have a part too.

845
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,522
What are you doing here?

846
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,594
How dare you court my girl,
I want to beat you to death.

847
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,557
Don't just beat me,
you should beat her too.

848
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,824
She is the director, I can't beat her.

849
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:35,262
How dare you court my daughter?

850
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,837
How dare you!

851
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,442
You make me feel shame.

852
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:41,508
It's not wise to tell others this scandal.

853
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,475
I am leaving.

854
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:43,670
Damn it!

855
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,777
You bastard, kneel down.

856
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,085
You bastard, how dare you seduce daughter!

857
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,311
You shouldn't put it that way.

858
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:51,716
But I was pushed to do so!

859
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,947
How can you talk like this?

860
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,217
You are inhuman!
You want to leave my daughter alone?

861
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,417
I want to quit!

862
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,791
Do it, go on acting.

863
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,360
Look, he is heartless!

864
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,969
I must go and tell your dad.

865
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,033
You are getting marry next month.

866
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,193
- Marry?
- No?

867
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,236
Are you going to marry?

868
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,738
OK, make it quick!

869
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,341
That's good, hurry up!

870
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,375
You should be good from now on.

871
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,138
- I am busy, excuse me.
- Go, hurry up!

872
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,685
My mom approves to let us get married.

873
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:25,651
What? Again?

874
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:26,790
Come on!

875
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:28,957
Time's up, game over!

876
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,125
You haven't noticed me
since we slept in separate rooms.

877
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,999
I've never said a word about
all those women you had.

878
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,459
I want you for just tonight!

879
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,332
Can I?

880
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:51,240
Can I? Why not?

881
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,010
Why?

882
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,447
Stop crying, I'm not the type.

883
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,883
I am a loyal man.

884
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,957
What's that again.

885
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,858
I am a loyal husband.
I want only one wife.

886
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,962
Just tell me you love me.

887
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,170
I love you.

888
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,141
Again.

889
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,977
I love you.

890
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,318
Hold me tight.

891
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,302
Stop staring!

892
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,430
I wish you would be run over by the car.

893
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,285
Give us a twirl.

894
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,811
Damn you! You are so cocky to
wear the patterned socks.

895
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,192
What do you want?

896
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,489
Just to pick up something.

897
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,297
What do you want, twit?

898
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,033
Just to pick up something.

899
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,333
What are you doing?
Get back inside. Would you?

900
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,245
Nothing, just pick up the coins.

901
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:38,642
Come and eat the red bean sweet soup.

902
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,585
Not much business today?

903
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,419
Not so good, because it's newly opened.

904
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:44,645
Kidding?

905
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,280
Quite a few of peoples came
for you yesterday.

906
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,289
Oh yeah, how do you know?

907
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,391
Where is your mole?

908
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,230
Here.

909
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,525
Bravo!

910
00:43:58,736 --> 00:43:59,828
This is nice.

911
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,028
Don't you think it's chewy?

912
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:01,864
Just one.

913
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,597
Of course, that's my mole.

914
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,072
Does it taste better with the mole in it?

915
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,469
You two go on, I just go out for a minute.

916
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,003
Where are you going?

917
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:10,744
To deliver flowers to someone's wife.

918
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,006
Unlike you, you have no money

919
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,809
and no flower. See you.

920
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:14,709
You should be blamed.

921
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:16,182
What do you want again?

922
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:17,786
I come to eat the sweet soup
and to protect you.

923
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:18,979
Why don't you stay then.

924
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,923
Taior and his gang are coming
to play cards tonight.

925
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,592
I think I can get some clues.

926
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,889
You are wise to search for my help.

927
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,359
I'll take care of you tonight,
because I am the gambling king!

928
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:42,973
What are you looking for?

929
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,114
Nothing.

930
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:47,706
How is it?

931
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,282
Everything normal.

932
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,582
Do you have money?

933
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,616
You know I am called the Gambling King
of the police department?

934
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:55,119
I don't think so!

935
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,257
You will know it later.

936
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,886
Mr. Wong, where is your mole?

937
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:01,893
Removed.

938
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,260
But it brings you wealth.

939
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,662
Really?

940
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,996
Because I have much money,
I don't want more!

941
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:08,571
It's very wise of you!

942
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:09,603
See?

943
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,867
Let's follow the old rules.

944
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:12,973
What?

945
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,110
Gamble in cash.

946
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,905
Sure! Sure!

947
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,314
Maximum credit is $200,000.

948
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,379
Isn't it the change?

949
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,715
This is all I have.

950
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,823
Mr. Wong, $10,000 as base.

951
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,860
It's an eight.

952
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,857
A nine can have the 1st call.

953
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,429
Make it $50,000.

954
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,632
How is it?

955
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,463
$150,000 more.

956
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:45,168
We'll get rich
if we get all the base only.

957
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:46,536
I see.
