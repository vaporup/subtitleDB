1
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,220
Good morning, Quark.

2
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,179
I couldn't believe it. Lisa told
Janet that Paul asked Barbara...

3
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,224
to ask me if I had
a date to the dance.

4
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,722
No, they broke up for
religious differences.

5
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,486
She thought she was God
and he disagreed.

6
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,026
Yeah, this afternoon around 5:00.

7
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,785
I'm meeting him at the mall.
I don't know.

8
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,612
Maybe. Yeah.

9
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:29,495
Oh, I can't. I've got to hang around
a while and keep an eye on Nick.

10
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,669
He likes to take things apart.

11
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:37,749
Well, that's why I watch it at your
house. Things'll cool off after today.

12
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,630
Dad has his big
show-and-tell at the lab.

13
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,761
Zap!

14
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,549
- It works! I-It really works!
- Nick, get real.

15
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,810
The subject has disappeared.

16
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,519
No, no, it's not that.

17
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,565
No. Mom and Dad had
an argument last night...

18
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,564
and Mom spent the night
at Grandma's.

19
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,614
I think she just needed a rest.

20
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,740
Right, her and me both.

21
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,362
Yeah, okay. Okay. Bye.

22
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,753
Amy, when's Mom coming home?

23
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:19,291
She's working, Nick.
She'll be home this afternoon.

24
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,217
If only Dad could get
that machine to work.

25
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,447
Breakfast.

26
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,116
I need a couple minutes here.

27
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:01,838
"I'll be down in five minutes."

28
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,003
Typing with his gloves on again.

29
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,334
Oh, no, not again!

30
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,119
Who does he think he is,
Mister Wizard?

31
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,633
Szalinski, give it a rest!
It's Saturday!

32
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:50,015
It's construction, honey. You of
all people should understand that.

33
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:55,266
Yeah, but I want some sleep.
We've got a four-hour drive ahead of us.

34
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,597
And I think he should have
consideration for other people.

35
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,562
Mm, give the guy a break.

36
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:04,946
I'll give him a break.
I'll break his arm!

37
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,692
Honey!

38
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,492
Szalinski!

39
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,618
But, honey, you are
much bigger than he is.

40
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,541
Szalinski!

41
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,081
- Honey, can't...
- Hold it, Dad.

42
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,079
- Don't move.
- Ron, what are you doing?

43
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,841
- Defending the backyard, Dad.
- That's my fishing rod!

44
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,214
Stop! Dad!

45
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,848
- Am I bleeding?
- Honey, it's rubber.

46
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:35,018
- Dad, I told you not to move.
- What's on this thing?

47
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:39,267
- Super Glue.
- Super Glue?

48
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:42,857
- I'm not a trespasser. I'm your father!
- Let me wash it off quick, hon.

49
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,151
- Ah, it's taking the skin off.
- I'll talk to you later.

50
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,777
- What's with this kid?
- He's 12.

51
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,357
- Attila the Hun was
12 once, too, you know.

52
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,745
He's sounding.

53
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,128
Weird family.

54
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,385
Dad?

55
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,514
Look, I finished mine.
Looks just like yours, huh?

56
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:22,727
- That's great, Nick.
- You know, Dad, I was calculating.

57
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:26,650
- If you took all the
molecules in this house...

58
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,111
Why don't you go help your sister?

59
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,197
Stay back, boy.
This thing works...

60
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,203
this'll put us up there with
the invention of electricity...

61
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,160
first man in space.

62
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,243
First dog in space.

63
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,503
Come on! Shrink!

64
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,169
Shrink!

65
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,102
Please, please, shrink.

66
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,934
Please, shrink.

67
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:04,834
On the other hand, we've come up with an
interesting way of making applesauce.

68
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,801
- You got it, honey.
- Sure?

69
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:16,132
You're wiping away brain cells,
and there aren't many to spare.

70
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:21,217
- Everybody in my family's a comedian.
- Everybody except you.

71
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,268
Darn right.

72
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,268
Well, look who's decided to
join the land of the living.

73
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,065
And is Russell ready
for his big fishing trip?

74
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,942
- Not really, Dad.
- Not really?

75
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,986
There's a big fish out there
with your name on it.

76
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,402
Fishing's your thing,
Dad, not mine.

77
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,073
What's the matter with him?
What do you mean, shush?

78
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:49,462
There... I see nothing wrong
with wanting to take my son fishing.

79
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,999
Russell, I shouldn't be telling
you this, but he was cut from

80
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,427
- What?
- Honey, please. What he doesn't

81
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,348
- He needs something.
When I was his age, I was capt...

82
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,971
And if my father'd wanted me to go on
a fishing trip, I would've been gra...

83
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,848
You'd been grateful.
Russ, he is too small for football.

84
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,643
He is not too small for football!

85
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,520
Honey, when you say things like that,
you make him feel about this big.

86
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,980
If he wants to feel big,
he should act big.

87
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,324
Elbows up.

88
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,958
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm on a special diet.

89
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,083
- No toxic waste.
- Fine.

90
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,258
Here, Quark.

91
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,097
Eat it, Dad,
before it gets cold.

92
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:48,022
Mm, did you get
the machine to work?

93
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,315
Yeah. A few more bugs
to get out, but...

94
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,565
- What about the conference?
<i>- Meow.</i>

95
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,814
Jeez, the conference.
I gotta get going.

96
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,651
Dad! Dad, wait. Dad!

97
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,988
If Mom calls, tell her
I'll be home by lunchtime.

98
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,613
Dad, don't forget my dress from
the cleaners, Nick's allergy pills...

99
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,702
It's all in my head.
Don't worry.

100
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:13,128
Wish me luck. I need luck
getting out of this door.

101
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,758
- House of insanity.
- Hi, honey.

102
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,807
<i>Hi, Mom. Nick, go get Dad.</i>

103
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,431
He's just leaving
for the conference.

104
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,012
Dad, it's Mom.

105
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,188
- Where?
- On the phone.

106
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,352
- Oh.
- How did everything go this morning?

107
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:38,447
- Boy, did we miss you.
- I missed you, too, honey.

108
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,449
- Did Paul Tate ask you to the dance?
- I think he's going to.

109
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,574
I'm gonna meet him at
the mall later today.

110
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,738
- Here's Dad.
- Thanks.

111
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,658
- Hiya.
<i>- Hi.</i>

112
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,913
- I called to wish you luck
at the conference.

113
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,714
this morning, everything'll change
around here, I promise you.

114
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,550
<i>Okay. I have</i>
<i>a house to show...</i>

115
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,923
and then I'll be home this
afternoon and we'll talk.

116
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:04,009
<i>- Good luck today.</i>
- Thanks. Bye, honey.

117
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:08,179
- What time is Mom coming home?
- Later. Listen, we gotta make

118
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,022
Nick, I want you to
mow the lawn. Amy...

119
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,315
good luck.

120
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:30,117
I'm helping my Dad with this
real important new invention.

121
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,996
So, mm...

122
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,087
I'll... I'll let you
mow half my yard.

123
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,667
No, thanks.

124
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,794
Wow! With that?

125
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,796
Yeah...

126
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,597
and...

127
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,550
this.

128
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,762
Oh, it's a remote control!

129
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,566
Tell you what. You thrown in
a box of cookies...

130
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,191
I'll let you cut the whole thing.

131
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,109
Uh, but I have to go
and meet Newt right now.

132
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,532
Uh, could I do it later?

133
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,622
- I don't think so, because, you know,
my Dad's gonna come home and...

134
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,828
- Okay. But don't be too late.
- Okay, thanks.

135
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,501
- No problem.
- See you later!

136
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,550
Nothin' like a hard day's work.

137
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,638
French fries.

138
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,104
Tater Sticks.

139
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,863
Meat loaf.

140
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,188
Veal "parmedjian."

141
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,149
Hey, Dad, wanna go
play some baseball?

142
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:48,112
Hmm, baseball.

143
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,290
No. I gotta load the camper, Ron.
I'm busy.

144
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,245
Hey, Russ, pitch for me.

145
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:15,809
Hey, Szalinski, ever do anything normal,
like play baseball?

146
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,353
Nope.

147
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,603
- Baseball's for mortals.
- Maybe you could be the base.

148
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:26,358
- Maybe you could be the mound.
- Ronald!

149
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,526
Lug your stuff.

150
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,528
Later, worm.

151
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,164
Russell, gimme a hand here.

152
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,176
Russell! Gimme a hand here.

153
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,841
Dad, it's early.

154
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,932
The early worm catches
the fish, Russell.

155
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,929
Remember that.

156
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:00,687
The Forresters are coming by after
lunch, so come on! Quick march!

157
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:25,378
<i>Something here between us</i>
<i>is something that I can't resist</i>

158
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:33,464
<i>A physical attraction</i>
<i>Feel it every time we kiss</i>

159
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,551
Weird family.

160
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:40,436
<i>Oh, you got me so excited</i>
<i>Still it's not enough</i>

161
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:45,352
<i>I'm gonna try to fight it</i>
<i>till I know if this is love</i>

162
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,485
<i>Turn it up</i>

163
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,823
- Yeah!
<i>- Turn it up, ooh hoo</i>

164
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,740
<i>I love to hear</i>

165
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,535
Russell...

166
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,377
I know it seems strange
when you look at me today...

167
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:07,457
but when I was your age,
I was not much bigger than you.

168
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,251
- I know, Dad. You've told me
about a million times.

169
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,632
The point is,
Coach put me on these babies.

170
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:19,102
Know what happened? I put on 20 pounds
of pure, unadulterated...

171
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:22,521
blitz-the-quarterback
and rip-his-head-off muscle, Russell.

172
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:27,733
Now, I'll make you a little bet.
If you work out for three months...

173
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,356
you will be throwing farther,
you will be running faster...

174
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,404
and you will be hitting harder
than anybody else on that team.

175
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,684
Go on. Try it. Go ahead.

176
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,980
Um, Dad, you... you know that
weights aren't my thing.

177
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,895
Fishing isn't your thing.

178
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,274
Weights aren't your thing.
Just what is your thing?

179
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,696
I don't know, but I'll
keep you posted, okay?

180
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,574
Fine. Until you do,
you're trying these.

181
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,501
And you're coming fishing
with the family. Is that clear?

182
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,163
I can't hear you!

183
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,928
Yes, sir.

184
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,384
Better.

185
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,888
Now, uh, lift with your legs,
not with your back.

186
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,775
What am I doing wrong, Spike?

187
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,539
Russell, you're not smoking
a cigarette, are you?

188
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,835
No, dear.
You know I've given that up.

189
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,302
- Your stuff all loaded?
- Ready to fire.

190
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:29,976
- Got the best spot on the lake.
You looking forward to it?

191
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:33,769
He's only 12, and he's already
thinking about construction.

192
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:38,360
- Why can't Russell be more like that?
- Oh, honey, just give him a chance.

193
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,791
Ron Thompson at the plate. Bottom of
the ninth. It's a clutch situation.

194
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:54,880
Here's the pitch.
Oh, he's swinging like a rusty gate.

195
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,638
He pumps once, pumps twice. Ohh!

196
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,294
He's never been good
on the high outside pitch.

197
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,510
Here it comes. Fastball.
His bread and butter.

198
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,310
Grand...

199
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,687
slam.

200
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,194
Hey, hey, I didn't do it.

201
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,566
- Come on, you dope.
- Hey, nobody has to know.

202
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,944
Let's negotiate this.
I'm your brother, Russ.

203
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,199
You're not supposed to fink
on your own brother!

204
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,042
Turn me in, and I'll tell all that
you spend your allowance on... Uuh!

205
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,084
Come on, Russ!

206
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:34,209
Look, either you tell them
or I tell them, okay?

207
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,716
Okay. You tell 'em.

208
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:57,901
- Aren't you in the wrong yard?
- Listen, nerd face...

209
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,402
- What's going on?
- Hi. Um...

210
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,495
I-I'm Russ Thompson
from next door, uh...

211
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,289
Um...

212
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,660
Uh, my brother has something to
tell you, or else I could tell her.

213
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,956
Okay! See, I was playing
with my ball, right?

214
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,373
Well... Well, actually,
it's not my ball exactly.

215
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,258
- It's Charlie Sudzen's.
- Just tell her what you did.

216
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:21,759
It never would've happened
if their house wasn't so close!

217
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,385
- He hit a baseball
through your attic window.

218
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:27,511
It shouldn't have been closed
in the first place. It's a nice day!

219
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:31,351
- We'll get it fixed, okay? We'll take
it out of his allowance, all right?

220
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,109
Okay, we'll just have
Dad pay for it, huh?

221
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,351
We'll take it out of my allowance.
Gimme my ball back.

222
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:39,280
Until you pay,
no man shall pass.

223
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:43,742
- You got nothin' to say
about it, space boy!

224
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,828
Nick, take him upstairs and get him
his ball. And clean up the mess.

225
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:50,199
- What?
- Do it, Nick. I don't

226
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:56,464
Come on. This is what's wrong with
the American system of justice.

227
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:01,256
So, y... You like to dance, huh?

228
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:06,423
- How do you know?
- Well...

229
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,432
- You could see me?
- No.

230
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:12,521
Uh, no, I... Yeah, I could.
But I wasn't watching you. I...

231
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,193
Awesome.

232
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,948
So your Dad's still in contact
with his home planet.

233
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,909
And given that my machine can
substantially reduce...

234
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:40,627
the size of bulky payloads
and fuel supplies...

235
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:43,463
the savings to the space programme
would be staggering.

236
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,842
Mr. Szalinski, are you
trying to tell me that...

237
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:48,469
suddenly size is
no longer relative?

238
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,675
Well, that's right, Professor
Frederickson, that all matter is...

239
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,058
made up of not only density,
but of empty space.

240
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,554
And if we can proportionally reduce
the amount of empty space...

241
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,520
in any given object, we can
thereby shrink the object.

242
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,695
Uh-huh. Where's your proof?

243
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,363
When Einstein came up with
the atomic bomb, did they ask

244
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,654
You, Mr. Szalinski,
are hardly Einstein.

245
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:14,241
- I picked a name.
- You have, however,

246
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,623
the size of this audience.

247
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,620
Gentlemen, ladies, I don't know
about you, but I'm going to lunch.

248
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,931
Wayne. Wayne.

249
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,977
- Oh, uh, hi, Dr. Maynard.
- Don't take it too hard, Wayne.

250
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:37,639
It will take time to convince
people without proof.

251
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,814
I appreciate it.
Thanks a lot.

252
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,280
By the way, you were right
about the electric flea collar.

253
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,274
The extension cord was a bad idea.

254
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:52,444
What could be taking them so long?
I am not missing the mall today.

255
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,574
Nick!

256
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,412
- Nick...
- Ron?

257
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,664
it's not funny.

258
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,964
Nick, you know what Dad said.

259
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,094
You're not supposed
to be playing up here.

260
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,935
Where are we?

261
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,035
God, what happened?

262
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,786
- Amy!
- Russ!

263
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:43,330
Amy!

264
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,416
- Nicky.
- Ron?

265
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,335
- Nick, what happened?
- We're all the size of boogers!

266
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,849
Be quiet, Quark!

267
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:02,650
- Nick, what did you do?
- Me? It was his ball!

268
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:04,899
- Shut up, wimp!
- We have to get Dad.

269
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,984
He'll know what to do.

270
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:13,402
Nick, if that's Paul Tate,
I'm gonna kill you.

271
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,785
Can somebody get that?

272
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,584
- What's that?
- It's Dad's thinking couch.

273
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,880
Amy? Nick?

274
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,889
Hello?

275
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,889
It's not for you.

276
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,522
What is it, Quark?

277
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:48,853
Nick!

278
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,856
- Listen.
- Are you guys home?

279
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,191
Sounds like Dad.
He'll fix us.

280
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,858
Mr. Szalinski! Up here!

281
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,528
- Up here, Dad!
- Quick, over there by the door.

282
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,245
- Okay? Get that side.
- Anybody up there?

283
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:03,962
- Nick!
- Get off and give us a hand!

284
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,628
Nick? Amy?

285
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:10,207
Hey, Amy, your date's here.

286
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:13,718
- Oh, gross.
- Watch out for the crack!

287
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,849
Hurry up. He's coming!

288
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:37,697
- Right here!
- Szalinski!

289
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:40,742
- Down here!
- Help!

290
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,794
- Help!
- Help!

291
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,267
Where's my couch?

292
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:09,441
What is he, deaf?

293
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:12,944
Don't you get it?
We're too small. He can't hear us.

294
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:19,405
Dad!

295
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,246
I don't believe this.

296
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,791
What a day.

297
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,841
Ow!

298
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:38,347
This is all your fault!

299
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,341
- Five years...
- No, Dad, it works!

300
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,676
- Szalinski, don't do it!
- No! Mr. Szalinski!

301
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,727
You don't even work!

302
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:50,940
Don't!

303
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,943
- Run!
- Run.

304
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:58,027
Run, Nicky! Keep up!

305
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:02,451
Dad!

306
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:12,371
Stay there!
There's glass everywhere here now.

307
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:20,927
- No!
- Dad! Run, Nicky!

308
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,928
No! Back the other way!

309
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,074
Go!

310
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:43,194
- Help!
- Help!

311
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:54,954
No!

312
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,596
Help! Somebody!

313
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,239
Not now, Quark.

314
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:31,374
Szalinski, do they pick up your trash
the same day they get ours?

315
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,086
Ow! Nick?

316
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:36,338
- I'm over here.
- Then whose arm is this?

317
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:39,177
I don't know, but I'm not waitin'
around to find out. Move over.

318
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:42,096
- Ow! Watch it!
- Look out.

319
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,525
Oh, my God.

320
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,654
Reminds me of the backyard.

321
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:06,328
Something tells me we're
not going fishing this weekend.

322
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:10,031
- That should make you happy.
- Blow it out your shorts, Ron.

323
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,248
Dad can fix us, right, Nick?

324
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:15,123
I... I think so.

325
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:18,464
- Oh, great.
- We just have to get back to the house.

326
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,296
I'm never goin' back to your house!
I'm goin' home.

327
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,140
Come on, Russ.

328
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,396
- Russ?
- Tell me the truth.

329
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,228
- Could your Dad help us?
- Russ! We're supposed to go fishing!

330
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:37,475
Yeah, right!
How are you going, as bait?

331
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,568
What a witch!

332
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,789
Russ, you comin' down, or what?

333
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,003
Well, we can't stay here.

334
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:04,501
Well, I think we should
stick together.

335
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,719
Well, come on.

336
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,971
Nicky!

337
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,043
I don't think we're
in Kansas any more, Toto.

338
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,713
I don't think we're in
the food chain any more, Dorothy.

339
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,680
Come on, Ron.
We're gonna go with them.

340
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:54,310
What? You let a girl
tell you what to do?

341
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,887
Look, Ron, down here,
you're gonna listen to me.

342
00:30:56,982 --> 00:31:01,027
From now on, you're gonna
do what I say! Run!

343
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,873
Great Sir Russell Thompson,
stalking the rogue butterfly.

344
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:23,751
Knock it off, Ron.

345
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,298
We're now a quarter
of an inch tall...

346
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:29,755
and 64 feet from the house.

347
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:33,680
That's the equivalent
of 3.2 miles.

348
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,686
That's a long way,
even for a man of science.

349
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:41,683
Nick, I've got six hours to get home,
get big and get to the mall.

350
00:31:41,777 --> 00:31:43,734
Now get moving!

351
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:50,034
That butterfly had
a wingspan of 42 feet!

352
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:51,281
Nick!

353
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:08,217
Hi.

354
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,804
Hi.

355
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,297
- Guess what I s...
- Look, Diane...

356
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,431
- I sold a house.
- Really? That's great!

357
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,722
Yeah, you know that big estate?
The Boorsteins bought it.

358
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:21,352
I only had to show it
to them 12 times.

359
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:25,439
- How'd your conference go?
- Well, I got a lot of laughs.

360
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:27,687
- Oh, Wayne.
- I failed, Diane.

361
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:32,117
I-I... I'm just gonna get my old job
back, if I can get my old job back.

362
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,574
But from now on,
things are gonna be different.

363
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:36,530
Different.

364
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,623
Right.

365
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:45,961
- Where are the kids?
- I haven't seen them

366
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:50,427
- Well, did you tell
them I was coming home?

367
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:53,715
I see. Oh, they're probably
just at the mall.

368
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:59,217
Do you wanna hear somethin' strange?
My thinking couch is missing.

369
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:02,721
- The one from the attic?
- Yeah.

370
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:14,992
Hey, Ron, this is a lot better than
those nature hikes Dad drags us...

371
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:20,365
Nick, don't you ever
pick up your toys?

372
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:24,207
- What a wimp!
- Been looking for that guy.

373
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:31,459
It's already 1:00.
So much for the mall.

374
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:37,177
What if time shrunk too?
I mean, what if it's hours to us,

375
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,019
Hey, that would be cool.
All my teachers would be retired.

376
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:42,683
Impossible. Time doesn't exist,
except as a...

377
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:46,023
- Oh, no.
- What's a river doing in your yard?

378
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:50,570
It's not a river, dope.
It could be a stream of dog pee,

379
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:55,493
Let's swim it.

380
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:01,829
- Have a ball, baby.
- I'm not swimming in that.

381
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,999
Hey! Hey, if we could
get some rope...

382
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,211
we could make a log bridge!

383
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:12,209
If... If we... If we had some logs.

384
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,515
- Quark!
- Your dog?

385
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,091
- Yeah.
- Quark can't hear us.

386
00:34:21,145 --> 00:34:23,184
Yeah, he can!
Dogs have great ears.

387
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:26,522
If we can get on him, he'll take us
all the way back to the house.

388
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,518
Whistle.

389
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,413
- What's wrong?
- He can't whistle.

390
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:49,420
Let's get higher up.

391
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:56,881
You know how to whistle. You just
put your lips together and blow.

392
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:09,768
From the top of that flower,
we could see over the grass.

393
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,355
Let's climb.

394
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,447
No, Patty, no, no.
There's nothing to worry about.

395
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:25,867
Just have Amy call me if
you hear from her. Thanks.

396
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:29,909
Amy's not at Patty's and Nick's not at
the Koestlers'. I'm gonna call Betsy.

397
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:32,496
Well, they gotta be somewhere.
Did you check next door?

398
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:35,212
At the Thompsons'?
They'd rather be in school.

399
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,432
Nick, be careful.

400
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,438
Yes, Mother.

401
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:50,600
I'll go up with them.

402
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:07,039
It's Quark!

403
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:10,583
- Oh, no.
- What is it, Nick?

404
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:13,790
- It's that stupid cat of theirs!
- Our cat is not stupid.

405
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:17,927
- It just chased Quark away!
- It's Russ' stupid cat!

406
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,802
- Hang on, Nick!
- I can't! I'm slipping!

407
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,598
Nicky!

408
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:29,102
Nicky! Get out of there!

409
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,859
You're allergic to pollen!

410
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:35,560
It's too big!

411
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:37,860
I'm too little to breathe it in!

412
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,409
Diane!

413
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:52,376
Hi, Mae.

414
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:55,547
- We haven't seen you around much lately.
- Well, I've been working a lot.

415
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:58,586
You haven't seen Ronnie
or Russ, have you?

416
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:01,843
You know something?
I can't find Nick and Amy.

417
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,338
If you see them, would you
send them home right away?

418
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:07,102
Oh, sure. Uh, same thing
if you see mine.

419
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:12,478
Russell, the Szalinski kids
are missing too.

420
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:15,235
If they're smart,
they ran away with the circus.

421
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,525
I don't know where they could be.
They know we're leaving.

422
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:19,486
Ronald?

423
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:21,530
Russell?

424
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:28,574
Amy?

425
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,582
Nick?

426
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,794
Amy?

427
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:38,123
- What is it?
- It sounds like Mom.

428
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,584
Sounds more like a swarm of...

429
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:46,555
Bees!

430
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,892
- Amy! Get him off of me!
- Nicky!

431
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:57,142
- Get him away!
- Hold on, Nick!

432
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:01,982
- Russ!
- Nicky!

433
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,992
Nick, give me your hand!

434
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,651
- Nick, hold on!
- Russ!

435
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:13,158
We're never gonna find Russ now.
It's all your stupid Dad's fault!

436
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:16,206
Shut up!
My brother's up there too.

437
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:19,083
Help!

438
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:21,297
Russ, don't let go!

439
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:25,963
Hold on!

440
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,598
Help!

441
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,775
I'm getting worried. I'm gonna go
to the mall and look for the kids.

442
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,574
Why don't you stay here
in case they come back?

443
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,573
Okay.

444
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,701
Hey, Szalinski!

445
00:38:57,379 --> 00:39:00,712
Your lawn's beginning
to look like the Amazon.

446
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:04,844
Yeah. Producing oxygen, Russ.
We've all gotta do our part.

447
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:06,921
You know, the jungles
are receding everywhere.

448
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,224
Dad!

449
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:15,477
- Don't!
- Stop! Stop, please! We're on the bee!

450
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,227
Wh... Where is it? Come on!

451
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,691
- Stop! Don't kill us!
- Dad, don't kill us!

452
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,689
Stop it! Whoa!

453
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:36,455
Hold on, Nick!
We're goin' down!

454
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,836
Wayne...

455
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:49,631
if the Boorsteins come by,
their escrow papers are in my briefcase.

456
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:52,261
You think you can handle that?

457
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:56,479
- There was a bee on me.
- Yeah, right.

458
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:02,601
Wait a second.

459
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:06,070
Nick doesn't play baseball.

460
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,532
I just figured it out.
I never woke up this morning.

461
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:15,531
This is all a bad dream.

462
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:18,541
- Ron, get up.
- You're just a nightmare!

463
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:20,869
When I get up,
Dad and I'll be going fishing.

464
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:23,632
I'm warning you.

465
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:29,546
Okay, Ron.
Maybe you're right.

466
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:33,218
Maybe this is just all a bad dream.

467
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:37,437
- But if it is, would this hurt?
- Ow!

468
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:40,308
Get up!

469
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:42,687
If you were my brother,
I'd put myself up for adoption.

470
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:45,481
Yeah, I hope your face
ends up on a milk carton.

471
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:58,698
My chair.

472
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:02,878
My couch.

473
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,419
It works.

474
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:21,264
Nick? Amy?

475
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,266
Can you hear me?

476
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,061
Nick.

477
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:28,208
Mm-hmm.

478
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,551
Nick.

479
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:43,974
Nick.

480
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:49,687
Nick?

481
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:53,361
Are you okay?

482
00:42:56,493 --> 00:43:00,194
When we crashed, my entire life
flashed before my eyes.

483
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:02,653
It didn't take too long.

484
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:08,665
I'm scared, Russ.

485
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:11,796
We could be anywhere now.

486
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:15,878
- I think we're still in your yard.
- How do you know?

487
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,047
Any other yard,
the grass would be shorter.

488
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,224
Come on. We gotta find
Ron and your sister.

489
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,801
...and he'll go to jail.
Your mother too.

490
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:27,728
After all, she's the one who paid
for it. That makes her an accomplice.

491
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,105
I am gonna tell you
one more time to shut up!

492
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:32,233
And then what?
And then you'll smack me?

493
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:37,486
You'll go to jail too. I'll tell them
after a big bee ate my brother,

494
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:40,245
No jury in the world
would fail to convict you.

495
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:43,365
- The whole Szalinski family's
gonna be in jail for life.

496
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:44,951
My dad's machine works.

497
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,784
When we get home and he fixes us all,
we're gonna be so rich.

498
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,788
You'll regret this.

499
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:55,675
Amy. You know,
I've always liked your family.

500
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:57,676
I mean, your dad's
a real nice guy.

501
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:02,430
He's not as weird as I thought he was,
and I love you and Nick

502
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:25,200
It's just that my dad
doesn't understand your dad.

503
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,248
Your dad doesn't understand anything.

504
00:44:42,975 --> 00:44:45,181
- Amy!
- Ron, where are you?

505
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:50,602
Run, Nick!

506
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,106
Whoa! Oh! Ow!

507
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,872
- Russ! Russ!
- Get up!

508
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:29,516
Get in there!

509
00:45:29,604 --> 00:45:32,060
Get out of there!

510
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:45,906
- Harold.
- Uh, Mr. Szalinski?

511
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:47,989
Get off the grass!

512
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:50,751
Get off the grass!

513
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:57,756
Up there!

514
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:10,342
Nicky!

515
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:20,228
- Amy!
- Get under that ledge!

516
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:02,189
It's very delicate, the lawn.

517
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,196
You don't want
to overwater, really.

518
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:15,495
Get her!

519
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:28,925
Amy?

520
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,108
Get away.

521
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:42,609
Please don't die.

522
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:05,005
Amy.

523
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:48,548
No, Cathy, I just thought
they might have stopped by.

524
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:51,258
Okay, listen. If you see them,
would you send them home?

525
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:53,388
Okay. You have a good weekend.

526
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:59,144
This is getting ridiculous.
Where the hell are those kids?

527
00:49:04,236 --> 00:49:05,695
Oh, no.

528
00:49:11,243 --> 00:49:13,734
You had to bring the dog. I don't want
to hear any more about the cat.

529
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,987
It's the Forresters!
What are we gonna tell 'em?

530
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,040
- How 'bout the truth?
- Mae, what kind of an excuse is that?

531
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:21,330
Don!

532
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:24,755
How 'bout catching some...

533
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,751
- Good morning, Russell.
- Hi, Gloria.

534
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:33,384
Say good morning, Sushi.

535
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:37,471
Well, the fishing report
looks stellar. Let's make exhaust

536
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:40,562
- I called Charlie up at Bass Lake.
- I know.

537
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:45,108
- Don...
- Oh, and I bought my new Fish-matist.

538
00:49:45,193 --> 00:49:47,981
- Right, Gloria.
- Don, uh, something's come up.

539
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:51,238
I don't think
we're gonna be able to make it.

540
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:55,025
What do you... What do you mean you don't
think you're gonna be able to make it?

541
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:57,451
- Donald, I am...
- Not now, Gloria!

542
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:00,244
And besides, if you're not there
by 6:00, you'll lose your deposit.

543
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:01,911
Confidentially...

544
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,127
Mae hasn't been feeling too well.

545
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,755
Plumbing.

546
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:10,420
"Plumbing"?

547
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:14,253
Well, this isn't
the Big Russ Thompson I know.

548
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:17,598
I mean, plumbing would not stop
the Big Russ Thompson I know...

549
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:19,891
especially with
an $80 deposit on the line.

550
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:23,264
Don, hook a big one for me, okay?

551
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,451
Don?

552
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:41,490
- Let's roll, Gloria.
- But, but...

553
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,291
- Come on. Get in.
- What's wrong with them?

554
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:44,657
Come on.

555
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:50,336
Mm-hmm.

556
00:50:57,307 --> 00:51:00,059
- You tell him the truth?
- Honey!

557
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:02,136
- They take it okay?
- Mae.

558
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:09,732
Eighty bucks, Mae!
Non-refundable!

559
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,859
Those kids are grounded!

560
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:22,989
Mud is still mud,
no matter how small you are.

561
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:27,039
I can't believe some stores
actually charge for this stuff.

562
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:34,042
That was really great,
what you did for Nick.

563
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:38,256
What about you, Amy?
He saved you too.

564
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:42,640
Yeah, I know, Nick.

565
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:46,720
Where'd you learn
artificial respiration?

566
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,601
- French class, kid.
- Oh.

567
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:55,315
"French class"?

568
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:16,627
How 'bout a truce, okay?

569
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:20,879
Okay.

570
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:34,146
I think this is the flagstone
in the middle of the yard.

571
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:37,280
- You mean we're halfway there?
- Yeah, I think so.

572
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:38,646
Let's go.

573
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:46,910
French class.

574
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:04,308
I'd die for a strawberry sundae...

575
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:06,848
with chocolate sprinkles,
and a banana split.

576
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:11,305
I could eat a corn dog
the size of a truck.

577
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:15,568
Ron, if you had a corn dog,
it would be the size of a truck.

578
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:21,690
- I've died and gone to heaven.
- It's as big as a house!

579
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:24,241
I saw it first.
It's mine!

580
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,820
I got dibs on the cream filling!

581
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:28,872
Nick, it's one of your cookies!

582
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:40,791
They're never gonna
believe this at school.

583
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:43,805
Yeah, I could just see
the note to the teacher.

584
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:45,349
"Dear Miss Mason:

585
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:48,103
Nicky's not absent.
He's pinned to this note."

586
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:57,646
- Guys, quick! Over here!
- Where?

587
00:53:57,738 --> 00:54:00,311
- Right there.
- Nicky, hurry!

588
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:05,451
If only we had some bug spray.
That'd show him.

589
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:08,538
Quiet.
To him, we're the bugs.

590
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:12,336
If he finds us, he'll eat us.
Let's get out of here.

591
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:16,547
Wait a minute. It's our cookie.
I say we fight for it.

592
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:19,585
- Just one ant.
- When is the last time

593
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:22,208
- He's a scout. The rest of them
will be here any minute.

594
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,796
You ever see how fast ants go?

595
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:29,426
We could ride him and get back
to the house in no time.

596
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,062
Forget it, Nick.

597
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:34,973
Amy, he could take us all.

598
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:38,311
- Ants can lift 50 times their weight.
- 50 times?

599
00:54:38,404 --> 00:54:41,108
That's like bench-pressing
a bulldozer!

600
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:43,736
Yeah, so think of what
he could do to us.

601
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:45,735
Let's go before he brings
the rest of them.

602
00:54:45,827 --> 00:54:48,034
But he can't hurt us.
He's just a baby.

603
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:50,154
Russ?

604
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:56,252
- I say that ant is ours!
- Yeah!

605
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:58,911
Geronimo!

606
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,415
Get him!

607
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:03,384
You guys! Nicky!

608
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,921
- Get him!
- Nicky, you're gonna get hurt!

609
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:08,717
Yee-ha!

610
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,552
- Nick, get over there! Over there!
- You guys...

611
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:13,016
Get behind it!

612
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:16,686
- Get back here, Nicky!
- Watch out!

613
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:22,436
- Look out!
- Nick, the others

614
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:28,193
- Nicky!
- Go, Nick!

615
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:31,991
- Nicky, no! Get off of him!
- Nick, the wrong end!

616
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:35,782
- Nicky, you're allergic to ants.
Get away from him.

617
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:39,373
- Nicky, get away!
- Ron, get on!

618
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:42,584
Hey, Szalinski, look at the head.

619
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:48,630
Ron, go for it!

620
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:51,808
Hey. Hello.

621
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,134
Ant!

622
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,269
Here.

623
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:01,276
Nice ant.
Come on, you guys.

624
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:07,403
You guys, come on.

625
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:10,954
Somebody take this cookie.

626
00:56:10,996 --> 00:56:12,905
Nicky, take this thing!

627
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:16,958
Help! Nicky!

628
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,123
Come on, you guys.
This is your ant.

629
00:56:21,214 --> 00:56:23,421
- Nicky, help me!
- She did it.

630
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:25,715
- Somebody, help me!
- Yeah.

631
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:28,128
- Your sister's not bad.
- Nicky!

632
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:30,214
- For a girl.
- Of course.

633
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:52,869
Quark, sit.
Sit, Quark.

634
00:56:52,954 --> 00:56:55,576
Stop. Sit.
Sit, boy.

635
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,705
Quark, get away from there.

636
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:59,370
Quark. Here, boy.

637
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:02,462
Quark. Quark.

638
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:07,625
Get away, boy. Drop it!

639
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:09,677
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

640
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:12,550
Whoa!

641
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:18,145
Whoa!

642
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:22,275
Thank you, Officer.
We'd appreciate you sending somebody by.

643
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:24,601
Oh, okay, it's 646...

644
00:57:28,698 --> 00:57:31,450
That guy's got serious problems.

645
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,949
<i>Mrs. Thompson? Hello?</i>

646
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:38,074
646 Sycamore. Yes.

647
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:45,121
Great idea, Russ, even if
the boy genius didn't think of it.

648
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,125
Low bridge!

649
00:57:50,262 --> 00:57:52,338
At this rate,
we'll be home by dinner.

650
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:55,388
Maybe I can still go out...

651
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,552
with Patty.

652
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:02,429
Well, our weekend's shot.
We'll never get to go camping now.

653
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:04,813
I know Dad.
We're grounded.

654
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:07,737
We are camping, Ron,
only better.

655
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:10,395
- This is like a safari.
- Hey.

656
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,483
Yeah, I never thought
of it that way, you know.

657
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:14,904
Onward!

658
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:33,879
Amy?

659
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:35,466
Nick!

660
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,594
Wayne?

661
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:51,103
Uh, yeah, um, I would like
to report, um, two missing children.

662
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:53,819
Well, instead of flapping
your gums about it,

663
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:57,076
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
This sort of thing happens all the time.

664
00:58:57,162 --> 00:58:59,368
- You have a little spat with the kids...
- Whoa. We did not have a spat.

665
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:03,578
- You were kind of upset
about Russ quitting the team, hon.

666
00:59:03,669 --> 00:59:06,373
- He was afraid to tell you he quit.
- Quit...

667
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:09,956
What do you mean he was afraid to tell
me? He could tell me anything he wants.

668
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,877
Mm-hmm.

669
00:59:11,968 --> 00:59:13,795
- What's "Uh-huh" supposed to mean?
- Russell.

670
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:17,173
- No, I don't like the way he said it.
- No need to get upset, Mr. Thompson.

671
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:20,931
- You know, it's not unusual
for these runaways to...

672
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:25,432
They are happy kids,
and there's no way you can

673
00:59:25,524 --> 00:59:28,311
There he goes with his writing again.
Don't you ever say anything?

674
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:29,647
Mm-hmm.

675
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:34,114
- Russell!
- Why do I feel like

676
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:36,571
- Can't imagine, dear.
- What do you mean you can't imagine?

677
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,151
Well, I think we have
enough to get started.

678
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:41,950
Please give us a call
if you hear from the boys.

679
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,416
Fine.

680
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:53,756
Don't they need a warrant or something?

681
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:57,295
Russell, there's a few things
about yourself I think you should know.

682
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:02,014
- Well, like what?
- Well, I think you need to sit down.

683
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:07,852
Oh, another missing children report.

684
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:12,484
644 Sycamore.
That's next door.

685
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,196
I've called the police.
What's on your head?

686
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:18,572
- I was looking for the kids.
- Where, in a coal mine?

687
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,949
- They're in the backyard.
- They are?

688
01:00:21,038 --> 01:00:23,030
Diane, I got something
real important to tell you.

689
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:26,697
That is the couch from the attic.

690
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:30,582
You can see the marks
where Quark chewed the arms.

691
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:33,080
It's my thinking couch.

692
01:00:33,175 --> 01:00:34,503
Wayne...

693
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:38,590
Are you trying to tell me...

694
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,507
You did it?

695
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:43,802
It works?
The machine works?

696
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:46,930
- Do the kids know?
- Well, yeah, the kids know.

697
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:49,015
- That's great.
- No, it's not that great.

698
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:51,349
- Why?
- I shrunk the kids.

699
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:53,021
- What?
- And the Thompson kids too.

700
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:55,781
- They're about this big.
They're in the backyard.

701
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:58,616
Threw them out with the trash.

702
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,942
Stay here.
I'll get the door.

703
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:03,411
Yes?

704
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:06,747
Did, uh, you report
some missing children?

705
01:01:07,834 --> 01:01:10,919
Oh, there must be some mistake.
Ours are in the backyard. Right, honey?

706
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:17,385
She's w... Thank you.

707
01:01:20,847 --> 01:01:22,924
Mm-hmm.

708
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:35,519
How ya doin', boy?
How about a pit stop?

709
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:44,657
- What is it, Ron?
- Antie needs a recharge.

710
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:52,957
Here. You deserve this.

711
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:57,088
We're not gonna make it before dark.

712
01:01:58,176 --> 01:02:01,877
Yeah. Even if we did,
the mall would be closed.

713
01:02:01,972 --> 01:02:06,135
Don't eat so fast.
Hey, that's my hand.

714
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:12,764
Why don't we let him go?
He's worn out, and his family

715
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:16,903
- It's okay with me.
- Yeah, me too, I guess.

716
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:18,944
Help me get off the harness.

717
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:30,164
You can go now.

718
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:36,668
Come on. Just start walking.
He'll get the idea.

719
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:41,628
Thanks for the lift, Antie.

720
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:44,962
You're free.
You get home now.

721
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:46,337
Shoo!

722
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:53,345
- Looks like you got a new pet.
- Dumb ant doesn't know

723
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,816
Go on! Go home!
Mom will never let me keep you.

724
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:08,280
Amy? Nick?

725
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:10,364
- Nick?
- Are you there, kids?

726
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:12,450
Nicky.

727
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:14,167
Where are you?

728
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:18,537
- Any luck?
- No.

729
01:03:34,648 --> 01:03:35,976
Nick?

730
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:38,526
Amy?

731
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:47,034
- You see anything yet?
- It's too thick.

732
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,325
It's supposed to be thick.
It's grass.

733
01:03:50,664 --> 01:03:52,953
Keep looking. Nick?

734
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:54,951
Amy?

735
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:03,379
- What was that?
- Ow!

736
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:04,797
Watch out!

737
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:07,968
Come on.

738
01:04:18,317 --> 01:04:20,439
- Ugh.
- Where did that come from?

739
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:30,156
- Yeah, it's Dad's brand.
- He told us he quit.

740
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:37,000
Oof. Looks like
he started up again.

741
01:04:37,085 --> 01:04:39,837
No. He only smokes when he's
really worried about something.

742
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:45,591
Nicky, be careful.

743
01:04:47,512 --> 01:04:49,885
Hey. Hey, maybe we can use this.

744
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:08,486
Cool. Now we can
see in the dark.

745
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:16,948
Hey, Antie, look.
Headlights.

746
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:20,494
- I didn't force him to join the team.
- I know.

747
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:23,257
But you always make
a big deal out of sports.

748
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:27,254
- Because sports build character.
- No, they don't. They build muscle.

749
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:30,214
Russell, you've got to understand.
These kids aren't...

750
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:33,674
- Wayne?
- Yeah?

751
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:35,760
We've got to tell the Thompsons.

752
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:49,859
What do you take me for?
A complete idiot?

753
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:52,275
- How did this happen?
- Hold on a second, Mae.

754
01:05:52,369 --> 01:05:55,453
I'll handle it. All right?
How did this happen?

755
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:58,326
Well, the machine analyzes the
molecular structure of each compound...

756
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:01,204
- and then through laser inversion,
it takes all the...

757
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:03,501
I think the Thompsons
need to see the couch.

758
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:08,165
This guy is a waste of skin.

759
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:12,798
- This is a microscope.
- I know.

760
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:14,880
Look in there.

761
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:17,513
All right.

762
01:06:18,729 --> 01:06:22,347
You see, that's the couch that
used to be sitting right over here,

763
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:24,729
All right, so there's
some doll furniture. Big deal.

764
01:06:24,818 --> 01:06:27,653
They sell that kind of stuff
at swap meets.

765
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:29,647
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

766
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,859
Well, until now,
the machine just blew things up.

767
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:34,944
- Are you saying that that machine...
- Blew up my kids?

768
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:36,317
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, no. No, no.

769
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:40,458
- If the machine had blown up the kids,
there'd be piece of them everywhere.

770
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:45,375
Sorry, I... Look.
I'm positive about this, okay?

771
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:48,465
- The machine shrunk our kids.
- You're the one

772
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:51,919
- Russ.
- You are a nutcase,

773
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:54,550
I have got an air hammer
in my attic...

774
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,139
and if you did do something to my kids,
there's gonna be pieces of you

775
01:06:58,226 --> 01:06:59,685
Come on, honey.

776
01:07:07,277 --> 01:07:09,186
I think that went well.

777
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:11,853
I think we should
have them over more often.

778
01:07:11,948 --> 01:07:14,356
Yeah, well,
it's a priority for me.

779
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:16,444
Now, why don't you do
what you're paid to do?

780
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:19,698
Find my kids.

781
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:34,170
I thought you didn't believe him.

782
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:36,669
Oh, I don't.

783
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:39,892
Electricity's cheap.

784
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:07,121
Come on. Look at this.

785
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:09,121
We don't have to sleep
on the ground.

786
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,918
- What is it?
- One of my Legos.

787
01:08:15,888 --> 01:08:17,298
Give me a boost.

788
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,805
Hey.

789
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:25,813
Not bad.

790
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:31,400
Yeah. I don't even
have to brush my teeth.

791
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:36,318
- Quit pushing!
- Move over.

792
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:39,651
- Why don't you take that one?
- Are you sure?

793
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:42,821
Yeah. I'd rather sleep down here.

794
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:50,920
Night, Antie.

795
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:58,760
- Think they'll be warm enough?
- They look fine to me.

796
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:13,894
You think you'll be warm enough?

797
01:09:20,744 --> 01:09:22,452
Good night, Russ.

798
01:09:24,123 --> 01:09:25,533
Good night, Amy.

799
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:32,838
Good night, Amy.

800
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:37,334
Sorry, boy.
I need the parts.

801
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:39,550
<i>Meow!</i>

802
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:56,320
Are you okay?

803
01:09:57,698 --> 01:09:58,943
I'm scared.

804
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,864
Somehow I feel
like this is all our fault.

805
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:06,864
No, it's my fault.

806
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:11,494
I start working on something, and I...
I don't think about anything else.

807
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:16,297
I should have been more careful
with that thing. I'm sorry.

808
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,676
That's not what I meant.

809
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:24,923
You know, it's not important...

810
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:27,638
if I sell another house...

811
01:10:27,728 --> 01:10:30,016
or if you get a grant
this year or next.

812
01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:34,724
We've just got to get
this family back together.

813
01:10:38,614 --> 01:10:40,405
I feel the same way.

814
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:52,995
I gotta fix the machine.
You should get some sleep.

815
01:10:53,086 --> 01:10:56,040
We've got to get up early
and come out here and look for them.

816
01:10:57,048 --> 01:10:58,507
No, I couldn't sleep.

817
01:11:00,052 --> 01:11:02,091
Not with my babies
out here all alone.

818
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,181
Ah, don't worry about them.
They got the Thompson kids with them.

819
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:07,760
They'll be fine.

820
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:11,262
That's another thing
I'm worried about.

821
01:11:12,147 --> 01:11:14,768
Amy in the dark...

822
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,851
with little Russ Thompson.

823
01:11:16,943 --> 01:11:18,354
Get some rest.

824
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:27,074
They'd better behave themselves.

825
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,541
It's funny.

826
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:36,414
The moon looks the same size
whether you're big or small.

827
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:39,506
Yeah.
Tell that to my dad.

828
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:43,335
Why? Does he pick on you
about your size?

829
01:11:45,014 --> 01:11:46,971
The bigger the guy,
the bigger the moon.

830
01:11:48,016 --> 01:11:50,803
It's just the way he thinks.

831
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:52,554
Russ?

832
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:55,806
- Yeah?
- How come you never came over before?

833
01:11:58,402 --> 01:11:59,860
Well...

834
01:12:03,365 --> 01:12:05,156
I mean...

835
01:12:05,242 --> 01:12:07,400
you talked to me
once or twice last year.

836
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:11,913
I mean, I would have come by.
I wanted to, but...

837
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:16,201
I just always thought
you were too popular to notice me.

838
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,002
I was too popular to notice.

839
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,045
I was stupid.

840
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:47,699
- Get down! Hurry!
- Get down! Hurry!

841
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:49,907
Ron, get down!

842
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:51,323
Run!

843
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:58,411
Russ! Help!

844
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:03,048
- Russ, help!
- Help him!

845
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:04,414
Russ!

846
01:13:05,844 --> 01:13:07,125
Stay here.

847
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:19,435
No!

848
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:24,100
Ron, get out! Quick!
Get away!

849
01:13:35,082 --> 01:13:36,873
- Come on, Ron! Hurry!
- Come on!

850
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:44,920
He-He'll get killed.

851
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:47,499
- We've got to do something.
He's just a baby.

852
01:13:55,561 --> 01:13:58,134
We gotta help him.

853
01:14:11,035 --> 01:14:12,445
Now!

854
01:14:13,245 --> 01:14:15,818
- Get him!
- Get him!

855
01:14:25,132 --> 01:14:27,208
- Let him go!
- Look out!

856
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:34,383
Back!

857
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:53,779
Where's Antie?

858
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:01,538
- Antie!
- There!

859
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,916
Oh, my God.

860
01:15:09,009 --> 01:15:10,966
- He looks hurt.
- No!

861
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,138
You saved my life.

862
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:18,226
No, he's gonna be okay.

863
01:16:40,643 --> 01:16:42,801
Where you going?

864
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:44,305
Nature calls.

865
01:16:52,112 --> 01:16:54,151
Boys on the right,
girls on the left.

866
01:16:55,741 --> 01:16:57,650
I must look absolutely gross.

867
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:24,677
I love you, Wayne Szalinski.

868
01:18:11,107 --> 01:18:13,396
Okay, guys, let's get moving.
Can't be much farther.

869
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:15,893
Can't we sleep just a little longer?

870
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:25,613
Something's very weird here.

871
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:35,707
- What is it?
- Earthquake!

872
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:39,464
No, worse! Lawn mower!

873
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:08,906
Nicky!

874
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:41,227
- What is this?
- I don't know, but I hope

875
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:44,110
This is the burrow of
a <i>Lumbricus terrestris.</i>

876
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:48,115
- A what?
- Earthworm. They're dormant

877
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,749
Plug that in.

878
01:19:53,084 --> 01:19:55,492
We're almost done here.

879
01:19:57,506 --> 01:19:59,499
Is that a chain saw?

880
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:02,261
No, it's more like
our lawn mower, I think.

881
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:14,057
- Tommy, stop the lawn mower!
- Tommy!

882
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:17,942
Tommy, stop!

883
01:20:20,571 --> 01:20:22,148
- Tommy!
- Tommy!

884
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:24,695
- Tommy! Don't go on the grass!
- Tommy, stop... Tom, get over here!

885
01:20:24,783 --> 01:20:26,823
- Tommy!
- Tommy!

886
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,404
One, two, three.

887
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:31,864
Tommy! Tommy!

888
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:37,501
I think we'll be safe in here.

889
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:44,175
Nicky!

890
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:45,921
Come on! Come on!

891
01:20:49,767 --> 01:20:52,340
No! No!

892
01:20:54,604 --> 01:20:56,894
Hold on to me, Russ!

893
01:20:58,608 --> 01:21:00,566
Amy, don't let go!

894
01:21:02,821 --> 01:21:04,446
Amy!

895
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:09,328
- Hold on!
- Give me that thing!

896
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:21,539
- Nick said I could cut it...
- When did you see Nick?

897
01:21:21,632 --> 01:21:24,467
- Did you see him this morning?
- No, it was yesterday.

898
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:26,674
Really, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so late.

899
01:21:26,762 --> 01:21:30,131
It's okay, sweetie, it's okay.
Here. Why don't you go home.

900
01:21:33,393 --> 01:21:34,722
"Safer"?

901
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:41,188
I thought my folks are weird.

902
01:21:47,949 --> 01:21:49,194
My knee.

903
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:52,077
Is everyone okay?

904
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:54,285
I feel like a banana whip.

905
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:04,502
Nick? Nick, are you all right?

906
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:08,464
Nicky!

907
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:15,761
Dad?

908
01:22:17,771 --> 01:22:19,016
Mom!

909
01:22:19,105 --> 01:22:20,897
- Down here!
- Mom! Mom, Dad!

910
01:22:20,982 --> 01:22:23,354
- Dad! We're down here!
- Over here!

911
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:25,899
- Mr. Szalinski!
- Down here!

912
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:28,194
- Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!

913
01:22:43,129 --> 01:22:44,588
We'll make it, Nick.

914
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:46,333
They're never gonna find us.

915
01:22:46,425 --> 01:22:48,998
We were right under their noses,
and they didn't even see us!

916
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:51,252
Don't panic, Ron.
W-We'll f-find a way, okay?

917
01:22:51,347 --> 01:22:54,466
I'm not panicked. Who's panicked?
Nobody's panicked!

918
01:22:57,227 --> 01:22:59,303
Quark!

919
01:22:59,396 --> 01:23:02,101
Come on, everybody!
Grab on!

920
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:05,606
Go inside, Quark!
Find Dad!

921
01:23:26,757 --> 01:23:28,381
Nicky!

922
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:31,427
Quark, what's gotten into you?

923
01:23:34,264 --> 01:23:37,100
- Dad!
- I think he just misses the kids.

924
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:39,260
Dad! Stop!

925
01:23:40,854 --> 01:23:42,348
No!

926
01:23:45,901 --> 01:23:48,024
- Dad!
- I'll tell you, at their size...

927
01:23:48,111 --> 01:23:50,519
- Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!

928
01:23:50,614 --> 01:23:52,606
Giant blades of grass.

929
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:54,359
Huge insects.

930
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:57,951
- It's a jungle out there.
- They're gonna head

931
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:00,867
- It's us!
- Dad!

932
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:03,246
Yeah, you're probably right.

933
01:24:03,334 --> 01:24:04,877
No!

934
01:24:08,715 --> 01:24:10,423
- We're down here!
- Mr. Szalinski!

935
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:13,544
No, Dad!

936
01:24:16,849 --> 01:24:20,763
- Dad!
- No!

937
01:24:20,853 --> 01:24:23,557
- We just gotta keep our eyes open.
- Help!

938
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:25,189
Don't eat me!

939
01:24:29,986 --> 01:24:31,564
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

940
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:35,860
No, Dad! Dad!

941
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:38,074
- It's Nick!
- Oh, Nicky!

942
01:24:38,162 --> 01:24:40,450
- Hi, baby.
- He's pointing at something.

943
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:45,450
- Look! It's the rest of them!
- Yeah!

944
01:24:45,544 --> 01:24:47,453
- Yeah!
- We're saved!

945
01:24:47,546 --> 01:24:50,666
- I'm gonna go get the Thompsons.
- Hang on, kids.

946
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:55,046
It obviously worked on the kids.
I just don't get it.

947
01:24:56,889 --> 01:25:00,672
- Well, you better get it, Szalinski.
- Russ, you're not helping.

948
01:25:00,767 --> 01:25:03,009
- So I'm not helping.
- Russell, you've got to understand...

949
01:25:03,103 --> 01:25:06,104
- these kids aren't you.
- Baseball!

950
01:25:06,189 --> 01:25:08,597
- Nick's trying to say something.
- Baseball!

951
01:25:08,692 --> 01:25:11,266
- I can't make it out.
- Let me see.

952
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:15,360
The baseball, Dad!

953
01:25:15,449 --> 01:25:17,322
What are you saying, Nick?

954
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:23,157
Swinging?

955
01:25:23,248 --> 01:25:25,917
- Sounds like...
- It's semaphore, Mae.

956
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:28,457
Wait. Uh, uh, flapping!

957
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:30,787
- Pitching.
- Um...

958
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:34,000
- You're out! You're out!
- Baseball!

959
01:25:34,092 --> 01:25:37,378
- Dad!
- Right!

960
01:25:37,471 --> 01:25:40,175
- Baseball?
- Good, honey!

961
01:25:42,934 --> 01:25:45,425
Holy smokes.
It's the laser.

962
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:50,020
I got it. The ball
came through the window...

963
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:54,521
and activated the machine,
and they got in the path of the laser.

964
01:25:54,613 --> 01:25:58,029
- Why didn't I think of this before?
- I could take a wild guess.

965
01:25:58,116 --> 01:26:00,868
- Shh.
- It's creating too much heat.

966
01:26:00,953 --> 01:26:03,408
- Thanks, Nick.
- All right, Nicky.

967
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:06,035
- Diane, you take the spoon.
I'll get the machine.

968
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:10,205
This gizmo's been blowing up fruit.
Now, you're not trying it on my kids

969
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:16,173
You know something,
maybe I should do it on myself.

970
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:18,168
- I'll show you how to work
the machine. It's not that hard.

971
01:26:18,262 --> 01:26:22,045
- I'll fix it up. It'll be no trouble.
- No, no! Do it on me.

972
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:23,421
Are you sure, honey?

973
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:30,895
How'd those get there?

974
01:26:45,873 --> 01:26:48,363
Okay, Szalinski, shoot.

975
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:51,619
- No reason this shouldn't work now.
- Huh?

976
01:27:06,727 --> 01:27:09,811
- Stand back.
- Oh, honey, you're so brave.

977
01:27:09,896 --> 01:27:12,304
Come on, Mae. Come on. Come.

978
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:28,866
- Russ, are you okay?
- Yeah. Why?

979
01:27:44,931 --> 01:27:49,510
So, if this works,
you wanna go to the dance on Friday?

980
01:27:51,438 --> 01:27:52,849
Can you dance?

981
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:57,735
- Not really.
- I'd love to.

982
01:28:18,215 --> 01:28:21,169
- Oh!
- Russ! Ron!

983
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:23,667
Oh, I knew my boys
wouldn't run away.

984
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:26,631
Are you and Dad okay?

985
01:28:26,723 --> 01:28:29,511
- Yeah, honey.
...all the way

986
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:31,511
- Really?
- Sorry about the grass stains, Mom.

987
01:28:31,603 --> 01:28:34,059
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'll get 'em out.

988
01:28:34,147 --> 01:28:37,184
He saved me from a giant scorpion.
I was stuck with Amy for a while.

989
01:28:37,275 --> 01:28:39,683
I was right, wasn't I?
It was the ball, wasn't it?

990
01:28:39,778 --> 01:28:42,696
You were right.
You were brilliant.

991
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:47,407
- I wanted to go fishing, Dad.
I didn't mean to mess everything up.

992
01:28:47,494 --> 01:28:50,246
Dad, if you really want me
back on the team...

993
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:52,702
I don't care about the team.
I care about you.

994
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:56,418
- Proud of you.
- I got better.

995
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:59,420
- I need to take a shower.
- Szalinski.

996
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:10,850
- Let's eat.
- Honey, make a toast.

997
01:29:10,934 --> 01:29:12,892
- Good idea.
- Oh, great.

998
01:29:12,978 --> 01:29:15,979
To the Thompsons and the Szalinskis
and many more dinners together.

999
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:19,765
- Cheers.
- Though I think we're going to be

1000
01:29:19,859 --> 01:29:21,437
- I wonder what's
for dinner, right, Russ?

1001
01:29:21,528 --> 01:29:23,853
- Ron?
- Well, I guess I gotta

1002
01:29:23,947 --> 01:29:26,319
- Hey, you wanna use my chain saw?
- Do we have butter?

1003
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:29,279
- Who wants bread?
- Save some room for cake.

1004
01:29:29,369 --> 01:29:32,074
- Oh, we got cake for dessert?
- Yeah.

1005
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,627
Hey, wait!

1006
01:29:40,714 --> 01:29:42,541
I get it!

1007
01:29:42,633 --> 01:29:45,668
French class! Ha-ha!
