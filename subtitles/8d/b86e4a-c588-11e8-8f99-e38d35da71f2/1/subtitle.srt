00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,160
Hi guys

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,920
Glad we get your message

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,760
You'll be interested to hear

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
It was broadcasted live
all over Earth

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,200
Prime time

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,920
The time leg on this
messages is getting longer

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,720
We gather from the ten year delay

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,840
That you are approximately
18 parsecs away

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,960
Drop us a line more often, o'k?

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,600
Sorry to hear about the
radiation leack on ship

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,840
And real sorry to hear about
the death of commander Powell

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,240
It was the week of mourning
here on Earth

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,360
The flags were half mast

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,560
We all behind you guys

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,440
About your request
for radiation shielding

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,760
Sorry to report, this request
has been denied

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,400
I hate to send bad news

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,520
When you guys are up there
doing such a swell job

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,520
But I think you'll take it
in the proper spirit

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
It been some cut backs in the
congress and right now

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,720
Considaring the distance
we just can't afford

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
To send a cargo shuttle
out there to you

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,760
But I know

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,400
You guys will make to

25
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,400
Keep up the good work men

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,400
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,600
I still can't hear you

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
I said I'm trying to reach Talby

29
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,200
Something's wrong
with the damn intercom

30
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,200
I need a last-minute
diameter approximation

31
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:06,920
Talby

32
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,960
Talby, this is Doolittle

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,680
Talby!

34
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,200
Talby, do you read me?

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,360
Talby!

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,080
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle What is it?

37
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,560
I need a diameter approximation

38
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,200
Okay, Doolittle,
I'll have it in a minute

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,720
I need a GHF reading on
the gravity correction

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,520
I'll check it

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,440
Pinback

42
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,040
Yes, Doolittle

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,640
Your GHF reading
is minus fifteen

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,120
Doolittle

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,480
Yes

46
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,520
I need a computer reading
on a fail- safe mark

47
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,440
In a second

48
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
Boiler, can you set me up
with some temp figures?

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,000
Ninety seven million, minus eight,
corrected to mass critical.

50
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,920
I read that with
a quantum increase of seven.

51
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Pinback, I have a computer reading
of nine five seven seven.

52
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,440
Time to start talking.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
Bomb bay systems operational.

54
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,080
Lock fail safe.

55
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,120
Fail-safe locked.

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,480
Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #19.
Do you read me, bomb?

57
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,160
Bomb #19 to Sergeant Pinback,
I read you. Continue.

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,520
Well, bomb, we have about
60 seconds to drop.

59
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,600
Just wondering
if everything is all right.

60
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,000
Have you checked your platinum
euridium energy shielding?

61
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
Energy shielding
positive function.

62
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,200
Swell.

63
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,760
Let's synchronize detonation time.

64
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,320
Do you know when
you're supposed to go off?

65
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Detonation in 6 minutes,
20 seconds.

66
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,400
All right, that cheks out here

67
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,880
Arm yourself, bomb.

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Armed.

69
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,040
Well, then, everything sounds fine.

70
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,880
We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds
Good luck.

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,640
Thanks.

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,760
Begin main sequence.

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Mark at 10-9-8

74
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,360
7-6-5-4

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
.3-2-1, drop

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Hyperdrive sequence begun.
Hit it, Pinback.

77
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,440
Lieutenant Doolittle,
it just exploded.

78
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,880
Ah, the planet just exploded, sir.

79
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,520
Lieutenant?

80
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,680
Attention, attention.
Ship computer to all personal

81
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,880
The hyperdrive sequence
is now terminated.

82
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,760
The target planet
has been destroyed

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,200
This sector is now clear
for colonialization

84
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,720
You had destroyed the last
unstable planet in this system

85
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,280
Congratulation with another
sucsesfull bombing fellas

86
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,520
What now?

87
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,400
What do you have
for us now, Boiler?

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,120
Not much.
Nothing at all in this sector.

89
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,480
Find me something,
I don't care where it is

90
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,680
Well, I show a 95% probability of
intelligent life in the Horsehead Nebula sector

91
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,680
Don't give me that kind of bull

92
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,000
Well, it is kind of a long shot...

93
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,200
It's a goddamn wild goose chase.

94
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,200
Remember when Commander Powell
found that 99 plus probability

95
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,040
Of intelligent life
in the Magellanic Cloud?

96
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Well, there's the possibility of...

97
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,160
Remember what we found?

98
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,720
God damn, mindless vegetable that
looked like a limp balloon

99
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Fourteen light years for a vegetable
that went squawk

100
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,520
and let a fart when you touched it
remember that?

101
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,400
All right, then...

102
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,840
So don't give me any of that life stuff
find me somthing I can blow up

103
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
New star.

104
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,400
Hey, guess what?
I got a new star on the readout.

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,640
Which one?

106
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,920
Another unknown.
A red dwarf, not on the charts.

107
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,640
Any planets?

108
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,200
Yeah. Eight, it says here

109
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,760
Any of 'em any good?

110
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,920
Naah. All stable.

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
What are you gonna name it?

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,800
What?

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
The new star.
What are you gonna name it?

114
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,440
Who cares. Don't bother me.

115
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,080
Commander Powell would have named it.

116
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,240
Commander Powell is dead.

117
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,560
Hey, Doolittle, I got a goodie

118
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,360
An unstable planet

119
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,520
85% probability of an unstable
planet in the Veil Nebula

120
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,400
That will probably go off
its orbit and hit a star

121
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,920
Wanna blow it up?

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Real good Boiler
That is what I'm looking for

123
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,800
Chart a course for the Veil Nebula

124
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,520
Pinback, throw me the chart log

125
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Let's have some music in here, Boiler

126
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,040
Sure thing

127
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,320
Ship's log, entry number 1,943

128
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,400
Dark Star cruising at light speed
through Sector Theta 990

129
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,040
En route to Veil Nebula
for destruction of unstable planet

130
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,920
Our ETA is 17 hours

131
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,600
Ship's systems continue to deteriorate...

132
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,040
Oh, yeah

133
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,720
The short circuit in the rear seat panel
which killed Commander Powell is still faulty

134
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,440
The storage...

135
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,600
Because he's sitting next to commander Powell sit,
it continues to bother Pinback

136
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,640
Storage Area 9
self-destructed last week

137
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,000
Destroying entire ship's supply
of toilet paper

138
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
That's all

139
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,320
Attention, Attention

140
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,560
Ships computer calling all personnel

141
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,720
I must disengage
your recreation of music

142
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,360
Repeat.
Ships computer to all personnel

143
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,800
This is an emergency override

144
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,160
All systems must stand by

145
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,680
An asteroid storm is approaching
the ship on collision course

146
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,080
This asteroid storm appears to be bound together
by electro-magnetic energy vortex

147
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,320
Like the one we ran in
to two years ago

148
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,480
Normally I wouldn't bother you boys,
but this problem...

149
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,120
As you recall my defensive circuits
were destroyed at the storm

150
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,640
Therefore, you have 35 seconds
to manualy activate all defensive systems

151
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,840
Computer to bobm no. 20
Return to the bomb bay immediatly

152
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,520
But I received
the operational signal

153
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,440
This is a malfunction
this is not a bomb alert

154
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,720
We are in the crisis situation
return imediatly

155
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,520
Nevertheless, I have received the signal
to prepair for a drop

156
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,240
Emergency override.
Return to the bay

157
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,000
Very well

158
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,880
We made it.
Yeah

159
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,760
Atention, atention
ships computer to bridge

160
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,000
There was a malfunction on board ship
during the asteroid storm

161
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,560
I have not yet identified
the nature of the problem

162
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,240
Should I contact you when I find out
what the malfunction is?

163
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,120
Yeah, lets get out of here

164
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,000
I remember the last time
we were in asteroid storm

165
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,400
I was down in the
food locker to get a sandwich

166
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,800
When I heard
the damn sleeping corders blow up

167
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,600
Yeah

168
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,200
Say, you know guys,
if we really wanna to

169
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,520
We can fix up the sleeping corders
like they were before

170
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,960
Then we can sleep on real
automatic bunks again

171
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,200
Fellas, why won't we fix the sleeping corders
so we'll have a decent place to sleep again

172
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,400
All we got to do is to pack up the hole in the ship
and pop up some air bags again

173
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,200
Shut up Pinback
Oh, have it your own way

174
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,680
What's a matter with him?

175
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,600
Talby

176
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,440
Here's some breakfast

177
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,600
You know, Talby, you really
ought to eat with the rest of us.

178
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,200
You spend
too much time up here.

179
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
I like it up here.

180
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,120
Must get lonely
being up here so much.

181
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,520
I don't like to go below
since Commander Powell died.

182
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,920
I feel enclosed down there.

183
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,320
You should spend
some time below, I mean...

184
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,440
You know, see more
of the rest of the ship

185
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,800
You see, I can watch
things up here, Doolittle

186
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,160
I love to watch things

187
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,480
Just stare at the planets and meteors,
gas clusters and asteroids

188
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:13,025
Yeah, but You'll have plenty of time
for that later, you know.

189
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:16,967
I mean think of it this way,
we've been in space for 20 years now, right?

190
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:19,206
And we've only aged three years

191
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:22,194
so there'll be plenty of time later off
to staring around

192
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:28,157
You know, Doollttle, if we're going
into the Veil Nebula

193
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:31,434
we may actually find a strange
and beautiful thing

194
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:34,189
The Phoenix Asteroids

195
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:37,733
They should be passing
through there about now...

196
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:42,523
Phoenix Asteroids?
Never heard of 'em.

197
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:48,473
They are a body of asteroids that
circuit the universe once every 12.3 trillion years

198
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:52,021
The Phoenix Asteroids...

199
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:56,102
From what I've heard, Doolittle,
they glow...

200
00:24:56,552 --> 00:24:59,192
Glow with all the colors of the rainbow

201
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:01,573
Nobody knows why.

202
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:07,011
They just glow as they
drift around the universe

203
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,494
The Phoenix Asteroids...

204
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,987
You know what I think about, Talby?

205
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:20,764
It's funny, but I kind of sit around a lot,
you know, a lot of time for myself...

206
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:25,744
I can't talk to the others

207
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:29,841
but with time to myself,
I can think about back home

208
00:25:31,557 --> 00:25:33,698
back home at Malibu

209
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,507
I used to surf a lot, Talby.
I used to be a great surfer.

210
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:45,782
The waves at Malibu and Zuma
are so fantastic in the spring, Talby

211
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:51,279
I can remember running down on the beach
in the early spring mornings with my surf board and my wet suit.

212
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:56,821
The waves were really be peaking,
you know high and glassy. Hit that water

213
00:25:57,318 --> 00:26:02,253
Before you know it, you coming down right on up one of this walls,
and you just ride it perfectly

214
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,232
You know, I guess I miss the waves
and my board more than anything

215
00:26:52,217 --> 00:26:54,268
That's the lid
to the heating unit

216
00:27:20,603 --> 00:27:22,790
You not suppose
to get that out

217
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:29,396
That's not for target practice
that's for emergency only

218
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:41,604
That's dangerous!

219
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,490
I'll tell Doolittle

220
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:55,216
Sorry to interupt
your recreation fellows

221
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:58,637
But it is time for sergeant Pinback
to feed the alien

222
00:27:58,654 --> 00:28:01,213
Oh, I don't wanna do that

223
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:07,710
May I remind you sergeant Pinback, that it was
your idea in the first place to bring the alien on board

224
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:11,852
If I may quote you, you said
the ship needed a mascot

225
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:26,491
All right, where are you?
Come on, quit playing around

226
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,877
Get away!

227
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:49,372
When I brought you on the ship
I Thought you where qute

228
00:28:51,753 --> 00:28:53,778
Allright, soup's on

229
00:28:57,313 --> 00:28:59,562
We didn't have another stuff

230
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,595
Here, eat it!

231
00:29:02,918 --> 00:29:04,074
Eat it!

232
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:06,979
Take it or leave it

233
00:29:15,032 --> 00:29:16,882
Great, starve

234
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,680
I do all the work in here
and no appreciation

235
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:38,943
Get off me!
Get off my back!

236
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,262
Get back in there!

237
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:05,533
Come on,
come on!

238
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:14,937
Here boy,
want your mouse?

239
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:18,540
Nice mouse, pretty toy
want your mouse?

240
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:33,577
Get in!

241
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:47,539
Get out from there!

242
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,780
No!

243
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,551
Get in!

244
00:36:35,924 --> 00:36:38,504
Attention, attention

245
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:42,338
Central track elevator shaft
is now activated

246
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:45,204
All personal
please clear the area

247
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:22,661
Attention, attention
elevator descending

248
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:24,718
Please clear the shaft

249
00:39:51,662 --> 00:39:53,083
Help!

250
00:40:53,736 --> 00:40:55,578
I'm getting somthing here
on the readout

251
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:22,318
Ship's computer
calling bomb number 20

252
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,290
You out of bomb bay again

253
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:27,028
I recieved the signal
to prepare for the drop again

254
00:41:27,203 --> 00:41:30,610
But I repeat
this is not a bomb run

255
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,228
Nevertheless
I recieved the signal

256
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:34,476
It is an error

257
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:36,419
Oh, I don't want to hear that

258
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:39,734
I strongly suggest
you return to the bomb bay

259
00:41:39,735 --> 00:41:41,658
That is contrary
to my programming

260
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,947
Allow me to explain

261
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:47,892
One of the communication lasers
has sustain damage

262
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:52,344
This has temporary inactivated
my damage tracing circuit

263
00:41:52,662 --> 00:41:55,713
You have definetly
recieved a false signal

264
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,100
Please return to the bomb bay
while I identify the source of the problem

265
00:42:02,107 --> 00:42:05,270
Oh, allright
but this is the last time

266
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:13,763
Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this
readout, but can't pinpoint exactly

267
00:42:14,853 --> 00:42:16,033
Don't worry about it

268
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:19,001
We'll find out what it is
when it goes bad

269
00:42:19,152 --> 00:42:23,476
I really think we should try and locate it immediately.
Might be something important.

270
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:26,102
You know

271
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:29,949
I wish I had my
board with me right now

272
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:34,497
Even if I could just ..
wax it once in awhile

273
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:15,661
Help

274
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,895
I'm sorry
this telephone is out of order

275
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:22,106
Please report
the damage at once

276
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:32,333
For your listening enjoyment we now
present "The Barber of Seville" by Rossini

277
00:46:10,005 --> 00:46:14,109
Good for you,
you decided to clean the elevator

278
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:18,306
Cleaning service the
electro-magnetic coil from the bottom

279
00:46:18,307 --> 00:46:22,148
It is necessary to jug this
in the access plate in the floor

280
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:27,044
To remove the floor plate
please press button number 1

281
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:40,266
Attention, danger

282
00:46:40,718 --> 00:46:44,996
Automatic charges will now blow
the explosives forks in the floor plate unit

283
00:46:45,925 --> 00:46:49,225
The plate will disengage
from the floor in 5 seconds

284
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:52,539
Please leave the elevator immediatly

285
00:46:53,153 --> 00:46:58,342
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...

286
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:09,732
Now it's time to go sleepy by
you worthless peace of garbage

287
00:48:40,683 --> 00:48:43,109
So then it's just flew across
the room like a baloon

288
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,844
I guess it was
just full with gas

289
00:48:45,045 --> 00:48:47,762
Hey guys, how could it live
if it was just full with gas

290
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:49,904
I wonder what we
get to eat today

291
00:48:50,105 --> 00:48:53,332
I thought I was gonna die
I was hanging on the elevator for 20 minutes

292
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,571
Probably chicken again

293
00:48:54,572 --> 00:48:57,592
I thought we saved the ship
that thing is done some damage

294
00:48:57,793 --> 00:48:59,350
I'm really sick of chicken

295
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:02,218
Well if you don't care I just
won't talk about it anymore

296
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:04,661
Hey, that's sounds
like a fine idea, Pinback

297
00:49:06,718 --> 00:49:08,079
Chicken

298
00:49:09,635 --> 00:49:11,260
Oh, ham

299
00:49:18,794 --> 00:49:21,391
- Chicken?
- No, ham

300
00:49:29,906 --> 00:49:34,481
- Hey, Doolitle
- Yeah?

301
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:40,278
You think we'll ever find any
real intelligent life out there

302
00:49:41,382 --> 00:49:42,465
Out where?

303
00:49:42,514 --> 00:49:45,717
You know,
Veil nebula

304
00:49:47,536 --> 00:49:49,153
Who cares?

305
00:50:14,301 --> 00:50:16,950
Did I told you guys
how I've got to this mission?

306
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,468
Did I ever told you?

307
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,339
First spring, see ...

308
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:25,556
I wasn't an astronaut
in the begining, see ...

309
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:30,759
You have to score 700 on the test
for the officer's course

310
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,793
And I made ... 58

311
00:50:33,195 --> 00:50:37,480
They put me on the ...
flicker fuel mainmast, on the launch pad

312
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:44,125
He told us this
four years ago. didn't he?

313
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:48,366
No, I think it was four years ago

314
00:50:50,892 --> 00:50:52,218
That's what I said

315
00:50:52,525 --> 00:50:55,934
And this astronaut
came running out, he was ...

316
00:50:56,247 --> 00:50:58,929
He was half naked
and had a starsuit in his hands

317
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,968
So I assume that he was insane

318
00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:05,281
And he ..
throws his starsuit on the ground

319
00:51:05,282 --> 00:51:09,100
And .. jumps into
on of my vats of liquid fuel

320
00:51:09,722 --> 00:51:11,847
Which is very dangerous

321
00:51:12,526 --> 00:51:15,337
Well, I was pretty shocked
I can tell you

322
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,892
I didn't know
what to make of it

323
00:51:16,893 --> 00:51:21,013
Astronauts were all suppose to be
mentally stable, and here this guy comes along

324
00:51:21,118 --> 00:51:23,411
And jumps into my fuel tank

325
00:51:24,086 --> 00:51:26,541
Well actually I was
gonna try to save him, so...

326
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:31,079
What I did was put on his starsuit
for protection, and then I was going to leap into the vat

327
00:51:31,511 --> 00:51:33,583
You guys, see ..

328
00:51:34,479 --> 00:51:36,015
So what happen was ...

329
00:51:36,016 --> 00:51:38,726
So before I could leap into the vat
this other guy came running along

330
00:51:38,727 --> 00:51:40,701
And he says:
Hey, sergeant Pinback

331
00:51:40,702 --> 00:51:43,936
- You got to board immediatly
becouse we gonna launch you in a 20 minutes

332
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:46,795
And I tried to tell him that
I wasn't really sergeant Pinback

333
00:51:46,796 --> 00:51:49,465
But I forgot how to make
a helmet radio work

334
00:51:51,992 --> 00:51:53,403
Funny hap

335
00:51:53,941 --> 00:51:57,602
You know
I'm sure it was four years ago

336
00:51:59,076 --> 00:52:00,285
Maybe

337
00:52:55,932 --> 00:52:58,204
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby

338
00:53:00,161 --> 00:53:01,361
Lieutenant?

339
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,382
Yes, Talby, what is it?

340
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:05,174
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir

341
00:53:05,175 --> 00:53:07,840
but I'm in the Computer Room
and I've located the malfunction

342
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,387
The scanner shows to be a brake
in the communications laser

343
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,322
Down by the Emergency Air Lock

344
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:17,426
I can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going
down there with a starsuit and see if I can find it.

345
00:53:17,831 --> 00:53:19,703
Ok, sounds good Talby, look ..

346
00:53:19,704 --> 00:53:21,905
Somthing important comes up
you let me know

347
00:53:25,357 --> 00:53:28,039
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here
with the rest of us?

348
00:53:30,345 --> 00:53:32,500
He just likes it up in the dome
that's all

349
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:42,563
Tell me ..
What's Talby's first name?

350
00:53:51,992 --> 00:53:54,190
What's my first name?

351
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:37,115
This statement is for posterity

352
00:54:37,618 --> 00:54:40,320
I just want to say
that I'm not sergeant Pinback

353
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:44,280
My real name is Bill Frug
and I'm fuel mainmast technician

354
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,628
I've been on this mission now
for one year and three month

355
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:51,991
Pinback's uniform do not fit me
the underwear is too loose

356
00:54:51,992 --> 00:54:55,303
I do not belong on this mission
and I want to return to Earth

357
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,677
Commander Powell died today

358
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,987
We were going in the hyperdrive

359
00:55:06,724 --> 00:55:09,654
And ...
well he seats right next to me

360
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,390
Well ..
some went wrong with the ..

361
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,992
When we came out of the hyperdrive
his seat had blown up and he is dead

362
00:55:23,749 --> 00:55:27,174
Doolittle said that he is assuming command
on this ship, and I said it's ..

363
00:55:27,175 --> 00:55:30,558
I say he is exceeding his authority, because
I'm the only one with the objectivity on this ship

364
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,071
And I sould be the one
who assumes command

365
00:55:32,072 --> 00:55:34,970
I'm filing a report on this
to the headquarters, this is lot of ...

366
00:55:40,013 --> 00:55:42,539
Yelled up at Doolittle
in the hall today

367
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,768
I said ...

368
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,608
He said ...

369
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:00,004
And I said, well ...

370
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:06,729
And he didn't get it

371
00:56:08,455 --> 00:56:11,101
This mission just falling apart
since commander Powell died

372
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:12,733
Doolittle treats me like an idiot

373
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:14,926
It is because he so smart

374
00:56:14,927 --> 00:56:17,032
And Boiler punches me in the arm
when no one is looking

375
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:18,817
I'm tired of being treated
like an old work rat

376
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:37,202
I do not like the man
on this space ship

377
00:56:37,771 --> 00:56:41,275
They are uncouth and failed
to appreciate my better qualities

378
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:46,057
I have something of value to contribute to this
mission, if they would only recognise it

379
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:51,190
Today over lunch I tried to improve moral
and build a sense of camaraderie among the man

380
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:55,130
By holding a humorous round robin discussion
of the early days of the mission

381
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:58,421
My overtures were brutally rejected

382
00:56:59,057 --> 00:57:01,434
These man do not want a happy ship

383
00:57:01,928 --> 00:57:05,924
They are deeply sick and try to
compensate by making me feel miserable

384
00:57:07,435 --> 00:57:09,420
Last week was my birthday

385
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,671
Nobody even said
happy birthday to me

386
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:16,718
Some day this tape will be played
then they will feel sorry

387
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:39,214
Attention, attention

388
00:57:39,432 --> 00:57:42,029
I have finally identified the malfunction

389
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:45,908
Communications laser
number 17 has been damaged

390
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:49,131
This evidently happened
during the asteroid storm

391
00:57:49,278 --> 00:57:55,226
If you recall, this laser monitors the jets
and primer on the bomb drop mechanism

392
00:57:55,637 --> 00:58:00,373
Communications laser number 17
is located in the emergency air lock

393
00:58:00,808 --> 00:58:06,460
It is crucial to attend this malfunction
before engaging primery sequence

394
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:10,951
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions.

395
00:59:00,075 --> 00:59:01,844
Here she is

396
00:59:02,113 --> 00:59:05,358
Definite 99% - plus probability

397
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:11,940
that the planet will deviate from its normal orbit
in another twelve thousand rotations

398
00:59:12,918 --> 00:59:15,602
It will spiral in toward its sun, and...

399
00:59:15,603 --> 00:59:17,306
Eventual supernova

400
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:19,055
Sounds good, let's vaporize it

401
00:59:21,904 --> 00:59:24,028
Bomb bay systems operational

402
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:44,993
Lock fail safe

403
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:49,223
Fail safe in lock

404
00:59:49,224 --> 00:59:55,088
We have 8 minutes to drop
24 minutes to detonation

405
00:59:56,645 --> 00:59:59,916
This is sergeant Pinback
calling Bomb # 20

406
01:00:01,379 --> 01:00:02,843
Do you read me, bomb?

407
01:00:02,944 --> 01:00:07,479
Bomb #20 to sergeant Pinback
roger, I read you, continue

408
01:00:08,334 --> 01:00:11,245
You are now in the emergency Air Lock

409
01:00:12,612 --> 01:00:18,905
Please remember that in emergency situation
the Surface Door can be opened instantly

410
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,410
Without prior depressurization

411
01:00:21,611 --> 01:00:25,043
So be sure to wear
your starsuit at all times

412
01:00:26,197 --> 01:00:29,518
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions

413
01:01:14,112 --> 01:01:16,948
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?

414
01:01:17,539 --> 01:01:19,086
Sh, Talby, don't bother me

415
01:01:19,287 --> 01:01:23,264
But I think this is important, sir
I think I've found the malfunction

416
01:01:23,523 --> 01:01:26,379
- I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
- Not now

417
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,819
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and..

418
01:01:29,845 --> 01:01:31,784
Four minutes to drop, bomb

419
01:01:31,785 --> 01:01:34,686
Have you checked your platinum
euridium energy shield?

420
01:01:34,973 --> 01:01:37,106
Energy shielding positive function

421
01:01:37,483 --> 01:01:41,071
- Remember the detonation time?
- Detonation in twenty minutes

422
01:01:41,772 --> 01:01:43,608
Allright, that cheks out here

423
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,213
Okay bomb, arm yourself.

424
01:01:47,448 --> 01:01:48,518
Armed

425
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:51,866
Hello? Lieutenant Doolittle, hello!

426
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,643
Hello, can you read me?

427
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:03,876
Communications Laser #17
monitoring the bomb drop mechanism

428
01:02:04,077 --> 01:02:08,059
Has now been activated
and will switch into a test mode

429
01:02:09,247 --> 01:02:11,348
If you will look near the Surface Door

430
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:15,599
You will see that the Parallax
Receptor Cell has been engaged

431
01:02:17,682 --> 01:02:22,481
The laser will now energize
Please stand clear of the path of the beam

432
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:29,194
Communications Laser #17 is now on test

433
01:02:29,195 --> 01:02:32,994
Under no circumstances
enter the path of the beam

434
01:02:33,268 --> 01:02:36,099
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions

435
01:02:36,743 --> 01:02:39,357
Well, everything sounds fine

436
01:02:39,658 --> 01:02:42,841
Dropping you off in 75 seconds
Good luck

437
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:43,639
Thanks

438
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:47,508
I got quantum reading of 35

439
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:49,891
I read the same here

440
01:02:50,673 --> 01:02:51,655
Doolittle

441
01:02:53,276 --> 01:02:54,298
Doolittle?

442
01:02:55,543 --> 01:02:57,077
I don't know if you can hear me

443
01:02:57,078 --> 01:02:59,789
But I'm going to try to adjust
the cue switch on the laser

444
01:03:03,882 --> 01:03:06,811
Well... here goes...

445
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:28,277
My eyes, my eyes!
I can't see!

446
01:03:28,378 --> 01:03:32,533
Attention, attention
the laser has malfunctioned

447
01:03:32,634 --> 01:03:35,922
Under no circumstances
enter the path of the beam

448
01:03:35,923 --> 01:03:37,585
To do so will cause immediate...

449
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:47,347
Begin primery sequence

450
01:03:52,168 --> 01:04:04,917
Mark at 10-9-8-
7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop

451
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:07,560
Negative drop

452
01:04:10,524 --> 01:04:12,800
Just sits there in bomb bay
Try it again Pinback

453
01:04:20,396 --> 01:04:26,557
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.

454
01:04:28,548 --> 01:04:29,480
Negative drop

455
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:52,249
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.

456
01:04:52,515 --> 01:04:55,055
Drop, drop!

457
01:04:57,588 --> 01:05:01,003
Sittin' there
The damn thing just sittin' there

458
01:05:11,877 --> 01:05:14,137
This is lieutenant Doolittle
calling bomb #20

459
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:16,058
I repeat my previous order

460
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:19,009
You are to disarm yourself
and return to the bomb bay immediately

461
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:20,049
Do you understand?

462
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:23,622
I am programmed to detonate in
14 minutes 30 seconds

463
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:26,361
Detonation will occur
at the programmed time

464
01:05:26,562 --> 01:05:28,358
Bomb, this is Doolittle

465
01:05:28,459 --> 01:05:31,897
You are not to detonate, repeat,
you are not to detonate in the bomb bay

466
01:05:31,898 --> 01:05:34,753
Disarm yourself
This is an order!

467
01:05:35,054 --> 01:05:39,176
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle
but I am programmed to detonate in 14 minutes

468
01:05:39,177 --> 01:05:41,554
Detonation will occur
at the programmed time

469
01:05:44,933 --> 01:05:46,704
14 minutes to detonation

470
01:05:47,426 --> 01:05:52,077
Attention, attention
I have sustained serious damage

471
01:05:53,063 --> 01:05:54,930
Please pay close attention

472
01:05:55,639 --> 01:05:57,776
The bomb has malfunctioned

473
01:05:58,232 --> 01:06:00,925
I have activated
automatic dampers

474
01:06:00,926 --> 01:06:05,250
Wich will confine the explosion
to an area one mile in diameter

475
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:09,477
This is all I can do at this time
it's up to you now

476
01:06:21,962 --> 01:06:23,512
It's only one thing I can do

477
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:29,159
I'll have to ask Commander Powell
I'll have to ask him what to do.

478
01:07:35,832 --> 01:07:39,752
Commander Powell. Commander Powell
this is Doolittle, can you hear me?

479
01:07:45,571 --> 01:07:47,151
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle

480
01:07:47,352 --> 01:07:50,384
Something serious is come up
I have to ask you a question

481
01:07:51,011 --> 01:07:53,985
I'm glad you've come
to talk with me, Doolittle

482
01:07:54,515 --> 01:07:58,526
It's been so long since anyone
has come to talk with me

483
01:07:58,527 --> 01:08:00,528
Commander, sir
we have a big problem

484
01:08:00,529 --> 01:08:05,882
The Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb #20, it's stuck
It won't drop out of the bomb bay

485
01:08:05,983 --> 01:08:09,647
It refuses to listen
and it plans on detonating in...

486
01:08:10,563 --> 01:08:12,225
Less than 11 minutes

487
01:08:13,283 --> 01:08:17,600
- Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
- What's that, sir?

488
01:08:19,186 --> 01:08:23,416
Tell me, Doolittle
How are the Dodgers doing?

489
01:08:27,209 --> 01:08:28,571
The Dodgers, ah...

490
01:08:29,174 --> 01:08:32,233
They.. they broke up
they disbanded over 15 years ago

491
01:08:32,736 --> 01:08:35,845
Ah... pity, pity...

492
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:39,369
But you don't understand, sir
we can't get the bomb to drop

493
01:08:39,903 --> 01:08:42,564
Ah, so many malfunctions...

494
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:47,030
Why don't you have anything nice
to tell me when you activate me?

495
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:52,051
Oh, well, did you try
the azimuth clutch?

496
01:08:52,052 --> 01:08:53,757
Yes sir, negative effect

497
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:57,265
- What was that, Doolittle?
- Negative effect

498
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,752
- It didn't work?
- That's correct, sir

499
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:01,919
Sorry, Doolittle

500
01:09:02,489 --> 01:09:07,245
I've forgotten so much
since I've been in here. So much.

501
01:09:07,346 --> 01:09:10,139
What should we do, sir?
The time is running out.

502
01:09:11,058 --> 01:09:14,134
Well, what you might try is...

503
01:09:15,466 --> 01:09:17,071
Commander, hello?
Come in

504
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,719
Commender Powell, hello

505
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,673
Doolittle, hello?

506
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:23,844
Sorry, sir, you faded out
there for little while

507
01:09:23,845 --> 01:09:24,845
- Sorry

508
01:09:24,931 --> 01:09:26,715
What was that you are saying
about the bomb?

509
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,962
It seems to me...

510
01:09:30,765 --> 01:09:34,232
Sorry, I've got a blank

511
01:09:35,161 --> 01:09:36,042
Hold it

512
01:09:37,175 --> 01:09:39,383
I'll have it again in just a minute

513
01:09:40,494 --> 01:09:45,160
I forget so many things in here
so many things

514
01:09:45,757 --> 01:09:48,174
Hold on, just a minute

515
01:09:48,508 --> 01:09:49,641
Let me think...

516
01:09:52,806 --> 01:09:55,956
But you can't explode in the bomb bay
Couse it's foolish

517
01:09:55,957 --> 01:09:58,458
You'll kill us all
There's no reason for it

518
01:09:58,754 --> 01:10:01,046
I am programmed
to detonate in 9 minutes

519
01:10:01,247 --> 01:10:03,856
Detonation will occur
at the programmed time

520
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:05,997
Would you consider
another course of action

521
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:08,679
For example just waiting around
a while so we can disarm you?

522
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:09,531
No

523
01:10:09,732 --> 01:10:12,180
I can tell, that damn thing
just doesn't understand

524
01:10:12,725 --> 01:10:13,599
Bomb!

525
01:10:13,817 --> 01:10:15,188
Commander, sir
you still there?

526
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,584
Oh, yes, Doolittle

527
01:10:19,693 --> 01:10:22,747
- I'm thinking
- We're running out of time, sir

528
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:25,147
Oh, yes

529
01:10:25,992 --> 01:10:30,961
Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop
you'll have to talk to it

530
01:10:30,962 --> 01:10:33,635
- Sir?
- Talk to the bomb

531
01:10:33,636 --> 01:10:37,140
But I have been talking to it, sir
and Pinback is talking to it right now.

532
01:10:37,345 --> 01:10:39,055
No, no, Doolittle

533
01:10:39,664 --> 01:10:44,575
You talk to it
Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle

534
01:10:45,987 --> 01:10:49,243
- Sir?
- Phenomenology...

535
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:51,444
Doolittle?

536
01:10:52,353 --> 01:10:55,023
Six minutes to detonation!
Doolittle!

537
01:11:09,379 --> 01:11:12,159
Doolittle, what the hell
are you doing?

538
01:11:41,236 --> 01:11:42,207
Hello, bomb

539
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,557
- Are you with me?
- Of course

540
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:47,905
Are you willing
to entertain a few concepts?

541
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:50,203
I am always receptive
to suggestions.

542
01:11:50,304 --> 01:11:52,935
Fine
Think about this then

543
01:11:53,817 --> 01:11:55,696
How do you know you exist?

544
01:11:59,216 --> 01:12:00,772
What the hell is he doin'?

545
01:12:03,008 --> 01:12:05,043
I think he's talking to it

546
01:12:05,244 --> 01:12:08,498
- Well of course I exist
- But how do you know you exist?

547
01:12:08,778 --> 01:12:10,539
It is intuitively obvious

548
01:12:10,595 --> 01:12:12,412
Intuition is no proof

549
01:12:12,598 --> 01:12:15,422
What concrete evidence
do you have that you exist

550
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:22,265
Well, I think, therefore I am

551
01:12:22,615 --> 01:12:24,575
That's good
That's very good

552
01:12:24,696 --> 01:12:27,262
But how do you know
that anything else exists?

553
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:29,698
My sensory apparatus
reveals it to me.

554
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:31,339
Ah, right!

555
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:34,975
- This is fun.
- Now listen, here is the big question

556
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:42,110
How do you know that the evidence your
sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?

557
01:12:49,094 --> 01:12:50,722
- The gun!
- Gun! Gun!

558
01:12:50,723 --> 01:12:53,334
The support pins on the bomb
shoot the pins out!

559
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:55,223
- No, Boiler, you out of your mind
- We can stop the bomb

560
01:12:55,224 --> 01:12:57,972
Get out of my way, you idiot
I can shoot the support pins on the bomb

561
01:13:03,255 --> 01:13:05,319
Get out of the way
I can save the ship!

562
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,264
Don't do it, Boiler
you are bad shot

563
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:11,405
You'll hit the bomb
Doolittle is talking to the bomb

564
01:13:11,406 --> 01:13:13,803
You are bad shot, he'll save us
You can shoot at

565
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,020
What I'm getting at is this

566
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:21,488
The only experience that is directly
available to you is your sensory data

567
01:13:21,489 --> 01:13:25,468
And this sensory data is merely
a stream of electrical impulses

568
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:27,268
Which stimulate your computing center

569
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,129
In other words, all that
I really know about the outside world

570
01:13:31,134 --> 01:13:32,906
Is relayed to me through
my electrical connections.

571
01:13:33,007 --> 01:13:34,007
Exactly!

572
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:37,687
Why, that would mean that...

573
01:13:38,596 --> 01:13:41,702
I really don't know what the outside
universe is like at all, for certain

574
01:13:41,703 --> 01:13:42,952
Thats it, thats it!

575
01:13:42,953 --> 01:13:46,003
Intriguing. I wish I had
more time to discuss this matter

576
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:47,701
Why don't you have more time?

577
01:13:47,702 --> 01:13:50,091
Because I must
detonate in 75 seconds.

578
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:53,525
No put it back, put the gun back
you don't know what you're doing

579
01:13:58,357 --> 01:13:59,399
No, now give me the gun

580
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:03,421
You fool, I'm gonna shoot the pins on the bomb
it will fall away from ship and we'll be safe

581
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:05,879
Give me the gun, you don't know
what you're doing here, stop!

582
01:14:08,636 --> 01:14:09,875
You could've kill me

583
01:14:11,268 --> 01:14:15,286
Now, bomb, consider this
next question very carefully

584
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:18,843
What is your one purpose in life?

585
01:14:18,944 --> 01:14:22,386
- To explode, of course.
- And you can only do it once, right?

586
01:14:22,387 --> 01:14:23,387
That is correct.

587
01:14:23,481 --> 01:14:26,789
And you wouldn't want to explode on
the basis of false data, would you?

588
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:28,756
- Of course not.
- Well then

589
01:14:28,957 --> 01:14:33,446
You've already admitted that you have no real proof
of the existence of the outside universe

590
01:14:33,447 --> 01:14:34,852
Yes, well...

591
01:14:34,853 --> 01:14:38,800
So you have no absolute proof that
Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.

592
01:14:39,194 --> 01:14:43,747
I recall distinctly the detonation order
My memory is good on matters like these

593
01:14:43,748 --> 01:14:45,620
Of course you remember it, but..

594
01:14:45,621 --> 01:14:48,610
But all you are remembering is merely
a series of sensory impulses

595
01:14:48,611 --> 01:14:53,268
which you now realize have no
real definite connection with outside reality.

596
01:14:53,469 --> 01:14:57,584
True, but since this is so, I have no proof
that you are really telling me all this.

597
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,028
That's all beside the point

598
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:07,721
I mean the concept is valid
no matter where it originate

599
01:15:08,608 --> 01:15:10,843
- So if you detonate in...
- Nine seconds...

600
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:13,070
You could be doing so
on the basis of false data.

601
01:15:13,651 --> 01:15:17,374
- I have no proof that it was false data.
- You have no proof that it was correct data.

602
01:15:21,001 --> 01:15:23,185
I must think on this further.

603
01:15:31,221 --> 01:15:35,778
Attention, attention
the bomb has returned to the bomb bay

604
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:38,584
The destruction sequence is aborted

605
01:16:03,234 --> 01:16:04,233
Doolittle

606
01:16:05,284 --> 01:16:06,299
Doolittle?

607
01:16:07,407 --> 01:16:10,443
What happened?
Pinback? Boiler?

608
01:16:10,644 --> 01:16:14,620
Did we blow it up?
Hello? Hello?

609
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:27,870
Hello, anybody!
Did we blow up the planet?

610
01:16:27,871 --> 01:16:31,975
Hello, hello!
What's going on?

611
01:16:34,084 --> 01:16:36,438
You know, we really
got to disarm the bomb

612
01:16:42,614 --> 01:16:44,769
Hello, Doolittle, are you there?

613
01:16:45,252 --> 01:16:49,271
I'm coming in now
I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock

614
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:51,690
Too much trouble to come
in the Dorsal Lock

615
01:16:52,245 --> 01:16:54,770
Would you blow the seal on the
emergency hatch so I can come in?

616
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:56,269
Oh, sure.

617
01:16:58,856 --> 01:17:01,518
You are now leaving
the Emergency Air Lock

618
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:04,265
Thank you for observing
all safety precautions

619
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:08,996
Hello, Pinback?

620
01:17:10,175 --> 01:17:11,388
What's up Doolittle?

621
01:17:11,589 --> 01:17:14,669
Talby was in the Air Lock
You blew him out of the ship

622
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:16,510
He's drifting away
without his jetpack.

623
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:20,442
I'm going after him. Turn on his
helmet radio so I can contact him

624
01:17:20,543 --> 01:17:22,598
What's wrong, I didn't hear...

625
01:17:22,599 --> 01:17:25,996
It's Talby, he's drifting away
from the ship without his jetpack.

626
01:17:32,215 --> 01:17:34,812
Talby,
Talby can you read me?

627
01:17:35,013 --> 01:17:38,189
Can you beat that?
I always knew that guy was weird.

628
01:17:38,727 --> 01:17:40,187
Talby, can you read me?

629
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,599
Help, Doolittle, help me!

630
01:17:51,947 --> 01:17:53,042
Alright, bomb

631
01:17:54,553 --> 01:17:56,223
Prepare to receive new orders

632
01:17:56,324 --> 01:17:57,625
You are false data.

633
01:17:58,794 --> 01:18:00,588
Therefore, I shall ignore you.

634
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:02,552
Hello, bomb?

635
01:18:02,832 --> 01:18:05,056
False data can act
only as a distraction

636
01:18:05,498 --> 01:18:07,669
Therefore I shall refuse to perceive you.

637
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:08,840
Hey, bomb

638
01:18:08,941 --> 01:18:11,224
The only thing which exists is myself.

639
01:18:11,225 --> 01:18:13,164
Doolittle! Help me.

640
01:18:13,274 --> 01:18:14,739
Calm down, I'm coming.

641
01:18:16,552 --> 01:18:17,939
Snap out of it, bomb.

642
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:20,035
In the beginning there was darkness

643
01:18:20,326 --> 01:18:22,898
And the darkness was
without form and void

644
01:18:24,052 --> 01:18:26,107
- What the hell is he talking about?
- Yoo hoo, bomb...

645
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:28,790
And in addition to the darkness
there was also me

646
01:18:30,679 --> 01:18:32,950
And I moved upon
the face of the darkness

647
01:18:33,653 --> 01:18:35,611
And I saw that I was alone.

648
01:18:36,465 --> 01:18:38,338
Hey, bomb?

649
01:18:40,703 --> 01:18:42,160
Let there be light.

650
01:18:58,329 --> 01:18:59,889
Doolittle, where are you?

651
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,568
Here I am

652
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,252
I'm spinning

653
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:07,435
We're falling in opposite directions
away from each other

654
01:19:07,436 --> 01:19:08,734
What happened, Doolittle?

655
01:19:08,735 --> 01:19:11,228
Bomb must have gone off
inside the ship

656
01:19:11,229 --> 01:19:12,744
The ship blew up? What?

657
01:19:13,136 --> 01:19:16,575
Funny, I thought I have
the damn thing convinced

658
01:19:16,576 --> 01:19:18,729
Boiler? and Pinback?

659
01:19:19,437 --> 01:19:22,708
- They dead, Talby
- Then we're dead too

660
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:25,820
Maybe not
maybe there is a way

661
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:32,459
Hey.. hey my jetpack busted
oh, man...

662
01:19:35,023 --> 01:19:40,234
It looks like the skipper
He made it. Commander Powell made it!

663
01:19:40,749 --> 01:19:45,005
Men... men... what happened, men?

664
01:19:45,006 --> 01:19:47,461
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.

665
01:19:48,304 --> 01:19:52,668
Talby, looks like I'm headed for the planet
Going right toward it.

666
01:19:52,969 --> 01:19:55,692
When you hit the atmosphere
You'll start to burn

667
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:02,174
What a beautiful way to die...
as a falling star...

668
01:20:02,491 --> 01:20:03,612
Guess you're right.

669
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:14,825
Doolittle, I'm heading right toward something
It's behind me, in the distance

670
01:20:15,155 --> 01:20:16,714
Something that glows.

671
01:20:19,286 --> 01:20:22,183
Doolittle...
I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!

672
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:22,978
Phoenix?

673
01:20:23,179 --> 01:20:26,205
- It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix!
- No kidding?

674
01:20:27,091 --> 01:20:30,137
I'm going into them
I'm going to hit them

675
01:20:31,503 --> 01:20:33,130
- Doolittle
- Yeah?

676
01:20:33,232 --> 01:20:36,175
Before we get too far apart
and our signals start fading

677
01:20:37,273 --> 01:20:40,944
I just wanted to tell you...
you were my favorite

678
01:20:41,527 --> 01:20:43,146
I really liked you, Doolittle.

679
01:20:45,855 --> 01:20:48,114
I really liked you too, Talby

680
01:20:48,415 --> 01:20:52,061
Hey, some debris from the ship!
It's coming right by me

681
01:20:52,362 --> 01:20:54,417
Doolittle, I'm going into them

682
01:20:55,659 --> 01:20:57,139
I'm beginning to glow

683
01:20:58,099 --> 01:21:01,283
They're taking me with them
with the Phoenix...

684
01:21:01,896 --> 01:21:04,828
To circle the universe..
Forever

685
01:21:06,097 --> 01:21:10,439
I'm with them now...
Be back this way again some day

686
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:18,475
Doolittle, before it's too late
there's one last thing I want to tell you...

687
01:21:21,406 --> 01:21:22,616
Talby?

688
01:21:42,422 --> 01:21:46,321
Hey, Talby?
I've got a piece of debris

689
01:21:46,808 --> 01:21:48,683
