Oh, shit.

2
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,721
Duffy split.

3
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:38,808
Yeah, wasn't that Duffy?

4
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,143
Duffy rolls outta here
in a brand new Cadillac.

5
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,189
The lad has the nerve to ask me
to clean up his fucking locker
and save it for him.

6
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:47,358
Probably has dirty
pictures of his wife.

7
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,277
I don't know what
the fuck is in here.

8
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:57,618
Uh-huh.

9
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,704
He does have dirty
pictures of his wife.

10
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,039
Yes. He does.

11
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:05,042
<i>Lucky man.</i>
<i>Look at her hooters.</i>

12
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,378
You like that, huh?

13
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,881
All right. This is
what I'm gonna do.

14
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,675
I'm gonna keep them.

15
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,094
Well, no, I gotta
answer to Duffy
for that.

16
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,554
I'll answer to him.

17
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,723
He is a duffus but
he's not a bad guy.

18
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,810
Fuck Duffy.
Just fuck him.
Fuck all of them.

19
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,315
Five copies of
an arrest report.

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,402
If the prisoner was
transported, there wouldn't
still be five copies here.

21
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,572
Duffy might've left him
downstairs. What's his
name? Chavez.

22
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,657
Let's go find him.

It's strange, 'cause
the manifest says the
prisoners all evacuated.

26
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,715
Anything's possible
in this storm.

27
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,217

<i>Please.</i>

00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,732
<i>It's been rising for like
three hours. It's already
up to my neck.</i>

34
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:14,695
I'm not gonna be able to stay
here long, man. I'll drown.
The water doesn't stop.

35
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,200
Get me the fuck outta here.
There's fucking snakes and
shit in this water.

36

Twenty bucks

says nothing before five.

37
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:28,334
Twenty bucks. What the fuck
is that? Let's make it worth
our while, at least. A dime.

38
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,169
I'm not betting
you $1,000.

39
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,837
Five hundred.

40
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:35,091
Get me the fuck
outta here, man!
The water keeps rising.

41
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,176

Got a broke leg.
Please, get me

<i>Wait a minute.
You want me to get
wet on account of you?</i>

46

<i>I'll drown.</i>

Yeah, that's right.
Cost me $55 a pair.

is I'll okay you to return
to full duty.

66

The bad news is
that in all likely

67
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,832
you'll be experiencing
moderate to severe
back pain.

68

You'll wanna be taking
something for it.

No. For how long
am I gonna have pain?

We're gonna try to manage
this as along as we can.

Hello, Miss?
I'm a Lieutenant
in the Police Department.

173
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,025
I'm in the middle of
a homicide investigation.

174
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,403
Can I get my
prescription, please?

175
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,239
Do you see
I'm on the phone?

176
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,367
<i>Hey, you can't
come back here.</i>

177
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:49,037
You got me waiting 40 minutes
so you can make a fuck
personal phone call!

178
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:55,001
Security. Security
to Pharmacy. Security
to Pharmacy, please.

179
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:58,088
<i>This is it.
This is it.</i>
<i>Police emergency.</i>

180
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,589
You're no cop.

181
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,799
What's that look like?

182
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,885
Why are you acting
all crazy for?

183
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,763
This is, uh, $23
with my copay, right?

184
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,224
There's 40. Give
everybody a drink.

185
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,476
Get the fuck
out of my way.

186
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,106
<i>(detective)
Dob, look at me.</i>

187
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,191
<i>Okay?</i>

188
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,235
<i>Two hours.
That's enough.</i>

189
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,321
<i>Tell me something
I don't know.</i>

190
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,115
<i>Man, you gotta
get me outta here.</i>

191
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,742
<i>Get you outta here?
Are you crazy?</i>

192
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,411
<i>I got you on possession.
You're on parole.</i>

193
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,788
Maybe but one
skinny ass joint.

194
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,082
That joint's gonna
get you back.

195
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,460
I've got five
dead people, man.

196
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,627
You understand?

197
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,296
I don't know
nothin' about it.

198
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,256
Tell me something.

199
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,258
What do you
want me to tell you?

200
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,678
I want you to tell me
something I haven't heard.
I don't want you to tell me,

201
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,890
look at me, I don't
want you to tell me
that you don't know nothing.

202
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,517
But I don't know nothing.

203
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,478
Did you tell him
what I said?

204
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,188
<i>You understand
what that means?</i>

205
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,066
I'm entitled to whatever
I want in this room.

206
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,403
That means Guantanamo
Bay. You believe
this motherfucker?

207
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:07,157
I've busted my ass
for yambos and this
yambo tell me shit.

208
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,701
Detective, can I see you
outside for a second?

209
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:13,246
Uh, yeah, sure.
Two minutes.

210
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,081
Think about it.

211
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,293
Uh, not a great time
to take a break.

212
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,336
What are you doing?

213
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,670
He's about to go.

214
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,380
Bullshit.
He's scared out
of his mind.

215
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,133
You and your partner made
a spectacle out of
picking him up.

216
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:28,136
Everyone in Central City
knows he's in here.
No, just shush.

217
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,014
You think he's gonna go out
if you keep insulting him
like that?

218
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,266
You trying to tell me
how to do my interrogation?

219
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,186
Yes. I'm gonna tell you
when you're doing
something wrong.

220
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,355
<i>Go fuck yourself</i>

221
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,233
I'm gonna treat
you respectfully.

222
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,485
You treat me respectfully.

223
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,696
I'm looking at some bullshit
pot busting. Because
you're on parole

224
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,282
you wind up back
in Angola. Why
would you do that?

225
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,493
I ain't the one
doing it.

226
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,703
Who did have
Kingard piss off?

227
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,748
I never said two
words to him.
I don't know.

228
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,626
But you knew he
was selling dope.
Come on.

229
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,216
Shall I call your parole
officer? Stop wasting
my time.

230
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,093
I knew he was selling.

231
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:12,430
<i>Okay. Tell me
where he was selling,
whose neighborhood was it.</i>

232
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:16,059
Man, look. I got
me a good job at
a cleaning service.

233
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,353
I check in when
I'm supposed to.

234
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,730
I smoke a little
weed, but that's it.

235
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:24,150
Tell me whose
neighborhood it was, Dob.

236
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,116
Man.

237
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,621
You know Fate?

238
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,457
Big Fate? Yeah.

239
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:44,963
Ain't nothin' moved
that part of town.
He ain't got a piece of it.

240
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,258
<i>Where can I find him?</i>

241
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,969
Shit. I'm saying
all I know.

242
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:54,806
If you want me
to lead you to him,
you well just lock me up.

243
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,277
Check Stevie's arrest
report on Dob.

244
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,280
If it mentions marijuana,
make sure it gets lost.

245
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,115
What do I tell Stevie?

246
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,950
You can tell him
to go fuck himself.

247
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,162
I'm gonna go upstairs
and crash an hour
in the crib.

248
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,189
What do you want, Mundt?

249
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,280
Internal Affairs
is checking the
property room vouchers.

250
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,823
So?

251
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,493
That means they're
gonna find out
the shit missing.

252
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,578
Not if you don't
tell them, they won't.

253
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,916
I can't do it
anymore, Terence.

254
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,588
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

255
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,429
I'm-I'm really sorry.
I just can't.

256
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,848
Mundt,

257
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,102
whatever drugs might've
been taken out of
the property room,

258
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,272
you will have a
voucher, you understand?

259
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:30,860
They won't turn up as missing,
'cause there's no record of
them being there

260
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,364
in the first
place, okay?

261
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,825
They're installing cameras.

262
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,788
So then you
don't do anything

263
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:46,209
where the cameras
can see you.

264
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,003
I can't.

265
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:51,256
When it was me doing
paperwork to cover the
cash you misplaced,

266
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,300
that was all right.
That was entirely
fucking reasonable.

267
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,303
I'm sorry.

268
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,431
<i>Hey, Mundt.</i>

269
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,976
Hey, Mundt?

270
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:16,489
<i>[woman laughing]</i>

271
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,180
[woman laughs]

272
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,227
You bad boy.

273
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,819
<i>(woman)
Oh, yeah.</i>

274
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,781
<i>[moans]</i>

275
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,866
Stand against the wall.

276
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,161
Come on! Stand
against the wall.

277
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,163
You're too busy
making out with
your girlfriend

278
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,165
you don't know
when you've done
something illegal?

279
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,750
What are we
hiding tonight?

280
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,876
Nothing.

281
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,836
You passed drugs
in that club?

282
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,713
No.

283
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:17,634
The two of you match a
description. Empty your
pockets and the handbag.

284
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,927
Why?

285
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,970
I said you match
a description.

286
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,473
Somebody seen
passing drugs.

287
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,101
I wasn't passing drugs.
What does that
even mean?

288
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,813
Empty your pockets.
Dump out the handbag. I'm
not gonna tell you again.

289
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,232
This is bullshit!

290
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,734
Just do what
he says, okay?

291
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,486
<i>What you got there?</i>

292
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,196
<i>Nothing.</i>

293
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,365
<i>I'm not gonna
get stuck, am I?</i>

294
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,825
No.

295
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,119
I get stuck, I'm
gonna be very
fucking angry.

296
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,246
You're not
gonna get stuck.

297
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,582
<i>Where's your badge
if you're a cop?</i>

298
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,671
This is what
I'm looking for.

299
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,841
Here's where it
says I'm a cop.

300
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:02,345
Sir, it-it's obviously
just for personal use.

301
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,680
I mean,
I'm not a dealer.

302
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,349
That's for
the DA to decide.

303
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,602
You're gonna
dump that bag
or I gotta do it?

304
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,234
Sir, is-is there any way
my parents don't have
to find out about this?

305
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,862
<i>I mean, can we,
can we just
handle this?</i>

306
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,115
<i>I'll go to jail on weekends
or something like that if
I have to do that.</i>

307
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,577
My father has a
heart condition, okay?

308
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:31,040
This would kill him.
Please. Just let me
keep this from him.

309
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,376
You think he want
might to know?

310
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:37,964
Yeah. I'd wanna know
if you were my child.

311
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,053
Here.

312
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:48,224
This fur is nothing,
but this is my
grandmother's.

313
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,936
It's worth $60,000.

314
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,647
You can give it
to your girlfriend.

315
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,566
If You don't have
a girlfriend,

316
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,568
you can give it
to your mother.

317
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,236
It's bribery.

318
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,613
Excuse me!

319
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,908
This is worth $60,000.

320
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:08,369
Doesn't that
get us passed?

321
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,705
Where's the rock?

322
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,625
Come on, come on,
who's got the kibble?

323
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,669
You wanna hit?

324
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,296
Yes.

325
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:37,899
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

326
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,442
Again.

327
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,402
Yeah?

328
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,869
<i>[whispers]
Are you fucking
kidding me?</i>

329
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:55,917
[groans]

330
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:10,974
This what's
gonna take?
Yeah?

331
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,518
You're worried about
your father finding out?

332
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,811
No.

333
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,187
What about your mother?

334
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,648
I don't give a shit
about anyone of them.

335
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,358
Did they beat you?

336
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,901
No.

337
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,653
Molest you?

338
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,405
No.

339
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,324
Didn't buy you
any clothes back
to school, huh?

340
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:32,495
Didn't see you in
the high school
play, huh?

341
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,665
<i>I wonder what'd they
say if they saw you now.</i>

342
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,209
<i>Smokin' crack.
[groans]</i>

343
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,712
Going out with
no panties on?

344
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,422
No pain?

345
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,383
[moans]

346
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:49,470
I bet they think about
you when you were
a little girl.

347
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,806
What the hell
happened to ya?

348
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:57,979
Don't fucking move!
You stay and watch!

349
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:02,483
You watch her! Watch
your fucking girlfriend.

350
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,955
<i>[train whistling]</i>

351
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,915
Fuck!

352
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,249
I need the coke back.

353
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,959
What happened?

354
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:05,046
I snorted what I thought
was coke. It turned out
to be heroin.

355
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,547
I gotta be at
work in a hour.

356
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:08,800
Oh, baby, okay.
I'm not alone.

357
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,844
Just get the coke.
I'll get out of here.

358
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,275
You didn't break it
out for your client?

359
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,277
Nah. He brings his own.

360
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,654
Uh-huh.

361
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,909
Who are you?

362
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:44,293
I'm the last person
in the world you
want me to be.

363
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,421
He's just
an old friend.

364
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:50,925
Come on, missy,
we've had you under
surveillance for weeks.

365
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,636
Do you have any illegal
substances on you?

366
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,304
Like what?

367
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,140
Asshole.

368
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:00,685
Cooperate with me,
I'll let you walk
outta here.

369
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:04,564
You play games,
come with her.

370
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,318
I got some coke.

371
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,487
Get it.

372
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,581
Get out.

373
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,884
[laughs]

374
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,847
That was fun.

375
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,057
Hey.

376
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,517
[both laugh]

377
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,971
Come. Come!

378
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,808
Are you a policeman?

379
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:22,934
Yes.

380
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,352
Do you know
who do this?

381
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:25,520
I don't know, yet.

382
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:26,896
Look here.

383
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,148
This dead.
Babacar.

384
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,734
This little girl,
no more.

385
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,278
He's dead, dead.
Older man.

386
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,740
Oh, my angel,
she's dead. All
my whole family.

387
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,450
How are you related?

388
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:42,411
Yasin. She were
my sister.

389
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,163
When was the last
time you saw her?

390
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:47,792
I see her dat morning.
I go by in case she
need anything.

391
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:51,379
But dat morning
she says she needs
something from the grocery,

392
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:55,925
and she called there
and had it delivered
by a boy to her home.

393
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,760
Help me, please.

394
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:01,180
Please, help me find
the killer of my family.

395
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:05,059
Please, sir.
Help me. Help.

396
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,081
Are you the manager?

397
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,124
No, sir.

398
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,293
The manager's
over there.

399
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,632
New Orleans Homicide.
You got people making
deliveries here?

400
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:40,303
We get different guys making
deliveries. Different days,
different guys.

401
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,179
What about Tuesday?

402
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:44,265
Different times a day.
Different guys.

403
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,641
Late afternoon.

404
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,894
We don't keep track
of who takes what
to who.

405
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,522
A delivery boy
hasn't shown up
in a while?

406
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:20,384
<i>Excuse us. Hello!</i>

407
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,511
Police Department.

408
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,639
We're looking
for Binnie Rogers.

409
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,432
I'm Binnie Rogers.

410
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:30,186
We need to talk to you
for a second. Do you mind
stepping in the hall?

411
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,189
No, I can't step
into the hall.

412
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,108
Can't you see this
lady needs me here?

413
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,988
We're looking for your
grandson, Miss Rogers.

414
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:42,740
What are you
looking for him for?

415
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,950
Just to talk.
We just wanna
talk to him.

416
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,203
He do somethin' wrong?

417
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,413
He might've been
a witness to a crime.

418
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,248
I don't know
anything about that.

419
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,125
Where can we find him?

420
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:58,047
Young man, what do you
think gives you the right
to come into my room

421
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:03,386
and have a conversation
without even acknowledging
my presence?

422
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,721
We're terribly sorry.

423
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:09,517
It's very important
we talk to this
woman's grandson.

424
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,894
And she told you
she doesn't know
where he is.

425
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:14,647
Actually, she hasn't
told us that.

426
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,941
I don't know.

427
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,737
I'm sorry, Grandma.

428
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,745
What do you
wanna know?

429
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:34,333
Did you make a delivery
Tuesday on Josephine
and Danneel, son?

430
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:38,129
Uh-huh.

431
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:39,588
<i>What did you see there?</i>

432
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,966
This is a 15-year
old boy, sir.

433
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,218
<i>We need you to tell us
what you saw, Daryl.</i>

434
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,805
<i>He don't get involved
in drugs, in gangs.</i>

435
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,099
He go to school.

436
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,601
He hold down a job
and he come home.

437
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,645
A family was
murdered, ma'am.

438
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,981
<i>And I feel very
bad about that.</i>

439
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:00,443
But I don't want my
grandson involved in it.

440
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,946
<i>Maybe your grandson has
some feelings of his own.</i>

441
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,912
Well,

442
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:17,960
the lady told me
to set the grocery
bags in the kitchen.

443
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:22,047
Uh, as I was setting
the grocery bags down,
I heard screaming.

444
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,133
And I heard gunshots.

445
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,886
So I hid in the closet.

446
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,726
When I came out,
everybody was dead.

447
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,022
Did you see
who shot them?

448
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,117
Say yes or no.

449
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:01,712
This is who we're
looking for. Name
is Donald Godshaw.

450
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:05,508
Street name «Big Fate».
You should familiarize
yourself with his record.

451
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,677
It goes back
to '91. Did time
for rape, sodomy,

452
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:12,306
aggravated assault,
narcotics, and possession
of automatic weapons.

453
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:17,520
We believe he's also behind
at least three homicides
including the Ndele family.

454
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,147
Lieutenant, wanna show
some of those victims?

455
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:24,735
<i>All three were
possible witnesses.</i>

456
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,572
Godshaw has two flunkies
that he runs with.

457
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:30,616
Deshaun Hackett,
street name «Midget».

458
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:34,745
Has a girlfriend on Burgundy
and Mazant. We'll set up
surveillance on the block.

459
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:37,248
Maybe we'll get
lucky he'll turn up.

460
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:41,293
Gary Jenkins,
street name «G.»

461
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:44,004
His grandmother lives
in the Iberville Projects.

462
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:47,883
If his laying low
chances are, that's
where we'll find him.

463
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,593
Let's bring him in.

464
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,491
Give me a minute.

465
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,670
I need access to the
apartment next door.
Do you mind?

466
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,798
Oh! It's okay, baby.
[laughs]

467
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:29,466
Why you need
access for?

468
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:33,596
We had complaints
about disturbance,
not answering the door.

469
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:44,398
<i>[baby cries]</i>

470
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,217
<i>[dog barks]</i>

471
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,181
Don't fucking breathe.

472
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,539
I love it.
[laughs]

473
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,624
I just love it.

474
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:34,675
I've told you
everything I know.

475
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,304
This is your
lucky day, son.

476
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:42,391
You're the first person
we've picked up. You're in
a position to help yourself.

477
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,059
Help myself do what?

478
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,520
You know something
about this family
that got murdered.

479
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,605
I don't know nothing.

480
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:52,651
You were in the apartment when
the Africans got shot. Who was
with you? Midget Donald?

481
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:56,113
Donald Godshaw,
«Big Fate». Where is he?
Where can we find him?

482
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:57,740
I don't know
no «Big Fate».

483
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,409
We don't need you no
more. There's gonna
be five homicides

484
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,036
and Donald's gonna
hand them on you.

485
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,955
He gets eight to ten.
You get for life.

486
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,249
I don't know nobody
named «Midget».

487
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,085
I don't know nobody
named «Big Fate».

488
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,639
Renaldo Hayes!

489
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:25,851
Oh. Man!
That's bad luck.

490
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:29,980
I keep hope that once
in a while this kid throws
to somebody on his own team.

491
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:33,442
I love the guy. By the end
of the fucking game, I'm
starting to hate him.

492
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,943
What do you want
for the weekend?

493
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,904
What's the spread on
Louisiana-Arkansas?

494
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,197
Four.

495
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,074
Louisiana.

496
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,576
Minus to four
for a dime.

497
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,412
You got it. I got
a favor to ask.

498
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:47,289
My kid got
a speeding ticket.

499
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,958
I'll take care if you
give me half a point.

500
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,544
You're gonna grind me
for helping out
my kid?

501
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:54,713
Grind you?
You're funny guy,
you know that?

502
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:58,509
There's guys getting half
a point on the street
for nothing. Grind you.

503
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,640
All right.
But you take
care of it.

504
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,878
Hello. Hello!

505
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:37,756
I'm Lieutenant McDonagh,
New Orleans Homicide.

506
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,341
What can I do for you?

507
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,844
A friend of mine's daughter
got written up for speeding.

508
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:45,013
She was doing 75
on the way to the hospital
to visit her grandmother.

509
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:48,016
Has a couple of minor,
minor violations
in the past.

510
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,852
She's in danger
of losing her license.

511
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,311
What do you
want me to do?

512
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,980
<i>I'd like you to take
care of it for me.</i>

513
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,524
You come to the scene
of an accident to
ask me that?

514
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,317
There shouldn't
be a problem.

515
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:01,530
Are you asking me to break
the law? Is that what
you're doing here?

516
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:05,784
I'm asking you
one cop to another
to do me a favor.

517
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,037
The answer's no.

518
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,789
Just like that?

519
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:12,374
Just like that.

520
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,919
Is this the same Police
Department my father was in?

521
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:17,337
You'll excuse me.

522
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:18,797
Great.

523
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:22,134
Guardian of the Flame,
right? Fucking ass.

524
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,469
Get back in you
car, Lieutenant.

525
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,055
Or else what?

526
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,516
Hey there.

527
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,185
Hey, what are
you doing here?

528
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,728
<i>You know the Lieutenant?</i>

529
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,688
Yeah. We used
to work together.

530
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,483
Why don't you walk him
back to his car?

531
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,406
I could've told you
not to bother with
that asshole.

532
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,867
You needed a ticket
fixed, why didn't
you come to me?

533
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,535
I didn't know
you worked here.

534
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:51,413
They only let me out
on patrol when they're
short handed.

535
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:53,916
Mostly they got me
in the property room.

536
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,126
Property room?

537
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,212
What are you
doing tonight?

538
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:01,798
You asking me out?

539
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:03,759
Yes, I am.

540
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,428
[laughs]

541
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:04,486
Hey.

542
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:10,993
You like these
boots, don't you?

543
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,912
Only on you,
you know that.

544
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,956
Yeah?

545
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,541
You're horny?

546
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:21,003
Oh, yeah.

547
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:25,632
No, you're not.
You're high on dope.

548
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:28,927
Not true.

549
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:32,180
Whatever I take
is prescription.

550
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:35,726
Except for the heroin.

551
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,730
Hey! Wake up, McDonagh.

552
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:46,570
Yeah, there's times
I can't get what I need
with the prescription.

553
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,530
Really?

554
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:52,909
Yeah. When my back
hurts sometimes.

555
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:58,248
Well, maybe there's
something I can do
to make that pain go away.

556
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,792
You definitely can.

557
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,545
What's that, baby?
What do you want me
to do for you?

558
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:06,256
Check out your
property room

559
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,635
and see if there's
any Oxycontin

560
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,970
or morphine

561
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:16,266
you can sneak
outta there.

562
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:20,479
Just make sure
you get rid of
the voucher copy.

563
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,442
You're nuts.

564
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:45,212
Hey.

565
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:48,465
The ticket's gonna be a
little more complicated
than I thought.

566
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,926
You're kidding me.

567
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,804
The best thing to do
is to have her plead
not guilty.

568
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:57,849
By the time a court day
comes around, I'll talk to
the cop who wrote her up.

569
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:00,060
I thought that's what
you were gonna do.

570
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:03,188
I went straight
to the Lieutenant.

571
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,274
He wound up being
a hard on.

572
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,361
It'll work out.
It's just gonna take
a little longer. Come on.

573
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:15,075
Kinda calls into question the
half-a-point-for-nothing
concept, don't you think?

574
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,119
You're some cheap
prick, you know that?

575
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,996
You say you're gonna
do something and you
don't do it.

576
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,374
Good! Charge me
for the half point.

577
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:27,712
And after last weekend,
you're down $3,000.

578
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:31,466
You might,
I mean, might

579
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,970
have thought to bring me
a little something.

580
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:38,515
Two dimes!

581
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,767
On Louisiana

582
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:43,061
against Georgia.

583
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,692
Okay, you got it.

584
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,416
<i>[flushes toilet]</i>

585
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:32,777
How long has he
been in there?

586
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:34,029
About 20 minutes.

587
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,655
Who else?

588
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:38,533
His girlfriend.
At least one. That's
as far as we know.

589
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:41,953
What are these fucking
iguanas doing on my
coffee table?

590
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:44,122
There ain't no iguana.

591
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:45,540
Yeah, there are.

592
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:48,293
There ain't no iguana.

593
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,712
What the fuck is that?
Fucking iguana.

594
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:54,090
Are we set up?

595
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:55,550
SWAT's around
the corner.

596
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:58,762
No! No, just,
just no SWAT.
Let them stay there.

597
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,932
The duty captain said
he wanted to coordinate
with us when we--

598
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:05,769
Is that what you're fucking
doing now? Reporting back
to the duty captain?

599
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,729
I'm telling you
what he said.

600
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:11,775
If we need SWAT,
we'll call 'em.

601
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,386
Let's go.

602
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:44,451
Who else is in here?

603
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:45,952
Nobody.

604
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,622
We're gonna come back
every day, you understand?

605
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:54,127
More times we come back,
more chances that child
getting shot.

606
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,004
Ain't nobody here.

607
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,632
[whispers]
He's hiding back
there in the armoire.

608
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:08,934
You all stay
with her. Armand.

609
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,368
Get up.

610
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,286
I said get up!

611
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,121
Damn, man.

612
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:34,084
It's always nice to see
an intact family.

613
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,670
A father who honors
his obligations

614
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:39,547
as far as his
children are a concern.

615
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:42,258
<i>You're here.</i>
<i>That's important thing.</i>

616
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:45,929
<i>You may be hiding in
an armoire, but your
child knows you're here.</i>

617
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,347
Are you tripping, man?

618
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,723
<i>Armand, give us
a minute.</i>

619
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:50,642
You're tripping.
You want that shit.

620
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:53,853
Shut the door.
Shut up. Shut
the door.

621
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,023
Sit down.

622
00:46:57,941 --> 00:46:59,818
Sit down, sit down.

623
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,530
[exhales]

624
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,615
Now we can talk.

625
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:10,328
You don't mind
if I light one
up, do you?

626
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:12,414
Fuck, man.

627
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,960
I find it relaxes me.

628
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:19,796
What the fuck, man?

629
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:24,050
You know we got
your boy, «G.»
Right?

630
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:26,469
Man, I don't know no «G.»

631
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,806
He knows you.

632
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,893
It's amazing how much
you can get done

633
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:37,355
when you've got
a simple purpose
guiding through life.

634
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:45,447
My purpose is
to find out

635
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,199
who shot up this
apartment on Josephine.

636
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:51,327
I know the guy who
was living there
was from Senegal.

637
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,371
I know he was
selling heroin.

638
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:56,708
I know whose territory
he was stepping on.

639
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,961
And I know who went
over to the apartment
to straighten him out.

640
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:03,882
I found out all that
in the past few days.

641
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:08,678
Where is
«Big Fate», son?

642
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:11,347
I don't know
no «Big Fate».

643
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:13,391
You see, I know
that's not true.

644
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:17,103
'Cause everybody who comes
from where you come, knows
who «Big Fate» is.

645
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:20,273
The fact that you're lying
to me, tells me you're
hiding something.

646
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:24,235
You know my only reason for
being here is to find out
who shot up the apartment.

647
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,280
I know that's what
you're hiding.
See? It all,

648
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:31,826
all comes back
to that same
simple purpose.

649
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:36,331
Man, I ain't
telling you shit.

650
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,374
<i>[dog barks]</i>

651
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,393
<i>[dog barks]</i>

652
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,521
Hey.

653
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:01,439
What's wrong?

654
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:04,651
Your father's mad at me
'cause I can't take care
of his <i>fucking </i>dog.

655
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:06,486
Why does he need you
to take care of it?

656
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:09,364
'Cause he's going
back into AA.

657
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:13,076
He says he can't
do with any more
responsibilities.

658
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,579
Besides that he,
he's gotta stop drinking.

659
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:20,458
I mean, ain't like
I don't wanna take
care of it,

660
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:24,587
but I leave at 7:00
in the morning
to go to work!

661
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:27,215
Oh, let me
talk to him.

662
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,552
I try to be a good
wife to him, Terence.
I do. But you know,

663
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,804
I got a limit, too.

664
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:37,559
You know, he's got a
drinking problem. He says
he's got a drinking problem.

665
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:40,395
He wants to so something
about it. That's good.

666
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:44,732
You know, he's been
down this road before
and it didn't take.

667
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,861
He wants to
try it again.
Good!

668
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:52,615
But I, I say to him,
why don't you just take
the beer the way that I do,

669
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:55,451
but he says
he can't do that.

670
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:57,412
Hey, Pop.

671
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,788
How are you doing?

672
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:00,874
I thought you said
the meeting was at seven.

673
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:03,251
I gotta get there early.
Set up the chairs.

674
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,294
I'll take you.

675
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:05,962
She can do it.

676
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,507
I came over to see you.
Let me take you for
a ride, at least.

677
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:12,051
You feed the dog?

678
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:14,762
You feed the dog?

679
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:16,723
I can take

01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:48,247
What did he say
when he left?

853
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,666
He asked me if I'd be
okay waiting here
by myself.

854
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:53,544
I said yeah. He said he
had to go to the bathroom.
What is going on?

855
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,212
He's a witness
to a homicide.

856
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:56,297
To what?

857
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,840
To five homicides.
Let's go.

858
01:01:57,923 --> 01:01:58,966
Where are we going?

859
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,551
To find him.

860
01:03:26,804 --> 01:03:28,514
Where is he?

861
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,641
Binnie, call security.

862
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:32,851
Nobody's calling anybody.

863
01:03:32,935 --> 01:03:34,478
Where's your
grandson, Binnie?

864
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:37,147
I don't have
to tell you anything.

865
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,404
Yeah, you do.

866
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:47,074
I haven't done anything.
My grandson hasn't
done anything.

867
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:50,703
If he doesn't wanna be
a witness, he doesn't
have to be a witness.

868
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:53,414
<i>This is bigger
than one, two.</i>

869
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:55,416
This was a massacre.

870
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:56,750
Children

871
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,254
were executed.

872
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:03,340
Maybe you should've
thought of that before.

873
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:09,805
I need to know
where he is.

874
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:14,852
Young man, I would like
to know the name
of your superior.

875
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:21,275
Right now I'm working
on about an hour
and a half sleep

876
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,360
over the past
three days.

877
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:28,073
And I'm still trying
to remain courteous.

878
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:33,120
And I'm beginning to think
that that's getting in the
way of my being effective.

879
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:43,464
What are you doing?

880
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:50,262
What--what
are you doing?

881
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,973
I wanna know

882
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,309
where Daryl is.

883
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:56,727
My God.

884
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,480
Nobody saw me
come in. Nobody
knows I'm here.

885
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:01,648
This old woman's
gonna run out of air,

886
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:05,319
and you're gonna have
a tough time convincing
people that it wasn't <i>you</i>

887
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:10,157
who did it to her.
And even if, and even
if you do convince them

888
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,368
that <i>you </i>didn't
kill her on purpose,

889
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:16,330
you're still gonna have
a tough time selling
them that <i>you</i>

890
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:19,500
took care of her
with a fuck!

891
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,168
Now, listen to me.

892
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,004
Where the fuck is he?

893
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:27,341
I said where
the fuck is he?

894
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:30,010
He's on an airplane.

895
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,596
Miss Antoinette
bought him a ticket

896
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:36,350
and send him to live
with her family in England.

897
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,771
<i>[whimpers]</i>

898
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:44,358
All right, it's okay.
That's okay. That's a
good girl. Suck it up.

899
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:47,694
There you go. That's it.
Take it in. That's a
good girl. Take it in.

900
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:50,697
Good! Good.

901
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:52,366
Good.

902
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,535
That's it. Breathe.

903
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:57,204
Maybe you should drop
dead, you selfish cunt.

904
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:01,542
You ever think
about your kids or
your grandkids? Huh?

905
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:05,754
Sucking up their inheritance
through that fucked
oxygen tube?

906
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:08,382
And Binnie's fucked
intensive care?

907
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:12,094
You fucks, I hate you.
I hate you both.

908
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:16,390
I should, I should
fucking both,
right now,

909
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,976
I should fucking
kill you fucking both.

910
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:24,815
You're the fucking reason
this country's going
down the drain.

911
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:44,585
Watch out. He's not
in a good mood.

912
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:47,504
<i>Come in.</i>

913
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:52,509
Have a seat.

914
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:55,387
Scotland Yard called.
The kid's in England.

915
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:59,349
Make him a material witness.
Maybe Scotland Yard
will hold him.

916
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:02,603
Can't do that. He had no
involvement with the crime.

917
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:04,938
He don't want testify,
we can't compel him.

918
01:07:05,022 --> 01:07:07,274
Well, we could still
try flipping one
of the three.

919
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,151
<i>You can try</i>
<i>all what you want.</i>

920
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:12,279
Nobody flipping
on Godshaw. They're
scared to death of him.

921
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:15,449
As of now, all are
persons of interest.

922
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,075
You gotta let him go.

923
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:20,037
Oh, come on!
Five homicides and
you're letting him go?

924
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,789
You weren't supposed to let
the kid out of your sight.

925
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:24,458
<i>Be glad he didn't
turn out dead.</i>

926
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,459
This is bullshit.

927
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,752
Get the hell outta here.

928
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:28,420
You're not the one
on the street-—

929
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:30,214
Get out of my office.

930
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:33,133
Risking our lives
on the street!

931
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:36,345
<i>You know what's
involved, right?</i>

932
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:41,934
Maybe if we get a prosecutor
worry about something, we
could stand a fucking chance.

933
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:55,072
<i>What happened when
you went to see
the grandmother?</i>

934
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:57,199
<i>I told you.</i>

935
01:07:57,324 --> 01:08:01,161
She said the woman she takes
care of, bought a plane ticket.
He was on his way to England

936
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:02,704
to stay with
her relatives.

937
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:04,498
Any incidents took
place over there?

938
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,041
What kind of incidents?

939
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,334
Any kind.

940
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:08,794
No.

941
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:14,466
Whatever it is,
you're gonna have
your story down.

942
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:17,219
Public Integrity is
waiting for you
back at the house.

943
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:19,388
Oh, come on. Public
Integrity into this?

944
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:20,973
What for?

945
01:08:21,056 --> 01:08:25,602
That old woman,
her son is a United
States congressman.

946
01:08:29,815 --> 01:08:31,566
I asked where
Daryl was.

947
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:34,820
His grandmother told me.

948
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:39,700
You didn't, at any time,
threaten his grandmother?

949
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:43,578
No, I did not.

950
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:46,957
You didn't, at
any time, threaten
Antoinette Fahringer?

951
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,792
No, I did not.

952
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,713
You should know a formal
complaint's been filed
alleging you cut off

953
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:55,382
Mrs. Fahringer's
oxygen supply.

954
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:58,552
Who's saying that?
Mrs. Fahringer?

955
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,178
Is it true?

956
01:09:00,262 --> 01:09:02,931
I think she might
be suffering from
a little dementia.

957
01:09:03,015 --> 01:09:05,309
Lieutenant, we're
asking if it's true.

958
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:08,312
Absolutely not.

959
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:17,654
Lieutenant.

960
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:23,410
You know, I saw five
of those driving into
work this morning.

961
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:26,621
I want you
to clean it up.
Clean it up.

962
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:31,752
Ned, excellent.
You got my message.
Good. Come on.

963
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:33,045
What message?

964
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:34,921
You get the flowers
I sent? How's Jenny?

965
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:36,882
What the fuck are
you talking about?

966
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:38,425
Okay, that's good.

967
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,551
Stop it!
Cut it out.

968
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:40,844
What are you
doing here?

969
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:42,429
What do you think?

970
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,056
I don't have
anything for you.

971
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:45,432
Then this is
a problem.

972
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,142
Yeah, who
needs a problem?

973
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:50,645
You owe me
five large, Terence.

974
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:52,272
I haven't got it.

975
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,524
Then, you gotta
give me something.

976
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:58,653
Give me goods if
you don't have cash.
Give me a gold Rolex.

977
01:09:58,737 --> 01:10:00,947
Ned, I look like
I got a gold Rolex?

978
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:03,617
Don't pine me for
a fucking stooge.

979
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,952
Keep your voice down.
Just keep it down.

980
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:09,623
Don't play me
for a fucking stooge.

981
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,333
Are you done?

982
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,878
Do you think these guys
care you're a cop? They
will fuck you up

983
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,797
just like
everybody else.

984
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,924
Let me get something
down with the Texas game.

985
01:10:19,007 --> 01:10:21,176
'Cause that's where
the season turns a lot.

986
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,345
No.

987
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:28,392
Nothing. You pay
what the fuck you owe.

988
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:35,982
I'm a little late on
my rent, that's all.

989
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:38,485
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

990
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:43,073
Uh, somebody named
Frankie called.

991
01:11:10,142 --> 01:11:11,434
What's going on?

992
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:14,980
All kinds of things.
Come closer. I'm Dave.

993
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:16,189
Who are you?

994
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:17,315
Andy.

995
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:18,608
Jeff.

996
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:20,444
<i>What do you want?</i>

997
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:24,531
<i>What I want right now
is to get this behind
position right.</i>

998
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:25,907
He wants money.

999
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:27,659
Who are you?

1000
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:31,371
Sit down.
I told you,
I'm Dave.

1001
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:35,417
And the guy you robbed,
I know told you he was.

1002
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,462
You make a date
with a pretty girl.
You gotta pay.

1003
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:43,175
Dear. Like this.

1004
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:49,014
You want the schwantz,
not the prosty.
See? That's it.

1005
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:53,059
When you engage with
another human being, we remind
ourselves we're not alone.

1006
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:55,979
Plus, who knows,
maybe we even learn
a little something.

1007
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,689
How much?

1008
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:00,817
You took 10 off.
To make it right, you
gotta come up with 50.

1009
01:12:00,901 --> 01:12:02,402
No, that's bullshit.

1010
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:04,821
No, it's punitive
damages. What can
I tell you?

1011
01:12:04,905 --> 01:12:07,073
I don't get it.
She kept up with
the bargain.

1012
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:08,700
He says no.

1013
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:11,411
He's a fucking liar.
I did everything he
asked me to do.

1014
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:13,205
Which was what?

1015
01:12:13,288 --> 01:12:15,665
<i>(Frankie)</i>
<i>You want details?</i>

1016
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:17,918
You sick people.

1017
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:22,214
Oh, listen to her
stand up for herself.
The indignation.

1018
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:23,715
I love it.

1019
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,133
Where's the money?

1020
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:27,344
In my bag.

1021
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,474
It's all here?

1022
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:35,852
Okay. Here are
five thousand.

1023
01:12:35,936 --> 01:12:37,521
There's ten
in change here.

1024
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:39,856
Why don't I give you
this, call a day.

1025
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:45,028
We could do that.
Alternatively, I could
tell Jeffy to shoot the dog.

1026
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:48,156
Do you want me
to shoot the fucking dog?

1027
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:53,286
Or put my calling card
on this gorgeous
punum here.

1028
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,205
I don't give a shit
about the dog.

1029
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:58,667
But you mark her up,
I'm gonna have a tough
time getting you your money.

1030
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,418
<i>By my money you
mean $50,000.</i>

1031
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:01,795
I'll need a
couple of days.

1032
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,630
By a couple
you mean two.

1033
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:04,923
Yeah.

1034
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:06,549
Good.

1035
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:08,093
<i>[whispers]
Hey.</i>

1036
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:10,762
<i>I know. Relax.</i>

1037
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:14,558
The boys wanna saddle her
up just in the spirit
of friendliness.

1038
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:16,142
<i>You mind?</i>

1039
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:19,312
Well, let her get
cleaned up, put on
something hot.

1040
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:21,314
She looks like
shit right now.

1041
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:22,565
Beautiful.

1042
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,526
What are you
waiting for?

1043
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:29,364
I don't wanna put
any pressure on you,

1044
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:32,284
but she has a client
coming over in 15 minutes.

1045
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:34,035
You boys can be
done by the, right?

1046
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:35,912
The both of us?

1047
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:39,040
<i>They'd had been done
in 15 seconds you
hadn't mentioned it.</i>

1048
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:40,417
My mistake.

1049
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,502
You'll hit her
when we come back.

1050
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:45,171
Two days, same time,
same station, yes?

1051
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:47,173
Okay. You got it, baby.

1052
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:49,926
Don't make me look
for you, Terence.

1053
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,045
<i>They're gone.</i>

1054
01:14:28,048 --> 01:14:31,092
I'm gonna take you
to my father's house.

1055
01:14:31,176 --> 01:14:33,720
Buy some time at least.

1056
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:37,390
Frankie.

1057
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,226
They're gone.

1058
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:49,569
I can't take her.

1059
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:53,114
I just need a place
where she can stay
for a couple of days.

1060
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:55,533
Why can't you put her
up in your place?

1061
01:14:55,617 --> 01:14:59,079
I can't take a chance
these guys find out
where I live, Dad.

1062
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:02,082
Christ!

1063
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:04,876
They gave me the job
of bringing cookies
to a meeting.

1064
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:07,087
It takes me half
a day to get it done.

1065
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,339
You want me to
baby-sit a pros?

1066
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,174
You don't have
to baby-sit her.

1067
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,301
She's very
self-suficient.

1068
01:15:13,385 --> 01:15:18,264
Well, I'm not in any kind
of shape to take on
something like this.

1069
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:20,725
Look, I get home
from one meeting.

1070
01:15:20,809 --> 01:15:24,979
I lie on the couch
and I wait till it's
time for the next meeting.

1071
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:27,190
That's all I
can do right now.

1072
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,442
Let your wife
deal with her.

1073
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:31,861
They'll get along
like sisters.

1074
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:34,447
<i>Get away from me, you rag.</i>

1075
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:36,783
[grunting]

1076
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:40,704
My husband is trying to quit
drinking and you bring this
shit into our house?

1077
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:44,040
Give it back or I'll swear
to God I will stab you
in the heart.

1078
01:15:44,124 --> 01:15:46,418
I will stab you
in the heart.

1079
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:48,670
What kind of trash
you're bringing
in here?

1080
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:51,506
She's going
through my bag!
My personal shit!

1081
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:53,007
Everybody calm down.

1082
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:54,801
It's hard enough
for your father.

1083
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,554
He's gotta put up
with narcotics under
his nose.

1084
01:15:57,637 --> 01:16:02,100
<i>Oh, God. It can't be any
worse than you being shit
face on beer all the time.</i>

1085
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,185
<i>Enough!</i>

1086
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:06,729
You tell her I'm
shit face all the time?

1087
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:09,232
<i>Oh, it's pretty
fucking obvious, lady!</i>

1088
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:12,318
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>You fucking whore.</i>

1089
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:16,030
Watch this.
Come get it.
Come fucking get it.

1090
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:19,659
Get her outta here.
I can't deal with
this shit.

1091
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:21,578
<i>You cunt.</i>

1092
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:23,246
Hey, the neighbors!

1093
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:25,248
<i>You're a cunt,
you whore.</i>

1094
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,751
I'll fuck you up.

1095
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:31,004
We come in
or you come out?

1096
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:34,007
Alright, come on,
let's go.

1097
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:37,677
So, uh,
Francesca Donnenfeld.
Do you know her?

1098
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,014
Just cut the bullshit,
Yasco, and tell me what
you're here for.

1099
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:42,849
I'm Yasco.

1100
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:46,186
Here's the thing, tough
guy. You keep fucking
with the wrong people.

1101
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:49,189
First the old lady,
now your prostitute
friend's customer.

1102
01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:53,276
The old lady, you might've
written out. She, uh, doesn't
remember so good.

1103
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:56,905
The colored nurse,
she's covering for
the grandson, whatever.

1104
01:16:56,988 --> 01:16:59,783
But why I get a call
from the chief D's office

1105
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:02,869
that you've
shaken down your
pros friend's customer

1106
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:07,874
whose father's hung all
the way from here to
fucking City Hall.

1107
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,168
You're done, Lieutenant.

1108
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:11,753
What do you want?

1109
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,963
Your gun, for starters.

1110
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:16,716
Come on.

1111
01:17:24,224 --> 01:17:25,892
Until the outcome
of the hearing,

1112
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:28,061
you're on modify duty.

1113
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:31,648
Better call your
delegate. You got
an ass kicking coming.

1114
01:17:33,525 --> 01:17:35,777
You have a good
day, Lieutenant.

1115
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,991
[jumbled voices]

1116
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:51,584
A man without a
gun is not a man.

1117
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:54,671
Oh, well, I know.
Look, you cut the
best deal you can

1118
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:58,299
and you get the hell out
of the Police Department.
'Cause if you stay in,

1119
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:00,301
it's gonna get worse.

1120
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:02,679
Can I talk to you
for a second?

1121
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:06,891
I can't stay here.
I didn't take this
shit from my own mother

1122
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:08,726
and I'm not gonna
take it from <i>her.</i>

1123
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:12,730
Can I get a minute alone
with my girlfriend?

1124
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:16,818
Just give her a day or two.
She's gonna calm down,
I promise.

1125
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:20,363
I'm so, I'm so happy
you're here.

1126
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:24,325
And I got something
else somewhere.
I'll show you.

1127
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:27,161
She's really mean.

1128
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:47,599
I wanna show you
this place.

1129
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:51,895
I spent a lot
of time here

1130
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:54,230
when I was a boy.

1131
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:56,149
That doesn't
work anymore.

1132
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:59,068
I was here
alone a lot.

1133
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:04,198
This was my
special place

1134
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:05,867
as a child.

1135
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:10,204
My, my castle.

1136
01:19:10,288 --> 01:19:14,834
And I would imagine
things here. Pirates,
a buried treasure.

1137
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:19,881
And my dad didn't
like that so much, but
my mom, she, she got it.

1138
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:22,842
And, uh, and
before she died,

1139
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:26,888
she bought me a metal
detector. Come on, let
me show you something.

1140
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,349
Look at that.
Right out there,

1141
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:34,354
I thought that pirates
came up the Mississippi

1142
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:39,233
and that they buried
a treasure right there
by that tree next to the house.

1143
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:42,862
So I, I took the
metal detector
my mom gave me

1144
01:19:42,946 --> 01:19:45,531
and I went out there
waiting it would
start beeping.

1145
01:19:45,615 --> 01:19:48,201
It was like beep-beep,
beep, beep, beep.

1146
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,913
And I started digging,
and I-I-I dug and
I dug and I dug,

1147
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:57,710
and I found a, a
Sterling silver spoon,
and I was so happy.

1148
01:19:57,794 --> 01:20:01,172
I started screaming
and jumping and laughing.

1149
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:03,883
And I went, «Hey, man,
this is treasure.

1150
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:07,804
This is pirate treasure.»
And I came back
in here with it.

1151
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:12,725
And I hid it somewhere,
this Sterling silver
spoon.

1152
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:14,852
I still can't find it.

1153
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:17,814
It could be anywhere.

1154
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:22,068
I-I know it's here.

1155
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:35,873
<i>I don't know what
to tell you, Terence.</i>

1156
01:20:35,957 --> 01:20:38,042
Not a lot I can do
under the circumstances.

1157
01:20:38,126 --> 01:20:40,294
I know.

1158
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:46,592
I tell you guys all the time,
you cannot get away with that
cowboy shit anymore.

1159
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:50,596
You don't listen,
now this is where
were at.

1160
01:20:50,722 --> 01:20:54,559
My best fucking detective,
I gotta put him in
the property room.

1161
01:21:22,045 --> 01:21:24,297
Terence, come on.

1162
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,049
Man, I-I don't wanna
you get jammed off
for all of this.

1163
01:21:27,175 --> 01:21:31,429
You're doing all this wrong
shit and I'm here. They're
gonna think I'm doing it, too.

1164
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:35,099
So, go to the store
warehouse in Metairie
that way you're not here.

1165
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:39,270
And while you're there,
get me my .45 Magnum and
bring it to me. Okay?

1166
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:47,904
Hey.

1167
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:49,655
You're working here?

1168
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:52,116
Looks like.
What you got there?

1169
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,953
Nine, ten grams
of heroin and
a Glock nine.

1170
01:21:56,037 --> 01:21:59,373
Yeah. You see that
scale over there?

1171
01:21:59,457 --> 01:22:01,000
It's broken.

1172
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:04,087
See? useless.

1173
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:05,963
I sent for a new one.

1174
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:09,050
As soon as it gets here,
I'll weigh the drugs

1175
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,010
and I'll get you
your voucher, okay?

1176
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:12,470
All right, bye-bye.

1177
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,856
<i>Can I help you, sir?
Can I help you, sir?</i>

1178
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:27,318
<i>[jumbled voices]</i>

1179
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:29,362
<i>[laughter]</i>

1180
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,280
Can I talk
to you a minute?

1181
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:32,698
Excuse me?

1182
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:35,409
Mind stepping outside?

01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:37,232
That means you're
getting my price.

1350
01:35:37,316 --> 01:35:39,776
It's one way
of looking at it.

1351
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:44,531
The other is, you get to
keep 75% and not go to prison
for the rest of your life.

1352
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:51,997
Yeah.

1353
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,665
Go ahead.

1354
01:35:53,749 --> 01:35:56,251
<i>Make sure you cut
that shit before
you sell it,</i>

1355

unless you wanna kill
the motherfucker
who buys it.

1356
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:01,048
Did I ever tell you
the story about
nigger Elk?

1357
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:03,008
I was watching TV,
the game, right?

1358
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:06,136
Reynaldo Hayes,
He got tossed the ball.
He was running with it.

1359
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,430
He jumped over three
linebackers in midair.

1360
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:11,683
He sprouted antlers
like a gazelle.

1361
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:13,226
Like an elk.

1362
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:15,020
He landed again.
He ran, ran, ran.

1363
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:16,355
He scored a touchdown!

1364
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:20,817
<i>Crack talking.</i>

1365
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:24,112
Listen, I'm not worried
about you, so don't be
concerned about me.

1366
01:36:24,196 --> 01:36:28,700
'Cause I'm not concerned
if you're not concerned.
I'm not really concerned.

1367
01:36:28,784 --> 01:36:30,577
<i>I'm worried 'cause
if you drop dead,</i>

1368
01:36:30,661 --> 01:36:32,955
I'm the motherfucker
they come looking for.

1369
01:36:33,038 --> 01:36:35,749
And then I gotta
end up having a
nigger from <i>Africa</i>

1370
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:37,501
trying to move in
on my shit.

1371
01:36:37,584 --> 01:36:40,879
And I don't wanna shoot
no more purple ass
niggers from Africa.

1372
01:36:40,963 --> 01:36:44,299
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
'Cause I'm not Eazy-E.

1373
01:36:46,176 --> 01:36:47,719
Fucking god.

1374
01:36:47,803 --> 01:36:51,473
<i>Hey. Hey. I need
to go to the store.</i>

1375
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:52,683
<i>So?</i>

1376
01:36:52,766 --> 01:36:54,142
So I need you
to watch him.

1377
01:36:54,226 --> 01:36:55,852
<i>Fuck, no,</i>
<i>I can't watch him.</i>

1378
01:36:55,936 --> 01:36:58,271
Don't be yelling.
There ain't nothin'
to eat.

1379
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,066
Get the fuck
outta here!

1380
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:02,818
Get the fuck outta here!

1381
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:05,654
<i>Hit me again

<i>What the fuck's that?</i>

1383
01:37:11,284 --> 01:37:13,995
It's my lucky

1384
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:15,747
<i>You crazy motherfucker.</i>

1385
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:17,916
You don't have
a lucky crack pipe?

1386
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:21,461
<i>No, I don't have a lucky
motherfucking crack pipe.</i>

1387
01:37:21,545 --> 01:37:24,256
Then, Donald, you're
gonna take a hit
of mine.

1388
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:26,383
Why I gotta do that?

1389
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:28,343
'Cause it's lucky.

1390
01:37:30,721 --> 01:37:32,806
Shit.

1391
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:35,183

<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

1395
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:52,451
Third party beneficiary.

1396
01:37:52,534 --> 01:37:54,870
Your friend here
can fill you in
on the details.

1397
01:37:54,953 --> 01:37:57,873
I'm working on getting
your money, Dave. That's
what I'm doing here.

1398
01:37:57,956 --> 01:38:01,126
I don't know about you,
but the hardest part
of collecting debts

1399
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:02,961
is having to listen
to the <i>stones.</i>

1400
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:04,504
Terence owes you
some money?

1401
01:38:04,588 --> 01:38:07,674
$50,000. Plus my two
young friends here

1402
01:38:07,758 --> 01:38:10,802
were supposed to have
a sexual experience
of their choosing

1403
01:38:10,886 --> 01:38:15,223
with an attractive woman.
Nothing. He came across
with none of it.

1404
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:19,644
That's wrong. That's wrong
you don't do what you say
you're gonna do, Terence.

1405
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:21,813
The dope's worth
more than 50,000.

1406
01:38:23,065 --> 01:38:24,649
Take it.

1407
01:38:24,733 --> 01:38:27,402
Why don't I take
all the dope?

1408
01:38:27,486 --> 01:38:30,447
Why are you gonna take
what belongs to me?

1409
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:32,866
Well, there was a time
when I wouldn't have.

1410
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:36,036
I would've taken what
was mine and left the
rest on the table.

1411
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:39,122
But, you see,
I never got rich
enough to retire.

1412
01:38:39,206 --> 01:38:42,876
I'm stuck
doing this shit.

1413
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:45,128
And I'm not
young anymore.

1414
01:38:46,463 --> 01:38:49,299
So now I don't leave
nothing on the table.

1415
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:51,093
Pick it up.

1416
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:18,912
Shoot him again.

1417
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:20,413
What for?

1418
01:39:20,497 --> 01:39:22,707
His soul's still dancing.

1419
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:47,899
<i>(Terence)

Good night, Lieutenant.

What are you
doing tonight?

1423
01:40:25,395 --> 01:40:27,189
I'm getting outta
here and go to bed.

1424
01:40:27,314 --> 01:40:30,567
Just for fun, why don't
you stop by the apartment
on Josephine?

1425
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,027
For fun?

1426
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:34,112
You might find something
interesting there.

1427
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:35,906
Like what?

1428
01:40:35,989 --> 01:40:39,367
These bushwhackers
might've hit a crack pipe
while they were there.

1429
01:40:39,492 --> 01:40:43,997
You know? The odd chance is
he dropped it under the bed
where the kids were.

1430
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,665
And we missed it.

1431
01:40:45,749 --> 01:40:48,585
The DNA'd place
them at the scene.

1432
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:52,172
You had a vision, right?

1433
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:57,052

She's not in the house?

1436
01:41:43,056 --> 01:41:45,016
Frankie's on her
way to rehab.

1437
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:46,810
Rehab?

1438
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:49,604
What about her clothes?

1439
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:52,440
Someone will
bring her her clothes.

1440

It's not silver.

1517
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:13,154
It's yours.

1518
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,990
It's for me?

1519
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:25,166
That's so sweet.

1520
01:48:36,886 --> 01:48:38,513
It's beautiful.

1521
01:48:50,441 --> 01:48:52,443
<i>(Godshaw)
Yeah, I need
eight of them.</i>

1522
01:48:52,527 --> 01:48:54,696
<i>Yes, eight.</i>

1523
01:48:54,779 --> 01:48:58,616
<i>Uh-huh. It's
going down, baby.</i>

1524
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:02,078
Yeah, I got some help.
I'm telling you.

1525
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:05,498
Police Department.
Stand up. Keep your hands
where we can see them.

1526
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:07,250
What the fuck is this?

1527
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:09,335
We got it.
Check the outside,

1528
01:49:09,419 --> 01:49:12,255
check the backyard,
check upstairs,
check his car.

1529
01:49:12,338 --> 01:49:14,966
<i>We got this. it's okay.
Good. We're good.
Upstairs.</i>

1530
01:49:15,049 --> 01:49:16,259
<i>(Terence)
Cuff him.</i>

1531
01:49:16,342 --> 01:49:18,052
No.

1532
01:49:19,554 --> 01:49:21,639
No.

1533
01:49:21,722 --> 01:49:23,474
What do you
mean no?

1534
01:49:23,558 --> 01:49:26,728
This is what happens.
Before we can cuff him,
he goes for this weapon,

1535
01:49:26,811 --> 01:49:28,771
we shoot this prick
and steal his shit.

1536
01:49:28,855 --> 01:49:31,482
Fuck. Terence, what—
What are we doing?

1537
01:49:31,566 --> 01:49:33,568
I thought we had
our thing going.

1538
01:49:33,693 --> 01:49:37,572
<i>You're wrong, baby.
He acts like he likes you
'cause he likes to get high.</i>

1539
01:49:37,655 --> 01:49:40,783
Huh? That don't mean
he stop bein' the police.

1540
01:49:40,867 --> 01:49:42,160
<i>Cuff him, Stevie.</i>

1541
01:49:42,243 --> 01:49:43,911
No. Can you draw
a line of murder?

1542
01:49:43,995 --> 01:49:45,621
It's interesting
where to wreck its fun.

1543
01:49:45,705 --> 01:49:47,999
I said cuff him, Stevie.

1544
01:49:48,082 --> 01:49:50,376
<i>This is about money.</i>
<i>You want my fucking money?</i>

1545
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:54,338
You want my fucking money?
Take my money! You won't
kill me for this shit.

1546
01:49:54,422 --> 01:49:57,175
<i>Go for it, son.
Go for it.</i>

1547
01:49:57,258 --> 01:49:59,010
Got for it.
Go for it!

1548
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:02,764
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1549
01:50:04,807 --> 01:50:06,684
Next time.

1550
01:50:06,767 --> 01:50:09,228
Now fucking cuff him.

1551
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:15,902
I said cuff the
motherfucker, Stevie!

1552
01:50:15,985 --> 01:50:19,280
<i>[United States anthem]</i>

1553
01:50:24,994 --> 01:50:28,539
<i>[people singing
the anthem]</i>

1554
01:50:41,427 --> 01:50:46,140
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is an honor to conclude
this year on a positive note.

1555
01:50:46,224 --> 01:50:49,685
In recognition of his
leadership and tenacity

1556
01:50:49,769 --> 01:50:52,730
in the investigation
of the Ndele family murders

1557
01:50:52,813 --> 01:50:56,400
resulting in the successful
apprehension and prosecution

1558
01:50:56,484 --> 01:50:59,028
of the three
individuals responsible,

1559
01:50:59,153 --> 01:51:04,742
<i>I'm proud to include
Lieutenant Terence McDonagh
among those being promoted</i>

1560
01:51:04,826 --> 01:51:08,579
to the rank of captain.
Captain McDonagh.

1561
01:51:08,663 --> 01:51:10,081
<i>[applauses]</i>

1562
01:51:16,337 --> 01:51:17,713
Woo!

1563
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:36,691
Excuse me.
Would you care
for some wine?

1564
01:51:36,774 --> 01:51:40,027
No, thank you.
We're all gonna stick
with our sparkling water.

1565
01:51:42,697 --> 01:51:45,199
I would like
to make a toast.

1566
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,286
To the new Captain.

1567
01:51:48,369 --> 01:51:50,746
To new life.

1568
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:53,124
I'm probably
gonna start to
cry right now.

1569
01:51:53,207 --> 01:51:55,334
Oh, that's okay.

1570
01:51:56,627 --> 01:51:58,379
To my new family.

1571
01:51:58,462 --> 01:52:00,131
God bless.

1572
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:01,716
Here, here.

1573
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:31,329
You still gonna be working
on night shift when I get
closer to the due date?

1574
01:52:31,412 --> 01:52:34,665
I'll make sure I'm
not. How is that?

1575
01:52:34,749 --> 01:52:39,670
I could get to the hospital
and all, but I like having
you home at night.

1576
01:52:39,754 --> 01:52:42,089
I like it better
that way, too.

1577
01:53:14,372 --> 01:53:16,832
[women laugh]

1578
01:53:19,293 --> 01:53:21,295
Thank you, darling.

1579
01:53:46,779 --> 01:53:48,155
<i>(guy)</i>
<i>All right.</i>

1580
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:49,699
There we go.

1581
01:53:49,782 --> 01:53:51,409
Where are your keys?

1582
01:53:51,492 --> 01:53:53,160
<i>Did I give them to you?</i>

1583
01:53:53,244 --> 01:53:54,578
<i>No, I don't
think you did.</i>

1584
01:53:54,662 --> 01:53:55,997
Stand against the wall.

1585
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,206
What'd we do?

1586
01:53:57,289 --> 01:53:58,749
Hey, stand
against the wall.

1587
01:53:58,833 --> 01:54:00,459
What are you doing?

1588
01:54:00,543 --> 01:54:03,671
The two of you match
a description. Passing
drugs in the club.

1589
01:54:03,754 --> 01:54:07,466
Don't say anything.
Do exactly what
I tell you to do.

1590
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:10,010
So, what are we
high on tonight?

1591
01:54:10,094 --> 01:54:11,429
Nothing.

1592
01:54:11,512 --> 01:54:14,473
Empty your pockets.
Dump out the handbag.

1593
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:29,155
<i>[knocking at the door]</i>

1594
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:30,948
<i>Room service.</i>

1595
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:33,284
I didn't order
any room service.

1596
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:37,621
Oh. It must've been
a mistake again.

1597
01:54:37,705 --> 01:54:40,249
Holy shit.

1598
01:54:40,332 --> 01:54:43,127
I'm Evaristo Chavez, man.
You saved my life.

1599
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:45,963
I was in the prison
that was flooding.

1600
01:54:46,046 --> 01:54:47,131
Oh, yeah.

1601
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:48,632
Do you remember me?

1602
01:54:48,716 --> 01:54:51,052
Are you still with
the Police Department?

1603
01:54:51,135 --> 01:54:53,971
Port of call
still New Orleans.

1604
01:54:55,723 --> 01:54:57,016
Okay.

1605
01:54:57,099 --> 01:54:59,101
What happened with you?

1606
01:54:59,185 --> 01:55:01,687
The judge remanded
to a drug treatment
program.

1607
01:55:01,771 --> 01:55:04,815
November 14th
I have a year clean.

1608
01:55:06,192 --> 01:55:08,319
Congratulations.

1609
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:15,743
Are you all right?

1610
01:55:17,244 --> 01:55:20,414
Sometimes I
have bad days.

1611
01:55:23,125 --> 01:55:24,835
Listen,

1612
01:55:24,919 --> 01:55:26,712
you saved my life.

1613
01:55:26,796 --> 01:55:31,300
I'm almost done working.
I'm gonna get you out
of here, okay?

1614
01:55:31,383 --> 01:55:33,093
Okay?

1615
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:39,141
Do fish have dreams?

1616
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:01,789
You know, Chavez,

1617
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:05,292
I still hate
that I ruined
my underwear for you.

1618
01:56:44,415 --> 01:56:46,125
[laughs]
