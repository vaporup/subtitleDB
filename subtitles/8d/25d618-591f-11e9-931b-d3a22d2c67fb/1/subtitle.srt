00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:31,880
<i>Kevin Flynn: The Grid.</i>

3
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:35,925
<i>A digital frontier.</i>

4
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:41,793
<i>I tried to picture clusters of information,
as they moved through the computer.</i>

5
00:00:43,074 --> 00:00:45,047
<i>What did they look like?</i>

6
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,241
<i>Ships, motorcycles?</i>

7
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,685
<i>Were the circuits like freeways?</i>

8
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:53,258
<i>I kept dreaming of a world,</i>

9
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:54,770
<i>I thought I'd never see.</i>

10
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:58,204
<i>And then, one day.</i>

11
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:00,407
Sam: You got in.

12
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,630
Kevin: Ha, ha, ha, that's right, man.

13
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:04,332
I got in.

14
00:01:39,117 --> 00:01:42,541
Kevin: And the world was more beautiful
than I ever dreamed.

15
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:45,294
And also, more dangerous
than I ever dreamed.

16
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,468
Get in bed now, come on.

17
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,082
Now, I met a brave warrior.

18
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:53,887
- Tron.
- Ba, ba, bom, bom, bommm.

19
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:55,479
Kevin: TRON!

20
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,991
Sam: He fights for the users.

21
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,272
Kevin: He sure does.

22
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,847
Oh man, he showed me things that no
one had ever imagined.

23
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:05,832
Here at least. Disc battles fought
in spectacular arenas.

24
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:08,866
Cycles that raced on ribbons of light.

25
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:13,823
- So radical, and together,
- Sam: You built the grid.

26
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:15,584
Kevin: We built a new grid.

27
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:17,666
With programs and users.

28
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,784
Now, I couldn't be in there all the time.

29
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:23,936
So, I created a program in my own image.

30
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:26,933
That could think, like you and me.

31
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:30,831
And I called him,
CLU.

32
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:33,885
Codified Likeness Utility.

33
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:35,286
Kevin: That's right.

34
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:41,107
And CLU, Tron and I, we built the
system where all information was free,

35
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:44,600
And hope, beautiful.

36
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:49,127
And then, one day.

37
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,631
Something happened.

38
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:58,077
Something...extraordinary.

39
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,229
A miracle.

40
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,697
What was it?

41
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:11,351
That'll have to wait until next time.

42
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,886
How 'bout I get to work.

43
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,869
I'm wanna go with you, Dad.

44
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,810
Yeah, well.

45
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:20,505
One day, you will.

46
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:22,245
I promise.

47
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,647
To the grid?

48
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:25,209
Good night, Sam.

49
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:31,614
All right, what do you say tomorrow,
you and I hit the arcade?

50
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:33,977
You can have a crack at the old man's
high score.

51
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,883
First games on me.

52
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:39,873
Can we play doubles?

53
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:41,424
Sam: On the same team?

54
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:46,276
We're always on the same team.

55
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,263
<i>Good evening, our lead story.</i>

56
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:13,606
<i>ENCOM CEO and video game Icon,
Kevin Flynn.</i>

57
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:14,831
<i>has disappeared.</i>

58
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,214
<i>He was best known for designing Tron,
and Space Paranoids.</i>

59
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,951
<i>The two best selling video games in history.</i>

60
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:24,112
<i>Flynn took ownership of ENCOM in 1982.</i>

61
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:27,712
<i>And the company skyrocketed to the
top of the tech industry.</i>

62
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:30,167
<i>But things changed in 1985.</i>

63
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:34,280
<i>With the untimely death of Flynn's wife,
the mother of his young son, Sam.</i>

64
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:39,337
<i>Recently ENCOM board members have been
troubled by the reports of Flynn's erratic</i>

65
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:41,342
<i>even obsessive behavior.</i>

66
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,442
<i>With Flynn missing, the company
is now in Chaos.</i>

67
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:50,367
<i>This afternoon ENCOM's board moved to
seize control from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley.</i>

68
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:53,357
<i>Vowing to return the company to
profitability.</i>

69
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:58,669
<i>Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains
his belief that Flynn is not missing.</i>

70
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,643
<i>And is instead pursuing his dream of quote:</i>

71
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:05,141
<i>"A digital frontier to reshape
the human condition".</i>

72
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,392
In there is a new world.

73
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,470
In there is our future.

74
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,047
In there,

75
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:15,852
is our destiny.

76
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,780
 <i>Even Flynn's most ardent supporters are
now acknowledging a difficult truth.</i>

77
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:28,825
<i>Kevin Flynn may have simply, run away.</i>

78
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:32,046
<i>And while Flynn's loyalists hope
for his imminent return.</i>

79
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:36,102
<i>There is perhaps no one....</i>

80
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:42,320
He's coming.

81
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,726
He promised.

82
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:45,275
Kevin's mother: Sam, you have to eat.

83
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:46,400
Let go of me.

84
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:47,889
Sam.

85
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,581
<i>What will become of Flynn's legacy,
and the future of ENCOM.</i>

86
00:05:50,582 --> 00:05:54,572
<i>Will most likely depend on what becomes
of this now orphaned little boy.
- SAM!</i>

87
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,544
Kevin's Mother: SAM, come back.

88
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:56,101
Well that is a big door.

89
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:59,101
Welcome everybody, please settle.

90
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:03,178
I know it's late so I'll skip the pleasantries
and hand things over to our chairman.

91
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,660
Richard Mackey

92
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:09,743
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, Claire.

93
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:15,596
Tonight I am pleased to announce that
ENCOM's last fiscal year,

94
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:19,092
was our most profitable, ever.

95
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,635
Yes.

96
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:44,654
And at midnight tonight, the 12th version of our flagship
operating system will hit the shelves.

97
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:46,085
Around the world.

98
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:48,819
Richard: I'm sure it comes as no surprise,

99
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,243
who we have to acclaim. The head of
our software design team.

100
00:08:52,244 --> 00:08:57,314
A man who's father own uh, notable
history with ENCOM,

101
00:08:57,315 --> 00:08:59,839
helped make this company, what it is today.

102
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,939
Edward Dillinger.

103
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:07,120
Well done.

104
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:20,213
We will be making our Debut on
Tokyo's Nikkei index.

105
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:24,804
ENCOM's stock will now trade around the world.

106
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,302
24/7

107
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:28,742
Huh? Oh yes.

108
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:53,254
Excuse me,

109
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:55,341
Yes, Allan.

110
00:09:55,342 --> 00:10:00,505
Given the prices we charge to students, schools.

111
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,702
What sort of improvements have been made
in Flynn

112
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:08,228
I mean, uh, ENCOM O.S. twelve?

113
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,050
This year we put a twelve on the box.

114
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:19,356
Edward: O.S. 12 is the most secure
operating system ever released.

115
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:23,659
The idea of sharing our software or
giving it away for free.

116
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,180
Disappeared with, Kevin Flynn.

117
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:41,577
We know you're here.

118
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:44,089
Let's make this easy.

119
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:48,816
Come on, come on.

120
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,135
FREEZE!

121
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,207
Okay, if there are no more questions.

122
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:04,944
I would like you to meet,
our next blockbuster.

123
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,831
ENCOM O.S. Twelve.

124
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:11,824
Whoa!

125
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,508
Just a few...bugs.

126
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:21,674
Bear with us, one second.

127
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,670
Stop! Stop, stop.
Stop, stop, will you just stop.

128
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:27,674
For one second.

129
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,745
Nikkei will be open in thirty seconds.

130
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:36,543
Does anyone know where the master
file is?

131
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:37,553
I do.

132
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:40,761
It's on the web.

133
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,754
This is mad, gotta stop this.

134
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:50,730
We've got to ring that opening bell.

135
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:53,119
How is this happening,
we've got to stop this now.

136
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:55,657
No, let's just, shut it down.

137
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,973
- Shut it down, NOW!
- Relax.

138
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:01,144
Relax, it's under control.

139
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:02,301
Relax?

140
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:07,133
Our most valuable and most secure
operating system is out there for free.

141
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:08,595
How am I suppose to explain that?

142
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:11,957
I donâ€™t' know. Say it was all part of the plan.

143
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:15,401
A little uh, a little gift
from ENCOM.

144
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,106
Apparently ENCOM technologies is
having some...

145
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:19,501
- technical difficulties.
- No.

146
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,081
Hey, Dad.

147
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,195
What are you doing?

148
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:02,273
Guard: Where are you going to run to now?

149
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:04,169
Now you don't want to do that.

150
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,772
Didn't anyone tell you, stealing is wrong.

151
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:09,308
Can't steal something that was
designed to be free.

152
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:10,402
Now I got you.

153
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:12,697
Don't sweat it, your boss is
okay with it.

154
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:16,093
- The hell he is.
- Sam: Your boss works for the CEO.

155
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:17,927
The CEO works for the shareholders.

156
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:20,169
Now do you know who the
biggest shareholder is?

157
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:22,720
I don't know, some kid.

158
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,540
You're Mr. Flynn.

159
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:31,837
Why?

160
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,448
This is your father's company.

161
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:36,325
Not anymore.

162
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:38,712
Wha..., hey, hey kid.

163
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:40,504
No, NOOOOOOO!

164
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:49,102
Woo, hoo, hoo, hooo.

165
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,222
Yeah!

166
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,342
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

167
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,353
O...kay.

168
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,762
Hey, there he is, get him.

169
00:14:11,107 --> 00:14:13,675
HEY!
No free rides.

170
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,088
Whoa!

171
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:18,224
No free Taxi, you pay.

172
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:35,853
Hold it right there, freeze!

173
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:41,766
Okay boys, you got me.

174
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:44,508
Hey.

175
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,499
Enjoy it Marv, you earned it.

176
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:24,552
Why are you in my apartment, Allen?

177
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:28,392
You don't answer your phone.

178
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:32,662
How you been, Sam?

179
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:36,168
Oh, you know, when I was twelve,
I really appreciated the surrogate father thing.

180
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,507
But come on, Allen.

181
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,740
I got it all under control.

182
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:42,051
Oh, clearly.

183
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:43,972
What is it? You want to
help me with my home work?

184
00:15:43,973 --> 00:15:45,525
Like old times, have a catch.

185
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:51,146
Well you got a, pretty nice view here.

186
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:56,396
Heard you did a triple axel off
a roof a few hours ago?

187
00:15:57,901 --> 00:15:59,351
Rough landing, huh?

188
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:00,772
Hmm, could have been worse.

189
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:04,897
I also thought your message to the
board was very clever.

190
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,210
Oh, you like that?

191
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:07,827
Well, that was Marv's idea.

192
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,920
Allan, we really gonna do this again?

193
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,010
Do I really look like I'm ready to run a
fortune 500 company?

194
00:16:20,494 --> 00:16:21,496
No.

195
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:26,311
But truthfully, the companies pretty
happy with where you are.

196
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,235
See that way they can just keep doing
whatever they want.

197
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:37,324
Well I guess what I find curious is
the crazy charities,

198
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,427
the annual prank on the company.

199
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:42,391
Sure have an interesting way of being
disinterested, Sam.

200
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:43,646
Why are you here, Alan?

201
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:49,216
I was paged last night.

202
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,929
Oh man, still rocking the pager, hey?

203
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,573
Good for you.

204
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:57,899
Yeah, your Dad once told me I
had to sleep with it, I still do.

205
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,391
Page came from your Dad's office, at the arcade.

206
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,806
So.

207
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:10,919
So, that numbers been disconnected
for twenty years.

208
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:16,323
Sam, two nights before he disappeared,
he came to my house.

209
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:18,211
I've cracked it, he kept saying.

210
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:21,733
He was talking about genetic algorithms,

211
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:24,573
Quantum teleportation. He said he was
about to change everything.

212
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:27,214
Uh, science, medicine, religion.

213
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:30,139
He wouldn't have left that, Sam.

214
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:35,679
He wouldn't have left you.

215
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:39,189
Al, you're the only one who
still believes that.

216
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,788
He's either dead, or chillin' in Costa Rica.

217
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:44,188
Probably both.

218
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:46,630
I'm sorry.

219
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:47,896
I'm tired.

220
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:49,213
I smell like jail.

221
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:53,177
Let's just reconvene in another couple
of years, huh? What do you say?

222
00:17:58,487 --> 00:17:59,489
Here.

223
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,648
These are the keys to the arcade.

224
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:05,843
I haven't gone over there, yet.

225
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:08,956
I thought you should be the one.

226
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:11,775
Alan, your acting like I'm going to
find him sitting there working.

227
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:16,569
Just, "Hey kiddo, lost track of time".

228
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:21,648
Wouldn't that be something.

229
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:33,035
What?

230
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,451
(Journey's "Separate Way's" plays)

231
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:49,747
*Here we stand*

232
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:59,196
*Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two*

233
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:04,301
*Sleepless nights*

234
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,630
*Losing ground,
I'm reaching for you,*

235
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:14,646
*you, you.*

236
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:18,824
*Feelin' that it's gone*

237
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:21,435
*Can change your mind*

238
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,688
*If we can't go on*

239
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:32,407
*To survive the tide,
love divides*

240
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:36,145
*Someday love will find you*

241
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:39,845
*Break those chains that bind you.*

242
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,640
*One night will remind you*

243
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,589
*How we touched
And went our separate ways*

244
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,893
*If he ever hurts you*

245
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,020
You son of a gun.

246
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:33,016
Huh.

247
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:43,878
Sam: See you got a backdoor.

248
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:42,339
This isn't happening.

249
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:00,960
Oh man, this IS happening.

250
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,718
This program has no disk.

251
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,942
Another stray.

252
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:18,526
Wait, I'm not a program.

253
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:48,754
He actually did it.

254
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:54,159
I'm on the grid.

255
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:06,864
Does the name Kevin Flynn mean
anything to you?

256
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,816
Be quiet if you want to live.

257
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:14,101
Programs madly chants: Game, games,
the games. Not the games.

258
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:15,545
What's his problem?

259
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:09,202
Rectify.

260
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,222
Rectify.

261
00:26:16,794 --> 00:26:20,264
- Games.
- NO!

262
00:26:20,265 --> 00:26:22,276
- Please.
- Rectify.

263
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:23,913
Look I know you probably get this a lot,

264
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:25,421
But there's been a big mistake.

265
00:26:25,422 --> 00:26:26,424
Games.

266
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:29,802
Please, no, no, no.

267
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:31,248
Whoa, hey!

268
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,397
Erase me!

269
00:26:33,952 --> 00:26:35,145
AHHHHH!

270
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:39,303
No!

271
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,835
Can somebody tell me what the hell.

272
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:29,897
Hey, hey!

273
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,144
That's got a zipper.

274
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:50,423
He is different.

275
00:27:58,874 --> 00:28:00,489
This can't be good.

276
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:15,518
Attention, program. You will receive
an identity disc.

277
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:20,160
Everything you do or learn, will
be imprinted on this disc.

278
00:28:21,478 --> 00:28:23,201
If you lose your disc,

279
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,194
or fail to follow commands.

280
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:29,674
You will be subject to immediate,
deresolution.

281
00:28:36,003 --> 00:28:39,472
Nearly complete. Disc activated and synchronized.

282
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:41,085
Proceed to games.

283
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:43,552
Games?

284
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,027
Where you going?

285
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:58,153
What am I suppose to do?

286
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:00,077
Survive.

287
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:37,700
*Techno music blasting*

288
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:56,338
Combatants, prepare for Disc Wars.

289
00:30:34,562 --> 00:30:36,504
Platform eight.

290
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,960
I have a strange version of you on my shelf.

291
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:41,819
Combatants 3 and 11.

292
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:43,728
Disc wars.

293
00:30:53,617 --> 00:30:55,393
He definitely didn't do that.

294
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:29,196
Damn it.

295
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:38,755
So that's how it is.

296
00:31:56,377 --> 00:31:58,973
Combatant 11, deresolution.

297
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:01,094
I won!

298
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:02,979
Now let me out.

299
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:06,997
Combatant 3, round one, victory.

300
00:32:07,787 --> 00:32:09,573
No unusual activity on the grid.

301
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:12,299
Security sweeps and patrols
have been intensified.

302
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,252
Right to par, on schedule.

303
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:17,871
Your initiate should be fully operational
within twelve cycles.

304
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:22,420
Perhaps if you were to include me,

305
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:25,646
in this mission, l could be of
even greater service.

306
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:30,945
Computer: Combatant's 3, and 7.
Disc wars.

307
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:35,483
Computer: Initiate

308
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:40,051
Yeah.

309
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,546
I'm out of this.

310
00:32:49,214 --> 00:32:51,588
Combatant 3, victory.

311
00:32:56,202 --> 00:32:59,025
Combatant 3, violation.

312
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:03,251
Combatant 6, deresolution.

313
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,795
What is that program?

314
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:08,171
Combatant three.

315
00:33:08,172 --> 00:33:09,371
Violation.

316
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:17,285
Initiate final round.

317
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:24,360
Combatant 3, versus Rinzler.

318
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:33,910
You've gotta be kidding me.

319
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,233
Aw, come on, is that even legal?

320
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:09,254
Whoa!

321
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:18,889
Yeah!

322
00:34:29,308 --> 00:34:31,792
Why do I feel like I just got
dumped on.

323
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:40,598
Come on, huh?

324
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,533
Come on.

325
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:36,048
User.

326
00:35:47,669 --> 00:35:50,546
Identify yourself, program.

327
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:53,533
I'm not a program.

328
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:01,286
Cloaked man: Identify....

329
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:04,881
My name is Sam Flynn.

330
00:36:09,986 --> 00:36:11,332
Bring him to me.

331
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:15,724
Let me go.

332
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,008
Freaks.

333
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,045
Where am I?

334
00:36:27,045 --> 00:36:28,272
Am I on the grid?

335
00:36:30,787 --> 00:36:31,847
Who are you?

336
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:39,332
Dad.

337
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:40,956
Sam.

338
00:36:40,957 --> 00:36:44,072
Look at you, man.

339
00:36:44,073 --> 00:36:44,684
Look at the size of you.

340
00:36:46,528 --> 00:36:47,954
How did you get in here?

341
00:36:48,634 --> 00:36:49,920
I got your message.

342
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:51,621
Oh.

343
00:36:51,622 --> 00:36:52,864
So it's just you?

344
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:55,340
Yeah.

345
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:56,825
Just you.

346
00:36:57,274 --> 00:37:01,195
Wow, isn't this something.

347
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,755
Sam: You look the same.

348
00:37:03,756 --> 00:37:06,399
Oh, a lot has happened, Sam.
More than you can imagine.

349
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,418
This.

350
00:37:12,198 --> 00:37:13,874
Kevin: Let's take a look.

351
00:37:29,644 --> 00:37:30,748
Got it.

352
00:37:32,823 --> 00:37:34,569
Hmm, I expected more.

353
00:37:37,278 --> 00:37:39,841
So, you were trapped in here.

354
00:37:39,847 --> 00:37:41,450
That's right.

355
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:46,250
You're in charge.

356
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:48,156
Right again.
Two for two.

357
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:50,638
So, can we just go home now.

358
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,393
Not in the cards.

359
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,299
Not for you.

360
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:03,304
That's a hell of a way to treat your son.

361
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,192
Oh, that.

362
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:14,156
I'm not your father, Sam.

363
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,736
But I'm very, very happy to see you.

364
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,512
CLU.

365
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:29,324
Where is he?

366
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:30,535
Sam: What'd you do to him?

367
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:33,360
Same thing I'm going to do to you.

368
00:38:34,474 --> 00:38:35,676
User.

369
00:38:57,691 --> 00:38:59,583
Greetings programs.

370
00:39:03,327 --> 00:39:06,314
Oh what a vocation we have here
before us.

371
00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:11,519
Because, your rumors are true.

372
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,881
We do indeed have in our midst,

373
00:39:15,882 --> 00:39:17,976
a user.

374
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:23,331
Aaa uuuser.

375
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:28,075
Jarvis: So, what to do?

376
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:33,164
What does this User deserve.

377
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:36,587
Might I suggest perhaps,

378
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:38,615
the challenge of the grid.

379
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:47,991
And who best to battle this
senior opponent?

380
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:53,040
Perhaps one who has some experience
in these matters.

381
00:39:56,724 --> 00:39:58,773
Oh yes, indeed programs.

382
00:39:59,454 --> 00:40:04,617
Your liberator, your luminary.

383
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:07,773
Your leader and beacon.

384
00:40:08,632 --> 00:40:13,034
The one who vanquished the
tyranny of the user.

385
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,948
Those many cycles before.

386
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,873
I've been waiting a long time for this.

387
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,900
CCCCLLLLLLUUUUU.

388
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:24,318
You wanna play?

389
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:25,967
I'll play.

390
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:34,344
Excellent word, sir.

391
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:36,912
Were you pleased with my execution?

392
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:40,276
The crowd seemed quite energized.

393
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:43,510
It wasn't meant for them.

394
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:58,057
What's this?

395
00:40:58,822 --> 00:41:00,100
What do I do with this?

396
00:41:00,832 --> 00:41:02,203
I'll give you a hint.

397
00:41:03,517 --> 00:41:05,120
Not that.

398
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:16,152
Computer: Grid is live.

399
00:41:16,153 --> 00:41:19,091
Computer: Initiate light-cycle battle.

400
00:41:35,198 --> 00:41:36,843
You got no chance, User.

401
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:39,110
Their bots are faster than ours.
Use the level's.

402
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:46,277
Now this I can do.

403
00:42:19,227 --> 00:42:20,496
Here we go.

404
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,509
Whoa.

405
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,637
Hoh, oh!

406
00:43:30,126 --> 00:43:31,333
AAAAAH!

407
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,527
Hey.

408
00:43:46,495 --> 00:43:47,795
We gotta work together.

409
00:43:47,796 --> 00:43:48,997
It's the only way.

410
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,823
That's it, you got me.

411
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,291
Boo!

412
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,742
Whoo, hoo hoo, keep out.

413
00:44:13,743 --> 00:44:15,209
Now that's what I'm talking about.

414
00:44:16,443 --> 00:44:17,861
Sam: Another customer.

415
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:19,004
Let's go.

416
00:44:36,516 --> 00:44:38,131
Hang on buddy, I'm coming.

417
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:48,888
Come on.

418
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:03,365
This is it.

419
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:04,644
Come on.

420
00:45:29,578 --> 00:45:30,585
NO!

421
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:36,235
Illegal combatant on the grid.

422
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:37,407
Get in.

423
00:45:37,408 --> 00:45:39,580
Illegal combatant on the grid.

424
00:45:39,581 --> 00:45:40,581
GET IN!

425
00:45:46,665 --> 00:45:49,473
System failure, release Rinzler.

426
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:51,529
Game on old friend.

427
00:46:01,283 --> 00:46:02,556
Who are you?

428
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,219
Hang on.

429
00:46:32,492 --> 00:46:34,102
Oh man, you can't make that.

430
00:46:43,964 --> 00:46:45,138
Driver: Made it.

431
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,738
I'm, Quorra.

432
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:02,683
They're turning around.

433
00:47:02,714 --> 00:47:04,046
Not by choice.

434
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,247
Their vehicles aren't designed
to go off grid.

435
00:47:06,248 --> 00:47:08,022
They'll mal-function on this terrian.

436
00:47:08,023 --> 00:47:09,033
What about us?

437
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,056
Hah, obviously not.

438
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,148
Where are you taking me?

439
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:22,243
Patience, Sam Flynn.

440
00:47:22,491 --> 00:47:25,145
All your questions will be answered soon.

441
00:47:33,876 --> 00:47:35,234
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

442
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:39,893
Wait here.

443
00:48:43,843 --> 00:48:45,426
Quorra.

444
00:48:46,386 --> 00:48:48,357
I dreamed of Tron.

445
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:51,271
First time in years.

446
00:48:52,278 --> 00:48:53,381
It's a sign.

447
00:48:55,157 --> 00:48:57,943
A sign my dear friend, is
of a weary soul.

448
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:01,249
I'm afraid something's happened.

449
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,746
Something has happened.

450
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:05,061
We have a guest.

451
00:49:07,137 --> 00:49:09,541
There are no guests here.

452
00:49:32,955 --> 00:49:34,824
Sam.

453
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,677
Long time.

454
00:49:40,053 --> 00:49:41,766
You have no idea.

455
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,127
You're, you're here.

456
00:49:55,197 --> 00:49:56,637
You're here.

457
00:49:56,638 --> 00:49:58,770
I'm here.

458
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:08,831
You're big.

459
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,246
You're.

460
00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:13,945
Old.

461
00:50:18,444 --> 00:50:19,748
How did you get here?

462
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,387
Alan came over.

463
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:25,051
Really.

464
00:50:26,544 --> 00:50:28,357
He got your page.

465
00:50:28,823 --> 00:50:31,711
I found your office under the arcade.

466
00:50:33,309 --> 00:50:34,435
Page?

467
00:50:36,346 --> 00:50:39,741
Oh, man, of course.

468
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:46,199
CLU had him on the Light-Cycle grid.

469
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,716
I intervened.

470
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:50,392
Oh.

471
00:50:52,647 --> 00:50:53,911
Been there soon,

472
00:50:53,912 --> 00:50:55,823
CLU taught them.

473
00:51:10,575 --> 00:51:12,320
He never thought he'd see you again.

474
00:51:15,962 --> 00:51:17,086
Yeah.

475
00:51:24,737 --> 00:51:26,285
Vintage.

476
00:51:26,897 --> 00:51:29,615
Flynn built it many cycles ago for the games.

477
00:51:30,248 --> 00:51:33,027
It doesn't get out as much
as it used to, but.

478
00:51:33,028 --> 00:51:34,954
Still the fastest thing on the grid.

479
00:51:59,696 --> 00:52:00,737
Do you know it?

480
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,691
His patience usually beats out my more,

481
00:52:05,211 --> 00:52:06,680
aggressive strategy.

482
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:12,934
Flynn shared them with me.

483
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:14,952
I've read them all.

484
00:52:15,701 --> 00:52:18,470
Wow, you like reading.

485
00:52:19,106 --> 00:52:26,081
Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Lee Chang,
Journey without a goal.

486
00:52:27,084 --> 00:52:28,793
Must have a killer ending.

487
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:31,492
Flynn is teaching me about the art of the selfless.

488
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:35,342
About, removing oneself from the equation.

489
00:52:36,226 --> 00:52:37,973
But, between you and me.

490
00:52:38,576 --> 00:52:40,785
Jules Verne is my favorite.

491
00:52:42,402 --> 00:52:43,667
Do you know, Jules Verne?

492
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:44,928
Sure.

493
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,991
What's he like?

494
00:52:57,825 --> 00:53:00,248
Your move Flynn, come on.

495
00:53:01,174 --> 00:53:02,436
Come on.

496
00:53:25,571 --> 00:53:26,848
How old are you now, Sam?

497
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:30,190
- Uh,
- You should be 27.

498
00:53:30,194 --> 00:53:32,416
I just turned 27.

499
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,279
Do you attend a college?

500
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,607
Cal-Tech.

501
00:53:37,723 --> 00:53:38,913
Cal-Tech.

502
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,141
My Alma-Mater.

503
00:53:41,848 --> 00:53:42,850
Sam: Yeah.

504
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,595
That's why I dropped out.

505
00:53:54,123 --> 00:53:55,153
Work?

506
00:53:55,624 --> 00:53:59,100
- A job? ENCOM or you, uh...
- No.

507
00:54:00,226 --> 00:54:02,534
I check in once a year.

508
00:54:04,465 --> 00:54:06,740
- Life, girlfriend?
- A dog.

509
00:54:07,355 --> 00:54:08,424
I have one.

510
00:54:08,428 --> 00:54:10,710
A rescue.

511
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:13,112
Well, dogs uh, dogs are cool.

512
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,360
I'm sure you must have a few questions
of your own, Sam.

513
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,447
Actually, just one.

514
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:35,921
Why I never came home?

515
00:54:39,855 --> 00:54:42,345
Those nights when I went to the office

516
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:45,083
I'm sure you figured it out by now,

517
00:54:45,084 --> 00:54:46,085
was to come here.

518
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,569
Moving forward into digital space.

519
00:54:49,884 --> 00:54:51,566
Maybe, still.

520
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,615
But, I also had you.

521
00:54:56,871 --> 00:54:59,524
I had ENCOM, I couldn't be
in your world all the time.

522
00:54:59,526 --> 00:55:02,955
I needed partners.

523
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:04,160
To help out.

524
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:07,090
- Tron and CLU.
- That's right.

525
00:55:09,364 --> 00:55:12,579
<i>Tron was created by Alan for the old system.</i>

526
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,011
<i>I brought him here to protect this one.</i>

527
00:55:15,501 --> 00:55:17,207
<i>CLU was my creation.</i>

528
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,116
<i>A program designed to create a perfect world.</i>

529
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,095
We were jammin' man, building utopia.

530
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:27,769
Hours in here were just minutes back home.

531
00:55:28,135 --> 00:55:30,686
Just when I thought it couldn't get anymore profound.

532
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:32,812
Something unexpected happened.

533
00:55:33,728 --> 00:55:34,822
The Miracle.

534
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,677
The Miracle.

535
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,140
You remember.

536
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:42,107
Iso's

537
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:44,034
Isomorphic Algrarithm's.

538
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,688
A whole new life form.

539
00:55:46,784 --> 00:55:48,415
And you created them?

540
00:55:49,265 --> 00:55:50,265
(Laughs)

541
00:55:53,075 --> 00:55:54,403
No, no.

542
00:55:54,404 --> 00:55:56,107
They manifested.

543
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:57,917
Like a flame.

544
00:55:58,129 --> 00:56:01,178
They weren't really, really from anywhere.

545
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:03,622
The conditions were right, and
they came into being.

546
00:56:05,048 --> 00:56:08,981
For centuries we dreamed of
gods, spirits, aliens.

547
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:11,416
An intelligence beyond our own.

548
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:12,607
You seeing this?

549
00:56:12,608 --> 00:56:14,643
I found them, in here.

550
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,240
Like flowers in the waste land.

551
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,212
Profoundly naive.

552
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:26,008
Unimaginably wild.

553
00:56:28,881 --> 00:56:30,547
They were spectacular.

554
00:56:31,939 --> 00:56:34,192
Everything I'd hope to find in the system.

555
00:56:34,193 --> 00:56:37,616
Control, order, perfection. None of it
meant a thing.

556
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:39,973
But living in a hall of mirrors.

557
00:56:40,354 --> 00:56:41,742
The Iso's.

558
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:43,262
Shattered.

559
00:56:43,262 --> 00:56:46,736
The possibilities of their root code,
their digital DNA.

560
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,207
Disease?

561
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:49,515
History!

562
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,955
Science, philosophy, every idea,

563
00:56:52,956 --> 00:56:55,753
man has ever had about the universe
up for grabs.

564
00:56:55,753 --> 00:56:58,632
Bio digital jazz, man.

565
00:56:59,702 --> 00:57:02,814
The Iso's, they were going to
be my gift to the world.

566
00:57:03,227 --> 00:57:04,501
So, what happened?

567
00:57:05,794 --> 00:57:07,138
CLU.

568
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,502
CLU happened.

569
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:19,434
Kevin: Will you stop worrying about
everything, Tron.

570
00:57:19,438 --> 00:57:22,878
Kevin: Everything is fine,
everythingâ€™s under control.

571
00:57:22,881 --> 00:57:23,951
Flynn!

572
00:57:28,402 --> 00:57:31,028
Am I still to create the perfect system?

573
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:33,867
Yeah.

574
00:57:37,231 --> 00:57:39,044
Kevin: It was a coup.

575
00:57:41,655 --> 00:57:42,740
Go!

576
00:57:56,952 --> 00:57:58,128
You've been corrupted.

577
00:58:08,306 --> 00:58:11,515
Wait....wait!

578
00:58:13,686 --> 00:58:15,597
Flynn, go!

579
00:58:20,215 --> 00:58:21,217
Yahhh!

580
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:25,411
Tron, he fought for me.

581
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:28,448
I never saw him again.

582
00:58:30,016 --> 00:58:31,606
So why don't you fight?

583
00:58:32,904 --> 00:58:33,906
He did.

584
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:36,086
He fed on my resistance.

585
00:58:36,087 --> 00:58:38,705
The more I fought, the more powerful
it became.

586
00:58:39,236 --> 00:58:41,164
It was impressed with him .

587
00:58:42,224 --> 00:58:46,843
And my miracle? CLU saw the
ISO's as an imperfection.

588
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:49,267
So he destroyed them.

589
00:58:52,805 --> 00:58:54,110
The purge.

590
00:58:55,057 --> 00:58:56,391
He killed them all?

591
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:58,549
It was genocide.

592
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:03,341
I tried to get back. But I couldn't
get to the portal.

593
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:07,061
It uses massive power. And it can't
stay open forever.

594
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:13,713
And like a safe. It can only be opened
from the outside.

595
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:18,280
It closed on me, Sam.

596
00:59:19,707 --> 00:59:21,474
That's why I never came home.

597
00:59:29,117 --> 00:59:32,555
So the portal. It activated when I came in.

598
00:59:33,021 --> 00:59:34,461
So it's open, now.

599
00:59:34,462 --> 00:59:35,512
Not for long.

600
00:59:35,513 --> 00:59:38,149
Only one millicycle, about eight hours.

601
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,422
So, we go now.

602
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:41,745
Go home. Make a run for it.

603
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:43,378
- Get you out of here.
- Kevin: Don't rush.

604
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:46,281
What do you mean, don't rush. The
portal's going to close.

605
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,873
What? What is it?

606
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:54,150
The moment Flynn is on the grid,
CLU will stop at nothing to obtain his disc.

607
00:59:54,151 --> 00:59:57,579
My disc is everything, Sam.
It's the master key.

608
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,591
The golden ticket, the way out.

609
01:00:00,612 --> 01:00:02,188
But not just for me.

610
01:00:02,489 --> 01:00:06,582
- What do you mean?
- Our worlds are more connected
than anyone knows.

611
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:08,868
CLU figures if I can be in.

612
01:00:08,869 --> 01:00:10,257
He can be out?

613
01:00:10,258 --> 01:00:13,193
With my disc, it's possible.

614
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:14,557
And then what?

615
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:16,643
Game over.

616
01:00:17,764 --> 01:00:19,981
The guy doesn't dig imperfection.

617
01:00:22,325 --> 01:00:24,100
What's more important than
our world?

618
01:00:26,316 --> 01:00:27,971
I can't let that happen.

619
01:00:28,238 --> 01:00:29,929
I won't.

620
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,186
So what'll we do?

621
01:00:32,317 --> 01:00:33,319
Nothing?

622
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,941
It's amazing how productive doing
nothing can be.

623
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:37,882
CLU's planning something.

624
01:00:37,883 --> 01:00:39,708
We've known that for a while.

625
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:43,197
Programs have been disappearing,
there's unrest out there.

626
01:00:43,198 --> 01:00:48,277
Even revolution. If we sit tight, he might
be brought down from the inside.

627
01:00:48,674 --> 01:00:52,010
The portal's closing. We can't just sit
around. We have to move now.

628
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:53,048
Tell me.

629
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:55,112
What brought you here?

630
01:00:55,183 --> 01:00:56,602
Through the grid.

631
01:00:57,391 --> 01:00:59,400
Alan got your page.

632
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:01,526
I didn't send any page.

633
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:05,183
It was CLU. CLU sent that page.

634
01:01:05,184 --> 01:01:06,486
That's why you're here.

635
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,088
Kevin: This is all his design.

636
01:01:09,089 --> 01:01:12,096
He wanted a new piece on the board
to change the game.

637
01:01:12,608 --> 01:01:14,782
With you he got more than he ever dreamed.

638
01:01:14,783 --> 01:01:17,089
This is precisely what he wants.

639
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,312
Us together, heading for the portal.

640
01:01:19,997 --> 01:01:21,637
It's his game now.

641
01:01:22,108 --> 01:01:24,152
The only way to win is not to play.

642
01:01:26,158 --> 01:01:28,298
Now that's a hell of a way to win.

643
01:01:28,303 --> 01:01:29,655
But it is a way.

644
01:01:34,773 --> 01:01:37,147
We can go you home.

645
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:39,748
Don't you want that?

646
01:01:40,899 --> 01:01:44,350
Sometimes life has a way of moving
you past things like wants and hopes.

647
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,522
That's right, Dad.

648
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,618
Keep telling yourself that.

649
01:01:57,713 --> 01:01:58,924
Goodnight, Sam.

650
01:02:21,795 --> 01:02:24,555
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

651
01:02:24,556 --> 01:02:27,061
I mean, he built CLU.
Why doesn't he just end him.

652
01:02:28,803 --> 01:02:31,064
He could but it would require reintegration.

653
01:02:31,065 --> 01:02:32,095
Yeah, all right.

654
01:02:32,422 --> 01:02:34,602
Flynn would never survive the effect.

655
01:02:34,603 --> 01:02:36,288
It would mean the end of them both.

656
01:02:37,528 --> 01:02:39,884
If he refuses to save himself, then I will.

657
01:02:44,179 --> 01:02:45,180
How?

658
01:02:46,277 --> 01:02:47,680
I'm going to the portal.

659
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,450
CLU wants Flynn's disc, not mine.

660
01:02:50,451 --> 01:02:53,747
I'm going to find Allen and we're going to figure
this thing out from the other side.

661
01:02:53,748 --> 01:02:58,622
This may be CLU's game here, But in my
world he's gone in one keystroke.

662
01:02:58,624 --> 01:03:01,327
But I can't do anything unless I
get to the portal.

663
01:03:03,561 --> 01:03:07,330
My guts tell me that you don't want to be
stuck in this place for eternity.

664
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:13,378
I really think you should consider
your father's wisdom.

665
01:03:15,283 --> 01:03:16,443
I have.

666
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:22,321
There's someone I once knew.

667
01:04:22,644 --> 01:04:25,897
A program named Zuse, who
fought along side the ISO's.

668
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,921
They say he can get anyone, anywhere.

669
01:04:30,793 --> 01:04:32,290
How do I find him?

670
01:04:36,154 --> 01:04:37,629
This is his sector.

671
01:04:41,354 --> 01:04:43,001
Make it there alive.

672
01:04:43,002 --> 01:04:44,268
And he'll find you.

673
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:28,357
Sam.

674
01:05:30,018 --> 01:05:31,376
Sam?

675
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:15,563
Hey man, it's your lucky day.

676
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:25,284
Stop it.

677
01:06:35,764 --> 01:06:37,200
Sam Flynn.

678
01:06:38,406 --> 01:06:40,472
- You remember me.
- Yeah.

679
01:06:40,473 --> 01:06:42,601
You gave me some advice.

680
01:06:42,602 --> 01:06:43,906
And you followed it.

681
01:06:44,797 --> 01:06:46,997
Its unfortunate we met the way we did.

682
01:06:48,863 --> 01:06:50,259
You have a good night.

683
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,893
You're looking for someone.

684
01:06:55,322 --> 01:06:56,997
What makes you say that.

685
01:06:58,144 --> 01:06:59,642
Intuition.

686
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:04,711
Sir, sentries downtown,

687
01:07:04,712 --> 01:07:06,466
recovered Flynn's light cycle.

688
01:07:07,738 --> 01:07:10,211
They've traced it to it's component of origin.

689
01:07:35,941 --> 01:07:38,026
Prepare the light-runner Quorra.

690
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:41,209
We're going downtown.

691
01:08:04,265 --> 01:08:06,301
Thank you for bringing my son to me.

692
01:08:06,607 --> 01:08:10,670
Flynn, you don't need to go. I sent
him to someone we can trust.

693
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:12,787
Quorra, there is no choice.

694
01:08:13,637 --> 01:08:15,529
I won't lose him again.

695
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:21,551
Chaos, good news.

696
01:09:02,604 --> 01:09:04,931
Relax, they're occupied.

697
01:09:11,904 --> 01:09:13,438
His name is Castor.

698
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,032
You want to speak to Zuse you're
going to have to go through him.

699
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:18,134
Castor: Where is your sense of
humor, my friend?

700
01:09:18,135 --> 01:09:21,529
Programs are disappearing, Castor. Soon
none of us will be left.

701
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:24,660
Zuse can unite the factions,
ferment revolution.

702
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,692
Well of course Zuse can do these things.

703
01:09:26,693 --> 01:09:28,358
Grant me an audience.

704
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:31,297
Your enthusiasm is intoxicating
my dear bot,

705
01:09:31,298 --> 01:09:34,131
But Zuse's time is precious.

706
01:09:34,132 --> 01:09:36,398
We shall see.

707
01:09:38,306 --> 01:09:40,423
Whispers: I bought your boy, Flynn.

708
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,161
If you'll excuse me a moment, I have to, uh...

709
01:09:44,044 --> 01:09:46,449
Attend to something, but have a drink.

710
01:09:46,823 --> 01:09:49,229
Courtesy of the "End of line" club.

711
01:09:49,734 --> 01:09:50,835
It is happening.

712
01:09:50,836 --> 01:09:53,938
Come, away from
these primitive functions.

713
01:09:55,034 --> 01:09:57,458
The son of Flynn.

714
01:09:57,459 --> 01:10:00,150
Of all the innumerable possibilities.

715
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,679
He has to walk into mine.

716
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:08,464
Libations, for everybody!

717
01:10:10,398 --> 01:10:12,159
I'm Castor.

718
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:13,982
Your host.

719
01:10:14,065 --> 01:10:19,315
Provider of any and all entertainment
and diversions.

720
01:10:19,321 --> 01:10:20,657
At your service.

721
01:10:23,268 --> 01:10:24,799
I'm looking for Zuse.

722
01:10:25,406 --> 01:10:26,701
Indeed.

723
01:10:26,802 --> 01:10:28,309
Many are.

724
01:10:28,855 --> 01:10:30,240
Where can I find him?

725
01:10:30,925 --> 01:10:34,922
This pretty miss, is a conversation
best had behind closed doors.

726
01:10:34,923 --> 01:10:38,010
Perhaps we should retire to
my private lounge.

727
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:42,974
Uh, designed it myself, you know.

728
01:10:42,975 --> 01:10:44,392
It's true.

729
01:10:44,393 --> 01:10:46,957
I'm stepping away for a moment, boys.

730
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:49,174
Change the scheme, alter the mood.

731
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:53,641
Electrify the boys and girls,
if you'd be so kind.

732
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:57,708
Thank you.

733
01:10:57,709 --> 01:10:58,920
Gem.

734
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,474
My name is, Gem.

735
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:43,886
Cozy.

736
01:13:04,406 --> 01:13:07,042
- You are CLU.
- I am CLU.

737
01:13:07,043 --> 01:13:09,804
You will create the perfect system.

738
01:13:09,805 --> 01:13:11,875
I will create the perfect system.

739
01:13:15,837 --> 01:13:18,391
Together we're going to change the world, man.

740
01:13:45,724 --> 01:13:47,434
Let's move.

741
01:13:49,193 --> 01:13:53,140
Zuse has been around since the earliest
days of the gaming grid.

742
01:13:53,492 --> 01:13:57,434
By necessity.
He has to mine all the percentages.

743
01:13:57,815 --> 01:13:59,273
All the angles.

744
01:13:59,274 --> 01:14:00,983
So when do I meet him?

745
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:06,962
You...just...did.

746
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,295
Zuse: After the purge, I needed
to reinvent myself.

747
01:14:14,526 --> 01:14:16,556
Self preservation, you understand.

748
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:23,167
Now.

749
01:14:24,564 --> 01:14:27,022
What can I do, for you?

750
01:14:29,308 --> 01:14:31,210
I need to get to the portal.

751
01:14:31,671 --> 01:14:33,724
Well, it's closing quickly.

752
01:14:33,725 --> 01:14:35,272
As I'm sure, you're aware.

753
01:14:35,712 --> 01:14:37,280
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

754
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,482
And it's quite the journey.

755
01:14:40,014 --> 01:14:42,750
Beyond the far reaches of the outlands.

756
01:14:43,118 --> 01:14:48,563
Your father didn't want any programs,
slipping out accidentally, did he.

757
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:49,939
Can you help me?

758
01:14:50,394 --> 01:14:52,240
Of course.

759
01:14:53,053 --> 01:14:57,141
But first, as a man who prides himself
on staying well informed.

760
01:14:57,142 --> 01:14:59,122
I must ask, who sent you my way?

761
01:15:02,735 --> 01:15:03,878
Her name's, Quorra.

762
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,799
Said she met you a long time ago.

763
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:09,005
Indeed she did.

764
01:15:10,163 --> 01:15:11,877
Many cycles ago.

765
01:15:13,052 --> 01:15:14,929
It was a different time.

766
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:18,160
But we're not here to relive the past.

767
01:15:18,161 --> 01:15:19,862
Let's see about your future, shall we?

768
01:15:19,863 --> 01:15:21,112
Now, we'll have to, uh...

769
01:15:21,113 --> 01:15:23,933
change your attire, and you'll need
a forged disc.

770
01:15:23,935 --> 01:15:25,098
Not easy these days, by the way.

771
01:15:25,099 --> 01:15:28,044
And of course you'll need transport.

772
01:15:29,103 --> 01:15:31,222
To cross the sea of simulation.

773
01:15:42,554 --> 01:15:45,212
This is going to be quite a ride.

774
01:15:57,883 --> 01:16:00,261
I believed in users once before.

775
01:16:01,328 --> 01:16:03,084
Playing all the angles.

776
01:16:07,839 --> 01:16:09,451
Revenge!

777
01:16:17,888 --> 01:16:19,840
The game has changed.

778
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,456
Son of Flynn!

779
01:16:31,463 --> 01:16:33,479
Ha, ha, haaa.

780
01:16:38,322 --> 01:16:39,392
Met your friend.

781
01:16:39,393 --> 01:16:40,677
He's fantastic.

782
01:16:40,678 --> 01:16:44,734
Behold, the son of our maker.

783
01:17:09,263 --> 01:17:10,879
Yeah, yeah.

784
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:13,923
Yeah, yeah.

785
01:17:56,679 --> 01:17:57,857
Let's split, man.

786
01:18:19,209 --> 01:18:20,336
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

787
01:18:38,508 --> 01:18:40,091
Sam: A little help here, maybe.

788
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:03,579
Your Disc.

789
01:19:04,563 --> 01:19:06,115
Dad, it's gone.

790
01:19:06,918 --> 01:19:08,070
It is.

791
01:19:10,924 --> 01:19:12,829
I'm sorry, I know I messed up.

792
01:19:14,712 --> 01:19:16,404
Sam: We can go back, I can go back.

793
01:19:16,405 --> 01:19:18,024
No, we stay together.

794
01:19:18,623 --> 01:19:19,752
Dad, I can do this.

795
01:19:19,753 --> 01:19:21,470
You've done enough all ready.

796
01:19:27,097 --> 01:19:29,348
Sam, your really---

797
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:33,979
You're messin' with my Zen thing, man.

798
01:19:36,714 --> 01:19:38,012
She's stable.

799
01:19:39,034 --> 01:19:40,388
So what do we do now?

800
01:19:40,389 --> 01:19:42,385
I don't know.
Nothing.

801
01:19:43,441 --> 01:19:44,610
We do nothing.

802
01:19:45,776 --> 01:19:47,391
We still,

803
01:19:50,176 --> 01:19:51,369
...wait.

804
01:19:59,406 --> 01:20:01,239
You ever jump a freight train?

805
01:20:03,003 --> 01:20:04,003
Huh?

806
01:20:04,004 --> 01:20:05,391
We do it your way.

807
01:20:05,392 --> 01:20:07,191
It's a long sprint to the portal.

808
01:20:07,721 --> 01:20:09,867
If we beat CLU there we have a chance.

809
01:20:09,868 --> 01:20:11,093
Let's get her out of here.

810
01:20:29,736 --> 01:20:31,694
This will take us there.

811
01:20:58,684 --> 01:21:00,043
Is she going to make it?

812
01:21:00,044 --> 01:21:02,988
I don't know, I gotta identify
the damaged code.

813
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:06,867
The sequence on it is just
enormously complex.

814
01:21:08,824 --> 01:21:09,955
Sam: But didn't you write it?

815
01:21:09,956 --> 01:21:14,109
(Laughs) Some of it,
the rest of it is just,

816
01:21:16,095 --> 01:21:17,469
beyond me.

817
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:21,674
She's an Iso.

818
01:21:22,394 --> 01:21:25,006
Yeah, the last Iso.

819
01:21:26,817 --> 01:21:31,059
All this time you were just, protecting her.

820
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,870
She's the miracle, man.

821
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:35,183
Everything I ever worked for.

822
01:21:36,388 --> 01:21:39,650
A digital frontier to reshape
the human condition.

823
01:21:40,972 --> 01:21:43,540
I always thought that was just a plot line.

824
01:21:44,143 --> 01:21:47,488
In our world, she could change everything.

825
01:21:54,527 --> 01:21:56,628
Check that out.

826
01:22:04,314 --> 01:22:06,578
She risked herself for me.

827
01:22:08,207 --> 01:22:10,207
Some things are worth the risk.

828
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:25,655
Look at this.

829
01:22:28,517 --> 01:22:30,661
Now that is impressive,

830
01:22:30,662 --> 01:22:33,357
if I do say
so myself, huh?

831
01:22:34,006 --> 01:22:37,431
Come on, it's going to take a while for
her system to reboot.

832
01:22:37,564 --> 01:22:39,600
Now it's time for you to tell me a story.

833
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:01,029
The boy and Flynn are gone.

834
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:04,843
I presume your Excellency, they
perished in the elevator.

835
01:23:08,434 --> 01:23:09,718
You presume.

836
01:23:12,007 --> 01:23:13,037
Find them.

837
01:23:18,004 --> 01:23:20,269
Ice caps are melting,

838
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:21,808
War in the middle east.

839
01:23:21,809 --> 01:23:23,888
Lakers, Celtics, Batman.

840
01:23:25,545 --> 01:23:28,277
I don't know rich are getting richer.
The poor are getting poorer.

841
01:23:28,278 --> 01:23:31,444
Cell phones, online dating, Wi-Fi.

842
01:23:31,445 --> 01:23:32,756
What's Wi-Fi?

843
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:35,929
- Wireless sim-linking
- Of Digital devices?

844
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:38,499
- Yeah.
- Oh.

845
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,358
I thought of that when you were five.

846
01:23:45,649 --> 01:23:47,072
Mom and Dad,

847
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:51,433
- I assume let go
- Yeah.

848
01:23:52,965 --> 01:23:53,966
Oh.

849
01:23:54,512 --> 01:23:56,611
Back when I was twelve.

850
01:23:57,415 --> 01:23:59,322
Gram five years later.

851
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:04,637
You remember that night.

852
01:24:05,266 --> 01:24:06,533
When you didn't come home.

853
01:24:06,913 --> 01:24:09,758
- Well, you said,
- I said I'd show you the grid.

854
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:14,154
You should have seen this place
back then.

855
01:24:15,828 --> 01:24:17,399
Couldn't wait to show it to you.

856
01:24:19,635 --> 01:24:21,005
The net-way.

857
01:24:21,007 --> 01:24:23,198
Must have been something,
before CLU screwed it up.

858
01:24:23,686 --> 01:24:25,352
No, no, he,

859
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,247
he's me.

860
01:24:28,248 --> 01:24:29,727
I screwed it up.

861
01:24:30,923 --> 01:24:33,088
Crazy after perfection.

862
01:24:35,544 --> 01:24:37,638
Chasing after what was right in front of me.

863
01:24:39,915 --> 01:24:41,150
Right in front of me.

864
01:24:43,147 --> 01:24:45,479
Look what you've accomplished.

865
01:24:46,438 --> 01:24:47,964
It's incredible.

866
01:24:48,271 --> 01:24:49,272
Sam.

867
01:24:50,384 --> 01:24:53,535
I'd give it all up for one
more day with you.

868
01:25:07,376 --> 01:25:08,376
Hey.

869
01:25:08,377 --> 01:25:10,279
Remember your old Ducati?

870
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:14,447
You kidding me. There's not a day goes
by I don't think about that bike.

871
01:25:14,448 --> 01:25:16,122
Yeah, well. Fixing her up.

872
01:25:16,123 --> 01:25:18,505
What are you busting my bike?

873
01:25:18,506 --> 01:25:21,258
Well twenty years in the shed, no
tork, I mean.

874
01:25:22,106 --> 01:25:23,966
She knew you were her love.

875
01:25:25,855 --> 01:25:27,069
How's she running?

876
01:25:27,487 --> 01:25:29,543
Well, when I'm done.

877
01:25:30,184 --> 01:25:31,555
Better than ever.

878
01:25:31,557 --> 01:25:34,986
Aw man, I'd like to see that.

879
01:25:36,649 --> 01:25:37,758
You will.

880
01:25:41,973 --> 01:25:45,124
Here, she's rebooting, give her this.

881
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:49,522
Your old man is going to knock on the sky,
listen for the sound.

882
01:26:15,117 --> 01:26:20,706
When Flynn entered the space,
ahh, everything changed.

883
01:26:21,138 --> 01:26:24,061
Zuse: I've never seen anything quite like it.

884
01:26:25,301 --> 01:26:28,926
The aura was palpable.

885
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:31,926
Was it.

886
01:26:31,928 --> 01:26:35,403
I presume our understanding,

887
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:37,199
is still valid.

888
01:26:38,463 --> 01:26:40,113
Control of the city.

889
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:42,830
A sizable request.

890
01:26:43,118 --> 01:26:44,940
I know. But, uh...

891
01:26:44,942 --> 01:26:47,020
Seemingly fitting compensation.

892
01:26:47,029 --> 01:26:49,024
Don't you think?

893
01:26:50,522 --> 01:26:53,314
How long have you been searching for this?

894
01:26:53,315 --> 01:26:54,576
Hmm?

895
01:26:54,577 --> 01:26:58,014
A thousand cycles...huh?

896
01:26:58,571 --> 01:27:01,913
Just imagine the secrets it holds.

897
01:27:04,874 --> 01:27:06,378
The master key to any and all,

898
01:27:06,379 --> 01:27:10,082
riddles of the grid, grid, grid.

899
01:27:13,369 --> 01:27:15,195
There's something else, too.

900
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:16,848
Isn't there?

901
01:27:16,849 --> 01:27:18,868
I've heard the chatter.

902
01:27:18,871 --> 01:27:22,711
About this private initiative.

903
01:27:32,227 --> 01:27:36,423
I realize that our alliance is at times,

904
01:27:36,424 --> 01:27:37,784
uneasy.

905
01:27:38,405 --> 01:27:40,146
But always necessary.

906
01:27:42,005 --> 01:27:43,504
You know you need me.

907
01:27:43,507 --> 01:27:45,207
Right where I am.

908
01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:47,070
CLU.

909
01:27:47,989 --> 01:27:49,737
Of course, you're right.

910
01:27:49,738 --> 01:27:52,533
You have the drink.

911
01:28:00,668 --> 01:28:02,329
End of line, man.

912
01:28:12,246 --> 01:28:13,251
- (Gasps for breath)
- Hey, hey.

913
01:28:13,252 --> 01:28:15,016
It's okay, we're safe for now.

914
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:17,039
We're heading east, towards the portal.

915
01:28:20,137 --> 01:28:22,141
CLU has the disc.

916
01:28:23,432 --> 01:28:25,932
Once I get out, I can shut him down.

917
01:28:28,118 --> 01:28:30,140
I should never have sent you to Zuse.

918
01:28:30,141 --> 01:28:31,323
It was a mistake.

919
01:28:31,891 --> 01:28:34,548
It's okay, I made a few myself.

920
01:28:39,813 --> 01:28:41,191
Where is he?

921
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:44,660
I think he's knocking on the sky.

922
01:28:44,661 --> 01:28:47,521
And listening to the sound.

923
01:28:48,643 --> 01:28:49,922
Yeah.

924
01:28:50,772 --> 01:28:52,300
How did you find him?

925
01:29:02,274 --> 01:29:03,349
It's okay.

926
01:29:06,253 --> 01:29:07,295
I know.

927
01:29:12,884 --> 01:29:14,508
It was during the purge.

928
01:29:16,269 --> 01:29:17,790
CLU was relentless.

929
01:29:18,846 --> 01:29:21,338
The Black guard were executing
Iso's in the streets.

930
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:24,553
Everyone I knew,

931
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:25,762
disappeared.

932
01:29:28,527 --> 01:29:29,950
Then they came for me.

933
01:29:33,411 --> 01:29:34,545
So I ran.

934
01:29:36,105 --> 01:29:39,218
As sympathetic programs smuggled
me out of the city.

935
01:29:39,779 --> 01:29:41,480
but soon they had me surrounded.

936
01:29:42,386 --> 01:29:43,830
I prepared for the end.

937
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,890
And just as everything was going dark.

938
01:29:47,165 --> 01:29:48,699
I felt a hand.

939
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:50,439
On my shoulder.

940
01:29:53,118 --> 01:29:54,750
And when I opened my eyes.

941
01:29:56,561 --> 01:29:58,652
Standing above me,

942
01:29:59,466 --> 01:30:00,723
was the creator.

943
01:30:03,508 --> 01:30:04,905
Your father.

944
01:30:06,679 --> 01:30:08,327
He saved me.

945
01:30:12,443 --> 01:30:16,506
I guess you could say I'm,
a rescue.

946
01:30:35,869 --> 01:30:36,966
Sam: Hell of a view.

947
01:30:36,967 --> 01:30:39,876
It used to let us
know that Flynn was here.

948
01:30:39,879 --> 01:30:42,649
It became a symbol of something bigger.

949
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:46,084
Something, better in this world.

950
01:30:46,505 --> 01:30:48,725
I've never been this close before.

951
01:30:50,454 --> 01:30:52,800
It's how I imagined a sunrise to be.

952
01:30:53,341 --> 01:30:55,285
Ah, trust me. There's no comparison.

953
01:30:58,768 --> 01:31:00,235
What's it like?

954
01:31:02,823 --> 01:31:05,276
- The sun?
- Yeah.

955
01:31:06,353 --> 01:31:07,837
Oh, man.

956
01:31:10,027 --> 01:31:12,073
I've never had to describe it before.

957
01:31:14,624 --> 01:31:15,630
Warm.

958
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:19,103
Radiant.

959
01:31:22,303 --> 01:31:23,346
Beautiful.

960
01:31:49,535 --> 01:31:51,085
Get below.

961
01:31:51,802 --> 01:31:52,804
MOVE!

962
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:55,830
This isn't suppose to be here.

963
01:32:00,954 --> 01:32:02,168
What happened?

964
01:32:02,943 --> 01:32:04,597
A new course.

965
01:32:14,948 --> 01:32:16,463
What is this?

966
01:32:17,591 --> 01:32:19,573
CLU can't create programs.

967
01:32:19,574 --> 01:32:22,129
He can only destroy
and repurpose them.

968
01:32:22,691 --> 01:32:24,511
Repurpose them for what?

969
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:37,993
Sam: He's building an army.

970
01:32:38,549 --> 01:32:39,895
Let's go.

971
01:33:10,249 --> 01:33:12,282
- Goodbye.
- Quorra!

972
01:33:12,283 --> 01:33:13,241
Quorra.

973
01:33:13,245 --> 01:33:14,502
What's she doing?

974
01:33:14,508 --> 01:33:16,288
Removing herself from the equation.

975
01:33:34,736 --> 01:33:35,738
Tron.

976
01:33:37,977 --> 01:33:39,091
He's alive.

977
01:33:45,281 --> 01:33:47,174
We can't just let her go.

978
01:33:47,174 --> 01:33:48,240
Sam!

979
01:33:48,241 --> 01:33:49,581
There's another way.

980
01:34:03,739 --> 01:34:04,942
Well done sir.

981
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:21,652
Have you ever seen anything like it?

982
01:34:22,774 --> 01:34:24,080
Humbly, sir.

983
01:34:24,087 --> 01:34:28,837
I know you have greater designs,
then any of us understand.

984
01:34:30,462 --> 01:34:31,505
What does it do?

985
01:34:57,038 --> 01:34:59,311
She's going to wind up like one of them.

986
01:35:00,208 --> 01:35:01,760
Keep moving, Sam.

987
01:35:04,955 --> 01:35:08,294
(Programs chanting,
CLU, CLU)

988
01:35:11,964 --> 01:35:15,575
You are a very rare bird, aren't you.

989
01:35:24,237 --> 01:35:29,843
Where's your disc?
Where is he?

990
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:34,484
Must have been so lonely out there.

991
01:35:36,014 --> 01:35:38,752
Tragic to be the only one.

992
01:35:40,419 --> 01:35:43,618
I've seen what users are
capable of, CLU.

993
01:35:44,235 --> 01:35:46,093
You don't belong with them.

994
01:35:51,417 --> 01:35:54,485
I have something very special
in mind for you.

995
01:35:57,987 --> 01:35:59,589
Take her upstairs.

996
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:01,345
And find them.

997
01:36:02,659 --> 01:36:06,260
You'll have to excuse me. You arrived
just as I was prepared for the toast.

998
01:36:22,531 --> 01:36:24,439
CLU begins his speech:
Greetings programs.

999
01:36:28,462 --> 01:36:32,139
Together we have achieved a
great many things.

1000
01:36:32,174 --> 01:36:35,275
We have created a vast complex system.

1001
01:36:35,762 --> 01:36:37,290
We've maintained it,

1002
01:36:38,177 --> 01:36:39,293
we've improved it.

1003
01:36:40,147 --> 01:36:43,964
We have rid it of its imperfection.

1004
01:36:45,898 --> 01:36:50,705
Not to mention, ridding of the false deity
who sought to enslave us.

1005
01:36:53,012 --> 01:36:55,077
Kevin Flynn!

1006
01:36:56,319 --> 01:36:57,921
Where are you now?

1007
01:37:01,867 --> 01:37:04,268
My fellow programs, let there
be no doubt.

1008
01:37:05,082 --> 01:37:07,707
That our world is a cage no more.

1009
01:37:08,001 --> 01:37:09,596
For at this moment.

1010
01:37:09,730 --> 01:37:14,546
The key to the next frontier is finally
in our possession.

1011
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:21,408
The disc.

1012
01:37:21,523 --> 01:37:27,829
And unlike our selfish creator who preserved
the privilege of our world only to himself.

1013
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:31,419
I will make their world open,

1014
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:34,321
and available to all of us.

1015
01:37:37,162 --> 01:37:38,765
YES!

1016
01:37:38,766 --> 01:37:42,612
To all of us.
(Soldiers cheer)

1017
01:37:50,869 --> 01:37:53,033
Sam: He's taking all of us with him.

1018
01:37:53,268 --> 01:37:54,961
He's figured out how to do it.

1019
01:37:55,018 --> 01:37:57,302
And whatever we find there.

1020
01:37:57,305 --> 01:38:02,584
There our system will grow,
there our system will blossom.

1021
01:38:04,608 --> 01:38:08,833
Do this, prove yourselves,
prove yourself to me.

1022
01:38:08,834 --> 01:38:10,509
Be loyal to me.

1023
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:13,602
And I will never betray you.

1024
01:38:26,469 --> 01:38:27,899
Dad, we have to get your disc.

1025
01:38:27,981 --> 01:38:29,212
No we gotta get to the portal.

1026
01:38:29,213 --> 01:38:30,806
You shut them down from the outside.

1027
01:38:30,807 --> 01:38:32,958
Even if I make it out you won't last
in here.

1028
01:38:32,959 --> 01:38:34,989
- Quorra won't last..
- I said it will be all right, come on.

1029
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:36,893
Will you let it go, I'm not
going home without you.

1030
01:38:37,965 --> 01:38:39,096
Sam.

1031
01:38:39,857 --> 01:38:41,189
Same team.

1032
01:38:42,435 --> 01:38:43,573
Remember?

1033
01:38:46,076 --> 01:38:47,840
I was afraid you were going to say that.

1034
01:38:48,791 --> 01:38:51,187
Meet me on the flight deck in five.
And get us some wheels.

1035
01:38:51,188 --> 01:38:53,044
Wheels? What's your plan?

1036
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:55,557
I'm a user.

1037
01:38:55,705 --> 01:38:57,026
I'll improvise.

1038
01:39:01,535 --> 01:39:04,361
Rid the new system of its imperfections.

1039
01:39:07,505 --> 01:39:08,702
My vision is clear.

1040
01:39:11,937 --> 01:39:15,453
Out there, is a new world!

1041
01:39:16,247 --> 01:39:19,338
Out there is our victory.

1042
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,050
Out there,

1043
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:25,906
is our destiny.

1044
01:40:10,827 --> 01:40:13,140
Black Guard: Identify yourself, program.

1045
01:40:16,411 --> 01:40:17,694
I'm not a program.

1046
01:40:17,889 --> 01:40:19,568
My name is Sam Flynn.

1047
01:40:43,169 --> 01:40:44,371
Identify yourself.

1048
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:45,851
I'm taking this vehicle.

1049
01:40:45,852 --> 01:40:47,650
You are not authorized.

1050
01:40:50,174 --> 01:40:51,759
Right away, sir.

1051
01:40:53,267 --> 01:40:55,907
Watch your step please,
as you board the aircraft.

1052
01:41:08,207 --> 01:41:09,472
Down with the users.

1053
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,519
Master key, disengaged.

1054
01:41:20,428 --> 01:41:22,917
Master key, disengaged.

1055
01:41:22,995 --> 01:41:24,281
I came with a girl.

1056
01:41:24,794 --> 01:41:26,837
A program, where is she?

1057
01:41:29,861 --> 01:41:31,404
Sam. GO!

1058
01:41:46,295 --> 01:41:47,647
AAAAH!

1059
01:41:57,610 --> 01:41:58,944
What are you doing here?

1060
01:41:58,945 --> 01:41:59,946
We gotta get to the flight deck.

1061
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:02,068
But CLU will be here any minute.
We'll never make it.

1062
01:42:02,611 --> 01:42:03,612
Come on.

1063
01:42:09,447 --> 01:42:11,049
Come on, kiddo.

1064
01:42:14,744 --> 01:42:16,797
Radical, man.

1065
01:42:24,807 --> 01:42:25,808
Hurry!

1066
01:42:26,156 --> 01:42:27,157
Made it.

1067
01:42:46,451 --> 01:42:49,498
Try to hold on to this.
You're gonna need it.

1068
01:42:54,751 --> 01:42:56,371
You got this, Quorra.

1069
01:42:56,850 --> 01:42:58,594
It's all in the wrist.

1070
01:43:38,412 --> 01:43:39,973
Death to the user.

1071
01:44:04,594 --> 01:44:06,346
Head towards the light, Quorra.

1072
01:44:08,573 --> 01:44:10,596
Where did you learn that move back there?

1073
01:44:10,597 --> 01:44:12,206
ENCOM tower.

1074
01:44:12,207 --> 01:44:13,445
Couple nights ago.

1075
01:44:15,599 --> 01:44:18,564
ENCOM tower. Huh.

1076
01:44:20,314 --> 01:44:21,508
Light-jets.

1077
01:44:21,879 --> 01:44:23,353
Here they come.

1078
01:44:24,456 --> 01:44:26,899
- Sam, take the turret.
- Huh?

1079
01:44:34,933 --> 01:44:37,074
Oh man, I'm all over this.

1080
01:44:40,611 --> 01:44:43,303
Yeaah!

1081
01:44:51,228 --> 01:44:53,247
Yeah, ha, ha, ha.

1082
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,933
One down, five to go.

1083
01:45:00,593 --> 01:45:02,412
Nice.

1084
01:45:11,011 --> 01:45:12,525
We gotta split them up.

1085
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:33,822
Come on.

1086
01:45:38,108 --> 01:45:39,604
Have a nice swim.

1087
01:45:46,113 --> 01:45:47,475
You gotta get behind them.

1088
01:45:48,887 --> 01:45:49,889
Waoooo!

1089
01:45:56,153 --> 01:45:58,241
I don't think this is a good idea.

1090
01:45:58,242 --> 01:45:59,478
You're probably right.

1091
01:46:05,654 --> 01:46:06,908
He's gaining on us.

1092
01:46:27,138 --> 01:46:28,139
(Laughs)

1093
01:46:37,406 --> 01:46:38,591
YES!

1094
01:46:50,457 --> 01:46:51,796
It's jammed.

1095
01:46:57,191 --> 01:46:58,501
Tron.

1096
01:46:58,502 --> 01:47:00,449
What have you become?

1097
01:47:05,049 --> 01:47:06,336
Aw, come on.

1098
01:47:09,816 --> 01:47:11,853
Flynn, go!

1099
01:47:16,068 --> 01:47:17,544
Rinzler, take a shot.

1100
01:47:21,292 --> 01:47:22,505
Finish the game.

1101
01:47:30,697 --> 01:47:32,173
Noooooooo!

1102
01:47:45,019 --> 01:47:47,368
I, fight for the users!

1103
01:47:48,226 --> 01:47:49,619
Aaaaaaah!

1104
01:47:57,522 --> 01:47:58,524
That was him.

1105
01:47:58,525 --> 01:47:59,896
It's over.

1106
01:48:00,910 --> 01:48:02,142
It's over!

1107
01:48:04,342 --> 01:48:05,344
Quorra: Waoooo!

1108
01:48:13,478 --> 01:48:16,341
Quorra, there's something
I need you to do.

1109
01:49:05,099 --> 01:49:06,952
Let's get you home, Dad.

1110
01:49:11,221 --> 01:49:12,607
There it is.

1111
01:49:13,065 --> 01:49:14,210
Take her down.

1112
01:49:14,727 --> 01:49:15,828
Hang on.

1113
01:49:15,829 --> 01:49:17,296
This could be rough.

1114
01:50:09,732 --> 01:50:10,941
This is mine.

1115
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:18,980
Had a feeling you'd be here.

1116
01:50:20,493 --> 01:50:22,890
The cycle's haven't been kind, have they.

1117
01:50:23,308 --> 01:50:25,903
Well, you don't look so bad.

1118
01:50:27,667 --> 01:50:29,201
I did everything.

1119
01:50:29,633 --> 01:50:31,406
Everything you ever asked.

1120
01:50:31,841 --> 01:50:33,057
I know you did.

1121
01:50:33,464 --> 01:50:35,306
I executed the plan.

1122
01:50:36,086 --> 01:50:37,126
As you saw it.

1123
01:50:37,167 --> 01:50:42,411
You, you promised that we would
change the world, together.

1124
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:44,337
You broke your promise.

1125
01:50:44,338 --> 01:50:46,729
I know, I understand that now.

1126
01:50:46,731 --> 01:50:49,959
I took this system to its maximum potential.

1127
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:52,262
I created the perfect system.

1128
01:50:52,563 --> 01:50:56,299
The thing about perfection, is
that it's unknowable.

1129
01:50:57,226 --> 01:51:00,827
It's impossible, but it's also right
in front of us all the time.

1130
01:51:02,115 --> 01:51:04,957
You wouldn't know that because
I didn't when I created you.

1131
01:51:07,383 --> 01:51:09,118
I'm sorry, CLU.

1132
01:51:11,306 --> 01:51:12,962
I'm sorry.

1133
01:51:23,665 --> 01:51:24,865
(Grunts)

1134
01:51:36,002 --> 01:51:37,044
Go.

1135
01:51:50,328 --> 01:51:51,348
CLU!

1136
01:51:52,183 --> 01:51:54,078
Remember what you came for.

1137
01:52:08,359 --> 01:52:09,361
DAD!

1138
01:52:09,470 --> 01:52:10,939
CLU: You knew I'd beat you.

1139
01:52:11,394 --> 01:52:13,122
And still you did all this.

1140
01:52:13,123 --> 01:52:14,125
For him.

1141
01:52:20,615 --> 01:52:21,616
No.

1142
01:52:27,518 --> 01:52:28,520
No.

1143
01:52:29,001 --> 01:52:30,212
Why?

1144
01:52:31,464 --> 01:52:32,999
He's my son.

1145
01:52:39,566 --> 01:52:40,847
Gooooo!

1146
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:47,401
Dad!

1147
01:52:53,557 --> 01:52:56,232
Sam, it's time.

1148
01:52:56,233 --> 01:52:57,234
No!

1149
01:52:57,708 --> 01:52:58,710
Sam.

1150
01:52:59,043 --> 01:53:00,506
It's what he wants.

1151
01:53:02,547 --> 01:53:04,410
I'm not leaving you.

1152
01:53:04,809 --> 01:53:06,220
Take her.

1153
01:53:18,010 --> 01:53:19,477
Yes.

1154
01:53:47,127 --> 01:53:48,377
Goodbye, kiddo.

1155
01:55:33,041 --> 01:55:34,066
Alan.

1156
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,336
You paged me?

1157
01:55:41,501 --> 01:55:42,502
Yeah.

1158
01:55:43,414 --> 01:55:45,488
You jet ENCOM at 8AM.

1159
01:55:48,019 --> 01:55:49,300
What about the board?

1160
01:55:51,341 --> 01:55:52,716
We trim them out.

1161
01:55:55,472 --> 01:55:57,333
I'm taking the company back, Alan.

1162
01:56:02,194 --> 01:56:05,758
Oh, and you were right.

1163
01:56:08,115 --> 01:56:09,209
About what?

1164
01:56:10,742 --> 01:56:12,537
About everything.

1165
01:56:37,182 --> 01:56:38,664
What's next, Sam?

1166
01:56:43,973 --> 01:56:46,613
I guess we're suppose
to change the world.

1167
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:54,567
Come on, I want to show you something.
