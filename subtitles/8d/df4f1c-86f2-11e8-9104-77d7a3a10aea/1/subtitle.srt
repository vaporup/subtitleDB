CALLING YOU
"Only You Can Hear Me"

14
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,700
Who is it?

15
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,700
Excuse me.

16
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,700
I'm definitely
the only girl in this school

17
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,300
who doesn't have a cellphone.

18
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,300
Even though I'm like everyone else.

19
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,500
But,

20
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,300
I have no one to talk to.

21
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,300
There's nothing worse than

22
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,300
having a cellphone that doesn't ring.

23
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Next person!

24
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,400
Aihara!

25
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,700
Are you there?

26
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Next.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's your turn to read out loud.

29
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,300
Aihara.

30
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,100
Do you understand

31
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,100
the meaning of "read out loud"?

32
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,900
Forget it.

33
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
Next, Tanaka!

34
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Continue where she left off.

35
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,900
I am...

36
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,900
Alone.

37
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's cute.

38
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Ah, it's just a toy.

39
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,500
Listen to this, listen to this Dad!

40
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm going to play the piano
in the school choir competiton!

41
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
Choir competiton?

42
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Do you know
your Dad used to be a conductor?

43
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,400
Don't interrupt me...

44
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Don't keep on talking
and eat your breakfast!

45
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,500
Ryou.

46
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,300
You're going now?

47
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,500
I'll be going now.

48
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,200
Have a safe journey.

49
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Now, sit down and eat...

50
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,400
The first "him" is the object.

51
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,700
In the second sentence,
if you translate it the same way...

52
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,100
Um...

53
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Do you hear a cellphone...?

54
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,700
Sorry, never mind.

55
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,000
Why?

56
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why doesn't everyone else hear it...?

57
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,100
Hmm... you don't have a fever.

58
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,000
But you seem a little pale.

59
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,500
For the time being,
just take a rest here.

60
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Yes ma'am.

61
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Hello?

62
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,100
It worked!

63
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Hello?

64
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,200
Yes?

65
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,000
Woah...

66
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,200
The line got connected...

67
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Eh?

68
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
"Eh?" you say...

69
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Can you hear me?

70
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Yes.

71
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Can you hear my words clearly?

72
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,500
Yes.

73
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Wow...

74
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,500
You can hear my voice...

75
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,400
Um...

76
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,400
What's this about?

77
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Hello?

78
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Can you hear me?

79
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hello?

80
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Hello?

81
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Hello?

82
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
How? Why can you hear me?

83
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,600
I'm not sure myself.

84
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,600
How...? I'm not...

85
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,400
speaking!

86
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,000
Me neither.

87
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,300
I'm just speaking in my head.

88
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,500
In your head?

89
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,600
Yeah.

90
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I called this number
using a spoilt cellphone.

91
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,100
And you picked up.

92
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,700
What?

93
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,100
What's with this person?

94
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Me?

95
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Yeah, you.

96
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,100
I can hear you.

97
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,200
The teacher's coming.

98
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,100
Teacher?

99
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Are you a student?

100
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Aihara-san, how are you feeling?

101
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes.

102
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
I'm fine.

103
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,200
That's great.

104
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,100
You can rest till the next period.

105
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,100
Yes ma'am.

106
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,300
Hello?

107
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Can you hear me?

108
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm going to hang up now.

109
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,800
Hold on!

110
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Can I call again?

111
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,000
This evening, at 5 p.m.

112
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,300
But...

113
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,500
By the way, my name's Shinya.

114
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,000
Nozaki Shinya.

115
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What about you?

116
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,400
Aihara.

117
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,300
Aihara Ryou.

118
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,700
Then, Aihara-san.

119
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Till next time.

120
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Nozaki Shinya...

121
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,400
What the hell are you doing?

122
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Stop fooling around!

123
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,200
That'll be a total of 800 yen.

124
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm home.

125
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,500
Welcome home.

126
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,900
Miki's playing the piano isn't she?

127
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,100
Ah, look at the time!

128
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,100
I'll have to make her stop.

129
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,100
You shouldn't play after 6.

130
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,000
But...!

131
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You'll disturb the neighbours.

132
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
Ah, hello?

133
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,200
Aihara Ryou-san?

134
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
It's Nozaki.

135
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,000
Can you hear me?

136
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,100
Yup.

137
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,000
That's good.

138
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I was thinking "what if she can't hear me...?"

139
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,300
But, sorry.

140
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,000
Even though I promised to call you at 5...

141
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,500
But I'm a little late.

142
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,500
But thankfully
I got to speak with you again.

143
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,700
I...

144
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,700
I don't really understand this...

145
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,100
You're not really there are you?

146
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
You're just part of my imagination.

147
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,600
That's our conversation isn't real.

148
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,000
When I think of it that way...

149
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,800
Well.

150
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,000
Let's confirm it.

151
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Huh?

152
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,000
Have you reached?

153
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes.

154
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,300
I'm at the magazine corner.

155
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,300
The magazines in front of you,
you've not read any of them before right?

156
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,000
Nope.

157
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,100
Me too.

158
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,500
In other words,

159
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,200
Both of us won't know
what are their contents.

160
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,000
Therefore,

161
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
If I tell you
what's inside these magazines,

162
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You can't be someone from my imagination.

163
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And we can prove you really exist.

164
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Do you have "Gekkan Shounen Ace" over there?

165
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Yes.

166
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Could you pick a page from it?

167
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,700
Well then...

168
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,700
Page 12.

169
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's an ad.

170
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It seems to be for a gym machine.

171
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
"Effective for training
the abdominal and back muscles."

172
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Hold on a second.

173
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,600
"Effective for training
the abdominal and back muscles."

174
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,500
It's there...

175
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,300
Well,

176
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,300
It's your turn to pick a magazine.

177
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,400
Um,

178
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Do you have "Da Vinci" over there?

179
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,800
Found it.

180
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,000
Well,

181
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Page 32.

182
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,200
Ah.

183
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,200
What's written there?

184
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,700
Can't we use another page?

185
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,300
Huh? Why?

186
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,200
You can't find the page?

187
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,000
Um... it's not that...

188
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
A boy...

189
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
is thrusting his butt out... um.

190
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Butt?

191
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,900
Ah...

192
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,900
Let's use another page then.

193
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,500
We're both real.

194
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,400
That's the proof.

195
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,300
But I...

196
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,300
can't really believe it...

197
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,000
Me too.

198
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That I'm talking to someone else...

199
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,400
What a beautiful full moon.

200
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,900
Huh?

201
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,900
Full moon?

202
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,000
It's true.

203
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's still in the east sky.

204
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Where do you stay, Nozaki-san?

205
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,000
Me?

206
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,400
I live in Nagano.

207
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,700
What about you, Aihara-san?

208
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Yokohama.

209
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,300
Can you hear it?

210
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,000
What?

211
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I can only hear your voice.

212
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The church is ringing
the 7 p.m. bell.

213
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,700
7 p.m.?

214
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,700
Isn't it 6 p.m.?

215
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,100
Hold on...

216
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,000
On your side,

217
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
what's the date today?

218
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
11th June.

219
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,400
The year is 2007?

220
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Yes.

221
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
The date is the same.

222
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,500
I see...

223
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,200
There's a time difference.

224
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,600
Time difference?

225
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,500
Between Nagano and Yokohama?

226
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,200
No, that's not it.

227
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,300
Between our mental cellphones.

228
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,300
There's a 1 hour time difference between us.

229
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,200
A 1 hour time difference?

230
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,200
That's the other time...

231
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
You were late the other time you called.

232
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah.

233
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Ah, found something good.

234
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Ah, it's nothing.

235
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,100
Ryou-san.

236
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,500
Yes?

237
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,300
You can call me Shinya.

238
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,200
Eh?

239
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,200
You don't have to be so formal.

240
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,300
Ryou-san, can you hear me?

241
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,900
Yes.

242
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,900
Then, Ryou-san, let's talk again.

243
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,000
Yup,

244
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,700
Nozaki-san...

245
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,800
I mean,

246
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Shinya-san.

247
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Welcome back.

248
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,400
You went there again?

249
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Dinner is ready.

250
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:50,164
The neighbour's girl is getting married.

251
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Let's eat, shall we?

252
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,574
Hello?

253
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,752
Shinya-san?

254
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:11,507
Hello?

255
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:14,104
Huh?

256
00:28:14,104 --> 00:28:16,172
Um... hello?

257
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,400
I got the wrong person! Sorry!

258
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,000
Hold on.

259
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,500
Don't hang up.

260
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,000
Eh?

261
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,177
It's been some time
since someone called on the mental cellphone.

262
00:28:31,097 --> 00:28:32,381
I was a little surprised.

263
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,700
Since you went to the trouble of calling...

264
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,700
If it's okay, shall we talk?

265
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,900
Sure. But...

266
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,300
Ah, sorry!

267
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,300
I'm Harada.

268
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,400
I'm...

269
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,100
Aihara Ryou.

270
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,100
I see. Ryou-san, isn't it?

271
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,200
But...

272
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,200
I didn't think
there would be someone else like this.

273
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,000
"Someone else"?

274
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,300
It's another person called Nozaki Shinya.

275
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,520
He called me suddenly the other day.

276
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:25,000
By any chance, do you know about it?

277
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Nozaki-san...

278
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,200
Ah, sorry!

279
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,600
Can you hold on for a while?

280
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Next,
we'll be practising passing in pairs.

281
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,800
You don't have a partner?

282
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Hey, you two! Practise with Aihara.

283
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
Ryou-san.

284
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,200
What happened?

285
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,500
Sorry.

286
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,800
I'm practising basketball for PE now.

287
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,400
Basketball?

288
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,600
Ah, I see.

289
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,100
You're a student.

290
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,400
Yes.

291
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
I'm a high school sophomore.

292
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,100
That'll make you 16 won't it?

293
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,800
That's nice...

294
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,300
You're 10 years younger than me.

295
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,300
Is it okay
to talk since you're playing basketball?

296
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Harada-san?

297
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,900
Wow...

298
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,600
You work in a recycling shop?

299
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,000
That's right.

300
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You might think it's strange,

301
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,100
when I look at things people throw away,
it feels like they're calling out to me.

302
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
They're calling out to you?

303
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,500
"Please pick me up.
I can still be used!"

304
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,800
The watch I'm wearing now
used to be trash.

305
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,300
It's really old, but I like it
because of it's antique-ness.

306
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,500
Ah, but you can't see it even if I say so.

307
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,300
Somehow I'm happy.

308
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,300
Everyone in school
uses their cellphone to tell the time.

309
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm about the only one
who still uses a watch.

310
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,600
What does your watch look like?

311
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,100
It's red and round.

312
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,900
I've had it since I was young.

313
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,900
It's a bit childish.

314
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,500
It's a happy thing isn't it,
that red watch of yours?

315
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,200
Since you treasure it so much.

316
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Eh?

317
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,500
I don't really...

318
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,000
Can't it be fixed?

319
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,900
Sorry, it can't be fixed.

320
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,700
Is my TV fixed yet?

321
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,700
Over here.

322
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Hello?

323
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,400
Shinya-san?

324
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Sorry, let's speak later.

325
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,000
"I'll fix it for you!"

326
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Really?

327
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You're not sleeping yet?

328
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,000
A music box?

329
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Can you fix it?

330
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Yes, of course.

331
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
"WORLD HISTORY TEST"

332
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You can start writing now.

333
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Hello?

334
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,000
You can depend on me.

335
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,600
It really got through?

336
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,500
Yup!

337
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,200
World history is my specialty.

338
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Leave it up to me.

339
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
That's not what I meant...

340
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,300
I didn't mean I wanted you to help me...

341
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,300
Well, shall I hang up then?

342
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,900
No, hold on.

343
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,500
You'll be able to see a shooting star
soon in the sky in the east.

344
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,000
Eh?

345
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I made a wish
when I saw it here an hour ago.

346
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,200
What did you wish for?

347
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,200
It's a secret!

348
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,000
I just

349
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,600
made a wish upon the shooting star.

350
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,000
What did you wish for?

351
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It's a secret!

352
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,200
Hello?

353
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,600
Ryou?

354
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,600
What's up, Shinya-san?

355
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:23,700
I'm working on
something really hard now.

356
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Something hard?

357
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,812
I don't have the required parts,
so it'll be tough fixing it.

358
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
But,

359
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,800
I want to fix it no matter what.

360
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,500
I see.

361
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,500
It'll be great if you can fix it.

362
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:53,840
After this is fixed,

363
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,456
After I fix this,

364
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:01,190
I thought I'd come see you.

365
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Huh?

366
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,000
I want to see you.

367
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Can't I?

368
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:37,100
I see, you rejected him?

369
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,000
Sorry!

370
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
There isn't anyone else
I can talk with about this.

371
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I really enjoy talking with Shinya-san...

372
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,600
That's why,

373
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,496
if you met, you're afraid you won't like him.

374
00:37:56,393 --> 00:37:57,346
Huh?

375
00:37:58,332 --> 00:38:02,300
You're afraid,
so you're being pessimistic.

376
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,526
It's easier that way isn't it?

377
00:38:05,356 --> 00:38:08,840
That way, you won't get hurt.

378
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:14,722
"Eh, isn't that guy a foreigner?"

379
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,000
Ryou-san.

380
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,300
Do you want to meet him?

381
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,800
Or don't you?

382
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,800
About that...

383
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,700
Um...

384
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,400
I...

385
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,200
want to meet him.

386
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,500
Then, the answer is easy.

387
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,600
It'll be fine if you meet him.

388
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,300
I want to meet him...

389
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,400
But,

390
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,400
now isn't the right time.

391
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,500
I see.

392
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Don't push yourself then.

393
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,000
But,

394
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
there's no "right time"
for your feelings about meeting him.

395
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,900
If you want to meet him,

396
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,900
that's the "right time".

397
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:29,288
Hurry up, Dad!

398
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,300
Here, your handkerchief.

399
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,000
Ryou!

400
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,311
We're leaving now.

401
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,774
Remember to lock up.

402
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,300
We'll be back in the evening.

403
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,753
I'll be leaving now, big sis.

404
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
We'll be leaving!

405
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,800
"Will we meet? Or won't we?"
That's all I could think of...

406
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,000
Aihara!

407
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,500
Speak up more confidently!

408
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,500
Don't speak like a caterpillar!

409
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,800
What's wrong?

410
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,800
You sound down.

411
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,500
Today,

412
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,500
I was laughed at again.

413
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,100
Because my voice
was like a caterpillar.

414
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,000
That can't be...

415
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
That's not true.

416
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,400
No...

417
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,700
It's not just today.

418
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,500
It's always been like this.

419
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,400
Whenever I speak up,

420
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,500
I get nervous,

421
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,700
and start stammering,

422
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,700
and my voice turns inside out.

423
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,100
In the end I get laughed at.

424
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,300
It must be because

425
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,500
I don't want to talk to anyone

426
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,000
or get involved with anyone.

427
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
That's how I compensate
when I can't speak up.

428
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,800
That's why

429
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,700
I started making phone calls in my head.

430
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,700
That's not true.

431
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,400
I can hear your voice properly

432
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,500
when you talk with me.

433
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,000
That's because I'm talking in my head!

434
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,400
In real life I can't speak up like this.

435
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,500
You won't understand.

436
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,500
It doesn't matter
even if I disappear!

437
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,500
Even if I disappear,

438
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,000
nothing will change.

439
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
No one will even realise it!

440
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That's why...

441
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,000
The wind...

442
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Wow, that's cool!

443
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
The figurines are moving!

444
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Hey, Ryou.

445
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,600
This weekend...

446
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Will you go on a date with me?

447
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,300
Huh?

448
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:25,796
Alright, let's start off!

449
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,467
Just listen to my directions.

450
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,400
Go straight ahead,
and cross the red bridge.

451
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I got it.

452
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,000
Somehow this is unbelievable...

453
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Because it's a long-distance date?

454
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But it feels
like you're just by my side.

455
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,400
Yup, I am.

456
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Just think of it that way.

457
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,600
Have you been
to Kamakura [near Tokyo] before?

458
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,300
Actually, I lived there.

459
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,300
Till I was a sophomore in middle school.

460
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,500
Really?

461
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,300
Hey Ryou,

462
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,400
Can I ask you something?

463
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,200
What is it?

464
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,800
The bad experience you have,

465
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,800
when you speak to others.

466
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,100
But...

467
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,500
It's okay.

468
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Don't worry about it, you can talk freely.

469
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,600
Okay.

470
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,200
It was when I was in my 2nd year
of elementary school.

471
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,200
I took part in a piano recital.

472
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,300
At first,

473
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,200
I wore a pretty doll-like dress,

474
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,200
I was all made up
and really excited about it.

475
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,400
"That dress is pretty!"

476
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,000
"And you're really great
at playing the piano!"

477
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,400
My friends praised me like so.

478
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,400
I was on top of the world.

479
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,600
But,

480
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,600
those were all lies.

481
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,200
Lies?

482
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,400
"Ryou really sucks!"

483
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,500
"Isn't that dress weird?"

484
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,500
I was laughed at
by my friends after the recital.

485
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,800
Since then,
I didn't know how to talk to others.

486
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,800
Of course,
I also stopped playing the piano.

487
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I see.

488
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It might just be that I'm timid.

489
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,200
But I'm slow,

490
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,600
so I can't
if people are being sarcastic.

491
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,600
So I take everything seriously.

492
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,500
That's why I'm scared.

493
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,100
Someone who's flawed like me,

494
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,100
has to be careful
so she doesn't get into accidents.

495
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,400
I understand.

496
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,200
It's tough to be laughed at by others.

497
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,000
But, Ryou,

498
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,700
You're wrong about one thing.

499
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,700
Hm?

500
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
You're not flawed.

501
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,300
You

502
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,800
consider other people's words seriously.

503
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,400
You consider each and every word,

504
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,400
and reflect on them
so you can answer meaningfully.

505
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,600
That's why,

506
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,600
you notice too many lies.

507
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,900
But it's alright.

508
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,300
It's proof that,

509
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,300
you're really
considering my feelings when we talk.

510
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Shinya-san...

511
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,885
I really like it.

512
00:48:46,408 --> 00:48:48,036
Your voice,

513
00:48:48,466 --> 00:48:49,957
as well as your words.

514
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,281
From there, you should be able to see
a shop called "Toda Marine Services".

515
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:23,823
Yup, I see it!

516
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,300
I'd like you to go inside,
and get something for me.

517
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,000
It's something from me.

518
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,700
"Something?"

519
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,194
From here, you'll go alone.

520
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,200
See you.

521
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,200
Hold on...

522
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Excuse me...

523
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,200
Excuse me!

524
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,200
What is it?

525
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Sorry for coming suddenly...

526
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,700
I'm Aihara.

527
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,700
I came here to get something
that Nozaki Shinya-san left here.

528
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,300
It's you isn't it?

529
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,700
Hold on.

530
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,700
He used to live here a long time ago.

531
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:50,701
Here you go. Thank you!

532
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Take care of it!

533
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Um...

534
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,733
Shinya was a really weird guy.

535
00:51:23,904 --> 00:51:25,010
Here you go.

536
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,200
He was always coming around,
saying "please fix this for me".

537
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,300
When I saw that face, I couldn't refuse.

538
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
He was happy just to come around.

539
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,144
And now he's fixing things for a living.

540
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,000
No matter
how many days it took to fix it,

541
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
even if it was something
he wanted he'd give it away.

542
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,600
Even after it was finally fixed?

543
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,600
Yup.

544
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,500
Isn't that sad?

545
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,000
If it was me,

546
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I wouldn't want to give away
I tried so hard to fix.

547
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,400
He wasn't like that.

548
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,400
He would say: "Things I repaired
will always remember I repaired them."

549
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,471
Always remember?

550
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:32,000
Because he liked repairing things,
he got along okay as a kid.

551
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:38,100
I don't really understand though.

552
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,200
Shinya-san, I got it.

553
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,000
That's great.

554
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,700
Where should I go next?

555
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:04,700
It's a place I really like.

556
00:54:33,198 --> 00:54:36,099
"To Ryou"

557
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:47,530
To Ryou.

558
00:54:48,442 --> 00:54:53,302
The cassette recorder in the box
was something I picked up and repaired.

559
00:54:53,942 --> 00:54:55,878
I'd like you to have it.

560
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,853
But, I have a request.

561
00:55:07,442 --> 00:55:10,942
I'd like you to record your voice,

562
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:12,882
in this tape, and send it to me.

563
00:55:15,742 --> 00:55:19,742
Speak loudly, and say anything you want.

564
00:56:30,842 --> 00:56:32,842
Um,

565
00:56:32,842 --> 00:56:36,842
I wonder if you can hear me...?

566
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:42,142
I'm Aihara Ryou.

567
00:56:42,142 --> 00:56:46,142
I'm now at the beach at Kamakura.

568
00:56:47,642 --> 00:56:51,642
As Shinya-san told me to,
I'm recording my voice now.

569
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:56,742
Even though I'm feeling
really embarrassed.

570
00:56:58,042 --> 00:57:02,042
Can you hear me?

571
00:57:02,242 --> 00:57:05,742
Shinya-san!

572
00:57:05,742 --> 00:57:09,742
Is my voice carrying through?

573
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:16,642
It'll be summer soon!

574
00:57:19,642 --> 00:57:23,642
Shinya-san,

575
00:57:23,842 --> 00:57:27,042
When summer comes,

576
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:31,042
I want to meet you!

577
00:58:26,842 --> 00:58:30,842
Thank you!

578
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:36,942
It's fixed!

579
00:58:37,742 --> 00:58:41,742
Thank you so much!

580
00:58:43,442 --> 00:58:47,042
How much is it?

581
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:50,742
But...

582
00:58:50,742 --> 00:58:54,742
Thank you!

583
00:58:55,042 --> 00:58:58,542
Bye bye, big brother!

584
00:58:58,542 --> 00:58:59,782
Let's go shall we?

585
00:59:09,342 --> 00:59:14,623
Mankind lives on a small sphere,
working and sleeping.

586
00:59:14,642 --> 00:59:18,542
Sometimes they wish
they had fake friends.

587
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:24,517
I don't know what these fake people
do on this small sphere.

588
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:26,653
Possibly...

589
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,450
OK, that's enough.

590
00:59:28,842 --> 00:59:32,842
You can sit down.

591
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:37,542
Hey, over there!

592
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:41,542
Keep quiet!

593
00:59:42,842 --> 00:59:44,020
Aihara.

594
00:59:47,242 --> 00:59:51,242
That was a really good recital.

595
00:59:52,142 --> 00:59:56,236
Next, Kawanishi! The next line.

596
01:00:29,842 --> 01:00:33,842
What's up, Shinya?

597
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:40,342
Let me go to Tokyo this time round.

598
01:00:40,742 --> 01:00:41,776
You?

599
01:01:03,742 --> 01:01:07,442
I'm supposed to be
the one who goes to Tokyo!

600
01:01:07,442 --> 01:01:11,442
Don't you go around
doing these unnecessary things.

601
01:01:13,742 --> 01:01:17,742
What's with those eyes?

602
01:01:26,342 --> 01:01:30,342
Do whatever you want.

603
01:02:12,742 --> 01:02:15,933
Kamigawa Prefecture, Yokohama City,
Naka District, Yamate Block
AIHARA RYOU

604
01:02:27,032 --> 01:02:28,179
Hello?

605
01:02:28,214 --> 01:02:29,304
Thank you, Ryou.

606
01:02:30,242 --> 01:02:33,342
For the tape. I received it.

607
01:02:33,342 --> 01:02:35,442
Really?

608
01:02:35,442 --> 01:02:37,651
It already did huh.

609
01:02:39,742 --> 01:02:42,442
Ah... it's embarrassing!

610
01:02:42,442 --> 01:02:44,442
No, not at all.

611
01:02:44,442 --> 01:02:48,442
Your voice is really cute.

612
01:03:09,442 --> 01:03:10,800
Here it comes.

613
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,614
Thanks.

614
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:42,042
I'm always looking at it.

615
01:05:42,342 --> 01:05:45,742
The tape recorder.

616
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:48,342
Really?

617
01:05:48,342 --> 01:05:49,173
About that,

618
01:05:49,173 --> 01:05:51,856
It was really tough
but I finally fixed it.

619
01:05:54,142 --> 01:05:55,943
I didn't know
it was such an important thing...

620
01:05:58,842 --> 01:06:00,342
That's why,

621
01:06:00,342 --> 01:06:02,442
I gave it to you.

622
01:06:02,442 --> 01:06:05,242
The way I think of it,

623
01:06:05,242 --> 01:06:09,457
that tape recorder will probably

624
01:06:10,582 --> 01:06:12,468
always remember me.

625
01:06:17,242 --> 01:06:20,142
Actually I can...

626
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,342
read your mind.

627
01:06:23,342 --> 01:06:24,806
No way!

628
01:06:26,342 --> 01:06:28,442
Just joking!

629
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,361
Actually, I heard about it.

630
01:06:30,858 --> 01:06:32,720
from the guy at Toda Marine Service.

631
01:06:36,942 --> 01:06:40,942
Man,
that old dude didn't have to say that...

632
01:07:02,442 --> 01:07:04,359
[Train Ticket: Nagano to Tokyo]

633
01:07:09,342 --> 01:07:13,342
I'll leave it up to you then.

634
01:07:22,742 --> 01:07:25,342
Shinya-san,

635
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:28,442
you must have used magic.

636
01:07:28,442 --> 01:07:32,342
Magic?

637
01:07:32,342 --> 01:07:36,342
A spell that can fix anything.

638
01:07:36,342 --> 01:07:38,742
Hey Ryou,

639
01:07:38,742 --> 01:07:42,442
there's something I want to tell you...

640
01:07:42,442 --> 01:07:43,842
Or rather, a proposal.

641
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:46,142
What about?

642
01:07:46,142 --> 01:07:47,342
Actually,

643
01:07:47,342 --> 01:07:51,525
This weekend...
I'll be coming to Tokyo to get new supplies.

644
01:07:52,742 --> 01:07:53,903
Whaaaat?

645
01:07:57,642 --> 01:08:01,987
You're coming to Tokyo?

646
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:08,042
Yeah.

647
01:08:08,742 --> 01:08:12,742
So I was thinking
whether I could meet you this time.

648
01:08:14,342 --> 01:08:16,147
Will you see me?

649
01:08:20,742 --> 01:08:24,342
Do you hear me?

650
01:08:24,342 --> 01:08:27,542
Yup.

651
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:31,542
Will you meet me...?

652
01:08:35,842 --> 01:08:39,842
I want to meet you.

653
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:52,042
Yes. I'll meet you.

654
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:56,042
I'll meet you.

655
01:09:49,442 --> 01:09:51,088
Mum...

656
01:09:58,042 --> 01:09:59,608
You're looking cute today!

657
01:10:04,342 --> 01:10:06,042
Really?

658
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:08,642
It doesn't look weird?
Will it be all right?

659
01:10:08,642 --> 01:10:11,242
No it isn't weird.

660
01:10:11,242 --> 01:10:13,642
It really fits you.

661
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:14,642
Really?

662
01:10:14,642 --> 01:10:18,442
Yup!

663
01:10:18,442 --> 01:10:22,442
Hold on.

664
01:10:37,642 --> 01:10:41,642
If you put this on,
it'll be even better.

665
01:10:53,642 --> 01:10:56,542
As I expected!

666
01:10:56,542 --> 01:11:00,542
Take a look in the mirror.

667
01:11:09,442 --> 01:11:10,742
Ah, I'm going to be late!

668
01:11:10,742 --> 01:11:11,942
I'll be going!

669
01:11:11,942 --> 01:11:13,319
Have a safe trip!

670
01:11:14,762 --> 01:11:17,442
Was that Ryou?

671
01:11:17,442 --> 01:11:18,302
Yup.

672
01:11:18,302 --> 01:11:19,842
What's with her?

673
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:22,230
It seems she's meeting her friend.

674
01:11:23,658 --> 01:11:24,942
Ah I see!

675
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:27,012
That's nice.

676
01:11:30,442 --> 01:11:33,442
Hello? Harada-san?

677
01:11:33,442 --> 01:11:35,442
Ryou-san?

678
01:11:35,442 --> 01:11:39,442
I called you a few times
because I wanted to talk with you.

679
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:41,787
Something you wanted to tell me?

680
01:11:42,707 --> 01:11:48,142
Yes,
I decided that I'd meet Shinya-san.

681
01:11:48,942 --> 01:11:53,883
"I really want to meet him!"
that's what I'm feeling now.

682
01:11:56,442 --> 01:12:00,442
Thanks to your advice,
I gathered the courage to meet him.

683
01:12:02,342 --> 01:12:05,342
When are you meeting him?

684
01:12:05,342 --> 01:12:08,142
Today, now.

685
01:12:08,142 --> 01:12:09,842
Now?

686
01:12:09,842 --> 01:12:11,842
Where are you now?

687
01:12:11,842 --> 01:12:15,842
There seems
to be interference with the reception.

688
01:12:17,442 --> 01:12:21,442
Ryou-san, remember this:

689
01:12:23,742 --> 01:12:27,742
You can do it!

690
01:12:28,442 --> 01:12:31,134
No matter what happens.

691
01:12:33,842 --> 01:12:37,542
What do you mean?

692
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:39,493
Miss, we're about to leave!

693
01:12:40,742 --> 01:12:43,742
Since it's you, it'll be okay.

694
01:12:43,742 --> 01:12:45,942
Eh?

695
01:12:45,942 --> 01:12:48,442
Are you boarding the bus?

696
01:12:48,442 --> 01:12:52,442
Sorry!

697
01:12:55,442 --> 01:12:57,042
Harada-san?

698
01:12:57,042 --> 01:13:01,042
What did you mean?

699
01:13:02,348 --> 01:13:05,653
Ah, I got cut off...

700
01:13:58,742 --> 01:14:00,442
Hello?

701
01:14:00,442 --> 01:14:01,364
Ah, Ryou?

702
01:14:03,542 --> 01:14:07,542
I'm on the way now.

703
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:15,142
It'll be another hour...

704
01:14:15,142 --> 01:14:19,142
Ah,
but our times are different.

705
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:22,942
Don't get mixed up when you change lines.

706
01:14:22,942 --> 01:14:24,442
I won't...

707
01:14:24,442 --> 01:14:26,368
I checked online yesterday.

708
01:14:27,385 --> 01:14:29,992
As promised, I'll meet you
at 3 at the ticket entrance.

709
01:14:33,342 --> 01:14:38,983
If it's 1 hour earlier here...
somehow I'm really excited!

710
01:14:40,942 --> 01:14:44,842
But sorry, I might be late.

711
01:14:44,842 --> 01:14:46,431
There's a traffic jam.

712
01:14:48,742 --> 01:14:50,342
It's okay.

713
01:14:50,342 --> 01:14:53,742
I'll wait for you then.

714
01:14:53,742 --> 01:14:55,642
Where will you be?

715
01:14:55,642 --> 01:14:57,583
The roundabout at the western entrance.

716
01:14:59,342 --> 01:15:03,342
I got it.

717
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:13,342
I was wondering
what you would be wearing?

718
01:15:14,342 --> 01:15:16,442
It's nothing special...

719
01:15:16,442 --> 01:15:17,842
Won't you tell me?

720
01:15:17,842 --> 01:15:21,642
It's not really
I'd go to lengths to talk about...

721
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:25,642
All right.

722
01:15:26,342 --> 01:15:30,342
Shinya-san,

723
01:15:30,342 --> 01:15:34,042
Can you promise me something?

724
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:37,842
Promise?

725
01:15:37,842 --> 01:15:42,390
After we meet, even if I'm not
what you imagined me to be,

726
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:51,350
don't hate me!

727
01:15:54,242 --> 01:15:57,742
Don't be silly. I won't!

728
01:15:57,742 --> 01:15:59,642
Rather,

729
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:00,851
I should be telling you that.

730
01:16:03,442 --> 01:16:09,219
Actually...
there's something I'm keeping from you.

731
01:16:10,697 --> 01:16:16,442
But I thought I'd definitely
explain it to you after I meet you.

732
01:16:17,342 --> 01:16:21,342
Hm, what is it?

733
01:16:22,342 --> 01:16:23,342
What happened?

734
01:16:23,342 --> 01:16:27,342
Some driver
recklessly cut into the bus's lane.

735
01:16:27,442 --> 01:16:28,842
Are you okay?

736
01:16:28,842 --> 01:16:32,442
Yup.

737
01:16:32,442 --> 01:16:36,442
Ah, sorry,
as expected I'll be late.

738
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,342
Even though
I should be the one waiting for you.

739
01:16:41,642 --> 01:16:43,247
Don't worry about that.

740
01:16:43,551 --> 01:16:49,342
It'll be fun looking for you
when you get off the bus.

741
01:16:54,342 --> 01:16:58,342
Shinya-san, I've reached.

742
01:17:01,342 --> 01:17:05,342
It's now 3.05 p.m.
Sorry for being late!

743
01:17:05,742 --> 01:17:09,742
3.05 p.m., right.
Alright, I got it.

744
01:17:09,942 --> 01:17:11,319
I'll be getting off now.

745
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:14,259
By the way,

746
01:17:15,842 --> 01:17:19,237
we won't need
this phone call any longer, right?

747
01:17:20,642 --> 01:17:24,642
Since we're about to meet.

748
01:17:26,342 --> 01:17:30,342
The time and distance
between us will be closed.

749
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:34,642
Here's greetings from me,
1 hour earlier.

750
01:17:34,642 --> 01:17:38,642
I got it.

751
01:18:32,342 --> 01:18:36,342
Someone call an ambulance! Hurry!

752
01:18:38,342 --> 01:18:42,342
Are you okay?

753
01:18:43,042 --> 01:18:45,842
...What just happened?

754
01:18:45,842 --> 01:18:49,842
He pushed you away and in your place...

755
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:43,342
Shinya-san?

756
01:19:49,342 --> 01:19:53,342
Shinya-san?

757
01:19:57,442 --> 01:20:01,442
Shinya-san!

758
01:20:34,342 --> 01:20:38,342
Shinya-san!

759
01:20:41,142 --> 01:20:45,142
Shinya-san!

760
01:21:58,542 --> 01:22:02,542
Shinya-san?

761
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:53,442
There's still time.

762
01:22:53,442 --> 01:22:57,442
If I call him now,
there's still time!

763
01:23:01,442 --> 01:23:05,442
Please, pick up!

764
01:23:06,942 --> 01:23:10,942
Please pick up the phone, Shinya-san!

765
01:23:29,342 --> 01:23:31,542
Hello?

766
01:23:31,542 --> 01:23:33,542
Shinya-san?

767
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:35,112
What's up?

768
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:40,426
Don't tell me
you're calling because you're troubled?

769
01:23:40,912 --> 01:23:43,523
I'm not an imaginary person you know.

770
01:23:47,642 --> 01:23:51,642
That's it.

771
01:23:53,042 --> 01:23:56,616
I don't want to meet you.
Not someone like you.

772
01:24:01,689 --> 01:24:05,542
You should go back now.

773
01:24:05,542 --> 01:24:06,130
Please.

774
01:24:10,242 --> 01:24:12,142
Why?

775
01:24:12,142 --> 01:24:13,171
As expected, am I...?

776
01:24:16,155 --> 01:24:20,842
Sorry. Please go back.

777
01:24:21,245 --> 01:24:23,442
I don't want to meet you!

778
01:24:23,442 --> 01:24:27,442
Someone like you... I hate you!

779
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:32,642
I hate your face,

780
01:24:32,642 --> 01:24:35,442
your hair,

781
01:24:35,442 --> 01:24:39,442
your fingers,

782
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:43,742
and your voice!

783
01:24:43,742 --> 01:24:47,142
Voice?

784
01:24:47,142 --> 01:24:50,942
You're lying.

785
01:24:50,942 --> 01:24:52,942
You can't possibly hear my voice.

786
01:24:52,942 --> 01:24:55,342
I'm not lying!

787
01:24:55,342 --> 01:24:57,442
You're the worst.

788
01:24:57,442 --> 01:24:59,324
I was disillusioned.
You weren't what I expected.

789
01:24:59,616 --> 01:25:02,342
You're lying!

790
01:25:02,342 --> 01:25:06,042
Because...

791
01:25:06,042 --> 01:25:10,042
I can't speak.

792
01:25:12,872 --> 01:25:18,142
I lost my hearing and speech
when I was 5.

793
01:25:20,742 --> 01:25:21,876
That's why,

794
01:25:22,282 --> 01:25:24,875
you couldn't
possibly have heard my voice.

795
01:25:28,742 --> 01:25:31,842
That can't be...

796
01:25:31,842 --> 01:25:35,842
Why did you lie?

797
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:38,922
Because...

798
01:25:44,716 --> 01:25:46,645
Because...

799
01:25:55,742 --> 01:25:57,342
Ryou?

800
01:25:57,342 --> 01:25:58,842
What happened?

801
01:25:58,842 --> 01:26:01,742
Why do you want me to go back?

802
01:26:01,742 --> 01:26:05,742
Please!

803
01:26:05,942 --> 01:26:08,742
I don't know
what happened after I met you.

804
01:26:08,742 --> 01:26:11,742
But I will definitely meet you.

805
01:26:11,742 --> 01:26:14,442
Why don't you understand?

806
01:26:14,442 --> 01:26:16,042
If you come...

807
01:26:16,042 --> 01:26:20,042
You'll die!

808
01:26:21,842 --> 01:26:24,842
Die?

809
01:26:24,842 --> 01:26:27,342
What do you mean?

810
01:26:27,342 --> 01:26:30,042
You'll die after you meet me.

811
01:26:30,042 --> 01:26:32,242
You'll die saving me.

812
01:26:32,242 --> 01:26:34,984
Please go back!

813
01:26:35,645 --> 01:26:37,542
I can't.

814
01:26:37,542 --> 01:26:39,842
If what you're saying is true,

815
01:26:39,842 --> 01:26:41,410
I have to go!

816
01:26:42,137 --> 01:26:46,342
I'll definitely be saved... so...

817
01:26:46,342 --> 01:26:48,942
I'll go!

818
01:26:48,942 --> 01:26:50,542
Don't...

819
01:26:50,542 --> 01:26:52,542
Don't come!

820
01:26:52,542 --> 01:26:53,883
Don't cry, Ryou.

821
01:26:55,154 --> 01:26:56,196
I'll be fine.

822
01:26:56,816 --> 01:26:57,922
I won't die.

823
01:26:59,651 --> 01:27:05,042
Do you rememer the time
you went to Kamakura?

824
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:07,442
You were humming a song for me.

825
01:27:07,442 --> 01:27:11,442
It's been 15 years
since I last heard music.

826
01:27:12,339 --> 01:27:17,442
You reminded me what it was like
to be able to hear music.

827
01:27:17,442 --> 01:27:20,040
I was surprised
the first time you called me,

828
01:27:21,213 --> 01:27:24,042
that someone wanted to talk to me.

829
01:27:24,042 --> 01:27:29,309
When I heard your voice,
I was really excited

830
01:27:29,542 --> 01:27:32,442
to be able
to finally tell someone my feelings.

831
01:27:32,442 --> 01:27:35,842
And that someone was willing to listen.

832
01:27:35,842 --> 01:27:39,842
It was such a wonderful thing.

833
01:27:40,342 --> 01:27:43,242
That's why,

834
01:27:43,242 --> 01:27:46,342
you should never
say something like that again!

835
01:27:46,342 --> 01:27:50,342
That it would be fine
even if you disappeared.

836
01:28:02,542 --> 01:28:04,342
I understand.

837
01:28:04,342 --> 01:28:06,342
I won't say that again!

838
01:28:06,342 --> 01:28:10,142
So stop! Please...

839
01:28:10,142 --> 01:28:11,742
That's great...

840
01:28:11,742 --> 01:28:13,342
But I'm still going...

841
01:28:13,342 --> 01:28:15,342
I'll definitely save you.

842
01:28:15,342 --> 01:28:19,142
I'll still make the same choice.

843
01:28:19,142 --> 01:28:23,142
Just like what I did an hour earlier.

844
01:28:26,942 --> 01:28:30,942
Where are you, Ryou?

845
01:28:43,342 --> 01:28:48,104
A blue dress.

846
01:28:48,699 --> 01:28:51,417
I'm wearing a blue dress today.

847
01:28:51,983 --> 01:28:55,244
I got it.

848
01:29:44,742 --> 01:29:49,542
A red and round watch...
I've been using it since I was young.

849
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:12,542
Shinya-san...

850
01:30:21,142 --> 01:30:22,742
Please!

851
01:30:22,742 --> 01:30:26,742
Please say something!

852
01:30:46,542 --> 01:30:49,342
Ryou...

853
01:30:49,342 --> 01:30:51,742
Shinya-san?

854
01:30:51,742 --> 01:30:53,742
Hello? Hello?

855
01:30:53,742 --> 01:30:56,642
Thank goodness...

856
01:30:56,642 --> 01:30:59,242
Can you still hear me?

857
01:30:59,242 --> 01:31:02,742
Shinya-san!

858
01:31:02,742 --> 01:31:06,742
I can see you standing up.

859
01:31:09,842 --> 01:31:14,558
You look okay, but are you?

860
01:31:16,342 --> 01:31:17,836
Yes, I'm fine.

861
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:25,342
Thank goodness.

862
01:31:26,442 --> 01:31:31,897
Ryou, so that's what you look like.

863
01:31:32,642 --> 01:31:36,642
You're really cute.

864
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:42,542
You should have
more confidence in yourself.

865
01:31:46,942 --> 01:31:50,442
Shinya-san?

866
01:31:50,442 --> 01:31:54,442
You're calling my name.

867
01:31:55,561 --> 01:31:59,704
I can hear you.

868
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:03,695
It's definitely a nice voice.

869
01:32:04,374 --> 01:32:06,342
Shinya-san?

870
01:32:06,342 --> 01:32:11,502
Why did you go to this length
to save me?

871
01:32:12,742 --> 01:32:15,342
What are you talking about?

872
01:32:15,342 --> 01:32:17,042
The one who's being saved,

873
01:32:17,042 --> 01:32:18,236
is me.

874
01:32:21,742 --> 01:32:25,742
Thank you, Ryou.

875
01:32:28,842 --> 01:32:32,842
Shinya-san...

876
01:32:39,342 --> 01:32:44,549
Because I met you...

877
01:32:45,942 --> 01:32:50,346
We no longer...

878
01:34:30,742 --> 01:34:34,142
Harada-san.

879
01:34:34,142 --> 01:34:37,242
After Shinya-san passed away,

880
01:34:37,242 --> 01:34:38,828
I came to Nagano.

881
01:34:42,142 --> 01:34:46,142
I see.

882
01:34:46,542 --> 01:34:50,542
Somehow it feels like,

883
01:34:51,909 --> 01:34:56,642
I can still hear
Shinya-san's kind voice.

884
01:34:57,942 --> 01:35:03,691
I wonder if I can become a strong adult
just like you, Harada-san.

885
01:35:07,342 --> 01:35:09,742
Harada-san,

886
01:35:09,742 --> 01:35:13,742
I wonder if I'll be able to.

887
01:35:16,342 --> 01:35:19,342
Don't say that.

888
01:35:19,342 --> 01:35:23,342
You will become one.

889
01:35:26,542 --> 01:35:30,542
You will.

890
01:35:30,542 --> 01:35:34,542
You'll change.

891
01:35:36,228 --> 01:35:41,342
Hello? Harada-san?

892
01:36:00,742 --> 01:36:04,742
God brought him back to Heaven...

893
01:36:04,942 --> 01:36:08,942
But the order is wrong, isn't it?

894
01:36:09,927 --> 01:36:16,042
He left before me.

895
01:36:22,142 --> 01:36:25,442
It's just
a lot of odds and ends, isn't it?

896
01:36:25,442 --> 01:36:29,055
But,
all of them can be used.

897
01:36:31,342 --> 01:36:33,442
Is this all of it?

898
01:36:33,442 --> 01:36:35,042
Yes.

899
01:36:35,042 --> 01:36:39,042
To others it may just be rubbish,

900
01:36:39,042 --> 01:36:43,042
but to him, it was different.

901
01:36:46,342 --> 01:36:53,142
No matter what it was,
he would breathe life into it.

902
01:36:59,542 --> 01:37:02,442
It was definitely magic.

903
01:37:02,442 --> 01:37:03,806
Magic?

904
01:37:06,742 --> 01:37:10,742
A magical spell that can fix anything.

905
01:37:11,342 --> 01:37:17,185
It's magic, isn't it?

906
01:37:19,742 --> 01:37:27,141
That's why when he was here,
somehow I always felt better.

907
01:37:32,442 --> 01:37:35,042
But Ryou-san,

908
01:37:35,042 --> 01:37:39,042
You may have some magic of your own.

909
01:37:39,842 --> 01:37:43,842
Huh?

910
01:37:55,942 --> 01:37:59,942
He listened to this tape countless times.

911
01:38:01,342 --> 01:38:05,342
But...
Shinya-san couldn't hear, could he?

912
01:38:05,942 --> 01:38:07,942
He couldn't hear, but

913
01:38:07,942 --> 01:38:11,942
he kept on listening to it.

914
01:38:21,842 --> 01:38:25,842
Actually

915
01:38:33,642 --> 01:38:38,244
"Could you listen to this tape for me?"
he was asking me really earnestly.

916
01:38:39,342 --> 01:38:43,342
"What did she say?
What's her voice like? Please tell me!"

917
01:38:45,842 --> 01:38:49,842
Then, you heard the tape too...?

918
01:38:51,642 --> 01:38:55,242
Yes.

919
01:38:55,242 --> 01:38:57,651
I said it was a really cute voice.

920
01:38:58,051 --> 01:39:02,142
He seemed really happy.

921
01:39:02,142 --> 01:39:04,342
Especially

922
01:39:04,342 --> 01:39:08,342
the last part.

923
01:39:09,342 --> 01:39:10,733
The last part?

924
01:39:11,842 --> 01:39:15,842
She says she wants to meet you.

925
01:39:21,142 --> 01:39:25,142
"I want to meet you"

926
01:39:25,181 --> 01:39:30,342
Again and again...

927
01:39:35,342 --> 01:39:38,542
Such a happy smile of his...

928
01:39:38,542 --> 01:39:42,542
it was really long
since I last saw it,

929
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:48,342
since he lost his parents
and his brother in an accident.

930
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:58,842
It must have been due to your magic.

931
01:40:05,342 --> 01:40:09,342
Even though
it must have been tough on him,

932
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:13,555
he would sign like this.

933
01:40:28,742 --> 01:40:30,927
What does that mean?

934
01:40:32,251 --> 01:40:36,842
Please tell me.

935
01:40:36,842 --> 01:40:39,942
You

936
01:40:39,942 --> 01:40:43,942
aren't alone.

937
01:40:51,962 --> 01:40:53,959
You... aren't... alone.

938
01:42:43,542 --> 01:42:47,542
Shinya-san!

939
01:42:47,542 --> 01:42:50,042
Can you hear

940
01:42:50,042 --> 01:42:54,042
my voice?

941
01:42:54,742 --> 01:42:57,342
Shinya-san!

942
01:42:57,342 --> 01:43:01,342
It's going to be autumn soon!

943
01:43:02,342 --> 01:43:06,342
I'll definitely live on strongly!

944
01:43:09,142 --> 01:43:11,842
Because...

945
01:43:11,842 --> 01:43:15,842
I'm no longer...

946
01:43:19,771 --> 01:43:21,134
alone.

947
01:43:26,542 --> 01:43:30,542
Can you hear me?

948
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:43,948
You're the only one

949
01:43:44,235 --> 01:43:47,292
who can hear this voice.

950
01:43:47,641 --> 01:43:51,739
Even now I can still hear

951
01:43:52,207 --> 01:43:55,049
this voice.

952
01:43:55,049 --> 01:43:58,996
I continue calling,
so it'll get through,

953
01:43:59,346 --> 01:44:05,633
your name over and over again.

954
01:44:05,942 --> 01:44:09,942
I'm calling you,

955
01:44:11,742 --> 01:44:17,660
Calling your name.

956
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:28,717
Only you can hear this voice.

957
01:44:29,208 --> 01:44:33,404
Every time
I call your name, it's as if

958
01:44:33,404 --> 01:44:35,973
you were right by my side.

959
01:44:35,973 --> 01:44:42,374
And my chest becomes warm.

960
01:44:43,042 --> 01:44:47,042
I'm calling you,

961
01:44:48,978 --> 01:44:54,479
Calling your name.

962
01:44:54,671 --> 01:44:57,718
At that time,

963
01:44:57,718 --> 01:45:05,572
If this voice hadn't reached you

964
01:45:05,952 --> 01:45:08,999
I'd have given up,

965
01:45:09,223 --> 01:45:10,462
without knowing

966
01:45:10,462 --> 01:45:12,862
thinking about someone

967
01:45:13,104 --> 01:45:19,411
would be something
I'd treasure so much.

968
01:45:19,542 --> 01:45:24,673
I'm calling you,

969
01:45:25,542 --> 01:45:31,360
Caling your name.

970
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:34,834
A heart can really be

971
01:45:34,834 --> 01:45:37,720
touched,

972
01:45:38,386 --> 01:45:43,320
"my beloved" and "pain"
are a little similar,

973
01:45:43,635 --> 01:45:49,610
You gave me your voice and tears,

974
01:45:50,048 --> 01:45:58,508
you told me about everyone.

975
01:45:59,115 --> 01:46:02,485
You're the only one

976
01:46:02,485 --> 01:46:10,172
who can hear this voice.

977
01:46:10,378 --> 01:46:13,505
If it reaches someone, please look,

978
01:46:13,505 --> 01:46:18,785
so it may join us,

979
01:46:19,228 --> 01:46:24,952
I'll try and call out with you.

980
01:46:25,442 --> 01:46:31,078
I'm still calling out even now.

981
01:46:31,442 --> 01:46:38,093
I'm still continuing to call for you.

982
01:46:41,486 --> 01:46:47,537
Your voice is being sent to someone,

983
01:46:47,537 --> 01:46:53,761
Someone is replying to your voice,

984
01:46:53,761 --> 01:46:59,492
Someone is remembering you.

985
01:46:59,786 --> 01:47:05,276
Someone is replying to your voice,

986
01:47:06,075 --> 01:47:11,398
Someone is remembering you,

987
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:18,163
replying to your voice.

988
01:47:18,742 --> 01:47:22,742
subtitled by?

990
01:47:26,542 --> 01:47:28,742
I'm Calling You

991
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:32,742
(Only you can hear me)

992
01:47:33,042 --> 01:47:37,042
Thank you for watching (and reading)
