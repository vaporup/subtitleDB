173
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:21,955
- I've...
- Read the card.

174
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:30,495
"The person who handed you this card
is under the care of a prescription puppet

175
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:33,967
"designed to help create
a psychological distance between himself

176
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,267
"and the negative aspects
of his personality.

177
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:39,106
"Please treat him as you normally would

178
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:41,642
"but address yourself to the puppet.
Thank you."

179
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,699
There you go.

180
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:46,477
- Is this some kind of a joke?
- No, hardly, love. Nothing funny about it.

00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:48,282
Stop it with the puppet!

182
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,480
All right. I'm confused, Walter,
and I need some answers right now.

183
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:01,554
He said if I stick with it that maybe...

184
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:03,525
He? Who said that?

185
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,722
Dr. Macy.

186
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,929
Dr. Macy? You quit seeing him.

187
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:11,599
Well, I went back.

188
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:18,004
So this is some kind of a program?

189
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:22,947
I'll field that one. Yes, Meredith.
The answer is yes.

190
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,116
That is exactly what it is.

191
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:26,380
I know it seems radical,

192
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:30,252
but in cases like Walter's,
cases where all else has been known to fail,

193
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,323
it's proven quite effective.

194
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:37,063
But if it's going to work,
it's going to need your full support.

to write you a paper?

222
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,326
It's not a paper.

223
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,966

you write other people's papers for them,

good at making yourself sound like them.

That's what I need.

- No way.
- Why?

230
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:22,761
Because it's one thing for your little

That's all they've got.

That is 428 pages of lazy.

how to actually make anything.

Yeah? Who taught him?

267

He was about your age, yeah. Cub Scouts.

to make a racecar for a contest.

Except, his pop weren't around
so he had to do it himself.

Where was his dad?

272

You mean Grandpa Jerry
from the graveyard?

274
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:52,946
Right-o. Anyway, Walter had Grandpa's
tools but no clue how to use them.

275
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:56,512
So, what he ended up making was so awful

Walter Black ascended
to CEO of this company two years ago.

324
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:03,084
Not through any particular skill or merit,

00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:05,679
Now, I know there's a very high degree
of skepticism about my ability to lead.

342
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,319
Isn't that right?

343
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,758
I mean, middle-aged man
with his arm stuck up my bum. Right?

344
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:15,159
Who wouldn't doubt me?
But I'll make you the following deal.

345
00:27:15,232 --> 00:27:19,862
You give me two weeks, just two,
and at the end of that time,

346
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:23,168
anyone who wants to resign
will receive severance pay

347
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,470
and a glowing letter of recommendation.

348
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,706
- No questions asked, no exceptions.
- MAN: Excuse me?

349
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:30,279
And who exactly are you supposed to be?

350
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:33,949
Bollocks. Did I forget to introduce meself?

351
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:37,419
You may simply call me the Beaver.

352
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:46,287
Impressive.

353
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:49,521
So, what do you need to know?

354
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:54,931
Well, I guess the first thing is,
what do you want to say?

355
00:27:57,908 --> 00:27:59,773
Well, that's kind of the problem.

356
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,307
I mean, I got good grades. Big deal.
What do I know?

357
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,146
Okay. Well, how do you want people to feel
when you're done?

358
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:13,014
I guess I just want them to feel not

359
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:15,285
let down.

360
00:28:15,425 --> 00:28:16,414
"Not let down."

361
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:18,223
That's powerful.

362
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:21,990
"I'm excited, pumped. How are you doing?"

363
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:24,090
"Me? I'm not let down."

364
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,293
(LAUGHS)

365
00:28:25,368 --> 00:28:28,166
I told you that I suck.
This is why I need you.

366
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:31,764
Okay, well, you're a cheerleader,
notorious hothead.

367
00:28:31,841 --> 00:28:33,866
Could we talk about you getting expelled
from the eighth grade?

368
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:37,211
How did you find out about that?

369
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:40,074
No secrets on the Internet.

370
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:41,606
What did you do?

371
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:42,912
Did you steal some encyclopedias?

372
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:45,011
- Chew some nicotine gum?
- No.

373
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:46,988
What? Tease a fat kid?

374
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:48,512
Shut up.

375
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:50,083
All right. So, what is it?

376
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:54,026
I was tagging.

377
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:57,961
Tagging?

378
00:28:59,602 --> 00:29:00,796
Like...

379
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:05,496
Like graffiti tagging?

380
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:10,068
More like art. It was just illegal.

381
00:29:12,014 --> 00:29:15,472
Where's all this rebel-artist shit now?

382
00:29:16,018 --> 00:29:18,009
That was a long time ago.

383
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:22,345
You still have some, don't you? Yeah.

384
00:29:22,557 --> 00:29:24,650
- Show me, please.
- No.

385
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:28,755
If you show me, I will write you a speech
that you could free Tibet with.

386
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:30,189
Why do you want to see it so bad?

387
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:33,161
Because I like to be surprised.

388
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:40,305
- We have to be quick.
- All right.

389
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,939
Whose room is this?

390
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:45,543
NORAH: No one's.

391
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,084
Oh, wow.

392
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:11,798
I like to do it big.
Like freeways, buildings, billboards.

393
00:30:13,107 --> 00:30:18,238
And fast.
Like I'm running a million miles an hour.

394
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:21,605
No thinking, you know?

395
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:25,313
Why did you stop?

396
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,548
'Cause I got caught
and my mom couldn't take it.

397
00:30:33,427 --> 00:30:36,396
Anyway, I threw them all away.

398
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:37,453
Someone must have liked them.

399
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:41,766
Pulled them out of the trash, didn't they?

400
00:30:43,003 --> 00:30:45,130
- Who was it?
- NORAH'S MOM: What are you doing in here?

401
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:50,209
I was just showing Porter around the house.

402
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:54,309
He's on the math team with me.

403
00:30:54,782 --> 00:30:56,511
- Right.
- Time to go.

404
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:02,485
Hey, I'm sorry about my mom.

405
00:31:03,624 --> 00:31:05,819
- She's just, you know...
- That's fine.

406
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,193
You know, you are

407
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:15,733
so much weirder...

408
00:31:19,205 --> 00:31:22,732
Not weird, I just mean, like,
different, I guess.

409
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:26,744
You're a lot more different
than I thought you'd be.

410
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,976
You know, for someone I'm paying
a lot of money to write a speech for me,

411
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:31,539
you're not very articulate.

412
00:31:32,652 --> 00:31:33,778
I'm much better on paper.

413
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:36,252
We'll see.

414
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,258
Thank you for not laughing, I guess.

415
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:42,717
I wouldn't do that.

416
00:31:42,996 --> 00:31:44,623
I wouldn't laugh.

417
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:46,590
Good.

418
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:50,660
Very, very good.

- Walter. Walter, wake up. Wake up.
- Mmm. What?

439
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:37,900
It's Henry. He snuck out of his room.
He's down in the garage again by himself.

440
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,205
Well, tell him to come to bed.

441
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:45,113
I know. I tell him every night, but he needs
to hear it from, you know, you.

442
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,072
Yeah.

443
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:50,484
I'm on it.

444
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:57,489
Whoa, where are you going
this time of night?

445
00:33:57,561 --> 00:33:59,756
I'm gonna tell the little guy
to knock it off so I can sleep.

446
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,819
Right.

447
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:04,299
I was going to the same place.
Come on. Let's triple-team him.

448
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:08,432
That's okay.
You've got your little furry friend.

449
00:34:11,574 --> 00:34:12,563
Good night.

450
00:34:21,952 --> 00:34:23,749
What are you making besides a racket?

451
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,809
You couldn't sleep, either?

452
00:34:25,722 --> 00:34:28,953
Well, actually, mate,
I was having a brilliant kip

453
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,220
till you started banging away.

454
00:34:32,062 --> 00:34:33,927
I just had this idea.

455
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:36,465
Oh, yeah?
Well, let's have the idea in the morning.

456
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:39,592
Just 10 more minutes, please?

457
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:41,296
Ten more minutes, all right, yes.

458
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:45,808
But no more mucking about with tools
when I'm not around. It's not safe.

459
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:48,638
Or when your mother's asked you not to.
Or at night.

460
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:52,580
Or in a toilet.
Or when you're climbing Mount Everest.

461
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,641
Or picking your nose. Agreed?

462
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:57,116
- Agreed.
- There you go.

463
00:34:59,856 --> 00:35:03,019
Can you talk to me? I like it when you talk.

464
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,518
What do you want me to talk about?

465
00:35:05,595 --> 00:35:07,062
Doesn't matter. Just talk.

466
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:10,530
You have a funny voice.

467
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:13,831
You're quite easily entertained, aren't you?

468
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:21,967
Give you a buzz saw, a block of wood,
and some chatter...

471
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:35,790
Yes, and everything's fine.
He'll stick to the schedule.

472
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:37,184
What's going on?

473
00:35:37,326 --> 00:35:40,955
I've had a breakthrough, love.
Got to get to work right away.

474
00:35:41,063 --> 00:35:42,052
Now?

475
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:43,689
Not a moment to spare!

476
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:48,697
You're a goddess.

477
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:03,383
Sir? You're in early.

478
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,750
Just the woman I wanted to see.

479
00:36:06,822 --> 00:36:07,811
Have a look at this.

480
00:36:08,924 --> 00:36:11,721
Now, we need to get started on this
right away.

481
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,693
It's a beaver?

482
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:15,786
It's the future.

483
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:17,253
This?

484
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:19,693
WALTER: The Talking Beaver
Woodworking Set.

485
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:22,866
You get your basic tools, a block of wood

486
00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:25,497
and a talking beaver
to work right alongside of you.

487
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:27,270
You should see the kids, love.

488
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:29,400
I mean, they've got their cell phones
and their computers,

489
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:32,037
but, wow, you give them a block of wood,
a hammer and a saw?

490
00:36:32,113 --> 00:36:33,444
Bob's their bleeding auntie.

491
00:36:33,514 --> 00:36:36,039
Their poor little brains are starving
for something like this.

492
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:39,518
So, you're talking about a new product line
for what? Christmas?

493
00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:42,556
Christmas? I'm talking about right now,
woman. Today.

494
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:44,758
This morning.

495
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,420
I guess there could be an ancillary market
in more tools.

496
00:36:49,297 --> 00:36:51,197
Maybe pre-cut lumber pieces?

497
00:36:51,265 --> 00:36:53,290
Sort of like Lego kits but made of wood.

498
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:55,995
And you can work them
into shapes on your own.

499
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,465
Now, that's using your scone.

500
00:36:58,806 --> 00:37:00,774
Not just made out of wood, is it? Let's go.

501
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,373
But this would mean, I mean,

502
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:06,277
even if we could get one ready in time,
this is all we would have for the Expo.

503
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:08,242
That's all we'll need, my darling.

The Beaver, as a core item,
along with endless project kits

511
00:37:43,383 --> 00:37:45,248
could produce an exponential return.

512
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:50,054
<i>The question is, do we want
to continue struggling merely to survive,</i>

513
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:55,026
or do we want to embrace something new,
something different,

514
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:57,187
<i>and see where it takes us?</i>

515
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,728
<i>WALTER: (AS BEAVER) Once again,
our beloved Jerry Co.</i>

516
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:08,001
has vision, power, energy, balls.

517
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:14,270
Item number three this morning,
we've got some fabrication concerns.

518
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,879
Why are you all laughing?

519
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,938
(PANTING)

520
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:59,056
Did you talk to Dr. Macy today?

521
00:39:00,726 --> 00:39:05,390
Indeed. He says we're coming along
just brilliantly.

522
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:12,328
Well, did he give you some kind of a
timeline for when the treatment might be over?

523
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,902
No, nothing specific, love.

524
00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:17,100
Like a week, or a month, or...

525
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:19,404
It's a process, love.

526
00:39:20,144 --> 00:39:22,203
We'll know when the time is right.

527
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:27,918
Now, rest up, you delicious little tart.

528
00:39:27,986 --> 00:39:30,420
There's more where that came from.

529
00:40:04,522 --> 00:40:08,288
Hector, what do I always say, man?
Read it before you turn it in.

530
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:09,951
It was about your own family,
for Christ's sake.

531
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:12,928
I just figured since it was personal,
there wouldn't be no test questions on it.

532
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:16,159
- But your own grandma turned you in.
- Yes. She was so proud.

533
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:20,192
Talking about the stuff that you had wrote
about her back in the day in D.R.

534
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,898
And then all of a sudden,
she could just tell I knew nothing about it.

535
00:40:22,973 --> 00:40:25,134
So, she starts crying.
She calls the principal, says she doesn't...

536
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,233
All right. My name stays out of this.
You understand that, right?

537
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:31,042
- She called me a liar and a cheater.
- All right, all right, all right. Look.

538
00:40:33,884 --> 00:40:35,545
Okay, I'm gonna make
a dummy website, all right?

539
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:37,746
You tell them you sent in your money,
you got your paper.

540
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:39,846
That's all you know, okay?

541
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,017
Hector, look, I gotta go.

542
00:40:43,093 --> 00:40:44,560
I'm gonna give you the website tomorrow,
all right?

543
00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:47,289
- Hector!
- Yes, yes, yes.

544
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:48,695
Great. Good.

545
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,424
Norah!

546
00:40:51,134 --> 00:40:52,192
- Hey.
- Hey.

547
00:40:53,837 --> 00:40:56,567
- Why are you all sweaty?
- I was doing yoga.

548
00:40:57,307 --> 00:40:59,969
- Manly.
- Downward Dog's a bitch.

549
00:41:02,112 --> 00:41:04,876
- Are you busy tonight?
- Are you asking me out?

550
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:06,204
No. Not at all.

551
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:09,514
I was just gonna casually inquire
if you're busy

552
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:12,782
without making it seem like I'd been
up all night planning something elaborate.

553
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:15,619
Have you been up all night
planning something elaborate?

554
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:18,051
Yeah, I have, like, maps and stuff.

555
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:19,116
(LAUGHS)

556
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:23,594
You can pick me up at 7:00.
I have to be back at 12:00.

557
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,400
Awesome, so it's a date.
I mean, it is, right?

558
00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:30,669
We'll see.

559
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:34,832
Cool.

560
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:39,008
Don't mess this up.

561
00:42:06,675 --> 00:42:08,734
You let me lead, all right?

562
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:12,102
Are you almost ready? Reservation's at 8:00.

563
00:42:13,381 --> 00:42:18,216
- Bloody hell, woman. Look at you.
- Well, you're looking pretty good yourself.

564
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,516
- Yeah, well, you ain't seen nothing yet.
- Yeah?

565
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:23,113
The girls whipped up
something special for me.

566
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,425
We're talking full-on tux, love.

567
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:33,099
Yeah. Just give us a minute to pop it on,
and we'll be off.

568
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:35,193
Wait, it's our anniversary, honey.

569
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:36,862
That's why I went for the penguin suit.

570
00:42:36,938 --> 00:42:39,771
I do not want to celebrate
20 years of marriage with a puppet.

571
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:45,902
I'm sorry. I've been very patient
and I've been very supportive,

572
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:49,676
but I want you, not him.

573
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,420
Not tonight.

574
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:05,089
Hi.

575
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:08,030
Black, party of two.

576
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:23,682
So, when do I get
to see some of your pages?

577
00:43:24,718 --> 00:43:26,242
Never. It's a pyramid scheme.

578
00:43:27,554 --> 00:43:28,612
- I didn't tell you that?
- No.

579
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,021
You didn't get the brochure?

580
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:33,889
- I'm kidding. I'll get it done.
- You better.

581
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:38,193
I'm not giving you 500 bucks just so you can
buy a flat screen for your dorm room.

582
00:43:38,265 --> 00:43:40,995
I'm not buying a flat screen
for my dorm room.

583
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:42,092
Then, what?

584
00:43:43,136 --> 00:43:44,831
- A mummy.
- No mummy.

585
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:48,974
- Then, what? What's it going to?
- Nothing.

586
00:43:49,743 --> 00:43:51,074
Mmm-mmm.

587
00:43:51,144 --> 00:43:54,204
A guy like you
doesn't do anything for no reason.

588
00:43:54,281 --> 00:43:55,942
You've got a plan.

589
00:44:03,023 --> 00:44:07,926
I was listening to the radio and, apparently,
it's gonna be really hot this weekend.

590
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:13,161
Not hot-hot, just above average.

591
00:44:17,303 --> 00:44:20,534
- So, how's work?
- Good. Yeah, busy.

592
00:44:22,008 --> 00:44:23,032
Busy?

593
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:29,714
NORAH: Maps? That's what
you're saving all your money for?

594
00:44:30,249 --> 00:44:31,307
Yeah.

595
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:34,547
Okay, explain, because right now, it's
looking like where you hide your bodies.

596
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,681
- It is. Every red dot is a dead body.
- (LAUGHING)

597
00:44:39,058 --> 00:44:40,082
Just trying to be honest.

598
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:42,320
Okay, really, what's it for?

599
00:44:44,864 --> 00:44:49,301
It's, like, all these places where
everything changed in the blink of an eye.

600
00:44:50,102 --> 00:44:52,468
Like the balcony
where Martin Luther King got shot.

601
00:44:52,538 --> 00:44:55,598
The train tracks where Woody Guthrie
hopped on his first train.

602
00:44:56,142 --> 00:44:57,131
And?

603
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:04,778
And I just visit them and then I end up
at Brown the day before school starts.

604
00:45:05,651 --> 00:45:08,119
It's kind of like a find-yourself trip?

605
00:45:08,621 --> 00:45:12,989
No. More like a lose-stuff trip.

606
00:45:14,593 --> 00:45:17,289
What kind of stuff do you want to lose?

607
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:20,528
At last count, 49 things.

608
00:45:24,536 --> 00:45:28,768
An elaborate, mysterious plan,
and a little weird.

609
00:45:31,242 --> 00:45:32,231
But I like it.

610
00:45:33,011 --> 00:45:35,741
It's your paper-writing dollars at work.

611
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:45,446
What was that for?

612
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,824
You said you liked to be surprised.

613
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:52,521
- Ready?
- For what?

614
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:08,239
It's a great place.

615
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,840
It's kind of scary but beautiful.

616
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:18,220
Look, I wasn't sure which color you liked,
so I kind of got everything.

617
00:46:18,288 --> 00:46:20,381
I hope you like sunburst yellow.

618
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:23,818
Porter? Porter, come on.
What are you doing?

619
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:25,822
Is this fantastic, or what?

620
00:46:25,896 --> 00:46:28,626
Are you kidding?
It's awesome, but I'm not going to touch it.

621
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:31,101
- Why not?
- Because.

622
00:46:32,903 --> 00:46:36,361
- Because, what? Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

623
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:40,533
Come on, Norah.
You have this amazing thing that you do.

624
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:45,541
You just put all of yourself out there.
All I can do is sound like other people.

625
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,281
- I know you have something to say.
- Okay.

626
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:52,020
- Knock yourself out. You do it.
- Come on.

627
00:46:53,223 --> 00:46:54,918
No. I don't paint.

628
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:58,561
Why not?
You're so good at being other people.

629
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:02,656
- Well, maybe if I could paint I would, but...
- Porter, just start.

630
00:47:04,134 --> 00:47:05,226
Okay.

631
00:47:09,173 --> 00:47:11,641
What are you going to do?
Write "Norah + Porter forever"?

632
00:47:13,543 --> 00:47:15,568
Because that'd be pretty cute.

633
00:47:45,942 --> 00:47:47,136
Right?

634
00:47:51,547 --> 00:47:54,482
- That's what you've been wanting to say.
- No.

635
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,678
You wrote 400 pages of notes.
Not one word about him?

636
00:47:57,754 --> 00:48:00,154
What happened to my brother
is none of your business.

637
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:01,280
Do you understand?

638
00:48:01,357 --> 00:48:03,188
I just thought there was something
you wanted to say

639
00:48:03,259 --> 00:48:05,227
and you didn't know how.

640
00:48:06,195 --> 00:48:07,492
It's none of your business.

641
00:48:08,464 --> 00:48:10,557
What kind of person
does something like this?

642
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:12,862
What's the matter with you?

643
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:18,466
(SIREN WAILS)

644
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,049
Go on. Open it.

645
00:48:31,486 --> 00:48:34,421
Henry helped me, which basically means

646
00:48:34,523 --> 00:48:37,720
that I bought the wood
and he did all the work.

647
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:45,327
It's a memory box.

648
00:48:46,535 --> 00:48:48,230
It's very nice. Thank you.

649
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,269
Look inside.

650
00:48:55,777 --> 00:48:59,304
I thought it was important
to remind ourselves of how things were.

651
00:48:59,447 --> 00:49:02,109
How things should be.

652
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,352
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

653
00:49:13,694 --> 00:49:16,959
Walter. No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

654
00:49:17,631 --> 00:49:19,462
(PANTING)

655
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:22,393
Is this what you want?

656
00:49:23,237 --> 00:49:25,569
Is this progress? Christ, woman!

657
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,470
He's suffering from depression,
not amnesia!

658
00:49:29,543 --> 00:49:31,602
You think the problem
is he can't remember these things?

659
00:49:32,112 --> 00:49:34,910
- No.
- He can't go back. Don't you see that?

660
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:40,116
This is all in the past, and dredging
it up... Do you know where this leads?

661
00:49:40,788 --> 00:49:43,120
You know where this Walter goes?

662
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:47,752
To a 10th floor balcony,
tied to a shower curtain rod.

663
00:49:47,828 --> 00:49:49,728
Is that what you want?

664
00:49:50,664 --> 00:49:53,792
You want the rest of your life
to be just like tonight?

665
00:49:53,868 --> 00:49:57,463
- Well, that was Walter.
- No, Walter. No, come on.

666
00:49:59,173 --> 00:50:01,801
Look at this. You really look at this.

667
00:50:03,711 --> 00:50:05,269
That's you, Walter.

668
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,970
Remember that?

669
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:13,908
When Porter was born, and he was so little?

670
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,149
And they pulled him out of me,
and you stood right by him.

671
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,282
You looked him right in the eye,

672
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,054
and you let him know
that you weren't going anywhere,

673
00:50:21,127 --> 00:50:23,994
that you were staying right there
so he wouldn't be scared.

674
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:28,534
Walter, that's you. That's the man I love.
That's the man I need.

675
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:32,170

01:22:49,241 --> 01:22:51,607
I didn't think I would, either.

1018
01:22:59,418 --> 01:23:01,283
I'm just glad you're still here.

1019
01:23:03,155 --> 01:23:05,020
Yeah, most of me, anyway.

1020
01:23:05,624 --> 01:23:07,148
Yeah.

1021
01:23:12,298 --> 01:23:14,266
You know, when I was a little kid,

1022
01:23:14,767 --> 01:23:18,168
man, all I ever wanted was to be like you.

1023
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,706
Then I got older,

1024
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:28,140
and I just wanted to be anybody else.

1025
01:23:34,886 --> 01:23:35,875
And now?

1026
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,452
Dad.

1027
01:24:41,151 --> 01:24:43,585
<i>WALTER: (AS WALTER)
This is a picture of Walter Black,</i>

1028
01:24:45,322 --> 01:24:47,950
<i>who had to become a beaver,</i>

1029
01:24:48,025 --> 01:24:50,493
<i>who had to become a father,</i>

1030
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:57,290
<i>so that, one day, this might
just be a picture of Walter Black.</i>
