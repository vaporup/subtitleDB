I'm looking for the M8.

29
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:59,870
Eh...

30
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:03,673
Aye, you've gotta go straight
along that way and...

31
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:06,677
This is gonna be pure
hard to explain.

32
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:09,146
- Do you know where the Asda is?
- No.

33
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:12,316
Yeah, I don't even know what
way you're pointin'. What?

34
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,423
See, if you just drive
straight along up there...

35
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:17,621
- Yes?
- And see the traffic lights up there?

36
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,991
Take a right. Then you'll go
past Ibrox Stadium, right?

37
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:22,860
And go straight
through a roundabout.

38
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:27,598
Then take a left. So
it's right, then just...

39
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,801
And it's there. The motorway is there.
It's back of Asda. You'll see it.

40
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:32,937
- Back of Asda, see?
- Okay.

41
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,238
- Am I keeping you from something?
- No.

42
00:14:36,307 --> 00:14:38,242
- Where are you going?
- Along here.

43
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:41,679
- For what? For work?
- No, I need to go meet somebody.

44
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,280
- Oh, you're going to meet someone.
- Aye.

45
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:44,681
- All right. Thank you.
- Sure.

46
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,915
I'm looking for a post office.

47
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,950
- Post office?
- Yes.

48
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:21,318
Where are you from?

49
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:22,753
- Where I am from?
- Yeah.

50
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:25,289
- Albania.
- Oh, are you?

51
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,857
- You have family here?
- Yes.

52
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:28,325
Oh, you do.

53
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:31,328
That's the reason I'm saying
you have to go another way...

54
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,631
for another...

55
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,732
It's after the shopping ce...

56
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,824
- Hi.
- Lost?

57
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:02,826
- Yeah, lost.
- What are you looking for?

58
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:05,229
- I'm looking for the M8.
- Up to the roundabout...

59
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,197
- Are you walking?
- Yep.

60
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:09,266
- Where are you walking to?
- Home.

61
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:12,269
- Oh, you're going home. To your family?
- No, no, just myself.

62
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,405
- Just yourself?
- Aye. It's great.

63
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:18,008
- Yeah? How?
- I can do whatever I like.

64
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,444
- So where are you coming from?
- Govan. Right there.

65
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:22,179
- Sorry?
- Govan.

66
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,315
- Govan? Do you work there?
- No, no.

67
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:27,818
Don't work there.
I work for myself.

68
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:31,287
- Do you want a lift?
- Eh... Aye, why not?

69
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,831
You'll have to tell
me how to get there.

70
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:43,366
- Just follow this road straight up.
- Okay.

71
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:46,103
Sure.

72
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:48,372
- So what do you do?
- Electrician.

73
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:49,806
Oh, you're an electrician.

74
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,811
It's cold, right?

75
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,412
- Ah, it's a wee bit nippy, aye.
- Yeah.

76
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,783
So what is it youse all doing?

77
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,885
I'm... I'm just, uh, driving...

78
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:06,290
just, uh... some furniture
for my family and...

79
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,892
- Oh, right?
- Yeah.

80
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:10,394
So you live alone?

81
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,162
- Yes.
- And you love it?

82
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:15,399
- Aye. It's great.
- What do you love about living alone?

83
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,302
- Nobody to nag you.
- Do I go straight through?

84
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,337
Yeah, just straight through.
Straight through the whole way.

85
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:58,041
It should be just cart around that
street and stay in the right hand lane.

86
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,310
- What's that?
- That's a tattoo of my name.

87
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:01,979
- Of your name?
- Yeah.

88
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,213
- What's your name?
- Andy.

89
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:04,848
- Andy. Hi.
- Pleased to meet you.

90
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:07,484
- Nice to meet you too.
- Thank you very much.

91
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,820
Andy!

92
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:11,021
- Want me?
- You coming?

93
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,463
The spot back here, you get... you put
your hand out. Anybody can stop.

94
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:22,266
There's lonely old guys.
Know what I mean?

95
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,869
It was... Hey, might as well check
her out, driving away in a big van.

96
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,005
Sure you can drive this, huh? Huh?

97
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,512
- No girlfriend? Really?
- Nah, I don't have a girlfriend at all.

98
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:38,047
You're very charming.

99
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,586
That's better.

100
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:47,189
Yeah? Sorted?

101
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:50,327
- You have a handsome face.
- Aye?

102
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:53,130
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot. Cheers.

103
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,566
- Do you think I'm pretty?
- I think you're gorgeous.

104
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,633
- Do you?
- Aye, definitely.

105
00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:00,002
Good.

106
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,575
And a friendly smile as well.

107
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,877
- Do I?
- Aye, right deep.

108
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:09,012
- What about your smile?
- Aye.

109
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:10,514
You've a nice smile yourself.

110
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:12,916
- Cheers.
- Good.

111
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,450
Good.

112
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:56,345
No, no, no, lads! No!

113
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:55,171
Mommy! Whoo!

114
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:56,166
I thought...

115
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,801
you had your eye on my towel.

116
00:23:57,802 --> 00:24:00,203
No. I wanted to speak to you.

117
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:02,804
Do you know if there's any good
spots to surf around here?

118
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,310
I'm not a surfer. Just living
in a little tent over there.

119
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:10,213
- Just hanging around.
- Yeah?

120
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:13,349
- Reading, swimming.
- You're not from here? Where are you from?

121
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:17,987
- I'm from Czech Republic.
- Why are you in Scotland?

122
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:22,692
I just... wanted to
get away from it all.

123
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:24,928
Yeah? Why here?

124
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:26,930
Because it's...

125
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,397
It's nowhere.

126
00:32:59,942 --> 00:33:02,979
Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Excuse me.

127
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,314
Can I talk to you before
you run away, darling?

128
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:07,884
I wanted to speak to you earlier,
right, but you disappeared.

129
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,787
I thought you went to
the ladies' or somethin'.

130
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:14,257
Anyway, right, fuck
all that shite. Right?

131
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:17,060
I really want to buy you a drink,
man. You look absolutely stunning.

132
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,861
And I...

133
00:33:18,862 --> 00:33:22,065
You know what? I'm all
alone. You're all alone.

134
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,267
What do you say? What's one drink?

135
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,035
What's one drink?

136
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:28,805
- I saw you on the road.
- What, you saw <i>me</i> on the road?

137
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:31,441
- Earlier, yeah.
- Are you having a laugh with me?

138
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,943
You saw me? You wanna come
get a drink and a dance?

139
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:36,746
- Are you alone here?
- Yeah, I'm all alone. Right?

140
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:07,575
The man from the car,
he buy the rose for you.

141
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:07,236
A man's body has been found
washed up on a beach... near Arbroath.

142
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:09,805
His wife and child are
reported missing.

143
00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:12,241
The police say the body
has been identified...

144
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:15,277
as 36-year-old Kenneth
McClelland from Edinburgh.

145
00:40:15,278 --> 00:40:17,480
The body was found by a tourist...

146
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,583
and is believed to have been
in the water for some time.

147
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:25,387
Mr. McClelland was married and worked as a
chemistry lecturer at Edinburgh University.

148
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:29,158
The alarm was raised when he failed
to turn up for work this morning.

149
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:32,661
His car was found at the
nearby Deer Park Golf Club.

150
00:40:32,662 --> 00:40:36,232
His wife, 32-year-old Alison
McClelland, and 18-month-old son...

151
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,434
are believed to have been with him.

152
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:41,570
A police and coast guard search
operation involving a helicopter...

153
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:43,739
has been halted due to fog.

154
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,574
The next bulletin is on the hour.

155
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:50,346
Well, plenty to talk
about, as ever, with Kay.

156
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,182
You can call now...
10-500-92-95-00.

157
00:40:53,183 --> 00:40:55,184
You can text as well... 80295.

158
00:40:55,185 --> 00:40:57,353
- It's 8:17.
- Good morning, Gary.

159
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:00,222
Well, as we've heard, for a
whole host of reasons...

160
00:41:00,223 --> 00:41:02,558
2014 is a very important
year for Scotland.

161
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:04,860
Of course, the referendum. We're
expecting that date today.

162
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:07,930
But the Commonwealth
Games and Ryder Cup...

163
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:10,299
- You seem very excited about that.
- I am.

164
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,701
He's jumping out of his seat at the
prospect of the year he's gonna have...

165
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:53,508
<i>Fuckin' hell, you're gorgeous.</i>

166
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:57,845
- You think so?
- It's your eyes.

167
00:41:58,948 --> 00:42:01,449
Somethin' about your eyes.

168
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:04,887
Your eyes, your lips.

169
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:07,055
- That black hair.
- Yeah?

170
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:11,993
You just look...

171
00:42:13,262 --> 00:42:14,830
amazing.

172
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:27,122
Hey, you okay?

173
00:45:35,497 --> 00:45:38,566
Want a hand up? Want a hand?

174
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:25,894
Get out, eh? Get out!

175
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:08,863
Excuse me.

176
00:51:10,132 --> 00:51:11,767
Excuse me.

177
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,770
Uh, I'm a bit lost, really.

178
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,937
Am I headed towards Taynuilt?

179
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:19,040
Yeah.

180
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:21,977
I am? Is it far?

181
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,146
It's about 10 minutes away.

182
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,413
Ten minutes? Are you...
Are you headed there?

183
00:51:27,315 --> 00:51:31,051
- I'm going to the supermarket.
- Is it on the way?

184
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:36,057
Yeah.

185
00:51:36,058 --> 00:51:38,225
I could drop you off if you'd like.

186
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,000
Yeah?

187
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,464
Here. Let me turn this up for you.

188
00:52:26,074 --> 00:52:28,042
That's better.

189
00:52:43,158 --> 00:52:44,992
You're very quiet.

190
00:52:50,932 --> 00:52:53,267
So why do you shop at night then?

191
00:52:57,372 --> 00:52:59,206
People wind me up.

192
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:02,609
How?

193
00:53:04,913 --> 00:53:06,714
They're ignorant.

194
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:12,686
What about your friends?

195
00:53:15,957 --> 00:53:18,092
So you don't have any friends?

196
00:53:23,265 --> 00:53:24,465
No.

197
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:27,201
How about a girlfriend?

198
00:53:33,408 --> 00:53:35,142
How old are you?

199
00:53:36,611 --> 00:53:38,278
I'm 26.

200
00:53:40,148 --> 00:53:43,050
When was the last time
you had a girlfriend?

201
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,589
Never had one.

202
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,423
So don't you get lonely then?

203
00:53:56,698 --> 00:53:58,532
You've very nice hands.

204
00:54:03,672 --> 00:54:05,572
You've beautiful hands.

205
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:29,998
Do you want to look at me?

206
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:32,366
- This isn't Tesco's, is it?
- No.

207
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,108
I noticed you looking at me before.

208
00:54:46,614 --> 00:54:48,148
And?

209
00:54:49,617 --> 00:54:51,618
I liked it.

210
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:58,460
You're uncomfortable.

211
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,261
No. Just want to go to Tesco's.

212
00:55:07,402 --> 00:55:10,137
So you never think about it then?

213
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:14,341
Think about what?

214
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:17,778
Being with a girl.

215
00:55:24,052 --> 00:55:26,619
When was the last time
you touched someone?

216
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,601
Let me see your hands.

217
00:55:47,509 --> 00:55:49,176
Cold.

218
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,148
I have to get back soon.

219
00:56:05,293 --> 00:56:07,261
How was that?

220
00:56:08,163 --> 00:56:09,463
Cold.

221
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:15,236
Do you want to do it again?

222
00:56:15,237 --> 00:56:17,337
Yeah.

223
00:56:25,146 --> 00:56:27,382
Do you want to touch my neck?

224
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,216
Here.

225
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:39,760
How was that?

226
00:56:41,463 --> 00:56:43,297
Yeah.

227
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:46,800
Your hands are very soft.

228
00:56:54,509 --> 00:56:57,344
I have a place about
30 minutes away.

229
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,881
Will you come with me there?

230
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,576
Cold.

231
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:03,877
I won't let that stop us.

232
00:58:23,665 --> 00:58:25,332
Come to me.

233
00:58:40,615 --> 00:58:42,450
Dreaming?

234
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:43,851
Yes.

235
00:58:43,852 --> 00:58:45,587
Dreaming?

236
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,421
Yes, we are.

237
01:09:46,647 --> 01:09:49,615
The bus will be along in a minute.

238
01:10:45,472 --> 01:10:47,854
Do you not think you should be
wearing a jacket, little lass?

239
01:10:47,855 --> 01:10:50,010
The weather's terrible up here.

240
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:54,280
You'll catch your death of cold if you've
not got a jacket or a hat or something on.

241
01:10:57,518 --> 01:11:00,186
You've not got the right
clothes on at all.

242
01:11:07,594 --> 01:11:09,495
You all right there?

243
01:11:11,665 --> 01:11:13,399
Eh?

244
01:11:14,368 --> 01:11:16,202
You okay?

245
01:11:21,408 --> 01:11:22,977
Can I do something for you?

246
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,679
Chase yourself, dafty.

247
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,781
Leave the lassie alone. She doesn't
want anything to do with you.

248
01:11:37,391 --> 01:11:39,492
Do you need any help?

249
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:50,837
Yes.

250
01:11:58,312 --> 01:12:00,179
Right.

251
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,328
Let me just take your coat.

252
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:23,956
<i>Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.</i>

253
01:14:26,426 --> 01:14:28,829
<i>Spoon, Jar. Jar... Wonder whether
that's working, don't you?</i>

254
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,397
Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.

255
01:14:30,398 --> 01:14:32,266
Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.

256
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,300
Spoon, Jar. Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.

257
01:14:40,408 --> 01:14:42,008
Stop!

258
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,748
Stop!

259
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,350
<i>Pull it. Pull it.</i>

260
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:58,057
<i>Now I've stood on your shadow</i>

261
01:14:59,726 --> 01:15:01,894
<i>And I've watched it grow</i>

262
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:06,065
<i>And it's shaken and
it's driven me</i>

263
01:15:07,267 --> 01:15:09,436
<i>And let me know
Let me know</i>

264
01:15:09,437 --> 01:15:13,339
<i>Let me know, let me know about
all the old forty-fives</i>

265
01:15:14,441 --> 01:15:16,742
<i>And the paperback rooms</i>

266
01:15:17,978 --> 01:15:20,846
<i>And it's scattered
all the photographs</i>

267
01:15:21,915 --> 01:15:23,883
<i>Of summers and suns</i>

268
01:15:25,252 --> 01:15:27,753
<i>And you're a real gone kid</i>

269
01:15:29,556 --> 01:15:33,260
<i>And maybe now, baby
Maybe now, baby</i>

270
01:15:33,261 --> 01:15:36,597
<i>Maybe now, baby
Maybe now, baby</i>

271
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:37,965
<i>And maybe now, baby</i>

272
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:40,434
<i>Maybe now, baby</i>

273
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:42,368
<i>I'll do what I should have di</i>

274
01:15:43,537 --> 01:15:45,839
<i>'Cause you're a real</i>

275
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,073
<i>Gone...</i>

276
01:16:17,004 --> 01:16:18,904
Night.

277
01:20:35,161 --> 01:20:36,929
You all right?

278
01:20:42,302 --> 01:20:44,937
If you're frightened, let's go.

279
01:20:51,111 --> 01:20:52,811
Come on.

280
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:56,081
It's all right.

281
01:20:57,217 --> 01:20:59,051
That's it.

282
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:38,724
It's okay. It's okay.

283
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:53,005
It's okay.

284
01:21:54,174 --> 01:21:56,108
It's okay.

285
01:22:01,214 --> 01:22:03,215
All right.

286
01:22:06,386 --> 01:22:08,288
Okay.

287
01:22:08,289 --> 01:22:10,223
You did it.

288
01:22:10,224 --> 01:22:12,057
You did it.

289
01:26:25,078 --> 01:26:26,378
You all right?

290
01:28:33,272 --> 01:28:36,442
You just off for a ramble
in the woods then? Eh?

291
01:28:36,443 --> 01:28:38,823
- Huh?
- You just off for a ramble in the woods?

292
01:28:38,824 --> 01:28:42,715
Yeah, yeah? Oh, it's, uh... Watch how
you step here. It's a bit, uh...

293
01:28:42,716 --> 01:28:46,152
It's a bit slippery round here,
but... this time of year.

294
01:28:46,153 --> 01:28:50,323
It's all right in summer. Well, it's still
wet in summer, but not as bad as it is now.

295
01:28:50,324 --> 01:28:52,625
But there's plenty of
trails around here.

296
01:28:52,626 --> 01:28:54,560
Have you been here before?

297
01:28:54,561 --> 01:28:56,295
No? First time? Yeah?

298
01:28:56,296 --> 01:28:58,664
Oh, you won't get lost.
They're all clearly marked.

299
01:28:58,665 --> 01:29:02,135
But, uh, there's about 2,000
acres of forest here,

300
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:06,072
so you shouldn't... you should have,
uh, plenty of places to go in there.

301
01:29:06,073 --> 01:29:07,807
- You on your own?
- Yeah.

302
01:29:07,808 --> 01:29:12,578
Yeah, on your own? Oh, well, it's a
nice place if you want some solitude,

303
01:29:12,579 --> 01:29:16,416
you know, to "gather your
thoughts" and all that, yeah?

304
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:19,217
- So, uh, enjoy yourself anyway, okay?
- Thank you.
