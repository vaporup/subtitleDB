Do you remember anything about
where you were before you woke up?

92
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:26,531

00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:17,826
It doesn't matter I can't say anything

How do I know that you're the

00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:37,971
If I were driving the car,

00:30:07,491 --> 00:30:10,859
Try  Atlantic City, if you don't like
to fly. I don't know what to tell you

346
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:14,929
I'm glad you still have
your sense of humor

347
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:17,304
but I'm on a schedule Agent Raines

348
00:30:17,304 --> 00:30:19,953
and very soon, my patient will run out

349
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:32,643
God damn it

350
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:36,523
Fuck

351
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,180
Henry, are you still with me?

352
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,335
Jeremy, Is that you?
I thought you're gone

353
00:30:57,335 --> 00:31:01,100
No, I'm still here

354
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:05,911
They gave me a shot.
They save my life

355
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:09,637
Why would they do that?
I do not understand

356
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:10,298
Look

357
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,243
if we going to find out
what's going on here

358
00:31:14,244 --> 00:31:16,185
I want to know
everything you know

359
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:20,546
All I know is that this is something
to do about Roulette

360
00:31:25,146 --> 00:31:27,246
What do you know about that?

361
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,660
I know its an underground bunker with

362
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,917
the President and Vice President
and National Security Adviser are all

363
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:34,920
taken if there ever were
an attack on Washington

364
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,198
after 9/11 they built
a series of bunkers

365
00:31:37,198 --> 00:31:39,461
Go to the bunkers changes
randomly without notices

366
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:43,676
Only a hand full of people ever know
which one of this on an any given day

367
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:45,418
That's why they call them Roulette

368
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:47,741
How do you know that?

369
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:51,655
I told you earlier I'm with the
State Department Jeremy

370
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:55,238
- No, you never mention that to me
- Yes, I did

371
00:31:55,238 --> 00:31:57,323
I assigned the National Security
Council at the center of operations

372
00:31:57,323 --> 00:31:59,294
I worked in the White House
I was in New York for a briefing

373
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,500
at the United Nations

374
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,912
you never mention
that to me before man

375
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:06,072
Yeah, I tried to tell you earlier but you cut me off

376
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:08,481
You didn't trust anything
I said, remember?

377
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:10,068
Please Jeremy. Look I'm just

378
00:32:10,068 --> 00:32:11,188
Okay

379
00:32:12,186 --> 00:32:16,202
Alright, is Dave Lau is still the
senior NSA rep in the Ops Center?

380
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:17,941
What? You're quizzing me?

381
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:20,433
Brian Nolan replaced him in the
center of operations two years ago

382
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:23,599
Dave Lau went to the Pentagon,
the Minister of Defense office

383
00:32:26,106 --> 00:32:28,166
Okay, you're working in
the operations center

384
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:30,730
I want to know what painting
hanging on in the conference room

385
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:33,602
That's a trick question

386
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:35,755
There are no paintings there
Jeremy, please. Come on

387
00:32:35,755 --> 00:32:38,947
I'm just a State Department AttachÃ©
I'm not cut out for this

388
00:32:38,947 --> 00:32:41,817
I just trying to stay alive
and keep my family safe

389
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:44,870
stop talking

390
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,148
best thing you can is be quiet

391
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:52,041
They know where my family lives

392
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,435
Do you think that I'm going to lay
here and fucking give up? No way

393
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:56,027
Look I'm not going to do that

394
00:32:56,028 --> 00:32:58,224
Yes you are.
Because that is your duty

395
00:32:58,224 --> 00:33:00,044
Your duty is to keep your mouth shut

396
00:33:01,434 --> 00:33:03,396
When you joined the State,
you took an oath

397
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,540
Don't forget that

398
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:14,702
Do you have any kids, Jeremy?

399
00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:24,072
No. No I don't... we are

400
00:33:27,014 --> 00:33:30,267
Me and my wife got
separated three months ago

401
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:34,431
We were just about to try
it's definitely in the card

402
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:39,734
- I'm sorry
- Yeah, me too

403
00:33:44,343 --> 00:33:46,443
I was just trying to make
things right between us

404
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,130
That's why I was in New York.
That's why I went there

405
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,541
to set things straight with this
guy who I owed money to

406
00:33:56,654 --> 00:33:58,474
How many kids you got, Henry?

407
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,185
I have two, 7 and 9, boys

408
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:05,504
and are we supposed to go out on

409
00:34:05,505 --> 00:34:07,401
vacation in after few
weeks to Disney World

410
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:09,017
the boys love rock
and roll roller-coaster

411
00:34:09,017 --> 00:34:11,752
I can't stand roller-coasters
but right now

412
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:14,041
Right now all I think about is
getting out of here in one piece

413
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:17,261
So I can ride roller-coaster
with them, you understand?

414
00:34:17,262 --> 00:34:18,066
Yeah

415
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,952
I hope you get that chance,
I really do

416
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,423
Do you hear sirens?

417
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:37,828
Yeah, sounds like
they just passed me

418
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:40,582
- They passed you?
- Yeah

419
00:34:48,425 --> 00:34:49,545
Pull over with the break

420
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,013
Damn it, I told you to stay down
on speed limits, we're screwed

421
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:59,814
Just relax and stay cool,
as long as he stay quiet back there

422
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,645
You so much as sneeze

423
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:07,340
I cut your wife's head off
and mail it to her parents

424
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,197
What are you doing?
You suppose to stop

425
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:15,313
You make this problem now fix this

426
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,996
Come on, think

427
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:19,816
Act normal. Let me do the talking
We just get  a ticket

428
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:22,059

429
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:24,634

- I'm real sorry, officer

431

We're late for a meeting and
I wasn't paying attention

432
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:38,680
- Is this your car?
- Yes, Sir. It is

433
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,471

436
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:07,312
Come on, come on

00:44:17,627 --> 00:44:20,995
- How can you see that?

518
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:23,146
Did you say a bullet hole?

519
00:44:23,146 --> 00:44:25,775
We got pull over by the
police, it was a shootout

520
00:44:25,775 --> 00:44:28,813
Are you injured? Are you in
need of medical attention?

521
00:44:28,813 --> 00:44:32,187
Well I lost a lot of blood but I
tied it off, it should be alright

522
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,635
Do you see an
emergency trunk latches?

523
00:44:34,635 --> 00:44:37,001

escape into the back seat?

Yes, I see it. I see it.

525
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:42,916

00:52:29,391 --> 00:52:31,562
explosion from inside the facility

636
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:33,342

A freshman at Princeton
Community College

She stopped to get gas on the way

00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,566
explosion occurred.
Amanda, what can you tell us?

640
00:52:41,247 --> 00:52:43,501
I was just standing over
there filling my car

641
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:47,990
when all of the sudden I heard this
2 big boom right near the road

642
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,876
I thought it was an
earthquake of something

643
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:54,139
When I looked over it was a smoke cloud

644
00:52:54,139 --> 00:52:55,719
just like they're now

645
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:58,619
Those people are like a ghost,
they disappeared

646
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:01,367
I didn't know what's going on but
I knew that it's not good

647
00:53:01,367 --> 00:53:02,539
Thank you, Amanda

648
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:05,465
Right now, a huge cloud of smoke still
cover the road entrance

649
00:53:05,465 --> 00:53:07,202
road around Andrews are grid lock

650
00:53:07,202 --> 00:53:08,942
Norman. Back to you in the studio

651
00:53:08,942 --> 00:53:11,042
and we end up bringing to you
right now on our breaking news

652
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:12,658
All of this just unfolded

653
00:53:12,658 --> 00:53:15,287
Associated Press and a local source
confirming now 2

654
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:18,004
separate explosions outside CIA HQ

655
00:53:18,004 --> 00:53:19,901
in the Langley suburb of McLean

656
00:53:19,901 --> 00:53:22,761
2 Blasts occurring within just
minutes of each other

657
00:53:22,761 --> 00:53:25,581
One explosion at the National
Highway Testing Center

658
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:27,419
which adjoined CIA HQ

659
00:53:27,419 --> 00:53:30,634
Then a second larger explosion
has collapse apparently of

660
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:33,223
Portion of George Washington
Memorial Highway

661
00:53:33,223 --> 00:53:35,891
which runs directly
along CIA property lines

662
00:53:35,891 --> 00:53:39,668
There are unconfirmed reports at this
moment, that this were car bombing

663
00:53:39,668 --> 00:53:41,794
but we don't want
to speculate just yet

664
00:53:41,794 --> 00:53:44,326
because of course the
situations isn't very clear

665
00:53:44,326 --> 00:53:47,127
To get more information, by the minute

666
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:50,623
So we stay on top until
we have more information

667
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,336
Incoming units, be advised..

668
00:53:56,336 --> 00:53:58,725

Controls, multiple casualties

673
00:54:22,806 --> 00:54:24,206

Please, don't tell me you

682
00:54:53,494 --> 00:54:55,178
How do you know that?

683
00:54:55,178 --> 00:54:57,070
You're not the only one

684
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,954

Two FBIs even the Deputy
Chief of Staff, maybe more

687
00:55:06,224 --> 00:55:08,092
One just detonated outside of Langley

688
00:55:08,092 --> 00:55:11,439
Jeremy, I have to go. We're last ones
in the building, we're evacuating

689
00:55:11,439 --> 00:55:12,918
We could hit next

690
00:55:12,918 --> 00:55:14,931
Whoa

691
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:18,046
Detonated?
What're you talking about?

692
00:55:19,102 --> 00:55:23,497
Bombs, car bombs
and you're lying inside one

693
00:55:24,832 --> 00:55:27,732
I'm sorry, Jeremy. I have to go
I call you back at this number

694
00:55:27,732 --> 00:55:30,918
Hey, Ben I need your cell

695
00:55:41,364 --> 00:55:44,103
Ben. I need your cell.
Hello?

696
00:55:44,103 --> 00:55:45,223
Jeremy

697
00:55:45,873 --> 00:55:46,993
Molly?

698
00:55:46,993 --> 00:55:49,549
Oh my God I'm in a trunk of a car

699
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:51,283
- it's moving
- What?

700
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:56,108
- I can't get out
- What? No, no, no, no. Fuck

701
00:55:56,108 --> 00:55:56,967
I'm so scared

702
00:55:56,968 --> 00:55:59,677
Tell me where you are.
What's going on?

703
00:55:59,677 --> 00:56:04,567
I'm in a car, and it's moving
and don't know what to do

704
00:56:05,406 --> 00:56:09,133
- Alright. Just stay with me, alright
- Okay

705
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:13,194
I'm here, I'm here. Let think with
each other for a minute, okay?

706
00:56:13,195 --> 00:56:14,209
Okay

707
00:56:14,209 --> 00:56:15,999
Did you see who put you in the car?

708
00:56:16,994 --> 00:56:19,965
I don't know. It's happen so fast

709
00:56:19,965 --> 00:56:24,233
Okay, alright. I need you to stay calm
alright babe? We need to think

710
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,460
Stay calm, just try to relax, okay?

711
00:56:29,475 --> 00:56:32,461
Why is this happening to us?
What do they want?

712
00:56:32,461 --> 00:56:34,428
This all part of the terrorist attack

713
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:37,980
They want information
about The President Bunker

714
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,109
I got the information
they're trying to get out of it

715
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:43,534
Oh my God this can't be happening

716
00:56:46,358 --> 00:56:48,549

717
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:53,760

721
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:06,951
- You believe me?
- Yes

722
00:57:07,861 --> 00:57:10,206
Listen, there's something

00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:32,296
- Bring her to me

754
00:59:34,707 --> 00:59:35,827

00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:46,444
Just give them what they want

00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:52,558
Now you listen to me
Agent Raines

760
00:59:52,558 --> 00:59:54,519
Give us the location

761
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,173

762
00:59:57,173 --> 00:59:59,205

01:00:17,977 --> 01:00:21,215
Jeremy, help
Help me, something's happening

766
01:00:21,215 --> 01:00:22,472
What's going on, Henry?
What's wrong?

767
01:00:22,472 --> 01:00:25,248
Jeremy, the trunk is filled
with some kind of liquid.

768
01:00:25,249 --> 01:00:26,452
I don't know what it is

769
01:00:27,896 --> 01:00:29,016
Liquid? What?

770
01:00:30,803 --> 01:00:35,679
Just keep talking to me, Henry
Just don't stop, keep talking to me

771
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:38,834
Jeremy, it's filling
I-I think I'm gonna drown

772
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:41,377
There is no time left
on the clock

773
01:00:41,377 --> 01:00:45,420
What's going happen to me, Jeremy?
Are they really going to let me drawn

774
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:49,261
Jeremy, please.
Give them what they want

775
01:00:49,261 --> 01:00:53,439
This is my life, man
Just tell them.

776
01:00:57,342 --> 01:00:59,162
I'm sorry, Henry

777
01:01:02,027 --> 01:01:04,127
But I can't do that

778
01:01:07,337 --> 01:01:09,157
I'm so sorry

779
01:01:17,516 --> 01:01:20,807
Our Father lord of heaven
hallowed be by name

780
01:01:20,807 --> 01:01:24,391
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be
done on earth as in the sky

781
01:01:24,391 --> 01:01:27,176
Give us today our daily bread
and forgive us for trespasses

782
01:01:27,176 --> 01:01:29,736
We forgive those trespass against us

783
01:01:29,736 --> 01:01:32,839
lead us not into temptation...
but deliver us from evil

784
01:01:54,271 --> 01:01:57,114
Henry?
Henry, are still with me?

785
01:01:58,373 --> 01:02:01,144
Henry.
Fuck!

786
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:20,075
We are experiencing an
unusually high call volume

787
01:02:20,075 --> 01:02:22,820
- Please try call again later
- Shit

788
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,078
This is not a test

789
01:02:37,078 --> 01:02:39,929
The state and federal
authorities has

790
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:43,081
activated the Emergency
Broadcast System

791
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:45,274
Please do not use your telephone

792
01:02:45,274 --> 01:02:49,054
Stay tuned to this station for
news and official information

793
01:02:49,054 --> 01:02:52,299
I repeat this is not a test

794
01:02:52,858 --> 01:02:55,639
we are standing by for an announcement
from The President with

795
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:58,065
the additional bombing at
Andrews Air Force Base and

796
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:02,429
other locations around the capital
it is clear, we are under attacked

797
01:03:02,429 --> 01:03:05,522
The President and first family
has been taken to a secure location

798
01:03:05,522 --> 01:03:07,621
Air Force One touch down at
Andrews Air Force Base

799
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:10,426
just minutes before the
three bombs exploded there

800
01:03:10,426 --> 01:03:13,404
Smoke can now be seen from
miles all around Washington

801
01:03:13,404 --> 01:03:15,559
and more explosions
may be imminent

802
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,795
Please, stay off the
highways and roads

803
01:03:17,796 --> 01:03:19,975
emergency vehicles
need to get through

804
01:03:19,975 --> 01:03:23,302
Stay in your home. We're waiting
for the president address

805
01:03:23,302 --> 01:03:26,226
as soon as that happens
we will go directly to it

806
01:03:26,226 --> 01:03:29,358
Right now though, lets go to
Susan Gibbs in the capital

807
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:32,141
and Susan, you've got a front row
seat to see what's going on there

808
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,200
as long as....street

809
01:03:35,726 --> 01:03:38,797
- Hello?
- Jeremy, It's Ben. You there?

810
01:03:38,797 --> 01:03:43,703
Ben. Ben, what do you know?
What's going on?

811
01:03:43,703 --> 01:03:45,592
Car bombs are going off
all over the district, if we can't

812
01:03:45,592 --> 01:03:48,110
locate them before they detonate

813
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:50,496
There got us at a god damn time

814
01:03:52,676 --> 01:03:54,063
Ben they have Molly

815
01:03:55,409 --> 01:03:58,228
They have her in the trunk of a car
I talked to her

816
01:03:58,228 --> 01:04:01,968
- Oh Jesus, Jeremy. I'm sorry
- Listen to me...

817
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:03,635
They're targeting the President

818
01:04:04,908 --> 01:04:07,842
Well I'm getting this all second hand
but the Vice President safe

819
01:04:07,842 --> 01:04:09,729
I don't know about POTUS
and the first family

820
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:11,698
my guess is they're already
off to locate them

821
01:04:11,698 --> 01:04:13,271
But I can't get confirmation

822
01:04:13,271 --> 01:04:15,657
I out of the loop when I took over
the loop since I took over recruitment

823
01:04:15,657 --> 01:04:17,477
That's what the terrorists wants

824
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:20,002
They want everything to go underground

825
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:22,391
What are you talking about?

826
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,718
How the bombing has there been?

827
01:04:25,718 --> 01:04:28,826
Five confirmed
Andrews, Langley

828
01:04:28,826 --> 01:04:31,225
Toll station on 395,
Reagan National

829
01:04:31,225 --> 01:04:32,908
and now the 14 Street Bridge

830
01:04:32,908 --> 01:04:35,212
that's the mass, the district
is completely paralyze

831
01:04:35,212 --> 01:04:36,612
That's what they're doing

832
01:04:38,355 --> 01:04:40,562
They've taken away all the avenues

833
01:04:40,562 --> 01:04:43,316
They taken away all our sources
They're contain the fucking city

834
01:04:43,316 --> 01:04:45,213
So nobody could get in or out

835
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:48,858
- Even The President
- He's definitely been secured

836
01:04:48,858 --> 01:04:49,978
Yeah, Roulette

837
01:04:50,734 --> 01:04:52,304
That's why I'm in here

838
01:04:52,304 --> 01:04:53,707
They want to
location of Roulette

839
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:55,522
That's what they're
trying to get out of me

840
01:04:55,522 --> 01:04:57,039
Jeremy, listen to me

841
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,453
They may already have them
from one of the other captive

842
01:04:59,453 --> 01:05:01,522
We have to warn the protection detail

843
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:04,322
No, it won't work man.
He's already in the bunker

844
01:05:05,086 --> 01:05:06,034
God Damn it, Jeremy

845
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:08,280
There's an imminent
threat to the President

846
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,100
His location may have been compromise

847
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:13,069
I'll go myself just tell me where

848
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:16,348
Why you asked me that Ben?

849
01:05:17,962 --> 01:05:19,908
You know I can't say anything

850
01:05:19,908 --> 01:05:21,728
They're listening to me

851
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,588
What about Molly? You never
told her anything, do you?

852
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,620
No. No, nothing
she's know nothing

853
01:05:29,513 --> 01:05:31,595
They are using her as
leverage against me

854
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:33,368
Jeremy, just trust me on this

855
01:05:33,368 --> 01:05:36,091
We're tracking the cell number,
we will find you

856
01:05:36,091 --> 01:05:39,079
.. Listen to me, you find Molly first

857
01:05:39,757 --> 01:05:42,972
You track her phone
and you find her

858
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:46,511
I'm begging you man,
you do this for me, okay?

859
01:05:47,203 --> 01:05:49,296
Do not even think about coming for me

860
01:05:49,296 --> 01:05:52,063
- You find Molly
- Hey somebody get on that other line

861
01:05:52,063 --> 01:05:55,352
Jeremy, is there anything else you can
tell me? Anything at all?

862
01:05:56,391 --> 01:05:57,791
You're running out of time

863
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:01,492
We're doing what we can as
fastest we can and now listen

864
01:06:01,492 --> 01:06:03,894
You going to have time reaching me
because we're on the move

865
01:06:03,894 --> 01:06:07,037
But I promise, I call you
back as soon as I can

866
01:06:07,037 --> 01:06:09,261
- Hanging there
- Yeah

867
01:06:10,544 --> 01:06:11,944
Okay, Ben

868
01:06:22,189 --> 01:06:23,571
For those who just joining us now

869
01:06:23,571 --> 01:06:25,925
We are on the line with
someone calling himself Jeremy

870
01:06:25,925 --> 01:06:28,017
That maybe involved in this attack

871
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,868
- Sir, this is Real Time Morning News
- What the fuck?

872
01:06:29,868 --> 01:06:31,268
Are you still with us?

873
01:06:31,877 --> 01:06:33,599
Hang up the god damn phone

874
01:06:34,234 --> 01:06:37,625
Okay, can you confirm what's
taking place? Are you one of them?

875
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:41,932
I said hang up the god damn phone
You're doing exactly what they want

876
01:06:41,932 --> 01:06:43,547
You're live on the air, sir

877
01:06:43,548 --> 01:06:46,597
I don't give a shit, you
know what you're doing?

878
01:06:46,597 --> 01:06:48,632
So, I want to repeat our
viewers right now

879
01:06:48,632 --> 01:06:51,989
Can you confirm whether
or not you're involved in this?

880
01:06:51,989 --> 01:06:54,034
No. I'm not a terrorist

881
01:06:54,034 --> 01:06:55,824
Then are you a hostage?
We have report

882
01:06:55,825 --> 01:06:57,614
that they're taking
hostages as well

883
01:06:57,614 --> 01:06:59,940
Who's this? What's your name?

884
01:07:00,904 --> 01:07:04,503
This is Jack Stern anchor
for Real Time Morning News

885
01:07:04,503 --> 01:07:07,979
Okay, Jack. Let's have a
little conversation. Alright?

886
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:12,228
The best thing you can do for everyone

887
01:07:13,353 --> 01:07:16,673
is to disconnect this call. To hang up

888
01:07:16,673 --> 01:07:19,642
because right now you're
doing everything to their plan

889
01:07:19,642 --> 01:07:21,663
They want to install fear and panic

890
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:24,529
You're doing that. They want paranoia

891
01:07:24,529 --> 01:07:27,826
You helping the bad guys man. So stop

892
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:31,303
Can you tell us anything?
Anything at all about this attack?

893
01:07:31,303 --> 01:07:33,829
You know what, you're an asshole
you fuck-head

894
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:36,457
How much do I have to
tell you to turn me off

895
01:09:01,656 --> 01:09:03,946
Stop this please

896
01:09:03,946 --> 01:09:05,699
Had enough?

897
01:09:05,699 --> 01:09:08,462
If you want out, give us Roulette

898
01:09:08,462 --> 01:09:10,933
Go fuck yourself

899
01:09:16,961 --> 01:09:18,361
You know

900
01:09:19,215 --> 01:09:21,035
I'm sorry. Alright?

901
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:29,131
I'm sorry! I'll tell you, I'll tell
you what you want to know

902
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:37,661
I'm sorry

903
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:46,237
Listen, I'm sorry. Alright?

904
01:09:47,696 --> 01:09:50,496
I'm ready to talk
I'm ready to deal

905
01:09:52,372 --> 01:09:54,472
I know you can hear
me in there, alright?

906
01:09:57,339 --> 01:09:58,739
I'm listening

907
01:10:02,009 --> 01:10:03,829
You're an American, man

908
01:10:05,653 --> 01:10:08,801
You're fucking American,
Why you doing this?

909
01:10:09,584 --> 01:10:11,994
Why are you part of this?

910
01:10:11,994 --> 01:10:16,461
Just tell us where Roulette is
or this conversation is over

911
01:10:23,193 --> 01:10:25,922
No, It's not because you
need me, remember?

912
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:29,282
You need me!
not the other way around

913
01:10:36,222 --> 01:10:37,622
I'm ain't telling you shit

914
01:10:40,121 --> 01:10:41,941
You fucking fail man

915
01:10:44,585 --> 01:10:46,655
You fucking fail miserably

916
01:10:46,655 --> 01:10:50,923
You do all of this, all this
effort and you got nothing

917
01:10:50,923 --> 01:10:54,350
You got nothing out of me
How about that huh?

918
01:10:57,079 --> 01:10:58,899
You fucking idiots

919
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:04,025
5 minutes huh, 5 minutes till
what motherfucker?

920
01:11:04,025 --> 01:11:07,296
Until you die
Goodbye, Jeremy

921
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:11,356
No. I said when this is over. I do

922
01:11:12,253 --> 01:11:15,997
You don't turn me off,
I turn you off!

923
01:11:15,997 --> 01:11:18,244
Get it?

924
01:11:18,244 --> 01:11:19,644
Fuck you

925
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:33,553
Hello? Hello?

926
01:11:33,553 --> 01:11:35,537

927
01:11:35,537 --> 01:11:38,412
- I was trying to reach you
- Well baby

928
01:11:38,412 --> 01:11:40,068
What is happening?
Where are you now?

929
01:11:40,068 --> 01:11:42,395
Emergency broadcast system in effect

930
01:11:42,395 --> 01:11:46,449
I've been calling you, babe
I can't reach you, are you okay?

931
01:11:46,449 --> 01:11:50,175
Jeremy, I think I know where I am
I think I'm in an ambulance

932
01:11:50,175 --> 01:11:51,224
How do you know that?

933
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:54,923
It's dark in here, but I can hear the
siren, it sound like it's on top of me

934
01:11:54,923 --> 01:11:56,156
Hold on

935
01:11:56,156 --> 01:11:57,956
- What?
- Something happening

936
01:11:57,956 --> 01:11:59,076
Okay

We're stopping, of traffic
Are you moving, Molly?

938
01:12:04,175 --> 01:12:05,447
Barely

939
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:07,357
Please, Jeremy.

940
01:12:07,357 --> 01:12:09,853
I promise you, baby

941
01:12:09,853 --> 01:12:11,832
The whole office is looking for you

942
01:12:11,832 --> 01:12:14,632
They're going to find you
I promise you baby. I promise

943
01:12:14,632 --> 01:12:16,426
Okay. Good

944
01:12:21,155 --> 01:12:23,016
- What?
- Molly, talk louder

945
01:12:23,016 --> 01:12:25,116
What happening? Jeremy,
Are you okay?

946
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,171
Holy fuck

947
01:12:28,924 --> 01:12:31,593
you're right.
You're in an ambulance and

948
01:12:31,594 --> 01:12:34,262
I'm in the back of a
fucking police car

949
01:12:35,105 --> 01:12:36,665
- Jeremy?
- Molly, Mol

950
01:12:36,665 --> 01:12:39,078
Jeremy, I can't, I can't,
can you hear me?

951
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:39,681
Molly

952
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,602
Molly

953
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,749
Fuck

954
01:13:22,191 --> 01:13:24,066
Come on, hold on

955
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:28,848
- Hello?
- Ben?

956
01:13:28,849 --> 01:13:31,250
Hold that and get to her
as fast as possible

957
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:34,055
Jeremy, listen. We've located Molly
and we are on our the way

958
01:13:34,055 --> 01:13:35,993
Where is she?

959
01:13:35,993 --> 01:13:38,763
- DuPont Circle
- DuPont Circle?

960
01:13:40,268 --> 01:13:42,147
It is a mile from
the White House

961
01:13:42,148 --> 01:13:44,856
I know, I know.
We're working as fast as we can

962
01:13:44,856 --> 01:13:47,863
- Well work faster
- We're trying, it's chaos out here

963
01:13:47,863 --> 01:13:50,576
Road are grid lock, I don't even
know how they're transporting her

964
01:13:50,576 --> 01:13:53,919
Look, she's inside of an ambulance
and I at the back of a police car

965
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,641
That's how they take
us through traffic

966
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:56,831
Jesus

967
01:13:56,831 --> 01:13:59,457
Guys, she's inside of an ambulance
Let's go, let's go

968
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:02,279
I'm not moving right now

969
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:04,373
As far as I know, she's not either

970
01:14:05,585 --> 01:14:09,110
- You're running out of time, man
- How much time?

971
01:14:09,687 --> 01:14:11,719
You got about 3 minutes

972
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:14,183
You need to clear the area

973
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:17,365
and keep the roadblocks in
place, don't let any cars through

974
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:19,679
Not even emergency
vehicles, you hear me?

975
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,781
I'll do what I can

976
01:14:20,781 --> 01:14:23,377
Now, you promise you don't
let any cars through

977
01:14:23,377 --> 01:14:25,475
Look, Jeremy. I can't promise anything

978
01:14:25,475 --> 01:14:26,875
Ben? Ben?!

979
01:14:28,877 --> 01:14:29,997
Ben?

980
01:14:37,684 --> 01:14:38,509
Ben?

981
01:14:38,509 --> 01:14:39,871
One last chance, Jeremy

982
01:14:39,872 --> 01:14:42,359
Give us the fucking
location of Roulette

983
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:46,182
I'm not giving you anything
I'm not giving you a god damn thing

984
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:50,390
Then good luck to you, Agent Raines
I'll tell Molly, good bye for you

985
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:53,203
You lay one hand on her,
I'm going to fucking kill you

986
01:15:07,872 --> 01:15:08,992
Oh come on

987
01:15:09,585 --> 01:15:12,709
Please pick up
Please. Please pick up

988
01:15:16,206 --> 01:15:18,328
- Jeremy?
- Hello, Molly

989
01:15:18,328 --> 01:15:22,782
- Oh thank god. Are you okay?
- I'm moving again

990
01:15:22,782 --> 01:15:25,723
God fucking roadblocks. I told them
to keep them in place

991
01:15:25,723 --> 01:15:28,771
What roadblocks?
Jeremy, what the hell is going on?

992
01:15:28,772 --> 01:15:29,691
What's happening?

993
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:33,541
- Listen to me. Do you trust me?
- Jeremy

994
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:37,528
- Do you trust me?
- Yes, I trust you

995
01:15:39,297 --> 01:15:40,417
Okay

996
01:15:42,085 --> 01:15:45,416
- We're together, baby
- What

997
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,656
We're traveling right
next to each other

998
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:53,091
What? Do you tell them
what they wanted to know?

999
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:57,624
No. I can't do that

1000
01:16:00,572 --> 01:16:02,392
I took an oath, Molly

1001
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,518
Jeremy, Please

1002
01:16:06,518 --> 01:16:10,496
I don't want to
die today, please

1003
01:16:10,497 --> 01:16:15,725
Just give them what they want.
Please, for me

1004
01:16:17,794 --> 01:16:20,500
I never want to do anything
to let you down there

1005
01:16:21,648 --> 01:16:23,702
I know that I done things to you

1006
01:16:25,718 --> 01:16:27,802
I never wanted to in my life

1007
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,199
Jeremy

1008
01:16:31,513 --> 01:16:33,833
I hurt you and I'm sorry

1009
01:16:36,295 --> 01:16:39,454
I can't think about those things now
I can't do anything about it

1010
01:16:41,387 --> 01:16:44,025
but I ask you now to accept me

1011
01:16:46,723 --> 01:16:48,123
to accept me for who I am

1012
01:16:50,419 --> 01:16:54,942
Of course, of course baby
I accept your

1013
01:16:54,942 --> 01:16:58,109
I love you, no matter what

1014
01:16:58,109 --> 01:17:02,594
- I love you so much
- ... I love you

1015
01:17:03,982 --> 01:17:05,794
I love you so much

1016
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:09,915
Molly

1017
01:17:12,784 --> 01:17:14,821
... It filled up. Molly

1018
01:17:15,593 --> 01:17:16,713
What the fuck?

1019
01:17:50,864 --> 01:17:52,207
- Hello?
- Jeremy, itâ€™s Ben

1020
01:17:52,207 --> 01:17:54,065
Ben

1021
01:17:54,065 --> 01:17:56,857
Bin, it almost fill up to the top man

1022
01:17:56,857 --> 01:18:00,533
I know, it's binary
explosive, liquid bomb

1023
01:18:00,533 --> 01:18:03,586
and you're dead either way
but I can save Molly

1024
01:18:03,586 --> 01:18:06,143
So tell us what we want to know

1025
01:18:06,143 --> 01:18:07,263
We?

1026
01:18:08,468 --> 01:18:10,255
You're part of this, Ben?

1027
01:18:11,184 --> 01:18:14,215
- It's just business my friend
- It's not business

1028
01:18:14,215 --> 01:18:16,584
Give us the location of Roulette

1029
01:18:16,584 --> 01:18:21,116
You're a coward, man
You're a fucking traitor

1030
01:18:21,116 --> 01:18:22,164
You were my friend

1031
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:26,643
- Enough, give us Roulette
- You were my friend man

1032
01:18:26,643 --> 01:18:28,463
Goodbye, Jeremy

1033
01:19:06,327 --> 01:19:07,447
Molly

1034
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,865
breathe, Jeremy
breathe, take it easy

1035
01:20:28,053 --> 01:20:29,777
Jeremy

1036
01:20:29,777 --> 01:20:32,559
Whoa. Easy, easy
You're safe now

1037
01:20:33,152 --> 01:20:34,531
Jeremy

1038
01:20:34,531 --> 01:20:38,934
It's Henry
... I'm Henry. It's Henry

1039
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:42,343
Put the gun down. Okay?
everything is cool. Alright?

1040
01:20:42,343 --> 01:20:45,540
Jeremy? Jeremy, I'm here

1041
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,544
- Molly
- I'm okay

1042
01:21:00,759 --> 01:21:02,579
You did good, real good

1043
01:21:03,254 --> 01:21:05,768
Are you kidding, boss?
He did fucking great

1044
01:21:05,768 --> 01:21:07,905
This guy is fucking hardcore

1045
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,488
Ben, don't fucking moves

1046
01:21:10,488 --> 01:21:14,248
Jeremy. Stop! It is over

1047
01:21:14,248 --> 01:21:17,760
Stop what? What's over?
What the fuck is this?

1048
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,888
It was merely and exercise
and you pass, Jeremy

1049
01:21:20,888 --> 01:21:22,288
You pass with flying colours

1050
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,678
I don't understand

1051
01:21:26,535 --> 01:21:27,935
Stay back

1052
01:21:28,588 --> 01:21:31,846
I didn't transfer to
recruitment last year

1053
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:36,971
I'm the protection detail training
coordinator, and you're in Towns ville

1054
01:21:38,229 --> 01:21:40,353
This is AOP training ground

1055
01:21:55,263 --> 01:21:56,383
You did all this?

1056
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:01,666
You set all this up? Why?

1057
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:04,522
Yeah, we have done a lot of
stress tests since 9/11

1058
01:22:04,522 --> 01:22:07,313
It sure beat a hell out of
polygraph don't you think?

1059
01:22:07,313 --> 01:22:09,033
and it was important, Jeremy

1060
01:22:09,033 --> 01:22:12,485
It was crucial for your transfer
to the presidential detail

1061
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:16,048
starting next month
you're on the asian trip

1062
01:22:17,146 --> 01:22:20,086
Congratulations, you're on
your way to the show

1063
01:22:21,647 --> 01:22:24,085
- Keep it up, Agent Raines
- Nice work, man

1064
01:22:24,618 --> 01:22:25,738
Congratulations

1065
01:22:26,306 --> 01:22:28,126
- Nice job
- Awesome

1066
01:22:31,424 --> 01:22:33,617
911, what is your emergency?

1067
01:22:33,617 --> 01:22:36,563
My outer ego, great great
work Agent Raines

1068
01:22:37,467 --> 01:22:41,622
Heading the I-95
Agent Danielle Wade, retired

1069
01:22:41,622 --> 01:22:42,742
Great job

1070
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:52,049
I had to, you can know my inner
actress in my high school drama dates

1071
01:22:53,288 --> 01:22:56,660
We told her about the
importance of this exercise,

1072
01:22:56,661 --> 01:22:58,577
and Molly agreed to help us

1073
01:23:01,179 --> 01:23:03,523
- I'm so sorry
- No

1074
01:23:04,461 --> 01:23:07,221
This guy has lost a lot of blood,
we got to get this leg patch up

1075
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:10,727
Sorry about that hot weld ammunition

1076
01:23:10,727 --> 01:23:13,350
We probably made it way too much

1077
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:15,375
We visit that in the next exercise

1078
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:18,244
Yeah, that'll be a good idea

1079
01:23:19,787 --> 01:23:21,862
Meet you at the hospital
for debriefing

1080
01:23:22,519 --> 01:23:23,639
Hey Ben

1081
01:23:26,211 --> 01:23:28,311
You really had me man

1082
01:23:29,878 --> 01:23:30,998
Yeah

1083
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:34,253
That was the idea

1084
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:37,497
Alright, ladies and gentlemen.

1085
01:23:37,498 --> 01:23:39,549
Great job, let wrap
it up and go home

1086
01:23:43,524 --> 01:23:46,282
Give us the location of Roulette

1087
01:23:57,612 --> 01:24:01,971
Hey. Hey, hey, it's okay. I'm here

1088
01:24:03,645 --> 01:24:04,985
- Where am I?
- Better be careful

1089
01:24:04,985 --> 01:24:08,018
you going to wreck this
thing out of your arm

1090
01:24:08,018 --> 01:24:09,723
You're in an ambulance

1091
01:24:10,564 --> 01:24:14,686
You pass out, they gave you
a sedative and a new IV

1092
01:24:14,686 --> 01:24:16,640
- Hi
- Hi

1093
01:24:20,093 --> 01:24:24,003
- How long have I been out?
- About half an hour

1094
01:24:24,003 --> 01:24:26,346
We pull out into Walter
Reed in about 15 minutes

1095
01:24:26,346 --> 01:24:27,800
Thank you

1096
01:24:30,433 --> 01:24:32,774
How did they get
you involve in all of this?

1097
01:24:33,804 --> 01:24:35,624
They paid me

1098
01:24:36,244 --> 01:24:39,364
I mean I'm not taking it to
the cleaner or anything, but

1099
01:24:40,217 --> 01:24:42,218
I got what we needed

1100
01:24:44,565 --> 01:24:47,703
- I paid off Morgan
- Really?

1101
01:24:47,703 --> 01:24:50,934
Yeah. Clean slate

1102
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:53,069
You're done with him

1103
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:58,208
You know what? I didn't make
a bet since south Green Park

1104
01:24:58,208 --> 01:25:01,641
I know, I know

1105
01:25:01,641 --> 01:25:04,231
The bastard said he
lost his best client

1106
01:25:04,231 --> 01:25:06,999
Has anybody else knows?

1107
01:25:06,999 --> 01:25:08,865
Just Ben and his team

1108
01:25:08,865 --> 01:25:10,391
and he knows you're done with it too

1109
01:25:10,391 --> 01:25:13,140
He's the on that clear

1110
01:25:14,184 --> 01:25:18,343
that ain't better half
of crazy son-of-bitch

1111
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:22,013
What happen is extremely awful huh?

1112
01:25:22,013 --> 01:25:23,133
Yeah

1113
01:25:24,029 --> 01:25:25,780
Well that's Ben for you

1114
01:25:26,513 --> 01:25:30,211
Well at least you get
the rest of the day off

1115
01:25:30,212 --> 01:25:32,945
and it's beautiful outside, look

1116
01:25:40,918 --> 01:25:45,855
- What's so funny?
- ... Nothing

1117
01:25:51,724 --> 01:25:53,444
Really?

1118
01:25:53,444 --> 01:25:56,908
The Washington Monument that's it?
That's where it is?

1119
01:25:58,131 --> 01:25:59,951
It's not important now

1120
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:03,549
Wait

1121
01:26:20,367 --> 01:26:22,187
Will you marry me?

1122
01:26:23,464 --> 01:26:24,864
We are married

1123
01:26:27,226 --> 01:26:29,046
Marry me again

1124
01:26:30,087 --> 01:26:32,267
I've just got a big ass promotion

1125
01:26:42,398 --> 01:26:43,798
What are you doing?

1126
01:26:49,745 --> 01:26:54,400
What the fuck is this?
What's this for? What're you doing?

1127
01:26:55,814 --> 01:26:57,791

01:26:58,744 --> 01:27:00,844
Washington Monument.

01:27:12,198 --> 01:27:13,107
Where do you want us?

1133
01:27:13,107 --> 01:27:15,669
Abort plan C and dismantle the ER

1134
01:27:15,669 --> 01:27:18,643
Operation can commence on schedule

1135
01:27:19,631 --> 01:27:21,526

1136
01:27:21,526 --> 01:27:23,664

- What the fuck are you doing?
- Copy that

1138

I trusted you, what are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

1139
01:27:29,725 --> 01:27:31,652
What the hell is that?
