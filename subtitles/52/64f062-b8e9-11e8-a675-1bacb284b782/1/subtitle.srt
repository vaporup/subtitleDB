1
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:25,255
Young man, do you have the time?
I got six clocks, and none of them work.

2
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,509
- Twenty after nine.
- After?

3
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:32,012
It's twenty after, dear. Darlin'?

4
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:37,142
- Five minutes. What about you?
- I'm all set. I just ironed my sling.

5
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:42,147
- The lawyer said 9.30 sharp, darlin'.
- OK.

6
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:46,735
I hope you're not the miserly kind.
It's brand-new.

7
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,863
She ought to get a very good price for it.

8
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:52,699
Is that the right mileage? 23 miles?

9
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:56,119
We only took two rides in it.
It's the darn men.

10
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:59,039
They run into her
just to start a conversation.

11
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:01,833
- Will you come up, Iz?
- Sure, dear.

12
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,419
Don't go by appearances. It's brand-new.

13
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,339
It was a divorce present
from her husband.

14
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:10,300
- They givin' presents for divorces now?
- Why not?

15
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:14,012
On the anniversary of our divorce,
my husband always sends me...

16
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:18,808
.. one potted yellow rose,
and it'll be 19 years in July.

17
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:22,437
Course, he never did pay me the alimony.

18
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:26,816
But I wouldn't wanna put a man out,
you know, if his heart's not in it.

19
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:29,402
You break your arm in the car?

20
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:35,950
No. My last roomer, the one before Mrs
Taber, we celebrated her divorce and...

21
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:39,662
.. I misbehaved.

22
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:42,874
I'm so sick and tired of myself.

23
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,769
- Will you go over my answers again?
- Sure, dear.

24
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:05,897
But don't worry, you'll do wonderfully.

25
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:09,984
Let's see. "Did your husband,
Mr Raymond Taber,...

26
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,570
.. act toward you with cruelty?"

27
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,448
Darlin'?

28
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:18,367
- Well, yes.
- Just say yes.

29
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:19,994
Yes.

30
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,956
"In what way did this cruelty
manifest itself?"

31
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,632
He persistently... How does that go again?

32
00:05:33,257 --> 00:05:37,386
"He persistently and cruelly ignored
my personal wishes and my rights,...

33
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:42,391
.. and resorted on several occasions
to physical violence against me. "

34
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,935
He persistently...

35
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:49,482
Oh, do I have to say that?

36
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:57,531
Why can't I just say he wasn't there? He...
You could touch him, but he wasn't there.

37
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,992
If that was grounds for divorce,...

38
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:05,206
.. there'd only be about 11 marriages
left in the US. Now just repeat after me.

39
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:09,251
- "He persistently...
- He persistently...

40
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,381
They'll call in their estimate, ma'am.

41
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:17,593
Those dents aren't my fault, you know.

42
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,764
I'll recommend
the best price I can, ma'am.

43
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:24,767
You can drive her now.
I've put in a new battery.

44
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:28,020
I'll never drive that car again.
Let's take a taxi.

45
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:31,356
I... I'll give you a lift
if you're leaving right away.

46
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:33,525
Swell. Two minutes.

47
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,612
Iz, get dressed! You gotta be my witness.

48
00:06:36,737 --> 00:06:41,533
This'll be my 77th time
I've witnessed for a divorce.

49
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:44,286
Two sevens - that's lucky, darlin'!

50
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:47,831
Oh, Iz, I hope.

51
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:03,847
- Easy does it, now.
- Oh, you're a dear.

52
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:07,100
- Here we are.
- Thanks a lot. We've gotta go now.

53
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:11,646
If you're not goin' back East right away,
I'd be glad to show you the county.

54
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:14,691
Beautiful country around here, you know.

55
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:18,069
Well, I don't know where I'll be, but OK.
Thanks again.

56
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:20,947
My name is Isabelle Steers.

57
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:24,117
Isabelle. Well, OK, you come along too.

58
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:28,830
That's a sweet afterthought!
You Reno men!

59
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,211
I can't memorise this.
It's not the way it was.

60
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:40,258
Just say it. It doesn't have to be true.
This isn't a quiz show, it's only a court.

61
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:51,811
- I just got off the plane...
- I don't wanna hear anything.

62
00:07:51,936 --> 00:07:54,939
Just give me five minutes.
After two years, five minutes...

63
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:57,525
You can't have me now,
so you want me, that's all.

64
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,531
Please, I'm not blaming you. It's... I just
don't believe in the whole thing any more.

65
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:06,242
Kid, I understand. I understand...

66
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:09,621
You don't understand.
You're not there, Raymond.

67
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:12,665
If I'm gonna be alone,
I wanna be by myself.

68
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:17,295
Go back. You're not gonna make me
feel sorry for you any more.

69
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:33,144
Gay!

70
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,063
Wait up! I was just goin' over to see ya!

71
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:41,485
Well, good luck now, Susan.
I won't forget you, you can be sure of that.

72
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:46,616
- I don't even know where to write you.
- General delivery. I'll get it.

73
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:50,494
Will you think about it? It's the
second-largest laundry in St Louis.

74
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:53,664
I wouldn't wanna kid you.
I ain't cut out for business.

75
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:56,751
Well, will you think of me? Oh, Gay...

76
00:08:56,876 --> 00:09:00,421
Oh, you know I will, honey. Goodbye.

77
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:05,426
Bye.

78
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,233
How're you doin', boy?
Ready to cut out of this town? Cos I am.

79
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:24,028
Well, I've been thinkin' about it.

80
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:28,490
- Which one was that?
- Susan. Swell sport, that woman.

81
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:34,621
I just met me a girl sweet enough to eat,
Gay. Fine-lookin' woman.

82
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:38,834
But when I think of all the useless talkin'
you gotta do, I get discouraged.

83
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,380
I tell you, I'm dyin' for some fresh air.
And no people, male or female.

84
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:47,926
Why don't we take out to the mountains?
We could even do a little mustangin'.

85
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:50,679
I wanted to pile up about 500 this time.

86
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:53,765
- I need a new engine.
- That engine'll fly you anywhere.

87
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:57,060
Say, you've been two months on this job.
You'll get the habit.

88
00:09:57,185 --> 00:10:01,231
I'll see you over at Harrah's later.
Let's talk about it.

89
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:06,486
Tom Dooley.

90
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:28,133
If you throw in your ring
you'll never get another divorce.

91
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:30,468
Go ahead, honey. Everybody does it.

92
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:34,848
More gold in that river
than there is in the Klondike.

93
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:43,690
- Did you do that?
- Who, me? No.

94
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:46,735
I lost my ring on my honeymoon.

95
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:51,114
- Let's get a drink.
- That's my girl.

96
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:01,416
Wait a minute, honey.
This machine loves me.

97
00:11:08,423 --> 00:11:10,925
Never say die.

98
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,778
Scotch, I guess, on i... Yeah, on ice.

99
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:33,865
- Rye and water.
- Scotch on ice, rye and water.

100
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:37,201
Well, cheer up.

101
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:40,079
I will. I just hate to fight with anybody.

102
00:11:40,204 --> 00:11:43,499
When you win, you lose.
You know, in your heart.

103
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:48,212
Well, you're free. Maybe the trouble is
you're not used to it yet.

104
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:52,341
No, the trouble is I always
end up back where I started.

105
00:11:52,466 --> 00:11:55,970
Never had anybody much. And here I am.

106
00:11:56,762 --> 00:11:59,974
Well, you had your mother, didn't you?

107
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:06,147
How do you have somebody
who disappears all the time?

108
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:11,694
They both weren't there. She'd go off
with a patient for three months and...

109
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:15,614
You know how long
three months is to a kid.

110
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,202
Listen, don't leave. Settle here.

111
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:25,207
They got a school.
You could teach dancing.

112
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:30,421
One thing about this town,
it's always full of interesting strangers.

113
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:35,884
Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say? I...

114
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:42,683
I suddenly miss my mother.
Oh, isn't that the stupidest thing?

115
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:51,900
Iz, you're a fine woman. Practically the
only woman that's ever been my friend.

116
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:54,319
Well, drink up then.

117
00:12:57,364 --> 00:13:01,994
Oh, isn't that the dearest dog?
Look how sweet he sits there.

118
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:05,122
Yeah. Dogs are nice.

119
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:07,541
Here. Puppy.

120
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:18,635
Hey, Dooley.

121
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,143
Hello. How'd you make out?

122
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:29,521
OK.

123
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:33,400
I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine. Gay...

124
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:36,486
Gay Langland, Mrs Taber.

125
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,828
- Howdy do?
- And this is Mrs, uh...?

126
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:50,625
Steers. Isabelle Steers. One thing about
Reno men, they do remember the name.

127
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:56,131
- Why don't you boys sit down?
- Thank you. What're you girls drinkin'?

128
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:59,843
Whiskey. We're celebratin'
the jail burned down.

129
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:02,846
Mary, see if you can get
four doubles, will you?

130
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:13,022
Uh... you sure made a big impression
on my friend here. And I can see why.

131
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:16,818
- You a mechanic too?
- Him? He's a cowboy.

132
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:20,113
- How'd you know?
- I can smell, can't I?

133
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:25,243
- Hey, you can't smell cows on me.
- I smell the look on your face, cowboy.

134
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:28,538
But I love every miserable one of ya.

135
00:14:28,663 --> 00:14:31,374
Course, you're all good for nothin',
as you know.

136
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:34,585
That may be. But it's better than wages.

137
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,797
I suppose you'll be headin'
back East soon, Mrs Taber?

138
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:40,800
I can't make up my mind.
I don't know yet what to do.

139
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:43,928
You don't have a business to run,
or a school to teach, or...?

140
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:46,764
Me? I never finished high school.

141
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:49,475
Well! That's real good news.

142
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:53,229
- You don't like educated women?
- They're all right.

143
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:56,691
Always wantin' to know
what you're thinkin', that's all.

144
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:58,859
Maybe they want to get to know you.

145
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:03,614
Did you ever get to know a man better
by askin' him questions?

146
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:07,243
- You mean he'd lie?
- Well, he might not.

147
00:15:07,368 --> 00:15:09,954
And then again, he just might.

148
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:14,458
How about it, Pilot?
We takin' off today?

149
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,294
You ever been outside Reno, Mrs Taber?

150
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:20,881
I walked to the edge of town.
Doesn't look like much is out there.

151
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:23,092
Everything's there.

152
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:25,970
- Like what?
- The country.

153
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:30,057
- Well, what do you do with yourself?
- Just live.

154
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:34,395
- How do you just live?
- Well, you start by goin' to sleep.

155
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,440
You get up when you feel like it.
You scratch yourself. You fry some eggs.

156
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:43,654
You see what kind of a day it is.
You throw stones at a can and whistle.

157
00:15:45,114 --> 00:15:47,116
I know what you mean.

158
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:50,494
I have an empty house in the country
just beyond Hawleyville.

159
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:54,832
It's all yours if you want some
peace and quiet before you go back.

160
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:57,334
The last woman's gone?

161
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:00,796
No kiddin'. I never offered it before.

162
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:06,635
Well, I wouldn't stay there. But let's rent
a car. We could look at the country.

163
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,430
- Gay has a truck. You can have my car.
- Then you'll have to drive me back.

164
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:15,227
- I don't mind.
- Thanks, but I like to feel I'm on my own.

165
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:18,563
- I'll rent a car. Where can I?
- Right now?

166
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:22,943
- Why not?
- OK. You sure don't waste time, do you?

167
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:26,822
I just gotta stop by the garage and quit.

168
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:29,366
Hey, now, that's the boy.

169
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:33,578
No, Gay. This is mine.

170
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,638
Mm. What is that beautiful smell?
Smells like green perfume.

171
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:54,516
- That's sage, darlin'.
- Oh, sure!

172
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:58,812
I never smelled it except in bottles.
Gee, it's beautiful here.

173
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:04,109
Look, dear girl, I think I better
tell you somethin' about cowboys.

174
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:08,613
- You really worry about me, don't you?
- Well, you're too believin'.

175
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:11,157
Cowboys are the last real men left,...

176
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:15,078
.. and they're about as reliable
as jack rabbits.

177
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:17,497
Is anybody any different?

178
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:21,960
Maybe you're not supposed to believe
people. Maybe it's not even fair to them.

179
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:30,009
I couldn't hear what he said to her, but
it looked like she left him. The husband.

180
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:33,471
She's kinda hard to figure out, you know?

181
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:38,309
One minute she looks kinda dumb
and brand-new, like a kid,...

182
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:41,104
.. and the next minute...

183
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:45,942
- She sure moves, though, don't she?
- Mm. She's real prime.

184
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:14,845
- It isn't finished yet.
- It's weathertight. Come on in.

185
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,306
It's insulated.

186
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,394
Flush doors.

187
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,190
This is the living room.

188
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:29,818
And this was gonna be another bedroom.

189
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:34,615
It's even nicer this way.

190
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,494
Here's a picture window.
Take a look at this view.

191
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:49,671
- Take a look at that.
- Gee. It goes on for ever.

192
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,427
Fireplace.

193
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,847
- Brick.
- This is the kitchen.

194
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,809
- Gas refrigerator.
- It's nice.

195
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:05,062
And here's the bathroom. Ceramic tile.

196
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,318
Here's our... This was our bedroom.

197
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:16,281
My wife. She died here.

198
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,161
I'm... sorry.

199
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:27,417
She was due to have a baby. I was up
setting the capstone on the chimney...

200
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,837
.. and she screamed...

201
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:34,007
.. and that was that.

202
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,805
Couldn't you call a doctor?

203
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:46,019
She didn't seem to be that sick.
Then I got a flat. I didn't have a spare.

204
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:50,398
Everything just happened wrong.
It'll do that sometimes.

205
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,735
Yeah, I know.

206
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,155
Uh, you couldn't live here any more, huh?

207
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:01,034
We knew each other
since we were seven years old, see?

208
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,537
You ought to find yourself another girl.

209
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:09,626
I don't know. Me with anybody else,
it seems impossible, you know?

210
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,629
She wasn't like any other women.

211
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:17,091
Stood behind me 100 per cent,
uncomplaining as a tree.

212
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,887
Maybe that's what killed her.

213
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:25,016
I mean, a little complaining
helps sometimes maybe.

214
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,144
Hey, Iz, isn't this a beautiful place here?

215
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:32,899
Yeah. It'd be just perfect if somebody'd
bring in that bottle of whiskey I bought.

216
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,318
- With my own money.
- Hey, that's right!

217
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,988
And bring that bag of groceries.
Maybe somebody wants a sandwich.

218
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:43,743
The glasses are in the kitchen, Isabelle.
I'm real tired.

219
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,079
No, you're just a cowboy, darlin'.

220
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:50,166
You fellas won't move
unless it's rainin' down your necks.

221
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,380
Too rough for you, Roslyn?

222
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,383
I don't mind that.

223
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:04,138
You should've seen his wife. She helped
pour cement and knocked in nails.

224
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,933
She was a real good sport.

225
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,020
Now she's dead because
he didn't have a spare tyre.

226
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,773
Well, that's the way it goes.

227
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:17,735
It goes the other way too, though.
Don't forget that.

228
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,155
It's sure nice to see people in here.
Come on, let's have a drink.

229
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,535
- I'll start the fridge. It makes ice quick.
- Ice? We gonna stay that long, Roslyn?

230
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,789
- I don't know.
- Oh, sure. Come on.

231
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:35,002
There's no better place to be. And you
couldn't find better company, either.

232
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,713
- All right.
- That's it, sport.

233
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,675
Turn on that ice, Guido. Let's get this stuff
a-flowin', make the desert bloom.

234
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,178
Well, flow it slow. We only got one bottle.

235
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,890
There. Put that in your thoughts
and see how they come out.

236
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:52,269
Come on, sit down, everybody.
Let's get comfortable.

237
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,944
- I'm sure glad you like this place.
- Here's to Nevada, the "leave it" state.

238
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,322
- The what state?
- The "leave it" state.

239
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,033
You got money to gamble, leave it here.

240
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,702
A wife you wanna get rid of,
get rid of her here.

241
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:13,373
Extra atom bomb you don't need, blow it
up here. Nobody will mind in the slightest.

242
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:18,170
The slogan of Nevada is "Anything goes,
but don't complain if it went. "

243
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,716
- That's no lie.
- I even left my Southern accent here.

244
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:27,638
How come you never went back home?
You came here for a divorce, didn't you?

245
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,640
- I wasn't beautiful enough to go back.
- Oh, Isabelle.

246
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:36,480
No, that's true. Beauty's a help any place,
but in Virginia it's a necessity.

247
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,524
Why, you can't hardly
get a driver's licence without it.

248
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:44,529
No, I love Nevada. You know, they don't
even have regular meal times here.

249
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,532
Never met so many people
didn't own a watch.

250
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:52,412
Might have two wives at the same time,
but no watch. Bless them all.

251
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,956
How quiet it is here.

252
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:57,459
Sweetest sound there is.

253
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:02,839
There's an Indian store about five miles,
if you wanna shop. Groceries, everything.

254
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,342
If you wanna stay, that is.

255
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:09,012
Be glad to come by
and do your chores, if you like.

256
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:14,392
You know, he reminds me of that
cowboy friend I told you about.

257
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:17,812
Had one arm gone, but he was
more man with one arm...

258
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:20,231
.. than any other man is with two.

259
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:21,774
Oh?

260
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,236
- I mean like cookin'.
- Oh!

261
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:28,823
No, I'm serious. He could take
a panful of chops, toss 'em,...

262
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:31,242
.. and they all came down
on the other side.

263
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:36,331
- Who is he? Maybe they know him.
- Darlin', you can't go lookin' for a man.

264
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,709
- What, did he take off?
- No, not exactly.

265
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:43,338
He just never came back.

266
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:49,677
- Andy Powell. You ever...?
- Sure! Called Andy Gump sometimes?

267
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:51,846
That's him.

268
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:55,558
- You know where he is?
- Saw him at the rodeo only last month.

269
00:23:55,683 --> 00:24:00,646
- Maybe we could find him.
- Stop thinkin' you can change things.

270
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:03,608
But if there's something you can do...

271
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:07,236
I don't know what to do,
but if I knew, I'd do it.

272
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:12,450
Have you got a radio or a phonograph?
Maybe we'll have some music.

273
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:16,078
- There's no electricity.
- The car radio.

274
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:20,750
- Now who'd have thought of that?
- You always get an idea, don't you?

275
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,210
I'll go bring the car round.

276
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:28,549
Say, how about another drink
to keep that first one warm?

277
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:32,344
- I'd love it.
- I'm gonna make myself a sandwich.

278
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,097
- How about you folks?
- OK.

279
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:39,351
I hope you're gonna stay on here.
Any chance?

280
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:41,770
Why? What difference would it make?

281
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:45,524
Might make all the difference in the world
as time goes by.

282
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:50,738
- Like to dance?
- OK.

283
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:07,087
Thanks. Iz, give him another drink.
It's a wonderful house, Guido.

284
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:10,090
Hey, that's pretty good dancin', cowboy.

285
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:12,718
What are you doin'?

286
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:16,722
She used to teach dancin'.
You know? Before she was married.

287
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:20,392
- No kiddin'? In a dance hall?
- Uh-huh.

288
00:25:22,436 --> 00:25:25,564
How about the landlord?
Move over, boy, huh?

289
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:29,901
- Watch out for those pretty little feet.
- She knows how to get out of the way.

290
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:32,070
Let's go.

291
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:53,049
Where'd you learn that, Pilot?

292
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:57,053
I never knew him to dance at all.

293
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:04,894
Look at old Pilot comin' out
from under a bushel!

294
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:11,318
Hey, you two ought to put on a show!

295
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:44,183
Come on, honey. This is a good one.
I haven't danced like this in years.

296
00:26:47,478 --> 00:26:52,859
- Didn't your wife dance?
- Not like you. She had no gracefulness.

297
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:55,862
Why didn't you teach her to be graceful?

298
00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:58,614
You can't learn that.

299
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,493
How do you know?
I mean, how do you know?

300
00:27:02,618 --> 00:27:06,831
You see, she died, and she didn't
know how you can dance.

301
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:10,710
To a certain extent,
maybe you were strangers.

302
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:15,548
- I don't feel like discussing my wife.
- Don't be mad.

303
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:19,385
I only meant that if you loved her
you could've taught her anything.

304
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:23,264
Because... we're all dying, aren't we?

305
00:27:24,348 --> 00:27:28,352
All the husbands and all the wives.
Every minute.

306
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:33,566
And we're not teaching each other
what we really know, are we?

307
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,193
Dum da-da... dum...

308
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:38,904
Guido, you're a nice man.

309
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:43,117
Smile.

310
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:47,121
Come on.

311
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:25,033
- Come on, Iz.
- I'm lookin' for your shoes, dear girl.

312
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:28,287
Watch out. There's no step!

313
00:29:24,718 --> 00:29:27,178
We better get you home, girl.

314
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:32,058
You were worried about me. How sweet.

315
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:36,187
Just wanna keep you
all in one pretty piece.

316
00:29:37,188 --> 00:29:39,566
Would you have had a spare tyre?

317
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:42,402
Somebody'd better drive her.

318
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:48,658
Go ahead. I'll take the truck.

319
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:51,661
Oh, Iz, don't leave poor Guido alone.

320
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:54,872
Tom Dooley!

321
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:33,035
You're a real beautiful woman.

322
00:30:36,414 --> 00:30:39,875
It's almost kind of an honour
sittin' next to you.

323
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,713
You just shine in my eyes.
That's my true feelin', Roslyn.

324
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:54,974
What makes you so sad? I think
you're the saddest girl I ever met.

325
00:30:56,058 --> 00:31:01,480
You're the first man that ever said that.
I'm usually told how happy I am.

326
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:05,150
That's because you make
a man feel happy.

327
00:31:07,611 --> 00:31:10,572
I don't feel that way about you, Gay.

328
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:19,289
Well, don't get discouraged, girl.
You might.

329
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:26,171
Look, why don't you try it out here
for a while, see what happens?

330
00:31:26,296 --> 00:31:29,341
You know, sometimes when
a person don't know what to do,...

331
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:32,970
.. the best thing is to just stand still.

332
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:39,893
I'll guarantee you'll have something out
here you wouldn't find on every corner.

333
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:46,149
I, uh... I may not amount to much
in some ways, but I am a good friend.

334
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:51,113
Thanks.

335
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:58,954
Let me take you back and get your things.
Try it for a while, see what happens.

336
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:02,958
Ever hear the story
about the city man out in the country?

337
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:07,420
He sees this fella sittin' on his porch,
so he says "Mister,...

338
00:32:07,546 --> 00:32:12,676
.. could you tell me how I can get back
to town?" The fella says "No. "

339
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:18,139
"Well, could you tell me how to get
to the post office?" The fella says "No. "

340
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:22,477
"Well, do you know how to get
to the railroad station?" "No. "

341
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:25,939
"Boy," he says, "you sure
don't know much, do you?"

342
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:28,900
The fella says "Nope. But I ain't lost. "

343
00:32:37,617 --> 00:32:39,953
Don't you have a home?

344
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,666
Sure. Never was a better one, either.

345
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,877
Where is it?

346
00:32:49,337 --> 00:32:51,381
Right here.

347
00:33:47,728 --> 00:33:50,898
Come on. I got a surprise for you.

348
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:19,551
You cooked breakfast. Here, let me.

349
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:24,139
No, no, no. You sit down
and enjoy yourself. Just this once.

350
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:28,602
- You do this often?
- Uh-uh. First time for me.

351
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,689
- Really and truly?
- Mm-hm.

352
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:35,984
Mm. Smells delicious.

353
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:43,909
Hey, you really go all out, don't you?

354
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:48,789
Even the way you eat. I like that.
Women generally pick.

355
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:50,957
You like me, huh?

356
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:58,131
Birds must be brave to live out here.
At night especially.

357
00:34:58,256 --> 00:35:01,551
- Whereas they're so small, you know?
- Mm-hm.

358
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:07,933
- You think I'm crazy.
- I look that way cos I can't make you out.

359
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:10,852
- Why?
- I don't know.

360
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:13,605
You got children?

361
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:17,525
- I never wanted children with him.
- Oh.

362
00:35:19,694 --> 00:35:24,783
Children are supposed to bring you
together. But what if they don't?

363
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,664
I've known of so-called
happily married couples.

364
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:35,543
One time, the wife was in the hospital
to have the baby...

365
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:38,588
.. and the husband was calling me up.

366
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:40,799
I mean, he was calling me.

367
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:46,095
They're still supposed
to be happily married.

368
00:35:46,221 --> 00:35:48,848
I guess you believe in true love,
don't you?

369
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:52,727
I don't know, but they ought to invent
a way that you don't have children...

370
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:56,272
.. unless you care for each other,
cos kids know the difference.

371
00:35:56,397 --> 00:35:58,608
I always knew the difference.

372
00:35:58,733 --> 00:36:02,820
Listen, if you wanna go somewhere,
I don't mind being alone.

373
00:36:02,945 --> 00:36:08,659
- Do I look like I wanna leave?
- I just want you to do what you feel like.

374
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:14,123
You ain't kiddin'. Even when
you're kiddin', you ain't kiddin'.

375
00:36:14,248 --> 00:36:16,793
No. It makes me feel peaceful.

376
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:22,006
You know, they come out here
from New York, Chicago, St Louis,...

377
00:36:22,131 --> 00:36:25,885
.. and find them a cowboy. Cowboys
are supposed to be dumb, you know.

378
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,930
So they tell 'em everything.
And they do everything.

379
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:31,933
Everything they couldn't do back home.

380
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:34,435
- It's pitiful.
- Why is it pitiful?

381
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,940
Cowboy's laughin' at 'em,
and they don't even know it.

382
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:43,152
It's nice to meet someone
who has respect for a man.

383
00:36:43,277 --> 00:36:46,072
Did you ever think
of getting married again?

384
00:36:46,197 --> 00:36:51,202
Yeah. I've thought about it a lot of times.
But never in daylight.

385
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:57,333
- You get lonesome for your children?
- Oh, I see 'em now and then.

386
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:02,004
They come whenever I'm in a rodeo.
I'm a pretty good roper.

387
00:37:05,132 --> 00:37:07,843
I get lonesome, sure.

388
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:13,474
My daughter is almost your size.
Uh... You size 12?

389
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,060
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. So is she.

390
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:19,688
I bought her a dress for Christmas.
Size 12.

391
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:26,779
What happened?
Did you just stop loving your wife, Gay?

392
00:37:26,904 --> 00:37:31,700
Well, I come home one night and
she's all wrapped up in a car with a fella.

393
00:37:31,825 --> 00:37:36,205
Turned out to be an old friend.
A cousin of mine, as a matter of fact.

394
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,208
Oh. You never had any idea, huh?

395
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:44,087
No. You know, in those days
I thought you got married and that was it.

396
00:37:44,213 --> 00:37:47,090
But nothin' is it. Not for ever.

397
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:52,763
That's what I can't get used to.
Everything keeps changing.

398
00:37:55,265 --> 00:38:01,021
I'll tell you this, though. I wouldn't know
how to say goodbye to you, Roslyn.

399
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,067
It surprises me.

400
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:13,992
There's a lot to be done around this place.
If we were gonna stay awhile.

401
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:16,995
Let's go out in the sunshine. Come on.

402
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:28,506
Let's just live like you said in the bar.
I don't know where I am yet.

403
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:33,887
Hey! Couldn't we use that for a step?

404
00:38:35,305 --> 00:38:37,807
Well, we just might at that.

405
00:38:52,322 --> 00:38:55,325
- There you are.
- Let me try it.

406
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,204
It's perfect. I can go in...
and I can come out.

407
00:39:00,663 --> 00:39:03,750
Go in... and I can come out.

408
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,378
Go in...

409
00:39:07,503 --> 00:39:09,756
.. and I can come out.

410
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,633
I can go in...

411
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:15,053
.. and I can come out.

412
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,822
Guido!

413
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:21,702
- What's he doing?
- Might land. There's a place back there.

414
00:40:26,832 --> 00:40:30,002
Nah. I guess he's just sayin' hello.

415
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,380
- Here, have some lemonade.
- Oh, thanks.

416
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,968
- What does he do? Just fly around?
- Could be goin' for eagles.

417
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:40,554
Now and again ranchers
hire Guido to shoot eagles.

418
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:44,099
- Why?
- Well, they kill a lot of lambs.

419
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:46,768
He gets $50 a bird.

420
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:51,148
I never really saw anything grow before.

421
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:57,362
How tiny those seeds were. And yet they
know they're supposed to be lettuces.

422
00:40:57,487 --> 00:41:01,241
You say the darnedest things.
You know that, don't you?

423
00:41:01,366 --> 00:41:05,120
Everybody's busy in Chicago,
and here we are.

424
00:41:06,496 --> 00:41:08,707
I love this whole state!

425
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,546
Hey... What have we here now?

426
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,509
Well... Just plain old rabbit!

427
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:23,513
I'm gonna get him.

428
00:41:23,638 --> 00:41:26,474
It's just one lettuce.
Maybe he won't do it any more.

429
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,771
No, ma'am! It's them or us! There won't
be a thing left inside of a week.

430
00:41:31,896 --> 00:41:35,734
Couldn't you wait and see?
I can't stand to see anything killed.

431
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:40,322
- Honey, it's only a rabbit.
- But it doesn't know any better, does it?

432
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:42,657
Go on inside and let me handle this.

433
00:41:42,782 --> 00:41:45,535
- I know you worked hard...
- You're darn right!

434
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,414
And I didn't do it
for some bug-eyed rabbit.

435
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:53,042
- Gay, please.
- Honey, will you go on inside now?

436
00:41:53,168 --> 00:41:56,796
- And stop bein' silly?
- I'm not being silly.

437
00:41:56,921 --> 00:41:59,215
You don't respect what I feel.

438
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,510
- And I don't care about the lettuce!
- I care about it!

439
00:42:02,635 --> 00:42:05,638
And how about havin'
some respect for me?

440
00:42:06,598 --> 00:42:08,850
Oh, Guido and Isabelle!

441
00:42:08,975 --> 00:42:11,019
- Guido!
- Dear girl!

442
00:42:11,144 --> 00:42:14,814
I thought I saw a passenger!
We never heard you land.

443
00:42:14,939 --> 00:42:19,193
- My, you look thrivin'.
- Boy, am I in the right place?

444
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:22,989
Seen the vegetable garden?
Took Gay a week just to turn the soil.

445
00:42:23,114 --> 00:42:25,533
Mowed the grass
and put in them flowers too.

446
00:42:25,658 --> 00:42:28,619
I got your windows unstuck.
Fireplace don't smoke now.

447
00:42:28,745 --> 00:42:34,167
You must be a magician. All he ever did
for a woman was get out the ice cubes.

448
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:37,628
- Look, we have chairs. Come and sit.
- Let's show him the inside.

449
00:42:37,753 --> 00:42:42,633
You know, I've moved this furniture
so many times, I'm gettin' long ears!

450
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:47,471
My, you look lovely. You've really
found yourself, haven't you?

451
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:51,976
Well, I... Oh, it's so nice to see you,
Isabelle. Look, we have a step.

452
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:55,730
- How's your arm?
- Well, it's still as weak as a bird's wing.

453
00:42:56,647 --> 00:43:01,277
Well, I never saw anything like it
in my life. It's magical.

454
00:43:01,402 --> 00:43:05,197
Just hope you realise you finally
made contact with a real woman.

455
00:43:05,322 --> 00:43:07,450
My dear girl!

456
00:43:07,575 --> 00:43:12,830
Come, Guido. I wanna show you the rest.
I've changed a few things, though.

457
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,334
We've changed things around.

458
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:21,213
How do you like it?

459
00:43:21,797 --> 00:43:25,551
Oh, don't look at those.
Gay just hung 'em up for a joke.

460
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:28,679
I put your picture up in the living room.

461
00:43:30,055 --> 00:43:33,392
Come on, let's have lots of drinks.
Come on.

462
00:43:37,104 --> 00:43:39,606
Oh, it's so nice to have company.

463
00:43:45,112 --> 00:43:49,616
- I put your picture there. Is that all right?
- You don't have to keep it out.

464
00:43:49,741 --> 00:43:54,079
Why, Guido, it's part of the house.
Besides, it's your house.

465
00:43:54,204 --> 00:43:57,457
Oh, sit in the big chair.
This must've been your chair.

466
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,668
Matter of fact, it was.

467
00:43:59,793 --> 00:44:02,588
Isabelle. Put this under your arm.

468
00:44:02,713 --> 00:44:04,756
Thanks, dear girl.

469
00:44:05,882 --> 00:44:09,845
I used to do all my studyin' in this chair.
When I was still ambitious.

470
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,805
What did you study?

471
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:15,100
I was on my way to bein' a doctor.
Before the war.

472
00:44:15,225 --> 00:44:18,895
Well, you never can tell.
Maybe you'll get ambitious again.

473
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,898
I'm gonna tell you somethin', Roslyn.

474
00:44:22,023 --> 00:44:26,862
I spent four years in the war.
Did two tours, flew 50 missions.

475
00:44:27,362 --> 00:44:31,449
Every time I came back to base
I started to design this house.

476
00:44:31,575 --> 00:44:35,412
But somehow I could never
get it to look like my idea of it.

477
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:38,456
Now it almost does.

478
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:41,334
You just walk in,
a stranger out of nowhere,...

479
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:44,546
.. and for the first time it all lights up.

480
00:44:45,797 --> 00:44:48,299
And I'm sure you know why too.

481
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:52,929
- Why?
- Because you have the gift for life.

482
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:58,268
The rest of us, we're just lookin' for
a place to hide and watch it all go by.

483
00:44:58,393 --> 00:45:00,436
Amen.

484
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:05,441
Here's to your life, Roslyn.
I hope it goes on for ever.

485
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:08,152
And yours. And yours, Isabelle.

486
00:45:09,028 --> 00:45:12,657
And Gay. Gay did all the work, you know.

487
00:45:12,782 --> 00:45:17,036
Yeah. And the rabbits
are sure enjoyin' it too.

488
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:22,250
Can you break away from this paradise
long enough to do a little mustangin'?

489
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:26,879
Mustangin'? Now you're sayin' somethin'.
You been up in the mountains?

490
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,968
Took a quick look earlier this mornin'.
I spotted 15 horses.

491
00:45:32,093 --> 00:45:34,429
That's not too bad.

492
00:45:35,054 --> 00:45:38,683
Boy, I'd sure like
to get my hands on a rope again.

493
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:43,020
- What do you say?
- I will never understand cowboys.

494
00:45:43,145 --> 00:45:46,691
All crazy about animals, and
the minute they got nothin' else to do,...

495
00:45:46,816 --> 00:45:50,319
.. they run up in the mountains
and bother those poor wild horses.

496
00:45:50,444 --> 00:45:52,738
Shame on you!

497
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:54,865
Horses?

498
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:59,120
Sure. Nevada mustang. Used
to ship 'em all over the United States.

499
00:45:59,245 --> 00:46:03,165
Not many left.
We'd have to pick up another man.

500
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:07,044
Dayton Rodeo's on today. We ought
to be able to pick up a fella there.

501
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:10,714
That's an idea.
Hey, you never saw a rodeo.

502
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,925
Oh, you gotta see a rodeo!

503
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,220
- I'd love to. Will you come too?
- I'm all set.

504
00:46:16,846 --> 00:46:20,850
- I'll get dressed up. Let's have some fun!
- That's a girl. Go right now.

505
00:46:20,975 --> 00:46:25,271
Honey, when you smile
it's like the sun comin' up.

506
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:36,240
Boy, I'd like to have stopped off home
and get cleaned up.

507
00:46:36,365 --> 00:46:39,076
Why? You look nice. Doesn't he?

508
00:46:39,201 --> 00:46:44,832
- Lots better than some I've known.
- You're a mass of compliments, Isabelle.

509
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,920
Hey, Gay, stop. That guy next
to the phone booth. What's his name?

510
00:46:50,045 --> 00:46:53,674
- You worked the Stinson Rodeo with him.
- Perce Howland?

511
00:46:53,799 --> 00:46:56,760
Gay Langland! You old buzzard, you!

512
00:46:57,135 --> 00:46:59,888
What are you doin' sittin' out here, fella?

513
00:47:00,013 --> 00:47:02,724
Well, I hitched a ride
down to the Dayton Rodeo,...

514
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:06,228
.. but this fella changed his mind
and just left me settin' here.

515
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:08,563
Roslyn, this is Perce Howland.

516
00:47:08,689 --> 00:47:12,025
Well, old Gay's sure comin' up
in the world. How do, ma'am?

517
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,277
This is Isabelle.

518
00:47:14,403 --> 00:47:18,740
Oh, 'scuse me. I got a call in for home,
but they keep puttin' me in to Wyoming.

519
00:47:18,865 --> 00:47:20,992
Hello?

520
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:23,370
Hello?

521
00:47:23,495 --> 00:47:25,956
Hello, Ma? This is Perce.

522
00:47:26,998 --> 00:47:29,251
Yeah, I'm OK.

523
00:47:29,376 --> 00:47:32,254
No. I was in Colorado. I'm in Nevada now.

524
00:47:32,796 --> 00:47:35,257
Just won me a bull ride.

525
00:47:35,841 --> 00:47:37,884
Yeah.

526
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,555
Yeah, a pretty good rodeo.

527
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,099
A hundred dollars.

528
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,354
Ma, I was gonna buy you
a birthday present with it,...

529
00:47:49,479 --> 00:47:52,273
.. but I was comin' out of my boots.

530
00:47:53,817 --> 00:47:59,697
No, Ma, I haven't been in hospital since
I talked to you. I just bought some boots.

531
00:48:00,824 --> 00:48:04,577
Ma, what would I wanna get married for?
I just bought me...

532
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:12,293
Hey, you know what? On top of purse
money, I won me a nice silver buckle.

533
00:48:12,418 --> 00:48:17,674
Yeah. Got a buckin' horse on it and
my entire name written out underneath.

534
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:20,385
You proud?

535
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:24,806
Oh, no, no. My face is fine. It's all
healed up. It's just as good as new.

536
00:48:25,682 --> 00:48:28,601
You would too recognise me.

537
00:48:28,726 --> 00:48:33,314
Oh, OK, operator. Ma, listen.
Say hello to Frieda for me, will you?

538
00:48:33,439 --> 00:48:37,110
And to Victoria.
Yeah, and to Uncle George.

539
00:48:39,779 --> 00:48:42,490
OK, say hello to him too.

540
00:48:43,574 --> 00:48:47,578
No, no, Ma. It just
slipped my mind, that's all.

541
00:48:47,703 --> 00:48:50,456
Well, OK, I'm sayin' it now.

542
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:55,503
Ma, you married him, I didn't.
So say hello to him.

543
00:48:57,046 --> 00:49:01,801
Oh, is that...? Listen, maybe
I'll call you at Christmas time.

544
00:49:02,843 --> 00:49:04,637
OK.

545
00:49:04,762 --> 00:49:07,223
Hello? Hello?

546
00:49:10,851 --> 00:49:13,312
God bless you too.

547
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:19,777
I just know you'll take me to that rodeo.

548
00:49:19,902 --> 00:49:22,029
Sure. You entered?

549
00:49:22,154 --> 00:49:25,866
Well, I aim to be,
if I can get me a ride to town.

550
00:49:25,991 --> 00:49:29,453
And, uh, if I can raise $10
for the entrance.

551
00:49:29,578 --> 00:49:34,625
But I just spent my last $2 in that phone
booth. Boy, I'm real equipped, ain't I?

552
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:39,463
Say, how'd you like to do some
mustangin'? We need a third man.

553
00:49:39,588 --> 00:49:42,049
You still fly that DC-6 and seven eighths?

554
00:49:42,174 --> 00:49:44,593
It's a lot safer than buckin' horses.

555
00:49:44,718 --> 00:49:48,555
- There are still mustangs around here?
- I spotted 15 this morning.

556
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,934
- There might be a lot more, though.
- Well, I don't know.

557
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:54,770
What do you expect to get out of it?
Of 15 horses?

558
00:49:54,895 --> 00:49:57,856
I mean, like, if there was
a thousand or more...

559
00:49:57,981 --> 00:50:02,069
But goin' all the way up there for 15,
it kinda hits me sideways.

560
00:50:02,194 --> 00:50:05,989
- Better than wages, ain't it?
- Oh, anything's better than wages.

561
00:50:06,114 --> 00:50:10,327
I tell you what. We'll drive you to
the rodeo, put up the ten for the entrance.

562
00:50:10,452 --> 00:50:13,580
You come along tomorrow
and help us run some mustang.

563
00:50:13,705 --> 00:50:19,044
All right. You get me a good bottle of
whiskey to keep me primed for the rodeo.

564
00:50:19,169 --> 00:50:21,630
Just wait right here.

565
00:50:26,802 --> 00:50:30,180
You, uh... you an old friend of Gay's?

566
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:34,476
Pretty old.

567
00:50:35,894 --> 00:50:39,481
I broke my arm twice -
no, three times, in the same place.

568
00:50:39,606 --> 00:50:42,359
And you don't do that fakin' a fall.

569
00:50:42,484 --> 00:50:44,819
You know what some of these riders do?

570
00:50:44,945 --> 00:50:48,406
They just drop off and lay there
like they was stone-dead.

571
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:52,535
Not me, boy. I don't fake nothin'.
Right, Gay?

572
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:56,206
That's right.
You're just a natural-born fool.

573
00:50:56,331 --> 00:50:59,376
It's wonderful to be that way.
I know what you mean.

574
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:02,670
I used to dance in places,
and everybody thought I was crazy.

575
00:51:02,796 --> 00:51:05,924
I mean, I really tried.
People don't know the difference.

576
00:51:06,049 --> 00:51:11,054
- Oh, she'd try. I can just see her tryin'.
- What kind of dancin' do you do?

577
00:51:11,179 --> 00:51:15,225
Oh, interpretive dancing.
You know, nightclubs and... That's all.

578
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:20,480
I was in a nightclub once
in Kansas City called The Naked Truth.

579
00:51:21,356 --> 00:51:23,858
And they wasn't kiddin'!

580
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:26,945
Dayton comin' up.

581
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,951
Hey, Joe! Hi, Joe!

582
00:51:38,956 --> 00:51:41,417
Hey, Bengie! Hey!

583
00:51:42,168 --> 00:51:44,754
Hi, you old heathen, you!

584
00:51:46,506 --> 00:51:50,009
- Hey, gimme.
- Hiya, Perce.

585
00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:52,845
Oh, there's Franklin.
Boy, does he hate his wife.

586
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:56,015
Hey, Franklin, how's your wife?

587
00:51:58,601 --> 00:52:03,522
Man, there are a lot of good men here.
I sure hope I drew me a good horse.

588
00:52:03,648 --> 00:52:08,527
Just come out in one piece now,
cos you gotta go mustangin' tomorrow.

589
00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:35,179
- Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
- Sure.

590
00:52:35,304 --> 00:52:39,183
- How about you, sinner?
- Oh, I got no money yet.

591
00:52:39,308 --> 00:52:43,228
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.

592
00:52:43,562 --> 00:52:47,733
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.

593
00:52:48,734 --> 00:52:54,031
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Frank, Church Ladies' Auxiliary.

594
00:52:54,156 --> 00:52:58,202
- You just caught me at the bar next door.
- That'll learn you to stay put.

595
00:52:58,327 --> 00:53:03,081
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary...

596
00:53:08,003 --> 00:53:10,589
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

597
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:15,969
Excuse me, cousin.
There ain't many of us left now.

598
00:53:16,094 --> 00:53:18,889
No. Things is tough all over, pop.

599
00:53:19,723 --> 00:53:25,854
Come on, son. Give me a great big glass
of soda pop for my grandson Lester.

600
00:53:25,979 --> 00:53:30,609
I gotta hold onto him tight,
otherwise he'll run off to school.

601
00:53:31,526 --> 00:53:34,029
Hey, wait till I show you this.

602
00:53:34,154 --> 00:53:38,408
Here is the goldarnedest contraption
that anybody ever seen.

603
00:53:38,533 --> 00:53:41,578
You gotta hit the ball.

604
00:53:41,703 --> 00:53:44,789
- You catch what I mean?
- I can do it. Let me try.

605
00:53:44,915 --> 00:53:47,792
I'll bet you $2 you can't hit it
ten times in a row.

606
00:53:47,918 --> 00:53:50,670
Wait. I'll take that bet.

607
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:53,340
- Go on. Go on.
- I can do ten, I think.

608
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:58,345
Here's the paddle. Gangway,
gangway, everybody. Got a bet on.

609
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:01,973
.. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,...

610
00:54:02,098 --> 00:54:06,269
.. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,...

611
00:54:06,394 --> 00:54:10,648
.. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 30...

612
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,362
40.

613
00:54:46,392 --> 00:54:48,853
.. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

614
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:05,620
Here, do it while the spirit's in you.

615
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:28,809
- Here, here. What's the trouble?
- He put his hand on her.

616
00:55:28,934 --> 00:55:31,520
- That right, fella?
- I didn't mean nothin' by it.

617
00:55:31,645 --> 00:55:36,442
- What's goin' on? You lookin' for a fight?
- All right, all right. Let's get to the rodeo.

618
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,903
Here. It's the kid's.

619
00:55:39,987 --> 00:55:42,281
Isabelle, come on.

620
00:55:50,706 --> 00:55:53,751
Lester! Where'd you get the money?

621
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:57,629
A-ha-ha!

622
00:55:59,173 --> 00:56:02,885
One hundred... One hundred
and forty-five bucks!

623
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:06,513
- Hello, gold mine.
- That girl can do anything.

624
00:56:06,638 --> 00:56:09,016
I'd marry you.

625
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:13,020
Thanks for saying it,
but you don't have to do that.

626
00:56:13,145 --> 00:56:17,816
Don't shake that thing at me!
I'm still payin' for this broken arm.

627
00:56:18,901 --> 00:56:21,236
Charles!

628
00:56:21,737 --> 00:56:25,657
It's in the middle of your pretty eyes.
You're looking for the light, sinner.

629
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:29,077
I know you, and I love you
for your life of pain and sin.

630
00:56:29,202 --> 00:56:33,248
Give it to the only one
who loves you in your lonely desert.

631
00:56:33,373 --> 00:56:37,961
- She ain't sinned that much.
- We're going to fence off the graveyard.

632
00:56:38,086 --> 00:56:41,465
Keep these cowboys from pasturing
their horses on the graves.

633
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:47,804
Sweetheart, you've gone and helped
our dead to rest in peace. Go reborn.

634
00:56:47,929 --> 00:56:52,142
Who do you think is here, dear girl?
Who do you think is here?

635
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:55,020
- Who?
- My husband.

636
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:59,065
Oh, Iz! I'm so happy.

637
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:03,945
I never was so surprised.
They're here on their vacation.

638
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,782
- His wife?
- Clara. You've heard me speak about her.

639
00:57:07,907 --> 00:57:10,910
She's my oldest friend,
and she's sweeter than ever.

640
00:57:11,036 --> 00:57:13,747
She must be, to make you
so glad to see her.

641
00:57:13,872 --> 00:57:18,460
Charles never would've stayed married to
me. I even lost the vacuum cleaner once.

642
00:57:18,585 --> 00:57:20,712
They still haven't found it.

643
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:25,467
- Well, we gotta get this boy on a horse.
- I'll be around. But I can't go mustangin'.

644
00:57:25,592 --> 00:57:28,553
They're gonna stay
at my house for a week.

645
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:32,140
- Good luck, boy. So long.
- Oh, Isabelle...

646
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:48,448
Jim Palem in the saddle,
now ready to go on Polka Dot, gate one.

647
00:57:49,657 --> 00:57:51,993
Here he comes.

648
00:58:00,126 --> 00:58:04,172
- I didn't know it was that dangerous!
- That's the way they want it.

649
00:58:04,297 --> 00:58:08,426
Look. See that strap they've taken off?
That's what makes 'em buck.

650
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:12,096
- That grabs 'em where they don't like it.
- That's not fair!

651
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:15,141
Well, you wouldn't
have a rodeo otherwise.

652
00:58:15,266 --> 00:58:18,352
Then they shouldn't have a rodeo.

653
00:58:21,897 --> 00:58:24,608
Lester, what are you tryin' to do?!

654
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:37,413
- Don't break it, Grandpa.
- Don't get mad about it. Come on, Lester.

655
00:58:43,752 --> 00:58:46,881
- I hope you're sober.
- Man, I've won buckets of money...

656
00:58:47,006 --> 00:58:49,717
.. in towns I couldn't remember the name.

657
00:58:49,842 --> 00:58:52,261
Hey, there she is.

658
00:58:53,262 --> 00:58:55,723
I mean, there they are.

659
00:58:56,807 --> 00:59:01,145
Gay, I wouldn't, uh...
I wouldn't wanna move in on you.

660
00:59:02,062 --> 00:59:06,442
- Unless, of course, you wouldn't mind.
- Boy, I'd mind.

661
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:16,952
The next rider is Perce Howland
of Black River, Wyoming.

662
00:59:17,077 --> 00:59:19,454
- California, not Wyoming.
- Ready, boy?

663
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,665
- Outside.
- Open the gate!

664
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:26,878
Come on, Perce!

665
00:59:32,384 --> 00:59:35,012
Perce! Perce!

666
00:59:51,653 --> 00:59:53,947
- Thanks, Jim.
- OK.

667
00:59:54,072 --> 00:59:58,159
- Where's... Where's my hat, Pa?
- You got it on, Perce.

668
00:59:58,326 --> 01:00:01,121
- You're bleeding!
- Frieda! I'm all right.

669
01:00:01,246 --> 01:00:03,290
She ain't your sister.

670
01:00:03,415 --> 01:00:07,252
Looks like you've been messing around
with the wrong end of the horse.

671
01:00:07,389 --> 01:00:09,889
Let him sit down.
Are you the doctor?

672
01:00:09,933 --> 01:00:11,174
Doctor? I don't wanna doctor.

673
01:00:11,209 --> 01:00:14,254
Hold it, boy. I'm no doctor.
I'll just clean you up.

674
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,507
- Isn't there a doctor?
- Not for 60 miles. He ain't bad hurt.

675
01:00:17,674 --> 01:00:20,677
How do you know?
Let's take him. Come with me.

676
01:00:20,843 --> 01:00:23,930
Now don't start running things, Roslyn.

677
01:00:24,055 --> 01:00:29,060
- I don't understand. He's your friend.
- You're all right, ain't you, Perce?

678
01:00:29,227 --> 01:00:32,230
- Perce, you all right?
- Did I make the whistle?

679
01:00:32,397 --> 01:00:34,816
Almost, boy. You done good, though.

680
01:00:34,982 --> 01:00:37,860
That old horse, he sure
was rank, wasn't he?

681
01:00:38,027 --> 01:00:41,114
Oh, he was a real killer! You done good.

682
01:00:41,697 --> 01:00:45,201
- Leave him. He'll get up.
- Next event is the Brahma bull riding.

683
01:00:45,368 --> 01:00:49,664
- Oh. That's me.
- No, not yet. You got a couple of minutes.

684
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:54,043
- What for?
- He's got a bull to ride. Walk around a bit.

685
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:58,589
- Guido, he's not going in there again?
- I guess he wants to ride that bull.

686
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:01,842
Just let him walk it off, Roz.

687
01:01:02,009 --> 01:01:06,055
Why are you doing it? Take the money
we won in the bar. You helped me win it.

688
01:01:06,222 --> 01:01:10,518
Come on, take it. It's over $100.
You don't have to go back in there.

689
01:01:10,684 --> 01:01:14,188
I'm pretty good ridin' bulls.
I want you to watch me, Roslyn.

690
01:01:14,355 --> 01:01:18,484
- But why are you doing it?
- I put in for it. I entered.

691
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:20,653
- Stop him!
- How can I?

692
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,572
They don't mind getting busted up.

693
01:01:26,992 --> 01:01:29,578
- Perce!
- You don't know what you're saying!

694
01:01:29,745 --> 01:01:31,538
Perce, here's your prize!

695
01:01:31,705 --> 01:01:34,208
- OK, boy, you want it?
- Hell, yes!

696
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:39,421
We still have some real men in the West.
Back again, this time on a Brahma bull,...

697
01:01:39,588 --> 01:01:43,926
.. the cowboy from Black Hills, Colorado,
Perce Howland.

698
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:19,670
Come on, honey.
We're gonna have some drinks.

699
01:02:20,212 --> 01:02:22,339
Is he unconscious still?

700
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:28,011
Probably, but it ain't noticeable. He's
arguing with the judge about who won.

701
01:02:28,804 --> 01:02:31,098
You still mad at me?

702
01:02:31,264 --> 01:02:33,266
I don't understand.

703
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:38,021
People dying, and people just
standing around. Don't you care?

704
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:41,358
I just went in for that boy
with a wild bull runnin' loose.

705
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:45,403
- I'm lucky to be sittin' here myself!
- You did? You did?

706
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:49,240
Well, I just thought I could get him out,
so I did, that's all.

707
01:02:49,407 --> 01:02:52,786
But what if he'd died? It would be terrible!

708
01:02:52,952 --> 01:02:56,998
Honey, we all gotta go sometime.
Dyin' is as natural as livin'.

709
01:02:57,123 --> 01:03:01,628
- A man afraid to die is afraid to live.
- Roz? Did you see me?

710
01:03:01,795 --> 01:03:05,465
You were wonderful. Get in the back.
We're taking you to a hospital.

711
01:03:05,632 --> 01:03:09,260
- Oh, no. We're gonna have some fun.
- Yeah, sure. Come on.

712
01:03:09,427 --> 01:03:11,805
- How do you feel?
- How do I feel?

713
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:15,475
Like I was kicked by a bull.
He was somethin', wasn't he?

714
01:03:15,642 --> 01:03:19,437
Oh, I want no part of that bull,
except on a plate, medium rare.

715
01:03:19,604 --> 01:03:22,774
- Come on.
- Is he all right?

716
01:03:22,941 --> 01:03:26,986
Sure. In two weeks he won't
remember this. Or you, either.

717
01:03:27,111 --> 01:03:30,198
Why don't you give your sympathy
where it's appreciated?

718
01:03:30,323 --> 01:03:32,742
Where's that?

719
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,705
Hey, you guys, come on!

720
01:03:39,457 --> 01:03:42,668
I feel funny. I feel like...

721
01:03:43,211 --> 01:03:49,175
What was in the injection that man
gave to me? I... I see the prettiest stars.

722
01:03:49,342 --> 01:03:52,970
I never seen stars before.
You ever see stars before, Gay?

723
01:03:53,137 --> 01:03:57,099
It's like that bull had
the whole Milky Way in its hoof.

724
01:03:57,266 --> 01:04:01,395
Hey, Bill? Bill?
Whiskey for eight people, huh?

725
01:04:03,856 --> 01:04:07,985
Hey, was that you
crying in the ambulance?

726
01:04:08,819 --> 01:04:11,822
- Was that her, Gay?
- Sure was.

727
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:15,368
I certainly want to thank you.

728
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:21,749
Oh, now... Here's to my buddy -
old, elderly Gay.

729
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:24,502
Gay's not old.

730
01:04:24,668 --> 01:04:30,257
And to old, elderly Pilot
and his five-dollar, elderly airplane.

731
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:34,178
And... to my friend Roslyn.

732
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,976
- Well, we're all buddies now, right?
- That's right.

733
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:45,272
Then what are you lookin'
so mad at me for, buddy?

734
01:04:45,689 --> 01:04:47,316
Hey...

735
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:51,362
Uh, is it all right
if we have this dance together?

736
01:04:52,446 --> 01:04:57,785
Sure. Roslyn, why don't you
dance with Perce?

737
01:04:58,577 --> 01:05:00,496
OK.

738
01:05:19,473 --> 01:05:22,476
Nothin' like being young, is there, Gay?

739
01:05:22,643 --> 01:05:24,978
No, that's right.

740
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:33,320
But you know what they say. There's
some keeps gettin' younger all the time.

741
01:05:36,698 --> 01:05:39,034
What's eatin' you?

742
01:05:39,784 --> 01:05:42,078
Just my life.

743
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:49,878
This is the way my father used to do it.

744
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,393
Oh!

745
01:06:06,269 --> 01:06:09,022
- What's the matter?
- It's all right.

746
01:06:09,898 --> 01:06:12,942
Come on, let's go out and see the world.

747
01:06:31,794 --> 01:06:34,380
I... better sit down.

748
01:06:42,805 --> 01:06:45,933
- Do you mind?
- No.

749
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,102
Damn that bull.

750
01:06:48,269 --> 01:06:50,563
Don't say anything. Just be still.

751
01:06:53,149 --> 01:06:55,902
Gay's a pretty great fella, isn't he?

752
01:06:56,068 --> 01:06:58,070
Yes.

753
01:06:58,738 --> 01:07:02,575
You know, I can't figure you,
floatin' around out here like this.

754
01:07:02,742 --> 01:07:05,036
You belong to Gay?

755
01:07:06,495 --> 01:07:08,831
I don't know where I belong.

756
01:07:09,457 --> 01:07:13,836
I don't like to see the way
they grind up women out here.

757
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:18,257
Although I guess
a lot of them don't mind, do they?

758
01:07:18,424 --> 01:07:20,426
Some do.

759
01:07:20,926 --> 01:07:24,054
Don't you let them grind you up. Hear?

760
01:07:25,598 --> 01:07:28,517
How come you got
such trust in your eyes?

761
01:07:28,684 --> 01:07:31,353
- I do?
- Like you was just born.

762
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,899
- Oh, no.
- Was you really cryin' for me before?

763
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:40,112
You were hurt. Didn't anyone
ever cry for you before?

764
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:44,074
No. No stranger.

765
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:51,749
Last... April 12th, I was kicked so bad,
I was out all day and all night.

766
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:57,046
And I was with my girlfriend
and my two buddies.

767
01:07:57,171 --> 01:08:01,091
I haven't seen her
and I haven't seen them since.

768
01:08:03,385 --> 01:08:05,846
They left you? Alone?

769
01:08:09,766 --> 01:08:12,102
Can I ask you something?

770
01:08:12,269 --> 01:08:19,067
I mean, I don't have anybody, uh... you
know what I mean, that I could talk to.

771
01:08:20,777 --> 01:08:23,614
And I don't know how you should do...

772
01:08:24,531 --> 01:08:26,783
What do you mean?

773
01:08:27,284 --> 01:08:31,955
Well, see, this is the first year
that I've been floatin' around.

774
01:08:32,122 --> 01:08:36,251
I'm not like Gay and Pilot.
I got a pretty good home.

775
01:08:36,418 --> 01:08:39,504
I mean, I had a good home.

776
01:08:40,672 --> 01:08:42,674
One day...

777
01:08:43,884 --> 01:08:47,596
.. my father, we was out back, and...

778
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:52,142
.. boom, like that, it happened.
Down he went.

779
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:55,395
Some damn fool hunters.

780
01:08:56,897 --> 01:09:00,650
- They killed him?
- Mm-hm.

781
01:09:01,109 --> 01:09:03,528
And then she changed.

782
01:09:04,237 --> 01:09:07,365
- Who is "she"?
- My mother.

783
01:09:09,409 --> 01:09:15,248
She used... She used to be so dignified.
She'd walk next to him like a saint.

784
01:09:18,418 --> 01:09:24,382
Well, pretty soon this man
starts comin' around, and...

785
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:27,635
Well, she changed.

786
01:09:27,802 --> 01:09:32,181
Three months, they got married. Well, OK.

787
01:09:32,891 --> 01:09:39,314
But I said to her "Ma, look. You better
get a paper from this Mr Blackwell,...

788
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:44,319
.. because I'm the oldest, and you know
Papa wanted me to have this ranch. "

789
01:09:44,485 --> 01:09:46,696
So you know what happens?

790
01:09:46,863 --> 01:09:51,534
On their wedding night
he turns around and offers me wages.

791
01:09:52,952 --> 01:09:55,288
On my father's place.

792
01:09:55,455 --> 01:09:58,207
What did she say?

793
01:09:58,374 --> 01:10:00,376
Say?

794
01:10:01,502 --> 01:10:03,838
I don't think she heard.

795
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:08,843
It's like she hardly
remembers me any more.

796
01:10:10,094 --> 01:10:15,975
I don't know. It's hard to explain.
It's like she's changed altogether.

797
01:10:19,437 --> 01:10:25,484
So what I want to know... What I want to
know is... who do you depend on? Who?

798
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:28,529
I don't know.

799
01:10:29,697 --> 01:10:33,576
Maybe all there really is
is just the next thing.

800
01:10:34,201 --> 01:10:36,620
The next thing that happens.

801
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:41,542
Maybe you're not supposed to
remember anybody's promises.

802
01:10:41,709 --> 01:10:45,045
You could count on mine.
I trust you, Roslyn.

803
01:10:45,671 --> 01:10:48,841
- I think I love you.
- Oh, no. You don't know me.

804
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:51,885
I don't care. Roz... Oh!

805
01:10:52,803 --> 01:10:54,763
That damn bull!

806
01:10:57,016 --> 01:10:59,560
Roslyn? Roslyn?

807
01:11:00,811 --> 01:11:03,188
Here we are.

808
01:11:04,898 --> 01:11:07,818
Come on now.
I want you to meet my kids.

809
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:14,032
- Your kids are here?
- Yeah. They come to the rodeo.

810
01:11:15,993 --> 01:11:17,995
I ain't seen 'em in a year.

811
01:11:18,162 --> 01:11:22,541
Oh, you ought to see the welcome
they give me - nearly knocked me over!

812
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:26,753
- That great?
- I'm so glad for you, Gay.

813
01:11:29,673 --> 01:11:34,136
She's gonna be 19. She got so pretty.

814
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:39,850
They just happen to be here for the rodeo.
Both of 'em. That great?

815
01:11:43,687 --> 01:11:45,981
Where are they?

816
01:11:46,898 --> 01:11:48,692
Where are who?

817
01:11:48,859 --> 01:11:53,071
My kids. I told 'em I'd be back in a minute.
You heard me tell 'em.

818
01:11:53,238 --> 01:11:55,574
They went outside.

819
01:11:57,158 --> 01:11:59,160
Outside.

820
01:12:08,295 --> 01:12:10,797
Gaylord! Gaylord!

821
01:12:12,215 --> 01:12:15,218
Rosemary! Gaylord!

822
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:20,765
- Gaylord!
- Gaylord! Here's your father!

823
01:12:20,932 --> 01:12:24,018
Gaylord! I know you hear me!

824
01:12:24,894 --> 01:12:28,940
Where you gone to?
I told you I'd be right back!

825
01:12:29,107 --> 01:12:33,319
- You come here now!
- You'll probably find him at home.

826
01:12:33,486 --> 01:12:37,156
Gaylord! You come here now!

827
01:12:37,323 --> 01:12:39,742
I know you hear me!

828
01:12:39,909 --> 01:12:44,956
Rosemary! I know you hear me!
You come here now!

829
01:12:51,587 --> 01:12:56,300
Oh, Gay! They'll be looking for you,
I'm sure. They probably thought you left.

830
01:12:56,467 --> 01:12:59,137
Oh, poor Gay! Poor Gay!

831
01:13:04,225 --> 01:13:07,353
Aren't you going too fast? Please, huh?

832
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:14,235
Don't worry, kid.
I never kill anybody I know.

833
01:13:15,403 --> 01:13:19,865
A fella smashed up my best girlfriend.
She was beautiful, with black hair.

834
01:13:20,032 --> 01:13:22,410
Please, Guido.

835
01:13:22,576 --> 01:13:25,246
Say... Say hello to me, Roslyn.

836
01:13:25,705 --> 01:13:28,207
Hello, Guido. Please, huh?

837
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:35,714
We're all blind bombardiers, Roslyn.
We kill people we never even saw.

838
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,592
I bombed nine cities.

839
01:13:38,759 --> 01:13:42,263
I sure must've broken a lot of dishes,
but I never saw them.

840
01:13:42,429 --> 01:13:47,017
You know, think of all the puppy dogs
and mail carriers...

841
01:13:47,184 --> 01:13:50,062
.. and eyeglasses that must've gone up.

842
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:54,692
Boy, you know, droppin' a bomb
is like tellin' a lie.

843
01:13:54,858 --> 01:13:57,528
Makes everything so quiet.

844
01:13:57,695 --> 01:14:01,156
Pretty soon you don't hear anything,
you don't see anything.

845
01:14:01,323 --> 01:14:03,701
Not even your wife.

846
01:14:04,201 --> 01:14:08,831
Now the difference is that I see you.
You're the first one I ever really saw.

847
01:14:08,997 --> 01:14:11,333
Please, Guido, don't kill us!

848
01:14:12,209 --> 01:14:15,295
How do you get to know somebody, kid?

849
01:14:16,088 --> 01:14:20,551
I can't make a landing,
and I can't get up to God, either.

850
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,762
Help me.

851
01:14:24,513 --> 01:14:27,266
I never said "help me" in my life.

852
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:33,480
I don't know anybody.
So how do I land, honey?

853
01:14:34,564 --> 01:14:37,609
Will you give me a little time? Say yes.

854
01:14:41,697 --> 01:14:44,032
At least say "Hello, Guido. "

855
01:14:44,491 --> 01:14:47,327
Yes, Guido. Hello, Guido.

856
01:14:50,372 --> 01:14:52,666
Hello, Roslyn.

857
01:16:35,267 --> 01:16:37,269
Huh? Huh?

858
01:16:38,521 --> 01:16:41,273
OK. OK. I'll drive.

859
01:16:43,025 --> 01:16:45,694
- Gay, we're here.
- Where?

860
01:16:46,904 --> 01:16:48,906
Huh? OK.

861
01:17:00,918 --> 01:17:04,171
Guido, I'm so sorry. Guido?

862
01:17:05,255 --> 01:17:07,549
I'm sorry.

863
01:17:07,716 --> 01:17:10,469
Won't you hurt your hand? It's so dark.

864
01:17:10,969 --> 01:17:13,931
Guido, look how dark it is. It's all dark.

865
01:17:14,098 --> 01:17:19,436
Hey! Hey! What in the hell
are you stompin' the flowers for?

866
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:23,357
You busted all the damn heliotropes!

867
01:17:23,941 --> 01:17:29,363
Look at that. Look at that now.
What in the hell good is that?

868
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:35,702
- He's just trying to fix the house.
- What call has he got to fix the house?

869
01:17:35,869 --> 01:17:38,956
- He's only trying to say hello.
- Hello.

870
01:17:39,081 --> 01:17:41,917
What's goin' on?
Who's doin' that?

871
01:17:42,334 --> 01:17:45,504
Hey, who's done this? Who done this?

872
01:17:46,338 --> 01:17:50,300
- Don't take it off!
- Take it off me! What is it?

873
01:17:50,467 --> 01:17:53,637
- Don't take it off.
- Take it off! What is it?

874
01:17:53,804 --> 01:17:56,640
It's your bandage. Stop tangling it.

875
01:17:56,765 --> 01:18:00,393
- Bandage? What for, a bandage?
- For your head.

876
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:07,526
- Who tied this on me?
- The ambulance did.

877
01:18:07,692 --> 01:18:10,070
You leave me at a disadvantage all night?

878
01:18:10,237 --> 01:18:14,074
- No.
- Huh? Was it you, Gay?

879
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:17,994
Was it you, Gay?

880
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:21,998
Oh!

881
01:18:22,582 --> 01:18:25,251
- Who did that?
- Gay, come over here.

882
01:18:25,418 --> 01:18:28,797
- You leave me at a disadvantage?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

883
01:18:28,963 --> 01:18:31,216
Who did that to me?

884
01:18:32,467 --> 01:18:36,179
Where are we? Where are you goin'?
Leave me alone.

885
01:18:36,888 --> 01:18:41,601
Where are we goin'?
What is this blasted place?

886
01:18:41,768 --> 01:18:44,771
What is this place? Where are we?

887
01:18:44,938 --> 01:18:49,609
This is my house. Or it's Guido's.
Well, it's a house, anyway.

888
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:08,044
No. No, Ma, Ma, don't, don't.

889
01:19:18,304 --> 01:19:20,306
Gay?

890
01:19:21,974 --> 01:19:24,060
Come on, Gay.

891
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,855
I wish you'd met Gaylord and Rosemary.

892
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:34,528
If I had a new kid
I'd know just how to be with him.

893
01:19:35,446 --> 01:19:37,657
Just how to do...

894
01:19:38,491 --> 01:19:43,162
Oh, I wasted those kids.
I didn't know nothin'.

895
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:46,624
No. I'm sure they love you, Gay.

896
01:19:48,459 --> 01:19:51,545
Would you ever want a kid... with me?

897
01:19:52,546 --> 01:19:55,299
Let me turn off the light in the car.
You get some sleep.

898
01:19:55,466 --> 01:19:58,552
I don't wanna sleep.
I asked you a question.

899
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,264
Did I ask you to turn
the lights out in the car?

900
01:20:02,973 --> 01:20:06,352
What are you runnin' away from
all the time?

901
01:20:06,518 --> 01:20:09,271
I wouldn't wash the windows
for my wife, even.

902
01:20:09,396 --> 01:20:14,234
Painted the fireplace,
planted them damn heliotropes...

903
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:20,240
What are they doin' here? What do you
keep bringin' them around for?

904
01:20:20,407 --> 01:20:23,243
- Gay, I didn't bring 'em here.
- Where are you at?

905
01:20:23,368 --> 01:20:26,497
I don't know where you're at.

906
01:20:26,663 --> 01:20:29,750
Gay, I'm with you. I'm here with you.

907
01:20:33,337 --> 01:20:38,926
What if someday suddenly you turn
around and you don't like me any more?

908
01:20:39,885 --> 01:20:44,389
Like before, when Perce got hurt,
you started to give me a look.

909
01:20:45,098 --> 01:20:49,978
I know that look, and it scares me, Gay.
I couldn't be with strangers any more.

910
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:55,484
Honey, honey! I got a little mad, that's all.

911
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,153
That don't mean I didn't like you.

912
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:04,534
Didn't your papa ever spank you, then
pick you up and give you a big kiss?

913
01:21:04,701 --> 01:21:06,995
He did, didn't he?

914
01:21:07,871 --> 01:21:12,417
He was never there long enough.
And strangers spanked me for keeps.

915
01:21:12,584 --> 01:21:15,128
Oh, Gay! Love me, love me!

916
01:21:25,388 --> 01:21:27,932
We made up now. OK?

917
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:32,103
Yeah, OK. OK.

918
01:21:34,647 --> 01:21:36,941
Let's get some sleep.

919
01:21:38,151 --> 01:21:41,237
Yeah. Yeah, we'll make out.

920
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:45,700
I'll farm. Run some cattle maybe.

921
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:51,497
I'm a pretty good man, Roslyn.
Best man you'll ever see.

922
01:21:51,664 --> 01:21:54,417
I'll show you tomorrow,
up in the mountains.

923
01:21:54,584 --> 01:21:59,589
Not many can keep up with old Gay.
You wait and see.

924
01:22:13,644 --> 01:22:15,730
Help.

925
01:22:23,488 --> 01:22:27,408
- Why is the dog shivering?
- He'll do that up here.

926
01:22:51,348 --> 01:22:55,478
That star... That star is so far away...

927
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:00,858
.. that by the time the light from it
reaches us here on Earth,...

928
01:23:01,025 --> 01:23:03,861
.. it might not even be up there any more.

929
01:23:03,986 --> 01:23:06,822
Boy, you sure know a lot, don't you, Pilot?

930
01:23:06,989 --> 01:23:11,201
Astronomy is in all the library books,
Perce. Nothin' to it but readin'.

931
01:23:11,327 --> 01:23:15,372
- Still, it's wonderful to know things.
- Knowin' things don't matter much.

932
01:23:15,497 --> 01:23:18,876
- You got somethin' a lot more important.
- What?

933
01:23:19,043 --> 01:23:21,045
You care.

934
01:23:21,211 --> 01:23:24,840
Whatever happens to anybody,
it happens to you.

935
01:23:25,007 --> 01:23:28,844
You're really hooked into the whole thing,
Roslyn. It's a blessing.

936
01:23:29,011 --> 01:23:31,305
People say I'm just nervous.

937
01:23:31,472 --> 01:23:36,810
If it weren't for the nervous people in the
world, we'd all still be eating each other.

938
01:23:36,935 --> 01:23:39,396
I don't know about
you educated people,...

939
01:23:39,563 --> 01:23:43,984
.. but us ignorant folk
gotta hit the sack.

940
01:23:51,366 --> 01:23:54,745
- Why is the dog trembling?
- Got a whiff of the horses, I guess.

941
01:23:54,911 --> 01:23:58,332
- They must be close by, Guido.
- Baby... Baby...

942
01:24:00,584 --> 01:24:04,046
- Keep quiet, you fool!
- Oh, don't, Gay. He couldn't help it.

943
01:24:04,212 --> 01:24:09,634
- Have the horses ever kicked him?
- It's not the horses he's afraid of. It's us.

944
01:24:10,051 --> 01:24:13,889
What are you talkin' about? I never
mistreated that dog, and you know it.

945
01:24:14,055 --> 01:24:18,685
It's only common sense, Gay.
He knows there's wild animals up there.

946
01:24:18,852 --> 01:24:21,938
Dogs were wild too, once.
He's just remembering when.

947
01:24:22,981 --> 01:24:25,859
He's been up here enough times
to know what will happen.

948
01:24:26,026 --> 01:24:29,654
He's just scared
he's gonna end up dead too.

949
01:24:30,697 --> 01:24:35,327
Uh, come on, honey. Keep yourself
nice and warm here by the fire.

950
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:40,373
You kill them?

951
01:24:43,168 --> 01:24:45,837
No, no. We, uh... sell 'em to the dealer.

952
01:24:46,963 --> 01:24:49,215
He kills them?

953
01:24:50,925 --> 01:24:54,721
Well, they're chicken-feed horses.
You know, turn 'em into dog food.

954
01:24:54,888 --> 01:24:58,266
Like you buy in the store
for the dog and the cat.

955
01:25:00,435 --> 01:25:04,480
Well, I thought you knew that.
Everybody knows that.

956
01:25:07,692 --> 01:25:13,197
Maybe you better sleep on the truck, in
case something comes crawlin' around.

957
01:25:33,718 --> 01:25:36,095
Get some sleep now. Come on.

958
01:25:37,221 --> 01:25:39,223
Honey...

959
01:25:50,276 --> 01:25:55,364
Honey, I just round 'em up
and sell 'em to the dealer. Always have.

960
01:25:56,615 --> 01:26:01,579
There's no need to look at me that way.
You're lookin' at me like I was a stranger.

961
01:26:01,745 --> 01:26:03,581
Honey!

962
01:26:03,747 --> 01:26:06,333
I thought they were used
for riding, or for...

963
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,669
Well, sure, they used to be.

964
01:26:08,836 --> 01:26:14,425
Well, like Christmas presents for kids,
cos they're small horses, you see?

965
01:26:14,592 --> 01:26:17,428
But kids ride motor scooters now.

966
01:26:19,305 --> 01:26:23,017
They're real strong horses, though.
Little as they are.

967
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:27,771
They bred to 'em for stamina. Mustang
blood pulled all the ploughs in the West.

968
01:26:27,938 --> 01:26:32,651
They couldn't have settled here unless
somebody caught mustang for 'em.

969
01:26:32,818 --> 01:26:35,112
Somehow it all got changed around.

970
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:40,784
I'm doin' the same thing I always did.
It's just that they changed it around.

971
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:44,746
But you know what you're doing
isn't right, don't you?

972
01:26:44,913 --> 01:26:49,459
- If I didn't do it, somebody else would.
- I don't care about the others.

973
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:52,588
You've bought food for my dog.
What did you think was in it?

974
01:26:52,754 --> 01:26:56,049
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Nothin' can live unless somethin' dies.

975
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:58,218
Oh, stop!

976
01:26:58,385 --> 01:27:01,513
Roslyn, we never kidded, you and I.

977
01:27:02,264 --> 01:27:04,558
Now, I don't want to lose you.

978
01:27:04,725 --> 01:27:09,938
But you gotta help me a bit, cos I can't put
on that this is all as bad as you make it.

979
01:27:10,105 --> 01:27:12,482
All I know is everything else is wages.

980
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:16,403
I hunt these horses to keep myself free.
So I'm a free man.

981
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:19,239
That's why you liked me, isn't it?

982
01:27:20,157 --> 01:27:23,660
- I liked you because you were kind.
- I haven't changed.

983
01:27:23,827 --> 01:27:25,871
Yes. This changes it.

984
01:27:26,037 --> 01:27:28,874
Honey, a kind man can kill.

985
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,293
No. He can't.

986
01:27:33,169 --> 01:27:36,006
Well, maybe you have to take
the bad with the good,...

987
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:39,384
.. else you'll be runnin'
for the rest of your life.

988
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:44,514
What is there to stop for?
You're just like everybody else.

989
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:48,810
Yeah, sure. Maybe we're all alike.
Includin' you.

990
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:55,233
We start out doin' somethin', meanin'
no harm, somethin' naturally in us to do.

991
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:59,863
But somewhere along the line it gets
changed around into somethin' bad.

992
01:28:00,029 --> 01:28:02,365
Like dancin' in a nightclub.

993
01:28:02,532 --> 01:28:04,826
You started out just wantin' to dance.

994
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:09,706
But little by little it turns out that people
ain't interested in how good you danced.

995
01:28:09,872 --> 01:28:13,418
They're gawkin' at you with
somethin' different in their minds.

996
01:28:13,584 --> 01:28:18,840
And they turn it sour, don't they? I could
have looked down my nose at you too.

997
01:28:19,007 --> 01:28:23,052
Showin' yourself off in a nightclub
for so much a night.

998
01:28:23,219 --> 01:28:27,098
But I took my hat off to you,
cos I know the difference.

999
01:28:28,224 --> 01:28:32,687
This... This is how I dance, Roslyn. And
if they make somethin' else out of it,...

1000
01:28:32,854 --> 01:28:36,691
.. well, I can't run the world,
any more than you could.

1001
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:43,823
You took your hat off to me?

1002
01:28:47,994 --> 01:28:50,746
You mean that, don't you, Gay?

1003
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:57,712
Good night.

1004
01:29:19,775 --> 01:29:22,695
Shame on you, you old fool.

1005
01:29:29,243 --> 01:29:32,579
I can fly her back in the morning,
if you want me to.

1006
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:37,334
I was wonderin' how
she agreed to come out here.

1007
01:29:37,501 --> 01:29:40,337
She's got a lot of right,
when you think about it.

1008
01:29:40,504 --> 01:29:43,590
It don't make too much sense
for 15 horses.

1009
01:29:43,757 --> 01:29:48,387
Don't worry yourselves about her.
She's comin' along fine.

1010
01:29:52,724 --> 01:29:57,479
You be quiet now.
Everybody's showin' off.

1011
01:30:29,511 --> 01:30:32,013
OK, OK, Perce. Hold it, hold it.

1012
01:30:33,932 --> 01:30:36,601
Come on, Perce, give me a hand here.

1013
01:30:38,186 --> 01:30:40,438
Look, Gay. He's not snapping any more.

1014
01:30:40,605 --> 01:30:44,734
Yeah, things generally
look different in the morning.

1015
01:30:56,788 --> 01:30:59,207
Try and chase 'em
down the old mine road.

1016
01:30:59,374 --> 01:31:01,417
OK, Gay, I'm ready.

1017
01:31:01,584 --> 01:31:04,128
How do you want her?

1018
01:31:04,295 --> 01:31:06,297
That way.

1019
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:29,946
Boy, that's some jacket.
Pretty breezy, though, isn't it?

1020
01:31:30,113 --> 01:31:36,369
Been on a lot of missions in this thing.
I wouldn't take $100 for it. It's bulletproof.

1021
01:31:36,536 --> 01:31:40,581
I wish you were comin' along with me.
You'd see some real flyin'.

1022
01:31:41,791 --> 01:31:45,670
Probably never see this again
in history, you know.

1023
01:31:49,507 --> 01:31:52,260
- OK, Gay.
- Switch off?

1024
01:31:52,385 --> 01:31:54,971
Throttle closed, switch off.

1025
01:31:58,099 --> 01:32:00,768
Turn your partner, boy. Do-si-do.

1026
01:32:01,894 --> 01:32:04,980
- Once more, con amore!
- Here we go.

1027
01:32:05,439 --> 01:32:07,441
Contact.

1028
01:32:10,277 --> 01:32:13,781
That lousy car gas! All right, try it again.

1029
01:32:15,574 --> 01:32:17,576
Contact.

1030
01:35:39,443 --> 01:35:41,862
It's like a dream.

1031
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:47,368
I seen a picture of the moon once.
Looked just like this.

1032
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:50,829
- You want up?
- Yes.

1033
01:35:52,331 --> 01:35:57,085
- He'll drive the horses out of that pass.
- Who owns this land?

1034
01:35:57,252 --> 01:36:00,798
Government, probably.
Might as well call it God's country.

1035
01:36:00,964 --> 01:36:03,050
- You see anything?
- Uh-uh.

1036
01:36:03,217 --> 01:36:07,930
How quiet it is. You can hear
your skin against your clothes.

1037
01:36:08,847 --> 01:36:13,518
You're lookin' real good, honey. What
do you say we go into Reno tonight?

1038
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:14,895
OK.

1039
01:36:15,062 --> 01:36:19,983
I forgot to tell you something last night.
Cow outfits use the pasture up here.

1040
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:23,153
They shoot mustang
and leave 'em for the buzzards.

1041
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:26,698
Cos they eat all the good feed.
You know that, don't you, Perce?

1042
01:36:26,865 --> 01:36:29,868
- Huh? Yeah, I know that.
- Why didn't you say so?

1043
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:31,995
I just said so.

1044
01:36:32,162 --> 01:36:36,291
They're nothin' but misfit horses.
I wish you'd been here in the old days.

1045
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:39,878
I seen 'em pour out of those passes
400, 500 at a time.

1046
01:36:40,045 --> 01:36:43,089
We'd build a corral and funnel 'em into it.

1047
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:48,428
Some of 'em were real beautiful animals.
Made sweet ridin' horses.

1048
01:36:48,595 --> 01:36:51,848
- I wish I'd been here then.
- I hear something.

1049
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:54,476
- What?
- Engine, sounds like.

1050
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:56,853
- Where?
- Out there.

1051
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,689
No, it's too soon.
He wouldn't be in the pass yet.

1052
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,776
- Listen. I hear him.
- There he is!

1053
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:04,903
Gay, look!

1054
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:10,033
I'd have seen him,
but I didn't expect him so soon.

1055
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:13,787
Oh, I seen him glinting against the sun.
That's what it was.

1056
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:15,955
What's that?

1057
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:20,251
He fired a shot.
Hey, you got good eyes, old boy.

1058
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:22,670
Uh-oh. Here they come.

1059
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:26,966
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1060
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:32,138
- I guess he'll go back for the rest now.
- Let me have a look.

1061
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:36,434
- You see the rest yet?
- No.

1062
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:40,897
Six. It looks like a stallion and four mares.

1063
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:45,193
- And a little colt.
- You sure?

1064
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:47,779
Yeah. A spring foal.

1065
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:52,533
Yeah. It's a colt all right, Gay.

1066
01:37:53,784 --> 01:37:56,287
Want a look?

1067
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:08,090
Maybe it's cooler in the truck.

1068
01:38:12,803 --> 01:38:15,097
It's all right. She's gonna make it.

1069
01:38:15,264 --> 01:38:17,725
You said there'd be fifteen.
There are only six.

1070
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:20,561
Ah, probably lost a few. That'll happen.

1071
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:23,189
It don't make much sense for six, does it?

1072
01:38:23,355 --> 01:38:26,442
Six is six. Better than wages, ain't it?

1073
01:38:27,443 --> 01:38:33,324
- I said it's better than wages, ain't it?
- Sure. Anything's better than wages.

1074
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:40,122
Perce, I know a place about 100 miles
northeast, Thighbone Mountain.

1075
01:38:40,998 --> 01:38:43,375
Must be at least 500 head in there.

1076
01:38:43,542 --> 01:38:47,755
I never bothered with 'em cos it's tough
to get 'em out. You have to horseback in.

1077
01:38:47,921 --> 01:38:53,260
I don't know, Gay. To tell you the truth,
I don't even know about rodeos any more.

1078
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:56,680
Boy, I'm beginnin'
to smell wages all over you.

1079
01:38:56,847 --> 01:38:59,933
Sure wish my old man hadn't died.

1080
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:03,270
When you get through wishin',
all there is is a man's work.

1081
01:39:03,437 --> 01:39:05,689
And there ain't much of that left.

1082
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,775
Come on, give me a hand with this drum.

1083
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:33,800
Come on, Perce, let's get these stakes in.

1084
01:40:14,299 --> 01:40:18,595
Come on, Dooley.
Come on, dog. Here, Dooley.

1085
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:38,156
Come on, Perce.

1086
01:40:45,371 --> 01:40:47,623
Let's go, boy!

1087
01:41:09,562 --> 01:41:13,774
You grab hold now.
We're gonna do a lot of fast turning.

1088
01:41:36,839 --> 01:41:39,300
Throw again, Perce!

1089
01:41:43,429 --> 01:41:45,556
Get that horse, cowboy.

1090
01:41:48,267 --> 01:41:50,436
That's the way!

1091
01:42:10,205 --> 01:42:12,708
Attaboy, Gay!

1092
01:42:39,818 --> 01:42:42,237
Get that horse!

1093
01:43:07,929 --> 01:43:10,390
Attaboy, Gay!

1094
01:43:15,103 --> 01:43:17,605
- Well, here's the big chief.
- What?

1095
01:43:17,772 --> 01:43:19,649
The stallion.

1096
01:43:37,458 --> 01:43:40,003
Get that horse, cowboy.

1097
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:43,464
That's the way.

1098
01:43:50,138 --> 01:43:55,476
We'll tie 'em up now, and open their
nooses so they won't choke overnight.

1099
01:43:55,601 --> 01:43:59,647
- Overnight?
- The dealer'll pick 'em up in the morning.

1100
01:44:16,372 --> 01:44:18,374
Perce?

1101
01:44:20,501 --> 01:44:23,587
- Were those his mares?
- Uh-huh.

1102
01:44:23,754 --> 01:44:25,923
Was that his colt?

1103
01:44:29,093 --> 01:44:31,262
Perce, get in here.

1104
01:45:51,758 --> 01:45:54,678
- Gay, why are you killing him?
- Stand aside, honey.

1105
01:45:54,845 --> 01:46:00,183
- OK, you won! All right, you've won!
- Let go of that rope! Get outta here!

1106
01:46:00,308 --> 01:46:03,895
- Gay, darling...
- Pull him! Choke him down, Guido!

1107
01:46:04,563 --> 01:46:07,148
- Get off me, Roslyn.
- Stop it!

1108
01:46:08,858 --> 01:46:12,028
- Roslyn!
- Shut up and pull that horse down!

1109
01:46:12,195 --> 01:46:15,615
Come on! One, two... Go!

1110
01:47:00,868 --> 01:47:04,622
Well, I guess comin' up here
for the first time like her,...

1111
01:47:04,789 --> 01:47:08,376
.. there might not seem much sense to it,
for only five horses.

1112
01:47:08,668 --> 01:47:11,212
Not knowin' how it used to be.

1113
01:47:11,838 --> 01:47:17,009
I never thought of it, but I guess
the fewer you kill, the worse it looks.

1114
01:47:19,929 --> 01:47:22,932
What do you say
we give her these horses?

1115
01:47:24,308 --> 01:47:30,106
How much do you want for 'em? I'll pay
you. I'll give you $200. Is that enough?

1116
01:47:38,906 --> 01:47:43,661
- Let's get in the truck.
- Gay, you was about to give 'em to her.

1117
01:47:43,828 --> 01:47:48,541
I did think of it, but I sell to dealers only.
Cos all they're lookin' to buy is a horse.

1118
01:47:48,707 --> 01:47:51,460
- I didn't mean to insult you, Gay.
- No insult.

1119
01:47:51,627 --> 01:47:56,090
I'm just wonderin' who you think
you've been talkin' to since we met.

1120
01:48:22,491 --> 01:48:24,910
Brother, what a day.

1121
01:48:25,369 --> 01:48:29,915
I nearly hit a mountain back there.
Cylinder cut out at the bottom of a dive.

1122
01:48:30,082 --> 01:48:32,125
Squirtin' oil.

1123
01:48:32,292 --> 01:48:35,545
Boy, that's the closest
I ever come, I tell ya.

1124
01:48:36,964 --> 01:48:40,133
Listen, do you want me to stop this?

1125
01:48:41,969 --> 01:48:45,889
I know how you feel, Roslyn.
I never liked this part myself.

1126
01:48:46,056 --> 01:48:49,768
Truthfully, the only part
I enjoyed is the flying.

1127
01:48:50,477 --> 01:48:52,813
You want me to stop it?

1128
01:48:52,979 --> 01:48:56,942
- You would?
- You're through with Gay now, right?

1129
01:48:58,318 --> 01:49:03,406
Well, tell me. He doesn't know what
you're all about. He'll never know.

1130
01:49:04,199 --> 01:49:09,621
Tell me, Roslyn. I been waitin'.
I'm goin' out of my mind with waitin'.

1131
01:49:11,081 --> 01:49:16,503
Come back with me. Give me a week,
two weeks. Let me show you what I am.

1132
01:49:16,670 --> 01:49:21,091
Tell me, Roslyn.
Give me a reason and I'll stop it.

1133
01:49:21,675 --> 01:49:25,220
There'll be hell to pay,
but give me a reason and I'll do it.

1134
01:49:25,387 --> 01:49:31,601
A reason? You, a sensitive fellow.
So sad for his wife.

1135
01:49:32,227 --> 01:49:35,605
Crying about the bombs you dropped
and the people you killed.

1136
01:49:35,772 --> 01:49:38,525
You have to get something to be human?

1137
01:49:38,691 --> 01:49:43,905
You never felt anything for anybody in
your life. All you know is the sad words.

1138
01:49:44,072 --> 01:49:49,244
You could blow up the world,
and all you'd feel is sorry for yourself!

1139
01:50:19,524 --> 01:50:22,485
- She's an old one.
- Fifteen if she's a day.

1140
01:50:22,652 --> 01:50:25,404
She wouldn't last through the winter.

1141
01:51:02,942 --> 01:51:06,987
We'll tie down the other three
on the way back.

1142
01:51:07,279 --> 01:51:11,116
- What do you think this mare'll weigh?
- About 600 pounds, I guess.

1143
01:51:11,283 --> 01:51:15,579
- Must be about 400 on that brown, huh?
- Just about, yeah.

1144
01:51:16,038 --> 01:51:18,540
Must be about 800 on the stallion.

1145
01:51:19,249 --> 01:51:23,545
- A little lighter. About 1900, 2000 pounds.
- How does that all come out?

1146
01:51:23,712 --> 01:51:27,591
Well, six cents a pound,
be about $110, $120.

1147
01:51:27,758 --> 01:51:30,928
- How do you wanna cut it up?
- Any way you like.

1148
01:51:31,094 --> 01:51:34,389
- I'll take 50 for myself and the plane.
- OK.

1149
01:51:34,556 --> 01:51:37,893
I ought to have about 40
for the truck and me.

1150
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:41,480
That leaves 25 for you, Perce.
That all right?

1151
01:51:41,647 --> 01:51:43,440
Perce!

1152
01:51:43,607 --> 01:51:48,695
No. You fellas take it.
I just came along for the ride anyway.

1153
01:51:48,862 --> 01:51:50,697
Horse killers!

1154
01:51:50,864 --> 01:51:53,617
Killers! Murderers!

1155
01:51:54,076 --> 01:51:57,329
You're liars! All of you, liars!

1156
01:51:58,330 --> 01:52:01,625
You're only happy
when you can see something die!

1157
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:04,711
Why don't you kill yourselves
and be happy?!

1158
01:52:04,878 --> 01:52:07,881
You and your God's country! Freedom!

1159
01:52:08,757 --> 01:52:13,595
I pity you! You're three
dear, sweet, dead men!

1160
01:52:17,015 --> 01:52:19,935
She's crazy. They're all crazy.

1161
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:25,482
You try not to believe it because
you need them. She's crazy.

1162
01:52:25,649 --> 01:52:31,446
You struggle, you build, you try,
you turn yourself inside out for 'em.

1163
01:52:31,613 --> 01:52:35,492
But it's never enough.
So they put the spurs to you.

1164
01:52:36,201 --> 01:52:39,954
I know. I got the marks.
I know this racket.

1165
01:52:40,121 --> 01:52:45,293
- I just forgot what I knew for a little while.
- Butchers! Murderers!

1166
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:49,130
I pity you! You're three dead men!

1167
01:53:11,194 --> 01:53:13,696
Hold this light for me, will you?

1168
01:53:23,289 --> 01:53:28,544
Buck up, boy. Before you know it
you'll be up to your neck in dames again.

1169
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:32,673
I just been thinkin'.
I don't know how we got so stupid.

1170
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:35,968
The world is full of mountains.

1171
01:53:36,135 --> 01:53:42,600
Montana, Colorado, Canada, even Mexico.
Where there's mountains, there's horses.

1172
01:53:42,767 --> 01:53:46,520
Probably we could clean 'em all out
till we're too weak to walk.

1173
01:53:46,687 --> 01:53:50,941
We'd work a while and...
I could even sell my house.

1174
01:53:51,108 --> 01:53:54,028
I don't know what I've been
keepin' it for anyway.

1175
01:53:54,153 --> 01:53:58,616
Put everything into a good plane.
We'll get this thing on a business basis.

1176
01:53:58,741 --> 01:54:02,411
For instance, we ought to water
those horses before we weigh 'em in.

1177
01:54:02,578 --> 01:54:05,664
Put 50 pounds on just these five
if we let 'em drink.

1178
01:54:05,831 --> 01:54:09,043
- We just been foolin' around.
- I wanna get out of here. Come on.

1179
01:54:09,209 --> 01:54:12,880
No. With a good plane you could
fly into Reno from anywhere.

1180
01:54:13,047 --> 01:54:17,092
Check into the Mapes,
have a good time, and off we go again.

1181
01:54:17,259 --> 01:54:19,720
Boy, we wouldn't need anybody.
I tell you...

1182
01:54:19,887 --> 01:54:23,724
Why don't you shut up, Guido?
Just shut up, huh?

1183
01:54:44,745 --> 01:54:50,000
- Do you want me to turn 'em loose?
- No. There'd just be a fight.

1184
01:55:06,391 --> 01:55:09,478
I'll meet you at the dealer's.
We'll get his winch truck.

1185
01:55:09,644 --> 01:55:13,190
Don't spin the prop till I check the switch.

1186
01:55:24,743 --> 01:55:28,038
- Switch off?
- Switch off. Throttle closed.

1187
01:55:32,042 --> 01:55:35,128
Contact.

1188
01:55:48,683 --> 01:55:50,685
Gay!

1189
01:56:50,244 --> 01:56:52,913
Go home. Go.

1190
01:58:43,565 --> 01:58:45,775
Help him, Perce.

1191
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:56,661
He don't want no help.

1192
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:23,813
Gay?

1193
02:00:35,926 --> 02:00:39,012
You held him.
I'm proud of ya, boy. You held him.

1194
02:00:39,138 --> 02:00:44,393
We'll get them all back tomorrow. Just get
your wind back now. Get your wind back.

1195
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:49,022
Don't worry, we're not through here.
We're only gettin' started.

1196
02:00:49,189 --> 02:00:53,735
We don't need anybody in the world.
You know that now, don't you?

1197
02:01:00,617 --> 02:01:02,911
What are you doin'?

1198
02:01:15,799 --> 02:01:18,552
What in the hell you catch him for?

1199
02:01:20,303 --> 02:01:24,432
Don't want nobody makin' up
my mind for me, that's all.

1200
02:01:26,059 --> 02:01:28,186
Damn 'em all!

1201
02:01:28,353 --> 02:01:34,109
They changed it. Changed it all around.
Smeared it all over with blood.

1202
02:01:36,528 --> 02:01:38,863
Well, I'm finished with it.

1203
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:43,868
It's... It's like ropin' a dream now.

1204
02:01:46,579 --> 02:01:50,542
Just gotta find another way
to be alive, that's all.

1205
02:01:50,709 --> 02:01:53,086
If there is one any more.

1206
02:01:56,047 --> 02:01:59,926
Perce, cut that mare loose
for me, will you?

1207
02:02:00,093 --> 02:02:02,095
Sure.

1208
02:02:08,726 --> 02:02:11,187
Drive you back, if you want.

1209
02:02:21,406 --> 02:02:24,367
Um, I'm pleased to have met you, Roslyn.

1210
02:02:25,535 --> 02:02:28,830
Don't get hurt any more, will you, Perce?

1211
02:02:34,919 --> 02:02:39,549
- See you around, Guido.
- Where'll you be? Polishin' windshields?

1212
02:02:39,715 --> 02:02:41,843
Makin' change in a supermarket?

1213
02:02:42,009 --> 02:02:46,973
Try the Laundromat! They need a fella
there to load the machines!

1214
02:02:47,139 --> 02:02:48,683
Gay!

1215
02:03:04,281 --> 02:03:06,867
I'll leave tomorrow. OK?

1216
02:03:41,819 --> 02:03:44,321
I bless you, girl.

1217
02:04:07,219 --> 02:04:10,889
Gay, if there could be
one person in the world,...

1218
02:04:11,056 --> 02:04:15,394
.. a child who could be brave
from the beginning...

1219
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:20,357
I was scared to when you asked me.
But I'm not so much now. Are you?

1220
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:23,401
No.

1221
02:04:25,362 --> 02:04:28,740
How do you find
your way back in the dark?

1222
02:04:30,408 --> 02:04:33,411
Just head for that big star straight on.

1223
02:04:34,079 --> 02:04:36,289
The highway's under it.

1224
02:04:36,957 --> 02:04:39,542
It'll take us right home.
