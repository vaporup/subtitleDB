1
00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:00,773
Catch!

2
00:00:03,527 --> 00:00:04,126
Take it back

3
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:10,603
Ah, it's just wires

4
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:12,326
Ok, let me come up and play with you

5
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:19,506
Right ladies, let's test your balancing skills

6
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,065
Now, only the Holy Mother is left

7
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:43,369
You will be my student!

8
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:53,422
Double Dragon's stance

9
00:00:57,608 --> 00:00:59,359
Master's feet are tied

10
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:00,533
Go down

11
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:01,722
Not that easy

12
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:06,414
Come here

13
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:07,852
All right!

14
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:15,730
Cut!

15
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,192
Take it back

16
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:47,062
Come up

17
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,610
Cross the bridge

18
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,144
Your bridge is ruined,

19
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:54,227
why don't you release us now?

20
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:55,003
Retreat!

21
00:01:59,058 --> 00:02:00,429
Master, my money was on you!

22
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:01,950
No... I mean.

23
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:02,939
I was sure you'd defeat them

24
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:03,994
Burn the bridge

25
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:11,437
Fei Hung

26
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:12,486
How are you?

27
00:02:12,822 --> 00:02:13,137
I am fine

28
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:13,724
Fei Hung,

29
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,137
I was worried about you

30
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,492
It's a mess, a mess

31
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:22,752
If Aunt Yee sees Master holding Aunt May,

32
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:24,317
there'll be trouble

33
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:28,337
Fei Hung, it's fine, let's write to Aunt Yee
to tell her we're safe

34
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:30,374
Aunt Yee is enough,
how can he court Aunt May?

35
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:33,330
Aunt Ching will come
next month... Oh my God!

36
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:35,031
What is it?
Who's there?

37
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,552
I want to comfort that lady

38
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,052
But you don't know her

39
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,190
So how can you comfort her?

40
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:41,432
If I don't comfort her,
how can I get to know her?

41
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:51,660
They are back! Come out!

42
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:52,971
Master, master

43
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:53,963
Are you all right?

44
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:56,772
I am fine

45
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:00,533
Of course, they can't
compete with master at all

46
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:03,700
How are you, sir!

47
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,950
I'm glad you're back

48
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:06,805
Old Master Wong, Master Wong

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,123
We were thinking of ways to save you all night

50
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:12,030
Then we discovered
the Red Lantern Sect had visited

51
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:14,229
We've just sent someone to rescue you,
but you are back now

52
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:15,733
Sorry for worrying you

53
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:16,782
Time

54
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,690
Shit, it's started

55
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,236
Master Wong

56
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:21,460
Your Excellency

57
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:23,878
General Guan has instructed us
that if we see you

58
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:25,331
we should ask you to go
to Tun Chau Square at once

59
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,789
The Dragons and the Lions are fighting now

60
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:30,992
What?
The Lion King Competition is being held today?

61
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:34,080
Right, The Lion King Competition organized by
the 8 countries is being held today

62
00:03:34,116 --> 00:03:35,639
Right, Master, it's today

63
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,269
Why are you so excited?

64
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:38,894
I thought you'd forgot

65
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:39,695
Think again!

66
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:40,752
Your Excellency,

67
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:41,364
please show me they way

68
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:41,903
Fine

69
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:45,413
Fei Hung

70
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,284
Aunt May

71
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:48,280
Brother-in-law,
let me go with you

72
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:51,119
If anything happened,
how could I explain it to your sister?

73
00:03:52,494 --> 00:03:53,800
Club Foot, follow me

74
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:55,457
Yes Master!

75
00:03:57,026 --> 00:03:57,437
Ah Fu

76
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:00,423
Why are you standing there?

77
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:00,955
Come on now!

78
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:15,442
So childish

79
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:17,368
Childish

80
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:19,691
Bastard! What a copy cat

81
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:41,193
Our nine golden dragons

82
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,887
must stay alert

83
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:45,884
Under the bait,

84
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:47,511
there are machine guns

85
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,252
Nine Dragons set out

86
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,400
They are blocking our way,

87
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:26,579
we've to find a way out

88
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,675
Dragons in the sky

89
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:41,640
Dragons in the sky...

90
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:45,558
Dragons in the sky

91
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:51,172
The Yellow and the

92
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,162
Red Dragon are destroyed

93
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:53,378
There are many enemies,

94
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,558
you'd better be more careful

95
00:05:54,757 --> 00:05:55,256
Got you!

96
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:57,229
Halt!

97
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:59,473
We are the competitors

98
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,999
The competition had started,

99
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:01,489
leave now

100
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:04,505
What did he say?

101
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:06,269
He said the competition has started

102
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:07,046
We are not allowed to go in

103
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:08,489
How come!

104
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:12,924
Master, let me talk to him

105
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,027
Consider it carefully Fei Hung

106
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:14,991
Fu, Club Foot, let's go

107
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:15,860
Forget about them,

108
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:16,276
let's rush in

109
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:16,940
Fine

110
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:24,699
Don't let them leave

111
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:35,067
They have gone that way

112
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:39,242
Don't let them get away

113
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,782
Ride on it's back

114
00:06:57,848 --> 00:06:58,791
Be careful of it changing position

115
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:09,533
Catch the dragon head

116
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:02,628
Let me ride that horse

117
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:42,890
The dragon of the Blue Clan is in trouble

118
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:44,333
Take the wounded away

119
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:44,930
Yes Sir!

120
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:46,653
The great eagle is coming

121
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:54,954
White dragon, watch out!

122
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:09,014
Yellow dragon, be careful!

123
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:15,619
Sir, the red dragon is trapped

124
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:26,540
Close the gate, hurry up

125
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:29,700
Prepare to fire weapons,
close the gate now

126
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:33,650
Close the gate

127
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,726
Fei Hung, they are trying to close the gate

128
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:36,840
They won't!

129
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:44,595
Hurry up, they are chasing us

130
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:45,868
Don't be afraid, I am here

131
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,353
Club Foot, you have no horse,
you can't catch up with us

132
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,348
Open it, quick

133
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,183
Yes!

134
00:09:59,111 --> 00:09:59,873
Let's see who's faster

135
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:07,148
Damn you Clubfoot, how dare you
step on my shoulders?

136
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,393
They are shooting...
Get down!

137
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:15,116
Fei Hung, we've made it

138
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:18,742
Watch out, it's coming

139
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:27,206
Just our dragon is left

140
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:32,946
His Excellency is in the middle

141
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:39,422
It's oil, let's escape

142
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:11,955
Hurry up

143
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:21,298
Sir

144
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,084
- Fei Hung
- Sir

145
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:28,886
Wong Fei Hung

146
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:34,209
You must take revenge... for me

147
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:40,559
Your Excellency...

148
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:43,817
We were too late

149
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:44,896
What a pity

150
00:11:46,086 --> 00:11:47,064
Your Excellency...

151
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,198
Your Excellency!

152
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:10,174
The officers from Tai Lei Temple
send their condolences

153
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:18,338
The Officers from Shun Tin Office
send their condolences

154
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:24,849
Sirs, thank you for your condolences

155
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,843
His Excellency Li Hung Chang
sends his condolences

156
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:44,208
His Excellency send his condolences

157
00:12:57,305 --> 00:13:01,764
Wong Fei Hung sends his condolences

158
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:49,076
A blood letter from Wong Fei Hung

159
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:01,133
I am the Lion King of Ching Dynasty

160
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:08,207
I was too late to participate
in the competition last time

161
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:12,270
Now I am challenging
the lion kings of the 8 countries

162
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:15,109
If you accept the challenge,

163
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:18,033
I'll meet you in two days time
in the same square

164
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:21,063
Let destiny determine who will win or lose

165
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:22,923
Wong Fei Hung

166
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:29,048
Does Wong Fei Hung want to take
revenge for Guan Shing-tao?

167
00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:33,885
Fine, tell him that I will give him a chance...

168
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:35,420
To meet an even worse fate!

169
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:03,813
Brother Fu, how do I look?

170
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,084
Fine, just look at Clubfoot

171
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:07,092
so lady like

172
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:10,102
To be honest, I don't think so

173
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:11,916
But I am afraid we'll be discovered by others

174
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,969
Don't worry!

175
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:14,142
If we are discovered,

176
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:14,979
I'll handle it. Let's go

177
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:22,948
Sister Fu, what does your lady look like?

178
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:24,868
She is like me, so lovely

179
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,095
We're so well matched!

180
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:42,827
Sister Yan, don't run off

181
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:45,345
It doesn't matter,
we will go for our own targets later

182
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,335
What for?

183
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,273
To look for our own ladies

184
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,071
That's big trouble

185
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:50,390
This seems to be the road

186
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:51,312
leading to the rented territory

187
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:54,571
Who cares if it is or not?
Let's concentrate on the ladies!

188
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:55,297
Let's go

189
00:17:56,706 --> 00:17:59,065
Master Chiu, why are you looking for me?

190
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:01,607
I have heard that you are going to challenge
the lions of the 8 countries

191
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:05,947
Our ancestors have left us something
to combat the "Powerful Fists"

192
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:09,074
I asked the smith to repair it overnight

193
00:18:09,497 --> 00:18:10,918
I don't know whether it's useful to you or not

194
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:16,761
The copper lion

195
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:17,461
Yes

196
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:21,292
It's made from 90 catties of copper

197
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:27,865
Look at the craftsmanship in this lion head

198
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,222
It is a work of art

199
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:35,641
But our students can hardly handle it

200
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:38,681
If it is useful to you in the competition,

201
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:42,248
Please take this as a present from our school

202
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:42,918
Master Chiu

203
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:45,446
Please rise

204
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:50,737
Fei Hung, this lion head is much heavier
than normal lion heads

205
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:53,797
It's not easy to handle

206
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:57,557
Yes, but there are merits too

207
00:18:58,366 --> 00:18:59,827
The lions of the 8 countries
are strong and powerful

208
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,651
It's useless to rely on our Kung fu against them

209
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:05,822
We should destroy them by tactics

210
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:07,037
I agree with you

211
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:09,709
I would like to accompany you Master Wong

212
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:10,710
Master Chiu

213
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:15,020
Father...

214
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:17,530
Father

215
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:18,265
The Red Lanterns are here

216
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:19,473
Red Lanterns?

217
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:40,048
Listen, keep calm, keep calm

218
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,252
It is not safe here, we'd better leave

219
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:47,528
Where are you going?

220
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:47,969
You devils!

221
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:49,779
Sister, let's chase the devils separately

222
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,136
The rest of you...

223
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,029
Burn the church. Go

224
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:53,082
Go, chase after the devils

225
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:53,779
Yes!

226
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:56,523
It's on fire

227
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:58,850
What? On fire?

228
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:00,333
Where is on fire?

229
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,818
It should be the East Alley

230
00:20:03,142 --> 00:20:05,176
The church of Father Thomas is over there

231
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:07,126
I have to take a look

232
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,736
Fu

233
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:16,173
What's the matter?

234
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,028
The Red Lantern ladies are burning and killing,
what'll we do?

235
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:19,206
Don't disclose our identities

236
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:20,199
Leave at once

237
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:20,644
Freeze

238
00:20:22,323 --> 00:20:24,202
I know you are men posing as women

239
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,317
So, you've seen through our disguise

240
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:29,265
Ladies, castrate them

241
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:31,054
We are in danger!

242
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:31,946
Let's run for our lives!

243
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:36,150
Where are you going?

244
00:20:36,765 --> 00:20:37,687
Club Foot, let's go separately

245
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,958
So, whom should I go with?

246
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:02,150
Kill them right here

247
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,587
Wong Fei Hung?!

248
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:12,739
Go

249
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:16,078
Why don't you go now?

250
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:16,944
Go now

251
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:18,565
Oh... He asked us to go

252
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,081
This way is safe

253
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:21,698
This way

254
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:26,315
May, you'd better stop searching
for Fei Hung with us

255
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,814
Well, I will wait for you right here

256
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:32,124
Master Chiu, let's search for
Fei Hung separately

257
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:32,572
Fine

258
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:41,841
Go over there

259
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,407
Sister, the foreigners are over there

260
00:21:47,604 --> 00:21:48,738
Let's attack them from both sides

261
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:49,923
OK, follow me

262
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:50,570
Yes!

263
00:21:53,343 --> 00:21:55,405
Father Thomas, are you all right?

264
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,595
Heaven have mercy

265
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,694
My child, the Red Lanterns are after us,
run for your life!

266
00:21:58,826 --> 00:21:59,389
Go that way

267
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:08,030
It's you?!

268
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,690
Yes, it's me

269
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:11,699
What bad luck!

270
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,950
Father, you are here!

271
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:16,668
It's you

272
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:20,597
Go over there.

273
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,557
Let me fight with them

274
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:23,659
Go!

275
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:24,709
Yes, Senior

276
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:29,422
Ladies, no massacre please,
they're innocent!

277
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:30,865
If you want to kill, kill me first

278
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:32,456
Get lost,

279
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:33,317
you have no say here

280
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:37,199
Catch them and kill them right here

281
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:37,941
Yes

282
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:38,474
Let's run for our lives

283
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:39,402
I'll kill the woman,

284
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:40,073
you take the foreigners!

285
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:41,767
Sister, stop!

286
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:44,481
Father

287
00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:46,936
You!

288
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:50,941
Kill the devils!

289
00:22:52,226 --> 00:22:52,694
Sister

290
00:22:58,603 --> 00:22:59,583
He saved me once

291
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,562
You liar!

292
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:03,710
You are the betrayer!

293
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:06,546
When Wong Fei Hung came to our hall,

294
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,596
I started to suspect you

295
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,478
Now, I'm proved right!

296
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,523
You are not qualified to hold
this Anti-foreigner's Flag

297
00:23:14,524 --> 00:23:14,937
Shoot!

298
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:29,409
Senior!

299
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,598
She deserved it,

300
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:33,458
God will punish her

301
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:37,062
Miss

302
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:39,521
Let's go

303
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:43,725
Get lost, forget about me

304
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:52,482
Don't leave me alone!

305
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:54,082
I didn't betray you

306
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,244
Die bitch!

307
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:14,488
Let's see your magic now!

308
00:24:19,977 --> 00:24:20,770
Miss

309
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:22,714
Stop!

310
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,673
Help!

311
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,176
Fei Hung?!

312
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:34,890
Take her away

313
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,032
Prepare to fire!

314
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:05,239
You are hurt, why do you still want to fight?

315
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:07,468
Don't go!

316
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:09,979
Move her over there

317
00:25:11,772 --> 00:25:13,392
She's been hurt.

318
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,960
She must be cold

319
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:15,784
Use this to cover her

320
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:44,456
It's dark! I can't see anything

321
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:46,753
What a fate!

322
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:50,607
Where is Wong Fei Hung?

323
00:25:50,803 --> 00:25:51,748
Fei Hung...

324
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:52,355
Where is he?

325
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:54,589
He is here

326
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:00,046
You're not him!

327
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:03,265
I'd never have believed

328
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:05,272
I'd die saving the devils!

329
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:07,029
It's my punishment!

330
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,199
I may die in peace now

331
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:19,045
Wong Fei Hung, at last, you've come

332
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,865
Brother Fu, let's go

333
00:26:43,641 --> 00:26:45,294
Brother Fu, the Holy Mother is coming

334
00:26:48,803 --> 00:26:49,840
Brother Club Foot,
come and save us!

335
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:50,897
Go to hell

336
00:26:55,271 --> 00:26:56,083
Stay where you are!

337
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:56,895
I want to punish you

338
00:26:58,455 --> 00:26:59,345
Club Foot, are you all right?

339
00:26:59,412 --> 00:26:59,893
I'm fine

340
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:01,674
Take aim!

341
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:03,963
The symbol of heresy!

342
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,324
Should we save her?

343
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:20,622
How?

344
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:22,123
We are wearing the uniforms

345
00:27:22,446 --> 00:27:23,678
If we go out like this,
we will be shot at

346
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:34,382
I'm Goddess Lotus,
the spirit resides in me

347
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,390
I'm invincible!

348
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,688
How dare you offend me!

349
00:27:39,078 --> 00:27:41,458
I've to punish you on behalf of God

350
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,534
I'll send you to hell!

351
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:45,156
To tear your skin off!

352
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,402
To break your bones!

353
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:47,767
You bastards!

354
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:01,596
Let's go

355
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:03,445
Master

356
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:04,720
The three of you, stay where you are

357
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,099
Club Foot? Ah Fu? Ah Yan?

358
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:09,754
Why are you dressed like this?

359
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,359
Are you going to be opera actors?

360
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:13,277
You had it coming!

361
00:28:14,664 --> 00:28:20,108
Holy Mother...

362
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:26,480
Don't cry, tears can't help

363
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:29,097
Right, Holy Mother hasn't passed away,

364
00:28:29,132 --> 00:28:30,913
she is living in our hearts

365
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:32,666
Let's take an oath, we should

366
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,493
carry on the mission
of killing the foreigners!

367
00:28:36,523 --> 00:28:40,280
Kill the foreigners,

368
00:28:40,314 --> 00:28:43,050
save our beloved country!

369
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,592
This bait could hurt us anytime

370
00:29:29,614 --> 00:29:30,953
If the opposite side use fire.

371
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:34,203
Getting the bait is less important
than beating their lions

372
00:29:35,097 --> 00:29:36,269
Let's attack them remember

373
00:29:36,784 --> 00:29:37,228
Yes, Master

374
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:38,942
Music!

375
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:23,071
The lions roar!

376
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:43,638
Each lion attack a monster

377
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,288
Yes!

378
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:47,817
"One step to the sky"!

379
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:55,225
Stop turning!

380
00:30:55,266 --> 00:30:56,059
We can't turn

381
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,029
"Magic Turn"!

382
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:04,157
I want you to "turn round and round"

383
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,313
Old Master Wong,
I can't identify the flag in the front

384
00:31:11,355 --> 00:31:12,305
It's so messy,
I can't identify either

385
00:31:12,343 --> 00:31:13,413
Forget the flags,
let's recognise their face

386
00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:25,228
Should we beat this one?

387
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:25,964
No, not this...

388
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:36,006
Club Foot, hold this for me

389
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:37,633
I feel better having no lion head

390
00:31:38,054 --> 00:31:40,466
But, how am I going to handle
two lion heads?

391
00:31:41,491 --> 00:31:43,140
You are abnormal anyway

392
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:45,521
They may be scared of you
holding two lion heads!

393
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:46,957
That's it

394
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:51,479
It's our turn!

395
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:51,967
All right!

396
00:31:56,962 --> 00:31:58,036
"Swinging lion tail"!

397
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:48,611
Come on...

398
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,170
Fu, what are you doing?

399
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,060
You should be careful!

400
00:32:53,295 --> 00:32:54,054
"Tiger jump"!

401
00:33:12,303 --> 00:33:13,158
Come on...

402
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:19,625
Why has it gone dark?

403
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,485
Where am I?

404
00:34:02,242 --> 00:34:02,839
Who are you?

405
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,305
Big head Buddha,
don't you recognise me?

406
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,613
Let me show you

407
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,177
Some more!

408
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:38,468
You want to fire?

409
00:34:38,502 --> 00:34:39,511
Not that easy!

410
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:44,543
Here comes a cookie!

411
00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:55,654
This one is even better,
I'll leave it with you

412
00:35:17,725 --> 00:35:18,551
Let's help old Master

413
00:35:18,747 --> 00:35:21,514
Attack!

414
00:35:51,978 --> 00:35:52,868
Master Chiu, watch out!

415
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:57,161
Catch the lion tail

416
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:13,579
So you are scared away?

417
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:15,138
Brother Fu, look out behind!

418
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,529
How dare you scare me?!

419
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:31,721
The sun will soon go down

420
00:37:31,756 --> 00:37:32,832
behind The Forbidden City

421
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,907
History will be re-written

422
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,891
We'll see who is going to be the winner

423
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:06,114
Throw the burning lion heads up here

424
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:07,105
Yes!

425
00:38:20,362 --> 00:38:21,307
The bait?!

426
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:32,072
Ah Yan

427
00:38:32,651 --> 00:38:33,247
Ah Yan!

428
00:38:40,957 --> 00:38:41,586
Take cover!

429
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:47,571
My ass is shot! Take me out!

430
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:49,828
Go!

431
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:51,804
Club Foot, come over here, be quick!

432
00:38:58,051 --> 00:39:00,086
Master, let me send you up there

433
00:39:07,633 --> 00:39:08,490
General, leave here quickly

434
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:18,465
We won

435
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:22,409
General Henlintak

436
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:29,188
Good news

437
00:39:29,223 --> 00:39:33,458
Long live Germany!

438
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:35,718
Long live America!

439
00:39:43,328 --> 00:39:43,857
What has happened?

440
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:45,045
Why are they so cheerful?

441
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:47,481
Bull shit, they are celebrating for us

442
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:49,076
It's bull shit indeed!
Let's go and take a look

443
00:39:58,702 --> 00:40:00,100
I can't see them, move forward

444
00:40:00,154 --> 00:40:00,978
Move forward

445
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:01,447
Yes

446
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,512
Fei Hung

447
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,209
Sir, why are you dressed like that?

448
00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:17,803
The allied troops of the 8 foreign countries have
marched into the Forbidden City

449
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,877
The Empress Dowager has surrendered

450
00:40:22,974 --> 00:40:24,278
Master Wong, let's go

451
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:26,818
Let's go!

452
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,788
Although we won this competition,
we lost our country!

453
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:44,875
Henlintak

454
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:50,277
General, go to the celebration now,
let us handle Wong Fei Hung

455
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:52,850
Wait for me

456
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:54,317
Fei Hong

457
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:11,035
Henlintak!

458
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,605
Get lost, don't block my way

459
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:45,189
Wong Fei Hung

460
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:46,220
I am here

461
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,164
Hurry up

462
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:16,986
Don't go. Protect the General

463
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:25,903
What's happening?

464
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:29,694
Henlintak, get down!

465
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:38,260
Lui, protect the general

466
00:43:41,716 --> 00:43:42,246
Henlintak!

467
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:43,043
Wong Fei Hung!

468
00:43:43,657 --> 00:43:44,126
Master!

469
00:43:45,188 --> 00:43:46,589
Let me handle this

470
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:50,146
Go down

471
00:43:56,624 --> 00:43:57,090
Club Foot!

472
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:00,860
Try my kick!

473
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:06,123
Club Foot!

474
00:44:10,138 --> 00:44:11,592
Watch out!

475
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:17,367
General

476
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:20,733
Do you wanna escape

477
00:44:22,685 --> 00:44:23,183
Do you want to cuff me?

478
00:44:23,229 --> 00:44:23,857
Watch my kick

479
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:31,139
Club Foot,
I'm going to kill you

480
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:31,676
Not that easy

481
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,487
Try my "Scissors kick"!

482
00:44:47,956 --> 00:44:48,454
Henlintak!

483
00:45:04,765 --> 00:45:05,313
Strike!

484
00:45:07,576 --> 00:45:08,109
You had it coming!

485
00:45:11,144 --> 00:45:11,774
Lui

486
00:45:12,034 --> 00:45:12,504
Master

487
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:13,594
Club Foot, let me handle it!

488
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:14,416
Master, let me handle it!

489
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:15,895
Strike!

490
00:45:19,075 --> 00:45:19,543
Eat dirt!

491
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,247
I wanna break your leg!

492
00:45:34,352 --> 00:45:35,292
Go and protect the general

493
00:45:35,626 --> 00:45:36,124
Go

494
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:40,138
Wanna escape?

495
00:45:40,181 --> 00:45:41,071
Club Foot they have guns!

496
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:41,584
Fire

497
00:45:41,962 --> 00:45:42,513
Let's go!

498
00:45:52,795 --> 00:45:53,651
Master,

499
00:45:53,686 --> 00:45:54,543
shall we let them escape?

500
00:45:55,948 --> 00:45:57,880
We can't change anything
by killing him

501
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:01,526
Let's go

502
00:46:02,608 --> 00:46:03,307
Master!

503
00:46:03,311 --> 00:46:03,605
Master

504
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,194
Are you seriously hurt?

505
00:46:05,228 --> 00:46:05,727
No!

506
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:06,377
Fei Hung

507
00:46:06,823 --> 00:46:07,237
Brother

508
00:46:08,187 --> 00:46:10,573
It's dangerous here, we'd better leave

509
00:46:11,314 --> 00:46:12,870
Dad, let's go back to the South

510
00:46:14,276 --> 00:46:15,415
Yes. Our capital is occupied.

511
00:46:15,453 --> 00:46:17,711
We should go back and prepare to retaliate

512
00:46:20,392 --> 00:46:22,141
OK, let's go back to the South, now

513
00:46:22,398 --> 00:46:22,863
Get in

514
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:25,487
I can't sit down!
My ass hurts!

515
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,014
Lie down then

516
00:46:40,668 --> 00:46:43,726
