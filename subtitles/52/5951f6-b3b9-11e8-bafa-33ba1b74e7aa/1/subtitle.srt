Is Master Wong Fei Hung there?

24
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:12,908
Fei Hung is out,

25
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:14,498
thank you for coming

26
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,422
Give them the red packets for their presents

27
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:16,972
I am going to fetch it at once

28
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:18,712
Thank you Master Tam,

29
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:20,292
your present is too precious!

30
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:21,729
Please go in and have some tea

31
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:24,507
After you...

32
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,537
Red packets...

33
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,158
Come on, it's yours

34
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:28,505
Master Chiu has arrived

35
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:31,090
Your son won in the Lion King Competition,

36
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:32,365
he is so famous now

37
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,965
Give a red packet as a present

38
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:35,250
Master Wong,

39
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:36,178
today is a big day.

40
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:38,179
I want to have a drink with your son.

41
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:39,048
Where is Fei Hung?

42
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,574
He has gone to the train station

43
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,318
Is this the lion head used by Wong Fei Hung

44
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:42,947
for the competition?

45
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:45,441
I've heard that this defeated
thousand of lions

46
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:47,012
for the gold medal

47
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:51,353
Someone said Master Wong joined
the competition so as to save a person

48
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,400
That's why he returned the medal to
the government after receiving it

49
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,158
What a hero!

50
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:57,532
Isn't it fantastic!

51
00:04:58,143 --> 00:05:02,735
A true hero!

52
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:04,785
The Lion King Competition started...

53
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,768
My master,
Wong Fei Hung, appeared

54
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,969
He is the head of the 10 Tigers of Canton,

55
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,325
and he is the coach of the Local Militia

56
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:13,608
He stood on the tower,

57
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,725
he called, "Leung Fu,

58
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:15,713
Leung Fu..."

59
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:17,417
Who is Leung Fu?

60
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:18,881
Why did Wong Fei Hung

61
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,420
shout for his help at such at critical moment?

62
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:21,795
Leung Fu, never heard of him!

63
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,428
Never heard of him?

64
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,637
He is so famous

65
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:25,978
What a shame!

66
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:29,112
About Leung Fu,

67
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:31,449
his eyes are sharp and big

68
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:32,633
Look at me!

69
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:33,976
Remind you of anybody?

70
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:35,506
Leung Fu is great,

71
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,156
he is a famous Kung-fu master
from Mei Province to Fu-Shan

72
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:40,106
He is famous from Fu-Shan

73
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,998
to Macao and to Hong Kong too

74
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:43,789
Inform me when you see Master

75
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:45,959
I haven't seen Master yet,

76
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:47,011
let Fu keep on bluffing

77
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,962
Leung Fu is the number one
student of Master Wong,

78
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:49,702
but...

79
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:51,903
He is as famous as
Wong Fei Hung

80
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:53,280
I know him so well!

81
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,627
Guess who am I!

82
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:55,455
I don't know

83
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:56,544
Don't you know?

84
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:57,506
Let me tell you

85
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:00,219
I am Leung Fu

86
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,073
It's him, it's him

87
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:03,923
Wrong guy

88
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:04,757
Foolish people,

89
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:05,590
they are too ignorant

90
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,542
Master...

91
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:14,487
- Master!
- What's the matter?

92
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:15,873
Some officials are coming,
they look nasty

93
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:17,073
- Officials?
- Yes

94
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:18,318
- What are they coming for?
- Maybe they are coming to arrest someone?

95
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:19,496
Impossible, let's go and have a look

96
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,137
Sire

97
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:23,914
The Deputy Governor is coming
with his golden dragon

98
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:25,514
with a congratulation card
from the General's Office,

99
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:26,349
for Master Wong

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,195
Please arrange for the reception

101
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,315
A congratulation from the General's Office?

102
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,381
Quick!
Ask them to prepare the firecrackers,

103
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:34,721
to welcome the golden dragon

104
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:35,555
Hurry up!

105
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:58,311
Brother Fu,
a golden dragon is coming from the East Gate

106
00:06:59,250 --> 00:06:59,730
A dragon?

107
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,033
Yes, a big dragon

108
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:03,015
Coming for a challenge?

109
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,195
You are stepping on my foot

110
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:10,398
Brother Fu, what'll we do?

111
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:10,820
Inform Master now

112
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:12,541
There's no time!
Now, listen to me

113
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:13,251
Ah Yan,

114
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:13,752
bring me the lion head

115
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:14,562
Club Foot, the flag of our Association

116
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:17,308
Don't forget the drum

117
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,722
I see them,
they are outside the East Gate

118
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,353
Give way please

119
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:36,396
Here comes the Lion King

120
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:53,556
Sire

121
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,465
What's the matter?

122
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:56,919
A lion from the Cantonese Association

123
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:58,541
has come to block our way

124
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:00,565
Block our way?

125
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:03,179
Have they come to welcome us?

126
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:03,921
It doesn't seem so

127
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,391
The lion keeps kicking our dragon's head

128
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:08,788
Master

129
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:10,020
Have the people from the
General's Office arrived yet?

130
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:11,523
No, they've stopped in front of the East Gate

131
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:12,867
Why?

132
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:14,594
A lion is challenging them

133
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,467
Brother Fu, balance yourself,
don't fall down

134
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:23,545
Brother Fu, you are heavy

135
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:25,245
No Shadow Kick from Fu-Shan

136
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:28,760
The dragon head can't touch
the ground

137
00:08:37,272 --> 00:08:38,198
I haven't lost face, have I?

138
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,178
Dragon in the sky!

139
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,238
Lion head

140
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,567
Think you can catch the lion head again?

141
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:56,579
Club Foot

142
00:08:58,434 --> 00:08:58,856
Master!

143
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:26,252
Master!

144
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:28,057
You are back?!

145
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:29,421
Why are you standing there?

146
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:30,492
Hold the tail

147
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:31,460
Yes, Master

148
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:39,163
He must be Wong Fei Hung

149
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,715
Dragon in the sky

150
00:09:44,232 --> 00:09:45,526
Master, watch the dragon

151
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:46,821
Club Foot, "Rolling tiger"

152
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,661
Club Foot,
"Tiger look up to the moon"

153
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:00,544
All right

154
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:11,774
They are higher,
let me test you

155
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:21,567
Clubfoot, the lion head must face the
dragon head, that's the rule, got it?

156
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:24,409
That's no problem at all

157
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:39,398
Club Foot, keep your balance,
don't make any mistakes

158
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,236
I am speedy

159
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:46,349
Excellent, so stable

160
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:47,822
Dragon ball

161
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,659
Dragon ball from the golden dragon,
it represents good luck

162
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,333
Catch the ball

163
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,923
Master Wong, good luck to you

164
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:05,716
Thank you very much

165
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:07,023
Ever successful

166
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:08,202
Ever successful

167
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:17,278
Club Foot, let me send you there

168
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:35,659
Once again

169
00:11:39,177 --> 00:11:41,000
Master, I can't make it

170
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:43,237
Let me do it

171
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,035
Catch the tail

172
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:50,841
Yes

173
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:23,980
My respects!

174
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:27,711
I am the Deputy Governor,
Guan Shingtao

175
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,314
Your Excellency,
I am Wong Fei Hung from Fu-Shan

176
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:34,403
I've heard your name for a long time,
you're really a great master in Kung-fu

177
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:37,639
We've seen the best today

178
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:40,287
You really are the Lion King

179
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:41,503
Thank you

180
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:43,262
You're welcome

181
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,403
If it hadn't been for this,

182
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,943
we would never have seen
your fantastic lion dance

183
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:51,403
Master Wong rejected the gold medal of Lion King

184
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:54,949
Thus, his Excellency Li Hung-Chang asked me
to return the medal to you

185
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,683
Please

186
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:57,798
don't make me lose face

187
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:59,750
Come on, please take it

188
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:00,705
Your Excellency...

189
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,791
Please take it

190
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,173
Thank you, Your Excellency

191
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,282
Please be seated

192
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,304
Thank you

193
00:13:11,004 --> 00:13:11,457
Fu!

194
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:12,407
Tell me,

195
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:13,454
how should I punish you?

196
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:14,636
I know what to do

197
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,418
I have packed up,
I will leave for Fu-Shan by tomorrow morning

198
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:18,663
How about the ticket?

199
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:19,812
I have asked Uncle Kau to buy it for me

200
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:23,106
I will go to the train station
by tomorrow morning

201
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,363
When you reach Fu-Shan,
write me a letter to tell me you're all right.

202
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:28,608
It's written

203
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:30,712
No, I mean

204
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:32,729
I will write a letter
right after reaching Fu-Shan

205
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:35,760
You are always disobedient

206
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:39,503
Brother Fu

207
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,654
What's the matter?

208
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:41,833
Let me come back to Fu-Shan with you.

209
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,086
I'll live in seclusion with you

210
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:44,526
Live in seclusion,

211
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:44,941
you are that great?

212
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:46,055
I won't stop you from living
in seclusion alone

213
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:48,132
You've a night to think over,

214
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:50,305
are you going to live in seclusion or not?

215
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:53,367
Your Excellency

216
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:54,011
Master Wong

217
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,195
Everybody, please

218
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:56,849
Master Wong, please take a look

219
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:57,558
An invitation?

220
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:58,261
Yes

221
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,259
Why is there another Lion King competition?

222
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,984
This Lion Competition is between 8 countries

223
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:05,229
Another competition

224
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:07,606
what a pity you're going back to Fu-Shan soon

225
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,894
Why do the foreigners want to
organize another lion competition?

226
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:12,035
This lion competition organized

227
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:14,755
by 8 foreign countries,

228
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:17,766
mirrors the present situation,

229
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:19,295
The relationships between China

230
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:21,042
and the other countries are quite tense

231
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,487
Our country is getting weaker and weaker

232
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:26,214
The challenge of the 8 countries

233
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:28,021
Is designed to suppress our spirit

234
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,025
there may be other tricks as well

235
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:31,434
To compete with the lions of the foreigners...

236
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,284
It's quite a challenge

237
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,845
I won't leave no matter what!

238
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:37,060
I guessed so

239
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,266
Master Wong

240
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:41,854
this competition is similar to a war

241
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:45,455
Our office has sent someone
to investigate their force

242
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:49,332
These are the plans designed by the foreigners

243
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,769
Golden Eagle, Giant Clam

244
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:56,161
Long Dragon, Double Horses

245
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,401
Flying Phoenix,

246
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:00,512
Golden Unicorn

247
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:03,974
I have heard that these lions

248
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:05,789
are much bigger than normal

249
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,930
They are specially equipped

250
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,085
But I don't know how powerful they are

251
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:12,784
I hope you can participate

252
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:14,165
in the competition with me

253
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:16,334
To fight together for our beloved country

254
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:18,121
Master Wong, it's different

255
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:20,327
from the previous competition

256
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:22,628
I hope you'll come with us

257
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:25,643
Fu, guess what Master's answer will be

258
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,411
He must say,

259
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:30,456
"I'm afraid we may be trapped if we

260
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:32,317
participate in this competition"

261
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,591
I am afraid we may be

262
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:36,217
trapped if we participate in this competition

263
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:39,251
"But, if we don't participate,
our country will lose face"

264
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:43,782
"I think, we should have a detailed plan"

265
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:46,599
But, if we don't participate,
our country will lose face

266
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:50,399
I think, we should have a detailed plan

267
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,970
Master Wong, are you going to participate or not?

268
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:59,193
"In our present situation,

269
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:01,970
it's pointless participating in this competition"

270
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:05,031
Although we know this a trap

271
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:06,997
we should take the risk anyway

272
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:10,208
I have to participate in this competition

273
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:13,903
Master Wong

274
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:16,765
We're going to participate in the competition,
bravo!

275
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:20,267
Shit

276
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:22,898
I can't stay for the competition

277
00:16:25,142 --> 00:16:25,606
Oh yes

278
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:29,728
Go and seek help from Aunt May

279
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:30,404
Good idea

280
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,929
Aunt May!

281
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:32,666
How can she help?

282
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,711
She has a news agency in Peking

283
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:36,221
Go and help her to deliver

284
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:37,905
the newspapers, beg her to let you stay

285
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:40,911
And ask her not to tell Master, that's it

286
00:16:40,954 --> 00:16:42,956
Good idea, but...

287
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:44,909
Your ideas are usually terrible

288
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:48,493
Is this Man Hing News?

289
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:50,599
It seems to be

290
00:16:50,768 --> 00:16:51,496
Aunt May...

291
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:52,324
Have you got the wrong address?

292
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:53,253
Aunt May

293
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:54,470
Coming...

294
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:55,362
Aunt May

295
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:56,035
Who's it?

296
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:57,632
It's me, Leung Fu

297
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:00,929
Aunt May

298
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,007
Have you had Cantonese tea yet?

299
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:03,610
There is no Cantonese restaurant in Peking!

300
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:06,168
Why did you bring so much luggage with you?

301
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:08,455
You know, Master is so mean!

302
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:11,635
So we didn't tell Master we came to help,
but told him we were going to Fu-Shan

303
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,684
Don't tell...

304
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,542
Don't tell your Master you are hiding here,
right?

305
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:15,788
Right...

306
00:17:15,862 --> 00:17:16,876
So you...

307
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,591
Only Brother Fu was kicked out by Master

308
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,331
You bastard

309
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:22,375
What's happened?

310
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,550
Brother Fu, I don't mean to tell the truth

311
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,306
You always betray me

312
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:26,979
I didn't...

313
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:27,552
Not another word!

314
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:28,714
Follow me

315
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:30,749
Stupid

316
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:32,865
You deserved that!

317
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:35,040
Let's have a look...

318
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:37,434
So spacious!

319
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,830
Will they publish the news about your arrival?

320
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:48,783
Don't say anything without my consent

321
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,870
Siu Mo, come here

322
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:54,699
What's the matter?

323
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:58,496
Look. This word is wrong,

324
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,063
you should write it this way

325
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:01,629
And this paragraph,

326
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:02,751
why not move it down here.

327
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,867
So, it won't be that messy

328
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:04,733
That's the way to print a newspaper

329
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:06,973
Try it

330
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,177
The words are not clear enough

331
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:11,191
Don't be big mouth

332
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:15,058
it's printed on the dress

333
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:19,922
You assaulted Aunt May

334
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,316
Brother Fu, I was about to tell you,
but you didn't...

335
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:23,370
You always betray me,
and now you want to frame me too?

336
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:23,793
You bastard!

337
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:24,236
How dare you set me up?

338
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:25,102
Set up? What set up?

339
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:25,800
What was set up?

340
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:30,564
Fu, you must be insane!

341
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:31,809
Someone is coming

342
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,273
Siu King, open the door

343
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,156
Let me help her to open the door

344
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,247
Miss Siu King, let me open the door for you

345
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:40,704
No, thanks

346
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:41,656
Who is it?

347
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:42,172
Wong Fei Hung

348
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:46,067
Why did Fu react so strangely?

349
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:47,349
Master is coming,

350
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:47,921
hide up now, be quick

351
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,013
Master Wong

352
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,689
Don't tell him that I am here

353
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:54,570
What was the noise about?

354
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,230
Someone wanted to open the door for me

355
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,296
When he heard your name,

356
00:18:57,326 --> 00:18:58,220
he was got scared

357
00:18:58,255 --> 00:18:58,724
and ran away

358
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,222
Does the man have big eyes?

359
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:05,663
Right, that's him

360
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:06,684
And a guy like this

361
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:09,124
He is here too

362
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:10,656
And the other one, like this

363
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:17,720
Let's get out of here!

364
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,570
Brother Fu, your luggage!

365
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:24,723
What's wrong with you?

366
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:25,258
Why shout at me?

367
00:19:26,675 --> 00:19:28,713
Club Foot, hurry up

368
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:30,757
Why shout at me again?!

369
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:35,391
Brother-in-law,

370
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:36,958
have you seen sister to the train station?

371
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:38,631
Where are they?

372
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,773
Stop searching,

373
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:41,241
they left when they saw me

374
00:19:41,956 --> 00:19:44,189
Your sister asked me to take care of you

375
00:19:44,673 --> 00:19:45,908
Sister asked me to take care of you too

376
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,093
Are you hoping sister would come back sooner?

377
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:49,938
I may write to her

378
00:19:51,162 --> 00:19:52,110
What kind of important news is it?

379
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:53,362
Why is it printed on a cloth?

380
00:19:54,581 --> 00:19:56,174
Nothing, look at it yourself

381
00:19:56,976 --> 00:20:00,097
It's an article
about the status of woman in China

382
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:02,023
What kind of status do women have?

383
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,455
So, you only ever think about men?

384
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:10,297
This news agency of sister's is in real trouble

385
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:13,088
Look at the newspapers,
they are all piled up here

386
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:14,421
They never sell,
no one wants to look at them

387
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,796
No matter what we print,
it's useless

388
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:17,463
Someone will take a look at it

389
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:18,579
Who?

390
00:20:18,974 --> 00:20:20,696
They'll give me face if I ask them to take a look

391
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:24,787
Of course! It's too generous of Master Wong

392
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,547
It's a gift from Master Wong, one for everyone

393
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:27,403
Stop fighting over them!

394
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:28,076
Everyone gets one

395
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:29,327
Be careful!

396
00:20:29,364 --> 00:20:32,044
Don't break the things inside

397
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:35,813
What's in the wrapping?

398
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:37,058
Other than a paper, nothing else!

399
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:39,625
It is a newspaper

400
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,467
The more newspapers you read,
the more you will know about the world

401
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:44,060
The more you know,
the more you can achieve

402
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:46,427
Is this sheet of paper that powerful?

403
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:48,352
To be frank, my students and I

404
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,462
come from poor families

405
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:52,305
We want to learn Kung-fu

406
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:53,972
to earn a living

407
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,595
We haven't studied, so we are illiterate

408
00:20:57,141 --> 00:21:00,399
How can we read the newspaper?

409
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,983
What a pity,
they can't show you the respect they want to

410
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,041
The paper is so dirty,
don't use it for wrapping anymore

411
00:21:08,076 --> 00:21:09,568
OK, just once

412
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:12,706
I think, we should start teaching people to read
before operating a newspaper

413
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:15,428
Or, these papers will just be used as wrapping

414
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,640
I wish there were more people
like you in the world

415
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:22,521
Your sister never praised me like this

416
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:27,184
Am I nicer, or is my sister nicer?

417
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:29,642
You are both nice

418
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:41,347
The Ladies of the Red Lantern are coming.

419
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:42,498
Come and take a look

420
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:43,203
The Red Lanterns?

421
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,570
- Let's go and take a look
- OK

422
00:21:47,237 --> 00:21:51,484
"We come from the four seas"

423
00:21:51,713 --> 00:21:53,784
"Our lantern is hung on the

424
00:21:53,823 --> 00:21:55,959
mast to recruit heroes"

425
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:58,514
"Our God sends us the swords"

426
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,499
"The angels change the clouds

427
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:00,752
with their handkerchiefs"

428
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:03,119
"The world, receives our order"

429
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,165
"Our words will be spread forever"

430
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:10,284
"We fear not foreign guns"

431
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:11,462
"For we use wind, fire,

432
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,688
thunder and lightning as weapons"

433
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:16,993
"We are powerful"

434
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,136
"Dressed in red, with little lanterns"

435
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:29,178
"The ladies from the Red Lantern Sect"

436
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:30,194
Juggle!

437
00:23:40,272 --> 00:23:41,451
Expel the foreigners
and strengthen our beloved country

438
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:42,860
Red Lantern shines on the fairies,

439
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:43,948
expel the foreigners,

440
00:23:43,984 --> 00:23:44,611
we are enriched with power

441
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,269
We use holy swords to go against foreign guns

442
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:48,002
A riot over there!

443
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,545
Don't go over there,

444
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:49,268
It's too dangerous

445
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:50,886
I will wait for you right here

446
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:51,492
All right!

447
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:53,694
We have strong will to protect our holy land

448
00:23:54,818 --> 00:23:55,386
Throw the lanterns

449
00:23:59,229 --> 00:23:59,763
Juggle!

450
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:04,274
Hear my order!

451
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,041
Return the holy land to us

452
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,915
Set the altar to hang the lanterns

453
00:24:08,624 --> 00:24:09,416
Expel the foreigners

454
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,433
Mister, please lend me the whip

455
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:15,873
Give way please

456
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:19,914
This is the foreigner’s drugs store

457
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:21,625
Don't kill innocent people

458
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,494
What's the situation?

459
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:30,480
The leased territory is ahead,

460
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:31,604
the foreign troops will be coming soon

461
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,171
Don't go there

462
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:33,095
You'll lose your life if they catch you

463
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:34,412
Have you seen Wong Fei Hung?

464
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:35,084
Master Wong?

465
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:35,849
He must have left

466
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:36,269
Left?

467
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,644
Did you see him leaving?

468
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:44,191
Go!

469
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,367
You are Ladies...

470
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,618
What drives you to kill people and set fires?

471
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:55,531
Don't kill us, we're innocent

472
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:56,273
I've come to save you

473
00:24:56,821 --> 00:24:58,707
They are coming, kill them!

474
00:24:59,027 --> 00:24:59,473
Yes!

475
00:24:59,986 --> 00:25:00,744
Let them go

476
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:03,172
Don't listen to him, attack!

477
00:25:09,862 --> 00:25:10,875
Don't come over here again

478
00:25:20,984 --> 00:25:21,648
You may go now

479
00:25:22,194 --> 00:25:23,887
Go, run for your lives!

480
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:25,325
Who is he?

481
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:26,567
He must be Wong Fei Hung

482
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:44,240
Wong Fei Hung?

483
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,173
Go!

484
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:48,940
Come here

485
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,093
Juggle!

486
00:25:58,887 --> 00:25:59,836
Red Ropes!

487
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,015
Attack

488
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:28,222
The foreigners are coming,

489
00:26:28,258 --> 00:26:28,792
run!

490
00:26:31,104 --> 00:26:32,281
They're over there, fire!

491
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:33,876
Go!

492
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:54,110
Your ladies have all left, why haven't you?

493
00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:00,178
Don't move

494
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:00,802
The lease troops

495
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,960
Take them away, go!

496
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:05,006
Go!

497
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,480
The Red Lantern is showing it's power

498
00:27:06,644 --> 00:27:07,242
Holy Mother

499
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:10,724
Watch out, be careful

500
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:11,498
Yes

501
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:21,372
Have you seen a Chinese
fellow passing by the way you came?

502
00:27:22,688 --> 00:27:23,666
No

503
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:39,811
I think the patient needs more medication

504
00:27:41,736 --> 00:27:42,663
Let me help you

505
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,488
You'll go home soon. Don't cry

506
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:51,842
Miss...

507
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:53,946
We have come to a conclusion,

508
00:27:53,981 --> 00:27:56,076
you should leave this place immediately

509
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,829
All right,

510
00:27:58,866 --> 00:28:00,174
if that will make you feel better

511
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:02,151
I leave now, but...

512
00:28:03,177 --> 00:28:04,779
Maybe you need some more help later

513
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,066
I don't think so. Go

514
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,915
Child, let me help you to open the door

515
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:17,875
Thank you

516
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,035
I saw everything

517
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:22,865
Our Father won't forsake

518
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:24,618
those who devote their lives to others

519
00:28:25,134 --> 00:28:27,436
Father, I hope there is a real God

520
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:29,995
So as to solve the hatred between our nations

521
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,075
Otherwise, we can't escape
from the coming disaster

522
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,371
Don't worry,

523
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:38,522
God has arranged everything

524
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,183
May God bless you

525
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:42,170
Thank you Father

526
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:43,821
Take care

527
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,638
Welcome to our army

528
00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:08,909
Your ancestors sacrificed

529
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,937
themselves in the

530
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:10,740
Anti-Ching movement

531
00:29:12,694 --> 00:29:17,188
This is the 8-colour flag of the Ching army

532
00:29:19,086 --> 00:29:19,850
Lui...

533
00:29:19,886 --> 00:29:21,638
You'll have chance to take revenge
for your ancestors now

534
00:29:57,437 --> 00:29:58,450
Wong

535
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,335
Bravo,

536
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:22,928
I'm General Henlintak

537
00:30:23,131 --> 00:30:24,208
Lui, Wong,

538
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,310
tell the descendants of the Anti-Ching warriors

539
00:30:27,732 --> 00:30:29,583
You have my full support

540
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:30,247
To go against the Ching soldiers

541
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:31,360
who invaded your land

542
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,496
Kill him, kill him

543
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:41,317
You pig

544
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,289
Put him in the cell

545
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,253
Put him in the shithole

546
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,635
Wong Fei Hung

547
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:06,971
Did they torture you?

548
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:10,089
Are you the lady of the Red Lantern?

549
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:15,328
I thought you were allied with them

550
00:31:15,363 --> 00:31:16,674
I'm sorry!

551
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:24,049
We must punish the Chinese rebels
to maintain our interests in China

552
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:28,759
This may also be a warning
to the Chinese government

553
00:31:28,794 --> 00:31:30,938
Moreover the Manchurian government

554
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,536
uses such local organizations

555
00:31:33,571 --> 00:31:35,697
as a protest against us to frighten us

556
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,718
By punishing these people

557
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,328
we can prevent any further disturbances

558
00:31:39,424 --> 00:31:40,935
But this is China

559
00:31:40,936 --> 00:31:46,768
punishing these people will cost us our heads.

560
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:51,510
The armies of the 8 nations
made a pact in Tientsin

561
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:53,825
everything is set for a war
against the Manchurians

562
00:31:57,161 --> 00:32:00,296
Then let us execute the China man tonight

563
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:04,875
Then tomorrow,
display his corpse in the street as an example

564
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:06,627
Yes, General

565
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:15,659
You won't get the chance to compete
with Wong Fei Hung

566
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:19,727
Because they will execute him tonight

567
00:32:22,203 --> 00:32:22,857
Aim...

568
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:23,658
Fire!

569
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:27,563
Kill him!

570
00:32:38,595 --> 00:32:40,120
There's the prisoner

571
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:40,825
Thank you

572
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:47,600
On your feet!

573
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:50,631
Are you Wong Fei Hung?

574
00:32:53,002 --> 00:32:54,374
I am Father Thomas

575
00:32:57,761 --> 00:32:59,707
I am sorry to have to bring you some bad news

576
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:03,986
You will be executed by the Germans
in an hour's time

577
00:33:04,022 --> 00:33:04,653
Wong Fei Hung

578
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:06,061
Executed?

579
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,730
You devil,
you will be punished by Heaven

580
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:11,245
My child...

581
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:15,073
There is only one God who can save you

582
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:24,712
It's the God, who gave me this holy clothing

583
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,468
So they won't suspect me

584
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:43,532
Father, you should leave now

585
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:50,398
Open the door

586
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,854
Get up

587
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:56,848
Father, stay back

588
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:04,870
Catch him

589
00:34:50,217 --> 00:34:50,716
Catch!

590
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:56,903
My child.. Wait

591
00:34:58,253 --> 00:34:59,397
I want you to help me

592
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:00,764
You must knock me unconscious too

593
00:35:01,352 --> 00:35:01,982
Sorry to have to hurt you

594
00:35:02,023 --> 00:35:02,525
Let me do it

595
00:35:06,752 --> 00:35:07,323
Why did you punch so heavily?

596
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:08,472
Not to make them suspect him

597
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:11,823
Don't hit him anymore

598
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:12,460
It's enough already

599
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:13,465
Go!

600
00:35:14,717 --> 00:35:15,284
Hurry up

601
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,252
Thank you for reporting

602
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:20,177
Your Excellency, please

603
00:35:22,192 --> 00:35:22,693
Your Excellency

604
00:35:22,832 --> 00:35:23,909
Master Wong, please get up

605
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:29,593
What?

606
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:31,226
Wong Fei Hung is missing?

607
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,061
Yes, Your Excellency,

608
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,634
we saw the parade of the Red Lanterns

609
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:38,162
Then I was separated from my brother,
he hasn't come back yet

610
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:41,006
The capital is in such a mess

611
00:35:41,582 --> 00:35:43,868
The foreigners are going against the boxers

612
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:45,658
It's not wise to get any side angry

613
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:47,708
On one hand,
the foreigners want us to protect them,

614
00:35:48,035 --> 00:35:48,797
on the other hand,

615
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:50,426
The Empress Dowager wants us
to overlook the matter

616
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,796
Ah Fu

617
00:35:52,028 --> 00:35:52,511
What?

618
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:54,982
Do you think Master is doing this
to draw you out of hiding?

619
00:35:55,095 --> 00:35:56,303
Master knows I am clever,

620
00:35:56,341 --> 00:35:57,517
so he's using this method

621
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:58,446
to force me out

622
00:35:58,641 --> 00:35:59,685
This method is quite new

623
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,052
No, brother Fu, Master needn't use
so many people to look for you

624
00:36:03,087 --> 00:36:04,643
Just Club Foot and I were enough

625
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,463
You can shut up!

626
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,180
If you hadn't let Aunt May know,

627
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,459
how would Master have suspected me
of staying in the capital?

628
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:16,300
Fu, behave yourself

629
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:19,240
Don't worry too much

630
00:36:19,948 --> 00:36:21,980
I will try my best to find Fei Hung for you

631
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:22,944
Thank you, Your Excellency

632
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:23,927
Your Excellency,

633
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:28,653
Fei Hung might be in the hands
of the Red Lanterns

634
00:36:30,851 --> 00:36:32,015
Ho Lan

635
00:36:32,129 --> 00:36:32,954
Your Excellency

636
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:35,626
Get some information on the Red Lanterns

637
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:36,312
Yes!

638
00:36:36,547 --> 00:36:38,484
Are there many ladies from the Red Lanterns

639
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:39,542
Maybe

640
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:43,322
I think, Wong Fei Hung
may have been caught by the German Army

641
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,503
I have to check it out myself

642
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,379
Your Excellency, let me go with you

643
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:55,506
On this matter, it's better for the officials
to discuss among themselves

644
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:57,675
Please don't worry

645
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:02,267
My office carries some weight in the capital

646
00:37:03,427 --> 00:37:04,959
It's bad luck staying with you two

647
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:07,449
One is as dumb as a stone

648
00:37:07,484 --> 00:37:08,914
The other betrays me

649
00:37:09,573 --> 00:37:12,633
Don't you think the street is
quieter than usual

650
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:15,864
You are just more aware

651
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:16,663
Really?

652
00:37:19,412 --> 00:37:20,141
What's happened?

653
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:23,018
Have we come to the wrong place,
it's all red

654
00:37:33,787 --> 00:37:34,515
The Red Lanterns shine,

655
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,427
here come the ladies

656
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,815
My dear fellows,
kneel down for worshipping

657
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:42,902
They're the Red Lantern ladies,
what beauties

658
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:44,583
I am going to kneel, kneel

659
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:47,162
Brother Fu, are you insane?

660
00:37:47,193 --> 00:37:48,979
Not that simple!
Should we kneel down too?

661
00:37:49,014 --> 00:37:50,838
I failed in courting Aunt Yee

662
00:37:50,873 --> 00:37:52,553
Now, I've got so many choices!

663
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:54,233
You'd better let me choose first

664
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:56,298
I'm Leung Fu,

665
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,293
I'm strong and considerate

666
00:37:58,328 --> 00:38:00,941
and I know how to make a lady happy
if you get my meaning

667
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,730
How dare you!
I want to know where Wong Fei Hung is

668
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:06,986
Haven't you caught Wong Fei Hung?

669
00:38:07,581 --> 00:38:11,162
How can this guy claim to be
the greatest Kung-fu master?

670
00:38:11,197 --> 00:38:14,744
He conspired with the foreigners
and locked our senior up

671
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:15,948
Fei Hung is not that kind of person

672
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:17,649
Don't you dare accuse him!

673
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:19,556
Do you think I'll believe what you say?

674
00:38:20,238 --> 00:38:23,528
Don't you want me to believe he's not involved
because he's in hiding?

675
00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:25,671
Follow me to our main hall

676
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,261
Let's see how long will stay hidden

677
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,596
Lady, don't be so stubborn

678
00:38:29,629 --> 00:38:32,116
We don't know what happened either

679
00:38:32,696 --> 00:38:33,304
How dare you!

680
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:35,627
It's you who refuses to listen to the truth

681
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:36,974
Burn the house

682
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:37,997
Burn the house?

683
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:39,620
Be careful of the lanterns

684
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:40,914
They won't have a chance to use them!

685
00:38:45,336 --> 00:38:47,189
Let's get the leader first

686
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:48,511
I don't think so

687
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:50,741
Watch out!

688
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:51,926
My feet!

689
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,157
Escape from him

690
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:15,944
The Red Lantern Shines

691
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:19,804
Brother Fu,

692
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:20,379
let me handle this

693
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:21,980
She is too tall for you

694
00:39:22,468 --> 00:39:23,265
Go and fetch a shorter one next time

695
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:28,381
No need to make it look good,
they can't see us

696
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:29,660
You act like you mean it!

697
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:35,828
Lady, why do you always attack my feet?

698
00:39:36,092 --> 00:39:36,823
Burn your crude mouth!

699
00:39:38,364 --> 00:39:39,094
Like that is it?

700
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:39,992
Let's see how you like it

701
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,423
Are you excited?

702
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,855
But you're trying not to show it!

703
00:39:47,894 --> 00:39:48,842
Come on...

704
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,960
Is this dirty stance taught
by Wong Fei Hung?

705
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:56,071
Wong Fei Hung is not as smart as me

706
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,030
Some more

707
00:40:03,086 --> 00:40:04,133
Red ropes

708
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:05,064
Let me catch them

709
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:10,916
It hurts!

710
00:40:18,117 --> 00:40:18,683
Amazing Lantern

711
00:40:18,758 --> 00:40:19,240
Catch it

712
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:20,319
Master, let me help you

713
00:40:31,038 --> 00:40:31,703
Blow the powder off!

714
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:36,379
Why are you lying down?

715
00:40:37,817 --> 00:40:39,411
That was a stupid idea

716
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:40,498
Come on

717
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:47,790
What...

718
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:54,761
So many people

719
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:55,830
Yan!

720
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:57,388
Master!

721
00:40:57,972 --> 00:40:58,389
Club Foot!

722
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,454
Club Foot is missing too

723
00:41:01,485 --> 00:41:04,327
Master, only you can save me

724
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:23,751
Your Excellency

725
00:41:23,752 --> 00:41:24,752
What can I do for you?

726
00:41:26,163 --> 00:41:29,299
I'd like to see Ambassador Henlintak
concerning Wong Fei Hung

727
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:34,102
Your Excellency,
I've never heard of Wong Fei Hung

728
00:41:34,355 --> 00:41:35,897
In the German Territory,

729
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,750
no one is allowed to interfere
with our judiciary system

730
00:41:38,817 --> 00:41:39,860
You imprisoned him without reason

731
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:42,548
It's my duty to protect him

732
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:44,849
Don't you know the leasing terms?

733
00:41:44,884 --> 00:41:46,415
It's an agreement between China and Germany

734
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:47,984
Change it if you want to

735
00:41:48,627 --> 00:41:52,131
Otherwise, settle it with another war

736
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:53,239
Damn it!

737
00:42:20,158 --> 00:42:20,961
What barbarians!

738
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:23,471
Now, even you should follow our judiciary system

739
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,855
I don't think war between us
can be avoided anymore

740
00:42:28,094 --> 00:42:30,105
Indeed, the war will start tomorrow

741
00:42:30,397 --> 00:42:31,159
Our lions are well prepared

742
00:42:31,196 --> 00:42:32,663
to fight with your dragons in the Square!

743
00:42:32,764 --> 00:42:34,897
You will find out whose system is the best

744
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:38,222
Fine,

745
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:41,198
I will come for the race!

746
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:43,121
You will be the losers, for sure

747
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:45,873
Your Excellency,

748
00:42:45,907 --> 00:42:46,857
What about Wong Fei Hung?

749
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:49,763
I don't think they'll dare harm him

750
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:51,048
Let's go back

751
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:01,670
What the hell happened?

752
00:43:03,946 --> 00:43:05,320
Holy Light shines

753
00:43:05,877 --> 00:43:08,100
It must be a trial of the Cantonese Association!

754
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:10,429
Why would we be on trial?

755
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:14,877
The main hall of the Red Lanterns!

756
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:16,699
Isn't this your main hall?

757
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:17,565
Yes

758
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:20,363
We are divided into
Red Lanterns, Blue Lanterns and Green Lanterns

759
00:43:20,386 --> 00:43:21,813
This is our head quarters

760
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:24,049
And this is where we
execute the foreigners too

761
00:43:24,926 --> 00:43:26,263
I won't care what it is,
I have to go in

762
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:31,794
Wong Fei Hung

763
00:43:37,271 --> 00:43:38,734
Return my country and my power

764
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:40,653
I fear no fire or knives

765
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:44,687
The Heaven's troops come
to expel the foreigners

766
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:46,152
We will sacrifice our lives
for our beloved country!

767
00:43:46,451 --> 00:43:47,399
Lady Miu San is taking

768
00:43:47,442 --> 00:43:49,383
Wong Fei Hung to greet our Holy Mother

769
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:51,370
I am Wong Fei Hung,

770
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:52,939
I come to look for my family and students

771
00:43:53,454 --> 00:43:55,490
If you know where they are, please let me know

772
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:59,332
Burn the incense for our Holy Mother

773
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:00,836
Lady Miu San is leading

774
00:44:00,874 --> 00:44:03,166
Wong Fei Hung to greet the Holy Mother

775
00:44:04,553 --> 00:44:05,894
To enter our main hall,

776
00:44:05,928 --> 00:44:07,236
you must go through the

777
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:08,219
Green Lantern Position first

778
00:44:08,581 --> 00:44:09,409
You will pass the 1st test

779
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:11,103
only if your feet don't touch the ground

780
00:44:11,973 --> 00:44:12,419
Please!

781
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:14,428
All right, thank you

782
00:44:43,443 --> 00:44:43,911
Go down

783
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:54,708
I've kicked them all over

784
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,321
Can you still stand?

785
00:45:04,808 --> 00:45:05,373
Return to normal position

786
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:15,491
Thank you

787
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:25,262
Blue Lantern Position, please try

788
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:27,385
How do I pass it?

789
00:45:27,866 --> 00:45:29,241
This is the Whirl Position
designed by the Blue Lanterns

790
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,831
Cross this big revolving lantern

791
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:32,177
But you can't tear any of the paper

792
00:45:32,504 --> 00:45:34,004
If you can go through it safely,
then you've passed

793
00:45:35,053 --> 00:45:35,528
Thank you

794
00:45:35,893 --> 00:45:36,428
Watch out

795
00:45:58,474 --> 00:45:58,887
Take it

796
00:46:15,137 --> 00:46:15,581
Ether powder?!

797
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,461
Lady Miu, why are you here to fight with me?

798
00:46:51,821 --> 00:46:54,031
If you want to go out, fight with me

799
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:03,291
Senior

800
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,271
Give me the sword

801
00:47:11,394 --> 00:47:11,960
Lady Miu

802
00:47:12,673 --> 00:47:14,582
We work for our own master, go now

803
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:15,821
Thank you

804
00:47:18,206 --> 00:47:19,067
Senior

805
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:20,848
I am fine, don't worry

806
00:47:26,073 --> 00:47:26,555
Fei Hung

807
00:47:26,874 --> 00:47:27,539
Master

808
00:47:28,185 --> 00:47:30,348
Dad, Club Foot,
are you all right?

809
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:31,663
We are fine

810
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:32,725
Master, save us

811
00:47:33,525 --> 00:47:34,191
Fu

812
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:34,990
Haven't you gone back to Fu-Shan?

813
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:36,946
You're so mean

814
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:38,951
The candles are red

815
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:40,014
The heroes come from the

816
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:40,911
local organizations

817
00:47:41,296 --> 00:47:42,158
Flying phoenix

818
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,207
from the poles

819
00:47:43,249 --> 00:47:45,004
The dragon is kept in the cabin

820
00:47:48,557 --> 00:47:51,686
The Holy Mother is right here

821
00:47:51,915 --> 00:47:53,737
Poor fellows,
kneel down to worship the Holy Mother

822
00:47:54,506 --> 00:47:55,716
Are you Goddess Lotus?

823
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:57,704
My family has not offended you.

824
00:47:57,736 --> 00:47:58,434
Why did you kidnap them?

825
00:47:59,111 --> 00:47:59,939
Please let them go

826
00:48:02,533 --> 00:48:03,610
Stepping on the Heaven's ladder

827
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:12,409
Master, what kind of Kung-fu is it?
She can fly!

828
00:48:13,152 --> 00:48:14,011
It's just some tricks!

829
00:48:14,623 --> 00:48:16,665
Our country is in trouble,
everyone is responsible for her safety

830
00:48:16,765 --> 00:48:19,598
You should carry the duty
to expel the foreign devils

831
00:48:19,645 --> 00:48:22,808
I think you should join us and be the boxers

832
00:48:25,432 --> 00:48:26,806
Join the boxers?

833
00:48:28,663 --> 00:48:32,596
I've no relationship with any God or ghosts.
I think, you'd better seek help from others

834
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:34,001
Wong Fei Hung,

835
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,345
why are you so stubborn?

836
00:48:36,076 --> 00:48:38,083
I have to punish you on behalf of our God

837
00:48:38,738 --> 00:48:39,500
The paper troops,

838
00:48:39,537 --> 00:48:40,268
listen to my order

839
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:40,819
Juggle

840
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:04,740
Do you think such tricks can save our country?

841
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,243
Do you want me to set them free?
It's simple

842
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,980
If you can pass through my
holy tower and holy bridge.

843
00:49:09,025 --> 00:49:09,853
I will let your men go

844
00:49:09,919 --> 00:49:11,381
If not...
You must follow me

845
00:49:13,378 --> 00:49:13,641
Well,

846
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:14,236
I have to offend you then

847
00:49:25,971 --> 00:49:27,309
Walk on the holy ladder
