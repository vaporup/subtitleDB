1
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,681
This jade imperial seal was stolen
from thief ghost by kung

2
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:16,155
to present to the city master.

3
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:19,358
There is also a rumour amongst
the kung-fu world.

4
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:21,293
That imperial agent dragon 9
is searching for him.

5
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:29,661
Good.

6
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:34,832
Then l will make a gift of this seal
and return it to its owner.

7
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:13,882
We only see our three dumb brothers
in Tianshan.

8
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:15,507
lt is boring us to death.

9
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:19,580
The smell of snow just fallen
is really good.

10
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:20,721
Oh really?

11
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:21,983
Oh, yes!

12
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:24,088
Smells quite good.

13
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:26,887
That's enough. You won't be able
to smell of a man anyway.

14
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,454
Big sister, who are you laughing at?

15
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:32,230
Among the four of us, you flirt the most

16
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:34,164
when you see young masters on the street

17
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:37,068
you just stare
without blinking your eyes.

18
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,140
Who said it?

19
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:41,132
l just want to meet more friends.

20
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:43,037
Don't be shy!

21
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,373
We are normal girls.

22
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:47,347
lt's just normal to want
to meet our Prince Charming.

23
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:48,974
What's so funny?

24
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:50,979
That's right! Ziqing is most frank!

25
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:52,554
OK

26
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:57,316
My second sister, of all the masters,
who do you want to meet most?

27
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:01,821
Simon the snow blower.

28
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:04,597
Simon the snow blower?

29
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:07,565
The one who kills and
spills no drop of blood.

30
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:09,634
l heard he is very difficult to approach.

31
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:12,241
No. l would say he is very dangerous.

32
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,172
So l've heard too
there are lots of legends about him.

33
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:20,605
They say he is the god of swords,
a unification of man and sword.

34
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:25,713
l am very curious and want to know
if he is really that dangerous.

35
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,183
That's better, so he doesn't practice
the book of the sunflower.

36
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:30,290
What does that mean?

37
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:34,057
You really don't know?

38
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,490
Do tell me quick.

39
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:37,692
The book of the sunflower...

40
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:40,998
Ok, l'll tell you alone.

41
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:51,678
That's enough, you bitch,
don't talk nonsense.

42
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:52,609
lt's true!

43
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:55,576
Master!

44
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,750
Of the seven sons of tianshan,
l've only brought the four of you down.

45
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,723
My aim is to preserve justice
and arrest thief ghost.

46
00:05:04,494 --> 00:05:07,588
l have heard that
the biggest suspect is coming uphill.

47
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,322
Who is this suspect?

48
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:10,631
Dragon 9

49
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:14,331
He has a dual status.
He is the thief ghost.

50
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:15,863
Go get ready.

51
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,197
Yes, Master!

52
00:05:20,543 --> 00:05:22,170
l never thought...

53
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:23,904
...there'd be such a refined tea-house
in such wilderness.

54
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:25,443
Great

55
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:27,906
Waiter!
Coming!

56
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:33,249
Sir, what would you like to drink?

57
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:39,884
The "daughter Red",
as red as your cheeks, you have it?

58
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:41,896
Of course!

59
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:47,336
Good! you look fecund.

60
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:48,836
Good!

61
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:54,165
Pardon me, my hand slipped.

62
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:06,580
Good wine!

63
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:33,142
Oh, who would have thought
you have put poison in the wine!

64
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,252
l am Lin yunhe of the tianshan Clan.

65
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:48,225
Today l am going to do justice
and capture the thief ghost.

66
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:53,391
l am not the thief ghost!
you wronged me...

67
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:55,666
Four sons, go ahead! yes!

68
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:56,737
Hold it!

69
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:17,985
You Lin yunhe are the real thief ghost.

70
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:21,219
You use your status as leader
of the tianshan Clan to hide your crime.

71
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:24,895
You leave your big bum pupils alone!

72
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:26,797
Cut the bullshit! Go ahead!

73
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:28,634
Oh... shit!

74
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:45,717
Wow! Big bum. l like it!

75
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,603
Kill him! Yes!

76
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:23,951
You can bear children but not kill...

77
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:27,357
Go!

78
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:35,197
What a big snow ball,
l need girl but not ball.

79
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:49,746
Master!

80
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:50,853
Go away!

81
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:53,878
Why don't you come tomorrow?

82
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:58,225
l have long wanted
to test your sword skills.

83
00:08:58,628 --> 00:08:59,560
Live or die?

84
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:00,353
Big!

85
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:01,789
Live

86
00:09:12,642 --> 00:09:13,336
Master...

87
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,405
Sister!

88
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,812
You use your disciples as your shield!
How despicable!

89
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:28,314
Sister...

90
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:18,540
Hey! don't just keep courting women!

91
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:20,868
l want to fly!

92
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:21,999
Where do you want to fly?

93
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:24,101
Where can you fly?

94
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:29,648
What are you shouting?

95
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:31,413
l am going with you!

96
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:33,380
lt's not that easy!

97
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:52,365
l can get everything.

98
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:54,203
Even the Monkey king.

99
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:44,154
l like your rudeness.

100
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:51,065
Hey, here comes another adulterer, you!

101
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,062
You always take advantage
of me with your words.

102
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:56,171
lf you are smart enough, marry me.

103
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:57,235
Why should l marry you?

104
00:11:57,373 --> 00:12:00,536
lt's better to go to the corner
at the wall and do a little caressing.

105
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:03,304
Come along! Come!

106
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,073
What's wrong?
Last time you said l was great.

107
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:08,449
l am not going to play with you!

108
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:11,813
The minister is afraid you might take
the blame and not finish the mission.

109
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:14,855
Have l ever failed in my missions?

110
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:15,785
Where is he?

111
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:18,853
He is waiting for you
with dragon 6 and dragon 7.

112
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:21,827
l will go in and find them,
then come back to you.

113
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:27,065
l have only been away
for a while and you look awful!

114
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,663
How can l kiss with you
as your teeth are dirty.

115
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:38,538
We are getting short of people.

116
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:42,310
lt is in critical moments that
we realize the more people the better.

117
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:44,813
l really miss dragon Fat (8)

118
00:12:46,155 --> 00:12:51,149
too bad, he has now become
the god of the foods.

119
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:53,759
lf you miss him so much,
l let you see him.

120
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:54,988
"Fat Choy"!

121
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:57,562
We have three out of four.

122
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,328
We almost died without you here
to fill the place. "Red sword"!

123
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,264
l win!

124
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:04,536
It's "thirteen odds"!

125
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:08,632
lmperial Agent! lt's only a beautiful
name. We can't really live on the salary.

126
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:10,302
lf you don't help me a bit,
l'll be broke.

127
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:12,979
You even win the "thirteen odds", aren't
you afraid of being denounced by god?

128
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:14,580
You will lose your good luck one day.

129
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:18,910
l just got rid of the thief ghost,
do l have to be scared of losing my luck?

130
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:22,957
Minister, be careful of what you play.

131
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,489
lf you let him win, l have to pay, too.

132
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:26,185
You are his left player and
you don't watch him out.

133
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:28,422
You are also to be blamed!

134
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:33,933
What's this?

135
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:37,102
This is a western telescope.

136
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,632
Best used to peek on others.

137
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:39,832
Let me have a look okay

138
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:44,137
lt really works!

139
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,306
This invention was left here
by the ltalian Marco Polo.

140
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,078
You can even use it to zoom.
Can we have wide angle?

141
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:51,251
You try it

142
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:52,911
Can you see any woman in the bath?

143
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:55,420
Yes! l see one, it's your mom!

144
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:56,352
Shit!

145
00:13:58,227 --> 00:13:59,251
lt's really a woman!

146
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:04,028
Here's the mouth, big eyes...

147
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:07,402
What are you peeking? Want to die?

148
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:12,600
So it's the loose-tongued on
a close look and Princess Phoenix

149
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:13,766
with three mouths on a far look.

150
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:16,668
so it's four eyebrows on a far look

151
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:18,780
and a dumb face on a close look!

152
00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:21,942
why don't the four of you engage
in some self-criticism?

153
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:26,487
Playing mahjong during office hours
you want me to inform the emperor?

154
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:27,747
then...

155
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:30,048
your highness Princess Phoenix
Please mind your tongue...

156
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:32,055
No, l mean please be lenient
to us in what you say

157
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:34,194
ok, give this to me then

158
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:35,591
No... give it to me!

159
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:36,425
No...

160
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:41,831
she is being destructive again

161
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:45,162
she has broken the telescope

162
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:51,535
Princess Phoenix, l heard that
you are practicing on Mount Holy girl

163
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,806
How come today...

164
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:55,615
Me! My master said that l have
learned all her martial arts already

165
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:57,013
so l come back

166
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,417
so there would be chaos
in the palace from now on

167
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,550
dragon 9, you making fun of me?

168
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:06,558
l wasn't talking about you

169
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:08,788
It's... him only

170
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:13,558
dragon 7, any new inventions lately?

171
00:15:13,903 --> 00:15:14,870
yes, your Highness!

172
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:16,904
we have just set up a creative group

173
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,701
we just have a new invention,
the flying kite

174
00:15:19,842 --> 00:15:21,776
dragon 9 has tried it, it's quite good

175
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:23,405
depends on who sits on it

176
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,979
we have a great creative group

177
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:29,642
Members include they are,
dragon 1, dragon 2...

178
00:15:29,785 --> 00:15:32,015
dragon 3 and dragon 4

179
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:33,178
And l am the convener

180
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:36,418
so these are
the four world-famous dragon 1 to 4

181
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,426
who use to scare the hell out
of the bad guys

182
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:40,786
that's right

183
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:45,864
but who knows what sacrifices
we have to make in this business!

184
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:49,671
Look at him
once brilliant and handsome...

185
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:52,330
and now, all that is left
is a pair of silent eyes

186
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
nothing more!

187
00:15:55,077 --> 00:15:57,807
Look at dragon 2,
seems to be strong and reliable

188
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:01,940
but then, he is only a limp

189
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:04,318
l don't need to explain
about the third one

190
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:06,453
Poor broken arm!

191
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:08,051
And the fourth is...

192
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,657
He...

193
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:11,687
He can't be dragon 4?

194
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:13,690
He used to be 180cm tall and
weighed 200 odd catties

195
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,688
l was beaten and had internal wounds
l have shrunken to this size

196
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:21,061
there's still the fifth!
He's disappeared for one year

197
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:23,068
we put in a lot of ads looking for him

198
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:25,036
From central to local,
searched everywhere

199
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:26,971
but still no sign of him

200
00:16:27,443 --> 00:16:31,106
that's why all the complicated cases
are now handled by me alone

201
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:34,874
dragon 9!
Have you forgotten this "great Umbrella"

202
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:38,043
that has been with you
through life and death?

203
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:39,447
Princess, this is the latest product

204
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:42,756
"great Umbrella"!
there's two buttons here!

205
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:44,792
don't push!

206
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,993
l told you not to do that

207
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:54,629
the great Umbrella has 82 uses

208
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,699
the gun is only one of them

209
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:57,601
Really?

210
00:16:58,741 --> 00:16:59,469
Let me try this button

211
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:00,370
Hey! No!

212
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:07,676
the second function
of the great Umbrella is

213
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:10,649
to shoot out 49 pins
in the shortest time

214
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:13,311
this function is named
the "Fairy Maiden's spike shower"

215
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:15,280
l like this one!

216
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:18,791
so what if you like it
this was made specially for me

217
00:17:18,928 --> 00:17:19,656
give it back!

218
00:17:19,795 --> 00:17:20,318
l want it

219
00:17:20,462 --> 00:17:21,429
give it back!

220
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:22,963
l want it! give it back!

221
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:24,588
give me! l want it!

222
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:26,667
don't fright for that

223
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:29,430
don't do that, it's messed up

224
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:30,797
Hand off

225
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,408
she is princess
you'll be damned if you hurt her

226
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:36,238
No, don't

227
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:39,003
Minister, there are a lot of invaders
in the square

228
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:40,475
who have the guts to step in here!

229
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:42,049
l'll go and have a look

230
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:32,522
who's there?

231
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:34,562
what a nice
"Hovering Heavenly Fairy" stance

232
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,797
you are really learned

233
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:40,774
you must be dragon 9 with four eyebrows

234
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,273
there's no one except
white Cloud City Master Cool-son yeh

235
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:47,746
who can strike such a powerful stance
in the kung-fu world

236
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:49,041
Cool-son yeh?

237
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:52,985
Royal Uncle Pingnan, it's me, Phoenix!

238
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,958
so you've grown up,
you know how to address people now

239
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,591
Everyone grows up

240
00:18:59,828 --> 00:19:01,728
one can't always be a kid

241
00:19:02,197 --> 00:19:05,291
ln my heart,
you will always be a small girl

242
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,092
yes, she's not even weaned

243
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:15,208
Uncle Pingnan, what are you doing here?

244
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:16,641
l'm here for two matters

245
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:21,312
the first is already written on the wall

246
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:26,984
Heavenly Cool son,
like a fairy swordsman

247
00:19:27,423 --> 00:19:30,119
Fifteenth the first month,
moon shines like the sun

248
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:33,627
we fight just this once,
atop the City Forbidden

249
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:37,931
l don't get it

250
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,927
ls simon the snow blower your friend?

251
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:44,028
of course not
He is my very very very good friend!

252
00:19:44,673 --> 00:19:47,403
Please pass on these six phrases to him

253
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,672
lf anyone of you here is a friend
of simon the snow blower

254
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:56,349
l welcome you to pass on my message

255
00:19:57,186 --> 00:20:00,713
lf you want to fight in the palace,
it's difficult to explain to the Emperor

256
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:03,017
simon the snow blower and
me are regarded...

257
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:05,217
as "god of sword" and "sword saint"

258
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:08,728
such a sacred fight must be fought
in the noblest place

259
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,760
l think it is a bit difficult

260
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:16,598
tell your friend not to be late

261
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:21,207
Cool-son yeh,
you said you are here for two matters?

262
00:20:21,343 --> 00:20:22,810
what's the other one?

263
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:25,375
the thief ghost stole
the Jade lmperial seal from the Emperor

264
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:28,680
lt's now with me

265
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:32,315
and l want to return it to the owner

266
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:35,915
I heard that your "buddha's Pointer"

267
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:38,322
Can catch any weapon in the world

268
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:40,121
you think you can catch this?

269
00:20:55,577 --> 00:20:56,566
thank you!

270
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:02,875
that's really an ace

271
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,097
your Majesty

272
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:23,233
this Jade lmperial seal
has been returned by Master of Pingnan

273
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:26,372
the imperial seal passed down
by ancestors, lost and found

274
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:28,476
Congratulations!

275
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,477
Uncle Pingnan is highly skilled
in martial arts

276
00:21:32,614 --> 00:21:34,479
and he is also loyal to me

277
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,078
l am thinking
what l should give him in return

278
00:21:38,754 --> 00:21:42,383
brother, why don't you ask him to come
to the palace to teach me martial arts?

279
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:44,224
lf you call that a gift it's worse...

280
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,849
then asking him to kneel on glass
as a penalty

281
00:21:46,128 --> 00:21:48,255
How dare you be so rude to me
in front of my brother!

282
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:49,694
l don't dare

283
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:54,025
the Powerful Four are
all gathered here today

284
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:56,069
you must have something to tell me

285
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:57,672
ls that right, Manager Liu?

286
00:21:58,073 --> 00:21:59,597
you are so wise, your Majesty!

287
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:02,436
your Majesty,
Master of Pingnan Cool-soon yeh...

288
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:04,011
has send a letter inviting
simon the snow blower

289
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:09,448
to have a fight with him on the 15th
January on top of the Forbidden City

290
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:11,510
Just up above?

291
00:22:12,421 --> 00:22:13,547
this could be fun!

292
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:16,015
your Majesty, this is outrageous

293
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:18,626
who cares if he is Master of Pingnan
or the best swordman

294
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:21,489
this cannot be allowed!

295
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:24,598
A fight between two great masters,
it's a rare occasion

296
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:28,100
lf l stop it,
it will disappoint everyone

297
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,033
so your Majesty want to print
some tickets to earn some money?

298
00:22:33,742 --> 00:22:36,575
Jin guangda, with the men you have

299
00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:38,646
how many can you let into the palace?

300
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:42,809
with the number of men in the palace,
only eight

301
00:22:43,218 --> 00:22:43,980
okay then

302
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:47,188
l will issue eight gold medals
with a special sign

303
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:49,984
whoever holds this medal
can enter the palace

304
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,150
but there're millions of great masters
in the kung-fu world

305
00:22:52,294 --> 00:22:52,851
and only eight medals

306
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:54,860
who is to decide
to whom these medals are to be given?

307
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:56,123
you!

308
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:57,992
Hey! you...

309
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:08,104
dragon 9! tell me

310
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:11,576
who is going to win between
simon the snow blower and Cool-son yeh?

311
00:23:11,847 --> 00:23:14,042
tell me! don't go!

312
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:16,548
tell me, please...

313
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:19,510
Hey! don't go!

314
00:23:25,294 --> 00:23:27,592
l am an lmperial Agent, l am famous

315
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:28,726
lf you pull me on a big street...

316
00:23:28,864 --> 00:23:33,301
and l fall down in the new year,
what face do l have?

317
00:23:33,535 --> 00:23:36,561
then why don't you just tell me
who is going to win?

318
00:23:36,905 --> 00:23:37,769
tell me!

319
00:23:41,243 --> 00:23:42,175
you tell me!

320
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:45,912
l'm asking you, tell me quick!

321
00:23:46,448 --> 00:23:47,380
one is my good friend

322
00:23:47,516 --> 00:23:49,450
one is a senior in the kung-fu world
l admire...

323
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:53,781
lt must be Royal Uncle Pingnan

324
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:54,986
why?

325
00:23:55,857 --> 00:23:57,882
He's cool! He has personality

326
00:23:58,226 --> 00:23:59,921
l believe
there is no one who can beat...

327
00:24:00,062 --> 00:24:02,622
...his "Hovering Heavenly Fairy" stance

328
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:08,169
don't go! you still not answer me

329
00:24:08,337 --> 00:24:10,202
you're bad! you're so shameless!

330
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:13,003
Please tell me who will win!

331
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:16,505
lf you follow me

332
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:18,545
l will deal with you here!

333
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,348
oh! dare you to bully me?

334
00:24:21,483 --> 00:24:22,507
How can you do that?

335
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:26,046
you are the princess,
how dare l bully you?

336
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:28,554
you have also learned all the kung-fu,
l can't fight you then

337
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:33,055
How about that? grab two eunuchs and
use a candle to burn their ass

338
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:34,025
that could be fun!

339
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:35,456
l don't want to play that!

340
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:37,890
you tell me who is going to win first?

341
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:39,227
Cool-son or simon?

342
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:40,733
l have important things to do?

343
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:42,200
l'll answer you when l come back, okay?

344
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:43,668
okay. Let's go

345
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:45,838
don't follow me! Hey!...

346
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:49,043
you are so irritating! Please

347
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:11,928
l've been busy!

348
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,202
l know you are busy,
so l dare not find you

349
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:18,329
l only miss you everyday

350
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:20,941
Actually, l have written a letter

351
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,142
Let me see

352
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:27,211
No. l am afraid you will look down on me

353
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:28,711
l will only be touched

354
00:25:29,418 --> 00:25:31,386
How about that... you read it out to me

355
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,751
No...

356
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,591
lf you say no, l'll never miss you

357
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:45,024
okay, but you mustn't laugh at me

358
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:51,971
brother 9, haven't seen you for days,
l miss you very much

359
00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:52,937
you know

360
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:54,600
l'm not a scholar

361
00:25:54,743 --> 00:25:57,211
so l don't know what to say

362
00:25:57,813 --> 00:25:59,508
Am l a fool?

363
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:02,884
l just wish you would come
to see me soon

364
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:06,953
Lastly, l wish you
all the best luck and longevity

365
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:08,219
that's it

366
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:16,421
this is the most touching love letter
l have ever read

367
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:17,964
Really?

368
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:20,358
you take it?

369
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:23,064
total charge 50 taels

370
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:24,864
50 taels?

371
00:26:25,107 --> 00:26:26,039
you give to me?

372
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:28,105
we have played this two times already

373
00:26:28,243 --> 00:26:30,871
Last time l cried severely, this time
there's only two drops of tears

374
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,846
shall we play something new
and more exciting?

375
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:35,274
what shall we play then?

376
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:38,516
l heard there is a mouth trick spreading
around among the people

377
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:39,449
seems to be great fun

378
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:40,145
lt's called...

379
00:26:40,288 --> 00:26:41,346
what's that?

380
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,684
It's called "Ice Fire", you understand?

381
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:45,552
you are bad!

382
00:26:45,694 --> 00:26:47,252
No, we'll play another!

383
00:26:48,163 --> 00:26:49,289
okay, we won't play "Ice Fire"

384
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:53,060
we'll play crossed pair cards,
or zigzag arrows...

385
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:55,635
you bad boy! you play with someone else!

386
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:56,833
disgusting!

387
00:26:59,274 --> 00:27:00,138
what's this thing?

388
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:01,837
lt's so long?

389
00:27:02,677 --> 00:27:05,908
you hurt my skin,
but you still haven't touched my flesh

390
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,617
so if you think this is not new,
we'll play some brain games

391
00:27:14,756 --> 00:27:16,417
don't you know l am the lmperial Agent?

392
00:27:16,658 --> 00:27:19,752
l've solved numerous mysterious,
l'm called the god of Logic

393
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:21,328
you play these games with me?

394
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:22,857
okay, l'll play with you
Ask me a question

395
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:24,565
okay, l test you

396
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,427
A woman has two limbs for the arm
and two limbs for the legs,

397
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:28,968
that's four limbs

398
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:31,665
so how many limbs do men have?

399
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,734
of course they have five limbs

400
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,876
so when you add a man and a woman,
how many limbs are there?

401
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,171
when they are making love?

402
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:40,471
yes

403
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,042
they should have...

404
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:44,513
Nine limbs?

405
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:46,348
Not exactly

406
00:27:46,988 --> 00:27:47,920
Eight?

407
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,159
No, not eight
Nine is not correct either

408
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:52,419
the correct answer is...

409
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:57,362
...eight and then nine,
eight and nine...

410
00:27:57,499 --> 00:27:58,989
Eight limbs and nine limbs?

411
00:27:59,234 --> 00:28:00,223
Eight limbs and nine limbs...

412
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:03,201
but the one l have been used to is...

413
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:09,607
...eight-and-a-half and eight,
eight-and-a-half...

414
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:11,972
what's the matter?

415
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:14,111
there are a lot of people outside
looking for Master dragon

416
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:15,848
doesn't seem to have come
with good intentions!

417
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:16,712
okay!

418
00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:19,711
l have to go out

419
00:28:20,956 --> 00:28:23,857
Hey! you will expose your spots

420
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:25,515
what's wrong with exposing myself,

421
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,820
it's only if you expose that
we have to charge extra

422
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:29,055
l'm not going out!

423
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:30,164
Let's study this...

424
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:36,862
...seven limbs is good,
so is eight limbs, nine limbs...

425
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:40,740
Come out! Come out...

426
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:50,183
don't be so nervous. Relax...

427
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:53,817
l'm not here to check your license
or to close your business

428
00:28:54,923 --> 00:28:58,859
l come here as a hooker,
just like all of you

429
00:28:58,994 --> 00:29:00,427
l'm a consumer

430
00:29:02,063 --> 00:29:03,928
l'm here to take a bath with her

431
00:29:04,332 --> 00:29:06,562
l pay full price

432
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,532
Moustache gold, you bastard!
you expose my status?

433
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:20,945
Right! l am an lmperial Agent

434
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:24,347
And Moustache gold,
he is a triad leader of the capital

435
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:29,085
we used to mind our own business, but...

436
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,657
we are good adopted brothers!

437
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:39,293
He's also my adulterous brother

438
00:29:39,534 --> 00:29:40,193
good brother!

439
00:29:40,635 --> 00:29:41,829
good adulterer!

440
00:29:44,706 --> 00:29:47,539
lt's only because you court her that
l have not protested!

441
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:49,109
Master gold!

442
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:57,879
Hey, it's just a brothel,
do you need to be so heavily armed?

443
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:01,750
Right, l've come here for you

444
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:03,988
who are you? you look a stranger

445
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:06,625
l am the one who is good at drinking,
gambling, and whoring...

446
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:07,693
Cut it off!

447
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:10,964
you are lmmoral wu,
the one with everything

448
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:13,124
but a moral character

449
00:30:16,438 --> 00:30:17,063
Coming!

450
00:30:17,205 --> 00:30:18,001
you placing a bet with him?

451
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,968
yes, we are betting on all we have

452
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:24,044
l buy that our good friend
simon the snow blower will win

453
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:25,510
and he is buying for Cool-son yeh

454
00:30:27,382 --> 00:30:29,907
this time l can't help you

455
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:38,519
simon the snow blower is invincible
How can he lose?

456
00:30:38,793 --> 00:30:40,693
He may be before l met Cool-son yeh

457
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,197
when I saw his
"Hovering Heavenly Fairy" stance...

458
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:47,058
was it powerful?

459
00:30:47,502 --> 00:30:48,400
Very powerful

460
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:50,531
Really very powerful?

461
00:30:50,872 --> 00:30:52,430
Very powerful indeed!

462
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:55,809
then, l must...

463
00:30:56,745 --> 00:30:59,646
you are a gentleman,
you said it before so many witnesses

464
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:00,679
you can't go back on your words now

465
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,009
you won't know before the duel!

466
00:31:03,518 --> 00:31:04,883
we are good friends
of simon the snow blower

467
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,850
No matter what the chances are,
we still support him!

468
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:12,815
simon work hard! simon work hard!...

469
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:16,328
simon Qing work hard!
simon Qing work hard!...

470
00:31:16,564 --> 00:31:17,929
where do you find a simon Qing?
lt's simon!

471
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:19,766
simon work hard!

472
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:23,701
simon work hard,
simon work hard, simon...

473
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:26,406
dragon 9, l haven't finished

474
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:27,906
Actually, l've come to look for you...

475
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:29,237
damn you!

476
00:31:29,444 --> 00:31:32,106
you go to a brothel for prostitutes,
why do you look for me?

477
00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:34,914
l want to buy a medal from you!

478
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:36,447
you know about it?

479
00:31:36,718 --> 00:31:40,620
the lmperial guards asked you
to issue the eight gold medals

480
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:43,915
so they can enter the palace
to watch the duel

481
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:45,617
the whole kung-fu world knows about it

482
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:47,885
Everyone knows?

483
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:52,631
these are matters of the rivers and
lakes and the paparazzi are interested?

484
00:31:53,735 --> 00:31:55,794
there'll be no secrets
in the kung-fu world from now on

485
00:31:56,571 --> 00:31:58,198
l am placing such a large bet
with Moustache gold

486
00:31:58,339 --> 00:31:59,670
of course l am qualified to watch...

487
00:31:59,908 --> 00:32:00,567
who said you are qualified?

488
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,437
lt's not up to you. lt's my decision!

489
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,602
so are you selling?

490
00:32:04,946 --> 00:32:05,469
How much?

491
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:06,875
ten thousand taels

492
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:08,041
ten thousand taels

493
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:12,517
you go around the corner and say it
499 times more! ten thousand taels...

494
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:17,419
Listen everyone, pay attention

495
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:21,928
Cool-son yeh is meeting
the three tang brothers to negotiate

496
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:23,394
at Chun Hua House

497
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:24,759
Let's go and watch, shall we?

498
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:25,797
great!

499
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:27,265
Let's go!

500
00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:12,207
Have they started fighting?

501
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:18,314
Little master, tell me

502
00:33:18,453 --> 00:33:19,715
why are you all so cool?

503
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:23,550
don't you see?
one main character is still missing

504
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:26,518
Haven't seen

505
00:33:28,229 --> 00:33:29,321
what a coincidence!

506
00:33:29,564 --> 00:33:31,156
you are so late,
l thought you wouldn't come

507
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:31,958
why?

508
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:35,129
give way!

509
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,262
In a while Uncle Pingnan will use
the stance "Hovering Heavenly Fairy"

510
00:33:38,406 --> 00:33:42,308
And stab tang Fei and tang Ao
in one blow. How impressive

511
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,544
No wonder, no one sits on the seats
around tang Fei and tang Ao

512
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:48,849
l was surprised. Let's go over

513
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,951
sit down, drink some tea and
wait for Cool-son yeh

514
00:33:51,386 --> 00:33:54,048
the tangs in sichuan are famous
for their poison

515
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:56,919
that's why no one dares go near

516
00:33:58,459 --> 00:34:03,089
those two guys are sweating
on such a cool day

517
00:34:04,365 --> 00:34:06,526
dragon 9, don't you sell me the medal?

518
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:07,859
get off!

519
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:16,169
this lady must have something

520
00:34:16,411 --> 00:34:19,073
l wish we can find simon the snow blower
as soon as possible

521
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:22,113
we must take revenge ourselves

522
00:34:22,383 --> 00:34:25,011
and not let him die
in Cool-son yeh's hands

523
00:34:25,954 --> 00:34:27,114
Cool-son yeh!

524
00:34:50,812 --> 00:34:53,940
Every time Cool-son yeh appears
he has to make a fuss

525
00:34:54,082 --> 00:34:57,711
He must spend a lot of money
on the girls

526
00:34:58,486 --> 00:34:59,680
so you are tang Fei

527
00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:03,847
Cool-son yeh, l will take revenge
for my big brother tang Ling today

528
00:35:04,692 --> 00:35:06,990
the sichuan tangs have
four famous brothers

529
00:35:07,128 --> 00:35:09,028
l killed tang Ling

530
00:35:09,264 --> 00:35:11,789
there's you two, where's tang yong?

531
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:14,558
you let him look for you everywhere!

532
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:16,597
Cool-son yeh, either you die...

533
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:18,865
...or l die today!

534
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:21,670
you deserve?

535
00:35:22,277 --> 00:35:24,177
l have brought the greatest
Hidden weapon of the tangs,

536
00:35:24,312 --> 00:35:26,075
the "Net above snares below" Pin

537
00:35:28,316 --> 00:35:29,340
what's that?

538
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:31,618
there are altogether 199 pins

539
00:35:31,753 --> 00:35:35,553
when we throw them out, not even
a mosquito can escape within 30 feet

540
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:40,918
Friends, this matter only concerns me
and Cool-son yeh

541
00:35:41,362 --> 00:35:42,852
others please give way

542
00:35:43,398 --> 00:35:44,660
None of my business

543
00:35:49,404 --> 00:35:50,928
l'd advise you not to fight

544
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:55,642
we sichuan tangs' poisoned
hidden weapons are scared

545
00:35:55,777 --> 00:35:58,974
by everyone in the kung-fu world

546
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:08,651
l'm not scared, l just want to tell you

547
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,619
once l pull out my sword,
it will shed blood

548
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,220
don't regret it

549
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,193
you're really not scared?

550
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,063
How can a bit of dust be poison?

551
00:37:11,953 --> 00:37:16,014
oh, Cool-son yeh, you are god,
god of sword

552
00:37:16,257 --> 00:37:17,724
oh my god!

553
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:19,918
How can he finish off
Chun Hua House with one blow?

554
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,858
our bet has been concluded

555
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:26,896
you can't back off!

556
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:31,537
brother!

557
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:35,808
l said it, don't force me to fight

558
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:48,253
wait for me!

559
00:37:49,524 --> 00:37:50,889
there's something wrong?

560
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:53,221
what is it? the problem is...

561
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:54,851
...l don't know what's wrong

562
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:44,443
Come out!

563
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:29,621
Come out

564
00:39:43,638 --> 00:39:46,766
Hi, you were great!

565
00:39:49,143 --> 00:39:52,306
you're hurt? Are you okay?

566
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:55,277
lf you can keep the secret

567
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:57,780
l won't kill you

568
00:39:58,986 --> 00:40:01,113
lf you ask me not to tell
of course l won't

569
00:40:01,255 --> 00:40:02,779
l don't know anything

570
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,222
Are you alright?

571
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:08,654
Hey, come over here

572
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:13,061
Are you okay?

573
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:16,962
you better leave,
this place is too dangerous

574
00:40:17,705 --> 00:40:20,765
Remember, you promised
you would not tell others

575
00:40:20,908 --> 00:40:22,273
that l am hurt

576
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:26,713
otherwise, l will be chased...

577
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:31,381
l can find the tianshan snow Lotus

578
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,215
it can cure all kinds of poison,
how about l bring some back to you?

579
00:40:36,023 --> 00:40:37,285
you must keep it well

580
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,751
sorry, but...

581
00:40:40,328 --> 00:40:42,523
you are in hiding, how can l find you?

582
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:47,830
Leaf?

583
00:40:48,235 --> 00:40:50,863
l'll come see you when l hear this sound

584
00:40:52,373 --> 00:40:54,238
this can make sound?
A leaf can make a sound?

585
00:41:00,448 --> 00:41:01,676
Let me try it

586
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:22,230
try again

587
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:27,632
you have to be gentle

588
00:41:29,944 --> 00:41:31,104
Let me!

589
00:41:32,813 --> 00:41:33,837
l know!

590
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:39,550
ls that right? Right!

591
00:41:41,822 --> 00:41:45,155
Cool-son yeh, l will find
the tianshan snow Lotus to cure you

592
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,055
so you can fight simon the snow blower
in good condition

593
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:48,589
wait for me!

594
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:38,712
did you awaken?

595
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:41,641
you have lost your consaiousness
for ten days

596
00:42:44,652 --> 00:42:47,382
you want to kill me, no need to hurry

597
00:42:47,521 --> 00:42:48,613
why did you save me?

598
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:49,617
duty

599
00:42:50,157 --> 00:42:52,125
do you know
this is worse than death for me?

600
00:42:53,894 --> 00:42:56,362
though my master killed my three sisters

601
00:42:56,964 --> 00:42:59,023
still he has brought me up

602
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:01,132
what has that got to do with me?

603
00:43:01,268 --> 00:43:03,031
why am l the only one left alive?

604
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:06,796
And l am at the house of my enemy,
what would people say?

605
00:43:07,475 --> 00:43:08,373
Naive

606
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:11,778
to prove my innocence...

607
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:45,206
today is New year's day

608
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:51,344
this cake is famous in our simon House

609
00:43:54,922 --> 00:43:56,253
lt's called the wife Cake

610
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:23,880
Come to buy fish, it will make a fortune

611
00:44:28,222 --> 00:44:30,452
you give red packets to everyone?

612
00:44:31,225 --> 00:44:34,456
lt's the new year,
they only have to say Happy New year

613
00:44:34,595 --> 00:44:36,392
l give them red packets...

614
00:44:36,897 --> 00:44:38,091
How much is in each packet?

615
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:43,501
lt's 100 taels in each packet

616
00:44:43,938 --> 00:44:45,872
100 taels! you don't even know them?

617
00:44:46,473 --> 00:44:49,601
l will lose all my fortune to
that bastard anyway...

618
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:50,706
lt's the New year

619
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:53,410
lt's lmmoral wu

620
00:44:54,148 --> 00:44:56,844
l'll spend whatever l can

621
00:44:57,284 --> 00:45:01,220
so you are saying that our
simon the snow blower is bound to lose?

622
00:45:01,522 --> 00:45:05,253
Haven't you seen Cool-son yeh
at Chun Hua House?

623
00:45:05,759 --> 00:45:08,489
you really believe
someone can be quicker than him?

624
00:45:08,762 --> 00:45:11,060
think about it! l really regret it

625
00:45:11,198 --> 00:45:12,165
what's wrong?

626
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:15,593
Right, Cool-son yeh's
"Hovering Heavenly Fairy" is powerful

627
00:45:16,003 --> 00:45:19,336
but... I really think
there is something wrong

628
00:45:19,473 --> 00:45:21,270
what's wrong?
l don't know, we'll find out in the end

629
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:26,507
but your friend simon the snow blower,
you think he would come?

630
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:30,278
lf he doesn't show up,
then the duel can't continue

631
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:32,647
then l don't have to lose my fortune,
that's good!

632
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:37,448
Have you been listening?

633
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:41,287
two bastards are on my way!

634
00:45:42,296 --> 00:45:43,957
Hey! so it's you!

635
00:45:44,098 --> 00:45:47,499
Come, Happy New year!
Here's a red packet...

636
00:45:47,668 --> 00:45:50,466
dragon 9,
your good friend simon the snow blower

637
00:45:50,738 --> 00:45:51,762
He's going to show up today?

638
00:45:52,006 --> 00:45:54,133
why do you ask the same question?

639
00:45:54,408 --> 00:45:55,705
you conspired with him?

640
00:45:56,744 --> 00:45:58,974
you don't belong to our group,
who are you?

641
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,608
they are two of the sons
of the "seven tianshan sons"

642
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,750
the one who keeps talking is yen Zizhun

643
00:46:04,885 --> 00:46:07,911
and the dumb one is Xiao Zichong

644
00:46:08,188 --> 00:46:09,780
you and simon the snow blower
killed my master

645
00:46:09,924 --> 00:46:12,518
we brothers are going
to get even with you today

646
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,627
you can't say that
one has to bear his own consequences

647
00:46:15,763 --> 00:46:18,493
your master is a serious criminal
and l am an lmperial Agent

648
00:46:18,632 --> 00:46:19,758
of course l have to arrest him

649
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,368
what's wrong
if l hit him when he resists?

650
00:46:23,137 --> 00:46:25,799
My master is definitely
not the thief ghost, he was wronged

651
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,103
Hey, your sister ye Ziqing
is still alive, go ask her

652
00:46:29,243 --> 00:46:31,643
About how he killed her three sisters

653
00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:32,871
bullshit!

654
00:46:33,414 --> 00:46:35,405
simon the snow blower killed
our three sisters

655
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:36,743
ye Ziqing is licentious,

656
00:46:36,884 --> 00:46:38,977
she survived and has an affair
with simon the snow blower

657
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,679
lf l see them, l'll kill them too!

658
00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:45,422
keep your words here, if he hears you

659
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:46,591
then...

660
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,427
then what?

661
00:46:51,665 --> 00:46:53,724
then, he only needs to touch
their heads gently

662
00:46:53,867 --> 00:46:55,164
and they will explode

663
00:46:56,003 --> 00:46:56,799
bullshit!

664
00:46:57,805 --> 00:47:00,035
simon the snow blower is not here today

665
00:47:00,174 --> 00:47:02,540
dragon 9, you die first!

666
00:47:02,876 --> 00:47:03,706
Come!

667
00:47:22,663 --> 00:47:24,096
Come!

668
00:47:24,231 --> 00:47:27,064
that's the "telepathic Microsteps"
and "buddha's Pointer". Powerful!

669
00:47:28,235 --> 00:47:29,896
l'm really worried about my fingers

670
00:47:30,037 --> 00:47:32,130
l deal with a lot of novices like you

671
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:36,139
lf l am not careful and break
one of my fingers, that's real trouble!

672
00:47:44,952 --> 00:47:49,252
you two are creating trouble,
inviting death!

673
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,587
How do you want to deal with them?

674
00:47:52,926 --> 00:47:55,292
they are just acting on impulse
Forget it
