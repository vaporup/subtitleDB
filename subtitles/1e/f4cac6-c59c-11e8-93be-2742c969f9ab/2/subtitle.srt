1
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:07,459
brother!

2
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:09,662
brother!...

3
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:15,841
killing and spilling no drop of blood,
that's marvelous!

4
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:17,511
simon the snow blower!

5
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:20,348
you have evidence? don't rattle on!

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,719
brother, look!

7
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:28,251
what's up?

8
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:29,380
don't move!

9
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:33,259
Look behind you! My brothers!

10
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:38,793
l know, this is the lmperial Manager,
Eunuch Liu

11
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:41,563
And he is Hawk brother six

12
00:00:41,704 --> 00:00:44,036
My younger brother is
the best apprentice of Mr. skilful

13
00:00:44,173 --> 00:00:46,403
He can make clay dolls of anyone
he has seen

14
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:50,444
that means, it is these three clay dolls
that killed him

15
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:53,415
but Manager Liu is not that powerful

16
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,251
who is it?

17
00:00:56,385 --> 00:00:59,513
Hawk brother six is worse,
he only knows how to gamble

18
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:04,554
so the real murderer is this one

19
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:07,325
but his face is blurred and
can't be recognized

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,864
there's no way to guess

21
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:11,657
what's the matter?

22
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:16,572
killing and spilling no drop of blood,
is he really simon?

23
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,675
Must be him

24
00:01:29,418 --> 00:01:32,182
Manager Liu, l asked you to fetch the
tianshan snow Lotus, have you got it?

25
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:33,185
then get it now

26
00:01:34,023 --> 00:01:35,012
yes

27
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:38,085
sister, who are you giving
this tianshan snow Lotus to?

28
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:42,591
this tianshan snow Lotus is
very precious, l want it for myself

29
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:45,166
l heard it is good for the eyes

30
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:48,464
the skin, and for general health...

31
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:50,731
lt's death penalty for cheating the king

32
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:53,064
Phoenix knows

33
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:56,303
tianshan snow Lotus' main function
is to cure poison

34
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:57,974
l don't care whom you give it to

35
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:02,141
Anyway, it's good that use it
to save and not to injure

36
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:07,888
thank you, brother

37
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:11,417
l knew you are an understanding
and good emperor

38
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:14,161
you are eccentric, full of tricks

39
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:17,424
tell me, have you found your lover?

40
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,491
of course not!

41
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:20,631
Really no?

42
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:21,733
No

43
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:23,327
you know

44
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:27,101
you are of royal blood like me

45
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,010
you don't have the right
to choose the one you love

46
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:34,811
ln the eyes of the common people,
they envy us

47
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:38,650
but then l envy them more
because they have the freedom to love

48
00:02:40,456 --> 00:02:43,550
you speak my mind

49
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:47,692
you must have found a lover

50
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,424
who is he? tell me!

51
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:51,759
l said no

52
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,596
No? Are you telling me or not?

53
00:02:53,736 --> 00:02:55,226
No... tell me, yes or no?

54
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:56,963
No! l'll mar your face!

55
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:06,881
this is Master ball

56
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,351
He will take us to Hawk brother six

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,112
so you are the famous
lmperial Agent dragon 9

58
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:17,525
you are so handsome! l like you!

59
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,354
brother 9.9.

60
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:19,961
why are all eunuchs like this?

61
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:22,995
bear with him, treat him
as your girlfriend

62
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:26,266
you are so handsome,
you are bound to be courted

63
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,630
the palace is like a maze

64
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:35,608
why don't you get lost and go to my room

65
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:37,076
wouldn't that be nice?

66
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:39,076
lf l am so unlucky to go to your room

67
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:40,546
l'll hit your head in one blow

68
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,583
you are bad

69
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:47,215
Normally, the eunuchs in the palace
and the guards can't go around

70
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:50,587
so Hawk brother six has found a place
where no one know

71
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:53,957
And set up a gambling house there

72
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:57,429
the eunuchs and guards

73
00:03:57,566 --> 00:04:01,400
treat it as a club

74
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:03,967
He is so popular, does he know
how to serve the eunuchs' asses?

75
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,577
Place your bet!

76
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,884
Hold it...

77
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:25,390
three sixes. l get all!

78
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:26,885
l am glad l was late

79
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:27,996
you are dragon 9, right?

80
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,892
what's the matter?

81
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:32,829
well, l know you are a practical person

82
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:35,664
lf l want a deal,
l have to gamble with you, right?

83
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:37,031
How do you want to gamble?

84
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:39,600
Up to you, if you win

85
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:43,038
these 5,000 taels are yours

86
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:44,271
what if l lose?

87
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,343
lf you lose, l don't want money

88
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,540
l just want to know...

89
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:52,586
...who this clay doll really is?

90
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:54,350
How come you have this clay doll?

91
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:59,823
lt's with you...

92
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:06,891
these three clay dolls are found
on the body of shi Zilun

93
00:05:07,403 --> 00:05:10,201
He must have found out something
he should not know

94
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:11,863
and had himself killed

95
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:14,504
okay, l take your bet

96
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:17,841
we'll play dice,
whoever gets the greater number wins

97
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,742
okay

98
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:21,683
Have you thought carefully

99
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:23,182
do you know his other name?

100
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,718
l know what?

101
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:25,786
He is the "dice devil"

102
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:28,954
that's right,
everyone calls me the dice devil

103
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,616
l have never lost

104
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:36,530
Come on

105
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:57,174
All 18 dice are "6", that makes 108

106
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:00,917
l'm finished. your turn

107
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:01,988
okay

108
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:15,428
so you take that as shaken?

109
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,671
yes, and l have won too

110
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:23,103
that's one point greater

111
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:23,902
one point greater!

112
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:25,274
that's not shaking the dice!

113
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:27,080
you haven't said
l can't shake it that way!

114
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:28,240
you...

115
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:29,347
what about me?

116
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:33,148
you have so many "fans" here
supporting you, be a gentleman

117
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:38,822
okay, dragon 9, you are smart!

118
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,686
Everyone knows that

119
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:46,200
so can you tell me
who this clay doll is now?

120
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:52,239
l never thought
our meeting would be overheard

121
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:53,503
He is...

122
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:54,404
be careful!

123
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:10,389
He's dead! stop fooling around!

124
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:12,924
He's killed to keep his mouth shut

125
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:15,362
He must be a great kung-fu master
and very wicked too

126
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:20,562
of the three dolls, one is dead,
one is unknown

127
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,130
the only one left is Manager Liu

128
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:16,153
wait...

129
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,758
where are you going in such a hurry?

130
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,329
Manager Liu is dead!
we are going to his funeral

131
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:44,546
Cool-son yeh, where are you?

132
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:48,881
you must take care yourself,
don't be killed

133
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:13,144
why are you sighing?

134
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:20,785
why are you here?

135
00:09:22,124 --> 00:09:23,921
there are two persons dead in the palace

136
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,555
Everything is a mess, so l am here

137
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:28,394
How's your injury?

138
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:33,232
this is the tianshan snow Lotus, eat it

139
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,705
l'll recover as soon as possible for you

140
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,501
then, l can get ready soon and win!

141
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:43,076
l know you will win

142
00:09:44,113 --> 00:09:45,205
thank you

143
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:49,346
does the emperor know about the duel?

144
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:52,520
He knows, and he knows you will win too

145
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:58,415
one of us would lose

146
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:01,423
lt's not who wins that is important

147
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:04,896
this duel has become too important

148
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:11,336
lf we don't finish it,
l'm afraid it won't happen again

149
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:17,578
l'm sure you'll win!

150
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:31,249
what's the matter with you?

151
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:36,962
Nothing

152
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,691
Cool-son yeh, whether you live or die

153
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:11,593
win or lose

154
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:14,227
l'll be by your side

155
00:11:56,578 --> 00:11:58,136
why do you treat me like this?

156
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,304
when l am blocking the sun for you?

157
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,478
where's Cool-son yeh?

158
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:03,448
Cool-son yeh?

159
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:05,685
was he around?

160
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:11,925
you weren't having a "wild game"
with him here last night?

161
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:15,053
stop blabbing here!

162
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:18,559
ls Cool-son yeh really injured?

163
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:20,594
top secret!

164
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,238
lf you don't want to tell,
l dare not ask

165
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:27,100
l just want to remind you

166
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:29,902
Remind me of what?

167
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:36,179
Mastering the sword
is a very lonely business

168
00:12:36,718 --> 00:12:38,345
to be an invincible swordsmen

169
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:41,820
you have bear loneliness
which no normal person can bear

170
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:46,894
As his woman, it is more difficult to
describe the pressure she has to suffer

171
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,333
this is all so hard to understand

172
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:56,164
lf you fall in love
with an invincible swordsman,

173
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,170
you've to share his loneliness

174
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:01,575
and also suffer the torment
of losing him at any time

175
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:05,712
lt's not easy

176
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:12,679
lt's funny to see you talking
to me so seriously

177
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:18,683
okay, l am going to investigate now,
interested?

178
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:21,362
lnvestigate what?

179
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:26,860
shi Zilun truly is my closest disciple

180
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:30,930
He has learned 70% of my skills

181
00:13:32,374 --> 00:13:35,434
Mr. skilful,
can you return this clay doll?

182
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:37,878
l am his master, what do you think?

183
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:41,871
No one has ever been
so rude to Mr. skilful

184
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,409
give me an hour

185
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:48,250
l guarantee l can return this clay doll

186
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:51,492
soon we will find out
who killed shi Zilun

187
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:55,761
the murderer is so eager
to shut his mouth

188
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:59,264
there must be a great plot behind this

189
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:00,968
you call this logic?

190
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:07,842
why are you still here?

191
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:09,207
waiting for you

192
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:12,006
How can l work with you watching?

193
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:14,446
go out for a walk

194
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:16,082
and come back in an hour!

195
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:17,850
Let's go

196
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,156
we have a whole hour

197
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:30,024
what shall we do?
Anything you want to do?

198
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:31,689
who has anything to do with you?

199
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:36,062
lt's so romantic to walk with you
in the sunset

200
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:37,771
l really will excrete and throw up

201
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:41,470
l walk with you because l think
highly of you, don't think you are

202
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:45,643
lf only you were Jade

203
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:48,248
she is so understanding, really

204
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:53,245
l know, no matter what l do,
you won't treat me as a girl

205
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:55,381
you are a girl

206
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,022
you are the sister of the emperor,
Princess Phoenix

207
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:00,761
who dares make friends with you?

208
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:03,028
what difference does a princess make?

209
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:05,065
A princess can also fall in love!

210
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:09,403
A princess can also love and be loved

211
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:13,469
so you have fallen in love with that...

212
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:17,839
lf you keep rattling on, l'll kill you!

213
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,539
white Cloud City Master
is so prestigious

214
00:15:20,682 --> 00:15:23,150
and is a relative of the Royal Family

215
00:15:23,952 --> 00:15:25,783
l am only concerned about him

216
00:15:25,921 --> 00:15:29,857
Have you ever thought the murderer might
be the white Cloud City Master himself?

217
00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:32,660
that's impossible

218
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:37,122
l think the third clay doll
may be simon the snow blower

219
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,262
How come?

220
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:44,328
because be seems so uncertain

221
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:47,800
may be it's true?

222
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,309
simon the snow blower
being the bad guy...

223
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:55,875
How funny!

224
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:08,920
see! l said simon the snow blower is bad

225
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:11,624
where's Mr. skilful?

226
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:15,530
Right here!

227
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:19,106
killing and spilling no drop of blood...

228
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,571
who else can it be
but simon the snow blower?

229
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:24,336
lt's impossible!

230
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:27,738
Nothing is impossible!

231
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,044
simon the snow blower must
still be around

232
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:33,518
lf he fights with you

233
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:35,551
you think you can win him?

234
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:37,681
He won't fight with me

235
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:42,088
that's right, he will use worse methods
to deal with you

236
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:54,370
l had a little donkey, l never rode it

237
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:55,271
does this bring your...

238
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,605
...childhood memories back?

239
00:17:02,017 --> 00:17:04,247
yes! l am searching
for the feeling of childhood

240
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:05,375
but...

241
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,250
from my chest to my pelvis,
it's all broken

242
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,115
give me a break, please

243
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:13,116
okay, l spare you

244
00:17:14,496 --> 00:17:15,929
what bloody place is here?

245
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:21,130
you cowards!

246
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:23,533
you use dirty tricks to hide us here

247
00:17:23,672 --> 00:17:26,300
lf you have the guts you come down

248
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:27,738
and fight with dragon 9 alone!

249
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:29,909
sure! Have the guts to come down!

250
00:17:30,045 --> 00:17:32,479
Noble persons don't do sneaky things,
l dare you to come down to fight me!

251
00:17:32,614 --> 00:17:33,410
Come down!

252
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,349
didn't you say that your "telepathic
Microsteps" is the best on the earth?

253
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:39,817
go! go ahead!

254
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:42,353
okay, come on, one, two...

255
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:46,858
why didn't it work?

256
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,597
Let's try again. one, two...

257
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:52,728
why can't we fly up?

258
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:55,969
l forgot to tell you, the "telepathic
Microsteps" is not for facile leaping

259
00:17:56,104 --> 00:17:58,504
lt's just used to avoid weapons
to run away

260
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:00,033
you are always bluffing!

261
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:02,375
but there is a method which works

262
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:04,841
then use it! Quick!

263
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:12,783
Help! Help...

264
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:14,513
that's your solution?

265
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,019
that's not bad. you don't have
to practise and it costs nothing

266
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:22,152
Help! Help! Help...

267
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:24,798
don't play with my things!

268
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:39,679
wow, this is a great umbrella!

269
00:18:39,981 --> 00:18:43,644
when l go back,
l will ask dragon 7 to make me one

270
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:55,896
give me!

271
00:18:56,665 --> 00:19:01,568
kill you...

272
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:10,777
don't cry, that's okay

273
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:12,345
don't cry, it's only a small scorpion

274
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,414
see, l am not afraid, why should you be?

275
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:16,073
be good, stop crying

276
00:19:16,217 --> 00:19:18,845
l hate little animals, they make me sick

277
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:22,951
this scorpion is very good for health

278
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:25,385
lt smells so good, want to taste it?

279
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:26,892
don't do it, l'll beat you!

280
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:28,859
okay...

281
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:30,430
be a good boy

282
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:37,460
lt's bad!

283
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:40,371
Push hard!

284
00:19:42,343 --> 00:19:43,173
trading places!

285
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:51,314
Help! Help...

286
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:54,980
l never imagined that l,
dragon 9 the hero

287
00:19:55,123 --> 00:19:57,353
would be beaten by these traps!

288
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,387
what?

289
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,462
you're useless!

290
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:05,696
lt's all your fault!

291
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:08,860
lf you're not careless,
we would not trap here

292
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:11,266
dragon 9

293
00:20:11,406 --> 00:20:12,930
simon, is that you?

294
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:14,733
simon? who is it?

295
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:25,077
lf you are my friend, just go

296
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,481
No, l have lots of questions for you

297
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:28,919
why don't you answer me?

298
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:30,624
you shouldn't stay here for long

299
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:01,913
why don't you help him?

300
00:21:02,257 --> 00:21:04,452
He doesn't need help
on these trivial matters

301
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:06,887
you don't think he only knows
how to "blow snow" do you?

302
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:56,307
lt's delicious, good taste... thank you

303
00:21:57,946 --> 00:22:00,278
No wonder no one knows
you are in the capital

304
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:02,773
the city is the best place to hide

305
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:05,750
our cake shop has a hundred years
history in this capital

306
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,453
one hundred years!

307
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:09,485
No wonder it's so delicious,
what's it called?

308
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:11,649
this is the wife Cake
l like it very much too

309
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:19,466
Let's order more take away,
l want more cakes!

310
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:20,465
lt's really delicious!

311
00:22:21,536 --> 00:22:22,901
Come eat quickly!

312
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:26,969
Mind your manners when you eat

313
00:22:27,242 --> 00:22:28,641
you are a princess!

314
00:22:28,943 --> 00:22:30,137
l am hungry!

315
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:33,076
l follow you in your investigations
and almost got myself killed

316
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:35,546
And now you start lecturing me
when l eat, what's wrong?

317
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,242
go eat then

318
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:40,218
you're suspicious about me?

319
00:22:57,405 --> 00:22:58,599
Are you full?

320
00:23:00,141 --> 00:23:03,838
so you have decided to go
for the duel with Cool-son yeh...

321
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:05,411
at the summit of the Forbidden City?

322
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:06,909
yes

323
00:23:07,115 --> 00:23:08,844
do you know that
big outside bets have been placed?

324
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:10,883
May be that's...

325
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:14,046
the reason why someone wants
to cast the blame on you

326
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:20,560
He must be a great master

327
00:23:21,262 --> 00:23:24,527
He has killed Hawk brother six,
Manager Liu...

328
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,600
and Mr. skilful in my presence
to shut their mouths

329
00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:29,964
there must be a big plot behind all this

330
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:33,067
but what are they doing?
l really don't know

331
00:23:33,908 --> 00:23:35,876
Are the people placing
their bets on me...

332
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,205
or Cool-son yeh?

333
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:40,606
you

334
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:42,741
Moustache gold has regretted
placing his bet on me?

335
00:23:42,884 --> 00:23:44,010
you can think l am lying!

336
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:47,815
l would bet on you even if l have
to pledge my underwear, you better win

337
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:56,126
the cake...

338
00:23:58,566 --> 00:23:59,692
...tastes good!

339
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:06,102
what're you doing?

340
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:07,371
Russain soup

341
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:09,669
try some!
yes!

342
00:24:14,048 --> 00:24:17,108
l heard he is very cool
and very cold-blooded

343
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:17,876
you believe that?

344
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:22,018
Not really, l think
he can is very gentle and considerate

345
00:24:23,024 --> 00:24:25,458
l heard he only has feelings
for his sword

346
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:27,584
and nothing else

347
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:31,229
Not really,
l think he is very passionate

348
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:35,198
but l heard he killed your master!

349
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:38,635
l heard that
Princess Phoenix is a nosy body

350
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:41,569
l didn't believe it then,
but now l tend to agree

351
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:46,008
okay, l was just over curious that's all

352
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,840
we are both girls, l just want to know

353
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:53,113
How you can make a cool man
become gentle

354
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:56,121
you are a princess,
don't you have a lot of love...

355
00:24:56,257 --> 00:24:57,724
and care from others?

356
00:24:58,393 --> 00:25:00,953
Everyone envies me for being born
in the royal family

357
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:04,653
but in fact, l feel lonely and pathetic

358
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,360
you have not been loved before?

359
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:10,531
l don't know

360
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:15,701
then have you ever truly loved a person?

361
00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:20,643
l don't know if that is love

362
00:25:24,052 --> 00:25:27,351
because it is great happiness
to love someone

363
00:25:27,488 --> 00:25:29,353
and to be loved by someone

364
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,588
Eat your wife Cake

365
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:33,924
l think you want to marry too much
you are getting crazy!

366
00:25:34,062 --> 00:25:34,926
you are jealous

367
00:25:35,063 --> 00:25:36,496
who cares

368
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:50,574
what's that?

369
00:25:50,812 --> 00:25:52,279
Flying dove mail of our tianshan Clan

370
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,644
what's up?

371
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:56,110
lt's my two brothers yen Zizhun
and Xiao zichong

372
00:26:13,668 --> 00:26:17,126
Here's the foe that killed your master,
why don't you take revenge?

373
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:24,839
l have found out that
my master is truly the thief ghost

374
00:26:25,513 --> 00:26:28,038
but then, he is still our master

375
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:29,839
and he raised us up for good sake

376
00:26:30,852 --> 00:26:33,343
we disciples should take responsibility

377
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:35,451
l told you earlier

378
00:26:35,723 --> 00:26:38,419
brother shi's death can't have anything
to do with blow snow

379
00:26:39,527 --> 00:26:40,858
you call him by his first name

380
00:26:40,995 --> 00:26:44,897
so your relationship must have surpassed
pure friendship, right?

381
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,460
l think the one who put poison on us
and who killed Zilun are a team

382
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:51,728
they want to shut our mouths

383
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:54,473
but simon the snow blower can still cast
blame on someone else

384
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:57,608
that's impossible

385
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:01,478
such a highly skilled swordsmen
would not need to use poison

386
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:02,679
thank you

387
00:27:03,885 --> 00:27:07,446
so you've kept your image even though
you spend your time courting women

388
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:10,687
you ask him to come and
you don't take revenge

389
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:12,190
what do you want?

390
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:14,718
we have a favour to ask from you two

391
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:17,694
tell me, l'll see what l can do

392
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:21,094
Please take good care of my sister

393
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:28,065
one more thing, Master dragon 9

394
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:30,273
l want two gold medals from you

395
00:27:30,411 --> 00:27:32,072
wow, you say you want it

396
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:33,475
do you know how much it costs?

397
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:35,145
How much?

398
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:36,848
5 million taels for one!

399
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,086
but, if you really want it,
just give me a small red packet

400
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:45,358
thanks

401
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,158
Unconcerned persons prohibited
from entering palace

402
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:56,563
Am l unconcerned? l am Princess Phoenix!

403
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:57,528
l am sorry

404
00:27:57,672 --> 00:28:01,073
l can't let anyone in
without instructions from above

405
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:01,971
How dare you?

406
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:05,635
l tell you l am not in a good mood,
l give you one more chance

407
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,810
Are you giving way or not?

408
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:07,739
but...

409
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:10,579
Princess, they are only following orders

410
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:12,345
Please don't make it difficult for them

411
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:15,446
l only want to find someone in there

412
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,818
what's wrong with that?

413
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:18,685
who do you want to find?

414
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,392
that's none of your business

415
00:28:20,728 --> 00:28:21,922
of course

416
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:25,323
but if you want to find Cool-son yeh

417
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:27,434
then may be l can help

418
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:30,501
you know where's him?

419
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:33,396
l have secretly placed a bet

420
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:36,510
so l have a duty to protect them
till the duel tonight

421
00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:39,078
take me there yes

422
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:42,713
Cool-son yeh

423
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:45,248
lt's you?

424
00:28:47,054 --> 00:28:49,420
you don't look too well,
have you recovered?

425
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:51,516
l'm fine

426
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:54,892
l have seen
simon the snow blower's skills

427
00:28:55,196 --> 00:28:58,825
Although it is not as powerful as
your "Hovering Heavenly Fairy"

428
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,569
but his stances are very quick

429
00:29:02,837 --> 00:29:04,737
and very forceful too

430
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:06,306
that's good

431
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:07,906
why?

432
00:29:08,242 --> 00:29:09,834
lf he is not a good master

433
00:29:10,544 --> 00:29:12,603
then it's meaningless for me
to have the duel with him tonight

434
00:29:12,747 --> 00:29:15,045
but you have not recovered yet

435
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:17,582
l'm okay, it's going to be fine

436
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:19,609
but... can't you refit a date?

437
00:29:19,854 --> 00:29:22,448
No. No one...

438
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,616
...can back out from the fight today

439
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:29,852
Neither of us can change it

440
00:29:30,698 --> 00:29:32,222
we must fight

441
00:29:37,238 --> 00:29:38,830
Men are that strange

442
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:41,675
Honour is more important than life

443
00:29:41,942 --> 00:29:46,675
so tonight we can die,
but we cannot back out

444
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:54,280
why can't l know you before the duel?

445
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,050
whatever happens tonight,
it does not matter

446
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:01,258
lf you are by my side

447
00:30:01,395 --> 00:30:04,455
l have no regrets

448
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,361
Really?

449
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:08,960
No

450
00:30:10,404 --> 00:30:13,703
No one has thought highly of me
in my whole life

451
00:30:14,842 --> 00:30:18,369
you know that l am
the illegitimate child of Pingnan king

452
00:30:18,813 --> 00:30:20,280
l have royal blood

453
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:23,581
but l can never be emperor

454
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:27,816
that's why l spend my whole life
practicing my sword

455
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:32,289
so that l can be king
in the art of sword

456
00:30:33,928 --> 00:30:37,455
Either l become king
or l become a bandit

457
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:39,325
you will win

458
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:43,429
thank you

459
00:31:09,063 --> 00:31:10,553
Are you ready?

460
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,234
do you love me?

461
00:31:28,315 --> 00:31:29,213
do you know that...

462
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:33,411
every girl wishes
to hear her lover say it

463
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:36,348
you understand

464
00:31:56,577 --> 00:31:59,375
you must come back, l will wait for you

465
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:03,276
No need to wait! lf you wish,
you can come along. sister-in-law

466
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,645
who is your sister-in-law?

467
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:10,013
Just now you forgot your manners
and embraced him

468
00:32:10,257 --> 00:32:11,246
you must be my sister-in-law already

469
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:14,557
How about it?

470
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:16,763
tonight's going to be
a grand event of the capital,

471
00:32:16,897 --> 00:32:18,330
everyone's attention is drawn to it

472
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:21,560
the Powerful Four in the Palace
only issued eight gold medals

473
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:24,268
l have given five
to unimportant people...

474
00:32:24,405 --> 00:32:27,033
...of the remaining three

475
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:29,799
lf you really want to go,
l can give one to you

476
00:32:30,578 --> 00:32:31,442
l'm not going

477
00:32:31,712 --> 00:32:32,872
you don't want to go
or you dare not watch?

478
00:32:35,316 --> 00:32:36,783
l want to wait for him here

479
00:32:37,117 --> 00:32:40,382
that's good,
no one knows what will happen tonight

480
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:43,388
And there's another master in the palace
who has not appeared

481
00:32:44,158 --> 00:32:45,648
don't worry, l'll be back

482
00:32:47,194 --> 00:32:47,990
Let's go

483
00:32:48,295 --> 00:32:49,694
Hey, don't be so selfish

484
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,855
you've got one, l've got one too!

485
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:54,391
give me some time, l'll be back soon

486
00:32:58,772 --> 00:32:59,670
Jade

487
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:02,971
All these years,
l have not given you anything good

488
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:06,379
Each time when l am tired

489
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:08,343
you always know how to make me happy

490
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:11,910
tonight is an important occasion

491
00:33:12,386 --> 00:33:16,379
Not just for simon the snow blower,
even l am not sure if l can come back

492
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,417
so l want you to stay by my side

493
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:21,324
and take you to watch the duel

494
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:26,160
you are really willing
to take a prostitute with you

495
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,165
and acknowledge me as your woman?

496
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:31,900
what about being a prostitute!
l am not much better?

497
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:35,666
l used to be only an usher
at the theatre

498
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:37,606
and learned some special martial arts

499
00:33:39,046 --> 00:33:40,570
Come here, put this on

500
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:44,450
do l need to wear this?

501
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:47,078
lt's so ugly, l don't want it

502
00:33:47,488 --> 00:33:49,513
you don't want it,
or you don't want to wear it?

503
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:50,624
l'm not going

504
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:51,986
why?

505
00:33:53,127 --> 00:33:55,186
because l want you to know...

506
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:58,992
there is a woman here waiting for you

507
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,293
you must come back!

508
00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:06,335
okay, l promise, l'll be back!

509
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:18,312
this umbrella can do anything,
but not stop the water!

510
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,648
what's wrong! this is murder!

511
00:34:30,698 --> 00:34:34,532
you know, l hate women who pretend to...

512
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:35,792
...have manners!

513
00:34:36,403 --> 00:34:38,667
l like you that way!

514
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:41,299
l love you!

515
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:47,206
gold medals on sale... 100 tael for one

516
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:50,309
gold medals on sale...

517
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:52,951
terrific! l got the gold medal now!

518
00:34:59,393 --> 00:35:01,486
How many medals did
the Powerful Four give to you?

519
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:03,554
Eight, l give it to you...

520
00:35:03,697 --> 00:35:07,030
and lmmoral wu, two sons of the
tianshan Clan, Honest monk, Priest wood

521
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:09,325
the remaining two were left for Jade

522
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,335
and simon the snow blower's girl

523
00:35:11,572 --> 00:35:13,301
but she didn't want it

524
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:16,869
do you know, everyone is saying

525
00:35:17,011 --> 00:35:18,410
they have a gold medal and that...

526
00:35:18,545 --> 00:35:20,012
...they can use it as a pass...

527
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:22,707
...to enter the palace
to watch the duel of the century

528
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,014
lt's as exciting as going to a concert

529
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:30,280
don't worry, the eight gold medals
were issued by Nie kung and the others

530
00:35:30,424 --> 00:35:31,948
He can tell which ones are genuine

531
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:44,598
don't shout!...

532
00:35:49,943 --> 00:35:51,501
you suspect my medal is faked?

533
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:55,741
do you know that l lmmoral wu,
spent 5 million taels to buy it?

534
00:35:55,883 --> 00:35:57,441
stay calm!

535
00:35:58,252 --> 00:36:00,379
okay, here comes dragon 9

536
00:36:00,521 --> 00:36:01,818
lf you don't believe me you ask him

537
00:36:01,955 --> 00:36:04,185
whether my medal is real or faked

538
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:08,258
that's true, l have given
out gold medals, but only six

539
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:11,127
l don't understand
why so many people have a medal

540
00:36:11,632 --> 00:36:13,827
dragon 9, my medal is real, right?

541
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:15,693
More real than your mom!

542
00:36:19,773 --> 00:36:21,900
Look, what shall we do?

543
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:24,634
l don't know myself

544
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:27,505
don't push! Let me go in!

545
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:57,775
simon the snow blower...

546
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,977
this sword of mine is named "the giant"

547
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:06,217
3 feet 8 inches long

548
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,054
Made with ice under the sea
lt can cut the thinnest of hair

549
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:13,989
And has been fed with the blood
of 178 famous swordsmen

550
00:37:15,362 --> 00:37:18,263
Mine is 3 feet 9 inches,
Made from iron of the western district

551
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:20,126
lt is not worse than yours

552
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:23,897
so is your heart at peace?

553
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:33,407
we'll fight next year!

554
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,384
tang Ao, give me the cure!

555
00:37:46,627 --> 00:37:48,424
the poison in me
has been passed on to you

556
00:37:48,662 --> 00:37:49,560
you're dead!

557
00:37:50,564 --> 00:37:52,327
l am not Cool-son yeh!

558
00:38:01,742 --> 00:38:03,141
tang Fei...

559
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:06,773
No, you can't die! tang Fei!

560
00:38:06,914 --> 00:38:08,347
then where is Cool-son yeh?

561
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:18,555
who are you?

562
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:27,125
who are you?

563
00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:29,266
How dare you! l am the emperor

564
00:38:29,403 --> 00:38:33,169
you dare to sneak into the palace
and put on the king's robe

565
00:38:33,307 --> 00:38:35,104
do you know
your whole clan would be executed?

566
00:38:35,242 --> 00:38:36,106
How dare you!

567
00:38:36,643 --> 00:38:39,942
l am the real emperor

568
00:38:41,114 --> 00:38:43,947
you have stolen my throne for years

569
00:38:45,085 --> 00:38:48,782
lf you kneel down and beg me,
l can spare you the death penalty

570
00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:50,020
you...

571
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:53,189
you are too much!

572
00:38:57,598 --> 00:39:00,999
your two majesties,
please allow me to say something

573
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:01,929
Liu?

574
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:03,962
shouldn't you be dead?

575
00:39:04,404 --> 00:39:06,599
there's a vampire grass out there

576
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,232
within 24 hours after a person is "dead"

577
00:39:10,377 --> 00:39:12,038
the body is stiff with no breath

578
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:14,409
lt's no different from being dead

579
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:15,578
guard!

580
00:39:16,016 --> 00:39:17,278
your majesty

581
00:39:17,517 --> 00:39:20,918
the guards are at taihe Palace
watching the duel

582
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:24,147
Cool-son yeh?

583
00:39:24,424 --> 00:39:25,413
that's right

584
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:31,588
but the real Cool-son yeh
is here waiting to be emperor

585
00:39:34,468 --> 00:39:37,301
so you two have conspired to rebel

586
00:39:37,905 --> 00:39:39,429
we were linked by royal blood

587
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,634
l am much smarter than you

588
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:46,534
and my kung-fu is invincible

589
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:52,009
why did my father had to be sent to
Pingnan for being an illegitimate child

590
00:39:52,152 --> 00:39:54,677
and l even lost my title
because l am an illegitimate child?

591
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:56,686
and have to my mother's last name

592
00:39:58,058 --> 00:39:59,320
brother...

593
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,828
...you call that justice?

594
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:06,359
these rules have been set by
the royal family, we just have to obey

595
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,792
lf l become emperor

596
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:12,095
l will improve the livelihood
of the people and expand our boundary

597
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,073
our prosperity will surpass
the tang and Han dynasty

598
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,836
And we will even be stronger
than the times of genghis khan

599
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:22,778
think about that

600
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:28,751
And your death would be worthwhile

601
00:40:29,456 --> 00:40:32,914
you think that if you kill me and take
my throne, the people would obey you?

602
00:40:36,229 --> 00:40:38,561
your majesty do not have
to worry about this

603
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:40,926
l have been your servant
since you were a child

604
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:44,834
l am familiar with every inch
of your face

605
00:40:45,038 --> 00:40:50,806
so l have made a mask bearing your face

606
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:55,309
when you die and the new emperor
takes your throne

607
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:57,314
l am sure no one will recognize

608
00:40:57,751 --> 00:41:03,087
one year later, l will meet
with my brother Cool-son yeh in the west

609
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,686
l suddenly feel a calling from heaven

610
00:41:08,695 --> 00:41:13,257
and become a monk,
passing on my throne to Cool-son yeh

611
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:19,728
then the country will prosper and
the civilians will adore me

612
00:41:21,475 --> 00:41:25,241
great! so you have it well planned

613
00:41:28,315 --> 00:41:29,247
Pull out your sword

614
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:30,415
why?

615
00:41:31,084 --> 00:41:33,052
l don't kill anyone without a weapon

616
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:37,014
l have been appointed by heaven

617
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,316
lf you wish to act against the wishes
of heaven, then just come along

618
00:41:42,062 --> 00:41:43,757
l am willing to do it for you

619
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:47,458
you dare!

620
00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:51,129
the lnvincible Umbrella!

621
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:52,465
lt can attract all hidden weapons
on earth

622
00:41:52,606 --> 00:41:53,436
weapon!

623
00:41:54,908 --> 00:41:56,398
Just the two of you?

624
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:09,045
your majesty

625
00:42:13,527 --> 00:42:16,587
do you know
why l knew of your plan a long time ago?

626
00:42:17,097 --> 00:42:19,622
because the jade imperial seal
you returned

627
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:22,234
last time was too perfect

628
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:25,437
the real one has
one of its corners broken

629
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:29,631
shi Zilun knew your conspiracy
with Hawk brother six and Manager Liu

630
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:31,209
so you killed him

631
00:42:31,778 --> 00:42:34,576
the third clay doll was actually you

632
00:42:35,949 --> 00:42:38,816
Hawk brother six is really dead
and his death is faked

633
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,680
you switched all attention to the duel
at the summit of the Forbidden City

634
00:42:44,191 --> 00:42:47,058
so the Powerful Four guards could not
protect the emperor

635
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:50,125
then you sneak in to try and
take over the throne

636
00:42:55,202 --> 00:43:00,435
Cool-son yeh, you were acting
with tang Fei at Chun Hua House

637
00:43:00,574 --> 00:43:04,806
so you cheated me to believe

638
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,041
you are injured so l pity you, right?

639
00:43:13,753 --> 00:43:15,914
too bad,
heavens vengeance is slow but sure

640
00:43:16,056 --> 00:43:18,388
tang yong did not know the truth

641
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:20,625
And killed his own brother

642
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:23,519
And the truth spilled out

643
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:25,932
Cool-son yeh...

644
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:33,599
you have cheated me and used me

645
00:43:41,515 --> 00:43:42,004
guard!

646
00:43:42,149 --> 00:43:42,638
yes!

647
00:43:42,782 --> 00:43:44,249
Arrest Cool-son yeh and Liu tong!

648
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:45,009
yes!

649
00:43:45,152 --> 00:43:47,120
Hold it! you think you can arrest me?

650
00:43:47,888 --> 00:43:50,618
of course l can't do it alone,
but there are 50,000 soldiers out there

651
00:43:50,757 --> 00:43:51,746
and 800 lmperial guards...

652
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:54,122
you fight till tomorrow till
you are totally exhausted,

653
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:56,092
and you die all the same

654
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:59,656
you were a nobleman,
why choose to be a bandit?

655
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,196
the victor becomes a king and
the loser a bandit

656
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:10,701
Now...

657
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,444
l have only one request

658
00:44:16,316 --> 00:44:17,214
what is it?

659
00:44:17,717 --> 00:44:21,153
Please let me have the duel
with simon the snow blower

660
00:44:21,288 --> 00:44:23,347
on the summit of the Forbidden City

661
00:44:24,691 --> 00:44:28,354
lf l can't fight with him,
l will regret it for the rest of my life

662
00:44:28,495 --> 00:44:30,395
How dare you negotiate?

663
00:44:30,664 --> 00:44:31,756
why not?

664
00:44:34,401 --> 00:44:37,268
Uncle Pingnan, you are a nobleman

665
00:44:37,504 --> 00:44:42,100
Although illegitimate,
l always considered you a hero

666
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:45,975
l now allow you to have the duel
with simon the snow blower

667
00:44:46,346 --> 00:44:50,510
And whatever the result,
you can commit suicide

668
00:44:52,118 --> 00:44:53,608
what do you think?

669
00:45:00,927 --> 00:45:02,622
thank you. your Majesty

670
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:05,964
Night of the full moon,
summit of the Forbidden City

671
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:07,862
l hope you have a fair duel

672
00:45:35,061 --> 00:45:37,359
l don't mind you

673
00:45:37,497 --> 00:45:41,729
Cheating me or using me

674
00:45:43,103 --> 00:45:44,968
l just want to know one thing

675
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:51,567
Have you ever really loved me?

676
00:45:54,814 --> 00:45:55,974
yes

677
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:59,275
No lying?

678
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,644
No

679
00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:10,389
Everything, has been as planned

680
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:16,361
but there was a little mistake

681
00:46:18,038 --> 00:46:19,972
l fell in love with you

682
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:28,980
then do you wish me to be your wife?

683
00:46:33,486 --> 00:46:35,010
l have said that...

684
00:46:36,122 --> 00:46:41,321
...no matter you win or lose,
live or die

685
00:46:42,295 --> 00:46:44,388
l will be by your side

686
00:51:10,563 --> 00:51:11,996
Leave me alone

687
00:51:54,574 --> 00:51:55,836
Are you alright?

688
00:52:09,255 --> 00:52:11,883
Cool-son yeh, how dare you!

689
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:15,621
whoever gets into the way?

690
00:52:15,895 --> 00:52:16,793
go!

691
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,224
go away

692
00:52:59,238 --> 00:53:00,899
l am in pain...

693
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:08,742
do you wish to be my wife?

694
00:53:11,784 --> 00:53:13,581
of course, l do!

695
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:21,189
l love you

696
00:53:39,011 --> 00:53:40,501
Cool-son yeh...

697
00:53:42,248 --> 00:53:46,548
don't leave me alone, bring me along

698
00:54:19,752 --> 00:54:23,051
don't worry, he'll be fine

699
00:54:38,638 --> 00:54:39,764
give me a hug!

700
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:42,508
Are you alright?

701
00:54:42,642 --> 00:54:46,100
Hey... don't say such things in public,
it's nauseating

702
00:54:46,345 --> 00:54:48,745
what does it matter?
Can't l care for you?

703
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:51,779
Look at them,
they are saying love words too!

704
00:54:52,718 --> 00:54:56,154
l don't care...

705
00:54:56,289 --> 00:54:58,723
l have waited so long my legs are weak

706
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:01,449
okay... we will go back and take a bath

707
00:55:01,594 --> 00:55:03,186

l will rub your back, how's that?

708
00:55:03,329 --> 00:55:04,227

709
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:06,860
l love you

710
00:55:17,743 --> 00:55:18,732
Let's forget them

711
00:55:19,178 --> 00:55:21,578
Let's go back and
play eight-and-a-half limbs nine limbs

712
00:55:22,481 --> 00:55:23,778
disgusting!

713
00:55:24,684 --> 00:55:26,117
simon, come on!

714
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,186
Hey, jump up!

715
00:55:34,961 --> 00:55:37,259
How can we don't have
a New year sex in Lunar New year?
