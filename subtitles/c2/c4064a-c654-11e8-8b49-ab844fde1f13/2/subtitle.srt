1
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,631
You lent me an umbrella.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,838
Not this one.

3
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,403
- It's a present.
- Don't want it.

4
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:15,740
Why not?

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,380
I don't want it.

6
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,249
At the time, we were both
only nineteen.

7
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:53,847
We were so young and immature.

8
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,893
But I wonder
why we had to be so nervous.

9
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,858
The first phone call from you.

10
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,795
Our first date.

11
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,002
The coffee shop where we met.

12
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,978
The first film we saw.

13
00:01:56,082 --> 00:02:01,179
If I found music or a book I liked,
I told you before anyone else.

14
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,414
We talked about so many things.

15
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,085
You told me about your childhood.

16
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,822
Your father was Japanese.

17
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:15,893
That's why you have a
Japanese name, Aoi.

18
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,395
But he died when you were young.

19
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,640
After your mother remarried,
you found it hard

20
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,170
adjusting to a new family.

21
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,510
You'd been alone for a long time.

22
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,617
And then
you came to Japan to study.

23
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:47,128
Looking for a place to belong to,
you said.

24
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,743
Please.

25
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,255
Come in.
You need slippers.

26
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:20,122
Will you have something?
How about coffee?

27
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,335
Or perhaps a cold drink?

28
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,142
Grandpa used this place
as his studio.

29
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,255
That's mine.

30
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,898
This one, too?

31
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,263
I stopped halfway through
that one, too.

32
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,999
Ice.
Where's the ice?

33
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,743
Here it is.

34
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,515
It's still hot.
Just wait.

35
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,783
Those ones, too?

36
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,394
They are Grandpa's.

37
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,292
I'm going home.

38
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,925
I'm leaving.

39
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:48,107
That first time you came
to my place,

40
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,214
I couldn't sleep all night
thinking about you.

41
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,826
All that we shared back then
remains unchanged.

42
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,698
That's what I believed.

43
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,797
But the coffee shop
we used to meet at

44
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:20,137
was torn down and replaced
by a new building.

45
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,078
The secondhand record shop

46
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,289
is no longer there, either.

47
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,619
They moved to another town.

48
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,029
Do you still remember?

49
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,468
The courtyard at the university

50
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,146
where we used to hang around?

51
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,976
The cello player who
practiced there?

52
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,907
Always playing the same piece.

53
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,445
Always getting stuck at
the same point.

54
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:40,021
We used to giggle at
his squeaky efforts.

55
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,326
We really did.

56
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:35,163
He was playing when
we kissed for the first time.

57
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,535
Darling Aoi...

58
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,844
Now I've forgotten how the tune goes.

59
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,911
Incoherent bits of old episodes.

60
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:53,720
Yes, it's just some
old story from the past.

61
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,656
Thank you for reading this.

62
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,191
I'm embarrassed at
how childish I was

63
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,761
when I saw you in Milan.

64
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,832
Now I'm ashamed of it.

65
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,971
Forgive me.

66
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,343
Please give my best regards to Marve.

67
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,313
Please take care of yourself.

68
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,646
Hello, Agata speaking.

69
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:29,785
Hello?

70
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,285
Hello?

71
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:48,766
Aoi?

72
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,037
At last...

73
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,946
...I'm glad you're happy now.

74
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,757
To Aoi, far away in Milan.

75
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:44,625
Now I'm living a completely
separate life.

76
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,028
From Junsei.

77
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,075
Yes.
Hello?

78
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,149
Junsei.

79
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:16,652
Angelo?

80
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,280
Listen.

81
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,423
Last night, Giovanna...

82
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,712
...no one knows why she killed herself.

83
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,441
We'll hold a service at the studio.

84
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,379
Junsei?

85
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,098
I can cancel the wedding now.

86
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,649
Ciao.
See you.

87
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,078
Junsei.

88
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,780
So you came?

89
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,386
I'm at another studio.

90
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:47,691
Takanashi teaches restoration,
he's an impossibly strict teacher.

91
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,836
Giovanna would be pleased.

92
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,136
She felt you had talent.

93
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,662
I should tell you.

94
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,936
The painting was damaged...

95
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,034
...by Giovanna.

96
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,043
She did it soon after you left.

97
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,542
What are you doing?

98
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,752
Stop it!

99
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,549
Stop!

100
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:18,515
Stop that!

101
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,056
Let me go!

102
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,284
Let me go!

103
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,994
Others saw her, too.

104
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,861
But everyone kept quiet.

105
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:35,633
We wanted to protect the studio
by protecting Giovanna.

106
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,507
But in the end,
it was shut down, anyway.

107
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,353
The reason I never told you...

108
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,526
...was because I was jealous of you.

109
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,362
Just like Giovanna.

110
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,492
Jealous of your talent.

111
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,301
No, not just your talent.

112
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,677
It's that straightforward
earnestness about you.

113
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,882
I hate dealing with that.

114
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,685
I'm awkward, that's all.

115
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,394
I wish life was easier for me.

116
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,893
You're doing it again.
It upsets me.

117
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:51,449
Maybe Giovanna was in love with you.

118
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:05,088
I hear the studio's going to reopen.

119
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,595
Next spring.

120
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:27,450
Spring 2000

121
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:34,382
Junsei, open up.
You're there, aren't you?

122
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,327
Open the door.

123
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,396
Sorry, I was in the
middle of breaking up.

124
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,002
With Aihara?

125
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,161
No, Eriko from sales.

126
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,870
Junsei said he has
something to tell me.

127
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:56,809
What's going on?

128
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,713
I only found out yesterday.

129
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,153
What does it mean?

130
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,218
You're going back to restoration?

131
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,256
Restoration is...

132
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,397
...giving life to something that's dying.

133
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,971
It's the only profession that lets
you bring back the past.

134
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,749
That's what convinced me.

135
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,080
So you won't be a painter?

136
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:43,661
You're too wrapped up in restoration.

137
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,712
You suck.

138
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,420
Wait.

139
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,400
Just wait.

140
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,641
Let me go!
You don't even care about me.

141
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:31,935
Calm down.

142
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:36,741
I'll go back to Italy
to start over again in restoration.

143
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,746
You're a liar!
All lies!

144
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,179
On my own, this time.

145
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,286
I've long waited

146
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:46,982
for the day when you would see only me.

147
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,795
What the hell was I to you?

148
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,556
- I thank you.
- Stop it!

149
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,601
Don't pity me or apologize.

150
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,438
That's not what I want to hear.

151
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,573
What I really want to hear is...

152
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,708
...what am I to you?

153
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,345
What am I to you, Junsei?

154
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,849
All I want to know is...

155
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,662
Why not?

156
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,068
Why can't I be the one?

157
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,573
Tell me why!

158
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,910
Because I love only Aoi.

159
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,109
I tried to forget her.

160
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,515
I tried to take you in.

161
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,819
But I...

162
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,064
...I still love Aoi.

163
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:08,103
Even if I never see her again.

164
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:11,798
I will...

165
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,878
...I will always love her.

166
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,844
She was a good girl.

167
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,548
She said
now she could finally let go,

168
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,017
because you told her the truth.

169
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:05,320
Goodbye, you fool, she said.

170
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,738
You poor soul.

171
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,568
No luck with your first or second love.

172
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:20,676
And you?
Still chasing that girl at work?

173
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,707
She's here now.

174
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,651
Kana, from the secretariat.

175
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,256
I was about to chase another.

176
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,962
Do your best.

177
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,541
See you.

178
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,130
It's that string quartet again...

179
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,909
A man stopped by to see you just now.

180
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,768
- Thank you.
- See you.

181
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,544
Goodbye.

182
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:56,723
A long time ago a boyfriend
asked me to go with him.

183
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:02,796
But I'd just started this shop and
I thought I belonged here.

184
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,737
I don't want you to end up
regretting like I did.

185
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:14,350
The place where you belong
can only be found in your heart.

186
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,462
Spring 2001

187
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:40,764
This studio was closed down
because of that matter we call

188
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,735
"The Tragedy of Cigoli."

189
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,807
But in the short space of one year

190
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:51,443
it has been successfully reborn,
as you can see.

191
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:56,644
It's all due to the skills of
our talented restoration experts.

192
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,314
This was found in an old church.

193
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:34,553
The condition was poor
and the damage was extensive.

194
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,557
Did you work on it?

195
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,926
They said I couldn't do it,
but I begged them.

196
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,433
Excuse me.

197
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,399
Excuse me.

198
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:12,796
It was the Cigoli's masterpiece.

199
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:36,050
This past year, coming face to
face with the work again,

200
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,719
I attempted my own rebirth.

201
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,224
I...

202
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:49,098
...so many times I had to
rescue myself from my feelings.

203
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,209
Aoi.

204
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:13,145
I wonder if you've
already forgotten...

205
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,427
...the promise we made.

206
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:29,034
Junsei, do you know...

207
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,504
...this old saying?

208
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,293
Will you go there with me someday?

209
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,267
The Duomo in Florence?

210
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,668
Yes.

211
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:01,768
When?

212
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,032
Far in the future.

213
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,022
When will that be?

214
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:29,491
Maybe, ten years from now.

215
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,795
In ten years,

216
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,378
we'll both be in our thirties.

217
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,817
The twenty first century.

218
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:11,803
Are you serious?

219
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,809
We'll be unchanged,
we'll still be together.

220
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:56,252
Then Junsei,
will you promise me?

221
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:04,518
Let's make it on my 30th birthday,

222
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,292
at the Duomo in Florence.

223
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,295
Alright.
I promise.

224
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:56,263
How is he?

225
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,469
Marve, I mean.

226
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,466
He's back in Los Angeles.

227
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:10,971
With you?

228
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,214
Since when?

229
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:22,783
Two years ago.

230
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,428
You came all this way?

231
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,006
I don't know what to say.

232
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,111
I didn't make plans for after this.

233
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,383
I doubted it would happen.

234
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,060
I thought I'd wait all day in vain.

235
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,520
That was okay.

236
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,398
So I'm at a loss.

237
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,470
I never expected you'd come.

238
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,778
You're in a bind.

239
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,020
I'm just confused.

240
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,714
Do you understand what I mean?

241
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,395
But I remembered.

242
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,929
I never forgot.

243
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,870
When do you leave?

244
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,646
Tomorrow morning.

245
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,730
Then let's go and eat.

246
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,334
Maybe a drink.

247
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,109
I have something to show you.

248
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:55,576
Come with me.

249
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,869
Surprised?

250
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,767
I'm...

251
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,606
...I thought to myself...

252
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,312
...it was a miracle.

253
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,179
A message from God.

254
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,780
Like an illusion.

255
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,049
A glitch in time.

256
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,348
Caught up in the illusion,

257
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,144
we loved each other passionately.

258
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,980
Trying to reassure ourselves.

259
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,728
Trying to make up for
all the missing time.

260
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:13,924
It's alright.
You can take the day off.

261
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,198
Enjoy yourself.

262
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,261
No, I'm coming.

263
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,437
Sorry for not calling sooner.

264
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,034
See you later.

265
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,812
Here's your coffee.

266
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:11,515
Look, I have to go now.

267
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:17,321
I'm leaving.

268
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,626
I'll see you off.

269
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:29,366
I want to.

270
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,039
Goodbye.

271
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,688
Now I wish we hadn't.

272
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,894
That stupid promise.

273
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:02,766
Be happy.

274
00:49:09,213 --> 00:49:10,475
Thank you.

275
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:15,912
Take care.

276
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,091
I'm glad we did.

277
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,122
I wanted to, Junsei.

278
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,967
I'm so glad we met.

279
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,972
Farewell.

280
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:27,781
Hey.

281
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,053
Did you enjoy it?

282
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,065
You were asked to play it?

283
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,429
Your girl asked me to.

284
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:44,068
Last year she asked me to
come and play it.

285
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,869
"Next time, play it in Florence,"
she said.

286
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:49,704
Last year?

287
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,537
In Milan,

288
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,614
at the square.

289
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,384
She's in Milan?

290
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,327
Thank you!

291
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,333
Sorry.

292
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,007
The Milan train?

293
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:36,770
It just left.

294
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:47,579
If you take the next Eurostar,

295
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:52,387
you'll be there 15 minutes
before the one that just left.

296
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:09,043
Miracles don't usually
happen so easily.

297
00:54:10,514 --> 00:54:15,417
The only miracle for me was

298
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,882
that you were waiting for me.

299
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,388
You stayed so calm.

300
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,064
What can I say to you?

301
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,415
How can we mend

302
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,044
the blank between us?

303
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,165
Should we even try?

304
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:10,062
Not by reliving the past.

305
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,099
Not just hoping for the future.

306
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,614
The present is all we have.

307
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:21,315
My dear Aoi,

308
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:25,786
those sad, lonely eyes...

309
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:29,586
...if I find myself in there...

310
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,727
...then...

311
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,427
...you and I...

312
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,461
...we'll be...

313
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:30,236
