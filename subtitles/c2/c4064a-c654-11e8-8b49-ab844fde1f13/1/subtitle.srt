Original Story by
Kaori Ekuni & Hitonari Tsuji

4
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,502
Will you go there with me someday?

5
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:50,977
When?

6
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,685
Let's say...

7
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,155
...ten years from now.

8
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,690
Will you promise to do that, Junsei?

9
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:11,425
I will.
I promise.

10
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:43,665
Twixt Calm & Passion

11
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:59,475
Spring 1994

12
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,681
The record rainfalls in 1966
quickly flooded the Arno River

13
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,152
and all the historic areas of Florence.

14
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:13,832
Damaging numerous,
irreplaceable works of art.

15
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:19,035
Paintings, sculpture, furniture,
textiles, books,

16
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:26,402
and precious art stored
in galleries and storerooms.

17
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,283
To save them,

18
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:35,552
we developed and mastered

19
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,085
new restoration techniques.

20
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:45,892
The entire city turned into a
restoration studio.

21
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,292
It was a revolution in the craft
of fine art restoration.

22
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:57,910
That pride and spirit have been
passed on down to us.

23
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,478
Florence remains the most
important center of

24
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,777
fine art restoration in the
entire world.

25
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,414
Our mission,
to resurrect historical pieces.

26
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,918
Our experts devote themselves
to their work.

27
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:22,032
Often spending an incredible
amount of time on one piece.

28
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,631
Let's take a look at it.

29
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,306
It's been a while.

30
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,304
Completed.

31
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,375
Wonderful.

32
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,069
Let me introduce my disciple Massimo.

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,145
You did a good job.

34
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,280
This one was greatly damaged.

35
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,454
He is an expert in water painting.

36
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,953
He colored it with complete skill.

37
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:49,151
It was damaged by dampness.

38
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,664
It took five years to finish it up.

39
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,303
I went to Italy to study art restoration.

40
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,430
I went to Italy to study art restoration.

41
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,807
I was twenty-three years old.

42
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,121
I'll use this gesso.

43
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,422
Okay.

44
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,933
I went to one of the leading
studios in Florence.

45
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,409
For three years
I studied as a trainee.

46
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,075
Some of the world's leading
experts worked there.

47
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,888
Our teacher, Giovanna, was one.

48
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,486
She was an expert on
oil painting restoration.

49
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,491
I managed to pass a few of
the qualification exams.

50
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,467
Mostly due to Giovanna's teaching.

51
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,970
You added gesso?

52
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,234
Yes, I added it all.

53
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,292
Occasionally, Giovanna
used me as a model for her work.

54
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,929
That first time,
I was quite flustered.

55
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,359
All?

56
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,466
Take it all off?

57
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,561
All of it?
Every stitch?

58
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,401
Completely nude?

59
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,132
I asked her three times, to make sure.

60
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,143
Everything... even my underwear.

61
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,282
The fourth time, I acquiesced.

62
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,627
Don't move.

63
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,202
Giovanna seemed to always

64
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,732
work on her drawings in silence.

65
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,412
I kept quiet and soaked up

66
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:25,914
the atmosphere of
serene time and space.

67
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,215
To me,
Giovanna was like a mother.

68
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,119
My mother died when I was young.

69
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,763
Her studio was always warm.

70
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,527
Giovanna's favorite perfume

71
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:50,201
exuded the gentle fragrance
of the iris.

72
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,824
You're in a church.

73
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,574
Aoi.

74
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,319
- Take it away.
- Not yet.

75
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,191
I want veal in tomato
sauce and pasta.

76
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,125
Tell him no beans
in the pasta.

77
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,422
No white beans, please.

78
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,965
Just translate.

79
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,231
Everything's fine, thanks.

80
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,031
You're always angry.

81
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,364
Who's Aoi?

82
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,378
You called her name in bed last night.

83
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,809
I apologized, didn't I?

84
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:26,346
My name is Memi.
Who the hell is she?

85
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,086
Why ask?

86
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,255
It's nothing to do with you.

87
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,093
I'm sorry.
Look, I apologize.

88
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,526
Waiter!

89
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,493
More wine here!

90
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:49,799
Memi is studying at a
language school here.

91
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,248
Her roommate also attends
the same school.

92
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,952
Those two facts
are all I know about her.

93
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,204
In my heart...

94
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,575
...there's a woman...

95
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,913
...one I can never forget.

96
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:38,516
Spring 1997

97
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,567
Aoi.

98
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,306
That's her name.

99
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,245
As for me,

100
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,516
for all these years,

101
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,923
I could never...

102
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,361
...forget her.

103
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:24,435
You majored in Japanese literature
in Japan, didn't you?

104
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,894
Right.

105
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,306
So this is not your field.

106
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,546
Morning.

107
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,950
How did you win Giovanna's favor?

108
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,050
What's that mean?

109
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,618
You should know.

110
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,481
Did you bed her?

111
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,023
Bed? A bed of sushi?
I like it raw.

112
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,755
I heard that she is thinking about

113
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:58,802
getting Junsei to work on
the Cigoli painting.

114
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,429
What?

115
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,004
That's great.
Congratulations.

116
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,301
What's up?

117
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,536
Junsei's in charge of Cigoli.

118
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,010
It was painted in 1610.

119
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,883
The owner is a private collector.

120
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,986
You want me
to work on it by myself?

121
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,363
You don't feel up to it?

122
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,364
It's not that...

123
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,732
I do.
I'd really like to do it.

124
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,191
What do you think?

125
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,026
It's good work.

126
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,560
Want me to get you something?

127
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,999
No, thanks.

128
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,533
I'll be back soon.

129
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,033
Alright.

130
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,306
Thank you.

131
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,141
Do a good job.

132
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,380
First, I worked on the surface.

133
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:32,292
I felt as if my soul,
and the artist's, became as one.

134
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:37,762
Almost a sacred feeling as if
my soul was being cleansed.

135
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,531
You know Lodovico Cigoli, don't you?

136
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,173
Back in Tokyo
I showed you a print of his.

137
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,481
I'll finish it soon.

138
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,189
It's been three years.

139
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,386
How have you been?

140
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,691
Hey, Takashi.

141
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,197
What's wrong with you?

142
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,874
This girl called Kana is exquisite.

143
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,978
I quite fancy her.

144
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:27,083
She told me to "take care"
when I left Japan.

145
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,048
It's just crap talk.

146
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,656
What's with you?

147
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,960
Well, yesterday in Milan...

148
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:50,874
...I met Aoi.

149
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,119
Here.
This is where she works.

150
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,656
It's a jewelry shop.

151
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,519
She's been there three years.

152
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,990
You knew all along?

153
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:15,797
Don't be snotty.

154
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,435
No, give it back.

155
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,298
Forget I said it.

156
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,871
Don't do that.

157
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,101
Leave it there.

158
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:29,511
I should never have even
considered telling you.

159
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,909
She gave it to me
just as I was leaving.

160
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,658
She never said to give it to you.

161
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,252
But after all,

162
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,425
I was there when you split up.

163
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,928
I can't forgive you.

164
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,399
I want you out.

165
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,443
Now, I said!

166
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,199
Looking for a present?

167
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,496
Not really.

168
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:11,140
Actually, yes.
A birthday present.

169
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,344
I see.

170
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,342
When is it?

171
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,974
May 25th.

172
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,915
Too late, that was last week.

173
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,020
Is it a present for your girlfriend?

174
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:27,556
Let me choose something for you.

175
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,620
How about this?

176
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:34,664
The color is very appealing.

177
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,868
I was wondering if she is...

178
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,395
"Marvin Lai
Milan Branch Director"

179
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,257
Please.

180
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,594
It's from the Piedmont region.

181
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,676
It's been a while.

182
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,175
I asked at the jewelers.

183
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,232
He's recent,
she's totally besotted.

184
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,176
I'll take them.

185
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,474
Wait here please.

186
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,464
Sorry, but I'll get going.

187
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,119
Did you invite me
to see the painting

188
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,021
or to show off your new boyfriend?

189
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,489
Anyway, it was a mistake to come.

190
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:45,802
From what Takashi said,
I thought you still felt hurt.

191
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,167
How come?

192
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,172
I'm just fine.

193
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,746
The past is all forgotten.

194
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,591
I'm happy now.

195
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,833
Junsei.
Where have you been?

196
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,272
The police came looking for you.

197
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,904
The police?

198
00:27:58,576 --> 00:27:59,543
You can't enter.

199
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,787
Are you Junsei Agata?

200
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,789
How did this happen?

201
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,371
Are you Junsei Agata?

202
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,306
No...

203
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,140
It wasn't me.

204
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,608
You must make a statement.

205
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,912
But it wasn't me!

206
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,225
No.

207
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,523
I didn't do it.

208
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,529
Let me go.

209
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,532
Who the hell was it?

210
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:54,827
Who the hell was it?

211
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,432
Which one of you did this?

212
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,213
I'll take you back soon.

213
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:33,026
You know my roommate?
She's found a new boyfriend.

214
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,325
An Italian guy,
he works at a gym.

215
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:41,097
They fuck every night,
he has to smother her cries.

216
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,521
You don't need me, do you?

217
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,298
It's obviously someone

218
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:52,363
with a grudge against Junsei.

219
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,728
A grudge?

220
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:54,962
Think about it.

221
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:59,803
It wasn't a robbery, nothing's missing.
Junsei's Cigoli is the only damage.

222
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:04,938
Then someone must really hate you.

223
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,481
Takanashi, you found it.

224
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,058
Using my surname?
Mind your manners.

225
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,458
You framed me up.

226
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,594
Did I now?

227
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:33,100
You were out partying,
you screwed up!

228
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,775
The mass media jumped
all over the story.

229
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:14,574
The studio lost its good reputation.

230
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,053
The police had no suspects.

231
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,386
Since it wouldn't be solved anytime soon,

232
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:28,000
the police closed us down
until further notice.

233
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,915
I don't care if we never find out.

234
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,585
That way there's no one to resent.

235
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,020
Yes, but still...

236
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,092
This city just seems to
get more and more rundown.

237
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:10,240
No matter how hard we work,
we can't keep up.

238
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,241
The people of Florence all
live in the past.

239
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,171
The only work here is

240
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:23,216
in restoration and tourism.

241
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,028
Don't let hate destroy you.

242
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,021
You have a future.

243
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:38,695
Some future.

244
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:49,709
Giovanna decided to take a sabbatical.

245
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:55,715
A rare chance to take a
long holiday, she said.

246
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,886
Then she smiled.

247
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,956
I lost my job.

248
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,686
Unlike my colleagues,

249
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,933
I didn't want to go to another studio.

250
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,272
I couldn't see a future for me
in this town.

251
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,445
Take care!

252
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,780
I gave my bike to Memi's friend.

253
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,923
I moved out of my apartment.

254
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,397
I went back to Japan.

255
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:02,143
Spring 1998

256
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,736
Junsei, I'm coming in.

257
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,671
I took Kana to Hakone.

258
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,806
She's a good girl.

259
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,367
Hi...

260
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,130
Is this that Aoi?

261
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,709
Yes, that's her.

262
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,137
Who are you?

263
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,619
If you're going to be
taking it easy,

264
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,089
why not try a tempera?

265
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,898
I don't have the talent.

266
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,502
Yes, you have.

267
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:31,337
You just want me to do
what my father didn't.

268
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,242
Does he ever visit, grandpa?

269
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,910
Sometimes he does.

270
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:43,886
For more money?

271
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,391
Nothing's changed.

272
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,166
Is the studio closing
the only reason you came back?

273
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:11,572
Is that what made you
run away from Italy?

274
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,522
I'm happy now.

275
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:33,258
The past is all forgotten.

276
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,807
A letter for you, Aoi.

277
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,009
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

278
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:00,786
He's stable.

279
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,528
Do you have Uncle's
number in Kashiwazaki?

280
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:09,367
I called Auntie,
but we'd better let Uncle know.

281
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,836
No, I haven't called Dad yet.

282
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,343
No point calling him.

283
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,421
Too early for the inheritance.

284
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,394
He's out of danger.

285
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,495
That's good news.

286
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:42,266
You, too.
You're looking well.

287
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,267
I'm relieved.

288
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,409
Come on, Asami.

289
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,112
Your son is really cute.

290
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,913
He takes after me.

291
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,796
Why can't I cook for you?

292
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:11,901
Mind your own business.
Stop hanging around.

293
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,194
You should talk!

294
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,374
I quit school and left Italy
just for you.

295
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,474
Who asked you?

296
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,110
Don't blame me for everything.

297
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:34,223
So you don't care what I do?

298
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:42,560
Get pregnant and have an abortion?

299
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,268
I'm not like Aoi.

300
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,310
Who told you?

301
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,643
She aborted your baby.

302
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,182
Who told you?

303
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,732
That friend of yours.
He told me.

304
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,627
She's a good girl.

305
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:00,908
She's trying to understand your past,
that's why I told her.

306
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,304
You shouldn't have blabbed.

307
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:07,010
I didn't tell her everything.

308
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:13,216
I didn't tell her about your dad,
or the details of you and Aoi.

309
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:17,649
Nor how you and Aoi
spoke with your minds.

310
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,351
That's silly.

311
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,022
But you two were so close.

312
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,564
A good lesson for me.

313
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,642
Too much love can
sometimes spoil it.

314
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:38,510
You never end up with
your true love.

315
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,124
So Aoi is...

316
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:56,421
...she's happy in Milan, isn't she?

317
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:06,834
See you.

318
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:08,875
Thanks for the meal.

319
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:14,377
Memi, isn't it?
Say hello for me.

320
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,746
Is Kana your second choice?

321
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,785
No, she's top of my list.

322
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,424
Sorry about that.

323
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:23,652
Goodbye.

324
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,160
Hey, Takashi.

325
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,431
What was that about my dad?

326
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,232
About him offering cash.

327
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,567
What cash?

328
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,271
To Aoi.

329
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,442
Didn't you know?

330
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:24,049
You're a sensible girl.
I'm relieved.

331
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,092
How come?

332
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,520
Why didn't you tell me?

333
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,961
It's my problem, not yours.

334
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,199
I can't forgive you.

335
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:43,770
I can never forgive you.

336
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,046
I want you out.

337
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,378
Now I said!

338
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,955
Get out now!

339
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,079
An induced miscarriage.

340
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:42,589
The baby wouldn't have
survived, anyway.

341
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,259
You?

342
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,196
Hi there.

343
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,640
Hello.

344
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:01,205
We just dropped by.

345
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:04,842
You must be Kana.

346
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:11,179
I'm Aihara, general affairs.

347
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,356
Why don't you go in?

348
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:28,069
I'll have the new will
delivered to you here.

349
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:29,499
Fine.

350
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:35,006
Thank you for coming.

351
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,573
Asami, you too.

352
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:43,852
Thank you.

353
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,911
Are you satisfied now?

354
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:51,291
Remember your friend,
Mr Tazaki?

355
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:56,863
His paintings soared in value
soon after he died.

356
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:02,598
I bet his family is clawing over
the inheritance right now.

357
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:07,770
This way we're spared
any ugly disputes.

358
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,710
As for impregnating young females,

359
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,911
it's all taken care of.

360
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,379
See you later.

361
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:29,729
Hey, Junsei.

362
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,101
What did you say to Aoi?

363
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,238
She's not that kind of girl.

364
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,968
You insulted her!

365
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:41,938
Apologize!

366
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:44,709
Apologize.

367
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:46,806
Say you're sorry.

368
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:52,117
That's enough.

369
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:53,720
You apologize.

370
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,730
Stop that!

371
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:08,393
Apologize.

372
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:41,026
Spring 1999

373
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:04,560
Dear Aoi...

374
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:08,565
Forgive me for writing
out of the blue.

375
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,707
This will probably be the first

376
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:17,212
and the last long letter
I write you.

377
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:22,145
I'm at the apartment in Tokyo.

378
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:28,150
I ran away from Florence.
Yes, I ran away.

379
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:30,892
I came back to Japan.

380
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:36,426
I went to Shimokitazawa today.

381
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:41,792
The place where I first met you.

382
01:00:43,801 --> 01:00:48,704
Spring 1990

383
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,732
Hey chief.

384
01:00:57,014 --> 01:00:58,174
Ten yen?

385
01:01:01,986 --> 01:01:03,419
It's only ten yen?

386
01:01:04,288 --> 01:01:06,222
This would cause a riot in Asia.

387
01:01:10,261 --> 01:01:12,821
Hey.
Is that any good?

388
01:01:13,397 --> 01:01:15,888
That's really great.

389
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,898
- I've never heard it.
- Me, neither.

390
01:01:25,943 --> 01:01:28,776
That's how we met.

391
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,707
In that shop, in that town.

392
01:01:33,984 --> 01:01:36,714
Just a quick passing,
no words exchanged.

393
01:01:37,288 --> 01:01:39,483
Why do I remember it so vividly?

394
01:01:46,363 --> 01:01:47,352
It's yours.

395
01:01:55,472 --> 01:02:00,705
When I saw you the next time,
you looked a little wary.

396
01:02:04,615 --> 01:02:09,018
But I was a regular visitor
to the museum.

397
01:02:10,588 --> 01:02:15,116
I already knew they'd hired
a new receptionist.

398
01:02:15,492 --> 01:02:17,619
She was part-time.

399
01:02:18,395 --> 01:02:22,729
She went to my alma mater,
but a different discipline.

400
01:02:23,934 --> 01:02:24,992
One more thing.

401
01:02:25,936 --> 01:02:29,428
I found out that she was
always alone.

402
01:02:30,774 --> 01:02:32,105
And I knew it.

403
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:57,394
The kind who doesn't mind
being by herself.

404
01:03:03,307 --> 01:03:08,677
I thought you were a very
strong person.

405
01:03:19,657 --> 01:03:23,354
But the reality
was quite different.

406
01:03:25,963 --> 01:03:29,626
You were lonely,
craving for company.

407
01:03:30,534 --> 01:03:34,527
At the same time,
so stubborn and unyielding.

408
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,105
What could I do?
