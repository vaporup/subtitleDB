you struck it rich sometime, pop.

164
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:37,512
How about it?

165
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:40,866
Then what are you doing in here,
a down-and-outer?

166
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,188
That's gold. That's what it makes us.

167
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,746
Never knew a prospector yet
that died rich.

168
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:48,671

trying to find another.

169

I'm no exception to the rule.

170
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:56,077
Sure I'm a gnawed old bone now
but don't you guys think the spirit's gone.

171
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,554
I'm set to shoulder a pickaxe
if anybody's willing to share expenses.

172
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:01,833
I'd rather go by myself.
It's best to go alone.

173
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:05,308
But you got to have a stomach
for loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it.

174
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:08,708
But going with a partner is dangerous.
Murder is always lurking about.

175
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:11,631

of all sorts of crimes.

As long as there's no find,
the noble brotherhood will last.

178
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:20,630
But when the piles of gold begin to grow,
that's when the trouble starts.

179
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:25,435
I wouldn't mind
a little of that kind of trouble.

180
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,829
DOBBS: I think I'll go to sleep...

183

Do you believe what the old man...

184
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:43,313
who was doing all the talking
at the Oso Negro...

185
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:44,990
said the other night...

186
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:48,627
about gold changing a man's soul
so that he ain't the same kind of a guy...

187
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:51,186
that he was before finding it?

188
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:53,030
Guess that all depends on the man.

189
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:54,995
That's exactly what I say.

190
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,349
Gold don't carry any curse with it.

191
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:01,477
It all depends on whether or not
the guy who finds it is the right guy.

192
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,146
The way I see it...

193
00:14:03,238 --> 00:14:05,832
gold can be as much of a blessing
as a curse.

DOBBS: Yeah.

196
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:15,072

or am I seeing things?

197

go and buy me something?

McCORMICK: Rye is good enough for me.

213
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:02,149
I suppose you're wondering
about that money that's coming to you.

214
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:05,196
The fact is I haven't been paid off
on that contract myself.

Why not try gold-digging for a change?

255

It ain't any riskier
than waiting around here for a break...

256

of gold are crying for you...

than it is here in Tampico.

Our money'd last longer.

261

The longer it lasts, the greater our chance
of digging something up would be.

262

DOBBS: Right through their eyes.

838

Excuse me for butting in, but there's
no game here worth going after.

839

for five miles in each direction.

841

Yes, there's no good hunting here.

to leave...

I'd have seen it, believe me.

857

you're not as smart as you appear to be.

can bump me off any minute...

899
00:58:13,742 --> 00:58:16,336
but that's a risk worth running
considering the stakes.

900
00:58:16,422 --> 00:58:18,060
Let's lay all our cards on the table.

901
00:58:18,142 --> 00:58:20,576
As I see it, you guys have to do
one of three things:

902
00:58:20,662 --> 00:58:23,699
kill me, run me off
or take me in with you as a partner.

903
00:58:23,782 --> 00:58:25,659
Let's consider the first.

904
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:28,814
Another guy may come along tomorrow.
Maybe a dozen other guys.

905
00:58:28,902 --> 00:58:29,937
If you start killing them...

906
00:58:30,022 --> 00:58:32,456
how far are you prepared to go?
Ask yourselves that.

907
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:35,739
Also, don't forget,
the one actually to do the bumping off...

908
00:58:35,822 --> 00:58:38,177
would forever be in the power
of the other two.

909
00:58:38,262 --> 00:58:41,334
The only safe way would be
for all of you to drag out your cannons...

910
00:58:41,422 --> 00:58:43,731
and bang away at the same instant
like a firing squad.

911

to protect our interests.

I claim killing me isn't it.

913

But, of course, that's for you to decide.

914
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:53,461
As for choice number two...

915

I might very well inform on you.

916
00:58:55,622 --> 00:58:57,340

of your find is the reward I'd get.

with that. You can only shoot one of us...

1510
