1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,240
When people say we don't believe
in global warming,

2
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:18,233
I say no, I believe in global warming,

3
00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:20,721
I don't believe that human CO2
is causing that warming.

4
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:22,715
A few years ago,
if you would've asked me,

5
00:00:22,716 --> 00:00:24,707
I would tell you it's CO2.
Why?

6
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,698
Because just like everyone
else in the public...

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,190
I listen to what the media have to say.

8
00:00:30,187 --> 00:00:34,669
Each day, the news reports
grow more fantasticly apocalyptic,

9
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:39,648
politicians no longer dare to express
any doubt about climate change.

10
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:42,140
There is such intolerance...

11
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:44,132
of any dissenting voice...

12
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:47,616
...some of the worst climate
criminals on the planet.

13
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:52,099
This is the most pollitically
incorrect thing possible

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,089
is to doubt this climate
change orthodoxy

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,073
Climate change has gone
beyond politics

16
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,064
it is a new kind of morality.

17
00:01:01,263 --> 00:01:03,753
The Prime Minister is back
from his holidays...

18
00:01:03,754 --> 00:01:07,241
unrepentant and unembarrassed
about yet another long haul destination...

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,013
Yes, as the frenzy of a man-made
global warming grows shriller,

20
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:16,999
many senior climate scientists
say the actual scientific

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,490
basis for the theory is crumbling.

22
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:22,477
There were periods for example
in our history

23
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:24,469
when we had three times as
much CO2 as we have today

24
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,458
or periods when we had ten times
as much CO2 as we have today;

25
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:30,446
and if CO2 has a large effect on climate

26
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:33,136
then you should see it in the
temperature reconstruction.

27
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:37,229
If we look at climate from
the geological timeframe,

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,218
We would never suspect CO2
as a major climate driver.

29
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,392
None of the major climate changes
in the last thousand years...

30
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:47,380
...can be explained by CO2.

31
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:50,368
You can't say that CO2
will drive climate.

32
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,361
It surely never did in the past.

33
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:57,043
I've often heard it's said that there is
a consensus of thousands of scientists...

34
00:01:57,342 --> 00:02:00,330
...on the global warming issue
and that humans are causing...

35
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,321
catastrophic changes
in the climate system.

36
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,309
Well, I am one scientist and
there are many that simply...

37
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,805
...think that is not true.

38
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:10,291
Man-made global warming
is no ordinary scientific theory.

39
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:13,278
This morning, the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change made up a...

40
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:16,266
It is presented in the media as
having the stamp of authority

41
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:19,254
of an impressive international organization:

42
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:20,751
"From the IPCC..."

43
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:25,231
The United Nations Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change or "IPCC".

44
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:29,714
The IPCC, line any UN body,
is political;

45
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:33,202
the final conclusions
are politically driven.

46
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:38,678
This claim, that the IPCC is the world's
top one thousand five hundred...

47
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:41,666
or two thousand five hundred scientists...

48
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:45,651
you look at the bibliographies of the
people, and it's simply not true.

49
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:48,639
There are quite a number
of non scientists.

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,631
And to build the number up
to twenty five hundred

51
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:54,616
they had to start taking group reviewers
and government people, and so on,

52
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:57,105
anyone who ever came
close to them,

53
00:02:57,106 --> 00:03:02,086
and none of them are asked
to agree, many of them disagree.

54
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:06,568
Those people who are specialists
but don't agree with the polemic,

55
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,557
and resigned (and there have
been a number that I know of)

56
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:12,545
they are simply put
on the author list

57
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:16,530
and become part of these two thousand
five hundred of the world's top scientists.

58
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,518
People have decided they have
to convince other people

59
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,502
that since no scientist desagrees,
you shouldn't disagree either.

60
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,491
But that, whenever you
hear that is science,

61
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:27,986
that's pure propaganda.

62
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,715
This is the story of how
a theory about climate...

63
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:35,207
...turned into a political ideology.

64
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:39,192
I don't even like to call it the
environmental movement anymore,

65
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:41,682
because really it is a
political activist movement,

66
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:45,170
and they have become hugely
influential at a global level.

67
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:51,493
It is the story of the distortion
of a whole area of science.

68
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,373
Climate scientists need there to be
a problem in order to get funding.

69
00:03:56,573 --> 00:04:01,055
We have a vested interest in
creating panic because then,

70
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:03,845
money will flow to climate science.

71
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:07,828
There's one thing you
shouldn't say and that is:

72
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:09,821
this might not be a problem.

73
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,805
It is the story of how a
political campaign...

74
00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:16,296
...turned into a burocratic
bandwagon.

75
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:19,780
The fact to the matter is that
tenths of thousands of jobs...

76
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,773
...depend upon global
warming right now.

77
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,261
It's a big business.

78
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:29,742
It's become a great
industry in itself

79
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:33,230
and if the whole global
warming farrago collapsed,

80
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,218
there would be an awful
lot of people...

81
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:38,709
out of jobs and looking
for work.

82
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:42,688
This is a story of censorship
and intimidation.

83
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:48,665
I've seen and heard that
spitting fury at anybody

84
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,658
who might
disagree with them,

85
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:54,643
which is not the scientific way.

86
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:59,622
It is the story of Westeners invoking
the threat of climatic disasters

87
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:02,610
to hinder vital industrial
progress in the developing world.

88
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,587
One clear thing that emerges from
the all environmental debate...

89
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:13,567
is the point that there's somebody
keen to kill the African dream.

90
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:16,060
And the African dream is to develop.

91
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:22,532
The environmental movement has evolved
into the strongest force there is...

92
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:26,019
for preventing development
in the developing countries.

93
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,493
The global warming story
is the cautionary tale...

94
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:36,477
...of how a media scare became
the defining idea of a generation.

95
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:41,459
The whole global warming business
has become like a religion...

96
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:46,437
and people who disagree
are called heretics.

97
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,427
I'm a heretic.

98
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:53,413
The makers of this program,
all heretics.

99
00:06:05,378 --> 00:06:09,360
In 2005, a House of Lords enquiry
was setup to examine...

100
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:12,349
the scientific evidence of
man-made global warming.

101
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,334
A leading figure in that enquiry
was Lord Lawson of Blaby

102
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:20,318
who as Chancellor of the Exchequer
in the 1980's was the first politician...

103
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,805
to commit government money
to global warming research.

104
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:28,786
We had a very very thorough
varied took evidence...

105
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:33,269
from a whole lot of people expert
in this area and produced a report.

106
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,746
What surprised me was to discover how
weak and uncertain the science was.

107
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:42,732
In fact, there are more and
more thoughtful people,

108
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:46,219
some of them a little bit frightened
to come out in the open,

109
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,955
but who quietly privately and
some of then publicly are saying:

110
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:53,243
"hang on, wait a minute:
this simply doesn't add up"

111
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:58,669
We are told that the Earth's
climate is changing:

112
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:04,146
but the Earth's climate
is always changing!

113
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:07,634
In Earth's long history, there have
been countless periods...

114
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,622
when it was much warmer
and much cooler than it is today

115
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:14,106
when much of the world was
covered by tropical forests

116
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:16,099
or else vasts ice sheets.

117
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,586
The climate has always changed,
and changed without any help

118
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:22,076
from us, humans.

119
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:27,056
We can trace the present warming
trend back at least two hundred years,

120
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:30,045
to the end of a very cold
period in Earth's history.

121
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:32,037
This cold spell?

122
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,025
It's known to climatologists
as the Little Ice Age.

123
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:45,981
In the 14th century, Europe
plunged into the Little Ice Age,

124
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:50,962
and when we look for evidences of this,
are the old illustrations and prints,

125
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:54,946
and pictures of old father Thames

126
00:07:54,947 --> 00:07:59,927
because during the hardest and
toughest winters of that Little Ice Age

127
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:04,907
the Thames would freeze over
and there were wonderful ice fairs

128
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:07,895
held on the Thames
skating, and people actually

129
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,884
selling things on the ice.

130
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:16,860
If we look back further in time,
before the Little Ice Age,

131
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:18,852
We find a barmy golden era

132
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:20,844
when temperatures where
higher than they are today

133
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:24,830
a time known to climatologists
as the Medieval Warm Period.

134
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:35,287
It's important people know
that climate enabled

135
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:39,272
a quite different lifestyle
in the medieval period.

136
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:45,248
We have this view today that warming is
going to have apocalyptic outcomes.

137
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:48,735
In fact, wherever you describe
this warm period

138
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,723
it appears to be associated
with riches.

139
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:56,704
In Europe, this was the great age
of the cathedral builders

140
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:59,195
a time when, according to Chaucer,

141
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:02,183
vineyards flourished even
in the North of England

142
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:06,663
All over the City on London there
are little memories of the vineyards

143
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:09,651
that grew in the medieval warm period,

144
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:13,638
So this was a wonderfully rich time.

145
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,127
And this little church, in a
sense, symbolizes it

146
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:19,616
as it comes from a period
of great wealth.

147
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:23,600
Going back in time further still,
before the medieval warm period,

148
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:26,588
we find more warm spells?

149
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:29,576
including a very prolonged period
during the Bronze Age

150
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:32,564
known to geologists as
the Holocene Maximum,

151
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:34,557
where temperatures were significantly...

152
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:37,545
higher than they are now
for more than three milennia.

153
00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:41,129
If we go back 8000 years
in the Holocene period,

154
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,517
our current interglacial, who is
much warmer than it is today

155
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:47,505
now the polar bears obviously
survived that period

156
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:49,497
they are with us today

157
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:52,487
they are very adaptable and
these warm periods in the past

158
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:57,466
(we call hipsy thermals),
posed no problem for them.

159
00:09:58,461 --> 00:10:01,449
Climate variation in the
past is clearly natural

160
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:05,432
so why do we think is
any different today?

161
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:09,667
In the current alarm about
global warming

162
00:10:09,668 --> 00:10:12,159
the culprit is industrial society.

163
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:16,889
Thanks to modern industry luxuries
once enjoyed exclusively by the rich

164
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,876
are now available in abundance
to ordinary people.

165
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:22,864
Novel technologies have made
life easier and richer;

166
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:26,153
modern transport and communications
have made the world...

167
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:28,146
...seem less foreign and distant.

168
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:31,329
Industrial progress has
changed our lives.

169
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,621
But has it also changed
our climate?

170
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,557
According to the theory of
man-made global warming,

171
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:40,746
industrial growth should cause
the temperature to rise,

172
00:10:41,293 --> 00:10:42,786
but does it?

173
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:47,467
Anyone who goes around and says
that CO2 is responsible

174
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:50,257
...of the warming of the 20th century...

175
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:53,744
hasn't looked at the
basic numbers.

176
00:10:56,733 --> 00:11:00,716
Industrial production in the early
decades of the 20th century...

177
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:03,704
...was still in its infancy restricted
to only a few countries...

178
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,692
handicapped by war and
economic depression.

179
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:10,676
After the Second World War
things changed.

180
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:14,660
Consumer goods like refrigerators and
washing machines and TVs and cars...

181
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:18,645
began to be mass-produced
for an international market.

182
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:22,629
Historians call this global
explosion of industrial activity

183
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,617
the post-war economic boom.

184
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:29,602
So how does the industrial story
compare with the temperature record?

185
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,586
Since the mid 19th century
the Earth's temperature...

186
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:36,574
has risen by just of a
half a degree Celsius.

187
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,562
But this warming began
long before cars...

188
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:42,053
and planes were even invented:

189
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:47,529
What's more, most of the rise in
temperature ocurred before 1940,

190
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,020
during the period when
industrial production...

191
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:53,009
was relatively insignificant.

192
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,002
After the Second Wold War,

193
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:56,994
during the post-war economic boom,

194
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:58,985
temperatures, in theory,
should have shot up,

195
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:01,974
but they didn't,
they fell;

196
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:05,960
not for one or two years,
but for four decades.

197
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,450
In fact, paradoxically, it wasn't
until the world...

198
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:12,433
economic recession in the 1970's
that they stopped falling.

199
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:19,406
CO2 began increase
exponentially in about 1940

200
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:25,383
but the temperature actually
began to decrease in 1940,

201
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:31,359
continued to about 1975
so this is the opposite relation.

202
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,332
When the CO2 increasing rapidly
but yet the temperature decreasing

203
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:42,813
then we cannot say that CO2
and the temperature go together.

204
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:45,803
Temperature went up significantly
up to 1940,

205
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:49,289
...when human production
of CO2 was relative low,

206
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,277
and then in the post war years,
when industry...

207
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:55,264
and the whole economies
of the world really got going,

208
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:58,254
and human production
of CO2 just soared

209
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:00,245
the global temperature
was going down.

210
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,234
In other words: the facts
didn' fit the theory.

211
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:05,724
Trusted time when,

212
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:08,714
after the Second World War
industry was booming,

213
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:14,689
CO2 was increasing and yet
the Earth was getting cooler...

214
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,675
and starting off scares of
a coming Ice Age,

215
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:22,959
it made absolutely no sense,
it still doesn't make sense.

216
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:28,631
Why do we suppose that CO2 is
responsible for our changing climate?

217
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:34,608
CO2 forms only a very small
part of the Earth's atmosphere.

218
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:38,095
In fact we measure changes
in the level of atmospheric CO2

219
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:40,587
in tenths of parts per million.

220
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:45,567
If you take CO2 as a percentage
of all the gases in the atmosphere

221
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:48,556
--the Oxygen, the Nitrogen
and Argon and so on--

222
00:13:48,557 --> 00:13:51,543
...is 0.054 percent

223
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:53,536
and it's an incredibly small portion

224
00:13:53,537 --> 00:13:55,528
and then of course you've got
to take that portion...

225
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:57,520
that supposedly humans are adding

226
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:59,513
(which is the focus of all the concern)

227
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,504
and it gets even smaller.

228
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:04,492
Although CO2 is a greenhouse gas,

229
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:08,477
greenhouse gases themselves only
form a small part of the atmosphere.

230
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:11,465
What's more, CO2 is a relatively
minor greenhouse gas.

231
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:16,446
The atmosphere is made up
of multitude of gases

232
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:19,434
a small percentage of them
we call greenhouse gases

233
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:22,422
and of that very small percentage
of these greenhouse gases

234
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:26,905
a 95% of it is water vapour, it's the
most important greenhouse gas.

235
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:30,889
Water vapour is a greenhouse gas, by
far the most important greenhouse gas.

236
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:35,369
So is there any way of checking whether
the recent warming was due...

237
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,362
to an increase in greenhouse gas?

238
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:42,044
There is only one way to tell and
that is to look up in the sky,

239
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:46,627
or a part of the sky known to
scientists as the troposphere.

240
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:51,804
If it's greenhouse warming,
you get more warming...

241
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:54,295
in the middle of the troposphere

242
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:56,785
(the first 10-12 km of the atmosphere)

243
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:58,778
than you do at the surface.

244
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:01,766
There are good theoretical
reasons for that,

245
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,754
having to do with how
the greenhouse works.

246
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,742
The greenhouse effect
works like this:

247
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:09,735
the Sun sends its heat
down to Earth:

248
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:11,728
if it weren't for greenhouse gases,

249
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:14,716
this solar radiation would
bounce back into space,

250
00:15:14,717 --> 00:15:17,205
leaving the planet cold
and uninhabitable.

251
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:21,189
Greenhouse gas traps the scaping
heat in the Earth's troposphere,

252
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,177
a few miles above the surface.

253
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:26,169
And it's here, according
to the climate models,

254
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,161
the rate of warming should be highest

255
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:31,149
if it's greenhouse gas
that's causing it.

256
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,633
All the models, everyone of them,

257
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,621
calculates that the warming
should be faster

258
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:42,108
as you go up from the surface
into the atmosphere.

259
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:46,589
That in fact the maximum warming

260
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,570
over the Equator should take place
at an altitude of about 10 km.

261
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:57,048
A scientist largely responsible
for measuring the temperature...

262
00:15:57,049 --> 00:16:00,535
in the Earth's atmosphere
is Professor John Christie.

263
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:05,517
In 1991 he was awarded NASA's medal
for exceptional scientific achievement,

264
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:11,492
and in 1996 received a special award from
the American Meteorological Society

265
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:14,980
for fundamentally advancing
our ability to monitor climate.

266
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:19,463
He was a lead author...

267
00:16:19,464 --> 00:16:23,447
on the UN's Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change or IPCC.

268
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:29,921
There are two ways to take
the temperature...

269
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:34,404
in the Earth's atmosphere:
satellites and weather balloons.

270
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:42,372
What we found consistently is that,
in a great part of the planet,

271
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:45,858
the bulk of the atmosphere
is not warming as much as...

272
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:48,350
we see at the surface in this region.

273
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,343
And that's a real head
scratcher for us,

274
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,829
because the theory is
pretty straightforward:

275
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,815
and the theory says that
if the surface warms,

276
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,805
the upper atmosphere
should warm rapidly.

277
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:03,292
The rise in temperature of that
part of the atmosphere...

278
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:07,276
...is not very dramatic at all and
really does not match the theory

279
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:10,763
...that climate models are
expressing at this point.

280
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:15,246
One of the problems thas is plaguing
the models is that they predict that,

281
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:18,731
as you go up through the atmosphere
(except in the polar regions),

282
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:21,719
that the rate of warming increases

283
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,708
and it's quite clear, from two datasets,

284
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,204
not just satellite data

285
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:29,690
which everybody talks about,
but from weather ballons data

286
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:32,424
that you dont' see that effect.

287
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:35,666
In fact it looks like the surface
temperatures are warming slightly

288
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,406
more than the upper air temperatures:

289
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:39,901
that's a big difference!!

290
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:44,384
That data gives you a handle
on the fact that what you're seeing

291
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:48,367
is warming that probably is
not due to greenhouse gases.

292
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:52,352
That is, the observations do not
show any increase with the altitude.

293
00:17:52,353 --> 00:17:58,329
In fact, most observations show a slight
decrease in the rate of warming with altitude.

294
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:05,301
So in that sense you can say that the
hypothesis of man-made global warming

295
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:08,289
is falsified by the evidence.

296
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:12,515
So the recent warming of
the Earth happened...

297
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:15,504
...in the wrong place and
at the wrong time.

298
00:18:15,505 --> 00:18:18,989
Most of the warming took place
in the early part of the 20th century,

299
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,232
and ocurred mostly at
the Earth's surface,

300
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,721
the very opposite of what
should have happened...

301
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:26,711
according to the theory of
man-made global warming.

302
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:31,940
I am Al Gore, I used to be Vicepresident
of the United States of America...

303
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:38,414
Former Vicepresident Al Gore's
emotional film "An Inconvenient Truth"

304
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:42,398
...is regarded by many as the definite
popular presentation of the theory...

305
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:43,393
of the man-made global warming.

306
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:48,374
His argument rests on one all
important piece of evidence...

307
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:53,355
taken from icecore surveys in which
scientists drill deep into the ice

308
00:18:53,356 --> 00:18:55,846
to look back into Earth's
climate history,

309
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:57,837
hundreds of thousands of years.

310
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:01,323
The first icecore survey took place
in Vostok, in the Antarctic:

311
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:05,307
what it found, as Al Gore
correctly points out,

312
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:09,291
...was a clear correlation
between CO2 and temperature.

313
00:19:11,286 --> 00:19:14,272
We're going back in time
now 650.000 years...

314
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:17,260
Here's what the temperature
has been on our Earth.

315
00:19:19,254 --> 00:19:24,233
Now one thing that comes and jumps
out at you is the data are fit together

316
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:27,220
(most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard)

317
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:30,209
The relationship is actually
very complicated

318
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,194
but there is one relationship
that is far more powerful

319
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:36,187
than all the others and it is this:

320
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:39,672
when there's more CO2 the
temperature gets warmer.

321
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:43,159
Al Gore says the relationship
between the temperature...

322
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,150
...and CO2 is complicated

323
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,139
but he doesn't say what
these complications are.

324
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:51,127
In fact, there was something
very important...

325
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:53,617
in the icecore data that
he failed to mention:

326
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:58,100
Professor Clark is a leading Arctic
paleoclimatologist who looks back

327
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:02,084
into the Earth's temperature record
tenths of millions of years.

328
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:05,072
When we look at the climate
on long scales

329
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:07,064
we're looking for
geological material...

330
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:09,057
that actually records climate.

331
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:12,045
If we were to take an ice sample
for example we use isotopes...

332
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:16,029
to reconstruct temperature but the
atmosphere that is imprisoned...

333
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,018
in that ice we liberate it and
then we look at the CO2 content.

334
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:23,002
Professor Clark and others
have indeed discovered,

335
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:24,000
as Al Gore says,

336
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:26,989
a link between CO2
and temperature.

337
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:30,475
But what al Gore doesn't say...

338
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:32,467
is that the link is the
wrong way round.

339
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,948
So here we're looking at the
icecore record from Vostok

340
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:40,433
and in the red we see temperature
going up from early time

341
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:42,925
to later time at a very key interval

342
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:45,913
when we came out of a glaciation.

343
00:20:45,914 --> 00:20:50,894
And we see the temperature going up
and then we see the CO2 coming up.

344
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:53,882
CO2 lags behind that increase.

345
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:55,874
It's got a 800 year lag...

346
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,859
...so temperature is leading
CO2 by 800 years.

347
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:03,844
There have now been several
major icecore surveys,

348
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,831
everyone of them shows
the same thing:

349
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,819
the temperature rises or falls,
and then,

350
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,808
after a few hundred years,
CO2 follows.

351
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:18,283
So obviously, CO2 is not the
cause of that warming;

352
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:23,763
In fact we can say that the warming
produced the increase in CO2.

353
00:21:24,262 --> 00:21:28,245
CO2 clearly cannot be causing
temperature changes,

354
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,491
it's a product of temperature.

355
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:31,981
it's following temperature
changes.

356
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:35,467
The icecore record goes
to the very heart...

357
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,460
...of the problem we have here.

358
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:41,443
They said: "if the CO2 increases
in the atmosphere,

359
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:45,428
...as a greenhouse gas,
then the temperature will go up".

360
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,417
But the icecore record
shows exactly the opposite:

361
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:51,405
so the fundamental assumption,
the EMOs fundamental assumption

362
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:54,393
...of the whole theory
of climate change...

363
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:57,880
...due tu humans,
is shown to be wrong.

364
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,365
But how can it be that
higher temperatures lead...

365
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:04,353
to more CO2 in the atmosphere?

366
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:06,845
To understand this,
we must first restate...

367
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:10,329
the obvious point that CO2
is a natural gas...

368
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,821
...produced by all living things.

369
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:16,807
Few things annoy me more
than to hear people...

370
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:20,293
talking about CO2
as being apollutant:

371
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,773
you are made of CO2,
I'm made of CO2,

372
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:27,763
CO2 is how living things grow.

373
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,742
What's more, humans are not
the main source of CO2.

374
00:22:32,991 --> 00:22:37,723
Humans produce a small fraction
in the single digits percentage-wise

375
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:40,712
of the CO2 that it is produced
in the atmosphere.

376
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:46,934
Volcanos produce more CO2 each year
than all the factories and cars and planes

377
00:22:46,935 --> 00:22:50,919
and other sources of man-made
CO2 put together.

378
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:53,907
More still comes from
animals and bacteria,

379
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:57,891
which produce about a 150
gigatonnes of CO2 each year,

380
00:22:57,892 --> 00:23:00,881
compared to a mere 6.5
gigatonnes from humans.

381
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:04,864
An even larger source of CO2
is dying vegetation,

382
00:23:04,865 --> 00:23:07,853
from falling leaves for example
in the autumn.

383
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:12,335
But the biggest source of CO2
by far is the oceans.

384
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:20,802
Carl Wunsch is Professor
of oceanography at MIT.

385
00:23:20,803 --> 00:23:22,794
He was also a Visiting Professor...

386
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:24,289
...in Oceanography
at Harvard University,

387
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,277
...and University College in London,
and a Senior Visiting Fellow...

388
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:30,265
in Mathematics and Physics
at the University of Cambridge.

389
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,745
He's the author of four major
textbooks on Oceanography.

390
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:41,222
The ocean is the major
reservoir into which CO2 goes...

391
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:44,211
...when it comes out
of the atmosphere.

392
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:48,195
or to, from which it is readmitted
to the atmosphere.

393
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:54,670
If you heat the surface of the
ocean it tends to emit CO2...

394
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:59,153
So similarly if you cool
the ocean surface,

395
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:03,135
...the ocean can dissolve
more CO2.

396
00:24:04,132 --> 00:24:07,120
So the warmer the oceans,
the more CO2 they produce...

397
00:24:07,121 --> 00:24:10,109
and the cooler they are,
the more the suck in.

398
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:13,595
But why is there a timelag
of hundreds of years...

399
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:17,084
between a change in temperature
and a change in the amount of CO2...

400
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:20,073
...going into or out of the sea?

401
00:24:20,568 --> 00:24:24,052
The reason is that oceans
are so big and so deep...

402
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:26,542
they take literally hundreds
of years...

403
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:28,535
...to warm up and to cool down.

404
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:33,017
This timelag means the oceans
have what scientists call...

405
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:36,005
...a memory of temperature changes.

406
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:38,993
The ocean has a memory of past events,

407
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:43,974
running out as far as
ten thousand years,

408
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:45,968
so for example if somebody says:

409
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:48,956
"Oh, I'm seeing changes
in the North Atlantic,

410
00:24:48,957 --> 00:24:52,939
...this must mean that the
climate system is changing",

411
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,430
it may only mean that
something happened...

412
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:58,418
...in a remote part of the ocean
decades or hundreds of years ago

413
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:02,402
whose effects are now beginning
to show up in the North Atlantic.

414
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:05,391
The current warming
began long...

415
00:25:05,392 --> 00:25:07,783
...before people had cars
or electric lights.

416
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,624
In the past 150 years,

417
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:13,112
the temperature has risen
just over half a degree celsius.

418
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:17,096
But most of that rise
occurred before 1940.

419
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:19,586
Since that time, the
temperature...

420
00:25:19,587 --> 00:25:22,575
has fallen for four decades,
and risen for three.

421
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:25,065
There's no evidence at all...

422
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,056
...from Earth's long
climate history...

423
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:30,543
...that CO2 has ever determined
global temperatures.

424
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:35,770
But if CO2 doesn't drive
Earth's climate, what does?

425
00:25:46,432 --> 00:25:49,419
The common belief that CO2
is driving climate change...

426
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,905
is at odds with much of
the available scientific data.

427
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,391
Data from weather
balloons and satellites,

428
00:25:56,392 --> 00:26:00,376
from icecore surveys and from
the historical temperature records.

429
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:05,854
But if CO2 isn't driving climate,
what is?

430
00:26:08,845 --> 00:26:11,334
Isn't it bizarre the thing
that it's humans,

431
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:14,820
you know when we're filling apart car,
turning on our lights,

432
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:17,309
that we are the ones
controlling climate?

433
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:22,291
Just look in the sky, look at
that massive thing, the Sun.

434
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:27,769
Even humans, at
our present 6.5 billion

435
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,761
are minute relative to that.

436
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:36,733
In the late 1980's, solar physicist
Piers Corbin decided to try...

437
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:39,721
a radically new way of
forecasting the weather.

438
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:43,705
Despite the huge resources
of the official Met Office,

439
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:47,690
Corbin's new technique consistently
produced more accurate results;

440
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:52,672
He was held in the national press
as the super weatherman.

441
00:26:53,668 --> 00:26:56,655
The secret of his success
was the Sun.

442
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:01,136
The origin of solar weather technique
of long range forecasting...

443
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:04,127
came originally from study of sunspots

444
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:06,118
and the desire to predict those,

445
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:09,105
...and then I realized there was
actually much more interest in...

446
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:11,098
...to use the Sun to
predict the weather.

447
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:21,058
Sunspots, we now know,
are intense magnetic fields...

448
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:25,044
...which appear at times
of higher solar activity.

449
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,534
But for many hundreds of years,

450
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:29,526
long before this was
properly understood,

451
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:31,517
the astronomers around
the world used to count...

452
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:33,509
...the number of
sunspots in the belief,,,

453
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,499
...that more spots
heralded warmer weather.

454
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:42,905
In 1893 the British astronomer
Edward Maunder observed...

455
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:45,893
that during the Little Ice Age
there were barely

456
00:27:45,894 --> 00:27:47,886
any spots visible on the Sun.

457
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:51,372
A period of solar inactivity
which became known as...

458
00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:52,867
...the Maunder Minimum.

459
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:57,847
But how reliable are sunspots
as an indicator of the weather?

460
00:27:59,838 --> 00:28:03,821
I decided to test it by gambling
on the weather through William Hill,

461
00:28:03,822 --> 00:28:06,810
against what the Met Office
said was, you know,

462
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,804
a normal expectation.

463
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:12,291
And I won money month after
month after month after month.

464
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:16,272
Last winter the Met Office
said it could be...

465
00:28:16,273 --> 00:28:18,763
...or would be an
exceptionally cold winter;

466
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,550
We said: "no, that is nonsense,
it's gonna be close to normal"

467
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:26,234
and we specifically said
when it would be cold,

468
00:28:26,235 --> 00:28:29,721
after Christmas and February:
we were right, they were wrong.

469
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,702
In 1991, senior scientists of the
Danish Meteorological Institute

470
00:28:34,703 --> 00:28:38,686
decided to compile a record
of sunspots in the 20th century...

471
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:41,178
and compare it with the
temperature record.

472
00:28:42,672 --> 00:28:45,660
What they found, was an
incredibly close correlation...

473
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:47,650
between what the
Sun was doing...

474
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:49,643
and changes in temperature
on Earth.

475
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:55,620
Solar activity they found
rose sharply to 1940,

476
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:58,607
fell back for four decades
until the 1970's...

477
00:28:58,608 --> 00:29:00,599
...and then rose again after that.

478
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:07,573
When we saw this correlation...

479
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:12,552
between the temperature and
solar activity or sunspot cyclings,

480
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:14,546
then the people said to us:

481
00:29:14,547 --> 00:29:16,537
"OK, it can be just a coincidence",

482
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:20,522
so how can we prove that
it's not just a coincidence?

483
00:29:20,523 --> 00:29:23,509
Well, one obvious thing is
to have a longer timeseries...

484
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,494
...or different timeseries
and we went back in time.

485
00:29:27,992 --> 00:29:30,979
So Professor Friis Christensen
and his colleagues examined...

486
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,967
...four hundreds years
of astronomical records...

487
00:29:33,968 --> 00:29:35,960
to compare sunspot activity...

488
00:29:35,961 --> 00:29:37,952
...against temperature variation.

489
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,443
Once again, they found...

490
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:41,936
that variations in solar activity...

491
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:43,432
were intimate linked...

492
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,922
...to temperature
variation on Earth.

493
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,403
It was the Sun, it seemed,
not CO2, or anything else,

494
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:53,391
that was driving changes
in the climate.

495
00:29:54,388 --> 00:29:56,379
In a way, it's not surprising:

496
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,373
the Sun affects us directly...

497
00:29:58,374 --> 00:30:00,863
...of course when it
sends down its heat.

498
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:02,355
But we now know...

499
00:30:02,356 --> 00:30:05,344
the Sun also affects
indirectly through clouds.

500
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:09,828
Clouds have a powerful cooling effect,

501
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:11,323
but how are they formed?

502
00:30:11,324 --> 00:30:14,310
In the early 20th century
scientists discovered that...

503
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:16,303
the Earth was constantly
being bombarded...

504
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:17,797
...by subatomic particles.

505
00:30:18,795 --> 00:30:21,783
These particles, which
they called cosmic rays,

506
00:30:21,784 --> 00:30:25,766
originated (it was believed)
from exploding supernovae,

507
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:27,758
far beyond our Solar System.

508
00:30:28,755 --> 00:30:30,748
When the particles coming down

509
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:33,239
meet water vapour rising
up from the sea,

510
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,227
they form water droplets
and make clouds.

511
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,210
But when the Sun
is more active...

512
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:41,202
and the solar wind is strong,

513
00:30:41,203 --> 00:30:44,691
fewer particles get through
and fewer clouds are formed.

514
00:30:48,177 --> 00:30:50,167
Just how powerful
this effect was,

515
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:52,159
became clear only recently,

516
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,651
when an astrophysicist,
Professor Nir Shaviv...

517
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,644
...decided to compare
his own record...

518
00:30:56,645 --> 00:30:58,635
of cloud-forming
cosmic rays...

519
00:30:58,636 --> 00:31:01,623
with the temperature record
created by a geologist,

520
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:03,118
Professor Jan Veizer...

521
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,610
...going back six hundred
million years.

522
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:10,091
What they found was that
when cosmic rays went up,

523
00:31:10,092 --> 00:31:12,083
...the temperature went down;

524
00:31:12,084 --> 00:31:15,072
when cosmic rays went down,
the temperature went up.

525
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:19,352
Clouds and the Earth's climate
were wery closely linked.

526
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:22,340
To see how close,
you just flip the lines.

527
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:24,333
We just compared the graph,

528
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:26,326
just put them one upon the other

529
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:29,314
and it was just amazing
and Jan Veizer looked at me and said you know,

530
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:32,302
We have very explosive data here.

531
00:31:32,303 --> 00:31:36,286
I've never seen such a
vastly different records...

532
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:38,279
coming together
so beautifully...

533
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,765
to show really what's happening
over that long period of time.

534
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:45,749
The climate was controlled
by the clouds.

535
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,738
The clouds were controlled
by cosmic rays,

536
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:52,226
and the cosmic rays were
controlled by the Sun.

537
00:31:53,222 --> 00:31:55,712
It all came down to the Sun.

538
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:03,182
If you had X-ray eyes

539
00:32:03,183 --> 00:32:06,169
what appears as a nice
friendly yellow ball...

540
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:09,158
...would appear like a raging tiger.

541
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:20,115
The Sun is an incredibly
violent beast...

542
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:25,096
..and is raying out great
explosions...

543
00:32:25,097 --> 00:32:28,084
and puffs of gas...

544
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:31,072
...and endless solar wind...

545
00:32:31,073 --> 00:32:34,061
that's forever rushing
past the Earth.

546
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:36,053
There, in a certain sense,

547
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:40,037
inside the atmosphere
of the Sun...

548
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:43,524
the intensity of its magnetic
field...

549
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:45,517
more than doubled...

550
00:32:45,518 --> 00:32:47,509
...during the 20th century.

551
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:52,986
In 2005, astrophysicists
from Harvard University...

552
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:54,978
published the following graph...

553
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:57,966
in the official Journal of the
American Geophysical Union:

554
00:32:57,967 --> 00:33:00,454
The blue line represents
temperature change...

555
00:33:00,455 --> 00:33:03,942
in the Arctic over the
past hundred years...

556
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:07,927
and here is the rising CO2
over the same period.

557
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:12,108
The two are not
obviously connected.

558
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:15,096
But now look again at
the temperature record...

559
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:16,593
and at this red line...

560
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:19,581
which depicts variations
in solar activity...

561
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:23,562
over the past century as recorded
independently by scientists...

562
00:33:23,563 --> 00:33:26,053
from NASA and American's
National Oceanic...

563
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,047
...and Atmospheric Administration.

564
00:33:28,795 --> 00:33:30,787
Solar activity over the
last hundred years...

565
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:32,779
or over the last several
hundred years...

566
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,767
correlates very nicely
on a decadal basis...

567
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:38,010
with sea ice and Arctic
temperatures.

568
00:33:39,257 --> 00:33:41,247
To the Harvard astrophysicists...

569
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:45,231
and many other scientists
the conclusion is inescapable:

570
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:48,220
The Sun is driving
climate change,

571
00:33:48,221 --> 00:33:50,212
CO2 is irrelevant.

572
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:55,138
But why, if this is so, are we
bombarded day after day...

573
00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:58,126
with news items about
man-made global warming?

574
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:00,618
Why do so many people
in the media...

575
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:03,606
and elsewhere regard it
as an undisputed fact?

576
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,587
To understand the power
of global warming theory,

577
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,575
we must tell the story
of how it came about.

578
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:20,639
"The weather satellite depicts
a planet that grieves...

579
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,628
...for his lost harvests
and coming to the..."

580
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:25,122
Doom laid and predictions...

581
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:27,613
about climate change
are not new.

582
00:34:27,614 --> 00:34:31,098
In 1974 the BBC warned us of
impending disasters

583
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:33,092
that might seem
strangely familiar.

584
00:34:33,093 --> 00:34:34,586
Again and again,
the newsreels...

585
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:37,326
have been showing us
disasters of the weather:

586
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,821
...the American Midwest suffered...

587
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:41,260
...its worst droughts
since the 1930's...

588
00:34:41,261 --> 00:34:43,253
...and tornados were
on the rampage.

589
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,236
And what was going to be
the cause of these disasters?

590
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:48,831
The man behind the series was...

591
00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:51,819
former New Scientist Editor,
Nigel Calder.

592
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,808
In "The weather Machine"
we reported...

593
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:57,796
...the mainstream
opinion of the time

594
00:34:57,797 --> 00:35:01,779
...which was global cooling and
the threat of a new ice age.

595
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,270
"Nature's ice dwarfs us and..."

596
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,508
After four decades of
falling temperatures...

597
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:09,501
experts warn that
a cooler world...

598
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,731
...would have catastrophic
consequences.

599
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:14,728
"There's the ever-present
threat of a big freeze.

600
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:17,718
Will a new ice age
claim our lands...

601
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,710
...and bury our Northern cities?"

602
00:35:20,355 --> 00:35:22,346
But in mid to doom and gloom

603
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:24,338
there was one voice of hope:

604
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:26,932
a Swedish scientist called Bert Bolin,

605
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:29,920
...tentatively suggested
that man-made CO2...

606
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:31,913
might help to warm the world,

607
00:35:31,914 --> 00:35:33,905
although he wasn't sure:

608
00:35:33,906 --> 00:35:35,400
And there's a lot of oil,

609
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,889
and there are vast
amounts of coal...

610
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,877
and they seem to be burning
with an ever increasing rate

611
00:35:40,878 --> 00:35:42,870
and if we go on doing this,

612
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:45,858
in about fifty years time,
the climate may be...

613
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:47,849
a few degrees warmer
than today...

614
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,345
we just don't know.

615
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,481
We were also the first to put

616
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:56,814
Bert Bolin of Sweden
on international television

617
00:35:56,815 --> 00:35:59,802
talking about the dangers of CO2

618
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:03,787
and I remember being bitterly
criticized by top experts

619
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:07,274
...for indulging him
in his fantasy.

620
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:10,906
At the height of the
cooling scare in the 70's...

621
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,251
Bert Bolin's eccentric theory...

622
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:16,239
of man-made global
warming seemed absurd...

623
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,227
two things happened
to change that:

624
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:22,216
First, temperatures
started to rise

625
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:25,204
and second, the miners
went on strike.

626
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,176
To Margaret Thatcher,

627
00:36:32,177 --> 00:36:34,169
energy was a political problem.

628
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:38,154
In the early 70's the oil crisis had
plunged the world into recession

629
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,647
and the miners had dropped down...

630
00:36:39,648 --> 00:36:41,640
Ted Heath's conservative government

631
00:36:42,385 --> 00:36:46,121
Mrs. Thatcher was determined
the same would not happen to her

632
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:48,114
she set out to break their power.

633
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,097
"What we have seen in this country...

634
00:36:52,098 --> 00:36:57,078
is the emergence of an
organized revolutionary minority

635
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:03,055
who are prepared to exploit industrial
disputes but whose real aim is...

636
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:05,046
the breakdown of law and order

637
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:09,031
and the distraction of democratic
parlamentary government."

638
00:37:09,032 --> 00:37:11,023
The politization of this subject...

639
00:37:11,024 --> 00:37:15,007
started with Margaret Thatcher.

640
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:17,000
She was very concerned, always

641
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,988
(I remember when I was Secretary
of State for Energy),

642
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,980
to promote nuclear power,

643
00:37:21,981 --> 00:37:25,964
long before the issue of
climate change came up,

644
00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:29,948
because she was concerned
about energy security

645
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:31,941
and she didn't trust the Middle East

646
00:37:31,942 --> 00:37:34,432
and she didn't trust the
National Union of Mineworkers

647
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:37,420
so she didn't trust oil
and she didn't trust coal,

648
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,414
so therefore she thought
we really had...

649
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:41,404
...to push ahead with nuclear power.

650
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:46,305
And then, when the climate change
global warming thing came up,

651
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,301
she thought this is great,

652
00:37:47,302 --> 00:37:48,796
this is another argument

653
00:37:48,797 --> 00:37:51,288
because it doesn't have
any CO2 emissions

654
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:53,778
this is another argument
why we should go for nuclear

655
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:56,266
and that is what she
was really largely saying

656
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:58,257
it's been misrepresented
since then.

657
00:37:58,258 --> 00:38:00,250
And so she said to the scientists,

658
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:02,243
she went to the Royal Society
and she said:

659
00:38:02,244 --> 00:38:08,219
"there's money on the table
for you to prove this stuff"

660
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,207
so of course they went
and did that.

661
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,697
Inevitably the moment politicians

662
00:38:13,698 --> 00:38:15,690
put that weight behind something

663
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:18,678
and attach their name to
it in some ways of course

664
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,667
money will flow,
that's the way it goes

665
00:38:21,668 --> 00:38:25,650
and inevitably research,
development, institutions,

666
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:28,141
started to bubble up
(if you put it that way)

667
00:38:28,142 --> 00:38:30,633
which are going to
be researching climate

668
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,623
but with a particular emphasis

669
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:36,111
on the relationship between
CO2 and temperature.

670
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,242
At the request of Mrs. Thatcher,

671
00:38:39,243 --> 00:38:42,231
the UK Met Office set up
a climate modelling unit

672
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:43,228
which provided the basis...

673
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:46,215
for a new international
committee called

674
00:38:46,216 --> 00:38:50,200
the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change or IPCC.

675
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:54,681
They came out with the first big report

676
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:58,168
which predicted climatic disaster

677
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,161
as a result of global warming

678
00:39:00,162 --> 00:39:04,145
I remember going to the
scientific press conference

679
00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:07,134
and being amazed by two things:

680
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:11,117
first, the simplicity and
eloquence of the message

681
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:14,106
(and the vigour with which was delivered)

682
00:39:14,107 --> 00:39:18,090
and secondly, the total disregard

683
00:39:18,091 --> 00:39:22,074
of all climate science up to that time,

684
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:26,058
including incidentally
the role of the Sun,

685
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:30,043
which had been the subject
of a major meeting...

686
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:34,027
at the Royal Society just
a few months earlier.

687
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:38,011
But the new emphasis
on man-made CO2

688
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:40,004
as a possible environmental problem

689
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,997
didn't just appeal to Mrs. Thatcher.

690
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:47,472
It was certainly something very favourable

691
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:49,964
to the environmental idea,

692
00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:52,953
what I call the medieval
environmentalism,

693
00:39:52,954 --> 00:39:54,945
a sort of "let's get back

694
00:39:54,946 --> 00:39:57,933
to the way things were
in medieval times

695
00:39:57,934 --> 00:40:00,921
and get rid of all these
dreadful cars and machines"

696
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:04,906
They loved it, because
CO2 was for them...

697
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:07,894
...an emblem of industrialization.

698
00:40:08,891 --> 00:40:11,878
While CO2 clearly is
an industrial gas...

699
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:17,855
and tried and self-tied
in with economic growth

700
00:40:17,856 --> 00:40:23,831
with transportation in cars,
with what we call civilization,

701
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:27,815
and there are forces in the
environmental movement

702
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:30,803
that are simply against
the economic growth,

703
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,796
they think that's bad.

704
00:40:33,293 --> 00:40:35,784
It could be used to
legitimize...

705
00:40:35,785 --> 00:40:38,772
a whole sweet of myths
that already existed:

706
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:42,756
anticar, antigrowth,
antidevelopment...

707
00:40:42,757 --> 00:40:47,738
and, above all, anti that
great Satan: the US.

708
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:50,726
Patrick Moore is considered...

709
00:40:50,727 --> 00:40:52,719
one of the foremost
environmentalists

710
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,960
...of his generation.

711
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:55,953
He is co-founder of Greenpeace.

712
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,937
The shift to climate being
a major focal point

713
00:40:59,938 --> 00:41:02,925
came about for two
very distinct reasons:

714
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:05,913
the first reason was
because by the mid 80's

715
00:41:05,914 --> 00:41:09,899
a majority of people now agreed
with all of the reasonable things

716
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,887
we in the environmental movement
were saying they should do;

717
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:15,377
now when a majority of
people agree with you,

718
00:41:15,378 --> 00:41:18,366
it's pretty hard to remain
confrontational with them,

719
00:41:18,367 --> 00:41:21,851
and so the only way to remain
anti-establishment was...

720
00:41:21,852 --> 00:41:24,840
to adopt ever more
extreme positions.

721
00:41:24,841 --> 00:41:27,827
When I left Greenpeace it was
in the midst of them...

722
00:41:27,828 --> 00:41:30,816
adopting a campaign to
ban chlorine woldwide.

723
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:32,808
Like I said: "You guys,

724
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:35,797
this is one of the elements
in the periodic table you know,

725
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:37,788
I mean, I'm not sure
if that's in our jurisdiction

726
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:39,779
to be banning a whole element".

727
00:41:41,774 --> 00:41:44,761
The other reason that environmental
extremism emerged

728
00:41:44,762 --> 00:41:46,753
was because world communism failed,

729
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,750
the wall came down,

730
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:50,737
and a lot of peaceniks
and political activists

731
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:52,730
moved into the environmental movement,

732
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:55,221
bringing their neo-marxism with them

733
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:56,717
and learnt to use green language

734
00:41:56,718 --> 00:41:57,713
in a very clever way

735
00:41:57,714 --> 00:41:59,955
to cloak agendas that
actually have more...

736
00:41:59,956 --> 00:42:02,889
to do with anticapitalism
and antiglobalization

737
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,380
than they do anything
with ecology or science.

738
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:09,364
The left have been
instantly disoriented

739
00:42:09,365 --> 00:42:13,350
by the manifest failure
of socialism

740
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:16,337
and indeed marxo-communism

741
00:42:16,338 --> 00:42:18,329
as it was tried out,

742
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:22,314
and therefore they still remain
as anticapitalists as they were

743
00:42:22,315 --> 00:42:25,303
but they have to find new
guys for that anticapitalism.

744
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:30,283
And it was a kind of
amazing alliance...

745
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:34,266
from Margaret Thatcher
on the right

746
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:40,243
through to bioleft wing
anticapitalist environmentalists.

747
00:42:40,244 --> 00:42:45,223
That created this kind
of "momentum"...

748
00:42:45,224 --> 00:42:48,213
...behind a looney idea.

749
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,748
By the early 1990's
man-made global warming

750
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:54,735
was no longer a slightly
eccentric theory about climate,

751
00:42:54,736 --> 00:42:57,724
it was a full-blown
political campaign,

752
00:42:57,725 --> 00:43:00,712
it was attracting media
attention those result:

753
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:02,704
more governmental funding.

754
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,692
Prior to Bush the elder,

755
00:43:05,693 --> 00:43:09,677
I think the level of
funding for climate

756
00:43:09,678 --> 00:43:12,665
and climate-related
sciences was...

757
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:16,151
somewhere around the
order of 170 million dollars a year,

758
00:43:16,152 --> 00:43:19,139
which is reasonable for
the size of the field;

759
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,127
it jumped to two billion a year:

760
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:26,112
more than a factor of ten

761
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:30,096
and yes, that changed
a lot I mean,

762
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:34,080
lot of jobs, it brought a lot of new people

763
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:37,068
into it who otherwise
were not interested,

764
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:40,056
so you develop whole cadres
of people whose...

765
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:43,045
only interest in the field was that...

766
00:43:43,046 --> 00:43:46,033
...it was global warming.

767
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:48,025
If I wanted to do research on,

768
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:52,010
shall we say,
the squirrels of Sussex,

769
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:54,997
what I would do,

770
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:57,985
and this is anytime
from 1990 onwards,

771
00:43:57,986 --> 00:44:01,970
I would write my grant
application saying:

772
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:03,964
"I want to investigate...

773
00:44:03,965 --> 00:44:07,947
the not-gathering
behaviour of squirrels,

774
00:44:07,948 --> 00:44:09,939
with special reference

775
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,931
to the effects of
global warming",

776
00:44:12,928 --> 00:44:14,920
and that way I get my money...

777
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:16,912
if I forget to mention
global warming...

778
00:44:16,913 --> 00:44:17,908
I might not get the money.

779
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,895
There's a question in my mind...

780
00:44:20,896 --> 00:44:22,888
that the large amounts of money

781
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:24,881
that have been fed into this particular,

782
00:44:24,882 --> 00:44:26,872
rather small area of science

783
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,865
have distorted the
overall scientific effort.

784
00:44:29,364 --> 00:44:32,849
We're all competing for funds

785
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:38,826
and if your field is the
focus of concern,

786
00:44:38,827 --> 00:44:41,814
then you have done much
less work rationalizing

787
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:43,806
why your field should be funded.

788
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,970
By the 1990's tenths of billions of dollars of government

789
00:44:57,971 --> 00:45:00,958
funding in the US,
UK and elsewhere

790
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:01,955
were being diverted into

791
00:45:01,956 --> 00:45:03,946
research relating
to global warming.

792
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:05,939
A large portion of those funds

793
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,931
went into building computer models

794
00:45:07,932 --> 00:45:10,919
to forecast what the climate
will be in the future.

795
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,908
But how accurate are those models?

796
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:14,904
Doctor Roy Spencer

797
00:45:14,905 --> 00:45:16,897
is a senior scientist
for climate studies

798
00:45:16,898 --> 00:45:19,886
at NASA's Marshall
space flights Center;

799
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,380
he has been awarded medals

800
00:45:21,381 --> 00:45:22,873
for exceptional scientific achievement

801
00:45:22,874 --> 00:45:23,869
in both NASA

802
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:26,857
and the American
Meteorological Society.

803
00:45:27,854 --> 00:45:29,845
Climate models are only as good

804
00:45:29,846 --> 00:45:31,342
as the assumptions that go into them,

805
00:45:31,343 --> 00:45:32,834
and they have hundreds of assumptions.

806
00:45:32,835 --> 00:45:34,330
All it takes as one assumption

807
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,820
to be wrong for the forecast
to be way off.

808
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,309
Climate forecasts are not new,

809
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,299
but in the past scientists
were more modests

810
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,291
about their ability to
predict the weather.

811
00:45:44,787 --> 00:45:47,278
"Any attempt of forecasting
changes of climate...

812
00:45:47,279 --> 00:45:48,774
meets skepticism from the men

813
00:45:48,775 --> 00:45:50,765
who model the weather by computer."

814
00:45:50,766 --> 00:45:52,759
In making decisions
which affect people,

815
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,751
a bad prediction as to what...

816
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,743
the climate of the future will be,

817
00:45:56,744 --> 00:45:58,735
can be far worse than none at all.

818
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:00,727
I'm afraid that our understanding

819
00:46:00,728 --> 00:46:02,718
of the complex weather machine

820
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,712
is not yet good enough to make

821
00:46:04,713 --> 00:46:06,704
a reliable statement of the future.

822
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:13,675
All models assume that man-made CO2

823
00:46:13,676 --> 00:46:16,167
is the main cause of climate change,

824
00:46:16,168 --> 00:46:18,161
rather than the Sun or the clouds.

825
00:46:18,658 --> 00:46:20,649
The analogy I use is like my car

826
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,641
is not running very well

827
00:46:22,642 --> 00:46:25,131
so I'm going to ignore
the engine which is the Sun,

828
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:26,625
and I'm gonna ignore the transmission

829
00:46:26,626 --> 00:46:28,617
which is the water vapour

830
00:46:28,618 --> 00:46:29,614
and I'm gonna look at one

831
00:46:29,615 --> 00:46:30,609
knot at the right rear wheel

832
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:32,602
which is the human-produced CO2.

833
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:35,590
It's that, the science is that bad.

834
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:41,566
If you haven't understood
the climate system,

835
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:44,058
If you haven't understood
all the components...

836
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:45,054
that cause the increase

837
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:49,530
the solar, the CO2, the
water vapour, the clouds

838
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:51,522
and put it all together,

839
00:46:51,523 --> 00:46:53,514
If we haven't got all that

840
00:46:53,515 --> 00:46:55,756
then your model isn't
worth anything.

841
00:46:56,753 --> 00:47:00,240
The range of climate
forecasts varies greatly.

842
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:03,227
These variations are
produced by subtly

843
00:47:03,228 --> 00:47:06,216
altering the assumptions upon
which the models are based.

844
00:47:06,217 --> 00:47:09,954
The runs are so complicated
you can often adjust them

845
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:13,937
in such a way that they
do something very exciting

846
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:17,341
I work with modellers,
I've done modelling and,

847
00:47:17,342 --> 00:47:20,329
with a mathematical model
and you tweak parameters

848
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,021
you can model anything,
you can make it get warmer,

849
00:47:23,022 --> 00:47:25,262
you can make it get colder
by changing things.

850
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:29,495
Since all the models assume

851
00:47:29,496 --> 00:47:31,488
that man-made CO2
causes warming,

852
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:34,477
one obvious way to produce
a more impressive forecast

853
00:47:34,478 --> 00:47:37,465
is to increase the amount
of imagined man-made

854
00:47:37,466 --> 00:47:39,455
CO2 going into the atmosphere.

855
00:47:40,249 --> 00:47:43,735
We put an increase in CO2
in number of 1% per year

856
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:47,719
it's been 0.49% per year
for the last ten years,

857
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,707
0.42 for the ten years before that

858
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:53,198
0.43 for the ten years before that,

859
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:55,190
so the models have twice as much

860
00:47:55,191 --> 00:47:59,175
greenhouse warming
radiation going in them

861
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,166
as is known to be happening.

862
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:03,159
It shouldn't shock that they predict

863
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,151
more warming than is ocurring.

864
00:48:08,638 --> 00:48:10,630
Models predict what the temperature

865
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:13,121
might be in fifty or a hundred years time.

866
00:48:13,618 --> 00:48:15,609
It is one of their peculiars features

867
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:17,601
that long-range climate forecasts

868
00:48:17,602 --> 00:48:19,593
are only proved wrong long

869
00:48:19,594 --> 00:48:21,586
after peope have
forgotten about them.

870
00:48:22,086 --> 00:48:24,076
As a result, there is a danger,

871
00:48:24,077 --> 00:48:26,069
according to Professor Carl Wunsch

872
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,062
that modellers will we less concerned

873
00:48:28,063 --> 00:48:30,052
in producing a forecast that is accurate

874
00:48:30,053 --> 00:48:32,045
than one that is interesting.

875
00:48:32,544 --> 00:48:34,535
Even within the scientific community,

876
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,528
you see, it's a problem.

877
00:48:36,529 --> 00:48:40,513
If I run a complicated model
and I do something to it

878
00:48:40,514 --> 00:48:43,500
like melt a lot of ice into the ocean

879
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:46,488
and nothing happens,

880
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:48,481
it's not likely to get printed.

881
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:51,470
But if I run the same model
and I adjust it

882
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,461
in such a way that something dramatic

883
00:48:53,462 --> 00:48:55,452
happens to the ocean circulation

884
00:48:55,453 --> 00:48:58,441
like the heat transport turns off

885
00:48:58,442 --> 00:49:00,933
it will be published, people will say:

886
00:49:00,934 --> 00:49:02,427
"This is very exciting"

887
00:49:02,428 --> 00:49:04,917
and will even be picked up by the media.

888
00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:07,407
So there's a bias,
there's a very powerful bias

889
00:49:07,408 --> 00:49:08,903
within the media and within

890
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:09,947
the science community itself

891
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:15,229
towards results which
are dramatized upon.

892
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:18,215
If all freezes over,

893
00:49:18,216 --> 00:49:20,904
that's a much more interesting story

894
00:49:20,905 --> 00:49:24,144
than saying well, you know,
it all fluctuates around

895
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:27,132
sometimes the mass
flocks goes up by 10%,

896
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:29,373
sometimes it goes down by 20%

897
00:49:29,374 --> 00:49:31,364
but eventually it comes back.

898
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:34,353
You know, which would
you do a story on?

899
00:49:34,354 --> 00:49:36,345
I mean, that's what is about.

900
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:41,326
To the untrained eye computer
models look impressive

901
00:49:41,327 --> 00:49:44,314
and they give often wild
speculation about the climate

902
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,305
the appearance of rigoruous science.

903
00:49:47,303 --> 00:49:49,294
They also provide an endless...

904
00:49:49,295 --> 00:49:51,785
source of spectacular
stories for the media.

905
00:49:51,786 --> 00:49:55,771
The thing that has amazed me
as lifelong journalist

906
00:49:55,772 --> 00:49:59,754
is how the most elementary
principles of journalism

907
00:49:59,755 --> 00:50:02,742
seem to have been
abandoned on this subject.

908
00:50:03,186 --> 00:50:05,731
In fact, the theory of
man-made global warming

909
00:50:05,732 --> 00:50:08,718
has spawned an entirely
new brand of journalism.

910
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:12,702
We've got a whole new generation of reporters,

911
00:50:12,703 --> 00:50:14,695
environmental journalists;

912
00:50:14,696 --> 00:50:18,681
now, if you are an
environmental journalist

913
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:23,106
and if the global warming
story goes in the trash can,

914
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:25,349
so does your job.

915
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:28,088
It really is that crude,

916
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:32,072
and their reporting has to
get more and more hysterical

917
00:50:32,073 --> 00:50:34,761
because there are still,
fortunately,

918
00:50:34,762 --> 00:50:39,045
a few hardened news
editors around who will say:

919
00:50:39,046 --> 00:50:41,785
"This is what you were
saying five years ago".

920
00:50:41,786 --> 00:50:44,525
"Oh, but now is much
much worse, you know,

921
00:50:44,526 --> 00:50:46,516
they are going to be
ten feet of sea level rise

922
00:50:46,517 --> 00:50:48,508
by next tuesday or something..."

923
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:51,996
They have to keep on getting shriller...

924
00:50:51,997 --> 00:50:53,989
and shriller and shriller.

925
00:50:55,482 --> 00:50:56,977
It is now common in the media

926
00:50:56,978 --> 00:50:58,720
to lay the blame for every storm

927
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:00,713
or hurricane on global warming,

928
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:03,449
but is there any scientific basis for this?

929
00:51:03,947 --> 00:51:06,934
This is purely propaganda.

930
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:10,919
Every textbook in
Meteorology is telling you

931
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,903
the main source of
weather disturbances

932
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:16,896
is the temperature difference

933
00:51:16,897 --> 00:51:19,387
between the tropics and the pole,

934
00:51:19,388 --> 00:51:21,875
and we are told in a warmer world

935
00:51:21,876 --> 00:51:23,868
this difference will get less.

936
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:25,860
Now that would tell you

937
00:51:25,861 --> 00:51:27,853
you'll have less storminess

938
00:51:27,854 --> 00:51:29,844
you'll have less variability

939
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:33,332
but for some reason that
isn't considered catastrophic

940
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:35,324
so you tell the opposite.

941
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:37,316
News reports frequently argue

942
00:51:37,317 --> 00:51:40,304
that even a mild increase
in global temperature

943
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:44,289
could lead to a catastrophic
melting of the polar ice caps,

944
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:47,277
but what does Earth's
climate history tell us?

945
00:51:47,278 --> 00:51:49,269
We happen to have temperature

946
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,264
records of Greenland...

947
00:51:50,265 --> 00:51:53,005
that go back thousands of years.

948
00:51:53,006 --> 00:51:54,998
Greenland has been much warmer.

949
00:51:54,999 --> 00:51:56,990
Just a thousand years ago

950
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:58,982
Greenland was warmer than it is today.

951
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:02,966
Yet it didn't have a
dramatic melting event.

952
00:52:02,967 --> 00:52:05,955
Even if we talk about
something like permafrost,

953
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,946
a great deal of the permafrost

954
00:52:07,947 --> 00:52:10,935
(that icy layer under the
forests of Russia for example)

955
00:52:10,936 --> 00:52:12,926
seven or eight
thousand years ago

956
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,919
melted far more than we're having

957
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,911
any evidence about it melting now.

958
00:52:16,912 --> 00:52:17,908
So in other words...

959
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:19,899
this is a historical pattern again

960
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,893
but the world didn't come
to a country humpy, does it?

961
00:52:24,631 --> 00:52:26,621
Professor Syun-Ichi Akasofu

962
00:52:26,622 --> 00:52:29,611
is head of the International
Arctic Research Center...

963
00:52:29,612 --> 00:52:30,606
in Alaska.

964
00:52:31,105 --> 00:52:34,841
The IARC is the world's leading
Arctic research institute.

965
00:52:35,588 --> 00:52:38,076
Professor Akasofu
insists that over time

966
00:52:38,077 --> 00:52:40,069
the ice caps are always

967
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,061
naturally expanding and contracting.

968
00:52:43,058 --> 00:52:45,548
There are reports
from time to time

969
00:52:45,549 --> 00:52:47,539
of big chunks of ice break

970
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,527
away from Antarctic continent.

971
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:56,008
Those mass have been
happening all the time

972
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:59,992
but because now we have a satellite

973
00:52:59,993 --> 00:53:01,986
they can detect those.

974
00:53:01,987 --> 00:53:04,973
That's why they become news.

975
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:08,707
These data, from NASA's
meteorological satellites,

976
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,949
shows the huge
natural expansion...

977
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:12,943
and contraction
of the Polar sea ice...

978
00:53:12,944 --> 00:53:14,934
taken place in the 1990's.

979
00:53:14,935 --> 00:53:17,921
I'd say all the TV programs

980
00:53:17,922 --> 00:53:19,914
that debate to global warming

981
00:53:19,915 --> 00:53:22,903
so big chunks of ice falling

982
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:24,895
from the edge of the glaciers

983
00:53:24,896 --> 00:53:28,182
well people forget that
ice is always moving.

984
00:53:30,371 --> 00:53:32,361
News reports frequently
show images

985
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:34,355
of ice breaking from
the edge of the Arctic

986
00:53:34,356 --> 00:53:36,347
what they don't say is that...

987
00:53:36,348 --> 00:53:38,339
this is as ordinary event in the Arctic

988
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,326
as falling leaves on
an English autumn day.

989
00:53:41,627 --> 00:53:45,312
They ask me, they just see ice falling

990
00:53:45,313 --> 00:53:47,303
from the edge of the greatest:

991
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:52,284
yes, that's spring breakup
that happens every year.

992
00:53:52,285 --> 00:53:55,271
Press come to us towards
the time, you know:

993
00:53:55,272 --> 00:53:57,264
"you want to say something...

994
00:53:57,265 --> 00:54:00,253
...about the greenhouse disaster?",

995
00:54:00,254 --> 00:54:02,245
and I say: "there is none".

996
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,731
Alarming television programs

997
00:54:05,732 --> 00:54:07,227
raised the fear for prospect

998
00:54:07,228 --> 00:54:09,718
a vast tidal waves flooding Britain.

999
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:11,710
But what causes the sea
level to change...

1000
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,702
...and how fast does it happen?

1001
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:16,888
Sea level changes over
the world in general

1002
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:19,876
are governed fundamentally
by two factors:

1003
00:54:19,877 --> 00:54:21,869
what we would call
"local factors",

1004
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,562
the relationship of
the sea to the land

1005
00:54:23,563 --> 00:54:24,559
which often by the way is

1006
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,053
to do with the land rising or falling

1007
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,046
and anything to do with the sea,

1008
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:29,043
but if you're talking about

1009
00:54:29,044 --> 00:54:32,030
what we call eustatic changes of sea,

1010
00:54:32,031 --> 00:54:34,022
worldwide changes of sea,

1011
00:54:34,023 --> 00:54:38,006
that's through the thermal
expansion of the oceans,

1012
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:39,503
nothing to do with melting ice.

1013
00:54:39,504 --> 00:54:41,494
And that's an enormously slow,

1014
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:42,490
a long process.

1015
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,971
People say: "Oh, I see the ocean...

1016
00:54:46,972 --> 00:54:48,963
doing this last year...

1017
00:54:48,964 --> 00:54:51,952
that means that something changed

1018
00:54:51,953 --> 00:54:53,945
in the atmosphere last year",

1019
00:54:53,946 --> 00:54:55,935
and this is not
necessarily true at all,

1020
00:54:55,936 --> 00:54:57,928
in fact this is actually
quite unlikely

1021
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:00,916
because it can take hundreds
to thousand of years

1022
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:04,901
for the deep ocean to
respond to forces

1023
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:05,897
and changes

1024
00:55:05,898 --> 00:55:07,889
hat are taking place
at the surface.

1025
00:55:08,886 --> 00:55:10,877
It is also suggested that

1026
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:12,870
even a mild rise in temperature

1027
00:55:12,871 --> 00:55:15,112
will lead to the spread northward

1028
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:18,599
of deadly insect-born tropical
diseases like malaria.

1029
00:55:18,945 --> 00:55:20,935
But is this true?

1030
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:22,927
Professor Paul Reiter

1031
00:55:22,928 --> 00:55:24,920
of the Pasteur Institute in Paris

1032
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,913
is recognized as one of the world's

1033
00:55:26,914 --> 00:55:28,605
leading experts on malaria

1034
00:55:28,606 --> 00:55:30,598
and other insect-born diseases.

1035
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,589
He is a member of the
World Health Organization,

1036
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,582
expert advisory committee...

1037
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:35,578
was chairman of the...

1038
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:37,571
American Committee
of Medical Entomology...

1039
00:55:37,572 --> 00:55:39,562
of the American Society
for Tropical Medicine...

1040
00:55:39,563 --> 00:55:41,555
and lead author on
the health section...

1041
00:55:41,556 --> 00:55:43,547
of the US National
Assessment...

1042
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:47,034
of the potential consequences
of climate variability.

1043
00:55:49,027 --> 00:55:51,018
As Professor Reiter
is eager to point out,

1044
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:55,003
mosquitoes thrive in
very cold temperatures.

1045
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,987
Mosquitoes are not
specifically tropical.

1046
00:55:58,988 --> 00:55:59,984
Most people would
realize that...

1047
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:02,474
in temper regions there
are mosquitoes;

1048
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:04,466
in fact, mosquitoes are

1049
00:56:04,467 --> 00:56:06,458
extremely abundant
in the Arctic.

1050
00:56:07,457 --> 00:56:10,443
The most devastating
epidemic of malaria...

1051
00:56:10,444 --> 00:56:13,431
was in the Soviet
Union in the 1920's:

1052
00:56:13,432 --> 00:56:16,419
there was something like
13 million cases a year

1053
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,408
and something like
600,000 deaths,

1054
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,401
a tremendous
catastrophy...

1055
00:56:21,402 --> 00:56:23,391
that raised up to
the Arctic Circle...

1056
00:56:23,392 --> 00:56:26,379
Archangel had
13 thousand cases...

1057
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,372
and about 10 thousand deaths.

1058
00:56:28,373 --> 00:56:30,365
So it's not a
tropical disease.

1059
00:56:30,366 --> 00:56:34,348
Yet these people in the
global warming fraternity

1060
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,341
invent the idea that...

1061
00:56:36,342 --> 00:56:38,332
malaria will move northward.

1062
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:41,321
Climate scare stories cannot be blamed

1063
00:56:41,322 --> 00:56:43,314
solely on sloppy or
biased journalism.

1064
00:56:43,315 --> 00:56:45,306
According to Professor Reiter,

1065
00:56:45,307 --> 00:56:47,297
hysterical alarms have
been encouraged...

1066
00:56:47,298 --> 00:56:53,275
by the reports of the UN's IPCC.

1067
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:54,271
On spread of malaria,

1068
00:56:54,272 --> 00:56:56,263
the IPCC warns us that:

1069
00:56:56,264 --> 00:56:58,953
"Mosquito species that
transmit malaria...

1070
00:56:58,954 --> 00:56:59,949
do not usually survive...

1071
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,445
where the mean
winter temperature...

1072
00:57:01,446 --> 00:57:04,434
drops below 16-18ºC".

1073
00:57:05,229 --> 00:57:06,822
According to Professor Reiter

1074
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,814
this is clearly untrue.

1075
00:57:08,815 --> 00:57:10,806
I was horrified to read the second

1076
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:12,798
and the third assessment reports

1077
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,787
because there was
so much misinformation,

1078
00:57:15,788 --> 00:57:18,775
without any kind of records

1079
00:57:18,776 --> 00:57:22,759
or virtually without mention
of the scientific literature,

1080
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,751
the trully scientific literature,

1081
00:57:24,752 --> 00:57:27,739
literature by specialists
in those fields.

1082
00:57:27,936 --> 00:57:29,928
In a letter to the
Wall Street Journal,

1083
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:31,422
Professor Frederick Seitz,

1084
00:57:31,423 --> 00:57:34,411
America's National
Academy of Sciences,

1085
00:57:34,412 --> 00:57:36,404
revealed that IPCC officials

1086
00:57:36,405 --> 00:57:39,391
had censored the
comments of scientists.

1087
00:57:39,392 --> 00:57:40,388
He said that:

1088
00:57:40,389 --> 00:57:42,379
"This report is not
the version...

1089
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,368
that was approved by
the contributing scientists"

1090
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:48,357
At least 15 key sections
of the science chapter

1091
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:49,352
...had been deleted.

1092
00:57:49,353 --> 00:57:51,344
These included statements like:

1093
00:57:51,345 --> 00:57:54,332
"None of the studies cited
has shown clear evidence...

1094
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:56,325
...that we can attribute
climate changes...

1095
00:57:56,326 --> 00:57:58,318
...to increases in
greenhouse gases."

1096
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,306
"No study to date has
positively attributed...

1097
00:58:01,307 --> 00:58:03,297
...all or part
of the observed

1098
00:58:03,298 --> 00:58:05,289
climate changes to
man-made causes."

1099
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:07,282
Professor Seitz concluded:

1100
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:11,266
"I have never witnessed
a more disturbing corruption

1101
00:58:11,267 --> 00:58:13,259
of the peer-review process

1102
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,246
than the events that
led to this IPCC report."

1103
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,737
In its reply, the IPCC...

1104
00:58:18,738 --> 00:58:21,228
did not deny making
these deletions;

1105
00:58:21,229 --> 00:58:23,219
but it said that there
was no dishonesty...

1106
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,216
or bias in the report,

1107
00:58:24,217 --> 00:58:25,710
and that uncertainties about...

1108
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:28,698
...the cause of global warming
had been included.

1109
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:30,691
The changes have been made,

1110
00:58:30,692 --> 00:58:32,683
it said, in response
to comments...

1111
00:58:32,684 --> 00:58:34,675
...from governments,
individual scientists

1112
00:58:34,676 --> 00:58:36,667
and non-governmental
organizations.

1113
00:58:36,668 --> 00:58:39,655
When I resigned from the IPCC

1114
00:58:39,656 --> 00:58:41,648
I thought this was the end of it;

1115
00:58:41,649 --> 00:58:43,640
but when I saw the final draft,

1116
00:58:43,641 --> 00:58:45,632
my name was still there.

1117
00:58:45,633 --> 00:58:47,624
I asked for it to be removed:

1118
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:48,620
Well, they told me,

1119
00:58:48,621 --> 00:58:51,607
that I had contributed
so it'd remain there.

1120
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:53,601
So I said: "No, I haven't contributed

1121
00:58:53,602 --> 00:58:55,592
because they haven't
listened to anything I said".

1122
00:58:55,593 --> 00:58:57,585
So in the end it was
quite a battle

1123
00:58:57,586 --> 00:59:00,573
but finally I threatened
legal actions against them

1124
00:59:00,574 --> 00:59:01,569
and they removed my name,

1125
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:03,562
and I think this happens
a great deal;

1126
00:59:03,563 --> 00:59:05,553
those people who are specialists

1127
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:08,542
but don't agree
with the polemic

1128
00:59:08,543 --> 00:59:09,537
and resigned...

1129
00:59:09,538 --> 00:59:12,526
(and there have been
a number that I know of)

1130
00:59:12,527 --> 00:59:14,519
they are simply put
on the author list...

1131
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,515
and become part of these...

1132
00:59:15,516 --> 00:59:18,005
2,500 of the world's
top scientists.

1133
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:20,990
Research relating to
man-made global warming

1134
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:23,978
is now one of the best
funded areas of science.

1135
00:59:23,979 --> 00:59:25,475
The US government alone spends...

1136
00:59:25,476 --> 00:59:27,466
...for than 4 billion dollars a year.

1137
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,453
According to NASA
climatologist Roy Spencer,

1138
00:59:30,454 --> 00:59:31,450
scientists who speak out...

1139
00:59:31,451 --> 00:59:33,442
...against man-made global warming

1140
00:59:33,443 --> 00:59:35,434
have a lot to lose.

1141
00:59:35,435 --> 00:59:38,423
It's generally harder to get
research proposals funded

1142
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:41,411
because of the stands
we've taken publicly,

1143
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:42,406
and you'll find very few of us

1144
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:44,399
that are willing to take public stand

1145
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,388
because it does cut
into the research funding.

1146
00:59:47,886 --> 00:59:48,882
It is a common prejudice

1147
00:59:48,883 --> 00:59:51,373
that scientists
who do not agree...

1148
00:59:51,374 --> 00:59:53,364
with the theory of man-made
global warming...

1149
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:56,352
must have been paid by
private industry to tell lies.

1150
00:59:56,848 --> 00:59:58,345
I get it all the time:

1151
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:00,836
"You must be in the pay
of the multinationals".

1152
01:00:00,837 --> 01:00:03,824
Sadly, like most of the
scientists you'll talk to,

1153
01:00:03,825 --> 01:00:05,816
I haven't see a penny
from the multinationals.

1154
01:00:05,817 --> 01:00:07,310
I'm always accused of being paid

1155
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:08,306
by oil and gas companies.

1156
01:00:08,307 --> 01:00:09,304
I've never received a nickel

1157
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,295
from the oil and gas companies.

1158
01:00:11,296 --> 01:00:12,789
I joke about I wished
they would pay me

1159
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,484
then I could afford
their product.

1160
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,978
Whenever anybody says that...

1161
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:18,965
I'm in the pay of an oil company,

1162
01:00:18,966 --> 01:00:20,959
I say my bank manager
would wish.

1163
01:00:23,446 --> 01:00:26,935
There's almost no private sector
investment in climatology

1164
01:00:26,936 --> 01:00:29,923
and yet, to be involved
in any reseach project

1165
01:00:29,924 --> 01:00:31,418
which involves an industry grant,

1166
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:32,415
no matter how small,

1167
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:35,403
and spell ruin to a
scientist's reputation.

1168
01:00:35,404 --> 01:00:38,391
Modern technology fuelled
by greenhouse gases.

1169
01:00:39,931 --> 01:00:42,919
Patrick Michaels is Professor
of Environmental Sciences

1170
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,914
at the University of Virginia.

1171
01:00:44,413 --> 01:00:46,904
He was chair of the committee
on Applied Climatology

1172
01:00:46,905 --> 01:00:49,394
at the American Meteorological Society,

1173
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,887
president of the American Association

1174
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:51,883
of State Climatologists,

1175
01:00:51,884 --> 01:00:54,125
the author of three books on Meteorology,

1176
01:00:54,126 --> 01:00:59,104
...and an author and reviewer
on the UN's IPCC.

1177
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:02,093
But when he conducted research

1178
01:01:02,094 --> 01:01:04,584
which was part funded
by the coal industry,

1179
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:05,579
he found himself among those

1180
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,567
under attack from
climate campaigners.

1181
01:01:11,556 --> 01:01:13,547
"British based corporations...

1182
01:01:13,548 --> 01:01:17,532
are some of the worst climate
criminals on the planet...

1183
01:01:17,533 --> 01:01:21,516
Shell is based in the UK,
right here, in London

1184
01:01:21,517 --> 01:01:23,508
and we have the right and the duty

1185
01:01:23,509 --> 01:01:25,500
to take it back into public ownership,
dismantle it, break it up

1186
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:29,485
and send its managers
to rehabilitation training

1187
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:29,485
and send its managers
to rehabilitation training.

1188
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,473
But reasoned debate...

1189
01:01:32,474 --> 01:01:35,460
is not the only casualty in
the global warming alarm.

1190
01:01:35,461 --> 01:01:38,449
As international public
policy bears down

1191
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:40,442
on industrial emissions of CO2,

1192
01:01:40,443 --> 01:01:42,434
the developing world is coming

1193
01:01:42,435 --> 01:01:44,426
under intense pressure
not to develop.

1194
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,499
"I'm not expert on climate change,

1195
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,494
I'm not scientist,

1196
01:01:56,495 --> 01:01:59,483
what I'm gonna say next
is a great big turn off,

1197
01:01:59,484 --> 01:02:02,969
is just that: turn it off!

1198
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:06,455
Anything you don't need,
you're not using,

1199
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:10,938
it's easier than you think
to make a difference."

1200
01:02:14,922 --> 01:02:16,417
Delegates from
around the world...

1201
01:02:16,418 --> 01:02:17,413
are flying into Nairobi

1202
01:02:17,414 --> 01:02:20,401
for a conference
sponsored by the UN

1203
01:02:20,402 --> 01:02:22,394
to talk about global warming.

1204
01:02:24,387 --> 01:02:25,084
Civil servants,

1205
01:02:25,085 --> 01:02:27,374
professional NGO campaigners,

1206
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:28,869
carbon offset funder managers,

1207
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,959
environmental journalists and others,

1208
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,948
will discuss every aspect
of man-made climate change:

1209
01:02:34,945 --> 01:02:36,935
from how to promote
solar panels in Africa,

1210
01:02:36,936 --> 01:02:40,222
to the relationship between
global warming and sexism.

1211
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,913
The conference lasts ten days;

1212
01:02:42,914 --> 01:02:46,400
the number of delegates
exceeds 6,000.

1213
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,387
The billions of dollars
invested in climate science

1214
01:02:49,388 --> 01:02:51,379
means there's a
huge constituency

1215
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:53,371
of people dependent
upon those dollars

1216
01:02:53,372 --> 01:02:56,360
and they will want to
see that carry forward,

1217
01:02:56,361 --> 01:02:58,352
happens in any burocracy.

1218
01:02:58,353 --> 01:03:02,335
Where I live we have local council,

1219
01:03:02,336 --> 01:03:06,321
a local council global warming officer.

1220
01:03:06,322 --> 01:03:12,298
There's a huge tail out there of people

1221
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:15,285
who have in one way
or another

1222
01:03:15,286 --> 01:03:19,270
been recruited to join this
particular bandwagon.

1223
01:03:19,271 --> 01:03:21,761
Anybody who then
stands up and says:

1224
01:03:21,762 --> 01:03:24,250
"hey, wait a minute,
let's look at this coolly

1225
01:03:24,251 --> 01:03:26,242
and rationally and carefully,

1226
01:03:26,242 --> 01:03:28,234
and see actually how much merit,

1227
01:03:28,235 --> 01:03:30,227
how much this stands up,

1228
01:03:30,228 --> 01:03:32,219
they will be ostracized.

1229
01:03:33,115 --> 01:03:36,102
Scientists, accustomed to the relatively civility

1230
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:38,094
and obscurity of academic life,

1231
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:40,087
suddenly find themselves
publicly attacked...

1232
01:03:40,088 --> 01:03:42,078
if they dare to challenge
the theory of...

1233
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,071
...man-made global warming,

1234
01:03:44,072 --> 01:03:46,063
...vilified by campaign groups

1235
01:03:46,064 --> 01:03:48,055
and even within
their own universities.

1236
01:03:48,056 --> 01:03:50,048
there's an old English saying:

1237
01:03:50,049 --> 01:03:52,040
"if you stand up in the coconut-shy,

1238
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:53,035
they're gonna throw at you".

1239
01:03:53,036 --> 01:03:55,527
So I understand there's
going to be some of that,

1240
01:03:55,528 --> 01:03:57,019
but it gets pretty difficult

1241
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:00,009
and pretty nasty and very personal.

1242
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:03,992
And I've been death threats
and all sort of things

1243
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:05,985
so I'm not doing it for my health.

1244
01:04:06,981 --> 01:04:08,973
These days, if you are skeptical

1245
01:04:08,974 --> 01:04:11,962
about the Litany around
climate change,

1246
01:04:11,963 --> 01:04:15,945
you are suddlely like as if
you are a Holocaust denier.

1247
01:04:17,439 --> 01:04:18,933
The environmental movement really

1248
01:04:18,934 --> 01:04:21,922
it is a political activist movement

1249
01:04:21,923 --> 01:04:25,906
and they have become hugely
influential at a global level.

1250
01:04:29,592 --> 01:04:32,083
And every politician
is aware of that today.

1251
01:04:32,631 --> 01:04:33,626
Whether you are in the left,

1252
01:04:33,627 --> 01:04:34,672
in the middle or the right,

1253
01:04:34,673 --> 01:04:38,159
you have to pay homage
to the environment.

1254
01:04:39,354 --> 01:04:40,347
In the past month,

1255
01:04:40,348 --> 01:04:41,843
the global warming campaign

1256
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:42,839
has won a great victory:

1257
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,832
the United States government,

1258
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:46,825
once a bastion of resistance,

1259
01:04:46,826 --> 01:04:47,820
has succumbed.

1260
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:50,312
George Bush is now an allied.

1261
01:04:50,808 --> 01:04:52,303
Western governments have now

1262
01:04:52,304 --> 01:04:54,295
embraced the need for
international agreements

1263
01:04:54,296 --> 01:04:56,288
to restrain industrial production

1264
01:04:56,289 --> 01:04:58,280
in the developed and developing world.

1265
01:04:59,773 --> 01:05:01,764
But is it what cost?

1266
01:05:01,765 --> 01:05:03,756
Paul Driessen is a former
environmental campaigner.

1267
01:05:04,754 --> 01:05:07,741
My big concern with
global warming,

1268
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:10,729
is that the policies
being pushed...

1269
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:13,717
to supposedly prevent
global warming...

1270
01:05:13,718 --> 01:05:16,706
are having a disastrous effect

1271
01:05:16,707 --> 01:05:18,698
...on the world's poorest people.

1272
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:20,689
Global warming campaigners say

1273
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,682
it does not harm to be on the safe side;

1274
01:05:22,683 --> 01:05:24,674
even if the theory of man-made

1275
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:25,670
climate change is wrong,

1276
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,663
we should impose draconian measures

1277
01:05:27,664 --> 01:05:30,650
to cut carbon emissions, just in case.

1278
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:34,137
They call this the
precautionary principle.

1279
01:05:34,635 --> 01:05:37,623
The precautionary principles
are very interesting beast.

1280
01:05:37,624 --> 01:05:39,616
It's basically used to promote

1281
01:05:39,617 --> 01:05:41,607
a particular agenda in ideology,

1282
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:44,595
it's always used in one direction only.

1283
01:05:44,596 --> 01:05:48,580
It talks about the risks of
using a particular technology

1284
01:05:48,581 --> 01:05:50,573
fossil fuels for example,

1285
01:05:50,574 --> 01:05:53,561
but never about the
risks of not using it.

1286
01:05:53,562 --> 01:05:55,552
It never talks about the benefits

1287
01:05:55,553 --> 01:05:57,544
of having that technology.

1288
01:05:59,537 --> 01:06:01,032
Anne Mougela is about to cook...

1289
01:06:01,033 --> 01:06:03,025
...a meal for her children.

1290
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:05,016
She is one of the 2 billion people,

1291
01:06:05,017 --> 01:06:07,008
a third of the world's population,

1292
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:09,000
who have no access to electricity.

1293
01:06:09,001 --> 01:06:10,992
Instead, they must burn wood

1294
01:06:10,993 --> 01:06:12,985
or dried animal dung in their homes.

1295
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:15,973
The indoor smoke this creates

1296
01:06:15,974 --> 01:06:18,961
is the deadliest form of
pollution in the world.

1297
01:06:18,962 --> 01:06:20,953
According to the World
Health Organization,

1298
01:06:20,954 --> 01:06:23,445
four million children
under the age of five...

1299
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,934
die each year from
respiratory diseases...

1300
01:06:25,935 --> 01:06:27,926
caused by indoor smoke,

1301
01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:29,918
and many millions of
women die early...

1302
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:32,408
from cancer and lung disease
for the same reason.

1303
01:06:33,404 --> 01:06:36,890
If you ask a rural person
to define development,

1304
01:06:36,891 --> 01:06:38,384
they'll tell you:

1305
01:06:38,385 --> 01:06:40,875
"yes I'll know I move
to the next level

1306
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:42,370
when I have electricity".

1307
01:06:42,868 --> 01:06:44,363
Actually not having electricity

1308
01:06:44,364 --> 01:06:46,851
creates such a long
chain of problems...

1309
01:06:46,852 --> 01:06:49,591
cause the first thing
you miss is the light.

1310
01:06:49,592 --> 01:06:52,331
So you have to go to sleep earlier

1311
01:06:52,332 --> 01:06:54,322
because there's no light,

1312
01:06:54,323 --> 01:06:56,316
there's no reason to
stay awake, I mean,

1313
01:06:56,317 --> 01:06:59,303
you can't talk to each
other in darkness.

1314
01:06:59,304 --> 01:07:01,295
No refrigeration or
modern packaging...

1315
01:07:01,296 --> 01:07:03,287
means food cannot
be kept.

1316
01:07:03,288 --> 01:07:05,279
Fire in the hut is too smoky

1317
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,269
and consumes too much
wood to be used as heating.

1318
01:07:08,766 --> 01:07:10,757
There is no hot water.

1319
01:07:10,758 --> 01:07:12,749
We in the West cannot
begin to imagine

1320
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:15,241
how hard life is
without electricity.

1321
01:07:16,237 --> 01:07:17,483
The life expectancy of people...

1322
01:07:17,484 --> 01:07:20,219
who live like this in
terrifyingly short.

1323
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:23,206
Their existance impoverished
in every way.

1324
01:07:26,196 --> 01:07:27,191
A few miles away the UN

1325
01:07:27,192 --> 01:07:29,684
is hosting its conference
on global warming

1326
01:07:29,685 --> 01:07:31,675
in its plush gated headquarters.

1327
01:07:33,668 --> 01:07:36,157
Gift shop is selling souvenirs
of peasant travel life

1328
01:07:36,158 --> 01:07:37,651
while delegates discuss...

1329
01:07:37,652 --> 01:07:39,646
how to promote what
are described as:

1330
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:42,134
"sustainable forms of
electrical generation".

1331
01:07:44,128 --> 01:07:48,110
Africa has coal,
and Africa has oil,

1332
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:50,104
but environmental groups
are campaigning...

1333
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:52,096
against the use of these
sources of energy.

1334
01:07:54,089 --> 01:07:56,080
Instead, they say Africa...

1335
01:07:56,081 --> 01:07:58,072
and the rest of the
developing world...

1336
01:07:58,073 --> 01:08:00,063
...should use solar
and wind power.

1337
01:08:04,049 --> 01:08:06,041
A short drive out of Nairobi

1338
01:08:06,042 --> 01:08:08,033
we find our first solar panel.

1339
01:08:09,527 --> 01:08:11,519
A Kenian public health official

1340
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,013
has brought us to a clinic

1341
01:08:13,014 --> 01:08:15,005
which serves several villages.

1342
01:08:16,002 --> 01:08:17,497
The only electrical
implements...

1343
01:08:17,498 --> 01:08:19,986
in the clinic are
the electric lights...

1344
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:21,978
and a refrigerator in which
to keep vaccines,

1345
01:08:21,979 --> 01:08:24,469
medicine and blood samples.

1346
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,955
Electricity is provided
by two solar panels.

1347
01:08:28,951 --> 01:08:33,932
- So what can you to do successfully?
- Lighting.

1348
01:08:33,933 --> 01:08:37,915
What happens when you put
lighting plus the refrigerator?

1349
01:08:37,916 --> 01:08:39,907
Tell us, what happens?

1350
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:43,392
- It sounds an alarm?
- Yes.

1351
01:08:43,393 --> 01:08:46,382
- Can we maybe see that?

1352
01:08:53,354 --> 01:08:56,342
The solar panels allow Dr. Samuel Morangui

1353
01:08:56,343 --> 01:08:59,330
to use either the lights
or the refrigerator,

1354
01:08:59,331 --> 01:09:01,322
but not both at
the same time.

1355
01:09:01,323 --> 01:09:04,310
If he does, the
electricity shuts down.

1356
01:09:05,805 --> 01:09:08,793
Wind and solar power
are notoriously unreliable

1357
01:09:08,794 --> 01:09:09,789
as a source of electricity,

1358
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:12,777
and are at least three
times more expensive

1359
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:15,764
than conventional forms
of electrical generation.

1360
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:19,749
The question would be
how many people in Europe,

1361
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,742
how many people in the United States

1362
01:09:21,743 --> 01:09:24,233
are already using
that kind of energy,

1363
01:09:24,234 --> 01:09:26,721
and how cheap is it, you see,

1364
01:09:26,722 --> 01:09:29,212
if it's expensive for the Europeans,

1365
01:09:29,213 --> 01:09:31,203
if it's expensive for the Americans,

1366
01:09:31,204 --> 01:09:33,695
and we are talking
about poor Africans,

1367
01:09:33,696 --> 01:09:36,186
you know, it doesn't make sense.

1368
01:09:36,187 --> 01:09:38,178
The rich countries
can afford...

1369
01:09:38,179 --> 01:09:39,673
to engage in some
luxurious

1370
01:09:39,674 --> 01:09:42,661
experimentation with
other forms of energy,

1371
01:09:42,662 --> 01:09:44,903
but for us we are still
at the state of survival.

1372
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,631
To former environmentalist
Paul Driessen,

1373
01:09:49,632 --> 01:09:52,619
the idea that the world's
poorest people

1374
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,611
should be restricted
to using the world's

1375
01:09:54,612 --> 01:09:58,596
most expensive and inefficient
forms of electrical generation,

1376
01:09:58,597 --> 01:10:01,087
is the most morally
repugnant aspect...

1377
01:10:01,088 --> 01:10:03,079
of the global warming campaign.

1378
01:10:04,574 --> 01:10:07,560
Let me make one
thing perfectly clear:

1379
01:10:07,561 --> 01:10:09,552
if we are telling the Third World

1380
01:10:09,553 --> 01:10:12,541
that they can only have
wind and solar power,

1381
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:15,032
what we are really telling them is:

1382
01:10:15,033 --> 01:10:17,522
"You cannot have electricity".

1383
01:10:19,017 --> 01:10:20,511
The challenge we have,

1384
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:23,499
when we meet western
environmentalists

1385
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,492
who say we must engage

1386
01:10:25,493 --> 01:10:29,475
in the use of solar panels
and wind energy

1387
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:32,463
is how we can have
Africa industrialized,

1388
01:10:33,461 --> 01:10:36,449
because I don't see how a solar panel

1389
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:39,437
is going to power a steel industry,

1390
01:10:39,438 --> 01:10:41,428
how a solar panel, you know,

1391
01:10:41,429 --> 01:10:46,410
is going to power maybe
some railway train network.

1392
01:10:47,406 --> 01:10:51,390
It might work maybe to
power a transistor radio.

1393
01:10:53,384 --> 01:10:55,373
I think one of the most pernicious aspects

1394
01:10:55,374 --> 01:10:57,366
of the modern environmental movement

1395
01:10:57,367 --> 01:11:00,355
is the romantization of peasant life,

1396
01:11:01,351 --> 01:11:04,339
and the idea that industrial societies

1397
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,326
are the destroyers of the world.

1398
01:11:08,821 --> 01:11:10,813
One clear thing that emerges

1399
01:11:10,814 --> 01:11:13,303
from the old environmental debate

1400
01:11:13,304 --> 01:11:16,291
is the point that there's somebody

1401
01:11:16,292 --> 01:11:19,279
keen to kill the African dream,

1402
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,272
and the African dream is to develop.

1403
01:11:21,521 --> 01:11:22,766
The environmental movement

1404
01:11:22,767 --> 01:11:26,053
has evolved into the
strongest force there is

1405
01:11:26,054 --> 01:11:30,536
for preventing development
in the developing countries.

1406
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:32,529
We have been told
don't touch your resources,

1407
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:33,525
don't touch your oil,

1408
01:11:33,526 --> 01:11:35,517
don't touch your coal,

1409
01:11:35,518 --> 01:11:37,012
that is suicide.

1410
01:11:37,013 --> 01:11:40,499
I think it's legitimate for me
to call them anti-human,

1411
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,490
like OK, you don't have to think

1412
01:11:42,491 --> 01:11:46,474
humans are better than whales,

1413
01:11:46,475 --> 01:11:48,465
or better than owls,

1414
01:11:48,466 --> 01:11:50,957
or whatever if you don't
want to, right?

1415
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:54,941
But surely it is not a good idea

1416
01:11:54,941 --> 01:11:57,430
to think of humans as sort of being scum,

1417
01:11:57,431 --> 01:12:00,418
you know, that is OK to have
hundreds of millions them

1418
01:12:00,419 --> 01:12:02,412
going blind or dead or whatever,

1419
01:12:02,413 --> 01:12:04,404
I just can't relate to that.

1420
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:07,392
The theory of man-made
global warming

1421
01:12:07,393 --> 01:12:09,383
is now so firmly entrenched,

1422
01:12:09,384 --> 01:12:12,371
the voices of opposition
so effectively silenced,

1423
01:12:12,372 --> 01:12:14,364
it seems invincible,

1424
01:12:14,365 --> 01:12:16,856
untroubled by any
contrary evidence,

1425
01:12:16,857 --> 01:12:18,848
no matter how strong.

1426
01:12:18,849 --> 01:12:23,330
The global warming alarm
is now beyond reason.

1427
01:12:24,327 --> 01:12:25,820
There will be still people

1428
01:12:25,821 --> 01:12:28,808
who believe that this is
the end of the world

1429
01:12:28,809 --> 01:12:31,796
particularly when you
have, for example,

1430
01:12:31,797 --> 01:12:34,784
the chief scientist
of the UK,

1431
01:12:34,785 --> 01:12:37,276
telling people that by
the end of the century

1432
01:12:37,277 --> 01:12:39,765
the only habitable
place on the earth

1433
01:12:39,766 --> 01:12:41,758
will be the Antarctic.

1434
01:12:41,759 --> 01:12:44,746
And it may, humanity
may survive

1435
01:12:44,747 --> 01:12:46,737
thanks to some
breeding couples

1436
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:48,730
who moved to
the Antarctic.

1437
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:51,718
I mean this is hilarious.

1438
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:56,699
It would be hilarious
actually if it weren't so sad.
