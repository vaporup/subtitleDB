1
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,481
- This is great, man.
- Look at you.

2
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,816
- This one's a riot.
- That's so cute.

3
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,900
- Guys, look at this.
- That's a keeper.

4
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,565
- That's a keeper, Pat.
- Paddy, you are one ugly kid.

5
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,360
- Hideous.
- A monster.

6
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,908
- Prick.
- Asshole.

7
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,491
Gentlemen, such language
in front of my girl?

8
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,877
- She's not your girl.
- Pat is right.

9
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,790
- Thank you, Pat.
- Hey! Well,

10
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,010
look at what we have here.
The Flatbush Four.

11
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,587
Or whatever stupid name
you call yourselves.

12
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,432
Hey, where'd you jerks get the quarters
for these pictures, huh?

13
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,688
You stealing from my old man's
till again, Sammy?

14
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,190
Come on, Danny,
Sam didn't steal a thing.

15
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,023
- How would you know?
- Because I did.

16
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,110
How many weeks has it been
since you've been paid, Sam?

17
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,819
Five?

18
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,193
Six.

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,488
So until he gets paid,

20
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,658
we're gonna take everything
you owe.

21
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,080
Nobody cheats us.

22
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,665
Billy, you moron,
he'll kick your ass.

23
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,455
That's right, moron. Unh!

24
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,711
No one calls us names
except for us.

25
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,598
This fight is gonna make us legends.

26
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,058
Run!

27
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,988
Kick, kick, kick.

28
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,994
Kick, kick, kick.

29
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,576
- I... Kick, kick.
- Kick, kick.

30
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,491
Side, side.

31
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,002
- Come on. Come on.
- And step, step.

32
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,662
- What?
- All right, just do it.

33
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,048
- It's good for your knee.
- It's good for my knees,

34
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,049
but it's destroying my soul.

35
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,334
Sam, shush.

36
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,753
She can't hear me.

37
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,048
None of them can hear me.
Looking good, Gloria.

38
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,842
Oh, sorry, did I just step on your foot,
or was that your breast?

39
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,883
- Row and row and row.
- See?

40
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,147
Now, ladies, show us what you got.

41
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,854
Show us what you got.
Come on, gents, you can do it too.

42
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,644
- Ira?
- What, Sam?

43
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,563
No, I was just... Just checking.

44
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:56,407
Now grind it, grind it, grind it.

45
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,251
You are my sunshine

46
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,790
<i>My only sunshine</i>

47
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,756
<i>You make me happy</i>

48
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,546
<i>When skies are gray</i>

49
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,933
<i>You'll never know, dear</i>

50
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,478
<i>How much I love you</i>

51
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,560
Pop, what are you doing? You're not
supposed to be lifting anything heavy.

52
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:28,273
Man, she got a bit of an ass on her,
but I don't think that qualifies as heavy.

53
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,403
- Okay.
- Let me take care of her today.

54
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:34,942
Your only job is to relax. We don't want
another episode, do we?

55
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,773
All right, I organized your medication,

56
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,490
I programmed the alarms
on your phone,

57
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,121
and I put the schedule on the fridge.

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,406
 Okay?
 Okay

59
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,200
Good. All right.

60
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,583
- Say bye to Grandpa.
- Uh,

61
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,292
- call me if you need anything at all.
- Sure thing.

62
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,879
- All right. I put a hoodie in there.
- Bye, Blakey!

63
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,384
See you this evening, sweetie.

64
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,089
- The sippy cup?
- I hate that.

65
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,402
Remember Grandpa loves you!

66
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,903
<i>Hi, it's Vince with Sham Wow.</i>

67
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,190
<i>You'll be saying "Wow!"
every time you use this towel.</i>

68
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,075
<i>It's like a shammy, it's like
a towel, it's like a sponge.</i>

69
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,434
<i>A regular towel doesn't work wet.
This works wet or dry.</i>

70
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,324
<i>This is for the house,
the car, the boat, the RV.</i>

71
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,663
<i>Sham Wow holds 12 times
its weight in liquid.</i>

72
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,083
What?

73
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,214
Go away, I got a bat.

74
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,922
It's Elizabeth, your neighbor.
I brought you soup.

75
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,007
That's why I have the bat.

76
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,639
Hey, Mr. C. It's potato leek.

77
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,470
Yeah, I know. Something funny
happened with the leeks.

78
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,560
- Can we just pretend again?
- I can't wait to taste your soup.

79
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,769
- Heh.
- Thank you.

80
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,732
You're welcome. Wait, there's a
free concert tonight in Prospect Park,

81
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,445
and I was gonna take
my grandmother,

82
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,447
and I thought you two might,
I don't know, get along okay.

83
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,404
- Elizabeth. Elizabeth.
- She's really funny.

84
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,319
Listen please.
You're a pretty young lady.

85
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,953
I bet the boys are attracted to you

86
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,955
as long as you don't give them
anything to eat.

87
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,367
But I have a word of advice,find a man,

88
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,535
don't let him get
anywhere near your kitchen,

89
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,454
get him married to you
or your grandmother,

90
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,247
and please just give me some peace.

91
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:15,258
It's been almost a year
since Sophie died.

92
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,635
Find a man.

93
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,381
And stop bringing me soup.

94
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,776
Are you kidding? That's great news.

95
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,818
And we're expanding our offices
right with you.

96
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,862
We're gonna be turning
a lot of heads. I love it.

97
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:46,123
Maybe we should go public.
I'm not crazy.

98
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,579
I got you, Carl, you're a genius.

99
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,372
- Honey, we're going to be late.
- I know, I'm almost ready.

100
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,084
But you don't even have
your clothes on.

101
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,175
Oh, because I thought
I would just wear this.

102
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,343
- Love you.
- Love you too.

103
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,257
No, not you, Carl.

104
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,722
The news is great,
and before you change your mind,

105
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,011
I'm gonna hang up right now.

106
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,084
Ronnie, when you were feeling low,

107
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,833
you remember what I said?

108
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,840
Shit.

109
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,885
Ronnie,

110
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,550
when you were feeling low...

111
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,353
you remember what I said to you.

112
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,727
"Ronnie, I know
you're down in the dumps,

113
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,612
but as a fellow bachelor,
I know you're gonna bounce back,

114
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,570
because you may not be smart

115
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,281
and, uh, you may not be
good-looking,

116
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:10,165
but you got one thing
that every woman loves.

117
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,418
You have
an enormous beach house."

118
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,543
And that's why, when they called me
and told me that my, uh, friend,

119
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,964
my mentor had passed away
peacefully in his bed,

120
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,475
I said, "That's exactly
how he would have wanted it."

121
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,763
Except maybe with a young redhead
lying on top of him.

122
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,615
You know why Ronnie
died in his bed?

123
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:55,039
Because for two years
he never got out of that damn bed.

124
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,169
I got a beautiful,
young girlfriend here,

125
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,672
who guys half my age
are drooling over.

126
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,797
I'd marry her
before I'd give up like Ronnie.

127
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,300
Uh...

128
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,767
I said it, babe.

129
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,303
So, what do you think?

130
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,897
You want to get hitched?

131
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,479
Heh. Yes.

132
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,367
Sorry.

133
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,572
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,412
So sorry.

135
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,283
Ronnie, I'll see you in 30 years, pal.

136
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,503
We bought this toy ring at CVS
on our way home yesterday.

137
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,946
Yeah, this is just a temporary one.

138
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,965
- So sweet.
- Until we get the real thing.

139
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,468
- Yeah.
- By which he means the biggest one.

140
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,256
Hello, Billy.

141
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,303
Hey, Neil.

142
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,686
Your daughter got this engagement
party together pretty fast, huh?

143
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,314
Yeah, she probably didn't want
to waste a lot of time, considering.

144
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,144
Yeah. Yeah.

145
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,532
Uh, excuse me one minute, please.

146
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,115
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where...?
Where'd you get that bottle'?

147
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,243
Ran out of Scotch, found this
in the back of that cabinet.

148
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,249
No, no, no. You...
You don't want to open that.

149
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,250
No, no.

150
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,263
Hello?

151
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,595
Hey, is this the bionic man?

152
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,386
Hey, Billy, how you doing?
What's going on?

153
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,397
- What are you whispering about?
- Oh, uh, Miriam dragged me

154
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,604
to a hideous dinner party.

155
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,940
I'm, uh, just going through someone
named Abraham Rosenbaum's

156
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,821
medicine cabinet.

157
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,278
He's got some very deadly shit here.

158
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,193
- Hang on, let me patch in Archie.
- Okay.

159
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,288
<i> All these guys?
 Are you insane?</i>

160
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,744
<i> At least I have a husband.
 Oh, whatev-</i>

161
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,750
- Clayton residence.
- How you feeling, Arch?

162
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,665
Billy, hey, hey! How you doing?

163
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,711
I'm just sitting here watching
this Housewives thing.

164
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,287
Horrible people, horrible.

165
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,304
- Hey, Arch.
- Hey, Sam.

166
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,091
- How's the titanium hip, man?
- No, the hip was last year.

167
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,805
Uh, it's my knee. It's great, yeah.

168
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,720
I'm thinking about
having my balls done next.

169
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,604
All right, listen, guys. I got something
important here, all right?

170
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,315
- Oh, shit, Billy.
- Heart or cancer?

171
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,524
Prostate? What?

172
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,281
Why every time the phone rings,
you think somebody's dying?

173
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,488
I live in Florida now.
Usually, when the phone rings,

174
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,119
- somebody is dying.
- No, I'm getting married.

175
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,951
- What?
- Wow.

176
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,706
<i>To that lady who's half your age?</i>

177
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,540
- She's almost 32.
- I have a hemorrhoid that's almost 32.

178
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,000
Now, look, Archie,
by the time she's my age,

179
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,506
okay, I'll be...

180
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,167
- Dead. You'll be dead, Billy.
- Billy, Billy, Billy.

181
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,178
You've got your whole
what's left of your life ahead of you.

182
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,930
I mean, you know. Look at Archie.

183
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,340
<i>He's divorced and miserable.</i>

184
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,008
I've been married almost 40 years,

185
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,927
and I wish I was as miserable
as Archie.

186
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,683
Can you guys maybe give me
a little support as my dearest friends?

187
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,814
- How about it?
- Sorry, you're right, sorry.

188
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,192
Yes, good... It's good news.

189
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,701
<i>We're happy
you're getting married.</i>

190
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,776
Right. So...?
So how'd you pop the question?

191
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,119
You remember my friend Ronnie,

192
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,025
the guy I worked with,
uh, who trained me?

193
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,819
- Yeah, yeah, love that guy.
- Good guy.

194
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,282
Yeah, well, he died. I...

195
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,288
I proposed at the funeral.

196
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,545
- I got nothing. Arch?
- Nada.

197
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,797
So, Lisa, she doesn't
want a big wedding or anything,

198
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,550
so we're gonna get, uh, married
in Vegas this weekend.

199
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,802
So we're gonna have
a bachelor party in Vegas.

200
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,214
- No, no, come on, forget it.
- No, no, no, yes, we are.

201
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,757
- We are.
<i>- It's your first wedding.</i>

202
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,723
You threw all of our bachelor parties
for us.

203
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,473
- Two for me.
- Yeah, but we got no time.

204
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,763
- We're getting married on Sunday.
- Aw, Billy.

205
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,609
So we... No, it's fine.
We fly in on Friday,

206
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,937
Saturday we give... We give you
the best bachelor party

207
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,522
in the history of mankind,

208
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,983
and then on Sunday
your child-bride flies in and, uh...

209
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,443
- Voila.
- Are you serious?

210
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,653
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

211
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,615
Billy, it is 4:15 in the afternoon,

212
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,154
and I'm at a dinner party.

213
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,822
<i>If I don't get out of here soon,</i>

214
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:05,119
I'm gonna swallow all of
Abe Rosenbaum's pills at once.

215
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,414
- What about you, Arch?
- My son won't let me go.

216
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,799
I can't smoke, drink, eat salt,
or stay out past 9:00, but...

217
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,711
- Archie's in.
- All right, all right! No, I love this.

218
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,471
- This is great, man. Huh?
- We're invincible, baby.

219
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,555
- Flatbush Four, we ride again.
- Uh, the Flatbush Four, yes.

220
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,393
Yeah, so, uh, who's gonna call
Captain Sunshine?

221
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,933
- Billy.
- Uh, look, guys...

222
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,352
I know he hates me now,
but he's got to be there.

223
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,021
<i>You know it, I know it, so, uh,</i>

224
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,110
do me a favor.
You guys figure it out, all right?

225
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,863
- I got to go now, I'm hanging up.
- Uh, wait, wait, Billy, Billy.

226
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,747
<i>All right, I'll lie to my son,
you tell your wife.</i>

227
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,833
Okay.

228
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,873
So your rental car confirmation
is in your bag.

229
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,508
And when you get to New York,

230
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,589
just follow the directions
to Archie's house.

231
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,550
- Ah, good.
- You getting excited?

232
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,760
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

233
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,721
Bachelor party in Vegas
with a bunch of old fogies. I...

234
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,103
- Oh, come on.
- You're angry at me,

235
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,511
- you don't want me to go. I'll stay.
- No, I'm not angry.

236
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,854
No, don't. Just, uh...

237
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,279
Don't open it
until you get to Las Vegas.

238
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,238
- What is it?
- No, honey, just leave it until you...

239
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,744
Okay, or now,
if you want to open it now.

240
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,871
"What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas"?

241
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,952
A condom and a Viagra?

242
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,623
- Where did you get a condom?
- That's your reaction?

243
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,338
I'm at the pharmacy 30 times a day,
I can get a condom.

244
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,718
Sweetheart, you're unhappy.

245
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
It's like the light has gone out
of your eyes.

246
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,845
And the Florida jokes,
they're... They're getting tired.

247
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,009
And I... I want my guy back.

248
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,726
Heh, so I... I thought, if... If you...

249
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,391
I don't want to know what you do.

250
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,777
Don't tell me about it,
and we will never bring it up again.

251
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,906
You...? Is this some kind of trick?
What...?

252
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,241
- I'm afraid to get out of the car.
- Get out of the car.

253
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,451
- Are you...?
- Get out of the car.

254
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,827
Okay, love you.

255
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,539
Love you.

256
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,891
Ezra!

257
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,529
- I thought you left for work.
- I had to make some phone calls.

258
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,156
- Are you gonna get out of bed?
- No.

259
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,192
Cold. Pfft. Cold.

260
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,612
Pop, it... It's, uh, sweltering in here.

261
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,576
- Is it?
- Yeah.

262
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,866
Listen, maybe I should,
um, stay home today.

263
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,161
No. You...
You don't have to do that.

264
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,126
Thing is, uh...

265
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,170
last night...

266
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,344
I peed myself.

267
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,927
Oh, Pop, I'm sorry.

268
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,933
It's just one of those things
a man has to deal with, alone.

269
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,595
Okay, all right.

270
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,349
Ah-ta-ta-ta.

271
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,142
Open the damn trunk, Sam.

272
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,069
Wait, it's a rental!
I don't know where the thing is!

273
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,678
Hang on, hang on! There it is.

274
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,694
Its Open!

275
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,497
- Let go of the handle.
- Sam, unlock the door.

276
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,292
Let go of it.
Let go of the handle!

277
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,051
- What?
- Just step back!

278
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,056
Go, go, go.

279
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,308
Seat belt, seat belt.

280
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,724
- Archibald.
- Hey, Sam.

281
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,233
You look good.

282
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,235
You lie good.

283
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,244
Yeah.

284
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,080
There it is.

285
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,249
- Let's start the gambling early.
- What?

286
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,005
Hundred dollars
says Paddy will not come.

287
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,668
No, no, he's got to come.

288
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,115
Billy's come through for us
more times than I can count.

289
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,468
It's our turn.

290
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,136
- Prick!
- Ha-ha-ha!

291
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,896
Asshole.

292
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,647
- Hey. Good to see you.
- Ah.

293
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,353
What the hell are you doing
in Brooklyn?

294
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,063
I heard there was
a bathrobe convention.

295
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,649
- Have I come to the right spot?
- Don't be a smart-ass.

296
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,190
- Come on in.
- Heh, Archie's here too.

297
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,779
Uh, he's out in the car.
He couldn't make the...

298
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,622
All the flights of stairs
in his condition.

299
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,994
- Archie's here?
- Yeah.

300
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,156
- In the car.
- What's going on?

301
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,041
Well, the three of us are, uh,

302
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,701
gonna go to Las Vegas
for the weekend.

303
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,625
Why on earth would I ever want
to go to Vegas?

304
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,040
For fun! Remember fun?

305
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,800
That thing you used to have
before the permanent scowl set in?

306
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,586
Come on, I don't have
a permanent scowl.

307
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,380
- He said with a scowl.
- I don't!

308
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,924
Okay, it's not a scowl,
you're just ugly.

309
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,429
Look, just throw some things in a bag.
The flight leaves in a couple of hours.

310
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,097
Come on!
We're not leaving without you.

311
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,936
Either you come with us,
or we move in.

312
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,896
Hold on, hold on.
You show up out of nowhere,

313
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,777
you say we're going to Vegas.
You know what?

314
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,109
- This smells of Billy Gherson.
- Oh, Paddy, Billy Gher...?

315
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,694
This... This has nothing to...

316
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,985
Billy, we want him to come,
of course.

317
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,653
But then he...
You know, he's got a big

318
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,617
- important thing he has to do.
- Of course.

319
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,123
He always has something important.

320
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,000
That's the problem.
It's always about him, him, him.

321
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,207
- What's that about?
- That's just Billy!

322
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,963
- Put it behind you!
- That's right,

323
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,589
he's got more important
things to do.

324
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,546
I have more important
things to do right here.

325
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,881
What's with the pictures of Sophie?
They're everywhere.

326
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,092
Everywhere I turn,
that's all I see: Sophie!

327
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,052
It's getting a little morbid,
don't you think?

328
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,717
- Don't... Don't touch those.
- Oh.

329
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,635
- Jesus.
- Okay, sorry.

330
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,554
- I like looking at her.
- Okay.

331
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,393
That stays there,
this stays here.

332
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,729
Okay.
But you come with me to Vegas.

333
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,693
Paddy, you have got to come
with us to Las Vegas.

334
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,822
If you think
I'm leaving this apartment,

335
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,198
you're dumber than that hat.

336
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,032
Say what you want to me,
but leave my hat out of this, okay?

337
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,741
My hat has never done
a thing to you.

338
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,657
- I'm not going to Vegas!
- Paddy!

339
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,417
What, are you...? Are you nuts?

340
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,377
You're gonna give yourself
another stroke!

341
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,541
Archie, you okay?

342
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,795
- Is he...?
- The stairs. Paddy.

343
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,714
You got to come.

344
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,598
You got to come
to Vegas with us.

345
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,389
- Please, Paddy.
- Okay. Okay.

346
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,145
Okay! All right, I'll go!

347
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,522
I'll go! I'm going!
I'm going, okay?

348
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,604
- Great.
- I got to pack.

349
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,860
- Prick.
- Asshole.

350
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,362
That was well done.

351
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,207
So Billy was so busy,

352
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,414
he couldn't spend the weekend with
his three oldest friends in the world.

353
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,669
Typical.

354
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,172
Once a selfish bastard,
always a selfish bastard.

355
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,674
Never changes.
Never, never changes.

356
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,256
You know, that's the thing
about him, he's just the way he is.

357
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,888
What was so important that
he couldn't spend it with us?

358
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,093
So important?

359
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,304
I agree with everything
you've said, Paddy.

360
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,889
For the last four hours.

361
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,678
Him, him, him.

362
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,438
He didn't even call.

363
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,350
You know, he... A disappointment.
He didn't...

364
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,860
He didn't even call.
All I can say is, if I ever,

365
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,363
ever run into that son of a bitch
again, that prick, I'll...

366
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,864
Forget it.

367
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,775
- He'll regret the day...
- Hey!

368
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,534
Ha, ha! Well!

369
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,740
- Surprise!
- Hey!

370
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,530
Hey, Archie, how you doing? Sam.

371
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,165
Hey! Ya fun fun!

372
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,076
Hey, hey,
what's that hair color?

373
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,619
- Hazelnut?
- Have you got more hair

374
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,833
than you used to have?

375
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,214
- Oh, stop it, will you?
- You've got more hair than...

376
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,124
Where'd you get the extra hair?

377
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,259
His ass.

378
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,011
Hey, look, don't be upset
with them, Pat.

379
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,888
- It wasn't their fault.
- I'm going home.

380
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,049
Paddy, look,
I'm getting married, okay?

381
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,184
This is a bachelor party,
I needed you here.

382
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,811
- I'm going home.
- How many times

383
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,186
do I got to tell you I'm sorry?

384
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,690
You can't say it enough, my friend.
You can't say it enough.

385
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,691
Every time I see you,
we go through this shit.

386
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,694
One more word, I'm gonna knock
your block off like I did in fifth grade.

387
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,902
All right, all right, all right.
Hey, hey, hey! Knock this shit off!

388
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,159
The hell's the matter with you?

389
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,911
Now we're here together,
the four of us.

390
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,415
We're here to celebrate
Billy marrying an infant.

391
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,166
- She's not an infant.
- Shut up, Billy!

392
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,078
Archie, blood pressure?

393
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,372
I need this.

394
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,462
Sam needs this.

395
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,549
And believe it or not, you two
jerk-offs need it most of all.

396
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,305
Now, either you'll manage
to be civil with each other,

397
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,468
or so help me, I'm gonna rain
holy hell down on both of you.

398
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,136
You understand?

399
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,225
- Huh?
- Yeah.

400
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,141
I'm gonna go find some damn water
and take all my damn pills.

401
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,277
Then we gonna get
this damn party started.

402
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,733
Yeah.

403
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,569
It's gonna be fun.

404
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,905
- Where to?
- Remember Binion's,

405
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,661
where I had my bachelor party?

406
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,449
I looked it up on the Google,
they've just renovated it.

407
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,334
- Billy, Miriam gave me a condom...
- He won't shut up about it.

408
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,666
- I won't shut up?
- You sound like 6 year olds.

409
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,957
Billy, now that you've got
ass-hair on your head,

410
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,798
do you wash your hair,
or do you just wipe?

411
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,993
- Pardon me.
- Uh, excuse me.

412
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,951
Um, where's the check-in desk?

413
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,117
- Check-in desk?
- For the hotel? Check-in?

414
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:32,457
Hell, they closed the hotel part
down for remodeling months ago.

415
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,999
Reopening next year.
It's gonna be real nice.

416
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,545
Uh, we have a problem.

417
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:44,557
The rooms, uh, aren't gonna be ready
for another year and a half.

418
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:45,887
They're still remodeling.

419
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,553
Archibald, did this topic

420
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,471
come up when you made
the reservation?

421
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:54,313
No, because you insisted
on making the reservations.

422
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:58,525
I insisted, but then you insisted,
and it is the second insister

423
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,815
- that supersedes the first.
- Sam. Sam.

424
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,484
I offered, you insisted.

425
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,369
Guys, guys,
don't worry about it, all right?

426
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,529
Lisa and I are staying
at the Aria for the wedding.

427
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,324
- I'm just texting my assistant.
- Yeah, see that? No problem.

428
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,619
Big shot's assistant
will take care of everything.

429
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:16,710
Meantime, I got to look for a bathroom.
Or don't they have that either?

430
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,047
Okay.

431
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,709
We'll go to your hotel.

432
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,924
- But we're the ones getting the rooms.
- Yeah, that's right.

433
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,840
Soon as I have a drink.
It's 5:00 in Florida.

434
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,179
- I'll join you.
- If you insist.

435
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,016
You know, Sam, it was you who
insisted on making the reservation.

436
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,180
And where'd you get that silly hat?

437
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,520
Oh, why is my hat the default insult?

438
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:39,904
Can thrill me like you do?

439
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:43,779
<i>And fill my heart with love</i>

440
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,911
<i>For only you</i>

441
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,123
<i>Only you</i>

442
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:55,620
<i>Can make this change in me</i>

443
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:59,757
<i>For it's true</i>

444
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:04,261
<i>You are my destiny</i>

445
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,891
<i>When you hold my hand
I understand</i>

446
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,768
<i>The magic that you do</i>

447
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,021
<i>You're my dream come true</i>

448
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,151
<i>My one and only you</i>

449
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,030
<i>Only you</i>

450
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:28,152
<i>Only you can make
This change in me</i>

451
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,288
<i>For it's true</i>

452
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:36,081
<i>You are my destiny</i>

453
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,666
<i>When you hold my hand</i>

454
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,831
<i>I understand</i>

455
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:45,549
<i>The magic that you do</i>

456
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,841
<i>You're my dream come true</i>

457
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:55,730
<i>My one and only</i>

458
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,313
<i>You</i>

459
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,608
All right. All right.

460
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,857
Terrific.

461
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,698
Thank you! But all that tells me is
that wherever you guys are from,

462
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,407
you lack quality entertainment.

463
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,748
Okay, that'll do it for me.

464
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,832
Make sure to tip your waitresses.
It's pretty funny when they fall over.

465
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,338
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Oof.

466
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,416
Sam, Sam.

467
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,629
No, she's good, she's good.

468
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,011
My friends and I, uh,
would like to buy you a drink.

469
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,012
Um, you were the ones laughing.

470
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,889
In that case,
I should buy you a drink.

471
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,595
- Ah, heh.
- Oh, hardly.

472
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,510
- I'm Diana Boyle.
- Hi, I'm Billy Gherson.

473
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,019
- I'm Archie Clayton.
- Hey.

474
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,648
- Hi. Uh, that's Sam Harris.
- Hey, Diana, please, sit down.

475
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,901
- Let go of her hand.
- Thank you.

476
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,609
Wow. You were...
That was just incredible.

477
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,944
And... And I'm just gonna
preemptively just put my cards

478
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,109
- on the table, and say that... Ah.
- Sam.

479
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,655
My wife of 40 years
has given me permission to,

480
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:59,578
basically, uh, cheat on her
this next few days.

481
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,917
And so I just wanted to
let you know, in case, uh, you...

482
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,424
- I'm available.
- That's a generous offer.

483
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,050
Are you good in bed, Sam?

484
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,341
I don't remember.

485
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,051
Ha-ha-ha.
- Great!

486
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,851
Uh, Carol, could I have
a Sapphire Martini, straight up

487
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,106
- with a twist, please? Gentlemen?
- All right.

488
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,858
Uh, what...? Uh, no alcohol.

489
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,438
- He won't have alcohol.
- What?

490
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,525
Bombay Sapphire martini,
straight up.

491
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,065
Don't pay any mind to him.

492
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,609
- I'm a big drinker, I drink all the time.
- Okay, okay.

493
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,277
- Bring him two.
- And I'll have one.

494
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,615
I'll... I'll have one as well.

495
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,701
So, what brings you boys to Vegas?

496
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,492
I'll tell you what brings us to Vegas:
a big fat liar.

497
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,161
I just wanted to come over
and tell you how much I enjoyed

498
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,954
- your performance.
- Oh, thank you.

499
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,964
You're no spring chicken,
but you deserve better

500
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,251
- than being around these lowlifes.
- Wow!

501
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,715
Prince Charming, is that you?

502
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:53,472
You are so much shorter
than I thought you would be.

503
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:59,352
No, actually we're here, uh,
for a wedding.

504
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,809
Our friend Hazelnut
is tying the knot on Sunday.

505
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:05,021
- Yeah? Oh.
- So, all right. So long, jerk-offs.

506
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:08,028
I'm gonna go look for a hotel
that actually has hotel rooms.

507
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,564
Wait, wait. Why are you leaving?

508
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,528
Because of this schmuck,
that's why.

509
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,818
We got a couple
of unresolved issues.

510
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,281
Is he a schmuck?

511
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,164
- It's a gray area.
- Hmm.

512
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,368
We've been best friends
since we're 6 years old.

513
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,332
My wife dies about a year ago, he
doesn't even show up for the funeral.

514
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,622
It's a little more complicated
than that. I...

515
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,667
Yeah, sends me flowers with a note
that says "Sorry for your loss."

516
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,052
Schmuck.

517
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,509
Well, I am sorry that you're leaving.

518
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,015
Clearly I need someone
to look out for me,

519
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:41,554
seeing as how I'm associating
with an alcoholic, an adulterer

520
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,347
- and a schmuck.
- Heh, heh.

521
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,685
I like you.

522
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:45,895
- Well.
- Pat Connors.

523
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,810
Still Diana Boyle.

524
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,023
- Diana?
- Ah!

525
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,438
- Oh, look here.
- There you are.

526
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:54,234
To the first bachelor party
I've ever attended

527
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,992
that could be covered by Medicare.

528
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,324
- Ha-ha-ha.
- And, um, to the only

529
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,206
people here who actually
listened to me sing.

530
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,617
Thank you for that.

531
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,832
Hey, you, eye contact.

532
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,872
Doesn't mean a thing
without eye contact.

533
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,221
How old is the woman
that he is marrying?

534
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,007
- Uh, she's, uh...
- Oh, well, you know, she's...

535
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,175
- Uh, just, uh, in her...
- 30-ish.

536
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,719
Oh, sweet Jesus.

537
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,887
Guys, come on, we got to
get going here, all right?

538
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,273
- Let's get over to the Aria.
- Oh, that's a great hotel.

539
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,559
- Has my lucky big wheel.
- Mm. Big wheel.

540
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,023
- Then you're coming with us.
- She is?

541
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,866
What the hell is with this traffic?

542
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,823
- Are you comfortable?
- No, I'm... I'm fine.

543
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,910
- I can make him sit in the back.
- No, he doesn't have to go in the back.

544
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,619
- Are you sure?
- Screw this, all right?

545
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,409
- Let's just get out of here.
- What?

546
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,952
- Let's get out. Screw it.
- Really?

547
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,712
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.
Lead on, man.

548
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,723
<i>Whoa-hoo, hoo-hoo.</i>

549
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,803
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

550
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,400
What is that, a map?

551
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,107
Look at them.

552
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,147
The moron brigade.

553
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,502
So now it's just me, on my own.

554
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,085
There's this young girl, a neighbor,
she keeps trying to bring me soup.

555
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,841
- Well, she sounds terrible.
- She is terrible.

556
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,217
Soup's not bad.

557
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,852
- Aria.
- Gentlemen checking in?

558
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,434
Gherson. Gherson.

559
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,019
I'll take that, sir.

560
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,949
All right, gentlemen, I'm gonna
touch base with my bride-to-be.

561
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,583
She has her own phone?

562
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,210
Yes, Archie,
she has her own phone.

563
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,542
- Not a toy phone?
- Children are learning more and more

564
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,127
about new technology.
They're younger and younger.

565
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,008
Oh, like a baby monitor?

566
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,714
You guys finished?

567
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,676
- Not yet.
- All right, huddle up, huddle up.

568
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,557
You are surrounded
by slot machines,

569
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,811
poker, roulette,
and there are girls at every bar.

570
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,347
I want to hear stories,
I want to hear results,

571
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,642
I want to hear all of you
getting in trouble.

572
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,277
And I'm sure
this young lady can help you.

573
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,187
See you back here.

574
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,949
Ah, this is the one, this is the one.

575
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,702
Okay, so put a dollar down.

576
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,113
- I don't gamble.
- Oh, this is not gambling.

577
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,452
This, my friend, is a sure thing.

578
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,995
- Yeah, but it's throwing money away.
- Come on, Paddy, give me a dollar.

579
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,171
- Perfect, we're in.
- Good luck.

580
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,128
Come on. Come on.

581
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,042
Come on.

582
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,599
Oh, congratulations!
Five dollars off the buffet.

583
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,382
Yes, we did it.

584
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,553
Our lives are changed forever,
Paddy. Can you feel it'?

585
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,938
All right, Paddy, you just won
five dollars off the buffet.

586
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,065
- What are you gonna do first?
- Go to the buffet.

587
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,067
He's going to the buffet,
ladies and gentlemen,

588
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,728
the man is going to the buffet. Yay!

589
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:21,114
Paddy, Paddy, Paddy, uh, uh,
the good news is that this hotel

590
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,991
actually does have rooms.

591
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,823
The bad news is that
none are available.

592
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,243
Don't tell Billy, please.

593
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,872
I don't give a flying fart about Billy.
Where am I gonna sleep?

594
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,249
Well, they said
they might have some after 6.

595
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,001
So here's the deal:

596
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,333
Lisa wants me
to check out the chapel.

597
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,839
Heh, she's got you on a short leash,
doesn't she?

598
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,592
- Kids these days.
- Well, would Mrs. Don Rickles

599
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,423
happen to know
where the chapel is?

600
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,463
I do, and I will show you.

601
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,007
- That's okay, that's fine, I'll find it...
- No, no, no, shh.

602
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:50,018
- I'm being wonderful.
- Take your time.

603
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,181
Plenty of time. We got till 6.

604
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,357
Blackjack. I used to like blackjack.

605
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,238
- Archie?
- Archie.

606
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,949
- I'm a little concerned...
- Yeah.

607
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,455
Uh, ahem. Can I sit here?

608
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,867
- Every time.
- Yes, of course, sir.

609
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,582
- Yeah, sit down.
- Cocktail, cigarettes?

610
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,424
- Sir?
- Yeah?

611
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,381
Sir, I think she's asking
if you have

612
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,887
any, uh, money in that
fanny pack of yours.

613
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,140
- Oh. Ha, ha.
- Yeah, there you go.

614
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,141
Excuse me, cocktails.

615
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,723
Holy crap, what, did you rob a bank?

616
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:36,766
Sort of. I emptied out
half my pension, $15,000.

617
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,184
- What?
- You all right?

618
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,145
Guys, come on.

619
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,654
I'm on a weekend furlough
from prison.

620
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,235
I don't know about you,
but I'm making the most of it.

621
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,526
Seriously, count a little slower, Ling.

622
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,911
- Come on, Paddy, join us, this is... Oh.
- Oh!

623
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,117
Uh, sorry.

624
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,281
Kidding me?
It's like you did that on purpose.

625
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,075
No, no, it's... It was just an accident.

626
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,119
What are you, his bodyguard?
No, you know what?

627
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,879
Thank you, guys, for killing
a really, really hot table.

628
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,711
We're done.

629
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,837
Fifteen thousand coming in.

630
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,339
And on that happy note,
I've got a certain prophylactic device

631
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,429
burning a hole in my pocket.

632
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,559
I will see you gentlemen later.

633
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,396
- Sam. Sam?
- What?

634
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,228
Glasses. Take your glasses off.

635
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,768
Makes you look younger.

636
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,239
- He does?
- No.

637
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,534
Hi.

638
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,867
- Hello, sir.
- A, uh, gin and tonic.

639
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,326
Right away.

640
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,957
Hi.

641
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,631
You have to see it.

642
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,049
I'm sure.

643
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,217
There he is. Hi.

644
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,182
Hello.

645
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,813
- Come here often?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

646
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,066
It's a good place for me to relax
between shows.

647
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,443
Between shows?
Your shows... Your show?

648
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,445
Yeah, I love this place.
It's got a nice, uh,

649
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,698
"anything can happen"
kind of atmosphere,

650
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:08,903
you know what I mean?

651
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,318
Oh, is that a wedding ring
you're sporting there?

652
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,328
It is a wedding ring, but, uh,
the great thing is, I have permission.

653
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,990
My wife is, uh, very open.

654
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,204
Well, okay.

655
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,460
Okay...?

656
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,413
Okay, well, uh, let me...
Let me buy you another drink.

657
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,629
- I just have one question for you.
- What's that?

658
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,885
What would my wife think?

659
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,386
What? Hol...

660
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,340
Excuse me, I just have...

661
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,594
Oh. Oh.

662
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,228
I'm... You're... You're... I...

663
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,138
You're a... You're a trans...

664
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,774
Trans... planted New Yorker?

665
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,481
- New Jersey.
- Jersey? Oh, Brooklyn. Oh.

666
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,271
You look fantastic.

667
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,281
And I do not judge,
I make no judgments.

668
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,862
Oh, no, no.
No judgment here either.

669
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,117
"Papa Don't Preach."

670
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,745
- No, no, good.
- It's a Madonna song.

671
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,579
I get it. You're Madonna.

672
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,368
Uh, hello, I'm Sam.

673
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,207
- Sam Harris.
- Maurice Tischler.

674
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,751
Yeah.

675
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,291
This is it.

676
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,050
If you're gonna
get hitched in Vegas,

677
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,587
this is pretty much the least
depressing place you can do it.

678
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,466
Hey, I like it.

679
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,017
Well, good.

680
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,220
I will, uh, leave you to it.

681
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,730
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

682
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,233
Welcome to where love takes flight.

683
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,064
Hi. Billy Gherson.

684
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,945
- Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Gherson.
- Hi.

685
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,947
I should have known. Ha, ha.

686
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,700
I've seen a lot of couples
come down this aisle.

687
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,576
I can always tell when it's true love.

688
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,370
Uh, no, no, no,
this is not my fiancé.

689
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,784
- No.
- Oh, no, no, no.

690
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,545
This man would never marry
someone even close to his own age.

691
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,456
So who are you?

692
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,920
I'm his mother.

693
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,880
So we got a lounge singer
of a certain age.

694
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,095
- Oh, how delicately put.
- But not from here.

695
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,760
- Atlanta.
- Right.

696
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:03,556
In my former life,
I was a tax attorney.

697
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,475
Um, I raised a daughter on my own.

698
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:11,147
Her father was an asshole
of epic proportions,

699
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,692
and I got her through school
and, um...

700
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,986
Now, I am giving you the full bio here.
Should I stop or...?

701
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,574
- No, no, no, go on, go on.
- Really?

702
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,284
- Yes.
- Okay. Um...

703
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,949
And so a few months ago,

704
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:25,039
I found myself downsized
and empty-nested,

705
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,420
and I asked myself,

706
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:31,959
"What do you really want to do
with your life, Diana Boyle?"

707
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,925
And what I really wanted to do
was sing.

708
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,215
<i>I'm a little old for American Idol.</i>

709
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,055
- Oh.
- So I figured Vegas.

710
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,892
And so, you know,
as they say, it goes.

711
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,354
A big shot at mbon's needed
some legal advice,

712
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:53,067
so basically, I got that gig
sewed up till I drop.

713
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,152
It was nice of you
to walk me to my car.

714
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,446
Oh, well, it was, um,

715
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,456
nice of you to walk me to the chapel.

716
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:09,671
You know, you are not as charming
as you think you are.

717
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,795
Well, no one could be, quite frankly.

718
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,428
It was nice.

719
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:22,593
Congratulations! So long, schmuck!

720
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,442
Hey, babe.

721
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,358
No, no, I just came from...

722
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,023
Yeah.

723
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,612
It's interesting. It's, uh...

724
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:39,822
No, you're gonna love it.

725
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,452
You're really gonna love it.

726
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,954
- Surgery?
- Yeah.

727
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,457
- That's... That's a game-changer.
- Well, it's just a big commitment.

728
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,290
There's no going back, you know.
It's not the pain,

729
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,830
- I mean, it's the recovery time.
- How long is the recovery?

730
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,215
It's like eight to 12 weeks.
It's hard for a man to take.

731
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,297
- So he's out for the season.
- Totally out.

732
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,008
That's why you gotta go
with the Packers, and the points.

733
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,013
- All the girls are making the same bet.
- Sam.

734
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,970
- It's a no-brainer.
- Sam!

735
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,850
Come on, come on.

736
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,352
Uh...

737
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,888
Nice to meet you. Madonna, Cher.

738
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,647
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- Call me. Call me.

739
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,774
Sam, where have you been?

740
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,606
I've been, uh,
working the room.

741
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,486
You gotta stop him.
You gotta stop him.

742
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,238
- What? Stop what?
- Archie, he lost it.

743
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,444
Lost what?

744
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,408
Archie?

745
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,753
I'm so sorry, Archie.

746
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,554
I begged and I begged him,
he just wouldn't stop.

747
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,015
- I don't know what to say.
- Yeah, well, okay.

748
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,098
Another bet, sir?

749
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,271
How much was that last bet?

750
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,562
- Nine thousand.
- He lost 9,000?

751
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,371
- How much left?
- What are you doing?

752
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,739
Let me count.

753
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,701
You started with fifteen thousand.

754
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,203
Now you have...

755
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,035
102,000, sir.

756
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,504
Okay, I'm done.

757
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,084
- Hundred and two thousand?
- That's enough.

758
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,423
- Yeah, that's a good decision.
- Excuse me, sir,

759
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,758
are you a guest in the hotel?

760
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,219
Oh, we were... We really...
We've gotta...

761
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,974
Actually, we just...

762
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,806
Great game, great game,
great dealer.

763
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,140
Great table, great game.

764
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,395
How much?

765
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,977
- Hundred and two thousand.
- Hundred and two.

766
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,897
So, what happened?
We break a rule or something?

767
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,733
Are they gonna take
his money back or what?

768
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:39,942
I don't know.

769
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,442
My son. It's Ezra. It's my son.

770
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,077
Hello, Ezra.

771
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,203
Wonderful to hear from you, son.

772
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,833
Ezra, calm down.
Calm down. I'm at the church retreat.

773
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,879
Uh, that? Um...

774
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,791
That was the Holy Spirit
getting into people.

775
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,586
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

776
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,800
- Praise the Lord!
- Ezra, I'm going to have to go.

777
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,931
I think the Holy Spirit's
about to leave the room.

778
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,138
I'm gonna see
if I can't stop him, okay?

779
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,018
- I shall not want.
- I love you, son. Amen.

780
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,895
He maketh me to lie down...
Did he buy it?

781
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,022
I don't know, I was improvising,
same as you.

782
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,433
Well...

783
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,103
- He... He walketh me.
- Hello.

784
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,064
The Lord is my shepherd.

785
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,449
- Praise the... Oh.
- It's Billy. Billy!

786
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,984
I'm at the pool.

787
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,777
- He's at the pool.
- What's he doing?

788
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,038
- What's at the pool?
- Where is the pool'?

789
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,706
Welcome to Las Vegas.

790
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,081
- Yes!
- Yeah.

791
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,413
- Relax, Gherson.
- Aw, yeah.

792
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,873
It's not like you invented it.

793
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,122
Oh, Jesus.

794
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,466
Ay.

795
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,006
We got a bikini contest coming up!

796
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,768
Who wants to be a judge?
I do!

797
00:41:56,264 --> 00:42:00,189
Idea. Let's see
what we can do with this.

798
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,236
Are you ready to Party Rock?

799
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,776
I go by the name of Redfoo!

800
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,780
Yeah, we got cash, we got prizes,

801
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:16,497
and we got the best judges
in the world!

802
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:20,331
Put your hands up, put your hands up,
put your hands up!

803
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,248
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

804
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,334
Yeah!

805
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,218
Well, check your pulse, fellas,

806
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,427
because coming to the stage
is our first girl.

807
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,391
She's from Seattle
and she likes to get wet, baby!

808
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,727
- Whoo!
- Jessica!

809
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,643
I love you, Jessica!

810
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,614
Yeah, look at them assets, baby!

811
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,108
Yeah!

812
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,114
Judges, judges,
what you got for Jessica?

813
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,823
Ten, baby!

814
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,417
Ten!

815
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,834
Ten! Yeah, baby!

816
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,794
Unh! Looking good.

817
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:09,304
Next coming up is Christina,
and she's a redhead,

818
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,135
and let me tell you,

819
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,470
it's au naturel, baby.

820
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,761
Judges?

821
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,063
Ten, baby!

822
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,692
IRena, baby, yeah!

823
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,071
Bring out Patrice!

824
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,860
Ah! Come on and shout it!

825
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,786
Baby!

826
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,510
Mm-hm, yeah!

827
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,421
Unh! Looking good!

828
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,464
Yeah!

829
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,562
Eleven!

830
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,062
Let's get to know the judges.

831
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:05,397
Can we get to know the judges?

832
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,187
What's your name there, sir?

833
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,526
- Uh, Sam.
- All right.

834
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,818
Oh, and I'm available,
I have a condom.

835
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,362
Oh, yeah. Yeah, baby!

836
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:19,123
Who's that?
What is your name, party planner?

837
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,447
Uh, Paddy.

838
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,084
Paddy!

839
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:29,209
Well, Paddy, I got a special package
just for you, baby!

840
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,516
Aw, yeah, baby!

841
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,348
- Yeah, baby!
- Ha-ha-ha!

842
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,603
Yeah, baby!

843
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,020
I don't know how Paddy
could have given her a seven.

844
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,110
She was too young.
She shouldn't have been there.

845
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,115
- I liked Mr. Redfoo.
- Who's that?

846
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,776
The guy who put his balls
in your face.

847
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,285
- Oh, yeah, liked him.
- Ha-ha-ha.

848
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,287
- He knows how to keep a party...
- Mr. Clayton?

849
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,957
Quite a run you had at blackjack.
Can we talk?

850
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:03,709
- Well, I...
- Apparently,

851
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,836
you aren't actually staying here,
is that correct?

852
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,292
Now, wait a minute here.

853
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,298
Are you suggesting my friend
is a card counter

854
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,300
because he took your casino
for a hundred grand?

855
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,882
No, he won fair and square,
and actually we'd just like

856
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:16,264
to have a chance
to win some of that money back

857
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,140
by giving you someplace nice to stay.

858
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,676
Hey, Alan, you wanted
to talk to me'?

859
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,810
- Heh. This is Lonnie.
- Hey.

860
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,971
He's gonna take care of you
this weekend.

861
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,553
Uh, with all due respect,
I believe I'm actually assigned to...

862
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,397
- Uh, he canceled.
- He canceled?

863
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,572
Yeah, give these gentlemen Villa 4.

864
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:36,614
Are you sure he canceled?
I just confirmed with his travel a...

865
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:37,902
Good day, gentlemen.

866
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

867
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,831
Thank you.

868
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,205
I hope there's room enough
for four guys

869
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:48,338
because there's no way
I'm sharing a bed with this cupcake.

870
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,751
The penthouse villa.

871
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,677
Dollar for dollar, one of the best suites
in all of Vegas.

872
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,432
Four bedrooms up top,

873
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,434
fully stocked bar, gourmet kitchen,

874
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,516
and all the amenities
you see before you.

875
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,431
You know what I feel like?

876
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,894
I feel like a damn princess.

877
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,981
So intimate, that's what I love.

878
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,521
I'm at your disposal for anything else
that you might need.

879
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,565
Is that your job?
You're just here for us?

880
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,950
You wouldn't believe who I was
supposed to be hosting.

881
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,281
Who?

882
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,490
Fiddy.

883
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:21,825
Fiddy Fiddy?

884
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,537
- Fifty.
- Fifty people in here?

885
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,077
No, no, 50 Cent. Curtis Jackson.

886
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,166
- Oh, from the Jackson 5, sure.
- Yeah, okay.

887
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,757
50 Cent's a pretty big deal
in modern times,

888
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,830
and one of the perks of hosting him is,
you know,

889
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,800
I get that second-and third-round
draft pick. You know what I mean?

890
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:39,305
We don't.

891
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,219
Like, the leftover...

892
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,098
So I'm assuming you guys are not
gonna wanna visit our nightclub.

893
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,262
Nightclub? Dancing?

894
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,476
Yes, Mr. Clayton,

895
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,107
I believe some people will be dancing
at the nightclub.

896
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:53,019
Oh, all right. Okay. Ah.

897
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,313
Usually gets jumping around 11:00.

898
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,823
If you like, I can pick you up
or wake you up.

899
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,780
- Oh!
- Oh, oh, oh.

900
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,411
- What are we talking about?
- That's when we come alive.

901
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,243
Midnight at the disco,
we'll see you there.

902
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,749
We're always up and about
after midnight on the weekends.

903
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,410
- A little after, maybe.
- I'll leave you gentlemen to your fun.

904
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,624
- Thank you.
- Keys.

905
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,504
How do you get
these damn curtains open?

906
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,210
I know how these things work.

907
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,091
Let's get some light in here, Jesus.

908
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,094
We've got one of these
consoles in every single room.

909
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,630
Ready, one, two, three. Unh!

910
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:23,849
Let me, uh, help you geniuses.

911
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,055
The hell?

912
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,094
- Okay.
- Oh, there's a window.

913
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,309
Oh, of course, of course.

914
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,645
A lot of times they just
put a light back there.

915
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,643
It's probably fake. It's fake. I give up.

916
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,188
- Whoa, whoa.
- Did you do that?

917
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,406
Whoa.

918
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,610
Curtains, music, lighting.

919
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,654
And if you're really
feeling adventurous,

920
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,040
we now have color television.
Have a good day, sir.

921
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,416
- Oh, cute.
- Ha, ha.

922
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,040
Fellas, look at this.

923
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,204
Oh, no.

924
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,170
An old friend.

925
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:57,709
Is that what I think it is?

926
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,877
You mean you kept that
all this time?

927
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,467
Goddamn right I have.
The Flatbush Four is back,

928
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,428
and we're not on any
Brooklyn street corner,

929
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,467
- man, we're on top of Vegas.
- Ha-ha-ha.

930
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,557
Celebrating my wedding. Heh.

931
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,560
- Let's get it on! Ha-ha-ha!
- Let's go on.

932
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:15,610
- I'll get some ice.
- Okay, all right, damn.

933
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,736
Yeah, just like you, Gherson.

934
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,068
Let's forget about everything
we've done to hurt people.

935
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,700
Let's just move on
and celebrate me, that's all.

936
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,369
Paddy, I should have been there.

937
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,284
You're damn right
you should have been there.

938
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,622
You should have been there,

939
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,038
and, you know, she wanted you
to do the eulogy.

940
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,831
She wanted you, and you knew that.

941
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,965
She knew I would fall apart
in front of everybody,

942
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,719
and she knew you would make
everybody laugh, Mr. Comedian,

943
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,129
but no.

944
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,595
You didn't show up,
you were too busy.

945
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,475
Too busy for my wife's funeral,

946
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,934
our Sophie's funeral,
so I had to do it.

947
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,724
I didn't get one word out.
Broke down like a baby.

948
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,058
I'm sorry, Paddy.

949
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,227
Ah, no, you're a phony, Gherson.

950
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,987
You always have been,
you always will be.

951
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,318
Everything about you is phony.

952
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,608
Your teeth, your hair,
even your tan is phony.

953
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,447
Ah, Jesus, Paddy, you know, you...

954
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,328
Hey, Paddy, come on, man,
for crying out loud,

955
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,455
we're just trying to have
a nice weekend together.

956
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,491
Nice weekend?
You call this a nice weekend?

957
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,955
This is sad.

958
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,086
I'd give my left arm to be
with my wife right now,

959
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,498
and all Sammy wants to do
is cheat on his.

960
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,087
And, Archie, you're on some sort of
self-destructive bender,

961
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,550
cleaning out your pension fund
like you're so desperate to be alive.

962
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,885
And this guy wants us to validate
his marrying a child.

963
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:30,142
Well, you know what? I'm not gonna
be part of this charade, not me.

964
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,359
Naptime.

965
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,036
No, it's easy as long
as you have a couple girls...

966
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:04,968
Oh, my God.

967
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,762
Uh, we've been here
like an hour, Billy.

968
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,266
I think they're only letting
people with cleavage in.

969
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,059
Screw it, follow me.

970
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,061
- Ahem.
- Where are we going?

971
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,563
Billy?

972
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,944
So, what's it gonna take
for three VIPs?

973
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,854
Who's your VIP host?

974
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,273
- VIP host?
- VIP host.

975
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,237
Oh, that's what's-his...?
Uh, our friend, uh...

976
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,072
- Oh, yeah, yeah, um...
- Larry. Larry.

977
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,329
- Louie. Remember Louie?
- Lorrie? Louis? No, no, no.

978
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,740
- Larry? Larry, Larry.
- No, it's an

979
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,749
No, you got it all wrong.
We don't know.

980
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,080
Uh, he's a nice guy.

981
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,335
Get back in line.

982
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:40,003
You sure about that, son?

983
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:48,967
He's laughing.

984
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,304
- Oh, y'all are serious, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

985
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,644
Look, the only way you guys
are getting in there tonight

986
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,480
is VIP bottle service.

987
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,235
- All right, I got that.
- No, no, no.

988
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,442
We got, we got it.
No, no, this is on us.

989
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,357
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen. Okay, 18.

990
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,822
- Here's my friend's ten.
- Yep.

991
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,238
And I've got...
Here's one, two, three,

992
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,406
- and five.
- There you go.

993
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,747
And one for your warmth
and hospitality.

994
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,004
- Eighteen hundred.
- Eighteen hundred what?

995
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,381
Eighteen hundred dollars, fellas.

996
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,130
Fuck!

997
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:31,014
Uh, no, I got this. I'm up $102,000.

998
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,263
We'll take the bottles.

999
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,596
Bottle. One bottle.

1000
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,345
You shitting me?

1001
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:41,857
We'll take it.

1002
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,290
- Here you go, fellas.
- Whoa!

1003
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,201
Ha, ha. All right.

1004
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,584
- Thank you.
- Hey.

1005
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,963
Gentlemen. Not too shabby, huh?

1006
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,124
- Not too.
- No wonder it's $1,800.

1007
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,714
Look at the size of this thing.

1008
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,050
Yeah, that's my boy! Make it happen!

1009
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,304
- Hi.
- Hi.

1010
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,265
She's on my lap.
There's a girl on my lap.

1011
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,522
- Do you mind?
- No, no, no.

1012
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,274
It's, uh... It's titanium.
It, uh, can't feel a thing.

1013
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,401
What can we start
you gentlemen off with?

1014
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,938
- How about some Red Bull vodkas?
- Yeah!

1015
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,448
- Red Bull vodkas.
- Uh, I probably should take it easy.

1016
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,826
- How about just a glass of soda?
- Yeah, yeah, me too.

1017
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,237
I feel a little...

1018
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,952
Well, I can't tell if I'm having
another stroke

1019
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,787
or if it's these dad-gum lights.

1020
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,452
- Huh?
- What's with you guys, all right?

1021
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,621
- Huh?
- Today you were just fine.

1022
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,540
Now all of a sudden
you're like two old dogs

1023
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,255
being dragged out of the back
of the house to lie down and die.

1024
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,135
Three Red Bull vodkas.

1025
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,556
- What's a rebel vodka?
- I don't know.

1026
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,848
- He just asked for my number!
- Ah, yeah, girl!

1027
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,389
Hey, Sam. Got a little bachelorette
party going on over there.

1028
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:07,605
I bet there's at least three girls there
that got some serious daddy issues.

1029
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,566
- Archie!
- Huh?

1030
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,231
- You said you wanted to dance.
- Yeah.

1031
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,195
Now's your chance.

1032
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:15,347
I'm still, uh, a little
concerned about...

1033
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,829
Oh, no, no, let's not talk
about Paddy now, huh? Please.

1034
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,483
Boy, these
"Red Balls" vodkas are strange.

1035
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:55,195
I feel like I'm getting drunk
and electrocuted at the same time.

1036
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,327
And the music! Loud!
Like everything sounds alike.

1037
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,864
Like they're playing the same song
over and over and over and over again.

1038
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,204
I probably should get up and dance,
but I'm used to having a partner.

1039
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,586
Certainly doesn't seem
to matter to that fella.

1040
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,747
Maybe I'll give it a shot. Maybe not.

1041
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,666
Well, if they play something different.
Oh, shit, maybe now.

1042
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,052
- Yeah!
- Ha-ha-ha!

1043
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,631
Go, Archie!

1044
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,095
Hey.

1045
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,393
Whoo!

1046
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:31,018
Hello.

1047
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:32,232
- Hi.
- Hi.

1048
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,771
Can I ask you a question?

1049
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,690
- Yes.
- Do you guys have drugs?

1050
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,947
Does Lipitor count?

1051
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,362
So...

1052
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,665
what are you guys doing here?

1053
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,326
- It's my bachelor party.
- Oh.

1054
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:50,588
I just think it's so cute

1055
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:54,000
when older people get married.

1056
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:58,012
- It's never too late, right?
- Right, right.

1057
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,673
Actually, uh, she's not older.

1058
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,809
She's more your age.

1059
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:07,472
You must be really rich.

1060
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,110
You're kind of blowing my mind
right now.

1061
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,987
- Oh?
- Yeah, it's just... It's like...

1062
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,399
- You're so cute.
- I...

1063
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,067
It's freaking me out.

1064
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,611
As I look at you,

1065
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,654
- Yeah?
- All I can think about

1066
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,166
is how much you look
like my grandpa Lou.

1067
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,060
He's in a nursing home
outside Fort Lauderdale.

1068
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,542
Uh, who isn't?

1069
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,884
- Hey, angel, come on, get out here.
- Hey. Uh, excuse me,

1070
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,090
I'm talking to another person.

1071
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,972
Yeah, but you should be talking to me.
I'm more interesting. Come on.

1072
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,382
Go away, seriously.

1073
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:46,553
You know, I just don't get it, all right?
It's not like you're married yet.

1074
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,141
Just spread it around a little
before it gets dusty, you know?

1075
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:52,558
Ew. Look you little jerk-off,
I don't wanna dance with you.

1076
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,146
I don't wanna dance with you either.

1077
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,107
- Everything all right here?
- Fanny Pack.

1078
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:57,988
You... You guys are everywhere.

1079
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,864
What's your deal?
Can I see that real quick?

1080
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,616
Buddy, maybe you had
too much to drink.

1081
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,869
Hey, pal, why don't you
mind your business?

1082
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,620
You don't wanna make
a fool of yourself.

1083
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,578
You know what? If I want your opinion,
I'll just beat it out of you.

1084
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,085
- Hey, hey, hey, what's the problem?
- Hey, hey, hey! What's going on?

1085
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,324
Sam?

1086
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:17,045
Oh. Now I'm gonna enjoy this one,
asshole. You know that?

1087
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:25,091
No one calls us names except us.
You understand?

1088
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,634
Paddy.

1089
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,017
Just get him out of here.

1090
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,769
- Take him out the side.
- We're going.

1091
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,181
- Your son's been calling.
- Huh?

1092
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,644
Good shot, Paddy.

1093
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,228
Damn, fellas, that Paddy's a beast.
Heh.

1094
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,192
There you are.

1095
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,692
- Lonnie.
- Lonnie.

1096
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,987
- I said that, man.
- No, you never did say that.

1097
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,781
- You said Louie or some shit like that.
- All right, I said Larry.

1098
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,699
- I said...
- Where you been, man?

1099
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,343
Boom.

1100
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,016
Boom, boom.

1101
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:25,905
Thank you.

1102
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,034
Twenty-two up!

1103
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,744
I need a pinch of sugar

1104
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,033
<i>An ounce of ooh-la-la</i>

1105
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,876
<i>A sweet temptation
In my blue boudoir</i>

1106
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,132
<i>If you're feeling hungry</i>

1107
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,543
<i>I'll let you lick the spoon</i>

1108
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,709
<i>Come on over, baby</i>

1109
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,347
<i>Can I borrow a cup of trouble</i>

1110
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:48,849
<i>From you?</i>

1111
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,763
I'm just gonna get
some chairs, I'll be right back.

1112
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,727
Okay, I'll wait for you.

1113
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,861
I used to be fun.

1114
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:05,608
She chose me, I mean, well,
over Mr. Ladies' Man, Billy Gherson.

1115
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,868
That's how fun I was.

1116
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:12,953
Ahem. We both wanted her,
but she picked me.

1117
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:14,708
Picked me.

1118
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:19,045
And, uh, you know, once I...
I made her laugh so hard,

1119
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,582
she peed her pants.

1120
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,050
Yeah.

1121
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,969
I used to be able to make
women laugh like that.

1122
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,135
Come on. You made me laugh.

1123
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,974
Yeah, but I didn't make you
pee your pants.

1124
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,855
Well, give it time.

1125
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:43,062
Hey, I didn't know her, obviously,

1126
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,650
but she sounds like
the kind of woman

1127
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:48,238
that wouldn't want you spending
all your time being sad.

1128
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,529
- No, she wouldn't.
- So cut it out.

1129
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,872
It's enough already.

1130
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,117
- Just cut it out?
- Yeah.

1131
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,877
Really.

1132
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,250
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

1133
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:04,257
If I threw a party,
would you be able to come?

1134
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:06,923
I might.

1135
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,343
Might's good enough.

1136
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,852
I haven't been this hungover
in 30 years.

1137
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,934
Shh-shh-shh.

1138
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,187
- Everything's spinning.
- I know.

1139
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,193
- Oh, no, don't...
- Oh, hi.

1140
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,735
Guess I'll see you in the morning.

1141
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,906
Yeah, and it'll be great to see you.

1142
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:38,042
That's a good idea.
I mean, I got all my best friends here.

1143
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,918
You should have yours here
with you too.

1144
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,414
Uh, hey, honey?

1145
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,210
Let me call you back later, okay?
Yeah.

1146
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,513
Hey
Hey

1147
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,096
Excuse me, young lady?

1148
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,762
Bloody Mary, please. Extra bloody.

1149
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:05,227
Sophie wouldn't want me hanging
around the apartment in my bathrobe.

1150
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,861
<i>- No, she won...
- Shut up.</i>

1151
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,900
So I'm not gonna do that anymore,
and I'm having a Bloody Mary.

1152
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:14,946
I used to like Bloody Marys.
Maybe I'll like them again.

1153
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,541
I'm gonna ask you something.

1154
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,833
Do you love this Lisa girl
the way I loved Sophie?

1155
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,923
She's a wonderful person,
really great human being.

1156
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:37,013
Well, that's great. I'll vote for her
when she runs for Congress.

1157
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,887
Billy, you're gonna be 70 years old.

1158
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,851
Tomorrow you're marrying
a 31-year-old woman

1159
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,560
who you proposed to at a funeral.

1160
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,855
Now, I don't give
a flying crap about you,

1161
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:49,066
but if I did, I gotta tell you,
I see a few red flags.

1162
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,866
Tomorrow I'm gonna ask you again if
you love her. I expect a better answer.

1163
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,944
- He left his room.
- Ha, ha.

1164
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,032
- Hey.
- Hey.

1165
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,371
The old gang.

1166
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:03,877
We're throwing a party tonight.

1167
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,333
Yeah, that's the spirit. Yeah, a party.

1168
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,089
- Happy day!
- Excuse me.

1169
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,836
- Oh, crap.
- I, um...

1170
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:16,594
I just wanted to, uh, apologize
for, uh... For last night.

1171
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,009
Uh, I was way out of line, and, um,

1172
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:24,139
you know, I had too much to drink,
and I am just really, really sorry.

1173
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,604
I throw myself at your mercy.

1174
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,986
I was just downloading Dean
on who you guys were.

1175
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:34,491
He didn't know that you were
the heads of four very influential

1176
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,242
East Coast families.

1177
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,824
Yeah, I had... I had no idea.

1178
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,739
Well, I wouldn't expect
a dickhead like you

1179
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:43,500
to know about legends like us.

1180
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,706
- I... I'm a dickhead.
- Knuckles.

1181
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,088
Knuckles.

1182
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,794
Knuckles, get the guy
out of my sight.

1183
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,177
Yeah. You know, you're a dumb
little shit, you know that?

1184
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,059
- Oh, no, please.
- You don't know who these guys are?

1185
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:04,472
Archie Aces, Billy Bones,

1186
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,231
- Sammy the...
- The accountant.

1187
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,767
- Yeah, the accountant.
- Ugh.

1188
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:11,904
Sammy the Stove, they call me.
I cook the books.

1189
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,440
I'm just... I'm sorry.

1190
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,028
What do we care about your sorrys?

1191
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,990
No, I know, I know, I know.
I don't give a damn about my sorrys.

1192
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,529
Just please...

1193
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,039
Shut up, shut up.
Just go get us some ice water.

1194
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:25,792
When that's done, you come back,
you do some other things for us.

1195
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:28,579
Maybe Knuckles here
will let you wash his balls.

1196
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,045
Sorry, that was weird.

1197
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,553
- Four ice waters?
- Go.

1198
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,842
- What was that all about?
- I... You were great.

1199
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,806
I... Maybe I overdid it.

1200
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,141
I, uh, obviously misread you guys.

1201
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,900
You guys sold the shit out of that.

1202
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,527
So, what do you guys want me to do?

1203
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,530
Nothing.
No, today, you take the afternoon off,

1204
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,566
have another drink, go to the spa.

1205
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:00,155
Save your energy. It's gonna
be a big night for you tonight.

1206
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,528
You got some thinking to do.

1207
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,989
And we got some recruiting to do.

1208
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,578
Yeah. We need to recruit
some talent, gentlemen.

1209
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,915
Yeah, I want the A-list.
B... The double-D list.

1210
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,500
That is the A-list, actually.

1211
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:24,594
I like this one, although,
is she throwing up or crying'?

1212
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,136
Definitely throwing up.

1213
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:30,774
By 6.

1214
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,735
By 6?

1215
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:10,847
My turn.

1216
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:20,778
Yeah, now we're talking.

1217
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:33,999
Yeah.

1218
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,335
- These two, these two.
- Yeah, that... Yeah.

1219
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,720
There you go. Oh, here, here!

1220
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,300
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1221
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,633
Hi. Oh, thanks.

1222
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,143
Girls, you remember Sam, right?

1223
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,020
It's really gonna be great.
Party tonight.

1224
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,852
Yeah, thanks. Oh, thanks.

1225
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,608
If we were able to, I would release...

1226
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,522
I told you to put those
in one and two.

1227
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,361
Okay. Oh, no.

1228
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,151
- Take those back. I'm sorry.
- Where to?

1229
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,788
Here we go. Let's do it.
Wait, are you?

1230
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:29,643
So find yourself somebody

1231
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:34,272
<i>You gotta find yourself somebody</i>

1232
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:41,155
<i>You need to find yourself somebody</i>

1233
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:47,574
<i>To love</i>

1234
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:53,746
Wow. You guys just cannot
stay away from me.

1235
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,330
You wanna go someplace?

1236
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,746
Um, let me just check
with the crowd.

1237
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:00,753
Okay.

1238
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:05,095
When you sing, I feel like a teenager.

1239
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:07,802
And isn't that your whole goal in life?

1240
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,261
- Ha, ha.
- So sad.

1241
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:10,971
You're right.

1242
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,471
Can I ask you a personal question?

1243
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,476
Ay, Ay...

1244
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,937
Okay, one personal question.

1245
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,896
Why haven't you ever
gotten married until now'?

1246
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,472
Well, why should I?

1247
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,991
I get to do everything I want to do
whenever I want to.

1248
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,993
I mean, what's wrong with that?

1249
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,950
There's no mention of love?

1250
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,907
No, no, no, I'm...
I'm not the falling-in-love type.

1251
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:36,960
Okay.

1252
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:40,793
Truth is, there was only one girl
in my entire life

1253
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:43,208
that I fell in love with.

1254
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,876
I let her get away.

1255
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:46,886
Who was that?

1256
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:52,600
You shouldn't have used up
your one personal question.

1257
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:56,559
- Oh, you are holding on so tight.
- Ha, ha.

1258
01:06:56,721 --> 01:07:00,396
Oh, Mr. Big-Shot,
I know where I'm taking you.

1259
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:11,532
- Take a seat, please.
- You have got to be kidding.

1260
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,867
What's the matter, princess?
Scared of heights?

1261
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,998
Yes, the princess
is scared of heights.

1262
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,785
Well, I won't think less of you
if you throw up or cry.

1263
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:21,671
Actually, I might if you cry.
Please don't cry.

1264
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:24,503
- I won't cry.
- Billy,

1265
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,340
I think I have to ask you
one more personal question.

1266
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:28,503
Whoa!

1267
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,055
What?

1268
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,426
You're getting married tomorrow.

1269
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,345
What are you doing here with me?

1270
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,522
Well, you know
I'm getting married tomorrow.

1271
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:42,730
- What are you doing here with me'?
- Oh, see, I do have an answer.

1272
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,816
I...like you.

1273
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:49,324
I liked you from the moment
that I saw you.

1274
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,530
None of which matters
if you love Lisa.

1275
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:52,740
Do you?

1276
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,366
What's...? No, no. No, no.
Oh, no, no. No!

1277
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:02,288
No! No! No!

1278
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,426
I knew you would like it.

1279
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,762
Oh, yeah, no, I love it, I love it!
It's great.

1280
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,768
Oh, good, because it goes
up and down three more times.

1281
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,101
Oh, it... it's... What? Aah!

1282
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,525
For a minute there, I thought
you were trying to kill me.

1283
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,560
Well, you wouldn't answer
my personal questions,

1284
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:29,607
so I thought I needed to scare
the answers out of you.

1285
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:35,153
All right, well, Paddy and I, right?
When we were kids,

1286
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,539
we were in love with the same girl.

1287
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,079
Sophie.

1288
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:43,916
She's the one who got away?

1289
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:45,621
Yeah.

1290
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,383
First, you know,
it was just two best friends

1291
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,886
competing for the same girl,

1292
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:56,053
but as we got older,
it got a little more complicated.

1293
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:59,264
One day, Paddy told Sophie

1294
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:03,102
that she had to make a choice
between the two of us.

1295
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:07,777
That night,
Sophie came to my house.

1296
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,947
You know, she was confused.
She was young.

1297
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,699
So she picked you.

1298
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,201
Yeah.

1299
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,239
Yeah, she came and saw me first.

1300
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,787
But everybody knew
she belonged with Paddy.

1301
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:24,498
Everybody. So I told her.

1302
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:29,379
And then she went with Paddy.

1303
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,881
Does Paddy know?

1304
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,557
Oh, complicated.

1305
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,684
A little bit.

1306
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:49,728
You know, the boys are throwing
a party for me tonight.

1307
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,988
Yeah, I heard.

1308
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:57,152
Well, I would really love it
if you'd stop by.

1309
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,329
Complicated.

1310
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,290
A little bit.

1311
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,381
There they are. These are my...

1312
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:15,716
- Those are the kids.
- Uh-huh?

1313
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,131
And when they were younger.
And here are the grandkids.

1314
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:20,182
Your son's son, and who's...?

1315
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,218
- That...
- Oh, shame on you.

1316
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:23,728
You don't even know who they are.

1317
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,763
- Jason and, uh, Edith.
- Those are?

1318
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,433
- Those are grandchildren? Oh.
- Yes, yeah.

1319
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,897
The one with the bottle there,
she has a drinking problem.

1320
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,230
That's a binky. It looks like a goatee.

1321
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:35,444
It does.

1322
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:38,485
- I got it.
- Our first guests.

1323
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:42,121
Gentlemen, you have
definitely outdone yourselves.

1324
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,784
Yeah, I got a little something, uh,
for you, my best men.

1325
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,497
- Paddy.
- Aw, you shouldn't have.

1326
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:51,505
- Sam.
- Oh, you really shouldn't have.

1327
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,132
Archie.

1328
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,918
You should have.

1329
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:59,596
You asshole.

1330
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,052
I can't believe this is your last night
as a bachelor, Billy.

1331
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,641
You better brace yourself
for tomorrow.

1332
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,227
But tonight, we're gonna party
like it's 1959.

1333
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,313
- Yes!
- Yo, fellas?

1334
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,900
I'm Stacy.
Which one of you is Sam Harris?

1335
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,878
Hey! Come on in, guys.

1336
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,276
Thank you.

1337
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,231
Excuse me.

1338
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:57,776
Sam!

1339
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,033
- Sam!
- He doesn't know you.

1340
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:03,320
- Do I know you?
- Yes! Come on, you don't recognize

1341
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,740
- the Material Girl? Madonna?
- Ma... Maurice!

1342
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:08,874
- Yes.
- You look different.

1343
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,410
- Of course, of course.
- I'm sorry!

1344
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:13,955
- Sam, Sam, this is my wife Susan.
- Of course, you're Susan!

1345
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,670
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way, but

1346
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,677
you seem like such
a conventional married couple.

1347
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,429
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah, most people think that.

1348
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,635
But listen, don't get me wrong,

1349
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:26,642
everyone else I brought
is just a complete freak!

1350
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:30,138
- Have fun dancing.
- All right.

1351
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,772
Thanks for coming.

1352
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:33,020
- Mwah.
- Mwah. Yeah.

1353
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:36,527
Hey! Hey! You've got... That's a guy.

1354
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,858
Oh, there's a snake. It's a snake.

1355
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,294
Come on. I know you wanna dance.

1356
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:55,796
Yes, yes, but... But, see, I don't...

1357
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,832
I don't know this.

1358
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,376
Well, show me what you know.

1359
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,840
Well, I know some things.

1360
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:10,512
Everybody back up!
Back up! Give them some room!

1361
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:39,799
Child, phew!

1362
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,300
That was...

1363
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,673
May I have this dance?

1364
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:45,971
I got you, babe.

1365
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,924
Let it go, Archie!

1366
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:06,993
Hey, Lonnie!

1367
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,658
We got a situation. Um...

1368
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,618
- Listen. No, no, wait.
- No, I got it. Relax.

1369
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,783
- Let me explain to...
- Relax, relax.

1370
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,202
- Lonnie.
- Fifty.

1371
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:17,708
I thought you canceled.

1372
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,047
Shit changed, man.
I'm in the next room.

1373
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:21,924
- That's what's up?
- Think you can get them

1374
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,461
- to turn the music down?
- Heh, oh, no, man.

1375
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:26,971
Um, actually, these dudes
are kind of just getting started.

1376
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,882
- Think I could come in for a bit?
- No, it's a private party.

1377
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,596
- Come on...
- Needy. Watch him.

1378
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:33,181
- All right.
- Please, man!

1379
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:51,241
It's the bride-to-be!

1380
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:53,664
Oh, you're gonna
need this tomorrow.

1381
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,166
There you go.

1382
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:56,913
Maid of honor!

1383
01:14:57,076 --> 01:15:00,250
- Grandpa Lou!
- Hey!

1384
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:04,755
Thank you so much
for standing up for us at the club.

1385
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,636
That was so awesome of you.

1386
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:11,755
When you're from Brooklyn, uh,
not getting involved isn't an option.

1387
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,393
I am so tired of these young guys.

1388
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:17,180
They are so immature.

1389
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:24,153
Maybe I should spend some time
with a man of experience.

1390
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,694
Let me show you around.

1391
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,201
Here, let me. There you are.

1392
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,081
Pretty girl.

1393
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:45,757
Aces, I was just cleaning up
over here.

1394
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,964
Ah, put that stuff down.

1395
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,346
- Go have some fun, you've earned it.
- Really?

1396
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,630
- Really.
- Ah.

1397
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,424
Aces, thank you so much.

1398
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:54,888
Appreciate it.

1399
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,428
Oh, uh,

1400
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:58,767
- before you go, Dean...
- Uh-huh?

1401
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:01,182
Ask the girl to dance, don't tell her.

1402
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:04,648
Okay? Tell her how beautiful she is,

1403
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,608
not how sexy she looks to you.

1404
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:10,028
Tell her that from the time
she walked in here,

1405
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:12,444
you have not been able
to take your eyes off of her.

1406
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:15,621
- That's kind of true.
- Okay, then go for it.

1407
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:25,335
Definitely.

1408
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:30,923
I'll be damned.

1409
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:39,803
The heck?

1410
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:42,648
Hey, Pop! Pop!

1411
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:45,814
- Pop.
- Ezra.

1412
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:48,399
- What are you doing here?
- What the hell are you doing here?

1413
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:50,781
- I asked you first.
- We were terrified.

1414
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,942
You said you were going
on a church retreat.

1415
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,453
We called the church.
Do you know how scared we were?

1416
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,490
All right, I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't want to worry you about it.

1417
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:01,455
Well, we were worried.
You can't do this kind of stuff.

1418
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:02,994
You're not a kid anymore.

1419
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:06,413
You know, you're right.

1420
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,877
I am not a kid.

1421
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,259
I'm a grown man,
who just happened to go

1422
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,840
to one of his best friend's
bachelor parties.

1423
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:16,007
As a matter of fact, I shouldn't have
had to lie about it in the first place.

1424
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:18,676
- You could've had another episode.
- Let's call it what it is.

1425
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:20,891
It's a stroke, a mild stroke.

1426
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,977
And it won't recur as long as
I take the damn pills.

1427
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,393
If it does, I'll just die, then, won't I?

1428
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,311
Until then, Ezra...

1429
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,150
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

1430
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:33,065
Until then, I am not a feeble old man.

1431
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:35,280
I've got a lot of life left in me,

1432
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:38,116
and I'm gonna live it doing
the things that I like to do.

1433
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:41,203
One of them is dancing,
and the other one is having a drink.

1434
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:45,336
I've danced.
Now if you'd care to join me,

1435
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,542
I'd love to have a drink with my son.

1436
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,791
Heh, all right.

1437
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,004
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1438
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,760
Come on.

1439
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,755
It's, uh... It's...

1440
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,501
Wait a minute.

1441
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:05,018
Uh, where was I? Ah. Yes.

1442
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,558
- Which way?
- This way.

1443
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,026
This is, uh...
This is where it all happens.

1444
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:12,234
This was originally supposed to be
for a famous rock star.

1445
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:13,773
- Really?
- Uh... Uh, yeah.

1446
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,441
Fifty-Cent Piece. And, uh,

1447
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:18,361
he was going to, uh,
have a big deal here

1448
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:22,077
with, uh, his groupies
and wild parties,

1449
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,162
and the bed goes around, and it's...

1450
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:25,451
Now it's all going to waste.

1451
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:28,955
It doesn't have to.

1452
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,007
You don't think?

1453
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,677
- Good, good.
- Heh.

1454
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:43,682
You just wait for me one second.
I'm just gonna take a pill

1455
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,471
in the other room.

1456
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:57,737
Oh.

1457
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,410
I don't need a pill.

1458
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,539
You...

1459
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,496
Uh...

1460
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,215
Oh.

1461
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,047
I'm so glad I met you.

1462
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:22,513
Did I happen to mention
that I was married?

1463
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:25,019
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1464
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,430
That's kind of hot.

1465
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:28,643
Oh.

1466
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:31,434
- Heh.
- It is kind of hot, isn't it?

1467
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,194
Yeah.

1468
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,155
That's better. Hmm.

1469
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,195
Yeah.

1470
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:44,826
Mm.

1471
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:51,336
Mm.

1472
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,012
The thing is...

1473
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:05,555
- You don't want to have sex with me?
- Oh, oh, no, no, no, I do, I do.

1474
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:09,063
Oh, God, I want to have sex with you.
A lot of it.

1475
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:11,098
It would be...

1476
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,393
Oh, spectacular.

1477
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:17,154
It would be the most spectacular thing
that's happened to me in 25 years.

1478
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,735
Uh...

1479
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,025
Just_it... But...

1480
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:23,660
The thing is...

1481
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,399
Um...

1482
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,080
It's crazy.,

1483
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:34,748
But, uh, whenever something
spectacular happens to me,

1484
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:37,666
first thing I want to do
is tell my wife about it,

1485
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,631
and, uh,

1486
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:45,266
after 40 years of marriage, uh,
if I can't tell her about

1487
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:48,678
something wonderful
that happened to me,

1488
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:52,523
it sort of stops being wonderful.

1489
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,270
I understand.

1490
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,447
- It... It has something to do with...
- I mean, I get it, okay?

1491
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:03,325
- She has a way of putting things.
- Will you just stop talking? Heh.

1492
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:05,862
- What?
- Stop.

1493
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:12,042
I really hope that I get to marry
a guy like you one day.

1494
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,296
Heh. I'm gonna get dressed.

1495
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:23,296
You know, uh, a blowjob
wouldn't be out of the question.

1496
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,989
What a party, man, huh?

1497
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:43,319
Thank you, Paddy.

1498
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:46,076
Just a little thing the guys and I threw,
you know.

1499
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:57,371
What?

1500
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:59,961
What do you keep looking
at the front door for?

1501
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:01,880
It's Diana.

1502
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:05,672
I invited her to the party. I like her.

1503
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,301
That's okay, isn't it?

1504
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,011
I mean, you said Sophie
wouldn't want me

1505
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:12,018
to be miserable the rest
of my life, right? So...

1506
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:14,388
Right?

1507
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,355
No, listen, I got nothing
to go home to anymore.

1508
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:20,736
I got nothing, Billy.
I mean, it's an empty house

1509
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:23,443
with a bunch of photographs.
It's very depressing.

1510
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:27,086
She, at least, makes me feel
a little bit alive.

1511
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:31,034
And feeling a little bit alive is a lot
better than just waiting to die, right?

1512
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:33,290
Right?

1513
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,169
Are you...? Billy, what's...?

1514
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,915
Oh, my God.

1515
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:43,129
You like her.

1516
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,263
Susan, hi.

1517
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:56,806
Uh-oh. You're getting married.

1518
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,020
- But you're a widower.
- You said Sophie would

1519
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:00,685
want me to move on with my life.

1520
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:03,400
- That's right. Exactly.
- Well, you know, I was wrong.

1521
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:07,448
You asshole!

1522
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:09,110
Asshole! Whoo!

1523
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:13,906
You are so cool!

1524
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,158
Diana.

1525
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,122
We gotta talk.

1526
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:30,760
Hey, don't even think
about kissing me

1527
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:33,551
until you've talked to your fiancé.

1528
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:35,977
Paddy's gonna ask you out.

1529
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,643
That's why I want to get to you first.

1530
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:42,518
Diana, you know
he's completely alone.

1531
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,812
I just think you gotta
give him a chance.

1532
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,733
Okay.

1533
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:50,446
I thought...

1534
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,743
Well, that's completely
embarrassing.

1535
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:57,283
I guess I misunderstood.

1536
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:58,621
No, it's not like that.

1537
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,333
- No, it's not. It's not.
- Well, what is it?

1538
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:04,374
Are you just gifting me to him
like you did his wife?

1539
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,089
- It's not the same as that.
- Well, how is it different?

1540
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:09,720
His wife had a choice to make.
First she came to you.

1541
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,596
- You said, "No, choose him."
- Oh, stop it.

1542
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,177
- And so she did.
- Diana, stop...

1543
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,762
How's it different?

1544
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:19,972
That true?

1545
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:22,436
What she just said?

1546
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:35,537
Wow.

1547
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:45,518
Poof. Just like that, everything.

1548
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,469
Look, Paddy...

1549
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,426
Paddy.

1550
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:01,180
Oh, my God.

1551
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,064
I am so sorry.

1552
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:14,239
No, it's not your fault.
It's, you know...

1553
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,076
He's my best friend, you know?

1554
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:40,436
Ha-ha-ha.
- And these four guys...

1555
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,527
Paddy, you okay?

1556
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:58,949
Paddy, what's wrong?

1557
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:00,534
What happened?

1558
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:02,825
Paddy?

1559
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:24,660
We were kids, Paddy.

1560
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:28,957
You don't know women.

1561
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:30,871
What are you talking about?

1562
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:33,423
Look, Billy, you don't know women
the way I know them.

1563
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:35,880
You haven't shared
a full life with anyone.

1564
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:37,965
You don't know what that is.

1565
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:41,264
You can't tell a woman who to love.

1566
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:44,347
Especially Sophie. You can't do it.

1567
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:47,346
I know what I had with my WIFE, Billy.

1568
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:48,855
Thanks to you.

1569
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:52,735
So I'm gonna ask you one more time,
you miserable prick.

1570
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:54,019
One more time.

1571
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:57,360
Do you love this woman
you are about to marry?

1572
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,149
Billy!

1573
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:05,122
All right, here's the deal:
You end it, or I will.

1574
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,875
Hey, hey, you stay out of this, all right?
It has nothing to do with you.

1575
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:14,214
Hey, babe!

1576
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:17,547
- I owe you this one.
- Aah!

1577
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:25,851
Lisa, my name's Patrick Connors.
Although that imbecile in the pool there

1578
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:28,282
started calling me Paddy
when we were kids and it stuck.

1579
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:30,446
Oh, right. Paddy!
It's so great to finally meet you.

1580
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:32,616
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
- Billy's told me so much.

1581
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,125
Why did you throw him in the pool?

1582
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:36,152
Ah, that's just an old game
from the neighborhood.

1583
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,188
Listen, dear.
Can I tell you something?

1584
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:40,323
- Yeah.
- Fifty years ago,

1585
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:42,576
Billy did something for me

1586
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,613
that allowed me to marry
the only woman I ever loved.

1587
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:47,702
And now it's my chance
to return the favor.

1588
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:52,165
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- He's not in love with you.

1589
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:55,164
He likes you.
I know he likes you a whole lot,

1590
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:58,174
but he doesn't love you
like the way that he should.

1591
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,169
I can't let him marry you.

1592
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,838
He's my best friend.
I can't let him marry you.

1593
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:07,346
Billy?

1594
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:11,146
I guess we gotta talk, huh?

1595
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,520
What is he saying to her?

1596
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:17,857
That she's young,
got her whole life ahead of her.

1597
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:21,068
Trying as best he can
to let her down easy.

1598
01:29:21,231 --> 01:29:22,733
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your names.

1599
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:24,651
- Madison.
- Taylor.

1600
01:29:24,818 --> 01:29:26,195
Madison.

1601
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:30,832
How do you think
she's, uh, taking it'?

1602
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:36,834
Mixed emotions.

1603
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:41,009
- This blows.
- Yeah. Blows.

1604
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:47,382
This is gonna be one
sloppy, drunken weekend.

1605
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,017
Yeah. Uh, bye, Taylor.

1606
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,845
Bye, Madisons.

1607
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:15,414
Hey, uh, Billy?

1608
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:17,753
Yeah?

1609
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:20,624
I couldn't let you marry her.

1610
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:25,846
No, you did it right. You, uh...
Congratulations, a good job.

1611
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:30,930
- You mad?
- No. No, you were right.

1612
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,513
Because, you know,
if you're mad that's okay.

1613
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:37,523
No, Paddy. I... I'm old.

1614
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:39,685
You know?

1615
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:42,362
And without her, uh...

1616
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,739
I'm just scared of being old.

1617
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:51,951
We were 17, you know,
five minutes ago.

1618
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:55,287
It was just yesterday. I just don't know
where it all went, you know?

1619
01:30:56,618 --> 01:31:01,670
My brain cannot conceive
how old this body is.

1620
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:06,678
Our girl's gone, Pat.

1621
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,341
And I wasn't there at the funeral.

1622
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:13,594
And I'm so sorry about that.

1623
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:17,522
I let you down, man.

1624
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:21,560
And I couldn't bring myself
to say goodbye.

1625
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:27,150
Archie's got a stroke, and Sam, well,
he's gone to Florida.

1626
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:30,114
Man, it's just winding up
a little too fast.

1627
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:34,076
And I'm feeling old and alone.

1628
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,123
You have us.

1629
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:42,505
Yeah, Billy.

1630
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:45,133
God help you, you got us.

1631
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,067
And you got a hot little number
singing her heart out

1632
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:52,679
in some shithole across town,
you lucky son of a bitch.

1633
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:03,693
Man.

1634
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:09,282
<i>Only you</i>

1635
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:17,951
<i>Only you can make this
Change in me</i>

1636
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,203
<i>For it's true</i>

1637
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:26,462
<i>Oh, baby, you're my</i>

1638
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:30,136
<i>Destiny</i>

1639
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:34,762
<i>When you hold my hand</i>

1640
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:44,605
Is she sick?

1641
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,187
That's it?
You're not gonna finish?

1642
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:50,232
Shush. You got in for free.

1643
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:57,827
So how did she take it?

1644
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:01,118
Well, she's probably
in Malibu by now

1645
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:03,537
burning my house down, you know?

1646
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:06,252
It went as well as you could expect.

1647
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:09,254
Poor kid. Are those for me?

1648
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:11,465
Hmm? Oh.

1649
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:13,847
Actually, um, no.

1650
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,974
I'm sorry, um...

1651
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,060
Excuse me.

1652
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:23,519
On behalf of Binion's,
I'd like to apologize

1653
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:25,979
for the delay in the show, but, um...

1654
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:30,856
I'm really interested in the performer.

1655
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:35,701
She's the most amazing woman
I ever met,

1656
01:33:36,528 --> 01:33:41,159
and I just can't believe in two days
that she's, you know, inside my heart.

1657
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:46,163
But I don't want her to know,

1658
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,331
because, you know,
with gorgeous women,

1659
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:51,001
they like men
that like to play hard-to-get.

1660
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:53,879
True. Very true.

1661
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:56,594
Thank you.

1662
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:03,146
Okay, that worked.

1663
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:07,980
So you gonna kiss me now, or, um,

1664
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:10,896
you want to hear more about
how I'm falling for you'?

1665
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:14,365
Eye contact. You...

1666
01:34:14,941 --> 01:34:17,615
It doesn't mean anything
without eye contact.

1667
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:31,007
I'm looking at you, baby.

1668
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:34,586
Mm, uh-oh.

1669
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,609
All right, kid, we'll take it from here.

1670
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,980
Time you went and hung out
with some guys your own age.

1671
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,654
And here's a little something
for your troubles.

1672
01:34:57,984 --> 01:35:00,703
- Wow, you sure?
- No, I was just putting you on.

1673
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:03,536
- Of course I'm sure.
- You give the best advice.

1674
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:07,911
You breathe a word
about us to the feds,

1675
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:10,045
we will hunt you down.

1676
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:20,928
Uh, my lips are sealed,
Mr. Accountant.

1677
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,637
Let me get your bag.

1678
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,980
- Boys! What's up, fellas?
- Lonnie-boy!

1679
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,640
- Hey.
- All right, you ready to go?

1680
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,023
Packed? You got everything?

1681
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:31,938
Let me get this off my chest.

1682
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:34,945
I've hosted superstars,
I've hosted billionaires,

1683
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:37,448
I've hosted kings,
and they ain't got nothing...

1684
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:41,237
I said they have nothing
on the Flatbush Four, you hear me?

1685
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:43,245
Nothing. And I remember,

1686
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:46,374
I heard this beautiful quote.
It was, uh...

1687
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:52,039
"Ain't nothing in this world
that's deeper than loyalty and love,

1688
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,333
except for loyalty and love
between thugs."

1689
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,092
Fifty-Cent, man! Fifty!

1690
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:02,849
Hey, Lonnie, get a limo
for our buddy here and take him

1691
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,554
out to the airport to meet his friends.

1692
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,970
Thank you. Great party.

1693
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:09,489
- Let's go, wise guy, come on.
- Let's go.

1694
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:11,023
Okay, gentlemen.

1695
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:13,518
Who wants a drink?

1696
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:14,732
Drink?

1697
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:16,862
Oh, man, where the hell
did you find that?

1698
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:19,524
- Found it in the garbage.
- Crack that puppy open, buddy.

1699
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:20,988
It's about time.

1700
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:23,699
Ah, perfect, yeah. Okay.

1701
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:29,997
Okay, so, uh,

1702
01:36:30,576 --> 01:36:33,170
here's to being invincible.

1703
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:34,546
Invincible.

1704
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:37,922
- Invincible.
- Invincible.

1705
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:45,182
- Jeez.
- Terrible!

1706
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:47,014
- Water.
- I gotta go brush my teeth.

1707
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:50,434
It can't go bad. It's Scotch.

1708
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:52,064
It's not so bad.

1709
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:09,115
All right, Paddy,
I think you and I go in

1710
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:11,410
and... that way.

1711
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:13,203
Sam, you go in and that way.

1712
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,713
And I go that way.

1713
01:37:15,872 --> 01:37:17,715
- Okay.
- Okay.

1714
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:22,212
So, uh, hell of a weekend.

1715
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:24,597
Yeah. Yeah.

1716
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,599
- That's for sure. Heh.
- Heh.

1717
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:27,805
- You think?
- Yeah.

1718
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:29,435
Yeah, next year...

1719
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:31,850
Disney World.

1720
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:34,849
Myrtle Beach.

1721
01:37:35,016 --> 01:37:38,065
- Uh, Poconos.
- The Poconos.

1722
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:39,604
Yeah, that's supposed to be nice.

1723
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:41,819
- Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

1724
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:43,153
But it's gotta be summer.

1725
01:37:43,316 --> 01:37:45,990
Kayaking in Norway.

1726
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:48,826
Or the Orient Express.

1727
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:52,288
We could take a barge
through the canals of, uh...

1728
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:55,203
- France.
- France, Europe, Germany.

1729
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:58,249
You guys are the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1730
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:00,424
Yeah.

1731
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:01,835
I don't care how ugly you are.

1732
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:10,101
- Sixty years.
- Yeah.

1733
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,392
Yeah.

1734
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:24,111
Okay.

1735
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:26,775
Okay.

1736
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:31,873
- Okay.
- Okay.

1737
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:47,259
Hey! Wrong way.

1738
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:13,656
Oh. Hang on.

1739
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:18,245
- Hello?
- Archibald, I got some news.

1740
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:21,631
- Is it the prostate?
- No, man, it's not my prostate.

1741
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:24,212
What's it with you and always
about the prostate, you know?

1742
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:26,673
Wait a minute, let me patch in
the other guys, huh?

1743
01:39:26,836 --> 01:39:29,259
- I got that good cheese from France.
- Good.

1744
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:30,765
- Mm-hm.
- And a bottle of wine?

1745
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:32,220
Mm-hm.

1746
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:43,103
- Hello?
- Hey, Paddy, it's Billy and Archie.

1747
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:46,573
- Why is the phone ringing?
- Sam's not picking up.

1748
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:51,361
<i>So, guys, you ready for this?</i>

1749
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,577
Diana and I are gonna get married.

1750
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:58,539
- Oh, wow!
- She's making a huge mistake.

1751
01:39:58,701 --> 01:40:00,223
He says you're making
a huge mistake.

1752
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:02,459
Yeah, tell him I know.
I know, Paddy.

1753
01:40:02,622 --> 01:40:04,875
What about the five trips
to the toilet every night?

1754
01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:07,260
- I know it all.
- Congratulations.

1755
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:09,716
I'll call you later, we'll talk
about the details, okay?

1756
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:11,722
We're heading to a concert now
at the park.

1757
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:13,303
- Oh.
- Really? Is she attractive?

1758
01:40:13,883 --> 01:40:15,673
- She'll do.
- All right, guys, well,

1759
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,641
I gotta get my grandbaby
back inside.

1760
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:19,305
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

1761
01:40:19,472 --> 01:40:21,257
- Congratulations, partner.

1762
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:22,729

01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:38,700
Ah, how about that, eh?

01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,834
- Pretty amazing.
- Yeah.

1770
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,210
And no Viagra.

1771
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:43,580
- Or Dramamine.
- Ha, ha.

1772
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:45,464

1773
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:46,670
