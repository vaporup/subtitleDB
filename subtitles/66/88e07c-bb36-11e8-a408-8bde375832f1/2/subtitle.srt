1
00:00:00,854 --> 00:00:05,000
In the year 2000, is there anything on Professor Han?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's "Il Mare".

3
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:20,658
I can't accept...

4
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:27,529
either my father's death or my love for him.

5
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:44,112
Yeah, I'm back from the hospital.

6
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:48,886
I'm okay.

7
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:55,692
Did you put the book in the mailbox?

8
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,330
Okay. I'll go get it.

9
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:20,911
There are three things a person can't hide:

10
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:25,955
Coughing, poverty, and love.

11
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:35,765
The harder one tries to hide them,
the more they rise to the surface.

12
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:44,201
But there are times when you still want to hide them.

13
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:51,646
I just sit and cry,

14
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:55,418
and cry until I can't anymore.

15
00:03:57,657 --> 00:04:01,650
Love is a self-inflicted pain.

16
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:28,778
I hope you'll find peace within you.

17
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:35,325
Il Mare's warmth and comfort came from the love within.

18
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:43,192
Love comes to us in different ways,
but I believe there is only one love.

19
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:53,709
I hope your father's book helped you
to understand him better.

20
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:37,016
Hye-Gi!

21
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,780
Auntie!

22
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:45,293
- Have you been good, kiddo?
- Yes.

23
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:48,828
- Are you okay?
- Yes, how's dad?

24
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,629
He's at a seminar in Seoul.

25
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:13,684
Eun-Joo, everyone I loved
was always out of my reach,

26
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:19,661
and I think I ached for them.

27
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:28,002
I was seven when my father left me.

28
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:17,889
It's dinner time, Cola!

29
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:23,659
You like Mr. Fish?

30
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:41,504
I'll be right back. Be good now.

31
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:51,437
It's freezing...

32
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:18,169
Excuse me...

33
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:01,678
I saw you at the station tonight.

34
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:09,086
White sweater, black muffler, pretty hair...

35
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:15,359
Haven't heard from you in a while.

36
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:20,614
Il Mare can make you feel so alone.

37
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:24,160
I felt like that when I was there.

38
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,899
Sung-Hyun, wanna have some fun?

39
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:41,112
Go into a convenience store and grab a beer.

40
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:51,516
Drink it down...

41
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:56,060
Now, start running!

42
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:59,988
Go for a ride on the Viking.

43
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:03,702
The adrenaline rush is amazing!

44
00:13:21,553 --> 00:13:22,713
This is the moment!

45
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:15,532
It's my turn. Take a bus to Bomunri.

46
00:14:23,148 --> 00:14:27,448
Get off at Mulmok near the tree-lined boulevard.

47
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:30,580
Do you like to take walks?

48
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:42,064
It's a beautiful place to just walk alone
and think things through.

49
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:04,044
Just when you start to get tired,
you'll see a little cafe.

50
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:07,551
I go there to drink wine sometimes.

51
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,754
Do you like wine? I heard that
wine drinkers are lonely,

52
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:43,154
but it doesn't matter to me.

53
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:55,096
I reserved a bottle of wine to be opened
in the year 2000. How is it?

54
00:15:55,541 --> 00:16:00,911
Wine is supposed to get better with age.

55
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:08,953
I had a great time.

56
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:14,224
How about you?

57
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:25,433
I did too, but I felt a little sad coming back alone.

58
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:52,453
I'd really like to meet you, if it's okay with you.

59
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:04,567
Hey, Cola.

60
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:07,342
You really think we'll meet?

61
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:12,974
Can you come down to Cheju Island?

62
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:17,620
I'm going home next week.

63
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,024
Cola! Cola!

64
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:31,762
Cola, I'm going to meet Eun-Joo.

65
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:35,035
What'll we do in the meantime?

66
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:40,435
Are you looking at the photo?

67
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:45,775
The coral beach is where I want to live.

68
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:52,184
Once you see it, you'll want to build a house on it.

69
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:58,852
Oh, our rendezvous date is March 11, 2000,

70
00:17:59,264 --> 00:18:01,824
at 3 p.m. on the coral beach.

71
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:07,431
It's a Saturday.

72
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,407
Don't forget. I only have a week,

73
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:17,311
but you still have over two years to go.

74
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:21,450
Eun-Joo...

75
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:25,846
- Aren't you going to bed?
- I'll be right down. Good night.

76
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,550
Go to bed, dear.

77
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:07,020
- Can I help you?
- No, I was just...

78
00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:10,590
- Are you building a house here?
- Yes, we are.

79
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:16,598
- Will you be living in it?
- No, I'm here for the construction.

80
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:21,799
- Why do you ask?
- Just curious...

81
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:25,872
A friend of mine designed it.

82
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:34,176
Isn't it perfect for this beach?

83
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:40,118
He dedicated it to his true love.

84
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:41,216
I see.

85
00:20:45,797 --> 00:20:49,528
I gotta run. Good luck.

86
00:22:58,163 --> 00:23:00,028
I waited for you for a long time.

87
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:10,003
I know two years is a long time,
but I still hoped you would come.

88
00:23:11,943 --> 00:23:14,138
I guess I expected too much again.

89
00:23:15,814 --> 00:23:23,277
I know I shouldn't, because it
always leads to disappointment.

90
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:32,819
But everyone I care about is so far away.

91
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:39,629
What happened to you in those two years?

92
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:44,939
I hope it was just a slip of memory.

93
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:55,309
Why didn't I show up?

94
00:23:56,988 --> 00:23:58,956
I wouldn't forget a promise like that.

95
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:02,254
This is breathtaking.

96
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:34,324
Sung-Hyun's letters were little pieces of happiness.

97
00:24:36,061 --> 00:24:40,464
But still, there is this sense of emptiness.

98
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:44,794
Is it because of losing Ji-Hoon?

99
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:51,066
Or is it not being able to meet Sung-Hyun?

100
00:24:55,981 --> 00:25:01,044
There's a technical problem,
so let's take a 30 minute break.

101
00:25:03,188 --> 00:25:05,622
Let's get some coffee, my treat.

102
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:14,989
The more animation, the better.
It means more work for us.

103
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:18,464
And it's great that there are
many big projects in the works.

104
00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:19,501
That's true.

105
00:25:30,482 --> 00:25:33,315
- Sorry I'm late.
- I just got here too.

106
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:39,254
- Ji-Hoon, about our engagement...
- Yeah, let's do it this month.

107
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:40,625
Really?

108
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:43,756
How about two Wednesdays from now?

109
00:25:44,262 --> 00:25:45,092
Okay.

110
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:48,728
- But why do you want to rush this?
- I'm not rushing.

111
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:52,332
You're the one who's stalling.

112
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:59,939
Just be patient until my animation project's finished.

113
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:48,450
I thought I could forget him,

114
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:55,526
but when I heard his voice again,
everything felt the same as before.

115
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:07,204
I know he loves someone else,

116
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:15,776
but I can't help it.

117
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:26,481
Please help me stop him from leaving. I'm sorry..

118
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:32,493
I'm really sorry.

119
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:06,414
- Hi.
- Sorry I'm late.

120
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:12,194
- It's okay. Are you hungry?
- No, but it'll be dinner soon.

121
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:14,729
- What should we eat?
- Whatever you want.

122
00:30:16,034 --> 00:30:17,695
Was I just a stranger to you?

123
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:22,938
What do you want?

124
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,008
Let's go.

125
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:39,153
Am I only a meaningless, faceless stranger to you?

126
00:31:37,715 --> 00:31:46,885
Do you think it was a good idea to let him go?

127
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:57,264
Of course. True love comes from true independence.

128
00:32:01,205 --> 00:32:09,305
I want to believe it too. I want a career and love.

129
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:55,278
My happiest moments were opening my mail
under your Christmas lights.

130
00:34:13,638 --> 00:34:14,536
Eun-Joo.

131
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:22,673
It was really hard studying
out there alone.

132
00:34:24,615 --> 00:34:31,680
Your letters helped,
but I just got too tired and lonely,

133
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:37,294
and I wanted someone there.

134
00:34:40,565 --> 00:34:50,770
I'm sorry... We should have stayed together.

135
00:35:20,738 --> 00:35:24,435
Please help me stop him from leaving me.

136
00:35:26,344 --> 00:35:29,336
I'm sorry...

137
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:34,248
I'm really sorry.

138
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:45,480
I'll help you.

139
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:51,860
If you were in so much pain,
why didn't you tell me how you felt before?

140
00:36:53,264 --> 00:37:00,636
Do you remember your first letter?

141
00:37:01,906 --> 00:37:04,739
You wished me good fortune at Il Mare.

142
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:12,883
Knowing you has been a blessing.

143
00:37:24,662 --> 00:37:30,396
This time, I want to return this good fortune to you.

144
00:37:31,202 --> 00:37:33,534
Best wishes to you.

145
00:37:44,115 --> 00:37:53,353
Thank you for everything. Goodbye...

146
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,125
Excuse me. Where's the department of architecture?

147
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:06,596
- Over there.
- Thank you.

148
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:19,939
My Lord, you're the biggest whiner these days...

149
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:22,944
Well, life isn't fair.

150
00:38:37,168 --> 00:38:40,296
He dedicated it to his true love.

151
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:54,142
May I help you?

152
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,612
Sung-Hyun dedicated it to you, Eun-Joo.

153
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:19,140
It was a car accident.

154
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,877
Help me stop him from leaving me...

155
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,907
He was on his way to Youido to meet someone.

156
00:39:25,082 --> 00:39:27,846
The driver didn't see him.

157
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:07,056
It's that house over there.

158
00:41:03,147 --> 00:41:05,547
Please...

159
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:10,676
Please... hurry.

160
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:16,624
The letter has to reach him.

161
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:22,354
It's all my fault. Sung-Hyun, please don't go there.

162
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:24,931
Please...

163
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:51,360
Our last date was at a cafe called "Morning"...

164
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:58,000
in Youido on March 25, 1998.

165
00:42:00,704 --> 00:42:06,438
Cheer up. I'm not going away forever.

166
00:42:09,713 --> 00:42:11,271
I know, I just feel weird.

167
00:42:12,116 --> 00:42:16,712
I asked you to come with me.
It's not easy becoming a voice actor.

168
00:42:18,055 --> 00:42:21,081
Not many people pass the exam.

169
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:26,590
It's only three years... right?

170
00:42:29,566 --> 00:42:31,693
I just feel so uneasy.

171
00:44:31,855 --> 00:44:33,152
Please don't go.

172
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:38,724
Don't die.

173
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:43,723
I'm so sorry.

174
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:58,972
The fact that I don't show up two years from now...

175
00:44:59,817 --> 00:45:02,980
must mean that we weren't meant to be.

176
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:27,935
