Let's get going!

Il Mare

16
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:46,293
Hello? Yes, it's me.

17
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:52,099
I really love this place. I even named it.

18
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,473
Who designed it? It's quite extraordinary.

19
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:04,607
I see.

20
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:09,046
Thanks again for the furniture and the stereo.

21
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,191
I'll call again soon. Bye.

22
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:04,770
Hi, I just moved into...

23
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:13,344
Hi.

24
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:14,147
Hello.

25
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,617
How are you?

26
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:46,883
Is the water hot enough?

27
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:50,887
Wow, these fellas sure look good!

28
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,891
I put in sliced carrots and onions!

29
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,121
Get ready!

30
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:02,863
1, 2, 3... pull!!

31
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:08,165
- Help!
- We won! We won!

32
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,134
One more time.

33
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:13,475
Let's begin at "Merry Christmas".

34
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,911
- Get with it!
- Let's get it right.

35
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,982
Okay, here we go.

36
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,954
Merry Christmas.

37
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:49,503
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

38
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,041
Hi, I'm the previous tenant of your place.

39
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:57,673
I must ask you for a favor. I'm waiting for a letter.

40
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:05,355
If a letter arrives for me,
please forward it to the address below, okay?

41
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,524
Thanks.

42
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:14,299
Wishing you good fortune at Il Mare,
Kim Eun-Joo, Dec. 21, 1999.

43
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:23,642
P.S. The paw prints by the door
were there when I moved in.

44
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,408
I never got around to removing them.

45
00:09:27,113 --> 00:09:29,377
You'll get used to them.

46
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:40,790
Hello?

47
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:49,061
No, I was waiting for a call.

48
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:29,034
He's a jerk.

49
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,956
Merry Christmas...

50
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:22,951
Hi. Cigarettes, please.

51
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,521
Help yourself, they're over there.

52
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,928
What's that you wrote by your place?

53
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:34,671
"Il Mare". It means "the sea".

54
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:40,511
Sea? What do you know about the ocean?

55
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,872
I thought I'd start learning.

56
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:51,583
Did anyone live there before?

57
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,923
Nope. Your aunt finished building it last month.

58
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:59,429
It's a brand new place.

59
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,467
- Time for dinner!
- Okay.

60
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:46,969
Talk about a lousy disappearing act!

61
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,001
We brought your designs from school.

62
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:54,512
- Design, my ass.
- Want some tea?

63
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:12,456
I'm leaving today to study abroad.

64
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,494
I just dropped by to say goodbye.

65
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:23,636
I guess... you have to get going then.

66
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:31,547
Thanks... for everything.

67
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:34,450
Learn as much as you can out there.

68
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:39,184
I think I should learn how to mend hearts first.

69
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,593
Hye-Won, it's time to go. Let's get going.

70
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:51,626
Nice place. I'll come by again sometime.

71
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,836
Come on.

72
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:39,406
Hey!

73
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:42,881
Hey, you!

74
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:54,692
P.S. The paw prints by the door
were there when I moved in.

75
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,362
I never got around to removing them.

76
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:00,468
You'll get used to them.

77
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:23,621
- Hello.
- Hey, the girl from "almighty".

78
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:26,427
It's "Il Mare".

79
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,866
"Almighty", "Il Mare", same difference.

80
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:36,742
Has the place been sold?

81
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:40,205
Nope.

82
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:44,443
May I go see it?

83
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:48,146
The keys are over there.

84
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,651
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

85
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,220
- Honey, want some noodles?
- Add rice cakes too.

86
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:51,274
I thought I should write you.

87
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:53,902
I'm the first occupant of Il Mare,

88
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,580
and I think your letter came to me by mistake.

89
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,515
I know you're waiting for important mail,

90
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:02,982
so you may want to check the address again.

91
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:07,785
Sincerely, Han Sung-Hyun, Dec. 28, 1997

92
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:12,896
P.S. How did you know this place was called "Il Mare"?

93
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:29,947
I don't know how my letter got there,

94
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:36,681
but I hope you're not playing some game.

95
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:38,713
Please don't tamper with my mail.

96
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:42,950
Sincerely, Kim Eun-Joo, Dec. 29, 1999

97
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:49,900
P.S. I hope you're not really from 1997.

98
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:16,726
I know it's the last day of the millennium.

99
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:24,032
Of course I want to go, but I have to work...

100
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,234
I'll watch the shop for you.

101
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,240
Where should I meet you?

102
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,151
- I read 7 volumes.
- 2100 won, please. Thank you.

103
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:05,807
Let's countdown to the new millennium together.

104
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:15,251
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

105
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:21,322
4... 3... 2... 1!

106
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,629
Happy New Millennium!

107
00:22:31,997 --> 00:22:38,197
"Listen, your letters keep ending up in my mailbox."

108
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:42,200
"You should look for other ways to retrieve your mail."

109
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:46,077
"Sincerely, Han Sung-Hyun, Jan. 7, 1998."

110
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:55,887
"P.S. It is definitely 1998 right now."

111
00:22:57,089 --> 00:23:04,552
Eun-Joo, you're the voice actor.
I'm the comic book store owner.

112
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:09,365
I should be the one with the crazy stories.

113
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:17,974
I know, but it's so weird.

114
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:22,506
I read more comic books anyways!

115
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:27,308
1998?

116
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:33,849
- Hello?
- Eun-Joo, it's snowing!

117
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:39,889
You're right.

118
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:46,365
Remember 2 years ago? We caught the killer flu.

119
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:57,781
Yeah, but I'm from an island.
I just can't resist the snow.

120
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,578
You'll watch the store for me tomorrow, right?

121
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:05,652
- Sure.
- Oh, thank you!

122
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,692
Let's call it a day, guys!

123
00:24:56,742 --> 00:25:00,940
- Sung-Hyun, what are you waiting for?
- Coming!

124
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:09,186
Is the sky falling?

125
00:25:10,556 --> 00:25:13,286
I thought I'd cover up the control box.

126
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,221
- No snow forecasts for tonight.
- Let's get a couple of drinks.

127
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:17,392
Sounds good to me.

128
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:39,876
It's going to snow a lot from Jan. 9 in 1998.

129
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:46,252
If you're still in 1998, watch out for the flu.

130
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:52,620
There was a nasty virus going around.

131
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:08,637
Dear Eun-Joo, you were right, it snowed heavily on Jan. 9.

132
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:13,608
And despite your warning, I managed to catch the flu.

133
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:18,047
You must be psychic, because...

134
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:21,624
I can't believe you're living in the future.

135
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:25,490
Psychic? I told you to...

136
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,740
I still can't believe that you're living in 1998.

137
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:45,110
But I don't think you're joking either.

138
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:51,682
I wish I was psychic,
because then I could tell the future.

139
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:57,557
But please keep forwarding me my mail, okay?

140
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:11,098
- Let's go.
- I need to go somewhere.

141
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:13,767
- But tomorrow's the deadline.
- I'll do an all-nighter.

142
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:31,920
Why a construction site?

143
00:27:36,802 --> 00:27:39,430
- She was telling the truth.
- What?

144
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,339
- I wonder what she looks like?
- Who?

145
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,013
The girl who lives there.

146
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:53,274
Fool, who the hell lives on a construction site?

147
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:01,751
Sung-Hyun! Hey, man!

148
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:14,097
Hey, Cola. Look at the little fish eat.

149
00:28:24,316 --> 00:28:30,915
- I have one more question...
- Dog? You mean Cola.

150
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:38,424
You're the one who had him first,
so why did you leave him there?

151
00:28:39,164 --> 00:28:43,032
He was wandering around Il Mare when I found him.

152
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:45,001
He sleeps like a person, doesn't he?

153
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,138
Hey, you're Cola?

154
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:50,401
Hey, Cola!

155
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:04,948
There must be a wrinkle in time,

156
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:11,319
because he can't be in two places at one time.

157
00:29:12,464 --> 00:29:14,261
He should only be with one of us,

158
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:18,266
but I swear that he's with me now.

159
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,770
It's the mailbox, the mailbox!

160
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:43,483
I think you're right.

161
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,588
But I'm not a big on hair bands.
My hair's a little too short.

162
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:54,831
Well, maybe you should grow it.
It's a gift, after all.

163
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:08,064
- Oh, we're going on a picnic!
- Whoopee!

164
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:11,033
I'm so excited!

165
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:14,740
Let's go!

166
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:19,481
Wait, I forgot our picnic basket!

167
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:22,418
Do you have the key?

168
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:24,716
No!

169
00:32:26,057 --> 00:32:29,356
No one has the key!

170
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:33,855
Oh no! Don't leave your keys behind!

171
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:37,091
Yeah!

172
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:01,854
Whoopee...

173
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:32,080
Hello?

174
00:33:32,857 --> 00:33:33,881
"Hello?"

175
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:37,451
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

176
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:28,944
Hello.

177
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:35,643
- Hello? Who are you?
- I'm Mr. Worm.

178
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:39,416
Do you live here?

179
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:45,495
Sure. This is my home.

180
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:21,265
I thought love meant... eternal bliss.

181
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:29,769
Cooking sometimes helps.

182
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:35,135
If you want to cook spaghetti the right way,

183
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,075
throw the cooked noodles at the wall.

184
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:40,709
If they stick, it's just right.

185
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:17,981
Do you feel better?

186
00:36:26,998 --> 00:36:31,162
We're tormented because love goes on,

187
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:37,598
not because it goes away.

188
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:43,912
It's better to have loved and lost,
than never to have loved at all.

189
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:50,718
I hope you feel better, Eun-Joo.

190
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:20,175
Request for Academic Leave

191
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:51,334
You're an architect, not a construction worker.

192
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:58,276
Why leave with only one semester left?

193
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:05,479
I hate all the hypocrites who preach family values.

194
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:07,318
Well, you should talk.

195
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:12,494
That's why I'm leaving.

196
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,757
Geez, you've been acting weird lately.

197
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:34,474
I feel like I'm being ambushed
by memories I'd rather forget.

198
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:39,018
Do you have any memories
you'd prefer to abandon?

199
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:57,702
Hey, Cola. Doing laundry can be therapeutic.

200
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:05,775
Thanks for helping me move in.
I've tried to be a nice neighbor,

201
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:12,273
but please stop leaving chocolate
almonds in my mailbox.

202
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:20,057
The chocolate melts all over my mail.

203
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:25,825
Chocolate, cho-co-late...

204
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:32,792
The chocolate melts all over
my mail and I can't read it.

205
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:01,195
What would I want back from 1998?

206
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:08,332
My friend gave me a tape recorder
to practice voice acting and I lost it.

207
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,776
I looked in my diary and it was on Feb. 11.

208
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:16,941
I was at the station on my way home.

209
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,013
I always sat on the last bench on the south side.

210
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,815
I lost it that night.

211
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:33,353
Go there, and you'll see me in the year 1998.

212
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:39,921
"I love you... I LOVE you... I love YOU..."

213
00:43:59,283 --> 00:44:01,046
Hey, wait! Eun-Joo!

214
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:14,058
What are you doing?

215
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:15,698
Didn't you lose this?

216
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,735
Listen to this... "I love you..."

217
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,867
"Hi, Eun-Joo. It's me, Sung-Hyun."

218
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:32,572
- "I hope you received the recorder."
- Hey, who's this?

219
00:44:57,108 --> 00:45:00,566
Thank you for the recorder.

220
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:04,104
I'm sending you two gifts,

221
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:10,280
but one of them may not get there
because it's alive.

222
00:45:11,389 --> 00:45:16,326
The earmuffs are to keep you warm.

223
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:21,090
If you need a favor from me, let me know.

224
00:46:08,913 --> 00:46:11,040
Your aunt called me.

225
00:46:11,615 --> 00:46:18,919
I know it's not easy for you,
but she's like your mother,

226
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,853
and she really wants you to do this.

227
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:28,055
Please go visit Professor Han
at the hospital, in room 703.

228
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:41,972
In the year 2000, is there anything on Professor Han?
