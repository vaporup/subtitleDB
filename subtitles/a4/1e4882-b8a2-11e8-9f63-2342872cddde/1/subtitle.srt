1
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:20,309
Samsara

2
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:23,772
Sonam...

3
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,663
Oh no, not again!

4
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,630
How long?

5
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:20,001
Three years, three months,
three weeks and three days.

6
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,883
Tashi, we are taking you back.

7
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,655
Tashi, it is time.

8
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:06,014
Tashi, you pushed it too far.

9
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,683
''How can one prevent a drop of water
from ever drying up?''

10
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,898
Apo is back...

11
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:41,209
Kala!

12
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,672
Now, l must leave.

13
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:43,665
Safe return!

14
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:51,239
No. l want to go home!

15
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,889
Tashi, did you cry when,

16
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,882
...you father left you here?

17
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,601
The head lama,
His holiness Chen Tulku

18
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:46,594
...will be performing a
sacred initiation in five days.

19
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:54,102
He asks that you attend.

20
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,597
So prince Siddhartha
left his palace

21
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,845
and luxurious life...

22
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:10,682
...and from his golden chariot...

23
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,675
saw suffering for the first time!

24
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,451
Thus one night,
prince Siddhartha decided...

25
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,670
...to leave his beautiful wife,
Princess Yashodhara...

26
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,663
and his son, Rahul, and go away.

27
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,912
He left his son?

28
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,813
Well, yes.

29
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,806
Because he wanted to find out
true cause of our suffering and...

30
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:00,454
l want to go home!

31
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,852
Tashi, Rinpochey is here!

32
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:27,875
After twenty years studying
in our monastery...

33
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,581
...Lama Tashi completed
three years of meditation,

34
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:37,885
Truly this is the
path towards Nirvana.

35
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,779
His Holiness, Dhyan Rinpochey...

36
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,772
has therefore awarded Lama Tashi
the precious 'Khenpo' degree...

37
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,977
in recognition of his achievement.

38
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,448
He is a very good monk!

39
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,029
Kala, you monkey!

40
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,599
Tashi... You spoke!

41
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,592
lt was him.

42
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,772
Kala...hear my voice, what?

43
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:09,009
Rinpochey, thank you.
For Tashi...

44
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,891
Precious degree of Khenpo.

45
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,884
For Kala... nothing.

46
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:21,355
Jhulley! Tashi Delek!

47
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,805
Hail! Hail! Hail!

48
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:15,142
... to four noble truths!

49
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:49,670
- Who? -Tashi.

50
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,730
Faster, faster, faster...

51
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:20,094
Can you explain what's going on?

52
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,677
Apo, l ask that you take
Lama Tashi with you tomorrow

53
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,879
for the harvest ceremony.

54
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:31,872
l feel he is in need of
some fresh air.

55
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:42,827
Tashi, next time you wish to
modify a performance...

56
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,820
...please let me know in advance.

57
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,927
Where is Tenzin Thorgay's house?

58
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,230
Right There.

59
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,223
Come, l will take you there.

60
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,931
Tashi Delek, jhulley, welcome.

61
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,799
Oh Apo...

62
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:05,570
My head...

63
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,438
Last night l have...

64
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,142
Yes, l know.

65
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:15,135
Dreams are like that!

66
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:55,462
So Tashi still dreams?

67
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,990
You see, even you can be angry.

68
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,845
Here, the map. You leave at dawn.

69
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:44,838
lt is time to choose.

70
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:58,585
Kala!

71
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,853
What is it with you today?!

72
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,685
Kala... when did you
learn to read maps?!

73
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:44,150
Jhulley, Tashi Delek!

74
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,569
The venerable Khenpo Apo sent me...

75
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,537
No speech?

76
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:57,530
Understood, only body and mind!

77
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:51,097
''Everything you contact is a
place to practice the Way''

78
00:47:56,807 --> 00:48:00,800
Where's Apo?

79
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:39,639
Even He was allowed a worldly
existence until he was 29!

80
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:55,187
But since the age of five
l've been...

81
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,603
...disciplined to live like Buddha
after He renounced the world.

82
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:03,596
Why?

83
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,311
How do we know that
His Enlightenment...

84
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:11,304
...was not a direct result of
His worldly existence, too?

85
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,652
Apo, where is that freedom
promised to me...

86
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,955
...after a strict
monastic discipline?

87
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,023
Where is the promised satisfaction,

88
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:23,393
from our vow of celibacy?

89
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:27,397
''You should not accept
my teachings on hearsay...

90
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:31,390
...unless and until
you understand it...

91
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:35,494
...from your own point of view''
he said once.

92
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:45,304
There are things
we must unlearn...

93
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:50,710
...in order to learn them.

94
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:54,424
And there are things
we must own...

95
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:58,417
...in order to renounce them.

96
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:39,025
Tashi...

97
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:45,498
Your dream back in the village
wasn't a dream.

98
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:03,649
But...

99
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,564
Kala?

100
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,666
Kala.

101
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:40,003
Kala! lt's me!

102
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,996
Kala!

103
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:49,468
Kala.

104
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:31,009
For the rest we talk tomorrow.

105
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,643
Dolma, we have
another mouth to feed.

106
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,790
A nomad.

107
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,059
l told him he could work until
the harvest was done.

108
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,929
lt will reduce some of my work.

109
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,697
And of course...

110
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:18,690
...increase mine!

111
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:49,966
Sujata, here.

112
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,959
Oh mother, some more.

113
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,775
Pema.

114
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:02,768
Take some food over to that
new hardworking guy.

115
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:08,140
Tell him he can even
stop to eat it!

116
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:19,651
Enough, father!

117
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:07,810
Hey Mister! Take a little rest,

118
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:11,803
make a little break for lun...

119
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,211
Pema!

120
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,714
Pema... wait!

121
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:48,251
Do not tell me that you
did this for me...

122
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,554
No, l did it for myself as well.

123
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:55,547
But why? l am sorry
if this is my fault,

124
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,963
Shhh... Pema please.

125
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:03,956
Maybe l was wrong to do that
but l...

126
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:08,560
All l wanted to do was
comfort you for a moment.

127
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:15,100
And look now.

128
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:23,008
Are you sure that it was
all about a momentary comfort?

129
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:29,681
lf you are, then l will be gone
... before the sun rises.

130
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:32,722
From now on you will
go out wearing this!

131
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:36,715
Roaming here and there!

132
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:09,125
l gave you a job and this is
how you repay me?

133
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:13,118
You worthless...

134
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:16,365
Oh, it's you!? Forgive my violence!

135
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,434
No, no.

136
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:22,427
Why are you asking for forgiveness?

137
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:26,598
He WAS A LAMA!

138
01:08:34,609 --> 01:08:38,602
Pema, what are we going to do?

139
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:44,442
Your family has already accepted
my engagement with you.

140
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:53,017
l know. Should l wash your hair?

141
01:08:55,697 --> 01:08:59,690
l have nothing else but you.

142
01:09:01,603 --> 01:09:04,506
Astrologer will be here tomorrow.

143
01:09:04,506 --> 01:09:08,499
l let him decide my destiny.

144
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:22,213
Pema, but why the Astrologer?

145
01:10:24,519 --> 01:10:28,512
Planets indicate 1 0th would be an
auspicious date for the wedding.

146
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:33,050
So fix it for that day.

147
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:51,146
That's good. l am sorry.

148
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:54,082
But... the wedding is with whom?

149
01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:58,075
With whom? l think it was all
decided last night!

150
01:11:10,283 --> 01:11:14,276
Jamayang came to see me
and requested to come here...

151
01:11:14,621 --> 01:11:18,614
...and decide the wedding date
of Pema and Tashi.

152
01:11:41,348 --> 01:11:45,341
Why? Why did you do it?

153
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:49,879
Jamayang?

154
01:11:51,324 --> 01:11:54,928
Even if the decision was
in my favor...

155
01:11:54,928 --> 01:11:58,921
you wouldn't have married me,
anyway! Would you?

156
01:12:31,832 --> 01:12:35,825
Woman will dominate!

157
01:15:06,486 --> 01:15:10,479
Hey, stop, eat now!

158
01:15:14,494 --> 01:15:18,487
Cry when l tell you.

159
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:28,157
Something is wrong.

160
01:16:31,304 --> 01:16:35,297
- Who is he?
- My husband.

161
01:16:44,617 --> 01:16:47,087
What's going on?

162
01:16:47,087 --> 01:16:49,989
After all the years
we've worked together.

163
01:16:49,989 --> 01:16:53,982
Tenzin, you allow him to doubt me?

164
01:16:55,395 --> 01:16:59,388
Now you can cry, my son.

165
01:17:03,303 --> 01:17:06,239
You better start building
a new granary.

166
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:10,232
You're going to be needing a lot
of storage space from now on.

167
01:17:25,992 --> 01:17:29,985
Tashi, l feel we are satisfied
in what we get.

168
01:17:30,397 --> 01:17:33,333
Besides, you HAVE to sell it to him.

169
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:35,935
No one else comes to this valley!

170
01:17:35,935 --> 01:17:38,304
Let me take our harvest to town!

171
01:17:38,304 --> 01:17:40,673
l'll sell it all.

172
01:17:40,673 --> 01:17:44,666
We'll teach Dawa a lesson!

173
01:17:48,848 --> 01:17:50,817
And what makes you think,

174
01:17:50,817 --> 01:17:54,810
those city guys will buy from us?

175
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:36,229
What is that?

176
01:18:36,229 --> 01:18:40,222
For a safe journey.

177
01:19:20,406 --> 01:19:24,399
One man, five Rupees.

178
01:19:31,317 --> 01:19:35,310
Two men, ten Rupees.

179
01:20:34,881 --> 01:20:38,885
You see, even notes don't
fit in your purse!

180
01:20:38,885 --> 01:20:42,878
Wow, incredible!

181
01:20:43,957 --> 01:20:47,950
More than twice of what Dawa pays!

182
01:21:12,986 --> 01:21:15,922
Tashi, you are too much!

183
01:21:15,922 --> 01:21:17,223
Guess what?

184
01:21:17,223 --> 01:21:21,216
Now the bank-notes
fit into my purse!

185
01:21:43,049 --> 01:21:45,118
Your father has also
gone with Tashi!

186
01:21:45,118 --> 01:21:49,111
l know.

187
01:21:52,425 --> 01:21:56,418
You don't understand!
Why change traditional practice?

188
01:21:58,665 --> 01:22:02,135
Dawa buys everyone's crops
for years!

189
01:22:02,135 --> 01:22:06,128
lt is dangerous to oppose him.

190
01:22:08,207 --> 01:22:12,200
Jamayang. Fetch my mother!

191
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:16,672
Go, go...

192
01:22:53,386 --> 01:22:57,379
Now who would this be?

193
01:22:59,592 --> 01:23:02,662
lt's me!

194
01:23:02,662 --> 01:23:04,664
So it seems you've been to town?

195
01:23:04,664 --> 01:23:06,966
We've been working.

196
01:23:06,966 --> 01:23:10,536
l can see that.
Hiding your grain?

197
01:23:10,536 --> 01:23:12,371
That's easy.

198
01:23:12,371 --> 01:23:14,540
Hiding from me, that's harder.

199
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:18,010
You better remember that.

200
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,213
Besides, what did l tell you?

201
01:23:20,213 --> 01:23:24,206
He's ruining the whole valley!

202
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:27,553
Look at you!

203
01:23:27,553 --> 01:23:31,546
'Salley!'

204
01:23:41,768 --> 01:23:45,761
lt's Pema! The baby's coming!

205
01:23:50,476 --> 01:23:54,469
No! Women only!

206
01:24:03,322 --> 01:24:07,315
l see! A great soul is
already reborn here!

207
01:25:05,651 --> 01:25:08,454
What a beautiful boy.

208
01:25:08,454 --> 01:25:10,690
A great spirit has surely returned!

209
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:14,683
Maybe, you're a Tulku, Karma?

210
01:25:56,502 --> 01:25:59,939
So it's settled?

211
01:25:59,939 --> 01:26:03,309
The next is Sujata. Where...

212
01:26:03,309 --> 01:26:05,511
No! Keep all my money!

213
01:26:05,511 --> 01:26:08,180
Just keep passing it on to me!

214
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:09,615
Pema knows what to do.

215
01:26:09,615 --> 01:26:11,884
She always pays me
the day we leave.

216
01:26:11,884 --> 01:26:14,954
And how long has that been?

217
01:26:14,954 --> 01:26:18,357
l am nineteen.

218
01:26:18,357 --> 01:26:22,350
Figure out the rest!

219
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,798
Your money!

220
01:26:58,798 --> 01:27:01,934
l wish you a safe return.

221
01:27:01,934 --> 01:27:05,927
See you next year!

222
01:28:34,794 --> 01:28:38,787
Karma, that's very good.

223
01:28:55,648 --> 01:28:59,641
This wool is so heavy!

224
01:29:00,653 --> 01:29:04,646
Oh, you're still carrying it!

225
01:29:22,942 --> 01:29:26,345
- What's inside the momos, Apa?
- Meat.

226
01:29:26,345 --> 01:29:29,648
- Where does the meat come from?
- From a goat.

227
01:29:29,648 --> 01:29:32,084
Did you have to kill the goat
to take its meat?

228
01:29:32,084 --> 01:29:34,520
Yes.

229
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,821
But mother says...

230
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:38,457
...we shouldn't kill any creature,
not even an insect!

231
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:42,450
We didn't kill the goat.
Someone did it for us.

232
01:29:48,367 --> 01:29:51,403
Why someone else?

233
01:29:51,403 --> 01:29:54,607
Why didn't we kill the
goat ourselves, Apa?

234
01:29:54,607 --> 01:29:58,600
Less talking and more eating, Karma.

235
01:30:02,848 --> 01:30:04,950
Stop! Wear something warm.

236
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:08,943
- Let him go.
- But, it is freezing outside!

237
01:30:09,021 --> 01:30:12,925
Let him find that out.
No over-protection!

238
01:30:12,925 --> 01:30:16,918
lt is freezing!

239
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:41,843
So you see, it lS freezing outside!

240
01:33:19,044 --> 01:33:23,037
ls everything all right?

241
01:33:23,982 --> 01:33:27,753
lt's just the ...migrant workers.

242
01:33:27,753 --> 01:33:30,923
Maybe we don't need so many.

243
01:33:30,923 --> 01:33:34,916
l sometimes wonder if
we need them at all.

244
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:38,831
They cost so much money!

245
01:33:38,831 --> 01:33:42,824
l want you to tell me
what will happen to that stick.

246
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,410
lt will drown!

247
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:55,403
Suppose it doesn't.

248
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:05,213
lt will get stuck in the rocks!

249
01:34:06,859 --> 01:34:09,895
Suppose it doesn't get stuck?

250
01:34:09,895 --> 01:34:13,399
We don't really need
all these workers?

251
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:17,392
What is it you suddenly have
against our poor workers?

252
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:23,742
lt will stay in the water and rot!

253
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:24,810
No.

254
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:28,313
lt will get stuck
in the whirlpool...

255
01:34:28,313 --> 01:34:32,306
...or it can go down
with a waterfall and crash!

256
01:34:32,918 --> 01:34:36,911
Suppose even that doesn't happen.

257
01:34:37,256 --> 01:34:41,249
What then?

258
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:45,953
Do you give up?

259
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:52,093
The answer's simple.

260
01:34:52,371 --> 01:34:56,364
The stick will reach the sea!

261
01:35:16,428 --> 01:35:18,330
Jamayang, congratulations.

262
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:22,323
l heard, you are soon
going to be married.

263
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:29,408
By the way...

264
01:35:29,408 --> 01:35:33,401
...we're taking our harvest
into town.

265
01:35:34,046 --> 01:35:38,039
Don't you think it's time
you joined us?

266
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:41,153
l sell only to Dawa,
like l always have.

267
01:35:41,153 --> 01:35:42,421
Like my father did.

268
01:35:42,421 --> 01:35:46,414
But you know Dawa cheats you.

269
01:35:46,992 --> 01:35:48,293
After all these years...

270
01:35:48,293 --> 01:35:52,286
...you still don't know
how things work here, do you!

271
01:36:18,056 --> 01:36:22,049
We are back! And look!

272
01:36:32,971 --> 01:36:36,964
Apa! What did you do
when you were a boy?

273
01:36:38,777 --> 01:36:42,770
He always made his own toys!

274
01:37:25,157 --> 01:37:27,459
Jamayang...

275
01:37:27,459 --> 01:37:30,495
Please, you don't need him any more!

276
01:37:30,495 --> 01:37:34,488
Hey stop!

277
01:37:41,173 --> 01:37:45,166
l don't even know why
l bother with this valley.

278
01:37:47,512 --> 01:37:50,182
Jamayang, let him go. Listen...

279
01:37:50,182 --> 01:37:54,175
And prepare yourselves to
eat all what you grow!

280
01:37:56,021 --> 01:37:59,057
You can sell in the town with us.

281
01:37:59,057 --> 01:38:03,050
You chased him away.

282
01:38:04,463 --> 01:38:07,499
Everything you touch, you ruin!

283
01:38:07,499 --> 01:38:11,203
Dawa!

284
01:38:11,203 --> 01:38:13,605
Jamayang is hot-headed.

285
01:38:13,605 --> 01:38:17,542
He will calm down
once he is married.

286
01:38:17,542 --> 01:38:21,535
Let him go his own way.

287
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:42,267
Ama?

288
01:38:42,267 --> 01:38:45,437
Karma, stay outside please!

289
01:38:45,437 --> 01:38:49,430
Karma, you can come in.

290
01:40:27,372 --> 01:40:29,508
What's the matter with him?

291
01:40:29,508 --> 01:40:33,501
l told you we shouldn't
make love in front of him!

292
01:41:03,742 --> 01:41:07,735
Help!

293
01:42:57,422 --> 01:43:01,293
Apa says we saved
over half the crop!

294
01:43:01,293 --> 01:43:05,286
Everyone came to help us.

295
01:43:05,897 --> 01:43:09,890
The whole valley.

296
01:43:21,446 --> 01:43:24,516
lt's you, isn't it?

297
01:43:24,516 --> 01:43:27,786
Why would l do a thing like that?
You're insane.

298
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:28,920
lt wasn't me.

299
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,255
Then who, who?

300
01:43:30,255 --> 01:43:34,248
Try! Take a guess!

301
01:45:58,470 --> 01:46:02,463
You fool, why don't you try
asking your neighbours.

302
01:46:04,442 --> 01:46:08,435
You think l burnt your field?

303
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:12,973
No one does such a thing here.
Grow up!

304
01:46:20,825 --> 01:46:24,818
And you guys,
thank you for joining us.

305
01:46:25,363 --> 01:46:28,600
Now why don't you
stay for dinner too!

306
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:32,593
'Salley!'

307
01:47:54,986 --> 01:47:57,088
Are you sure you're old enough,

308
01:47:57,088 --> 01:47:58,623
...to do business in town?

309
01:47:58,623 --> 01:48:02,616
l'm a man now!

310
01:48:04,963 --> 01:48:08,956
For a safe journey.

311
01:48:32,890 --> 01:48:35,260
ls Pema in?

312
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:38,162
We leave...

313
01:48:38,162 --> 01:48:40,832
... my money?

314
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:44,825
Okay.

315
01:49:01,085 --> 01:49:04,722
How old are you?

316
01:49:04,722 --> 01:49:08,715
You ask me that every year!

317
01:50:31,342 --> 01:50:35,335
Careful, it is fragile.

318
01:51:48,152 --> 01:51:52,145
- l hear something!
- Don't move!

319
01:51:56,828 --> 01:52:00,821
- ...someone... -Oh!

320
01:52:19,417 --> 01:52:23,410
Hurry! Pema's coming!

321
01:52:25,857 --> 01:52:29,794
My Sari, you tore it!

322
01:52:29,794 --> 01:52:31,963
You must leave now.

323
01:52:31,963 --> 01:52:33,798
Hurry! Leave.

324
01:52:33,798 --> 01:52:37,001
What are you still doing here?
Pema's here.

325
01:52:37,001 --> 01:52:38,903
Keep calm.

326
01:52:38,903 --> 01:52:40,304
Why you're so worried.

327
01:52:40,304 --> 01:52:44,297
She told me this would happen!

328
01:53:15,907 --> 01:53:19,477
Look Apa, a pony just like yours!

329
01:53:19,477 --> 01:53:20,845
l made it myself!

330
01:53:20,845 --> 01:53:24,838
That's good.

331
01:53:27,251 --> 01:53:29,453
This is for you.

332
01:53:29,453 --> 01:53:31,155
Very nice. Thanks.

333
01:53:31,155 --> 01:53:32,990
Aren't you going to...

334
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:36,260
Later, l have some work.

335
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:40,253
... try it on?

336
01:54:47,498 --> 01:54:48,566
Tashi!

337
01:54:48,566 --> 01:54:52,559
Sonam!

338
01:55:08,019 --> 01:55:12,012
lt's about Apo?

339
01:55:12,957 --> 01:55:16,950
When Apo knew it was time...

340
01:55:21,165 --> 01:55:25,158
...he went to prepare himself
in the sacred cave.

341
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:32,232
He asked that l accompany him.

342
01:55:34,945 --> 01:55:38,938
We both meditated together
until ...

343
01:55:42,553 --> 01:55:46,546
He asked that l give you this.

344
01:56:11,282 --> 01:56:15,275
l realize now that my
task is not over...

345
01:56:17,354 --> 01:56:21,347
...and so l will be
returning to Samsara.

346
01:56:24,562 --> 01:56:28,555
l know that we shall meet again.

347
01:56:29,166 --> 01:56:31,736
Perhaps when we do...

348
01:56:31,736 --> 01:56:35,729
...you will be able to tell me
what is more important:-

349
01:56:37,341 --> 01:56:40,778
Satisfying one thousand desires

350
01:56:40,778 --> 01:56:44,771
... or conquering just one.

351
01:56:45,382 --> 01:56:49,375
Yours Apo.

352
01:58:10,234 --> 01:58:14,227
l've heard so much about
wild-weddings in your region!

353
01:58:17,341 --> 01:58:21,334
And for your marriage,
l should be there...

354
01:58:22,213 --> 01:58:26,206
...but you know
l can't leave the farm.

355
01:58:27,518 --> 01:58:31,422
lt feels so strange knowing...

356
01:58:31,422 --> 01:58:35,415
...l won't be coming back.

357
01:58:39,730 --> 01:58:43,723
Look after yourself.

358
02:04:52,102 --> 02:04:56,095
Yashodhara.

359
02:05:01,178 --> 02:05:03,914
Do you know that name?

360
02:05:03,914 --> 02:05:06,283
Prince Siddhartha, Gautama,

361
02:05:06,283 --> 02:05:09,786
Sakyamuni, Buddha.

362
02:05:09,786 --> 02:05:13,657
Everybody knows these names...

363
02:05:13,657 --> 02:05:15,959
... but...

364
02:05:15,959 --> 02:05:19,952
... Yashodhara?

365
02:05:29,072 --> 02:05:33,065
Yashodhara was married
to Siddhartha.

366
02:05:33,810 --> 02:05:37,714
She loved him dearly.

367
02:05:37,714 --> 02:05:40,651
One night Siddhartha left her

368
02:05:40,651 --> 02:05:43,153
and their son, Rahul ...

369
02:05:43,153 --> 02:05:47,146
... while they were sleeping,
to seek Enlightenment...

370
02:05:47,724 --> 02:05:51,717
... to become Buddha.

371
02:05:56,233 --> 02:06:00,226
He did not even say
a word to her when he left.

372
02:06:07,177 --> 02:06:11,170
Yashodhara has shown
compassion for the sick

373
02:06:12,082 --> 02:06:14,885
... and ailing long before
Siddhartha ever did...

374
02:06:14,885 --> 02:06:18,878
... long before Siddhartha
was even aware of suffering!

375
02:06:24,161 --> 02:06:28,154
Who can say if he owed
his Enlightenment to her?

376
02:06:30,967 --> 02:06:34,960
Pema ...

377
02:06:42,746 --> 02:06:45,916
Perhaps Yashodhara wanted

378
02:06:45,916 --> 02:06:49,909
to leave Siddhartha and Rahul.

379
02:06:57,094 --> 02:07:01,087
How can we ever know if Yashodhara

380
02:07:02,165 --> 02:07:05,068
fell victim to anger ...

381
02:07:05,068 --> 02:07:09,061
... to loneliness or bitterness...

382
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:13,833
... after Siddhartha left her.

383
02:07:25,155 --> 02:07:29,148
Who even thought about her?

384
02:07:46,443 --> 02:07:50,436
What must she have said
when Rahul, her son...

385
02:07:52,349 --> 02:07:56,342
...asked that eternal question:
Where is my father?

386
02:07:58,021 --> 02:08:02,014
What must she have told him?

387
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:19,865
How could a mother leave her own
child in the middle of the night?

388
02:08:21,711 --> 02:08:25,704
lt is only possible
for a man to do.

389
02:08:26,716 --> 02:08:30,709
Tashi, only for a man.

390
02:08:37,961 --> 02:08:41,954
After that,
Yashodhara had no choice.

391
02:08:42,966 --> 02:08:46,959
She had to lead a life
of renunciation.

392
02:08:51,741 --> 02:08:55,734
She cut off her hair ...

393
02:08:56,246 --> 02:09:00,239
... and lived like an ascetic.

394
02:09:24,407 --> 02:09:27,310
Oh Tashi ...

395
02:09:27,310 --> 02:09:31,303
lf your thoughts toward Dharma
were of the same intensity ...

396
02:09:32,048 --> 02:09:36,041
... as the love and passion
you have shown me...

397
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:40,924
... you would have become
a Buddha ...

398
02:09:40,924 --> 02:09:43,126
... in this very body ...

399
02:09:43,126 --> 02:09:47,119
... in this very life.

400
02:09:51,067 --> 02:09:55,060
Pema ...

401
02:09:55,305 --> 02:09:57,974
Forgive me.

402
02:09:57,974 --> 02:10:01,967
l am going back with you.
Back where l belong.

403
02:13:54,577 --> 02:13:58,570
''How can one prevent a drop of
water from ever drying up?''

404
02:14:16,533 --> 02:14:20,526
By throwing it into the sea ...

405
02:19:25,641 --> 02:19:29,634
The End
