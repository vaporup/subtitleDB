17
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,999
500 years had passed,
and still the country remained closed.

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,074
Cut off from the world,
knowing neither hope nor despair...

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,239
...the land breathed an air
of quiet stagnation.

20
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,236
Reformers driven to armed
rebellion...

21
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,710
...had been suppressed by the State.

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,913
The House of Takemikazuchi...

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,269
...were assassins hired
to suppress the rebels.

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,835
From ancient times...

25
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,273
...they had been guards to
the rulers of a neighboring kingdom.

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,035
That country, modernizing,
had overthrown its monarch.

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,472
Driven into exile,
they had reached this land.

28
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,593
Now they were a tribe of assassins...

29
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,199
...who would kill anyone
they were paid to.

30
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,398
The Takemikazuchi...

31
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,239
Mother...

32
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,957
Byakurai wants you.

33
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,951
Anka fled this morning.

34
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,872
He who flees the Takemikazuchi
is a traitor who will sell our secrets.

35
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,918
He's headed across Shikon Mountain.

36
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,673
But with his leg, he won't have
reached the old mine yet.

37
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,474
Yuki...

38
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,352
...take Kiri with you.

39
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,913
I'll go alone.

40
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,913
I'll go!

41
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,918
He'll slow me down.

42
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,959
Take me with you!
Byakurai told you to!

43
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,630
Could you really kill Anka?

44
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,639
Yes.

45
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,716
What if he begged?

46
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,749
I'd still kill him!

47
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,753
I don't think so.

48
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,438
Yuki... it's you...

49
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,790
I'm unarmed. Don't kill me.

50
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,516
Please...

51
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,672
Take my sword.

52
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,797
Tell them you killed me, OK?

53
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,076
- I see I'm no match for you any more, Yuki.
- Who are you?

54
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,518
My name is Kuka.
I served your mother.

55
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,399
I have something to tell you.

56
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,199
It's about who killed your mother.

57
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,477
You were told she died
in an attack...

58
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,911
...but it was Byakurai
who killed her.

59
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,239
- Liar!
- Byakurai killed your mother Azora...

60
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,153
...Princess Takemikazuchi.

61
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,991
You must either take revenge
and succeed to your mother's place...

62
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,878
...or leave.

63
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,230
Tomorrow you turn 20.

64
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,112
On that day a princess assumes
leadership of the Takemikazuchi.

65
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,036
You must choose either
to take over the House...

66
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,634
...or to leave it.

67
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,793
If you choose to leave,
come to the old mine.

68
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,198
I have delivered
the message of Azora.

69
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,676
Did Anka beg for his life?

70
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,115
Did my mother beg for hers?

71
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,472
What do you mean?

72
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,557
Your voice is shaking.

73
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,638
Your mind's racing.

74
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,514
Are you aware what you're doing?

75
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,231
Tell me.

76
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,556
Byakurai... did you kill my mother?

77
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,192
No.

78
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,957
Put up your sword, Yuki.
I'll overlook this.

79
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,038
I didn't want to tell you.

80
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,518
Your mother was killed because
she meant to betray us and flee.

81
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,238
Liar!

82
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,713
Lashing out won't help!

83
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,315
I have no choice. Die!

84
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,878
Wonderful news from
the Union Assembly.

85
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,634
Under our Great Leader,
we are winning the production war.

86
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,790
The Ministry of Consumption
reports...

87
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,313
...living standards have risen
20 per cent over the past year.

88
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,830
Celebrating this news the citizens
have come out into the streets...

89
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,560
...in a spontaneous parade.

90
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,632
Aya?

91
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,791
What is it?

92
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,791
Is this to kill me with?

93
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,151
You're a Takemikazuchi, aren't you.

94
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,912
Who hired you?

95
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,156
Talk.

96
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,117
Where are the others?

97
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,833
There's no one else coming.
I'm not here to kill you.

98
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,558
Liar.

99
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,270
You think I believe that?

100
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,879
Trust me.

101
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,398
Trust you?

102
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,879
You guys kill anyone you're paid to.

103
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,194
If I trust you I'll end up dead.

104
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,350
If I was after you...

105
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,956
...you'd be dead now.

106
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,673
Trust me?

107
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,514
- Doesn't that hurt?
- Yes...

108
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,116
...if you let it.

109
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,719
I saw a girl.

110
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,393
Where is she?

111
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,476
I'm alone here.

112
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,278
- That's my bed.
- Good night.

113
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,230
We lost her at the road
through the Forest Zone.

114
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,115
You came back to tell me that?

115
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,354
No.

116
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,435
Someone saw a truck.

117
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,108
We'll watch the road.

118
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,713
She'll be back.

119
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,476
She wants revenge.

120
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,196
- Someone told her.
- Who?

121
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,798
Hmm...

122
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,151
Yuki's 20 today.

123
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,954
Whoever told her about Azora
knew that, and what it means.

124
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,832
Kuka...

125
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,314
So you think she wants to kill you
to avenge Azora?

126
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,990
That means she'll come here.

127
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,072
If Kuka wanted to talk to Yuki,
where would he call her to?

128
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,037
To his home?

129
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,073
I'd find a better place than that.

130
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,079
How have you been?
It's Kidokoro.

131
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,917
I'm back. There's something
I want to talk to you about.

132
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,995
I'll come today.

133
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,678
No. I'll come to you...

134
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,756
...the day after tomorrow.

135
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,509
Roger.

136
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,550
I'll be waiting at the usual place.

137
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,758
A man had pledged with Azora,
heir to the House of Takemikazuchi.

138
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,356
He swore fealty to the House...

139
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,196
...but Byakurai framed him
as a traitor and killed him.

140
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,073
That man was my father?

141
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,075
You wouldn't remember.
You'd only just turned two.

142
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,112
There were still many
of Takemikazuchi blood.

143
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,269
Byakurai sought to
marry Azora himself...

144
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,313
...and make the House
of Takemikazuchi his.

145
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,271
But Azora refused.

146
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:31,594
Discouraged, she sought to bring
the Takemikazuchi to an end.

147
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,309
Byakurai found out and killed her.

148
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,115
Then everything changed.

149
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,749
Many were unhappy with Byakurai,
and tried to leave.

150
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,472
But only very few...

151
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,755
...managed to escape.

152
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,228
Princess Azora was killed here.

153
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,074
I'm sure she hoped you would
leave the Takemikazuchi.

154
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,275
She wanted you to succeed
where she had failed.

155
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,954
You need not take revenge on Byakurai.

156
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,875
The fate of the Takemikazuchi
is to disappear.

157
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,917
Princess Yuki...

158
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,113
Your mother had been tortured
almost to death...

159
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,079
...but the final blow came from me.

160
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,475
Kill me if you will.

161
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:26,676
My life since then has been one
of waiting for this day.

162
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,353
I offered to accompany
her to the next world...

163
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,397
...but she wouldn't allow it.

164
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,472
I was commanded
to tell you everything...

165
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,191
...when you reached 20 years of age.

166
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,397
If Princess Yuki were to do me
the honor of killing me...

167
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,596
Don't say that.

168
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,112
There's no point.

169
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,353
So it was you, Kuka...

170
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,438
Soma...

171
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,551
My, how you've grown!

172
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,076
By your leave...

173
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,598
Kuka!

174
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,672
This is what I wanted!

175
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,594
Princess Yuki! Don't die!

176
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,399
Kill me if you want...

177
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,233
...but don't raise your blades
against Princess Yuki!

178
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,472
That I can't promise.

179
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,038
Kuka!

180
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,913
When I was small...

181
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,751
...I was always happy.

182
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,596
I never dreamed...

183
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,749
...things would turn out like this.

184
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,997
You know why people thought
that way then?

185
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,838
It's because no one had any ideals.

186
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,194
Yes, people died when
we put a bomb in the Assembly.

187
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,952
But it was very effective.

188
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,838
You should be proud.

189
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,639
It was a holiday.
No one was supposed to be there.

190
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,030
You told me that.

191
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,152
Losses are inevitable.
You don't get something for nothing.

192
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,553
Mimura knew that.
His death wasn't wasted.

193
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,993
No one pays any attention
unless a few dozen citizens die.

194
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,592
I'd like to move on to the next
project.

195
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,039
Mr Sugimoto...

196
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,638
...didn't think so.

197
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,513
He called you while I was gone?

198
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,232
Last month.

199
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,235
He's been expelled.

200
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,590
I trust you.

201
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:53,195
We have to do whatever's necessary
to achieve our ideals.
