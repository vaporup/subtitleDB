1
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,278
Takashi...

2
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:13,555
...what's the safest place in the
jungle?

3
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,960
On the lion's back.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,789
The fleas there enjoy
the most peaceful life there is.

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,558
Hey...

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,513
Hey...

7
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,438
Hey!

8
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,111
Shit!

9
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,676
Where are you bleeding?

10
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,749
You need protein, or you won't heal.

11
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,312
Put these on.

12
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,509
That's all there is here.

13
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,997
Hurry up!

14
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,031
It suits you.

15
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,278
What are you doing?

16
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,031
Throwing these out.

17
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,951
You saw Mr Kidokoro?

18
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,031
You saw Mr Kidokoro?

19
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,636
Takashi... be careful of him.

20
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,038
Did you hear about Sugimoto?

21
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,357
Did you hear about Sugimoto?

22
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,752
He's dead.

23
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,358
Murdered.

24
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,830
I'm leaving this country.

25
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,751
There's happiness somewhere.
You just have to go there.

26
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,958
Who's that?

27
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,716
A guest.

28
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,471
A guest?

29
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,918
So you've found happiness?

30
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,113
Take care.

31
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,515
Call me if you want to come.

32
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,437
Thanks.

33
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,116
Why did you come back?

34
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,788
What's happened now?

35
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,158
Don't want to say?

36
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,109
It's probably safer for me
if I don't know.

37
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,750
Does it bother you to kill someone?

38
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,951
Why do you kill people?

39
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,239
For money?

40
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,913
My body moves.

41
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,835
When I hold my sword and close in
on a target, my body just moves...

42
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,794
...before I can think why.

43
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,149
Aw, you poor dear!

44
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,676
Some king stops paying his guards...

45
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,388
...so they put their skills
on the market.

46
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,955
You kill people for no reason.

47
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,716
Not to defend your country,
not to defend yourselves...

48
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,956
You have nothing to defend.
You just kill.

49
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,236
But I had...

50
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,996
...a reason.

51
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,471
I had a reason.

52
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,999
I'm sure I had...

53
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,991
...a reason to kill.

54
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,678
Come with me.

55
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,312
My sister.

56
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,589
When she was eight...

57
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:41,389
...I came home from school
to find blood everywhere...

58
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,076
...and just her alive.

59
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,309
The guys who did it were let off
for lack of evidence.

60
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,631
So I killed them myself.

61
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,750
I was caught, tried, and sentenced.

62
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,355
Four years later when I got out,
I couldn't see things...

63
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:19,398
...the way I had before.

64
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,671
Everything looked completely
different.

65
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,870
Then I met someone...

66
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,471
...who said he wanted me to be
as happy as I'd been before.

67
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,794
No one else said that.

68
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,278
I've done things,
and been pushed into doing things.

69
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,629
To get back to being happy,
I've rationalized everything.

70
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,317
Renkyo?

71
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,357
Yes.

72
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,034
I need to talk to you.

73
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,357
About what?

74
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,395
Can we really kill Yuki?

75
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,669
Without her, we have no leader
of Takemikazuchi blood.

76
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,590
- And then...
- Then what?

77
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,917
We've already lost just about
everyone of Takemikazuchi blood.

78
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,433
But what reason do we have to exist...

79
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,548
...without that name?
- We don't need a reason.

80
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,149
Now we have nothing left
to guard any more.

81
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:04,673
I venerated our ancestors,
I believed in the motherland.

82
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,028
But when the monarchy fell...

83
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,078
...our swords were taken from us.

84
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,038
Those who were caught had
their memories erased with drugs...

85
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,868
...and to slow their arms...

86
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,150
...needles driven into their elbows.

87
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,518
We fled, without turning our swords
on the motherland.

88
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,437
Remember, Renkyo?

89
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,952
Those tanks on that southern island
we saw as we went?

90
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,913
A group of ruined tanks...

91
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,873
...all eaten away by acid rain...

92
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,318
...and stinking of corpses.

93
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,555
But there were no corpses.

94
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,154
The stench was coming from us.

95
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,038
At that time...

96
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,111
...we were dead.

97
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,358
Hello?

98
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,355
- Hello?
- It's me.

99
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,357
Mr Kidokoro...

100
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,790
Why are you phoning?

101
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:43,750
I sent you a schematic.
Can you take a look at it?

102
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,478
Sure.

103
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,230
Be right back.

104
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:09,996
Did you see it?
I want to move in ten days.

105
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,192
Are you there?

106
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,077
Ten days...

107
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,357
I can't.

108
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,715
OK, when?

109
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,632
Never.

110
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,512
No?

111
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,637
No.

112
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,715
All right. I'll be in touch.

113
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,440
You always look so sad...

114
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,470
And you have no expression at all.
Have you ever been sad?

115
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,715
I make it go away. Just like pain.

116
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,878
And that's how you can kill people?

117
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:51,351
When you're sad you should grieve,
and when you're happy, celebrate.

118
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,270
Have you ever laughed?

119
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,836
When I'm sad I grieve.

120
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,511
For hours...

121
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,992
For days...

122
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,311
For years...

123
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,515
Have you ever heard of
a miki-ishi?

124
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,750
No.

125
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:16,634
It means 'beautiful precious stone'.

126
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,038
They're rare.

127
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,759
You can look all year
and be lucky to find even one.

128
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:39,796
When you grind it on a whetstone,
you get a little green crystal.

129
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,875
My mother collected them.

130
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,548
When she found one,
she'd carefully polish and save it.

131
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,113
When she had 30,
she was going to make a necklace...

132
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,115
...for my wedding day.

133
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,193
She said she'd put it around my neck
the day I got married.

134
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,757
She started collecting them at 18...

135
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,351
...had me at 22...

136
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,750
...and died at 27.

137
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,476
...and died at 27.

138
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,478
...in a little treasure box.

139
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,919
Not enough for a necklace.

140
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,115
Soon I'll pass the age
she was when she had me...

141
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,390
...and then her age when she died.

142
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:20,712
But I haven't collected anything
I could leave...

143
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,236
...to anyone.

144
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:41,515
I don't have anyone
to leave anything to.

145
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,471
There's no one...

146
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:01,238
...I feel like I want to treasure.

147
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,551
Let's leave here...

148
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,872
...leave this country.

149
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,232
There's nothing holding us here.

150
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,670
Somewhere there must be a place
we can forget everything.

151
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,238
Let's go there.

152
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:06,157
Mother...

153
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,837
...now...

154
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,717
...I'm happy.

155
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,951
You think you'll ever be happy?

156
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:30,152
Even if you kill me,
you still walk the path of blood.

157
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:34,827
You can't avoid it.

158
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:37,750
Mr Kidokoro...

159
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,076
Your sister looks well.

160
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,076
What do you want?

161
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,470
Oh...

162
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:01,193
If it's about that schematic...

163
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,869
No. I changed plans.

164
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:17,597
This one's a great idea.
I'm sure you'll like it.

165
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,749
What is it?

166
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,117
We find common ground
with the government.

167
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,548
We achieve our ideals,
and very few people get hurt.

168
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,708
What do you think, Takashi?
Good plan, huh?

169
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,237
You're selling me out?

170
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,954
It's a deal. We respect the law,
and our ideals are realized.

171
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,672
Traitor!

172
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,228
In spirit we will continue.

173
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,030
The plan I sent you was to be the
last.

174
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,679
Because we'd all be killed?

175
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,429
Don't talk like that!

176
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,355
Isn't that what you've wanted
all along anyway?

177
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,634
- But this way you're safe.
- I said it was a deal!

178
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,628
A fair deal.

179
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,675
So why did we do all that?

180
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,271
Why all those victims?!

181
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,717
It meant something. We all acted
because we believed in our ideals.

182
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,509
No. We believed in you!

183
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,748
No. We believed in you!

184
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,751
...Mimura blown up...

185
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,355
They all believed in you!

186
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,188
You said we'd be happy again.

187
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,795
You're the only one who did!

188
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,269
Happiness will come.

189
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,791
Of course it won't be free.
I told you the price would be high.

190
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,271
All we can do is pray for the victims.

191
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,355
But you don't have to pray, Takashi.

192
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,755
You're one of the victims
we'll be praying for.

193
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,117
You bastard!

194
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,751
I am Azora's daughter...

195
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,478
...Princess Yuki
of the Takemikazuchi.

196
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:23,358
In the name of my mother,
I take your life!

197
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,672
Don't you understand?

198
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,275
It's over! Get lost!

199
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,389
I'll keep this.

200
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,637
Live.

201
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:55,918
Be happy.

202
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,432
Live for me.

203
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,309
Takashi...

204
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,992
Takashi...
