1
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:49,985
David, are you in bed yet?

2
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,351
Um... Yeah, l am.

3
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,899
OK. Good night. l love you.

4
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:58,982
l love you too.

5
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:55,508
More news here
at your all-memories station

6
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:58,742
for St Petersburg and Tampa
at the top of the hour.

7
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:02,710
Now, l'd like to send out congratulations
to Thelma Miller of Orient Park.

8
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:06,579
She was our eighth caller yesterday,
and collected $225

9
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:09,981
on our big Money Memories Jackpot.
Today it could be you!

10
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:13,741
Oh, my. Look at this.

11
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:16,939
Here you go, Alma. Your little cart.

12
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,545
- What a mess.
- Load this for me, could you?

13
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:27,739
- Ex-Lax. You got my Ex-Lax?
- Heating pad. My heating pad.

14
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:30,981
There, Bernie. l hope you feel better.

15
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:34,427
- Don't use that stuff. Use prunes.
- l use both.

16
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:39,308
- That's everything.
- Rose, l think these must belong to you.

17
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:43,907
Oh, thank you. l'm Rose Lefkowitz.
l don't believe we've met.

18
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,186
- This is Ben, Rose.
- How do you do?

19
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:53,506
She remembers who l am, she remembers
who she is, so we're doing OK. Come on.

20
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:56,107
That's it.

21
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:58,864
Poor Rose. She's really slipping.

22
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:01,980
Here we go.

23
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:06,110
* And swing 'em to the left,
then you swing 'em to the right

24
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:09,149
* Then you do the twist with all of your might

25
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:12,348
* Truck on down, let's go to town

26
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:14,865
* And that's what we call dancin'!

27
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:18,466
- Let me hear it!
- * And that's what we call dancin'!

28
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,748
Hit it! Oh, that's much better.

29
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:24,061
Come on, ladies. Pick 'em up.

30
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:28,349
Oh. Very good. Girls, that's wonderful.

31
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:31,703
l saw this, but l fell asleep,
so l don't know how...

32
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,305
* Shake your little shoulders
and get on down

33
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:37,742
* Do the Suzy-Q that's good for you

34
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:40,470
* And that's what we call dancin'!

35
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:42,781
- Let me hear it!
- * That's what we call dancin'!

36
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:44,862
Hey, Art! Art!

37
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:50,262
Come on over here.
l could use some real men here.

38
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:52,826
lf we see any, we'll send them over.

39
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:55,662
Hit it.

40
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:59,349
Here we go.
* And swing 'em to the left...

41
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:03,267
- You gonna do anything about that one?
- Already have.

42
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,387
You put it to her?

43
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:08,462
You're disgusting.

44
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:11,427
So then you haven't, huh?

45
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,150
- What?
- l say, so then you haven't.

46
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:20,061
- There you go, Pops.
- Ben!

47
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:23,461
- l said one!
- Walk on the wild side.

48
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:27,227
- You boys still trespassing over there?
- Yup.

49
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,384
Hey, they're not even melted yet! Wow!

50
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:40,151
OK, let's get a board under him. Let's get a
pulse, let's get a blood pressure. l'll get a line.

51
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:42,222
- 80 over 50.
- Keep pumping.

52
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:44,825
- Ready!
- Clear!

53
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:49,666
ls there a pulse or a blood pressure?
Once more. Now! ls there a pulse?

54
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:51,184
- No pulse.
- Blood pressure?

55
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:53,580
- No blood pressure.
- Let's call it.

56
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:07,221
Well, what's the word?

57
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:09,620
What's the word on what?

58
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:12,783
The doctor. You went
to the doctor. What did he say?

59
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:15,305
lt's a breeze. Everything's fine.

60
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:18,303
Hey, wait a minute. Wait right there.

61
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:23,061
This is me you're talking to.

62
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:26,666
Now, you went to the goddamn doctor.
Now, what did he say?

63
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:31,626
Doctors don't know everything.

64
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:44,625
Well, there is the one school of thought
that says they don't know nothin'.

65
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:32,345
Well, gentlemen, mission accomplished.

66
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:39,461
- Hope the water isn't too cold.
- You want it heated too?

67
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:41,542
What about a lifeguard?

68
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,750
Well, the marines have landed.

69
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:52,582
Navy's in.

70
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:57,539
- Boy, that's cold.
- You're right.

71
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:04,862
Ah, fellas, this is the life.

72
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,943
That'll make your old ball-sack shrivel up.

73
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:31,185
Well, all in all, that was a pretty
damn crappy day at sea, wasn't it, boys?

74
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:34,786
- You stink.
- Me? Come on, man.

75
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:38,466
- lt's the great unknown out there.
- Here. Here's half your money.

76
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,746
Half? What's this ''half'?

77
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:43,299
Bonner, you got my goddamn money now?

78
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:46,349
l got it right here.
l'll be with you in a second, OK?

79
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:49,821
Cos if you ain't got it now,
you're not tyin' up here.

80
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:53,824
Look. l don't wanna get rough with you,
you know? But l'm not takin' half.

81
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:56,425
- Fine. Give it.
- Get your hands off!

82
00:08:56,511 --> 00:09:00,823
Just get your ass off my boat, man.
Get your ass off my boat. You believe this?

83
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:03,948
And take your embarrassing
beach towel with you.

84
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:06,667
Can you believe these tourists?

85
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:10,824
The guy throws up on the deck, he doesn't
catch one fish, gives me half my money.

86
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,948
- l need a brew. Want something cold?
- Untie the boat line.

87
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,147
No, wait! Don't untie the boat line.

88
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:20,543
Here you go, you bloodsucker.
l have nothing to live on. Nothing. Zip.

89
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:26,787
Oh, Kirk, come on. You're not actually
gonna take all my money, are you?

90
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:30,500
- You're gonna leave me $5, aren't you, Kirk?
- Not on your life.

91
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,222
Shit! Come on, Kirk.
That money'll bring you no pleasure.

92
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:36,302
- Could l have a word?
- l promise you!

93
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:39,906
- You just try and sleep tonight.
- l'll sleep like a baby.

94
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:42,702
Oh, shit!

95
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:53,946
We'd like to rent your boat.

96
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:56,465
- You what?
- We'd like to rent your boat.

97
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:00,701
We'd like to rent your boat. For 27 days.

98
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:03,826
lf that wouldn't be too long for you.

99
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:06,106
No. Yeah!

100
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,430
Yeah? 27?

101
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:13,700
That's my lucky number.
Holy sh... smokes!

102
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,544
Hi. Jack Bonner. How you doin'?

103
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:19,668
- Hi, Jack. l'm Walter.
- Hi, Walter. Well, come on.

104
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:27,143
Take a look around. Boat sleeps eight,
so you should be pretty comfortable.

105
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:30,348
lf you've got a latitude and a longitude,
l can get you there.

106
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:35,425
- lf you don't, l can still get you there.
- We know a great dive spot. We have a map.

107
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:38,341
Great. Great.

108
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:41,184
Uh... Guess we can talk price later.

109
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:46,582
Oh, that door basically
slides back and forth. lt may need some oil.

110
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:51,865
l haven't dusted in a while. But l'm gonna do
a whole cleanup, the whole sanitation thing.

111
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,341
lf you look at anything closely enough,
you're bound to find flaws.

112
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:59,709
l'm an experienced scuba diver
and tour guide, deep-sea fisherman...

113
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,988
Who will actually eat tonight! Yes!

114
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:13,069
ln the kitchen! You're in the kitchen.

115
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:18,110
And my mother went out on the porch,
and she was screaming...

116
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:22,548
- Give it a rest, Rose.
- ''You stop teasing your sister!''

117
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:25,546
- Hiya, Grandpa!
- Here's the little fella.

118
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:28,509
- Come right to the courts, do ya?
- lt's Thursday.

119
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:30,548
He knows our schedule.

120
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:33,940
- Hi!
- Here's David.

121
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,100
He's always here.
Does this kid have a home or what?

122
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:42,627
Bernie! His parents are divorced,
his mother works...

123
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:45,908
l'm an orphan.
Do l go around askin' for breaks?

124
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:50,699
We're goin' swimming later.
We have room left for one little boy.

125
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,464
And we might even have
a swimming suit for you.

126
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:58,181
- l got mine on.
- Oh, the navy could use men like you.

127
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:07,706
The property's been tied up
in an estate now for over three years.

128
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:12,581
And, of course, they really want to sell.
They're not interested in a long-term lease.

129
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:18,507
We'd just like the place for 26 days.
And we'll take it in as-is condition.

130
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:23,750
We're cousins.
We like to vacation together, informally.

131
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:27,187
As long as there's a swimming pool,
we have everything we need.

132
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:32,345
Uh, $7500 a month,
plus the pool man and utilities.

133
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:34,626
We won't be needing the pool man.

134
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:39,660
l prefer to do that myself. They use
so much chlorine. My eyes are very sensitive.

135
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:42,140
- Oh, but they're lovely.
- Thank you.

136
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,829
Clubhouse is closed, boys.

137
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:51,790
Well, maybe they'd give us
permission to use the pool.

138
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:56,149
- We could offer to pay something.
- Wouldn't be fun if we had permission.

139
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,550
Jack, this is the chart l was telling you about.

140
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:25,021
l estimate our position
is right about here. This point.

141
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:29,543
- l wanna get down right along this fault line.
- ls this land? What is this?

142
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:32,350
This is actually
an underwater-configuration map.

143
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:34,547
- A heat-sensitive map.
- l've seen these.

144
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:37,907
- Yeah, it's a brand-new development.
- The Japanese have this.

145
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,425
That's right, Jack. The Japanese developed it.

146
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:43,867
So the point is to head
directly south, right along this line,

147
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:46,943
until we get right here
on the edge of this fault line.

148
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:50,341
- You can figure that out?
- Yeah. Actually, l've been around here.

149
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:54,060
- Why don't you keep this?
- OK. Go get some sodas and sandwiches.

150
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:56,142
- Thanks, Jack.
- OK.

151
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:08,659
All right, let's start with line three.

152
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:12,265
- T-O-Z.
- And the next line.

153
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:14,902
L-P-E-O.

154
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:19,340
Try the next line.

155
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:27,951
K-O-C...

156
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:35,346
K-O-C-F-E.

157
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:41,470
Uh, sir, do you have another pair of glasses?

158
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:46,261
l don't need any other glasses, young man.
These are my glasses. l can read that fine.

159
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:49,468
Now you just run the pointer, all right?

160
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,985
Next line.

161
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:02,027
- ls there anything on that line you can read?
- No.

162
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:06,540
But, young man, remember,
road signs aren't made that small.

163
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:09,191
l can read road signs.

164
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,910
OK.

165
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:20,821
l don't think it's fair. l've driven everything
on wheels all my life and never had a mishap.

166
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,261
Shit. How's your girlfriend?

167
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:33,310
She's not my girlfriend.
She just followed me home that one day.

168
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,700
l don't like her at all.

169
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,588
You don't, huh?

170
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:40,142
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

171
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,347
Hi, Mom.

172
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:44,501
- Wanna go out to dinner?
- Yeah!

173
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:47,663
No ltalian food. Makes me fart.

174
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:50,060
OK. l'll go get Mom.

175
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:54,384
You know, you're gonna have to make
a friend your own age one of these days.

176
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:58,305
l don't like the kids my age.
l like to hang around you guys.

177
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:02,430
Sure you like it here.
There's no pressure, and we baby ya.

178
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,505
- More things bother me than other guys.
- Oh, they do, do they?

179
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,630
Trouble with you is, you think too much,
and that's when a guy gets scared.

180
00:16:10,711 --> 00:16:15,785
You know, Grandpa, you're right.
l do get scared a lot.

181
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,226
Nobody likes bein' scared.

182
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:45,864
Watch out. Those dolphins look pretty horny.

183
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:05,503
- This is pretty big.
- Yeah, pretty big.

184
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:09,946
- You need a hand?
- No. No, thanks, Jack. We're doing fine.

185
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:12,022
Excuse me.

186
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:22,667
- What the hell is that?
- Who cares?

187
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:27,779
You know, l bet they're dope peddlers.
l bet they made a pick-up out at sea.

188
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:31,550
- lt's possible.
- Should we tell somebody?

189
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:33,622
Huh! No!

190
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:42,661
By golly, if our new neighbours do that,

191
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:46,790
l don't feel bad about sneakin' in
their swimming pool while they're gone.

192
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:49,749
- You think it's safe?
- What are they gonna do, arrest us?

193
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:54,905
- Look at us. We're three harmless old men.
- Who knows what kind of people they are?

194
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,780
You know, l can't remember
the last time l really took a risk.

195
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:08,222
Ben's right. l'm in.

196
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:12,542
What the hell?

197
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:23,019
Look at that.

198
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:27,590
The water's really warm.

199
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:29,662
What the hell are those?

200
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:37,588
Listen to that!

201
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:49,224
They make me nervous.

202
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:57,707
lf Ben Luckett decides to jump off the Empire
State Building, do you have to do it too?

203
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,544
l have my pride.

204
00:20:17,111 --> 00:20:19,261
- l feel great.
- Me too.

205
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:22,462
You wouldn't bullshit me?

206
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:25,542
My God, l'm telling the truth!

207
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:30,308
Why shouldn't he feel good?
l feel tremendous!

208
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:32,905
l'm ready to take on the world!

209
00:21:32,431 --> 00:21:35,503
* l'm in the mood for love

210
00:21:35,991 --> 00:21:39,825
* Simply because you're near me

211
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:47,345
You get a load of this guy? He'll be
chasin' them dolls till his dick rots off.

212
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,626
l'm too old for that kind of thing.

213
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:52,430
- Ah, hey, age isn't everything.
- No, no.

214
00:21:52,831 --> 00:21:55,026
- Anyway, it's all up here.
- Oh, sure. Sure.

215
00:21:55,111 --> 00:21:58,626
lt's not all up there, pal.
Some of it's down here.

216
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:01,589
Which, by the way, is hard as a rock.

217
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:06,870
- You too? You got a boner too?
- Blue steel. Cat couldn't scratch it.

218
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,067
l thought l was the only one.

219
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:15,267
* We're in the mood for love

220
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:18,263
* Simply because we've got one

221
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,666
You tired?

222
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:39,628
Aren't you?

223
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:42,826
l'm wide awake.

224
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:46,588
- What's wrong?
- Not a thing.

225
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:29,061
Art! lt's so late.

226
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:33,101
Are you all right?

227
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:35,546
* Some enchanted evening

228
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:38,910
* You may see a stranger

229
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:42,582
* You may see a stranger

230
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,583
* Across a crowded room

231
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:07,823
- Want a piece of candy, little girl?
- Ben!

232
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,708
Ben!

233
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:23,302
Pung.

234
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:26,222
Three. Ghost Dragon.

235
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:32,506
Why is everybody so quiet today?

236
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:35,185
You're all off in another world, or something.

237
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:37,341
l was just thinking to myself.

238
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:40,862
Me too. l was just thinking.

239
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:47,222
l feel so nice today, l can't tell you.

240
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:12,706
Joe?

241
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,782
Let's go!

242
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:19,862
- Morning!
- Morning.

243
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:27,062
Excuse me.

244
00:25:30,511 --> 00:25:33,867
- Do you think there's cocaine in that pool?
- Might be.

245
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:44,021
- What if we OD?
- Well, we'll keep an eye on each other.

246
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:47,511
l'll watch him, you watch him, you watch me.

247
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:49,582
Perfect.

248
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:29,141
Hey.

249
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:33,304
Hi. Looks like you got
these things pretty well covered.

250
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:35,780
Looks airtight.

251
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:38,544
Jack, l can't tell you what's inside there.

252
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:45,069
You know, l'm the captain.

253
00:27:45,591 --> 00:27:49,345
Technically speaking,
l have to know what's in there.

254
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:52,229
Yeah, but what we're doing
is supposed to be a secret.

255
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:54,506
Kitty, l took a maritime oath.

256
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:59,460
A maritime oath! lt forbids me
to even reveal your names to anybody.

257
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:04,864
All right, l'll tell you. But you can't let
the others know that l told you anything.

258
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:09,342
They'd have to torture me.
Not a lot of torture, you know, but some.

259
00:28:12,431 --> 00:28:14,945
Nerita peleronta.

260
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:17,591
- Ner... what?
- Nerita peleronta.

261
00:28:19,151 --> 00:28:22,427
- What is that?
- They're giant snail shells.

262
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:31,266
They're extremely rare. We're taking them
to the Museum of lchthyology in Orlando.

263
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:34,502
Oh, really?
Yeah, l've been planning to go there.

264
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:36,661
l hear it's a great place. A lot of fish.

265
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:43,869
Oh, God. Oh, God,
l think it's broken. Goddamn it!

266
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:46,749
- Let me help you.
- Some ice. Get something cold on it.

267
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:48,822
- Let me look.
- Do not touch it.

268
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:51,300
- l can help you.
- No, no, no, no!

269
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:01,746
That feels nice.

270
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:08,022
That's amazing.

271
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:13,427
- Kitty, you married?
- No.

272
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:15,866
- lnvolved?
- No.

273
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:18,021
Come on.

274
00:29:18,111 --> 00:29:20,386
Those guys are so good-lookin'.

275
00:29:20,471 --> 00:29:25,750
Not Walter, maybe, but... You don't have
anything goin' with one of the young guys?

276
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,425
l'm not involved with anyone.

277
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:30,342
OK.

278
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:34,061
You know, we could go out
and do something, sometime.

279
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:38,504
- l don't know if that's such a good idea.
- Why?

280
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:43,750
- l'm not like the other women you've known.
- That's good news.

281
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:52,350
You're makin' me very curious about you.

282
00:29:52,431 --> 00:29:55,867
Well, what if l trusted you
with something very private?

283
00:29:55,951 --> 00:30:00,069
Oh, l can keep a secret. l wouldn't
tell anybody. Not even our kids.

284
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:07,222
Look, l don't know what you're thinkin'.

285
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:14,945
But if you're thinkin' that
l'm just out to nail you, that's not it at all.

286
00:30:15,031 --> 00:30:18,103
l'd just like to get to know you,
as a human being.

287
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:25,870
OK. l'll see you in the morning, all right?

288
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:28,022
What?

289
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,822
Yeah, l got some things to do too.

290
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:43,227
They didn't give you any other
medication at all over at the home, huh?

291
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:45,381
Not a thing, Doc.

292
00:30:45,471 --> 00:30:51,944
Well, Joe, l gotta tell you, l have never seen
anything like this before in my life! lt's a...

293
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,627
Well, it's a miracle! lt's a complete remission.

294
00:30:59,431 --> 00:31:01,945
l just love to see you eat your words, Doc.

295
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,062
- Want to arm wrestle?
- No!

296
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:08,382
How about that?!

297
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:38,868
- Alma's not gonna believe this.
- You've got 'em? Ah!

298
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:41,102
Come on. Let's go, shall we?

299
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,823
l'm gonna go ahead and assume goodwill.

300
00:32:02,911 --> 00:32:05,345
l'm gonna assume mental illness.

301
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:08,707
Oh, Bernie. l didn't expect it.
lt's such a surprise!

302
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:12,750
- l don't know how to do it. l didn't buy it.
- lt's just beautiful.

303
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:21,981
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
We start our second session of dancing now.

304
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:26,861
Our first tune is a special
arrangement of ''Dancing in the Dark''.

305
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:28,942
Let's waste no time.

306
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:06,349
- Why don't we dance?
- What? Oh, sure!

307
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:27,789
Oh, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie,
what am l going to do with you?

308
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:30,624
l don't know what l'm going to do with you.

309
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:34,989
- Well, you're not gonna dance with me.
- That's for sure. That's for sure.

310
00:33:37,911 --> 00:33:40,061
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

311
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:47,063
- You're a wonderful dancer.
- l think so!

312
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:50,182
l'm very happy, Bess.

313
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:53,830
Everything's happening so fast.

314
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:58,382
- Are you talking about last night?
- No, no. Last night was fine.

315
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:00,462
Fine?

316
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:02,621
More than fine! Terrific!

317
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:06,140
l was talking in general.

318
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:10,941
Well, in general,
l think we're having a great time!

319
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,342
Yes, we are.

320
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:18,425
Will you still love me
when l can't keep up with you?

321
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:21,947
Of course. l love you now,
and you can't keep up with me.

322
00:34:22,031 --> 00:34:24,022
You are a pain in the ass!

323
00:34:38,591 --> 00:34:42,664
''There's gonna be a problem
in the fuel-injection system if...''

324
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:45,062
What does this do?

325
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:18,981
Reduced to a goddamn
Peeping Tom now, Bonner?

326
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:21,062
lt's embarrassing.

327
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:24,460
Holy shit!

328
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:44,823
Look...

329
00:36:45,431 --> 00:36:47,581
What's the problem, Jack?

330
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:49,468
She's not normal.

331
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:54,701
There's something very abnormal about her.

332
00:37:00,111 --> 00:37:02,306
Come on, come on, come on...

333
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:06,750
Son of a bitch.

334
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,790
Come on. Start! Go! Come on!

335
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:25,343
l've had all kinds of people on this boat.
All kinds! From all races! Come on...

336
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:27,706
All nationalities! All creeds!

337
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:32,022
Oh, my God, l can't believe it! lt won't start!

338
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:40,381
Oh, my God.

339
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:58,427
lt's... lt's hard to know who to trust.
lsn't it, Jack?

340
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:03,342
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, God!

341
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:20,229
l'm in the water, far from shore.

342
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:23,341
lt's at night.

343
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,945
They got my boat. Shit.

344
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,029
Oh, my God!

345
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,069
Good to see you again, Jack.
Let me give you a hand.

346
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:41,268
l don't want your hand. Get back! Get back!

347
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:43,660
You get back!

348
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:51,869
Oh, no. Just put the towel down.

349
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:55,300
Just put it down and back away, please.

350
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:02,584
l'm sure you're bothered
by what you saw, but relax...

351
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:05,060
- l don't wanna relax!
- Why not let us explain?

352
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:07,585
Cos l don't wanna know anything.

353
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:10,663
And if you try to eat my face off,
or take over my body,

354
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:14,710
you're gonna be very sorry, mister.
You're gonna be very sorry!

355
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:16,782
Face-eating, Jack?

356
00:39:17,151 --> 00:39:20,905
l've never heard of that.
ls that some sort of delicacy?

357
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,346
No. Forget l ever mentioned it.

358
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:26,470
- Are you sure l shouldn't try it, Jack?
- l'm positive.

359
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:28,826
Walter, Jack is our friend. Right, Jack?

360
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:32,301
Friend... Friend! That's right.
Friend. 100%. I'm your friend.

361
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:34,621
That's all l ever wanted to be. Your friend.

362
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:38,101
- But we do owe you an explanation.
- No, you don't owe me anything.

363
00:39:38,191 --> 00:39:41,661
You don't...
Not even for the boat, honestly. lt's free.

364
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:45,702
Jack. Of course we're gonna
pay you for the boat. We're honest.

365
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:50,228
Well, of course you're honest!
Did l ever accuse you of being dishonest?

366
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:53,860
l accused you of being from another planet.
But an honest planet.

367
00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:56,226
Jack. Jack, sit down.

368
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,541
- l don't wanna sit down.
- Jack, sit!

369
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:07,779
Now, Jack,
l want you to listen to me very carefully.

370
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:12,023
We're Antareans.
We come from a planet called Antarea.

371
00:40:12,111 --> 00:40:14,227
Yeah, that's what l pretty much figured.

372
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:18,304
100 centuries ago, we had an outpost
here on Earth, before the first upheaval.

373
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:21,303
- Well, l think l'm better off not knowing.
- Shh.

374
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:25,708
We were able to evacuate everyone
except for my ground crew.

375
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:28,988
- Ground crew?
- And now we've come back for them.

376
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:37,706
Boy. l thought l'd been around. Nothing
like this has ever happened to me before.

377
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:40,510
Now, Jack, you could turn us in.

378
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:44,827
Or you could do something else
to make things difficult for us.

379
00:40:44,911 --> 00:40:49,143
But believe me, Jack,
we will still get our friends back.

380
00:40:49,231 --> 00:40:54,464
And the only thing that would happen is that
we'd end up renting someone else's boat.

381
00:41:02,351 --> 00:41:06,469
You know, l got left behind once.
lt was in Coney lsland. l was nine.

382
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:11,703
lt was pretty heavy for a nine-year-old.
My parents finally came back for me.

383
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:13,941
Of course. And now we've come back.

384
00:41:14,871 --> 00:41:18,068
- So you're comin' back for your friends?
- Exactly.

385
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:23,064
Jack, this is the most
important thing we've ever done.

386
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:30,265
You're not gonna hurt me, are you, Walt?

387
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:33,703
All we need to do
is to get our friends and leave.

388
00:41:34,711 --> 00:41:37,271
And go... pfft?

389
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:40,787
- Yes. Pfft.
- Right. Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.

390
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:45,946
- None of this is bad for America, l guess?
- Of course not.

391
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:51,260
Well, damn it, l'm in.

392
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:54,866
This... This is incredible.

393
00:41:55,751 --> 00:41:58,663
Right. Now, nothing's gonna fall off, is it?

394
00:41:58,751 --> 00:42:00,548
No.

395
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:03,466
- Come on, Mr Lefkowitz.
- You'll love it.

396
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:07,385
- You'll be a new man, Bernie, believe me.
- Remember, l said l'd look.

397
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:10,907
- l'm not promising l'll get wet.
- Fine. Just look.

398
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:14,222
By the way, right here
is where a crime is being committed.

399
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:16,461
Not by me, because l'm being carried.

400
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:19,349
Don't you worry, Bernie.
We'll take the fall for you.

401
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:23,185
Fall? That's another thing.
l fall, l break my hip, l can't sue anybody.

402
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:31,424
- lt's nice and warm, Bernie.
- They're rocks.

403
00:42:32,351 --> 00:42:34,626
What are rocks doing in a pool?

404
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:39,901
ln an ocean, fine.
There l expect to see plenty of rocks.

405
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:42,266
But in a pool? No.

406
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:52,231
Hah! Cowardly cowardly custard!

407
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:54,302
Can't cut the mustard!

408
00:42:55,591 --> 00:42:57,980
Come on, Bernie!

409
00:43:03,151 --> 00:43:05,904
And it's Joe... Joe taking the lead...

410
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:10,382
Come on! Come on, navy! Come on!

411
00:43:10,471 --> 00:43:13,986
Come on, you worn-out old pusses!
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig!

412
00:43:14,271 --> 00:43:16,227
l'll see you tomorrow.

413
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:24,028
Hey, fellas? Fellas, fellas, hey!

414
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:26,261
Somebody's comin'. Let's get out!

415
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:29,345
Let's get out of here.
Come on! Let's go. Come on!

416
00:43:29,431 --> 00:43:32,741
- Come on. Get a move on.
- Come on. ln here.

417
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:32,705
- Out of the way!
- Let's move!

418
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:35,307
- Jesus!
- Let's move!

419
00:45:35,391 --> 00:45:37,825
Come on, open the fuckin' door.

420
00:45:37,911 --> 00:45:40,186
Let's go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

421
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,821
l begged you not to go.

422
00:45:55,911 --> 00:45:59,745
You've got to do something.
There are things from outer space next door.

423
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:04,109
You gents keep suckin' on that oxygen.
They'll probably go back to their own planet.

424
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:07,183
- Get the police, you idiots.
- Hey, look.

425
00:46:07,271 --> 00:46:12,026
l'm not callin' no cops because a couple of
geezers saw some people from outer space.

426
00:46:12,111 --> 00:46:16,263
lf my husband said he saw people from
outer space, they were from outer space!

427
00:46:16,351 --> 00:46:18,865
- Get the goddamn police!
- OK.

428
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:24,179
Call the police. Whoo!

429
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:32,304
They must have concocted
this crazy story to cover themselves.

430
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:37,704
Spacemen, you say? That's wonderful! Well,
we'll all be that old someday. lf we're lucky.

431
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:42,148
Yeah. Well, we're gonna shoot on over to the
home and straighten this whole thing out.

432
00:46:42,231 --> 00:46:44,745
l wouldn't be too hard on 'em. Just tell 'em,

433
00:46:44,831 --> 00:46:49,143
as long as they're willing to respect our
privacy in future, we won't press charges.

434
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:52,268
- We'll keep 'em on their side of the fence.
- Thank you.

435
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,342
My pleasure. Bye-bye.

436
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:04,063
Well, l guess we shouldn't be greedy about it.

437
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:08,068
We're better off than before we found it.

438
00:47:08,151 --> 00:47:10,984
Bess said we should
take it to The National Enquirer.

439
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:13,301
They pay money for this kind of story.

440
00:47:13,391 --> 00:47:15,382
l wish l had the guts to go in.

441
00:47:16,391 --> 00:47:20,623
Yeah. Boy, l wish
l never even knew about this place.

442
00:47:39,111 --> 00:47:41,102
Oh. What time is it?

443
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,182
Just after four.

444
00:48:24,231 --> 00:48:27,826
l'm gonna go talk to him.
Goddamn, it's ridiculous.

445
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:52,462
Hey, Walter.

446
00:48:54,151 --> 00:48:56,506
Well, l'm not surprised you're here.

447
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,387
There's something in that pool
a friend of ours just has to have.

448
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:04,508
Matter of fact,
there's a few of us could use a little of it.

449
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:09,346
We don't care who you are, where you've
been, what you're doin', what you're up to.

450
00:49:09,431 --> 00:49:11,422
Sure need that pool.

451
00:49:13,271 --> 00:49:18,345
Look, Ben, l know you're
just trying to help your people.

452
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:21,982
Well, l'm trying to help mine.

453
00:49:22,911 --> 00:49:26,870
No, see, my friend Joe Finley, he's got cancer.

454
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:32,862
l'm trying to save his life.

455
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:36,465
l'm trying to save 20 lives.

456
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:38,542
And l'm running out of time.

457
00:49:43,911 --> 00:49:46,630
No son of a bitch
has to know we're in that pool.

458
00:49:46,711 --> 00:49:51,831
We'll just be a few old farts paddlin'
around in that pool. Who's gonna know?

459
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:08,869
Every ten or eleven thousand years or so,
l make a terrible mistake.

460
00:50:10,231 --> 00:50:15,510
The last one was when l picked what
you call Atlantis as our base here on Earth.

461
00:50:15,591 --> 00:50:19,300
Everyone else said use the North Pole.
l said ''No, too cold.''

462
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:22,622
Sinking never occurred to me.

463
00:50:23,111 --> 00:50:25,579
You're gonna let us use the pool, aren't you?

464
00:50:25,671 --> 00:50:28,344
You won't touch those cocoons?

465
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:30,422
No. No, l swear.

466
00:50:33,391 --> 00:50:35,985
Use the pool.

467
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:40,061
Thank you. Thank you!

468
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:51,503
- l, for one, don't believe this alien crap at all.
- You don't believe your husband?

469
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:55,266
- No.
- l believe Joe. l believe him and l'm scared.

470
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:59,264
- l don't believe it and l'm still scared.
- l guess l'm just less gullible.

471
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:03,105
Mary, you have your nerve!
l have more horse sense than you ever had.

472
00:51:03,191 --> 00:51:06,979
Ladies, ladies. Let's just go
and see for ourselves. Come on.

473
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:10,149
All right. Let's meet the aliens!

474
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:13,985
l hate to go visiting without
a plate of cookies or a box of candy.

475
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,631
- We're going home.
- Will you cut it out, Bernie?

476
00:51:16,711 --> 00:51:19,748
- We have permission, don't we?
- Those people aren't people.

477
00:51:19,831 --> 00:51:22,868
- l'm not gonna have anything to do with 'em.
- Oh, pipe down.

478
00:51:22,951 --> 00:51:25,385
You're playin' with fire over there.

479
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:28,060
l'm a citizen. l believe in this country.

480
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:31,621
l'm thinkin' of blowin' a whistle
on the whole deal. Come on, Rose.

481
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,350
- Stop right there.
- Oh, what. What?

482
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:38,060
- Stop thinkin' about yourself. This is for Joe.
- Joe?

483
00:51:38,631 --> 00:51:41,464
ls Joe above the law? Are any of us?

484
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:48,181
- ln 1948, Dutch Schultz walked into my store.
- Bernie. Bernie, shut up!

485
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:52,150
- Let me tell you about what Dutch said.
- Bernie. Bernie!

486
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:57,386
lf you don't wanna do this for Rose, if you
don't wanna do it for yourself, that's fine.

487
00:51:57,751 --> 00:52:01,221
- But if you screw it up for us...
- Don't threaten me, Joe.

488
00:52:01,311 --> 00:52:05,304
Bernie, please.
Let her come with us. Just this once.

489
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:10,307
No, no. Never. Rose and l
will never set foot over there again.

490
00:52:10,671 --> 00:52:12,980
Nature dealt us a hand of cards.
We play them.

491
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:17,781
Now, at the end of the game, suddenly
you're lookin' to reshuffle the deck? Huh?

492
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:21,147
Oh, come on, Rose. Come on, let's go.

493
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:33,385
Anybody have second thoughts?

494
00:52:34,671 --> 00:52:37,231
- Not me.
- l'm a citizen too.

495
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:41,780
l was in the navy.
l don't see anything wrong with it.

496
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:47,025
Then you drive. l got no licence.

497
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:17,500
* How would you like
to spend the weekend in Havana?

498
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:27,223
Are your extraterrestrials
gonna make a personal appearance?

499
00:53:27,311 --> 00:53:29,620
Hey, Pills! Come on in!

500
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:34,187
Hi, Pillsbury. How you doin', pal?

501
00:53:34,671 --> 00:53:37,310
You'll like Pillsbury. He's a fine fella.

502
00:53:44,111 --> 00:53:46,102
Adios, Pillsbury!

503
00:53:50,111 --> 00:53:52,500
All right. Let's start here.

504
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:54,941
P-E-Z-O-L-C-F-T-D.

505
00:53:58,671 --> 00:54:00,741
Sir, what line are you reading?

506
00:54:01,031 --> 00:54:04,387
The bottom one.
We're in a little bit of a hurry, OK?

507
00:54:22,351 --> 00:54:25,024
Look, look! We've gotta go into the club.

508
00:55:50,111 --> 00:55:52,102
Hello, Grandpa.

509
00:55:56,031 --> 00:55:58,670
Hey, look at the old fogies.

510
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:02,742
Off the floor, Grandpa.

511
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:02,069
..requiring weekend
transportation to St Petersburg,

512
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:06,030
contact miss Lerner
in her office by one o'clock today.

513
00:57:06,111 --> 00:57:07,829
Hi, Pops.

514
00:57:07,911 --> 00:57:09,902
Hey. Hey!

515
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,709
l wanna talk to you two.

516
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:20,784
The word on the corridor is that you dudes
are onto some kind of rejuvenation.

517
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,307
Rejuve-what?

518
00:57:27,391 --> 00:57:30,383
- You know what l'm talkin' about.
- No, we don't.

519
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:36,546
- l wish we could help you.
- Your wife been climbin' trees a long time?

520
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41,500
- She climbs one every once in a while.
- Once in a great while.

521
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:43,901
That's right.

522
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:50,345
You know, whenever
l'm around you, l feel really good.

523
00:58:51,351 --> 00:58:53,626
Really good. Do l do that to you?

524
00:58:54,311 --> 00:58:56,302
lt happens.

525
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:01,070
Do you ever wanna do anything about it?

526
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:03,540
Well, not the way you think about it.

527
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:09,142
l mean, l can't.

528
00:59:09,231 --> 00:59:11,222
Oh. Right.

529
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:14,063
Right.

530
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:16,870
Well, how does an Antarean...

531
00:59:19,911 --> 00:59:21,981
express affection?

532
00:59:23,671 --> 00:59:25,946
- We share ourselves.
- All right!

533
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:28,742
Do you wanna try it?

534
00:59:31,631 --> 00:59:34,020
lt's very fulfilling.

535
01:00:27,471 --> 01:00:29,701
Don't touch me.

536
01:00:30,391 --> 01:00:32,905
Don't touch you? What's the big deal?

537
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:37,470
All right. l'm gonna tell you the truth.
You're not my first Antarean.

538
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:41,783
- l'm not naming names, but...
- Jack, go to the other side of the pool.

539
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:52,103
Well, l hope you're not gonna take your skin
off, because l really like skin on a woman.

540
01:01:58,151 --> 01:02:00,711
lf this is foreplay, l'm a dead man.

541
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:10,949
- Three strikes!
- They set the pins up, l knock 'em down.

542
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:15,104
Hey, you know something?
You had marvellous balls.

543
01:02:15,671 --> 01:02:18,310
l've bowled with a lot of women.
You have potential.

544
01:02:18,391 --> 01:02:22,270
You seem like you're havin'
a grand time. l know l am.

545
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:25,423
Joe, you'll never bowl another
game like that as long as you live.

546
01:02:25,511 --> 01:02:28,389
- Don't count on it. l may turn professional.
- Sure!

547
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:31,110
What's next? What's next? Let's have a party.

548
01:02:31,511 --> 01:02:33,308
A party. l'm for that.

549
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:36,701
* You bring the hot dog,
and l'll bring the bun!

550
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:38,747
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

551
01:02:38,831 --> 01:02:41,140
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- What?

552
01:02:41,231 --> 01:02:45,304
Look at you goddamn people.
l mean, l think this is a serious mistake.

553
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:47,507
What? A mistake about what?

554
01:02:47,591 --> 01:02:51,379
Well, you know, l promised Walter
we'd keep it secret, and look at this.

555
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:54,861
Oh, yeah.
Let's not have too much fun, everybody.

556
01:02:54,951 --> 01:02:58,387
Remember, we're old, old, old...

557
01:02:58,871 --> 01:03:01,101
Not for me. l'm gonna enjoy everything.

558
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:03,341
- Where to next, Ben?
- Home.

559
01:03:03,431 --> 01:03:07,947
- Ah, come on. Live a little.
- Joe, Joe, Joe. Everybody. Let's go home.

560
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:11,467
- But l'm not ready to go home yet.
- Come on. Come on, let's go.

561
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:15,260
- What's happening, suddenly?
- Well, l'll go with you, Joe.

562
01:03:16,031 --> 01:03:18,625
No, you go on home.
l may have a drink or two.

563
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,822
Will you keep that for me?

564
01:03:25,631 --> 01:03:28,748
So, good night, you worriers.

565
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:31,026
Boy, talk about wet blankets.

566
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,342
Hey. l'll be fine.

567
01:04:21,231 --> 01:04:24,906
- l still can't believe l did that.
- l always liked chocolate.

568
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:29,826
l'll try not to dump anything on you tonight.
l can't promise, but l'll try.

569
01:04:51,911 --> 01:04:53,902
Alma...

570
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:59,261
- lt's the pool.
- lt's not the pool. lt's not the water.

571
01:04:59,351 --> 01:05:01,342
lt's not the first time.

572
01:05:05,391 --> 01:05:08,189
- Alma, you're overreacting.
- l knew. l always knew.

573
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:12,742
l just pretended to be stupid, and l guess
l really was. But you're the stupid one.

574
01:05:12,831 --> 01:05:15,789
- Things have been so good between us.
- Nothing's changed...

575
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:21,150
Go home, Joe. Don't make yourself look
any more ridiculous than you already are.

576
01:05:21,231 --> 01:05:24,780
l'm happy you're going to live, Joe.
But l've got to live too.

577
01:06:39,254 --> 01:06:42,644
Joe. Joe, try to relax.

578
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,808
Hey, are you up for a swim, maybe?

579
01:06:46,774 --> 01:06:49,129
Well, sure.

580
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:52,923
Pool! Pool!
Can't you think about anything else?

581
01:06:53,014 --> 01:06:57,804
- lf you and Rose came, you'd feel differently.
- We don't want to. We like the way we feel.

582
01:06:57,894 --> 01:07:00,533
She needs it, Bernie.

583
01:07:00,614 --> 01:07:04,732
- We should discuss this later.
- There is nothing to discuss!

584
01:07:04,814 --> 01:07:08,045
You're a hard-head.
You're the most frightened man l ever knew.

585
01:07:08,134 --> 01:07:12,685
- Christ, l don't have to listen to you.
- lf you sit at this table you damn well do!

586
01:07:13,414 --> 01:07:18,852
You think you're in such great shape, Finley.
Your marriage is what's terminally ill now.

587
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:23,371
- You really are an old bastard.
- Old is right. l don't wanna be young again.

588
01:07:23,654 --> 01:07:27,772
You're a mess because of the fountain of
youth, however healthy you think you are!

589
01:07:27,854 --> 01:07:30,766
- Sit down, stupid.
- We don't want any part of that pool!

590
01:07:30,854 --> 01:07:34,005
You can keep the goddamn fountain of youth!

591
01:07:34,374 --> 01:07:36,842
No wonder your wife has no use for you.

592
01:07:36,934 --> 01:07:39,767
- l'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
- Joe! Joe!

593
01:07:49,294 --> 01:07:52,331
Joe! Joe, Joe, Joe! Joe!

594
01:07:56,934 --> 01:08:01,086
lt's next door, isn't it?
lt's in that pool over there, right?

595
01:08:02,574 --> 01:08:04,724
- Get that pool!
- Get out of the way!

596
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:55,490
What is...

597
01:08:55,574 --> 01:08:58,532
Oh, my God! What do we do? Ben...

598
01:09:00,294 --> 01:09:03,047
- Please, get out of the pool.
- Come on. Everybody out!

599
01:09:08,134 --> 01:09:10,694
Come on. Get out of there.

600
01:09:14,654 --> 01:09:17,009
Come on, out of the water! Get out!

601
01:09:17,094 --> 01:09:19,369
You're trespassing!

602
01:09:19,654 --> 01:09:21,884
Stop!

603
01:09:21,974 --> 01:09:23,965
Everybody out!

604
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:28,367
You have no right to be here.
You are trespassing here.

605
01:09:31,974 --> 01:09:34,204
Put down the cocoon.

606
01:09:34,614 --> 01:09:36,969
l said, put down the cocoon!

607
01:09:37,054 --> 01:09:39,443
Put it down. Put it down.

608
01:09:40,494 --> 01:09:44,726
l'm calling the police.
Get out, all of you. Get out!

609
01:11:20,894 --> 01:11:24,284
All this time to energise the pool,

610
01:11:24,374 --> 01:11:28,731
and now the life force
is completely drained from the water.

611
01:11:31,214 --> 01:11:33,648
l'm not gonna be able to bring them back.

612
01:11:45,774 --> 01:11:51,883
When Max saw me in that sweater with
the mouton collar and the ivory buttons,

613
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:55,808
he said ''Rose, where the hell
did you get that sweater?''

614
01:11:57,574 --> 01:11:59,724
l stayed mum.

615
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:04,043
Because l knew you stole it.

616
01:12:06,334 --> 01:12:08,325
But you stole it for me.

617
01:12:10,214 --> 01:12:12,489
Max never stole anything for me.

618
01:12:14,054 --> 01:12:17,729
And he never made anything
as beautiful as that mouton collar.

619
01:12:22,214 --> 01:12:25,251
Max couldn't do anything with his hands.

620
01:12:25,334 --> 01:12:27,723
Except when they were all over me.

621
01:12:30,414 --> 01:12:33,611
But you wouldn't even
kiss my cheek without asking.

622
01:12:37,494 --> 01:12:41,885
Dumping Max was
the smartest move l ever made.

623
01:12:49,214 --> 01:12:51,205
Oh, Bernie...

624
01:12:54,734 --> 01:12:57,328
Time for your medicine. l'll get it.

625
01:13:18,134 --> 01:13:20,125
Here you are.

626
01:13:21,734 --> 01:13:23,725
Rose.

627
01:13:25,294 --> 01:13:27,762
Rose? Are you asleep?

628
01:13:30,334 --> 01:13:32,325
Rose?

629
01:13:36,854 --> 01:13:38,845
Rose?

630
01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:42,205
Rose!

631
01:13:50,254 --> 01:13:52,245
Rose...

632
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,325
Rose.

633
01:14:00,014 --> 01:14:02,005
l'm so sorry.

634
01:14:55,614 --> 01:14:58,208
Can you help me?

635
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:02,765
l have to do something for her.
She... she...

636
01:15:03,654 --> 01:15:07,886
The pool doesn't work any more. lt's too late.

637
01:15:08,334 --> 01:15:10,928
l'll give you everything l've got.

638
01:15:14,054 --> 01:15:16,045
l'm sorry, Bernie.

639
01:15:17,734 --> 01:15:20,726
l wish l could help you. lt's just too late.

640
01:15:26,734 --> 01:15:28,884
Rosie?

641
01:15:30,334 --> 01:15:32,325
Oh, Rosie...

642
01:16:30,814 --> 01:16:33,248
- Hello, Ben.
- Walter.

643
01:16:33,334 --> 01:16:38,283
l thought maybe you guys had got out of
here already, after what happened today.

644
01:16:38,374 --> 01:16:41,923
l came by to tell you l'm sorry, Walter. l...

645
01:16:42,254 --> 01:16:44,814
l know we let you down and l'm really sorry.

646
01:16:57,054 --> 01:17:00,251
l had never experienced the pain and...

647
01:17:03,174 --> 01:17:07,008
the grief associated with death before.

648
01:17:07,094 --> 01:17:11,326
l... never had anyone close to me who died.

649
01:17:17,974 --> 01:17:20,204
Walter, these things out here.

650
01:17:21,294 --> 01:17:24,604
Can you take them back
with you on that spaceship?

651
01:17:25,814 --> 01:17:28,328
No. They would never survive the flight.

652
01:17:29,534 --> 01:17:32,173
Well, can you put 'em back in the ocean?

653
01:17:34,614 --> 01:17:36,605
Two are gone now.

654
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:41,245
Two of my friends are gone.

655
01:17:44,614 --> 01:17:49,642
We don't have time to get them all back in the
ocean. We must leave this place tomorrow.

656
01:17:49,734 --> 01:17:52,168
What if we do it tonight? We'll help you.

657
01:17:55,614 --> 01:17:59,129
- Bring that one around here, OK?
- Let me give you a hand with that.

658
01:17:59,214 --> 01:18:02,172
There are a lot more.
Take this one outside and come back.

659
01:18:02,254 --> 01:18:04,404
- OK. Got it?
- l can't do this alone.

660
01:18:05,534 --> 01:18:08,970
- Hey, could somebody give me a hand?
- Set it over there.

661
01:18:10,734 --> 01:18:14,044
- OK?
- Come on, let's go. Let's get a hold of it.

662
01:18:14,134 --> 01:18:19,208
Our base was sinking. The time to prepare
a passage for all of us was gone.

663
01:18:20,454 --> 01:18:24,766
These 20 chose to stay behind
so the rest of us could leave safely.

664
01:18:27,854 --> 01:18:33,804
They survived here in the ocean
for 10,000 years. They can survive again.

665
01:18:34,374 --> 01:18:36,365
- OK?
- Yes.

666
01:18:37,374 --> 01:18:39,410
- How you guys doin'?
- OK.

667
01:18:40,294 --> 01:18:43,889
- You OK?
- l'm fine. l've been diving before.

668
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:45,965
Oh, yeah?

669
01:20:58,814 --> 01:21:02,523
l want you all to consider very carefully
what l'm about to suggest to you.

670
01:21:05,414 --> 01:21:08,406
You and your friends
seem to want what we've got.

671
01:21:09,934 --> 01:21:13,722
Well, we have room for you.

672
01:21:15,574 --> 01:21:19,249
We have room for you
and about 30 more of your friends.

673
01:21:19,694 --> 01:21:22,208
You would be students, of course, but...

674
01:21:24,054 --> 01:21:26,090
But you'd also be teachers.

675
01:21:27,774 --> 01:21:30,607
And the new civilisations
that we'll be travelling to

676
01:21:30,694 --> 01:21:33,367
will be unlike
anything you've ever known.

677
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,965
But l promise you,

678
01:21:39,654 --> 01:21:42,043
you will all lead productive lives.

679
01:21:42,614 --> 01:21:46,163
- For ever?
- We don't know what ''for ever'' means.

680
01:22:06,334 --> 01:22:09,212
l got a couple of things l...

681
01:22:11,214 --> 01:22:14,126
- Not a good cast.
- ..l need to talk about with you.

682
01:22:14,214 --> 01:22:16,205
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

683
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:23,409
l guess me and your grandma
are goin' away, David.

684
01:22:24,574 --> 01:22:27,771
- Where to?
- Well, that's not important.

685
01:22:27,854 --> 01:22:29,845
What's important is that...

686
01:22:33,454 --> 01:22:35,763
when we get where we're goin'...

687
01:22:37,094 --> 01:22:42,532
we'll never be sick,
we won't get any older and we won't ever die.

688
01:22:48,294 --> 01:22:50,683
- You're joking me, right?
- No.

689
01:22:51,894 --> 01:22:53,930
No.

690
01:22:54,614 --> 01:22:57,048
Would l be able to visit you and Grandma?

691
01:22:57,974 --> 01:22:59,965
No.

692
01:23:01,094 --> 01:23:06,043
And we wouldn't be able
to visit you either, and that kinda bothers me.

693
01:23:06,134 --> 01:23:08,125
l'd never see you again?

694
01:23:12,334 --> 01:23:14,689
No.

695
01:23:14,974 --> 01:23:17,647
When would you go, if you did?

696
01:23:17,734 --> 01:23:19,725
Soon, my boy. Soon.

697
01:23:21,774 --> 01:23:25,005
- And do you know where?
- Where?

698
01:23:25,094 --> 01:23:27,085
Look up.

699
01:23:29,014 --> 01:23:33,405
Outer space, my lad. Outer space.

700
01:23:33,494 --> 01:23:35,724
Who's gonna take you to outer space?

701
01:23:36,134 --> 01:23:41,527
lt don't matter.
You wouldn't believe me if l told you.

702
01:23:41,614 --> 01:23:46,972
And l can't tell your mother, because she'd
then know her old man had snapped his cap.

703
01:23:48,694 --> 01:23:51,731
l wonder if they'll have fishin' holes there?

704
01:23:53,974 --> 01:24:00,004
There's some things they won't have. They
won't have grandsons and they won't have...

705
01:24:00,094 --> 01:24:05,930
baseball games, and they won't have hot
dogs, and they won't have that kind of stuff.

706
01:24:08,254 --> 01:24:10,245
l'm gonna miss 'em.

707
01:24:11,654 --> 01:24:13,645
All right, cast it out there.

708
01:24:24,814 --> 01:24:27,328
l wish we'd get a bite.

709
01:24:27,414 --> 01:24:29,928
l'd like to catch one more great big fish.

710
01:24:35,294 --> 01:24:38,730
You know how much we love you, don't you?

711
01:24:38,814 --> 01:24:41,123
Of course l do.

712
01:24:41,214 --> 01:24:45,924
l just don't want you to forget how much
we care, no matter what we say or do.

713
01:24:47,094 --> 01:24:49,085
Of course.

714
01:25:08,574 --> 01:25:11,008
- Bye, Grandpa.
- Goodbye, little man.

715
01:25:12,614 --> 01:25:14,605
Smile.

716
01:25:15,974 --> 01:25:18,488
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

717
01:25:18,574 --> 01:25:20,963
Stop by next week sometime, OK?

718
01:25:23,654 --> 01:25:25,849
Be a good boy. Mind your mom.

719
01:25:53,054 --> 01:25:55,124
You havin' second thoughts?

720
01:25:57,134 --> 01:25:59,364
Yes.

721
01:26:01,094 --> 01:26:04,928
- So you think we're cheatin' nature?
- Yes.

722
01:26:07,814 --> 01:26:09,725
Well, l'll tell you something.

723
01:26:10,574 --> 01:26:15,011
The way nature's been treatin' us,
l don't mind cheatin' her a little.

724
01:26:28,454 --> 01:26:31,526
- You'll be closing your account, Mr Selwyn?
- Yes, l will.

725
01:26:31,614 --> 01:26:34,003
- All in $100 bills?
- Mm-hm.

726
01:26:34,974 --> 01:26:36,965
Here you go.

727
01:26:38,774 --> 01:26:40,924
This is for you.

728
01:26:41,014 --> 01:26:44,051
Sir!

729
01:26:45,294 --> 01:26:48,730
Here. Have fun!
Have fun, my friends, have fun!

730
01:26:48,814 --> 01:26:52,250
Here, divide it up, girls! Divide it up!

731
01:26:52,414 --> 01:26:54,530
There you are, there you are!

732
01:26:54,614 --> 01:26:58,493
* Racing with the moon! Hey, enjoy, enjoy!

733
01:26:58,694 --> 01:27:01,162
* Sailing to the midnight sun...

734
01:27:19,854 --> 01:27:21,845
He can come in for a minute.

735
01:27:27,814 --> 01:27:29,805
Hi.

736
01:27:36,614 --> 01:27:40,846
They say if we go with them,
we'll live for ever.

737
01:27:46,334 --> 01:27:50,771
Well, that's good. lt's probably going
to take you an eternity to forgive me.

738
01:27:58,814 --> 01:28:00,805
l'm sorry, Alma.

739
01:28:02,534 --> 01:28:05,685
l guess l've been ridiculous. l am sorry.

740
01:28:07,174 --> 01:28:09,005
l love you.

741
01:28:10,014 --> 01:28:12,005
You're my whole life.

742
01:28:15,734 --> 01:28:17,725
l want to go.

743
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:23,484
But if it's a choice of
only six more months here with you,

744
01:28:24,454 --> 01:28:29,528
or living for ever all by myself, well,
l'll take the six more months here with you.

745
01:28:32,254 --> 01:28:34,245
l don't wanna live for ever

746
01:28:36,254 --> 01:28:38,484
if you're not gonna be with me.

747
01:28:51,854 --> 01:28:55,403
- So you definitely trust them?
- We trust 'em.

748
01:28:55,494 --> 01:28:58,486
Men should be explorers,
no matter how old they are.

749
01:28:58,574 --> 01:29:01,247
l don't know about anybody else,
but l'm going.

750
01:29:07,454 --> 01:29:10,173
Why the hell not? We're in.

751
01:29:11,334 --> 01:29:12,528
Are you nervous?

752
01:29:12,974 --> 01:29:15,090
Me? No.

753
01:29:15,174 --> 01:29:17,688
You're sure you want to do this?

754
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:22,165
Once l make a decision,
Arthur, l never turn back.

755
01:29:22,254 --> 01:29:24,529
This is a big one.

756
01:29:24,814 --> 01:29:26,805
l know.

757
01:29:43,574 --> 01:29:48,853
Yeah, it's gonna be 72 and clear tonight.
A great night to see that total lunar eclipse.

758
01:29:48,934 --> 01:29:52,210
Check it out.
But don't get weird on me, people.

759
01:30:02,694 --> 01:30:04,685
Let's go. Let's go.

760
01:30:09,454 --> 01:30:11,445
Quick. Get me a glass of water.

761
01:30:13,374 --> 01:30:15,365
Look out.

762
01:30:20,614 --> 01:30:25,085
- Don't do that!
- What is the meaning of this?

763
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:36,884
David? You staying up for the eclipse?

764
01:30:39,894 --> 01:30:42,328
You don't seem too enthusiastic.

765
01:30:45,054 --> 01:30:47,443
Did you and Grandpa have a fight today?

766
01:30:48,614 --> 01:30:50,172
No.

767
01:30:50,254 --> 01:30:52,245
What did he say to you?

768
01:30:54,894 --> 01:30:59,843
David, l'm very worried about Grandpa
and Grandma. What did he say to you?

769
01:31:01,574 --> 01:31:03,565
l can't tell you.

770
01:31:03,654 --> 01:31:08,170
They're my parents, David.
You've got to tell me what he said to you.

771
01:31:15,214 --> 01:31:17,682
He made me promise.

772
01:31:50,094 --> 01:31:52,085
Mom? Dad?

773
01:31:53,014 --> 01:31:55,005
Mom? Dad?

774
01:31:59,694 --> 01:32:02,254
Hey, Bernie! Come on!

775
01:32:04,054 --> 01:32:06,045
You're coming with us, Bernie!

776
01:32:09,814 --> 01:32:13,124
No. l came to say goodbye.

777
01:32:13,734 --> 01:32:18,683
l just wanted to tell you,
l hope you find what you're looking for.

778
01:32:18,774 --> 01:32:21,083
Rose is gone, Bernie.

779
01:32:21,174 --> 01:32:23,165
Why stay?

780
01:32:26,614 --> 01:32:28,605
This is my home.

781
01:32:29,694 --> 01:32:31,685
This is where l belong.

782
01:32:33,454 --> 01:32:35,684
Come on, go with us.

783
01:32:51,094 --> 01:32:53,210
Goodbye, Bernie.

784
01:32:57,254 --> 01:32:59,643
- Goodbye, Bernie.
- Bye.

785
01:32:59,734 --> 01:33:01,725
We'll miss you.

786
01:33:15,614 --> 01:33:19,687
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on. Go.

787
01:33:23,494 --> 01:33:26,327
Only when l need it, right?
Only when l need it.

788
01:33:28,454 --> 01:33:30,445
Jesus...

789
01:33:31,614 --> 01:33:34,731
- l know something is wrong.
- They're probably out dancin'.

790
01:33:34,814 --> 01:33:36,805
Those folks love to dance.

791
01:33:37,934 --> 01:33:40,607
Could we talk to one of their friends?

792
01:33:41,694 --> 01:33:45,846
We'll go see Pops. Will that satisfy ya?

793
01:33:47,654 --> 01:33:49,770
Pops.

794
01:33:49,854 --> 01:33:52,049
Pops?

795
01:33:52,134 --> 01:33:54,853
Got a little game of 20 questions for ya.

796
01:33:54,934 --> 01:33:56,925
Pops!

797
01:33:59,054 --> 01:34:01,284
Oh, shit!

798
01:34:02,094 --> 01:34:04,085
Hello?

799
01:34:15,014 --> 01:34:17,244
l don't know what's goin' on here.

800
01:34:19,614 --> 01:34:21,923
- We'd better take a look down below.
- What?

801
01:34:22,014 --> 01:34:25,802
- We'd better take a look down below.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

802
01:34:28,294 --> 01:34:32,924
Make sure you get the feed line,
cos it's gotta be... You got it. Good.

803
01:34:34,494 --> 01:34:37,486
The injector.
Yeah, we gotta make the injector...

804
01:34:37,574 --> 01:34:40,213
You got that, too? Good. Um...

805
01:34:40,494 --> 01:34:46,649
Go house to house. Check the bus stations
and the airports. This is a serious situation.

806
01:34:46,734 --> 01:34:49,851
The owner of the facility is on his way.
He's not happy at all.

807
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:53,404
Why don't we start by taking
a good look around the grounds first?

808
01:34:53,494 --> 01:34:55,644
- OK, gentlemen?
- OK. Right this way.

809
01:34:56,054 --> 01:34:58,409
Better advise your commander.

810
01:35:00,734 --> 01:35:04,363
Don't worry, miss.
We'll help you find your father and mother.

811
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:08,049
- lt's right over here.
- We're in deep shit, you know that?

812
01:35:26,254 --> 01:35:29,087
David! David!

813
01:35:29,174 --> 01:35:31,165
Back this way!

814
01:35:37,094 --> 01:35:39,085
Hey, hey. Whoa!

815
01:35:47,094 --> 01:35:50,006
ln case you're wondering, Silly Putty.

816
01:36:00,614 --> 01:36:01,933
Cast off those lines.

817
01:36:10,494 --> 01:36:12,769
Grandpa! Wait for me!

818
01:36:12,854 --> 01:36:15,084
l want to go too!

819
01:36:19,334 --> 01:36:22,724
- Grandpa!
- What are you doing here? Are you all right?

820
01:36:22,814 --> 01:36:25,169
- Yeah.
- My gosh.

821
01:36:29,974 --> 01:36:33,205
- David! David!
- A boatjust left from the dock next door.

822
01:36:33,294 --> 01:36:36,172
- Old people. A kid. Some in wheelchairs.
- Mom! Dad!

823
01:36:36,254 --> 01:36:39,485
- David!
- We'd better move. l don't like the looks of it.

824
01:36:41,774 --> 01:36:43,765
You can't go.

825
01:36:44,654 --> 01:36:47,293
Only your grandmother
and me from this outfit.

826
01:37:30,374 --> 01:37:33,844
Captain, this is Air 21.
l think l got 'em below me.

827
01:37:34,094 --> 01:37:37,803
- Want me to swoop 'em? Over.
- Roger, Air 21. You are cleared.

828
01:37:58,814 --> 01:38:03,410
This is the Coast Guard helicopter.
Heave to. Prepare to be boarded.

829
01:38:13,894 --> 01:38:19,207
Manta lll, be prepared for Coast Guard boats
to come alongside and board your vessel.

830
01:38:20,574 --> 01:38:23,407
Manta lll, this is not a request, this is an order.

831
01:38:23,494 --> 01:38:27,612
You are endangering the lives
of your passengers. Cut your engines.

832
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:30,527
We are coming alongside
to board your vessel.

833
01:38:31,014 --> 01:38:33,733
Jack. Don't let them board us.

834
01:38:34,614 --> 01:38:38,653
Nobody's gonna board this boat.
You just get your friends here.

835
01:39:03,254 --> 01:39:06,007
Engines! Cut your engines!

836
01:39:06,294 --> 01:39:10,207
Captain, this is Lieutenant Spark
of the St Petersburg Police.

837
01:39:10,534 --> 01:39:14,766
You have senior citizens aboard
who are in no condition to be out here.

838
01:39:14,854 --> 01:39:18,130
You have a minor aboard
without authority from his mother.

839
01:39:18,214 --> 01:39:22,287
We want to question you.
Please cut your engines now.

840
01:39:23,454 --> 01:39:28,528
We are coming alongside to board
your vessel. Stand by to be boarded.

841
01:39:29,934 --> 01:39:33,529
David's mother wants him
to come into the police boat with her.

842
01:39:33,614 --> 01:39:38,847
David, come on! Please!
Mom and Dad, where are you going?!

843
01:39:44,494 --> 01:39:46,769
David! You come back here!

844
01:39:50,334 --> 01:39:52,325
- David!
- Swing it around!

845
01:39:53,574 --> 01:39:56,486
Cut your engines! Cut your engines!

846
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,963
Man overboard! Man overboard, gentlemen.

847
01:40:01,534 --> 01:40:03,809
- You all right?
- l'm OK.

848
01:40:03,894 --> 01:40:06,772
l'm not scared! Get going!

849
01:40:09,134 --> 01:40:11,125
Let's go.

850
01:40:30,774 --> 01:40:32,765
Oh, David.

851
01:40:43,014 --> 01:40:45,005
Roger.

852
01:40:45,094 --> 01:40:47,927
Maintaining visual of the Manta.

853
01:40:48,014 --> 01:40:51,529
These people must be nuts.
We're gonna have to pursue and intercept.

854
01:42:00,294 --> 01:42:02,524
We just went into fog, rollin' out.

855
01:42:02,614 --> 01:42:06,004
Recheck speed selectors,
full forward. Wheels up.

856
01:42:10,054 --> 01:42:13,569
- Where the hell did this come from?
- l don't know.

857
01:42:13,654 --> 01:42:15,645
l can't see a damn thing.

858
01:42:16,174 --> 01:42:18,051
l never seen it roll in so fast.

859
01:42:18,814 --> 01:42:20,805
My God.

860
01:42:27,374 --> 01:42:32,243
- We got no reading on radar. Over.
- 1-4-X-3, we copy. Zero visibility.

861
01:42:32,334 --> 01:42:37,169
- We're gonna run into each other. Go ahead.
- Roger. Let's shut 'em down. Over.

862
01:43:30,094 --> 01:43:32,688
This should more than cover
the cost of the boat.

863
01:43:32,774 --> 01:43:36,892
- l...
- l want to thank you for being a fine guide.

864
01:43:36,974 --> 01:43:38,965
- And a good friend.
- All right.

865
01:43:40,334 --> 01:43:43,212
Uh... Now, you drive careful, Walter.

866
01:43:46,334 --> 01:43:48,325
See you, Walter.

867
01:43:59,734 --> 01:44:02,043
Well, l guess your ride's here, huh?

868
01:44:02,534 --> 01:44:07,005
Look, Kitty, next time you're in town,
l want you to look me up, OK?

869
01:44:07,094 --> 01:44:10,723
Don't worry, Jack.
You'll know when l'm around.

870
01:44:10,814 --> 01:44:14,045
You don't know how close
l came to buying a ticket.

871
01:44:34,774 --> 01:44:38,733
- You'd better go.
- OK. l'm gonna miss you, Kitty. l really am.

872
01:44:43,334 --> 01:44:45,848
''May the Force be with you!''

873
01:46:28,694 --> 01:46:32,084
There can never be
an accounting, in human terms,

874
01:46:32,174 --> 01:46:36,964
for the tragedy at sea which has taken
the lives of these men and women

875
01:46:37,054 --> 01:46:42,447
in what should have been the beautiful
and peaceful sunset of their lives.

876
01:46:43,614 --> 01:46:48,608
Do not fear.
Your loved ones are in safe keeping.

877
01:46:49,214 --> 01:46:53,002
They have moved on
to a higher expression of life.

878
01:46:53,094 --> 01:46:57,087
Not life as we know it,
but in the spirit everlasting.

879
01:46:57,854 --> 01:47:03,690
Our loved ones are in good hands,
for now and for evermore.

880
01:47:04,774 --> 01:47:08,164
Join with me now
in a moment of silent prayer.

881
