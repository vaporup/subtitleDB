1
00:01:58,178 --> 00:02:01,238
- Hi Frankie.
- Hello.

2
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:13,025
(Man in background) Get in there.

3
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:21,998
(Traffic noise)

4
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,637
(Men's laughter)

5
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:40,148
Nothing like that first drink of the
day. Go on drink up enjoy it.

6
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,388
Hey, what he do or what? Huh?

7
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:46,358
Say they tell me your some dancer.
Well how about a little dance anyway?

8
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,359
No?

9
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,520
Hey, gimme back. Who's horsing
around? What's the big idea?

10
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:20,119
Frankie!

11
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:24,158
Frankie, Frankie when
did you get back? How are you?

12
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,524
You alright? You know...

13
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:29,664
The monkey's gone.

14
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:31,868
Let me look at you. Let me look at you.

15
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:35,268
Not even a postie card.

16
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:39,973
- You can't read anyway.
- Well, you could have drawed pictures.

17
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:42,874
Hey, you goofy punk.
How's the lost dog business?

18
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,145
Soon as they see me hanging around,
people start locking up their mutts.

19
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:51,189
I tell you folks just don't have that
trust in their fellow man anymore.

20
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,782
Know what I mean?
(Sound of laughter)

21
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:56,393
Hey Antek, look who's out.

22
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:59,997
Hey Frankie. You alright? Clean?

23
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:01,498
- Yep.
- Good kid.

24
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,563
- Enough already, buy me a drink.
- Sure.

25
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,499
Look what the cat dragged in.

26
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:07,072
Frankie, Honey!

27
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,766
You gone so long I thought
maybe you was made warden.

28
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,138
Hey you're lookin' good, dealer.

29
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:12,277
Put on 6 Ibs.

30
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:13,472
Wow, 6 Ibs.

31
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:16,047
He's gone so long I thought
maybe he's made warden.

32
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,480
How was it down there, Frankie?

33
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,073
Greatest place you ever see, Nancy.

34
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:20,447
She means Lexington.

35
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:24,751
I'm telling you, ball games, great food.
I even learned how to play the drums.

36
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:26,791
You make it sound
as if I missed something

37
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:29,020
by not going to jail years ago.
It's a prison, no?

38
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:32,325
More a hospital, kind of.
Let me show you something.

39
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:35,233
Oh, the federal pens
is always best, ask anybody.

40
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:36,494
(Nancy ) Oh, I know.

41
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:38,968
He's gone so long
I think he's made warden.

42
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,374
Ever see anything so pretty?
Don't touch.

43
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:46,201
Hey, how'd you sneak them out,
Frankie?

44
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:48,007
The guys give me em' up
there in the band.

45
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:49,478
They let you have a band?

46
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:52,483
Yeah, I was in it. And they chipped
in and bought me these when I left.

47
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:53,592
Wow!

48
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:55,420
Long time dealer.

49
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,486
How was it there, bad, huh?

50
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:03,022
It was alright.

51
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:06,059
Six months, you can hardly wait I bet.

52
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:11,635
Come over my place. C'mon.

53
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:13,465
No thanks, Louie.

54
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:16,974
You broke. Now ain't yer
being stupid, it's for free.

55
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,440
I don't need it, is all. I kicked it.

56
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:26,074
Oh. Kicked it. One of them.

57
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:30,055
- I mean it.
- Sure.

58
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,486
I'll be around.

59
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:43,524
Frankie don't do it. Don't start up
with that peddler again.

60
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:47,428
Me, I'd rather chop my arm off
before I let him touch it.

61
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,010
This Dr. Lennox who took care of me
down at the hospital. A real good guy.

62
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:53,974
He told me at least ten times.

63
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:56,104
He said,
"Frankie when you get out of here,

64
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:58,547
you take even one fix,
you're hooked again. "

65
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:03,613
Don't worry about me, buddy boy.

66
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:06,153
Let's get out of here.

67
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:07,534
Thanks Antek.

68
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:12,030
Antek, take care of this asset for me.
I got a customer coming to get it.

69
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:13,705
Ok. Sparrow.

70
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:21,502
Don't let him give you no gas.

71
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:25,071
Him? I ain't gonna' be around here
long enough to let him bother me.

72
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:27,836
I'm gonna' get me a job
in a big name band.

73
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:29,344
You're kiddin'?

74
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:32,244
What do you think I'm strengthening
my wrist for, Buddy-O?

75
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,313
The guy teaches me drumming
down there, says that I'm a natural.

76
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,916
Can't miss, he says.
Arms made of pure gold.

77
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:40,254
You mean a job whanging these drums.

78
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,625
I got everything planned too.
I'm gonna' call myself Jack Duvall.

79
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:48,792
Golly, I ain't gonna' see you
around so much then, huh?

80
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:51,636
Yeah, maybe I can set
somethin' up for you.

81
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:53,170
Carrying the instruments or somethin'.

82
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:54,239
Wow!

83
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,231
Travellin' around the country.
High type nightclubs.

84
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:57,937
How's that sound to you, punk?

85
00:06:58,077 --> 00:06:59,237
When is it gonna' be? When?

86
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,939
Right away today. I'm the kinda' guy,
boy when I move, watch my smoke.

87
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:04,913
But I'm gonna' need
some good clothes, though.

88
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,611
Oh, well you go on up.
I'm gonna' find you some.

89
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,047
- Yeah, yeah. Size 39 get.
- 39.

90
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:11,213
- Stripes.
- Stripes.

91
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:12,450
Somethin' nice.

92
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:19,260
(Loud crashing noises,
coming from an apartment)

93
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,868
(Landlord). You stop that noise!

94
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:25,597
You and husband,
or I throw you both out.

95
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:27,105
You hear!

96
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:28,903
(Vi)
I'll make all the noise I want.

97
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:32,440
(Landlord) Who is landlord?
Me! You do like I say.

98
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:35,110
You're mother's icebox,
I'll do like you say.

99
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:41,584
Frankie Machine! Ah, you look great.

100
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:45,150
How are you feelin', Frankie? I mean...

101
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,124
Fine, Vi, just fine. Hiya landlord.

102
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:52,220
Mad. She and husband fight
all the time. Holler, throw things.

103
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:54,162
Nothing changes.

104
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:57,430
(Landlord) This is respectable
house and I am respectable man.

105
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,037
(Vi) Respectable, my eye.

106
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:01,402
Go on get out you're late
for the paroleboard.

107
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:25,855
Frankie!

108
00:08:29,602 --> 00:08:31,092
Oh, Frankie.

109
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:35,615
Zosh.

110
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:40,539
Oh, Frankie I love you so much...

111
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,416
I've missed you so... I've missed you...

112
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,326
I've been so lonely Frankie without you.

113
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,439
SSh.

114
00:08:58,531 --> 00:08:59,623
So lonely without you.

115
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:02,428
Zosh stop crying.
Zosh let me look at you.

116
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:06,662
My eyes are gonna' be all red.

117
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,500
No, you look fine, Zosh.

118
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:11,570
Honest? Has the cold sore gone?

119
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:14,678
No, you look real good.

120
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:26,118
I had this cold sore. I want to look real
nice for you when you came back

121
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:30,661
and I was afraid it would'nt be gone,
so I put this goofy salve on to dry it.

122
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,097
Oh Francis.

123
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:36,565
No, Zosh,
everything's gonna' be alright.

124
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:44,206
Oh, you didn't see it. Look Vi got the
cake by the bakery, but the sign I made.

125
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,906
It's sorta' like for a welcome home.

126
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,515
Gee it's like a real party or somethin'.

127
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:56,181
It's real nice Zosh.

128
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:59,090
How are you Frankie?

129
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,785
I'm clean.

130
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:01,951
Sure?

131
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:03,994
I kicked it for keeps.

132
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:09,366
Did it hurt? How was it there for you?

133
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:13,731
Oh, they treated me fine down there.
There was this Dr. This Dr. Lennox.

134
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,136
He was real good to me.

135
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,044
Frankie, Frankie did you miss me?

136
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:26,115
Of course I missed you Zosh.
What kind of silly question is that?

137
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,117
Of course I missed you,
honest no kiddin'.

138
00:10:32,558 --> 00:10:34,526
What have you got there?

139
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:37,387
You'll see.
Oh, I brought you somethin'.

140
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:41,368
There.

141
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:43,793
Oh, it's an exquisite thing.

142
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,832
You like it? I made it myself,
out of cigarette wrappers.

143
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,039
It's just an exquisite thing, is all.
You made it?

144
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,138
Yeah, for a hobby like. See part
of the cure is to keep yourself busy

145
00:10:56,248 --> 00:11:00,810
doing things you enjoy. Like for instance
I wanted to learn to drum and music.

146
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:04,018
Doctor Lennox got them
to help me do it.

147
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:08,223
During the day I was kept busy enough,
but sometimes at night,

148
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:12,955
I get restless I wanted to keep my
mind of the craving. I made that.

149
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:16,963
There's somethin' important
I gotta' tell you.

150
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:18,199
What?

151
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,771
I forget right now.

152
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:21,230
(Zosh whistles )

153
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:24,440
A whistle?

154
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:28,208
Oh, I was scared sometimes
being alone. So Vi got it for me,

155
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:30,282
I should blow for her when I wanted her.

156
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,647
Go on you were telling me.

157
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:36,017
Oh, well the first thing you do
when you get there,

158
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:38,090
you talk to a doctor for about two hours.

159
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,349
Oh, know. I know what it is.
I know what I had to tell you.

160
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:43,662
Vi took me to this movie and the
girl's kid brother had a friend in it.

161
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:45,458
Now who do you think he looked like?

162
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:46,622
Who?

163
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:51,692
You! Oh, it was a good movie.
The stage show was real good too.

164
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:54,638
We owe Vi eighty cents
for the movie, I was broke.

165
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,708
We owe her for the cake too.

166
00:11:57,977 --> 00:12:01,469
How come you don't have any money?
Schwiefka didn't kick in regular?

167
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:02,721
No.

168
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:07,108
Well he was supposed to.
It was his joint they raided not mine.

169
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:10,650
I was just the dealer. I kept
my mouth shut and took the rap.

170
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:17,195
If he didn't send fifty a month
regular, how much did he?

171
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:20,856
Well he sent fifty but not regular. You
see Vi had to kick in for me sometimes.

172
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:27,867
She took good care of you?
Had fun with her?

173
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:34,174
Yeah, but not like when you're here.
It was terrible being alone Frankie.

174
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:39,479
And my legs when they hurt, she don't
massage like you when they hurt.

175
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,588
What do they say by the clinic, Zosh?

176
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:47,322
I stopped going by that goofy clinic.

177
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:51,156
The clinic must know what's right, Zosh.
You gotta' start the clinic again.

178
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:52,525
You gotta' get well.

179
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:55,523
Vi dreamed that this new doctor
round the corner he cured me.

180
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:58,902
I'd have gone to him already
but he ain't free like the clinic.

181
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:02,435
Now your back making money
again by Schwiefka, I'll go.

182
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:06,834
I've finished with Schwiefka,
I don't deal for him no more.

183
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,580
But you always deal. You're a dealer;
you're the best dealer in the business.

184
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:14,017
No more. I'm a drummer now.

185
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:20,025
Don't make jokes Frankie. I never
know when you're making jokes.

186
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:22,661
Who's joking, Zosh. Listen...

187
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,660
Nice, huh?

188
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,161
This Doctor Lennox,
I told him my whole life story.

189
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:40,401
From when I was born almost.
About you and me. But he told me

190
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:44,346
that if I lived when I got out like I lived
before I went in there, the chances are

191
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:49,250
I'd be hooked in no time. So
that's why I want to get with a band.

192
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:52,451
Listen...

193
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:58,867
How's that?

194
00:13:59,598 --> 00:14:04,058
Cute. What did you tell
him about me, this doctor?

195
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:10,231
I told him about getting some money,
getting you well. And he said

196
00:14:10,342 --> 00:14:13,004
getting with a band
was a good way to go at it.

197
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:16,713
He even gave me the name of a
guy in town, right here, to get a job.

198
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:20,314
That's nice. I mean if this man with
a job ever heard of this great doctor.

199
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:22,819
Most times these things
just don't come through.

200
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:25,954
I got this.

201
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:27,283
What is it?

202
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:28,724
It's a letter from the doc.

203
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:31,559
I think I'll go call him now.

204
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:33,756
Now. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

205
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,493
I'll be right up, Zosh.

206
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:37,901
You ain't even tasted the cake.

207
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,801
I'll only be a minute. I'll be right up.

208
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:41,304
No! Now! Frankie.

209
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:49,509
First taste a piece of nice...

210
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:51,082
(door slams shut)

211
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,480
cake.

212
00:14:58,624 --> 00:14:59,989
Hey, are you coming baby?

213
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:02,260
(Molly )
Yeah, yeah I'm coming Johnny.

214
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:09,925
Hey Molly.

215
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,003
(Molly ) Yeah I'm coming, Johnny.

216
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:18,738
I want to talk to Mr Harry Lane please?

217
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,371
How about it, huh?

218
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,647
Machine, Frankie Machine.

219
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:25,182
Yeah, I got a letter of introduction
for him from Doctor Lennox.

220
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,424
Yeah.

221
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:28,419
Hello Frankie.

222
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:31,650
Doctor Martin Lennox.

223
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:34,289
How have you been, Molly?

224
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:35,727
Alright.

225
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,127
(Jack) C'mon baby, let's go.

226
00:15:37,363 --> 00:15:41,390
Yeah, I'm coming Johnny.
I guy I met while you was away.

227
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,430
Mr Lane, I got a letter for you, yeah.

228
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:47,864
C'mon on, what do you say, kid?

229
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,134
This afternoon, huh? Well gee,
I sure do appreciate it Mr Lane,

230
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:54,804
thank you so much.
Ok, goodbye.

231
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,450
Frankie, a new thing by
Bracks department store.

232
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,714
No sales girls you just help yourself.

233
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:08,523
It's what they call our honour system.
What's the matter, Frankie?

234
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:15,791
Feel that material. And I figured
as long as I'm there. Nice, huh?

235
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,170
Are you alright? Frankie?

236
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,864
I got the drumming job.

237
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:24,305
Already. Wow!

238
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,237
When I move I move
like a streak, punk.

239
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:33,283
Think it looks alright, Zosh?

240
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:38,081
How come you ask me all of a sudden?

241
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:41,651
I just want to know
if it looks alright, Zosh.

242
00:16:42,594 --> 00:16:44,687
And my name ain't Zosh it's Sophia.

243
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,460
What's the matter?

244
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,869
Nothing's the matter. Except how would
you feel if your spine was hurting?

245
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,107
Why didn't you say so?

246
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,571
On account it's your first day back,
I just didn't want you should worry.

247
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:04,515
Don't be like that Zosh. Is it bad?

248
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:07,708
Maybe the new doctor
will do me some good, huh?

249
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,655
We'll go see him when I get back.

250
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:12,724
Take me now, Frankie.

251
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:16,089
Zosh, I got this appointment,
you know how much it means to me.

252
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,358
We'll go as soon as I get back.

253
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,598
Please, Frankie.

254
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,064
I'll hurry, I'll hurry.

255
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,432
Frankie, give me a little
more massage then, first, huh?

256
00:17:25,938 --> 00:17:30,307
Zosh, I'm doing this for you to get some
money so you can get a good doctor.

257
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:32,141
Oh, please, Frankie.

258
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:35,246
Look I'll get you a dog too, how's
that, huh? Get her a dog, will you.

259
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,315
I'll give the matter
my personal attention.

260
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,384
Just have confidence
in the management.

261
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,117
Wish me luck Zosh.

262
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,926
Frankie.

263
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:50,902
Oh, Frankie.

264
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:53,961
Wait, wait Frankie.

265
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,728
Can't be two places at once.
What could I do?

266
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:33,236
- Yes, she just don't realise.
- Shut-up punk, she just don't realise.

267
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:35,602
How would you like
to be nailed to a chair?

268
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:36,968
(Loud noise of tapping on window).

269
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,615
Frankie, Frankie how are ya? Antek!

270
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:52,289
Well it didn't do you no harm did it,
Frankie? Oh you look good.

271
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:55,084
That's right Schwiefka,
it was a real country club.

272
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:58,823
Mmm. They give you this
when they let you out?

273
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:01,456
Give him nothin'; I bought it by Bracks.

274
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:05,870
You know I come as soon as hear
you're out. I figured he's worried about

275
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:09,531
getting his job again. Tell him don't
worry, Schwiefka don't forget so quick.

276
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:11,668
Job's waitin'.

277
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:13,406
You need a dealer you say?

278
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:16,571
Need. No. I've been
dealing myself and man

279
00:19:16,682 --> 00:19:18,741
I've built up a game
like nobody's business.

280
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,841
I got a great following.
They're playing bigger than ever.

281
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:22,885
I hear you wasn't doin' so good.

282
00:19:23,021 --> 00:19:27,424
From who? When I say great,
I don't mean a lot. A few but loaded.

283
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:29,489
So what do you want me for?

284
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:32,155
Like I'm tellin' ya,
I take care of my friends.

285
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,266
Can I polish your halo, Schwiefka?
Only a quarter.

286
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:39,501
Knock it off punk.
Look I've been doin' alright.

287
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:43,038
But I don't say that the customers
like me better than like you.

288
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,405
The dealer makes the house,
I know that.

289
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:47,640
Wha d'ya say?

290
00:19:47,746 --> 00:19:48,753
No.

291
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,873
You're dealing for some other joint.

292
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,952
I ain't dealing for nobody.
I ain't dealing for nobody no more.

293
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:58,412
Is that the way you repay me? Didn't I
send money to Zosh? Here I've gone

294
00:19:58,523 --> 00:20:01,583
and told all my friends,
that you'll be working for me again.

295
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:03,490
What am I supposed to do?

296
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:05,927
As far as I'm concerned you
can go back to matching pennies

297
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:07,225
with school kids.

298
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,001
Hey Antek. Antek!

299
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:14,930
Who is he?

300
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,605
Drunky. His name's Johnny somethin'.

301
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,871
He's houseman for
Gubercek's poolroom.

302
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,439
Is that a thing with them?

303
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:25,675
They see each other.
You wanna' meet him?

304
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:28,216
No. So long Antek.

305
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:29,647
See ya Frankie.

306
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,125
Hey you.

307
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:39,825
Get in dealer.

308
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,688
Who me? What for?

309
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,357
You too punk.

310
00:20:43,502 --> 00:20:46,164
I didn't do nothin'.
Hey wait a minute Kvorka, listen,

311
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:48,629
I'm on my way to get a job,
it's important to me.

312
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:52,039
You can pick me up some other time,
I just need an hour.

313
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,677
Be a good guy, will ya?

314
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:55,212
Shut up, get in.

315
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:06,491
What are ya talking Kvorka?
Are you looking to get sued for libel

316
00:21:06,591 --> 00:21:08,889
or somethin'? I could sue you right now.

317
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,357
You're looking good dealer, real good.
When did they let you out?

318
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:15,259
Monday, they let me out.

319
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,958
What's the charge, Kvorka?

320
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,094
Shoplifting by Bracks. This suit.

321
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:20,865
Who told you a thing like that?

322
00:21:20,972 --> 00:21:22,098
A little bird.

323
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,798
A little bird with a cigar.

324
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:25,905
Schwiefka!

325
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:29,742
That all you could stay out of trouble,
two days? Dealer, dealer.

326
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,612
Listen Bednar I've got a chance for
a job playing with a band. Honest.

327
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:35,753
If you don't believe me call the
guy on the phone, he'll tell you.

328
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:38,421
Well just give me a half-hour, please.

329
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:40,388
Sure you can wear my badge, too.

330
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:42,255
Book 'em and hold these two.

331
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:44,591
Look all I need is a half-hour.
Give me a break, will ya?

332
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:46,523
I don't make the rules, dealer.

333
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,499
(Man singing in background)

334
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:56,574
Now listen I tell ya you can't
hold me I'm unincapable.

335
00:21:57,075 --> 00:22:00,943
I ain't smart enough to be runnin'
around loose, but I'm too goofy

336
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:04,277
to be locked up.
The neck, will ya let go of the neck?

337
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:06,010
I gotta' complaint to make.

338
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,585
Let go of the neck.

339
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:09,915
Hey you, I'm talkin' to you.

340
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,549
Oh, the old silent treatment, huh.

341
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:15,455
Alright, let's have your number fella'.

342
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:17,695
I'll show you, you can't give
me the business.

343
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:19,961
Your goose is cooked, copper.

344
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:35,904
Frankie, you gotta' cigarette?

345
00:22:40,786 --> 00:22:42,583
Do a cigarette trick.

346
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:46,717
You know just to break
the daily monotony.

347
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:00,102
Wow!

348
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:04,670
Dealer...

349
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,212
Hello dealer,
I come runnin' as soon as I heard.

350
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:22,316
You want I should get you out dealer?

351
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:24,392
You fink.

352
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:28,090
The store will drop the charges.
Thirty-seven buck's a lot of dough.

353
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:30,792
How do I know you'll pay me back?

354
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:32,299
You fink.

355
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:35,599
It would be different
if you was dealing for me.

356
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:38,870
If you wanna' deal
for me I can get you out.

357
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:40,905
Dirty lousy stool pigeon.

358
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:45,448
I don't know what you mean.
Just tryin' to do you a favour.

359
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:50,250
Yes or know?

360
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,456
Ok.

361
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:05,835
Took off like a whipped dog.
He's scared of you Frankie.

362
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:10,032
Nobody's ever been scared of me.

363
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:14,602
Them krauts were scared of you.
You was a big man in the army.

364
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:19,149
Big man. I was the guy picked
the fly spots outa' the black pepper.

365
00:24:21,553 --> 00:24:22,815
Get me out!

366
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:24,815
Get me out!

367
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:26,981
Get me out!

368
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:35,324
I need a fix.

369
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:37,699
I wanna' fix!

370
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:39,871
Can you get me a fix!

371
00:24:40,705 --> 00:24:42,673
Can you get me a fix!

372
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:45,206
I wanna' fix.

373
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:58,321
(Frankie)
Jacks check, bullet say a buck.

374
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:00,582
Big aces here we go down and dirty.

375
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:02,159
Better luck next time, friend.

376
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:05,726
(Frankie) Man with a
hammer bums a buck. Jack calls.

377
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:08,759
Bucket of paint all red.

378
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:10,074
Coffee.

379
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:13,793
Doesn't mean a thing if you haven't
got the king. Winner every hand.

380
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:17,363
You bet more you get more.
Slip me half make me laugh.

381
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:22,609
You still take tips dealer? Or don't
they pay so good in the music game?

382
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:27,718
What happened to that big job you
had lined up? You stink out the joint?

383
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,783
Give us a fresh deck.

384
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,517
I decide when we need
a fresh deck at this table.

385
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:35,684
Hey Louie borrow me a dirty dollar.

386
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,484
Get back on the door lame brain.

387
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,964
I take orders only from Frankie.

388
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:41,990
Don't give me lip you
cheap little hustler.

389
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,894
Hustler, schmustler,
I'm the jib compared to some.

390
00:25:45,437 --> 00:25:48,099
Ain't no fourteen-year-old
junkies waitin' around to see me.

391
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:51,374
You wanna' die?

392
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:56,571
And here we go down and dirty.

393
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,029
Hey.

394
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:08,115
I'll deal the next one down.

395
00:26:11,496 --> 00:26:12,503
Sorry.

396
00:26:13,264 --> 00:26:16,461
What's it a sign of when
a dealer's hands begin to shake?

397
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:20,732
Schwiefka take the slot
for a while, will ya'?

398
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:26,101
Alright men, new deal.

399
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,740
Ok men here we go,
down and dirty. Ace, seven.

400
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,068
You know what's eating at you.

401
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:53,797
You shot off the mouth
about kicking it for keeps.

402
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:57,500
So now you're ashamed for even
thinkin' well, what you're thinkin'.

403
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,108
Ain't that right?

404
00:26:59,844 --> 00:27:02,540
You know I don't talk about my
customers, so who'll be the wiser?

405
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:07,909
Why fight it dealer, for whom,
for what? Come over my place.

406
00:27:09,054 --> 00:27:10,146
What do you say?

407
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,381
Huh?

408
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:17,993
I'll be around.

409
00:27:38,683 --> 00:27:40,913
(Sound of band playing)

410
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:14,145
They tell me you was working here,
and I was passing by, and I thought

411
00:28:14,252 --> 00:28:15,810
I'd come in and have a drink.

412
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:17,487
I've been here a while.

413
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:19,348
Doin' any good?

414
00:28:19,457 --> 00:28:23,086
Alright. Small kind of a game.
Usual kind of drinks.

415
00:28:23,962 --> 00:28:25,327
Ain't got all night Jack.

416
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:27,926
Rye. Have some.

417
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:29,774
Rye.

418
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,161
Two doubles.

419
00:28:31,703 --> 00:28:33,671
You didn't have to do that, Frankie.

420
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:36,841
No reason you should go losin' money,
by wastin' your time talking to me.

421
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:40,904
You know you're no waste.
I've been hopin' you'd come to see me.

422
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:44,615
You know how it is, Molly.

423
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,174
Sure. So busy and all.

424
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,520
Here's to it Molly-O.

425
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:02,532
Molly-O. I ain't heard that
since you went away.

426
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:09,564
You're lookin' good Frankie.

427
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:11,072
Feel good.

428
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,374
They tell me you're goin'
be a drummer now.

429
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:16,609
Yeah, I've got an appointment
with a man tomorrow.

430
00:29:17,248 --> 00:29:18,715
That's swell.

431
00:29:19,617 --> 00:29:21,141
Probably I won't get the job, though.

432
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:22,393
Sure you will.

433
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,851
Molly, I don't play good enough.

434
00:29:23,955 --> 00:29:25,115
I bet you play fine.

435
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,753
You was always whistlin' and drummin'
on tables and things. Real good too.

436
00:29:29,294 --> 00:29:30,556
Haa.

437
00:29:30,962 --> 00:29:33,522
I mean it. You've got a natural rhythm.

438
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:39,235
I was thinkin' maybe I'd take
a stage name. Jack Duvall.

439
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:42,969
Jack Duvall. Yeah, that's real class.

440
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,300
It is, ain't it?

441
00:29:44,475 --> 00:29:46,841
Oh, it's a swell name.
Just fits you, Frank.

442
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:49,836
This guy I'm gonna' see tomorrow,
he books all the big bands.

443
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:52,212
I get in with him, boy I'll wear a tux.

444
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:54,451
You'll look swell in a tux.

445
00:29:54,552 --> 00:29:56,213
I already got the drums.

446
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:59,217
I need a buck. Ante up kid, huh?

447
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,163
I got lonely.

448
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:21,171
I needed somebody and he's a poor
big guy, who needs somebody too.

449
00:30:23,214 --> 00:30:27,446
Everybody needs somebody.
But you can do better than him.

450
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:29,551
Can I Frankie?

451
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:41,461
Molly I, I thought a lot about
you while I was away.

452
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:44,694
About you and me and Zosh.

453
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:48,201
How it would never work out
between you and me,

454
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:51,137
as long as she was upstairs
sitting in that chair.

455
00:30:53,444 --> 00:30:56,538
It would be different if she didn't
love me and she wasn't so helpless.

456
00:30:58,783 --> 00:31:02,742
You can't make a fool of somebody
who loves you and they're so helpless.

457
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:07,486
That's why I didn't come around sooner.

458
00:31:08,726 --> 00:31:12,492
That's why I ain't comin' around
no more, you understand?

459
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:17,192
Sure, sure I understand.

460
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,131
You're a good girl, Molly.

461
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:26,243
Sure, real good.

462
00:31:29,948 --> 00:31:31,472
Frankie...

463
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:38,149
Good luck
with that fella' tomorrow.

464
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:51,561
You're not the first to come to me
with a letter from Doctor Lennox.

465
00:31:52,337 --> 00:31:54,237
I've taken care of a lot of you people.

466
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:55,636
The doc, he told me.

467
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,709
I like doing it, understand. So don't feel
that this is charity or anything like that.

468
00:32:00,111 --> 00:32:02,306
Now have you played
professionally before?

469
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:03,744
Only down at Lexington.

470
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:05,907
I see, then you wouldn't
mind auditioning?

471
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:07,917
I mean I know some bandleaders
who might have an opening,

472
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:09,884
but they'd have to be sure
that you could play.

473
00:32:09,988 --> 00:32:11,421
Oh, sure, sure.

474
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:14,491
Now alright, then.
There's only one thing Frankie.

475
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:19,727
You see a good many people
like yourself, well they mean well

476
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:23,164
but they're weak.
They let me down.

477
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:28,728
I mean, I go to all this trouble, vouch
for them and they go back on the habit.

478
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:31,772
It makes me look bad.

479
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:34,040
Oh, I wouldn't, honest.

480
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:37,979
Alright, I'm telling you this because,
well, once a man lets me down

481
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:41,051
I'm done with him.
Even if he comes back on his knees.

482
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:44,278
And don't think that
some of them haven't.

483
00:32:44,722 --> 00:32:46,314
I wouldn't let you down Mr. Lane.

484
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:51,689
Good. I'll call you... er... let me see a
week from Friday about noon. Alright?

485
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:55,188
Fine. I sure do appreciate it.

486
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:56,308
Oh, forget it.

487
00:32:56,401 --> 00:32:57,408
Bye.

488
00:32:57,468 --> 00:32:58,475
Good-bye.

489
00:33:05,209 --> 00:33:09,168
Do you like my hair better this way,
or upswept, Frankie, huh?

490
00:33:12,183 --> 00:33:16,847
Well you can at least tell me. It ain't my
fault he don't phone. What did I say?

491
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,923
Just don't hold your breath till you
hear from that guy, that's what I said.

492
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,452
He told you noon and here it
is almost six o'clock already.

493
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:27,219
So how do you still think he'll phone?
Honest, I'm surprised at you.

494
00:33:31,702 --> 00:33:36,002
Oh I just don't want you should
eat your heart out, is all.

495
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,632
Forget the whole thing
Frankie I bet he has.

496
00:33:39,944 --> 00:33:42,936
Do you think he's got nothing
better to do than worry about you?

497
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:46,441
You think he don't sleep nights
on account of Frankie Machine?

498
00:33:47,418 --> 00:33:48,817
Bet he don't get no.

499
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,351
(Phone ringing)

500
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:04,257
Excuse me, uh.

501
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:12,337
Hello. Oh, just a minute, it's for you.

502
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:15,611
Hello.

503
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:23,549
Are you Doctor Dominowski?

504
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:25,144
Yes I came as soon as I could.

505
00:34:33,397 --> 00:34:35,194
Well how are you feeling, little lady?

506
00:34:36,234 --> 00:34:38,930
See, the doc asks how I'm feeling.

507
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:42,266
Ah, we'll have you feel fine
in one, two-a or thre-ee.

508
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:44,499
What is this?

509
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:48,375
It happens friend to be an electric
blood reverser and spine manipulator.

510
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:50,614
It helps to reverse the blood.

511
00:34:51,115 --> 00:34:52,548
What's the gimmick?

512
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,813
Gimmick? It happens so
brother that I am a member

513
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,946
of the American Association
of medical hydrology, psychology

514
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,751
and divine healing.

515
00:35:00,858 --> 00:35:02,086
Where's the socket?

516
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:09,021
Cold hands, poor circulation.
Eat lots of hot things.

517
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:11,802
Chillies, peppers, hot sauces.

518
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:13,165
Pickles?

519
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:15,239
Not more than three a day.

520
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,544
Now lean forward and
we'll vibrate the vertebrae.

521
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:27,612
You know how I got like I am today?
My spine was hurt.

522
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:31,013
Oh, I can see that. The ligatures
in the vertebrae is locked together.

523
00:35:31,722 --> 00:35:33,383
In a car accident I was hurt.

524
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:37,517
Three years go, May 11th. Maybe
you read about it in the papers, huh?

525
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:46,899
This is the car it happened in.
That's me laying there.

526
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:49,697
My husband was the one driving
the car and he was drunk.

527
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:50,933
Drunk, eh?

528
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:52,975
He got me in this accident
and smashed me up good,

529
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:55,375
so I can walk no more,
dance no more, nothin'.

530
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:58,211
He married me right here
in the hospital chapel.

531
00:35:58,349 --> 00:35:59,407
Zosh!

532
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,251
(Sound of door slamming)

533
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:11,862
Feeling a little better?

534
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,125
Uhuh. Much better.

535
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:36,417
Help yourself. Hey Frankie
guess what, I got that dog for Zosh.

536
00:36:38,389 --> 00:36:41,586
He drinks beer and every caller
in heaven's a champeen.

537
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:43,758
Champeen of what?

538
00:36:44,061 --> 00:36:47,189
Retrieving. It brings back empties.
Hey I'll show you. Come on beauty.

539
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:49,425
Here get it.

540
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:55,100
He's all dog. You can
make money out of him Frankie.

541
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,438
See what he's good at is
catching them squirrels in the park

542
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:00,339
and shakin' them
dirty peanuts at 'em.

543
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:04,105
You know what I mean? Only thing he's
trained to chase is one kind of squirrel.

544
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:06,583
And they're getting
kinda' rare in Chicago

545
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:09,014
on account of the climate's
changin', know what I mean?

546
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:12,622
So he's just hangin' around waitin'
for the climate to change back a little.

547
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:15,259
He's got a real fightin' heart.

548
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,657
He's dizzy but he's still
in there tryin'.

549
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:27,369
Take the dog up to Zosh.

550
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:29,863
Frankie, can I go with you?

551
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:31,598
No.

552
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,582
(Knock on door)

553
00:37:43,988 --> 00:37:45,421
In a minute dealer...

554
00:38:50,855 --> 00:38:52,823
Five bucks.

555
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:57,894
Last time it was two.

556
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:01,354
That was more than six months
ago, before you went away.

557
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:04,894
They keep raising the price on me.

558
00:39:13,911 --> 00:39:17,244
They keep doin' that, I'll have to
find somethin' to take it's place.

559
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:23,985
Monkey's never dead dealer.
The monkey never dies.

560
00:39:27,258 --> 00:39:32,161
When you kick him off, he just
hides in a corner waitin' his turn.

561
00:39:57,054 --> 00:40:01,081
The monkey'll die waitin'. He ain't
climin' up on my back no more.

562
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:05,261
Never again I mean it.

563
00:40:07,932 --> 00:40:10,423
(Louie) Sure, sure.

564
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:25,705
Look Frankie. Look how he
drinks his- Oh, ain't that cute.

565
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,219
(Telephone ringing)
He's got a thirst like a bar fly.

566
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,015
Ssh. Ssh.

567
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:35,052
(Landlord) Hello.

568
00:40:37,428 --> 00:40:39,328
You still expecting
that connection to call?

569
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:41,824
For your own piece of mind forget him.

570
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:45,697
The doc said I can count on
Mr Lane and the doc doesn't lie.

571
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,501
The doc. Look at me a doc told you I'd
be up and around in no time and am I?

572
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:57,074
Have you seen my sticks?
You seen my drumsticks anywhere?

573
00:40:57,848 --> 00:41:00,214
You know what I'm gonna'
get for this little dog.

574
00:41:00,618 --> 00:41:02,586
A little raincoat like for when it rains.

575
00:41:03,454 --> 00:41:06,252
Plaid maybe. Or maybe all yellow, huh?

576
00:41:07,157 --> 00:41:09,148
Where are my drum sticks Zosh?

577
00:41:11,328 --> 00:41:12,886
How'd they get up here?

578
00:41:12,997 --> 00:41:14,555
You like that didn't ya?

579
00:41:14,798 --> 00:41:16,891
Zosh I never keep them way up here.

580
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:18,992
Drank it all up didn't ya?

581
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:20,468
Zosh!

582
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,942
I put 'em there. I stood right up, walked
right over and I put 'em there. Alright?

583
00:41:31,482 --> 00:41:32,881
No, no kiddin', how?

584
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:35,952
Maybe Vi when she was straighten up
for me. I don't know. Stop pickin' on me.

585
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:49,155
Frankie you can't keep
stoning yourself about it.

586
00:41:51,268 --> 00:41:54,533
There must be a million drummers play
better than you do who can't get jobs.

587
00:41:54,672 --> 00:41:57,300
Just remember that,
your gonna' feel better.

588
00:41:57,908 --> 00:41:59,500
Yeah, sure I will.

589
00:42:00,678 --> 00:42:05,047
Yeah... The noise.

590
00:42:20,364 --> 00:42:21,626
What's this for Zosh?

591
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,343
What?

592
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:27,062
Oh, Vi she laid out for groceries.

593
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:31,240
We owe her even more. You got any?

594
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:33,834
No.

595
00:42:35,145 --> 00:42:37,807
I don't know what we're
doin' with all our money.

596
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:45,781
Don't you get enough
cards by Schwiefka.

597
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:48,748
I just do it to kill the pastime, that's all.

598
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,328
What about my pastime?

599
00:42:53,297 --> 00:42:55,265
What did you say this is for?

600
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:57,924
Sit here all the time;
you don't even talk to me.

601
00:42:59,903 --> 00:43:02,371
We got any more beer? I'd like some.

602
00:43:04,675 --> 00:43:07,940
Beer bloats Zosh, when you
can't exercise. Here pick a card.

603
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:11,708
Everything's no good for me.
I'm only twenty-five and it's like

604
00:43:11,815 --> 00:43:15,182
I'm an old lady already.
Is it my fault I can't exercise?

605
00:43:16,854 --> 00:43:19,118
You wanna' pick a card,
or don't you wanna' pick a card?

606
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:23,182
No, I don't wanna' pick a card.
All I want is just a little.

607
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:25,822
A little what, Zosh?

608
00:43:26,997 --> 00:43:28,004
Just a little...

609
00:43:30,968 --> 00:43:33,163
A little beer, a little fun, a little anything.

610
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:36,604
I can't dance no more. I can't swim.
I can't even drink beer.

611
00:43:37,441 --> 00:43:39,671
I don't even know what
kinds they got anymore.

612
00:43:41,178 --> 00:43:43,738
What are the kinds they've
got these days, Frankie?

613
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:47,774
Alright, pretend like I ain't here.

614
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,287
It's what you're all the time wishing
anyway, that I got killed that night.

615
00:43:51,522 --> 00:43:53,490
I don't wish any such thing.

616
00:43:55,325 --> 00:43:58,294
If I don't talk you get mad.
If I say anything you bite my head off.

617
00:43:59,563 --> 00:44:01,861
I don't know whether I'm coming
or going anymore Zosh.

618
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:07,633
I told you it gives me headaches.

619
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:11,736
I gotta' practice sometimes, Zosh.
If a job comes along I wanna' be ready.

620
00:44:13,043 --> 00:44:16,501
The job, the job. Take 'em down
to your girl-friend if you gotta' practice.

621
00:44:25,823 --> 00:44:26,830
What?

622
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,851
Take them down and
give her the headache.

623
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,929
Do you know what you're saying, Zosh?
Do you know what you're talkin' about?

624
00:44:38,435 --> 00:44:40,460
Don't give me that innocent look.

625
00:44:40,604 --> 00:44:43,505
I ain't said two words to her
since I come back.

626
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:47,143
Just cos' I sit here; you think
I don't know what goes on.

627
00:44:47,244 --> 00:44:48,802
Not two words.

628
00:44:49,613 --> 00:44:50,944
I know plenty.

629
00:44:56,754 --> 00:44:58,881
Cut it out, will ya, Zosh? Cut it out.

630
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:02,058
Take 'em down to that tramp
if you wanna' make noise.

631
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:04,684
Go on take 'em down to her,
why don't you?

632
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:07,796
Alright, I will.

633
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:20,674
Frankie. Frankie I didn't mean...

634
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,977
(TV sports announcer)
It's a long drive to right field.

635
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:28,609
It's going, going, it's gone,
it's a home run.

636
00:45:29,586 --> 00:45:32,020
If you got two cents for a beer.
If I had fifteen I'd be alright.

637
00:45:32,556 --> 00:45:34,990
I got six cents here. Here you are.

638
00:45:35,092 --> 00:45:36,101
Thanks.

639
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,390
I ain't gonna' stand it much longer.
The heartaches my old man gives me.

640
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:45,332
You know what he likes to do most?
Tear the dates off the calendar.

641
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:49,362
Watching him, that's supposed to
be my big Saturday night pleasure.

642
00:45:50,674 --> 00:45:53,871
Sometimes he loses all control and
tears off a whole week's at once,

643
00:45:53,977 --> 00:45:55,945
bleatin' like a Billy goat.

644
00:45:56,613 --> 00:45:58,672
You know what would fill up
that empty spot in your life?

645
00:45:58,982 --> 00:45:59,944
Yeah.

646
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:03,351
A dog. Hey here's a satisfied customer.
Frankie that dog I got you,

647
00:46:03,453 --> 00:46:06,251
makes a big difference
in your life, don't it?

648
00:46:06,356 --> 00:46:07,363
Yeah Big.

649
00:46:10,093 --> 00:46:12,254
(TV sport announcer)
The first baseman London to bat.

650
00:46:12,496 --> 00:46:14,964
I wanna' see you.

651
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:16,555
After the inning.

652
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:18,259
I'll still bet you six to five.

653
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:20,336
(TV announcer)
It's a strike, strike one.

654
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,040
London getting settled in.
London swings and it's a high ball.

655
00:46:29,213 --> 00:46:31,681
Roberts trying to get it.
It may go into the stand.

656
00:46:31,782 --> 00:46:35,343
He's gonna' try, it's gonna' be close.
Roberts makes a tremendous leap

657
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:36,544
and he's got it.

658
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:40,145
How are you Frankie? You make out
alright with the fella' with the job?

659
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:47,295
Oh, the drumming job? Fine, fine. Well
not so fine. He set a top down on me.

660
00:46:49,366 --> 00:46:50,993
He promised to call me, but.

661
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:53,128
It's too bad.

662
00:46:54,004 --> 00:46:56,336
A million drummers
in the world, how do I rate?

663
00:46:57,741 --> 00:46:59,208
Maybe he lost your number.

664
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:00,276
Ha.

665
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:01,505
It happens.

666
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:04,747
Maybe he's just wishing
you'd get in touch.

667
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,618
He'd think I was a pest.

668
00:47:09,419 --> 00:47:12,547
Why should he? A good drummer that's
somethin' that don't turn up very day.

669
00:47:14,024 --> 00:47:16,015
Go on Frankie, call him.

670
00:47:19,196 --> 00:47:20,390
Go on Frankie.

671
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:24,697
(TV announcer) Well it promises
to be quite a ball game, if these first two

672
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:28,032
innings are any indication. Home team
was leading by one run. The only score

673
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:31,733
in the game, thanks to that mighty
swat by Milton in the second innings.

674
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:37,708
Come on Molly, watch the game.

675
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,619
I don't feel like it Johnny, why don't
you go ahead? I'll wait for you.

676
00:47:44,621 --> 00:47:46,987
(TV announcer) This is the
last game here before the team leaves

677
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,148
on a tour trip.

678
00:47:49,927 --> 00:47:53,385
Yes, studio B Monday morning.
Fine, thank you Mr Lane, bye.

679
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,598
Monday I got an audition Monday, me.

680
00:47:58,702 --> 00:48:01,136
He told me to join the union
and be ready to work.

681
00:48:01,238 --> 00:48:02,535
Oh, that's swell Frankie.

682
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:04,903
You know he did lose my number.
He's been tryin' to find me

683
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:07,374
all week long. Here I was
ready to forget the whole thing.

684
00:48:07,477 --> 00:48:09,536
Gee, if you hadn't opened your
mouth I wouldn't have called him.

685
00:48:09,646 --> 00:48:10,653
I'm sure you would.

686
00:48:10,714 --> 00:48:13,512
I've got an audition
with a big band. Me on TV.

687
00:48:13,884 --> 00:48:15,351
Practice a lot Frankie.

688
00:48:15,452 --> 00:48:19,752
Practice, I'll beat those heads to a
shred. Only I gotta' find a place, where.

689
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:22,120
Zosh can't stand the noise.

690
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:28,987
Molly? You suppose maybe
I could put the drums in your place?

691
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:35,668
And sorta' drop in once in a while?
Why not? Molly, why not?

692
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,237
Oh, Johnny wouldn't understand.

693
00:48:42,279 --> 00:48:43,974
So what could he do?

694
00:48:44,448 --> 00:48:46,439
It ain't a question
what he could do, Frankie.

695
00:48:48,352 --> 00:48:50,343
A fella' like Johnny
can't do much about anything.

696
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:55,089
It's a question of what it does to him.
I'm all he has in the world.

697
00:48:55,726 --> 00:48:57,159
I don't want to hurt him.

698
00:48:57,394 --> 00:48:59,362
Molly, for crying out loud.

699
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:02,359
Oh, you don't know,
Frankie, a fella' like him.

700
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,869
Sometimes when we're alone...

701
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:09,728
What does he do, cry?
He's a lush, Molly.

702
00:49:10,374 --> 00:49:12,604
He's a hundred per cent habitual drunk.

703
00:49:13,377 --> 00:49:16,369
Look, everybody's an habitual
somethin'. With him it's liquor is all.

704
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,771
Please, Molly. Molly-O.

705
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:21,173
It ain't just that Frankie.

706
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,684
I don't want it to start
with each other again.

707
00:49:26,723 --> 00:49:29,886
Look what you said about us
not being good, it was the truth.

708
00:49:32,729 --> 00:49:34,890
Even before you went away,
I tried to...

709
00:49:38,168 --> 00:49:41,433
It just doesn't add up.
Never did, it never can.

710
00:49:41,638 --> 00:49:44,607
Give it a chance.
I told you it would one day.

711
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:47,910
All my life has been one day.

712
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,081
On and on, and on.

713
00:49:52,315 --> 00:49:56,274
I got drums I'm headed for a good job.
Is that so on and on and on.

714
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,183
I make some money, make Zosh well.
What's so on and on about that?

715
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,517
Don't shut me out Molly, I'm tryin'.

716
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:05,762
Did you want to see me?

717
00:50:05,862 --> 00:50:07,056
No.

718
00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:09,265
What do you mean, no?

719
00:50:15,272 --> 00:50:18,673
Vi. Here, what we owe.

720
00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:21,370
Frankie, Vi says can she trust me.

721
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:24,003
Tell her Frankie what
an honest hustler I am.

722
00:50:25,348 --> 00:50:29,409
Frankie, I guess maybe
you could drop in once in a while.

723
00:50:34,224 --> 00:50:35,316
Thanks, Molly-O.

724
00:50:41,865 --> 00:50:44,265
(Sound of Traffic noises )

725
00:51:11,661 --> 00:51:14,129
(Sound of Rumba band
playing on the radio)

726
00:52:02,812 --> 00:52:04,074
How's that?

727
00:52:04,314 --> 00:52:05,474
Real nice.

728
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:12,054
You should have heard what
I did with Perdido a little while ago.

729
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:15,549
Good, huh? I hope
the neighbours liked it too.

730
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:19,254
I'm very big with the neighbours.

731
00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:22,498
They keep banging on the pipes to let
me know how much they appreciate it.

732
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,993
I won't let it go
to my head though.

733
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:31,004
Well keep playing drums at five am;
you'll see what goes to your head.

734
00:52:36,012 --> 00:52:38,708
You slip me a smile,
I might give you my autograph.

735
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:42,312
You won't have to fight your way
through the bobby-soxers to get to me.

736
00:52:42,686 --> 00:52:44,950
I bet those bobby-soxers
go for you, at that.

737
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:46,451
Ah.

738
00:52:51,995 --> 00:52:53,121
You tired?

739
00:52:54,331 --> 00:52:57,323
But in a very nice way.
I've been feelin' good all night.

740
00:53:00,203 --> 00:53:02,171
I joined the Musicians Union today.

741
00:53:02,272 --> 00:53:04,263
Schwiefka loan you the money?

742
00:53:04,374 --> 00:53:05,381
Him.

743
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:07,234
Who did?

744
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:10,512
Nobody. I'm gonna' hock the drums.

745
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:12,608
Oh, Frankie. No.

746
00:53:12,716 --> 00:53:14,684
I got it figured out pretty good.

747
00:53:14,784 --> 00:53:17,617
When I get a job I'll take an
advance, I'll get the drums out again.

748
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:19,689
Meantime I'll use a practice pad.

749
00:53:20,056 --> 00:53:21,455
You should have asked Schwiefka.

750
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:23,717
Haven't even seen him.

751
00:53:24,094 --> 00:53:26,062
You didn't go the work?

752
00:53:26,229 --> 00:53:29,756
I've been practicing here all night.
I quit the game Molly.

753
00:53:31,468 --> 00:53:34,130
It wouldn't have hurt you
to wait a coupla' days Frank.

754
00:53:35,538 --> 00:53:38,666
I wanted to quit.
I'm quitting a couple of things.

755
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:47,476
Is it bad?

756
00:53:50,954 --> 00:53:52,546
Not too bad.

757
00:53:57,093 --> 00:53:59,425
You shouldn't have started again.

758
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:02,498
Who knows why
I started in the first place?

759
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,669
I guess in the beginning
it grew on me for kicks.

760
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:12,501
Louie gave me my first shot for nothin'.

761
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:16,805
I thought I could take it or leave it alone.

762
00:54:17,447 --> 00:54:20,075
So I took it and I took again and again.

763
00:54:22,419 --> 00:54:24,819
One day Louie wasn't around.

764
00:54:25,121 --> 00:54:27,316
I nearly went crazy till I found him.

765
00:54:29,259 --> 00:54:30,692
Oh, I was sick.

766
00:54:32,996 --> 00:54:34,588
I was so sick.

767
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:38,324
You can't be that sick and live.

768
00:54:40,203 --> 00:54:41,500
That's why I knew I was hooked.

769
00:54:43,306 --> 00:54:45,968
There was a forty-pound
monkey on my back.

770
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:52,674
The only way to get along with a load
like that is to keep leaning on a fix.

771
00:54:55,585 --> 00:54:57,644
(Molly starts sobbing)

772
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:02,382
Don't.

773
00:55:04,994 --> 00:55:06,086
Don't.

774
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:10,458
I'm one of the lucky ones Molly.

775
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:16,835
I kicked it and I'm not too far hooked
to kick it again. I've had my last fix.

776
00:55:17,907 --> 00:55:19,374
I mean it, Molly.

777
00:55:21,745 --> 00:55:23,337
Tell me somethin. '

778
00:55:23,646 --> 00:55:26,046
You think those bobby-soxers
will really go for me?

779
00:55:29,185 --> 00:55:31,210
You can be such a ham.

780
00:55:34,424 --> 00:55:37,393
Yeah maybe I'll get Sparrow
a job with the orchestra.

781
00:55:39,596 --> 00:55:42,531
Or when I can put enough
money together I can get Zosh

782
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:46,591
into a real good hospital,
so she can walk and dance again.

783
00:55:50,073 --> 00:55:51,370
And then maybe.

784
00:57:27,136 --> 00:57:28,660
(Loud knocking on door)

785
00:57:29,138 --> 00:57:30,469
Who is it?

786
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:32,564
Schwiefka, open up.

787
00:57:33,343 --> 00:57:34,350
Just a minute.

788
00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:43,609
Alright, alright where is he?
Good morning Mrs. Machine.

789
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,812
Frankie?

790
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:47,219
- Frankie where is he?
- What is it? What did he do?

791
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:50,392
What did he do? You know what he did.
He quit. No notice, no nothin'.

792
00:57:50,493 --> 00:57:53,929
He sends word by that misfit that he's
through. I had to take the slot myself.

793
00:57:54,097 --> 00:57:55,860
Where is he?

794
00:57:56,699 --> 00:57:58,997
Oh, he wasn't at the game?

795
00:57:59,102 --> 00:58:02,629
Would we be looking for him all over, if
he was at the game? He eats my bread,

796
00:58:02,739 --> 00:58:06,072
six years he eats my bread. He gets
put away I sent you money regular.

797
00:58:06,175 --> 00:58:08,234
He gets out, I give him his job back.

798
00:58:08,344 --> 00:58:10,369
- Shut-up.
- What do you mean, shut-up?

799
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,244
Shut-up. Do you think it was easy
talkin' fellas' like Williams and Markette

800
00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:14,873
up to a two-bit game like yours, huh?

801
00:58:14,984 --> 00:58:16,008
Louie, Louie I.

802
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:18,553
- I sold them on Frankie.
- Why are we getting' excited?

803
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:21,624
They're fat in the pocket
and hungry for action.

804
00:58:21,724 --> 00:58:24,887
We finally get a chance to score big,
and you lose the dealer.

805
00:58:26,329 --> 00:58:28,889
Look Louie, I swear, I swear
when Markette and Williams come

806
00:58:28,998 --> 00:58:31,432
the dealer will be there.
Or a player just as good.

807
00:58:31,568 --> 00:58:34,230
There ain't none as good.
Why didn't you offer him more money?

808
00:58:34,337 --> 00:58:36,805
- A piece of the play.
- From your end or mine?

809
00:58:36,906 --> 00:58:38,703
What's the difference who's end?

810
00:58:38,808 --> 00:58:41,538
Do you expect me to stand here
and argue about pennies?

811
00:58:43,146 --> 00:58:44,155
Your end.

812
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:55,183
Look, I'm a musician.

813
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,626
Well how does it feel?

814
00:58:57,727 --> 00:59:01,754
Well, it feels like. You'd better hang on
to my arm or I'll go up like a balloon.

815
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:05,225
I'm a musician. Hmm Hmm.

816
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:08,094
Where are we going?

817
00:59:08,204 --> 00:59:10,263
I don't know, but
I want to buy you somethin'

818
00:59:10,373 --> 00:59:11,635
Oh, no.

819
00:59:11,774 --> 00:59:14,641
I gotta' spend some money or I'll bust.
How about one of those in green?

820
00:59:15,111 --> 00:59:16,442
Frankie.

821
00:59:16,579 --> 00:59:18,706
Maybe a colour TV set.

822
00:59:18,815 --> 00:59:20,180
Go on.

823
00:59:22,151 --> 00:59:25,416
Would you look at this production?
And only for cookin'.

824
00:59:26,055 --> 00:59:30,287
Now who would want a thing like that?
Boy, it's goofy, huh?

825
00:59:31,894 --> 00:59:35,295
It's pretty, huh?
I wonder what he does for a living?

826
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:37,093
Him?

827
00:59:38,434 --> 00:59:41,403
Well, must make a nice dollar.
Look the way he dresses her.

828
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:44,696
- A kitchen like that.
- I notice he don't help her none though.

829
00:59:44,807 --> 00:59:46,672
I bet he didn't even marry the girl.

830
00:59:46,776 --> 00:59:48,869
Look at that she ain't even
wearing a ring on her finger.

831
00:59:48,978 --> 00:59:51,208
She takes it off
when she cooks, maybe.

832
00:59:51,614 --> 00:59:54,014
And he's tired after a hard day's work.

833
00:59:54,283 --> 00:59:57,514
Alright, so let him sit there, but at least
he could talk to her once in a while.

834
00:59:57,954 --> 01:00:00,479
He doesn't have to sit there with
his nose buried in a magazine.

835
01:00:00,657 --> 01:00:01,885
I would talk to her.

836
01:00:02,025 --> 01:00:03,322
What would you say?

837
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:07,691
Oh, I'd say how you been?
How did it go today? What's for supper?

838
01:00:07,797 --> 01:00:10,766
Steak. Steak's for supper
and everything went fine today.

839
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,397
Steak? Good. Now how about
you and me stepping out tonight,

840
01:00:14,504 --> 01:00:16,165
after we eat?

841
01:00:16,706 --> 01:00:19,174
Why don't we just stay home?
Turn on some music?

842
01:00:20,376 --> 01:00:25,871
Yeah. I like that better. We'll just
stay home and turn on some music.

843
01:00:28,017 --> 01:00:29,985
I wish it was Monday, already.

844
01:00:33,723 --> 01:00:35,213
Hi Zosh.

845
01:00:35,324 --> 01:00:38,293
Oh, where you been? Schwiefka
was here and said you quit him.

846
01:00:38,528 --> 01:00:39,756
- Where you been?
- Look.

847
01:00:39,862 --> 01:00:41,830
- Why did you quit him?
- I got a try out on Monday.

848
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:44,229
And if the bandleader
likes the way I play, I'm hired.

849
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:47,029
Frankie. Go tell Schwiefka
you was foolin', you'll deal.

850
01:00:47,136 --> 01:00:49,798
Maybe this bandleader
won't like how you play.

851
01:00:49,906 --> 01:00:52,875
Zosh, look I joined the Musicians Union.

852
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:57,776
Why you gotta' go around changin'
things? Why can't it be like always?

853
01:00:58,381 --> 01:01:00,941
Why you gotta' quit dealing, Frankie?

854
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:03,917
How are we gonna' live
with no money coming in?

855
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:07,046
- It'll start coming in, Monday.
- Suppose they call this big try out off?

856
01:01:07,156 --> 01:01:10,319
You can't tell me it's
a sure thing, can you?

857
01:01:10,426 --> 01:01:13,793
Oh Frankie, deal for Schwiefka
like always. Forget this great job.

858
01:01:14,697 --> 01:01:17,632
I quit dealing, Zosh. I can't take
the chance, don't you understand?

859
01:01:17,734 --> 01:01:20,259
If the joint gets raided
and I get picked up again,

860
01:01:20,369 --> 01:01:22,394
Mr Lane would
be through with me.

861
01:01:22,505 --> 01:01:24,564
And then how would
I play with a band?

862
01:01:24,674 --> 01:01:27,336
How are you gonna' play if
Schwiefka gets your arms broke?

863
01:01:27,443 --> 01:01:29,411
Go on.

864
01:01:29,912 --> 01:01:33,040
Yeah, right here he said it. And
he wanted to slap me around too.

865
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,010
Ooh why can't it be like always?

866
01:02:05,111 --> 01:02:06,107
Antek.

867
01:02:12,285 --> 01:02:15,254
You miserable piece of humanity.

868
01:02:15,355 --> 01:02:17,323
I gotta' right to quit if I want.

869
01:02:17,423 --> 01:02:19,015
Markette and Williams
are coming tomorrow,

870
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:20,683
don't you realise
the significance?

871
01:02:20,794 --> 01:02:21,852
Leave me alone.

872
01:02:21,961 --> 01:02:25,658
I'll leave you alone,
in the alley with the cats lookin'.

873
01:02:26,432 --> 01:02:29,492
That's enough Schwiefka. He don't
wanna' deal, he don't wanna deal.

874
01:02:29,669 --> 01:02:31,637
What are you talkin'
about all of a sudden?

875
01:02:31,738 --> 01:02:34,070
Don't raise your voice to me,
you slob.

876
01:02:34,174 --> 01:02:37,234
He's no slave you can't force him,
so what's the use?

877
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:38,741
He er...

878
01:02:38,845 --> 01:02:44,147
You had the best of him all these years.
Don't be a pig. He ain't interested, right?

879
01:02:44,651 --> 01:02:49,020
Alright, alright. Markette and
Williams never heard of them.

880
01:02:49,556 --> 01:02:52,992
Money, somethin' to blow yer nose on.
I'll wash my hands.

881
01:02:56,963 --> 01:03:01,798
He's a pig, is all.
Still you can't blame him so much.

882
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:04,626
Lettin' the big ones get away,
on account of the best dealer

883
01:03:04,737 --> 01:03:07,467
in the business ain't workin'
for you no more.

884
01:03:07,574 --> 01:03:10,839
That ain't easy to swallow.
You're the best alright.

885
01:03:11,744 --> 01:03:14,110
The old squeeze play, huh Louie?

886
01:03:15,381 --> 01:03:17,611
Been tried on you before?

887
01:03:17,884 --> 01:03:20,045
No, I'm new around here.

888
01:03:20,687 --> 01:03:23,349
Are we really askin'
so much dealer? One night.

889
01:03:23,723 --> 01:03:24,951
I'd like to be.

890
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:26,457
You help us make a bundle.

891
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,117
We'll spread a little of
that old sunshine around.

892
01:03:29,362 --> 01:03:30,727
Couldn't you use
a coupla' hundred?

893
01:03:31,698 --> 01:03:33,928
Maybe two... five... O?

894
01:03:36,936 --> 01:03:39,905
Two... five... O
pays a lotta' doctor bills, dealer.

895
01:03:41,774 --> 01:03:43,571
Tomorrow, huh?

896
01:03:43,676 --> 01:03:46,645
- Frankie.
- Let him make up his mind.

897
01:03:48,848 --> 01:03:53,683
Ok, but for one night. Win or lose,
sun up I case the deck.

898
01:03:54,087 --> 01:03:59,582
Sure, you're the dealer. What a load off,
now I can sleep. Take care of that arm.

899
01:04:02,795 --> 01:04:06,492
A character, huh?
Were you jackin' up the price just now,

900
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:09,227
or do you really have this music job?

901
01:04:13,273 --> 01:04:15,434
If they like what they hear.

902
01:04:16,476 --> 01:04:18,706
Chancy, huh?

903
01:04:20,713 --> 01:04:21,771
Nervous?

904
01:04:24,784 --> 01:04:26,752
So what are we waitin' for?

905
01:04:26,986 --> 01:04:30,012
- Don't talk about it, it's tough enough.
- Yeah I know, I know.

906
01:04:31,124 --> 01:04:33,092
I put down a craving once.

907
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,788
No. Candy, sweets.

908
01:04:37,397 --> 01:04:39,365
I used to be eatin' it all the time.

909
01:04:39,465 --> 01:04:42,263
Got examined for the army.
They said you got sugar in your blood.

910
01:04:42,368 --> 01:04:45,201
You've got to give up sweets
forever or it's good-bye Charlie.

911
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:49,508
I had to give up candy.

912
01:04:50,543 --> 01:04:53,341
My gums bleed for you, it's awful.

913
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,140
It was.

914
01:04:55,682 --> 01:04:58,651
That unfinished feelin'
you got all the time.

915
01:04:59,252 --> 01:05:02,187
- Well I don't have to tell you.
- So don't.

916
01:05:02,288 --> 01:05:05,257
I mean you've got this one
thing on your mind all the time.

917
01:05:05,425 --> 01:05:07,393
Can't stop thinkin' about it.

918
01:05:07,493 --> 01:05:09,859
You're just a mine of
information, ain't yer?

919
01:05:09,963 --> 01:05:11,658
You know what I did?

920
01:05:11,864 --> 01:05:14,833
I said to myself, ok,
off sweets forever.

921
01:05:15,168 --> 01:05:17,329
Well forever can start tomorrow.

922
01:05:18,338 --> 01:05:22,001
For once in my life I'm gonna'
eat all the candy that I can hold.

923
01:05:22,408 --> 01:05:25,377
I bought eighteen dollars and
twenty-three cents worth of candy,

924
01:05:25,478 --> 01:05:27,002
lugged it up to my room.

925
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,512
All night long I ate candy.

926
01:05:32,418 --> 01:05:36,878
I was sick I was sweatin'
but I kept shovin' it in.

927
01:05:40,093 --> 01:05:43,028
Ever since then when
I feel like candy, I say to myself,

928
01:05:43,129 --> 01:05:47,088
well you can't complain brother;
you once had it and had it good.

929
01:05:50,169 --> 01:05:52,137
You know what I mean?

930
01:05:58,945 --> 01:06:01,436
(Band playing)

931
01:06:35,882 --> 01:06:38,009
How is it Molly-O?

932
01:06:38,251 --> 01:06:40,412
I'm alright Frankie,
but where you been?

933
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,750
- What'll you have?
- A couple of rye's.

934
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:47,157
All day I was expectin'
you'd be in to practice.

935
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,353
Practice. I'll go down there
and knock 'em dead,

936
01:06:49,996 --> 01:06:52,328
it's all in the wrists and
I got the touch, Molly.

937
01:06:52,432 --> 01:06:55,401
Look at that, steady as a rock,
it'll do anything I want it to do.

938
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,238
Keep the change pal.

939
01:07:01,774 --> 01:07:03,071
Thanks.

940
01:07:03,776 --> 01:07:05,903
You got a cigarette, Frankie?

941
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:07,510
Sure.

942
01:07:23,296 --> 01:07:26,265
You're on it again Frankie. Why? Why?

943
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,468
No listen Molly, listen.

944
01:07:30,169 --> 01:07:31,002
Why?

945
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:32,561
Molly? Molly.

946
01:07:33,139 --> 01:07:34,197
Beat it.

947
01:07:34,307 --> 01:07:35,433
Molly I only wanna'.

948
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:37,065
- Take a walk.
- Don't.

949
01:07:37,176 --> 01:07:39,474
- Molly listen to me, I can explain.
- Molly I just wanna' talk to you.

950
01:07:39,579 --> 01:07:40,512
Will you get outa' here?

951
01:07:40,513 --> 01:07:41,517
Please. Stop.

952
01:07:41,547 --> 01:07:42,280
Molly?

953
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:43,081
Molly please.

954
01:07:43,082 --> 01:07:45,050
- Please don't hurt him.
- Go away.

955
01:07:48,454 --> 01:07:51,423
Are you lookin' to lose your job?
Can't you manage a customer?

956
01:07:51,524 --> 01:07:54,584
- Molly listen to me?
- Let me alone, both of you.

957
01:07:54,694 --> 01:07:55,701
Molly.

958
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,237
Molly!

959
01:08:16,816 --> 01:08:19,944
Molly! Molly! Molly!

960
01:08:22,388 --> 01:08:24,083
Molly, listen to me.

961
01:08:27,326 --> 01:08:29,294
Molly open the door.

962
01:08:30,196 --> 01:08:32,221
Molly will you open the door?

963
01:08:34,734 --> 01:08:37,726
(Frankie)
Molly, Molly let me talk to you, Molly.

964
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:46,944
Molly, Molly open the door.

965
01:08:50,016 --> 01:08:51,483
(Loud knocking on door)

966
01:08:59,225 --> 01:09:00,624
Molly, please.

967
01:09:02,328 --> 01:09:04,853
Where're you going,
Molly? Come here.

968
01:09:04,997 --> 01:09:06,965
Where're you going, Molly?

969
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:09,059
Taxi!

970
01:09:09,235 --> 01:09:11,669
If you'll let me explain,
you'll know why I did it.

971
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:14,296
Molly listen, will you please?
Let me tell you what happened!

972
01:09:14,674 --> 01:09:17,643
Where're you going, Molly?
Tell me where you're going!

973
01:09:18,144 --> 01:09:20,738
No, Molly, Molly!

974
01:10:02,835 --> 01:10:05,269
Don't forget to clean out the caboon.

975
01:10:05,371 --> 01:10:08,863
I already cleaned it. And say please
when you talk to me or I'll buy a caboon

976
01:10:09,008 --> 01:10:13,741
and go into business for myself.
How's that, Frankie? Nothin', huh? Well.

977
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,340
(Knock on door)

978
01:10:16,549 --> 01:10:20,315
I'm reminding you Schwiefka;
I get two, two and a half, maybe more.

979
01:10:20,553 --> 01:10:22,953
Would I go back on my word?

980
01:10:30,596 --> 01:10:32,564
How are ya' feelin' dealer?

981
01:10:35,134 --> 01:10:36,795
Hiya Schwiefka.

982
01:10:36,903 --> 01:10:38,871
A big night tonight.

983
01:10:42,275 --> 01:10:43,970
(Knock on door)

984
01:10:51,184 --> 01:10:52,310
Yeah?

985
01:10:52,418 --> 01:10:53,510
Is this the place?

986
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:56,588
I don't know what place you mean,
buddy? This is the Ellis

987
01:10:56,689 --> 01:10:59,351
belt and leather company.
You wann'a buy an Ellis belt?

988
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:01,925
Come right in, we're just starting.
How'ya been?

989
01:11:02,028 --> 01:11:03,222
Fine, how are you?

990
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:06,623
I could handle the door better
if I was blind.

991
01:11:06,733 --> 01:11:09,497
Go on, you couldn't heat
towels for a scared barber.

992
01:11:09,769 --> 01:11:11,862
- You know Schwiefka?
- Oh sure.

993
01:11:11,971 --> 01:11:13,996
- Glad to have you. Hi.
- Hi.

994
01:11:14,107 --> 01:11:17,167
Are you Machine?
Man with the golden arm, huh?

995
01:11:17,744 --> 01:11:20,144
Let's see you try and take this away.

996
01:11:32,892 --> 01:11:34,951
Here we go down and dirty.

997
01:11:57,316 --> 01:12:00,046
No ladies allowed. You know that Vi.

998
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:02,781
- Is Frankie in there?
- What's the matter?

999
01:12:02,889 --> 01:12:06,017
Zosh, I can't get her to sleep.
She and Frankie had an argument

1000
01:12:06,225 --> 01:12:09,217
and she's almost out of her mind.
Is he in there?

1001
01:12:09,328 --> 01:12:11,990
- Well I can't call him now.
- Well I just wanna' know he's here.

1002
01:12:12,098 --> 01:12:14,532
I've been bounced around
Clark Street like a pull bar.

1003
01:12:14,967 --> 01:12:17,333
He's here, he's here.
I gotta' get back in.

1004
01:12:17,437 --> 01:12:19,268
Well tell him she's worried,
if you get a chance.

1005
01:12:19,372 --> 01:12:20,376
Yeah.

1006
01:12:24,777 --> 01:12:28,406
Three aces, two pairs.
Pass or a straight flush?

1007
01:12:28,915 --> 01:12:30,439
Aces, two hundred.

1008
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:32,982
I'll have twelve and two hundred
and I'll raise you two.

1009
01:12:34,821 --> 01:12:37,813
I'll have a look of four hundred and the
house bumps you three hundred more.

1010
01:12:39,459 --> 01:12:40,721
Up to you aces.

1011
01:12:41,394 --> 01:12:43,385
I don't know I just don't know.

1012
01:12:43,496 --> 01:12:45,487
If you got three aces, show 'em.

1013
01:12:45,598 --> 01:12:48,089
He's got a possible straight flush
to the queen showin'

1014
01:12:48,201 --> 01:12:49,566
I tell you he's bluffing.

1015
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:52,069
I think he bluffed me
out of a couple tonight.

1016
01:12:52,171 --> 01:12:55,140
You wouldn't be jerk enough
to try it again, would you?

1017
01:12:56,209 --> 01:12:59,645
- Bet and find out.
- Bet, bet, I tell you he's a bluff artist.

1018
01:13:01,147 --> 01:13:02,156
Call.

1019
01:13:03,349 --> 01:13:05,874
I'll call it and I raise it five hundred more.

1020
01:13:06,152 --> 01:13:07,085
Sammy!

1021
01:13:07,086 --> 01:13:08,451
I know what I'm doing.

1022
01:13:09,956 --> 01:13:14,017
I'll have a look and the house bumps
you five hundred more.

1023
01:13:16,128 --> 01:13:18,153
I told you, I told you he had it.

1024
01:13:18,264 --> 01:13:20,232
Shut-up will ya' and let me think.

1025
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:21,891
(Frankie) It's up to you.

1026
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:23,866
What's the rush I want to know?

1027
01:13:24,537 --> 01:13:26,505
Your bet two pairs.

1028
01:13:27,707 --> 01:13:30,699
I heard you, I heard you.
What is this a forced joint or somethin'?

1029
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:32,334
A man's gotta' right to study his hand.

1030
01:13:32,445 --> 01:13:33,912
Bet or fold.

1031
01:13:34,013 --> 01:13:35,981
Use your head, Sammy.

1032
01:13:36,082 --> 01:13:38,380
I tell you he's got it, don't
throw good money after bad.

1033
01:13:38,484 --> 01:13:39,781
I know what I'm doing.

1034
01:13:49,862 --> 01:13:51,625
What did you have?

1035
01:13:52,398 --> 01:13:54,389
You didn't pay to find out.

1036
01:13:55,935 --> 01:13:58,062
Nothing. Two lousy nines.

1037
01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:01,071
You let him bluff you out of a
full house with a lousy two nines.

1038
01:14:01,841 --> 01:14:04,810
You do that again at this
table and your through.

1039
01:14:05,411 --> 01:14:08,539
Ah forget it this once dealer.
He paid plenty for it.

1040
01:14:11,717 --> 01:14:14,686
You're good dealer,
maybe too good.

1041
01:14:14,887 --> 01:14:16,650
What do you mean by that?

1042
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:20,058
Cut the talk, deal, deal.

1043
01:14:20,393 --> 01:14:22,361
Punk get some of
this smoke out of here.

1044
01:14:23,262 --> 01:14:25,594
(Frankie) What
do you mean too good?

1045
01:14:25,698 --> 01:14:27,666
(Williams ) If the shoe fits.

1046
01:14:31,771 --> 01:14:33,739
I'm casing the deck it's daylight.

1047
01:14:33,839 --> 01:14:34,839
What?

1048
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,273
Tell him to sit down and deal.

1049
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:38,343
Well we always break up around now.

1050
01:14:38,444 --> 01:14:40,469
- One more round.
- How about my money?

1051
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,571
Put that dealer back in the slot.

1052
01:14:42,782 --> 01:14:45,945
- Frankie, how about it?
- No. Just give me what's coming to me.

1053
01:14:46,052 --> 01:14:47,076
One more hour, huh?

1054
01:14:47,186 --> 01:14:49,950
- I'll deal.
- You. We wanna' play Machine.

1055
01:14:50,056 --> 01:14:53,253
Why you think I can't sell you a thing
or two, huh? Sit down, we'll get going.

1056
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:54,883
- How about my dough?
- As soon as we break.

1057
01:14:54,994 --> 01:14:56,120
Now.

1058
01:14:56,228 --> 01:14:58,958
Give us a chance to count it at least.
Go home, you'll get it later.

1059
01:14:59,065 --> 01:15:01,033
Ok ante up, here we go.

1060
01:15:01,133 --> 01:15:02,828
A hundred it is.

1061
01:15:03,536 --> 01:15:06,972
Yeah a hundred. Ok here we go.

1062
01:15:47,179 --> 01:15:48,806
Good morning, Frankie.

1063
01:17:11,263 --> 01:17:13,254
- Frankie.
- Is Louie still here?

1064
01:17:13,365 --> 01:17:16,596
He's having an apoplexy.
What they're doin' to Schwiefka in there.

1065
01:17:17,103 --> 01:17:19,765
We're getting murdered,
you gotta' take the slot.

1066
01:17:19,872 --> 01:17:22,500
I ain't here for dealing, look.
You gotta' make it stop, Louie.

1067
01:17:22,608 --> 01:17:23,666
No deal no fix.

1068
01:17:23,776 --> 01:17:25,903
Well give me my money,
I'll go see somebody else.

1069
01:17:26,011 --> 01:17:27,808
I can't give you your money now,
the house needs ever cent.

1070
01:17:27,913 --> 01:17:29,778
- You owe it to me.
- Take me to court.

1071
01:17:29,882 --> 01:17:31,850
Please Louie,
you gotta' make it stop.

1072
01:17:31,984 --> 01:17:34,111
I'll take care of you,
just work a few hours.

1073
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:36,211
I wanna' get to sleep,
I gotta' be fresh tomorrow.

1074
01:17:36,322 --> 01:17:38,347
Work a few hours,
do us a favour.

1075
01:17:38,457 --> 01:17:40,482
I'll guarantee you'll feel like
a week in the country.

1076
01:17:40,593 --> 01:17:43,357
- Please Louie, please Louie, now.
- Drop dead.

1077
01:17:43,662 --> 01:17:44,788
Wait a second...

1078
01:17:46,732 --> 01:17:47,742
Ok.

1079
01:17:52,204 --> 01:17:55,173
Louie says you got money for him,
gimme', he's waitin'

1080
01:17:55,274 --> 01:17:56,274
Sparrow?

1081
01:17:56,275 --> 01:17:58,004
- Yeah, Yeah.
- Yeah I know he's waitin'.

1082
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:00,804
I've seen this one and that one
and they all say the same thing.

1083
01:18:01,313 --> 01:18:04,077
Tell Louie like he tells us,
nothin' for nothin'.

1084
01:18:04,717 --> 01:18:05,911
Not a penny?

1085
01:18:06,085 --> 01:18:07,313
Nothin'.

1086
01:18:07,419 --> 01:18:08,716
Hey, how is it up there?

1087
01:18:08,821 --> 01:18:11,585
What a game. Schwiefka
is meltin' away like a dirty candle.

1088
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:15,127
The dealer's losin', huh?
What's happened to that golden arm?

1089
01:18:15,461 --> 01:18:18,430
Don't worry about the dealer, the
game's just goin' on a day and a half,

1090
01:18:18,531 --> 01:18:19,862
he'll come through.

1091
01:18:19,965 --> 01:18:23,799
Why not with those educated fingers.
Now you see it now you don't.

1092
01:18:24,637 --> 01:18:27,663
You keep your dirty mouth of the dealer.
Frankie runs a clean game,

1093
01:18:27,773 --> 01:18:30,435
there ain't nothin' in the world
can make him change decks.

1094
01:18:33,913 --> 01:18:35,175
Hey Antek.

1095
01:18:36,982 --> 01:18:38,973
(Frankie) Ace of hearts.
Eight of spades.

1096
01:18:39,084 --> 01:18:40,086
Alright, alright.

1097
01:18:40,119 --> 01:18:41,313
(Frankie) Six of hearts.

1098
01:18:41,587 --> 01:18:45,079
Can you let me have a thousand?
How about five hundred?

1099
01:18:45,257 --> 01:18:47,054
(Frankie) Two hundred, call.

1100
01:18:47,226 --> 01:18:50,855
I know it's Sunday night.
I didn't call you up to find what day it is.

1101
01:18:51,697 --> 01:18:53,130
(Frankie) House checks to you.

1102
01:18:53,232 --> 01:18:54,563
Yeah, hold it a minute.

1103
01:18:54,667 --> 01:18:56,134
Yeah, hold it.

1104
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:02,266
Gimme' some of that.

1105
01:19:06,645 --> 01:19:10,206
I gotta' get outa' here Louie, I'm dead.
I ain't slept in almost two days.

1106
01:19:10,316 --> 01:19:12,079
Just a little while now.

1107
01:19:13,052 --> 01:19:15,043
It ain't doin' you any good,
the house is still losin'.

1108
01:19:15,855 --> 01:19:18,847
Stay with it dealer. Your class is
beginning to tell. Just stay with it.

1109
01:19:18,991 --> 01:19:20,925
I just can't, my head
won't work no more.

1110
01:19:21,026 --> 01:19:23,017
Louie, Louie I'm runnin'
outa' guys to call.

1111
01:19:23,362 --> 01:19:24,371
Lippy.

1112
01:19:24,496 --> 01:19:26,555
- I can't find him.
- I'll find him he's loaded.

1113
01:19:26,665 --> 01:19:27,757
I'm getting' outa' here.

1114
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:31,994
Just a little longer, while I make a call.
And then I'll take you over to my place.

1115
01:19:40,045 --> 01:19:41,637
Hey, Louie, new bets.

1116
01:19:42,648 --> 01:19:45,242
- House checks.
- Ok I'll bet a hundred.

1117
01:20:03,936 --> 01:20:05,267
Coffee.

1118
01:20:05,437 --> 01:20:06,836
Good and black.

1119
01:20:09,575 --> 01:20:10,803
(Loud knock on door)

1120
01:20:23,155 --> 01:20:25,851
I can't raise another cent.
How's it going?

1121
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:27,721
There're slugging us with their money.

1122
01:20:27,826 --> 01:20:30,795
Every pot almost, they're raisin'
and raisin' until we're forced out.

1123
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:31,988
What day is it?

1124
01:20:32,097 --> 01:20:34,156
Can't you think of anybody
we can tap for a few thousand?

1125
01:20:34,266 --> 01:20:36,734
What day is it? Is it Monday yet?

1126
01:20:38,304 --> 01:20:40,829
Listen to me. Are you listening to me?

1127
01:20:41,273 --> 01:20:42,282
Why? Why?

1128
01:20:42,675 --> 01:20:43,835
Listen to me I said.

1129
01:20:43,943 --> 01:20:46,002
The next big pot they try
to force you up with a raise

1130
01:20:46,145 --> 01:20:47,874
and you gotta' stay with 'em.

1131
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,073
Schwiefka don't let me.
He keeps nudging me to fold.

1132
01:20:50,182 --> 01:20:51,843
That's 'cos he ain't sure you'll win.

1133
01:20:52,117 --> 01:20:53,209
He can't be.

1134
01:20:53,352 --> 01:20:55,286
Sure, there's a way
you can be sure alright.

1135
01:20:55,387 --> 01:20:57,116
You can do anything
you want with those cards.

1136
01:20:57,222 --> 01:20:59,383
That's only for fun;
I haven't got nerve to do it for real.

1137
01:20:59,525 --> 01:21:01,720
- You wanna' get out of here don't you?
- What?

1138
01:21:01,827 --> 01:21:03,795
You wanna' get to that tryout
in good condition, don't you?

1139
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:06,329
Yeah, I wanna' get there feelin' good.

1140
01:21:06,498 --> 01:21:08,398
Well then make sure.
You know what I mean?

1141
01:21:08,934 --> 01:21:12,062
Let's get on with the game.
Let's get on with the game. I feel hot.

1142
01:21:20,012 --> 01:21:21,980
Ok dealer.

1143
01:21:44,436 --> 01:21:46,529
- (Markette) I'm in.
- (Williams ) I'm in.

1144
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:52,343
Three, King, Jack.

1145
01:21:53,212 --> 01:21:54,645
Queen bets a honey.

1146
01:21:55,781 --> 01:21:57,078
Call.

1147
01:21:57,850 --> 01:22:02,116
Pair of treys. King ten,
Jack seven, Pair of treys.

1148
01:22:02,821 --> 01:22:04,482
(Williams ) I bet two hundred.

1149
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,023
(Markette) I call it two.

1150
01:22:07,292 --> 01:22:09,351
House bets two. Comin' out.

1151
01:22:10,362 --> 01:22:12,762
Pair of treys,
pair of Kings, pair of jacks.

1152
01:22:13,032 --> 01:22:15,000
I'm bettin' five hundred.

1153
01:22:19,471 --> 01:22:20,870
House sees.

1154
01:22:20,973 --> 01:22:22,201
(Markette) Call.

1155
01:22:24,109 --> 01:22:30,309
Comin' out. Three treys,

1156
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:33,316
(Williams) Three little treys,

1157
01:22:37,856 --> 01:22:40,381
Why you. Cheatin', huh?

1158
01:22:53,072 --> 01:22:54,096
Take off your glasses?

1159
01:22:54,206 --> 01:22:55,901
- No.
- Take 'em off.

1160
01:22:59,044 --> 01:23:02,536
- I didn't know, I didn't know.
- I'll get to you in a second.

1161
01:23:02,848 --> 01:23:07,012
I didn't know. Eleven years I've been
running this game ask anybody?

1162
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:15,824
You don't deal for me no more.
You want him?

1163
01:23:17,096 --> 01:23:19,087
I wouldn't dirty my hands.

1164
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:23,527
How was I to know? You fellas', you
fellas', do I ever rig an honest game?

1165
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:24,863
Tell 'em, tell em'.

1166
01:23:30,676 --> 01:23:31,768
Frankie?

1167
01:23:34,947 --> 01:23:37,643
Everything's alright now, Frankie.

1168
01:23:40,185 --> 01:23:47,148
Hey Frankie, what's a little cuffin'
around? Nothin'. Am I right?

1169
01:23:51,029 --> 01:23:55,830
You'll see an hour from now we'll
be in Anteks, just laughin' about it.

1170
01:23:57,703 --> 01:24:00,171
You should have seen
Schwiefkas face

1171
01:24:00,272 --> 01:24:03,332
when Williams said
he'll get to him in a minute.

1172
01:24:04,243 --> 01:24:06,609
He went white. It was so funny.

1173
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,471
Cut it out, d'you hear?

1174
01:24:12,217 --> 01:24:15,186
It was the best word I knew,
my whole life.

1175
01:24:15,754 --> 01:24:16,846
Do you hear me?

1176
01:24:20,259 --> 01:24:21,783
Get away from me, punk.

1177
01:24:39,444 --> 01:24:41,412
(Loud knocking on door)

1178
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:50,415
- Louie, quick.
- Don't I get to sleep?

1179
01:24:50,522 --> 01:24:51,524
Louie, please.

1180
01:24:52,691 --> 01:24:56,058
Beginning to wear off quick for you,
ain't it? Your graduating student.

1181
01:24:56,862 --> 01:24:59,888
- You're going to have to step it up.
- Anything, but please hurry.

1182
01:25:00,899 --> 01:25:03,868
Alright, let's see your money.

1183
01:25:04,536 --> 01:25:05,545
Later, later.

1184
01:25:06,471 --> 01:25:07,563
Right now.

1185
01:25:07,739 --> 01:25:10,765
- Trust me this once, will ya'?
- You know I don't do that.

1186
01:25:10,876 --> 01:25:13,344
I'll pay you twice as much later,
but I gotta' do somethin' right now.

1187
01:25:13,478 --> 01:25:14,502
Beat it.

1188
01:25:14,613 --> 01:25:16,581
I'll even push for you Louie. Hurry.

1189
01:25:17,382 --> 01:25:19,407
A flipping junkie always says that.

1190
01:25:19,618 --> 01:25:21,586
Please Louie, please. Please, Louie!

1191
01:25:21,887 --> 01:25:23,445
Get your dirty hands off.

1192
01:25:47,579 --> 01:25:48,773
Frankie.

1193
01:25:48,947 --> 01:25:51,472
- Wake up! Get up!
- No, No.

1194
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:53,141
- Where do you put it?
- Frankie. No!

1195
01:25:53,252 --> 01:25:54,259
Where do you keep it?

1196
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:56,287
No, No Frankie, let go.
Let go Frankie.

1197
01:25:56,788 --> 01:25:58,779
I gotta' find it. I can't find it.

1198
01:25:59,024 --> 01:26:02,551
Frankie let me take you home.
Frankie, please, let me take you home.

1199
01:26:02,661 --> 01:26:04,424
Frankie please.

1200
01:26:05,931 --> 01:26:08,024
I gotta' be on time. I gotta' be on time.

1201
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:15,199
Frankie.

1202
01:26:16,508 --> 01:26:18,332
(Sounds of orchestra rehearsing)

1203
01:26:38,597 --> 01:26:41,657
Wow what's the matter?
Come on let's try to really cook it.

1204
01:26:43,068 --> 01:26:44,077
Mr Machine.

1205
01:26:44,469 --> 01:26:45,169
Mr Lane.

1206
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:46,398
Ok, can you read music?

1207
01:26:46,505 --> 01:26:47,204
Yes.

1208
01:26:47,205 --> 01:26:49,673
Shelley, let Mr Machine
sit in on this one.

1209
01:26:53,812 --> 01:26:55,939
Number thirty-seven,
it's right in front of you.

1210
01:26:58,317 --> 01:27:00,342
You know it, Mr Machine?

1211
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,887
Ok, let's try it. One, two, three, four.

1212
01:27:05,424 --> 01:27:08,393
Mr Machine the first
four bars is all you.

1213
01:27:08,527 --> 01:27:12,930
C'mon let's try it again.
One, two, three, four.

1214
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:16,932
I'm sorry.

1215
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:23,304
Are you all set? Once again,
one, two, three, four...

1216
01:27:59,978 --> 01:28:01,969
Ok, Shelley let's go.

1217
01:28:33,545 --> 01:28:36,173
Zosh do we have any money?
I need some money.

1218
01:28:36,281 --> 01:28:38,249
No. What's the matter?

1219
01:28:38,683 --> 01:28:40,651
There was some around
here yesterday, wasn't there?

1220
01:28:40,752 --> 01:28:41,912
I need some money, Zosh.

1221
01:28:42,087 --> 01:28:44,988
Well there ain't any.
What is it Frankie? What is it?

1222
01:29:32,037 --> 01:29:34,028
You can walk. Since when?

1223
01:29:40,111 --> 01:29:42,272
Well, what's the angle?

1224
01:29:43,181 --> 01:29:46,173
What are you and Frankie tryin' to pull?

1225
01:29:48,153 --> 01:29:51,122
Come on tell me one
hustler to another, huh?

1226
01:29:52,357 --> 01:29:55,849
Go on let me in on it. Let me in on
it or I'll queer it for you, d'ya hear?

1227
01:29:55,961 --> 01:29:59,055
I'll tell everybody you can walk,
you always could.

1228
01:29:59,164 --> 01:30:02,133
I'll tell 'em all you can walk,
you're a phony.

1229
01:30:04,736 --> 01:30:10,504
No Louie, Louie.
Louie, no, no you can't do that.

1230
01:30:10,842 --> 01:30:13,003
You can't tell anybody, please Louie.

1231
01:30:13,111 --> 01:30:14,635
- Let me be.
- Please Louie.

1232
01:30:14,746 --> 01:30:16,714
- Get your hands off.
- No!

1233
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:25,553
(Neighbours)
Don't touch him. Call the police.

1234
01:31:12,671 --> 01:31:16,630
Molly! Molly! Molly!

1235
01:31:38,363 --> 01:31:40,661
Ain't that the way it happened?

1236
01:31:40,765 --> 01:31:44,098
They had a fight. Next thing
anyone knew Louie was falling.

1237
01:31:45,403 --> 01:31:48,236
Come on level Zosh.
Don't try to out think me;

1238
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:50,308
you'll only get tangled.

1239
01:31:50,809 --> 01:31:53,039
I don't know anything about a fight.

1240
01:31:53,144 --> 01:31:56,113
I was sleepin' all morning,
right here in this chair.

1241
01:31:56,214 --> 01:31:58,375
Then for all you know
it did happen that way.

1242
01:31:58,483 --> 01:32:00,678
While you was sleepin'
Frankie shoved him over.

1243
01:32:00,819 --> 01:32:02,446
He didn't.

1244
01:32:02,554 --> 01:32:05,182
How do you know if you was sleeping?

1245
01:32:06,291 --> 01:32:09,260
It wasn't like I was sleepin',
more like dozin' kinda'.

1246
01:32:09,361 --> 01:32:12,125
I'd have heard a fight
if there was one.

1247
01:32:12,897 --> 01:32:15,263
Frankie didn't do it,
he wasn't even here.

1248
01:32:16,101 --> 01:32:18,729
- When wasn't he here?
- When it happened.

1249
01:32:18,837 --> 01:32:21,806
How can you be sure
if you was dozin'?

1250
01:32:22,307 --> 01:32:25,276
I was up when he left,
that's how I'm sure. I saw him go.

1251
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:27,776
Then he was home this morning?

1252
01:32:29,714 --> 01:32:32,774
For only a second, honest. He didn't get
in a fight. He was here only a second.

1253
01:32:33,551 --> 01:32:36,520
Why didn't he stick around?
Was somebody after him?

1254
01:32:37,389 --> 01:32:40,586
Nobody was after him, nobody.
He just wanted some money, is all.

1255
01:32:40,759 --> 01:32:41,851
What for?

1256
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,928
I don't know what for.

1257
01:32:44,329 --> 01:32:49,062
- A fix. He wanted it for a fix from Louie.
- It had nothing to do with Louie.

1258
01:32:49,534 --> 01:32:51,502
How do you know?

1259
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:53,638
'Cos there was no money.

1260
01:32:53,738 --> 01:32:56,639
Why would he want to see Louie
for a fix, if he didn't have no money?

1261
01:32:56,775 --> 01:32:59,369
To try and get one without money.

1262
01:33:01,413 --> 01:33:06,180
Ok I can wait. Wherever he is, sooner
or later he's gotta' come out for a fix.

1263
01:33:13,925 --> 01:33:16,325
Molly. Molly wait, please.

1264
01:33:16,561 --> 01:33:18,552
It's finished Frankie, like I told you.

1265
01:33:19,097 --> 01:33:21,327
I gotta' talk to you Molly, please.

1266
01:33:22,133 --> 01:33:23,930
No, once and for all.

1267
01:33:26,705 --> 01:33:31,335
I gotta' talk to you. Got any money,
Molly? I need a few dollars.

1268
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:33,878
Ten dollars would do it.

1269
01:33:34,145 --> 01:33:38,946
I'll give it back to you in a few days,
or five even, five would be fine.

1270
01:33:39,684 --> 01:33:45,486
Please. I feel so sick Molly,
I hurt all over, I feel so bad.

1271
01:33:47,659 --> 01:33:51,527
Don't say no, please don't say no.
Why not, Molly? Why not?

1272
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:55,763
Jump off a roof if you gonna' kill
yourself, but don't ask me to help you.

1273
01:33:58,002 --> 01:34:04,935
I'll do anything for you Molly, but right
now you gotta' help me, I need a shot.

1274
01:34:05,744 --> 01:34:06,754
No!

1275
01:34:07,779 --> 01:34:12,239
Five would do it, or three,
or two even, but please hurry.

1276
01:34:13,585 --> 01:34:15,485
You mustn't take
that dirty stuff no more.

1277
01:34:15,754 --> 01:34:20,282
I know, I know you're right and I
promise, but right now I need a fix,

1278
01:34:20,658 --> 01:34:25,891
just one fix to help me stop hurtin'.
And I'll promise you I'll kick it for good.

1279
01:34:26,064 --> 01:34:28,055
Just a few dollars Molly, please.

1280
01:34:28,166 --> 01:34:29,531
(Knock on door)

1281
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,631
(Johnny ) Hello Molly.
I just wanted to come say hello.

1282
01:34:38,109 --> 01:34:40,236
Ain't you gonna' let me in?

1283
01:34:40,345 --> 01:34:42,836
I asked you please
not to bother me no more.

1284
01:34:43,014 --> 01:34:44,606
I miss you.

1285
01:34:45,083 --> 01:34:47,051
Look I'm awfully tired Johnny.

1286
01:34:47,152 --> 01:34:49,120
I'll stay only a few minutes.

1287
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:50,187
No.

1288
01:34:50,188 --> 01:34:51,917
(Sound coming from Molly's room)

1289
01:34:52,023 --> 01:34:54,048
Who's in there with you?

1290
01:34:54,259 --> 01:34:56,420
Go away Johnny
and don't come back.

1291
01:34:56,528 --> 01:34:59,497
Who is it, not the dealer?
You ain't hidin' him, are you?

1292
01:34:59,597 --> 01:35:02,088
You wouldn't be dumb enough
to be an accessory, would you?

1293
01:35:02,267 --> 01:35:04,235
What do you mean, accessory?

1294
01:35:04,335 --> 01:35:07,304
He killed Louie. The cops
are lookin' for him this minute.

1295
01:35:08,273 --> 01:35:09,638
Frankie Machine?

1296
01:35:10,842 --> 01:35:12,173
Is he in there?

1297
01:35:12,277 --> 01:35:13,676
No.

1298
01:35:13,878 --> 01:35:15,106
I'm comin' in.

1299
01:35:15,213 --> 01:35:17,738
Not if you ever
want to see me again.

1300
01:35:17,849 --> 01:35:19,817
Will you meet me tomorrow?

1301
01:35:20,752 --> 01:35:24,415
Yeah, I'll be around Anteks,
maybe not tomorrow but soon.

1302
01:35:24,556 --> 01:35:25,818
I miss you.

1303
01:35:35,767 --> 01:35:37,735
Honest I didn't.

1304
01:35:41,105 --> 01:35:43,073
What am I gonna' do?

1305
01:35:44,175 --> 01:35:46,234
Go tell Bednar it wasn't you.

1306
01:35:47,445 --> 01:35:51,814
I couldn't. I couldn't stand up
to the cops the way I am.

1307
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:57,311
Look at me; I'd say anything
they'd want me to say, just for a shot.

1308
01:35:58,656 --> 01:36:00,283
Then get cured first.

1309
01:36:01,593 --> 01:36:04,562
What are you talkin' about.
How am I supposed to get cured?

1310
01:36:05,163 --> 01:36:06,528
You did it once.

1311
01:36:07,332 --> 01:36:09,994
That was with help and medicine,
and doctors.

1312
01:36:11,302 --> 01:36:14,328
I can't go applying to Lexington
with a murder hangin' over my head.

1313
01:36:15,373 --> 01:36:17,807
Couldn't you do it
without going there?

1314
01:36:19,944 --> 01:36:21,343
You mean just stop?

1315
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,045
Cold Turkey.

1316
01:36:25,717 --> 01:36:28,709
You don't understand, pain.

1317
01:36:29,621 --> 01:36:31,589
What else can you do?

1318
01:36:32,824 --> 01:36:35,156
All I need is one shot, just one.

1319
01:36:37,528 --> 01:36:38,825
Alright!

1320
01:36:45,503 --> 01:36:48,404
I said take it, go on and take it all.

1321
01:36:50,675 --> 01:36:54,008
'Cos all that you're gonna' need
after that one shot, is another,

1322
01:36:54,412 --> 01:36:56,505
and then another, and then another.

1323
01:36:57,949 --> 01:37:00,474
Take it! Take it!

1324
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,889
Why should you hurt,
like other people hurt?

1325
01:37:07,025 --> 01:37:10,017
Yes, so you had a
dog's life with never a break.

1326
01:37:10,828 --> 01:37:13,797
Why try to face it
like most people do?

1327
01:37:15,099 --> 01:37:21,004
No just roll up all your pains into one
big hurt and then flatten it with a fix.

1328
01:37:22,974 --> 01:37:25,943
What do you think you'll
find just outside that door?

1329
01:37:29,614 --> 01:37:32,708
Don't you think that Bednar
knows what you are,

1330
01:37:33,217 --> 01:37:36,653
and what you need just to
get through that next hour?

1331
01:37:40,024 --> 01:37:43,118
Don't you know he's just waitin'
for you to come and get it?

1332
01:37:47,332 --> 01:37:49,527
Go on let him kill ya.

1333
01:37:52,403 --> 01:37:55,497
Let him kill ya. It'll be quicker
and better than doing it your way.

1334
01:38:02,146 --> 01:38:03,153
No.

1335
01:38:06,084 --> 01:38:07,093
No.

1336
01:38:09,587 --> 01:38:11,578
I won't let him kill me.

1337
01:38:13,458 --> 01:38:14,584
No.

1338
01:38:17,028 --> 01:38:19,792
And I won't run into no grave.

1339
01:38:24,268 --> 01:38:26,259
But kickin' it.

1340
01:38:30,241 --> 01:38:33,233
Look a guy can't do it by himself.

1341
01:38:37,615 --> 01:38:38,775
I'll help.

1342
01:38:43,154 --> 01:38:45,554
You know what you're
letting yourself in for?

1343
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:49,885
It ain't pretty and
it could be dangerous.

1344
01:38:51,329 --> 01:38:54,298
If they find you here,
then they find you, is all.

1345
01:38:55,967 --> 01:38:59,835
I don't mean dangerous from Bednar.
I mean dangerous from me.

1346
01:39:03,908 --> 01:39:08,845
Sometimes a junkie will kill
to get away from the treatment.

1347
01:39:10,848 --> 01:39:11,857
Understand?

1348
01:39:13,718 --> 01:39:16,186
So if you've got any knives
or scissors in the house,

1349
01:39:16,354 --> 01:39:18,788
you've got to put 'em
away for a while.

1350
01:39:20,425 --> 01:39:22,393
And don't let me out of the room.

1351
01:39:23,094 --> 01:39:26,495
No matter what I say or promise,
or how much I beg.

1352
01:39:28,099 --> 01:39:31,432
'Cos if I get out, it'll only
be to go out and find a fix.

1353
01:39:32,437 --> 01:39:34,428
That's the way it is,
you understand?

1354
01:39:34,705 --> 01:39:36,673
Just lock me in the room.

1355
01:39:37,041 --> 01:39:40,033
And if I try to make a break for it,
stop me any way you know how.

1356
01:39:41,112 --> 01:39:43,774
No matter how much
you see it hurtin' me,

1357
01:39:44,082 --> 01:39:47,347
don't try to help me with pills or
dope or anything else like that.

1358
01:39:50,755 --> 01:39:53,155
You think you can handle it?

1359
01:40:12,977 --> 01:40:16,435
Here we go, down and dirty.

1360
01:40:21,586 --> 01:40:24,987
You can't hold me. You're commitin'
double jeopardy or somethin'.

1361
01:40:26,290 --> 01:40:27,450
Sit down.

1362
01:40:28,759 --> 01:40:31,728
You can't hold me.
You can't hold me.

1363
01:40:31,829 --> 01:40:34,798
I ain't got all my marbles,
you know that captain?

1364
01:40:35,266 --> 01:40:38,360
Right down to cases Sparrow
and quit horsin' around.

1365
01:40:38,569 --> 01:40:40,537
I didn't do nothin'.

1366
01:40:40,705 --> 01:40:43,731
Frankie did somethin' alright
and I want you to tell me about it.

1367
01:40:44,342 --> 01:40:47,311
Whoever killed that peddler
should get a tickertape parade.

1368
01:40:48,446 --> 01:40:51,472
Yeah and maybe I'd lead the band,
but I still want you to tell me about it.

1369
01:40:52,517 --> 01:40:55,543
Listen to me Sparrow,
when we catch him he stands trial,

1370
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:58,520
whether you talk or whether you don't.

1371
01:41:00,491 --> 01:41:03,619
The only question is do I
take you as an accessory?

1372
01:41:05,129 --> 01:41:07,188
Bednar don't nail me to the cross.

1373
01:41:07,298 --> 01:41:09,630
He's the only guy
I ever had for a friend.

1374
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,768
He's nobody's friend anymore.

1375
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:16,031
He'd mash you with a steamroller if you
got between him and a pop in the arm.

1376
01:41:17,975 --> 01:41:19,966
Come on talk Sparrow.

1377
01:41:24,415 --> 01:41:26,007
Ok beat it.

1378
01:42:01,485 --> 01:42:02,509
Doc...

1379
01:42:04,422 --> 01:42:05,855
...Lennox!

1380
01:43:27,238 --> 01:43:29,206
Let me out.

1381
01:43:38,916 --> 01:43:41,077
Oh, Molly. Please?

1382
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:03,737
(Zosh) Yes?

1383
01:44:11,415 --> 01:44:14,384
I thought I'd come see
how you've been, Zosh.

1384
01:44:14,485 --> 01:44:16,680
Alone, that's how I've been.

1385
01:44:18,055 --> 01:44:20,114
Something to eat, sausage.

1386
01:44:21,992 --> 01:44:26,395
Alone and worried sick.
Where is he? You know where he is?

1387
01:44:27,164 --> 01:44:28,426
Did he go to you?

1388
01:44:30,901 --> 01:44:32,869
What do you want anyway?

1389
01:44:33,704 --> 01:44:36,673
Zosh, what you told Bednar.
You've seen the papers.

1390
01:44:36,774 --> 01:44:39,743
You see how bad it makes
Frankie look what you said.

1391
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:43,641
I didn't tell Bednar anything.
The papers they twist everything all up.

1392
01:44:43,948 --> 01:44:46,849
They wouldn't be able to,
if you didn't let them.

1393
01:44:47,017 --> 01:44:48,541
I can't help what they do.

1394
01:44:48,686 --> 01:44:50,916
What do you expect me to do,
sittin' here?

1395
01:44:51,322 --> 01:44:54,291
Just tell Bednar that Frankie
wasn't here when it happened.

1396
01:44:54,392 --> 01:44:56,053
That he didn't do it.

1397
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:57,718
I never said he did.

1398
01:44:57,962 --> 01:45:00,954
Well that's how it sounds, if he
was the only one around at the time.

1399
01:45:01,699 --> 01:45:04,395
And you know it was somebody else.

1400
01:45:05,503 --> 01:45:07,300
What do you mean, who?

1401
01:45:07,671 --> 01:45:10,640
I don't know, but maybe
Bednar could figure it out

1402
01:45:10,741 --> 01:45:12,709
if he didn't think it was Frankie.

1403
01:45:12,810 --> 01:45:14,835
What business is it
of yours anyway?

1404
01:45:14,945 --> 01:45:17,072
I just wanna' help that's all.

1405
01:45:17,915 --> 01:45:21,146
Who are you kiddin'? You think I
don't know what you really want.

1406
01:45:22,019 --> 01:45:24,988
You think I don't know what you and
him have been up to behind my back,

1407
01:45:25,089 --> 01:45:27,523
while I've had to sit here
all these years?

1408
01:45:27,625 --> 01:45:29,593
Had to sit here all these years.

1409
01:45:29,827 --> 01:45:31,590
No Zosh, you got it wrong.

1410
01:45:31,695 --> 01:45:34,186
No you got it wrong.
'Cos you'll never get him.

1411
01:45:34,298 --> 01:45:37,631
He put me in this chair and as long
as I sit here he'll never leave me.

1412
01:45:37,735 --> 01:45:40,033
He knows he belongs to me.

1413
01:45:40,204 --> 01:45:43,605
- No Zosh, I come here only to help.
- I wouldn't want to live if he left me.

1414
01:45:43,707 --> 01:45:46,767
And I'd rather see him dead
too than have him go to you.

1415
01:45:46,977 --> 01:45:48,274
Zosh, please.

1416
01:45:48,446 --> 01:45:53,975
Get outa' here! Get outa' here,
you lousy tramp. Get out! Get out!

1417
01:46:57,214 --> 01:46:58,613
(Molly ) Frankie, no!

1418
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:02,414
I can't stand it any longer.

1419
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:05,780
- Just a little longer.
- Please help me. Keep me warm.

1420
01:47:06,690 --> 01:47:08,021
I can't stand it.

1421
01:47:12,396 --> 01:47:14,421
I gotta' get out and get a fix.

1422
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:21,094
Open the door, Molly, do like I say.
Open the door or I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!

1423
01:47:21,205 --> 01:47:23,901
- Frankie listen. If you really...
- I can't, I can't.

1424
01:47:24,008 --> 01:47:26,306
Then I do have something
put away to make it stop.

1425
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:28,537
Gimme' quick. Gimme' quick.

1426
01:47:30,247 --> 01:47:32,215
Where? I'll get it.

1427
01:47:39,023 --> 01:47:45,258
(Frankie) Molly! Molly open
the door, let me out! Out! Out! Out!

1428
01:47:46,463 --> 01:47:50,593
Molly open the door!
Please Molly! Molly! Molly!

1429
01:48:02,546 --> 01:48:03,553
Frankie?

1430
01:48:04,481 --> 01:48:05,812
Frankie answer me.

1431
01:48:13,891 --> 01:48:16,052
Frankie answer me.
Are you alright?

1432
01:48:17,161 --> 01:48:20,130
Don't think you can fool me into opening
this door, because I'm not gonna'.

1433
01:48:21,398 --> 01:48:24,367
Are you alright Frankie?
Please answer me.

1434
01:48:36,747 --> 01:48:40,080
Molly, Molly if you love me,
kill me please.

1435
01:48:41,452 --> 01:48:43,443
Oh, I'm so cold, I'm so cold.

1436
01:48:45,155 --> 01:48:46,247
So cold.

1437
01:48:48,759 --> 01:48:51,091
Make me warm please.

1438
01:48:52,196 --> 01:48:53,959
Oh, please warm me.

1439
01:48:55,733 --> 01:48:56,740
Molly.

1440
01:49:02,006 --> 01:49:04,201
Please Molly make me warm.

1441
01:49:08,779 --> 01:49:11,680
Oh, Molly I'm so c... cold.

1442
01:49:14,685 --> 01:49:16,050
Make me warm.

1443
01:49:19,723 --> 01:49:20,985
Make me warm.

1444
01:49:24,294 --> 01:49:27,263
Oh God, God. Please God.

1445
01:49:27,364 --> 01:49:29,332
Please make me warm Molly.

1446
01:49:30,901 --> 01:49:32,869
I'm so c-cold.

1447
01:49:35,906 --> 01:49:37,100
So cold.

1448
01:50:14,178 --> 01:50:17,944
- I waited for you at Anteks last night.
- I told you it might not be right away.

1449
01:50:18,048 --> 01:50:20,016
I thought maybe you
were sick or somethin'.

1450
01:50:20,718 --> 01:50:23,346
I just wanna' tell you,
don't look for me at Anteks no more,

1451
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:26,589
he threw me out last night,
we had a little argument.

1452
01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:28,157
So make it the Safari, huh?

1453
01:50:28,992 --> 01:50:30,459
Yeah, sure Johnny, sure.

1454
01:50:35,899 --> 01:50:37,867
Pretty good, huh, Molly?

1455
01:50:41,138 --> 01:50:42,605
Take it slow now.

1456
01:50:42,773 --> 01:50:44,764
Oh, I'm alright. Just a little rocky.

1457
01:51:00,824 --> 01:51:03,088
It's the most gorgeous day
I ever saw.

1458
01:51:04,862 --> 01:51:06,830
I think it's the first day
I ever saw.

1459
01:51:08,699 --> 01:51:10,690
I've got a craving
for something sweet.

1460
01:51:10,868 --> 01:51:12,130
You got anything sweet.

1461
01:51:12,603 --> 01:51:14,867
- Sugar.
- Gimme'.

1462
01:51:21,712 --> 01:51:23,839
More, c'mon more.

1463
01:51:26,850 --> 01:51:29,375
Ooh, how can you, Frankie?

1464
01:51:31,288 --> 01:51:33,620
Oh, I never felt this good in my life.

1465
01:51:34,992 --> 01:51:37,984
I feel like all the things inside me
have settled into place.

1466
01:51:39,963 --> 01:51:41,624
Thanks Molly.

1467
01:51:41,899 --> 01:51:43,161
Molly-O.

1468
01:51:43,767 --> 01:51:46,235
Look out you'll scrape your face off.

1469
01:51:46,336 --> 01:51:48,270
I don't care.

1470
01:51:50,274 --> 01:51:53,402
- You got a razor I can use?
- Can I trust you with one?

1471
01:51:53,811 --> 01:51:55,039
Cross my heart.

1472
01:52:06,757 --> 01:52:08,748
(both laugh)

1473
01:52:18,902 --> 01:52:21,200
- Is this the place?
- Yeah.

1474
01:52:21,305 --> 01:52:22,397
Ok, come on.

1475
01:52:22,506 --> 01:52:24,531
No please.
You don't need me up there.

1476
01:52:33,217 --> 01:52:34,684
(Loud knock on door)

1477
01:52:44,127 --> 01:52:46,118
Where is he, Molly?

1478
01:52:46,330 --> 01:52:48,298
He didn't do it, honest.

1479
01:52:48,432 --> 01:52:51,401
I'm not a judge; they pay
me to bring him in that's all.

1480
01:52:52,903 --> 01:52:55,963
If you tell me where he is, I promise
he'll get every break a junkie can get.

1481
01:52:56,073 --> 01:52:59,042
He's no junkie either.
That's finished.

1482
01:52:59,142 --> 01:53:00,575
Oh sure, you bet.

1483
01:53:00,677 --> 01:53:03,407
See for yourself.
He ain't runnin' away from you.

1484
01:53:04,681 --> 01:53:05,691
So, where is he?

1485
01:53:07,251 --> 01:53:08,275
With Zosh.

1486
01:53:08,986 --> 01:53:11,250
Alright Molly, let's go see.

1487
01:53:22,499 --> 01:53:23,898
Hello Zosh.

1488
01:53:24,735 --> 01:53:28,136
What are your doin' here? Frankie
don't you know Bednar's lookin' for you.

1489
01:53:29,106 --> 01:53:32,735
Don't worry about it Zosh, I ain't afraid.
I didn't do it, you know that.

1490
01:53:34,111 --> 01:53:37,103
Who did then? Who?

1491
01:53:38,215 --> 01:53:41,742
I come to tell you somethin', Zosh.
I'm leaving here.

1492
01:53:42,619 --> 01:53:44,849
Bednar will arrest you.
He told the newspapers you...

1493
01:53:46,290 --> 01:53:47,723
What?

1494
01:53:49,726 --> 01:53:53,753
I'm leaving. You won't have
to worry about money or anything;

1495
01:53:54,865 --> 01:53:58,824
I'll find a way to send you some regular.
And Vi'll take good care of you.

1496
01:53:59,403 --> 01:54:00,665
Leaving me!

1497
01:54:01,738 --> 01:54:04,434
Not leaving you Zosh,
just leaving.

1498
01:54:05,575 --> 01:54:08,339
You saw what happened
since I come back.

1499
01:54:09,079 --> 01:54:11,047
It's like Dr Lennox told me.

1500
01:54:12,582 --> 01:54:15,449
I got in the same old routine and
before I knew it I was on it again.

1501
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:20,849
But you can't leave me.
You gotta' stay and take care of me.

1502
01:54:20,958 --> 01:54:24,291
I know I'm responsible
for how ya' are Zosh,

1503
01:54:25,362 --> 01:54:28,763
but I can't go around the rest of my life,
stoning myself to death about it.

1504
01:54:28,966 --> 01:54:31,935
I've been carrying my heart
ever since it happened.

1505
01:54:32,803 --> 01:54:35,397
Even now it hurts me to think about it,

1506
01:54:35,872 --> 01:54:37,100
but...

1507
01:54:38,642 --> 01:54:41,611
...well, it's not I wanna' leave.

1508
01:54:42,412 --> 01:54:43,743
I gotta' leave.

1509
01:54:44,848 --> 01:54:48,011
You mustn't leave.
Frankie, you mustn't leave.

1510
01:54:49,853 --> 01:54:53,584
Zosh. Say good-bye to me Zosh.

1511
01:54:55,592 --> 01:54:59,289
You think your foolin' me;
I know what's pullin' you away, Molly.

1512
01:54:59,796 --> 01:55:00,956
No.

1513
01:55:01,098 --> 01:55:04,067
You're only goin' just so you
can be with that little tramp.

1514
01:55:06,636 --> 01:55:08,501
- Frankie, no.
- Good-bye, Zosh.

1515
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:13,632
No Frankie, please don't leave.
Frankie no, don't leave me.

1516
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:39,063
Get dressed, Zosh.

1517
01:56:15,839 --> 01:56:17,238
Zosh!

1518
01:56:21,645 --> 01:56:22,669
Zosh!

1519
01:56:44,668 --> 01:56:45,828
Zosh?

1520
01:56:51,174 --> 01:56:56,373
Zosh, don't move. Don't try
to talk, you're gonna' be alright.

1521
01:57:04,955 --> 01:57:09,392
I love you so much. So...

1522
01:57:10,894 --> 01:57:11,986
Zosh.

1523
01:57:12,129 --> 01:57:14,097
(Sound of Ambulance siren)
