1
00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:15,564
"Swaying and gyrating..."

2
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:20,795
"lighting fires in hearts..."

3
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:23,300
"with your eyes"

4
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:30,481
"Spark... sparkle"

5
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:33,480
"You're a spark"

6
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:40,815
Spark - Spark...

7
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:52,668
I'm a spark

8
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:11,375
Hi Rohit

9
00:02:12,577 --> 00:02:15,273
Here...? So suddenly...?
What are you doing here?

10
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:23,418
Been thinking, Sanjay. Ever since
I came, something or the other...

11
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:28,951
- ...has been going wrong.
- Wrong? I never noticed anything?

12
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:35,157
Nor did I, until now.
But like I said...

13
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:40,635
- I've been thinking.
- And...?

14
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,409
After much deliberation,
I've arrived at a conclusion

15
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:49,637
There's someone behind all this.

16
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:57,178
Someone, who's trying... very
systematically, to break us up.

17
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:00,321
What are you saying?

18
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:03,658
There is someone who is determined...

19
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:09,865
not to let me marry Anjali

20
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:11,768
Really?

21
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:15,935
Who might it be?

22
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:19,102
I stopped him, I even tried
to reason with him

23
00:03:21,145 --> 00:03:23,272
For friendship's sake,
I told him

24
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:27,117
I posed obstacles for him,
I lay a thorn in his path

25
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,446
Like a blossom,
I even tried wilting

26
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:34,280
Today, weds a friend.
But I am not happy

27
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:36,960
Love, culminates into marriage.
But...

28
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:41,125
why aren't you happy, Sanjay?

29
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:47,968
You are the one who doesn't want
this wedding to happen

30
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:51,136
But why?

31
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:55,637
But there can be only one reason.

32
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,976
You are in love with Anjali.

33
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,652
We're friends, you can tell me.

34
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,662
Yes, I love Anjali

35
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:35,679
Now that it's out in the open,
what to do?

36
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:46,191
For you, it's quite simple.
Now that you know everything...

37
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:53,030
I think you should just leave
and go back. To America

38
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:55,365
- Really?
- Yes

39
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:58,876
This is my story and Anjali's.

40
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,377
You just walked out of the woodwork

41
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:05,541
You see? Anjali doesn't love you

42
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:09,047
Anjali doesn't love me?

43
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:13,888
Look, in her life you're merely
a stand-in for me

44
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:16,222
In my stead

45
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:20,063
She went to America on my say-so.

46
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:22,056
The swing, that was mine too

47
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:30,233
You understand...? In my story and
Anjali's, you're my understudy

48
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:33,911
Now that I'm here, what need for you?

49
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,073
So pack. Go back. To America

50
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:45,254
You needn't inform anyone.
I'm around, I'll handle everything

51
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:54,764
Sure, you'll handle everything.
But taking your advice...

52
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:58,757
- ...will be a bit problematic.
- Tell me, I'll solve your problem

53
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:03,937
After all, I'm Sanjay, the magic man.
Say, what's your problem?

54
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:08,775
Problem is, I too love Anjali

55
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:19,448
I can't walk away from her, certainly
not when she's willing to marry me

56
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:23,888
That's her mistake, Rohit.
I'll make her happier than you can

57
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:28,130
That's what you think, Sanjay.

58
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:35,803
But there's only one way to decide...
Where lies happiness for Anjali.

59
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:37,808
Where?

60
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:43,814
You love her and I love her too.
Let's both try

61
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:51,981
You don't ask me to go away,
I don't ask you to go away

62
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:55,991
You can do whatever you wish

63
00:06:57,862 --> 00:07:02,663
If you succeed,
then Anjali was never mine

64
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:07,835
If you fail to succeed,
then it's evident...

65
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:10,840
that Anjali and I share
that eternal relationship

66
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:15,668
Why are you wasting your time?
You're a nice guy

67
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:20,681
What's with Anjali?
You'll find scores of girls

68
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,350
No Sanjay. There's only one Anjali

69
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:33,030
And she can belong to
only one of us

70
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:36,693
Whose? Only time can tell

71
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:47,371
I got one advantage. I'm marrying her
in a week's time

72
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:52,048
You're running out of time

73
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:59,883
I got 22 years behind me.
You're the one lagging way behind

74
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:04,886
- You lose.
- We'll see

75
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:39,314
I warned you! The planetary alignment
for the engagement was inauspicious

76
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:43,653
The boy isn't to blame.
He is influenced by the illusions

77
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:47,156
We got to know in time. Else...

78
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:52,666
I'd rather this isn't discussed

79
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:56,835
Without discussions,
how do we arrive at conclusions?

80
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:04,336
Am I not to be given a chance
to defend myself?

81
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:23,027
What you saw was true, yet not true.
I did it, but I wasn't my self

82
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,873
Such was the circumstance,
such was the ambience...

83
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:35,875
I thought, if so many people
are trying to make me happy...

84
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:41,474
I ought to join them
lest they take it otherwise

85
00:10:44,588 --> 00:10:46,715
I could've walked out...

86
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:51,394
and left them heartbroken

87
00:10:53,430 --> 00:11:00,233
But in my folly I've broken the heart
of the man who took me for a son

88
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:07,574
Well what are the facts, Uncle?

89
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:13,579
Fact is, you saw me disgrace myself

90
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:19,919
But there's another truth.
No one means more to me than Anjali

91
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:29,422
Far bigger truth, Anjali trusts me,
wants to spend a lifetime with me

92
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:37,767
And yet another truth, Uncle.
You took me for a son

93
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:50,443
But can I ever be your son?
If I were, you would've forgiven me

94
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:10,470
If you will not touch me in pardon,
I shall never be able to face myself

95
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:14,803
Never

96
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:34,857
You can even face the Sun

97
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:40,866
After all, I have taken you for a son

98
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:23,475
- What happened?
- Don't worry, everything's fine

99
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:30,680
- Uncle has forgiven Rohit
- I knew Rohit would bring him around

100
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:34,719
That's what Rohit is like, isn't he?

101
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:46,436
Sanju, in all these days,
you still haven't told me?

102
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:48,863
How do you find Rohit?

103
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:59,015
Tell me. It's one big decision
I took for myself. What do you think?

104
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:04,914
Am I right? Tell me Sanju
how do you find Rohit?

105
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:12,589
Rohit is a nice boy, Anju

106
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:19,102
Great guy. He'll make you happy

107
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:31,680
What did you do to bring Papa round?

108
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:34,647
Fell in love with you

109
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,954
- What do you want?
- Love

110
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,885
Couldn't find it at the
bachelor's party?

111
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,369
I never imagined, you'd
admit defeat so soon

112
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:11,312
You praised me to the skies
Honestly, I was surprised

113
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:16,925
How to explain this? Deep inside this
scoundrel of a Sanjay Malhotra...

114
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:20,488
there lives this nice, noble
Sanjay Malhotra too

115
00:15:21,932 --> 00:15:27,029
But it takes Anjali's tears
to draw out the nice guy

116
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:33,707
Like you, he is also a fool
being honest, being truthful

117
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:41,175
But it's only a matter of a few minutes
and those few minutes are over

118
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:48,918
Which leaves this Sanjay Malhotra
cunning, conniving

119
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:56,563
So wipe that smile off your face
The war is on

120
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:04,569
So this is going to be even more fun
And guess why?

121
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:10,379
Tomorrow... my relationship with Anjali
will have run the course of 3 months.

122
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:16,048
I'm going... to take her out.
She says, impossible

123
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:18,315
and I say, you have your magic-man

124
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:23,385
- He will bring you to me
- What makes that interesting?

125
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:32,064
Your Anjali is about to beg of you
and how will you refuse her?

126
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:41,141
That'd be interesting? Besides
the wedding is only 6 days away

127
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,342
Only six days.

128
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:50,000
In six days...
the earth spins around six times

129
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:04,262
Keep spinning your planet
let me make a world for myself

130
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:08,833
My wedding... is six days away

131
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:22,181
Enough of wordplay
Six days...?

132
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:42,098
Neither the car nor I
can get an inch ahead

133
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:45,975
From here you walk alone

134
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:52,778
You're nervous,
your heart is pounding

135
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,045
Because you don't know
what's about to happen

136
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:01,217
What might he do?
And what should you be doing?

137
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,659
Heart misses a beat?

138
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:14,364
My heart would, too...
were I in your place

139
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:17,066
And what'd you do?

140
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:23,305
For a moment, imagine
being in love with me

141
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:33,851
For a moment, let me imagine
I'm in love with you

142
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:37,956
And what would you do?

143
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:44,031
In that moment, I would've
tried to live a lifetime

144
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:48,661
Tell me, what would you do?

145
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,763
I...

146
00:18:55,345 --> 00:19:03,514
would walk up to you, without taking
my eyes off yours... like this

147
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:07,555
- I'd keep looking at you...
- Then...?

148
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:16,955
Your eyes would hold mine
your hands would be in mine

149
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:22,104
- And your breath upon my breath
- And...?

150
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:29,243
And I'd carry you away with the wind
to the rustle of leaves...

151
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:35,044
and bathe you in a lake of dew
and in a moment stilled...

152
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:41,747
- I'd whisper in your ears...
- Whisper... what?

153
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:47,160
- Whisper...
- What?

154
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:49,928
It'd be...

155
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:55,862
Be it for even a moment
give me your love...

156
00:19:56,306 --> 00:20:04,406
even if you're false

157
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:57,994
"Silken waves of breeze"

158
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:06,840
"Come embrace me"

159
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:40,534
"Our desires are alive
and so are we"

160
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:52,154
"Don't let this distance be"

161
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:07,460
"At wind's caress won't the
blossom be fragrant?

162
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:12,991
"How can I give you my fragrance?"

163
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:18,167
"The budding blossom is shy"

164
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:23,210
"Then this shyness is more
like punishment"

165
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,141
"Why are you so fervent?
It's only a little wait"

166
00:23:29,352 --> 00:23:34,722
"Even a moment's wait
is cruelty"

167
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:39,622
"Our desires are alive
and so are we"

168
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,200
"I wanted not to speak out"

169
00:24:29,012 --> 00:24:33,381
"But I couldn't hold my silence"
"Yet I haven't had my say"

170
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:39,385
"Be it whatever you tell me
or whatever you won't..."

171
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:44,383
"but don't look so lost"

172
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:47,128
"Come what may..."

173
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,921
"just listen to your heart"

174
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:52,226
"Whatever is heartfelt..."

175
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:55,162
"just tell me"

176
00:24:55,872 --> 00:25:00,900
"I'm yours,
I swear by you"

177
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:05,804
"Our desires are alive
and so are we"

178
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:17,125
"A silken breeze winds..."

179
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,097
"let's draw closer"

180
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:27,596
"Our desires are alive
and so are we"

181
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:38,771
"Don't let this distance be"

182
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:07,637
Help

183
00:26:11,848 --> 00:26:12,872
I just fell off a tree

184
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:22,380
Hurts

185
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,723
Why is the car going backwards?
Anju...?

186
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:33,130
Rohit! What are you upto?
I'm going to get killed

187
00:26:41,444 --> 00:26:44,004
Let me sleep, Ria.
No office today

188
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:49,016
Sanjay, where are you?

189
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:57,418
Why is everyone staring at me?
I'd like to see Sanjay

190
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:06,266
- In bed till ten? Like always!
- Ria, you...?

191
00:27:07,504 --> 00:27:08,368
Yes, I

192
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:14,535
Darling, will you please
tell these people how we're related?

193
00:27:15,812 --> 00:27:17,541
Didn't I tell you
he'd come running?

194
00:27:21,718 --> 00:27:24,050
Ria! What are you doing here?

195
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:25,720
I thought I'd surprise you

196
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:28,387
Didn't I tell you
he'd be happy to see me?

197
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,558
This is Ria
And Ria, this is...

198
00:27:33,763 --> 00:27:39,395
H.P... V.P... Lucky... A.J.
And that's Raj

199
00:27:39,969 --> 00:27:44,997
I've been introduced to them
and everyone here knows me

200
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:52,514
Darling, you're too much!
You haven't told them that we...

201
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,673
- We...?
- Boyfriend - Girlfriend

202
00:27:57,387 --> 00:28:01,983
And you've been having this affair
for the last 8 months

203
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:04,449
So she's that
"little sister" of mine?

204
00:28:04,794 --> 00:28:09,663
- And she has no one but you?
- And you have no one but her?

205
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:10,432
No...

206
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,269
- Here for Anju's wedding...
- And left your heart in Bombay?

207
00:28:15,772 --> 00:28:20,573
- With his real girlfriend!
- So he calls every day to tell her...

208
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:26,613
- Oh I miss you, darling.
- Darling...?

209
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:33,445
I see! So dear nephew, is this your
love story... nice to meet you

210
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:41,119
- Try your best cover, but we know
- Anyone else knows more than me

211
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:41,956
Darling

212
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:46,465
Why are you shying away?
She's a beauty

213
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:50,102
- Given a chance...
- Would you...?

214
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,237
Smart, good-Iooking

215
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:56,870
Shall we... H.P...?

216
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:04,315
The journey must've been tiring.
Take rest

217
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:09,286
- May we excuse ourselves?
- As soon as Anju arrives...

218
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:11,651
- I will send her directly to you
- No, no...

219
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:15,597
- She will be glad to meet Ria
- Sure, she'll be glad

220
00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:24,162
- I'm here, everything will be fine
- Why have you come here?

221
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:31,670
Raj, will you please
take my luggage in?

222
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:36,517
Yes darling...
I mean to say... Ria

223
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:41,847
Shall we... darling?

224
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:45,322
Darling, my foot!
What rubbish

225
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:50,465
Go on, laugh some more
Shut up, will you?

226
00:29:53,703 --> 00:29:56,604
You've ruined my game!
Everything was so perfect

227
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:02,404
The wedding is only 5 days away!
Why did you have to do this Ria?

228
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:06,275
To help you, stupid! I'm here
for your own good

229
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:11,112
I just saw what good you're upto!
Do you realise what you've done?

230
00:30:11,988 --> 00:30:15,719
My bachelor's party cost Rohit far less
than what your stupidity has cost me

231
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,593
- Darling...!
- Have you had your say?

232
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:26,732
- You're in love with Anjali, right?
- What rubbish! I'm in love with you

233
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:27,903
- Darling!
- Sanjay...

234
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:29,662
- Darling...
- Sanjay, I'm serious

235
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:34,842
When did you discover
you're in love with Anjali?

236
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:43,976
You realised, when you saw someone else
walking into Anjali's life

237
00:30:44,954 --> 00:30:48,014
When you saw someone else getting close
to Anjali, you realised...

238
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:55,193
how close you are to her.
And just like you...

239
00:30:56,566 --> 00:31:01,765
Anjali has never seen you
with another girl

240
00:31:02,105 --> 00:31:03,663
- So...?
- When Anjali sees me with you...

241
00:31:03,873 --> 00:31:04,840
Anjali should know too, no?

242
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:09,343
She might reciprocate what you felt
when you got news of her wedding

243
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:12,940
You understand, darling

244
00:31:13,316 --> 00:31:17,275
Oh... darling

245
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,948
Anjali... this is Ria

246
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:31,528
Sanju, will you step out for a moment?
I got to tell you something

247
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:35,326
Sure, go along
I'll join you

248
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:40,140
Her luggage is in the kids' room

249
00:31:54,423 --> 00:31:58,792
- Kapoor? Who's Kapoor?
- Mr. Kapoor in Mumbai

250
00:31:59,262 --> 00:32:03,665
Runs a big advertising agency. Last year
at one of his parties... I met Ria.

251
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,429
You never even told me?

252
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:09,101
- Did you tell me about Rohit?
- I told you about my wedding

253
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:12,005
I'm not marrying her yet.
I'll let you know when it happens

254
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:15,108
You're going to marry her... this Ria?

255
00:32:15,745 --> 00:32:19,841
Why what's wrong with her?
She's smart, she's sexy, beautiful

256
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:27,344
What do you mean, why?
You won't marry her and you won't

257
00:32:27,623 --> 00:32:30,820
- I've spoken. Now do what you want
- Okay

258
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,859
- And by the way, what's she doing here?
- She's here for your wedding

259
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:43,362
You're my friend, you invited me.
She's my friend. In turn...

260
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,138
- Why did you invite her?
- May I not have a guest?

261
00:32:48,344 --> 00:32:50,369
Girlfriend! If I invited Ria,
are there any problems?

262
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,945
No, she's fine

263
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,579
- You don't even know her
- I don't even want to know her

264
00:33:00,223 --> 00:33:01,884
Worse, she's an eyesore.

265
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:04,550
If you say so...
I can accommodate her in my room

266
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:12,623
- Jealous?
- Why should I be jealous?

267
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:19,070
Because after you
she's the only other friend I have

268
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:22,733
Don't you ever compare me with her

269
00:33:29,118 --> 00:33:35,455
"Are you the Moon in full bloom
are you a star?"

270
00:33:36,092 --> 00:33:43,931
"Whatever you be,
by God you're incomparable"

271
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:51,197
That's my face pack commercial

272
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:57,039
- Modelling must be fun!
- Show us a catwalk

273
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:58,372
Right away

274
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:03,944
Nice prop

275
00:34:05,488 --> 00:34:09,788
- But won't help
- Let's see

276
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:18,157
H.P. You still haven't
given me the pendant

277
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:23,071
Who can refuse you?
Here you are

278
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:36,448
Papa, Uncle, looks like you forgotten
all about a wedding just 3 days away

279
00:34:37,086 --> 00:34:39,816
- So what do we do?
- Are you asking me?

280
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:42,424
Didn't Mr. Verma call you?

281
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:45,587
Papa, the jeweller is on the phone.

282
00:34:46,395 --> 00:34:48,693
Am I supposed to organise my wedding?

283
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:52,628
No, that's my lot.
Excuse me, we got work to do

284
00:34:55,604 --> 00:34:56,832
Shall we...?

285
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:09,276
- Uncle, have you nothing to do?
- Oh yes...

286
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,784
You know, such a lot to do
about the wedding... excuse me

287
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:18,690
- You're forever organising weddings...?
- Yes

288
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:25,991
- And you still haven't found your girl?
- I'm sure I'll find someone...

289
00:35:26,268 --> 00:35:30,261
say one of your cousins?
Someone who's yet to marry...?

290
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:38,875
I haven't a sister, but they say
I've come of age

291
00:35:39,382 --> 00:35:43,113
- They must be right...
- Uncle, there's work to be done

292
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:56,892
- May I help you?
- No thanks, son

293
00:36:02,271 --> 00:36:06,799
What with the arrival of the new star
everyone's after her

294
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:11,609
- Sanjay is very lucky, isn't he?
- How come...?

295
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:17,418
- Finding someone like Ria...
- Actually I find it strange

296
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,152
- I never imagined someone like Sanju...
- Would like someone so modern?

297
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:30,926
For someone who lives in Bombay
could Sanjay like anyone else?

298
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:35,932
- You're cosmopolitan too. From America
- I'm different

299
00:36:36,806 --> 00:36:40,333
I always wanted someone simple.
Like Anjali

300
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:45,369
But Sanjay's choice...
got to be Ria

301
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:53,785
- They look great together, no?
- Yes, great

302
00:36:54,156 --> 00:36:59,287
I say, let's give them a wedding
the same day as us

303
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:04,456
He's right! Besides, we are
the only relatives Sanju has

304
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:07,795
My point! So what the point
putting off a nice thing?

305
00:37:09,738 --> 00:37:11,706
But you must teach me
cheese omelettes

306
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:14,771
Sanju picks fights in the kitchen

307
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:19,011
- Your kitchen? Or his?
- The kitchen is the same

308
00:37:19,682 --> 00:37:22,742
In Bombay, you're lucky to find
one kitchen inside one flat

309
00:37:23,986 --> 00:37:26,819
I don't understand...
You and Sanju...

310
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:33,992
Sanju never told you? We live together,
in the same apartment

311
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:39,464
How many bedrooms?

312
00:37:41,036 --> 00:37:44,665
You and Ria, live together?
In the same flat?

313
00:37:44,874 --> 00:37:47,934
No, how could she live
in my flat? Never... no

314
00:37:48,677 --> 00:37:53,341
- Why are you laughing?
- Nothing. Ria was just telling me...

315
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,778
how Sanjay broke down a bathroom
door to rescue her

316
00:37:59,722 --> 00:38:03,522
- And she was clad only in a towel
- You said she never lived with you

317
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:08,254
She didn't. But of late she doesn't
have a place to live. So...

318
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,963
How magnanimous of you Sanjay,
to have given her shelter

319
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:19,535
Very soon, she'll make family
with you. All the best

320
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:30,085
The plan was nice.
Girl, jealousy... it always works

321
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,617
Maybe the living-together bit
was a bit too much?

322
00:38:36,258 --> 00:38:37,987
They'll make sure
you're married

323
00:38:40,396 --> 00:38:43,763
The likes of Anjali are best
for doctors like me

324
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:46,228
It's a Ria you need

325
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:52,137
Coming... aunt

326
00:38:53,442 --> 00:38:56,377
We're finalising a wedding date
for you and Ria

327
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:03,245
Finalising

328
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:09,154
It's not working
Got to think up something else

329
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:15,591
Sanju, come out.

330
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,431
Tell your Ria to come out

331
00:39:20,135 --> 00:39:22,899
Poor Bunty has been knocking
for the past half an hour

332
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,706
And the lady is taking her time
dressing to go out

333
00:39:25,507 --> 00:39:29,637
- All dressed and raring to go? Where?
- Anju, the college re-union

334
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:34,549
The annual do, the old students
get together... never got the card?

335
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:40,952
I got invited before you. I've been
invited regularly these last 3 years

336
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:44,087
- I never went, not even once
- So sad

337
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:47,486
- You'll miss it this year too
- How come?

338
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:51,865
How can you go?
You're getting married in 3 days

339
00:39:52,268 --> 00:39:56,864
But how can you go? I skipped the last 3
years because you weren't here

340
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:02,040
We promised each other, we wouldn't
go to the re-unions without each other

341
00:40:02,578 --> 00:40:08,175
- Oh I forgot, sorry
- No problem. Change

342
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:09,982
Let's go downstairs
for a game of carrom

343
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:12,345
- I can't.
- Why?

344
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:16,154
Darling, I'm ready.
Let's go

345
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:25,962
I promised Ria. She wants to see
my college. I can't break her heart

346
00:40:26,535 --> 00:40:27,297
Shall we... darling?

347
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,273
If you want come along
I'm sure Ria won't mind

348
00:40:35,844 --> 00:40:40,474
My invitation says, I can bring along
a guest of my choice

349
00:40:40,683 --> 00:40:45,177
- Then, you're coming?
- Of course. With a guy of my choice

350
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:33,767
"There's no one like us"

351
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:37,735
"We're the life of the party"

352
00:41:45,147 --> 00:41:53,077
"Is there anyone else
...like us?"

353
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:41,301
"Why lament that you can't find
anyone else?"

354
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:51,808
"Is there no one else?
Well, I don't lament that"

355
00:42:52,414 --> 00:42:55,815
"We're young, we're beautiful"

356
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:59,144
"We have no laments"

357
00:42:59,354 --> 00:43:03,313
"The sights are already
driving me crazy

358
00:43:18,106 --> 00:43:21,007
"Is anyone else around like us?"

359
00:43:21,276 --> 00:43:24,507
I'm the life of the party"

360
00:44:02,718 --> 00:44:09,385
"When you're with me
everything is beautiful"

361
00:44:21,303 --> 00:44:27,902
"The road ahead is full of love"

362
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:32,069
"Come into my heart
let my search end"

363
00:44:57,773 --> 00:45:02,938
"Anyone else around
like you and I...?"

364
00:45:04,846 --> 00:45:11,615
"You and I have brought to life...
this party"

365
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:19,955
"Anything like you-and-I...?"

366
00:46:02,771 --> 00:46:05,433
What a pair! That's how
a friendship ought to be

367
00:46:07,409 --> 00:46:08,876
Wish I too had a friendship
like this

368
00:46:10,045 --> 00:46:13,276
- Are you talking about Sanjay or Anjali?
- I'm talking about you

369
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,941
Sanjay is lucky to have you on his side.

370
00:46:18,353 --> 00:46:19,911
That's what everyone says in Bombay

371
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:23,452
Only lucky guys get friends
I mean girl friends like Ria

372
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:30,026
- Hey what happened?
- Ria, will you spare me this act?

373
00:46:30,899 --> 00:46:36,769
- Act? How can you call it an act?
- You're his friend. Not girlfriend

374
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,576
But you make a great friend. That's why
I wish I had a friend like you

375
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,215
Someone who would be willing
to help me to get Anjali

376
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:51,946
Between friends, you got to do
what it takes for friendship's sake

377
00:46:52,587 --> 00:46:54,851
- From "Maine Pyar Kiya?"
- You watched the movie?

378
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,385
- Six times.
- I could be your friend

379
00:46:57,993 --> 00:46:58,721
Off the record

380
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:01,752
Can I ask you something
off the record?

381
00:47:03,432 --> 00:47:07,266
What makes you so confident that
whatever you're doing is right?

382
00:47:09,337 --> 00:47:10,429
See them together?

383
00:47:12,974 --> 00:47:16,740
- Sanju, I want that trophy
- You've taken three of five

384
00:47:16,945 --> 00:47:18,003
- This is my turn.
- Sanju, please...

385
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:19,737
No, score is score

386
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:26,385
- Aren't they made for each other?
- Certainly not

387
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:31,853
Life's no dance competition, Ria
Nice dancing partners...

388
00:47:32,894 --> 00:47:36,990
don't necessarily
make good life partners

389
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:42,835
The bigger decisions in life
can't be based on trivia

390
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:51,376
Say, if you never knew Sanjay
say, if you were my friend...

391
00:47:52,614 --> 00:47:57,779
suppose I was the one who invited you
And now, look at them

392
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:19,131
Do you still say that Sanjay and
Anjali were made for each other?

393
00:48:21,543 --> 00:48:23,807
Whatever you or I think
doesn't make a difference

394
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,478
What makes all the difference
is what Anjali wants

395
00:48:35,957 --> 00:48:36,981
What Anjali wants

396
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:48,433
- You're a nice guy, Rohit
- I know

397
00:48:49,771 --> 00:48:53,730
But sometimes, I'm afraid my ethics
might create obstacles

398
00:49:06,555 --> 00:49:07,180
Gayatri...

399
00:49:13,028 --> 00:49:14,928
girls all over the world
are getting married

400
00:49:16,398 --> 00:49:18,593
But no mother-of-the-bride was ever
as harried as you are

401
00:49:20,235 --> 00:49:21,463
What will people say?

402
00:49:22,904 --> 00:49:24,201
- Ajit...
- Yes?

403
00:49:24,406 --> 00:49:27,432
- Send the sweets to Rohit's house
- Yes uncle

404
00:49:30,745 --> 00:49:35,478
Our son-in-law is one-in-a-million
It's a time to rejoice. And you...

405
00:49:37,919 --> 00:49:38,408
What's going on?

406
00:49:43,725 --> 00:49:45,659
Sanju, will you make Gayatri
see some reason?

407
00:49:46,761 --> 00:49:50,458
She insists that a twitch
in her left eye bodes ill

408
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:55,299
Is Aunt's superstition
rubbing off on you

409
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:00,766
If you ever have a daughter
and come the time for her wedding...

410
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,008
- ...you'll know.
- What...?

411
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:10,410
Isn't it sad to know that my daughter
will be leaving me in a couple of days?

412
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,284
I got a wonderful idea!
Let me marry Anju

413
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:20,325
And I'll move in to live with you
Then Anjali won't have to go away

414
00:50:22,097 --> 00:50:26,693
If that could've happened
no one would be happier than I

415
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:32,635
You'd be happy to give your daughter
away to a fool like him?

416
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:39,146
Your daughter has chosen someone nice
like Rohit. Thank God for that

417
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:41,109
And everything's working out fine

418
00:50:42,384 --> 00:50:45,876
Most parents lose their sleep
over a daughter's wedding

419
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:49,622
And before we knew it
this match was finalised

420
00:50:49,824 --> 00:50:57,128
- Before we knew it... just think
- What's there to worry about?

421
00:50:57,933 --> 00:51:01,767
In front of so many people
it takes only one wrong word...

422
00:51:04,072 --> 00:51:11,069
to hurt everyone. And it has
happened so many times

423
00:51:12,647 --> 00:51:14,945
And I've heard,
seen such instances...

424
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:21,180
where one misplaced word can destroy
relationships that have lasted years

425
00:51:23,558 --> 00:51:30,828
Are we about to forge new relationships
at the cost of old ones?

426
00:51:32,867 --> 00:51:33,834
It deserves a thought

427
00:51:44,512 --> 00:51:51,941
You're getting worried for nothing
I'm around, and you have my promise

428
00:51:53,388 --> 00:51:57,017
No one will be hurt
no one will be sad

429
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:04,431
I'll make sure everyone is happy
I'm your magic man, am I not?

430
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,375
Listen...

431
00:52:26,755 --> 00:52:37,359
- About Sanju marrying Anjali...
- Gayatri, you know what he's like

432
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:42,595
- He was joking. He wasn't serious
- What if he was?

433
00:52:45,006 --> 00:52:48,305
- Uncle...
- Coming

434
00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:53,748
Sanju is always joking

435
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:13,926
Sanjay, guess what Rohit told Anjali
over the phone? He said...

436
00:53:14,436 --> 00:53:18,964
- ...you should hear it yourself
- You taped their conversation?

437
00:53:19,274 --> 00:53:22,368
- Of course
- You're too much

438
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:25,101
- Should I not have done it?
- Of course not

439
00:53:27,015 --> 00:53:32,715
Anjali and Rohit are getting married
What right have you...?

440
00:53:34,522 --> 00:53:37,889
I'm not here to attend some Anjali's
wedding to one Rohit

441
00:53:38,693 --> 00:53:40,627
I'm here to break up the wedding

442
00:53:53,975 --> 00:53:57,809
You got to tell Anjali that
you're in love with her

443
00:53:59,814 --> 00:54:04,808
Sanjay, will you tell Anjali
or won't you?

444
00:54:10,492 --> 00:54:15,225
- Why not?
- I don't know...

445
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:20,859
- Then I'll tell her...
- No Ria... please

446
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,972
I don't think you need me here.

447
00:54:38,386 --> 00:54:44,347
Then... I think I'll just leave

448
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:52,729
Won't you stop me?

449
00:55:04,078 --> 00:55:08,947
- I don't know what to say...
- You needn't tell me anything

450
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:14,819
But you won't ever tell the one
you ought to be telling, will you?

451
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:26,432
Sanjay, my best compliments
It's your best friend's wedding

452
00:55:28,937 --> 00:55:35,740
See you in Bombay. In the meantime
if you achieve anything, invite me

453
00:55:37,645 --> 00:55:38,976
To your wedding

454
00:56:05,306 --> 00:56:08,571
Uncle, this is splendid!

455
00:56:10,211 --> 00:56:12,577
I did nothing. Sanjay did all this

456
00:56:13,781 --> 00:56:16,545
He was up all night.
I don't think he has slept

457
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:21,113
Just like you kept awake
all through my wedding to Nilu

458
00:56:24,292 --> 00:56:26,123
Yes, just like that

459
00:56:29,897 --> 00:56:30,363
You like the design?

460
00:56:31,332 --> 00:56:37,737
Eat this, Nilu, Gita... the bride's
trousseau is here

461
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:40,904
- Where?
- Downstairs

462
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:43,202
- Come on, leave that for later
- Okay, come on

463
00:57:02,864 --> 00:57:04,832
You don't want to see
the bride's trousseau

464
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:29,915
I wanted to see you in bridal finery
But that isn't to be

465
00:57:31,592 --> 00:57:36,655
Why are you leaving so suddenly?
Can't you stay for two days...

466
00:57:38,066 --> 00:57:44,130
I got important work. I'm helpless.
If I could stay back, I would

467
00:57:45,907 --> 00:57:54,679
I wanted to stay for your wedding.
But anyway... Sanjay is here

468
00:57:56,317 --> 00:58:00,117
Aren't you afraid to leave your
boyfriend to a bevy of beauties?

469
00:58:01,956 --> 00:58:06,689
Sanjay isn't my boyfriend.
We're friends. Just friends

470
00:58:09,697 --> 00:58:16,865
- Then why all this...?
- Life plays such jokes with us

471
00:58:17,572 --> 00:58:21,975
And we crack jokes with each other
...only so much to the relationship

472
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:29,206
In Bombay, Sanjay never fell in love
with any girl, nor can he ever

473
00:58:30,451 --> 00:58:31,076
Why...?

474
00:58:34,055 --> 00:58:38,719
Because the girl in his heart
isn't in Bombay

475
00:58:40,628 --> 00:58:42,528
Aunt, your cab is here

476
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:55,598
- Not in Bombay? Where else?
- How can I say?

477
00:58:56,611 --> 00:59:02,243
You are his best friend. You ought
to know what is in his heart

478
00:59:04,452 --> 00:59:08,183
Seek within your heart,
you might find the answer

479
00:59:34,248 --> 00:59:36,808
Yes Sanjay, tell me

480
00:59:39,387 --> 00:59:40,149
I'm going

481
00:59:41,856 --> 00:59:42,322
Back

482
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,223
You win

483
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:48,420
I lose

484
00:59:50,932 --> 00:59:53,093
I don't know why I believed
why Anjali and I...

485
00:59:56,404 --> 00:59:57,166
Without even thinking

486
00:59:57,905 --> 01:00:00,373
how one mistake of mine...
might break so many hearts

487
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:05,979
Thanks to you, I stopped myself
from making that mistake

488
01:00:08,082 --> 01:00:13,315
Anyone else in your place...
but how could you be someone else?

489
01:00:15,056 --> 01:00:18,719
You are Rohit, the perfect one

490
01:00:20,394 --> 01:00:21,725
The one for Anjali

491
01:00:25,766 --> 01:00:30,032
I was Anjali's friend.
I'll stay a friend

492
01:00:32,607 --> 01:00:34,040
But I won't be able to stay

493
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:41,173
I don't have the courage to see Anjali
leaving with someone else

494
01:00:43,751 --> 01:00:46,720
Nor am I gentleman enough
to let you carry her away

495
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:52,152
Take care of Anju

496
01:01:04,672 --> 01:01:08,870
The wedding is tomorrow. I won't
ask you to stay for the wedding

497
01:01:11,612 --> 01:01:15,480
But today, won't you join in
my celebrations?

498
01:01:20,855 --> 01:01:22,982
We just became friends, didn't we?

499
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:27,784
Yes, we just became friends

500
01:01:32,433 --> 01:01:35,493
And I'll make sure everyone
joins the celebration

501
01:01:37,204 --> 01:01:39,934
After all, it's my friend's wedding

502
01:02:12,173 --> 01:02:16,803
"To the rhythm of drums,
her anklets chime"

503
01:02:26,687 --> 01:02:30,646
"The bride wears a veil
the bridegroom carries flowers"

504
01:02:30,858 --> 01:02:35,386
"And the Spring follows them
around the world"

505
01:02:35,663 --> 01:02:37,688
"May all the happiness
in the world be theirs"

506
01:02:37,898 --> 01:02:44,997
"Here's a prayer from my heart
for my friend's wedding"

507
01:03:59,714 --> 01:04:04,242
"My friend has found love"

508
01:04:04,885 --> 01:04:09,413
"For him, this is sweet victory"

509
01:04:24,138 --> 01:04:26,265
"I'm so happy..."

510
01:04:26,474 --> 01:04:30,934
"I'm so happy, I've filled this party..."

511
01:04:31,145 --> 01:04:32,874
"with songs..."

512
01:04:33,414 --> 01:04:42,618
"for a dear friend's wedding"

513
01:05:20,261 --> 01:05:22,491
"There's no winning,
there can be no losing..."

514
01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:24,988
"where there's love"

515
01:05:25,499 --> 01:05:29,993
"If there be a contest,
there can be no love"

516
01:05:44,752 --> 01:05:46,811
"Let's embrace..."

517
01:05:47,221 --> 01:05:49,018
"friend..."

518
01:05:51,792 --> 01:05:53,453
"here's a prayer from my heart..."

519
01:05:53,894 --> 01:06:03,360
"for my friend's wedding"

520
01:06:27,127 --> 01:06:32,087
"My childhood friends,
my childhood playground..."

521
01:06:32,433 --> 01:06:37,166
"my toys, my swings,
I will miss everyone"

522
01:06:37,671 --> 01:06:41,971
"How will I hide my tears?"

523
01:07:18,646 --> 01:07:23,640
"My friend, hear what our
playground tells..."

524
01:07:23,884 --> 01:07:28,947
"colour your heart,
you life in hues of love..."

525
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:33,952
"and even the jewellery
you wear will smile"

526
01:07:34,161 --> 01:07:38,791
"Remember that, friend"

527
01:07:49,209 --> 01:07:53,646
"My friend's wedding..."

528
01:07:54,014 --> 01:07:58,474
"it's my friend's wedding"

529
01:08:20,207 --> 01:08:23,005
So you're leaving? You lost

530
01:08:25,512 --> 01:08:29,505
It's you who told me to put
my heart into the game

531
01:08:31,051 --> 01:08:32,518
Win or lose, what difference?

532
01:08:34,822 --> 01:08:35,686
Sanju are you sure?

533
01:08:38,058 --> 01:08:48,195
- Are you doing the right thing?
- Yes Uncle, just as sure as you were

534
01:09:08,522 --> 01:09:10,319
Hindustani women are incomprehensible

535
01:09:11,725 --> 01:09:16,355
Try to get close and their decorum and
their decency stands in the way

536
01:09:17,264 --> 01:09:24,568
And 12 hours before the wedding,
summons are issued

537
01:09:29,777 --> 01:09:31,244
What's this sudden
show of affection?

538
01:09:35,282 --> 01:09:41,084
Rohit, we've told each other
about everything...

539
01:09:43,957 --> 01:09:44,753
except one thing...

540
01:09:47,294 --> 01:09:50,422
that you perhaps forgot to ask
...and I forgot to tell you

541
01:09:52,299 --> 01:09:52,765
What...?

542
01:09:53,801 --> 01:09:56,599
Whether I ever loved someone
before you

543
01:09:59,807 --> 01:10:02,105
- Did you?
- Yes

544
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:14,114
From the moment such thoughts
about a boy arise in a girl's mind...

545
01:10:17,491 --> 01:10:21,791
- ...there has been such a boy.
- Who is he?

546
01:10:22,496 --> 01:10:26,964
Sanju, my friend
...my best friend

547
01:10:31,672 --> 01:10:37,133
But you saw Sanju. How can I even
expect him to understand?

548
01:10:38,512 --> 01:10:43,472
He's lost in his own world.
I always hoped...

549
01:10:44,685 --> 01:10:47,153
some time or the other,
Sanju would come up and tell me

550
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:56,151
But as time went by,
I realised I'm wrong

551
01:10:57,364 --> 01:11:02,996
For Sanju, I'm just a friend.
Only friend

552
01:11:04,271 --> 01:11:10,073
So I suppressed my feelings,
lest he found out

553
01:11:11,044 --> 01:11:14,844
Then... you came into my life

554
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:18,677
You made me believe, I can have

555
01:11:20,053 --> 01:11:23,511
a good life with someone else too

556
01:11:25,225 --> 01:11:31,357
But before beginning this life,
I wanted you to know...

557
01:11:33,567 --> 01:11:40,200
I'm building this relationship
on honesty. Yes, Rohit?

558
01:11:44,244 --> 01:11:47,873
That's just why I called you out

559
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,088
Hello Rohit

560
01:12:35,295 --> 01:12:38,753
Beautiful flowers, just like
your daughter

561
01:12:41,802 --> 01:12:45,431
- You haven't gone to bed yet?
- Lost my sleep

562
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:52,668
- How come you're up so late?
- I made a promise to Anju...

563
01:12:54,047 --> 01:12:55,514
that I'd decorate her wedding
hall myself.

564
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:58,017
I'm doing it up in flowers

565
01:12:59,052 --> 01:13:03,182
May it be flowers, flowers for her
all the way and no thorns

566
01:13:07,995 --> 01:13:09,622
Your prayer is already bearing fruit

567
01:13:14,701 --> 01:13:16,669
If I ask you a question, will you

568
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:19,835
give me an honest answer?

569
01:13:20,874 --> 01:13:28,679
- Yes, ask me.
- I wasn't your first choice for Anjali

570
01:13:32,219 --> 01:13:40,854
- No son, it's nothing like that.
- I know... I know and it's okay

571
01:13:43,063 --> 01:13:45,861
But there's something
even you don't know

572
01:13:48,902 --> 01:13:50,369
I wasn't Anjali's first choice either.

573
01:13:51,738 --> 01:13:53,865
What are you saying, son?

574
01:13:55,409 --> 01:14:01,370
And for you and your daughter
the first choice was the same

575
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:05,209
Sanjay

576
01:14:10,557 --> 01:14:17,360
In all these years, Anjali could never
tell Sanju how dearly she loves him?

577
01:14:20,133 --> 01:14:23,591
And there's Sanjay. He loves
Anjali so fiercely...

578
01:14:23,904 --> 01:14:26,031
he can't bear to see her marry
someone else

579
01:14:28,408 --> 01:14:39,216
And I am the only man in the world
who's aware of their feelings.

580
01:14:41,421 --> 01:14:45,380
The only man who can give
any twist to this tale

581
01:14:48,762 --> 01:14:49,387
But what am I to do?

582
01:14:51,331 --> 01:14:57,133
What do I do now?

583
01:15:00,073 --> 01:15:04,703
Now I know, Sanjay was right.

584
01:15:07,013 --> 01:15:16,820
This story is his. And Anjali's.
I had no place in this story

585
01:15:21,695 --> 01:15:26,997
Sanjay left. Because he didn't
want to break anyone's heart

586
01:15:29,136 --> 01:15:30,933
At least he knew
what he ought to do

587
01:15:34,307 --> 01:15:35,604
Anjali told me...

588
01:15:37,144 --> 01:15:41,444
because she wanted honesty to be
the cornerstone of our relationship

589
01:15:43,817 --> 01:15:45,284
She knows too
what she ought to do

590
01:15:49,823 --> 01:15:53,953
Now it's my turn. Even I know
what I ought to do

591
01:15:56,997 --> 01:16:00,956
But what I must do, I cannot
bring about all by myself

592
01:16:04,337 --> 01:16:05,463
I need a mother to bless my way...

593
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:15,975
to tell me, "Son, you're right"

594
01:16:19,519 --> 01:16:20,486
"I am with you"

595
01:16:23,523 --> 01:16:27,823
- Say, are you with me?
- Yes

596
01:16:46,213 --> 01:16:52,015
- Hey... Say, how do I feel?
- How...?

597
01:16:53,053 --> 01:16:56,352
Like I've fast-forwarded
a decade into life

598
01:16:57,724 --> 01:17:01,524
I feel like we're both 35 and here
we are sitting at Gateway of India

599
01:17:02,729 --> 01:17:05,357
You haven't found a boy
and I haven't found a girl

600
01:17:07,234 --> 01:17:08,201
- Really?
- Yes

601
01:17:09,402 --> 01:17:12,030
- So...?
- So let's strike a deal

602
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:17,169
At thirty-five if we're still here,
then we'll get married

603
01:17:21,414 --> 01:17:23,712
- On one condition.
- What?

604
01:17:24,584 --> 01:17:26,211
You'll still do the cooking

605
01:17:28,755 --> 01:17:30,382
Okay, done

606
01:17:37,931 --> 01:17:39,728
Talking about being 35...

607
01:17:41,401 --> 01:17:42,698
I don't even know...

608
01:17:44,337 --> 01:17:46,897
with Anjali gone, how I'll manage
to live beyond the day after...?

609
01:18:05,825 --> 01:18:09,955
You... here...? Tomorrow's your wedding

610
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:10,955
Why did you leave?

611
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:16,131
- Ria fell sick all of a sudden...
- No Ria, no Rohit

612
01:18:18,505 --> 01:18:24,466
No one's an excuse to my question.
You and I...

613
01:18:26,179 --> 01:18:27,646
and between us, this one question

614
01:18:29,182 --> 01:18:33,482
- Why did you leave?
- Because...

615
01:18:35,188 --> 01:18:36,655
- because I...
- Because what?

616
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:43,488
Because I can't bear to see you
marry someone else

617
01:18:45,365 --> 01:18:50,496
- Why can't you bear?
- Because I wanted to marry you

618
01:18:52,038 --> 01:18:55,997
- Then why didn't you tell me?
- I was afraid Anju

619
01:18:57,877 --> 01:18:58,673
If you refused...

620
01:19:02,048 --> 01:19:03,345
It would've broken my heart.

621
01:19:04,551 --> 01:19:07,520
What about all these years...
that I held my heart and I pined?

622
01:19:11,558 --> 01:19:16,018
Did you ever think of the girl
who was with you all her life...

623
01:19:17,063 --> 01:19:19,691
holding hands, sitting with you
on that swing...?

624
01:19:21,234 --> 01:19:26,866
In the whole wide world, why does
she have an only friend?

625
01:19:29,743 --> 01:19:40,210
A girl goes through her childhood
and her youth with one boy

626
01:19:42,088 --> 01:19:45,888
Would she ever seek the company of
someone else... for the rest of her life?

627
01:19:48,762 --> 01:19:49,729
Have you never wondered?

628
01:19:51,431 --> 01:19:54,889
You never thought that all I needed
was only my friend?

629
01:19:57,937 --> 01:20:01,566
The only one. You

630
01:20:06,112 --> 01:20:14,417
How can a girl be expected to be
the first to express her feelings?

631
01:20:18,792 --> 01:20:21,920
You never wondered? Never...?

632
01:20:22,128 --> 01:20:27,760
- I'm... I'm sorry, Anju.
- Sorry? Is that all you can muster?

633
01:20:29,469 --> 01:20:32,597
Won't you say what I've wanted
to hear all these years?

634
01:20:39,646 --> 01:20:40,442
I love you

635
01:21:29,696 --> 01:21:33,996
"To the rhythm of drums,
her anklets chime"

636
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:48,340
"The bride wears a veil,
the bridegroom carries flowers"

637
01:21:48,548 --> 01:21:52,678
"And the Spring follows them
around the world

638
01:21:53,386 --> 01:21:55,513
"May all the happiness
in the world be theirs"

639
01:21:55,722 --> 01:21:58,020
"Here's a prayer from my heart
for my friend's wedding"

640
01:21:58,391 --> 01:22:27,415
"It's my friend's wedding"
