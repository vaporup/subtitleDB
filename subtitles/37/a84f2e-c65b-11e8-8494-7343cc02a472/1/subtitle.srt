1
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:30,755
Sorry

2
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:39,936
- I said, I'm sorry.
- Being sorry won't change facts

3
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,608
- Then you tell me what I should do.
- Can anything be done anymore?

4
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,609
- That's my point, what can I do?
- Shame on you, Sanjay

5
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:58,450
- You'll never know a girl's mind.
- But I can try. One more chance...?

6
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,619
Don't even talk to me

7
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:09,791
- Will you say something?
- You just said don't talk to me.

8
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:26,645
- What's my problem?
- You're no good at relationships.

9
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,823
- I'm sorry, Ria.
- What use being sorry now?

10
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,457
I'm really very sad.

11
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,134
I loved her so much.

12
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,141
And she dumped me, just like that?

13
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,813
It didn't take her even 20 minutes...
to get over a 20 day affair.

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,316
Broke my heart.

15
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,321
Sonia, you've hurt me.

16
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,324
My heart's broken.

17
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:19,164
For the 8th time, Mr Sanjay Malhotra
in the last 11 months

18
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,838
Now get up and get it over with

19
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,514
Ria... listen to me

20
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,687
But one point. Over the last 11 months
8 girls broke my heart...

21
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,694
but only after I won their hearts, no?

22
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,527
Follow your heart, you can change the
world. 8 girls, 9th can't be too far

23
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:53,035
That's Sanjay and Ria.
But this isn't their story

24
00:02:53,907 --> 00:03:00,540
This is Sanjay's and Anjali's story.
Sanju and Anju, who became friends...

25
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:05,214
long before they knew what friendship
meant. All they knew was...

26
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,050
they couldn't live
without each other

27
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,682
One minute, what's wrong?
Was touching her a crime?

28
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,017
You want what I want

29
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:29,859
- Tell me, it's thrilling, isn't it?
- Not another word

30
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:37,029
At my touch she becomes unworthy
of you? You care so much? What's she?

31
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:42,371
- Your fief, private property, what?
- Friend

32
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:48,346
Friends! Hear that? Can a boy and
a girl ever be friends?

33
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,376
See for yourself, that's an example
of friendship

34
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,887
What a pretense

35
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:57,548
Prem...

36
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,886
A boy and a girl can never be friends.
Actually it's a...

37
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:10,566
You forgot the lines! I win the bet.
So you get to do the cooking

38
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,736
- I didn't lose.
- No...?

39
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:21,244
- I was thinking...
- Thinking? What?

40
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,909
This is a film, right?
With films, it's different

41
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,749
But in real life, can a boy and
a girl be friends?

42
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:36,418
When a boy and a girl are friends
they either fall in love...

43
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,760
or else, they part ways

44
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:42,423
In any eventuality,
the friendship is terminated

45
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,099
Of course there can be a friendship
between boy and girl.

46
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:45,770
Look at us

47
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:50,409
You are a girl, I'm a boy. Between us
there's none of your so-called "love"

48
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,547
Our story is different.
We did go around for a week

49
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,712
But I knew on day three that
nothing could be more foolish...

50
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,887
than falling for you.
You get that?

51
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:06,718
Don't you forget, Ria Chowdhury was
the first girl who ditched you

52
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:12,387
Thank you for saving me!
As if she's some beauty queen

53
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,301
If you may spare some time off your
busy schedule, then it's for you

54
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,805
Anju's...?

55
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,477
How was your trip? Was America fun?
How are your parents?

56
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,665
America was fun!
Mummy-Daddy enjoyed themselves

57
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:56,668
- I returned 3 weeks ago.
- And you're calling me now?

58
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:03,838
- I hope you didn't forget my list?
- Yes, I picked up everything

59
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,180
But hear me out first.
This is very important

60
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,184
- Sanju...
- Yes tell me

61
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,529
I'm getting married, Sanju

62
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,868
The wedding is next month.
Everyone is coming

63
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,533
You got to be there too.
Come over, quick

64
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:35,203
- You're... getting married?
- You never get anything fast, do you?

65
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,880
Now don't waste time, just pack and
take the first flight to Delhi

66
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:45,220
If you aren't here by tomorrow evening
...Sanju, are you listening?

67
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:53,558
Not just you. Everyone's surprised.
Everything happened so soon...

68
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,235
Just come over, I'll tell
you everything

69
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:06,401
I'm a bit busy for a few days.
Say hi, to Anu and your parents

70
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:21,916
I can't believe this...
she's getting married?

71
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,595
Who's upto what?

72
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,593
Anju... Anjali is getting married

73
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:37,273
- Wonderful news, no?
- Yes, I'm glad, very happy, I'm thrilled

74
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,448
- You don't seem so.
- What rubbish

75
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:48,276
I'm glad, very happy, thrilled!
It's only a bit sudden

76
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,617
Anjali, your childhood friend?

77
00:09:53,993 --> 00:10:00,626
Childhood? Ever since...
she was four and I was five.

78
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,294
And we were always together

79
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,972
School, college...
we were like buddies

80
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:15,978
- How silly of Anjali...
- Anjali... has a lovely smile?

81
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,980
- Thinking her smiling makes me smile.
- And your cheese omelettes?

82
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,815
It's Anjali who makes the real
cheese omelettes.

83
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,317
In comparison, I'm sordid

84
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:35,323
But how come you...? How come you
know all this about Anjali?

85
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,497
I know only bits and pieces.

86
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,501
But I'd like to know more.
Want to tell me?

87
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,343
- What do you want to know?
- About your friendship

88
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,013
About your Anju.

89
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,281
About Anju!

90
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,184
How do I tell you...?

91
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:02,854
How do I introduce her?

92
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,402
"Here's a girl"

93
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,900
"What can I tell you about her?"

94
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,075
"She's crazy"

95
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,077
"She's different"

96
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:05,249
"Every moment..."
"there's something new about her"

97
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,418
"They shower flowers upon her path
and heads turn, wherever she goes"

98
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,623
"Oh what can I tell you about her?"

99
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,993
Tell me more about her

100
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,165
"She'll throw a tantrum"

101
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:29,668
"But then she comes around..."
"with a smile"

102
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,680
"She'll be quiet, without a word"

103
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,848
"And then she'll start humming..."

104
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:44,853
"a sweet song"

105
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:53,688
"How do I describe her?"

106
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,530
"She's only like herself"

107
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:04,368
"They shower flowers upon her path and
heads turn, wherever she goes"

108
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,716
"What can I tell you about her?"

109
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,419
You miss her?

110
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,584
"Every moment..."

111
00:14:54,293 --> 00:15:02,758
"I spent with her"
"I dream of, I don't know why..."

112
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:12,608
"Memories..."
"of that parting"

113
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:18,272
"hurt me,
I don't know why..."

114
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:26,951
"Now we have parted"

115
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:31,953
"But I pray for you,
my friend"

116
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:37,461
"May you find flowers upon your path
and make heads turn, wherever you go"

117
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,646
"Oh what can I tell you about her?"

118
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,657
Stop pacing and say something.

119
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,334
I'm wondering...
whether I ought to tell you.

120
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:11,335
Why not?

121
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,664
You can't take the truth.

122
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,841
Come on, out with it...
whatever this truth is.

123
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,340
And you will hear me out?

124
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:24,679
I will, most patiently. I won't scream,
I won't say "what rubbish"

125
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:33,017
The truth is, you are in love
with Anjali

126
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,361
I know you think, I'm talking rubbish.

127
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,029
Because you don't realise...
you're in love with Anjali.

128
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,031
From Dehradun to Bombay...
you didn't take this trip alone.

129
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,204
Anjali came too, hidden in your heart

130
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,711
And in every girl you met afterwards,
you tried to find Anjali

131
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,717
Sonia. Her tresses reminded
you of Anjali

132
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:05,218
Megha. Her cheese omelettes
were passable

133
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,722
One Ria too. Her smile was
somewhat like Anjali's

134
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,889
But not Anjali. And how could
you find another? Anjali is unique

135
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:23,905
Every girl who looked into your eyes
found, not to herself, but someone else.

136
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:25,910
That was Anjali.

137
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,908
Do you read, Mr Sanjay Stupid Malhotra?

138
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,409
The absolute truth about your life

139
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,249
Absurd

140
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,752
See...? I didn't crack up, never said,

141
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,419
"what rubbish", never even got angry

142
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,792
In spite of the fact that I never
heard such a stupid theory

143
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,528
I said it in the beginning,
you can't take the truth

144
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,860
You are getting irritated.

145
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,103
Anjali and I...
how did you imagine?

146
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,101
Given brains, you'd imagine too.

147
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,773
What rubbish, what rubbish, what rubbish

148
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,602
- Anjali and I are friends, period.
- No point talking to you

149
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,278
Listen to me

150
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,000
- Not a word.
- I don't want to talk to you, either

151
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,126
No one cares to listen

152
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,024
You were right

153
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:14,012
- We men are very selfish.
- If you insist, I'll accept

154
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:19,521
No, it's true.
Men are dogs

155
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,532
And our convictions are so convenient

156
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:34,200
I too concluded so conveniently
that Anjali is mine

157
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:41,875
I mean, she'll always be
where she is...

158
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:49,218
waiting for me to marry her
when it's convenient for me

159
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,224
I never considered she's human.

160
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,888
That she has her desires, her dreams

161
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:06,730
But what if I'm not part
of her dreams?

162
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,908
Never imagined, someone else
could come into her life

163
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:23,081
And how would Anjali possibly know
something I never told myself?

164
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,989
But then, how could I have
told her?

165
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,760
Only today I have come to know
how dearly I love her

166
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:37,594
Today...

167
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,935
when she is about to marry
someone else

168
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:51,346
I can understand, Sanjay. Some things
can be comprehended only out of loss

169
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,180
So what will you do now?

170
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,118
The 8:40 flight

171
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,455
You're... going... to Dehradun?

172
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,968
I know you're going to be hurt
to see this wedding happen

173
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:27,811
Anjali is about to marry someone else
and yet, you're...?

174
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,484
Ria, you don't understand.
Yes, I'm going

175
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:42,495
But not to attend the wedding,
I'm going to break it up

176
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:50,167
Anjali is only about to marry someone
else, she hasn't done it yet

177
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,009
She'll marry only me

178
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,846
Because, if you follow your heart...

179
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,178
You can change the world?

180
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,712
"May joys abound"

181
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:40,555
"May health abound"

182
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:45,893
"May goodwill abound"

183
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:53,227
"May sorrow be dispelled"

184
00:22:54,439 --> 00:23:06,078
"May peace abound"

185
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,919
Peace? How am I to keep my peace?

186
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:14,915
Please, don't be cross.
Anjali is like a daughter to you

187
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,593
That's exactly why, Vishnu!
This I shall grudge you forever

188
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:25,428
I am her uncle. And you finalised
her wedding without consulting me?

189
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,099
- Goodness!
- You're creating a problem for nothing

190
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:34,108
Now I am "for nothing"!
You be my judge, who's the elder?

191
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,940
- You are my elder.
- And I'm older than you are

192
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,780
- I have finalised this match.
- Look, mother...

193
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,443
- Now what's your problem?
- You're always butting-in

194
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,282
Shut up and touch the sacred fires.

195
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,282
Then embrace your brother

196
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,125
Come on brother, -You'll take
a thrashing someday

197
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:58,302
My husband is a little scared of you.
But my brother-in-law too?

198
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,635
No, his wife scares him worse

199
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:06,975
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Pull down the wall, I say

200
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,640
Ma, if the door isn't facing east...

201
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:16,309
Mother-in-law, you'll pull down walls?
Just for the wedding?

202
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,657
My dear anglicised son-in-law...

203
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,157
I'd rather tear down walls than
defy the scriptures

204
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,819
Bridegrooms never enter from the west!
Good God! This is sacrilege

205
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:31,662
So what Kappo? Lord Rama entered
from the west when he went to wed

206
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,169
- How come?
- Ayodhya is west of Mithila

207
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,672
- How could you forget that?
- How could you forget dear brother?

208
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,513
Lord Rama was exiled for 14 years.
Had he observed the scriptures...

209
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:46,172
Lord Rama would've been happy, no?

210
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,516
Can you match that?

211
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:52,845
Our sister-in-law is matchless!

212
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,853
Convinced him, at long last

213
00:24:56,061 --> 00:25:01,192
I wonder if I could've convinced him
to get married

214
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,204
Anju's wedding is going to be fun!

215
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,538
This sister-in-law of mine...
happens to be everyone's favourite!

216
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,041
And our wedding was no less grand

217
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:17,371
Yes, but there's no sign of the one
who regaled everyone at your wedding

218
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,547
- Who...?
- Sanju

219
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,438
- Bahadur Singh, are the gates washed?
- Yes

220
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,904
Plant the new saplings

221
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,407
You said the prayers without
waiting for me?

222
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,917
- Sorry "girlfriend", I'm late.
- Not too late

223
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,925
- There's much you can do.
- That's why, I've come

224
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,425
- Hello Uncle!
- There you are

225
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,765
- All set?
- All upset

226
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,598
The engagement is next Sunday.
And everyone is in an uproar

227
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:15,940
I'm going to the office.

228
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,267
You've got to take care of everything.

229
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,772
- Has everyone arrived?
- Everyone.

230
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,275
- Uncle, aunt...?
- Both

231
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:26,109
- I better time my entry.
- Rascal! Go in, I'll join you

232
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,453
Take in Sanjay's luggage

233
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,121
- I'll be back in two hours.
- No, please...

234
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,282
Hey girl...
I'll pull your hair

235
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,290
Stay back

236
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:45,796
First, have you found someone who can
straighten you out? A nice girl, like me?

237
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:50,837
Now... what can I say.
You married him and broke my heart

238
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:56,472
Somehow, I found someone.
Now I hear she's getting married too

239
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:03,310
- Nice girl?
- Nice? Mind-blowing

240
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,817
- More mind-blowing than me?
- You're unsurpassable

241
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,993
She's somewhat like you.

242
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,997
Could be a little sister to you?

243
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,994
Oh, but what good is all that now?

244
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,667
That boy is incorrigible

245
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:29,177
- My obeisances to the Aunt. Bless you...
- Enough, enough, enough...

246
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,515
Aren't you a bit too early for a
post-wedding appearance?

247
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,509
I would have come earlier were it not
for a black cat that crossed my path

248
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:42,526
- Goodness! And then?
- I took a round trip to get here

249
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,354
- That's the right thing to do.
- Forget all that

250
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,026
- Have you met Anju?
- I'll be seeing her

251
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,428
Look her up, before I leave...
I mean, I got to be going out

252
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,041
How's the business?
How is Wall Street treating you?

253
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,711
- Anjali is upstairs.
- Upstairs... Anjali

254
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,372
Yes, go on

255
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,215
Sanju Uncle!

256
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,550
Hi! Kutkut, You recognised me?

257
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:11,552
- Yes and Grandpa wants to see you.
- Good Lord!

258
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,718
- Obeisances, Uncle.
- Keep the obeisances for later

259
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,725
First, out there in Bombay
have you married secretly?

260
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,388
- Good Lord!
- Good Lord! Without your approval...

261
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,900
- Can I ever marry?
- Look at him, how understanding

262
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:32,906
What a good boy! And take our Anjali
...have you met her?

263
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,074
- Sanju! You haven't met Anjali yet?
- No Nilu-didi

264
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,409
But why is everyone all
agog about Anjali?

265
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,921
- Sanju, what's this I hear?
- Hello Grannie

266
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,750
Bless you. Haven't you seen Anju yet?

267
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,585
I will, I will, please sit down

268
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,091
- What's the hurry?
- But of course...

269
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,591
Sanju! Here you are...
Anjali is waiting for you

270
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,934
- Where...?
- Upstairs. Now come on

271
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,600
- Let me say hi to the others.
- Later. Now come along

272
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:06,599
Oh come on, we've been expecting you
for ages. I mean, Anjali is waiting

273
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,607
- Waiting for me... why?
- Would I know?

274
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,774
It's between you and your Anjali.

275
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,611
Go, she's waiting. Excuse me

276
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,289
Now he's floored

277
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,472
Today, little Anju, you've had it

278
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:49,885
Getting smart with Sanju?

279
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,687
- You aren't giving me the slip.
- Come on

280
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,001
Let me see how can you
escape from me

281
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:37,334
- Nice couple, no?
- Yes.

282
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:45,000
Could've been better
Could've been you

283
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,045
That's what I always thought.

284
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:57,718
Whatever we think... marriages
are made in Heaven

285
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:09,499
Could've been different.
Nilu could've been my Aunt Nilu

286
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:16,730
"If you're in love,
why is the heart afraid of love?"

287
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:23,570
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello Mr Khanna

288
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,909
- Weren't you supposed to come yesterday?
- If you wish, I'll leave

289
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,078
You see, I just couldn't stay away.

290
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:34,691
Went to Delhi for few days
But couldn't stay there.

291
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,755
Where's our girl? Where's Anjali?

292
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,097
- I'm here.
- There she is

293
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,102
- Samosas. For you.
- Bless you

294
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,766
No. First, what did you
get from Delhi?

295
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,769
Blackmailing me? Wait...

296
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:57,107
till you're married. Then I'll make you
cook hot samosas for me every day

297
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,944
I could cook for you. But your son, the
doctor, will he let you eat fries?

298
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:06,116
Between you and I and samosas
how did that fool crop up?

299
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:11,620
When is Rohit coming?

300
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,290
Sanjay, come over here

301
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,802
- Sanjay. He's Mr. Malhotra's son.
- The late Mr. Malhotra...?

302
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,968
- The one whose house I bought?
- Yes

303
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,305
So you are Sanjay!

304
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,810
Though we've never met,
I know your entire history

305
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,809
Anju speaks so much about you.
Whenever she's at our place...

306
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:38,148
she starts reeling off, here's Sanju's
room, this is where we played carrom...

307
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:43,316
so on and so forth.
Do come over some day

308
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,827
- It's your house.
- Was. Now it's yours

309
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,326
Anjali still calls it
Sanju's house

310
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,502
Silly, doesn't even realise
where she's going

311
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:03,671
After Mr. Malhotra died in the accident,
he moved to Bombay. Settled down well

312
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:14,189
Destiny is strange. Motherless boy,
at 20, he lost his father too

313
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,692
But he didn't break down

314
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,691
I like that boy

315
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:27,203
This is still here?

316
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,030
Last year...

317
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,697
there was talk of cutting down this
branch. For 3 days, I cried

318
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,375
I went on hunger strike for 2 days
and at last, Papa relented

319
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,211
Why not let him cut it if he wants?

320
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:42,545
How could I...? You made this swing

321
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:48,723
For hours we sat on this swing
as we plotted our mischief

322
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,559
- Come, sit.
- I hope it doesn't break

323
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,732
If it hasn't broken in all these years
how can it break now? Come

324
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:04,901
You see? An old relationship
never lets you down

325
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,373
- Go on, shoot.
- What...?

326
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:16,744
I know what's your tricky head
is full of

327
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:22,415
- Full of what?
- Questions, countless questions

328
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:26,085
- About him.
- About whom?

329
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:32,259
About Rohit, stupid. Who else?
Everyone is asking about him

330
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,931
But I haven't told anyone anything

331
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,098
Because I wanted you
to be the first to know

332
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,974
Rohit... where do I begin?

333
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,713
Last year... Rohit's father came
to live in your house.

334
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:53,883
Papa told you, no?

335
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,418
Rohit has never come here.

336
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,091
Lives in America. He's a doctor

337
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,958
His father is a very nice person.

338
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,564
He started socialising with us

339
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:11,364
His house was always like a second home
to me, ever since your times

340
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,373
Everyone was worried about my trip
to America.

341
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:22,183
Rohit was out there. Uncle Khanna
assured us, there's no reason for worry.

342
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,149
That assured Papa

343
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,914
But I was so apprehensive.

344
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,351
Remember, I called you from the airport?

345
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,199
The prospect of travelling to America
all alone was so daunting

346
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,828
You were the one who gave me courage.

347
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:46,909
Were it not for your encouragement...
I might never have met Rohit

348
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,744
Takes a fool to shoot himself
in the leg

349
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,415
and I stepped right into the gun?

350
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:06,563
That a few days with Rohit would lead
us into this, I never expected

351
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:11,226
We hadn't quite met each other,

352
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,097
hardly had we got to know each other...

353
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,940
when his father made the proposal.

354
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,769
Papa asked me and I said yes

355
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:25,838
And look, we're getting ready
for the wedding

356
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:31,013
Sanju I need you to encourage me
once again.

357
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,915
I'm so nervous

358
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,749
Getting married for the
first time, you see

359
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,958
But now you're here and I know.

360
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,297
Everything is going to be fine

361
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,060
Mine is going to be
one memorable wedding

362
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,130
Anjali, over here...

363
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,568
Coming, Didi (Didi: Sister)

364
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:07,183
One memorable wedding, for sure.

365
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:13,591
You won't forget it. Nor your Rohit

366
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,432
- Your paan.
- Paan? Thanks

367
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,201
I've had a word with the priest.

368
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,971
The kulfi supplier is confirmed. 5,500

369
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,611
Bagged the queen already?

370
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,977
He still needs a cover for score

371
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,580
Here you go

372
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:47,321
Uncle, bad luck! Lost your queen

373
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,129
- For him, nothing new.
- What do you mean?

374
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,495
Means nothing.

375
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,471
Just put your heart into the game.
Winning, losing... makes no difference.

376
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,097
Right?

377
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,506
Now what's on your mind?

378
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,144
- Rohit.
- What about Rohit?

379
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:05,406
Unlike you, I know nothing about him.

380
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,311
Know what? He's a doctor

381
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,242
- Where?
- In America

382
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,351
Where in America?

383
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,483
You got an address?
A telephone number? Something?

384
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:14,919
Anjali would know.

385
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,526
Is that all you care for her?

386
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,428
About the two of you, he wanted
to satisfy himself fully

387
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,663
While you were waiting for approvals.

388
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,271
He was investigating you thoroughly

389
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:34,572
Before the wedding was finalised,
he had every detail about you

390
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:42,581
Your photo was vetted even by the
farthest-flung relative

391
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:49,856
Naturally, it's a brother's duty to vet
his sister's prospective suitors

392
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,689
And how have you investigated Rohit?

393
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,127
You don't even have his numbers

394
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,864
Sanju, think before you speak.

395
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,196
Sorry, I said what I felt right

396
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,534
Strange, no?

397
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,707
Here's a wedding in the offing and

398
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,244
no one has even seen the boy's photo?

399
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,074
Well, modern times

400
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,245
Look, nothing's wrong

401
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,950
He belongs to a nice family.

402
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,883
And we were from bad ones?

403
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:23,026
- No, I mean, his parents are nice.
- And our parents were bad?

404
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,898
- Photo! Must-see!
- You must show us a photo

405
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,502
Quiet, I'm telling you.

406
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,332
Why are the kids after you, Anjali?

407
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,374
- She won't show us his photo.
- Whose photo?

408
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,943
- Her fiance's.
- I don't have any photos

409
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,546
Yes, she has his photo.

410
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,246
Uncle, will you scold them?

411
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,112
Kids, stop harassing her
and get lost

412
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:51,918
Come on, sit beside me

413
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:56,921
- Come on, show it to me.
- What?

414
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:58,523
Your fiance's photo

415
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:01,928
Go on, let him see the photo.

416
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,099
In my time, I went to town...
with your grandfather's photo.

417
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:09,671
I showed him off to everyone...
the barber, the tailor, the confectioner

418
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:17,011
You can see Rohit when he comes.
Day after tomorrow

419
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:20,306
Upto you if you want to wait
till day after

420
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:25,284
But the eager will come to
Sanju, the magic man

421
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,285
The bridegroom's photo.

422
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,792
How did he get his hands on it?

423
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:33,960
Rohit's photo?

424
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,625
Where did you find it?

425
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,962
I know every inch of your room

426
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,810
Sanju... don't you dare...

427
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:43,526
"I just heard..."
"you've chosen a mate for life"

428
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,964
"Now that you've made your choice..."

429
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,432
"tell us what is he like?"

430
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,051
"He's incomparable"
"He's smart and he's straight"

431
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:07,713
"And everyone thinks he's nice"

432
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,061
"He never lies"
"He never poisons minds"

433
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:18,133
"At heart, he's clean and honest"

434
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,661
"Understand, kid?"

435
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,168
"Tell me, or can't you?"
"What's his species?"

436
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:06,947
"Unlike you, he isn't trash"
"He belongs to the new age"

437
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:28,969
"Did you take pity on him?"
"Did he come crying to you?"

438
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,734
"Tell me, trust me"

439
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:38,812
- "I know what you're getting at"
- "I warned her"

440
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:42,975
"Got to investigate boys, you know"

441
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,219
"Be quiet"

442
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:47,990
"We just heard..."

443
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,490
"you've chosen a mate for life"

444
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,889
"But why did you have to make
such a choice?"

445
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,495
"What a choice"

446
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:33,598
"Does he keep mum? Is he a chatterbox?
How boring is he?"

447
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:38,804
"Wherever he is, he makes
such sparkling conversation"

448
00:44:56,427 --> 00:45:01,228
"Is he Indian? Is he British?
"Is he an oaf? Is he witty?"

449
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:05,562
"Is he brave, like me?"

450
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:11,233
- "Is he useless?"
- "How good will he be as a husband?"

451
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:15,503
"Just make sure he isn't like him"

452
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,644
"Surely not that type"

453
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,242
"We just heard..."

454
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,749
"you've chosen a mate for life"

455
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,183
"Well, now that you've made
your choice..."

456
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,754
"will you tell us what he's like?"

457
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:32,589
"Whatever you heard,
is absolutely correct"

458
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:37,597
"I have chosen my mate, but why should
I tell you about him?"

459
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:02,019
Can I take a walk?

460
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,293
Whose wedding is it?

461
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:05,621
Who's arriving? Rohit!

462
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,694
Then Rohit get's red carpet

463
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:11,127
Move it... not on that.
Get lost

464
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:57,179
One minute

465
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:05,844
- Strange! No obeisances?
- Good Lord!

466
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,093
Bless you.

467
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,864
Before anyone else...
I wanted to pay my respects to you.

468
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:20,032
Bless me...

469
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,872
that I may imbibe at least in part...

470
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,375
the ethics and the morality that
you have taught everyone

471
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,376
May such come to be

472
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,649
- Obeisances, Uncle.
- May you live long

473
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:42,381
On my way, I carried oblations from
the temple of the Mother Goddess

474
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:48,329
Aunt, this book is for you.
Feng shui

475
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:50,457
What's that?

476
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:53,729
Ancient scriptures from China

477
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,905
- Scriptures!
- Your favourite, no?

478
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,900
Wonderful! May you live long

479
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,611
Were I a son in this house
instead of a son-in-law...

480
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:11,686
you'd surely expect that before
I pay my respects to you...

481
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:16,923
I must obeisances to grandmother
and then to uncle and aunt

482
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:19,758
That's why...

483
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,760
- I hope I wasn't wrong.
- Oh no

484
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:31,440
Bless you

485
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,777
Bless you, son

486
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:40,176
Welcome Mr. Khanna

487
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:06,336
Will you never enter the sea?
Will you only watch from ashore?

488
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:11,876
Why drown yourself to learn what
someone else's mistakes can teach you?

489
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,224
You... must be Sanjay?

490
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:35,668
Guy Number Two who's close to Anjali.

491
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:36,338
Number One

492
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:38,504
Number Two, is you

493
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,771
Just like Anjali described you.

494
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:47,914
Where's my Anjali?

495
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:04,033
Lord...

496
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:07,798
now I'm here

497
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,601
Let not this silly girl
pester You any longer

498
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:14,475
She can ask me for anything
she wants

499
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:19,147
- Rohit, what are you doing here?
- Like you, praying

500
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,953
This is unbecoming of you

501
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,728
I asked your grandmother's permission.

502
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:34,621
What have you done?

503
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:36,399
I've fallen in love with you

504
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,634
- Now what do you want?
- I've travelled far

505
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:46,504
I ought to be rewarded

506
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,748
As of now, you're in a temple.

507
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,979
Oblations, is all you'll get here

508
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:00,923
Period

509
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:09,425
I'm making do, Lord.
But You must intercede

510
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:14,331
How can he better you?
Sanjay is the best

511
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:21,108
No Ria. I was over-confident.
But I don't compare with him

512
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:33,122
I think I should cook up an excuse
and leave tomorrow itself

513
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,022
Is Anjali there?

514
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:42,025
Where can she go?

515
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:46,234
I mean, is she there with you?
Can you see her?

516
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:51,970
Yes, I can see her.

517
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:53,373
Only Anjali?

518
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:09,588
You see what you're leaving behind?
You did it once

519
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:13,052
A second time...?
Will you be able to forgive yourself?

520
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:16,999
Do you still want to come back?

521
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:22,866
No, not without Anjali

522
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,064
And... that Rohit?

523
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:31,844
Rohit? Forget it, Sanjay is the best

524
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:42,013
There you are Sanju. Anu and Rajesh
are expecting you for breakfast

525
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:46,351
- It's stuffed fried pancakes.
- I prefer this sweet you make

526
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:49,760
Put that back.
It's for offering to the Gods

527
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:53,769
Okay

528
00:52:56,573 --> 00:53:02,375
Call Anjali. She hasn't had breakfast,
isn't out of bed. What's she upto?

529
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,446
- Say that again.
- Anjali

530
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:13,385
My name sounds so different
when I hear you speak it

531
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,217
Say my full name

532
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:22,792
The name that's going to be mine

533
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:32,901
Anju, your mother wants you downstairs

534
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:39,911
Put the phone down.

535
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:42,911
If you want to go, you disconnect

536
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:47,086
You know it, I can't disconnect
until you disconnect

537
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,148
Disconnect

538
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:53,353
No, you do it

539
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:00,595
Let's do it
at the count of three

540
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:02,771
One

541
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:04,932
Two

542
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:06,608
Three

543
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:08,641
You haven't disconnected yet

544
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:17,646
No, how many times?

545
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:27,055
Disconnect... Please

546
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:28,858
Done. Now come on

547
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:33,127
Disconnected?

548
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:46,642
Rohit, your chocolate and ma'am,
your boring strawberry

549
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,543
- What's so boring?
- You'll only find out...

550
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:54,984
Once you try another flavour.
Have you ever tried anything else?

551
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,989
None of your fault, though.
It's your life that's so boring

552
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:05,327
Look at me, some black currant,
some mango, dash of mint

553
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:09,502
Lollipop, also. Variety my dear,
is the spice of life.

554
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,271
Say what?

555
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:18,002
But when I look at you,
I think your life's boring too

556
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,451
In your life, I'm sure,
Anjali is the first and last girl

557
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:32,855
You mean, you had girlfriends?
Before Anjali?

558
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:56,951
Girls, who make friends.
But more girl than friend, yes?

559
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:04,056
Rohit, how come I know nothing
about your girlfriends?

560
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:10,430
Maybe because... you don't know?
You never told her?

561
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,903
I always wanted to tell you.
But you always said...

562
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:16,834
you aren't interested in my past.

563
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,906
I wasn't. Now I am

564
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,306
Me too. Go on tell us.

565
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:28,244
Fine. Our relationship...
will be grounded in truth.

566
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,519
Ask whatever you wish.
You got the right to know

567
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:40,320
What we want to know is,
how many girlfriends?

568
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,099
Count

569
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:54,533
- I think four, no actually, five.
- Five? How long ago was this fifth?

570
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:58,007
Say, three months.

571
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:02,607
When you were seeing me...
you had a girl friend?

572
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:04,145
Yes, but...

573
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:09,023
when I saw you for the first time
I realised that you are the girl...

574
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:16,463
I want to spend a lifetime with.
I told her, she understood

575
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,631
Really? That's so amazing!

576
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,469
Why get worked up over that?

577
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:29,703
Everyone has a past. It's natural.
If you had a past, I won't get upset

578
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,240
Anjali's past! I'm Anjali's past!

579
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,652
Boring as her life is...
there was no friend, except me.

580
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:38,916
No chance of your getting upset

581
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:43,819
Sanjay, don't but in.
Rohit, I'm really hurt

582
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:45,922
You shouldn't have hidden it from me.

583
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:48,160
What's there to be hidden?

584
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:49,828
Why didn't you tell me?

585
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,930
What's there to be told?

586
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:57,328
Not to be told and nothing to hide?
What's this all about?

587
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:00,267
- Nothing. For nothing, Anjali...
- For nothing...?

588
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:06,513
My fiance has had five affairs
and till this day, I don't know?

589
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:10,208
- Three happened when I was in school.
- I don't want to hear anything

590
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:14,751
People are staring.

591
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:20,355
Not for another minute... do I wish to
embarrass you, Mr. Rohit Khanna

592
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:33,532
- Sanju, will you drop me home?
- May I have my ice cream? No...? Okay

593
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:38,437
Got to go

594
00:58:55,265 --> 00:59:01,568
You're so nice, but that's
also why you must die

595
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:10,076
You got to go, Rohit. Go away
from Anjali. Far away. Forever

596
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:27,952
Poor guy

597
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,164
Was nice

598
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:45,838
I ought to be thanking you.

599
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:47,783
Even unwittingly...

600
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:50,612
You've played a major role in
cementing my relationship with Anjali.

601
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:52,454
How so...?

602
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:58,889
Back in America... Anjali told me about
the swing you rigged up for her.

603
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,456
For her... it's a cherished childhood
memory.

604
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:05,058
- And guess what I did?
- What?

605
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:09,965
I rigged a swing too.
Then I did it up with flowers,

606
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:12,834
and I held her eyes shut...

607
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,109
as I took her to sit on the swing
and that was when I asked her...

608
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:19,315
Anjali, will you marry me?

609
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:28,423
She opened her eyes, saw the swing
And she gave me a quiet smile

610
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:36,688
Till this day I don't know what
she smiled at. Me? Or the swing?

611
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:39,096
The swing, of course

612
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,908
Yesterday, Anjali misbehaved with you.
In your place, I'd stop talking to her

613
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:52,841
- What? I was about to call her.
- How silly

614
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:56,250
You see Rajesh?
You'll end up like him. Henpecked

615
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,244
- Take my advice, you needn't call her.
- Why?

616
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:02,520
She fought with you.
Let her apologise

617
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:06,854
- But Sanjay...
- Trust me, I know her

618
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:11,356
You needn't say a word. Tonight, at the
engagement, she will apologise

619
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,933
How about a light massage for me?

620
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:27,614
- What did he say on the phone?
- Nothing?

621
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:31,883
- But he surely said something?
- He never even called

622
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:36,616
- Doesn't he call every morning?
- All except this morning

623
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:40,722
- Maybe he's jogging.
- That was hours ago

624
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,828
- Was he all right?
- He was enjoying himself

625
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:50,065
Said he had a good night's sleep
and he was looking so fresh

626
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,171
- I think he's still annoyed.
- Annoyed he is

627
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:58,975
- So that's why he never called.
- That's like a man

628
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:05,080
Not crazy, like me. In his place,
I would've called ten times by now

629
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,313
And I would've realised my mistake
and I would've apologised

630
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,589
But not Rohit. He'll never do that.

631
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:13,656
Because he knows...

632
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:14,930
If he takes the first step,

633
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,595
you will forever have the upper hand

634
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:23,265
And Rohit is unputdownable.
He's so smart

635
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:31,012
I could never be as clever.
I'll slave for my wife

636
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:44,552
You wanted to say sorry, no?
Go ahead. He isn't stone-hearted

637
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:45,892
He will forgive you.

638
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:48,891
Why should Anjali apologise?

639
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:52,293
Rohit is to blame for making
a mountain for a molehill

640
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:57,303
Anu, he is Anjali's fiance.
She can misbehave with her friends

641
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:01,466
- She can do it to me. But Rohit...
- I can do it to Rohit too

642
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:07,309
And you needn't take sides with Rohit.
Whose friend are you? Mine or his?

643
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:17,050
And I won't to talk to him unless he
calls me. Tell your clever friend that

644
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:18,323
But Anjali...

645
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:21,496
Anu...

646
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,934
Sanjay, you're a genius

647
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:43,510
Nice pair

648
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:47,848
Could be nicer

649
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:53,761
Could be... someone else?
Could be... you...?

650
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:01,697
Didn't I tell you?
Marriages are made in Heaven

651
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:09,443
And I say, follow your heart
and you can change the world

652
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:16,647
- Meaning...?
- It's no more than an engagement

653
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,885
Whether it will culminate
in a wedding...?

654
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:31,124
- I do not understand...
- Keep watching. You'll get to know

655
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:38,400
"The braves will carry
their brides home"

656
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:42,399
- Why aren't you talking to me?
- I don't want to talk to you

657
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:48,678
Are you annoyed?

658
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:55,154
- Why didn't you call me?
- You didn't call me either

659
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:56,353
Bachelor party?

660
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:02,363
- Will be great fun man!
- What gives you those grins?

661
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:12,105
Tomorrow, we're having
a bachelor's party

662
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:17,045
- I said, I don't want to discuss it.
- What would you rather discuss?

663
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,175
- When are we coming back from America?
- What...?

664
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:28,283
I asked, after the wedding, when do we
come on vacations from America?

665
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,520
Whenever you wish.
Let's get married first

666
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:38,065
- Are you trying to be evasive?
- Evasive? What are you saying?

667
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:43,298
We got to decide these things
before we get married

668
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:46,406
- Really?
- Yes

669
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:53,080
But make sure no one
gets an inkling

670
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,483
- No one gets an inkling.
- Not a soul

671
01:05:55,685 --> 01:06:00,213
No one gets to know

672
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:06,020
- No one gets to know, what?
- Nothing

673
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:10,499
I Rohit Khanna...

674
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,828
swear by God...

675
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:18,500
that after I'm married...

676
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,743
My wife Anjali...

677
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:23,773
once every year...

678
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:26,773
sometimes twice a year...

679
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:32,517
- We never discussed twice a year.
- You said, whenever I wish

680
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,016
Yes, whenever. But twice a year?

681
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:41,352
Are you trying to tell me... that I
can't come visiting twice a year?

682
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:46,524
The home where I spent my entire
childhood... where my parents live...

683
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:50,194
Yes Anjali, but in some years...
we might not be able to make it twice

684
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:54,467
I'm a doctor, I got to work,
build a career

685
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:58,812
Your career means everything?
My parents mean nothing?

686
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,277
You won't even give me
such a small request?

687
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:24,899
How about celebrating this half
of a wedding over dinner?

688
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:44,517
Already at it?
Wonderful

689
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:53,329
But why go partying so far away?

690
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:59,673
- These bachelor parties... are best
done on the sly. - But why?

691
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:06,676
Because if we women get to know of
their antics, these men have had it

692
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:12,678
- Will there be song and dance?
- And women

693
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:18,786
My sister-in-law says, you got to
see one of these parties...

694
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:25,797
- ...to see what scoundrels men can be.
- Then I'm going, for sure

695
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:31,504
For all his naive looks, who knows
your brother might be a scoundrel

696
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:36,804
I'm going too.
Must see what Naren is upto

697
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:40,478
I got to keep an eye on Raju.
And there's Rohit. It's said...

698
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:45,810
the bachelor who's being given the
party might do just about anything

699
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:47,917
Let's see what Rohit demands

700
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:52,050
Wonderful party

701
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,167
He has organised this party

702
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:23,358
Cigarettes?

703
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:30,093
- Ajit too? What a revelation!
- Now I know!

704
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:35,526
- Sanju said it'd be a lively party...
- I know, where are the babes?

705
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,366
I can't wait!

706
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:42,533
Be patient and you will
be rewarded, sweetly

707
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:46,044
I don't mind the sours,
but I can't wait

708
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:48,045
At this grievous juncture...

709
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:53,381
before another bachelor falls
to the blade of matrimony...

710
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:56,717
here's from me and from the
brotherhood of bachelors...

711
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,894
a requiem, in the words
of Mr Sanjay Malhotra

712
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:03,587
Today, weds my friend.
But I am not happy

713
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:08,396
Love, culminates into marriage.
But I'm far from happy

714
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:12,472
I stopped him, I even tried
to reason with him

715
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:16,574
For friendship's sake,
I told him

716
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,748
I posed obstacles for him,
I lay a thorn in his path

717
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,918
Like a blossom,
I even tried wilting

718
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:27,084
He's walking away with the most
beautiful flower of Spring...

719
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:29,924
it's like a wedding in Eden.

720
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:30,917
But I'm far from happy

721
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:35,092
At my friend's wedding,
I'm unhappy

722
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:39,931
Love, culminating into marriage
but I'm far from happy

723
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:23,300
"Swaying, gyrating..."

724
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:44,159
"lighting fires in hearts..."
"with my eyes"

725
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:54,540
"Spark"

726
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:57,212
"I'm a spark"

727
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:52,558
"My body is like flame"
"Don't you get too near"

728
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:57,564
"In the fires of the lamp..."

729
01:12:57,973 --> 01:13:01,909
"die those who hover too close"

730
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:08,238
"You loonies..."
"try to understand"

731
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:13,251
"Keep distance..."
"while you watch me"

732
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:21,152
"Spark..."

733
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,627
"I'm spark"

734
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:30,768
"Spark..."

735
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,564
"I'm spark"

736
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:08,036
"Like lightning I strike"

737
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:13,471
"Like snake I sting"

738
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:18,478
"I'm the ecstasy
"that makes you swoon"

739
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:22,848
"I can bring out
your true colours"

740
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:28,688
"I can be the fragrance
on your breath"

741
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:34,032
"In a moment..."
"I can sway your heart"

742
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:41,536
"Spark"

743
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:44,375
"I'm spark"

744
01:14:54,423 --> 01:15:04,230
"Swaying and gyrating..."

745
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,460
"lighting fires in hearts..."

746
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:11,965
"with your eyes"

747
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:19,146
"Spark... sparkle"

748
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,146
"You're a spark"

749
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:29,481
Spark - Spark...

750
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:41,334
I'm a spark
