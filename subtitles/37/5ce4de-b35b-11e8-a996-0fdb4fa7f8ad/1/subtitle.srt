1
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,198
Jackson, you going to go to Hong Kong?

2
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,739
I love anything full-contact.
I need a few more scars on my face.

3
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,708
I heard you can get killed at that kumite.

4
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,539
Only if you fuck up.

5
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,057
Tomorrow we leave for the kumite.

6
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,204
Sir?

7
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,979
Excuse me.

8
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,644
Col. Cooke would like to see you
before you leave.

9
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,448
What's the problem?

10
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,451
He found out you're going to Hong Kong.
He wants to talk to you about it.

11
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,790
Tell him I'll be right there
after I take a shower.

12
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,055
But I'll have to wait, sir.

13
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,356
Okay.

14
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,335
What's taking so long, Captain?

15
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,335
Captain?

16
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,345
Shit!

17
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,431
Sir!

18
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,033
Where's Dux?

19
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,666
He was at the gym, like you said.

20
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,939
He took a shower,
I waited, and he disappeared.

21
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,377
What do you mean, disappeared?

22
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,279
One minute he's there, then gone.

23
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,410
Jesus Christ!
If anything happens to Dux in Hong Kong...

24
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,420
Get Helmer and Rawlins
on this right away.

25
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,582
And I don't want to see your face again
until Dux is beside it!

26
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,488
Understand?

27
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,034
How is he?

28
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,206
He's resting now.
He'll be so happy to see you.

29
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,713
It's so good to be here again.

30
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,582
I'll tell him you are here.

31
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,022
Thank you.

32
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,242
Look at the sword!

33
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,847
Let's get it.

34
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,789
Come on, Frank.
What's the matter, you chicken?

35
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,723
- No.
- Then get in here.

36
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,154
Frank, you want to hang out with us,
then come on!

37
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,461
You just going to stand there,
or are you going to grab something?

38
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,506
Shit! They're coming back!
Let's get out of here!

39
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,040
Come on, Frank!

40
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,973
Forget him! Let's go!

41
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,393
That's enough, Shingo.

42
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,193
Go to your studies.

43
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,972
You cannot get katana sword by stealing.

44
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,372
It is a very special sword.

45
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,844
You must earn it.

46
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,245
I wasn't going to steal it.

47
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,785
You didn't flinch. You have fighting spirit.

48
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,528
You're not gonna call the cops?

49
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,731
Not if we make a deal.

50
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,898
What kind of a deal?

51
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,970
Your son and my son
are in the same school.

52
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,134
Frank sees my son's skill...

53
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,171
...and he desires
to learn martial science, too.

54
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,449
Yes, but what do you mean
by martial science?

55
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,952
Frank has told me
you came to America to grow vines.

56
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,856
Yes, that's right.
I work at the Verne vineyard.

57
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,655
I came here to grow fish in my hatchery.

58
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,128
We both grow children.

59
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,096
You use science
to make vines grow better.

60
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,865
Like vines, children need training.

61
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,840
Martial science provides a way of training.

62
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,477
It brings mind, body, spirit together.

63
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,644
That's enough. That's all for today.

64
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,083
Not yet.

65
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,753
Why don't you quit, round-eye?

66
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,954
Not yet.

67
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,629
Go practice your katas.

68
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,891
How come you coach him, but not me?

69
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,394
I brought you here
to help me train my son.

70
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,666
Don't question me!

71
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,266
If you expect me to be his punching bag,
you can forget about our deal.

72
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,298
Someday...

73
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:26,302
...I'll fight in the kumite
and make my father proud.

74
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,949
Shidoshi, I feel like
I've lost part of my family, too.

75
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:46,184
Shingo and I were close friends,
like brothers.

76
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,923
And you and Mrs. Tanaka...

77
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,729
...have treated me like a son.

78
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,330
What will happen now?

79
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,001
No more training.

80
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,674
I stop now.

81
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,246
But you have so much to teach.

82
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,983
You don't understand.

83
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,750
In the war, I lost my first family...

84
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,696
...my son, daughter, and wife.

85
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,202
They lived in Hiroshima.

86
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,038
I left Japan because of the war.

87
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,676
War was wrong.

88
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,573
I came here to start over...

89
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,410
...begin a new family, have a son...

90
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,586
...another chance to pass on the teaching.

91
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,485
For 2,000 years...

92
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,525
...knowledge passed from father to son...

93
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,324
...father to son.

94
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,731
When Shingo died...

95
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,428
...it stopped.

96
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,638
Teach me. I can do it.

97
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,280
You are not Japanese!
You are not a Tanaka!

98
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,777
You taught me
using any technique that works...

99
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,184
...never to limit myself to one style...

100
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,692
...to keep an open mind!

101
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,351
Why?

102
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,029
To honor you, Shidoshi.

103
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,474
Practice until you can meditate...

104
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,978
...and nothing can distract you...

105
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,206
...so that you see and feel nothing...

106
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,306
...except your own energy.

107
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,812
Are you awake, Shidoshi?

108
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,981
Do you sleep with your eyes open?

109
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,080
How are you feeling?

110
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,253
Like an old man.

111
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,652
And how about you?

112
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,229
I'm going to Hong Kong.

113
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,859
You sure you want to do this?

114
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,862
To honor you means everything to me.

115
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,303
I have poured all my knowledge into you.

116
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:29,611
When you fight, my spirit fights with you.

117
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,577
In kumite, you will need it.

118
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,616
Hey, babe,
want to go out with a real big man?

119
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,423
No, huh?

120
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,563
Too handsome for you, honey?

121
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,705
Is this your first time in Hong Kong?

122
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,811
You two are here for the kumite,
aren't you?

123
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,181
Kumite? What is kumite?

124
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,951
Look, guys,
I know there's a secret full-contact event...

125
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,491
...being held in Hong Kong
in the next few days.

126
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,084
Yes. Hong Kong is an exciting city.

127
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:54,790
I also happen to know a little bit
about some of your competition.

128
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,160
Okay.

129
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,261
Would you just tell me
how you got invited?

130
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,211
Thanks, guys.

131
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,980
What? Think you can
give me some competition?

132
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,016
Sure. I'll try.

133
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,522
That's what I like to hear,
a kid who isn't afraid to lose.

134
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,088
No, I got it.
I don't want to take your money.

135
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,796
- You ready?
- Yeah.

136
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,626
- You like this kind of fighting?
- Yeah.

137
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,834
If you want to see some real fighting,
you can see me fight at the kumite.

138
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,135
I'm here, too, for the kumite.

139
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,437
Aren't you a little young for full-contact?

140
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,241
Arenâ€™t you a little old for video games?

141
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,177
- You want to go at it again, huh?
- Yeah.

142
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,663
Not bad, kid. Name's Ray Jackson.

143
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,962
I'm Frank Dux.

144
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,772
Mrs. Tanaka...

145
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,312
Mrs. Tanaka?

146
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,438
Yes?

147
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,847
It's very important
to the government of the United States...

148
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,681
...that we find Frank Dux.

149
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,553
We understand that
he might have visited Mr. Tanaka recently.

150
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,888
Mr. Tanaka is very ill.

151
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,251
We're sorry to hear that.

152
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,760
Was Frank here recently?

153
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,356
Frank came here to pay his respects.

154
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,827
- When was that?
- Two days ago.

155
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:14,429
Did he say, or do you know
if he was going to Hong Kong?

156
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,774
I don't know.

157
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,967
Of course you know. We're not trying to...

158
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,343
Mrs. Tanaka,
we're very sorry to have disturbed you.

159
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,382
Thank you very much for your time.

160
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,685
- May I help you?
- Yeah, how you doing?

161
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,784
My name's Jackson. This is Mr. Frank Dux.

162
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,850
Are our rooms ready?

163
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,659
Mr. Lin in Room 310 wants to see you
after you check in.

164
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,929
Who the hell's Mr. Lin?

165
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,334
I'm Lin. You Jackson?
You look like a Jackson.

166
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,005
That would make you Frank Ducks.

167
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,374
No, no. It's Dux.

168
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,577
Gotcha. Like "Put up your dukes," right?

169
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,343
Okay, so here's the deal.

170
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,578
This is the biggest kumite ever.

171
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,847
We got fighters from all over.

172
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,752
I've been assigned by the IFAA...

173
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,451
...to help you
and the other North American fighters...

174
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,460
...to find your way around.

175
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,292
I'm gonna make sure
you guys give it your best.

176
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,730
And don't disqualify by fighting
outside the arena.

177
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,692
The Triad, they are like the Mafia...

178
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:22,297
...is allowing us
to hold kumite here this time.

179
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,636
Here it comes, man, the Walled City.

180
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,005
Not a place for outsiders.

181
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,844
You are in Hong Kong.

182
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:37,048
But you are about to cross
an invisible border into mainland China.

183
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,483
No joke, man.

184
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,616
It's a run-down piece of no-mars-land...

185
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,853
...in the middle of a tourist paradise.

186
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:46,989
It goes back to the old lease agreement
between Great Britain and China.

187
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,626
Once you step out of the sunlight
into the narrow corridors...

188
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,432
...it's time to protect your nuts, guys.

189
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,680
Okay, USA!

190
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,117
"Okay, USA!"

191
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,715
Okay, guys.

192
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,512
First, you'll show the Black Dragon boys
your invitation.

193
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,019
Then you got to qualify
and prove to them...

194
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,061
...you can step onto the runway
and not get killed.

195
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,322
Got it?

196
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:33,762
You got it?

197
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,785
It says he represents the Tanaka clan.

198
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,523
You don't look like Tanaka.

199
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,684
Shidoshi Tanaka trained me.

200
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,155
What's the hold up?

201
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,356
He says Senzo Tanaka is his Shidoshi.

202
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:10,164
What's the difference
if Bruce Springsteen is his Shidoshi?

203
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,829
If Senzo Tanaka is his Shidoshi...

204
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,198
...then show us the dim mak.

205
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,566
What the hell is a dim mak?

206
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,775
Death touch.

207
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,447
Thanks.

208
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,618
Vic, choose a brick.

209
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,591
Okay, Frank.

210
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,125
What about this one?

211
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,562
No!

212
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,840
Bottom one.

213
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,741
Son of a bitch!

214
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,044
Is that good enough, guys?

215
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,946
We honor your invitation.

216
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,791
No shit, you honor his invitation!

217
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,219
That was great.

218
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,602
Very good, but brick not hit back.

219
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,090
Here's a picture
of the man we're looking for.

220
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,529
His name is Frank Dux.

221
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:25,133
We have reason to believe
Frank is here in Hong Kong.

222
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,064
His name was on a list...

223
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,402
...on a flight from San Francisco
two days ago.

224
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,907
Two days ago?

225
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,808
Maybe he already left,
went somewhere else.

226
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,570
Asia's a very big place, you know.

227
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,411
We were hoping
you'd hold onto this for reference.

228
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,213
We're here because Frank is
fighting in the kumite...

229
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,516
...and we're here to stop him.

230
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,589
The kumite?

231
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,818
Yes.

232
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,036
Inspector Chen...

233
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,947
...we all know the kumite
is happening here in Hong Kong.

234
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:13,472
And we all know it's going on
over the next three days.

235
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:17,711
All we want you to do is
pass this picture out to your men.

236
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,758
If they spot Dux,
they give us a call at our hotel. Simple.

237
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,850
My men already overworked.

238
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,893
- If it's too much trouble, forget it...
- Inspector...

239
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,196
We're all overworked,
but we need your help.

240
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,961
I'll see what can be done.

241
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,599
You know where to reach us.

242
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,940
You'll come upstairs with me
for an interview.

243
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,513
Like hell! Let go of me.

244
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,173
You want Hussein, no?

245
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,875
No. Hussein is an asshole.

246
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,748
What did you call me?

247
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,345
You want me to spell it out for you?

248
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,086
Leave the girl alone.

249
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,257
He is the American shithead
who makes tricks with bricks.

250
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,994
Guess the kumite starts
one day earlier this year, huh?

251
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,593
- Look, guys, let's all calm down, okay?
- No.

252
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,639
She is coming with me upstairs.

253
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:09,695
No, I'm not.

254
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,435
If we have to fight for her...

255
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,808
...then both of us will
be thrown out of the kumite.

256
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,347
Just for her?

257
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,317
We could arrange this another way.

258
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,447
- Do you gamble?
- What is bet?

259
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,913
You hold this.

260
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,956
If I can grab it before you close your hand...

261
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,689
...I get the girl.

262
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,653
If I cannot...

263
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,290
...she's yours.

264
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,059
Very good.

265
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:40,127
What? You can't do this!

266
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,870
Just relax.

267
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:47,605
Take it.

268
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,746
Geez, Frankie,
I hope you know what you're doing.

269
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,547
Ready?

270
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,317
Go.

271
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,323
You lose, American asshole.

272
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,842
Looks like she's mine.

273
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,338
Now leave the lady alone.
You understand that?

274
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,111
Why were you with Hussein?

275
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,954
I've been trying
to get a story on the kumite.

276
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,550
I'm a reporter.

277
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,327
He tell you anything?

278
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,593
He told me I had nice legs.

279
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,199
He's right about that.

280
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,435
Why is it that no one
will talk about the kumite?

281
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,575
What is this air of mystery?

282
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,511
I'm just trying to find out
what it's all about.

283
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,673
Why are you fighting in it?

284
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,748
It's personal.

285
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,308
You want to prove
your manhood to the world?

286
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:06,289
The kumite is for the fighters,
not for the people who read newspapers.

287
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,856
I've heard that it's unnecessarily brutal...

288
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,988
...like a cockfight, except it's with people.

289
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,457
You have the wrong picture.

290
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,868
Well, you tell me about it then.

291
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,336
I want to have the right picture.

292
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,538
Okay, I'll talk to you, but one condition.

293
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,774
What's that?

294
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,171
You agree to have dinner with me
tomorrow night.

295
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:33,012
Well, actually, I was hoping
Hussein would be free.

296
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,101
That hurts me, just looking at it.

297
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:58,974
Yo, Frankie!

298
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,609
Earth to Frankie.

299
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,272
This is ground control. Do you copy?

300
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,918
It's time to get ready.

301
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,349
You'd better stop doing that stuff.

302
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,417
You might want to have kids
one of these days.

303
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,697
Victor's downstairs.
Kumite Express leaves in five minutes.

304
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,467
Are you ready?

305
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,684
I am ready.

306
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,158
You can almost smell the adrenaline
in this place, can't you?

307
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,327
Yeah.

308
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,738
They are gonna love me over here.

309
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,406
You can really love Asians
because we're good-looking.

310
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,759
Welcome, warriors of the world.

311
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,227
Today you become part of a tradition...

312
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,159
...that began hundreds of years ago.

313
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,563
The kumite was first used
by the Kokuryukai...

314
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,138
...the Black Dragon Society...

315
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,845
...to measure the fighting skills and spirit...

316
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,742
...of its members.

317
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:48,850
Every five years,
the best fighters in its ranks...

318
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,888
...would face each other in full-contact...

319
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:59,322
...with one winner emerging
as the superior warrior...

320
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,796
...the champion.

321
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,256
The Kokuryukai has been joined...

322
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,633
...by the International
Fighting Arts Association...

323
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,467
...as co-sponsor for this event...

324
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,645
...and as the guardians
of a rich and powerful heritage.

325
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,279
After three days...

326
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:22,217
...one fighter will prove himself
to be the best.

327
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,144
May the mightiest warrior prevail!

328
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,492
Now, remember, it's full-contact.

329
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:07,288
There are three ways to win.
One, you knock the guy out.

330
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,295
Two, your opponent quits
and shouts, "matte."

331
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,569
It's like saying uncle.

332
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,162
Three, you throw the fucker
right off the runway.

333
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,531
Piece of cake.

334
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,534
Haji!

335
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,743
Hajime!

336
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,508
That's why they call
this thing "bloodsport," kid.

337
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:30,207
Watch this, Frankie.
I'll show you how it's done, buddy.

338
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:54,493
Haji!

339
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:55,800
Asshole.

340
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,368
Hajime!

341
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,154
Come on, get up! Come on!

342
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,525
I'm going to kill you, man!

343
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:27,902
You got it!

344
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:35,745
Frankie!

345
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,939
Look at him, buddy. Yeah!

346
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,283
You check that out?

347
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,554
- Good stuff, Jackson.
- Thanks.

348
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,189
But what took you so long?

349
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,995
Funny. Real funny.

350
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,496
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

351
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,235
What's going on?

352
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,901
That's Chong Li, the current champ.

353
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,467
He's never been defeated.

354
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,640
Holds all the records,
including the fastest KO.

355
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,384
He killed a guy during the last kumite.

356
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,615
Yeah, kicked the poor bastard
right in the throat.

357
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,053
Guy died right there on the platform.

358
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:23,122
Chong Li stood there and watched him die.

359
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,669
Junbi!

360
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,037
Haji!

361
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,378
Hajime!

362
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,002
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

363
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,942
Now I show you some trick or two.

364
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,239
Junbi!

365
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,046
Haji!

366
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:01,652
Hajime!

367
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,934
Fastest I ever saw!

368
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:45,558
His first fight in the kumite,
he broke the fucking world record!

369
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:46,796
My buddy!

370
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,682
Junbi!

371
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,721
Haji!

372
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,094
Hajime!

373
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,620
Go home!

374
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,456
This is real good stuff.

375
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,088
How's your eel, as good as mine?

376
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,190
I don't know, I haven't tasted it yet.

377
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,599
You gotta tell them to kill it first.

378
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,233
You should ask for forks.

379
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,829
Inspector Chen.

380
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,201
What a pleasant surprise. Please join us.

381
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,834
No. I never eat here.

382
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:43,004
I found some information for you.

383
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,741
What is it, Inspector?

384
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,477
Frank Dux is at the East Lake Hotel
in Kowloon.

385
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,683
Thank you.

386
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,713
Hey, have some eel.

387
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,960
Okay, Dux, you know why we're here.

388
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,433
We're taking you back, Frank. Let's go.

389
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,339
Only when the kumite is over.

390
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,640
Who the hell are these two scumbags?

391
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,477
Just stay out of it, pal.
It's not your business, okay?

392
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,744
I ain't your pal, dickface.

393
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,044
Look, Frank...

394
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:28,383
...the government has invested
a lot of time and money in you.

395
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,450
Uncle Sam can't afford to let you get hurt.

396
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:31,926
I won't get hurt.

397
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:34,896
That's why we're here,
to make sure of that.

398
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,625
Don't make it tough on us.

399
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,311
I'll be in the airport in two days.

400
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,004
That's not good enough.

401
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:56,143
Frank, read my lips.
We are taking you back now.

402
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:01,086
Don't make us use 50,000 volts on you.

403
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:06,384
Excuse me.

404
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:08,860
You want to shit sparks?

405
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,763
You just stay put, okay?

406
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:12,625
Stay put.

407
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,421
All those different fighters in one event.

408
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,460
- It sounds wild.
- You'd have to see it to believe it.

409
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,392
Come on, Frank.

410
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,322
Couldn't you just get me in?

411
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,561
I really want this story.
It would mean so much to me.

412
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:27,866
They have strict rules. No press.

413
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,973
I bet we could think of something.

414
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,069
I doubt it.

415
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,370
You telling me you never break rules?

416
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:35,604
What do you mean?

417
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,744
Who are Helmer and Rawlins?

418
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,215
Just friends. Why?

419
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,879
They must be very close friends.

420
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,454
They've been inquiring about you
all over Hong Kong.

421
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,317
What do you want from me?

422
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:53,221
I'd really like you to help me
get into the kumite.

423
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,529
But more than that...

424
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,196
...I'd really like to get to know you.

425
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,206
After all, we have all night.

426
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,792
I have to go.

427
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,084
I know.

428
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,155
Good luck today.

429
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,728
Thanks.

430
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,733
Meet me for dinner again tonight?

431
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:09,894
Sure.

432
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,439
About the kumite, I'm sorry.

433
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,273
I cannot help you.

434
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,645
It's okay.

435
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,979
I'll get over it.

436
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,192
See you.

437
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,967
Where the hell have you been?

438
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:15,369
You can't just disappear
in the middle of kumite like that!

439
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,667
I got a rep to uphold, you know.

440
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,536
You and Jackson don't tell me nothing.

441
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,612
You guys are driving me crazy!

442
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,407
Right now, hurry up and change.

443
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,909
Pick a brick, any brick.

444
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,542
I know. The bottom one, right?

445
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,856
See? Not a scratch on it.

446
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,901
Neither is this.

447
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,735
For you.

448
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,077
Yo, Frankie.

449
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,144
I hope we don't bump heads.

450
00:51:58,315 --> 00:51:59,748
Come on, let's do it, buddy.

451
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,381
Feel strong today?

452
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,013
I feel fine.

453
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,120
Good. You're a good fighter.

454
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:07,681
- Good.
- Thanks.

455
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:21,100
This isn't the first time
I've had to go undercover to get a story.

456
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,689
Chong Li! Chong Li!

457
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,046
Junbi!

458
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,742
Haji!

459
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,937
Hajime!

460
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,685
All right, Frankie! Yeah!

461
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:07,029
Dux! Dux!

462
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,771
Time to separate the men from the boys.

463
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:20,280
Just be careful Chong Li doesn't separate
your head from your body.

464
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,677
Go for the gut. He's soft there.

465
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:25,448
What are you talking about?

466
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,455
Chong Li's weak in the gut.

467
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,684
That's how Parades surprised him.

468
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,123
You listening to me?

469
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:34,788
Go for the stomach
and stay away from his right leg.

470
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:38,167
Will you stop worrying, Frankie?
I've got it under control.

471
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,662
You sound like my mother. Man alive.

472
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,433
Junbi!

473
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,574
Haji!

474
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,416
Hajime!

475
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:05,924
I got him!

476
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:08,428
What are you doing? Keep going!

477
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,425
Jackson! Jackson!

478
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,102
I put him down!

479
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:21,403
He's dead! I got him! Yeah!

480
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,788
No! Stop!

481
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,214
Chong Li! Chong Li!

482
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,891
Come back, Frank!

483
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:54,468
Ray, I'm here.

484
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:00,403
The doctor says you're going to be okay.

485
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:03,978
You are lucky you have a head like a rock.

486
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:06,241
Yeah, you'll be out of here in a week.

487
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,045
I'll get back at Chong Li.

488
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,322
That's a promise.

489
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,425
You think that's what he wants,
someone to share a room with?

490
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:20,062
Janice, stay out of this.

491
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,687
Frank, I don't want to see you get hurt.

492
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,326
Then don't watch.

493
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,459
If you want to argue, go elsewhere, please.

494
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:29,426
Sorry.

495
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:36,074
You're not even trying to understand
what this means to us, are you?

496
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,579
What's to understand about
a bunch of guys...

497
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,674
...who have to prove themselves
by beating each other up?

498
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,720
- Why are you a reporter?
- What does that have to do with it?

499
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:46,516
Just answer the question.

500
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:48,056
My father was a reporter.

501
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:50,752
I was a good writer.
It seemed the right thing to do.

502
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,754
And you want to be the best reporter
you can be, for him and yourself, right?

503
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,094
Yes, that's right.

504
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,930
I'm just trying to be the best I can be.

505
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:03,635
Not just for me,
for Tanaka, my Shidoshi, too.

506
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:06,104
Great, Frank, that's just great!

507
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,403
Go right ahead!

508
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:10,411
I just hope you don't end up like Jackson,
or worse!

509
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:12,810
But I'm not going to stand around
and watch it.

510
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,053
You're blowing it, Frank.

511
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:21,422
Forget about the girl.

512
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,986
Forget about getting back
at Chong Li for Ray.

513
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:27,028
You have a chance to take it all tomorrow.
Do you understand?

514
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:30,395
You can be the first Westerner
to win this thing.

515
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:33,435
But you got to have a clear head.
You hear me?

516
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,716
Why are you so interested
in stopping the kumite?

517
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,418
Someone almost got killed there today.

518
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,815
I have a friend fighting in it.
I don't want him to get hurt.

519
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:06,966
Who is your friend?

520
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,627
His name is...

521
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,334
...Frank Dux.

522
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,123
You guys here for the finals?

523
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:52,258
There aren't going to be any finals, Dux,
at least not for you.

524
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,393
Don't try to stop me.

525
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:57,204
We're not. He will.

526
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,444
I didn't come this far to stop now.

527
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:06,012
You shouldn't have come in the first place.

528
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:07,582
Take him.

529
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,443
You're really being a hard-ass about this.

530
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:40,607
Careful.

531
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:44,411
- Put these on and I won't have to use it.
- It's your last warning.

532
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:53,528
Inspector, no. We've got to take him back.

533
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:58,027
Just give us a break.
We've chased you all over Hong Kong.

534
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,796
- Can we stop this?
- Okay, Frank, you win.

535
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,566
But it's wrong what you're doing.
It's a mistake.

536
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:08,705
I'll meet you at the airport tomorrow.

537
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,382
Now what?

538
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,876
How are we going to stop him?

539
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,778
Follow me.

540
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:28,324
Time's up. We can't wait any longer.

541
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:31,727
Give me one more minute.
I give you my word. He'll be here.

542
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,132
We must follow the rules.

543
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:35,836
Where's Mr. Dux?

544
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:39,272
I wish everyone would calm down.
I said, he'll be here.

545
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,831
- Too late.
- Too late?

546
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:44,743
No such thing as too late.

547
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,211
Finally.

548
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,650
- It's about fucking time!
- Sorry.

549
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,484
How do you feel today, Dux?

550
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:56,684
I feel good.

551
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:58,151
I am ready.

552
01:09:58,394 --> 01:09:59,759
Dux, my man!

553
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,233
Junbi!

554
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,068
Haji!

555
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:52,644
Hajime!

556
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,264
Come on!

557
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,404
Well done.

558
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:53,398
Junbi!

559
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:55,363
Haji!

560
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,266
Hajime!

561
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,059
You are next.

562
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:34,386
Prepare the platform for the final match.

563
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,260
This is it, Frank.

564
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,629
You can make history here today.

565
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,581
You okay?

566
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:00,046
Yeah.

567
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:06,486
Junbi!

568
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:12,983
Haji!

569
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,947
You break my record, now I break you.

570
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:38,275
Like I break your friend.

571
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:52,766
Hajime!

572
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:25,129
Get him! Come on!

573
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:38,937
Get up!

574
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,508
Right on!

575
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:17,915
Come on!

576
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:56,646
More!

577
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,071
Up!

578
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:48,700
Get up, Frankie!

579
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:37,568
All right!

580
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,206
Say it!

581
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:55,016
Matte!

582
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:58,785
All right!

583
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:25,250
Mr. Dux, you fought with inspiration.

584
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:28,745
We of the Kokuryukai salute you.

585
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,400
This is for you, Shidoshi.

586
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:55,312
So you stomped him real good?

587
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,009
Worse.

588
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,780
What do you mean?

589
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:02,518
He made him say matte.

590
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:06,450
All right, Frankie!

591
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,323
Don't you get too cocky.

592
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:11,990
Because you might have to
go up against me next time.

593
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:13,761
I promise.

594
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:16,862
You guys are out of your minds!

595
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:19,573
I'll drink to that!

596
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:22,402
By the way, next time you fight...

597
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:25,144
...try to keep your clothes on.

598
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:34,545
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere...

599
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,984
...if you ever need me, I'll be there.

600
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:43,125
I love you, my friend.

601
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:49,366
Me, too.

602
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,267
Take care.

603
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:10,681
He's not going to show.

604
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,587
Looks like he did it to us again, huh?

605
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:17,291
Hey, guys!

606
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:19,460
You coming or what?

607
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:23,236
You son of a bitch.

608
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:25,570
You're always late!

609
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:33,342
You're really a pain in the ass,
you know that?

610
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:38,777
I'm just glad you're on our side, kid.
