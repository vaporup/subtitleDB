00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,313
In the end of Ching Dynasty,
Chan Mon-gut, a famous lawyer...

2
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:05,849
was a cocky,
wise and cunning brain-truster.

3
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,389
He loved to play jokes on others

4
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:08,719
and raise hob to make
himself proud and happy.

5
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:10,425
That's why he had numerous enemies.

6
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:14,223
One day, Hung Sat-fat,
the head of the Beggar's Gang,

7
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:16,262
was persuaded by his fellows

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,493
and thus came to Chan's house
to settle a score with Chan.

9
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:21,695
But why and when they've become enemies,

10
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:23,897
no one knows.

11
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,581
Give away... get your ass out of here.

12
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:38,310
Chan Mon-gut, you bastard!

13
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,888
I want to have a duel with you today!

14
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:49,729
Shit! Master,
we are in deep shit this time!

15
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:59,768
Master...

16
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:01,343
Foon, I have been waiting for you.

17
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:09,010
Honey bear, single, double,
honey bear touches the ground...

18
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:12,279
Honey bear turns around!

19
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:17,119
Honey bear, honey bear. Get away!

20
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:19,127
Master...

21
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,024
Hung Sat-fat comes to make troubles.

22
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,427
Really?

23
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:27,703
Master,
you must have though of some solutions.

24
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:28,768
Of course not!

25
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:31,473
Since you look ugly,
that's why I gave you a kick.

26
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:33,241
Don't let me see you again.

27
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:35,141
Otherwise I think I can't control myself
and will give you another kick.

28
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:38,040
Master's thought is really wide
and striking!

29
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:40,206
You're brilliant, that's why people
call you "King of brain-trusters".

30
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:42,679
Don't flatter me like this.

31
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,617
You're giving me much pressure,
old bean.

32
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:45,983
That's right...

33
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:51,923
Chan Mon-gut, come out, come out!

34
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:56,327
Come out!

35
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,066
Do you know that your God-father

36
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,735
has come for you?

37
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:01,596
Are you afraid of me?

38
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:02,966
If you don't come out,

39
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:04,904
- I'll ruin your ancestor's graves.
- Master.

40
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:06,806
And I'll smash their bones
and feed the chickens with the ashes.

41
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:09,673
Come out...

42
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,255
Boss, there are some words written
on the stone.

43
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,959
What's that shit?

44
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:26,490
"Visitors should knock the door".

45
00:04:26,897 --> 00:04:28,091
How dare he!

46
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:41,943
Chan Mon-gut, listen!

47
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:44,546
I'll count to three, if you don't raise
your hands up and surrender,

48
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:46,515
we will rush into your place.

49
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:47,945
Alright.

50
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:49,484
It doesn't seem to be a joke.

51
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:51,949
What'll we do now?

52
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,129
Master, they are setting fire
at the rear exit.

53
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:04,833
Nothing strange, we've just set fire.

54
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,834
One!

55
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,700
Shit...

56
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,178
Two!

57
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:19,714
Two and a half!

58
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:21,283
Three!

59
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,611
Don't push me,
otherwise I'll kill the hostage.

60
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:26,514
Save me... Brother Hung, save me!

61
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,116
Alright, pour the shit and urine on him.

62
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:41,096
Ghost...

63
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:43,832
What a haunted house!

64
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:46,733
They are too ignorant!
They haven't seen glass at all.

65
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:48,708
Master, you bought this piece of glass
when you visited Germany last time,

66
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,505
until now, I've just known its function!

67
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:53,479
Why do you hold your breath?
Am I stinking?

68
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:05,621
Chan Mon-gut, can't you imagine that?
God helps me too!

69
00:06:05,763 --> 00:06:07,754
The rain rinses my body!

70
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:12,868
Heavier rain please!

71
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:14,331
Brother Hung.

72
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:16,798
This way, brother Hung.

73
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:19,307
What a beggar!
He's got more brawn than brain.

74
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:22,435
Foolhardy! They just think violence
can solve everything.

75
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:25,411
See, I am giving you face
for treating you to urine only.

76
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:29,011
You want more?
I'll pour it on your face.

77
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:39,892
Boss...

78
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:41,961
No, I have just stooled.

79
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,963
I can't hold it too!

80
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,767
Help me! Don't go!

81
00:07:00,217 --> 00:07:01,809
Those bastards drank the urine
which I've added with cathartics.

82
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:03,644
They will learn a big lesson!

83
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:16,123
So poor!

84
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,036
Boss, don't you think the paper money
will bring bad luck?

85
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,102
What do you want to clean your ass with?
Paper money or fingers?

86
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:40,214
Do you feel itchy...

87
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:44,324
deep inside your anus...
that's like being bitten by insects?

88
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,494
Chan Mon-gut's got it again!

89
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:59,199
Don't panic, there's no shit on it.
But only words.

90
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:02,105
Hung Sat-fat, you bastard,

91
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:04,746
the paper money which you used
to clean your ass...

92
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:09,180
was soaked in "Poisonous Herbal Oil".

93
00:08:09,453 --> 00:08:12,650
Once you feel itchy, either you stop
yourself from tickling,

94
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:16,054
or you can never stop tickling until
your anus bleeds and breaks.

95
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,859
Why didn't your lips move

96
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:19,289
but I still heard you speaking?

97
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:21,260
However,
I don't think that's your voice.

98
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:23,456
Because that's my voice over.

99
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:25,860
How is it? Do you feel itchy?

100
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,234
Mosquitoes bit me, I feel itchy,
I can't help tickling!

101
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:35,501
Ready, one two three four.

102
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,179
It's so itchy... so itchy...

103
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,548
Come on, put some "Super Ointment"
on my wound!

104
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,778
Hey! Here comes the "Super Ointment".

105
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:48,890
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

106
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:56,529
Chan Mon-gut, I fail!

107
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:57,828
Give us the antidote.

108
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,062
Sure! To save time,

109
00:09:01,372 --> 00:09:03,363
I've asked Mr. Li to be our witness.

110
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:05,565
Greet me "God-brother", come on!

111
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:13,039
Greet him... "God...

112
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:14,809
Mr. Li is so busy but he still
comes to give me a hand,

113
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:16,179
I'm so glad!

114
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:17,681
Cause you have pretty girls for me!

115
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:19,785
Am I nice to you?

116
00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:21,151
Be quick!

117
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,317
I prefer cutting my arm
to losing me face in front of you.

118
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:28,697
What a great hero!

119
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,730
I won't let you greet me
"God-brother" either.

120
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:31,857
- Foon.
- Yes.

121
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:33,125
In order to save time,

122
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:35,704
we've prepared the antidote for you all.

123
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:43,244
Silver?

124
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,972
You can stuff it into your anus,

125
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:47,444
since your fingers can't reach it,
so you can't tickle any more.

126
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:50,677
Good! He stuffed it into his anus
without a second thought.

127
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:53,482
What a brave hero!

128
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:54,746
I love you so much.

129
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,017
- Foon!
- Yes!

130
00:09:56,226 --> 00:09:57,625
Master is kidding you.

131
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:59,320
This is for you to buy 0.2 tael
of Chuen-bei, 0.3 tael of tuckahoe,

132
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,619
four pieces of prunella,

133
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:02,163
boil with 4 bowls of water
into a teaspoonful of medicine,

134
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,391
then pour it into your anus,
it'll cure you immediately.

135
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:07,527
7 days later, you won't feel
itchy anymore, guaranteed!

136
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:10,171
And it'll soften the skin
of your ass too!

137
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,430
I give money out.

138
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:13,472
Brother Hung, please rise.

139
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:18,314
You are a respectable hero!

140
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:21,207
I don't think it's wise
for us to be enemies.

141
00:10:21,485 --> 00:10:22,679
Now, Hong Kong Island,
Kowloon and the New Territories...

142
00:10:22,886 --> 00:10:24,080
are conquered by foreigners.

143
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:27,950
Facing the national threat,
we should forget our own animosities.

144
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:31,787
We should all yourselves
to fight against foreign enemies.

145
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:33,728
Now I...

146
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:36,364
As your God-brother,
have my toast!

147
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,397
Stop dreaming!
I hate you for the rest of my life!

148
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:41,661
But I adore you anyways,
my dear God-brother! Go

149
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:44,197
Let's go!

150
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:51,544
Foon.

151
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:52,738
Yes, master.

152
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,111
Forgiveness is a good deed,
have you got it?

153
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:56,546
Yes, master.

154
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:59,078
You are too cocky to say
such thing after a victory.

155
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:00,412
I admire you so much.

156
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:01,851
Well, let's go to the club,
you'll be the boss of course.

157
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:03,081
Should I pay again?

158
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,056
I suppose you're sophisticated
enough for this.

159
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:05,820
- Of course.
- Let's go.

160
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:17,864
Mr. Chan wait, let me give you a quiz.

161
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:19,302
A black cat is black in color,
a white cat is white in color,

162
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,604
how about a panda?

163
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:22,508
It's too difficult for me.

164
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:24,546
A panda is a panda,

165
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:26,374
actually, it's not a cat.

166
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,242
Right!

167
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:29,541
Let me give you another quiz.

168
00:11:29,753 --> 00:11:32,153
There is a long word,

169
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:34,247
from the beginning to the end,
the distance is one mile.

170
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,447
What's it?

171
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:37,485
May I have some congee?

172
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:39,525
Can't you answer it?

173
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:42,197
The answer is... Smiles.

174
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:43,455
Bravo!

175
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,292
Many people thought
it's Chinese character.

176
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:48,234
Well, what a party here!

177
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,031
Why not tell us some great idea?

178
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,131
No, I just earn a living
by my sharp-tongue.

179
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:53,172
If I had any smart ideas,

180
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:55,241
I wouldn't have been sitting here.
Come on, let's eat, come on...

181
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:58,006
You are famous for tricks,
why not tell us some great ideas?

182
00:11:58,215 --> 00:11:59,807
That's right, come on!

183
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:02,212
You must have something great in mind.
Come on.

184
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:06,948
No, you are flattering me!

185
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,109
What's the matter?

186
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:39,184
People said you always
have smug calculations,

187
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:40,312
practical and mean.

188
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:43,721
You are really practical!
You won't tell if we don't pay, right?

189
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:47,262
We are rich and handsome,
everyone knows it.

190
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:48,796
You're really handsome!

191
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,299
That's right, we are so handsome,

192
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:52,867
but the restaurant we are running
is making no profit!

193
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:54,402
So we'd like you
to think something for us

194
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:55,560
to grow the business.

195
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:59,606
It's party time, why are you so serious
to talk about business?

196
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,007
You are really something!
Money harms friendship.

197
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,239
But, Mr. Chan,

198
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:06,245
friendship doesn't exist among us,

199
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:07,715
we'd better talk about money!

200
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:09,577
You are really wise,

201
00:13:09,786 --> 00:13:11,583
well... change all the girls.

202
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:15,383
The first thing to do is to have some
girls who really look like girls.

203
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,958
We've changed many times.

204
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:20,186
They are supposed to be the best,
you can see that.

205
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:21,691
Mr. Chan, you don't match the name
"Brain-truster".

206
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,823
You'd better name yourself
"Brain-duster".

207
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,162
"Brain-duster"!

208
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:28,327
Well, you are demanding.

209
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:30,097
Well...

210
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:43,377
Damn it! Business grows!

211
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,815
We have to employ more waiters to serve.

212
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:47,786
Everyone has curiosity.

213
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:49,583
You must remember.

214
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:51,623
Everyday, you'd keep jumping down
on time, three shifts a day.

215
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:53,625
To draw the attention of the customers,

216
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:56,689
then money will come.

217
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,492
But it's too dangerous to jump down
from the 3rd floor.

218
00:13:58,769 --> 00:13:59,758
In order to make a living,

219
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:01,095
you'd do it even you are asked to jump
from the 7th floor.

220
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:02,294
That's right.

221
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:03,600
Send money to my home.

222
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:04,603
Sure.

223
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,035
Foon...

224
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,407
Let's go!

225
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,319
Good job!

226
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,688
Do you want to betray me? Why didn't you
ask me to take a look?

227
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:24,258
This one is so cute!

228
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:25,324
Thank you.

229
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:26,928
Cute...

230
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:30,929
Master, she gave me a smile.

231
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:32,500
You're wrong, she gave me a smile!

232
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:34,202
No! Master, she smiled to me.

233
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:38,773
One two three, guess what's next...

234
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,467
Did you touch my ass?

235
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,270
Open!

236
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,276
Ten!

237
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:45,210
Your...

238
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:46,576
Did you touch my ass?

239
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:47,613
Drink!

240
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:49,681
I, Chan Mon-gut, swear that
I haven't done that shameless thing.

241
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:50,444
- Let's go!
- Right!

242
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:51,743
Stop!

243
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:53,752
Miss, you should have evidence
to accuse someone.

244
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:55,721
If you don't have any evidence,
better mind your tongue.

245
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:57,120
Let's go!

246
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:59,086
Master, in order to let her feel better,

247
00:14:59,162 --> 00:14:59,958
let me admit the accusation.

248
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:03,062
I'll let you touch my ass
as compensation, agree?

249
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,732
What a benefit to you!

250
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,800
What a creep!

251
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:09,370
Fong Tong-ken?

252
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,837
Chan Mon-gut, you two are civilized men!

253
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,102
How dare you bully
a helpless girl like this?

254
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,339
You took her advantage,

255
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:21,745
and you insult her by playing
such dirty guessing game.

256
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:25,580
Tell me, where is righteousness?

257
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:26,518
Bastard!

258
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:28,415
I won when I played mahjong
with him last time,

259
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:31,922
he takes that as an insult
and always wants to take revenge.

260
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:33,461
That's him!

261
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,129
Miss, may I know your name?

262
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:36,891
Called Lotus Shui.

263
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:41,167
I, Fong tong-ken, will fight for justice
and teach the creeps a lesson.

264
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:42,963
Pal, let's take a seat and...

265
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:45,197
Cut the crap, take Lysee out.

266
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:48,173
Lysee, the quixotic dog!?

267
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:53,347
That's right,
it's been terribly trained.

268
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,347
By just one hair of the suspect,

269
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:56,679
no matter where the criminal goes,

270
00:15:56,787 --> 00:16:00,188
it will find him out and bite him.

271
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:03,684
Now, I'll show you a demonstration.

272
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:09,954
Attack!

273
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:19,905
Miss Shui, don't worry,
let it smell your ass.

274
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:21,838
Stay calm.

275
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:25,043
Master,

276
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:26,376
if there is anything wrong,
I'll gather our fellows for a fight.

277
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,539
Just delay them as long as you can.

278
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:28,740
I won't give it a damn!

279
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:30,847
Come on.

280
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:32,877
Attack!

281
00:16:39,863 --> 00:16:41,854
Good dog...

282
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:43,996
Oh, it likes eating buns!

283
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:52,831
Shit!

284
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:09,590
Oh, the thief is crying
for catching thief!

285
00:17:09,793 --> 00:17:12,990
It's Fong who touched Miss Shiu's ass!

286
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,922
Now, the truth is found!

287
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,391
He can't imagine that the dog
which is trained by him...

288
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:20,863
will betray him because

289
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:23,404
of my righteousness and its conscience!

290
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:25,564
It turns to charge against its master!

291
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:28,834
What a righteous dog!

292
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,842
Let's clap for it.

293
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:34,478
Lysee is a good dog.

294
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:37,416
Lysee is a good dog!

295
00:17:37,654 --> 00:17:44,651
We've found a good dog
named Lysee in China.

296
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:46,986
Miss, do you want to talk to me?

297
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:48,756
I'm sorry to make a mistake.

298
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,762
I am so ignorant that,

299
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,366
I was almost cheated by that bastard.

300
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:54,593
By the way, you owe me something, huh?

301
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:58,070
I wish to have chance to pay for it.

302
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:00,608
This is my student Foon.

303
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:01,866
Brother Foon.

304
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:03,239
He likes you so much.

305
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:05,005
Master, you are disgusting!

306
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:06,981
But you need not fall for him.

307
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,551
Well, 3 p.m. tomorrow,
come to my home on time.

308
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,915
Let's discuss what you'd pay for it.

309
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,555
What do you think?

310
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:15,918
I'll be there on time.

311
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,353
Let's go!

312
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:18,416
Let's go!

313
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:40,414
Master, we've found it.

314
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:46,351
Daddy, we've found it.

315
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:47,419
God,

316
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:51,125
hope you would bless Yu-fa and Nim-sai,

317
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:53,285
make them live happily in heaven,
thank God!

318
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:56,891
Sir, beware of catching cold,
let us handle it.

319
00:18:57,067 --> 00:19:00,264
Chung, open the coffin
and check the body.

320
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,007
How is the body?

321
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:10,838
We still can see his face.

322
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:14,515
Turn the body upside down
and remove his trousers.

323
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:20,778
What did you see?

324
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:22,046
His ass.

325
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:23,055
Anything on his ass?

326
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:25,488
A triangular stain.

327
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,027
It's birthmark.

328
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:33,564
Right, he is your brother Nim-sai.

329
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:54,789
Actually, Nim-sai was sold to Canton
by you for over 20 years.

330
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:57,652
If he is still alive,
can you recognize him?

331
00:19:57,794 --> 00:19:59,989
You know, when one is happy,
his has one look.

332
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:01,855
And when he is sad,
he has another look.

333
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:04,626
I can't guarantee
the change of his look.

334
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:12,564
Do you remember anything special
about Nim-sai?

335
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:16,006
He has had a very beautiful
jade round his neck.

336
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,679
There is a little door on it,

337
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,807
behind the door, the name "Sai"
of Sir Ho Sai is carved on it.

338
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,249
Master, what are you doing?

339
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:32,755
Wait.

340
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:39,328
Master, what are you doing here?

341
00:20:39,603 --> 00:20:40,592
Wait.

342
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:49,434
Master.

343
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:50,807
You are lucky!

344
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:51,777
What's the matter?

345
00:20:52,015 --> 00:20:53,414
Are you willing to kiss Lotus?

346
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:54,915
Master, are you kidding me?
Will I be that lucky?

347
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:56,140
It's true!

348
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:58,045
When Lotus arrives,

349
00:20:58,288 --> 00:20:59,687
I'll ask Yan to let her
sit on this chair.

350
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:01,780
Then Yan will get the tea
by leaps and bounds.

351
00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:02,788
Isn't it great?

352
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,358
That's great!

353
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:05,926
Am I smart?

354
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:08,820
Master, how to kiss her?

355
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:10,259
Take a seat.

356
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:18,697
When she is all wet, what's next?

357
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:20,500
She will be very ugly
and she will scream!

358
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:21,766
No, no!

359
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:23,411
She will get changed!

360
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,440
Master,
how can she get changed in public?

361
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:27,910
Look!

362
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:31,644
This door will lock up
automatically when it's closed.

363
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,385
At the same time, water will flush
out from this hole.

364
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,255
According to human beings' instinct,
Lotus will...

365
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,724
Stuff it with her finger.

366
00:21:41,898 --> 00:21:44,890
At the same time, another water-column
comes from that side.

367
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:46,998
She will stuff with another finger.

368
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:48,803
But she can't imagine that...

369
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:50,564
another water-column aims...

370
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:53,002
at her face!

371
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:55,737
Master, do you mean it?

372
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:59,574
Lotus is so poor then.

373
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,875
She can't seek for any help!

374
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:05,647
She must be scared
and doesn't know what to do.

375
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:10,258
In order to stop the water,
everyone knows she will...

376
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:12,891
stuff the hole with her tongue.

377
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:16,094
That's right, you stand
in front of the changing room.

378
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:17,426
When it's the right time,
remove the hose,

379
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:18,656
move forward and kiss.

380
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:20,062
So I can kiss her.

381
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:21,702
Smug calculation!

382
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:24,399
When you hear the bell ringing,
go ahead and kiss her.

383
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:25,768
What's the use of kissing her?

384
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:28,442
Are you fooling me, Brother Foon?

385
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:32,204
Master, if she bites me,
what'll I do then?

386
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:33,609
If you switch her on by your tongue,

387
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:35,011
she won't bite you, right?

388
00:22:35,285 --> 00:22:36,684
Master, you are so nice to me.

389
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,617
I am so nice to you, right?

390
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:39,882
Yes.

391
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,319
- Brother Yan.
- Master.

392
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,152
Come here...

393
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:47,319
Ask her to stay in this room
and don't leave.

394
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,931
Later, water will come through this hole
and aim at your face.

395
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,865
Stuff this pig's tongue into this hole.

396
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,159
Understand?

397
00:22:55,305 --> 00:22:55,896
Yes.

398
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:57,538
Repeat once please.

399
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:00,307
Damn it! Later, a water-column
will flush in through this hole.

400
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,204
When you are damn wet,

401
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,879
you stuff this damn pig's tongue into...

402
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:07,276
this bloody hole.

403
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:09,009
You should have said in this way.

404
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:10,241
What a creep!

405
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:26,865
Let me have a second thought.

406
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,962
When Foon is kissing the pig's tongue
which Yan's holding.

407
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,131
I'll be here to kiss Lotus.

408
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,569
If she accused us,

409
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:36,143
Foon will admit all the blames!

410
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:37,175
Lotus will slap Foon severely,

411
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,574
again and again

412
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:40,114
and I'll go forward
and kick him severely too.

413
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,849
Lotus will lean on my chest,

414
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:43,815
and I'll comfort her.

415
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,918
I'll make her drunk,

416
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,285
then I will...

417
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:00,329
Who else can be the
King of Brain-truster

418
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,664
in this world except me?

419
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:03,397
No one else!

420
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,207
Why are you carrying luggage? Moving?

421
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,071
No, madam is back.

422
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:12,906
Madam?

423
00:24:13,116 --> 00:24:15,311
Yes, she's going to the sitting room
with her friend.

424
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,319
What a big house, but...

425
00:24:18,788 --> 00:24:20,380
One chair only?

426
00:24:20,557 --> 00:24:22,752
You are my guest, you take the seat.

427
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:30,598
Shit!

428
00:24:39,876 --> 00:24:41,275
Sorry, you'd better get changed first.

429
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:44,140
No!

430
00:24:44,414 --> 00:24:45,608
Hubby.

431
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:47,545
Not you! I mean the one
with protruding teeth!

432
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,814
This room...

433
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:52,784
No problem, you are in urgent need.

434
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:54,283
You first!

435
00:24:55,725 --> 00:24:57,124
Shit!

436
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:01,355
Help! Help...

437
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,894
Shit...

438
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:08,663
Help!

439
00:25:27,924 --> 00:25:30,722
Help!

440
00:25:34,564 --> 00:25:43,563
Help!

441
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:13,959
Someone is killed! It's shit!

442
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,967
Master, we are in trouble...

443
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:18,130
It's shit...

444
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:19,869
Madam!

445
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:21,032
Foon!

446
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:23,003
No one is killed! Everything is fine.

447
00:26:24,647 --> 00:26:26,842
Miss Shiu,
I'll return your tongue to you.

448
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:28,913
I am sorry, I don't mean it...

449
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:30,584
Sorry, I am late.

450
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:34,646
Ghost!

451
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:36,790
Ghost!

452
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:40,525
Hey! What's going on?

453
00:26:40,663 --> 00:26:41,857
It's a mess.

454
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:43,893
I can't manage to explain.

455
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:52,939
Help...

456
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:00,178
Wu Man.

457
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,246
How is it, hubby?

458
00:27:01,484 --> 00:27:03,076
I sent you to UK to study law,

459
00:27:03,252 --> 00:27:06,050
why do you come back suddenly?

460
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:07,621
I wish to give you a surprise.

461
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,881
It's really a surprise.

462
00:27:10,293 --> 00:27:11,089
Let's eat.

463
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:12,588
By the way,

464
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:15,527
why were you flushed out
of the room by water?

465
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:18,399
And I see traps all over the house.

466
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,000
Do you have time

467
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:22,763
to tell something about it?

468
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:25,897
I have time, but it's not convenient
to talk right now.

469
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,307
Madam, don't mistake it.

470
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:30,208
Master knows that

471
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:31,435
I have an indecent and brutal desire.

472
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:33,113
So he arranged all the traps,

473
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:36,817
to let me have chance to kiss Miss Shiu.

474
00:27:37,086 --> 00:27:38,678
Don't misunderstand him.

475
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:40,721
But, master...

476
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:42,821
About the pig's tongue,

477
00:27:43,126 --> 00:27:45,617
isn't it convenient
to give me an explanation?

478
00:27:45,695 --> 00:27:47,686
Sure, but I don't have time.

479
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,626
That's good,

480
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:50,922
even you have time to talk,
we don't have time to listen.

481
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:55,433
Foon, you kissed the pig's tongue,
didn't you?

482
00:27:55,671 --> 00:27:56,865
I did.

483
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,539
Right, I bought that specially for you.

484
00:27:58,708 --> 00:27:59,504
Master,

485
00:27:59,776 --> 00:28:01,971
you promised to let me kiss Miss Shiu.

486
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:03,305
In fact, it's me who wanted to kiss her.

487
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:04,945
And the pig's tongue is for you only.

488
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:09,479
I wanted to fool you!
I want to take your advantage,

489
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:11,018
so what?

490
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:12,746
I won't give it
a damn to tell you the truth.

491
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:14,083
It's hot, and life is boring,

492
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:16,917
I just want to have fun,
isn't it alright?

493
00:28:18,027 --> 00:28:18,823
That's alright!

494
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:20,959
Well, it's OK then.

495
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:23,597
Why do you stare at me?

496
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:24,755
Because of our friendship,

497
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:26,333
I'll let you kiss something anyways.

498
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:27,558
You'd better ask her.

499
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:28,998
Excuse me.

500
00:28:29,572 --> 00:28:31,369
Chan Mon-gut, you are a married man,

501
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:33,404
why do you still date me for dinner?

502
00:28:33,676 --> 00:28:35,075
You'll make me misunderstand something.

503
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:37,175
Haven't you thought of my feeling?

504
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:39,244
A smart guy isn't a big shot.

505
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:41,982
Miss Shiu.

506
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:43,879
Very simple!

507
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,018
She secretly admires him.

508
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:45,917
He fooled him.

509
00:28:46,122 --> 00:28:46,918
He wants to kiss her.

510
00:28:47,156 --> 00:28:48,953
You are mad at him.

511
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:51,316
I wanna beat you, you know?

512
00:28:56,132 --> 00:28:57,121
Siu-tso!

513
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:58,355
Lend it to me.

514
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:04,439
Miss Shui... Please wait!

515
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,935
Miss Shui, it's dark outside,
let me show you the way home.

516
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,609
No, you'd better lend me the lantern.

517
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:09,767
I'll return it next time.

518
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,877
Next time? That means
I'll have chance to see you again!

519
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:15,311
If it's not necessary to return it,
I prefer keeping it.

520
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:16,984
I can't be his woman,

521
00:29:17,186 --> 00:29:18,585
I can't win his heart,

522
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:21,653
now, I love to keep it for memory.

523
00:29:22,658 --> 00:29:26,253
Miss Shui, why do you like my master?

524
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:30,660
All women want to find a husband
who is capable,

525
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:32,459
a man who can protect her.

526
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:35,865
Miss Shui, if there is a man,

527
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:38,870
who is a bit stronger than you,
but he can protect you,

528
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:42,100
will you consider him?

529
00:29:42,612 --> 00:29:44,204
People always look for the best,

530
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:45,746
if I can't find a good husband,

531
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:47,839
I prefer not marrying anyone else.

532
00:29:51,888 --> 00:29:55,688
What a decent woman!

533
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:57,224
Bravo!

534
00:29:57,493 --> 00:29:59,484
Foon, a man should achieve something
in his life.

535
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:01,995
You'd better forget loving affair,

536
00:30:02,064 --> 00:30:04,862
the world will be your oyster,
you'd fight for your future.

537
00:30:12,742 --> 00:30:19,341
Where should I go to fight
for my future?

538
00:30:22,118 --> 00:30:23,517
Isn't it all the go?

539
00:30:25,655 --> 00:30:26,644
Yeah...

540
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:28,355
Really?

541
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:30,915
Let me take a look!

542
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:37,526
Isn't it popular in Britain now?

543
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:38,927
What?

544
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:40,827
See!

545
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:42,026
What do you mean?

546
00:30:42,271 --> 00:30:43,067
Look at me!

547
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:44,533
Look at my look!

548
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:47,207
Oh! Look!

549
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:49,367
You speak fluent English.

550
00:30:49,612 --> 00:30:53,207
It's wise of me to let you study
in Britain.

551
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:56,883
I'm right to bring this present to you.

552
00:30:57,053 --> 00:30:58,850
See! You look really smart.

553
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:00,182
Even a deaf guy can hear that...

554
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:02,186
you spoke whole-heartedly.

555
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:04,050
You can read my mind!

556
00:31:04,193 --> 00:31:05,990
You really understand me.

557
00:31:06,295 --> 00:31:08,695
You talk in such a romantic way!

558
00:31:11,234 --> 00:31:12,633
It's late, let's go to bed.

559
00:31:12,935 --> 00:31:14,129
That's good.

560
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,366
You first.

561
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:16,162
You first...

562
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,030
No, you first...

563
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:18,102
Come on!

564
00:31:18,274 --> 00:31:19,468
No, I mean, I dare not,
I really dare not.

565
00:31:19,675 --> 00:31:22,075
Come on, just give me some face.

566
00:31:22,245 --> 00:31:23,837
No, I...

567
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,275
Alright, I'll listen to you.

568
00:31:34,557 --> 00:31:36,149
I think my husband
doesn't like me any more.

569
00:31:36,425 --> 00:31:39,019
We have married for 7 years,
and I went to Britain for one year.

570
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:41,595
He didn't look at my eyes
when he talked to me.

571
00:31:43,065 --> 00:31:45,863
I can't help, so I didn't look at
his eyes when I talked to him too.

572
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:50,695
Foon, he sent me to university
and wanted me to study law,

573
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,035
actually, I studied something else.

574
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:54,708
What's that?

575
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:56,674
Fashion design.

576
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,872
What kind of subject is it?

577
00:31:59,248 --> 00:32:00,647
Needlework.

578
00:32:02,018 --> 00:32:04,009
Woo! What a wonderful world.

579
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:05,347
The world has changed a lot!

580
00:32:05,521 --> 00:32:07,318
Even needlework can be a subject
in the university!

581
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:10,251
So you should go out to see the world.

582
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:14,389
You've rung my bell!

583
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,230
A man should fight for his future!

584
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:19,163
I think I should go somewhere!
Maybe the nearest city, Hong Kong.

585
00:32:19,402 --> 00:32:20,994
Are you going to Hong Kong?

586
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:22,202
Yes, Master.

587
00:32:22,471 --> 00:32:24,666
But it's no longer a Chinese's place.

588
00:32:24,874 --> 00:32:26,273
It's a British colony now!

589
00:32:26,442 --> 00:32:28,637
I don't care!
I won't let anyone bully me.

590
00:32:28,744 --> 00:32:29,938
Alright.

591
00:32:30,112 --> 00:32:31,101
Leave me alone!

592
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,575
The salary which you haven't paid me,
if it's convenient...

593
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:35,048
- ...may I get it back?
- What did you say?

594
00:32:35,484 --> 00:32:37,281
The salary which you...

595
00:32:37,486 --> 00:32:38,680
The previous line.

596
00:32:38,921 --> 00:32:40,320
No.

597
00:32:40,823 --> 00:32:43,223
You told me to leave you alone,
didn't you?

598
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:46,618
Good! Very good!

599
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:48,295
It's what you said!

600
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:04,470
Master, you love chicken's kidney's
very much. Eat more.

601
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:07,338
More rice.

602
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,444
Let me do it...

603
00:33:13,422 --> 00:33:14,616
Master, your rice.

604
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:17,483
Don't you know I am on diet?

605
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,330
I want half rice!

606
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:25,258
Let me do it...

607
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:30,266
Bastard, what a useless guy!

608
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:34,431
Half!

609
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:36,872
Look, half bowl of rice which you want!

610
00:33:37,046 --> 00:33:38,843
Eat it!

611
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:40,309
You do this in my place,

612
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:43,680
you are not giving me face, are you?

613
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:45,218
You said you would leave me alone.

614
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:47,982
You lost, Chan Mon-gut!

615
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:50,619
Peace! Peace!

616
00:33:50,826 --> 00:33:51,417
Shut up!

617
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,685
It's my place, you have no say here!

618
00:33:56,232 --> 00:33:57,631
Now, I swear in front of the lights!

619
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,094
I will never care about Ho Foon.

620
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:01,735
If I don't keep my words,
I'll be punished by law.

621
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:05,031
Don't you care about me any more?

622
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:07,305
You mean it?

623
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:09,635
You are selfish!

624
00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:13,838
You are merciless!

625
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,817
You are impotent!

626
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:18,041
Bastard! You bastard!

627
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,209
You really mean it?

628
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:20,682
Bastard!

629
00:34:20,756 --> 00:34:22,155
How dare you cheat my money?

630
00:34:30,032 --> 00:34:32,432
Brother Foon, hide up first.

631
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:34,000
Hide up?

632
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,867
Yan, take care.

633
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:42,703
I am not impotent...

634
00:34:42,945 --> 00:34:44,537
I am not!

635
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:47,247
Hubby, what's wrong with you?

636
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:50,750
It's only a dream.

637
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,117
Foon said that I am merciless
and selfish.

638
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:54,754
Is that true?

639
00:35:00,763 --> 00:35:03,561
I feel lonely, how to say in English?

640
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:08,561
I love you.

641
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:11,429
I love you.

642
00:35:11,707 --> 00:35:13,299
Really?

643
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,008
I love you!

644
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:24,275
I love you!!

645
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:30,684
I love you!!!

646
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:37,996
I love you!!!!

647
00:35:47,276 --> 00:35:48,675
It's late, why do you come?

648
00:35:48,944 --> 00:35:52,141
Miss Shui, Chan Mon-gut is a real creep.

649
00:35:52,314 --> 00:35:53,906
I've followed him for decades,
he treats me badly too.

650
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,277
Don't you think
he will be nice to you instead?

651
00:35:55,518 --> 00:35:56,917
Any other thing else?

652
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,518
Miss Shui...

653
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:00,082
You are old enough to get married.

654
00:36:00,189 --> 00:36:01,588
Take this piece of jade. Come on.

655
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,884
Go in and get some clothes.

656
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,922
Follow me to Hong Kong, will you?

657
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:09,195
You...

658
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:10,764
No?

659
00:36:13,903 --> 00:36:17,304
It's a long road to Hong Kong,
take this piece of jade with you.

660
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:19,464
If you meet the bandits,
you still have something valuable,

661
00:36:19,642 --> 00:36:20,836
thus they won't kill you.

662
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:23,841
It's late, better go now.

663
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:28,214
Take care.

664
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:51,066
Master.

665
00:37:01,684 --> 00:37:03,083
Where is the guy
who sold this piece of jade?

666
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:15,584
None of my business,
I don't know shooting.

667
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:27,233
I didn't kill! I didn't kill...

668
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:28,835
- I didn't kill!
- Go!

669
00:38:28,971 --> 00:38:30,165
I am innocent!

670
00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:31,871
Go in.

671
00:38:37,846 --> 00:38:38,835
Foreigner?

672
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:40,413
You murderer!

673
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:42,182
Uncle, what did he scold me?

674
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:43,943
No...

675
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:45,618
Help!

676
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:50,852
Are you going to torture me?

677
00:38:57,733 --> 00:38:58,927
Oh my dick!

678
00:39:20,422 --> 00:39:21,616
Now, you are charged with murdering.

679
00:39:21,757 --> 00:39:23,156
You can employ your own lawyer
to defend for you.

680
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:24,950
Do you have any lawyer?

681
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:27,794
Yes!

682
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:29,760
Chan Mon-gut!

683
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:44,010
Shit!

684
00:39:48,984 --> 00:39:50,576
Mister, are you ready?

685
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,512
I've found Master.

686
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:55,155
Good! Let's go.

687
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,197
After the shaving, no hair will be left.

688
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:09,233
You can't regret, Mister,

689
00:40:24,253 --> 00:40:25,049
do you want a second thought?

690
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,209
Come on.

691
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,166
Stop!

692
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:43,200
Fleas are living in my armpit,

693
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:44,427
why do you stop me?

694
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:46,470
May I have a little bit freedom?

695
00:40:46,742 --> 00:40:48,334
Mister, do you want to go on?

696
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,909
Yes, please.

697
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:51,411
Foon is being charged
with homicide in Hong Kong.

698
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:52,238
What?

699
00:40:52,347 --> 00:40:53,143
Yes.

700
00:40:53,215 --> 00:40:53,806
Hey!

701
00:40:54,082 --> 00:40:56,073
What?

702
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:57,717
Are you going to save him?

703
00:40:57,953 --> 00:40:58,749
How?

704
00:40:58,987 --> 00:41:00,386
If you don't, he will die.

705
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:02,684
People will die sooner or later!

706
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:04,450
You are smart and wise!

707
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,949
I can't help...

708
00:41:06,195 --> 00:41:08,595
He committed crime in HK
which is governed by British law.

709
00:41:08,764 --> 00:41:09,958
I can't help.

710
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:11,991
You sent me to study law in Britain.

711
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:15,464
Maybe, perhaps, I think I can
give him a... little help.

712
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:17,468
I can hear fear from your voice.

713
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:23,977
I am no match for you.

714
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:33,617
I think, I have to help you!

715
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:54,505
Master...

716
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:01,443
It's meal time.

717
00:42:02,184 --> 00:42:03,981
It's meal time...

718
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:10,583
Where can I get my food, mister?

719
00:42:13,996 --> 00:42:14,587
Are you new?

720
00:42:14,897 --> 00:42:16,091
Right...

721
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,249
Time for Playing games.

722
00:43:14,323 --> 00:43:16,723
Don't bully me!
My master is really something.

723
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:18,555
About the case of Ho Foon,

724
00:43:18,827 --> 00:43:20,226
the British and Chinese governments
have reached an agreement.

725
00:43:20,495 --> 00:43:22,087
The case will be judged
in the British court.

726
00:43:22,364 --> 00:43:24,764
No appeal.

727
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,595
And, Chan Mon-gut will be the defence
counsel for Ho Foon.

728
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,362
I've been informed already.

729
00:43:30,472 --> 00:43:32,269
And, His Excellency Li Hung-chang said,

730
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:35,339
if you can free Ho Foon from charges,
you'll become a hero.

731
00:43:35,544 --> 00:43:38,536
Money and fame
will come sooner or later.

732
00:43:39,047 --> 00:43:40,446
Congratulations.

733
00:43:42,784 --> 00:43:45,582
If I lose,
I don't think I will have any lose.

734
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:47,320
It's an insult to the country.

735
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:52,085
You will be punished, maybe capital
punishment for your tribes.

736
00:43:52,494 --> 00:43:54,291
You are throwing me to the sharks!

737
00:43:54,529 --> 00:43:55,723
Come on, don't get mad.

738
00:43:55,897 --> 00:43:57,489
The chairs are not enough for all of us,
you know?

739
00:44:28,997 --> 00:44:30,396
What's wrong with it?

740
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,497
What's wrong?

741
00:44:36,371 --> 00:44:37,565
Where did you cut it?

742
00:44:38,974 --> 00:44:41,966
Number nine, Nathan Road.

743
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:43,805
You know,

744
00:44:44,046 --> 00:44:45,638
you should not follow the trend
to cut your hair like this!

745
00:44:45,914 --> 00:44:47,313
Different people
should have different hair styles.

746
00:44:47,649 --> 00:44:49,446
See, your hair doesn't match your face.

747
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:51,243
And your face doesn't match your body.

748
00:44:51,486 --> 00:44:53,283
Your body doesn't match your hair.

749
00:44:53,455 --> 00:44:56,253
Completely ugly!

750
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:58,891
What the hell do you want?

751
00:44:59,394 --> 00:45:03,387
Master, I know it's my fault,
please don't blame me.

752
00:45:03,732 --> 00:45:06,724
I regret to cut my hair.

753
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:08,627
Sit down first.

754
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:11,068
Tell me the whole story.

755
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:13,963
Alright.

756
00:45:14,342 --> 00:45:16,936
Oh that day, I wandered off alone
on the Nathan Road.

757
00:45:17,012 --> 00:45:19,412
When I reached number 9, Nathan Road,
a fat woman waved to me.

758
00:45:19,648 --> 00:45:22,640
She said, "Come to have your hair cut,
it costs 5 cents only!"

759
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:24,217
That's why I followed her.

760
00:45:24,352 --> 00:45:25,148
I always told you,

761
00:45:25,353 --> 00:45:26,149
cheap things are no good!

762
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:27,615
You know your mistake now?

763
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:30,223
Let's go back to the case, alright?

764
00:45:33,428 --> 00:45:36,022
On that day, I went to the HK Club
for the lion dance as usual.

765
00:45:36,164 --> 00:45:37,153
After the performance,
I went back to the back stage.

766
00:45:37,332 --> 00:45:38,526
Suddenly someone covered my head
with a rice bag,

767
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,496
he pushed me on the wall,

768
00:45:39,668 --> 00:45:40,862
when I struggled with him...

769
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:41,958
Suddenly,

770
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:44,504
someone took off my pants...

771
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:45,833
Did he...

772
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:47,335
Yes!

773
00:45:47,476 --> 00:45:48,272
What did you feel? Painful?

774
00:45:48,443 --> 00:45:49,034
No.

775
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:49,835
Funny?

776
00:45:50,112 --> 00:45:50,703
No!

777
00:45:50,946 --> 00:45:52,538
My ass was seen,

778
00:45:52,747 --> 00:45:54,339
and I felt a bit cool.

779
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:56,280
What's next?

780
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:57,950
Then, I struggled...

781
00:45:58,186 --> 00:46:00,984
I removed the bag and saw him pointing
at me with a gun.

782
00:46:03,592 --> 00:46:04,991
What do you want? You sex maniac!

783
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,989
What do you want?

784
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:15,829
You seduced my wife
and you wanted to accuse first?

785
00:46:17,305 --> 00:46:19,500
Don't kill me...

786
00:46:19,608 --> 00:46:21,599
None of my business,
I don't know how to shoot!

787
00:46:24,012 --> 00:46:25,001
That's right,

788
00:46:25,147 --> 00:46:27,547
it means,
someone killed Ho Chun in the dark.

789
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:29,308
Then, Ho Foon became the scapegoat.

790
00:46:29,518 --> 00:46:31,509
The key point is, did you have any
secret affair with Chun's wife?

791
00:46:31,753 --> 00:46:34,347
Master, I haven't seen his wife at all.

792
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:36,286
How could I have secret affair with her?

793
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:37,547
Ho Chun lied.

794
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:39,384
But why was he killed?

795
00:46:39,594 --> 00:46:41,789
It's alright, the key point is...

796
00:46:41,897 --> 00:46:43,296
your ass.

797
00:46:49,804 --> 00:46:51,601
What is this triangular mark?

798
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:52,762
A birthmark.

799
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:54,100
Birthmark?

800
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:56,106
See! Some acnes are found.

801
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:58,108
Not serious, Madam.

802
00:46:58,914 --> 00:46:59,903
You've dropped something!

803
00:47:01,116 --> 00:47:02,708
It's a domino!

804
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:04,648
Can you explain it to me?

805
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:06,252
Master, this is a kind of custom
in the prison.

806
00:47:06,354 --> 00:47:07,548
In this prison,

807
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:09,188
the new comers should serve the Indians

808
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:11,382
and the foreigners.

809
00:47:11,526 --> 00:47:13,118
That is to store gambling tools
inside the anus.

810
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:15,695
Master, would you help me to stuff back?

811
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:19,098
Since you have to stuff it,

812
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:22,766
I've brought you a chicken leg,

813
00:47:23,104 --> 00:47:24,503
better store it too.

814
00:47:24,606 --> 00:47:27,006
If you feel hungry,
you can take it out and eat.

815
00:47:27,175 --> 00:47:28,369
That's a good idea! Master.

816
00:47:30,478 --> 00:47:31,672
Come on.

817
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:34,672
Good! Thank you, master.

818
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:38,075
Come on, don't mention it.

819
00:47:39,554 --> 00:47:41,749
Shit, I've stuffed my ring too.

820
00:47:41,923 --> 00:47:45,324
Foon, can you get my ring back for me?

821
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:47,119
Sure, master.

822
00:47:49,464 --> 00:47:52,262
This is chicken leg,
my ring is still inside.

823
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:53,656
Not this one?

824
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:54,857
Oh, it's full!

825
00:47:55,136 --> 00:47:57,730
Master, would you mind
looking for it yourself?

826
00:47:58,039 --> 00:47:59,028
Alright.

827
00:48:12,821 --> 00:48:14,220
He's taking my bag!

828
00:48:19,527 --> 00:48:21,324
As it's stipulated by court,

829
00:48:21,496 --> 00:48:24,294
although it's not his wish
to be baptized,

830
00:48:24,432 --> 00:48:27,026
we still welcome him
to join God's family.

831
00:49:28,296 --> 00:49:29,285
Let him go.

832
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,769
Why a woman's baptismal time
is so short...

833
00:49:37,005 --> 00:49:39,405
But a man's baptismal time is so long?

834
00:49:40,608 --> 00:49:43,406
Why did you fight? Your nose bleeds!

835
00:49:43,611 --> 00:49:45,203
I didn't beat him.

836
00:49:45,714 --> 00:49:47,113
None of his business!

837
00:49:47,215 --> 00:49:48,409
Look!

838
00:49:53,288 --> 00:49:56,086
I hate blonde!

839
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:01,956
I think it's acceptable!

840
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:22,641
Damn you!

841
00:50:24,419 --> 00:50:25,818
Put all the dominos back.

842
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:31,087
As well as my mahjong too.

843
00:50:31,259 --> 00:50:33,250
And the chair and table, all set!

844
00:50:34,496 --> 00:50:35,690
What?

845
00:50:38,967 --> 00:50:40,161
Thank you, brother Hung.

846
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:41,829
Don't mention it.

847
00:50:42,003 --> 00:50:42,992
As told by Chan Mon-gut,

848
00:50:43,171 --> 00:50:44,968
I will take good care of you.

849
00:50:45,106 --> 00:50:46,300
Beat him severely!

850
00:51:23,878 --> 00:51:25,072
Court.

851
00:51:43,064 --> 00:51:44,861
My master is really great.

852
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,798
My master is really great.

853
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,332
Please ask the candidates for the jury
to come for the election.

854
00:51:55,643 --> 00:51:58,840
Mr. Cheung Ti-sung, you are handicapped,

855
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:02,448
I would like to dispense you
from serving the jury.

856
00:52:02,851 --> 00:52:04,045
Objection!

857
00:52:04,285 --> 00:52:05,274
Why do you object?

858
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,512
It's against the spirit of law
for despising handicapped people.

859
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,191
Although I am blind,

860
00:52:12,393 --> 00:52:16,386
I am always a righteous and fair person.

861
00:52:16,598 --> 00:52:18,395
My wish is to become a jury member.

862
00:52:18,733 --> 00:52:21,133
If you don't let me join the jury,
I'll complain against you.

863
00:52:21,436 --> 00:52:23,427
Alright, I'll let you do it.

864
00:52:23,671 --> 00:52:24,660
Thank you.

865
00:52:32,113 --> 00:52:33,102
We have jury and judge here,

866
00:52:33,314 --> 00:52:35,305
actually,
who will be in-charge of the court?

867
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:36,472
Yup.

868
00:52:38,186 --> 00:52:40,177
So, do you think that is an answer?

869
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:41,820
Well.

870
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:43,284
Prosecutor.

871
00:52:43,525 --> 00:52:44,924
Jury.

872
00:52:45,927 --> 00:52:48,122
In the coming few days,

873
00:52:48,263 --> 00:52:51,255
I'll disclose the most ugly face
of human beings in front of you.

874
00:52:51,766 --> 00:52:54,564
This is a terrifying

875
00:52:54,702 --> 00:52:57,296
and shameless homicide.

876
00:52:59,073 --> 00:53:03,271
The accused Ho Foon had secret affair
with the victim's wife Yuk.

877
00:53:03,511 --> 00:53:05,308
He seduced the victim's wife,

878
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:08,345
and he was well-planned
to possess Yuk too.

879
00:53:08,516 --> 00:53:10,507
He asked Ho Chun to meet him
and then killed him.

880
00:53:10,718 --> 00:53:12,310
Yuk has been disappeared.

881
00:53:12,453 --> 00:53:15,854
We have reasons to believe
that she was killed by Foon too.

882
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,285
We believe that our almighty God...

883
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,959
Cause his justice.

884
00:53:20,094 --> 00:53:21,288
This is a court,

885
00:53:21,462 --> 00:53:24,659
as well as a place God shows justice!

886
00:53:27,235 --> 00:53:28,827
He is really something.

887
00:53:31,472 --> 00:53:32,666
Defence counsel.

888
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:37,107
Your Honour,
may I ask the jury few questions?

889
00:53:37,312 --> 00:53:38,506
What questions?

890
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,172
Very important questions.

891
00:53:40,315 --> 00:53:41,111
Go ahead.

892
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:45,614
If you think the accused is handsome,
please raise your hands.

893
00:53:49,557 --> 00:53:53,357
If not, please raise your hands.

894
00:53:55,463 --> 00:53:57,055
If you think the accused
is terribly ugly,

895
00:53:57,231 --> 00:53:59,631
please raise your hands.

896
00:54:10,945 --> 00:54:14,346
Ladies and gentlemen,
the accused is ugly and poor,

897
00:54:14,582 --> 00:54:16,982
you can see how ugly looking he is.

898
00:54:17,285 --> 00:54:18,684
How could he seduce

899
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,718
the wife of the manager
of a well-off family?

900
00:54:21,856 --> 00:54:22,652
Your Honour, objection!

901
00:54:22,924 --> 00:54:24,118
Your Honour,

902
00:54:24,258 --> 00:54:26,852
I just want to prove
the motive of killing...

903
00:54:27,128 --> 00:54:29,323
is actually ridiculous!

904
00:54:29,564 --> 00:54:33,159
Your Honour, the defence counsel
is ridiculous and not practical!

905
00:54:33,534 --> 00:54:34,523
Alright, be a bit practical.

906
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:35,799
Lady,

907
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:37,596
if the accused wants to court you,
will you accept that?

908
00:54:37,772 --> 00:54:38,966
Of course not.

909
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,029
If he gives you a thousand,

910
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:41,833
can you stay with him for a night?

911
00:54:41,909 --> 00:54:44,104
Nuts! Doesn't he think he can court me
with a thousand only?

912
00:54:44,345 --> 00:54:45,539
What a creep!

913
00:54:47,048 --> 00:54:49,039
Auntie, you should answer
the question only.

914
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,944
Why did you scold me?
Who do you think you are?

915
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,315
You are a pervert!

916
00:54:54,522 --> 00:54:55,614
You murderer!

917
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,089
I tell you, I will not fall for you!

918
00:54:57,392 --> 00:54:59,587
You deserve to be put behind bars.
You deserve to die in jail!

919
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:00,955
You are too bad!

920
00:55:01,129 --> 00:55:03,927
I tell you, you jinx!

921
00:55:04,132 --> 00:55:05,121
Serve you right!

922
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:06,732
Quiet

923
00:55:08,202 --> 00:55:08,998
Your Honour,

924
00:55:09,237 --> 00:55:11,034
I've proved that
his motive is doubtful...

925
00:55:11,172 --> 00:55:11,968
Your Honour,

926
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,038
the accused's look doesn't make sense
with killing.

927
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:17,006
- By the way, the...
- Wait!

928
00:55:17,145 --> 00:55:18,737
You should wait, by the way...

929
00:55:18,813 --> 00:55:19,802
Listen to me first.

930
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:21,573
Even he wanted to kill Chun,
he would go some place else.

931
00:55:21,616 --> 00:55:24,016
It's senseless to kill in the place
where he is working.

932
00:55:24,285 --> 00:55:25,684
What do you think the cause
of Chun's death?

933
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:27,878
I don't know, you'd better think!

934
00:55:28,022 --> 00:55:30,013
Maybe, Ho Chun wanted to rape Foon.
But he failed.

935
00:55:30,191 --> 00:55:33,183
So he committed suicide
and made Foon be the scapegoat.

936
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:37,261
Chan Mon-gut, this is the British court,

937
00:55:37,432 --> 00:55:39,832
not the poor court of you Chinese.

938
00:55:40,001 --> 00:55:41,400
I don't know what you are doing here.

939
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:42,763
You don't know anything about law.

940
00:55:43,004 --> 00:55:44,995
Please go back to study more.

941
00:55:45,173 --> 00:55:46,970
Even you don't think
of your own reputation,

942
00:55:47,108 --> 00:55:50,509
you'd think of the face
of your fellow people.

943
00:55:52,847 --> 00:55:54,439
Sorry...

944
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:56,815
He always mentions the United Kingdom.

945
00:55:56,984 --> 00:55:59,384
It seems he's forgotten that
Hong Kong was leased to the UK.

946
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,019
They have to return it one day!

947
00:56:01,222 --> 00:56:04,214
Damn it, how dare he be that cocky
in our territory!?

948
00:56:04,425 --> 00:56:05,824
For Foon's sake, don't offend him, OK?

949
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,459
But that's the fact!

950
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:09,421
Sorry! ...

951
00:56:12,767 --> 00:56:14,166
Summon the witness.

952
00:56:14,368 --> 00:56:15,562
I was washing rice inside the kitchen.

953
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,661
When I heard the gun shot,
I rushed to the backyard at once.

954
00:56:17,872 --> 00:56:18,861
What did you see?

955
00:56:19,107 --> 00:56:20,904
I saw Ho Chun lying on the ground,

956
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:22,701
with blood all over his body.

957
00:56:22,944 --> 00:56:25,936
Foon pointed a gun at him and laughed.

958
00:56:26,047 --> 00:56:27,844
He said,
"Ho Chun, you are dead meat now."

959
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:28,845
What's next?

960
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,172
I was afraid and screamed!

961
00:56:30,351 --> 00:56:31,545
Ho Foon got mad and chased after us.

962
00:56:31,786 --> 00:56:32,775
Objection!

963
00:56:33,087 --> 00:56:34,076
What did you say?

964
00:56:34,355 --> 00:56:36,152
What you've just said differs from the
statement you gave to the police.

965
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,381
I just want to ask
why you amended your statement?

966
00:56:38,626 --> 00:56:40,617
Objection sustained,
witness should answer the question.

967
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:41,989
I worry that Ho Foon will avenge me.

968
00:56:42,163 --> 00:56:43,755
So I didn't tell all the truth.

969
00:56:44,432 --> 00:56:46,423
I have no question, it's your turn.

970
00:56:48,102 --> 00:56:49,501
I would like to show the jury
the evidence, item number one first.

971
00:56:51,005 --> 00:56:53,405
Witness,
this gun can shoot only one bullet.

972
00:56:53,508 --> 00:56:56,500
You said you heard the gun shot,
so how could he shoot you again?

973
00:56:56,778 --> 00:56:58,177
He didn't want to kill me with gun.

974
00:56:58,379 --> 00:56:59,175
But by what?

975
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,574
Sword.

976
00:57:01,048 --> 00:57:02,242
Are you kidding me?

977
00:57:05,419 --> 00:57:06,818
Really?

978
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:09,582
He chased after me and wanted to kill me
with "capital chopper".

979
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:13,091
He chased after me,
and I was so afraid...

980
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,625
He hit me with rod, non-stop hitting...

981
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:24,668
He hit from the left
and then from the right...

982
00:57:27,275 --> 00:57:29,470
He wanted to use a pair of swords
to kill me.

983
00:57:32,747 --> 00:57:35,341
I haven't seen these evidence before.

984
00:57:37,251 --> 00:57:38,240
They are our new discoveries.

985
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:40,919
To kill a person, why should he bring
along so many weapons?

986
00:57:41,022 --> 00:57:42,216
That strongly proved that
he was well-planned to kill Chun.

987
00:57:42,523 --> 00:57:43,922
He even wanted to kill innocent citizen.

988
00:57:44,058 --> 00:57:45,855
Even though,
he didn't mind to die with all.

989
00:57:47,962 --> 00:57:49,156
Bull shit! You creeper!

990
00:57:49,263 --> 00:57:51,060
You are framing me,
you will die a dog's death!

991
00:57:51,265 --> 00:57:52,857
Bastard! You will go to hell!

992
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:55,832
Your Honour, I request to charge Foon
with some more charges...

993
00:57:56,103 --> 00:57:58,298
threatening judiciary officer,
contempt of court,

994
00:57:58,472 --> 00:57:59,666
bodily injury,

995
00:57:59,774 --> 00:58:01,571
and throw rubbish in public place.

996
00:58:03,344 --> 00:58:04,140
Chan Mon-gut.

997
00:58:04,412 --> 00:58:06,004
I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

998
00:58:06,247 --> 00:58:07,646
Don't lose your mind.

999
00:58:08,082 --> 00:58:10,073
Why did you throw my shoe away?

1000
00:58:10,251 --> 00:58:11,445
Give me back my shoe.

1001
00:58:11,686 --> 00:58:13,278
Take this first.

1002
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:38,005
Super swords!

1003
00:58:40,581 --> 00:58:43,573
Capital Chopper!

1004
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,313
I smell something weird.

1005
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:51,480
What's this?

1006
00:58:51,592 --> 00:58:52,991
Cat's stool.

1007
00:58:54,996 --> 00:58:56,395
Why are you that hungry?

1008
00:58:56,564 --> 00:58:58,964
It may be very important clues.

1009
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:00,725
Brother Lone, what made you think so?

1010
00:59:00,968 --> 00:59:03,368
Because of my name.

1011
00:59:04,572 --> 00:59:06,767
I made many clues.

1012
00:59:07,441 --> 00:59:08,635
How about that shoe?

1013
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,106
Yes, much is found!

1014
00:59:10,244 --> 00:59:11,836
Give it to Brother Lone,
it's very important!

1015
00:59:12,013 --> 00:59:13,207
Greet Brother Lone.

1016
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:14,641
Brother Lone.

1017
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:19,711
I heard steps.

1018
00:59:21,489 --> 00:59:24,481
And it's far away...

1019
00:59:24,759 --> 00:59:26,954
It's late, Brother Lone,
let's call it a day.

1020
00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:28,858
Wait for me.

1021
00:59:29,597 --> 00:59:31,189
Super swords and capital chopper.

1022
00:59:31,365 --> 00:59:33,356
I can tell it's a trap.

1023
00:59:34,402 --> 00:59:35,596
The prosecutor is cocky!

1024
00:59:35,836 --> 00:59:36,928
Who the hell is he?

1025
00:59:37,138 --> 00:59:37,934
A very sharp-tongued lawyer.

1026
00:59:38,172 --> 00:59:38,968
What a co-incidence,

1027
00:59:39,106 --> 00:59:41,097
he is Ho Chun's boss, named Ho Chung.

1028
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:44,602
Who is his boss then?

1029
00:59:44,745 --> 00:59:47,145
His dad, Ho Sai.

1030
00:59:47,281 --> 00:59:48,475
Ho Sai?

1031
00:59:48,582 --> 00:59:49,981
He is a rich merchant,

1032
00:59:50,251 --> 00:59:51,240
and is the council member.

1033
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:53,714
He owns many properties
in Western District.

1034
00:59:54,355 --> 00:59:55,754
Sai?

1035
00:59:55,923 --> 00:59:57,322
Yes, Sai.

1036
00:59:57,525 --> 00:59:59,322
Hearing this word "Sai", I...

1037
00:59:59,493 --> 01:00:00,892
Did it ring your bell?

1038
01:00:01,062 --> 01:00:06,466
Right, because I remember Foon has...

1039
01:00:06,634 --> 01:00:07,430
What?

1040
01:00:07,702 --> 01:00:09,499
A piece of jade which the word
"Sai" is carved.

1041
01:00:10,104 --> 01:00:12,299
Maybe, there is another story.

1042
01:00:19,647 --> 01:00:21,638
This may be related to the poor orphan,
Ho Foon.

1043
01:00:21,882 --> 01:00:23,076
- Wu Man.
- Hubby.

1044
01:00:23,351 --> 01:00:24,943
Do you know anything about Ho Sai?

1045
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,518
He is a Catholic, a righteous man.

1046
01:00:26,821 --> 01:00:28,015
Good! Yan.

1047
01:00:28,189 --> 01:00:29,986
Yes, Send this picture
to Ho Sai at once.

1048
01:00:30,257 --> 01:00:32,452
I want him to meet Foon in court.

1049
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,557
Master, why do you draw
such pervertible picture?

1050
01:00:34,729 --> 01:00:36,128
Do you feel happy?

1051
01:00:48,542 --> 01:00:50,533
Brother Lone, we all count on you.

1052
01:00:50,745 --> 01:00:51,939
Please go ahead.

1053
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,876
The witness

1054
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:55,673
must be bribed or threatened.

1055
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:58,145
An eye for an eye!
I want to threaten them too.

1056
01:00:58,319 --> 01:00:59,513
Please find them out.

1057
01:00:59,787 --> 01:01:02,585
And then torture them,
make them confess.

1058
01:01:02,757 --> 01:01:05,157
Good idea.
How can you figure this idea out?

1059
01:01:05,393 --> 01:01:07,588
I... I use my brain.

1060
01:01:08,529 --> 01:01:09,723
Don't worry.

1061
01:01:11,465 --> 01:01:12,864
Count on me.

1062
01:01:25,546 --> 01:01:28,344
It's alright, count on me.

1063
01:01:32,486 --> 01:01:34,681
Don't worry, count on me.

1064
01:01:39,126 --> 01:01:41,321
Brother Lone doesn't seem to be alright

1065
01:01:44,298 --> 01:01:46,698
Your Honour,
I would like to summon a new witness.

1066
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:48,559
What big deal?

1067
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:50,030
Your old man!

1068
01:01:50,237 --> 01:01:51,636
Objection, how dare he scold my old man?

1069
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:56,070
Come on, don't always object,
can you listen his words first?

1070
01:01:56,377 --> 01:01:58,971
Summon Sir Ho Sai.

1071
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,579
I mean your dad!

1072
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:12,190
This is my master.

1073
01:02:13,661 --> 01:02:15,060
Chan Mon-gut.

1074
01:02:15,229 --> 01:02:17,424
Sir, thank you for your help.

1075
01:02:35,816 --> 01:02:39,013
Please follow me.
I swear with my sincerity.

1076
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:44,683
Sir, do you know the accused Ho Foon?

1077
01:02:44,892 --> 01:02:45,881
No.

1078
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:50,723
But he is like my concubine Yu-fa.

1079
01:02:51,832 --> 01:02:52,821
What?

1080
01:02:53,067 --> 01:02:55,467
You have had a son
with your concubine?

1081
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:59,467
Yes, we have a son named Nim-sai.

1082
01:03:00,274 --> 01:03:03,266
But he is dead.

1083
01:03:04,044 --> 01:03:05,636
Why?

1084
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,674
I don't know.

1085
01:03:07,781 --> 01:03:09,180
Why don't you know that?

1086
01:03:09,383 --> 01:03:11,578
We've lost each other for over 20 years.

1087
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:13,516
Why did you say he's dead?

1088
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:15,418
I saw his dead body.

1089
01:03:15,623 --> 01:03:18,421
How could you confirm that was your son?

1090
01:03:18,692 --> 01:03:20,683
From his ass.

1091
01:03:20,895 --> 01:03:22,294
Ass?

1092
01:03:22,463 --> 01:03:23,259
Right,

1093
01:03:23,564 --> 01:03:27,557
I saw a triangular birthmark
on the body's ass.

1094
01:03:27,768 --> 01:03:29,963
That makes me believe that
was my son's dead body.

1095
01:03:30,704 --> 01:03:33,104
Sir, there are so many unexpected things
happened on earth.

1096
01:03:33,307 --> 01:03:34,706
For many things, you may not believe it.

1097
01:03:34,975 --> 01:03:37,170
Foon, do you want me to teach you?

1098
01:03:37,511 --> 01:03:38,705
Take off your pants! Now!

1099
01:03:38,879 --> 01:03:39,868
Yes!

1100
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,714
How about the one I saw?

1101
01:03:47,988 --> 01:03:49,182
You just saw his ass, but not the face.

1102
01:03:49,456 --> 01:03:51,253
The birthmark may be drawn by someone.

1103
01:03:51,959 --> 01:03:53,551
It may be drawn by someone.

1104
01:03:53,827 --> 01:03:55,226
So you are my son?

1105
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:57,796
I'm so glad to see you meeting your son!

1106
01:03:57,965 --> 01:03:58,954
Nim-sai!

1107
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:03,967
Nim-sai...

1108
01:04:06,807 --> 01:04:09,401
Don't be too excited.

1109
01:04:09,543 --> 01:04:11,738
Men, come and take care of Sir Ho.

1110
01:04:14,949 --> 01:04:15,938
So, you've seen,

1111
01:04:16,183 --> 01:04:18,174
Sir Ho admitted the accused as his son.

1112
01:04:18,419 --> 01:04:24,016
This may be a deliberate conspiracy,

1113
01:04:24,325 --> 01:04:27,522
a trap for a nullius filius.

1114
01:04:27,761 --> 01:04:29,752
But the witness didn't swear

1115
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:31,556
in front of the Bible.

1116
01:04:31,832 --> 01:04:34,426
So, his words won't be accepted
by the court.

1117
01:04:34,602 --> 01:04:35,591
He swore.

1118
01:04:35,803 --> 01:04:38,601
His hands touched the Bible,
but he said nothing.

1119
01:04:38,806 --> 01:04:40,205
Alright, again.

1120
01:04:54,822 --> 01:04:57,017
Your Honour,
although such a sad thing happened,

1121
01:04:57,191 --> 01:04:58,988
the words of the witness said
before his death...

1122
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,249
should be forgotten.

1123
01:05:00,461 --> 01:05:01,655
Nuts!

1124
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:03,228
He did say the truth,
how can you deny it?

1125
01:05:04,999 --> 01:05:07,593
Sorry, law is law.

1126
01:05:07,768 --> 01:05:09,360
Not any word should be amended.

1127
01:05:09,503 --> 01:05:10,902
Chan Mon-gut, I can't help you.

1128
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:13,869
Your Honour, you can!

1129
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:15,905
You'd better learn again.

1130
01:05:16,677 --> 01:05:18,269
Your dad died,
and you don't even shed a tear.

1131
01:05:18,445 --> 01:05:19,844
I think I'd better learn from you.

1132
01:05:20,247 --> 01:05:22,442
It's all because of you!

1133
01:05:22,616 --> 01:05:23,605
My dad had heart disease.

1134
01:05:23,784 --> 01:05:25,775
If you didn't ask him to be witness,
he wouldn't have died.

1135
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:27,214
You, murderer!

1136
01:05:28,522 --> 01:05:30,114
Your Honour, I am sorry.

1137
01:05:30,324 --> 01:05:33,725
My father died,
I can't control my emotion.

1138
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,636
What's up?

1139
01:05:47,941 --> 01:05:49,340
Damn it! You pretend crying!

1140
01:05:49,576 --> 01:05:50,565
You bastard!

1141
01:05:50,778 --> 01:05:52,769
You don't even have tears in your eyes,
can you see it?

1142
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,379
It's dry!

1143
01:05:54,915 --> 01:05:56,906
You are caught red-handed!

1144
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:58,176
Why do you pretend crying?

1145
01:05:58,385 --> 01:05:59,579
To hell with you!

1146
01:06:00,854 --> 01:06:04,051
Hey, you'd better behave!

1147
01:06:04,258 --> 01:06:06,453
Wait, let me tell you a story.

1148
01:06:06,593 --> 01:06:10,791
Once upon a time,
there was a noble named Ho.

1149
01:06:11,065 --> 01:06:13,056
He had a son named Ho Chung.

1150
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:17,703
Sir Ho was old,
his son would be his heir of course.

1151
01:06:17,938 --> 01:06:22,341
But, suddenly,
his nullius filius Ho Foon appeared.

1152
01:06:25,012 --> 01:06:27,207
Someone worried his status
would be affected.

1153
01:06:27,448 --> 01:06:29,643
So he sent his fellow Chun...

1154
01:06:29,817 --> 01:06:31,614
to kill that nullius filius.

1155
01:06:31,785 --> 01:06:33,377
But, Chun failed.

1156
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,512
Someone just took this opportunity
to kill Chun.

1157
01:06:36,657 --> 01:06:40,650
And made that poor kid be the scapegoat.

1158
01:06:40,894 --> 01:06:45,695
That guy is really hard-hearted
and cold-blooded!

1159
01:06:50,838 --> 01:06:53,636
What do you think about my assumption?

1160
01:07:01,682 --> 01:07:04,082
Prosecutor, why do you laugh?

1161
01:07:04,718 --> 01:07:07,516
Because this is such a nonsense
and stupid story.

1162
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:08,782
Nonsense and stupid, huh?

1163
01:07:09,089 --> 01:07:10,488
But you are all sweat!

1164
01:07:10,824 --> 01:07:12,416
It's really weird.

1165
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:17,222
Prosecutor, where were you when
the homicide happened?

1166
01:07:17,431 --> 01:07:18,227
At home.

1167
01:07:18,499 --> 01:07:19,295
What were you doing?

1168
01:07:19,633 --> 01:07:20,224
Reading.

1169
01:07:20,367 --> 01:07:21,163
What book did you read?

1170
01:07:21,301 --> 01:07:21,892
A tale of two cities.

1171
01:07:22,102 --> 01:07:22,898
Where did you stop?

1172
01:07:23,003 --> 01:07:25,403
Well... the soldiers...

1173
01:07:25,706 --> 01:07:26,695
The soldiers met Snow White,
is that right?

1174
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:27,929
Yes, they met Snow White...

1175
01:07:28,275 --> 01:07:30,675
No, you are fooling me!

1176
01:07:30,811 --> 01:07:34,008
Smart you! So, where did you stop?

1177
01:07:34,748 --> 01:07:35,737
Why should I answer your question?

1178
01:07:35,983 --> 01:07:37,382
Right, I don't know
why you want to answer me!

1179
01:07:37,684 --> 01:07:38,878
What a shame!

1180
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,108
Chan Mon-gut, you've gone too far!

1181
01:07:40,254 --> 01:07:41,653
Wipe your sweat first!

1182
01:07:43,524 --> 01:07:46,322
I think you haven't had
good sleep lately.

1183
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,960
Does Ho Chun visit you every night?

1184
01:07:49,163 --> 01:07:49,959
Your Honour!

1185
01:07:50,197 --> 01:07:50,788
Let's go back to our topic,

1186
01:07:51,064 --> 01:07:52,656
what did you do that night?

1187
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:56,030
I told you, I read at home.

1188
01:07:56,203 --> 01:07:57,602
No, I don't mean
the night Chun was killed.

1189
01:07:57,871 --> 01:07:59,862
I mean the night
before he was killed.

1190
01:08:00,107 --> 01:08:01,904
Before killing him,
I went...

1191
01:08:06,547 --> 01:08:07,741
Yes!

1192
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:11,482
You're finished!

1193
01:08:16,557 --> 01:08:18,548
Your Honour,
I request to reach the final address.

1194
01:08:18,826 --> 01:08:22,227
Damn you! Tell us what you did
on the night before Chun's death.

1195
01:08:23,797 --> 01:08:25,196
Police.

1196
01:08:29,636 --> 01:08:31,627
No! I mean Chan Mon-gut.

1197
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:33,135
What's the matter?

1198
01:08:33,373 --> 01:08:37,571
The defence counsel's personal point
of view is really amazing!

1199
01:08:37,778 --> 01:08:39,973
But according to the legal procedure...

1200
01:08:40,147 --> 01:08:42,547
Come on! Why are you so stubborn?

1201
01:08:43,016 --> 01:08:45,211
You're charged with contempt of court.

1202
01:08:45,352 --> 01:08:49,948
I have to sent you to jail for one day.

1203
01:08:50,257 --> 01:08:51,656
Immediate execution.

1204
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:53,558
Your Honour, are you kidding me?

1205
01:08:53,727 --> 01:08:55,524
Your Honour, can you give me face?

1206
01:08:55,696 --> 01:08:57,493
- Hubby.
- Are you kidding me?

1207
01:09:00,534 --> 01:09:02,331
Your Honour, for what we've just heard,

1208
01:09:02,603 --> 01:09:04,195
should we forget them too?

1209
01:09:04,505 --> 01:09:07,497
Since the statement
is against legal procedure,

1210
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:12,304
Jury, you should forget
everything you've just heard.

1211
01:09:12,846 --> 01:09:15,644
Chan Mon-gut will be represented
by Wu Man.

1212
01:09:15,883 --> 01:09:18,078
Tomorrow, the final address
should be presented.

1213
01:09:18,385 --> 01:09:19,784
Court.

1214
01:09:57,558 --> 01:09:58,752
Brother Foon.

1215
01:09:59,192 --> 01:10:00,181
Miss Shui.

1216
01:10:00,594 --> 01:10:01,788
Why are you here?

1217
01:10:01,962 --> 01:10:03,361
I come to save you.

1218
01:10:03,497 --> 01:10:04,896
Alright, I'll pack up first.

1219
01:10:07,834 --> 01:10:09,631
I just want to prove your personality.

1220
01:10:10,437 --> 01:10:11,836
I am right.

1221
01:10:12,105 --> 01:10:15,302
You are a gutless coward.

1222
01:10:15,442 --> 01:10:16,431
What?

1223
01:10:16,977 --> 01:10:18,171
If you leave like this,

1224
01:10:18,478 --> 01:10:20,070
you will be sinful forever.

1225
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,475
You can't live peacefully and you'd hide
up for the rest of your life.

1226
01:10:22,649 --> 01:10:24,844
You would be a criminal forever.

1227
01:10:27,287 --> 01:10:29,084
I have decided to stay.

1228
01:10:29,323 --> 01:10:30,722
That's why I love you.

1229
01:10:36,797 --> 01:10:38,196
Creep!

1230
01:10:39,266 --> 01:10:40,460
Ho Foon, someone comes to visit you.

1231
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:44,669
Miss Shui.

1232
01:10:46,473 --> 01:10:47,667
Where did you cut your hair?

1233
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:49,102
Number 9, Nathan Road.

1234
01:10:49,276 --> 01:10:51,073
Cut the crap, I won't go.

1235
01:10:51,278 --> 01:10:53,075
I am not a gutless coward.

1236
01:10:53,347 --> 01:10:54,746
If I leave like this, I will be sinful
for the rest of my life.

1237
01:10:54,848 --> 01:10:56,247
I won't live peacefully.

1238
01:10:56,383 --> 01:10:57,975
And I will be a criminal forever.

1239
01:10:58,218 --> 01:10:59,617
I won't leave.

1240
01:10:59,786 --> 01:11:01,981
I come to express my support.

1241
01:11:02,189 --> 01:11:03,588
You can't lose in this case.

1242
01:11:03,857 --> 01:11:06,052
Because your master's name
is so important.

1243
01:11:07,427 --> 01:11:08,826
But now, I know that,

1244
01:11:09,129 --> 01:11:11,927
you are a real brave and quixotic hero.

1245
01:11:13,467 --> 01:11:15,264
I believe that you are innocent.

1246
01:11:17,104 --> 01:11:18,298
I'll wait for you.

1247
01:11:18,438 --> 01:11:20,235
Good speech!

1248
01:11:22,509 --> 01:11:24,909
Will you wait for me?

1249
01:11:35,288 --> 01:11:36,482
You'll be released at 5 p.m. tomorrow.

1250
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:38,487
How about the final address?

1251
01:11:38,825 --> 01:11:40,417
They can do nothing to me.

1252
01:11:40,594 --> 01:11:41,993
They can't imagine that,
you studied law in UK too.

1253
01:11:42,262 --> 01:11:43,854
Tomorrow, you'll take my place.

1254
01:11:44,197 --> 01:11:45,391
Hubby...

1255
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:47,258
You'll handle Foon's life.

1256
01:11:47,467 --> 01:11:49,059
You sent me to study law in UK...

1257
01:11:49,336 --> 01:11:51,133
isn't it because you felt boring?

1258
01:11:51,405 --> 01:11:53,805
Of course not! The world is so big!

1259
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:56,032
I think, it's a good deed...

1260
01:11:56,309 --> 01:11:58,903
to let you see the world, is that right?

1261
01:11:59,546 --> 01:12:02,140
Hubby, I didn't study law in UK.

1262
01:12:03,016 --> 01:12:04,608
They rejected me.

1263
01:12:05,452 --> 01:12:07,647
So, what did you study in UK?

1264
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:10,281
Fashion design.

1265
01:12:10,524 --> 01:12:11,718
What did you say?

1266
01:12:11,858 --> 01:12:14,850
- Time's up.
- I studied fashion design.

1267
01:12:14,961 --> 01:12:16,553
Fashion design.

1268
01:12:16,797 --> 01:12:17,991
Hubby, what shall we do?

1269
01:12:18,198 --> 01:12:20,189
Fashion design?!

1270
01:12:24,337 --> 01:12:25,736
Court.

1271
01:12:32,813 --> 01:12:36,010
Prosecutor,
you can start your final address now.

1272
01:12:39,152 --> 01:12:41,143
Although sentiment counts beyond law.

1273
01:12:41,388 --> 01:12:43,982
One should be punished if he killed.

1274
01:12:44,357 --> 01:12:45,551
You'd better think.

1275
01:12:45,826 --> 01:12:47,225
If your family was killed,

1276
01:12:47,427 --> 01:12:48,826
what'll you do?

1277
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:50,726
Now, all the evidences
which the court admitted,

1278
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:54,332
prove Ho Foon is the murderer.

1279
01:12:54,568 --> 01:12:58,971
I request the jury would plead
Ho Foon guilty.

1280
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:01,329
Defence counsel.

1281
01:13:05,345 --> 01:13:07,745
My husband paid me to study law in UK.

1282
01:13:08,014 --> 01:13:10,209
But I am so sorry to him,
I didn't study law.

1283
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:12,347
I studied fashion design.

1284
01:13:15,589 --> 01:13:17,181
I am not well educated,

1285
01:13:17,424 --> 01:13:18,823
but I don't understand one thing.

1286
01:13:19,092 --> 01:13:22,084
What's more important?

1287
01:13:22,529 --> 01:13:24,520
Legal procedure or life?

1288
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:28,193
Your Honour, if you don't mind me
telling my point of view.

1289
01:13:28,401 --> 01:13:31,393
I think that,
you've studied so many years of law,

1290
01:13:31,538 --> 01:13:33,529
you have got nothing at all.

1291
01:13:36,109 --> 01:13:38,907
Like my husband, I haven't studied law.

1292
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,477
But I dare to open my eyes
to see what's right and wrong.

1293
01:13:43,216 --> 01:13:45,411
I am proud of my hubby.

1294
01:13:45,685 --> 01:13:47,084
I love him.

1295
01:13:47,921 --> 01:13:51,118
Jury, I believe that you are not nuts.

1296
01:13:51,224 --> 01:13:52,816
You should know how to judge.

1297
01:13:53,093 --> 01:13:55,084
If all of you are nuts,

1298
01:13:55,262 --> 01:13:56,854
it'll be useless to say anything.

1299
01:13:58,198 --> 01:13:59,597
Thank you very much.

1300
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:11,004
You've been released!

1301
01:14:11,211 --> 01:14:12,007
Yes.

1302
01:14:12,145 --> 01:14:13,134
You heard everything?

1303
01:14:13,313 --> 01:14:14,109
Yes.

1304
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:14,838
What do you think?

1305
01:14:15,115 --> 01:14:17,310
Excellent!

1306
01:14:20,554 --> 01:14:22,749
You're very much appreciated.

1307
01:14:23,256 --> 01:14:24,655
You are flattering me.

1308
01:14:24,925 --> 01:14:26,722
Of course not! Look.

1309
01:14:31,498 --> 01:14:34,296
The blind is being touched by you,
he is crying.

1310
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:36,592
Your Honour, if there isn't anything
special, I request a rest.

1311
01:14:36,736 --> 01:14:39,933
For I have an eye problem.
You see pus from my eyes?

1312
01:14:48,882 --> 01:14:50,679
Jury, have you reached any verdict?

1313
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:51,906
Yes.

1314
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:55,415
Unanimous?

1315
01:14:55,522 --> 01:14:56,716
Yes.

1316
01:15:04,531 --> 01:15:06,931
The jury has pleaded the accused guilty.

1317
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:11,160
As stipulated,

1318
01:15:15,275 --> 01:15:18,472
the accused should be hanged.

1319
01:15:34,194 --> 01:15:36,594
Court.

1320
01:15:49,709 --> 01:15:50,903
Wait.

1321
01:15:58,952 --> 01:16:01,352
Thank you for taking care of me.

1322
01:16:01,488 --> 01:16:03,080
This chicken leg is for you.

1323
01:16:18,171 --> 01:16:19,160
Sir.

1324
01:17:05,785 --> 01:17:08,982
You kill me,
but many many Ho Foons will appear.

1325
01:17:11,992 --> 01:17:13,584
Sir.

1326
01:17:18,665 --> 01:17:19,859
Wait.

1327
01:17:20,133 --> 01:17:22,328
Your Honour, what punishment
Ho Foon should receive?

1328
01:17:22,602 --> 01:17:24,593
He is stipulated to be hanged.

1329
01:17:24,738 --> 01:17:27,138
It's alright. Yan. Let him down.

1330
01:17:28,174 --> 01:17:29,368
What do you want?

1331
01:17:29,542 --> 01:17:30,941
You just ordered to hang him.

1332
01:17:31,077 --> 01:17:32,669
Not hang him to "death".

1333
01:17:32,979 --> 01:17:33,968
Now, he has been hung.

1334
01:17:34,247 --> 01:17:35,441
So, you should set him free now.

1335
01:17:35,715 --> 01:17:36,511
That's cavil at words!

1336
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:37,944
Your Honour, law is law.

1337
01:17:38,184 --> 01:17:40,175
Not even one letter should be amended.

1338
01:17:40,387 --> 01:17:41,581
Now, I can't help you.

1339
01:17:42,422 --> 01:17:43,218
Your Honour!

1340
01:17:44,224 --> 01:17:45,623
Think before you speak.

1341
01:17:45,892 --> 01:17:47,484
Otherwise, you will lose the face
of British government.

1342
01:17:47,694 --> 01:17:49,685
And you may be charged with murdering.

1343
01:17:54,467 --> 01:17:56,264
I want an urgent meeting first.

1344
01:17:56,436 --> 01:17:57,630
Alright, back to your work.

1345
01:17:57,804 --> 01:17:58,793
You are all nuts!

1346
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:00,028
Get lost.

1347
01:18:13,953 --> 01:18:15,147
It's my time!

1348
01:18:40,547 --> 01:18:41,946
The final decision
of the court has been reached.

1349
01:18:42,148 --> 01:18:43,547
The penalty has been carried out.

1350
01:18:43,716 --> 01:18:45,707
Ho Foon is free now.

1351
01:18:50,423 --> 01:18:52,414
Bravo!

1352
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,899
I'm free.

1353
01:19:02,168 --> 01:19:04,159
Ho Chung, you are under arrest,
you are charged with murder.

1354
01:19:07,574 --> 01:19:08,768
Brother Foon.

1355
01:19:08,908 --> 01:19:09,897
Lotus.

1356
01:19:10,243 --> 01:19:14,441
My dear baby, your sudden appearance...

1357
01:19:14,714 --> 01:19:18,309
makes me feel excited...

1358
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,811
Closer...

1359
01:19:23,123 --> 01:19:26,320
I am ready. Alright?

1360
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,492
We are going to take
the bridal pictures,

1361
01:19:35,602 --> 01:19:37,593
we should be a bit serious,
is that right, hubby?

1362
01:19:37,737 --> 01:19:39,728
Well, look at me!

1363
01:19:40,073 --> 01:19:41,665
More serious!

1364
01:19:41,774 --> 01:19:42,570
Bravo!

1365
01:19:42,809 --> 01:19:44,606
Master, here comes Foon.

1366
01:19:45,011 --> 01:19:48,208
Master, Madam.

1367
01:19:48,448 --> 01:19:49,244
Foon.

1368
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:50,006
Brother Foon.

1369
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:50,946
Brother Gut.

1370
01:19:51,317 --> 01:19:52,306
Where is Miss Shui?

1371
01:19:52,519 --> 01:19:53,713
I sent her to study in Britain.

1372
01:19:53,887 --> 01:19:54,683
What's she going to study?

1373
01:19:54,754 --> 01:19:55,743
English literature.

1374
01:19:56,089 --> 01:19:57,488
That's to study Shakespeare.

1375
01:19:57,724 --> 01:20:00,318
You are cultured!
You know Shakespeare too?

1376
01:20:00,593 --> 01:20:01,992
She's suitable to study
English literature.

1377
01:20:02,462 --> 01:20:04,259
That's good for her.

1378
01:20:04,764 --> 01:20:05,355
Foon.

1379
01:20:05,598 --> 01:20:06,587
Master.

1380
01:20:06,733 --> 01:20:08,530
Your hair matches your face.

1381
01:20:08,801 --> 01:20:11,395
You look great!
I am so glad to see it.

1382
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:14,071
Master, today, you marry again,

1383
01:20:14,207 --> 01:20:15,401
I am so glad to see it too.

1384
01:20:15,775 --> 01:20:16,969
Well, you must be happier.

1385
01:20:17,043 --> 01:20:18,840
No, you must be happier.

1386
01:20:19,012 --> 01:20:20,809
Give me face,
say you're happier than I am.

1387
01:20:20,914 --> 01:20:22,506
You're happier.

1388
01:20:22,715 --> 01:20:24,706
Come on, look at the camera.

1389
01:20:26,953 --> 01:20:28,545
Concentrate, watch.

1390
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:30,483
It's alright!

1391
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:31,984
Number nine, Nathan Road?

1392
01:20:32,225 --> 01:20:34,022
Bastard, you look great.

1393
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:36,453
Damn it, no big deal?

1394
01:20:36,596 --> 01:20:38,188
I don't mind telling you.
A smart looking guy is a big shot!

1395
01:20:38,431 --> 01:20:39,420
So what?
