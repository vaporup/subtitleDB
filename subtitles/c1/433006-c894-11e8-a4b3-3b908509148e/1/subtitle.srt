00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:48,206
The little guy crawls
back on the porch.

534
00:22:48,206 --> 00:22:50,606
Right then the man
walks out of his house

535
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:53,966
On his way to work.
He sees this snail again.

536
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:56,846
So he looks at it,
and he says...

537
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:01,646
"What the fuck's
your problem?!"

538
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:09,806
That's not funny.
That's not funny.

539
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,246
What you
laughin' for then,

540
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:12,206
If it ain't funny?

541
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:14,126
I don't know, man. I--

542
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,006
Hey, hey!
You figure that joke out,

543
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:19,406
You'll figure
the streets out.

544
00:23:19,406 --> 00:23:21,326
Shit, there ain't
nothin' to figure out.

545
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:22,766
That's just some
senseless bullshit.

546
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:23,726
Don't listen to him.

547
00:23:23,726 --> 00:23:25,646
Yeah, well, i--

548
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:26,606
I already
figured 'em out.

549
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,046
Oh, yeah?
Oh, really?

550
00:23:28,046 --> 00:23:29,006
Yeah.

551
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:30,926
You already
figured the streets out?

552
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:31,886
Yeah, well, it's--

553
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:35,726
It's all about
smiles and cries.

554
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:37,166
Put the drink down, man.

555
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:38,606
This motherfucker's
out of his mind.

556
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:40,046
Hey, hold on, alonzo.
Hold on, hold on.

557
00:23:40,526 --> 00:23:42,446
Smiles and cries.
Smiles and cries.

558
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:44,366
Smiles and cries.
I hear you.

559
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:46,766
Yeah, you gotta--

560
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:49,166
You gotta control
your smiles and cries,

561
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,086
Because that's
all you have,

562
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:53,966
And nobody can
take that away from you.

563
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:57,326
Oh, shit.

564
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:04,526
What you think, dog?
Hmm?

565
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,926
Think this greenhorn
can handle undercover?

566
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:09,326
You were just like him.

567
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:10,286
What?

568
00:24:10,286 --> 00:24:12,686
Same silly-Ass look
and everything.

569
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,606
Savin' the god damn world!

570
00:24:14,606 --> 00:24:15,566
Yeah.
Yeah!

571
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:17,486
Yeah, now that's
some smiles and cries

572
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:18,926
For your ass.

573
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:20,846
Yeah. Shit lasted
about a week.

574
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:21,806
[Chuckles]
yeah.

575
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:24,206
I gotta get back
to the office.

576
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:25,646
Thanks for the snort,
dog.

577
00:24:25,646 --> 00:24:27,086
Always good
to see you, brother.

578
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,046
Yeah.
Yes, sir!

579
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:30,446
Mm-Hmm. What you doin'
later on?

580
00:24:30,446 --> 00:24:31,886
Stay in the house,
save some cheddar.

581
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:33,806
I'm less than a year
away from my dream.

582
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,246
Philippine islands,
here I come,

583
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:36,686
And I ain't never
comin' back!

584
00:24:36,686 --> 00:24:38,126
That's right.
Let me go with you.

585
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:39,998
You're invited.
Aaugh!

586
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:55,406
Hey.

587
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:58,766
Open your eyes, man,
you'll feel a lot better.

588
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:06,446
Boom! Come on, man,
sit your ass up.

589
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:13,166
Who are you?

590
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:17,966
I'm the zigzag man.
Who the fuck are you?

591
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:20,366
I'm a cop, man.
Watch out.

592
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:21,806
A'ight.
Don't shoot nobody.

593
00:25:21,806 --> 00:25:22,766
Why don't you get
that beer in you, man?

594
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:24,206
That'll give you ballast.

595
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:25,166
Oh, no.
For real.

596
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,126
Get that up in you, man.

597
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:28,046
You'll feel better.

598
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:45,806
Stop the car, man!
What?

599
00:25:45,806 --> 00:25:47,726
Stop the car. Stop--
Stop the car!

600
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:49,645
I saw something.
Stop the fucking car!

601
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:51,086
All right, hold on.
Hold the fuck--

602
00:25:51,566 --> 00:25:52,526
Hey. Hey! Hey!

603
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:54,446
[Horns honk, tires screech]

604
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,166
Fuck me, man! Shit!

605
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,086
[Girl crying out]

606
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:05,486
Police officer!
Get away from the girl!

607
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:06,446
Get away from her!

608
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:07,406
I'm gonna fuck you, too, cop!

609
00:26:07,406 --> 00:26:08,845
Aah!

610
00:26:41,486 --> 00:26:42,926
We didn't
do shit, man!

611
00:26:42,926 --> 00:26:43,886
That bitch is crazy!
Unh!

612
00:26:47,726 --> 00:26:50,606
Roll over, man.
Roll the fuck over!

613
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:52,526
Fuckin'-Ass prick!

614
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:56,366
[Chuckles]

615
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,326
My niggah!

616
00:26:57,806 --> 00:26:59,246
Go ahead, cowboy.

617
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:01,166
You got
mad squabbles, boy!

618
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:03,086
Thanks for the help.

619
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:05,486
Yeah, you shoulda
shot 'em.

620
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:06,926
What's happenin'?
Oh, hey.

621
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:07,886
You're fucking dead!

622
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:09,325
Ok, wait a minute.
Hold it. Hold it!

623
00:27:09,325 --> 00:27:11,245
You, too,
fucking white boy!

624
00:27:11,726 --> 00:27:12,686
My cousins are
from hillsidetrece,

625
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,125
And they're gonna
blast you fools!

626
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,046
Calm down. Calm down,
all right? Are you ok?

627
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:17,965
No, I'm not ok.
Look at my nose, man!

628
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:19,406
It's just a little
nosebleed.

629
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:21,326
Just put a little ice
on it, you're gonna be fine.

630
00:27:21,326 --> 00:27:22,765
What are you doin'
out here anyway? Huh?

631
00:27:23,246 --> 00:27:24,685
These pieces of shit,
they probably got aids,

632
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,605
You know? Why are you
not in school?

633
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:29,485
I was just goin'
to a ditch party--

634
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:32,846
You almost became a part
of the ditch party.

635
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:34,285
Now, you say
your cousins from where?

636
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,686
From hillsidetrece!
You fuckin' remember that, too!

637
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:37,646
Tell your cousins
to get your back,

638
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,085
All right?

639
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:41,005
Grab your bag
and go home right now.

640
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:41,965
Whoa, I need to get--

641
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:42,925
Go home right now!

642
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:44,845
We don't need
no statement. Go! Go.

643
00:27:44,845 --> 00:27:46,765
Yeah, they're gonna
fuck you up,iputo!

644
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:47,725
We're gonna cut 'em loose?

645
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:48,685
What, do you want
to beat 'em up? Go ahead.

646
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,605
Get down. Protect
and serve, brother.

647
00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:52,046
I got a punching bag
at home.

648
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:53,006
These guys should
be off the streets.

649
00:27:54,445 --> 00:27:56,365
You hear that, homey?

650
00:27:56,365 --> 00:27:58,285
You wanna go home, or you
wanna go to jail, huh?

651
00:27:58,285 --> 00:27:59,726
What you think?!

652
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:02,606
Ahh. Got room for you
at the booty house.

653
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:04,526
You ever been
to the booty house?

654
00:28:04,526 --> 00:28:05,965
Huh?

655
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:07,885
Big boys have you
grab your ankles, man.

656
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:10,765
Suck my dick, bitch!
I know people!

657
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:11,725
That's how it starts.

658
00:28:12,206 --> 00:28:14,605
What about you, my man?
What you got?

659
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:15,565
You ain't got nothin'?

660
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:17,006
No, man.
You sure?

661
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:17,966
Yeah, I'm sure.

662
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:18,926
Where's your horn?

663
00:28:18,926 --> 00:28:19,886
I ain't got no horn.

664
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:21,806
No?
Uh-Uh.

665
00:28:23,726 --> 00:28:24,686
You got money, though.

666
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:27,566
Aw, you lied to me.

667
00:28:27,566 --> 00:28:29,005
You lied to me.

668
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:31,885
Lucky I don't make you
eat that, dog.

669
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,286
Stand up, you. Stand up.

670
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,166
Stand the fuck up!

671
00:28:42,926 --> 00:28:45,806
Yeah. Oh, shit, huh?!
Huh? Huh?

672
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:53,486
Turn around, sucker.

673
00:28:53,486 --> 00:28:55,406
Turn around.

674
00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:58,765
So you like raping
young girls, huh?

675
00:28:58,765 --> 00:29:01,166
Hmm? You like to rape
young girls?

676
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,126
That's your m.O.?
No, no...

677
00:29:02,605 --> 00:29:03,565
That's what you like,
isn't it?

678
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:04,525
You like to rape
young girls.

679
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:06,926
That's what you like
to do, right?

680
00:29:06,926 --> 00:29:08,365
Don't lie to me.

681
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:10,285
You told me to "suck
your dick, bitch."

682
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:11,726
Isn't that what
you said to me?

683
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:15,085
Look at me.

684
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:16,045
You wanted me
to suck your dick.

685
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,446
That's what you said,
right?

686
00:29:18,446 --> 00:29:20,366
That what you said? Hmm?

687
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:22,286
Didn't you say,
"suck my dick, bitch"?

688
00:29:22,286 --> 00:29:23,246
Don't lie to me. That's
what--You keep telling me,

689
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:24,206
I'm a liar.
You didn't say,

690
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:25,166
"Suck my dick, bitch"?

691
00:29:25,645 --> 00:29:26,605
That's not what
you said to me?

692
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:29,006
So I'm lyin'?
Am I lyin'?

693
00:29:29,006 --> 00:29:30,926
No. Please. Please!

694
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:31,886
Where is it?
I can't even find it.

695
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:35,245
Let me see.
Pull your pants down.

696
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:36,686
Pull 'em down.

697
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,566
Which nut you want?

698
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:42,925
I'll leave you one nut.
Which one you want?

699
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:44,845
Make a decision.
Make a decision.

700
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:47,246
All right, all right.

701
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:49,645
Put your hands
on your head.

702
00:29:51,086 --> 00:29:52,046
Close your eyes.

703
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:55,405
Close your eyes.

704
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:58,285
Uhh!

705
00:30:00,205 --> 00:30:01,646
You're lucky I have
more pressing business.

706
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:03,085
I'd cut your fuckin'
dick off

707
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:05,005
And stick it right up that

00:53:06,637 --> 00:53:08,076
L.A.P.D.'S finest.

1237
00:53:08,076 --> 00:53:09,996
Don't speak unless
you're spoken to.

1238
00:53:09,996 --> 00:53:11,437
Come on.

1239
00:53:23,436 --> 00:53:25,356
[Indistinct chatter]

1240
00:53:28,236 --> 00:53:29,196
Good to see you, gents.

1241
00:53:29,677 --> 00:53:31,116
That's my new guy.
He works on my squad.

1242
00:53:31,116 --> 00:53:33,517

1243
00:53:33,517 --> 00:53:34,477
You ever need to talk
to the feds,

1244
00:53:34,956 --> 00:53:35,916
You talk to him first.
This is a good man.

1245
00:53:36,397 --> 00:53:37,357
He can take
your back for you.

1246
00:53:37,357 --> 00:53:38,317
Pleased
to meet you, sir.

1247
00:53:38,796 --> 00:53:39,277
Stan gursky over here--

1248
00:53:39,756 --> 00:53:41,197
He runs
the d.A. Shooting team.

1249
00:53:41,197 --> 00:53:43,596
You think about him
before you pull the trigger,

1250
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:45,037
Because if you're wrong,

1251
00:53:45,037 --> 00:53:46,957
He'll snatch your fuckin'
nuts out, use 'em for dice.

1252
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:48,396
[All laughing]

1253
00:53:48,877 --> 00:53:50,797
Detective

1256
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,156
You know,
if you lose a picasso,

1257
00:53:54,156 --> 00:53:55,597
He'll find it for you
or die tryin'.

1258
00:53:55,597 --> 00:53:56,557
He's a good man.

1259
00:53:56,557 --> 00:53:57,996
Pleased to meet you.

1260
00:53:57,996 --> 00:53:59,437
Good man.

1261
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:00,396
Should i--

1262
00:54:00,876 --> 00:54:01,836
Boom. Shoo.

1263
00:54:01,836 --> 00:54:03,756
Get yourself a baseball
steak or something.

1264
00:54:05,197 --> 00:54:06,636
All right, gents.

1265
00:54:06,636 --> 00:54:09,037
Lou: I don't know why
I'm meeting you.

1266
00:54:09,516 --> 00:54:11,436
I don't talk
to dead men.

1267
00:54:11,436 --> 00:54:13,836
I ain't dead yet.

1268
00:54:13,836 --> 00:54:15,276
Fuckin' prick.

1269
00:54:15,276 --> 00:54:16,236
Excuse me.

1270
00:54:18,637 --> 00:54:20,076
Why the long face,
doug, huh?

1271
00:54:20,076 --> 00:54:21,996
Feds seize your house
or somethin'?

1272
00:54:21,996 --> 00:54:24,396
Fuck yourself,
alonzo.

1273
00:54:24,396 --> 00:54:27,277
Lou: tell him the story.

1274
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:28,237
Come on,
tell the story.

1275
00:54:28,716 --> 00:54:30,156
Oh, you think it's
so funny, you tell it.

1276
00:54:30,156 --> 00:54:32,076
No, no. It's your story.
You tell it.

1277
00:54:32,556 --> 00:54:33,516
[Stan laughs]

1278
00:54:33,516 --> 00:54:35,436
Asshole.

1279
00:54:36,877 --> 00:54:38,797
Doug: all right,
all right, all right.

1280
00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:41,677
There's this...
serial burglar, and, uh,

1281
00:54:42,156 --> 00:54:43,596
Chasin' him
for 12 months.

1282
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:45,517
A real slickster,
gave up nothing.

1283
00:54:45,517 --> 00:54:47,437
Captain's riding my ass
the entire time.

1284
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:49,357
Sentencing was today.

1285
00:54:49,836 --> 00:54:50,796
Lou: judge is female.

1286
00:54:50,796 --> 00:54:52,716
That's right.
Landers.

1287
00:54:52,716 --> 00:54:55,596
Yeah, I know landers.
She's a sharp lady.

1288
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:57,516
[All laughing]

1289
00:54:57,997 --> 00:54:59,436
No?

1290
00:54:59,436 --> 00:55:00,396
Doug: so before
the hearing,

1291
00:55:00,876 --> 00:55:02,796
Guy gets hold of
some peanut butter,

1292
00:55:02,796 --> 00:55:04,236
Packs his ass crack
with it...

1293
00:55:04,236 --> 00:55:05,196
What?

1294
00:55:05,196 --> 00:55:07,597
Then he's standing tall
before the bench,

1295
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:09,036
And he's waitin'
to give his statement.

1296
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:10,956
So he shoves
his hand down his pants,

1297
00:55:10,956 --> 00:55:13,356
Comes out with a gob
of extra-Chunky jif.

1298
00:55:13,356 --> 00:55:15,277
[All laughing]

1299
00:55:15,756 --> 00:55:18,156
Bailiffs won't
come near him.

1300
00:55:18,156 --> 00:55:19,596
[All laughing]

1301
00:55:22,476 --> 00:55:25,837
Now he's--Now he's lookin'
the judge right in the eyes

1302
00:55:25,837 --> 00:55:27,757
And licks his fingers clean.

1303
00:55:30,156 --> 00:55:31,596
Holy shit.

1304
00:55:31,596 --> 00:55:33,996
So the judge says, uh,

1305
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:36,876
"Oh, this poor man's insane.
He can't go to prison."

1306
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:38,317
Orders him to psychiatric.

1307
00:55:38,317 --> 00:55:39,277
She fell for it.

1308
00:55:39,277 --> 00:55:42,156
Yeah. That's because
she's so fuckin' smart.

1309
00:55:42,156 --> 00:55:44,076
Time she found out
it was sandwich spread,

1310
00:55:44,076 --> 00:55:46,476
The order was signed,
the guy's been transferred.

1311
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:47,916
[All laughing]

1312
00:55:52,236 --> 00:55:53,196
Proceedings closed.

1313
00:55:53,196 --> 00:55:54,636
Yeah, closed.

1314
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:58,477
That prick will do 6 months
in the puzzle factory,

1315
00:55:58,477 --> 00:56:00,396
Then they'll call him normal
and let him loose.

1316
00:56:00,396 --> 00:56:01,836
Never, ever do
a day in prison.

1317
00:56:01,836 --> 00:56:03,276
Yeah, give him
credit, though.

1318
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,236
Shit, he worked
the system,

1319
00:56:04,716 --> 00:56:06,156
Deserves
his freedom.

1320
00:56:06,156 --> 00:56:08,076
Yeah? Think so?

1321
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:09,997
Or not.

1322
00:56:11,436 --> 00:56:12,396
I'll tell you what.

1323
00:56:12,396 --> 00:56:16,236
I'm gonna find
this guy on the street...

1324
00:56:16,236 --> 00:56:17,677
And I'm gonna do him.

1325
00:56:21,996 --> 00:56:24,876
You better take his
bullets from him, stan.

1326
00:56:25,836 --> 00:56:26,796
Shit.

1327
00:56:26,796 --> 00:56:28,237
Doug: ahh...

1328
00:56:28,237 --> 00:56:30,636
Alonzo...

1329
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:32,556
Heard you had an expensive
weekend in vegas.

1330
00:56:33,996 --> 00:56:36,876
How did you ever
screw up so bad?

1331
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:38,796
Nothin'. It's nothin'.
Forget it.

1332
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:40,236
You know, I didn't know.
It's not my town.

1333
00:56:40,236 --> 00:56:41,196
I'm not omniscient.

1334
00:56:41,196 --> 00:56:43,596
Lou: the russians don't
care if you have a badge.

1335
00:56:43,596 --> 00:56:45,517
They'll whack you.

1336
00:56:45,517 --> 00:56:46,956
You ought to hop
a jet out of here.

1337
00:56:46,956 --> 00:56:48,876
Why?

1338
00:56:48,876 --> 00:56:49,836
It's an easy fix.

1339
00:56:49,836 --> 00:56:50,796
How?

1340
00:56:50,796 --> 00:56:52,716
I'll just cash
in an account.

1341
00:56:52,716 --> 00:56:53,676
Stan: oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1342
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,116
Whose?

1343
00:56:55,116 --> 00:56:56,556
One of my old ones.
My first one.

1344
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,436
It's not a problem.
Look, the guy's

1345
00:56:59,436 --> 00:57:00,396
A high-Security risk
anyway.

1346
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:01,836
If I'm not around,
who's gonna keep him

1347
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:03,276
Off the radar, you?

1348
00:57:03,276 --> 00:57:06,156
I'm just taxin' him,
that's all.

1349
00:57:07,116 --> 00:57:08,076
Ok?

1350
00:57:14,075 --> 00:57:15,515
[Sighs]

1351
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,435
Well, it's your call.

1352
00:57:17,915 --> 00:57:19,835
I do not want you
to dick this up.

1353
00:57:19,835 --> 00:57:22,235
I do not want to see you
on the front page

1354
00:57:22,235 --> 00:57:24,155
Like those other assholes.

1355
00:57:24,155 --> 00:57:26,075
Yeah, I understand.

1356
00:57:28,475 --> 00:57:29,435
Who's drivin'?

1357
00:57:29,435 --> 00:57:30,875
Uh, me.

1358
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:31,835
Grey mercedes.

1359
00:57:31,835 --> 00:57:33,195
Ok.

1360
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:35,115
Get the car.

1361
00:57:35,115 --> 00:57:37,515
All right. All right.

1362
00:57:37,515 --> 00:57:39,915
Uh, what, the black
monte carlo there

1363
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,835
With the back windows
shot out.

1364
00:57:55,755 --> 00:57:56,235
Alonzo:
hey, yeah, it's me.

1365
00:57:56,715 --> 00:57:57,675
Listen, we got
the green light.

1366
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:59,595
Right. That's right.

1367
00:57:59,595 --> 00:58:01,035
I want you to fax
a copy of the warrant

1368
00:58:01,035 --> 00:58:02,475
To the clerk,
get her to get the judge

1369
00:58:02,475 --> 00:58:04,395
To sign it,
and I want you and paul

1370
00:58:04,395 --> 00:58:05,835
To bring it to me
at location one.

1371
00:58:05,835 --> 00:58:07,275
You got that? Now,
get a hold of jeff,

1372
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:08,715
Tell him to pick up
some tools--

1373
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:10,155
Picks and shovels.

1374
00:58:10,155 --> 00:58:12,555
Make sure he signs 'em
out from maintenance.

1375
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,475
That's right. Copy?

1376
00:58:14,955 --> 00:58:15,915
That's right.
All right, hurry up.

1377
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:17,355
Later.

1378
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,675
So how much cash
was in that jacket?

1379
00:58:21,675 --> 00:58:23,594
40 gs.

1380
00:58:23,594 --> 00:58:25,035
What's--
What's that for?

1381
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:25,995
[Laughs]

1382
00:58:26,474 --> 00:58:26,955
You really want to know?

1383
00:58:27,435 --> 00:58:28,875
Yeah, I really
want to know.

1384
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:29,835
Yeah...

1385
00:58:29,835 --> 00:58:31,755
There's nothin' free
in this world, jake.

1386
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:34,155
Not even
arrest warrants.

1387
00:58:35,114 --> 00:58:37,515
Shit, man.
I didn't want to know.

1388
00:58:48,075 --> 00:58:49,995
Yo, homes. Check
this motherfucker out.

1389
00:58:49,995 --> 00:58:50,955
Nice suit, mark.

1390
00:58:50,955 --> 00:58:51,915
Tim: beautiful suit.

1391
00:58:51,915 --> 00:58:53,835
Mark: yeah,
fuck you guys.

1392
00:59:10,635 --> 00:59:12,554
All right.
Nice, nice, nice.

1393
00:59:12,554 --> 00:59:14,955
What's up, alonzo?

1394
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:15,915
You got the picks
and shovels?

1395
00:59:16,395 --> 00:59:17,355
They're in the truck.

1396
00:59:17,355 --> 00:59:18,795
You're gonna
dig a ditch?

1397
00:59:20,715 --> 00:59:22,155
No, you are.

1398
00:59:22,155 --> 00:59:23,595
That's a nice suit
you got on there.

1399
00:59:23,595 --> 00:59:24,555
Jeff: that's
what I said.

1400
00:59:24,555 --> 00:59:25,994
[Laughs]

1401
00:59:26,475 --> 00:59:26,955
What up, killer?

1402
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:28,395
I can't call it.
What's up with you?

1403
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:30,315
I've been hearing
a lot of shit

1404
00:59:30,315 --> 00:59:31,755
Out here on these streets,
man. You all right?

1405
00:59:31,755 --> 00:59:33,195
It's all good. I talked
to the 3 wise men.

1406
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,155
Everything is lovely.

1407
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:35,115
Shit, if you say
we can get away with it,

1408
00:59:35,594 --> 00:59:37,515
I'm with you.
Know what I'm sayin'?

1409
00:59:39,435 --> 00:59:39,915

01:07:20,715 --> 01:07:21,675
All right.

1588
01:07:22,154 --> 01:07:23,114
Ok.

1589
01:07:23,114 --> 01:07:25,514
[Breathing deeply]

1590
01:07:25,514 --> 01:07:26,954
All right, you ready?

1591
01:07:26,954 --> 01:07:28,874
Kiss me, baby.
One--

1592
01:07:28,874 --> 01:07:29,834
Oh!

1593
01:07:29,834 --> 01:07:31,754
Alonzo: yeah?

1594
01:07:31,754 --> 01:07:32,714
You all right?

1595
01:07:32,714 --> 01:07:33,674
Yeah.

1596
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:36,075
I got to give you
one more, though.

1597
01:07:36,075 --> 01:07:37,035
Do it.

1598
01:07:37,035 --> 01:07:39,434
Ah, fuck!

1599
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:41,834
All right, listen.
It's not what you know,

1600
01:07:41,834 --> 01:07:43,754
It's what you can prove.
Ok, here's the scenario.

1601
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:45,674
Mark and paul,
you kicked the door.

1602
01:07:46,154 --> 01:07:47,594
Jeff's
the first one through.

1603
01:07:47,594 --> 01:07:49,994
Roger opens fire--
Hits jeff twice, right?

1604
01:07:49,994 --> 01:07:50,954
Fuck.

1605
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:53,834
What's the matter,
one go through?

1606
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:55,275
Shit!

1607
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:56,714
Yeah, man.
You shot him.

1608
01:07:56,714 --> 01:07:57,674
You fuckin'
shot me, man!

1609
01:07:57,674 --> 01:07:58,634
All right, all right.

1610
01:07:58,634 --> 01:07:59,594
You'll get a medal.
Don't worry about it.

1611
01:07:59,594 --> 01:08:01,034
Get me an ambulance!

1612
01:08:01,034 --> 01:08:01,994
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1613
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:03,914
You want to go to jail
or you want to go home?

1614
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:05,354
All right, here's
the scenario, all right?

1615
01:08:05,354 --> 01:08:06,314
Let me quarterback
this thing.

1616
01:08:06,314 --> 01:08:08,234
Mark, paul,
you kicked the door in.

1617
01:08:08,714 --> 01:08:09,674
Jeff's
the first one through.

1618
01:08:09,674 --> 01:08:11,114
Roger opens fire--
Bang, bang.

1619
01:08:11,114 --> 01:08:12,074
Hits jeff twice.

1620
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:13,515
Our new guy, hoyt,

1621
01:08:13,515 --> 01:08:14,954
He's in second,

1622
01:08:14,954 --> 01:08:16,874
Drops roger with
some fine shotgun work.

1623
01:08:16,874 --> 01:08:17,834
Who shot roger?

1624
01:08:17,834 --> 01:08:19,274
New guy--
Came in spraying.

1625
01:08:19,274 --> 01:08:20,234
Paul?
Boot shot him.

1626
01:08:20,234 --> 01:08:21,194
What did
you guys see?

1627
01:08:21,194 --> 01:08:22,154
Hoyt blasted him.

1628
01:08:22,154 --> 01:08:24,074
Yeah, fuck hoyt, ok?
Ambulance time.

1629
01:08:24,074 --> 01:08:26,474
Done.
Paul, call 'em up.

1630
01:08:26,474 --> 01:08:29,834
11-49-9-9-8.
Shots fired.

1631
01:08:29,834 --> 01:08:32,234
Officer down.
Repeat, officer down.

1632
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:34,635
5951 baxter street.

1633
01:08:35,114 --> 01:08:36,555
Congratulations, son.

1634
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:38,954
You're gonna get a medal
of valor for this.

1635
01:08:38,954 --> 01:08:40,395
I didn't shoot him.

1636
01:08:40,395 --> 01:08:42,314
A roomful of cops
said you did.

1637
01:08:42,314 --> 01:08:43,754
But I didn't.

1638
01:08:43,754 --> 01:08:44,714
You did.

1639
01:08:47,594 --> 01:08:49,514
A los angeles
police department

1640
01:08:49,514 --> 01:08:52,875
Narcotics officer
was killed today

1641
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:55,274
Serving a high-Risk
warrant in echo park.

1642
01:08:55,754 --> 01:08:57,674
Give me the bitch.

1643
01:08:57,674 --> 01:08:59,594
[Cocks]

1644
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,994
L.A.P.D. Spokesperson

1645
01:09:01,994 --> 01:09:03,435
Said the officer

1646
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:05,834
Is survived...

1647
01:09:05,834 --> 01:09:07,274
By his wife
and infant child.

1648
01:09:07,754 --> 01:09:09,194
Shit gets deeper.

1649
01:09:09,194 --> 01:09:10,154
You get the picture?

1650
01:09:10,154 --> 01:09:12,075
Yeah, I got the picture.

1651
01:09:12,075 --> 01:09:13,035
Hey, hey, hey!

1652
01:09:13,035 --> 01:09:14,474
That is the second time
you pointed a gun at me!

1653
01:09:14,474 --> 01:09:15,915
There will not
be a third.

1654
01:09:15,915 --> 01:09:17,354
God damn, boy!

1655
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:18,794
That's what I'm
talkin' about, jake.

1656
01:09:19,274 --> 01:09:21,674
My niggah. Are you all
watchin' this? That's it.

1657
01:09:21,674 --> 01:09:24,074
It'd be my pleasure to put
a hydrashock in that melon.

1658
01:09:24,074 --> 01:09:25,034
Hey, hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1659
01:09:25,034 --> 01:09:26,474
Paul: no, but I'm
gonna be cool.

1660
01:09:26,474 --> 01:09:27,914
Now drop
the fuckin' gun now!

1661
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:28,874
You want to shoot me,
paul, go ahead,

1662
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:30,314
But I'm takin'
him with me.

1663
01:09:30,314 --> 01:09:31,274
I'm goin',
alonzo.

1664
01:09:31,274 --> 01:09:32,714
This motherfucker's
a fed, man.

1665
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:34,155
No, he ain't no fed.
He's just a choir boy

1666
01:09:34,155 --> 01:09:36,554
With a heart that got
the drop on all you fools.

1667
01:09:36,554 --> 01:09:39,434
Listen, everybody just
take a deep breath,

1668
01:09:39,434 --> 01:09:41,354
And just diffuse this thing.
You hear me, jake?

1669
01:09:41,354 --> 01:09:42,314
You can't pull
this shit on me, man.

1670
01:09:42,314 --> 01:09:44,234
I didn't
sign up for this.

1671
01:09:44,234 --> 01:09:45,194
Ok, ok.
I know you're angry.

1672
01:09:45,194 --> 01:09:47,594
Everybody,
just put your guns down.

1673
01:09:48,074 --> 01:09:48,554
Hell, no.

1674
01:09:49,034 --> 01:09:49,514
Mark: no, no, no, no...

1675
01:09:49,994 --> 01:09:50,954
Choir boy first.

1676
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:52,395
Hey, listen to me.
Put the guns down!

1677
01:09:52,395 --> 01:09:54,314
That's an order.
Put 'em down!

1678
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,194
[Praying]

1679
01:10:02,474 --> 01:10:04,394
Use your ears
and you hear me, jake.

1680
01:10:04,394 --> 01:10:06,314
Sometime we gotta take
this shit all the way.

1681
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:07,754
It's not like we do this
every day, all right?

1682
01:10:07,754 --> 01:10:10,154
It's just the nature
of the business.

1683
01:10:10,154 --> 01:10:12,074
Now, no one will
ever ask you again

1684
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:14,475
To pull the trigger if you
don't want to, all right?

1685
01:10:15,435 --> 01:10:16,874
Hey, mark, where are
you transferring to?

1686
01:10:17,354 --> 01:10:17,834
S.I.S.

1687
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,234
S.I.S.
Detective.

1688
01:10:20,234 --> 01:10:22,154
You give me 18 months,

1689
01:10:22,154 --> 01:10:24,554
I give you a career.

1690
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:25,994
We make the big
seizures, jake.

1691
01:10:25,994 --> 01:10:26,954
We make
the big arrests.

1692
01:10:27,434 --> 01:10:28,394
But if you're
in my unit,

1693
01:10:28,394 --> 01:10:29,354
You gotta be in it
all the way

1694
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:31,273
Or not at all,
you understand me?

1695
01:10:31,754 --> 01:10:32,714
I mean, I thought
you were man enough

1696
01:10:32,714 --> 01:10:34,634
To handle this shit.
I guess I was wrong.

1697
01:10:34,634 --> 01:10:36,554
5 proven,
decorated officers

1698
01:10:36,554 --> 01:10:38,475
Says that you're
the shooter, ok?

1699
01:10:38,954 --> 01:10:40,395
The investigators
are gonna want to pull

1700
01:10:40,395 --> 01:10:42,794
A tube of your blood
to check for intoxicants.

1701
01:10:42,794 --> 01:10:44,714
What are they gonna find,
jake? Do the math.

1702
01:10:44,714 --> 01:10:47,114
You been smokin' p.C.P.
All day, haven't you?

1703
01:10:47,594 --> 01:10:48,554
Huh? Remember?

1704
01:10:48,554 --> 01:10:49,514
You've been
plannin' this all day.

1705
01:10:49,514 --> 01:10:51,915
I've been plannin' it
all week, son.

1706
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,314
You talk that crazy shit,
I'll make sure your blood

1707
01:10:54,794 --> 01:10:55,754
Gets to the lab.

1708
01:10:56,234 --> 01:10:57,674
You want to walk your little
baby nuts around the block,

1709
01:10:57,674 --> 01:10:59,114
You won't make it
to the corner,

1710
01:10:59,114 --> 01:11:01,514
But if you're cool--
Ifyou're cool--

1711
01:11:01,514 --> 01:11:02,954
You're a hero.

1712
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:05,354
You're a virgin shooter
above suspicion.

1713
01:11:05,354 --> 01:11:06,314
Paul: alonzo,
there's 2 shots left

1714
01:11:06,314 --> 01:11:07,274
In that other stinger.

1715
01:11:07,274 --> 01:11:09,674
We need to just kill
your boy right now,

1716
01:11:09,674 --> 01:11:11,594
And say roger got him
comin' through the door.

1717
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,434
No, we ain't
killin' nobody.

1718
01:11:15,434 --> 01:11:16,875
This is a good man
right here.

1719
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,794
He's got the magic eye.
I can feel it.

1720
01:11:18,794 --> 01:11:20,714
Just had a little
freak out, that's all.

1721
01:11:20,714 --> 01:11:22,634
We all been there.

1722
01:11:22,634 --> 01:11:25,034
No, I say he's cool.

1723
01:11:25,034 --> 01:11:27,914
And I say nobody's
gonna hurt him.

1724
01:11:27,914 --> 01:11:30,314
But you do have
a decision to make, jake.

1725
01:11:30,314 --> 01:11:31,274
'Cause in about
10 seconds,

1726
01:11:31,753 --> 01:11:34,634
This place is gonna be
overrun with blue suits.

1727
01:11:34,634 --> 01:11:37,034
So why don't you
please go outside,

1728
01:11:37,034 --> 01:11:39,914
Clear your head...

1729
01:11:39,914 --> 01:11:42,314
Or shoot me.

1730
01:11:48,074 --> 01:11:49,994
[Sighs]

1731
01:11:51,914 --> 01:11:54,314
[Sirens approaching]

1732
01:11:55,274 --> 01:11:56,234
Jake: hey, paul.

1733
01:12:01,034 --> 01:12:02,474
You're dead,
motherfucker!

1734
01:12:02,954 --> 01:12:04,394
You hear me?
You're fuckin' dead!

1735
01:13:12,682 --> 01:13:15,082
Yeah. [Laughs]

1736
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:20,841
Ha, that's right.
Well, lay off that rice.

1737
01:13:20,841 --> 01:13:22,282
All right.

1738
01:13:24,203 --> 01:13:27,083
Yeah, just make sure that
bathtub is clean, homey.

1739
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:29,002
All right?

1740
01:13:31,402 --> 01:13:33,322
All right. Later.

1741
01:13:37,642 --> 01:13:38,602
You all right?

1742
01:13:45,322 --> 01:13:46,762
It behooves you
not to dick around

1743
01:13:46,762 --> 01:13:49,162
On this one.

1744
01:13:49,162 --> 01:13:52,521
Justifiable homicide
in the line of duty, ok?

1745
01:13:52,521 --> 01:13:53,481
Now what happened--

1746
01:13:53,481 --> 01:13:55,402
What happened was murder...

1747
01:13:55,402 --> 01:13:56,362
And armed robbery.

1748
01:13:57,802 --> 01:14:00,202
Oh, wait. We--We had badges,
so it's different?

1749
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:03,082
Oh, son, open your eyes.
Can't you see? Huh?

1750
01:14:03,082 --> 01:14:05,002
That man was your friend,

1751
01:14:05,002 --> 01:14:06,922
And you killed him
like a fly.

1752
01:14:06,922 --> 01:14:07,882
[Laughs] come on.
My friend, huh?

1753
01:14:07,882 --> 01:14:08,842
Yeah.
Tell me why.

1754
01:14:08,842 --> 01:14:12,682
Because he knows
my first name?

1755
01:14:12,682 --> 01:14:14,602
Son, this is the game.
I'm playin' his ass.

1756
01:14:14,602 --> 01:14:17,962
That's my job.
That's your job.

1757
01:14:17,962 --> 01:14:20,361
Roger sold dope to kids.

1758
01:14:20,361 --> 01:14:22,762
The world is a better
place without him.

1759
01:14:23,241 --> 01:14:27,082
Hey, this man was
the biggest major violator

1760
01:14:27,082 --> 01:14:29,002
In los angeles.

1761
01:14:29,002 --> 01:14:30,922
I watched that cocksucker
operate with impunity

1762
01:14:30,922 --> 01:14:33,322
For over 10 years,
and now I got him.

1763
01:14:33,322 --> 01:14:35,242
This shit's chess.
It ain't checkers.

1764
01:14:42,922 --> 01:14:43,882
What you think we gonna do?

1765
01:14:43,882 --> 01:14:46,282
We gonna--We gonna roll up
in a black-And-White, huh?

1766
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:49,162
Slap the cuffs on him.
"You're under arrest."

1767
01:14:49,162 --> 01:14:51,082
That's a high roller, dog.

1768
01:14:53,961 --> 01:14:55,402
Take the money.

1769
01:14:55,402 --> 01:14:56,841
Hey, man, I already told you,
I'm not gonna take that.

1770
01:14:56,841 --> 01:14:57,802
I'mnotgonna take that.

1771
01:14:57,802 --> 01:14:59,722
Ok, don't. Just burn it,
barbecue it,

1772
01:14:59,722 --> 01:15:00,682
Fish fry it.
I don't give a fuck,

1773
01:15:01,162 --> 01:15:02,602
But the boys'll
feel better about it.

1774
01:15:02,602 --> 01:15:03,562
Fucktheir feelings.

1775
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:05,482
Jake, you're
not makin' 'em feel

1776
01:15:05,482 --> 01:15:06,922
Like you're
part of the team.

1777
01:15:06,922 --> 01:15:08,362
The team?

1778
01:15:08,362 --> 01:15:10,282
You guys are fuckin' insane.

1779
01:15:10,282 --> 01:15:12,682
All right.
I'll go back to the valley.

1780
01:15:12,682 --> 01:15:15,562
I'll cut parking tickets,
you know?

1781
01:15:15,562 --> 01:15:17,001
God.

1782
01:15:18,921 --> 01:15:20,841
It--It can't be like this.

1783
01:15:20,841 --> 01:15:21,801
It is this way, man.

1784
01:15:21,801 --> 01:15:23,721
I'm sorry I exposed you
to it, but it is.

1785
01:15:23,721 --> 01:15:26,602
It's ugly,
but it's necessary.

1786
01:15:26,602 --> 01:15:29,002
I became a cop
to put away drug dealers,

1787
01:15:29,002 --> 01:15:31,402
The poisoners, the criminals,
not to be one.

1788
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:33,322
You sound just like me,

1789
01:15:33,802 --> 01:15:34,762
And I know what
you're going through.

1790
01:15:34,762 --> 01:15:36,202
I know what
you're feeling.

1791
01:15:36,202 --> 01:15:37,162
You're scared.

1792
01:15:37,162 --> 01:15:38,122
I'm not scared.

1793
01:15:38,122 --> 01:15:39,082
Yes, you are.
You're terrified.

1794
01:15:39,562 --> 01:15:41,001
Everybody goes through
that the first time.

1795
01:15:41,001 --> 01:15:42,442
I went through it.

1796
01:15:42,442 --> 01:15:47,242
The sooner you can match
what's in your head

1797
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:49,642
With what's goin' on
in the real world,

1798
01:15:49,642 --> 01:15:52,521
The better
you're gonna feel.

1799
01:15:52,521 --> 01:15:54,441
In this business,

1800
01:15:54,441 --> 01:15:56,361
You gotta have
a little dirt on you

1801
01:15:56,361 --> 01:15:58,281
For anybody
to trust you,

1802
01:15:58,281 --> 01:16:01,161
And when all this
is behind you,

1803
01:16:01,161 --> 01:16:02,122
There's gonna be
a whole other world

1804
01:16:02,602 --> 01:16:05,002
That opens up for you.

1805
01:16:05,002 --> 01:16:07,882
I walk a higher path, son.

1806
01:16:07,882 --> 01:16:10,762
I can give you the keys
to all the doors.

1807
01:16:11,242 --> 01:16:13,642
What are you talking about?

1808
01:16:14,122 --> 01:16:17,002
My guys are pretty good,
but they're not leaders.

1809
01:16:17,002 --> 01:16:17,962
They're clowns.
You're a leader.

1810
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:19,882
You want my job?
You got it.

1811
01:16:19,882 --> 01:16:21,321
You want to lock up
poisoners?

1812
01:16:21,802 --> 01:16:23,241
This is the best place
to do it.

1813
01:16:25,642 --> 01:16:28,041
But you gotta just,
you know, take your time.

1814
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:29,961
You make detective.
You play the game.

1815
01:16:29,961 --> 01:16:33,801
You grow wise, and then
you can change things,

1816
01:16:34,282 --> 01:16:37,162
But you gotta change 'em
from the inside, son.

1817
01:16:39,562 --> 01:16:41,962
Let's go downtown
to the station.

1818
01:16:41,962 --> 01:16:44,362
You talk to my guy stan,

1819
01:16:44,362 --> 01:16:45,802
And he'll walk you through

1820
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:48,682
What you gotta say
to the d.A. Guys, ok?

1821
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,801
Alonzo: ok.

1822
01:17:36,554 --> 01:17:38,474
What the hell we doin' now?

1823
01:17:38,474 --> 01:17:39,914
An informant of mine's
up in chino.

1824
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:42,794
I promised I'd take care
of his family for him.

1825
01:17:46,634 --> 01:17:48,554
I bring 'em some food,
you know, stuff like that.

1826
01:17:49,033 --> 01:17:51,434
Got to help out the family.

1827
01:17:52,394 --> 01:17:53,354
Believe it or not,

1828
01:17:53,354 --> 01:17:56,234
I do try to do some
good in the community.

1829
01:17:56,713 --> 01:17:57,673
It was, like,
right there, right?

1830
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,593
Just right there.

1831
01:18:00,074 --> 01:18:00,553
What's up, dog?

1832
01:18:01,034 --> 01:18:01,994
You know where
you're at, fool?

1833
01:18:07,273 --> 01:18:09,193
What the fuck
you lookin' at?

1834
01:18:11,594 --> 01:18:13,514
All right.

1835
01:18:17,354 --> 01:18:19,274
What's up, punk?

1836
01:18:44,234 --> 01:18:45,673
Alonzo: hey, we got some
things for the family.

1837
01:18:59,594 --> 01:19:01,993
Kitchen's this way.

1838
01:19:01,993 --> 01:19:02,953
Woman on tv:
we're on every day.

1839
01:19:02,953 --> 01:19:03,913
2nd woman on tv:
every day?

1840
01:19:03,913 --> 01:19:05,833
Ok, tell us a little bit
about that touring thing

1841
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:08,713
With divas of dance 2000.
That sounds exciting.

1842
01:19:08,713 --> 01:19:09,673
Smiley: put the shit
on the counter.

1843
01:19:09,673 --> 01:19:11,114
Alonzo: where's the head?

1844
01:19:11,593 --> 01:19:12,554
Smiley: right through.

1845
01:19:17,354 --> 01:19:18,313
2nd woman:
so you're happy?

1846
01:19:18,313 --> 01:19:19,273
Woman: oh, yes!
[Laughs]

1847
01:19:19,754 --> 01:19:20,714
Now for example...

1848
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:22,153
I'm gonna go
to the head, ok?

1849
01:19:22,153 --> 01:19:24,073
I'm gonna be 2 seconds.
We rollin'.

1850
01:19:25,033 --> 01:19:26,474
Hey, that's nice, homes.

1851
01:19:26,953 --> 01:19:28,394
Let me
get the cd player, eh?

1852
01:19:28,394 --> 01:19:30,793
You get the blender.
Cd player's mine.

1853
01:19:30,793 --> 01:19:34,633
Dreamer, get
your ass in here!

1854
01:19:34,633 --> 01:19:37,513
Count that shit
in the bedroom, huh?

1855
01:19:37,513 --> 01:19:40,394
Thanks a lot, eh. I was
doing stuff, you know?

1856
01:19:40,394 --> 01:19:43,273
Better learn how to count,
fuckin' math whiz.

1857
01:19:43,273 --> 01:19:44,233
[Moreno and
sniper's laughter]

1858
01:19:44,233 --> 01:19:45,674
Moreno: yeah.

1859
01:19:46,153 --> 01:19:47,113
You looked at 'em.

1860
01:19:47,113 --> 01:19:48,073
No, I didn't. Now what?

1861
01:19:48,554 --> 01:19:50,474
You callin' me a fuckin'
cheater,ese,or what?

1862
01:19:50,474 --> 01:19:52,394
Deal again, huh, sniper.

1863
01:19:52,394 --> 01:19:53,354
Dama.

1864
01:19:55,274 --> 01:19:56,713
You play cards, cop?

1865
01:19:57,194 --> 01:19:59,114
Uh, nah, not really.

1866
01:19:59,114 --> 01:20:00,074
Hey, you want a beer, homes?

1867
01:20:00,553 --> 01:20:01,994
Somethin' to drink?
Have a cold one.

1868
01:20:01,994 --> 01:20:03,914
Eh, no, thanks.
I'm good.

1869
01:20:03,914 --> 01:20:06,313
Sniper: come on,
sit down, eh,

1870
01:20:06,313 --> 01:20:08,233
Play a card game
with us.

1871
01:20:08,233 --> 01:20:09,673
Moreno:
don't be rude,ese.

1872
01:20:09,673 --> 01:20:11,113
You're the invited guest.

1873
01:20:11,113 --> 01:20:12,074
Why don't you sit down
and play one hand?

1874
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:13,034
There you go.

1875
01:20:13,514 --> 01:20:14,474
Don't sweat it,judo.

1876
01:20:14,474 --> 01:20:15,914
We ain't
playin' for money.

1877
01:20:15,914 --> 01:20:18,314
Nah. It's just we
gotta roll in a second.

1878
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:21,673
Alonzo's takin' a shit.
Go ahead. Take a seat.

1879
01:20:22,154 --> 01:20:26,473
All right,
I'll play one hand.

1880
01:20:26,473 --> 01:20:28,874
What do you guys got
going on here, 5 card draw?

1881
01:20:28,874 --> 01:20:30,793
Sniper: yeah,
jokers are wild.

1882
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:32,233
Jokers wild.

1883
01:20:32,233 --> 01:20:35,113
Hey, so, um, why don't you
tell us somethin', homes.

1884
01:20:35,113 --> 01:20:37,033
How long you been a pig?

1885
01:20:38,474 --> 01:20:39,913
I'm--My bad, my bad.

1886
01:20:39,913 --> 01:20:42,793
I meant--I meant--
I meant a police officer.

1887
01:20:42,793 --> 01:20:43,753
That's what I meant.

1888
01:20:43,753 --> 01:20:45,194
I been a pig
for 19 months.

1889
01:20:45,194 --> 01:20:46,154
Is that right?

1890
01:20:46,154 --> 01:20:47,114
That's right.

1891
01:20:47,114 --> 01:20:48,074
And you like it or what?

1892
01:20:48,074 --> 01:20:49,034
I should've been
a fireman.

1893
01:20:49,034 --> 01:20:50,954
I need one more.

1894
01:20:51,433 --> 01:20:52,874
[Sniper grunts]

1895
01:20:53,834 --> 01:20:55,273
What you got, dog?

1896
01:20:55,273 --> 01:20:56,714
3 of a kind, 3 jacks.

1897
01:20:56,714 --> 01:20:59,113
Ahh,chingo.
Didn't get shit.

1898
01:20:59,594 --> 01:21:01,514
Pujo,baby! Whoo!

You fuckin' dumb truck.

1906
01:21:18,313 --> 01:21:19,273
Serio?

Hey, you're fuckin'

Why don't you

Or somethin', homes.
Seriously, eh.

[Cell phone beeps]
i know I'm number one.

1912

Your gun, homes,
underneath your shirt.

1918

Let him see it.

Jake: no, that's
all right, man.

1920
01:21:37,994 --> 01:21:39,433
Come on, man. What is it,
like, a .380 stainless?

1921
01:21:39,914 --> 01:21:41,353
9 millimeter beretta.
