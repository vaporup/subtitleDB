1
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,554
Men are haunted by the vastness
of eternity.

2
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,672
And so we ask ourselves...

3
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,837
...will our actions echo
across the centuries?

4
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,713
Will strangers hear our names
long after we're gone...

5
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,111
...and wonder who we were...

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,511
...how bravely we fought...

7
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,471
...how fiercely we loved?

8
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,193
Good day for the crows.

9
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,469
Remove your army from my land.

10
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,392
I like your land.

11
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,952
I think we'll stay. I like your soldiers too.

12
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,593
They won't fight for you.

13
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,711
That's what the Messenians said.

14
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,758
And the Arcadians and the Epeians.

15
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,793
Now they all fight for me.

16
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,389
You can't have the whole world,
Agamemnon.

17
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,790
It's too big, even for you.

18
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,508
I don't want to watch another massacre.

19
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,753
Let's settle this war in the old manner.
Your best fighter against my best.

20
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,751
And if my man wins?

21
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,831
We'll leave Thessaly for good.

22
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,111
Boagrius!

23
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,590
Achilles!

24
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,309
Boagrius has this effect on many heroes.

25
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,477
Careful who you insult, old king.

26
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,712
My king, Achilles is not with the army.

27
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,553
- Where is he?
- I sent a boy to look for him.

28
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,316
I was having a good dream.

29
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,753
Very good dream.

30
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,916
King Agamemnon sent me.
He needs to...

31
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,150
I'll speak to your king in the morning.

32
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,231
But my lord, it is morning.

33
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,510
They're waiting for you.

34
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,070
Are the stories about you true?

35
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,513
They say your mother is
an immortal goddess.

36
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,673
They say you can't be killed.

37
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,593
I wouldn't be bothering
with the shield then, would I?

38
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,990
The Thessalonian you're fighting...

39
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,312
...he's the biggest man I've ever seen.
I wouldn't want to fight him.

40
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,034
That's why no one will remember
your name.

41
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,116
Perhaps we should have our war tomorrow,
when you're better rested.

42
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,714
I should have you whipped
for your impudence!

43
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,479
Perhaps you should fight him.

44
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,392
Achilles.

45
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,872
Achilles.

46
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,195
Look at the men's faces.
You can save hundreds of them.

47
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,957
You can end this war
with a swing of your sword.

48
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,316
Let them go home to their wives.

49
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,351
Imagine a king who fights his
own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight.

50
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,156
Of all the warlords loved by the gods,
I hate him the most.

51
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,631
Is there no one else?

52
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,592
Is there no one else?

53
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,958
Who are you, soldier?

54
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,753
Achilles. Son of Peleus.

55
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,914
Achilles?

56
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,392
I'll remember the name.

57
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,751
The ruler of Thessaly carries this scepter.

58
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,754
Give it to your king.

59
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,759
He's not my king.

60
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,514
<b>B</b>rothers in arms!

61
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,796
- Friendship!
- Friendship!

62
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,317
Princes of Troy,
on our last night together...

63
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,877
...Queen Helen and I salute you.

64
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,750
We've had our conflicts before, it's true.

65
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,992
We fought many battles,
Sparta and Troy. And fought well!

66
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,429
But I have always respected your father.

67
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,034
Priam is a good king, a good man.

68
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,079
I respected him as an adversary.
I respect him now as my ally.

69
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,833
Hector, Paris,
young princes, come. Stand.

70
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,594
Drink with me.

71
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,394
Let us drink to peace.

72
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,636
To peace between Troy and Sparta.

73
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,914
May the gods keep the wolves
in the hills and the women in our beds.

74
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,550
- For the gods.
- For the gods.

75
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,998
You shouldn't be here.

76
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,469
That's what you said last night.

77
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,990
Last night was a mistake.

78
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,071
And the night before?

79
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,509
I've made many mistakes this week.

80
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,270
Do you want me to go?

81
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,351
Pearls from the Sea of Propontis.

82
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,078
They're beautiful.

83
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,592
But I can't wear them.

84
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,795
Menelaus would kill us both.

85
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,552
Don't be afraid of him.

86
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,670
I'm not afraid of dying.

87
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,476
I'm afraid of tomorrow.

88
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,593
I'm afraid of watching you sail away
and knowing you'll never come back.

89
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,513
Before you came to Sparta,
I was a ghost.

90
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,317
I walked, and I ate,
and I swam in the sea...

91
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,436
...but I was just a ghost.

92
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,518
You don't have to fear tomorrow.

93
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,592
Come with me.

94
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,148
Don't play with me. Don't play.

95
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,312
If you come, we'll never be safe.

96
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,991
Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us.

97
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,354
But I'll love you.

98
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,471
Till the day they burn my body...

99
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,191
...I will love you.

100
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,359
A beautiful morning.
Poseidon has blessed our voyage.

101
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,794
Sometimes the gods bless you in the
morning and curse you in the afternoon.

102
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,474
Drop sail!

103
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,559
Do you love me, brother?

104
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,070
Would you protect me
against any enemy?

105
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,036
The last time you spoke to me like this...

106
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,397
...you were 10 years old,
and you'd just stolen Father's horse.

107
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,630
What have you done now?

108
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,919
I must show you something.

109
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,754
Where is she?

110
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,193
I swear by the father of the gods,
I will gut you here if you don't tell me!

111
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,078
My king!

112
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,279
She left.

113
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,714
With the Trojans.

114
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,473
The fisherman here saw her
board their ship.

115
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,079
The Trojans?

116
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,916
With the young prince, Paris. She...

117
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,710
Get my ship ready.

118
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,190
Turn us round. Back to Sparta.

119
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,634
High on the sail!

120
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,233
- Wait, wait.
- You fool!

121
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,630
- Listen to me.
- Do you know what you've done?

122
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,076
Do you know how many years our father
worked for peace?

123
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,391
I love her.

124
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,352
It's all a game to you, isn't it?

125
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,149
You roam from town to town,
bedding merchants' wives and temple maids.

126
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,356
You think you know
something about love.

127
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,919
What about your father's love?

128
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,594
You spat on him when you
brought her on this ship!

129
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,628
What about the love for your country?
You'd let Troy burn for this woman?

130
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,270
I won't let you start a war for her.

131
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,873
May I speak?

132
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,913
What you're saying is true. I've wronged you.
I've wronged our father.

133
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,038
If you want to take Helen
back to Sparta, so be it.

134
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,438
But I go with her.

135
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,752
To Sparta? They'll kill you.

136
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,150
Then I'll die fighting.

137
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,756
Oh, and that sounds heroic to you,
doesn't it? To die fighting.

138
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,798
- Tell me, little brother, have you ever killed a man?
- No.

139
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,951
- Ever seen a man die in combat?
- No.

140
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,193
I've killed men, and I've heard them dying.
And I've watched them dying.

141
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,033
And there's nothing glorious about it.
Nothing poetic.

142
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,351
You say you want to die for love.
But you know nothing about dying.

143
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,590
And you know nothing about love!

144
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,558
All the same, I go with her.

145
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,836
I won't ask you to fight my war.

146
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,638
You already have.

147
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,999
To Troy!

148
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,072
About ship! Set sail!

149
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,716
- I want her back.
- Well, of course you do.

150
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,473
She's a beautiful woman.

151
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,076
I want her back so I can kill her
with my own two hands.

152
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,438
I won't rest till I've burned Troy
to the ground.

153
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,636
I thought you wanted peace with Troy.

154
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,597
I should have listened to you.

155
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,910
Peace is for the women...

156
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,231
...and the weak.

157
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,079
Empires are forged by war.

158
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,155
All my life, I've stood by your side,
fought your enemies.

159
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,116
You're the elder, you reap the glory.
This is the way of the world.

160
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,756
But have I ever complained, brother?
Have I ever asked you for anything?

161
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,593
Never. You're a man of honor.

162
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,391
Will you go to war with me, brother?

163
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,275
I always thought my brother's wife
was a foolish woman...

164
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,159
...but she's proved to be very useful.

165
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,870
The Trojans have never been conquered.

166
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,516
Some say they can't be conquered.

167
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,832
Old King Priam thinks he's untouchable
behind his high walls.

168
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,873
He thinks the sun god will protect him.

169
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,594
But the gods protect only...

170
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,192
...the strong!

171
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,070
If Troy falls...

172
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,277
...I control the Aegean.

173
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,034
Hector commands the finest army
in the east.

174
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,510
I'll attack them with the greatest force
the world has ever seen.

175
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,752
I want all the kings of Greece
and their armies.

176
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,758
Send emissaries in the morning.

177
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,558
One last thing.

178
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,917
We need Achilles and his Myrmidons.

179
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,393
Achilles.

180
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,038
He can't be controlled.
He's as likely to fight us as the Trojans.

181
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,476
We don't need to control him,
we need to unleash him.

182
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,469
That man was born to end lives.

183
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,872
Yes, he's a gifted killer.
But he threatens everything I've built.

184
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,838
Before me, Greece was nothing.

185
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,275
I brought all the
Greek kingdoms together.

186
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,189
I created a nation out of fire worshipers
and snake eaters!

187
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,999
I build the future, Nestor. Me!

188
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,076
Achilles is the past.

189
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,392
A man who fights for no flag.
A man loyal to no country.

190
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,950
How many battles have we won
off the edge of his sword?

191
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,237
This will be the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

192
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,709
We need the greatest warrior.

193
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,195
There's only one man he'll listen to.

194
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,953
Never hesitate.

195
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,952
Nervous?

196
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,196
Petrified.

197
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,193
You told me never
to change sword hands.

198
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,998
Yes. When you know how to use it,
you won't be taking my orders.

199
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,595
Your reputation for hospitality
is fast becoming legend.

200
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,117
Patroclus, my cousin.

201
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,517
Odysseus, king of lthaca.

202
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,357
Patroclus. I knew your parents well.

203
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,873
I miss them.

204
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,198
Now you have this one
watching over you, eh?

205
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,749
Learning from Achilles himself.

206
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,431
Kings would kill for the honor.

207
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,114
Are you here at Agamemnon's bidding?

208
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,354
We need to talk.

209
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,712
I will not fight for him.

210
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,840
I'm not asking you to fight for him.

211
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,511
I'm asking you to fight for the Greeks.

212
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,910
Why?
Are the Greeks tired of fighting each other?

213
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,231
- For now.
- The Trojans never harmed me.

214
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,112
They insulted Greece.

215
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,989
They insulted one greek. A man who couldn't hold
on to his wife. What business is that of mine?

216
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,515
Your business is war, my friend.

217
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,636
Is it? The man has no honor.

218
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,031
Let Achilles fight for honor.
Let Agamemnon fight for power.

219
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,158
And let the gods decide
which man to glorify.

220
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,954
- For the Greeks!
- Forget Agamemnon.

221
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,833
Fight for me.

222
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,397
My wife will feel much better
if she knows you're by my side.

223
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,993
I'll feel much better.

224
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,958
We're sending the largest fleet
that ever sailed.

225
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,633
A thousand ships.

226
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,520
Prince Hector.
Is he as good a warrior as they say?

227
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,989
The best of all the Trojans.

228
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,717
Some say he's better
than all the Greeks too.

229
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,791
Even if your cousin doesn't come...

230
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,436
...I hope you'll join us, Patroclus.
We could use a strong arm like yours.

231
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,755
Play your tricks on me,
but not my cousin.

232
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,878
You have your swords. I have my tricks.

233
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,071
We play with the toys the gods give us.

234
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,552
We sail for Troy in three days.

235
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,791
This war will never be forgotten.

236
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,908
Nor will the heroes who fight in it.

237
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,750
I knew they would come for you.

238
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,755
Long before you were born...

239
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,318
...I knew they would come.

240
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,036
They want you to fight in Troy.

241
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,033
I'm making you
another seashell necklace.

242
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,915
Like the ones I made you
when you were a boy.

243
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,479
Do you remember?

244
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,519
Mother...

245
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,112
...tonight, I decide.

246
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,236
If you stay in Lárisa...

247
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,038
...you will find peace.

248
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,031
You will find a wonderful woman.

249
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,351
You will have sons and daughters,
and they will have children.

250
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,637
And they will love you.

251
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,360
When you are gone,
they will remember you.

252
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,668
But when your children are dead
and their children after them...

253
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,751
...your name will be lost.

254
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,714
If you go to Troy...

255
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,910
...glory will be yours.

256
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,837
They will write stories about your
victories for thousands of years.

257
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,518
The world will remember your name.

258
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,356
But if you go to Troy...

259
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,915
...you will never come home.

260
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,829
For your glory walks hand in hand
with your doom.

261
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,315
And I shall never see you again.

262
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,035
- My son.
- Father.

263
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,995
Paris.

264
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,674
Father.

265
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,190
- This is Helen.
- Helen?

266
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,753
Helen of Sparta?

267
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,317
Helen of Troy.

268
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,876
I've heard rumors of your beauty.

269
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,553
For once...

270
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,031
...the gossips were right.

271
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,468
Welcome.

272
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,349
Come, you must be tired.

273
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,118
Look.

274
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,558
He's grown.

275
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,393
He is strong.

276
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,596
- Briseis!
- Paris!

277
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,596
Beloved cousin, your beauty grows
with each new moon.

278
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,231
Briseis.

279
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,392
A servant of Apollo now.

280
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,314
The young men of Troy were devastated
when Briseis chose the virgin robes.

281
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,434
Father...

282
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,068
...I know this is the last thing we need.

283
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,597
It is the will of the gods.
Everything is in their hands.

284
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,398
- But I'm surprised you let him bring her.
- If I'd let him fight Menelaus for her...

285
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,552
...you'd be burning a son's body,
instead of welcoming a daughter.

286
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,188
We could send peace envoys
to Menelaus.

287
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,079
You know Menelaus.
He'd spear their heads to his gate.

288
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,111
What would you have me do?

289
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,518
Put her on a ship and send her home.

290
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,471
Women have always loved Paris,
and he has loved them back.

291
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,198
But this is different.

292
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,590
Something has changed in him.

293
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,435
If we send her home to Menelaus,
he will follow her.

294
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,118
This is my country,
and these are my countrymen.

295
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,670
I don't want to see them suffer
so my brother can have his prize.

296
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,670
It's not just the Spartans
coming after her.

297
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,990
By now, Menelaus has gone
to Agamemnon.

298
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,720
And Agamemnon has wanted
to destroy us for years.

299
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,511
Enemies have been attacking us
for centuries. Our walls still stand.

300
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,073
Father, we can't win this war.

301
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,150
Apollo watches over us.

302
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,757
Even Agamemnon
is no match for the gods.

303
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,559
And how many battalions
does the sun god command?

304
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,119
Do not mock the gods.

305
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,672
They're coming for me.

306
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,792
The wind is bringing them closer.

307
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,552
What if we left?

308
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,790
Tonight. Right now.

309
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,269
What if we went down to the stables,
took two horses and left?

310
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,311
Ride east, keep riding.

311
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,560
- And go where?
- Away from here.

312
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,350
I could hunt deer, rabbit. I could feed us.

313
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,439
But this is your home.

314
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,637
You left your home for me.

315
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,670
Sparta was never my home.

316
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,073
My parents sent my there when I was 16
to marry Menelaus.

317
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,992
But it was never my home.

318
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,878
We'll live off the land.

319
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,476
No more palaces for us. No more
servants. We don't need any of that.

320
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,914
And your family?

321
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,755
We'd be protecting my family. If we're
not here, what's the need for war?

322
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,549
Menelaus won't give up.
He'll track us to the end of the world.

323
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,429
He doesn't know these lands. I do.
We can lose ourselves in a day.

324
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,556
You don't know Menelaus.

325
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,273
You don't know his brother.

326
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,796
They'll burn every house in Troy
to find us.

327
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,956
They'll never believe we've left.

328
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,110
And even if they do,
they'll burn it for spite.

329
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,709
Then I'll make it easy for him to find me.

330
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,840
I'll walk right up to him
and tell him you're mine.

331
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,871
You're very young, my love.

332
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,233
Look at that.

333
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,269
Take up your positions!

334
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,154
My lord?

335
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,671
Should we wait for the others?

336
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,757
- They brought us here for war, didn't they?
- Yes, but Agamemnon's orders...

337
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,275
You fight for me, Eudorus,
or Agamemnon?

338
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,714
For you, my lord.

339
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,112
Then fight for me. And let the servants
of Agamemnon fight for him.

340
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,474
Black sail.

341
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,278
It's Achilles.

342
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,919
What's the fool doing?

343
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,839
He's going to take the beach of Troy
with 50 men?

344
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,997
Make way there! Make way!

345
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,717
Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready?

346
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,077
- Waiting at the city gates.
- Good. I'll be right there.

347
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,553
Lysander, how long
before the army is ready?

348
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,792
Half of our men are still coming in
from the countryside. We have to arm them...

349
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,393
- How long?
- Noon.

350
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,118
Make it sooner.

351
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,352
Patroclus!

352
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,712
Put down your spear.

353
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,871
- But I'm fighting the Trojans, cousin.
- Not today.

354
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,996
But I'm ready.
You taught me how to fight.

355
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,909
And you're a good student.
But you're not a Myrmidon yet.

356
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,033
Look at these men.

357
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,352
They are the fiercest soldiers in all
of Greece. Each of them has bled for me.

358
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,431
- You'll guard the ship.
- But this is a war.

359
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,718
Cousin, I can't fight the Trojans if I'm
concerned for you. Guard the ship.

360
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,718
Trojans!

361
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,353
All my life, I've lived by a code.

362
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,596
And the code is simple:

363
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,479
Honor the gods, love your woman...

364
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,679
...and defend your country.

365
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,797
Troy is mother to us all.

366
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,554
Fight for her!

367
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,117
Myrmidons...

368
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,592
...my brothers of the sword.

369
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,270
I'd rather fight beside you
than any army of thousands.

370
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,557
Let no man forget how menacing we are.
We are lions!

371
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,876
Do you know what's there, waiting,
beyond that beach?

372
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,077
Immortality! Take it! It's yours!

373
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,437
Fight positions!

374
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,478
Archers!

375
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,958
Forward!

376
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,116
The man wants to die.

377
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,079
On my command!

378
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,712
Break off! Break off!

379
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,954
Look at him.

380
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,954
Look.

381
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,956
Row, you lazy whores, row!

382
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,959
Greeks are dying! Row!

383
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,312
Those men down there need help. Now!
Tecton, with me.

384
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,548
Flank! To the flank!

385
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,237
Achilles! Achilles!

386
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,677
Back to the city! Back to the city!

387
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,355
The sun god is a patron of Troy,
our enemy.

388
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,080
Take whatever treasure you can find.

389
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,718
With your permission, my lord.

390
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,273
- Speak.
- Apollo sees everything.

391
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,113
Perhaps...
Perhaps it is not wise to offend him.

392
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,313
Warn the men.

393
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,998
Wait.

394
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,953
You are very brave or very stupid
to come after me alone.

395
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,912
You must be Hector.

396
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,554
Do you know who I am?

397
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,398
These priests weren't armed.

398
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,356
Fight me!

399
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,709
Why kill you now, prince of Troy...

400
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,314
...with no one here to see you fall?

401
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,474
Why did you come here?

402
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,274
They'll be talking about this war
for 1000 years.

403
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,318
In 1000 years, the dust
from our bones will be gone.

404
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,835
Yes, prince. But our names will remain.

405
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,914
Go home, prince. Drink some wine,
make love to your wife.

406
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,878
Tomorrow, we'll have our war.

407
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,431
You speak of war as if it's a game.

408
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,275
But how many wives wait at Troy's gates
for husbands they'll never see again?

409
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,919
Perhaps your brother can comfort them.

410
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,117
I hear he's good at charming
other men's wives.

411
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,432
My lord, you let him go?

412
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,113
It's too early in the day
for killing princes.

413
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,271
Achilles! Achilles!

414
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,595
- Achilles.
- Ajax.

415
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,511
You're as fearless as the gods.
I'm honored to go to war with you.

416
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,033
As am I.

417
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,190
If you sailed any slower,
the war would be over.

418
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,920
I'll miss the start as long as I'm here
at the end.

419
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,276
I've got something to show you.

420
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,638
The men found her
hiding in the temple.

421
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,359
They thought she'd...

422
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,993
...amuse you.

423
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,359
What's your name?

424
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,118
Did you not hear me?

425
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,072
You killed Apollo's priests.

426
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,754
I've killed men in five countries,
never a priest.

427
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,717
Well, then your men did.

428
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,911
The sun god will have his vengeance.

429
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,834
What's he waiting for?

430
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,116
The right time to strike.

431
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,278
His priests are dead,
and his acolyte's a captive.

432
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,000
- I think your god is afraid of me.
- Afraid?

433
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,197
Apollo is master of the sun.
He fears nothing.

434
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,920
- Where is he?
- You're nothing but a killer!

435
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,719
You wouldn't know anything
about the gods.

436
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,318
I know more about the gods
than your priests.

437
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,353
I've seen them.

438
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,198
You're royalty, aren't you?

439
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,110
Spent years talking down to men.

440
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,712
You must be royalty.

441
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,233
What's your name?

442
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,360
Even the servants of Apollo
have names.

443
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,792
Briseis.

444
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,231
Are you afraid, Briseis?

445
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,713
Should I be?

446
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,673
My lord.

447
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,399
Agamemnon requests your presence.

448
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,713
The kings are gathering
to celebrate the victory.

449
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,718
You fought well today.

450
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,718
My lord.

451
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,516
What do you want here in Troy?

452
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,396
You didn't come
for the Spartan queen.

453
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,232
I want what all men want.

454
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,312
I just want it more.

455
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,471
You don't need to fear me, girl.

456
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,550
You're the only Trojan
who can say that.

457
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,476
You have won a great victory,
my king of kings.

458
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,398
No one thought the Trojan beach
could be captured so easily.

459
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,150
A beautiful gift, Triopas.

460
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,788
You will be among the first to walk
in the streets of Troy tomorrow.

461
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,473
My father, Neleus, had this urn made to
commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis.

462
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,392
I present it to you...

463
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,359
...in honor of an even more
memorable victory.

464
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,118
Thank you, old friend.

465
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,435
Tomorrow, we'll eat supper
in the gardens of Troy.

466
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,714
Leave us.

467
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,957
War is young men dying
and old men talking. You know this.

468
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,111
Ignore the politics.

469
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,671
Apparently,
you won some great victory.

470
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:13,312
Oh, perhaps you didn't notice.
The Trojan beach belonged to Priam in the morning.

471
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,233
It belongs to Agamemnon
in the afternoon.

472
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,595
Have the beach.
I didn't come here for sand.

473
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,034
No.

474
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,875
You came here because you want
your name to last through the ages.

475
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,838
A great victory was won today.

476
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,555
But that victory is not yours.

477
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,154
Kings did not kneel to Achilles.

478
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,233
Kings did not pay homage to Achilles.

479
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,949
Perhaps the kings were too far behind to see.
Soldiers won the battle.

480
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,315
History remembers kings!

481
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,432
Not soldiers.

482
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,948
Tomorrow, we'll batter down
the gates of Troy.

483
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,759
I'll build monuments to victory
on every island of Greece.

484
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,037
I'll carve "Agamemnon" in the stone.

485
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,954
Be careful, king of kings.
First, you need the victory.

486
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,789
Your men sacked the temple
of Apollo, yes?

487
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,552
You want gold? Take it.

488
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,632
It's my gift to honor your courage.
Take what you wish.

489
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,631
I already have.

490
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,552
Aphareus!

491
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,474
Haemon!

492
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,194
The spoils of war.

493
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,194
No argument with you, but if you don't
release her, you'll never see home again.

494
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,794
- Decide.
- Guards!

495
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,713
Stop!

496
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,877
Too many men have died today.

497
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,158
If killing is your only talent,
that's your curse.

498
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,954
I don't want anyone dying for me.

499
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:03,111
Mighty Achilles,
silenced by a slave girl.

500
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,872
Tonight, I'll have her give me a bath.

501
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,798
And then...

502
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,160
- ...who knows?
- You sack of wine!

503
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,872
Before my time is done, I will look
down on your corpse and smile.

504
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,996
If they want a war,
we will give them a war.

505
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,076
I would match the best of Troy
against the best of Greece any day.

506
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,549
The best of Greece outnumber
the best of Troy two to one.

507
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,472
Glaucus.

508
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,549
You have fought with me for 40 years.
Can we win this war?

509
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,314
Our walls have never been breached.

510
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,715
We have the finest archers
in the world.

511
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,951
And we have Hector.

512
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,839
Yes, we can win.

513
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,750
I spoke to two farmers today.

514
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,915
They saw an eagle flying
with a serpent clutched in its talons.

515
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,472
This is a sign from Apollo.

516
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,756
We will win a great victory tomorrow.

517
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,433
Bird signs.

518
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,359
You want to plan a strategy
based on bird signs.

519
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,953
Hector, show respect.

520
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,033
The high priest
is a servant of the gods.

521
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,475
And I am a servant of Troy.

522
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,710
I've always honored the gods, Father.
You know that.

523
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,793
But today I fought a Greek
who desecrated the statue of Apollo.

524
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,996
Apollo didn't strike the man down.

525
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,594
The gods won't fight this war for us.

526
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,557
There won't be a war.

527
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,351
This is not a conflict of nations.

528
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,670
It is a dispute between two men.

529
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,193
And I don't want to see another Trojan die
because of me.

530
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,998
Paris.

531
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,630
Tomorrow morning, I will challenge
Menelaus for the right to Helen.

532
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,078
The winner will take her home.
The loser will burn before nightfall.

533
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,033
Father...

534
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,760
...I'm sorry for the pain
I've caused you.

535
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,351
Do you love her?

536
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,993
You are a great king because you love
your country so much.

537
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,272
Every blade of grass.

538
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,111
Every grain of sand.

539
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,799
Every rock in the river.

540
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,995
You love all of Troy.

541
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,517
That is the way I love Helen.

542
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,798
I've fought many wars in my time.

543
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,550
Some were fought for land,
some for power, some for glory.

544
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:20,839
I suppose fighting for love makes
more sense than all the rest.

545
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,753
But I won't be the one fighting.

546
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,632
The sword of Troy.

547
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,835
My father carried this sword,
and his father before him...

548
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,514
...all the way back
to the founding of Troy.

549
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,639
The history of our people
was written with this sword.

550
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,990
Carry it with you tomorrow.

551
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,273
The spirit of Troy is in that sword.

552
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,512
So long as a Trojan carries it...

553
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,548
...our people have a future.

554
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,357
The man who killed Tecton
outside Apollo's temple...

555
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,919
...I've never seen a spear
thrown like that.

556
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,837
An impossible throw.

557
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,678
Don't go tomorrow.

558
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,279
- Please don't go.
- Paris fights tomorrow, not me.

559
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,115
Fifty thousand Greeks didn't cross
the sea to watch your brother fight.

560
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,633
You know this.

561
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,597
You'd make a fine general, my love.

562
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,151
You've been fighting your whole life.
Let other men do battle this time.

563
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,836
You know I don't want to fight.
I want to see my son grow tall.

564
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,389
I want to see the girls chasing after him.

565
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,356
I can't lose you.

566
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,598
I won't survive.

567
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,592
I must see Paris.

568
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,639
Wait.

569
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,959
Wait!

570
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,513
Helen, what are you doing?

571
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,716
- Let me go.
- No.

572
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,710
I saw them burn.

573
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,514
I saw them burning on the pyres.

574
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,238
That's my fault.

575
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,595
It is. You know it is.

576
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,438
All those widows.

577
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,675
I still hear them screaming.

578
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,317
Their husbands died because I'm here.

579
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,798
I'm going down to the ships.

580
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,552
No, you're not.

581
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,230
- I'm giving myself back to Menelaus.
- It's too late for that.

582
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,312
Do you think Agamemnon cares
about his brother's marriage?

583
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,869
This is about power. Not love.

584
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,231
Paris is going to fight in the morning.

585
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,154
- Yes.
- Menelaus will kill him.

586
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,673
I won't let that happen.

587
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,111
- It's his decision.
- No.

588
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,994
I can't ask anyone to fight for me.

589
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,590
I'm no longer queen of Sparta.

590
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,990
You're a princess of Troy now...

591
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,754
...and my brother needs you tonight.

592
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,992
My lord.

593
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,871
My lord, the army is marching.

594
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,594
- Let them march. We stay.
- But the men are ready.

595
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,479
We stay till Agamemnon groans
to have Achilles back.

596
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,634
As you wish.

597
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,033
Are you ready to fight?

598
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,835
Are you ready to kill? To take life?

599
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,472
I am.

600
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,075
At night, I see their faces,
all the men I've killed.

601
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,391
They're standing there on the far bank
of the River Styx.

602
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,552
They're waiting for me.

603
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,551
They say, "Welcome, brother."

604
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,317
We men are wretched things.

605
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,789
I taught you how to fight,
but I never taught you why to fight.

606
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,234
I fight for you.

607
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,311
Who will you fight for when I'm gone?

608
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,157
Soldiers, they fight for kings
they've never even met.

609
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,714
They do what they're told,
they die when they're told to die.

610
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,199
Soldiers obey.

611
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,031
Don't waste your life following
some fool's orders.

612
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,359
Go.

613
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,717
Are you sure you want to do this?

614
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,438
I started this war.

615
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,151
Helen...

616
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,833
...sit with me.

617
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,758
Prepare to halt!

618
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,592
Prepare to halt!

619
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,433
Halt!

620
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,592
Move.

621
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,752
I see you're not hiding behind
your high walls. Valiant of you.

622
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,639
ill-advised, but valiant.

623
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,395
You come here uninvited.
Go back to your ships and go home.

624
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,471
We've come too far, Prince Hector.

625
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,995
Prince? What prince?

626
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,879
What son of a king would accept
a man's hospitality...

627
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,192
...eat his food, drink his wine, then steal
his wife in the middle of the night?

628
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:50,511
The sun was shining
when your wife left you.

629
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,073
She's up there, watching, isn't she?
Good.

630
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,390
I want her to watch you die.

631
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,634
Not yet, brother.

632
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,358
Look around you, Hector.

633
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,956
I brought all the warriors of Greece
to your shores.

634
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,031
You can still save Troy, young prince.

635
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,599
I have two wishes.

636
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,957
If you grant them,
no more of your people need die.

637
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,998
First, you must give Helen
back to my brother.

638
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,597
Second, Troy must submit
to my command...

639
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,354
...to fight for me whenever I call.

640
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:25,432
You want me to look upon your army
and tremble?

641
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,073
Well, I see them.

642
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:34,076
I see 50,000 men brought here
to fight for one man's greed.

643
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,159
Careful, boy.

644
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,078
My mercy has limits.

645
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,549
And I've seen the limits of your mercy.

646
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,998
And I tell you now, no son of Troy
will ever submit to a foreign ruler.

647
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,358
Then every son of Troy shall die.

648
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,071
There is another way.

649
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,636
I love Helen. I won't give her up
and neither will you.

650
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,032
So let us fight our own battle.

651
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,875
The winner takes Helen home.
And let that be the end of it.

652
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,476
A brave offer, but not enough.

653
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,592
Let me kill this little peacock.

654
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:21,311
I didn't come here for your pretty wife.
I came here for Troy.

655
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,630
I came for my honor.

656
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,155
His every breath insults me.

657
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,990
Let me kill him. When he's lying
in the dust, give the signal to attack.

658
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,197
You'll have your city.
I'll have my revenge.

659
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,919
So be it.

660
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,198
I accept your challenge. And tonight,
I'll drink to your bones.

661
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,397
- My lord.
- Back to the line!

662
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,630
Make him swing and miss. He'll tire.

663
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,599
Brother...

664
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,672
...if I fall, tell Helen... Tell her...

665
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,512
I will.

666
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,671
Don't let Menelaus hurt her. If he...

667
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,116
You think of your sword and his sword
and nothing else.

668
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,432
Get up.

669
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,438
Come on.
