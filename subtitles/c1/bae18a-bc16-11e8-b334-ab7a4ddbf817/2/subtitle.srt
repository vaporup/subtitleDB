1
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:40,697
See the crows?

2
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:44,613
They never tasted prince before.

3
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:21,775
Is this what you left me for?!

4
00:01:21,937 --> 00:01:23,529
Fight!

5
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:25,131
Fight me!

6
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:27,451
You coward!

7
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:28,845
Fight me!

8
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:31,293
We have a pact! Fight!

9
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:34,650
Fight him, son. Fight him.

10
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:38,447
- Fight me!
- The Trojans have violated the agreement!

11
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:41,051
Prepare for battle!

12
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:44,017
This is not honor!

13
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:46,607
This is not worthy of royalty!

14
00:01:47,018 --> 00:01:49,975
If he doesn't fight, Troy is doomed.

15
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:51,931
The fight is over.

16
00:01:52,098 --> 00:01:54,167
The fight is not over.

17
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:55,975
Stand back, Prince Hector.

18
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:58,651
I'll kill him at your feet. I don't care.

19
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,091
He is my brother.

20
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:47,290
Paris!

21
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:57,735
Go!

22
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:06,049
Get inside, Paris!

23
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:07,851
Archers!

24
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:14,488
- Our men are too close to the walls.
- Pull back, you fool!

25
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:15,931
For Troy!

26
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:37,932
- Now!
- Loose!

27
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:06,531
Get them in line!

28
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:11,456
Get the men back into lines!

29
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,893
Front line, push!

30
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:57,051
Forward.

31
00:05:57,217 --> 00:05:58,492
Forward!

32
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:11,332
Forward!

33
00:06:22,377 --> 00:06:24,732
Apollonians! Now!

34
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:36,292
Prince Hector!

35
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:41,326
We need to retreat!

36
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:44,408
My army's never lost a battle yet!

37
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,967
You won't have an army
if you don't fall back!

38
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:54,848
Back to the ships!

39
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:56,656
- Back to the ships!
- Retreat!

40
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:57,806
- Back!
- Retreat!

41
00:06:57,977 --> 00:06:59,616
Go back!

42
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:06,577
Back. Back to the ships!

43
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:50,451
Fall back!

44
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:53,212
- Men, fall back!
- Halt!

45
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:01,537
Halt!

46
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,176
But we have them on the run!

47
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:05,453
We're in range of their archers.

48
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,448
Have our men gather our fallen.

49
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:10,416
Send an emissary to the greeks.
Tell them, they can collect their dead.

50
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:12,967
Would they have done the same for us?

51
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:17,376
Go! Back!

52
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:19,815
Fall back into line!

53
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,050
You think I'm a coward.

54
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:33,856
I am a coward.

55
00:09:35,537 --> 00:09:37,368
I knew he would kill me.

56
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:39,657
You were watching.

57
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:43,051
My father.

58
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:45,735
My brother.

59
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:49,492
All of Troy. Shame didn't matter.

60
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:51,935
I gave up my pride...

61
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,250
...my honor...

62
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,650
...just to live.

63
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:58,657
For love.

64
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,814
You challenged a great warrior.
That took courage.

65
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:06,615
I betrayed you.

66
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:15,207
Menelaus was a brave man.

67
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:20,255
He lived for fighting.

68
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:28,010
And every day I was with him, I wanted
to walk into the sea and drown.

69
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:36,129
I don't want a hero, my love.
I want a man I can grow old with.

70
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:43,131
They're laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!

71
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:46,291
They think I'll sail home at first light.

72
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:47,777
Maybe we should.

73
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,133
Flee? Like a whipped dog?

74
00:10:50,297 --> 00:10:53,768
The men believe we came here
for Menelaus' wife.

75
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:56,535
Won't be needing her anymore.

76
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,734
My brother's blood still wets the sand,
and you insult him!

77
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:02,457
It's no insult to say a dead man is dead.

78
00:11:02,617 --> 00:11:05,609
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.

79
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:10,055
The Trojans can beat us so easily.
How long before the Hittites invade?

80
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:14,496
If we stay, we stay here
for the right reasons.

81
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:16,774
To protect Greece, not your pride.

82
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:19,498
Your private battle with Achilles
is destroying us.

83
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:20,931
Achilles is one man.

84
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,373
Hector is one man.

85
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:25,376
Look what he did to us today.

86
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:29,247
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!

87
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:34,054
I don't care about the man's allegiance.
I care about his ability to win battles.

88
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:35,650
He's right.

89
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,331
The men's morale is weak.

90
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:42,207
Even if I could make peace with Achilles,
the man won't listen to me!

91
00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:46,216
He's as likely to spear me
as to speak to me!

92
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,812
I'll talk to him.

93
00:11:48,977 --> 00:11:50,376
He'll want the girl back.

94
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,176
He can have that damn girl.

95
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:55,612
I haven't touched her.

96
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:57,051
Where is she?

97
00:11:57,257 --> 00:11:58,850
I gave her to the men.

98
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:04,929
They need some amusement after today.

99
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:10,053
Come on, give the bitch to me!

100
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:12,136
Who's first?

101
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:14,176
Trojan whore!

102
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:16,248
What's this? A virgin's robe?

103
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:19,456
- You won't be needing that much longer!
- Hold her.

104
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,974
Better to be a Spartan slave
than a Trojan...

105
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,094
Achilles!

106
00:12:56,537 --> 00:12:58,289
Are you hurt?

107
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:06,528
I watched you fight them.
You have courage.

108
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:11,055
To fight back when people attack me?
Dog has that kind of courage.

109
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:35,010
Eat.

110
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:45,977
I've known men like you my whole life.

111
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:47,491
No, you haven't.

112
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:50,296
You think you're so different
from 1000 others?

113
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:54,806
Soldiers understand nothing but war.
Peace confuses them.

114
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:57,328
- And you hate these soldiers.
- I pity them.

115
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:00,812
Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you.

116
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:03,970
Perhaps they deserve
more than your pity.

117
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:08,370
Why did you choose this life?

118
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:11,006
- What life?
- To be a great warrior.

119
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:16,973
I chose nothing.
I was born, and this is what I am.

120
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,410
And you?
Why did you choose to love a god?

121
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:25,176
I think you'll find the romance one-sided.

122
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,209
Do you enjoy provoking me?

123
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:33,087
You've dedicated your life to the gods.

124
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:36,728
Zeus, god of thunder. Athena, goddess of wisdom.
You serve them.

125
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:39,332
- Yes, of course.
- And Ares, god of war?

126
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:42,376
Who blankets his bed with the skin
of men he's killed?

127
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:46,737
All the gods are to be feared
and respected.

128
00:14:57,457 --> 00:14:58,971
I'll tell you a secret...

129
00:14:59,537 --> 00:15:02,098
...something they don't teach you
in your temple.

130
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,453
The gods envy us.

131
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:18,168
They envy us because we're mortal.

132
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:22,376
Because any moment might be our last.

133
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:25,809
Everything's more beautiful
because we're doomed.

134
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:29,815
You will never be lovelier
than you are now.

135
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:35,610
We will never be here again.

136
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:46,649
I thought you were a dumb brute.

137
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:52,009
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.

138
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:14,531
Do it.

139
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:22,216
Nothing is easier.

140
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:23,651
Aren't you afraid?

141
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:30,209
Everyone dies. Today or 50 years
from now. What does it matter?

142
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:36,536
Do it.

143
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:40,128
You'll kill more men if I don't kill you.

144
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:41,811
Many.

145
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:54,051
My lord, there's...

146
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:11,926
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
We're going home.

147
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:17,410
Gather the stores.

148
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:24,527
Agamemnon is a proud man.

149
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:27,886
But he knows
when he's made a mistake.

150
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:30,208
The man sends you
to make his apologies?

151
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:34,852
What are you doing enthralled
to that pig of a king?

152
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:38,013
The world seems simple to you,
my friend...

153
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:41,534
...but when you're a king,
very few choices are simple.

154
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,176
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy
like Agamemnon.

155
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:47,930
Are we supposed to fear him?

156
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:52,774
You don't fear anyone.
That's your problem. Fear is useful.

157
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:57,251
We need you back.

158
00:18:57,457 --> 00:18:59,176
Greece needs you.

159
00:18:59,898 --> 00:19:02,537
Greece got along fine before I was born.

160
00:19:02,698 --> 00:19:04,847
Greece will be Greece
long after I'm dead.

161
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:06,968
I'm not talking about the land.

162
00:19:07,137 --> 00:19:09,253
The men need you.

163
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:14,097
Stay, Achilles.

164
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:16,695
You were born for this war.

165
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:22,055
Things are less simple today.

166
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:28,051
Women have a way
of complicating things.

167
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:34,775
Of all the kings of Greece,
I respect you the most.

168
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:36,929
But in this war, you're a servant.

169
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:40,090
Sometimes you have to serve
in order to lead.

170
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:44,291
I hope you understand that one day.

171
00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:51,095
We're going home?

172
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:54,657
We sail in the morning.

173
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:58,127
Greeks are being slaughtered.
We can't just sail away.

174
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:02,051
If it's fighting you still long for, there will
always be another war. That I promise you.

175
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:03,492
These are our countrymen.

176
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:06,536
You betray all of Greece
just to see Agamemnon fall.

177
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:08,689
Someone has to lose.

178
00:20:13,818 --> 00:20:16,537
The gods favor our cause.

179
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:19,655
Now is the time to destroy
the Greek army.

180
00:20:21,017 --> 00:20:23,327
Their morale is battered.

181
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:26,534
Hit them now. Hit them hard.

182
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:28,449
And they will run.

183
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,332
The Myrmidons didn't fight yesterday.

184
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:38,215
There must be dissension
among the Greeks.

185
00:20:38,377 --> 00:20:40,938
But if we attack their ships,
we will unify them.

186
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,528
If they decide to attack us, let them.

187
00:20:43,698 --> 00:20:46,530
Our walls can't be breached.
We'll beat them back again.

188
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,846
Yesterday, the Greeks
underestimated us.

189
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:55,814
We should not return the favor.

190
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:11,497
You're confident about the meaning
of these omens?

191
00:21:11,658 --> 00:21:15,048
The desecration of his temple
angers Apollo.

192
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:18,051
The gods have cursed the Greeks.

193
00:21:23,218 --> 00:21:25,778
Prepare the army.
We attack at daybreak.

194
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,809
Am I still your captive?

195
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:49,090
You're my guest.

196
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:54,569
In Troy, guests can leave
whenever they want.

197
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:56,330
You should leave then.

198
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:04,929
Would you leave this all behind?

199
00:22:09,218 --> 00:22:10,810
Would you leave Troy?

200
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:02,050
Hold those barricades!

201
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:23,935
Archers to the rear.

202
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:34,847
Achilles.

203
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:59,010
Achilles.

204
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:03,371
Now!

205
00:26:11,978 --> 00:26:13,331
Forward!

206
00:28:48,738 --> 00:28:50,251
Enough for one day.

207
00:28:52,337 --> 00:28:54,090
Yes.

208
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:56,451
Back to the ships!

209
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:58,926
Back to the ships!

210
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:02,329
It was his cousin.

211
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,016
To Troy!

212
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:11,730
- Back to the city!
- Back to the city!

213
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:13,216
To Troy!

214
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:17,287
We were going to sail home today.

215
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:22,578
I don't think anyone's sailing home now.

216
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:42,055
Achilles.

217
00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:57,534
You violated my command.

218
00:29:57,698 --> 00:29:59,927
No, my lord. There was a mistake.

219
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,531
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.

220
00:30:02,698 --> 00:30:04,733
You led them into combat.

221
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:11,657
I didn't lead them, my lord.
We thought you did.

222
00:30:18,978 --> 00:30:21,047
Where's Patroclus?

223
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,810
Patroclus!

224
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:26,127
We thought he was you, my lord.

225
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:32,373
He wore your armor, your shield,
your greaves, your helmet.

226
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:34,256
He even moved like you.

227
00:30:34,698 --> 00:30:36,689
Where is he?

228
00:30:40,457 --> 00:30:42,255
- Where?
- He's dead, my lord.

229
00:30:45,737 --> 00:30:47,171
Hector cut his throat.

230
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:56,453
Don't!

231
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:26,689
Where are you taking me?

232
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:34,175
Do you remember how to get here?

233
00:31:34,698 --> 00:31:36,290
Yes.

234
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:46,410
The next time you come here,
follow the tunnel.

235
00:31:46,578 --> 00:31:49,650
There are no turns, so you can't get lost.
Just keep walking.

236
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:52,206
When you get to the end,
you'll be by the river.

237
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,686
Follow the river until you get
to Mount Ida.

238
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:56,449
Why are you telling me this?

239
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:03,968
- If I die...
- No.

240
00:32:04,137 --> 00:32:06,652
...I don't know how long
the city will stand.

241
00:32:06,818 --> 00:32:09,412
If the Greeks get inside the walls,
it's over.

242
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:12,809
They'll kill all the men,
throw the babies from the city walls.

243
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:15,253
- Please.
- And the women, they'll take as slaves.

244
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:19,126
- That, for you, will be worse than dying.
- Why are you saying such things?

245
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:22,336
Because I want you to be ready.

246
00:32:23,097 --> 00:32:27,090
I want you to get our boy,
and I want you to bring him here.

247
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:31,654
You save as many people as you can,
but you get here. And you run.

248
00:32:38,138 --> 00:32:39,810
I killed a boy today.

249
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:43,250
And he was young.

250
00:32:44,377 --> 00:32:46,129
He was much too young.

251
00:33:14,537 --> 00:33:17,097
That boy has just saved this war for us.

252
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,088
- Eudorus.
- My lord.

253
00:34:49,257 --> 00:34:50,929
I need my armor.

254
00:35:49,377 --> 00:35:50,891
No.

255
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:53,411
Don't go!

256
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:56,174
Rope!

257
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:58,613
Hector's my cousin. He's a good man.

258
00:35:58,777 --> 00:36:01,814
Don't fight him. Please don't fight him.

259
00:36:02,218 --> 00:36:04,049
Please.

260
00:36:56,418 --> 00:36:57,692
No.

261
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:24,649
Hector!

262
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:32,256
Hector!

263
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,735
Hector!

264
00:37:46,538 --> 00:37:47,971
Hector!

265
00:37:51,658 --> 00:37:53,534
Father...

266
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:55,972
...forgive me for any offenses.

267
00:37:57,658 --> 00:37:59,888
I've served you as best as I could.

268
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,050
Hector!

269
00:38:06,177 --> 00:38:08,453
May the gods be with you.

270
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:14,136
Hector.

271
00:38:16,457 --> 00:38:19,654
No father ever had a better son.

272
00:38:26,057 --> 00:38:27,570
Hector!

273
00:38:29,377 --> 00:38:31,016
Apollo guard you, my prince.

274
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,330
You're the best man I know.

275
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:47,095
You're a prince of Troy.

276
00:38:47,817 --> 00:38:49,296
I know you'll make me proud.

277
00:38:56,697 --> 00:38:59,257
Hector!

278
00:39:15,578 --> 00:39:17,648
Remember what I told you.

279
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:21,295
You don't have to go. You don't.

280
00:39:21,578 --> 00:39:23,295
You remember what I told you.

281
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:43,167
Hector!

282
00:39:58,057 --> 00:40:00,525
Hector!

283
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:14,537
I've seen this moment in my dreams.

284
00:41:16,538 --> 00:41:17,857
I'll make a pact with you.

285
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:20,774
With the gods as our witnesses...

286
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:25,409
...let us pledge that the winner will allow
the loser all the proper funeral rituals.

287
00:41:25,578 --> 00:41:28,456
There are no pacts
between lions and men.

288
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:38,333
Now you know who you're fighting.

289
00:41:46,498 --> 00:41:49,216
I thought it was you
I was fighting yesterday.

290
00:41:49,537 --> 00:41:53,372
And I wish it had been you. But I gave
the dead boy the honor he deserved.

291
00:41:53,537 --> 00:41:55,448
You gave him the honor of your sword.

292
00:41:56,018 --> 00:41:59,168
You won't have eyes tonight.
You won't have ears or a tongue.

293
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:03,330
You'll wander the underworld, blind, deaf,
and dumb, and all the dead will know.

294
00:42:03,498 --> 00:42:07,172
This is Hector, the fool who thought
he killed Achilles.

295
00:44:00,297 --> 00:44:01,572
Get up, prince of Troy.

296
00:44:04,098 --> 00:44:06,931
Get up. I won't let
a stone take my glory.

297
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:34,894
You lost your cousin.

298
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:38,409
Now you've taken mine.

299
00:47:41,738 --> 00:47:43,295
When does it end?

300
00:47:45,137 --> 00:47:46,890
It never ends.

301
00:48:41,777 --> 00:48:43,290
Who are you?

302
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:49,089
I have endured what no one
on earth has endured before.

303
00:48:49,738 --> 00:48:54,811
I kissed the hands of the man
who killed my son.

304
00:49:01,578 --> 00:49:03,170
Priam?

305
00:49:04,498 --> 00:49:05,816
How did you get in here?

306
00:49:05,978 --> 00:49:09,766
I know my own country better
than the Greeks, I think.

307
00:49:14,058 --> 00:49:16,413
You're a brave man.

308
00:49:19,338 --> 00:49:22,375
I could have your head on a spit
in the blink of an eye.

309
00:49:22,737 --> 00:49:26,367
Do you really think death
frightens me now?

310
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:30,525
I watched my eldest son die...

311
00:49:30,697 --> 00:49:34,407
...watched you drag his body
behind your chariot.

312
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:39,247
Give him back to me.

313
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:44,211
He deserves the honor of a proper burial.
You know that.

314
00:49:45,538 --> 00:49:47,653
Give him to me.

315
00:49:48,137 --> 00:49:49,730
He killed my cousin.

316
00:49:49,898 --> 00:49:51,809
He thought it was you.

317
00:49:54,298 --> 00:49:56,892
How many cousins have you killed?

318
00:49:58,377 --> 00:50:02,087
How many sons and fathers
and brothers and husbands?

319
00:50:02,378 --> 00:50:04,766
How many, brave Achilles?

320
00:50:06,658 --> 00:50:08,649
I knew your father.

321
00:50:09,738 --> 00:50:11,968
He died before his time.

322
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:18,171
But he was lucky not to live long enough
to see his son fall.

323
00:50:22,858 --> 00:50:25,418
You have taken everything from me.

324
00:50:27,697 --> 00:50:29,177
My eldest son...

325
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,536
...heir to my throne...

326
00:50:31,978 --> 00:50:33,854
...defender of my kingdom.

327
00:50:35,778 --> 00:50:40,248
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.

328
00:50:41,498 --> 00:50:44,695
But give me this small mercy.

329
00:50:46,697 --> 00:50:50,373
I loved my boy from the moment
he opened his eyes...

330
00:50:50,537 --> 00:50:53,574
...till the moment you closed them.

331
00:50:55,898 --> 00:50:58,775
Let me wash his body.

332
00:51:00,297 --> 00:51:03,415
Let me say the prayers.

333
00:51:04,617 --> 00:51:09,294
Let me place two coins on his eyes
for the boatman.

334
00:51:13,898 --> 00:51:16,047
If I let you walk out of here...

335
00:51:18,258 --> 00:51:20,135
...if I let you take him...

336
00:51:22,658 --> 00:51:24,614
...it doesn't change anything.

337
00:51:26,138 --> 00:51:28,697
You're still my enemy in the morning.

338
00:51:29,777 --> 00:51:32,690
You're still my enemy tonight.

339
00:51:33,697 --> 00:51:37,134
But even enemies can show respect.

340
00:51:56,017 --> 00:51:57,416
I admire your courage.

341
00:52:04,777 --> 00:52:06,496
Meet me outside in a moment.

342
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:49,295
We'll meet again soon, my brother.

343
00:53:06,938 --> 00:53:09,247
Your son was the best I've fought.

344
00:53:12,338 --> 00:53:14,898
In my country, the funeral games
last for 12 days.

345
00:53:15,418 --> 00:53:17,249
It is the same in my country.

346
00:53:17,418 --> 00:53:19,488
Then the prince will have that honor.

347
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:23,014
No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days.

348
00:53:28,898 --> 00:53:30,217
Briseis?

349
00:53:33,178 --> 00:53:35,453
I thought you were dead.

350
00:53:45,697 --> 00:53:46,972
You are free.

351
00:54:00,898 --> 00:54:02,535
If I hurt you...

352
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,768
...it's not what I wanted.

353
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:22,296
Go.

354
00:54:22,457 --> 00:54:25,495
No one will stop you.
You have my word.

355
00:54:26,257 --> 00:54:27,816
Come, my girl.

356
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:39,566
You're a far better king than the one
leading this army.

357
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:59,775
Achilles makes a secret pact, and I
have to honor it? What treason is this?

358
00:54:59,938 --> 00:55:03,977
Consorting with the enemy king.
Giving him 12 days of peace.

359
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:06,174
Peace!

360
00:55:06,617 --> 00:55:09,052
Their prince is dead.
Their army is leaderless.

361
00:55:09,217 --> 00:55:10,969
This is the time to attack!

362
00:55:11,138 --> 00:55:15,097
Even with Hector gone, we have
no way to breach their walls.

363
00:55:15,258 --> 00:55:17,852
I will smash their walls to the ground...

364
00:55:18,017 --> 00:55:20,485
...if it costs me 40,000 Greeks.

365
00:55:20,658 --> 00:55:23,172
Hear me, Zeus!

366
00:55:23,338 --> 00:55:27,570
I will smash their walls to the ground.

367
00:55:40,057 --> 00:55:41,411
That's good.

368
00:55:41,778 --> 00:55:43,608
For my son back home.

369
00:56:08,138 --> 00:56:09,617
Well, Odysseus.

370
00:56:10,578 --> 00:56:15,048
You found a way to make the sheep
invite the wolves to dinner.

371
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:33,572
Forgive me, Eudorus.
I should never have struck you.

372
00:56:34,818 --> 00:56:37,775
You've been a loyal friend all your life.

373
00:56:39,338 --> 00:56:41,898
I hope I never disappoint you again.

374
00:56:42,217 --> 00:56:44,607
It's I who have been the disappointment.

375
00:56:46,218 --> 00:56:48,777
Rouse the men.
You're taking them home.

376
00:56:49,257 --> 00:56:51,010
Aren't you coming with us?

377
00:56:51,777 --> 00:56:53,893
I have my own battle to fight.

378
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:55,970
Let me march beside you.

379
00:56:56,137 --> 00:57:00,211
No. I don't want our men
to be a part of this.

380
00:57:05,658 --> 00:57:07,409
It's a beautiful night.

381
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:11,255
Go, Eudorus.
This is the last order I give you.

382
00:57:16,738 --> 00:57:19,730
Fighting for you has been
my life's honor, my lord.

383
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:28,050
Open the gates!

384
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:43,410
Here.

385
00:59:08,697 --> 00:59:10,290
Plague.

386
00:59:10,938 --> 00:59:13,406
Don't go too close, my king.

387
00:59:13,978 --> 00:59:16,127
This is the will of the gods.

388
00:59:16,298 --> 00:59:18,288
They desecrated the temple of Apollo...

389
00:59:18,457 --> 00:59:21,131
...and Apollo desecrated their flesh.

390
00:59:21,297 --> 00:59:25,086
They thought they could come here
and sack our city in a day.

391
00:59:25,257 --> 00:59:28,933
Now look at them,
fleeing across the Aegean.

392
00:59:32,338 --> 00:59:34,055
What is this?

393
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:38,893
An offering to Poseidon. The Greeks
are praying for a safe return home.

394
00:59:39,177 --> 00:59:43,887
This is a gift. We should take it
to the temple of Poseidon.

395
00:59:44,457 --> 00:59:46,289
- I think we should burn it.
- Burn it?

396
00:59:46,578 --> 00:59:48,614
My prince, it's a gift to the gods.

397
00:59:51,818 --> 00:59:54,207
Father, burn it.

398
01:00:49,578 --> 01:00:51,056
Look at them.

399
01:00:52,498 --> 01:00:54,853
You'd think their prince had never died.

400
01:00:56,938 --> 01:00:58,928
You are the prince now.

401
01:00:59,658 --> 01:01:01,614
Make your brother proud.

402
01:04:30,257 --> 01:04:31,929
Briseis. Where is she?

403
01:04:32,098 --> 01:04:34,248
- Where?
- I don't know.

404
01:04:34,418 --> 01:04:36,090
Please. I have a son.

405
01:04:36,537 --> 01:04:38,893
Then get him out of Troy.

406
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:54,371
Briseis!

407
01:05:37,097 --> 01:05:40,056
Paris! Andromache!

408
01:05:41,418 --> 01:05:43,169
Helen. We must go.

409
01:05:43,337 --> 01:05:45,090
- Where?
- I'll show you. Now. Hurry.

410
01:05:45,257 --> 01:05:46,975
Paris. Paris.

411
01:05:47,137 --> 01:05:49,572
It's a long way. Quick.
We must go now.

412
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:51,296
Briseis!

413
01:05:54,338 --> 01:05:56,055
Paris!

414
01:06:08,697 --> 01:06:10,369
Let it burn!

415
01:06:10,537 --> 01:06:12,768
Let Troy burn!

416
01:06:12,937 --> 01:06:16,134
Burn it! Burn it all!

417
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:18,654
Burn Troy!

418
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,333
Burn Troy!

419
01:06:21,898 --> 01:06:24,013
It's a long way. Quick.

420
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:29,251
- Come.
- I stay.

421
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,568
- No.
- My father will never abandon the city.

422
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,057
I can't leave him.

423
01:06:33,218 --> 01:06:36,574
The city is dead.
They're burning it to the ground.

424
01:06:38,058 --> 01:06:40,128
- What's your name?
- Aeneas.

425
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:43,176
- Do you know how to use a sword?
- Yes.

426
01:06:43,338 --> 01:06:45,249
The sword of Troy.

427
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,807
As long as it remains in the hands of a Trojan,
our people have a future.

428
01:06:48,978 --> 01:06:51,446
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home.

429
01:06:51,657 --> 01:06:53,250
- I will.
- Hurry.

430
01:06:54,138 --> 01:06:56,447
Paris, Briseis wasn't in her room.

431
01:06:56,617 --> 01:06:58,050
I'll find her.

432
01:07:00,377 --> 01:07:01,970
Go.

433
01:07:02,697 --> 01:07:04,289
- I'll stay with you.
- Go.

434
01:07:04,457 --> 01:07:05,776
Please don't leave me.

435
01:07:05,937 --> 01:07:07,848
How could you love me if I ran now?

436
01:07:08,018 --> 01:07:12,454
We will be together again, in this world
or the next. We will be together.

437
01:07:18,658 --> 01:07:20,215
Go.

438
01:07:23,658 --> 01:07:25,728
To the gate!

439
01:07:36,537 --> 01:07:38,449
Soldiers of Troy...

440
01:07:38,737 --> 01:07:40,933
...you men are warriors!

441
01:07:41,097 --> 01:07:43,658
To lead you has been my honor!

442
01:07:44,817 --> 01:07:46,968
My prince!

443
01:07:47,977 --> 01:07:49,855
The boatman waits for us.

444
01:07:50,058 --> 01:07:53,414
I say we make him wait a little longer!

445
01:08:14,218 --> 01:08:15,571
Paris!

446
01:08:16,057 --> 01:08:17,935
Paris!

447
01:08:52,978 --> 01:08:54,808
Have you no honor?

448
01:08:55,738 --> 01:08:57,376
Have you no honor?

449
01:09:27,817 --> 01:09:30,252
Too late for prayer, priestess.

450
01:09:37,937 --> 01:09:41,408
I almost lost this war
because of your little romance.

451
01:09:52,777 --> 01:09:56,612
You'll be my slave in Mycenae.

452
01:09:56,777 --> 01:10:00,930
A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors.

453
01:10:02,897 --> 01:10:04,171
And at night...

454
01:10:17,218 --> 01:10:18,809
Get up!

455
01:10:21,977 --> 01:10:23,774
Hold her.

456
01:10:31,578 --> 01:10:32,851
Come with me.

457
01:10:36,417 --> 01:10:37,897
No!

458
01:10:43,018 --> 01:10:46,009
Paris!

459
01:10:49,217 --> 01:10:50,491
No!

460
01:11:00,618 --> 01:11:03,496
Stop! Please!

461
01:11:08,817 --> 01:11:11,047
Paris! Don't!

462
01:11:35,937 --> 01:11:37,291
It's all right.

463
01:11:37,897 --> 01:11:39,695
It's all right.

464
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:56,294
You gave me peace...

465
01:11:58,057 --> 01:12:00,014
...in a lifetime of war.

466
01:12:05,178 --> 01:12:06,690
Briseis, come.

467
01:12:06,897 --> 01:12:08,330
Go.

468
01:12:09,338 --> 01:12:10,612
You must.

469
01:12:11,057 --> 01:12:12,490
No.

470
01:12:12,818 --> 01:12:14,410
Troy is falling.

471
01:12:14,977 --> 01:12:16,730
Go.

472
01:12:20,057 --> 01:12:23,175
We must go. I know a way out.

473
01:12:27,257 --> 01:12:28,532
It's all right.

474
01:12:30,937 --> 01:12:32,576
Go.

475
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,767
Briseis, come.

476
01:12:39,937 --> 01:12:41,735
Go.

477
01:14:07,698 --> 01:14:09,256
Find peace...

478
01:14:10,178 --> 01:14:11,610
...my brother.

479
01:14:23,978 --> 01:14:28,415
If they ever tell my story, let them say...

480
01:14:28,578 --> 01:14:30,966
...I walked with giants.

481
01:14:31,617 --> 01:14:34,928
Men rise and fall like the winter wheat...

482
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:37,493
...but these names will never die.

483
01:14:39,457 --> 01:14:42,928
Let them say I lived
in the time of Hector...

484
01:14:43,097 --> 01:14:45,133
...tamer of horses.

485
01:14:45,537 --> 01:14:47,368
Let them say...

486
01:14:47,538 --> 01:14:51,053
...I lived in the time of Achilles.
