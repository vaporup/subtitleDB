1
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:04,173
Hey, big eyes.
What's your name?

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,340
Hey, let me see your face

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,086
You pricks,
mind your own business!

4
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,089
Big eyes,
you're my girl

5
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,119
Everybody got that?

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,370
I read five of them

7
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,678
You're lying

8
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:42,217
You only read one

9
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:44,082
Huh?

10
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:46,543
What's your name?

11
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,382
Ji-hwan

12
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,580
Lee Ji-hwan

13
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:53,050
Can you fight well?

14
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:55,986
Yes, I can

15
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,755
he calls me

16
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:01,358
but I don't afraid at all

17
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:03,638
Because she was behind me

18
00:01:03,638 --> 00:01:05,540
I raised my fists,

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,065
and went after him
screaming

20
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:10,311
It was good up till then

21
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:11,579
And then?

22
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,046
I got beaten

23
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,850
I couldn't hit him even once,

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,545
and he almost killed me

25
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:19,154
So,

26
00:01:19,154 --> 00:01:21,054
she turned her
back on me and left

27
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:23,423
I guessed she liked macho men

28
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,855
I heard she married him,

29
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:28,429
and they run a tent bar now

30
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:29,361
The end

31
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:30,894
Now, it's your turn

32
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:34,861
When I was a kid,

33
00:01:35,603 --> 00:01:38,436
I was in the hospital once

34
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:40,965
That's where

35
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,844
I met him

36
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:05,230
He was a notorious troublemaker
at that hospital

37
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:09,500
He played a prank
on the nurses,

38
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:12,136
and then hid in my room

39
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:16,509
the first time I saw him,

40
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:20,511
he smiled really stupid

41
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,313
We became friends quickly,

42
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,219
and my room turned
completely into a playground

43
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,454
He was special

44
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:38,361
He was very sick,

45
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,900
but a smile never left his face

46
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:51,002
When I think of it now,
it's really funny,

47
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,015
but I asked people

48
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:56,245
to call me by his name

49
00:02:56,985 --> 00:02:58,179
Why?

50
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:03,625
Well, I thought that

51
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,025
even if
we were to split apart,

52
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,295
I'd feel as if
I was always with him

53
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:15,826
Ji-hwan

54
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:19,902
What, Soo-in?

55
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,195
We've finally made it

56
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:43,164
the snow on top of the trees

57
00:03:43,164 --> 00:03:46,099
is so beautiful

58
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:50,599
people call it snow flowers

59
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:55,169
Wow, you could be a tour guide

60
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,243
We'll just have
to come this winter

61
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:59,414
Yeah
Let's come again during winter

62
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:02,349
I'm serious.
Promise

63
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:05,953
Promise

64
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:07,944
Seal

65
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:20,066
Doesn't seem like
it'll stop raining soon

66
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,804
We'd better hurry

67
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,968
- Yeah, let's hurry
- A little more

68
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,243
Let's stay a little longer

69
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:47,721
Hold on a little more.
We'll get there soon

70
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:55,968
Sorry for begging you to come

71
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:05,646
You know me.
Right?

72
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:08,338
I'm okay

73
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:16,249
Is she better?

74
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,349
Yeah, she just fell asleep

75
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,842
I'm okay

76
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,881
I'm okay

77
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:56,460
Never saw someone cry before?

78
00:05:57,698 --> 00:06:01,828
No, it's just...

79
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:04,696
Just that it's awkward

80
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:10,144
Hey! I just got sentimental

81
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:11,879
since it's raining

82
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,916
Why? It's not cool?

83
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,909
Ouch, it hurts.
Stop it

84
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,792
Ji-yoon!

85
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:34,919
what are you doing there?

86
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:40,728
Ji-hwan

87
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,534
I want to be alone

88
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:54,782
Did that bookstore
guy hurt you?

89
00:07:54,782 --> 00:07:59,685
No.
I don't like him anymore

90
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:02,822
He absolutely has no sense

91
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:06,394
And he's not that
good-looking up close

92
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:10,490
And he seems
to flirt with anyone

93
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:18,695
Plus,
he's going to the army

94
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:22,944
He seems so weak,

95
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:25,105
so how could they take him in?

96
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:42,527
Long time no see.
You must've been busy

97
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:43,855
Yes

98
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,768
A great book
came in yesterday

99
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:54,004
Do you wanna see it?

100
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,335
No, that's okay

101
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:20,760
I'm not gonna be here
for a while

102
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:25,399
So I made a list of good books

103
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:28,974
They're for you to read

104
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:31,470
Thank you

105
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:38,711
Take care

106
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:08,614
How do I look?

107
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:12,579
Where's Soo-in?

108
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:15,182
She wants to rest at home

109
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:17,858
yet

110
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:19,817
Does she still feel sick?

111
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:30,634
It feels strange

112
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:33,531
with just the two of us

113
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:39,510
It feels like we're dating

114
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,279
Let's skip the exhibition,
and go for a drink

115
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:47,848
I feel like drinking

116
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:15,707
Are you coming to Chul-hyun's
birthday party next Saturday?

117
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:18,148
Friend

118
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:24,215
Wanna learn how to
make a donut with smoke?

119
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:26,827
If you do this,

120
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:29,091
girls will love you

121
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,432
Wait

122
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:32,592
Lighter

123
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:37,130
What's wrong with you?

124
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:42,471
What's wrong with me?

125
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:46,547
Don't act

126
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:50,210
as if you're my boyfriend

127
00:11:51,218 --> 00:12:00,058
Ji-hwan. Lee Ji-hwan!
Don't flatter yourself, okay?

128
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,767
I'm drinking somewhere else

129
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,239
Don't follow me

130
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:35,018
What are you doing?

131
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:39,325
I know you're a nice guy

132
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,769
So you don't have to do this

133
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:45,365
Stop it

134
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:51,772
You!
You look really mean today

135
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:54,606
Why? Just because

136
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:57,649
Because I'm drunk

137
00:12:58,586 --> 00:13:00,713
You look very mean

138
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,684
because I'm drunk

139
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,926
Fine, it's all my fault

140
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:08,362
Let's cross first

141
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:10,990
Let go, you bastard!

142
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:15,832
Taxi!

143
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:35,220
Know why I invited
all of you here today?

144
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:38,092
No particular reason

145
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:45,225
Since life is
so dull and boring,

146
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,701
those who wanna sing, sing,

147
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,538
and those who
wanna drink, drink

148
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:53,007
Have fun till you die

149
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:56,343
Hey, stop babbling

150
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:59,710
- Everyone drink
- Hold on, I'm talking

151
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:05,185
I wanna get something
clear to you all

152
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:08,086
Especially to the ladies here

153
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:13,160
This woman here
is not my girlfriend

154
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,996
She's just a friend.
Only a friend

155
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:18,362
Alcohol friend

156
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:21,335
Please keep your eyes on me

157
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:23,496
Me, too Me, too

158
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:31,167
Let's drink!
Asta-la-via!

159
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:45,955
I didn't think you'd come

160
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:51,094
Are you sober now?

161
00:14:57,404 --> 00:14:59,599
Are you still sick?

162
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,869
I'm much better now

163
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:04,878
Don't take it off

164
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:07,472
I'm okay.
It's too uncomfortable

165
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:11,011
Man, that cold
is lasting forever

166
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,666
Is it alright if I sing?

167
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,465
Oh, sure

168
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:47,310
* The child I'm looking for

169
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:53,283
* Is hard to see

170
00:15:54,762 --> 00:16:00,534
* Who understands the world

171
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:06,302
* Who even loves tiny leaves

172
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:12,646
* Whoa, whoa, isn't common

173
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,480
* Yeah, yeah, is hard to see

174
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:22,917
* The child I'm looking for

175
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:29,358
* I can see

176
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:36,770
* My loving friend Ji-hwan

177
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:42,810
* My loving friend Kyung-hee

178
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:48,544
* Whoa, whoa, they can see

179
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:54,517
* Yeah, yeah, I can see

180
00:16:54,788 --> 00:17:00,590
* Whoa, whoa, I can see

181
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:08,293
* Yeah, yeah, I can see

182
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,585
Ji-hwan, I have
something to tell you

183
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,212
Wanna go outside?

184
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,814
Sorry that I'm going early

185
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:34,720
No, that's okay.
You're sick,

186
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:37,258
so you should rest

187
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:39,856
Ji-hwan, wait

188
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,267
Stay still

189
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,165
Huh?

190
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:48,172
Close your eyes

191
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,274
Why?

192
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,708
Just close them for me

193
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:46,327
Okay, you can open them now

194
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,435
What was that?

195
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:58,612
I suddenly remembered a game

196
00:18:58,612 --> 00:19:01,513
I played when I was young

197
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:28,869
Soo-in,

198
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:31,001
when you catch a cold,

199
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:34,644
it's good to
brush your teeth

200
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:37,880
and wash your
feet and hands often

201
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,984
And Soo-in,

202
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:44,984
I have a favor to ask

203
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:51,520
I think I like Kyung-hee

204
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:54,256
I'm just asking for your help

205
00:19:55,102 --> 00:19:59,038
Kyung-hee, you're
looking at this, huh?

206
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,600
You like me too, right?

207
00:20:05,112 --> 00:20:07,444
What are you doing?

208
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:11,110
Oh, nothing

209
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:14,320
I'm leaving

210
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:22,188
Kyung-hee

211
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:34,597
Will you give this to Soo-in?

212
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:45,249
It's nothing important.
It's just...

213
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:50,089
Don't read it, okay?

214
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:53,883
All right

215
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,028
There's a taxi

216
00:20:58,231 --> 00:21:00,722
Taxi!

217
00:21:04,604 --> 00:21:06,663
Bye

218
00:21:07,174 --> 00:21:08,775
Get in

219
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:10,572
You go ahead first

220
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,376
No, just go in

221
00:21:13,747 --> 00:21:15,882
Aren't you getting in?

222
00:21:15,882 --> 00:21:17,907
Don't make me angry

223
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:23,248
Okay, get home safely

224
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:35,226
You better not look at it

225
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,722
Kyung-hee

226
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,555
It's strange

227
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:35,859
I could tell you in person,

228
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:40,288
but I felt like
writing to you today

229
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:43,970
Just read it to me

230
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:46,934
Really?

231
00:22:57,017 --> 00:22:59,884
To my beloved friend Kyung-hee

232
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:02,014
Beloved?

233
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,556
I'm not reading it

234
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:09,853
Okay, I won't do it again

235
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:14,998
I had a really hard day

236
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:18,433
I had a hemodialysis twice,

237
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:22,933
and two
intramuscular injections

238
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:28,940
But I beared it.
I didn't make a sound

239
00:23:29,816 --> 00:23:31,545
Good

240
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,846
Know what I thought about
to bear it?

241
00:23:38,091 --> 00:23:39,991
You and Ji-hwan

242
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:43,861
I thought you'd come tell me

243
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:47,367
how fun it was with Ji-hwan

244
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:49,995
Okay, that's enough

245
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:54,665
I'll read it on my own

246
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,584
And this is for Ji-hwan

247
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,656
I thought you'd read it
so I was careful

248
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:22,199
Promise me
you'll give it to him

249
00:24:51,498 --> 00:24:52,866
Hey,

250
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,097
those girls will never show up

251
00:24:57,203 --> 00:24:59,967
What were you three
doing all that time?

252
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:05,475
Don't know where they live
and their numbers?

253
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:19,192
You're right.
What were we doing?

254
00:25:22,996 --> 00:25:25,931
What have we been doing?

255
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:37,035
Hello?

256
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:40,539
Ji-hwan

257
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:49,751
What's wrong with your hand?

258
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,419
Just an accident

259
00:25:56,696 --> 00:26:01,133
You should be careful

260
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:03,634
Yeah

261
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,571
I'm really sorry to say this

262
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,151
But we became
uncomfortable around you

263
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,786
You guys now make me

264
00:26:28,928 --> 00:26:31,294
uncomfortable, too

265
00:26:32,732 --> 00:26:35,030
If you're done, then go

266
00:26:35,702 --> 00:26:37,567
It's late

267
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:33,180
By any chance,
are you Mrs Kim Yeun-soo?

268
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,411
Yes

269
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,554
I'm Lee Ji-hwan,
I called you yesterday

270
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:42,228
Was it the class of 1996?

271
00:28:42,228 --> 00:28:43,217
Yes

272
00:28:43,663 --> 00:28:47,497
You understand we don't
sell this outside

273
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:51,997
But you're lucky.
We're almost out of them

274
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:54,035
Thank you

275
00:28:56,843 --> 00:29:00,370
By the way,
who are you looking for?

276
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:01,739
Yes?

277
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,708
Well, no

278
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:09,589
Just that my girlfriend
had lost her yearbook

279
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:11,324
No, please

280
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:14,919
I just thought
I could be of some help

281
00:29:15,195 --> 00:29:18,698
You see,
I graduated in 96 as well

282
00:29:18,698 --> 00:29:20,598
I attended this school

283
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:22,234
Oh, I see

284
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:26,099
It's been five years,
so she might've moved

285
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,537
And I'm also curious as to
who you're looking for

286
00:29:31,477 --> 00:29:32,705
You see

287
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:37,047
It's two people

288
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:40,920
One is Kyung-hee.
Kim Kyung-hee

289
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,356
The other is Soo-in?
Shim Soo-in?

290
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:46,783
Do you know them?

291
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,858
So that's who
you were looking for

292
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:55,697
Sure, I know them
since they were famous

293
00:29:55,935 --> 00:29:58,665
They were very sick

294
00:29:59,873 --> 00:30:04,105
They barely came to school,
and were always together

295
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:08,179
Others were both jealous
and sympathetic of them

296
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:12,843
They were very sick?

297
00:30:13,486 --> 00:30:18,856
My goodness.
You didn't know?

298
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:25,358
Actually, I was also shocked
when I first heard it

299
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:30,896
They were absent a lot,
but they never showed it

300
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,641
I'm sorry to tell you this

301
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:44,115
Soo-in isn't in Seoul anymore,
and Kyung-hee passed away

302
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,147
Pardon?

303
00:30:47,587 --> 00:30:52,456
What are you talking about?
Kyung-hee's dead?

304
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:56,794
Yes, it's so awful

305
00:30:57,563 --> 00:31:01,363
I was a sophomore then

306
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:06,230
It's been five years already

307
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,974
Kyung-hee's dead?
Kyung-hee?

308
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:18,207
Soo-in will be hard to find

309
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:20,620
After Kyung-hee died,

310
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,817
Soo-in's health got worse

311
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,687
She had it hard

312
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:29,057
Since they relied on
each other so much

313
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,994
Holding back my wish
to scribble with you together

314
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:41,366
But Min-sik
will be in late today

315
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:44,643
Can you tell me
where I find him?

316
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,271
Ji-hwan!

317
00:32:56,883 --> 00:33:05,621
Ji-hwan! Ji-hwan!

318
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:12,531
Ji-hwan, where did you go?
You scared us

319
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:18,132
Hi!

320
00:33:42,628 --> 00:33:47,429
* The child I'm looking for

321
00:33:49,368 --> 00:33:55,068
* is hard to see

322
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:13,549
Do you have a girlfriend now?

323
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:30,243
Kyung-hee, I found Ji-hwan

324
00:34:30,243 --> 00:34:32,211
I found Ji-hwan

325
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:37,615
Really? That's great

326
00:35:02,775 --> 00:35:04,675
Hold on

327
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:19,119
Soo-in, let's change
our names from today

328
00:35:19,258 --> 00:35:21,761
I'm Soo-in and you're Kyung-hee

329
00:35:21,761 --> 00:35:25,331
Why?
Why do you wanna change names?

330
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:31,668
If we do, even if we're apart

331
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:37,604
we'll think of each other always

332
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:42,308
That'll be fun.
You're Soo-in and I'm Kyung-hee

333
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:46,182
When I think of it now,
it's really funny,

334
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:51,480
but I asked people
to call me by his name

335
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:52,918
Why?

336
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:00,763
Well, I thought that even if
we were to split apart,

337
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:04,334
I'd feel as if
I was always with him

338
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:20,184
Next.
Number 42, Shim Soo-in

339
00:36:20,419 --> 00:36:22,410
- Yes
- Yes

340
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:30,696
Kyung-hee,

341
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:32,425
Yes

342
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,800
Soo-in -- Kyung-Hee

343
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:48,775
You're so lucky
to ride on this

344
00:36:50,049 --> 00:36:51,384
You know what?

345
00:36:51,384 --> 00:36:56,689
Nurse Park and Dr Kim
had a fling

346
00:36:56,689 --> 00:37:00,887
They were caught kissing
in the medicine room

347
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,055
- Kyung-hee
- Yeah?

348
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:07,397
I love you

349
00:37:09,135 --> 00:37:14,402
Me, too

350
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,250
Ji-hwan, she's here

351
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:37,095
Hi

352
00:41:54,286 --> 00:41:56,254
Hi

353
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:18,199
Oh yeah, I forgot

354
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,910
You had a small scar here

355
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,818
So this mole
was on the left side

356
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:34,418
I wasn't sure

357
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:15,324
Kyung-hee's got a boyfriend

358
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:21,030
Kyung-hee's got a boyfriend

359
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:23,040
I'm taking her away!

360
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,872
No!

361
00:43:25,944 --> 00:43:28,208
Don't take her!

362
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:42,519
It's Ji-yoon, the one who
always borrowed romance novels

363
00:43:42,795 --> 00:43:45,161
Do you remember me?

364
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:56,771
Hi.
I miss you

365
00:44:39,384 --> 00:44:40,753
Congratulations, be happy

366
00:44:40,753 --> 00:44:41,620
Thanks, go and eat

367
00:44:43,455 --> 00:44:46,549
See you at the reception.
Eat only two servings

368
00:44:48,794 --> 00:44:51,285
Your wish came true.
Congratulations

369
00:44:52,164 --> 00:44:54,223
Congratulations.
Thanks Ji-hwan

370
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:55,834
Congratulations

371
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:58,270
Thank you.
Congratulations also

372
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,238
on getting back together

373
00:45:03,976 --> 00:45:07,646
How about a picture for this moment?
I'll take it for you

374
00:45:07,646 --> 00:45:11,984
Should we?

375
00:45:11,984 --> 00:45:13,781
No

376
00:45:15,387 --> 00:45:17,514
You look fine

377
00:46:06,104 --> 00:46:10,438
You have to give it to him

378
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:23,388
Hi, Ji-hwan. It's Soo-in.
Are you doing okay?

379
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:31,855
Of course.
Soo-in, are you doing okay, too?

380
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:36,893
I think I'm going far away

381
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:42,099
I really don't want to go

382
00:46:42,774 --> 00:46:47,370
What will I do if I
miss you and Kyung-hee?

383
00:46:48,814 --> 00:46:52,648
Ji-hwan,
take care of Kyung-hee

384
00:46:53,886 --> 00:46:57,222
I know without you telling me

385
00:46:57,222 --> 00:47:01,215
that you two like each other

386
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,322
Here's some advice
about Kyung-hee

387
00:47:07,065 --> 00:47:09,431
Kyung-hee's favorite food are

388
00:47:09,735 --> 00:47:14,604
sponge cake with yellow jam
and strawberry juice

389
00:47:14,907 --> 00:47:19,606
And she likes guys
who has a funny bright smile

390
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:25,175
Look carefully
between her eyes

391
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:29,988
If she has three wrinkles,
it means she's feeling sick

392
00:47:29,988 --> 00:47:35,016
So send her home quickly

393
00:47:37,663 --> 00:47:42,430
She likes to hold hands,
so do it often

394
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,761
My beloved friend, Ji-hwan

395
00:47:48,206 --> 00:47:57,046
Today I feel like eating the
instant noodles you made for me

396
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,913
Change into this

397
00:48:05,857 --> 00:48:12,164
Dad, you're really handsome,
but there's something missing

398
00:48:12,164 --> 00:48:15,930
What is?

399
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:19,231
- Dad, come here
- Yes

400
00:48:20,138 --> 00:48:22,800
- Stay still
- Yeah

401
00:48:49,568 --> 00:48:55,598
Hi, Ji-hwan.
It's Kyung-hee

402
00:48:58,076 --> 00:49:00,840
I'm alone right now

403
00:49:01,413 --> 00:49:04,905
My dad suddenly
had to go to Seoul

404
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,980
You better not laugh at this

405
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:16,460
When I go away,

406
00:49:17,396 --> 00:49:22,493
I told him I wanted a beautiful
funeral like in the movies

407
00:49:23,101 --> 00:49:28,232
It'll probably cost a lot
since I wanted a fitted dress

408
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:35,614
I wanted to look pretty
for people one last time

409
00:49:35,614 --> 00:49:38,708
Especially you

410
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:42,611
I'm worried about
your company test

411
00:49:42,888 --> 00:49:47,382
Since you came to see me often,
you didn't have much time

412
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:54,299
It was awkard and silent
between us,

413
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:59,327
but I was happy, thinking about the old days.
How about you?

414
00:50:00,672 --> 00:50:04,768
I did, too

415
00:50:05,777 --> 00:50:10,043
I think I'm a very lucky girl

416
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:15,443
All I have are happy memories

417
00:50:17,189 --> 00:50:22,525
Soo-in, who made me
laugh all the time

418
00:50:25,163 --> 00:50:30,294
And for making me realize how
wonderful taking pictures are,

419
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,902
my beloved Ji-hwan

420
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:44,115
Ji-hwan, a nice gentleman

421
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:47,647
who accepted my awkward kiss

422
00:50:49,754 --> 00:50:54,885
This is embarrassing,
but I really liked it then

423
00:50:55,794 --> 00:50:59,821
I want to erase this line

424
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:02,761
Forget it, I'm too tired

425
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,569
Coming to my funeral, right?

426
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:16,078
You have to come.
Since I miss you as well

427
00:51:16,348 --> 00:51:18,650
If a single guy
doesn't show up,

428
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:23,246
people will feel
really sorry for me

429
00:51:24,156 --> 00:51:33,155
Oh yeah, I have something to tell you.
You might get angry at me

430
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:39,803
Remember that letter
for Soo-in?

431
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,973
I ripped it up

432
00:51:45,343 --> 00:51:51,009
I feel better now
for telling you

433
00:51:52,184 --> 00:51:55,745
You'll forgive me, right?

434
00:51:56,054 --> 00:52:01,720
I'll tell Soo-in
when I meet her

435
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:08,224
Ji-hwan, I love you

436
00:52:10,268 --> 00:52:17,299
I loved you before
and I love you now

437
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:23,674
Good-bye, Ji-hwan.
Good-bye
