00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,858
Hey, Ji-hwan

9
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:10,725
Ji-hwan

10
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,694
yes

11
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,628
Can I have a ride to
Grand Park way junction?

12
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,428
Sure, get in

13
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,999
Working and studying
at the same time is hard, huh?

14
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,844
A little

15
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,681
You're gonna suceeed

16
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,942
At whatever you do

17
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,798
Is that you, Ji-yoon?

18
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,985
Can't you smoke
better cigarettes?

19
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,654
Even high school kids
don't smoke that

20
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,982
Or stop smoking
if you can't afford it

21
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,423
How are you such an expert?

22
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,587
By any chance...

23
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,061
Forget it

24
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,996
You have another
strange mail

25
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,040
No name, no address

26
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,234
Who keeps sending this?

27
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:10,372
It's cute

28
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,884
Smell something?

29
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,529
Yeah, smells like soap

30
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,868
I also want to kiss

31
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:42,212
5 years earlier

32
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,429
Start

33
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:13,675
One Two
Three Four Five!

34
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:19,348
Yes! Lee Ji-hwan!
New record!

35
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,422
You've finally did it

36
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,822
Ji-hwan, you're a...

37
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:09,066
Did you just take something?

38
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,333
No, it's nothing

39
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,440
Do you have
strawberry juice?

40
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:16,840
Yes

41
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,569
Then I'll take two, please

42
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,824
- Something wrong?
- No

43
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,463
Your eyes are really red

44
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,032
Soo-in, come inside!

45
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,528
What are you doing?

46
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,296
Just a sec

47
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,104
Wow, it's so nice

48
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,512
Chul-hyun, a girl called!

49
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,832
Hello?

50
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,232
Hello?

51
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,573
Ji-hwan,
you little bastard!

52
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,743
I'm hungry

53
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,981
- Again?
- Yeah

54
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:30,959
Excuse me

55
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:38,000
Mind if I sit with you?

56
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,918
Move over

57
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:03,166
I overheard both of you
talking earlier

58
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,567
The one with longer hair
Soo-in, right?

59
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,038
Yes

60
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:20,642
I'm Well, I'm not
very good with words

61
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,945
Soo-in

62
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,821
I fell in love
with you at first sight

63
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:39,902
Thanks for not laughing

64
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,136
Look so funny!

65
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,407
I'm going to the bathroom

66
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,238
- Kyung-hee
- I'm serious

67
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:51,577
Good luck

68
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,154
Let me be honest

69
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,793
I'm really sorry
for telling you this...

70
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,564
Ji-hwan Lee Ji-hwan

71
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,603
Yes

72
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:20,845
But you're making me
feel quite uncomfortable

73
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:28,883
uncomfortable, uncomfortable
Not comfortable

74
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,091
Here's a note for you
from that guy

75
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:47,830
What? What's that?

76
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,616
I turned the clock
back an hour

77
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,351
I turned the clock
back an hour

78
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,957
I wish you'd forget
everything I said

79
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,957
But if we run into
each other next time,

80
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,930
let's meet as friends then

81
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,479
I'm gonna leave for now,

82
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,281
but we'll meet again

83
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,584
We'll meet for sure

84
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,462
I'm Ji-hwan
Lee Ji-hwan

85
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,930
Remember my name, okay?
You're Soo-in

86
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,732
And you're...
What's your name?

87
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,167
Kyung-hee
Kim Kyung-hee

88
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,607
Right, Kyung-hee

89
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,440
Soo-in and Kyung-hee

90
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,910
Next time we meet,
we'll be friends, okay?

91
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,710
okay, see you later

92
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,228
Kyung-hee

93
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,360
Sleep over tonight

94
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,136
I snuck out,

95
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,203
so dad might get mad at me

96
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,465
Okay

97
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:30,866
Will it be okay with you?

98
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,876
Whose friend am I?
I'll just call home Let's go

99
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,786
I told you
not to be so nice

100
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,130
not to be so nice
wash mine anyway

101
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,194
What are you doing?

102
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,291
Oh, this?

103
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:02,172
I heard this makes
Your breasts bigger

104
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:03,766
Wanna try?

105
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:05,337
No thanks

106
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,870
It's too hard

107
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,607
I really hate doing laundry

108
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,182
But you're so nice

109
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,788
to do all the laundry

110
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,681
Since I'm always home,
I'd feel guilty if I didn't

111
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,151
It's also good exercise

112
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,575
Stop Gonna give me
clothes again, huh?

113
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:41,535
Yeah

114
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:46,444
Hey, am I some beggar?
I have plenty more than you

115
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,378
I know
But they're useless to me

116
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,658
Why?

117
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,788
Why are they useless?

118
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,125
They're too big for me

119
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,300
Why do I keep losing
weight doing nothing?

120
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,341
Sorry

121
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,606
Know that you're
more sensitive sometimes?

122
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,046
It's not that
I don't like your clothes

123
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,319
Look, our styles
are totally different

124
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,222
When I wear your clothes,
it feels awkward,

125
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,034
as if I'm wearing a g-string

126
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,632
Have you ever
tried on a g-string?

127
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,241
Yeah, just once

128
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,816
It was really weird

129
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,408
It was so gross
I couldn't walk

130
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,546
It was, huh?
And really tight

131
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,982
How can a movie not have
a single kiss scene?

132
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:01,552
No fun

133
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,833
You said you
kissed before, huh?

134
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,193
Of course

135
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:11,994
With whom?

136
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,132
Would you know if I told you?

137
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,064
Just a guy

138
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,744
What does it feel like?

139
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,009
A kiss?

140
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:29,315
First of all,
Your mouth gets really dry

141
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,147
And then right here

142
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,048
Hey!

143
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:37,893
Here
Your nipples get hard,

144
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,966
then you get
really lightheaded,

145
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,962
and your arms and legs go numb

146
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,405
It can't be explained

147
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:57,305
Anyway, it feels really awesome
I like kissing better than sex

148
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,515
Sex?

149
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,544
Stop lying

150
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,882
Think whatever you want

151
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,962
But you have a big problem

152
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,691
Guys don't like it
if you can't kiss right

153
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,329
- Want me to teach you?
- Hey!

154
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,063
You have to learn

155
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,568
Don't!

156
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,683
Doesn't my face look weird?

157
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,655
My nose is crooked
and there's a mole by my mouth

158
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,223
I hate it

159
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,998
You're so pretty

160
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,432
That's why guys can't resist

161
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,735
No, you're pretty

162
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,603
Really?

163
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,046
Look, we can see both of us

164
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,180
I wish we could always
be seen together

165
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,920
'96 Soo-in & Kyung-hee

166
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,396
Shoot! Goal!
Man, that sucked

167
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,798
What's the score?

168
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,696
One to one

169
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,646
Can we join you?

170
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,063
For a big match against Japan,

171
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,435
someone's got
the wrong attitude

172
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:14,385
Hey
Hey

173
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:21,048
Goal! Lee min-sung!

174
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:35,071
My senior classmate owns this place.
I just work here part time

175
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,337
We didn't go to college,
and are just hanging around

176
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,974
You see, we weren't
good at school

177
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,413
We even barely
finished high school

178
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,752
I'm an English Lit major,
and I'm taking a break

179
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,684
My dream is to travel freely

180
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,722
My dream is to never change
even as I get older

181
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,525
My dad treats me
like a baby still

182
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,527
Yeah, but he's
much better than mine

183
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,107
My dad always drinks

184
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,311
My dad was died when I was twelve

185
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,175
Don't take it so seriously

186
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,517
I'm fine with it

187
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,654
Because my father
is always here

188
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,958
Don't you miss him, though?

189
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,393
I have his pictures

190
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,795
My father loved to take photos

191
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,864
We probably have as many as
ten family albums

192
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:47,436
When we look at them
when relatives come over, they think we're strange

193
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,310
Since we have fun and laugh
at the pictures

194
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,680
But we're laughing
because we're happy

195
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,618
There's a photo of us
at the amusement park,

196
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,484
and one in front of our house
when we first moved in

197
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:06,429
There's even a photo
of all the family naked

198
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,763
Hey, that sounds like a lie

199
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,062
It's true

200
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,137
We took baths together
until I was nine

201
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,470
Oh, yeah

202
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,578
How did you come up with that clock idea?

203
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,326
There he is!

204
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,912
Ji-hwan got a haircut

205
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,131
Do you mind moving your foot?

206
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,572
What did you say?

207
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:58,910
You prick

208
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,212
Move your foot

209
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,740
My friend finds it
uncomfortable

210
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,316
Hey, let's move back

211
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,006
Thanks Ji-hwan

212
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:37,004
Hey, you're pretty brave

213
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,984
I'm shaking all over

214
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:14,717
I've fallen in love.
What should I do?

215
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,214
It's no big deal

216
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:25,887
No, it hurts so much.
But I want to keep on hurting

217
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,108
It's Ji-hwan!

218
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,716
Oh no, it's a cop!

219
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,387
Hold hands

220
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,688
One, two, three

221
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,366
Match the steps

222
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,509
Left, left, left...

223
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,218
Dad, did you see
the movie Il Postino?

224
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,691
Il Posit?
Is that really a movie?

225
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:31,418
You have to see it with mom.
It's very moving

226
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,667
I've fallen in love

227
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,866
What should I do?

228
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,602
It hurts so much

229
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,839
But I want to
keep on hurting

230
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,713
Mom, have you
ridden the Viking?

231
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,791
Do you mind
moving your foot?

232
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,189
My friend finds it
uncomfortable

233
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,999
I've fallen in love

234
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,372
It hurts so much

235
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:23,844
But I want to
keep on hurting

236
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,025
Man, it hurts

237
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,429
But I want to
keep on hurting!

238
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:07,189
Oh my, Ji-hwan!
It's been so long

239
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,217
How are you?

240
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,320
Ji-hwan,
you little bastard!

241
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,429
How've you been?

242
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,326
Good, of course.
I almost forget your face

243
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,370
Am I coming at a busy time?

244
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:24,237
You're the one
who's been busy, punk

245
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,178
What's this?

246
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,308
Your pictures

247
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,418
I put some I liked
in my room

248
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:36,445
It's okay, right?

249
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,018
Of course

250
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,720
Still taking pictures lately?

251
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:43,655
No

252
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,489
My camera is probably
rusted by now

253
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:52,928
Well, taking pictures
can't pay for your tuition

254
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,232
You know what?

255
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,434
I liked your pictures,

256
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,713
but I liked watching you
take them better

257
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,414
You look a lot better now

258
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,425
That rotten little...

259
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,627
When are you
getting married?

260
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,922
I want to
as soon as possible

261
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,398
But she said she doesn't
trust me still

262
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,444
'96 Soo-in & Kyung-Hee

263
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,876
Don't you miss them?

264
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,321
I sometimes think about them

265
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,952
Chul-hyun

266
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,355
What if...

267
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,164
If

268
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,593
What if they
had called to meet?

269
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:01,967
Did they call you?

270
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,801
They did, huh?

271
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,500
Not really

272
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,103
I'm not sure

273
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,747
What's that supposed to mean?

274
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,714
Should I meet them?

275
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,049
What's the problem?

276
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,726
Do you still
have feelings for them?

277
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,293
At first, as time passed

278
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,559
I thought of them

279
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:40,075
hundred times a day, then ninety-nine,

280
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:41,811
ninety-eight,

281
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,607
ninety-seven,

282
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,377
and then when
I forgot to count,

283
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:54,724
I was confused on whether
they had black or brown hair,

284
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,321
or if I had
really liked them,

285
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,298
or wonder if
we really did meet

286
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,270
I thought about those things

287
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,311
'96 Soo-in & Kyung-Hee

288
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:19,773
I'm gonna marry him

289
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:23,718
He likes you, too?

290
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,088
No

291
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,658
Yes, probably

292
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,357
He always recommends
love stories and poems

293
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,563
And he smiles at me always

294
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,073
Ji-hwan,
can you do me a favor?

295
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,122
He always eats a little

296
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,821
That's why he
doesn't gain weight

297
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,723
It's so irritating

298
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,465
Want me to just
talk to him, right?

299
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,528
Yeah

300
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,604
Hi

301
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,110
Hello

302
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,614
Need a book?

303
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,186
That's okay

304
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,222
I'll pick one out
myself today

305
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,288
He's my friend from church

306
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,158
Hello

307
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,222
Oh, hello

308
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,896
- You pick one out, too
- Okay

309
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,136
Excuse me

310
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,111
What's the most
popular book these days?

311
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,078
What kind of books
do you like?

312
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,483
Well, anything
that's easy to read

313
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,890
Have you ever read
Hu Sam-gwan's Blood?

314
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,626
I already read that...

315
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:12,221
So...

316
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:22,863
I heard that this book
is really good

317
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,466
- This one?
- Yes

318
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,773
- It's great
- What is it about?

319
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:32,305
It's like a detective story.
The author is German

320
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,718
His shoulders are wider
than I thought

321
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,248
I better change the size

322
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,084
Isn't he good-looking?

323
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:44,357
It seemed as if he
was jealous of you, too

324
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:48,554
But Ji-yoon,
we look so much alike,

325
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,365
so wouldn't he realize
that we were related?

326
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,533
Look at our nose and mouth

327
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,338
And when a guy knows
some girl likes him,

328
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,473
he'll stay distant,
even if he likes her

329
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,209
No, we don't look
alike at all

330
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,614
Your eyes are more slanted

331
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,383
And you have a
bigger head than me

332
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,389
It's hand-made

333
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,360
I'm not sure

334
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,638
Min-sik!
Come here for a sec

335
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,143
Have you ever
seen this letter?

336
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,305
Oh, this

337
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:13,884
Do you know it?

338
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,343
Absolutely no idea

339
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,281
There's no address and no name

340
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,222
Who'd sent it like this?

341
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,570
My name is Hang Min-shik

342
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,775
I deliver mail
in a small town

343
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,217
I've been delivering
these strange mails lately

344
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,057
This is her room

345
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,721
I'm in love with this girl

346
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,912
I don't understand

347
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:18,338
why she doesn't send these letters

348
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:28,357
But anyhow, I'm just a postman

349
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,793
She's taking
pictures again today

350
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:44,572
Holding back my wish
to scribble with you together

351
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,906
I told you I'm busy

352
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,636
Just one more question

353
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,740
Are your dreams
often colorful?

354
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:53,775
- No
- No

355
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,180
It's often for me.
Yes

356
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,714
Here are the results

357
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,752
Kyung-hee and I
are the same type

358
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,025
Someone who has one heart
to love only one person

359
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,395
Never cheats,

360
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,430
but due to obsessiveness,
you're likely to be a stalker

361
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:17,432
Fantastic.
One heart to love only one person

362
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,372
What about me?
What does it say?

363
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:25,438
Ji-hwan,
you're the most indecisive

364
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,341
Not any good as a lover

365
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:32,686
You imagine and decide on your own,
so you're left just liking the girl

366
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,818
If you do date,
you'll break a lot of promises

367
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,052
The worst of their kind

368
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,055
Do you believe that stuff?

369
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,093
That's girls for you

370
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,665
No need to get upset

371
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,642
Soo-in
Go help Ji-hwan

372
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,104
It'll be good exercise

373
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,615
Think so?

374
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,224
Ji-hwan,
what's your blood type?

375
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:14,054
Not again.
A type

376
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,844
Hey.
What are you doing here alone?

377
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,742
Oh, nothing.
Just hanging out

378
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,657
They're so lucky

379
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:55,302
Don't they look good together?

380
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,208
It's not easy to fall in love at first sight

381
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,346
It's so wonderful

382
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,186
Gonna stay over, right?

383
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,220
No, I got things to do

384
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:13,981
Like what?

385
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,252
I told you I gotta go

386
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:18,391
Kyung-hee

387
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,365
Why do you always ask favors,
and I have to carry them out?

388
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:29,564
Because you never asked me

389
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:31,599
Whatever

390
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,675
I'm tired of that face

391
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,409
Always pretending to be weak,

392
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,816
and as if the world will end
if you're not treated well

393
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,451
How long do you think
I'll be by your side?

394
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,591
Tell me.
Tell me!

395
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,000
Kyung-hee, I'm just...

396
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,103
Let's stop

397
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,429
I'm going, bye

398
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,816
Kyung-hee

399
00:39:55,793 --> 00:40:02,130
Just like you,
I don't know what to do

400
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,053
They came at
five in the morning

401
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,056
They ran away

402
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,196
because their parents disapproved

403
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,709
I'm going no matter
what you say

404
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,338
Your turn

405
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:01,016
I'm going no matter what,
so don't worry. Sorry dad

406
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:03,586
Good enough?

407
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,995
Here.
Be careful with it

408
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,678
Kyung-hee, it's our school

409
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,580
The gate has changed

410
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,945
Wow, it's been so long

411
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,620
I wish we could go inside

412
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,120
Me, Too

413
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,857
Just ask me,
and I'll do anything

414
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,686
This is so great

415
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,371
Stop!

416
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,367
3767! Stop!

417
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,763
Ji-hwan,
what are you doing?

418
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,671
Just a minute

419
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,217
Come on

420
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,012
Ji-hwan,
someone's down there

421
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,280
What?

422
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,753
Don't wait and
just let it all out

423
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,555
It's fertilizer anyway

424
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,596
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

425
00:42:54,038 --> 00:43:00,068
Oh... my god!

426
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,671
Sure we can see fireflies here?

427
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:10,880
Yeah. But I think we came too late

428
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,852
Thought they'd still be here

429
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,627
Hey,

430
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:21,160
let's call the fireflies

431
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:22,758
How?

432
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,595
I saw it in some book

433
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,300
If you close your eyes
and call them inside,

434
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,934
they'll know to come to you

435
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,003
I don't believe you

436
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,278
Hurry up.
I'm closing my eyes

437
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:52,413
It's cold!

438
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,565
Hey, how come you guys
are leaving me out?

439
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,671
Isn't she cute?

440
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,939
Yeah.
Sometimes

441
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,409
I want to press her down,

442
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:25,580
catch her,
and then put her in my pocket

443
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,786
Then take her out
whenever I feel bad

444
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:30,953
Me, too

445
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,023
Ji-hwan

446
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,861
Thanks for coming with us

447
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:44,569
If it wasn't for you,
we'd never go on this trip

448
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,804
You see,

449
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,775
we never went on a normal trip before

450
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,184
I'm more grateful

451
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:07,896
Wait,

452
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,525
where's Kyung-hee?

453
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,165
Kyung-hee?

454
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,066
Huh?

455
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:19,935
Kyung-hee!

456
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,780
Aren't those her shoes?

457
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:42,157
Kyung-hee!
Kyung-hee!

458
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:51,569
Kyung-hee!

459
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:56,136
I love you my friends!

460
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,642
Hey!

461
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,888
What are you doing here?

462
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,057
You're awake

463
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,957
Is Kyung-hee still sleeping?

464
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,465
Yeah

465
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:36,907
Didn't you two
sleep in your room?

466
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,709
Because of the mosquitoes,

467
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,677
we couldn't sleep

468
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,612
You must've been really tired

469
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,103
We tried to wake you up
several times

470
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,540
I see

471
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:01,086
Wanna talk about
our first love for fun?

472
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,129
First love?

473
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,261
It's better than
just sitting here

474
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:10,266
I like listening to
other people's love stories

475
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:12,867
Yeah?

476
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,535
Then you go first

477
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,045
um...

478
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:23,843
In junior high, this girl
worked at a comic book shop,

479
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,758
Because of her big eyes,

480
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,886
everybody seemed
to be attracted to her

481
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,857
She was really popular
among the guys

482
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,667
I went there everyday
to go see her

483
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,931
All the boys liked her
and came to the store

484
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,567
But one day

485
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:45,769
something happened
