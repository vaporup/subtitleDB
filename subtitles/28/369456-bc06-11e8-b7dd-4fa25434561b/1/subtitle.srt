1
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:06,683
We live on Fortune Shell Island
in Taiwan.

2
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:11,762
A hundred years ago there was
no TV here, no bars, no karaoke.

3
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:17,001
Just a small fishing village
in which a young couple lived.

4
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:22,958
They were in love. The kind of
love that feels like it's supposed to.

5
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:28,155
One day when the man was fishing
in the ocean, a storm sank his boat.

6
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:34,118
The woman saw it and shouted: "Bu!",
which is Mandarin for "No".

7
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:40,965
She dove into the ocean to rescue him,
and they were never heard from again.

8
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:45,723
Some say they found each other
in the afterlife.

9
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:48,037
Some say they turned into dolphins -

10
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:52,758
- because once they find a mate,
they never part.

11
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:00,243
Of all the dolphins on Earth, -

12
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:05,481
- only the ones on Fortune Shell Island
make the sound: "Bu!".

13
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:12,002
The man was swept out to sea. Some say
they're still searching for each other.

14
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:17,116
When you love someone and lose them,
you just keep searching.

15
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:20,163
How about that?

16
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:26,717
What do you guys know?

17
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:30,686
That story is so depressing.

18
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:36,478
- Mind your eavesdropping.
- Gee, sorry.

19
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:39,957
- Are you hungry, honey?
- No.

20
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:43,881
When I ask a question,
you might not always say "No".

21
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,402
You were the one who called me Bu, Ma.

22
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,240
I need a little help here.

23
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:54,601
Don't talk to our daughter
in so many different languages!

24
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:59,283
Look at her. Half the time she speaks
Taiwanese, half the time Mandarin, -

25
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:01,756
- the other half, she speaks English.

26
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:05,078
If you think it's so easy,
you raise her.

27
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:11,322
- Or keep it to yourself, Tubby.
- What did you just call me?

28
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:16,156
What did she just call me?
I want to know.

29
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:19,763
What did you just say?
Well, I'm on a diet.

30
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:44,042
Okay, you're done.
I learned it from a fashion magazine.

31
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:46,767
It's very stylish. Do you like it?

32
00:03:56,047 --> 00:04:00,359
Have you got a second?
Wait until you see what I bought you.

33
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:04,679
In my whole life,
I've never seen an oyster like this one.

34
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:08,123
- Any pearls?
- No.

35
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:15,446
- Looks like it's expensive.
- A hundred dollars.

36
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:22,044
- Thank you.
- I also have this.

37
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:27,884
My friend owns a wedding chapel.
He'll give us a discount. So I...

38
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:35,237
- Are you asking?
- No, just wondering if... I'm asking.

39
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:39,685
You got this gigantic oyster
because you want us to...

40
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:45,683
I bought this because the jewellery shop
was closed. Will you marry me?

41
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,798
Yes...

42
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,721
I'll consider it.

43
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:12,762
Why did you come
all the way from Hong Kong to marry Pop?

44
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:17,717
Your old pop was quite a hunk.
And a good cook, too.

45
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:32,680
- Did you like Hong Kong?
- I loved it. Especially the pot rice.

46
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:36,326
You don't really love Louis, do you?

47
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:42,476
May I give you a little advice
before it's too late?

48
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:45,366
You have to trust your heart.

49
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:08,963
Hi there, Buddy.
I've got some news for you.

50
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:12,726
Louis says he wants to marry me.

51
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:15,477
Cut it out!

52
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:20,922
I heard a story once.

53
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:25,524
Souls start out together,
but when they enter into the world, -

54
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:28,155
- they somehow get separated.

55
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:32,605
They continue to search on,
until they can find -

56
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:38,842
- who it is that they were
destined to go through life with.

57
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,923
What?
Bu! Where are you going?

58
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:14,358
"I'm waiting for you in Hong Kong.
Albert."

59
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,556
How romantic.

60
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:28,479
Excuse me,
I'm looking for a place to eat.

61
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:33,596
Can you write down the names of
some restaurants? Thank you.

62
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:46,960
- Taiwanese white trash.
- Don't be like that.

63
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:50,642
- You speak English?
- Yes. Surprised?

64
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:02,446
- Is this your first flight?
- You can tell?

65
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:08,159
Of course, I can tell.
Hong Kong is enormous, you can get lost.

66
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,237
I could show you around.
Manhattan Robert here. I know everyone.

67
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:17,366
Just ask around.
You could say I'm famous.

68
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:19,643
What do you say?

69
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:31,161
- What are you doing?
- Do you have a twin?

70
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,322
Excuse me a second.

71
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,845
"Gangster's girlfriend disappears."

72
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:48,400
- Good morning, Mr Chan.
- Good day. Wall Street moving today?

73
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:52,845
Yes, the Lion Fund borrowed heavily
from the interbank market.

74
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:55,202
They get a 20 per cent interest rate.

75
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:59,485
That could climb even higher
by morning.

76
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:05,843
Poke around a little. See if Lion Fund
has sold any Nikkei futures.

77
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:08,805
Then see if the yen is rising.

78
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:13,882
Check if Japan's naval base contract
with the U.S. Expires soon.

79
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:18,677
If all answers are positive,
I'll buy up every possible share.

80
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,886
Are you aware that Lion Fund
is run by two Nobel Prize winners?

81
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:25,561
It's a great formula, why doubt them?

82
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:27,399
I have my reasons.

83
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,082
They're greedy.
It's all on paper, their cash is poor.

84
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:35,001
It's time to make our move.
Go ahead and do it.

85
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:48,717
Order 100 roses and have them
delivered to Carmen. Attach this card.

86
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:54,086
- Didn't you two break up?
- We're still friends.

87
00:09:55,087 --> 00:10:00,161
You're a big boy. You should settle down
with someone soon.

88
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:04,678
- Impossible.
- With all those women?

89
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:10,001
- They're so beautiful and elegant, too.
- Too elegant for me.

90
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:13,637
Make sure you know the right girl
when you see her.

91
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,957
I'll know her.

92
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:17,686
Don't wait for me. Help yourself.

93
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:23,915
That bottle
floated all the way to Taiwan?

94
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:26,840
And you came here.

95
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:32,445
Hopped a ride to Hong Kong.
Romantic and endearing.

96
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,923
- There's news I need to break to you.
- Yes?

97
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:44,767
- One little detail you should know.
- What?

98
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,477
Listen.

99
00:11:55,967 --> 00:12:00,597
- No way!
- Oh yes, it's true.

100
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:03,839
- Come on, honestly?
- Yes, I swear.

101
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:10,281
- The note was to your boyfriend?
- Ex-boyfriend.

102
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:12,677
- But why?
- Because he broke it off.

103
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:16,601
- I mean, why are you gay?
- As if it's a choice.

104
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:21,881
- Well, you're a handsome guy.
- True. None the less.

105
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:31,521
All right!

106
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:36,203
"I'm waiting for you here."
That's how you got the idea.

107
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:39,439
I chose this apartment
because of the billboard.

108
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:47,725
I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.
You don't get seasick, do you?

109
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:05,883
Beautiful!

110
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,242
It's a good job.

111
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:22,600
You sounded nervous on the phone.
What's the emergency?

112
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:26,885
There's no emergency.
I just missed you. You don't miss me?

113
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,527
Sit down, I'll get you a drink.

114
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:35,960
Tell me what's going on.

115
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:41,163
Maybe you better go.

116
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:08,722
Such a shame.
You're boating and you didn't call me?

117
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:12,402
- Yet you're here.
- The papers say you're dating my girl.

118
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:17,198
You believe everything you read?
That's childish.

119
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,040
- Well, tell me: Are you?
- Yes.

120
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:27,921
You've been competing with me
for everything since we were kids.

121
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:32,157
Chan, come here.

122
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:37,155
I heard you're interested in my stocks.

123
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:40,558
I'm interested in many stocks,
not just yours.

124
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:45,642
My associates and I
hold all the controlling stock.

125
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:50,323
- No way you're taking over my company.
- Why not?

126
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:54,603
You're standing on my boat,
with my girlfriend.

127
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:57,156
You must have a death-wish!

128
00:15:57,327 --> 00:16:00,603
Maybe you can try to get to the point.

129
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:07,036
I think I deserve an apology.

130
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:13,237
You don't have to do it in front of them.
Call me five minutes after I've gone.

131
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:17,636
Five minutes.
You've got the time?

132
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:23,439
The little hand is on the six.
If your watch doesn't work, why wear it?

133
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,798
I like the diamonds. Genuine.

134
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:30,518
Guys, keep an eye on him.

135
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:35,442
If he doesn't call me in five minutes,
throw him right into the ocean.

136
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:38,679
Give him a life preserver.
Don't let him drown.

137
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,161
So long, Boss. See you.

138
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:58,437
Do yourself a favour.
Call him and tell him you're sorry.

139
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:04,842
- Hurry up. I've got a really hot date.
- You must want to go in the water.

140
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,883
Get the life preserver...
Let's go.

141
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:11,800
- I'm not interested.
- Don't fight it.

142
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:28,117
- Here's the life preserver.
- Hurry, he's drowning!

143
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,200
He's over there!

144
00:17:34,247 --> 00:17:36,044
Don't move.

145
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,795
Help him. Chan went that way.

146
00:18:30,647 --> 00:18:33,081
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

147
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:48,763
I'll call you.

148
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:59,477
Where is he?

149
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:10,198
I don't see him. Can you see him?

150
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:13,803
Are you okay? I'll go help the others.

151
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:19,039
Hey, I know you... He's over here!

152
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:22,003
He's in the back!

153
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,283
Help me, I'm drowning.

154
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:28,440
- Here, have a life preserver.
- Thank you.

155
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:35,040
- Does anybody see him?
- No.

156
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:50,238
Catch!

157
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:03,117
Wait, there he goes!

158
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,600
- He got away!
- The Boss gave us instructions.

159
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:16,999
Throw him into the ocean with
a life preserver and that's what we did.

160
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,317
Job done, let's go eat.

161
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:48,639
Thank you.

162
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:52,595
- Are you all right?
- You are...

163
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,078
I'm Bu.

164
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:02,605
- Are you escaping?
- Sure, why not?

165
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:07,045
- From Vietnam?
- Yes, that's right.

166
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,835
- How many are you?
- Just one.

167
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:14,237
Well, then who's driving?

168
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:32,397
- You want to give me a hand?
- I'm starving. I'm hungry.

169
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:37,595
- How about you?
- I'm not starving yet, but I am hungry.

170
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:50,484
Let's talk a little.
It'll help us forget that we're hungry.

171
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:53,525
What about?

172
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,838
About all the things you really enjoy.

173
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:03,721
Music, bowling, cars, women.
Nothing?

174
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:09,284
What are you smiling about?
It's so boring.

175
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:12,041
Let's talk about things you don't like.

176
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,482
I don't like nosey people.

177
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:30,399
Tell me what you don't like.

178
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:36,835
I don't like growing up.
Because you can't act spoiled.

179
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:42,127
- Did you say "soiled"?
- I said, "spoiled".

180
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:46,326
The more you're grown up,
the less people like you.

181
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:48,921
What do you like best?

182
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:55,165
Taking a shower when I'm really hot.
When I wake up to a fresh cup of coffee.

183
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,283
That sounds good.

184
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:08,242
- The stars in Hong Kong are gorgeous.
- The stars in Hong Kong?

185
00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:14,164
Stars everywhere are just as beautiful.
You just have to look up and see them.

186
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:19,525
What?

187
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:25,557
A shooting star! My Mum says you
should put your hands in your pocket, -

188
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:31,279
- make a wish, and it will come true.
Too bad I don't have any pockets.

189
00:23:31,447 --> 00:23:33,483
There's another one.

190
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:48,642
- What did you wish for?
- I'm not telling. It'll be bad luck.

191
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:55,847
You're a nosey body, aren't you?

192
00:23:59,847 --> 00:24:02,236
I'm so sleepy.

193
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:54,125
- Look, out there!
- What is it?

194
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:57,723
A boat! A boat!
Over here.

195
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:29,962
Busses don't go here and the authorities
check out ID. You want a lift?

196
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:34,405
That's okay. Just tell me where I am,
and I'll walk back myself.

197
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:39,243
No one lives around here.
We're in the middle of nowhere, Miss...

198
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:42,524
- My name is Bu.
- Boob?

199
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:45,804
- All right, just get in.
- Okay.

200
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:49,801
Wait, not you.
I was talking to her.

201
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:56,675
- I've noticed there's only two seats.
- Yes, here's 20 bucks.

202
00:25:56,847 --> 00:26:02,205
Walk straight ahead till you see a taxi,
or bum a ride on a boat, like I did.

203
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:24,524
Come in.

204
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:29,318
- You live here all alone?
- There's a butler.

205
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:34,481
- You're kidding. Must get real crowded.
- Have a seat.

206
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:37,844
- Can I look around?
- Yes, sure.

207
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:53,557
I'm hungry.

208
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:00,435
Oh, I'm so hungry.

209
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:42,763
- You need something?
- The fish food.

210
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,522
They don't need it,
they're virtual fish.

211
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:50,475
- Come here. Over here.
- Why do you have electronic fish?

212
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:53,844
I never have to change the water.

213
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:57,084
- What if the power goes out?
- I don't know.

214
00:27:57,247 --> 00:28:00,637
With this big house
you must have parties all the time.

215
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:04,641
- I don't have any friends.
- You must be lonely.

216
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:17,796
Now what?

217
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:20,037
You like to fight, huh?

218
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:23,722
Some like to play golf,
some like horse-racing.

219
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:26,640
I like boxing and fitness training.

220
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:30,880
- What's this octopus thing?
- Come on, let's go.

221
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:42,760
This should fit you.
You can change in there.

222
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:51,478
Behind there.

223
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:56,838
Hi, Betty.
I need a taxi.

224
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:59,521
Half an hour? Great.

225
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:29,679
I didn't mean in there.
There's a room behind the mirror.

226
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:34,805
I was afraid I'd get lost in there
and never find my way out.

227
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,877
- Are you hungry?
- Absolutely starving.

228
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:43,522
- Then let's eat.
- Do you have any Chinese pot rice?

229
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:45,325
What?

230
00:29:57,727 --> 00:30:02,596
- This is the best take-out food.
- I use this restaurant a lot.

231
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:07,682
- Such a nice kitchen and you don't cook?
- I don't like all the grease.

232
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:14,166
- Stop staring at me. Eat your lunch.
- Okay.

233
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:33,601
- Why are you smiling?
- I enjoy watching you eat.

234
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:42,120
- Are you rich?
- I guess so.

235
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:44,847
- How did you make it?
- Garbage.

236
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:47,919
- No, really.
- Buying and selling it.

237
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:50,237
Don't be that way.

238
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:05,207
- Do you happen to have a soda pop?
- How about juice? It's healthier.

239
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:30,965
Looking for Bu?
She just went down the elevator.

240
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:36,797
Your boyfriend is in these every week.

241
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:40,642
Each time pictured with a new girlfriend.

242
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:43,327
I'd call him promiscuous
and not cute.

243
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:48,686
Look at this. Let's hear it
from one of his ex-girlfriends.

244
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:54,326
"He doesn't know how to please me.
He doesn't say sweet things.

245
00:31:54,487 --> 00:31:57,718
And yet,
I'd say he's very romantic.

246
00:31:57,887 --> 00:32:01,323
He gets right to the point.
Always doing business deals.

247
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:03,682
And yet, he's just a kid.

248
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:07,635
He's very competitive.
He enjoys new things.

249
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:11,322
He never changes,
once he's made up his mind.

250
00:32:11,487 --> 00:32:14,638
With him... I feel very insecure."

251
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:19,039
- So. That means what?
- He likes new things, as in new girls.

252
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:22,244
Soon we'll be reading about you.

253
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:26,320
All those girls are just mean.
They were insecure to start with.

254
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:30,366
- I, on the other hand, am secure.
- Forget it.

255
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:35,604
Hong Kong is such a boring place anyway.

256
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:40,880
- Going home?
- No. C.N. is fun.

257
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:47,965
You don't even have him yet. You can't
just go up and take off your clothes.

258
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:51,642
- Do you think I'm like that?
- Do you think he isn't like that?

259
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:56,881
He likes girls, he's successful.
I have an idea, and it involves you.

260
00:32:57,047 --> 00:32:59,083
Count me out.

261
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:02,842
- Please?
- Fat chance.

262
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:07,597
Tell me where your daughter went.

263
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:11,481
Bu found a bottle
and went to Hong Kong.

264
00:33:13,487 --> 00:33:17,002
If Bu's here in Hong Kong,
I'll find her.

265
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:20,921
We checked out
Lo's Chemicals Manufacturing.

266
00:33:21,087 --> 00:33:23,681
Last year they had a 13 per cent growth.

267
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:28,045
The net profit was 130 million dollars.
The stock prices are 30 per cent higher.

268
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:29,879
Shall we keep going?

269
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:32,197
We've bought 16 per cent of the company.

270
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:36,599
Mr Lo and partners have a death-grip
on their 65 per cent and refuse to sell.

271
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:41,204
If we continue to raise the price,
the stock will become too high.

272
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:43,958
Sell all my shares.

273
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:49,161
If you sell all your shares at once,
the price will plunge.

274
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:53,286
If we sell low,
our company will suffer a loss.

275
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:56,678
Just do exactly as I told you.

276
00:33:58,527 --> 00:34:00,995
- I need to see K.K.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:05,080
- Who's K.K.?
- The head of Environmental Protection.

278
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,398
"You're a dead man."

279
00:34:44,807 --> 00:34:48,277
Going down?
Sorry, I'm going up.

280
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:53,077
- I'm meeting a friend on the top floor.
- This is the top.

281
00:34:54,207 --> 00:34:59,156
- Really? Oh yeah, she lives downstairs.
- Her name is?

282
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:02,046
Actually, it's a blind date...

283
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:08,766
This floor is nice.
I bet the rent is high.

284
00:35:08,927 --> 00:35:13,762
- Who made you write on my door?
- What do you mean?

285
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:23,121
Hey, look over there!

286
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:30,040
Don't move, or I'll break it.

287
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:32,323
Let go, let go!

288
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:35,763
- Why did you do it?
- Let go first.

289
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:39,037
Some handwriting, huh?

290
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:53,163
Cut it out!
I'm bad at kung fu, I'm just delivering.

291
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:56,603
- To me?
- Check the rear pocket.

292
00:36:05,007 --> 00:36:09,717
You big bully, now it's broken.
You'll hear from my lawyer.

293
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:11,878
Now read it.

294
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:14,963
"Gangster's Girl Missing."

295
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:22,559
- What happened?
- Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

296
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:28,165
No, with C.N. Did he buy the story?
Does he believe I'm the gangster's girl?

297
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:31,603
Who knows?
Do you think it'll work?

298
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:34,076
Of course it will.

299
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:37,842
- What do we do next?
- Get help from your buddies...

300
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:39,838
I mean, your boyfriends.

301
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:50,205
You're in big trouble, lady.
We'll chop you to pieces.

302
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:54,675
Make it good...
You're going the wrong way.

303
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:59,238
Your boyfriend is the mob boss of Taiwan.
Our boss hates your boyfriend.

304
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:02,444
So he told us to cut up your face...
Your turn.

305
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:06,566
If you don't believe us,
just read the newspapers.

306
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:09,161
Now everybody's looking for you.

307
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:14,077
It worked. He's riding over.

308
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:41,124
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. And you?

309
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:44,885
- It's you!
- Are you okay?

310
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:53,437
I'm not sure who those guys are...
Never mind.

311
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:25,282
What's the matter with you?
Don't let him see your face.

312
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:28,245
These guys are really good for actors.

313
00:39:34,887 --> 00:39:37,117
Stay away. I'll stab you.

314
00:39:37,807 --> 00:39:40,446
Let her go, or I'll stab myself.

315
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:42,916
You just cut yourself.

316
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:48,284
- We'll let you live.
- Let's get out of here.

317
00:39:48,447 --> 00:39:51,883
Don't chase them.
Let's go, before the cops get here.

318
00:39:52,287 --> 00:39:56,439
- Whose factory is this?
- We're okay here. I own it.

319
00:39:56,607 --> 00:40:00,077
- Why is it loaded with garbage?
- I told you, I buy trash.

320
00:40:00,247 --> 00:40:04,843
- It's worth a lot of money.
- I should tell my boyfriend about this.

321
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:08,605
First you told me you were a refugee.

322
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:12,646
Now you're
a Taiwanese mob boss's girlfriend.

323
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:16,880
- Are you really?
- Yes. A dangerous woman to be with.

324
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,845
- Are you afraid?
- I'm never scared.

325
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:23,682
You're not afraid
my boyfriend will kill you?

326
00:40:26,567 --> 00:40:29,957
How did you become
a gangster's girlfriend?

327
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,880
There's a police station near my home.

328
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:36,403
One day I saw these "wanted" posters.

329
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:41,083
One of them had these beautiful eyebrows
to go with these beautiful eyes.

330
00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:47,038
I went in every day and saw those eyes.
It was love at first sight.

331
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:52,002
- Then what happened?
- I got his address. Now we're together.

332
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:55,440
What was it you liked about him?

333
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:58,917
He had a lot of style
and was a great dancer.

334
00:41:00,687 --> 00:41:03,076
Very romantic.

335
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:08,203
- Dancing means romance?
- Like you're romantic.

336
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:10,597
I can dance.

337
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:16,238
- Like this?
- Yes.

338
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:19,322
How about tango?

339
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:23,916
Yes.

340
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:27,841
You're dull!
Don't you know any exciting dances?

341
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:31,443
- I know one.
- You mean it? Let's see.

342
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:35,286
- Don't be scared.
- No way.

343
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:40,437
Hands here... Jump up here.

344
00:41:41,687 --> 00:41:43,598
Here we go.

345
00:41:52,287 --> 00:41:54,926
- Pretty good.
- More.

346
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:58,762
- Not bored yet?
- No, you're lots of fun.

347
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:04,962
Just make sure you hold on tight.
Don't let go.

348
00:42:05,127 --> 00:42:07,402
- We'll be going pretty fast. Ready?
- Yes.

349
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:10,081
Put your hands here and jump.
1, 2, 3

350
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:25,636
Howie, the Exchange closed.

351
00:42:25,807 --> 00:42:30,676
It dropped a lot. Our stock took
a 20 per cent hit. Closed at 6.50.

352
00:42:33,327 --> 00:42:38,082
- What's the loss in assets?
- Ten million. Give or take a little.

353
00:42:38,247 --> 00:42:42,684
It's because Chan
is dumping off our shares.

354
00:42:42,847 --> 00:42:45,361
What about our investigation?

355
00:42:45,527 --> 00:42:50,647
If Chan's goal is to control the company,
he can't get rid of us.

356
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:54,999
Then why dump his shares
after buying so high?

357
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:59,445
It doesn't make sense anymore.
What's going on?

358
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:03,723
It's a scheme. What's he up to?

359
00:43:09,607 --> 00:43:12,485
- What happened?
- We ambushed Chan.

360
00:43:12,647 --> 00:43:15,684
- Is he hurt?
- No. Not a scratch on him.

361
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:20,079
That makes me feel better.
If something happened, I'd blame myself.

362
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:25,526
And if any of you men got hurt,
I'd be devastated.

363
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:30,001
- I'm feeling guilty already.
- It was your dad's idea.

364
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:32,965
My dad's? What was he thinking?

365
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:37,279
Ambushing my best friend.
Why don't we shoot him in the back?

366
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:41,599
- Pull the trigger, it'd be much faster.
- Ah, a sniper.

367
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:48,681
I'm kidding. It's too cowardly.
You guys have to call him out.

368
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:51,043
Smart, Boss.

369
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,998
I've got it.

370
00:43:56,447 --> 00:44:01,999
What we're gonna do is hire a fighter.
Stronger than Chan.

371
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:06,319
Also, he's smaller.
Someone from overseas.

372
00:44:06,487 --> 00:44:10,366
Someone he doesn't know.
He'll be disgraced.

373
00:44:18,207 --> 00:44:23,964
Come on, don't you know this signal?
It means: Take a hike, go away!

374
00:44:24,087 --> 00:44:25,918
Confusing.

375
00:44:35,087 --> 00:44:38,079
- Have you seen this girl?
- Yes.

376
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:40,398
- That's Mary.
- Mary?

377
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:43,957
- That's not Mary, that's Bunny.
- That's not Bunny...

378
00:44:44,127 --> 00:44:47,244
I'll show you where she is.

379
00:44:47,407 --> 00:44:50,479
- Put your glasses on.
- She's got short hair.

380
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:54,606
- What did you say to me?
- I told you to put your glasses on.

381
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:57,076
I have to go now.

382
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,641
Oh, my gosh! What is he doing?

383
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:30,877
This hadn't happened
if I'd shown him where Bunny lived.

384
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:39,884
Albert?

385
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:43,397
I'm such an angel.

386
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:51,076
Yes? What do you want?

387
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:54,796
- What the... Stop it!
- Where is she?

388
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:57,959
- Let go of me!
- You better tell me.

389
00:45:58,127 --> 00:46:00,800
Where's my Bu?
What did you do with her?

390
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:08,675
Where did you take her?
Bu and I are engaged.

391
00:46:44,687 --> 00:46:47,326
- What's this?
- Excuse me.

392
00:46:47,487 --> 00:46:52,003
This lady is so beautiful
she deserved some wind effect.

393
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:56,040
- You're gorgeous.
- I know.

394
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:08,561
Do we drink it?

395
00:47:08,727 --> 00:47:11,082
Yes. It's a 1982.

396
00:47:15,527 --> 00:47:19,645
That's not all.
I can tell something else by tasting it.

397
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:23,798
The grape picker was born in 1960.

398
00:47:25,687 --> 00:47:27,678
Let's order.

399
00:47:30,207 --> 00:47:32,084
I'll do it.

400
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:35,562
Do you make Chinese pot rice?

401
00:47:38,127 --> 00:47:42,245
- Just kidding.
- You had me worried.

402
00:47:44,847 --> 00:47:49,284
Do you always eat
with so many people watching you?

403
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:52,477
Tell those guys they can leave now.

404
00:47:57,447 --> 00:47:59,802
Excuse me.

405
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:05,158
- How come there's no one else eating?
- I bought the restaurant.

406
00:48:05,327 --> 00:48:10,526
Then I can't see any stars!
Without celebrities it's a bore.

407
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:15,807
Why do you hate crowds? They're just
people. You really don't have friends?

408
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:22,762
But I have enemies.

409
00:48:28,207 --> 00:48:33,804
Why did you dump my company's stock
and drive the price so low?

410
00:48:34,527 --> 00:48:38,884
I'm in the middle of dinner.
I'll call you later.

411
00:48:39,047 --> 00:48:43,882
Tell me why? I'm losing money,
and you're not doing too well, either.

412
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:47,164
Please leave. The restaurant is closed.

413
00:48:47,327 --> 00:48:51,559
- Sir, you appear to be a smart guy.
- You might say that.

414
00:48:51,807 --> 00:48:56,164
You must have a lot of time.
Why not use it to save your company?

415
00:48:56,327 --> 00:49:00,525
- And leave now, okay?
- Tell me who you are.

416
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:04,441
I'm a guest,
and I'm appalled at your behaviour.

417
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:08,919
We're trying to enjoy a dinner for two,
and you're disturbing our meal.

418
00:49:12,247 --> 00:49:16,240
- Let's talk.
- We talked already.

419
00:49:18,087 --> 00:49:20,237
Outside.

420
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:26,561
When will you get it?
That sign means, "follow me"!

421
00:49:26,727 --> 00:49:28,683
Confusing.

422
00:49:32,527 --> 00:49:34,563
I like your attitude.

423
00:49:34,727 --> 00:49:38,606
It's nothing.
Being around gangsters and all...

424
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:43,237
You have to go?

425
00:49:44,407 --> 00:49:47,877
Yes. I'll be right back. Excuse me.

426
00:49:59,487 --> 00:50:01,523
Be careful.

427
00:50:10,087 --> 00:50:12,043
Watch your back.

428
00:50:15,087 --> 00:50:19,160
I cleared it with your boss.
You can close up the parking lot, too.

429
00:50:19,327 --> 00:50:21,841
Then you guys can just take off.

430
00:50:22,007 --> 00:50:25,795
We'll have a little fun.
Don't worry, I'm footing the bill.

431
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:28,322
You heard Mr Lo. Move out.

432
00:50:29,647 --> 00:50:31,797
Mr Chan, have fun.

433
00:50:33,207 --> 00:50:35,641
Howie, what's going on here?

434
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:40,642
I want you to meet someone.
I invited him from overseas.

435
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:44,163
Ladies and gentlemen: Alan!

436
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:53,245
Alan here is undefeated
in a very tough weight class.

437
00:50:53,407 --> 00:50:57,798
Alan will fight you, one on one,
on behalf of me.

438
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:02,795
Why don't I fight you?
We're not the same weight class.

439
00:51:02,967 --> 00:51:06,755
- I'd have to much of an edge.
- That's the point.

440
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:11,045
If you lose to a short guy,
it would be humiliating.

441
00:51:12,007 --> 00:51:14,601
Act like an adult.

442
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:05,317
You have no choice.

443
00:52:06,647 --> 00:52:10,606
- You're going to use gloves?
- Do you think he's a street fighter?

444
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:14,840
- I don't want him dead.
- If he hits with a glove, it won't hurt.

445
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:20,001
No? Have him hit you with a glove.
Tell me if it hurts.

446
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:32,923
Try to knock me down any way you can.
But no dirty tricks.

447
00:52:35,287 --> 00:52:38,802
They say you're a great fighter...
Come on.

448
00:52:40,687 --> 00:52:44,566
Look! They will not let you leave
without a fight.

449
00:52:49,927 --> 00:52:52,282
You asked for it.

450
00:52:52,447 --> 00:52:54,642
- Ready?
- Of course.

451
00:52:57,327 --> 00:53:01,081
- Alan is losing to him.
- No, he's just testing him.

452
00:53:01,247 --> 00:53:03,886
He wants to see how hard he can punch.

453
00:53:28,487 --> 00:53:34,323
- Why is he changing gloves?
- He's giving C.N. a little advantage.

454
00:53:34,487 --> 00:53:37,047
He knows his punches are too soft.

455
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:46,521
I've come a long way.
I don't want a short game.

456
00:53:49,007 --> 00:53:53,478
Every boxer fights to their own music.
Provides the rhythm for their footwork.

457
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:57,720
C.N. Has no rhythm.
His footwork is a mess.

458
00:54:02,327 --> 00:54:06,286
- Look at Alan's controlled rhythm.
- You sound like an expert.

459
00:54:06,447 --> 00:54:08,403
Why don't you box?

460
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:12,003
C.N. and I used to box,
but I always lost.

461
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:15,045
I thought, I'd go into announcing.

462
00:54:15,207 --> 00:54:19,997
- You like that better than boxing?
- Yes. Talking, I sound invincible.

463
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:24,046
In the ring, I'm like you...
Mostly useless.

464
00:54:30,287 --> 00:54:34,599
C.N. used to have brilliant moves.
What happened?

465
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:40,877
He's concerned with other things,
like buying stocks. He'll lose.

466
00:55:08,487 --> 00:55:12,844
C.N. seems like he's distracted.
That's why he's going down.

467
00:56:13,807 --> 00:56:16,879
Good hit... But not enough power.

468
00:57:13,967 --> 00:57:16,356
Are you okay?

469
00:57:16,527 --> 00:57:18,438
You win.

470
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:25,077
- You deserve it. We win!
- While he's down, let's kick him.

471
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,317
What do you say, Boss?

472
00:57:30,007 --> 00:57:34,523
How many times have I told you?
Real men fight fair, not like cowards.

473
00:57:34,687 --> 00:57:38,839
Do you think there's honour
in kicking a man when he's down?

474
00:57:41,847 --> 00:57:43,838
You're good.

475
00:57:46,007 --> 00:57:48,077
Let's go.

476
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:55,806
My job is done. He's good.

477
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:05,763
Are you okay?
He didn't hurt you too bad, did he?

478
00:58:05,927 --> 00:58:08,885
You must be delighted that I lost.

479
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:11,965
It might look like that, but I'm not.

480
00:58:15,687 --> 00:58:17,917
Do you need to call anyone?

481
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:23,003
Forget it.

482
00:58:26,887 --> 00:58:29,526
Call me. Take care.

483
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:05,002
- You didn't leave?
- You said that I should wait.

484
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,556
I came down to look for you.

485
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:15,276
- They used tricks and outnumbered you.
- No, it was one on one. I really lost.

486
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:21,083
All right, so you lost.
You'll get used to it.

487
00:59:21,247 --> 00:59:26,799
Just kidding. Train hard, then, when
you're ready, go back and beat them.

488
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:31,446
I do have to train.
But not to beat up people.

489
00:59:31,567 --> 00:59:37,722
- Why else would you train?
- For a strong body and a sharp mind.

490
00:59:38,847 --> 00:59:44,285
- I haven't trained in a long time.
- But your gym is huge! What a waste.

491
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:48,406
- Is it just for show?
- I just hate to train alone.

492
00:59:50,647 --> 00:59:53,798
Okay, I'll train with you then.

493
00:59:55,247 --> 00:59:59,763
- Why are you being so nice?
- Because you're rich.

494
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:06,160
See how nice you look when you laugh.
Out there you looked so grumpy and sad.

495
01:00:07,087 --> 01:00:11,205
That's probably the reason you lost.
See? Nice laugh.

496
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:16,558
You know, you don't need
make-up and fancy clothes.

497
01:00:18,967 --> 01:00:22,721
Can you take tomorrow off?
Just say yes.

498
01:00:22,807 --> 01:00:25,799
- First tell me what we'll do.
- Just say yes.

499
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:29,084
- Okay. What'll we do?
- Have fun.

500
01:03:11,447 --> 01:03:14,837
- Are we in love?
- Huh?

501
01:03:15,007 --> 01:03:20,604
- I think you're really nice.
- I'm in love, it's your turn to say it.

502
01:03:20,767 --> 01:03:24,282
I'm waiting for an answer.
Here's how it works.

503
01:03:24,447 --> 01:03:26,756
You can just tell me -

504
01:03:26,927 --> 01:03:29,964
- in four words... or less:

505
01:03:30,127 --> 01:03:33,119
I love you... I don't love you.

506
01:03:53,447 --> 01:03:55,438
When did you get back? What is it now?

507
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:59,885
I'm confused. I think I'm in love.

508
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:05,241
Love is just a state of mind.
More fantasy than truth.

509
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:10,800
Love is like a radiant dream
that quickly turns into a nightmare.

510
01:04:12,207 --> 01:04:15,643
Albert, you're such an inspiration.

511
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,485
- I have news for you.
- What?

512
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:24,236
- Your boyfriend Louis is here.
- What?

513
01:04:24,407 --> 01:04:28,764
He tried to strangle me. Fortunately,
I'm strong enough to fight him off.

514
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:31,043
He's been drunk ever since.

515
01:04:31,207 --> 01:04:36,884
- I think I really let him down.
- We're talking about love, not pity.

516
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:40,403
The worse you are to him,
the better off he is.

517
01:04:40,567 --> 01:04:45,038
Until you figure out your feelings
for Chan, don't let him see you.

518
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:53,244
Good morning, how about a Bloody Mary?

519
01:04:53,407 --> 01:04:55,875
- Let go of me.
- Where are you going?

520
01:04:56,047 --> 01:04:58,481
- To the kitchen.
- No! Wait.

521
01:05:02,647 --> 01:05:06,925
- I need, I need...
- What are you looking for?

522
01:05:07,087 --> 01:05:10,796
- A bottle-opener.
- I'll get you a glass.

523
01:05:12,207 --> 01:05:16,723
- Here, take two.
- How am I going to open it?

524
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:35,246
- Bu, this is crazy.
- Okay, I'll tell C.N. the truth.

525
01:05:35,407 --> 01:05:40,322
If you tell him now, you'll ruin it.
He'll move on to the next girl.

526
01:05:40,447 --> 01:05:44,360
You're wrong.
C.N. is not that kind of guy.

527
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:48,361
He took a day off to be with me.
It was a perfect day.

528
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:54,318
When he's not around I miss him
day and night. I'm the only girl for him.

529
01:05:54,487 --> 01:05:57,684
I love C.N. and I know he's in love, too.

530
01:05:57,847 --> 01:06:00,156
Sure sounds like love to me.

531
01:06:02,887 --> 01:06:05,720
- What is it?
- I want sake.

532
01:06:05,887 --> 01:06:10,358
- You haven't even finished your wine.
- No! I want sake, I want sake!

533
01:06:12,287 --> 01:06:14,437
Don't go away.

534
01:06:16,207 --> 01:06:18,960
Oh, excuse me. Thank you.

535
01:06:19,927 --> 01:06:22,202
Here it is.

536
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:30,843
- Do you want to sing with me?
- What do you think this is? Karaoke?

537
01:06:31,007 --> 01:06:33,441
Let's drink our sake. Here's to Bu.

538
01:06:33,607 --> 01:06:37,759
- It's too much.
- You want more? Allow me.

539
01:06:38,727 --> 01:06:44,359
- Here's to my health.
- Be careful, you'll get drunk.

540
01:06:47,527 --> 01:06:49,916
Well, bottoms up.

541
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:55,436
You need some sleep.

542
01:07:15,447 --> 01:07:19,281
I've got her with me here.
She's all right.

543
01:07:22,127 --> 01:07:25,039
Sure, you can talk to her.

544
01:07:35,887 --> 01:07:41,644
- Gloria, this is Bu. Gloria's a friend.
- Oh, you're my new look-alike.

545
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:44,162
I can see it.

546
01:07:47,967 --> 01:07:51,118
You knew it all along, didn't you?

547
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:56,439
- You lied.
- You started it.

548
01:07:58,807 --> 01:08:02,516
You loved me, so I loved you back.

549
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:05,997
Was that a lie, too? Or was that real?

550
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:12,276
Our happiness was real.
If you like Hong Kong, why not stay?

551
01:08:13,807 --> 01:08:18,483
So, why am I here?
So I can just be one of your girls?

552
01:08:23,047 --> 01:08:27,199
The note in the bottle said
to go to Hong Kong right away.

553
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:31,360
I thought this fairy tale was real.

554
01:08:31,487 --> 01:08:33,921
You changed the ending.

555
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:47,843
C.N., you've got
some important information.

556
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:51,966
The government passed a law
prohibiting the use of styrofoam.

557
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:56,803
Howie Lo's stock
dropped dramatically. It's worthless.

558
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:02,645
All stockholders sell off their shares.
You knew the law would be passed.

559
01:09:02,807 --> 01:09:05,321
Why didn't you inform us?

560
01:09:05,487 --> 01:09:10,322
- It was just a matter of time.
- The project waits for your decision.

561
01:09:10,487 --> 01:09:12,682
That'll be all.

562
01:09:35,287 --> 01:09:38,279
- What's wrong?
- I'm okay.

563
01:09:53,367 --> 01:09:55,244
What?

564
01:09:58,447 --> 01:10:00,756
It's for you.

565
01:10:30,407 --> 01:10:34,195
"Nothing can change a man like love.

566
01:10:35,207 --> 01:10:39,246
For he's going nowhere.
And yet, so far."

567
01:10:41,247 --> 01:10:46,275
- Meaning what?
- Going nowhere, and yet, so far.

568
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:51,478
- Yes, I heard you. It means?
- I don't know.

569
01:10:53,247 --> 01:10:57,559
I've been with you so long,
and I never saw you like this.

570
01:10:57,727 --> 01:11:02,118
Garbage tossed about.
Try moving forward.

571
01:11:02,247 --> 01:11:05,557
- Leave me alone.
- Move on.

572
01:11:05,687 --> 01:11:07,882
- Beat it.
- Be strong.

573
01:11:08,047 --> 01:11:10,197
I don't want to listen to you anymore.

574
01:11:12,087 --> 01:11:16,763
Fine, I can take a hint.
You don't have to tell me twice.

575
01:11:18,327 --> 01:11:21,922
- How did you get in here?
- We broke in.

576
01:11:22,087 --> 01:11:23,964
Call the police.

577
01:11:24,127 --> 01:11:28,245
- I don't think they'll let me call.
- I bet they will.

578
01:11:34,687 --> 01:11:37,759
- I told you so.
- You guys beat it.

579
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:41,044
You ruined our boss's life.
We lost our jobs.

580
01:11:41,207 --> 01:11:43,243
You're the reason why!

581
01:11:44,887 --> 01:11:49,563
Mister Chan...
I heard you're back in training.

582
01:11:49,727 --> 01:11:53,436
- Yes I am, but not because of you.
- Rematch?

583
01:11:53,607 --> 01:11:58,362
- Mr Lo sent you here?
- Mr Lo's broke. It's not about the money.

584
01:11:59,207 --> 01:12:02,597
- Not now.
- You've got no choice.

585
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:11,362
- You really enjoy fighting, don't you?
- Only with the best.

586
01:12:17,887 --> 01:12:23,644
- Here we go again. I hate this part.
- You don't know much about boxing, huh?

587
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:26,560
Do you know why they do this?

588
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:31,918
Okay.

589
01:12:36,767 --> 01:12:39,201
- Rules?
- No rules.

590
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:44,122
Anything goes. But no dirty tricks.

591
01:12:52,527 --> 01:12:54,518
You like white.

592
01:13:03,727 --> 01:13:07,163
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

593
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,683
Good training.

594
01:15:19,447 --> 01:15:21,483
Wait, wait...

595
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,278
What is it?

596
01:15:43,447 --> 01:15:47,884
- Can I ask him if he's okay?
- If you insist.

597
01:15:48,047 --> 01:15:50,163
Are you okay?

598
01:15:51,087 --> 01:15:52,918
Okay. He's okay.

599
01:16:09,927 --> 01:16:11,838
Pretty good.

600
01:16:12,938 --> 01:16:13,438
I'm coming.

601
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,500
Ready?

602
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:46,800
C'mon!

603
01:17:51,007 --> 01:17:52,998
"Just smile."

604
01:18:00,287 --> 01:18:04,200
See how nice you look when you laugh.
You looked so grumpy and sad.

605
01:18:04,367 --> 01:18:09,157
That's probably the reason you lost.
See? Nice laugh.

606
01:18:28,887 --> 01:18:30,878
Are you ready?

607
01:19:50,807 --> 01:19:52,843
Don't worry, be happy.

608
01:20:27,047 --> 01:20:28,639
Let's dance.

609
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:49,845
Hey, let's finish...

610
01:22:07,087 --> 01:22:09,123
Hey, come on! Get up!

611
01:22:09,287 --> 01:22:12,279
Sir, are you all right? Up, up, up!

612
01:22:16,927 --> 01:22:19,236
Sir, are you hurt bad?

613
01:22:28,327 --> 01:22:32,115
- I'm okay.
- You did it. You won!

614
01:22:32,287 --> 01:22:34,676
- I lost.
- Why?

615
01:22:34,847 --> 01:22:39,079
If we were in the same weight class,
he would have won easily.

616
01:22:39,247 --> 01:22:41,363
See if he's all right.

617
01:22:42,727 --> 01:22:47,437
- Why do you smell like gas?
- Boss is setting fire to the factory.

618
01:22:47,607 --> 01:22:49,120
That's excellent.

619
01:22:49,647 --> 01:22:52,719
We'll be arrested for arson,
if we're here.

620
01:22:53,567 --> 01:22:57,799
- This is dangerous. Be careful, Boss.
- It's okay.

621
01:22:57,967 --> 01:23:02,404
If I get caught,
I'm going to jail for sure.

622
01:23:05,487 --> 01:23:10,003
- You made sure everyone's out?
- They're all gone.

623
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:15,560
Deliver this to my father.
Tell him I love him a whole lot.

624
01:23:15,727 --> 01:23:20,847
Give this one to C.N.
Tell him I hate him a whole lot.

625
01:23:21,487 --> 01:23:26,481
Give this one to the authorities.
It blames the fire on me.

626
01:23:26,647 --> 01:23:29,923
Really? You're going to jail, not me?

627
01:23:33,527 --> 01:23:37,805
I'm not going to jail, either.
Stand aside.

628
01:23:38,487 --> 01:23:43,003
- I'll burn your factory to the ground!
- Don't do it, Boss!

629
01:23:43,167 --> 01:23:47,763
I burned my eyes.
I'll die anyway.

630
01:23:48,327 --> 01:23:53,037
So what if I can't see?
I love you, Mary!!

631
01:23:56,767 --> 01:24:02,319
- Howie, what are you doing here?
- C.N. It's all your fault.

632
01:24:02,487 --> 01:24:05,638
You took it too far. My father
kicked me off the board of directors.

633
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:10,517
I have nothing now. Nothing!

634
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:14,799
- What about us?
- What'll we do without you?

635
01:24:16,207 --> 01:24:18,118
Shut up!

636
01:24:22,287 --> 01:24:24,881
- Warmer?
- Yes.

637
01:24:25,047 --> 01:24:28,039
- Okay?
- That's good.

638
01:24:28,207 --> 01:24:31,358
Are you still blind?

639
01:24:31,527 --> 01:24:35,566
You're a good man.
Better than I was.

640
01:24:35,727 --> 01:24:40,801
Styrofoam is bad for the environment.
That's why I wanted to shut you down.

641
01:24:40,967 --> 01:24:45,245
But we can still be partners.
We can team up together.

642
01:24:45,407 --> 01:24:49,241
We can open up a recycling centre.

643
01:24:49,407 --> 01:24:51,921
How come you're doing this?

644
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:55,318
When we were in school together,
you had to get higher grades.

645
01:24:55,487 --> 01:25:01,164
You were always more athletic.
You had to have every girl I liked.

646
01:25:01,327 --> 01:25:05,798
As soon as you saw them once,
you never saw them again. I hated you.

647
01:25:06,127 --> 01:25:09,164
- I hated you.
- What for?

648
01:25:09,327 --> 01:25:13,445
For laughing.
For being born so wealthy.

649
01:25:13,607 --> 01:25:18,362
It was all given to you.
I had to work for everything I ever had.

650
01:25:18,527 --> 01:25:22,600
What I really hated was that
you stole the love of my life, Carol.

651
01:25:22,767 --> 01:25:26,442
That was in second grade! Carol?!

652
01:25:29,847 --> 01:25:33,362
I heard she married a guy,
what was his name...

653
01:25:33,527 --> 01:25:36,644
- Oh, Bob. No... Fred.
- Fred!

654
01:25:37,447 --> 01:25:40,803
A major moron. He was so dumb.

655
01:25:45,287 --> 01:25:49,599
After so many years,
neither one of us has found a girl -

656
01:25:49,767 --> 01:25:51,997
- we really truly loved.

657
01:25:52,167 --> 01:25:56,126
- You said before: "I love Mary."
- You're crazy.

658
01:25:56,287 --> 01:26:02,203
Hold on a minute. You were engaged.
What happened to her?

659
01:26:02,367 --> 01:26:05,165
Don't bring it up. I got cold feet.

660
01:26:07,247 --> 01:26:11,923
But Mary was a great girl.
We laughed a lot.

661
01:26:12,087 --> 01:26:15,966
All day long.
You should hear her laugh.

662
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:18,766
It was great.

663
01:26:18,927 --> 01:26:22,522
I wish I could turn back the clock.

664
01:26:22,687 --> 01:26:26,600
She moved away
when I broke off the engagement.

665
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:30,726
I don't know where she went.
I never found her.

666
01:26:32,247 --> 01:26:34,761
What's wrong with you?

667
01:26:35,887 --> 01:26:41,644
- I'm gonna find her.
- Who? Mary? You never even met her!

668
01:27:11,367 --> 01:27:13,881
Hey, Bu, I missed you.

669
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:17,683
How are you doing?

670
01:27:21,167 --> 01:27:24,557
What? Come back! Bu!

671
01:27:53,447 --> 01:27:55,563
"I miss you. C.N."

672
01:27:55,727 --> 01:27:57,763
What do you want?

673
01:28:02,487 --> 01:28:05,081
Go, you're not wanted here.

674
01:28:05,247 --> 01:28:08,000
- You hurt Bu.
- No, I didn't.

675
01:28:08,167 --> 01:28:12,922
She used to laugh. Now she's always sad
because of you. You took her grin away.

676
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:17,763
Now I'm sad, too.
That's not good. You've got trouble.

677
01:28:17,927 --> 01:28:22,045
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't do anything to her.

678
01:28:22,207 --> 01:28:25,404
Then why is she like this now?
Leave her alone.

679
01:28:25,567 --> 01:28:29,958
- Go home or I'll beat your brains out!
- Take it easy, please.

680
01:28:30,127 --> 01:28:32,960
You heard him. Get out of here!

681
01:28:39,967 --> 01:28:42,356
I warned you. Watch it!

682
01:28:57,407 --> 01:28:59,841
It'll be okay.

683
01:29:24,207 --> 01:29:27,597
I'll sit right here.
Just try to get past, jerk.

684
01:29:27,727 --> 01:29:30,685
Check out your dad. He's The King.

685
01:29:32,807 --> 01:29:35,480
Are you okay, sir? Let me help you up.

686
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:42,485
- Is your back hurt badly?
- She doesn't want to talk to you.

687
01:29:42,647 --> 01:29:45,957
- Let me talk to her, please.
- What would you say?

688
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:48,636
- Bu, listen, I...
- Stop it!

689
01:29:51,847 --> 01:29:54,122
- Bu.
- Shut up!

690
01:29:54,887 --> 01:29:57,447
- Bu.
- I said: "Shut up!"

691
01:29:57,607 --> 01:29:59,279
Bu.

692
01:30:00,087 --> 01:30:05,684
- I guess you just don't listen.
- You can kill me or let me talk to her.

693
01:30:09,087 --> 01:30:13,000
All right. You want to talk?
Come with me.

694
01:30:18,007 --> 01:30:21,682
It's now or never.
Well... Talk!

695
01:30:21,847 --> 01:30:26,716
- Let's go. Don't bother them.
- I want to hear what he says to her.

696
01:30:31,607 --> 01:30:33,962
Why come here?

697
01:30:36,727 --> 01:30:41,960
- You left your clothes at my house.
- I have a lot more.

698
01:30:47,007 --> 01:30:52,400
I know you like Chinese pot rice.
It got cold. You can just nuke it.

699
01:30:55,727 --> 01:31:00,198
You think old clothes and pot rice
will fix things?

700
01:31:02,567 --> 01:31:04,637
That's not all.

701
01:31:13,487 --> 01:31:18,117
- I've written a note in each bottle.
- Really? What did you write?

702
01:31:18,287 --> 01:31:22,439
I love you. I miss you.
All in four words or less.

703
01:31:22,607 --> 01:31:25,201
And I got writer's cramp.

704
01:31:26,087 --> 01:31:28,043
Why all the fuss?

705
01:31:28,207 --> 01:31:33,327
If you just stick a thousand dollars
in each one, you'd get my attention.

706
01:31:43,287 --> 01:31:46,359
Say out loud that you love me.

707
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:51,285
- Okay. I love you.
- When did you start?

708
01:31:51,447 --> 01:31:54,325
When you went through my wallet.

709
01:31:55,607 --> 01:32:00,078
That night on the boat when we saw
the star. What did you wish for?

710
01:32:01,207 --> 01:32:03,357
It just came true.

711
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:08,997
What are you crying about?

712
01:32:09,847 --> 01:32:13,760
- Leave them be.
- Hey, Don Juan! Kiss her!

713
01:32:15,527 --> 01:32:19,805
Don't just stand there wearing white.
Kiss her!

714
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:24,243
It's okay.

715
01:32:25,647 --> 01:32:28,081
Look over there.

716
01:32:38,727 --> 01:32:41,525
Are all the girls here so beautiful?

717
01:32:41,687 --> 01:32:45,760
Don't say it! I'll introduce you
to a friend. He lives over here.

718
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:47,838
Where?

719
01:33:07,287 --> 01:33:09,755
