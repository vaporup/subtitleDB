1
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,039
My name is Claireece "Precious" Jones.

2
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:23,711
I wish I had a light-skinned boyfriend
with real nice hair.

3
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,344
And I wanna be on the cover of a magazine.

4
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,787
But first, I wanna be
in one of them BET videos.

5
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:32,223
Momma said I can't dance.

6
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:35,785
Plus, she said, who wants
to see my big ass dancing, anyhow?

7
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:39,560
Well, if there's no volunteers,
then I'm going to have to call people.

8
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:43,468
Okay, Leticia, you got number one.
Leticia!

9
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:44,936
Jess Wesley, number two.

10
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,133
I like math.
I don't say nothing.

11
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:52,412
I don't open my book, even.
I just sit there.

12
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,038
- You down?
- Number six.

13
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:58,074
Every day I tell myself
something's gonna happen.

14
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,278
I'm... I'm dead serious.

15
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:01,719
Like, I'm gonna break through.

16
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,986
Or somebody's gonna break through to me.

17
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,724
I'm gonna be normal

18
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,730
and pay attention,
and sit in the front of the class.

19
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,993
Distributive principles...

20
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,158
Someday.

21
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,498
...are principles that
you can do in your head.

22
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,663
I like Mr. Wicher.

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,009
I pretend he my husband
and we live someplace like Westchester.

24
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,741
Look at him.
He like me, too, I know it.

25
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:34,284
I can tell by his eyes.
He always looking at me and smiling at me.

26
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,448
Boys! Boys! Boys!

27
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,752
I'm not your fucking boy!

28
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,951
You're disrupting the class.

29
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,460
Yeah, well, I'm talking now,
so you listen.

30
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:45,127
Shut the fuck up!
I'm trying to listen!

31
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,701
Mr. Wicher know I got his back.

32
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,662
One twenty-two.

33
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,333
Why are we barking, Jess?

34
00:02:56,877 --> 00:03:01,314
Monday's assignment.
I'm assuming everybody did it.

35
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,707
- No.
- No.

36
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:11,787
Please... Quiet.
Precious, get your things.

37
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,952
I have...
Come here for a second.

38
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,154
Now this shit.

39
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:18,221
Is there anybody
who didn't do their homework?

40
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:25,536
Why? These aren't requests.
These are requirements. Okay?

41
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,145
You have to go to the principal's office.

42
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,151
Go to the principal's office!

43
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:47,160
All right, that's enough. That's enough.

44
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,588
No, he's not allowed on campus.
Where was he seen?

45
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,596
Could you get Mr. Tork from Room 25,

46
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,100
tell him to go to Room 16 right away?
Thank you.

47
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,932
No. He was seen on the second floor.

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,764
Yes. Thank you.

49
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,034
Send Claireece in here!

50
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,271
She's ready for you now.

51
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,250
Mr. Taylor? Ms. Lichenstein.

52
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,052
Come in.

53
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,789
Matthew Williams, second floor.

54
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:22,926
In front of his locker.
Yes. Suspended last week.

55
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,859
Yeah.

56
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,595
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

57
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,568
Hello, Claireece.

58
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,374
Are youpregnant?

59
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:50,715
You're 16.
You're still in junior high school,

60
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,428
and you're pregnant with your second child.

61
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,657
Is that correct, Claireece?

62
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,402
Are youpregnant again?

63
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,075
What happened, Claireece?

64
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,842
I had sex, Ms. Lichenstein.

65
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:24,314
Do you have any other thoughts
about your situation, Claireece?

66
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,929
Claireece?

67
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,027
Am I in trouble?

68
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,633
Thank you.
I gotta get back to math.

69
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,799
Sit down, Claireece.
Sit down right now.

70
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,810
We should have a parent-teacher's
conference with you, me and your mother.

71
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,974
My mother's busy.

72
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,381
All right. Well then,
how about if I come to your house?

73
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,453
if I were you, I wouldn't.

74
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:56,217
I...
I'm going to have to suspend you.

75
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:00,383
That ain't fair! I didn't do nothing!
I do my work!

76
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,552
My grades is good!

77
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,562
Is something going on at home?

78
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:07,794
If something's going on at home,
I want you to tell me right now.

79
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,571
You get my cigarettes?

80
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:23,847
No, they didn't have it.

81
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,183
I played the number, though.
I couldn't box it.

82
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,683
Yes. Yeah.

83
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,350
Right there. Yeah.
Daddy loves you.

84
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,398
Precious, what did you think of the film?

85
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,626
I thought it was fabulous.

86
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:16,225
- What's next for you?
- What?

87
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,897
- How are you feeling?
- I feel great!

88
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,398
Just one more, just one more, quick!

89
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,103
I love you, too!

90
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,708
You know I love you!

91
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,373
Hey, boo!

92
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,888
I ain't gonna say it no more.

93
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:47,226
The door was open, so I let myself in.

94
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,668
Well, there goes my chance
to tell you I'm not home.

95
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,967
Now, Mary, this is important.

96
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,503
Now, come on, Mary,
she'll have a great time.

97
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:03,014
I'd enroll myself, but I became ineligible
for teen pageants a few days ago.

98
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:06,919
Yeah, I see your acne's cleared up.

99
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,153
You know, this pageant can do Brenda
a world of good, Mary.

100
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,920
And the man in charge, he's tops
in his field. A brilliant promoter.

101
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,094
How long have you two been dating?

102
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,624
A dance teacher.

103
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,504
Tell them assholes to stop ringing my bell.

104
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,264
I hate crackheads.

105
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,840
No one ever ring this bell
except for crackheads.

106
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,037
Why they fucking with us?

107
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,952
Stop ringing the goddamn buzzers,
motherfuckers!

108
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,182
Give the ghetto a bad name.

109
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,395
Stop ringing the goddamn buzzer!

110
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,236
Stop it!

111
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,138
Stop it!

112
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,569
press "listen," stupid.

113
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,753
It's Sandra Lichenstein
for Claireece and Ms. Mary Johnston.

114
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,759
Who is that, Precious?

115
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:23,353
White bitch from school.

116
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,433
What do you want?

117
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,432
Claireece, I want to talk to you
about your education.

118
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,214
Eighty-six that bitch.

119
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,041
My mother don't wanna get cut off welfare.

120
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,679
And that's just what this visit
gonna result in.

121
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,720
Ms. Lichenstein, get out of here
before I kick your ass.

122
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,058
All right, Claireece,
I spoke to Mr. Wicher,

123
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,963
and he told me
that you're one of his best math students.

124
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,035
If your fat ass don't get
that bitch away from here...

125
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,730
...like a, like a potential for math.

126
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,363
So I called Mrs. McKnight

127
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,570
from Higher Education Alternative
Each One Teach One.

128
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:13,573
It's an alternative school.

129
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,646
Claireece, are you listening to me?

130
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,284
Yeah.

131
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:22,253
Okay. Mrs. McKnight.
Each One Teach One.

132
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:28,326
It's located at the 11th floor,
Hotel Theresa, 125th Street.

133
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,296
- Get rid of that bitch.
- The semester started a few days ago,

134
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,422
so you're not too late.

135
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,057
Eleventh floor.

136
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,129
I heard you the first time.

137
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,266
Okay.

138
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:44,007
I don't know what an alternative school is,
but I feel I wanna know.

139
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,243
My heart is all warm inside.

140
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,743
Mr. Wicher think I'm a good student.

141
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:55,255
I knew that he liked me.

142
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,776
School ain't gonna help none!

143
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,370
Take your ass down to the welfare.

144
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:22,711
Who the fuck she think she is?

145
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,485
So I guess you think you cute now, right?
Uppity bitch.

146
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,547
You should have kept
your fucking mouth shut.

147
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,451
Just 'cause he gonna give you
more children than he give me,

148
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,793
you think you something fucking special?

149
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,856
Fuck you and fuck him!

150
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:45,635
Precious!

151
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,039
Precious! Precious!

152
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,670
Get down here, bitch!

153
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,146
You brought that white bitch up
in my house!

154
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,983
You...
Why would you bring that bitch up in here?

155
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,075
I didn't bring her here.

156
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,053
Well, why the fuck did she ring my buzzer?

157
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:04,885
I can't hear you, Precious.

158
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,017
Since you got
so much motherfucking mouth,

159
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,755
and you gonna bring a bitch up
in my house,

160
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,887
why would that bitch ring
my goddamn buzzer?

161
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,693
I didn't tell her to come here.

162
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:16,497
See, I think right now, you feeling
like you're becoming a grown woman.

163
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,401
'Cause of that shit you pulled
in the kitchen.

164
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:21,872
I should've fucked you up,
but I let you walk away,

165
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,876
and I let you come get yourself together.

166
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:27,004
But, bitch, I'm gonna let you know
if you ever pull that shit on me again,

167
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,605
that will be your last
motherfucking day standing,

168
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:30,705
I promise you that.

169
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,344
You gonna send a white bitch
to my motherfucking buzzer?

170
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,047
Talking about some higher education?

171
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:38,387
You're a dummy, bitch,
you will never know shit.

172
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,756
Don't nobody want you.
Don't nobody need you.

173
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,455
You done fucked around
and fucked my motherfucking man

174
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:45,464
and had two motherfucking children,

175
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,227
and one of them is a goddamn animal,

176
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:50,395
running around,
looking crazy as a motherfucker.

177
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,463
Bitch, you know what?
See, I think you... I think you're trying me.

178
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:59,078
I think you're really trying to fuck with me.
You're fucking with my money.

179
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,239
And you're gonna stand up there
and look down at me

180
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:02,907
like you're a motherfucking woman.

181
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,951
I'm gonna show you
what real women do, bitch.

182
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,486
See, you don't know
what real motherfucking women do.

183
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:09,556
Real motherfucking women sacrifice.

184
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,990
I should've aborted your motherfucking ass.
'Cause you ain't shit.

185
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,653
I knew it the day the doctors put you
in my goddamn hand

186
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,252
you wasn't a goddamn thing,

187
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,629
and you have that smirk
on your face, bitch?

188
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,428
Get it off your fucking face!

189
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:25,096
Now smile about that!
Smile about that, you fat bitch.

190
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,802
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!

191
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,450
Get off me, bitch!

192
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,124
And "blank" and eggs?

193
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,524
- Bacon?
- Right.

194
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:50,153
- And "What's up, Doc?" He eats these.
- Carrots.

195
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,630
- Right. And ice, it comes in a tray.
- Ice cubes.

196
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,635
Right. And the best part of the steak.
The...

197
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,170
- The T-bone. The...
- No.

198
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,602
- Filet mignon.
- Right!

199
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:03,131
- And an English... Thomas' English...
- Muffin!

200
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,007
- Right.
- That's it!

201
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,122
You really need to get some rest.

202
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,987
You have such a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

203
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,222
And remember, Mommy loves you.

204
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:30,901
Describe these things that are planned.
Things that are planned. Ready? Go!

205
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:37,202
Precious, you know I love you.

206
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,302
I'm gonna kick that white lady
out of my house,

207
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,211
move you in with me.

208
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,408
Wanna live in Westchester?

209
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,584
- Commit a...
- Crime.

210
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:49,656
And this is you get back together again.

211
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,747
- A class...
- Reunion.

212
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,347
And this is when you're like this,

213
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:53,688
- you're expecting...
- Pregnant.

214
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,228
- Yeah. And this is you make a fast...
- Escape.

215
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,058
- Right.
- That's it!

216
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,224
Where you going?

217
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,561
Where you going?

218
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:38,794
Make sure youplay my 852
and tell them to box it.

219
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,468
And get some kitty litter.

220
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,747
Ethel, where you at?

221
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:55,915
Precious, what are we gonna play?

222
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:56,978
Girl, get the fuck out of here.

223
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,557
Ain't you supposed to be
at school or something?

224
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,252
You said we was gonna play.

225
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,454
That's exactly why
we ain't gonna be playing.

226
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,120
I never said nothing like that.

227
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:09,990
You would say some shit like that to me,
and you don't even mean it?

228
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:14,227
No, I'm not playing with you.
No, and she call... Hold on.

229
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,703
Eaoh One Teach One, hold, please.

230
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:21,696
Yes. She called my house.
I know it wasn't your sister, Trey.

231
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,343
Because it wasn't her.

232
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,811
What this is here?

233
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,748
Each One Teach One.

234
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,677
I'm looking for an alternative school.

235
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,551
This is an alternative.

236
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,749
What alternative is?

237
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,327
What exactly are you asking me?

238
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,419
Lady at my other school
told me to come here.

239
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,863
Hotel Theresa.
Said it's an alternative school.

240
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:52,997
An alternative sohool, it's like a choice.
It's a different way of doing things.

241
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,736
So, I need your discharge papers
saying that they discharged you.

242
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,744
I got kicked out of school
'cause I was pregnant.

243
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,713
Well, I still need your discharge papers,
otherwise we can't let you in.

244
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,841
Ms. Lichenstein didn't say all that.

245
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,250
You the one she called about.

246
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,784
Claireece P. Jones?

247
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,624
They already sent over
your discharge papers and stuff.

248
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,355
I could start today?

249
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,762
Yeah.
Are you currently receiving AFDC?

250
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,892
My mother get AFDC
for me and my daughter.

251
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:26,200
So your mother has custody of you and
your daughter, and you're on her budget?

252
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,242
Okay, well, I'm gonna need a copy
of your mother's budget,

253
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,301
and a copy of your phone bill
and your utility bill.

254
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:35,711
We gotta give you a few tests,
test your reading and your math level,

255
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,443
see where to place you.

256
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,951
Hold on, baby.
Each One Teach One, hold.

257
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:46,416
To enter into the GED classes,
you gotta get an 8.0 or better on the TABE.

258
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:21,020
There's always something wrong
with these tests.

259
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,256
These tests paint a picture of me
with no brain.

260
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,626
These tests paint a picture
of me and my mother,

261
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:31,170
my whole family,
as less than dumb.

262
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:35,332
Just ugly, black grease to be wiped away,
find another job for.

263
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,340
Sometimes I wish, I was dead.

264
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:44,711
I'll be okay, I guess,
'cause I'm looking up.

265
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,478
I'm looking up for a piano to fall.

266
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:53,515
Or a desk, couch, TV... Momma, maybe.

267
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,722
Always something in my way.

268
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,053
Yeah, man.

269
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,395
Yo, make sure you get that
for me, too, man.

270
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,991
Alternative.

271
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,060
Man, you gotta stop smoking
them shits, man.

272
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,469
That ain't the only thing
that's gonna fucking kill you.

273
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,405
Hustling in these streets gonna kill you.

274
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,472
It is what it is.

275
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,637
Then my mind come back down to Earth.

276
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,245
Let me get some of
that sweet ass, orca!

277
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:18,740
What up, mama?

278
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,877
Why boys always
grabbing on themselves?

279
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,821
You heard what the fuck I said?
I said give me some fucking ass.

280
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,689
I'm serious!
When you gonna let me hit that?

281
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:28,819
That bitch is laughing...

282
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,260
I wish they'd leave me alone.

283
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,354
- She's stupid.
- Yeah.

284
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,900
Yo, that's not even funny.

285
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,769
That's what she'd get anyway, no.

286
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:43,771
Precious!

287
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:46,532
Ma, I need some money!

288
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,464
Ma, I'm hungry!

289
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,066
Come take care of Mommy, Precious.

290
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:04,378
I wish she'd stop this shit.

291
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,382
The other day I cried.

292
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:18,158
I felt stupid.
But you know what?

293
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,359
Fuck that day.

294
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:25,502
That's why God, or whoever,
makes new days.

295
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,934
Still hungry, though.

296
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,112
Nigger wants me to leave my kids.

297
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,840
They're my kids.

298
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:44,888
- What d'you want, baby?
- Give me a basket, please.

299
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,789
- Sides?
- I don't know yet.

300
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:50,522
Still thinking about it.
Trying to watch my figure.

301
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:57,359
Butchie, you got a 10-piece ready?

302
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,649
potato salad.

303
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,320
Thank you.

304
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,165
Hell, no, she didn't!

305
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,238
Get her ass!
Get that big bitch!

306
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:09,334
No, I am not the one.

307
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,608
You in ABE?

308
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,771
Yeah.

309
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,177
Time's a-wasting.

310
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,202
What's your name?

311
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,475
Claireece.

312
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:54,441
Are you coming in?

313
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:03,321
That door closes in 20 seconds.

314
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,992
How are you guys doing today?

315
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:15,092
Would you like to join us, Consuelo?

316
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,760
Consuelo, class is beginning.

317
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:25,071
You guys know
that you are in the ABE class.

318
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:29,070
This is not GED.
This is to get you ready for your GED.

319
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:53,661
These journals are very important
to this class, so do not forget them.

320
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:56,139
You will need to use them every day
that you are here.

321
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,676
They are the key to this class.

322
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,108
It's 9:07, Joann.
You're late.

323
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,806
You're the one who said breakfast is
the most important meal of the day.

324
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:04,850
Tomorrow, that door will be looked at 9:00.

325
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,820
I want you to state your name,
where you were born,

326
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:16,555
your favorite color, something you do well
and why you're here.

327
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:19,458
I'll go first.

328
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,056
When you due?

329
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:24,129
- My name...
- What you mean, you don't know?

330
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,864
...is Blu Rain.

331
00:28:25,972 --> 00:28:28,202
- That's your real name?
- Yes, it is.

332
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,741
Your first name's Blu?

333
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,246
My favorite color is purple.
I sing well.

334
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,180
And I'm here

335
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,082
because I love to teach.

336
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:47,659
She like to sing.

337
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,194
Rhonda?

338
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:53,255
I wish I could sing.
Go to church and sing in the choir.

339
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,531
Show them how it's done.

340
00:28:55,601 --> 00:29:00,334
All right.
My name is Rhonda patrice Johnson.

341
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,539
Problem?

342
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:06,845
- I should smack her.
- What?

343
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:12,442
I was born in Kingston, Jamaica,
and my favorite color is blue.

344
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,544
And I cook good.

345
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,248
My mother, she used to have a restaurant
over on 7th Avenue.

346
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,916
Before she get sick,
she teach me everything.

347
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:23,860
So I'm here to get my reading up,
so I can get my GED.

348
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:32,629
My name is Rita Romero.
I was born here in Harlem.

349
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:37,975
I'm here 'cause I was an addict
and I dropped out of school.

350
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:41,939
So I never got
my reading and writing together.

351
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,278
My favorite color's black.

352
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:45,748
What do you do good?

353
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:48,582
"Well," Joann.
"What do you do well?"

354
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:51,589
- What do I do well?
- No. Rita?

355
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,920
I'm a good mother.
Very good mother.

356
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:01,391
My name's Jermaine.
My favorite color is red.

357
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,594
Tell us where you were born first.

358
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,832
I was born in the Bronx.
Still live there.

359
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:10,841
My favorite color is red.
Used to be blue.

360
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,439
I can dance real good.

361
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,743
Homie of mine told me
about Each One Teach One,

362
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,580
so I came here to stay out of trouble.

363
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:22,450
So you came here to Harlem
to stay out of trouble? Is that right?

364
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:23,920
Yeah.

365
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,652
- Consuelo?
- This is bullshit.

366
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,283
You think so?

367
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,431
Claireece?

368
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:38,697
Can I skip, too?

369
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,173
Joann?

370
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:45,710
Okay. I'm Joann. Hey.

371
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,542
My favorite color is fluorescent beige

372
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,517
and my ambition is to have
my own record layer.

373
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:54,643
What's a record layer?

374
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,655
Tell us where you come from
and why you come to this school.

375
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,691
I was born in Kings County Hospital,

376
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:02,192
but my mother moved us to Harlem
when I was nine.

377
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:07,322
I'm here to get my GED, and then...
Well, I'm already into the music industry.

378
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,995
I'm just trying to take oare of
this little education thing so I can move up.

379
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:16,133
Let's begin.
This is ABE.

380
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,539
Can I go?

381
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:26,414
I wish I could sit
in the back of the class again.

382
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:38,988
My name Claireece "Precious" Jones.

383
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,862
I go by Precious.

384
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:47,003
I live in Harlem.
I like yellow.

385
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:54,104
And I had problems at my other school,
so I come here.

386
00:31:56,449 --> 00:31:58,383
Something you do well?

387
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,251
Nothing.

388
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:05,287
Everybody's good at something.

389
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,759
Come on.

390
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:17,096
Well, I can cook. And...

391
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:22,370
I never really talked in class before.

392
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,475
How does that make you feel?

393
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:37,048
Here.

394
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,817
It makes me feel here.

395
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:47,289
Everybody open their journal.

396
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:51,426
Write the date at the top of the page,
and write.

397
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,236
I don't care if you
spell everything wrong.

398
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,434
I don't care if it's grammatically incorrect.
But just write.

399
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,239
Write anything that you're feeling.

400
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,643
This class will be a revolving door.

401
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:04,910
Some of you will make it
and some of you won't.

402
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:08,348
Fifteen minutes.
Go.

403
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:16,356
Before, I got a A- at English,
and I didn't have to say nothing.

404
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:21,793
Ms. Rain said we gonna read
and write in our notebooks every day.

405
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:24,028
How we supposed to do that?

406
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,640
But then she see the worry on my face
and she say,

407
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,871
"The longest journey
begin with a single step."

408
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:38,182
Whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean.

409
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:40,808
Come on, come on, do the work.

410
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:44,322
You love it, love it, learn it.

411
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,790
Consuelo?

412
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,393
"C" for Consuelo.

413
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,625
"C" for kick your ass.

414
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,029
It's "K" for kick your ass, stupid.

415
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,124
I got the "D," Ms. Rain.

416
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,962
"D" for dick.

417
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,901
Ms. Rain, tell this little-ass bitch
that she don't know me.

418
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,978
Which you wish you had.

419
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,385
- Help her.
- "E."

420
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:17,580
"E."

421
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:21,084
"E."

422
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,178
"F" for fat.

423
00:34:50,623 --> 00:34:51,851
What?

424
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,451
Good.

425
00:34:57,062 --> 00:35:00,122
Hey! Hey! Hey! Quit it! Hey!

426
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:03,132
- What?
- Hey, you stop it right now!

427
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,759
- You fucking...
- Quit it!

428
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,962
- She just hit me!
- Drop it!

429
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,197
Shut the fuck up!

430
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,532
She just slapped me!

431
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,939
Get out.

432
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:14,272
We don't fight in my class. Sit down.

433
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:20,982
"C" for cold.

434
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,553
Do you live with anybody?

435
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,298
My mother.

436
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,662
What does she do?

437
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,738
She don't do nothing.

438
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:48,178
I want you to read
a page from this book.

439
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:57,615
Try.

440
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,192
All I need you to do is sound out
these words for me.

441
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:04,819
You don't have to know every word.

442
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,627
You just have to... It doesn't matter
if you stumble or... Try for me...

443
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:12,831
...or trip up on it.
You just need to say what you know.

444
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:16,533
Come on. You can do this.
Try. Take it word by word.

445
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,201
- Are you listening to me?
- Precious!

446
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:22,303
I just wanna know where you are
in your reading skills.

447
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:23,678
'Cause I'm looking at your test scores...

448
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,273
Some higher fucking learning.
You're a dumb bitch!

449
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,979
Try to read, okay?

450
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,385
Just help me and then I can help you.

451
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,890
We'll start from scratch.
Word for word.

452
00:36:32,992 --> 00:36:35,517
I want you better than your mother.

453
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:38,996
- I'm gonna call the nurse.
- No.

454
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,402
It all look the same to me.

455
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,667
What's this?

456
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,412
I can't do that, Ms. Rain.

457
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,144
push yourself.

458
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,914
A.

459
00:37:04,757 --> 00:37:06,190
What's this word?

460
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:14,230
Do you know the letters? Come on.

461
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:16,926
"D."

462
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,570
"A."

463
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:24,540
"Y."

464
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:27,268
Do you know that word?

465
00:37:29,782 --> 00:37:31,010
"Day."

466
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:34,915
What word is that?

467
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,786
Ate. Ate.

468
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:41,291
Good. Almost.
The word is "At."

469
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,356
"At."

470
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,227
"The."

471
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,028
Sound it out.

472
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,594
"Beach."

473
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:56,799
The word is "Shore."
It's almost like "Beach."

474
00:37:57,543 --> 00:37:58,976
Very good.

475
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,136
Now, read the whole thing for me.

476
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,309
"A

477
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,284

"Shore."

480
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:25,327
Get your big ass in here.

481
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,314
Where was you at this morning?

482
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,483
You hear me talking to you?
Where was you at this morning?

483
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:51,961
School. I was at school.

484
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,463
You a lying whore.

485
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,523
- I'm not lying.
- You is.

486
00:38:56,135 --> 00:38:58,626
The welfare done called here saying
they gonna remove you from my budget

487
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,604
'cause you ain't been
attending school regularly.

488
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,367
I told you, I got kicked out.

489
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:04,499
I been home nearly every day
for two weeks now.

490
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,977
You ain't told me nothing
about no damn school today.

491
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,038
I told you I was going
to school this morning.

492
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:15,949
You plan on putting some food
in that frying pan?

493
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,792
Precious, you got something
you wanna say?

494
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,989
- No.
- Then don't be slamming shit down in here.

495
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,656
You understand?

496
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,034
Yes, ma'am.

497
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:35,173
You need to forget about that school shit
and take your ass down to the welfare.

498
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,071
I'm getting a stipend from school.

499
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:39,371
Fool, what the fuck is a stipend?
What is that?

500
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:43,039
Fuck a stipend.
I said take your ass down to the welfare.

501
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:44,240
Right now?

502
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:48,012
Why in the fuck would you go right now?
It's at night time. Shit is closed.

503
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,348
You gotta be there by 7:00 a.m.

504
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:52,015
in the morning
if you wanna talk to somebody.

505
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,717
Fucking stupid.

506
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:01,059
You think you're too good now?
Is that what it is?

507
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:04,768
You think you is too good for the welfare?

508
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,409
There's more white folk getting assistance
than it is niggers, Ms. Onassis.

509
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,838
I think I said therapy...

510
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,680
Hurry your ass up.
I am in here fucking starving.

511
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,046
Now what you gonna do
if I die of starvation?

512
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,281
Where you gonna go after that?

513
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:27,425
I forgot. School.

514
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:31,727
Each... What that bitch say?
Each one do what?

515
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:33,890
Each one teach one?

516
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:35,433
Well, they don't know
who the fuck they teaching,

517
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:37,695
'cause you can't learn shit.

518
00:40:38,237 --> 00:40:41,104
Keep on listening to them white people.

519
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,868
That's what's gonna get you fucked up.

520
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,709
Precious, I'm hungry.

521
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:18,507
You ain't cooked no collard greens
with the fucking pigs' feet?

522
00:41:19,011 --> 00:41:22,003
Like, how am I supposed to eat pigs' feet
with no collard greens?

523
00:41:22,114 --> 00:41:25,948
And why in the fuck does that pigs' feet
have so much hair in it?

524
00:41:26,018 --> 00:41:29,317
You eat it.
You come eat this shit.

525
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:31,685
- I'm not hungry, though.
- Yes, you is.

526
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,953
Precious, if you don't get
this goddamn plate...

527
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:44,859
You just fix mine when you get done.
Since you fucked it up, you gonna eat it up.

528
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,305
Hurry up and eat, Precious.
I'm fucking hungry, too.

529
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:54,778
And don't let it get cold,
'cause cold-ass pigs' feet is nasty as shit.

530
00:44:03,442 --> 00:44:06,639
So, tell me about...
Tell me about your home life.

531
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:12,172
Ain't nothing to really talk about.

532
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:15,175
You're in a safe place.
Just talk.

533
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,509
What's going on?

534
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:17,952
What's the first thing
that comes to your mind

535
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:20,150
when you think about home?

536
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:23,955
I just wish I had my own TV,
so I could watch it in my room.

537
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:28,257
If I had my own TV,
I wouldn't have to watch it with my mother.

538
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,131
And what's it like,
watching TV with your mother?

539
00:44:31,203 --> 00:44:33,967
You enjoy watching TV with your mother?

540
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:39,033
I need to know about your home life.
I need to know what it's like where you live.

541
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:42,172
My mother's like a whale on the couch.

542
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,273
She say I eat all the time,
but she always making me eat.

543
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,546
Then she call me a fat mess.

544
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:51,781
She say the apartment
is little 'cause of me.

545
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:54,655
Only time she ever leaves
is to play her numbers.

546
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:57,661
I feel like I could just sit in the house
with her every day,

547
00:44:57,729 --> 00:44:59,162
the shades drawn,

548
00:44:59,231 --> 00:45:03,463
watch TV, eat, watch TV, eat again.

549
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:06,566
Can you help out with that?

550
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:10,468
Can we talk about something else now?

551
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:18,682
How about your firstborn?

552
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,081
Mongo?

553
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,013
Mongo is her...
is that...

554
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:27,351
Mongo.
That's short for "mongoloid."

555
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:32,560
Is that what you call her? Or that's...
What is that? A nickname?

556
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:35,199
She got Down's syndrome.

557
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,375
How you doing, Precious?

558
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:47,036
My grandmother Toosie
bring little Mongo over to our house

559
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:51,446
on days when the social worker come,
so it look like she live with us.

560
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:55,010
Answer the fucking door.

561
00:45:56,688 --> 00:45:58,918
Do you see what you did? God damn it.

562
00:45:59,024 --> 00:46:02,289
Then my mother gets money
and the food stamps for me and Mongo.

563
00:46:02,394 --> 00:46:03,793
Who is it?

564
00:46:04,396 --> 00:46:06,023
It's Ms. Turner.

565
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,089
Social worker's here.

566
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:11,896
Why didn't you tell me that bitch
was coming so fucking early?

567
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,632
My fucking wig.
Come get my wig!

568
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:16,070
Come up!

569
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,643
Where's my lipstick?

570
00:46:26,418 --> 00:46:29,046
Thank you, thank you.

571
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:42,229
- Get off of me.
- Leave that child alone, please.

572
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,495
Mind your goddamn business.

573
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,395
- Hi, Precious.
- Hey.

574
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:51,605
- Hello, Ms. Turner. How you doing?
- Hi, Mary. How are you?

575
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:54,941
Please excuse that.
My sweet grandbaby just knocked it over.

576
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:57,311
please, have a seat.
Excuse the mess.

577
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:58,939
- Thank you.
- Than ks.

578
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:00,279
How are you, Mary?

579
00:47:00,352 --> 00:47:03,344
I'm doing really good, Ms. Turner.
Thank you.

580
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:06,749
When was the last time
you've taken her to the doctor?

581
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:10,191
Precious, when...
When did we take her? The baby?

582
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:11,319
Last month.

583
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:14,830
Yeah... On the 16th.
On the 16th. Yes, yes, ma'am.

584
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:17,993
Okay, and what did the doctor say?

585
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:23,540
They said
that she's progressing really good.

586
00:47:23,642 --> 00:47:25,439
She's doing really good.

587
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,671
- That's good.
- Yes, ma'am.

588
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:29,508
And have you been looking for a job?

589
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:33,880
I have, Ms. Turner. I am.
But they've all been saying the same thing.

590
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:37,477
You know, they'll call me back.
They'll get back to me.

591
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:41,985
When did you go looking for the job?

592
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:46,224
I went last week
and I filled out several applications.

593
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:50,028
And they all said the same thing,
that they would call me.

594
00:47:52,137 --> 00:47:53,399
Mommy!

595
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:56,296
No! No!

596
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,839
Is that a new microwave oven?

597
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:02,213
A... A microwave?

598
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:06,911
No, ma'am.
We warm our things up in the oven.

599
00:48:08,253 --> 00:48:10,721
- I see. It's a toaster oven.
- Yes. Yes, ma'am.

600
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:15,088
Okay.
I will be seeing and speaking with you

601
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:17,383
in a week or so.

602
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:18,519
- In a week or so?
- Yes.

603
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:22,088
Okay, do you know what time you'll be...
You'll be coming?

604
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,428
- I'll let you know.
- Okay.

605
00:48:23,535 --> 00:48:24,900
- I'll let you know.
- Thank you so much.

606
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:27,767
Precious, any questions for me?

607
00:48:30,175 --> 00:48:31,938
How are you, Precious?

608
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:35,103
I'm doing good.
How you doing?

609
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,871
I'm good, thank you.

610
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:41,042
Ladies, thank you for your time.

611
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,053
Thank you so much, Ms. Turner.
Have a great day.

612
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:45,282
- And you. Bye, Sheila.
- Bye.

613
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:52,863
Come get this motherfucking...
Get her.

614
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:55,798
Moving all around and shit
while I'm trying to talk to this bitch.

615
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,800
Makes me fucking itch.

616
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,868
She done threw her fucking candy
on the floor.

617
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,464
Goddamn animal.

618
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:08,238
And now you gonna give it to her?
put the fucking candy back on the floor!

619
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:09,871
Then you go and pick it up
and let her have it.

620
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:13,145
You're so fucking stupid.
Just like her dumb ass.

621
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:16,948
That bitch gonna come up in here
and I gotta fucking make pretend?

622
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,386
I'm so sick of it.

623
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,924
I don't know what the fuck
you shaking your head for.

624
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:22,459
You didn't do no goddamn better.

625
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,619
You know what?
Let's talk about your father.

626
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:27,163
Tell me about your relationship with him.

627
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:29,733
I don't know much more
than you do, Ms. White.

628
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,462
It's Ms. Weiss.

629
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:34,231
Talk to me about
the little you do know about your father,

630
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,570
'cause it is important,
whether you know it or not.

631
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:40,937
He give me this baby
and my one before it, but I...

632
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:43,606
What did you say he gave you?

633
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:45,114
- Nothing.
- No, Claireece, you just said

634
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:46,343
your father gave you something.

635
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:48,442
- I heard you just say...
- You didn't hear shit.

636
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,318
- I heard you say your father...
- I ain't say nothing. I ain't say shit like it.

637
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:53,253
- I don't care, honey.
- I didn't say nothing like that.

638
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,916
- I need to know this.
- Let's move on.

639
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:56,358
I need to know this to help you.

640
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:59,453
- Bitch, can we change the subject?
- Okay.

641
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:02,694
Well, I'll see you next time, then.
Or maybe you'll see someone else.

642
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:07,363
But you're gonna have to talk to somebody
if you want your check, sweetie.

643
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:19,640
I see vampires, too.

644
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:25,820
They come at night.
They tell me I'm one of them.

645
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:30,320
They say, "Precious, you belong with us."

646
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,221
And then they go downstairs
through the floor.

647
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:38,166
The people that live under us,
they is vampires,

648
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:40,568
so that's where they should go.

649
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,300
They be so nasty, though,

650
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:45,740
leaving their dirty tampons and shit
in the garbage.

651
00:50:45,844 --> 00:50:48,244
Don't even offer to take it out.

652
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:50,871
They got no fucking home training.

653
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:57,684
I been going to the doctor, too.
It's nice.

654
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:03,424
Ms. Rain fall out when she Found out
I ain't never been to no doctor before.

655
00:51:06,598 --> 00:51:08,998
Don't know how I had my first baby
on the kitchen floor

656
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:12,002
with my momma kicking me
upside my head.

657
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,037
Them the kind of things
you're talking about

658
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:18,940
when you say,
say whatever come to my mind?

659
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:26,244
That's the end of them welfare checks.

660
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:30,378
I just couldn't lie no more.
I shouldn't have said none of that.

661
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:35,722
Momma gonna kill me.

662
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,127
Motherfuckers!

663
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,401
Are we done?

664
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:53,239
I'm not doing this with you today.

665
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:55,973
At night, we went out on a field trip.

666
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:03,086
These girls is crazy.

667
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:06,821
Ain't nobody ever grabbed my hand
like that before.

668
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:26,008
...as a candidate
for the Democratic nomination

669
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:29,102
for the presidency
of the United States of America.

670
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:33,512
...and by having destroyed it,
now we don't know...

671
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,857
...and the testimony you're about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth...

672
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:42,824
I still have a dream.

673
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:48,291
It is a dream deeply rooted
in the American dream.

674
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:53,300
I have a dream that one day

675
00:52:54,806 --> 00:52:59,971
this nation will rise up
and live out the true meaning of...

676
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:02,171
I'm gonna teach my baby all of this.

677
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,306
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,

678
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:07,476
"that all men are created equal."

679
00:53:07,552 --> 00:53:09,816
No fear. That's bullshit. That's bullshit.

680
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:10,979
You mean, write a whole new one?

681
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:13,956
No, girl, if I need to explain myself to you...

682
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:15,788
- You'll figure it out.
- You think that I'm stupid?

683
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,886
Oh, my God. That I believe in you?

684
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:22,456
That I think you're incredible?

685
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,228
Yes, but I don't know what to do.

686
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:27,361
All right, pull it together. Okay.
Who's next?

687
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:29,670
I'm happy to be writing.

688
00:53:29,741 --> 00:53:32,733
- Go ahead, Rhonda.
- I'm happy to be in school, too.

689
00:53:32,844 --> 00:53:36,177
Ms. Rain say we gonna write
every day in our notebook.

690
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:38,215
She gonna write back to us every day, too.

691
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:42,082
"Yesterday I went to church for
the first time since I come to this country.

692
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:43,483
"I got all the way to Brooklyn.

693
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,352
"The church was up the block and around
the corner upon the 3 train.

694
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:48,085
"The preacher preached
two and a half hours

695
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:50,683
- "about Jehovah.
- Rhonda! Rhonda!

696
00:53:50,762 --> 00:53:54,198
"And how Lord Jesus, Son of God, Messiah,
Jehovah delivers."

697
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:56,256
Is that a fairytale?

698
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:59,166
Sit down.

699
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:00,534
Did anybody do this assign ment?

700
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:03,096
Momma say this school ain't shit.

701
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,675
She say you can't learn nothing
writing in no book.

702
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:10,942
- This is a fairytale called "Enchanted."
- She wrong about that. I is learning.

703
00:54:13,718 --> 00:54:17,176
"Once upon a time, in a faraway land,

704
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:21,718
"there lived a beautiful princess
named Joan n- a.

705
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:26,593
"She was very, very fly and extra, extra tall,

706
00:54:27,198 --> 00:54:30,690
"and every single boy loved her,
big and small.

707
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:35,565
"Except for one idiot boy
who was so stupid and dumb.

708
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,872
"And out of all the cute boys who loved her,
he was the cutest one."

709
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:44,277
- That's all I got so far.
- That's a good beginning.

710
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:47,909
Thinking about little Mongo, too.
I miss her.

711
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:49,753
That's how you start a fairytale.

712
00:54:49,821 --> 00:54:52,119
I'm happy my baby coming up.

713
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:57,091
I'm gonna read to this baby, too,
and hang colors on its wall.

714
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:00,930
Listen, baby. Mother not dumb.

715
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:03,296
Mother love you. Listen.

716
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:07,464
"Once upon a time,
there was a magical princess

717
00:55:07,572 --> 00:55:10,735
"who lived in a magical bubble
under the sea.

718
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:13,334
"And she was from land."

719
00:55:28,593 --> 00:55:30,254
Stop screaming.

720
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:55,049
His name's Abdul Jamal Lewis Jones.

721
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:58,886
He healthy.
His mother love him.

722
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:17,234
The food in this hospital's nasty.

723
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:19,035
It's not from here.

724
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:20,701
Where it from?

725
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:23,336
A little shop by my house where

726
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:25,848
I get my organic food,
so I don't have to eat that

727
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:28,511
nasty mystery-meat stuff
they got downstairs.

728
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:31,578
Can you bring me something?
I don't like fruit. I like McDonald's.

729
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:33,884
First of all,
I don't eat McDonald's.

730
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:36,653
Second of all, you don't need
to be eating McDonald's, either.

731
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,751
It's not healthy.

732
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:40,057
But I like McDonald's.
We all like McDonald's, right?

733
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:42,758
We like McDonald's, too, over here.

734
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:44,357
I don't like no damn McDonald's.

735
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:47,529
I want some of that organio shit
like you got.

736
00:56:47,939 --> 00:56:49,406
Well, I tell you what,

737
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:52,032
when you get up out of here,
you go with all your little friends,

738
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:53,076
and you go to McDonald's,

739
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:55,042
and you get as much
McDonald's as you want.

740
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:57,580
But right now,
you're gonna take care of your health.

741
00:56:57,682 --> 00:56:59,377
Are you a doctor?

742
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:02,419
- Are you her doctor?
- Am I a doctor?

743
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,182
- Yeah.
- I am a nurse's aide.

744
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:07,053
Nurse John- John.

745
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:08,785
Oh, that's funny?

746
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:11,056
Well, you're a man.

747
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:14,458
- You've never seen a male nurse?
- No.

748
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:16,725
Not looking like you do.

749
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:21,631
I am a male nurse.
I am Nurse John McFadden.

750
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:24,299
So was you up in the room
when she popped the baby out?

751
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:25,432
You was like, all up in between her...

752
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:27,568
Joan, don't be nasty!

753
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:29,237
How was it? Was he screaming?

754
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:30,405
It hurt.

755
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:32,073
Tough gal like you had to scream?

756
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:36,415
Not so tough with a baby coming out of me.
It hurt. And it burned.

757
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:37,749
- Are you married?
- Shut up!

758
00:57:37,822 --> 00:57:39,483
You got a girlfriend?

759
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,990
- Why you asking? He don't want you.
- How would you know?

760
00:57:42,093 --> 00:57:43,754
Why don't you stop being a ho
for 10 minutes?

761
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:44,988
What's wrong with these people?

762
00:57:45,096 --> 00:57:46,461
You don't want her, right?

763
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:49,328
I wish I was a cantaloupe in that cup.

764
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:50,923
So he could eat you?

765
00:57:51,002 --> 00:57:54,631
Okay, no.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

766
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:57,836
No, that's all right. That's all right.

767
00:58:01,112 --> 00:58:03,080
Can I get a kiss, too, Nurse John?

768
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:05,911
- Good afternoon, ladies.
- Bye, Nurse John.

769
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,850
- Bye!
- Good night, Nurse John- John!

770
00:58:10,288 --> 00:58:12,586
Precious and John- John

771
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:14,625
Sitting in a tree

772
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:18,492
- F-U-C-K-I-N-G
- Shut up! Y'all are nasty.

773
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:24,861
You think he's spending the night
up in here?

774
00:58:27,038 --> 00:58:30,269
Now she gonna write
about Nurse John in her book!

775
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:33,203
"Dear Ms. Rain,

00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:04,503
"If she takes Abdul,
I won't have nothing no more."

785
00:59:04,456 --> 00:59:06,424
"Dear Precious,

786
00:59:06,525 --> 00:59:09,790
"I think your first responsibility
has to be to yourself.

787
00:59:10,028 --> 00:59:12,553
"If you keep Abdul,
you might have nothing.

788
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:15,099
"You're learning to read and write.
That's everything.

789
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,862
"You come back to school
when you get out of the hospital.

790
00:59:17,936 --> 00:59:19,062
"You're only 17."

791
00:59:19,137 --> 00:59:21,571
This looks like a big-ass condom.

792
00:59:23,442 --> 00:59:25,535
Use that for Nurse John.

793
00:59:26,044 --> 00:59:28,205
Not looking like that.
Your hair looks a mess.

794
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,976
- I'm giving you banjee.
- Shut up!

795
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:32,573
I got your journal.

796
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:34,141
Thank you.

797
00:59:39,424 --> 00:59:40,948
What's wrong?

798
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:42,390
Nothing.

799
00:59:42,461 --> 00:59:44,053
Are you sure?

800
00:59:44,129 --> 00:59:45,153
Yeah, I'm sure.

801
00:59:45,264 --> 00:59:49,667
All right. I'm bored.
I'm about to leave. Bye.

802
00:59:51,336 --> 00:59:52,997
Bye, Ms. Toosie.

803
00:59:53,505 --> 00:59:55,097
You got a nasty-ass mouth.

804
00:59:55,173 --> 00:59:57,266
You got a nasty-ass hat.

805
00:59:59,678 --> 01:00:02,476
That's what's wrong,
you hanging out with bitches like that.

806
01:00:02,581 --> 01:00:04,139
Here's your baby.

807
01:00:04,249 --> 01:00:06,615
It's probably the last time
you're gonna ever see him.

808
01:00:06,685 --> 01:00:08,118
Grandmother come and visit and say,

809
01:00:08,186 --> 01:00:10,780
"Only a dog would drop a baby
and walk off."

810
01:00:10,856 --> 01:00:12,153
Not even a dog.

811
01:00:12,457 --> 01:00:14,857
Say later, '"Not even a dog."

812
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,020
I'm proud of you.
Ain't nothing like your mother.

813
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:21,463
"Where was your grandmother
when your father was abusing you?

814
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:23,626
"Where is little Mongo now?

815
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:27,133
"What is going to be the best thing for you
in this situation?"

816
01:00:27,205 --> 01:00:29,503
"Ms. Rain, you ask too many questions.

817
01:00:29,608 --> 01:00:32,133
"Sometimes I wish I could stop breathing.

818
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:34,610
"I just wanna be a good mother."

819
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:37,808
"Being a good mother might mean
letting Abdul be raised

820
01:00:37,883 --> 01:00:41,546
"by someone who's better able than you
to meet his needs."

821
01:00:42,287 --> 01:00:45,779
"Ms. Rain, I is the best
to meet my child's needs."

822
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,998
"Who's gonna help you?

823
01:00:57,536 --> 01:00:59,834
"How will you support yourself?

824
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:04,065
"How will you keep learning
to read and write?'"

825
01:01:05,143 --> 01:01:07,202
"The welfare helped Momma."

826
01:01:08,013 --> 01:01:11,574
"You look and see
how much welfare has helped your mom.

827
01:01:13,885 --> 01:01:15,512
"You could get your GED,

828
01:01:15,587 --> 01:01:18,249
"and go to college.
You can do anything, Precious."

829
01:02:40,405 --> 01:02:41,804
You back?

830
01:02:42,407 --> 01:02:43,772
What's his name?

831
01:02:44,276 --> 01:02:45,834
Can I hold it?

832
01:03:49,674 --> 01:03:51,232
Hey, Precious.

833
01:03:55,013 --> 01:03:56,241
Hey.

834
01:03:59,718 --> 01:04:01,413
You had the baby?

835
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:03,317
A boy.

836
01:04:04,556 --> 01:04:06,820
Where you been all this time?

837
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:15,092
Let me see him.

838
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,069
Can I hold him?

839
01:04:43,595 --> 01:04:45,586
He look like his daddy.

840
01:04:51,136 --> 01:04:52,626
He named Abdul.

841
01:04:53,939 --> 01:04:57,534
put all this shit down
and go get me something to drink.

842
01:05:15,994 --> 01:05:17,461
You bitch!

843
01:05:18,063 --> 01:05:20,258
- You fucking bitch!
- You crazy, Momma?

844
01:05:20,332 --> 01:05:22,823
Am I crazy?
Bitch, if I was to...

845
01:05:23,835 --> 01:05:25,564
You ruined my fucking life!

846
01:05:25,637 --> 01:05:28,299
You done took my man,
you had those fucking babies,

847
01:05:28,406 --> 01:05:29,634
and you got me put off the welfare

848
01:05:29,741 --> 01:05:32,005
for running your goddamned
stupid-ass mouth!

849
01:05:32,143 --> 01:05:35,977
I ain't stupid and I didn't take your man.
Your husband raped me!

850
01:05:36,081 --> 01:05:37,571
Didn't no-fucking-body rape you!

851
01:05:37,649 --> 01:05:39,981
Bitch, don't you put
your fucking hands on me!

852
01:06:00,605 --> 01:06:02,869
Mary, leave that girl alone!

853
01:06:41,479 --> 01:06:43,413
Can I see the baby now?

854
01:08:55,013 --> 01:08:58,141
B... C... D...

855
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:03,487
E... F... G... H...

856
01:09:04,155 --> 01:09:06,851
I... J... K...

857
01:09:13,898 --> 01:09:15,490
I'm tired of shopping.

858
01:09:15,567 --> 01:09:17,535
Yes, because they all trying
to take your money.

859
01:09:17,635 --> 01:09:19,500
They don't...

860
01:09:30,148 --> 01:09:32,048
I'm calling the cops.

861
01:09:37,255 --> 01:09:39,746
Tell me what you see back there.

862
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:56,664
I could tell by Ms. Rain's face
I ain't gonna be homeless no more.

863
01:09:56,741 --> 01:09:58,766
I just don't know
where I'm gonna end up, though.

864
01:09:58,877 --> 01:10:00,435
I'll hold.

865
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:04,109
I feel bad for her.

866
01:10:04,215 --> 01:10:07,946
She just an ABC teacher.
She ain't no social worker.

867
01:10:09,587 --> 01:10:10,849
What's going on?

868
01:10:10,922 --> 01:10:12,082
But she all I could think of.

869
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,624
Look, when the others get here,
tell them to start writing.

870
01:10:14,726 --> 01:10:16,887
And whichever one of you is older
is in charge, okay?

871
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:18,622
Consuelo, I know that's not you.
Come here.

872
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:20,857
Ms. Rain, I can't stay. I'm serious.
I've tried to talk...

873
01:10:20,932 --> 01:10:23,526
Consuelo, you're not leaving class
and I'm not dealing with this right now.

874
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:25,933
Take this money.
Go get something for Precious to wear.

875
01:10:26,037 --> 01:10:28,471
Quick. And bring back my change.

876
01:10:28,573 --> 01:10:32,270
Sixteen years old.
A three-day-old infant.

877
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:35,038
The baby not bleeding.
I think this is Precious' blood.

878
01:10:35,113 --> 01:10:37,980
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?

879
01:10:39,317 --> 01:10:41,785
We'll find you a place to live.

880
01:10:44,989 --> 01:10:46,718
Joann, you're late.

881
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:48,986
Rhonda, you ain't the teacher.

882
01:10:49,127 --> 01:10:51,459
Joann, Ms. Rain is busy
with Precious today,

883
01:10:51,562 --> 01:10:53,655
so I am the teacher today.

884
01:10:53,765 --> 01:10:55,630
Okay. Why?

885
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,829
- Where's Preoious?
- Just sit. Pull out your notebook.

886
01:10:57,936 --> 01:11:00,336
Joann, you wanna say one of your raps
to the baby?

887
01:11:00,438 --> 01:11:01,837
What's the baby doing here?

888
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,635
- Joann's gonna rap for you.
- Let me see.

889
01:11:03,841 --> 01:11:06,139
She all right.
She's doing good.

890
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:09,813
Why is the baby wrapped up
in a blood-covered blanket?

891
01:11:09,914 --> 01:11:12,644
- Joann, what's so funny?
- For real. What happened?

892
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,149
You don't wanna know is
how it got on the blanket.

893
01:11:14,252 --> 01:11:15,310
You know what your problem is, Joann?

894
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,183
That you can't take anything
serious enough.

895
01:11:17,288 --> 01:11:19,688
- Jermaine, me expect better from you.
- Okay, Rhonda.

896
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:22,316
Joann, stop laughing at this baby.

897
01:11:23,995 --> 01:11:25,292
Queens.

898
01:11:27,632 --> 01:11:29,361
Let me call you back.

899
01:11:29,467 --> 01:11:30,764
Just tell me what happened!

900
01:11:30,835 --> 01:11:32,166
No, it's not funny.

901
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:35,103
But Joann, there's nothing funny
about a baby with blood on it.

902
01:11:35,173 --> 01:11:36,970
I got a West indian friend
who's a Council member.

903
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:39,168
Let me see what she can do.
Hold on a second.

904
01:11:39,277 --> 01:11:42,542
I found a lesson plan in our notebooks.
We're gonna...

905
01:11:44,115 --> 01:11:45,810
Claireece Jones.

906
01:11:45,883 --> 01:11:48,181
Hey, Ms. Lisa.
How you been?

907
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:50,214
I don't know.

908
01:11:50,321 --> 01:11:54,223
I went to see that movie, Barfly, last night.
piece of shit.

909
01:11:55,226 --> 01:11:58,354
- I'm sorry.
- It's on my desk. Can you hold?

910
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:00,727
Something's wrong with you, Precious.

911
01:12:00,832 --> 01:12:02,356
This baby stink.

912
01:12:02,467 --> 01:12:04,731
Well, we don't have a pamper,
so have a seat with the baby.

913
01:12:04,836 --> 01:12:07,498
- I am sitting.
- In your seat, please.

914
01:12:07,572 --> 01:12:09,665
The first thing

915
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:15,407
is shut the bumba-ros-clot...

916
01:12:16,314 --> 01:12:18,805
Ms. Rain, why did you let Rhonda
teach the class?

917
01:12:18,883 --> 01:12:20,510
She don't even know how to speak English.

918
01:12:20,585 --> 01:12:21,643
Let Rhonda take over.

919
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:25,348
- Shut the bumba-ros-clot up.
- What the fuck is a "ros clot"?

920
01:12:25,423 --> 01:12:27,357
Yeah, Brenda, you there?

921
01:12:27,425 --> 01:12:30,019
The last four of the Social are...

922
01:12:30,094 --> 01:12:32,688
2-4-2-1

923
01:12:32,764 --> 01:12:34,891
- Rita?
- I just wanna know how to spell "Aquarius."

924
01:12:34,999 --> 01:12:37,866
- Anybody know how to spell "Aquarius"?
- It's A-Q-U-A-R-I-U-S.

925
01:12:37,935 --> 01:12:39,163
Can you spell "boy" then?

926
01:12:39,237 --> 01:12:40,499
Can you spell "slut" then?

927
01:12:40,571 --> 01:12:42,198
Let's explore that.

928
01:12:42,273 --> 01:12:45,606
You wanna spell "slut," Consuelo,
I'll give you the first letter.

929
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,837
Can you spell "illegal immigrant," then?

930
01:12:47,912 --> 01:12:49,937
Great, thank you.

931
01:12:51,549 --> 01:12:54,040
Can you please use "slut" in a sentence?

932
01:12:54,118 --> 01:12:55,517
Consuelo is a slut...

933
01:12:55,586 --> 01:12:58,384
- You the one who's the ho up in here...
- Joann is not a slut.

934
01:12:58,456 --> 01:13:00,856
perfect. You get a gold star.

935
01:13:02,693 --> 01:13:04,388
But you know she likes that.

936
01:13:04,462 --> 01:13:06,760
Well, she's just insecure.

937
01:13:06,864 --> 01:13:08,456
- You think?
- Yeah.

938
01:13:08,966 --> 01:13:12,561
- That chicken was good.
- Really good. Did you have enough?

939
01:13:12,637 --> 01:13:14,571
There ain't more, is there?

940
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:16,300
- Is there more?
- Yeah.

941
01:13:16,641 --> 01:13:18,939
Maybe later. Not now.

942
01:13:19,043 --> 01:13:20,977
I don't want you to think I'm greedy.

943
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:23,411
You're not greedy.
If you're hungry, let's get you some more.

944
01:13:23,481 --> 01:13:26,644
I guess I kind of eat
too much sometimes, though.

945
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:27,979
No, you don't.

946
01:13:28,086 --> 01:13:29,951
- Blu, is that you?
- Not always.

947
01:13:30,054 --> 01:13:32,113
What are you doing here?

948
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:35,252
I live here.
Why didn't you tell me?

949
01:13:35,326 --> 01:13:38,124
- Hey, sweetie.
- Is this... Is this...

950
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:41,925
This is Katherine, Precious.

951
01:13:41,999 --> 01:13:44,058
- Are you okay?
- It's so nice to meet you, finally.

952
01:13:44,135 --> 01:13:47,571
Oh, my God.
These straight-up lesbians.

953
01:13:47,638 --> 01:13:51,233
- This is Abdul.
- He's gorgeous. He looks just like you.

954
01:13:52,276 --> 01:13:53,607
Precious, can I hold him?

955
01:13:53,678 --> 01:13:55,441
You know how to?

956
01:13:55,513 --> 01:13:57,504
They stilinlce enough
to let us stay in their home

957
01:13:57,615 --> 01:13:59,947
until I get situated, though.

958
01:14:00,017 --> 01:14:04,113
- He's heavy. Oh, my God!
- You wanna hold him?

959
01:14:04,188 --> 01:14:06,679
I guess this is how the peoples
on TV feel at Christmas time.

960
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:09,351
- Don't drop him.
- Come on. I only work with children.

961
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:10,484
You know how you are.
I saw you...

962
01:14:10,595 --> 01:14:12,620
When we were putting up the tree,
you dropped half the top of it.

963
01:14:12,697 --> 01:14:14,289
They're so nice to me and Abdul.

964
01:14:14,365 --> 01:14:16,458
- Be careful. Hold him with both hands.
- please.

965
01:14:16,534 --> 01:14:18,263
Oh, Abdul.

966
01:14:20,204 --> 01:14:22,365
Merry Christmas, Precious.

967
01:14:23,207 --> 01:14:24,333
Thank you.

968
01:14:24,442 --> 01:14:25,773
Why peoples that barely know me

969
01:14:25,843 --> 01:14:29,176
should be nicer to me
than my mother and my father?

970
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:31,213
I felt warm.

971
01:14:31,549 --> 01:14:32,777
- What?
- I'm just...

972
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:36,013
I'm just concerned about the baby
and the cats upstairs.

973
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,280
They're fine.

974
01:14:37,355 --> 01:14:39,346
Grandmother's scared of Momma.

975
01:14:39,457 --> 01:14:41,857
I know that's why
she ain't letting me stay with her.

976
01:14:41,959 --> 01:14:43,859
If Ronald McDonald were running things...

977
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:46,725
Ms. Rain say don't be afraid of nothing.

978
01:14:47,398 --> 01:14:49,866
I bet she ain't scared of Momma.

979
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:52,561
Wouldn't you be a little bit suspicious?

980
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:53,898
Just write the book.

981
01:14:54,005 --> 01:14:57,236
- Well, who's gonna read it?
- Nobody, if you don't write it.

982
01:14:57,341 --> 01:15:00,868
You know, Precious writes every day.
You should try it.

983
01:15:00,978 --> 01:15:04,209
Is that right?
What do you write about, Precious?

984
01:15:05,016 --> 01:15:06,244
Stuff.

985
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:09,751
My life. Abdul.

986
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,351
How come y'all don't like McDonald's?

987
01:15:14,425 --> 01:15:16,256
Katherine was just drawing a comparison

988
01:15:16,394 --> 01:15:18,419
so that her point could be
more easily understood.

989
01:15:18,529 --> 01:15:19,518
Yes.

990
01:15:19,597 --> 01:15:22,088
They talk like TV channels I don't watch.

991
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,565
My Uncle Clayton.

992
01:15:23,668 --> 01:15:27,104
I'm glad Abdul here to listen in on them,
though, 'cause I know they're smart.

993
01:15:27,205 --> 01:15:28,604
Before he got saved,

994
01:15:28,706 --> 01:15:31,368
he used to smoke like a chimney
and drink like a fish.

995
01:15:31,442 --> 01:15:33,501
I don't understand a
word they're saying.

996
01:15:33,578 --> 01:15:35,170
You understand?

997
01:15:38,749 --> 01:15:40,216
Y'all be watching Oprah?

998
01:15:40,284 --> 01:15:43,219
No. I don't, actually.
You know what time I get home from work.

999
01:15:43,287 --> 01:15:46,415
- I watch it.
- Momma say homos is bad peoples.

1000
01:15:47,124 --> 01:15:49,558
But Momma,
homos not ones who raped me.

1001
01:15:49,627 --> 01:15:51,925
And what do that make you?

1002
01:15:52,029 --> 01:15:56,125
Homos not ones who let me sit in class
all them years and never learn nothing.

1003
01:15:56,234 --> 01:15:59,101
The homos not ones who sell crack
to peoples in Harlem.

1004
01:15:59,203 --> 01:16:01,194
-...that I have ever seen. Tell her!
- That doesn't work.

1005
01:16:01,272 --> 01:16:03,866
I wonder what Oprah got to say about that.

1006
01:16:03,941 --> 01:16:06,307
Ms. Rain is the one
who put the chalk in my hand,

1007
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:08,878
made me queen of the ABC's.

1008
01:16:11,816 --> 01:16:13,750
After I settled at the halfway house,

1009
01:16:13,818 --> 01:16:16,252
I worked my hardest
to memorize letter sounds,

1010
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,312
writing in the journal,
and reading smaller and fatter books.

1011
01:16:19,457 --> 01:16:22,654
Then I found out the Mayor's office
give me a literacy award

1012
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,489
and a check for progress.

1013
01:16:26,931 --> 01:16:28,660
One, two, three.

1014
01:16:28,766 --> 01:16:30,495
The party is on.

1015
01:16:30,801 --> 01:16:32,166
Go, Joann!

1016
01:16:35,473 --> 01:16:37,566
Let me see what you got!

1017
01:16:37,642 --> 01:16:42,739
Everybody come. Nurse John, Cornrows,
all the staff was out there.

1018
01:16:43,281 --> 01:16:45,511
Even Ms. Katherine showed up.

1019
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,147
Precious.

1020
01:16:50,354 --> 01:16:51,787
What's up?

1021
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:53,780
What's that?

1022
01:16:54,358 --> 01:16:56,019
What does it look like?

1023
01:16:56,127 --> 01:16:58,027
plastic stupid apple.

1024
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:02,859
A little something for you.

1025
01:17:02,967 --> 01:17:05,663
- Is there more money in it?
- You're so greedy.

1026
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:08,500
Yo, who's that?

1027
01:17:11,442 --> 01:17:12,670
What?

1028
01:17:15,546 --> 01:17:17,537
- What?
- Come on.

1029
01:17:18,049 --> 01:17:20,517
Precious, where are you taking me?

1030
01:17:21,952 --> 01:17:25,649
What am I supposed to do, diva? Yeah?
Wait a minute. Hold on, girl.

1031
01:17:25,723 --> 01:17:27,281
Yeah...

1032
01:17:31,462 --> 01:17:33,555
My mom called last night.

1033
01:17:36,233 --> 01:17:39,532
And we don't really have a relationship.

1034
01:17:40,004 --> 01:17:42,837
We don't talk,
because she really has a problem with...

1035
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:46,673
Some folks got a light around them
that shine for other peoples.

1036
01:17:46,744 --> 01:17:49,838
I think maybe some
of them was in tunnels,

1037
01:17:49,914 --> 01:17:52,644
and in that tunnel,
maybe the only light they had

1038
01:17:52,717 --> 01:17:54,241
was inside of them.

1039
01:17:54,352 --> 01:17:57,583
Then I thought about how strong
you've had to be.

1040
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:03,922
And then,
even long after they escaped that tunnel...

1041
01:18:05,262 --> 01:18:08,095
- I'll help you clean up.
- Okay.

1042
01:18:08,766 --> 01:18:11,758
...they still be shining for everybody else.

1043
01:18:16,006 --> 01:18:18,031
That's Ms. Rain to me.

1044
01:18:21,011 --> 01:18:22,535
"Award for Outstanding Achievement."

1045
01:18:22,613 --> 01:18:26,242
In a book I read,
this lady escaped to a halfway house.

1046
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:27,544
And when she was there,

1047
01:18:27,618 --> 01:18:30,553
she asked the people there
what a halfway house was.

1048
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:34,955
They told her it was halfway between
her old life and where she wanna be.

1049
01:18:35,059 --> 01:18:36,959
That's kind of nice.

1050
01:18:38,629 --> 01:18:41,723
That also mean
I can't stay here forever.

1051
01:18:41,799 --> 01:18:43,960
There's still a way to go.

1052
01:18:44,702 --> 01:18:47,637
It'd be something to
get my own apartment.

1053
01:18:48,472 --> 01:18:51,964
Abdul nine months and almost walking.
He's smart, too.

1054
01:18:52,643 --> 01:18:55,737
I've been reading to him
since the day he was born.

1055
01:18:55,813 --> 01:18:58,873
He's barely talking,
but he's already counting.

1056
01:18:59,817 --> 01:19:01,648
Momma, Daddy,

1057
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:06,823
IS 111, 444 Lenox all seem
like some old, bad dream.

1058
01:19:08,993 --> 01:19:12,986
I wish I could've just started out here,
but still with Abdul.

1059
01:19:14,432 --> 01:19:18,596
I'm gonna get Mongo, too.
I gotta get Mongo back.

1060
01:19:20,671 --> 01:19:21,763
Hey, Miss Cassidy.

1061
01:19:21,839 --> 01:19:24,069
Hey, Precious,
somebody downstairs for you.

1062
01:19:24,141 --> 01:19:25,904
- Who is It?
- I didn't ask who it was.

1063
01:19:25,976 --> 01:19:27,170
You want me to watch the baby?

1064
01:19:27,278 --> 01:19:30,145
No, I gotta go down
and get him anyway.

1065
01:20:04,548 --> 01:20:06,209
Your daddy dead.

1066
01:20:08,152 --> 01:20:09,619
That's all?

1067
01:20:14,692 --> 01:20:16,557
He had that AIDS virus.

1068
01:20:32,076 --> 01:20:33,338
There you go,
dreaming again.

1069
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:36,072
Precious, do you hear me talking to you?

1070
01:20:37,515 --> 01:20:38,641
Did you hear what I said?

1071
01:20:43,587 --> 01:20:45,020
You got it?

1072
01:20:46,257 --> 01:20:47,884
Got what?

1073
01:20:47,992 --> 01:20:49,926
- The AIDS virus.
- No.

1074
01:20:50,928 --> 01:20:52,589
How do you know?

1075
01:20:52,696 --> 01:20:55,563
We never did it up in the ass,
so I know.

1076
01:20:59,937 --> 01:21:02,405
You better get to a doctor, Mom.

1077
01:21:05,109 --> 01:21:06,838
You coming home?

1078
01:21:23,794 --> 01:21:25,284
Yo, Preoious!

1079
01:21:43,948 --> 01:21:46,940
Rita, what do I mean
when I say the author

1080
01:21:47,051 --> 01:21:51,715
describes her protagonist's circumstances
as "unrelenting"?

1081
01:21:52,723 --> 01:21:55,055
I don't know.
I don't know.

1082
01:21:57,428 --> 01:22:00,989
It's like, say, like if Rita,
she tries to do something,

1083
01:22:01,098 --> 01:22:03,566
and she's going and she's going,
and me, I try to stop her

1084
01:22:03,634 --> 01:22:06,262
and she no stop, she keep on going.

1085
01:22:06,904 --> 01:22:08,667
Relentless-un.

1086
01:23:01,392 --> 01:23:03,860
I'll see you tonight.
Bye.

1087
01:23:52,943 --> 01:23:54,433
Come with me.

1088
01:23:55,879 --> 01:23:57,278
Precious?

1089
01:23:59,116 --> 01:24:00,583
Excuse me?

1090
01:24:02,519 --> 01:24:04,612
Nurse say I'm HIV positive.

1091
01:24:11,261 --> 01:24:13,786
I ain't got nothing to write today.

1092
01:24:15,632 --> 01:24:17,293
Is your baby okay?

1093
01:24:18,368 --> 01:24:21,735
He all right.
I just got to stop breastfeeding him.

1094
01:24:25,442 --> 01:24:27,603
Remember, you once told me

1095
01:24:28,112 --> 01:24:30,979
you never really got to tell your story.

1096
01:24:32,449 --> 01:24:34,474
- Write.
- Fuck you!

1097
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:37,977
You know nothing
of what I've been through.

1098
01:24:39,156 --> 01:24:41,488
I ain't never had no boyfriend.

1099
01:24:44,161 --> 01:24:46,755
My daddy said he gonna marry me.

1100
01:24:47,431 --> 01:24:50,730
How he gonna do that?
It would fucking be illegal!

1101
01:25:06,984 --> 01:25:08,178
Write.

1102
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,845
I'm tired, Ms. Rain.

1103
01:25:13,757 --> 01:25:16,920
If not for yourself,
then for the people who love you.

1104
01:25:16,994 --> 01:25:18,791
Nobody loves me.

1105
01:25:18,862 --> 01:25:21,126
people do love you, Precious.

1106
01:25:21,598 --> 01:25:24,032
please don't lie to me, Ms. Rain.

1107
01:25:24,868 --> 01:25:27,268
Love ain't done nothing for me.

1108
01:25:28,305 --> 01:25:31,706
Love beat me, raped me,

1109
01:25:33,143 --> 01:25:37,136
called me an animal,
make me feel worthless.

1110
01:25:37,815 --> 01:25:39,373
Make me sick.

1111
01:25:41,718 --> 01:25:43,811
That wasn't love, Precious.

1112
01:25:45,889 --> 01:25:47,720
Your baby loves you.

1113
01:25:51,028 --> 01:25:52,495
I love you.

1114
01:25:59,803 --> 01:26:01,031
Write.

1115
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,914
What are you thinking?

1116
01:26:14,084 --> 01:26:18,316
You never told me about
your relationship with your mother.

1117
01:26:21,058 --> 01:26:22,719
I didn't, did i?

1118
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:26,021
Really, I'm here to help you.

1119
01:26:26,096 --> 01:26:29,259
You can talk to me.
This is a safe environment.

1120
01:26:30,601 --> 01:26:32,000
You're right.

1121
01:26:32,069 --> 01:26:34,594
We could talk about your daddy instead.

1122
01:26:34,705 --> 01:26:37,538
We could talk about my mother, my father,

1123
01:26:37,608 --> 01:26:42,011
my aunts or my sister or my brother,
but none of it's gonna help you.

1124
01:26:42,679 --> 01:26:44,169
You don't even like me.

1125
01:26:44,248 --> 01:26:47,274
Have we not been in this room together

1126
01:26:47,384 --> 01:26:50,615
for, like, a year, discussing your life?

1127
01:26:50,721 --> 01:26:53,713
Does that mean we like each other,
because we discuss my life?

1128
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:55,257
I can't speak for you.

1129
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:59,796
I can only speak for me,
and I do like you. I do.

1130
01:27:00,464 --> 01:27:02,295
So, are you Italian, or...

1131
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:03,696
What color are you, anyway?

1132
01:27:03,767 --> 01:27:05,860
Are you some type of black or Spanish?

1133
01:27:05,936 --> 01:27:08,131
What color do you think I am?

1134
01:27:10,107 --> 01:27:13,440
No, I'd like to know.
What color do you think I am?

1135
01:27:14,278 --> 01:27:15,973
My throat is dry.

1136
01:27:16,813 --> 01:27:18,576
Your throat is dry?

1137
01:27:18,982 --> 01:27:20,711
It's really hot in here.

1138
01:27:20,784 --> 01:27:22,877
It is kind of hot in here.

1139
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:26,287
I'm gonna go get a soda.
What do you want?

1140
01:27:26,657 --> 01:27:28,488
Soda sounds fine.

1141
01:27:28,592 --> 01:27:29,991
All right.

1142
01:28:00,524 --> 01:28:02,014
Thank you.

1143
01:28:02,626 --> 01:28:04,093
No problem.

1144
01:28:07,798 --> 01:28:10,995
So, I have to talk to
you about your mother,

1145
01:28:11,535 --> 01:28:13,867
and I don't know
how you're gonna feel about this,

1146
01:28:13,971 --> 01:28:16,701
but she says she wants to see you

1147
01:28:16,807 --> 01:28:21,437
and she wants to be reunited
with you and her grandchildren.

1148
01:28:22,012 --> 01:28:24,981
She wants to come
and have a session here with you.

1149
01:28:25,048 --> 01:28:26,640
What did you tell her?

1150
01:28:26,717 --> 01:28:29,550
I said I had to speak to you about it.

1151
01:28:32,189 --> 01:28:33,622
It's up to you.

1152
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:36,659
I don't know.
I never thought about it before.

1153
01:28:38,195 --> 01:28:40,686
Ms. Weiss said in that file I got HIV.

1154
01:28:40,797 --> 01:28:43,197
She said I was supposed to die from it.

1155
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:45,325
I ain't worried about dying.

1156
01:28:45,402 --> 01:28:49,361
Shit, I gotta worry about
how I'm supposed to raise these kids.

1157
01:28:50,374 --> 01:28:52,865
I was just writing, like, about...

1158
01:28:53,577 --> 01:28:55,670
I wanna open up this clinic

1159
01:28:55,746 --> 01:28:58,977
about, like, mothers and their children.

1160
01:28:59,816 --> 01:29:02,842
You know, just,
if they're sick or something like that.

1161
01:29:02,919 --> 01:29:06,582
I always wanted to do that,
give back to the community.

1162
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:09,557
Because I know my mom would be
proud of me if I did that,

1163
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:11,320
and my children, too.

1164
01:29:11,395 --> 01:29:15,092
I want my children to be proud
of their mother, you know?

1165
01:29:16,233 --> 01:29:20,761
- That's always what I wanted to do, so...
- That's good. That's really nice.

1166
01:29:24,374 --> 01:29:28,834
I don't really want to read the whole thing,
I kind of just wanna say what it's about.

1167
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,709
Okay, the counselors
at Advanoement House,

1168
01:29:35,552 --> 01:29:38,043
they were quizzing me
about my mother and my father, right?

1169
01:29:38,121 --> 01:29:39,884
But it's not really about them.

1170
01:29:39,956 --> 01:29:42,049
They're trying to get me to do workfare.

1171
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:44,525
- They want me to be a home attendant.
- How do you know?

1172
01:29:44,594 --> 01:29:46,892
Because I stole my file and I read it.

1173
01:29:46,963 --> 01:29:48,897
All they want me to do is work.

1174
01:29:48,965 --> 01:29:52,230
Now, I do wanna work,
but not for no welfare check.

1175
01:29:52,302 --> 01:29:53,735
What kind of sense that make,

1176
01:29:53,804 --> 01:29:56,739
for somebody like Precious to quit school
before she got her GED

1177
01:29:56,807 --> 01:29:59,435
and go work
for some old white people somewhere?

1178
01:29:59,543 --> 01:30:02,603
She ain't never gonna be nothing
if she gets stuck in some shit like that.

1179
01:30:02,712 --> 01:30:04,202
Rhonda used to home attend.

1180
01:30:04,281 --> 01:30:07,273
She used to have to go all the way out
to Brighton Beach.

1181
01:30:07,384 --> 01:30:10,717
Yeah, okay, Rhonda would be
working there all day and night.

1182
01:30:10,787 --> 01:30:12,812
She'd be on call, right?

1183
01:30:13,256 --> 01:30:17,454
She made $6.37 an hour,
but for only eight hours.

1184
01:30:18,061 --> 01:30:20,154
That equal out to $50.96.

1185
01:30:21,164 --> 01:30:22,597
But that's not a whole lot of money,

1186
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:25,794
especially 'cause,
for real, she there for 24 hours.

1187
01:30:25,902 --> 01:30:30,601
So, $50.96 divided by 24

1188
01:30:30,674 --> 01:30:34,610
is $2.12 an hour.
That's not a lot of money.

1189
01:30:34,678 --> 01:30:39,081
She said that old bitch would ring a bell,
like, a real-life, actual bell

1190
01:30:39,149 --> 01:30:40,980
when she wanted something from her
in the middle of the night.

1191
01:30:41,084 --> 01:30:43,780
- You don't want to do that shit.
- Rhonda, is that true? Rhonda!

1192
01:30:43,854 --> 01:30:46,914
Them home attendants be working for, like,
six days a week.

1193
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:50,858
I'd only see Abdul on Sunday.
plus, I'd have to leave class.

1194
01:30:51,194 --> 01:30:54,493
Well, that's not an option.
You're not leaving class.

1195
01:30:54,598 --> 01:30:57,692
plus, I'm gonna start going to
insect survivor meetings.

1196
01:30:57,801 --> 01:30:59,291
It's "incest."

1197
01:31:01,037 --> 01:31:04,200
- That ain't what I said?
- No, you said "insect."

1198
01:31:04,808 --> 01:31:06,105
What's the difference?

1199
01:31:06,176 --> 01:31:07,973
Well, one's where your family molests you,

1200
01:31:08,044 --> 01:31:10,706
the other's like a roach or bugs.

1201
01:31:13,383 --> 01:31:16,011
- So, you a scientist now?
- I'm just saying.

1202
01:31:16,119 --> 01:31:18,883
No, that's cool.
Thank you. Thank you.

1203
01:31:25,061 --> 01:31:28,656
It was hard telling them strangers there
what my father did.

1204
01:31:28,732 --> 01:31:30,723
Sometimes it felt good.

1205
01:31:36,006 --> 01:31:40,204
Last week, Ms. Rain asked us
to write down what we wanna be like.

1206
01:31:40,644 --> 01:31:44,171
I wrote that I be real skinny,

1207
01:31:44,915 --> 01:31:47,145
with light skin and long hair.

1208
01:31:48,585 --> 01:31:50,246
Loretha Holloway?

1209
01:31:51,488 --> 01:31:52,580
Go on back there.

1210
01:31:52,689 --> 01:31:54,520
She read it and said
I'm beautiful like I am.

1211
01:31:54,591 --> 01:31:58,083
But, there's no kids back there
for me to play with.

1212
01:32:00,263 --> 01:32:02,231
Just shut up and sit there, then.

1213
01:32:02,332 --> 01:32:05,699
Gonna talk to this lady
before my shit gets cut off.

1214
01:32:05,769 --> 01:32:07,236
But somehow,

1215
01:32:08,371 --> 01:32:11,602
right now...
And I don't know why, but...

1216
01:32:13,743 --> 01:32:15,506
I think she right.

1217
01:32:21,885 --> 01:32:22,943
Here.

1218
01:32:31,628 --> 01:32:33,255
Claireece Jones?

1219
01:32:39,236 --> 01:32:41,227
I think she right.

1220
01:32:46,476 --> 01:32:48,569
Okay, Mrs. Johnston,
let's talk about the abuse.

1221
01:32:48,645 --> 01:32:50,875
There were no drugs in my house.

1222
01:32:50,947 --> 01:32:52,915
I didn't play that.
There weren't no drugs in my house.

1223
01:32:52,983 --> 01:32:54,644
Precious knew I would whup her ass

1224
01:32:54,751 --> 01:32:56,241
if she gonna bring some drugs
up in my house.

1225
01:32:56,319 --> 01:32:58,719
You know what I'm talking about.

1226
01:32:59,823 --> 01:33:04,988
I'm referring to specific
sexual and physical acts

1227
01:33:05,562 --> 01:33:07,325
involving Precious.

1228
01:33:07,998 --> 01:33:09,989
Why you ain't say that?

1229
01:33:10,734 --> 01:33:12,326
Yes, that.

1230
01:33:14,404 --> 01:33:16,304
What do you wanna know?

1231
01:33:16,406 --> 01:33:18,397
According to Precious' files,

1232
01:33:18,475 --> 01:33:22,502
she has now had two children
by your boyfriend,

1233
01:33:22,612 --> 01:33:26,844
the late Carl Kenwood Jones,
who was also her father.

1234
01:33:33,156 --> 01:33:35,147
- Yeah.
- This is accurate?

1235
01:33:37,594 --> 01:33:39,357
Yes, Ms. Weiss.

1236
01:33:39,863 --> 01:33:42,957
I need to know why you're here.
You've been calling this office

1237
01:33:43,033 --> 01:33:46,969
saying you want to be reunited
with Precious and your grandchild.

1238
01:33:47,037 --> 01:33:50,529
Now, I really need to know
what's gone on in that home.

1239
01:33:47,037 --> 01:33:50,529
Now, I really need to know
what's gone on in that home.

1240
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,767
Ms. Weiss,
I understand we need to discuss it,

1241
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,767
Ms. Weiss,
I understand we need to discuss it,

1242
01:33:52,842 --> 01:33:54,173
but I'm just telling you.

1243
01:33:52,842 --> 01:33:54,173
but I'm just telling you.

1244
01:33:54,277 --> 01:33:57,007
You said I've been calling here
and I've been wanting to see

1245
01:33:54,277 --> 01:33:57,007
You said I've been calling here
and I've been wanting to see

1246
01:33:57,113 --> 01:33:58,546
Precious and my grandson.

1247
01:33:57,113 --> 01:33:58,546
Precious and my grandson.

1248
01:33:58,648 --> 01:34:03,142
You're goddamn right I wanna see them.
Because they belong to me. Okay?

1249
01:33:58,648 --> 01:34:03,142
You're goddamn right I wanna see them.
Because they belong to me. Okay?

1250
01:34:03,219 --> 01:34:06,279
Now, there was a time
Precious had everything,

1251
01:34:03,219 --> 01:34:06,279
Now, there was a time
Precious had everything,

1252
01:34:06,356 --> 01:34:08,153
and I done told her that.

1253
01:34:06,356 --> 01:34:08,153
and I done told her that.

1254
01:34:08,224 --> 01:34:11,853
And me and Carl, we loved Precious.
And you need to know that.

1255
01:34:08,224 --> 01:34:11,853
And me and Carl, we loved Precious.
And you need to know that.

1256
01:34:11,961 --> 01:34:14,657
We loved Precious and we had dreams.

1257
01:34:11,961 --> 01:34:14,657
We loved Precious and we had dreams.

1258
01:34:14,731 --> 01:34:19,464
Precious was born around the same time
Ms. West's son got killed.

1259
01:34:14,731 --> 01:34:19,464
Precious was born around the same time
Ms. West's son got killed.

1260
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:24,906
The summer time.
She was born in the summer time.

1261
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:24,906
The summer time.
She was born in the summer time.

1262
01:34:25,008 --> 01:34:26,999
Remember?
Remember that?

1263
01:34:25,008 --> 01:34:26,999
Remember?
Remember that?

1264
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:29,244
I was born in November.

1265
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:29,244
I was born in November.

1266
01:34:29,746 --> 01:34:31,304
November.

1267
01:34:29,746 --> 01:34:31,304
November.

1268
01:34:32,182 --> 01:34:34,650
Yeah, that's right.

1269
01:34:32,182 --> 01:34:34,650
Yeah, that's right.

1270
01:34:35,919 --> 01:34:37,819
My Scorpio child.

1271
01:34:35,919 --> 01:34:37,819
My Scorpio child.

1272
01:34:39,989 --> 01:34:41,422
You know...

1273
01:34:39,989 --> 01:34:41,422
You know...

1274
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:46,185
Scorpios, they can be tricky.

1275
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:46,185
Scorpios, they can be tricky.

1276
01:34:47,397 --> 01:34:51,925
And, I'm not saying that they lie.
I'm not saying that.

1277
01:34:47,397 --> 01:34:51,925
And, I'm not saying that they lie.
I'm not saying that.

1278
01:34:52,502 --> 01:34:54,834
But you just gotta watch them.

1279
01:34:52,502 --> 01:34:54,834
But you just gotta watch them.

1280
01:34:58,775 --> 01:35:02,575
Can we talk about the actual acts

1281
01:34:58,775 --> 01:35:02,575
Can we talk about the actual acts

1282
01:35:02,679 --> 01:35:05,375
of physical and sexual abuse

1283
01:35:02,679 --> 01:35:05,375
of physical and sexual abuse

1284
01:35:05,448 --> 01:35:07,916
that occurred in your household?

1285
01:35:05,448 --> 01:35:07,916
that occurred in your household?

1286
01:35:08,518 --> 01:35:10,042
When it first began,

1287
01:35:08,518 --> 01:35:10,042
When it first began,

1288
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:13,112
where it happened
and how did you respond?

1289
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:13,112
where it happened
and how did you respond?

1290
01:35:19,529 --> 01:35:21,690
Precious was a little girl.

1291
01:35:19,529 --> 01:35:21,690
Precious was a little girl.

1292
01:35:23,133 --> 01:35:26,125
Try and remember
how old you think she was.

1293
01:35:23,133 --> 01:35:26,125
Try and remember
how old you think she was.

1294
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:31,964
She was three.

1295
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:31,964
She was three.

1296
01:35:33,943 --> 01:35:37,401
And I had been giving her the bottle

1297
01:35:33,943 --> 01:35:37,401
And I had been giving her the bottle

1298
01:35:39,315 --> 01:35:41,783
and I was giving Carl the tittie

1299
01:35:39,315 --> 01:35:41,783
and I was giving Carl the tittie

1300
01:35:42,152 --> 01:35:46,213
because my milk hadn't dried up
in my breasts

1301
01:35:42,152 --> 01:35:46,213
because my milk hadn't dried up
in my breasts

1302
01:35:47,323 --> 01:35:50,656
but not from her,
but because Carl was...

1303
01:35:47,323 --> 01:35:50,656
but not from her,
but because Carl was...

1304
01:35:51,828 --> 01:35:53,762
Because Carl was sucking on them

1305
01:35:51,828 --> 01:35:53,762
Because Carl was sucking on them

1306
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:57,664
and that's what kept my milk in my breasts.

1307
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:57,664
and that's what kept my milk in my breasts.

1308
01:36:00,403 --> 01:36:03,167
And I thought that
that was for hygiene.

1309
01:36:00,403 --> 01:36:03,167
And I thought that
that was for hygiene.

1310
01:36:04,107 --> 01:36:06,837
I did what my mother told me

1311
01:36:04,107 --> 01:36:06,837
I did what my mother told me

1312
01:36:07,444 --> 01:36:11,312
that I was supposed to do with my child,
so that's what I did.

1313
01:36:07,444 --> 01:36:11,312
that I was supposed to do with my child,
so that's what I did.

1314
01:36:11,781 --> 01:36:14,443
And you're sitting up there
and you're trying to judge me...

1315
01:36:11,781 --> 01:36:14,443
And you're sitting up there
and you're trying to judge me...

1316
01:36:14,517 --> 01:36:17,350
I'm not judging you,
but you're asking me for money

1317
01:36:14,517 --> 01:36:17,350
I'm not judging you,
but you're asking me for money

1318
01:36:17,454 --> 01:36:19,854
and you're asking me
to be reunited with your grandson.

1319
01:36:17,454 --> 01:36:19,854
and you're asking me
to be reunited with your grandson.

1320
01:36:19,956 --> 01:36:22,356
But, Ms. Weiss,
I don't like you looking at me like that.

1321
01:36:19,956 --> 01:36:22,356
But, Ms. Weiss,
I don't like you looking at me like that.

1322
01:36:22,525 --> 01:36:25,983
You got this bitch looking at me
like I'm some kind of fucking monster.

1323
01:36:22,525 --> 01:36:25,983
You got this bitch looking at me
like I'm some kind of fucking monster.

1324
01:36:26,095 --> 01:36:27,995
We don't talk like
this in my office, okay?

1325
01:36:26,095 --> 01:36:27,995
We don't talk like
this in my office, okay?

1326
01:36:28,097 --> 01:36:31,624
I didn't want her suoking behind him,
because that was nasty.

1327
01:36:28,097 --> 01:36:31,624
I didn't want her suoking behind him,
because that was nasty.

1328
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:35,432
And things that he was...
It was just nasty, Ms. Weiss.

1329
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:35,432
And things that he was...
It was just nasty, Ms. Weiss.

1330
01:36:41,044 --> 01:36:44,673
I had a man,
and I have a child

1331
01:36:41,044 --> 01:36:44,673
I had a man,
and I have a child

1332
01:36:46,483 --> 01:36:50,317
and I had to take care of both of them.
Okay?

1333
01:36:46,483 --> 01:36:50,317
and I had to take care of both of them.
Okay?

1334
01:36:51,988 --> 01:36:56,982
Did I want Carl to touch my baby?

1335
01:36:51,988 --> 01:36:56,982
Did I want Carl to touch my baby?

1336
01:36:59,062 --> 01:37:01,394
Because I would lay my baby.

1337
01:36:59,062 --> 01:37:01,394
Because I would lay my baby.

1338
01:37:01,498 --> 01:37:06,128
I would lay her on the side of me,
on this pillow

1339
01:37:01,498 --> 01:37:06,128
I would lay her on the side of me,
on this pillow

1340
01:37:07,871 --> 01:37:10,032
and it was pink

1341
01:37:07,871 --> 01:37:10,032
and it was pink

1342
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:13,800
and it had this little white writing on it

1343
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:13,800
and it had this little white writing on it

1344
01:37:13,877 --> 01:37:18,007
and it had her name,
because she was Precious.

1345
01:37:13,877 --> 01:37:18,007
and it had her name,
because she was Precious.

1346
01:37:18,915 --> 01:37:21,247
And I would lay my baby on that pillow

1347
01:37:18,915 --> 01:37:21,247
And I would lay my baby on that pillow

1348
01:37:21,351 --> 01:37:24,718
and Carl would be laying on the other side

1349
01:37:21,351 --> 01:37:24,718
and Carl would be laying on the other side

1350
01:37:26,155 --> 01:37:30,023
and then we would...
We would start doing it

1351
01:37:26,155 --> 01:37:30,023
and then we would...
We would start doing it

1352
01:37:30,093 --> 01:37:32,220
and he reached over

1353
01:37:30,093 --> 01:37:32,220
and he reached over

1354
01:37:34,531 --> 01:37:36,522
and he touched my baby.

1355
01:37:34,531 --> 01:37:36,522
and he touched my baby.

1356
01:37:36,599 --> 01:37:38,157
And I asked him,

1357
01:37:36,599 --> 01:37:38,157
And I asked him,

1358
01:37:38,935 --> 01:37:41,529
I said,
"Carl, what are you doing?"

1359
01:37:38,935 --> 01:37:41,529
I said,
"Carl, what are you doing?"

1360
01:37:41,604 --> 01:37:44,038
And he told me to shut...

1361
01:37:41,604 --> 01:37:44,038
And he told me to shut...

1362
01:37:44,107 --> 01:37:47,099
To shut my fat ass up,
and it was good for her.

1363
01:37:44,107 --> 01:37:47,099
To shut my fat ass up,
and it was good for her.

1364
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:50,441
- And what did you do then?
- I shut my fat ass up.

1365
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:50,441
- And what did you do then?
- I shut my fat ass up.

1366
01:37:50,947 --> 01:37:54,280
And I don't want you to sit there
and judge me, Ms. Weiss.

1367
01:37:50,947 --> 01:37:54,280
And I don't want you to sit there
and judge me, Ms. Weiss.

1368
01:37:54,384 --> 01:37:56,113
You shut up
and you let him abuse your daughter?

1369
01:37:54,384 --> 01:37:56,113
You shut up
and you let him abuse your daughter?

1370
01:37:56,219 --> 01:37:58,187
I did not want him
to abuse my daughter.

1371
01:37:56,219 --> 01:37:58,187
I did not want him
to abuse my daughter.

1372
01:37:58,288 --> 01:37:59,755
- I did not want him to hurt her.
- But you allowed him

1373
01:37:58,288 --> 01:37:59,755
- I did not want him to hurt her.
- But you allowed him

1374
01:37:59,856 --> 01:38:01,721
- to hurt her.
- I did not want him to do nothing to her.

1375
01:37:59,856 --> 01:38:01,721
- to hurt her.
- I did not want him to do nothing to her.

1376
01:38:01,791 --> 01:38:03,725
I wanted him to make love to me.

1377
01:38:01,791 --> 01:38:03,725
I wanted him to make love to me.

1378
01:38:03,793 --> 01:38:06,785
That was my man.
That was my fucking man.

1379
01:38:03,793 --> 01:38:06,785
That was my man.
That was my fucking man.

1380
01:38:06,963 --> 01:38:09,796
That was my man
and he wanted my daughter.

1381
01:38:06,963 --> 01:38:09,796
That was my man
and he wanted my daughter.

1382
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,398
And that's why I hated her.

1383
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,398
And that's why I hated her.

1384
01:38:13,469 --> 01:38:16,461
Because my man,
who was supposed to be loving me,

1385
01:38:13,469 --> 01:38:16,461
Because my man,
who was supposed to be loving me,

1386
01:38:16,573 --> 01:38:19,406
who was supposed
to be making love to me,

1387
01:38:16,573 --> 01:38:19,406
who was supposed
to be making love to me,

1388
01:38:20,476 --> 01:38:22,740
was fucking my baby.

1389
01:38:20,476 --> 01:38:22,740
was fucking my baby.

1390
01:38:22,812 --> 01:38:26,441
She made him leave.
She made him go away.

1391
01:38:22,812 --> 01:38:26,441
She made him leave.
She made him go away.

1392
01:38:26,983 --> 01:38:28,109
So, whose fault was it, then?

1393
01:38:26,983 --> 01:38:28,109
So, whose fault was it, then?

1394
01:38:28,217 --> 01:38:31,380
It's this bitch's fault
because she let my man have her

1395
01:38:28,217 --> 01:38:31,380
It's this bitch's fault
because she let my man have her

1396
01:38:31,454 --> 01:38:33,046
and she didn't say nothing.

1397
01:38:31,454 --> 01:38:33,046
and she didn't say nothing.

1398
01:38:33,122 --> 01:38:35,113
She didn't scream.
She didn't do nothing.

1399
01:38:33,122 --> 01:38:35,113
She didn't scream.
She didn't do nothing.

1400
01:38:35,224 --> 01:38:38,751
So, those things she told you
I did to her,

1401
01:38:35,224 --> 01:38:38,751
So, those things she told you
I did to her,

1402
01:38:38,828 --> 01:38:41,991
who else was gonna love me?

1403
01:38:38,828 --> 01:38:41,991
who else was gonna love me?

1404
01:38:45,001 --> 01:38:48,630
Since you got your degree
and you know every-fucking-thing,

1405
01:38:45,001 --> 01:38:48,630
Since you got your degree
and you know every-fucking-thing,

1406
01:38:48,738 --> 01:38:52,765
who was gonna love me,
who was gonna make me feel good?

1407
01:38:48,738 --> 01:38:52,765
who was gonna love me,
who was gonna make me feel good?

1408
01:38:52,842 --> 01:38:56,505
Who was gonna touch me
and make me feel good late at night?

1409
01:38:52,842 --> 01:38:56,505
Who was gonna touch me
and make me feel good late at night?

1326
01:

1410
01:38:56,613 --> 01:38:59,138
And she made him go away, so...

1411
01:38:59,916 --> 01:39:03,408
When you sit there and you write
them fucking notes on your pad

1412
01:39:03,486 --> 01:39:07,513
about who you think I am,
and why I did it, all of that.

1413
01:39:08,858 --> 01:39:11,088
Because I didn't have nobody.

1414
01:39:19,869 --> 01:39:23,032
The people from

1415
01:39:24,674 --> 01:39:26,699
Each One Teach One,

1416
01:39:27,443 --> 01:39:30,378
they had...
They called me

1417
01:39:33,349 --> 01:39:36,443
and they told me that my baby
was writing poems.

1418
01:39:36,519 --> 01:39:38,009
In fact, you know what,
I got...

1419
01:39:38,121 --> 01:39:39,679
Wait a minute.

1420
01:40:05,682 --> 01:40:07,149
I'm sorry.

1421
01:40:08,151 --> 01:40:11,518
I'm sorry.
And, Ms. Weiss, I don't want no checks.

1422
01:40:11,587 --> 01:40:15,819
I don't need no more money. please.
I'm so sorry.

1423
01:40:16,726 --> 01:40:18,887
I took that TABE test again.

1424
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,222
And what happened?

1425
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:22,991
I scored a 7.8.

1426
01:40:24,701 --> 01:40:26,601
Last time it was 2.8.

1427
01:40:29,005 --> 01:40:30,370
According to that test,

1428
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,170
I'm reading at
a seventh and eighth-grade level.

1429
01:40:34,444 --> 01:40:37,607
Next year, high school.
Atter that, college.

1430
01:40:44,187 --> 01:40:45,950
Well, I like you, too.

1431
01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:50,350
But you can't handle me.

1432
01:40:52,128 --> 01:40:54,460
You can't handle none of this.

1433
01:41:02,405 --> 01:41:05,806
You know, I never knew what you was
until this day.

1434
01:41:05,908 --> 01:41:08,638
Not even atter all them things you did.

1435
01:41:10,146 --> 01:41:13,638
Maybe I was too stupid, or
maybe I just didn't want to.

1436
01:41:16,119 --> 01:41:18,451
You ain't gonna see me no more.

1437
01:41:22,058 --> 01:41:23,320
Bye!

1438
01:41:27,063 --> 01:41:28,928
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1439
01:41:28,998 --> 01:41:31,432
Please, God,
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1440
01:41:31,501 --> 01:41:34,402
Ms. Weiss,
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1441
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:36,267
I would say to him,
I would say...

1442
01:41:36,339 --> 01:41:39,604
"Carl, what are you doing?
What are you doing? What are you doing?"

1443
01:41:48,684 --> 01:41:50,276
Can you go get her back?

1444
01:41:50,353 --> 01:41:52,947
You can do that,
because that's what you do.

1445
01:41:53,022 --> 01:41:54,853
That's what you do.

1446
01:41:55,291 --> 01:41:58,988
I need you to go
and I need you to get my baby back.

1447
01:41:59,095 --> 01:42:02,690
You told me that I could come in here
and you could get...

1448
01:42:03,166 --> 01:42:04,633
You could get Precious to say...

1449
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:07,191
Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss?
