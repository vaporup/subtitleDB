1
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:54,205
Come on, Kelly, let's go.

2
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,129
Let's get the hot food
out to the customers.

3
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,983
Who the hell
eats hot dog food, anyway?

4
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:05,082
What the--you stupid moron!

5
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,029
What the hell is wrong with you?

6
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:09,014
Why don't you watch
what you're doing?

7
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:11,064
What do you need--
a red light and a green light?

8
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:12,664
Come on.
Get this stuff cleared up.

9
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:13,980
Jeez, how many times...

10
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:16,404
Vicky! l don't believe it!

11
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:19,164
What are you doing here?
How have you been?

12
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,371
God, you look great.
Look at you.

13
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:24,124
Thanks. You know, the one good
thing about dancing in Vegas...

14
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,436
is it does keep you in shape.

15
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,122
-lt's been a while.
-Yeah, it has been a long time.

16
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:30,330
But l see you haven't
lost any of your moves.

17
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:31,894
l'm keeping in shape.

18
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,139
l figure l still have
a few good months left in me.

19
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:35,897
l am pushing 20, you know.

20
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:37,757
Have you thought
about a second career?

21
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,725
Never. l'll die on my toes.

22
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:43,635
Dancing or...working here?

23
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:47,732
Look, all l know is
you're slaving away...

24
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:50,228
in this grease trap,
and you're not dancing.

25
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,676
You know, l still have
Franco's classes...

26
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:52,919
and they're so important to me.

27
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,648
Are you still with Franco?

28
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:56,059
Yeah. He's the best.

29
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:58,068
At dancing, maybe. You forget
who you're talking to.

30
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,189
l know the routine.

31
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:01,138
lt's the same thing
with all the girls.

32
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,228
l don't want to get
heavy-handed...

33
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:03,196
but you be careful of him.

34
00:04:03,228 --> 00:04:05,301
-Kelly!
-l have to go.

35
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:07,796
Listen, there's a friend
of mine--James Wilcox.

36
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:09,265
He's an agent here in L.A.

37
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:10,802
Give him a call.
He might be able to help.

38
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:11,827
Kelly!

39
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:18,772
Down here.

40
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:20,121
That's it. Now!

41
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:23,635
Down here. Come on, Kelly.
Come on. You're leading them.

42
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:26,393
Now, reach back. You're late.

43
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:29,242
That's it. Come on.
That's it. Turn. Reach.

44
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:31,348
Use the whole body.
Come on. Move across now.

45
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:33,591
Cross the floor. Back. Come on.

46
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:36,212
Up. Now, that's it.
Up, down. Hit the floor.

47
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:40,117
Back...and down.

48
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,041
Reach. That's it.

49
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,463
Pull back. Come on.
Come on, now.

50
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:50,485
Reach across. And hup 3, hup 5,
hup down, hup 2...

51
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:51,765
hup back!

52
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:54,894
That's it. Thank you.

53
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:13,175
-l'm serious.
-Just get out of here.

54
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,702
Come on. You promised.

55
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:15,792
l know.

56
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:22,960
You're looking better.

57
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:28,309
You still got to learn
to relax, though.

58
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,034
-l'll work at it.
-Loosen up.

59
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,708
Let the music caress you
when you move.

60
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:39,852
Look, l got a couple of minutes.
You want to stay and work?

61
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,122
-l'm sorry. l've got to go.
-Kelly...

62
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:46,101
l'm a very good teacher.

63
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:50,483
lf there's anybody who knows
what you need, it's me.

64
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:54,865
Nothing but the best
for the best, huh, baby?

65
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:58,957
l know someone
who'd argue that point.

66
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:12,244
Did mommy forget
to pick you up again?

67
00:06:12,276 --> 00:06:14,643
Cute, Kelly. Some people
love you for your body.

68
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:17,098
Me, it's your charming wit.

69
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,409
So what did Our Almightiness
want this time?

70
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,997
lt wasn't my charming wit,
Cupcakes.

71
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:23,946
Do you want to go for a bite?

72
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,165
No. actually,
l was supposed to meet...

73
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:26,665
some dear,
close friends of mine...

74
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,081
but it's way out in Venice...

75
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:30,123
and l'd hate to take you
out of your way.

76
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:31,407
l'll ride the bus.

77
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:34,930
Well, at least let me drop
you off at the bus stop.

78
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:37,035
Really, Kelly, l think
you'd love to meet these guys.

79
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:38,384
They're terrific.

80
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,419
l guarantee you they won't want
you for your body or your wit.

81
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,668
That's a relief.

82
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:45,096
But l'd definitely keep
an eye on your purse.

83
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,732
Nice, Cupcakes. Nice.

84
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,777
You promised me
you wouldn't call me that.

85
00:06:48,818 --> 00:06:50,858
l can't help it.
You're just so cute.

86
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:52,043
Would you stop?

87
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,358
There they are over there.

88
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:24,109
l tell you, Kelly,
you're really gonna love this.

89
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,762
Hurry up. l don't want
you to miss anything.

90
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,938
-Should l wear my coat?
-No. You don't need it.

91
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:31,686
Come on.

92
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:37,991
Come on. Up here.

93
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:04,743
-Ozone!
-Hey, Adam!

94
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:06,341
Hey, man, Adam!
What's happenin'?

95
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,553
Nothing much, man.
This is Kelly.

96
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:10,917
Hi.

97
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:17,801
Come on. Let's do some of
the stuff we do in class.

98
00:08:17,837 --> 00:08:20,455
-Oh, no. You kidding?
-Come on. lt'll be fun.

99
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:22,859
-Not here.
-Come on!

100
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:29,195
Five, six, seven, eight.

101
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,108
Come on.

102
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:47,235
Watch him.

103
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:54,023
-l can't do that.
-Try. OK. All right!

104
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,003
Come on, Kelly. Get down.

105
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,591
Show us what you got.

106
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,534
-All right, Miss Bennett!
-Good!

107
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:27,645
Go turn 'em out, man.

108
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:33,917
Kelly.

109
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,078
Get 'em!

110
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:44,607
Come on.

111
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:59,939
-Let's go.
-Let's get out of here.

112
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,567
-Let's go get something to eat.
-OK.

113
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:03,842
Ozone, wait up.

114
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:04,925
What's up, dude?

115
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:06,492
Who was that guy?

116
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,515
That was nothing.

117
00:10:07,557 --> 00:10:08,964
Hey, wasn't she hot?

118
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:10,689
Oh, God. l feel so silly.

119
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,310
No, you were good.
Hey, wasn't she hot, Turbo?

120
00:10:14,565 --> 00:10:16,190
You guys weren't
so bad yourselves.

121
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,636
Oh, allow me. Kelly...

122
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:20,124
the mean machine right there--
that's Turbo.

123
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,751
Hi. What kind of names
are Ozone and Turbo?

124
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,676
The kind of names
that only a few people...

125
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,138
are allowed to call us by.

126
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:30,782
-They're our street names.
-All the dancers have them.

127
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,893
Really? Well, then why
do you get so upset...

128
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,394
when l call you Cupcakes?

129
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:36,573
Cupcakes!

130
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,538
All right, enough already.

131
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,035
Well, l've got to run.
l've got a lot of things to do.

132
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,504
Thanks for the dance.

133
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:47,002
Sure. Anytime.
Maybe we'll see you again, huh?

134
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:48,669
-Maybe.
-And who knows?

135
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:50,649
With a little work,
you'll be poppin' and lockin'...

136
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,705
and breakin' in no time.

137
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:53,569
You owe me one, Miss Bennett.

138
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:55,097
l'll see you later.

139
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,297
Special K!

140
00:10:58,338 --> 00:10:59,800
What?

141
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:03,071
Special K. Any good dancer
has a street name.

142
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,933
Man, l should have got
her number. Look at her.

143
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:30,461
What are we doing here?
We're gonna see Adam tonight.

144
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:31,926
Do you think l'm here
to see Adam?

145
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:36,349
What, are you falling
in love again?

146
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:38,872
No, man. l just like the way
she dances, all right?

147
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:46,230
Girls!

148
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:51,798
Don't you worry. l got
the finest dancers available.

149
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,937
ln fact, l suspect it's not even
going to be a contest.

150
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:57,276
No, l...

151
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,660
l think that l can guarantee you
that we're going to win.

152
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:17,879
Well, this is a surprise.

153
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:20,284
Hi, Ozone. Hi, Turbo.

154
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:22,007
The name's Tony.

155
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:25,361
OK, Tony. l had
a great time yesterday.

156
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:27,292
-Yeah?
-Yeah. lt was different.

157
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:31,734
Listen, l got
to get back to work.

158
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:32,820
You guys probably
ought to leave...

159
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,005
'cause if Franco comes
in here and sees you...

160
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,124
l'll get in a lot of trouble.

161
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:36,953
Hey, that dancing's fresh.

162
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,258
-lt's what?
-lt's bad!

163
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,084
Wait a minute, now.

164
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:55,769
Hey, Turbo!

165
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:57,232
Hey! What's up?

166
00:13:45,016 --> 00:13:48,725
You want to waste your time,
do it someplace else...

167
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,221
but don't mess with mine.

168
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:55,055
-Who are you?
-The name's Tony.

169
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:56,405
Well, as long as
you're standing there...

170
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:59,254
you're wasting my time,
and my time ain't cheap...

171
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,840
so l suggest you clear out now.

172
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,504
lf you want to take my class...

173
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,200
your name goes
on a waiting list.

174
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:11,763
lf you want to talk to him,
you talk to me.

175
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:13,391
And who might you be?

176
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,969
Orlando--
choreographer...dancer.

177
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,490
So this bit
of amateur dancing...

178
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:24,591
that my class was
so privileged to witness...

179
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,004
was your conception.

180
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,817
Come on, man.
Let's get out of here.

181
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:29,933
Since we're all here...

182
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:31,761
why don't you show us
what you've got?

183
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:42,352
-You owe me $7.00, man.
-Yeah? What for?

184
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:44,460
For teaching you
how to dance, sucker.

185
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,842
Class dismissed.

186
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,489
Don't worry about it.
They ain't nothin'.

187
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:00,393
Do you know, if we put them
on the streets, we'd burn 'em.

188
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:05,866
l'm sorry about what happened.
l tried to get them to leave.

189
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:08,111
Why were they here?

190
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:09,838
l guess they came to see me.

191
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:12,591
-You know those guys?
-l just met them once.

192
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:15,079
Well, l'd keep it that way.

193
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:19,817
Forget it.

194
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:27,341
You want to hear the music for
the show l'm choreographing?

195
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:29,101
-You got it!
-Yeah.

196
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,650
All right! Congratulations.
That's great.

197
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:35,144
You know, l may seem
tough sometimes...

198
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,007
but there's always a reason.

199
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,764
You know that, don't you?

200
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:39,978
Yeah, l know.

201
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:21,964
You know, those street kids
haven't got what it takes.

202
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:25,162
They're very talented. You
really should see them dance.

203
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:26,605
lt takes more than talent.

204
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:32,202
You got to be tough.

205
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:38,404
Now, you...

206
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,478
You've got the talent.

207
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:16,319
Head up.

208
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:20,714
Caress me. More passion.

209
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:35,551
Take the floor. Dance.
Dance...across the floor.

210
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:38,244
That's it. Now, jump.

211
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:39,972
Come on, fly.

212
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:41,416
Feel it! Up.

213
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:43,303
That's it. Now you got it.

214
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:45,864
All right, over here.

215
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:48,231
More emotion. To the mirror.

216
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,862
Feel it. All right,
now turn around.

217
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:56,511
That's it.

218
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,486
What are you doing?!

219
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:05,731
Franco, stop!

220
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:08,134
-Kelly, l just...
-Just get away from me!

221
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,211
Go to hell!

222
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:21,758
Goddamn it!

223
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,309
l'd like to thank you
for this award.

224
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,684
lt's the recognition
of my peers...

225
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:32,028
that makes all those agonizing
days of teaching Ozone...

226
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,596
everything l know that--

227
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:35,198
l don't want to stay here
all night. Do you?

228
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:40,227
Award winners don't push brooms.

229
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:42,301
Oh, yeah? Why don't you
go out and sweep, man?

230
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:45,090
Who do you think you are,
anyway--Fred Astaire?

231
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,205
Who?

232
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:47,870
Just go on and sweep,
knucklehead.

233
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,708
Hey, Turbo, did you
finish sweeping up?

234
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,789
-Yeah.
-You sure?

235
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:54,901
Yeah. You want to come
see for yourself?

236
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:56,218
All right, man.

237
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:02,267
Man, look at this stuff.

238
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,275
Look at that cup
right there, man.

239
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:06,836
Uh-oh. We've got company.

240
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:09,332
You guys are dirt, man.

241
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:10,899
We'll put you under.

242
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,078
Yeah. You're looking
at the piranha.

243
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:14,577
We're gonna eat you and...

244
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:16,954
spit out the pieces
we don't like.

245
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:18,776
Oh, yeah? Show me, man.

246
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,720
Come on, sucker, right now.

247
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:22,934
You want some?
Then come and get it.

248
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:25,043
Why don't you punks just split?

249
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,992
l think l hear
your mama calling you.

250
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:28,595
You don't like what you see?

251
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:30,642
Yeah, we're the dudes
gonna put you under.

252
00:21:30,682 --> 00:21:32,504
Yeah. You're looking
at death, man.

253
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:34,905
You'll have to put a bag over
that face to hide the shame.

254
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:36,465
Anytime, man!

255
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:38,164
Friday night.

256
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:39,445
Be there...

257
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:40,976
unless you're chicken.

258
00:21:41,018 --> 00:21:44,214
Hey, face, who are
you callin' chicken?

259
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,224
l won't blame you
if you don't show up...

260
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:48,884
'cause it's gonna be
real messy.

261
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:50,131
Oh, yeah...

262
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:52,624
and bring your girlfriend
the dancer...

263
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:54,705
'cause you're gonna need
a shoulder to cry on.

264
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:01,617
Come on.
Let's show those heifers.

265
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:03,380
Man, those dudes are whacked.

266
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,718
They don't deserve
the right to go against us.

267
00:22:05,752 --> 00:22:09,462
But you heard them.
They called us chicken.

268
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,383
Well, those dudes will just
have to wait their turn...

269
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,692
now, won't they?

270
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:15,477
What about Friday?
We're not gonna back down.

271
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:19,214
Yeah, well, if those dudes
come Friday...

272
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:22,867
and they cross that line,
we're gonna cut 'em.

273
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:43,120
We're wasting our time, man,
on a bunch of nobodies.

274
00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:45,329
You heard them.
They think they're so bad.

275
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:48,333
They're punks.
We don't got nothin' to prove.

276
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:50,828
Look, they put us down.
We can't go back on that.

277
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,625
Why not?

278
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,247
Man, everybody will bag
on us if we back down.

279
00:22:55,285 --> 00:22:58,417
What are you worried about?
You're the best, right?

280
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,016
All right. Let's turn
these fools out, man.

281
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:17,513
Come on! Let's hit it.

282
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:38,190
Hi, Kelly.

283
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:41,674
Hi. Hope you didn't
come here to eat.

284
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:44,529
Oh, no way. l respect my body.

285
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:47,689
l've missed you in class lately.

286
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,243
Been busy. Has me working
double shifts now.

287
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:54,151
Franco's been acting a little
weird the last few days.

288
00:23:54,194 --> 00:23:56,201
So what's so unusual about that?

289
00:23:57,905 --> 00:24:00,872
-Well?
-Well, what?

290
00:24:00,913 --> 00:24:03,630
Well, did anything
happen between you two?

291
00:24:03,665 --> 00:24:06,315
No! l'm just ready for a change.

292
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:08,392
l feel my life getting stale.

293
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:11,149
Stale? Like that hamburger
if the customer doesn't get it.

294
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:16,421
Hey, Earring.
You gonna order something?

295
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:19,181
Yeah. l guess l'll have
the...Health Department.

296
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:21,320
My father just happens
to work for them.

297
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,458
This is the kind of place
that would make his mouth drool.

298
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:28,967
lf you want anything,
it's on the house.

299
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:30,666
Thanks.

300
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:33,736
God damn. The earring prince
here thinks he...

301
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:36,709
-Adam! l do have some good news.
-And what's that?

302
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,139
l'm going to see an agent
about some work.

303
00:24:39,182 --> 00:24:41,321
Kelly, that's great!

304
00:24:41,358 --> 00:24:43,497
Maybe some of these years of
training will start to pay off.

305
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:47,753
Well, Kelly,
these pictures are very good.

306
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,968
You're very photogenic.

307
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:51,013
You want to get serious
about your dancing?

308
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:53,737
-Have you danced professionally?
-Well, once.

309
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:56,391
Did you ever see the ''Dancing
Doggie'' dog food commercial?

310
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,691
Let's just say you have
no professional experience.

311
00:24:59,726 --> 00:25:01,002
l think we should pursue...

312
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:03,656
the dance possibilities
here in town.

313
00:25:03,693 --> 00:25:05,994
Allow me to set up
a few auditions.

314
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:08,298
You can make the rounds,
get your feet wet.

315
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:10,634
-What do you think?
-Sounds great to me.

316
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:15,559
OK, so l'll set up a few
appointments this week.

317
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:17,003
We'll see you later, OK?

318
00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:54,148
Thank you, Miss Bennett.
You were excellent.

319
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,455
Unfortunately, the part
calls for a tall blonde.

320
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:06,655
Thank you. You were excellent.

321
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:08,191
Unfortunately,
we're looking for--

322
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,411
A short brunette.

323
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:12,708
This isn't worth it.

324
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:14,784
Blonde, brunette--
if they're looking for hair...

325
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,712
why don't they look at gorillas?

326
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:19,591
Don't let it get to you, Kelly.
There will be more auditions.

327
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:20,868
Not for this girl.

328
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:24,838
l just don't know if this is
what l really want to do.

329
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:26,181
You know what you need?

330
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:30,053
You need to live a little.
Relax.

331
00:26:31,368 --> 00:26:34,880
l need longer legs, shorter
legs, punk hair, no hair...

332
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,413
l just need a whole new life.

333
00:26:36,455 --> 00:26:39,390
Well, if you need a whole new
life, l know just the place.

334
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,602
-Where's that?
-The Radiotron.

335
00:26:41,638 --> 00:26:43,875
lt's a place where street
dancers go to show their stuff.

336
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,049
Turbo and Ozone are
meeting me there tonight.

337
00:26:46,086 --> 00:26:47,875
Ozone would love to see you.

338
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,470
After what happened
at Franco's class...

339
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:51,583
l'm the last person
he wants to see.

340
00:26:52,934 --> 00:26:54,363
Now, that's not true.

341
00:26:55,526 --> 00:26:58,755
-He asks about you all the time.
-Sure.

342
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:01,820
Hey! l could have used that.

343
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:03,836
Kelly, it was only
the first day.

344
00:27:03,877 --> 00:27:05,982
There's nothing to be
discouraged about.

345
00:27:06,021 --> 00:27:08,029
ln fact, there are plenty
of auditions coming up.

346
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:09,956
As a matter of fact, there's
something big developing...

347
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:11,450
in the dance community
right now...

348
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:13,184
and l'm trying to get the facts.

349
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,595
Sounds great.

350
00:27:14,628 --> 00:27:18,457
Kelly, are you OK? l mean,
you sound really down to me.

351
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,995
No, l'm all right.

352
00:27:20,036 --> 00:27:24,094
Well, are you eating? Let me
treat you to dinner tonight.

353
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:25,244
l already have plans.

354
00:27:25,284 --> 00:27:27,357
l promised some friends
l'd go watch them dance.

355
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,632
Well, if you need
anything at all...

356
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:31,391
you just give me a call, OK?

357
00:27:31,428 --> 00:27:32,802
l mean, that's what
l'm here for.

358
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:34,843
Thanks, James.
l really appreciate your help.

359
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:37,120
lt was my pleasure.
Have a good night, OK?

360
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,749
OK. Bye-bye.

361
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:52,113
Man!

362
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,281
You guys want us?

363
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:13,231
Then come and get us.

364
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,205
We wore them punks out!

365
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,846
We showed 'em.
We burned them dudes.

366
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:08,198
You're whacked, man. Fool!

367
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:10,347
What's the matter with you, man?

368
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:23,148
You know, there was something...

369
00:32:23,185 --> 00:32:26,000
about the Radiotron
that was really different.

370
00:32:26,033 --> 00:32:28,422
l mean, the people there
were real.

371
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,643
lt was alive, you know?

372
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,753
lt had an energy
that felt really good.

373
00:32:33,713 --> 00:32:35,403
l was really surprised.

374
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:37,612
See? l told you
that's what you needed.

375
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,655
You were right...just this time.

376
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,428
Man, shut that thing off.

377
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:50,602
-What?
-Turn it off.

378
00:32:55,152 --> 00:32:56,231
What's bugging you?

379
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:59,566
They beat us, man.
Don't you understand?

380
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:00,973
They just caught us off guard.

381
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:03,978
-So where am l going?
-Right over here.

382
00:33:05,774 --> 00:33:06,887
What's she doing here?

383
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,563
Hey, man, help me
clean up this mess.

384
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,895
What's the big deal?
lt's only a girl.

385
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,341
Just do it.

386
00:33:15,374 --> 00:33:16,584
Fine!

387
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:30,915
Hi!

388
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:36,969
We just thought we'd come by
to see how you guys were doing.

389
00:33:37,004 --> 00:33:39,393
That's cool. We're just
working on some new moves.

390
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,324
You guys were really
great last night.

391
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:44,778
They were just watching
the girl, not the dancing.

392
00:33:44,812 --> 00:33:46,373
lt was just a cheap shot.

393
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:48,997
l'd burn any girl that put
her face in front of me.

394
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:53,706
-She was good.
-l'm better.

395
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,871
Boy, do l have an idea!

396
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:58,598
We'll put together our own act.

397
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:01,635
What a team--the 3 of you,
and me as manager.

398
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:02,853
She ain't no street dancer.

399
00:34:02,891 --> 00:34:04,614
She knows nothin'
about what we do.

400
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,025
She can learn.

401
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,579
Yeah? How?

402
00:34:08,618 --> 00:34:10,505
You can teach me.

403
00:34:12,938 --> 00:34:14,694
We're asking for trouble.

404
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,384
Man, now l know
we're in trouble.

405
00:37:56,284 --> 00:37:58,520
Hey, let's go celebrate.
Lunch is on me.

406
00:37:58,556 --> 00:37:59,985
No, l'll treat.

407
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,784
No, l want to treat.

408
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,129
No, l'll treat, OK?

409
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:09,274
All right. There you go.

410
00:38:09,307 --> 00:38:10,452
Thank you.

411
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:14,546
l'd like to make a toast.
To the best.

412
00:38:14,587 --> 00:38:16,442
To our friendship.

413
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:21,009
Are you a dancer?

414
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:22,741
Yeah. l'm one of
those guys that--

415
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:25,528
Dancer, my ass.
You look more like freaks to me.

416
00:38:25,563 --> 00:38:28,345
Looks like their mama
never taught them how to dress.

417
00:38:28,378 --> 00:38:30,418
Hey, don't listen to him.
Come on.

418
00:38:32,953 --> 00:38:35,375
Yeah. Now, that's what
l call dancin' music.

419
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:37,360
Hey, why don't you come
over here and dance with us?

420
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:38,863
Yeah. Here's a quarter.

421
00:38:40,633 --> 00:38:41,615
Oh, yeah?

422
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:49,332
You laughin' at me?

423
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:53,424
-Shut up, you little runt.
-Yo, man! What's up?

424
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,180
Are you lookin' for a fight?

425
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:00,183
l'm right behind you.

426
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:04,598
What about the check?

427
00:39:08,183 --> 00:39:11,053
This is fun!
Let's go wreck another place.

428
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,110
Well, l can't say it was dull.

429
00:39:26,422 --> 00:39:27,983
Well, l'll walk you
to your door.

430
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:33,163
Who is this from?

431
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:36,883
Hold onto it a minute.

432
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,292
-How sweet of him!
-Him?

433
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:45,813
Your boyfriend?

434
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:48,267
No, my agent--James.

435
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:49,836
He can do a lot for us,
you know?

436
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:53,743
Well, l was thinking...
that maybe...

437
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,483
See you tomorrow, OK?

438
00:39:58,517 --> 00:39:59,662
Sure.

439
00:40:02,004 --> 00:40:04,077
-Good night.
-Good night, Kelly.

440
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:20,750
-Street dancing?!
-James, you don't understand.

441
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:22,674
Kelly, l'm aware of what it is.

442
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:24,048
lt's just that l'm working
on getting you...

443
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,504
into one of the biggest
dance competitions...

444
00:40:26,547 --> 00:40:28,369
which can lead
to incredible exposure...

445
00:40:28,402 --> 00:40:31,751
and you're telling me
you want to be a street dancer.

446
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:33,420
Would you just let me
explain to you--

447
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,214
Kelly, you're wasting your time.

448
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,527
You've got to think
about your future.

449
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:38,253
We're building a career.

450
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,192
You can't make a living
dancing in the street.

451
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:44,103
l never thought you would
be so narrow-minded.

452
00:40:44,146 --> 00:40:45,640
Kelly, l'm not.

453
00:40:45,681 --> 00:40:48,550
lt's just that
you've got to be serious.

454
00:40:48,594 --> 00:40:50,928
Street dancing belongs
on the street.

455
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,470
lt won't get you to Broadway.

456
00:40:54,513 --> 00:40:57,066
Well, we won't know that
until we give it a shot.

457
00:40:57,104 --> 00:40:58,697
Kelly, l hate
to tell you this...

458
00:40:58,737 --> 00:41:00,395
Why not?

459
00:41:00,432 --> 00:41:02,472
You know why everybody's afraid?

460
00:41:02,512 --> 00:41:04,967
lt's because
they don't understand it.

461
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:08,586
lt's not just kids dancing
on a street corner for a nickel.

462
00:41:08,624 --> 00:41:10,893
They put more heart
and soul into their work...

463
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:12,968
than any dancer l know.

464
00:41:14,256 --> 00:41:16,711
James, it's real. lt's fresh.

465
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:18,245
All l'm saying is--

466
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:20,556
James, just get us
into the contest...

467
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:22,446
and l guarantee you we'll win.

468
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:24,551
All right, now, let me
get this straight. Humor me.

469
00:41:25,647 --> 00:41:28,745
You want me to put
you and your...

470
00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:31,433
street-dancing friends
on the same stage...

471
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,569
as trained,
professional dancers?

472
00:41:34,606 --> 00:41:36,581
Well, come see
for yourself, then.

473
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:38,509
We're going against
Electro Rock tonight.

474
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:40,549
Electro...what?

475
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:44,038
Electro Rock.
We got a score to settle.

476
00:41:44,078 --> 00:41:46,664
This time,
we're gonna cut 'em bad.

477
00:41:46,702 --> 00:41:50,924
You're...really talking
like a street person.

478
00:41:50,957 --> 00:41:54,153
-You packing a blade?
-Yeah.

479
00:41:56,653 --> 00:41:58,409
OK. l'll go.

480
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:24,042
Where the hell is she?

481
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,050
Don't worry about it, man.
She'll be here.

482
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:28,293
Hey, punk.

483
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:30,949
Hey, are you back
for more, fool?

484
00:42:30,987 --> 00:42:32,841
Yeah, and wearing
rags like that...

485
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:34,435
l hope you'll be able
to back it up.

486
00:42:35,403 --> 00:42:36,777
Yeah, and you know it.

487
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,491
Kelly, l...

488
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,872
Maybe you're
a little overdressed.

489
00:42:40,906 --> 00:42:42,499
Don't worry about it. Come on.

490
00:42:58,857 --> 00:43:01,377
James, l'd like you
to meet my friends.

491
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:03,206
-This is Adam.
-Hello, Adam.

492
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:05,412
-Hi.
-And Turbo.

493
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,463
Turbo.

494
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,232
-And this is Ozone.
-Hi, Ozone.

495
00:43:16,232 --> 00:43:17,988
James came to watch us dance.

496
00:43:18,024 --> 00:43:19,998
l don't dance for
anybody but myself.

497
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,600
Oh, yeah, punk?

498
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,738
Yeah, l know
what you're thinkin'.

499
00:43:24,775 --> 00:43:26,149
You feel lucky?

500
00:43:26,184 --> 00:43:27,296
Now.

501
00:43:27,335 --> 00:43:28,994
Be cool, all right?

502
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:31,169
You bad? You want some of this?

503
00:43:33,766 --> 00:43:36,101
You know, you do what you want,
man, but don't touch me.

504
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:37,761
You must be feeling
lucky tonight.

505
00:43:41,478 --> 00:43:42,722
Now.

506
00:43:42,758 --> 00:43:45,311
Don't worry about it. Just go
over there and watch us dance.

507
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,626
Kelly...

508
00:43:52,294 --> 00:43:54,268
Go, girl! Go! Do it!

509
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:20,450
Why don't you go
keep James company?

510
00:44:20,484 --> 00:44:22,110
All right. Go work 'em, Kelly!

511
00:46:39,323 --> 00:46:40,436
Right on.

512
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,839
Oh, wow! What is this?

513
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,832
That's the girl from the beach.

514
00:47:15,768 --> 00:47:16,913
That's good.

515
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:00,779
Kelly!

516
00:48:00,822 --> 00:48:03,211
Man, you were great.

517
00:48:04,469 --> 00:48:05,898
l couldn't believe it.

518
00:48:05,941 --> 00:48:08,811
Unbelievable. You guys,
l want to tell you...

519
00:48:08,854 --> 00:48:10,763
Amazing. Just fantastic.

520
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:11,787
Turbo.

521
00:48:13,493 --> 00:48:16,363
Yeah, you got to teach me
that sometime.

522
00:48:16,405 --> 00:48:20,398
Ozone, the way you dance is...
it's incredible.

523
00:48:20,436 --> 00:48:21,483
Thanks, man.

524
00:48:22,645 --> 00:48:25,459
lt was great meeting you all.
All right? Thank you.

525
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:29,136
Kelly...you were...
you were right.

526
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:30,831
lt was just phenomenal.

527
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:33,289
-Well, l'm glad you liked it.
-l did.

528
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:38,187
Hey, listen, if you want
to spend time with them...

529
00:48:38,227 --> 00:48:39,918
then l totally understand.

530
00:48:41,779 --> 00:48:44,397
No, it's OK.
l just need to talk to them.

531
00:48:44,435 --> 00:48:45,679
All right.

532
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:47,122
Hey, let's go celebrate.

533
00:48:48,883 --> 00:48:52,014
Listen, l would really love to,
but l really got to go.

534
00:48:52,051 --> 00:48:55,499
-You're not gonna stay with us?
-Well, l came with James, so...

535
00:48:56,658 --> 00:48:59,407
We did really great tonight,
you guys! That was fun!

536
00:49:01,362 --> 00:49:02,442
See you tomorrow.

537
00:49:23,153 --> 00:49:25,422
-Yeah?
-lt's me.

538
00:49:25,456 --> 00:49:26,733
The door is open.

539
00:49:29,456 --> 00:49:31,049
How you doing?

540
00:49:31,088 --> 00:49:32,233
l'm all right.

541
00:49:32,273 --> 00:49:34,411
We sure tore the place up
last night, didn't we?

542
00:49:34,448 --> 00:49:35,593
We did OK.

543
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,542
James thinks we really
have something.

544
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:41,096
He says that we have one of
the hottest acts around.

545
00:49:41,135 --> 00:49:43,753
-Oh, did he, now?
-Yeah. That's why l dropped by.

546
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:45,450
He told me about
this big dance contest...

547
00:49:45,487 --> 00:49:47,560
and there's gonna be judges
from all over the country there.

548
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,875
lt's really big!

549
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:50,536
Are you kidding?
Those dudes don't want...

550
00:49:50,575 --> 00:49:52,876
to have nothin'
to do with our kind.

551
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:55,114
What do you mean? We're good.
That's all that counts.

552
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:57,671
Oh, yeah?
Well, you know what l think?

553
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,099
l think we'll be
wasting our time.

554
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:02,117
Those dudes don't want
to give us the chance.

555
00:50:02,158 --> 00:50:03,881
Actually, he's working
on it right now.

556
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,860
He's got some really
great connections...

557
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,757
and he can get us the chance.

558
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,889
He's really a nice guy,
and he's trying to help us out.

559
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:14,854
l've never needed anybody,
and l don't need them now.

560
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:18,505
lf those dudes want to see us
dance, have them come down here.

561
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:21,770
Or maybe they're afraid
of getting raped or mugged.

562
00:50:21,805 --> 00:50:23,430
l really don't understand you.

563
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:25,956
l mean, this could be
a really big break for us.

564
00:50:25,997 --> 00:50:27,240
Who knows what it could lead to?

565
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:28,521
l don't care!

566
00:50:31,212 --> 00:50:33,514
l have everything
l want right here.

567
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:35,588
But if that's what you want,
Kelly, then you do it.

568
00:50:35,629 --> 00:50:36,938
Nobody's stopping you.

569
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:39,748
Yeah, but...

570
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:45,223
Well, James has invited
everybody over.

571
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,405
He's gonna have
this little party...

572
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:48,167
and you guys are
supposed to be there.

573
00:50:55,307 --> 00:50:56,997
Well, here's his address.

574
00:50:57,035 --> 00:50:58,944
You guys are welcome
to come if you want to.

575
00:51:10,762 --> 00:51:12,169
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

576
00:51:16,169 --> 00:51:18,079
Hello, Max. Good to see you.

577
00:51:18,122 --> 00:51:20,707
Thanks for coming.
And then you brought...

578
00:51:20,746 --> 00:51:22,152
Susan, right?

579
00:51:22,185 --> 00:51:23,811
Nice to see you.

580
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:31,107
Will you excuse me?

581
00:51:31,145 --> 00:51:32,606
Hello. How are you?

582
00:51:32,649 --> 00:51:34,404
Kelly! You made it.

583
00:51:34,441 --> 00:51:36,263
-Hi, James.
-Hello.

584
00:51:36,296 --> 00:51:38,151
-You look fantastic.
-Thank you.

585
00:51:38,184 --> 00:51:39,842
This is really nice.

586
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,084
Where's Ozone and Turbo?
Are they coming?

587
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:44,676
They had some
other commitments...

588
00:51:44,712 --> 00:51:46,337
but they're going
to try and make it later.

589
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:49,724
Good. Good, because l've got so
many people l want you to meet.

590
00:51:49,767 --> 00:51:52,036
l've been talking you up
like crazy here.

591
00:51:52,072 --> 00:51:53,217
So come this way.

592
00:51:53,255 --> 00:51:54,782
-You got to meet these people.
-OK. Great.

593
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:57,343
-Sofie!
-James.

594
00:51:58,439 --> 00:52:01,406
Hi. This is the dancer
l was telling you about.

595
00:52:01,447 --> 00:52:03,934
Kelly Bennett,
this is Sofie Cunningham...

596
00:52:03,975 --> 00:52:06,211
a very gifted choreographer.

597
00:52:06,246 --> 00:52:08,450
-Happy to meet you, Kelly.
-Nice meeting you.

598
00:52:08,487 --> 00:52:11,039
Kelly is a client
and a very close friend.

599
00:52:20,773 --> 00:52:24,766
Look at these fancy cars.
You sure we're invited?

600
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:35,459
Oh, there they are.

601
00:52:37,764 --> 00:52:39,291
l'm really glad you came.

602
00:52:40,964 --> 00:52:43,582
You're here! Great.

603
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:47,133
Welcome. The place is yours.
Enjoy yourself.

604
00:52:47,172 --> 00:52:48,928
And there are some
very important people...

605
00:52:48,963 --> 00:52:50,589
l want you to meet.

606
00:52:50,628 --> 00:52:51,937
Come on. l'll take you there.

607
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:54,685
Come on.

608
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:11,066
-What's this?
-Fromage de tete du porc.

609
00:53:11,106 --> 00:53:14,488
-Who?
-Hog's head cheese.

610
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,701
Sick, man! Sick!

611
00:53:16,738 --> 00:53:18,713
Are you an entertainer?

612
00:53:18,754 --> 00:53:21,569
Ah, yes. l'm one of
those guys that...

613
00:53:24,385 --> 00:53:27,254
He's one of those young men
that spins around on his head.

614
00:53:30,145 --> 00:53:32,534
Would you like
some of this pig cheese?

615
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:34,137
No, thank you.

616
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:35,486
Excuse us, Sofie.

617
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:36,895
There's someone else
l want you to meet.

618
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:39,962
Could be our major
competition in the contest.

619
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,822
-Excuse us.
-See you later.

620
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,727
l'd like to see you dance
professionally sometime.

621
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,774
l'm sure.

622
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,309
-Steven, how are you?
-Fine.

623
00:53:52,352 --> 00:53:53,366
Good to see you.

624
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:55,412
Kelly.

625
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,289
You two know each other?

626
00:54:00,352 --> 00:54:01,529
We've met.

627
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:03,836
Yeah. She used to take my class.

628
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:07,162
Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.

629
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:10,614
Ozone, this is Franco. Ozone.

630
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:12,766
Now, wait.

631
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:15,002
-Did he take your class, too?
-No.

632
00:54:15,966 --> 00:54:17,656
l don't teach amateurs.

633
00:54:19,294 --> 00:54:24,215
Well, these amateurs
will be competing with you.

634
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:26,326
-On the same stage with me?
-That's right.

635
00:54:28,413 --> 00:54:30,420
James, l thought
you were a smart man.

636
00:54:30,462 --> 00:54:33,396
Now, don't jump to conclusions.
l've seen them dance.

637
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:36,471
Yeah, in the ghetto, maybe.
But in the real dance world...

638
00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:38,232
against a disciplined
art form...

639
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:40,057
they're going to make
fools of themselves.

640
00:54:40,093 --> 00:54:41,587
You callin' me a fool, man?

641
00:54:41,629 --> 00:54:44,050
Look around you.
lt's pretty obvious, isn't it?

642
00:54:45,309 --> 00:54:48,156
-Hey, come on.
-Get him off!

643
00:54:48,188 --> 00:54:50,011
l told you he belonged
on the streets!

644
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:00,722
What is the matter with you?

645
00:55:02,715 --> 00:55:03,697
Happy now?

646
00:55:05,531 --> 00:55:06,807
Come on, man. Let's go.

647
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:09,721
What do you mean, go?

648
00:55:09,755 --> 00:55:12,243
That lady and l were working
on a 3-picture deal.

649
00:55:12,283 --> 00:55:14,071
Come on, man!

650
00:55:14,107 --> 00:55:15,961
-Remember...
-Lunch!

651
00:55:15,994 --> 00:55:18,001
-Excuse me!
-Ozone, wait. Stop.

652
00:55:18,042 --> 00:55:20,464
Please don't go.
Franco--he's just sick.

653
00:55:20,506 --> 00:55:21,848
Well, l think you have
everything you want...

654
00:55:21,882 --> 00:55:22,962
right here, baby.

655
00:55:23,002 --> 00:55:24,017
Let's go.

656
00:55:24,985 --> 00:55:26,163
Ozone!

657
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:30,902
lt's all her fault.

658
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:34,711
Told you she'd be trouble.

659
00:55:40,121 --> 00:55:42,063
You had no right
to talk to him that way.

660
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:45,204
Just telling it like it is.
Face it, Kelly.

661
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,109
They're a different class
of people. They don't fit.

662
00:55:48,153 --> 00:55:50,454
You know, Franco,
you're a really poor excuse...

663
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:51,798
for a human being.

664
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:54,385
You say they're
in a different class?

665
00:55:54,424 --> 00:55:55,831
Well, you're right. They are.

666
00:55:55,864 --> 00:55:57,424
They're in a class
all by themselves.

667
00:55:57,464 --> 00:55:58,577
They're the best
at what they do...

668
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:00,721
and not you or anybody
is gonna take that away.

669
00:56:00,759 --> 00:56:04,469
You know it's really sad?
With me, you had a chance.

670
00:56:04,503 --> 00:56:06,837
But now l can see you ain't
gonna amount to nothin'.

671
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:09,522
And what makes you so special?

672
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:10,737
Well, unfortunately, Kelly...

673
00:56:10,775 --> 00:56:12,182
you missed your chance
to find that out.

674
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,151
Thank god.

675
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,982
Yeah. Well...

676
00:56:20,022 --> 00:56:21,299
l think you better leave.

677
00:56:23,222 --> 00:56:25,361
l didn't have any intentions
of hanging around.

678
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:34,443
All right. We're gonna lock.

679
00:56:34,486 --> 00:56:38,228
Now, when we lock,
roll our wrists...point. OK?

680
00:56:40,117 --> 00:56:41,065
Go.

681
00:56:45,045 --> 00:56:48,907
Now, we're gonna roll
our wrists, point, lock...

682
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:50,541
kick out, jump up...

683
00:57:00,148 --> 00:57:01,490
Baby Legs, come on.

684
00:57:04,819 --> 00:57:06,445
Do the wave. Let's see it.

685
00:57:10,643 --> 00:57:11,853
All right!

686
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:14,028
Break, hot tot.

687
00:57:22,035 --> 00:57:23,180
He's sharp.

688
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,481
Soda Pop.

689
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:30,475
Footwork.

690
00:57:32,401 --> 00:57:33,514
Let's see you spin.

691
00:57:35,601 --> 00:57:37,063
There it is.

692
00:57:39,537 --> 00:57:40,944
Come on, Ram.

693
00:57:42,321 --> 00:57:44,208
You guys are doing good--
real good.

694
00:57:44,241 --> 00:57:46,379
She has a fast spin.

695
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:48,776
Pose.

696
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:54,055
Hi, Turbo.

697
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,025
You better be careful.
They might beat you someday.

698
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,591
l hope they do.

699
00:58:00,624 --> 00:58:02,926
ls Ozone inside?

700
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,389
No.

701
00:58:04,431 --> 00:58:05,675
Do you know where he is?

702
00:58:06,896 --> 00:58:08,783
l haven't seen him
for a couple days.

703
00:58:08,816 --> 00:58:11,499
Well...you better not
let him catch you.

704
00:58:12,943 --> 00:58:14,056
where could he be?

705
00:58:16,047 --> 00:58:17,706
Venice, maybe. l don't know.

706
00:58:21,102 --> 00:58:23,273
-Kelly.
-Yeah, Turbo?

707
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:30,471
Can't you see what's going on?

708
00:58:53,644 --> 00:58:54,593
Hi.

709
00:58:56,365 --> 00:58:59,332
-What do you want?
-l want to talk to you.

710
00:59:00,748 --> 00:59:02,821
l don't think we have
anything to talk about.

711
00:59:05,612 --> 00:59:08,133
-What's wrong?
-l don't want to talk about it.

712
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,476
lf it's what happened at
James' party, Franco's a moron.

713
00:59:13,515 --> 00:59:15,370
l know how you feel.

714
00:59:15,404 --> 00:59:17,738
You don't know how l feel.

715
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:19,626
You don't know nothin' about me.

716
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:22,342
And your friends are
all phonies, man.

717
00:59:22,379 --> 00:59:23,721
They're just like you--

718
00:59:23,754 --> 00:59:26,504
up there in your tights,
being told what to do.

719
00:59:26,538 --> 00:59:28,927
We don't care if we don't
step on our right foot.

720
00:59:30,698 --> 00:59:32,160
We do what feels good.

721
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:35,232
And we don't do it
in the classrooms, either.

722
00:59:35,274 --> 00:59:36,768
We do it on the streets.

723
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,184
So you're just gonna
throw the whole contest...

724
00:59:38,218 --> 00:59:39,778
out the window, huh?

725
00:59:39,817 --> 00:59:42,054
You're not even gonna
give yourself a chance?

726
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,097
We don't need it like you do.

727
00:59:44,137 --> 00:59:46,177
They'll put us on the stage
and laugh at us...

728
00:59:46,217 --> 00:59:48,072
because we don't
fit into your world...

729
00:59:48,105 --> 00:59:50,974
because we don't have
the right credentials.

730
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:53,439
You know what your problem is?

731
00:59:53,481 --> 00:59:55,553
Your problem is you.

732
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,934
You're a quitter!

733
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:59,008
You think you know it all,
Miss Perfect.

734
01:00:00,104 --> 01:00:03,039
Well, you don't know
how l feel...

735
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,542
or why l do what l do.

736
01:00:04,584 --> 01:00:07,137
Would you just stop
holding back?

737
01:00:07,176 --> 01:00:09,063
l mean, you're always
putting up fronts.

738
01:00:09,096 --> 01:00:10,721
''Nothing bothers Ozone.

739
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,450
''Everybody always
looks up to Ozone.

740
01:00:12,488 --> 01:00:13,732
He knows everything.''

741
01:00:13,768 --> 01:00:16,419
God forbid he has
no doubts or fears.

742
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,244
What are you afraid of?

743
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:25,117
Well, maybe l don't know
everything...

744
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:26,882
like your boyfriend James.

745
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:28,991
Would you get off it?
James is not my boyfriend.

746
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,332
He's my agent, and he's
just trying to help us.

747
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:33,373
James is just a friend.

748
01:00:33,415 --> 01:00:34,941
l mean, he really
believes in us.

749
01:00:34,983 --> 01:00:37,252
That's why he got us
the studio to rehearse in.

750
01:00:38,918 --> 01:00:40,380
Come on. l want
to show you something.

751
01:00:42,886 --> 01:00:45,057
l want you to see what
real dancing's all about.

752
01:01:50,529 --> 01:01:51,511
Look at him.

753
01:02:00,928 --> 01:02:02,489
You see his face?

754
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:05,910
That's dancing, Kelly.

755
01:02:34,207 --> 01:02:36,029
Well, this is it.

756
01:02:36,062 --> 01:02:37,557
What do you think?

757
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:38,581
lt's wonderful.

758
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,563
Thanks.

759
01:02:41,662 --> 01:02:44,596
God, it's so nice to be
in a real studio again.

760
01:02:44,638 --> 01:02:46,099
l'm really glad you like it.

761
01:02:46,142 --> 01:02:47,703
You know l'd do
anything for you.

762
01:02:49,118 --> 01:02:50,711
For us, you mean.

763
01:02:50,749 --> 01:02:53,783
Well, yes, of course.
For everybody.

764
01:02:53,822 --> 01:02:55,131
Am l missing something?

765
01:02:56,157 --> 01:02:58,612
Yes. Music. Let's get to work.

766
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:02,291
You guys can't let me down now.

767
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:04,569
l'm going to call all
my friends in the business...

768
01:03:04,605 --> 01:03:06,131
and get you in that audition.

769
01:03:07,901 --> 01:03:09,559
And you better be good.

770
01:05:56,498 --> 01:06:02,161
Believe me, Kelly, l've called
every S.O.B. in the business...

771
01:06:02,193 --> 01:06:03,819
and it's always the same answer.

772
01:06:03,857 --> 01:06:05,679
''Forget it, James.''

773
01:06:05,713 --> 01:06:09,128
This audition is for the biggest
dance production in years...

774
01:06:09,169 --> 01:06:11,536
and there's no way
they'll even consider you guys.

775
01:06:11,569 --> 01:06:14,351
lt just seems that Franco has
a lot more pull than l thought.

776
01:06:14,385 --> 01:06:17,516
But we can't give up now. We
can't let Franco off that easy.

777
01:06:17,552 --> 01:06:19,756
l don't know what else l can do.

778
01:06:19,793 --> 01:06:21,800
Ozone and Turbo will go nuts
if they find out.

779
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,498
We can't tell them about this.

780
01:06:23,536 --> 01:06:25,359
Kelly, we have to be
reasonable about this.

781
01:06:25,392 --> 01:06:26,952
l don't want to be reasonable.

782
01:06:26,992 --> 01:06:28,169
l've been reasonable
all my life...

783
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:30,030
and it's gotten me nowhere.

784
01:06:30,064 --> 01:06:31,820
l am finally happy
and l have some real friends.

785
01:06:31,856 --> 01:06:33,644
l'm not going to let them down.

786
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,978
Those phony, narrow-minded
stuffed shirts...

787
01:06:40,016 --> 01:06:42,285
won't consider it dance
because it's not traditional.

788
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:43,846
What do they want?

789
01:06:43,887 --> 01:06:45,796
l'll tell you what
they don't want.

790
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:49,384
They don't want kids
in T-shirts that are torn...

791
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:52,968
and bandanas
and spiked bracelets.

792
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:55,436
Unless...

793
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:58,757
What?

794
01:07:00,718 --> 01:07:04,013
No. Ozone will never go for it.
He's got too much pride.

795
01:07:04,046 --> 01:07:05,988
Kelly, it's the only way
it will work.

796
01:07:26,892 --> 01:07:30,340
Yes, this is my group--
the Allegro Vivace Dance Trio.

797
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,689
Good luck.

798
01:07:31,724 --> 01:07:33,862
Gracie. Avanti.

799
01:07:46,891 --> 01:07:48,298
All right. This is it.

800
01:07:49,386 --> 01:07:50,815
We're on after the next group.

801
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:53,316
You guys ready?

802
01:07:54,475 --> 01:07:55,969
As ready as we're
ever going to be.

803
01:08:13,065 --> 01:08:14,342
Well done.

804
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:28,517
What the hell
are you doing here?

805
01:08:28,552 --> 01:08:32,065
You surprised to see the fools?
We're here.

806
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:58,620
-We seem to have a problem here.
-l'll take care of it.

807
01:09:02,214 --> 01:09:05,923
l'm the manager of this group.
What seems to be the problem?

808
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:08,860
l'm very much afraid they won't
be able to dance for us.

809
01:09:08,902 --> 01:09:10,178
And why not?

810
01:09:10,214 --> 01:09:11,807
Because l don't
think they'll fit in...

811
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:13,601
to our particular production.

812
01:09:13,638 --> 01:09:16,093
What? How can you say that?

813
01:09:16,134 --> 01:09:18,173
You haven't even
seen them perform.

814
01:09:18,213 --> 01:09:20,122
Look, l'm sorry,
but we're looking...

815
01:09:20,165 --> 01:09:22,238
for some very good
jazz dancers...

816
01:09:22,277 --> 01:09:23,771
and it's been made
very clear to me...

817
01:09:23,813 --> 01:09:26,977
that those people don't fit in
to that particular category.

818
01:09:27,012 --> 01:09:29,663
Look, they're here.
Just let them dance.

819
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,897
Look, l'm sorry. l'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

820
01:09:36,196 --> 01:09:38,617
Well, it's your loss.

821
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,914
l don't know what to do
with these people.

822
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:49,881
l'm sorry. lt's not going to
work out. This is Franco's show.

823
01:09:49,923 --> 01:09:51,745
They're not going
to stop us now.

824
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:52,826
Who's next?

825
01:09:52,867 --> 01:09:54,110
Ozone.

826
01:09:56,131 --> 01:09:57,473
Street dancer!

827
01:10:13,474 --> 01:10:15,514
Look, l'm not going
to stand for this!

828
01:10:15,553 --> 01:10:17,692
You must stop immediately!

829
01:10:21,281 --> 01:10:22,710
Now, listen here, young man.

830
01:10:22,753 --> 01:10:25,819
Did you hear me?
You must leave now!

831
01:10:27,776 --> 01:10:29,980
Look, l'm not going to stand
for this. You must stop.

832
01:10:32,224 --> 01:10:33,686
Stop right this minute!

833
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:37,525
We are auditioning
jazz dancers only.

834
01:10:37,568 --> 01:10:40,700
Stop this nonsense! Jim!

835
01:10:41,664 --> 01:10:44,347
Oh...God. There's more of them.

836
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,351
Jim!

837
01:10:48,863 --> 01:10:51,994
Jim, get them out of here
this instant.

838
01:10:52,031 --> 01:10:53,078
Wait.

839
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:18,298
Maybe...

840
01:11:31,805 --> 01:11:34,521
-All right, stop this nonsense.
-Go away.

841
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:37,018
Look, l'll pull my dancers out
if this doesn't stop...

842
01:11:37,052 --> 01:11:37,979
and l mean it.

843
01:11:38,012 --> 01:11:40,500
Let's talk about it later.
l can't see.

844
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,705
All right.
All right, that's it.

845
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,365
We had a deal, Mary. Remember?
