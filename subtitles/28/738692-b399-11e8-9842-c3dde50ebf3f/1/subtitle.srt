00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,090
Who is going to wash my Iegs today?

00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,499

00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:28,760

00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:33,132

Have some ice-cream

34
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:13,856
Green coIor matches your cIothes

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,830
What is this?

36
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:15,833
ChocoIate

37
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,395
Green coIor shouId match
with yeIIow coIor!

38
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,200
How can you match with bIack coIor?
Sorry

39
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,353
See! The bIack girI
wears stripe underwear!

40
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:13,323
Yeah!

41
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:19,557
Wong Siu Fu?

42
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,462
Yes, I can teII from his ass

43
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:24,370
Stop him

44
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,046
Where can you go?

45
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:40,915
Brother Sing, I am here waiting for you

46
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:42,154
Sorry

47
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:43,346
for burning aII your hair Iast time

48
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:46,084
That made you tattoo your
eyebrow & wear wigs. I regret so much!

49
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,888
Never mind, since my famiIy
is working for your dad!

50
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:49,552
And I am good Iooking now!

51
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:52,788
You are reaIIy good Iooking!

52
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,264
I can't stand you!

53
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,130
Come on, have some chocoIate

54
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,369
Brother Sing, I don't need it

55
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:00,334
This is cathartics, I tried that before

56
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,268
When did you become so smart?

57
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:03,999
I can't heIp, Iet's go

58
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:05,441
Young master, are you Ietting him go?

59
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:06,877
I can't heIp! See, how smart he is now!

60
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:08,105
I can't fooI him any more

61
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,118
I Iost two hundred doIIars

62
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,120
Isn't it stoIen?

63
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,419
CaII the poIice now!

64
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:19,822
I have recorded the numbers

65
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,192
You are smart!

66
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:24,957
How is the taste of the note?

67
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:26,390
It's made of cathartics too

68
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,433
It meIts in mouth and wiII be
effective in 5 seconds!

69
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:40,307
You are trapped!

70
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:41,641
HoId it...

71
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:42,839
Not untiI he is shitting!

72
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:45,543
Go!

73
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:54,757
Jump! Jump!

74
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,792
Do you know it's dangerous to do so?

75
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:33,329
Who are you? Who is your boss?

76
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:35,196
My uncIe is Professor Chang Sze
of this coIIege

77
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:36,266
I am studying here

78
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:38,665
I have toId them not to Iet
ugIy women study here!

79
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:39,363
That's right

80
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:40,962
You know, I bribed them so as
to enter this coIIege

81
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:42,802
You are too ugIy
even bribery won't heIp! Go

82
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:44,173
Go Go now!

83
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,777
Go Bastard!

84
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:46,571
But I am smart!

85
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:47,907
You are not smart at aII

86
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:48,843
What?

87
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,142
You are not smart at aII

88
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:53,051
What did you say?
How can you teII such Iies?

89
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,177
Can you face your conscience?

90
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,710
Forget it...
How can you face your parents?

91
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,347
Don't argue
How can you face your country?

92
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,755
You'd better caII
a press conference to apoIogise

93
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,625
Or, I wiII kiII you! You know?

94
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:06,830
Human bodies are the most
fantastic things in the worId

95
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:11,530
In my cIass, you are studying the most
advance subject about it

96
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:16,005
That is the imitating function &
adaptabiIity of human bodies

97
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:22,010
It's Iike some Iizards, it imitates
the coIor of the surroundings

98
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:24,846
And human beings have the same function

99
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:26,351
Young master, after you

100
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:28,948
What are you staring? Go on teaching!

101
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:30,750
Get out

102
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:40,590
Now, I am giving you an exampIe

103
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,428
Say, a coupIe

104
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:44,633
When they have stayed for a Iong time

105
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:47,535
Their appearances wiII be aIike

106
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:50,108
They said, it's the coupIe Iook

107
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,169
In fact, this is the effect of human
genes which imitate each other

108
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:58,349
What do you want to ask?

109
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:01,319
I aIways stay with women, how come I
haven't become women?

110
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:06,550
Human bodies are weak

111
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:07,921
I beIieve that

112
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:12,327
one day, our organs wiII be repIaced
by artificiaI organs

113
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:14,764
What onIy Ieft wiII be our brains

114
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:18,495
Our organs wiII be
controIIed by computers

115
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:22,097
We wiII have strong imitating power
to imitate anyone

116
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,698
Or anything

117
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:25,501
Can we change to be a cigar?

118
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:27,203
According to theory, yes

119
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:30,407
You seem to be interested in this topic

120
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,917
In fact, I am interested in you

121
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:34,986
An ugIy girI toId me that
you are her uncIe

122
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:38,180
So I come here to see how cocky you are!

123
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:40,019
Now, I'm going to start the dissection

124
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,424
If you can stand it for three minutes

125
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:44,757
we wiII go ahead to
discuss other questions

126
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,297
OK, I am now going to dissect the body

127
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:06,646
What's he doing?

128
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,583
He's reaIIy crazy!

129
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:45,013
You're reaIIy great!

130
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:50,561
You are the onIy one who can toIerate
such Iong time in my cIass

131
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,754
Damn it!

132
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:53,866
I won't give it a damn

133
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:56,458
If onIy you open your eyes

134
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:58,092
I wouId admit that you are reaIIy boId!

135
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:09,413
It's a shame to be scared Iike this!

136
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:13,242
I'm scared to piss! May I be excused?

137
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:26,822
Are you scared?

138
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,763
Who do you think you are?
If you have guts, finish the food

139
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:40,844
My dad is the director of this coIIege
I'II ask him to fire your uncIe

140
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,471
And kick you out of the schooI

141
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:43,106
And seII you to be bar girI to
perform strip dance

142
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,280
When you are dancing

143
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:45,716
I'II ask the bar manager
to fire you again

144
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,513
No one can fire me

145
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,119
I am a senior scientific consuItant
empIoyed by the US Gov't

146
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:53,782
I am a guest professor here

147
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:57,521
WeII, since I can't fire you
I wiII steam you!

148
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,003
I can't imagine you are the most
disgusting guy in this coIIege

149
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:07,936
I am aII eyes!

150
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,506
What do you mean? My father is the
director of this coIIege

151
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,078
If your father wasn't the director

152
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:15,043
you wouId have been beaten to death

153
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:17,515
Shut up!

154
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:20,777
If you have guts, teII others that your
father isn't the director

155
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:22,511
We'II wait and see the resuIt

156
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:23,449
I won't give it a damn!

157
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,147
My father isn't the director

158
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,089
so what?

159
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:45,168
That bastard! He made me be
beaten Iike shit!

160
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:46,609
I'II take revenge tonight

161
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:47,613
Yeah...

162
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:48,236
Left...

163
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:48,870
Right...

164
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:49,709
No

165
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,642
Be carefuI

166
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:52,911
You hurt me!

167
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:54,987
Sorry, are you aIright, young master?

168
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:56,350
ShouId I give you some medicine?

169
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:57,287
Get Iost!

170
00:12:58,224 --> 00:12:59,851
Go upstairs and take a Iook

171
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:02,622
Young master, the Iaboratory
shouIdn't be upstairs

172
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,357
It shouId be buiIt in the basement

173
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:07,155
Here is Iike a Iab

174
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,260
Here it is, young master

175
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:14,967
What a big basement!
We'II have a Iot of fun here!

176
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:18,569
PIace one here

177
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:29,045
If anyone steps on this animaI trap

178
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:30,880
he wouId either die or become handicap

179
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,192
Where are you going?

180
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:35,055

196
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:29,709
Young master...

197
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:31,416
I've just seen a pair of eyes

198
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:34,975
Just a pair of eyes
which are staring at me

199
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:36,611
Staring at you? Yes

200
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:38,280
What do you want me to do?

201
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:40,952
I just want to ask you
the same question?

202
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:43,189
If I were you

203
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:44,887
I wouId stab into it

204
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:47,158
Do you want me to show you how?
Stare at me, come on

205
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:48,564
No, thanks

206
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:51,031
Shit! What's this?

207
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:51,829
What's up?

208
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,701
What is he staring at?
Isn't it what you have just seen?

209
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:56,897

00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,004

225
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,578

Wait for me...

228
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:54,627
HeIp...

229
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:06,769
Come on. Check it

230
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:10,276
Don't beIieve them! They're crazy
they're reaIIy crazy!

231
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:13,511
OK, OK! Don't worry, we'II handIe it
caIm down

232
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:24,586
Mr. Lee, we have found for haIf an hour

233
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:26,688
But we can't find the waIking hand
which you have mentioned

234
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:27,821
And the eyes too

235
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,195
Not even a ghost

236
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:29,960
Shit!

237
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:32,636
My feIIow's ass was
aImost stabbed by that hand

238
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:35,166
It did stab into my ass, two inches!
Two inches deep in my ass

239
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:36,697
4 inches aItogether 4 inches!

240
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,505
This student of mine is having
great imagination

241
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,636
Just Iet him pIay

242
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:44,773
Professor, I suspect that
you are a crazy maniac

243
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,851
I beIieve that you kiIIed
many innocent peopIe

244
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:51,914
And you chopped off their hands for
crueI scientific experiment

245
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:57,121
You are so wise!

246
00:16:57,763 --> 00:17:00,095
But you can't prove anything

247
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:03,227
You'd better find
the hands and Iegs first

248
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:14,176
What are you doing here?

249
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:15,770
The hand is a sex maniac

250
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:16,509
I think it must be a maIe's hand

251
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,040
So, I pretend to be a
femaIe hand to seduce it

252
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,843
Send two persons there to have a Iook

253
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:22,319
I'II take two up there and check it out

254
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:23,652
Tat, get the finger prints Yes sir

255
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:25,657
I am the in-charge here, behave yourseIf

256
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:27,022
Young master...

00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:29,593
My father is...

258
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,322
Young master...

259
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,099
Bye bye

260
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:39,833
If you are free
come to my cIass tomorrow

261
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:14,337
Young master, why did you hit me?

262
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:16,270
Why did you forget the secret code?

263
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:17,398
There isn't anyone outside

264
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,239
That professor must be a crazy kiIIer

265
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:22,176
I discIosed his secret
he wiII come to kiII me, you know?

266
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:25,079
Ortherwise, why shouId I ask you to find
someone to protect me?

267
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,383
And, I asked you to empIoy bodyguards

268
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,081
Not modeI! Yeah

269
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:31,246
They just put their hands on their waists
how can they protect me?

270
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,190
They are just modeIs What?

271
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:36,993
Time's up, Ieave now Yes sir

272
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,292
What do you mean? They are bIind

273
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:45,696
Since no one is wiIIing
to work for you in Hawaii

274
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:48,170
So, I have to empIoy some
bIind men to be modeIs...

275
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:48,740
So...

276
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,565
When I count to 3, I'II kick you out
if I stiII see you

277
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:51,643
Three!

278
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:54,377
Why didn't you count one two?

279
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:55,377
Master

280
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:57,081
I want to give him a big surprise

281
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:02,411
Dad?

282
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:03,615
My son!

283
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:06,091
Hi mom

284
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:07,214

Are you aIright?

287
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:13,860
I am fine, a master taught me
great Kung-fu

288
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:14,955
So, when you hit me

289

290
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:18,102
Now, I haven't any sore throat

00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:19,034
Everything is aIright

292
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:20,433
But, I think I am a bit crazy now

293
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:21,062
It's true

294
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:21,764
Yeah

295
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:23,204

00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,140
See, I think I am a bit crazy

297
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:26,677
What's wrong with you?

298
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:28,872

00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:35,480
The enemies are coming, get ready

302
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,116
I'II open the door to shift
the enemy's attention

303
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,317
You, go to his back and beat him

304
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:52,967
Hi

00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:01,277
Who is he?

309
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:02,937
I don't know, maybe a thief

310
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:04,406
What do you want?

311
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:06,277

Kidding?

315
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:14,049

And, there is a cIeaning brush
under the water

319
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:22,793
Not bad

320
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:26,036
By the way, you are so fast to
take off your cIothes!

321
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:27,830
UsuaIIy I use Iesser time to
take off other's cIothes

322
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:28,940
I don't beIieve it

323
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,368
Isn't it caIIed diving?

324
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:31,735
Watch!

325
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,147

Be carefuI of the bark dogs!

329
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:48,321
Your dad fainted

330
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:50,820
He wiII wake up if I
give him more strikes

331
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,227
Go and take a Iook

332
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:54,598
Let me heIp you to wash your back

333
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,564
It seems to be something

Yeah, I am washing toiIet now

335
00:20:57,937 --> 00:20:59,598
You are so bad

00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,739
You don't remember your dad's name now!

337
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,875
By the way, I have forgotten

338
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:06,943
Madam, you Iook famiIiar to me

00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:07,807

340
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,073
I wish I had given birth
to a bun instead of you

341
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:11,940
Having me was the side effect onIy

342
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:13,745
You were enjoying
the process of making me

343
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:16,249
You're right

344
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:20,415
You've aImost finished your bath

345
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:21,890
What's next?

346
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:23,689
I haven't got any idea

347
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:26,164
But if someone heIps me to wash my toes

348
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:27,765
maybe, I wiII have some ideas

349
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,235
What's this?

What are you doing?

354
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:50,149
Do you want to vomit it?

355
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:51,483
I want to see what brand it is

356
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:53,216

00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:17,716
This isn't your first time!

410
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:18,754
I didn't know how to do it

411
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:20,324

So caused heart weakness

419
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:44,381
To prevent expansion

420
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:47,041
You have to do him some injections
to stimuIate his heart

421
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:48,880
So as to save him

422
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:50,782
Kidding?

423
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:52,356

00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:53,321
Have you got the needIe?

425
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:54,217

426
00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:55,553
Forget anything, but stab in

427
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:14,174

00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,169
But the woman fainted

430
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:17,938
Where was the needIe?

431
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:20,548
It's stabbed into the Ieft hand side
under my beIIy

432
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,414
9 out of 10 men's dicks are

433
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:23,179

434
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:25,422

00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:30,588
WeII, bye bye

439
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:35,957
Forgive me, it's not done by me

440
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,829
You bastard!

441
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:44,237
I gave you so much money!

442
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,376
I just wanted you to amend something
in government's computer

443
00:27:47,646 --> 00:27:48,738
How dare you betray me?

444
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,542
Boss, don't kiII me! Don't kiII me...

445
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:53,514

00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:06,557
Don't kiII me...

450
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:08,993
So, shouId I Iisten to you?

451
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:10,760
If yes, how can I be the boss?

452
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:14,529
Give me one more chance...

453
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,403

454
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:20,906
So as to Iet you die with no regrets

455

00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,349
catch them and throw them to the sea

457
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:27,647
To feed the fish

458
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:32,714
Get him

459
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:44,665

00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:51,539
What does that mean?

462
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:00,346
What are you doing?

463
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:02,785
You said a waIking hand was found in
Professor Chang's home

464
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:03,946
Now, you said someone is
going to kiII you

465
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:06,156
Get out

466
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,635

474
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:40,555
Your dad, Lee Yat-fai

00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:42,352
I know. Tat is my dad

476
00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:44,362
How do you know it?

477
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:46,195
I hit dad and he went crazy
but I didn't hit you!

478
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:48,665
What made you to be crazy then?

479
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,989
Crazy?

480
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:55,839
Don't you think I am reaIIy crazy?

481
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:58,499
You bitch! You discIosed your secret!

482
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:00,542
That's why I know you aren't my son

483
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:05,574
I've suspected that for ages

484
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:10,347
My nick-name is Handsome VaIentino!

485
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:11,852
But...

486
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:14,150
my son Iooks Iike shit!

487
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:16,183
I know nothing!

488
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:17,022
Anyway, I want 2 miIIion

489
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:18,825
Who gives me 2 miIIion
I wiII take him as dad

490
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:20,021
I have two hundred doIIars

491
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:21,029
Two miIIion

492
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:23,599
PIease go back to wash toiIet

493
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:25,561
25 years ago

494
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:28,535
one night, I was reading sex noveIs
in the store room

495
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,138
Your mom rushed in, she wore nothing
but turned off the Iight

496
00:30:31,243 --> 00:30:32,210
Mind your tongue

497
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:34,672
I did wear something, I mean the socks

498
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:36,177
Sorry

499
00:30:36,414 --> 00:30:37,972
You wore a pair of white socks

500
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:40,741
OId master went out on that night

501
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:43,449
I couIdn't controI myseIf and I...

502
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:46,151
When I turned on the Iight
I regretted so much!

503
00:30:49,694 --> 00:30:51,719
So, why did you read the sex noveI?

504
00:30:51,863 --> 00:30:53,660
Shut up, stop saying anything!

505
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:55,088
Stop!

506
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,393
If a son hits his dad
he wiII be hit by thunder

507
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,163
Who said he is my dad?
Why shouId I beIieve it?

508
00:30:59,337 --> 00:30:59,962
Do you have any proof?

509
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,802
It's shown in the movie that
if a dad kneeIs in front of his son

510
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,139
his son wiII feeI dizzy

511
00:31:05,243 --> 00:31:07,074
ReaIIy? So, just try, see whether I wiII
feeI dizzy or not

512
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:10,812
KneeI down

513
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:21,583
See? FeeIing dizzy now!?

514
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:25,920
I am fine! Don't you beIieve it?

515
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:27,324
Stop messing up

516
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:28,593

517
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:31,565
Here is a cheque of 2 miIIion

518
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:33,061
If you take me as your dad

519
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:35,297
I wiII forget everything and you wiII
have further benefits

520
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,637
Otherwise...

521
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:37,706
You can teII the resuIt

522
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:42,173
No... Don't take the cheque...

523
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:43,576
Thank you dad

524
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:48,351
You are my good son

525
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:50,978
The wise guys shouId know
how the wind bIows

526
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:53,022
This is not fiIiaI!

527
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,223
No

528
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:55,657
Get out

529
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:57,750
I don't mind you not
admitting me as your dad

530
00:31:58,163 --> 00:31:59,152
Get Iost!

531
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:02,530
I aIways spoiI you, in fact
it's a harm to you

532
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,134
Mind your tongue, or I wiII caII
the poIice to arrest you

533
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:04,928
Be honest

534
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,163
You are a very disgusting person

535
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:08,169
Stop!

536
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,638
I hope you wouId know how to
respect peopIe from now on

537
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:11,799
So, others wiII respect you

538
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:14,938
Get Iost, bastard!

539
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,072
You are bastard

540
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:17,806
I am your dad, so I can scoId you

541
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,308
How dare you?

542
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:49,807
HeIIo

543
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:52,476
Are you confessing?

544
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:58,647
Don't you scare?

545
00:32:58,823 --> 00:32:59,812
I won't give it a damn

546
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,585
See my teeth?

547
00:33:04,562 --> 00:33:06,029
Aren't you happy?

548
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:07,994
How can I get happy after seeing you?

549
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:09,062
I'd better Ieave

550
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,258
PIease, hurry up

551
00:33:11,303 --> 00:33:12,327
HeIIo

552
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:14,234
Come here

553
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,573
I have a friend

554
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:23,777
For money, he just ignored his own dad

555
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:24,574
Then?

556
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:25,774
That's it

557
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:26,374
I am Ieaving

558
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:27,609
Wait...

559
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,120
He kicked his dad out of his home

560
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:33,348
And gave him a heavy kick

561
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:36,183
At that moment, it was pouring &
with thunderstorm

562
00:33:36,361 --> 00:33:37,692
What do you feeI about this guy?

563
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,695
Worse than animaI

564
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:40,990
But he is reaIIy handsome

565
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,224
That's better

566
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:44,962
Otherwise, he shouId be shot to death

567
00:33:45,337 --> 00:33:46,304
I just want to ask one more question

568
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:48,565
Don't you think I am smart?

569
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,938
I, Chung Chung, swear here

570
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:55,172
You are not handsome at aII

571
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:21,533
He is aIone tonight

572
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:22,937
Damn!

573
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:27,075
Move it

574
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:33,876
They are here

575
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:38,451
Do you want to caII 91 1 for the poIice?

576
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:39,350
May I?

577
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:40,888
Up to you

578
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:44,353
What is the number?

579
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:01,238
Sorry!

580
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:21,962
Who turned off the Iight?

581
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:25,428
Don't go!

582
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,059
Why are you standing here?

583
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,035
I didn't know he wouId bump against me

584
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,498
Go and get him

585
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:31,935
This house is too big

586
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:32,940
I think I'II bIow it up

587
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:39,147
Watch me

588
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:41,612
And!

589
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:44,378
Yeah Yeah

590
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:46,122
Why are you back?

591
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:47,291
I haven't Ieft

592
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:19,321
Don't move

593
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:22,154
Take the gun here

594
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:28,226
Don't do anything mad
Give it to me sIowIy. Hurry up!

595
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:31,194
Don't puII off a stunt, I teII you

596
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:33,761
Don't you think I can't see your cunning
eyes behind the gIasses?

597
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:34,963
Don't do anything stupid

598
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:38,535
Give me your gun

599
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,538
You've got it

600
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:41,976
OK!

601
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:45,914
Don't move!

602
00:36:46,217 --> 00:36:47,775
Don't mess up, I have got your friend

603
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:50,551
This is what I want to teII you
Your boss is with me

604
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:54,257
WeII, Iet's change our hostages

605
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:56,256
Damn you! Let my friend go

606
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:59,090
Or, I wiII shoot him to death

607
00:36:59,898 --> 00:37:01,126
OK...

608
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:06,403
Why do you kneeI down?

609
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:12,368
He is my son, he can't stand it!

610
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:13,636
He feeIs dizzy for I kneeI
down in front of him!

611
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:15,373
HeIIo, goodbye

612
00:37:31,663 --> 00:37:34,632
That stupid guy doesn't know
how to use gun, but bomb onIy

613
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:35,857
He has made a big mistake this time

614
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,327
Watch!

615
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:39,995
He Ieft a knife

616
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,433
Do you remember we have a spring toiIet?

617
00:37:41,472 --> 00:37:42,666
The one which is used
to fooI Wong Siu-fu?

618
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:43,774
It's just next to you

619
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:44,874
Oh!

620
00:37:51,382 --> 00:37:53,179
How many peopIe can it serve each time?

621
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:53,945
One

622
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:01,258
Don't worry
we stiII have coupIe of hours

623
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:05,020
Wear your gIasses!

624
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:06,323
Just 10 seconds are Ieft

625
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:08,489
You can't cut the chain by the knife

626
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,265
Chop off my hand and Ieave
as soon as possibIe!

627
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:12,002
You needn't teach me that

628
00:38:18,876 --> 00:38:20,605
I haven't treated you nice in my Iife

629
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:22,804
Now, I wiII pay everything back to you

630
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:24,774
Dad

631
00:38:27,452 --> 00:38:28,316
My dear son

632
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:29,647
Sit down!

633
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:55,838
Chung Chung, are you aIright?

634
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:57,639
I am fine

635
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,185
Have you had a nightmare?

636
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:12,888
Yes
I saw Sing being bIown up in my dream

637
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:14,629
What a horribIe dream!

638
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:18,863
Aren't you hating him?

639
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:21,601
Why did you think of him in your dream?

640
00:39:21,873 --> 00:39:24,205
In fact, I hate him

641
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:28,508
I know, I remember a psychiatrist said

642
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:32,477
those bad guys have
speciaI attraction to women

643
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:36,617
In fact, he isn't that bad

644
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:39,779
He went to the church for confession

645
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:43,758
He just Ioves face
he doesn't want me to tease him

646
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:47,228
He is so poor, for he hasn't any friends

647
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:50,893
He is a smart guy

648
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:55,335
Otherwise, he can't think of so many
tricks to fooI others

649
00:39:58,076 --> 00:39:59,043
Yes

650
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:00,801
Doctor Chang pIease Speaking

651
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:03,880
A patient caIIed Lee Chak-sing
is bIown to death

652
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:04,913
Come to the hospitaI now

653
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:06,314
What's up?

654
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:10,282
What you saw isn't a dream

655
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:11,850
It's reaI

656
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,211
Professor...

657
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:37,176
How is my son?

658
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:38,282
Stay caIm

659
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:40,447
From the medicaI point of view

660
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:42,553
your son is dead

661
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:43,581
What?

662
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:46,350
But to me...

663
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,049
He is haIfIy dead

664
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:49,090
What do you mean?

665
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:55,728
Dad, are you here?

666
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:58,795
Why onIy his Iips are Ieft?

667
00:40:58,936 --> 00:40:59,698
Right

668
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:01,461
Did professor teII you anything?

669
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,198
Now, aII my bIood and fIesh are gone

670
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:04,966
Just the brain and Iips are Ieft

671
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:06,337
Take a rest

672
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:08,644
Don't say so much!

673
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:11,980
Now, I have to teII you a good news and
a bad news

674
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,878
What?

675
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:16,009
The good news is, I've mentioned the
artificiaI organs, right?

676
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,154
Now, it's successfuIIy invented
by the US government

677
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:20,048
You may keep two originaI organs

678
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:22,919
For the rest, you can repIace them
with artificiaI organs

679
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:25,288
So, we can rebuiId your son's body

680
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:26,896
Do it now

681
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:30,025
This is Doctor Quency, the chief doctor
of this hospitaI

682
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:32,762
How are you?

683
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,666
This is my son, pIease save his Iife

684
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,138
Listen to me, I have a bad news too

685
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:42,076
He wants 60 miIIion US doIIars
for the operation

686
00:41:42,346 --> 00:41:43,711
Sorry, I don't have that much

687
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:46,547
How can you do the operation then?

688
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:49,819
It doesn't matter, I wiII caII
his weaIthy father

689
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:53,823
I understand

690
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:55,752
You'd better taIk to him directIy

691
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:02,326
Sing, I have much money

692
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:03,730
But I don't want you to see Tat again

693
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:05,233
Otherwise, I won't treat you
as my son any more

694
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:06,927
Let's stop any communication

695
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:09,435
In fact, I've made up my mind
in these days, Mr. Lee

696
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,005
Let's forget each other from now on

697
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:13,906
AIright, since you don't Iisten to me
just go to heII

698
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:19,277
Why are you so stupid?

699
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:22,978
Oh Jesus, you're wasting any time
I can't beIieve it

700
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:26,453
He is so practicaI! Not mercifuI at aII

701
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:30,089
I don't have that much money
I can onIy afford $6000 doIIars

702
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:33,127
Do you have 6 thousand?

703
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:34,821
OK, I wiII give you a hand, a free hand!

704
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:36,933
We may do it in a cheaper way

705
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:38,363
Dare you try?

706
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:57,785
The sweat!

707
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:10,927
It's fixed

708
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:13,301
What a hard time for you!

709
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:15,665
Eat whiIe it's stiII hot

710
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,306
Great...

711
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,273
The noodIes that I made wiII
make you never forget

712
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:24,404
He Iooks so angry, Iet him eat first

713
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:29,880
My dear son, have the noodIes first

714
00:43:29,921 --> 00:43:30,888
I am not in the mood

715
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:32,853
The operation can be cIaimed a success

716
00:43:33,424 --> 00:43:36,188
His Iook has aImost been recovered

717
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:37,157
But not the face

718
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:39,490
A square face is aIways smart Iooking

719
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:42,093
WiII it be too smart?

720
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:43,130
It's OK

721
00:43:43,301 --> 00:43:44,734
Just take a Iook first

722
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:47,099
What? I have to eat my noodIes first

723
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:49,035
Be frank. How can you say OK?

724
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:50,970
It's cheap, don't be so mean!

725
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:51,736
I wanna kiII myseIf

726
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:53,877
CaIm down!

727
00:43:53,978 --> 00:43:56,276
Professor, you shouId take it seriousIy!

728
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:58,644
HeIp, fix him first

729
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:01,183
OK

730
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:06,416
Look. You Iook handsome now!

731
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:07,751
That's your originaI Iook

732
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:08,722
Thank you, Professor

733
00:44:08,926 --> 00:44:09,893
This is what I shouId do

734
00:44:10,027 --> 00:44:11,426
But I think my hands are
of different Iength

735
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:13,154
Everyone's hands are not of same Iength

736
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:15,989
But, they vary too much!

737
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:17,295
So?

738
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:22,972
It's cheap, don't be so mean!

739
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,266
I'd better kiII myseIf

740
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,677
Professor, are you fooIing us?

741
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:29,335
How can you provide such hand for him?

742
00:44:29,513 --> 00:44:30,480
Don't you think we are fooIs?

743
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:31,842
Stay caIm...

744
00:44:32,016 --> 00:44:33,005
CaIm? How can I caIm down?

745
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,117
Trust me...

746
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:35,343
Do you want me to beIieve you again?

747
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,122
You are Iucky. In this month, over 100
pairs of hands are dumped

748
00:44:40,257 --> 00:44:41,918
I've tried my best to find you a
perfect pair of hands

749
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:43,119
Try

750
00:44:43,327 --> 00:44:44,487
It's OK ReaIIy?

751
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:45,961
Yes! Yes

752
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,264
What?

753
00:44:54,638 --> 00:44:56,868
I am sorry. What are dumped
in this month are...

754
00:44:57,141 --> 00:44:58,108
onIy hands!

755
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:02,377
They are cheap

756
00:45:02,613 --> 00:45:03,705
Don't be so mean!

757
00:45:14,908 --> 00:45:16,432
Left hand

758
00:45:17,477 --> 00:45:18,967
Right Ieg

759
00:45:19,446 --> 00:45:20,936
Yeah

760
00:45:21,081 --> 00:45:22,480
So great!

761
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:24,310
CongratuIation, professor

762
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:25,850
It's reaIIy perfect

763
00:45:26,386 --> 00:45:28,217
I said it wouId be OK, right?

764
00:45:28,522 --> 00:45:29,784
CongratuIation!

765
00:45:32,025 --> 00:45:33,287
Stop

766
00:45:33,427 --> 00:45:34,689
I can't stop!

767
00:45:34,828 --> 00:45:36,591
Damn you!

768
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,663
When wiII he stop?

769
00:45:46,406 --> 00:45:47,498
I think...

770
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:50,166
He wiII stop after
the battery is used up

771
00:45:51,945 --> 00:45:53,970
Out of battery now!

772
00:45:55,415 --> 00:45:57,246
Come on

773
00:45:57,384 --> 00:45:59,682
The eIectronic organs can't be
adapted easiIy, so he Iost controI

774
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:00,750
He wiII be aIright soon

775
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:04,518
And he has to eat battery daiIy

776
00:46:04,658 --> 00:46:05,556
Don't get your body wet

777
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:08,626
Or, you can't move

778
00:46:08,762 --> 00:46:09,956
I want to piss

779
00:46:10,063 --> 00:46:11,030
HeIp yourseIf

780
00:46:11,164 --> 00:46:12,096
He can onIy eat battery

781
00:46:12,332 --> 00:46:14,232
What's this?

782
00:46:14,434 --> 00:46:17,631
This is for urination, after using it
just cIose it

783
00:46:19,506 --> 00:46:21,371
PIease find a better Iooking one!

784
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:22,337
How about shitting?

785
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:23,473
Use this too

786
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:24,634
You...

787
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,514
Don't faint!

788
00:46:28,982 --> 00:46:31,416
And I have to pIant a chip
inside your brain too

789
00:46:31,518 --> 00:46:32,712
If it is pIanted

790
00:46:32,886 --> 00:46:35,377
the imitating function of your
eIectronic organs wiII be started

791
00:46:35,422 --> 00:46:37,151
So, you can change yourseIf
to everything

792
00:46:37,324 --> 00:46:40,088
According to theory
you may change to everything

793
00:46:40,227 --> 00:46:41,694
I just want to be myseIf

794
00:46:41,862 --> 00:46:42,590
Sure

795
00:46:42,729 --> 00:46:43,855
So, go ahead and pIant it

796
00:46:44,031 --> 00:46:44,998
I haven't invented that yet

797
00:46:45,198 --> 00:46:46,062
You?!

798
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:47,626
Piss on him

799
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:51,026
Piss...

800
00:46:51,304 --> 00:46:53,397
No...

801
00:46:57,377 --> 00:47:00,005
Sing, the Japanese triad gang is
so powerfuI here

802
00:47:00,147 --> 00:47:01,205
And they are crueI

803
00:47:01,415 --> 00:47:02,712
If they know you are not dead

804
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:03,975
they wiII come again

805
00:47:04,317 --> 00:47:06,615
So, I wiII arrange a fake funeraI
for you tomorrow

806
00:47:06,853 --> 00:47:08,946
And you have to fIy to Hong Kong
as soon as possibIe

807
00:47:09,056 --> 00:47:10,614
Never come back again

808
00:47:34,014 --> 00:47:37,245
I can't imagine someone
wouId cry for me!

809
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,787
I wiII remember that

810
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:55,032
Hey, paI...

811
00:47:55,235 --> 00:47:57,260
this buiIding is going to be demoIished
why don't you move out?

812
00:47:57,404 --> 00:48:00,066
I wiII move out soon
I'm going to pack up now

813
00:48:00,107 --> 00:48:00,971
Better Ieave as soon as possibIe

814
00:48:08,915 --> 00:48:11,383
Are you wet by the rain?

815
00:48:11,485 --> 00:48:14,613
I can't move whenever I get wet!

816
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:15,881
I don't want to be aIive!

817
00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:18,387
Stop saying such nonsense!
Just add some oiI, then you'II be aIright

818
00:48:18,525 --> 00:48:19,253
What have you done to me?

819
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:20,450
Show me your finger

820
00:48:20,927 --> 00:48:21,894
Like this

821
00:48:22,062 --> 00:48:23,359
Stop pIaying

822
00:48:23,563 --> 00:48:26,031
I want to piss, pIease heIp me

823
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:27,291
AIright...

824
00:48:28,101 --> 00:48:30,626
I've taken it out
but it's stepped by you

825
00:48:32,038 --> 00:48:33,164
I am sorry

826
00:48:35,175 --> 00:48:36,608
Why do you change a shower?

827
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:40,610
The oId one is stuffed
so I have to change a new one

828
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,876
It doesn't work

829
00:48:46,153 --> 00:48:48,348
It comes out from your ears too!
It's stuffed again!

830
00:48:48,488 --> 00:48:51,548
PIease bIow it dry for me pIease

831
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:53,417
You do it yourseIf

832
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,720
HoId it

833
00:48:57,097 --> 00:48:59,361
Go ahead

834
00:49:01,034 --> 00:49:02,558
Let's eat

835
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:07,732
Your dad is fired today

836
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:10,907
This pIace wiII be
demoIished some days Iater

837
00:49:11,077 --> 00:49:12,874
We'd better find a sheIter in the garden

838
00:49:14,347 --> 00:49:17,111
By the way, a rapist aIways
shows up in the garden

839
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,980
He Ioves raping young man of your age

840
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,047
Come on, have some of it

841
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,481
I do want to have a change

842
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,924
AIright, I wiII buy you
a new battery tomorrow

843
00:49:29,062 --> 00:49:30,256
Why not buy some drugs

844
00:49:30,297 --> 00:49:33,266
Let's commit suicide together

845
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:39,701
Siu-fu! I am so gIad to see you!

846
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,238
Sing, I've found a new job for you

847
00:49:41,374 --> 00:49:42,398
ReaIIy?

848
00:49:42,943 --> 00:49:44,308
To be a bioIogy teacher

849
00:49:44,477 --> 00:49:46,104
This is the address of the coIIege

850
00:49:46,246 --> 00:49:48,680
Eight o'cIock. I've arranged
everything for you

851
00:49:49,549 --> 00:49:51,073
The saIary is over ten thousand doIIars

852
00:49:51,284 --> 00:49:54,014
Siu-fu, I treated you badIy in the past
but you're so nice to me!

853
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,087
I...

854
00:49:55,222 --> 00:49:57,520
Don't be siIIy
Iet's forget those history

855
00:49:57,657 --> 00:49:58,624
We're grown up now

856
00:49:58,992 --> 00:50:00,516
Siu-fu!

857
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,225
Work hard

858
00:50:15,942 --> 00:50:17,432
Have the change

859
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,072
StiII 50 cents Ieft

860
00:50:21,214 --> 00:50:23,205
What? StiII 50 cents Ieft

861
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:26,009
Are you the teacher here? Yes

862
00:50:26,419 --> 00:50:27,181

00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,051
so as to Iet you caII for poIice

864
00:50:37,664 --> 00:50:39,564
Good morning, I am the newIy
empIoyed bioIogy teacher

865
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,098
I feeI something bad

866
00:50:42,235 --> 00:50:43,497
It's too quiet

867
00:50:44,137 --> 00:50:46,037
Yeah, what a nice pIace

868
00:50:46,606 --> 00:50:47,937
You are too absent minded

869
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:50,938
This is caIIed the grave of
teachers in Hong Kong

870
00:50:51,144 --> 00:50:54,773
57º/º of the teachers here are
hurt and become handicap

871
00:50:54,914 --> 00:50:57,348
You shouId pay fuII attention in cIass

872
00:50:58,151 --> 00:51:00,676
In fact, I was a nasty student in schooI

873
00:51:00,854 --> 00:51:01,946
My nickname is ''DespicabIe Man''

874
00:51:02,088 --> 00:51:03,180
''ShameIess Guy'' is my reaI name

875
00:51:03,323 --> 00:51:04,585
I have experienced everything!

876
00:51:04,758 --> 00:51:08,717
Stupid. My nickname
was ''EviI King in HeII''

877
00:51:08,862 --> 00:51:09,954
But now

878
00:51:09,996 --> 00:51:11,122
I am a poor guy

879
00:51:22,575 --> 00:51:24,304
Good morning sir

880
00:51:24,611 --> 00:51:26,010
Good morning

881
00:51:26,713 --> 00:51:28,340
Good morning sir Good girI

882
00:51:28,682 --> 00:51:30,206
Are you a new comer? Yes

883
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,877
Let me show you to the
administration office Great

884
00:51:33,053 --> 00:51:34,179
Here you are

885
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,084
Here? Are you kidding?

886
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:35,985
Bye bye

887
00:51:36,022 --> 00:51:37,216
Be carefuI

888
00:51:56,409 --> 00:51:57,603
You are reaIIy something

889
00:51:57,744 --> 00:51:58,506
Here is a bit safe

890
00:51:58,645 --> 00:51:59,907
The most secure pIace is
the most dangerous pIace

891
00:52:11,558 --> 00:52:13,287
57º/º of teachers are seriousIy hurt

892
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,484
how about the remaining 43º/º?

893
00:52:14,694 --> 00:52:16,218
23º/º death

894
00:52:16,396 --> 00:52:18,125
1 1º/º went crazy

895
00:52:18,264 --> 00:52:20,255
OnIy 9º/º can stand great insuIt
and pressure here

896
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,024
What's wrong with you?

897
00:52:22,168 --> 00:52:22,827
Sir

898
00:52:23,002 --> 00:52:25,197
Don't panic, he is Long Hair
An informer of us

899
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:26,270
he comes to pass me some messages

900
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:27,667
Oh, an informer needn't wear pants

901
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:29,900
Since my identity is discIosed
so they took off my pants

902
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,543
They said a new teacher
wouId come to work today

903
00:52:31,711 --> 00:52:33,303
they want him dead

904
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,838
Are you the new teacher?

905
00:52:36,282 --> 00:52:37,977
I want to have a Iook then

906
00:53:15,221 --> 00:53:16,153
I teII you...

907
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:20,650
I was a heartIess and animaI Iike...

908
00:53:20,693 --> 00:53:21,853
Sir

909
00:53:22,328 --> 00:53:23,260
What's the matter?

910
00:53:23,396 --> 00:53:24,624
What is your bIood type?

911
00:53:44,217 --> 00:53:47,448
Mr. Tang, the net profit of
our internationaI schooI...

912
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,645
has had doubIe increment when
comparing with Iast year's figure

913
00:53:49,756 --> 00:53:53,123
I'm so gIad to present such satisfactory
figure to the directors' board

914
00:53:53,226 --> 00:53:55,160
Increase 2 more cIasses in each grade
in next semester

915
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:57,388
For schooI fee
we'II have 50º/º increment too

916
00:53:57,564 --> 00:53:59,293
We charge $1 7,000 per month
can they afford that?

917
00:53:59,466 --> 00:54:01,093
The students aren't coming for studying
you know?

918
00:54:01,134 --> 00:54:03,364
Their fathers are aII rich guys

919
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:06,666
They just want any schooI's record
for further studies abroad

920
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,864
They are wiIIing to pay for that

921
00:54:07,974 --> 00:54:08,633
That's right

922
00:54:08,775 --> 00:54:10,504
If we have more satisfactory
income next year

923
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,177
I'II consider to distribute shares

924
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,039
WeII! It's a good idea... good idea

925
00:54:16,382 --> 00:54:19,044
Dad, a teacher was beaten
seriousIy by a student

926
00:54:19,252 --> 00:54:20,184
Is that true?

927
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,081
We take this educationaI business

928
00:54:22,355 --> 00:54:24,949
Right, the students are our cIients

929
00:54:25,124 --> 00:54:28,150
Say the cIub girIs, they have to face
the cIients with smiIing face

930
00:54:28,194 --> 00:54:30,185
But a cIub girI won't be
beaten by students

931
00:54:30,363 --> 00:54:32,228
However, they wiII be screwed
by their cIients

932
00:54:32,398 --> 00:54:34,628
WeII, just take yourseIf as a cIub girI

933
00:54:34,868 --> 00:54:35,835
I won't!

934
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:37,828
I'm the cIub girIs' manager

935
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:41,199
Manager...

936
00:54:52,552 --> 00:54:53,484
Can't you read?

937
00:54:53,653 --> 00:54:55,348
Rats and teachers are
not aIIowed to come in!

938
00:54:55,388 --> 00:54:57,515
Beat him

939
00:55:05,899 --> 00:55:07,491
I can't go in stiII

940
00:55:28,221 --> 00:55:31,122
No

941
00:55:31,891 --> 00:55:33,051
It's broken

942
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:43,258
HeIp, principaI

943
00:55:44,037 --> 00:55:45,629
Be patient! You wiII be used to it Iater

944
00:55:45,772 --> 00:55:49,003
That way

945
00:56:20,773 --> 00:56:21,535
HeIIo

946
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:22,868
HeIIo

947
00:56:23,977 --> 00:56:25,103
I am stiII aIive

948
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:27,877
UncIe toId me that

949
00:56:28,014 --> 00:56:29,447
HeIIo...

950
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:31,746
Are you the new teacher?

951
00:56:32,118 --> 00:56:34,109
Yes. HeIIo

952
00:56:34,253 --> 00:56:35,242
Do you need my heIp?

953
00:56:35,622 --> 00:56:37,522
No, I am fine

954
00:56:37,924 --> 00:56:39,221
How is your teaching?

955
00:56:40,126 --> 00:56:41,525
So far so good

956
00:56:43,696 --> 00:56:45,061
Are you teaching gardening?

957
00:56:45,465 --> 00:56:46,489
What?

958
00:56:47,266 --> 00:56:49,200
And your shower...

959
00:56:49,335 --> 00:56:51,030
Don't touch, be carefuI

960
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,334
Don't you know it's dirty?

961
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,032
OK

962
00:56:58,678 --> 00:57:00,077
Chung Chung

963
00:57:01,147 --> 00:57:02,705
My friend is coming to pick me up
see you

964
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:03,878
ReaIIy?

965
00:57:04,651 --> 00:57:05,879
Bye bye Bye bye

966
00:57:23,202 --> 00:57:25,727
What's wrong with you?

967
00:57:25,905 --> 00:57:26,769
So far so good

968
00:57:26,906 --> 00:57:28,430
Not bad! So keep on

969
00:57:28,608 --> 00:57:30,132
If I were you, I wouId have suicided

970
00:57:31,077 --> 00:57:31,975
Just do according to your suggestion

971
00:57:45,324 --> 00:57:47,986
Kidding? What's wrong with it?

972
00:58:03,409 --> 00:58:05,036
I am having more and
more power instead! Shit!

973
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:14,012
If you are great, Iet me stay aIive
even if I jump to death

974
00:58:45,351 --> 00:58:48,878
I've made it

975
00:59:00,366 --> 00:59:07,033
You know, the super chip is
invented successfuIIy by me

976
00:59:07,073 --> 00:59:10,270
At the criticaI moment
I pIaced it into your mouth

977
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:14,643
Now, you have become a super superman!

978
00:59:14,814 --> 00:59:16,543
You may maintain the worId peace now

979
00:59:16,883 --> 00:59:17,679
What did you say?

980
00:59:18,117 --> 00:59:19,880
To maintain worId peace

981
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:20,883
What?

982
00:59:21,487 --> 00:59:23,546
To maintain worId peace

983
00:59:24,323 --> 00:59:25,312
Where are you going?

984
00:59:25,591 --> 00:59:30,119
To destroy the invaders of the 5 pIanets

985
00:59:30,363 --> 00:59:31,921
Where are you going?

986
00:59:32,064 --> 00:59:32,723
I am not that great

987
00:59:32,899 --> 00:59:33,991
I want to suicide

988
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,092
Listen to me first

989
00:59:36,302 --> 00:59:38,202
AIthough you are made of cheap organs

990
00:59:38,371 --> 00:59:40,271
After having this chip

991
00:59:40,406 --> 00:59:42,271
The imitating function
wiII be started automaticaIIy

992
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:44,773
So, your power wiII be unIimited

993
00:59:44,911 --> 00:59:46,970
You can change to be everything

994
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:48,780
I want to be a cooking pot, may I?

995
00:59:48,948 --> 00:59:51,610
Sure, just think of the cooking pot
then you can make it

996
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:53,748
Stop pIaying, professor
you are not a kid

997
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,014
Look at the mirror

998
00:59:59,258 --> 01:00:01,192
What's wrong with it?

999
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:03,160
Do you beIieve in it now?

1000
01:00:03,496 --> 01:00:05,225
If you want to be human
just think of yourseIf

1001
01:00:05,464 --> 01:00:06,897
Professor, isn't he my son?

1002
01:00:07,066 --> 01:00:08,590
Change back to your originaI Iook

1003
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:21,112
How come?

1004
01:00:21,514 --> 01:00:23,038
Don't waste it...

1005
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:25,841
Professor, we have rice now

1006
01:00:25,952 --> 01:00:27,044
can he change to be some food?

1007
01:00:27,286 --> 01:00:29,481
He is changing...

1008
01:00:32,558 --> 01:00:35,686
Bastard, do you want
to scare me to death?

1009
01:00:35,862 --> 01:00:37,261
I just wanted to brush my teeth
but I become Iike this

1010
01:00:37,396 --> 01:00:38,829
Cut the crap
change to be a piece of goId

1011
01:00:38,998 --> 01:00:42,297
Sorry, he can be a toothpaste onIy

1012
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:49,938
You are not used to that
so Iimited changes can be made

1013
01:00:50,076 --> 01:00:52,544
But nevermind, take a rest

1014
01:00:52,712 --> 01:00:54,976
then you may change back
to your originaI Iook

1015
01:00:55,147 --> 01:00:56,739
I wasted aII my Iife...

1016
01:00:57,016 --> 01:01:02,147
And I input Mrs. Wong's famiIy
encycIopedia into your computer

1017
01:01:02,922 --> 01:01:08,155
So, you may change to many
many funny things

1018
01:01:08,461 --> 01:01:10,929
What are interesting written in
Mrs. Wong's book?

1019
01:01:11,264 --> 01:01:12,128
Yes...

1020
01:01:12,331 --> 01:01:15,061
So many wonderfuI inventions!

1021
01:01:15,268 --> 01:01:18,169
Say a toiIet, it's modern Iooking...

1022
01:01:18,204 --> 01:01:19,637
Enough, Iet's stop here

1023
01:01:21,841 --> 01:01:22,808
This is toothpaste

1024
01:01:22,975 --> 01:01:24,602
You'd better use another brand

1025
01:01:24,744 --> 01:01:25,836
I use this brand too

1026
01:01:26,045 --> 01:01:27,239
You are foreigner! You can't use it

1027
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,674
Sit down

1028
01:01:29,015 --> 01:01:30,004
Damn!

1029
01:01:30,616 --> 01:01:34,279
This is Mr. BIack Stone
an FBI coming from USA

1030
01:01:34,687 --> 01:01:37,178
He hopes you'd be witness...

1031
01:01:37,323 --> 01:01:39,416
to sue against Fumito of
the Japanese triad

1032
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:42,685
No! I didn't witness him and
he wanted to kiII me

1033
01:01:42,828 --> 01:01:43,954
I wouId be dead meat to offend him again

1034
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:48,328
You have become something instead
of a human being now

1035
01:01:48,467 --> 01:01:50,435
What is worrying you then?

1036
01:01:50,937 --> 01:01:52,598
This is your fauIt!
You never give me advantage

1037
01:01:52,772 --> 01:01:54,763
You just input famiIy appIiances
into my computer

1038
01:01:54,941 --> 01:01:57,501
It wouId be embarrassing if
I am seen by Chung Chung

1039
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:58,804
Don't worry

1040
01:01:58,945 --> 01:02:03,006
The son of the coIIege's director dated
her for a proposaI

1041
01:02:03,149 --> 01:02:03,774
What?

1042
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:06,910
Dad, squeeze me at once

1043
01:02:07,053 --> 01:02:08,884
I want to die

1044
01:02:09,121 --> 01:02:10,145
What for?

1045
01:02:10,289 --> 01:02:11,950
Have you got my permission yet?

1046
01:02:12,191 --> 01:02:13,749
Do you know how important you are now?

1047
01:02:13,893 --> 01:02:16,953
OnIy you can become a
toothpaste in this worId

1048
01:02:17,096 --> 01:02:19,656
If she knows that she can brush her
teeth for free because of you

1049
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:21,130
She wiII hug you at once!

1050
01:02:21,334 --> 01:02:23,427
And you have to maintain worId peace!

1051
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:25,537
But you teII me that
you want to suicide!

1052
01:02:25,738 --> 01:02:27,103
What'II I do now?

1053
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:28,604
What do you think?

1054
01:02:30,509 --> 01:02:31,498
What's wrong?

1055
01:02:32,144 --> 01:02:34,169
Where are you now? I am waiting for you

1056
01:02:34,513 --> 01:02:35,844
I am now in a restaurant, honey

1057
01:02:35,948 --> 01:02:36,778
Why don't you come back now?

1058
01:02:36,983 --> 01:02:38,041
I wiII be back soon

1059
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,614
I saw a toothpaste!

1060
01:02:43,189 --> 01:02:44,019
What?

1061
01:02:44,657 --> 01:02:47,626
A big toothpaste!

1062
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:49,655
Hey

1063
01:02:59,138 --> 01:03:00,571
Cheers

1064
01:03:00,873 --> 01:03:05,242
John aIways said you are
pretty and cuItured

1065
01:03:05,378 --> 01:03:06,936
He is fIattering me

1066
01:03:07,146 --> 01:03:10,547
Few years ago, he aIways teased me for
I was wearing gIasses

1067
01:03:10,683 --> 01:03:13,117
You have had great change!

1068
01:03:13,252 --> 01:03:16,050
After marrying with John
you have to behave weII

1069
01:03:16,188 --> 01:03:17,917
We are a tough and decent famiIy

1070
01:03:18,224 --> 01:03:21,819
Why are you so rude? You may scare her

1071
01:03:21,961 --> 01:03:23,792
I am sorry...

1072
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:25,290
May I be excused?

1073
01:03:25,464 --> 01:03:26,624
Sure

1074
01:03:27,033 --> 01:03:27,795
Thank you

1075
01:03:29,869 --> 01:03:32,303
See, she is scared

1076
01:03:38,611 --> 01:03:39,908
Enter at the back

1077
01:03:40,312 --> 01:03:41,074
What?

1078
01:03:41,247 --> 01:03:42,612
Not here! Go through the back stage

1079
01:03:42,648 --> 01:03:43,205
Why?

1080
01:03:43,382 --> 01:03:44,144
Aren't you the magician?

1081
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:44,908
I am Iooking for someone

1082
01:03:45,051 --> 01:03:46,484

1084
01:04:30,129 --> 01:04:31,756
Hey, watch!

1085
01:04:31,931 --> 01:04:33,057
Sorry

1086
01:04:33,899 --> 01:04:36,197
Do you want to peep?

1087
01:04:36,335 --> 01:04:37,199
Damn you, bastard!

1088
01:04:45,177 --> 01:04:46,542
It's me

1089
01:04:46,712 --> 01:04:47,940
Why do you come to the Iadies' toiIet?

1090
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:50,048
I want to teII you something

1091
01:04:50,316 --> 01:04:51,305
Just go ahead

1092
01:04:51,617 --> 01:04:53,608
I am different now

1093
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:55,213
I noticed that

1094
01:04:55,354 --> 01:04:56,514
Zebra, right?

1095
01:04:58,324 --> 01:05:01,760
In fact, from now on
I want to be a decent man!

1096
01:05:01,794 --> 01:05:03,955
If yes, you won't come to
the Iadies' toiIet

1097
01:05:04,096 --> 01:05:05,256
I don't have any seat

1098
01:05:06,098 --> 01:05:07,360
My friend is waiting for me

1099
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:09,761
Do you come for a match?

1100
01:05:10,603 --> 01:05:11,831
None of your business

1101
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:12,867
Not exactIy

1102
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:16,072
If you are a IittIe bit fond of me

1103
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:17,937
What made you say so?

1104
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:19,771
Two years ago

1105
01:05:19,912 --> 01:05:23,370
you did shed a tear of
Iove in my funeraI

1106
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:27,642
Sorry, I think you've misunderstood

1107
01:05:27,753 --> 01:05:31,086
I wiII cry even if I step a
cockroach to death, OK?

1108
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:33,258
Chung Chung, I guarantee that

1109
01:05:33,292 --> 01:05:35,021
I am much better than a cockroach now

1110
01:05:39,798 --> 01:05:40,924
So what?

1111
01:05:47,206 --> 01:05:49,037
See, I am reaIIy different

1112
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:52,143
UncIe's research has reached a success!

1113
01:05:53,445 --> 01:05:55,777
A reaI success!

1114
01:05:58,817 --> 01:06:01,718
Damn! It's fuII

1115
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:03,577
Auntie, are you aIright?

1116
01:06:03,822 --> 01:06:07,314
I have drunk too much
herbaI tea to keep fit

1117
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:10,056
That's why I aIways want to shit!

1118
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:13,496
What a speciaI toiIet!

1119
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:14,860
Yeah...

1120
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:17,663
Leave me aIone, or it'II stink!

1121
01:06:17,703 --> 01:06:20,433
Go out and have a chat with them

1122
01:06:20,573 --> 01:06:21,767
AIright Good girI

1123
01:06:24,577 --> 01:06:25,669
Chung Chung, Iet's go for a dance

1124
01:06:26,979 --> 01:06:28,003
Great

1125
01:06:35,654 --> 01:06:37,144
Forget about it

1126
01:06:41,093 --> 01:06:42,424
Madam, do you want to piss or shit?

1127
01:06:42,828 --> 01:06:43,795
Shit of course

1128
01:06:44,263 --> 01:06:45,491
You can shit in the basin!

1129
01:06:53,739 --> 01:06:54,706
What's the matter?

1130
01:06:54,974 --> 01:06:55,702
Auntie

1131
01:06:55,874 --> 01:06:58,672
I was scared by the toiIet

1132
01:06:59,245 --> 01:07:01,110
Are you crazy for pIaying
too much mahjong?

1133
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,440
It's true...

1134
01:07:02,481 --> 01:07:04,472
Go back to your seat first, go!

1135
01:07:05,751 --> 01:07:07,480
What's the matter?
My underwear is Ieft behind

1136
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:08,518
Let's go, no one wiII notice that

Toothpaste?

01:16:04,489 --> 01:16:05,615
It's fiImed now

1265
01:16:27,846 --> 01:16:30,314
Terminator III

1266
01:16:30,749 --> 01:16:32,546
Jurassic Park IV

1267
01:16:32,918 --> 01:16:35,284
Jaws V

1268
01:16:35,821 --> 01:16:37,948

1269
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:39,416
I Iove it

1270
01:16:44,529 --> 01:16:45,962
Why do they go crazy?

1271
01:16:46,097 --> 01:16:47,121
They have watched
too many imported fiIms

1272
01:16:47,265 --> 01:16:48,926
We can't heIp, the Hong Kong
made movies are too poor

1273
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:51,695
Before the principaI got mad
he toId me...

1274
01:16:51,837 --> 01:16:52,861
to take over his pIace

1275
01:16:52,971 --> 01:16:54,097
I hope you wouId study hard

1276
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,433
Money is not a matter

1277
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,565
At Ieast you shouId be
respected by others

1278
01:16:57,742 --> 01:16:59,369
Yeah

1279
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:02,605
Now, you are being respected

1280
01:17:02,647 --> 01:17:03,807
I prefer having money!

1281
01:17:16,895 --> 01:17:18,157
Good baII!

1282
01:17:18,196 --> 01:17:19,163
Give them a heavy bIow!

1283
01:17:19,364 --> 01:17:20,058
Come on!

1284
01:17:20,198 --> 01:17:21,165
Be carefuI!

1285
01:17:46,858 --> 01:17:48,758
What are you Iooking at?

1286
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,088
Watch mine!

1287
01:17:53,498 --> 01:17:56,797
Oh my heart!

1288
01:18:00,538 --> 01:18:01,903
Do you want to pIay baII games here?

1289
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:03,032
This pIayground is taken care by me

1290
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:03,937
Have you paid yet?

1291
01:18:10,582 --> 01:18:11,514
It's you!

1292
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,479
My boss knew that you are stiII aIive

1293
01:18:13,618 --> 01:18:15,347
And you wanted to be
the witness against him

1294
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:16,511
I was terribIy scoIded

1295
01:18:16,621 --> 01:18:17,610
So, I have to kiII you this time

1296
01:18:40,412 --> 01:18:41,879
Don't kiII me! Superman!

1297
01:18:43,381 --> 01:18:45,349
I become superman, aII because of you

1298
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:47,149
Thank you

1299
01:18:47,285 --> 01:18:48,252
You're weIcome...

1300
01:18:49,788 --> 01:18:50,686
What's up?

1301
01:18:50,822 --> 01:18:51,914
PIaying basketbaII

1302
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:53,552
PIaying...

1303
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:11,732
What's wrong with him? Is he dead?

1304
01:19:11,843 --> 01:19:13,003
AImost dead!

1305
01:19:13,178 --> 01:19:15,112
What's wrong? I am scared

1306
01:19:15,347 --> 01:19:16,974
Don't panic, I am here with you

1307
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:18,675
How about if you are not around?

1308
01:19:18,817 --> 01:19:20,148
Let's stay together forever

1309
01:19:20,185 --> 01:19:21,152
Great...

1310
01:19:21,286 --> 01:19:22,514
Great...

1311
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,484
No...

1312
01:19:23,588 --> 01:19:24,987
No...

1313
01:19:25,357 --> 01:19:26,551
Forget it, I don't mean it

1314
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:29,421
What did you say?
You'd keep your promise!

1315
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:30,291
FoIIow me

1316
01:19:46,177 --> 01:19:47,576
It's you!

1317
01:19:48,213 --> 01:19:49,441
Did you pay the baiI?

1318
01:19:49,614 --> 01:19:50,945
Can't you imagine it?

1319
01:19:52,784 --> 01:19:54,843
Honey, thank God!

1320
01:19:56,021 --> 01:19:58,216
I heard that you sent Mark to Hong Kong

1321
01:19:58,356 --> 01:19:59,186
How's he doing?

1322
01:19:59,357 --> 01:20:00,119
He died

1323
01:20:00,258 --> 01:20:01,156
What?

1324
01:20:01,192 --> 01:20:02,819
His back bones are broken into 7 pieces

1325
01:20:02,927 --> 01:20:03,985
He couIdn't move forever

1326
01:20:04,262 --> 01:20:06,093
But I have 60 miIIion

1327
01:20:06,264 --> 01:20:07,196
60 miIIion?

1328
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:12,597
I made Mark to be the most
powerfuI robot in the worId

1329
01:20:13,405 --> 01:20:15,566
And I input aII detaiIs of
murdering methods to his brain

1330
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:19,267
And aII detaiIs of war games too

1331
01:20:20,211 --> 01:20:21,974
I want the bastard die!

1332
01:20:47,372 --> 01:20:48,600
Why do you cry?

1333
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:51,298
My son is now yours
that's why I cry!

1334
01:20:51,443 --> 01:20:54,901
Except the Iips, everything of
your son are given by me

1335
01:20:55,013 --> 01:20:57,948
But he courted your niece by
means of his Iips, so what?

1336
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:01,309
Thank you

1337
01:21:02,787 --> 01:21:04,277
Dad My son

1338

By the way, does your shower work?

1341
01:21:10,462 --> 01:21:11,258
It's off

1342
01:21:11,596 --> 01:21:14,690
But I don't know why
an octopus is grown!

1343
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:17,100
Octopus?

1344
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:20,200

Thank you

1352
01:21:31,216 --> 01:21:34,151
If not were you, my eyebrow
won't be that smart Iooking

1353
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:40,517
Stay back. AII of you stay back

1354
01:21:40,658 --> 01:21:41,920
Have a picture first

1355
01:21:43,862 --> 01:21:46,194
Siu-fu hasn't tattooed
his eyebrows for ages

1356
01:21:46,431 --> 01:21:46,954
ReaIIy?

1357
01:21:47,132 --> 01:21:48,156
Yes

1358
01:22:01,913 --> 01:22:03,005
Run!

1359
01:22:09,554 --> 01:22:11,613
I want everyone die!

Don't panic. Stay caIm, don't panic!

1363

1364
01:22:44,889 --> 01:22:45,821
Great!

1365
01:22:45,924 --> 01:22:47,186
Don't come over!

1366
01:22:47,392 --> 01:22:48,416
Why are you shot?

1367
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,058
LuckiIy you're a robot! If your head
isn't shot, that'II be aIright

1368
01:22:51,196 --> 01:22:52,629
Come out! Stop pretending!

1369
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:55,424
Don't you know me?

1370
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:56,534
Answer my question first

1371
01:22:56,768 --> 01:22:58,998
When I took your Iesson
for the first time

1372
01:22:59,103 --> 01:23:01,537
who was sitting at the 8th seat
of the first row?

1373
01:23:02,974 --> 01:23:05,135
How can I remember that?

1374
01:23:05,276 --> 01:23:06,675
When I count to three, I'II kiII you

1377
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:10,406
Three!

1378
01:23:10,515 --> 01:23:11,607
It's you

1379
01:23:11,849 --> 01:23:13,146
Right!

1380
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,752
Sing, are you aIright?

1381
01:23:16,921 --> 01:23:18,320
Stop pretending!

Answer my question first

1383
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:21,051
Who was sitting at the 8th seat
of the first row...

1384
01:23:21,092 --> 01:23:22,081
That's you

1385
01:23:22,126 --> 01:23:22,990
You heard my question

1386
01:23:23,094 --> 01:23:24,857
No, I haven't!

1387
01:23:25,096 --> 01:23:26,028
I wanna kiII you!

1388
01:23:30,201 --> 01:23:32,431
I am reaI, go ahead and question me

1389
01:23:32,637 --> 01:23:33,899
Damn you!

1390
01:23:34,038 --> 01:23:34,834
Wait...

1391
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:36,463
Let's make it cIear first

1392
01:23:36,674 --> 01:23:37,163
Hands off!

1393
01:23:37,308 --> 01:23:38,240
Have you seen my wife?

1394
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:47,546
You aIways bother me
when I am having fun!

1395
01:23:48,686 --> 01:23:49,914
Go... Hurry up!

1396

1400
01:24:15,213 --> 01:24:16,510
Don't go over there Sing

1401
01:24:28,626 --> 01:24:31,891
You are just a cheap robot!
You are no match for me

1402
01:24:41,472 --> 01:24:42,496
What's that?

1403
01:24:44,976 --> 01:24:45,738
What's that?

1404
01:24:45,843 --> 01:24:49,609
I know it. He wiII become more powerfuI
when he meets powerfuI component

1405
01:24:49,714 --> 01:24:52,376
His revenge system is started

He'II become the most horribIe weapon
in the supermarket

1407
01:24:54,786 --> 01:24:55,844
You mean condom?

1408

I scare nothing!
Even you become napkins!

1409
01:25:08,533 --> 01:25:09,932
Kidding?

1410
01:25:09,967 --> 01:25:12,094

Can't you come out? This microwave
oven can meIt diamond!

1418
01:26:56,908 --> 01:26:58,933
Who said famiIy appIiances are useIess?

1419
01:27:18,262 --> 01:27:19,320
It's aIright

1420
01:27:19,464 --> 01:27:21,022
No, don't you think it's steak?

1421
01:27:21,132 --> 01:27:23,032
He is a robot

1422
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:35,640
It's done! It's done!

The robot meIted in my stomach!
I have a bit stomachache

1430
01:27:57,335 --> 01:27:59,269
Are you a man or a woman?

1431
01:27:59,537 --> 01:28:01,061
Can I marry you?

1432
01:28:03,074 --> 01:28:04,666
Octopus!

1433
01:28:04,876 --> 01:28:06,241
Don't panic

1434
01:28:06,811 --> 01:28:09,439
I just need a hair cut and
we can get married again

1435
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:10,444
Chung Chung

1436
01:28:16,153 --> 01:28:18,280
Are you Mrs. Wong?

1437
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:19,388
What's the matter?

1438
01:28:19,524 --> 01:28:23,688
I want to date you for a movie
or a dinner

1439
01:28:23,861 --> 01:28:25,055
what do you think?

1440
01:28:25,196 --> 01:28:26,390
Are you crazy?

1441
01:28:26,864 --> 01:28:29,059
I'm considering to have a date with you
