1
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:07,247
Honey, you sent in

2
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,249
All the deposit checks, right?

3
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,708
Yeah, I think so.

4
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:13,753
What do you mean, you think so?

5
00:01:13,753 --> 00:01:15,754
I mean--What? I mean,
I sent a lot of checks.

6
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:17,255
I think I sent them all.

7
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:18,756
The--The wedding
cake check?

8
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:19,757
Sent it.

9
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:21,758
Ok, the photographer? Sent it.

10
00:01:22,134 --> 00:01:23,760
Ok, the hotel for my parents?

11
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:25,220
Sent it. The band?

12
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,762
Brought that one to them, yeah.

13
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:27,763
Ok? Yeah.

14
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:29,764
The tent and judge. Judge townsend.

15
00:01:29,764 --> 00:01:32,225
Uh, honey, the tent? I
don't know about that.

16
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:34,726
You forgot the tent check?

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,270
I
th--

18
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,729
Why? Why would-- Why did
you forget the tent check?

19
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:40,272
Why? I forgot. I forgot.

20
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,274
You can't play around
with these tent people.

21
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:44,275
You can't. You can't
play around with them.

22
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:45,276
I know. I've been dealing with them,

23
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:46,735
And believe me, I'm
not playing with them.

24
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:48,737
Kyle...

25
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:51,239
I have been doing all
of this by myself, ok?

26
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,241
I know. I have been busting my ass.

27
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:55,242
I have done absolutely
everything, everything,

28
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:57,243
Everything, everything,
everything by myself.

29
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,245
I know.

30
00:01:58,245 --> 00:01:59,245
Ok, everything has been on my own, ok?

31
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,747
Ok, I've been doing it all.

32
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:04,749
I bet you didn't forget

33
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,250
The bachelor party checks.

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,754
Ok...is that what this--
Is that what this is about?

35
00:02:11,254 --> 00:02:12,046
No!

36
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:13,255
Because we could talk about it. No!

37
00:02:13,255 --> 00:02:14,256
Let's go over it again. No, no, no.

38
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,257
No, It's ok.

39
00:02:15,257 --> 00:02:16,758
No, I'm just saying that I'm sure

40
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:18,259
That those checks found
their way to the mailbox.

41
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,260
That's all.

42
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:20,761
I wouldn't know.

43
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:22,262
It amazes me, you know,
It really amazes me

44
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:25,264
How you and your little fun
bunch can become so organized

45
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:26,766
When it comes to mobilizing to Vegas.

46
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:28,267
It's not-- It's
not me doing it.

47
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,267
It's them handling it all.

48
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:32,562
And I'm sure that Boyd is the
creative force behind all of this.

49
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:35,272
Yeah, Boyd--Boyd's
organizing the whole thing.

50
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:39,275
Robert Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.

51
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:43,779
Robert Boyd.

52
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,780
Tina...great, ok.
Here's the deal--

53
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,783
We're talking 5 guys.

54
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:51,784
Nice guys, Tina. My friends.

55
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:54,245
Yeah. Well, I'm calling you directly

56
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:56,746
So you don't have to
go through the agency.

57
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:59,707
Hey! Could you please
not enter the house?

58
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:02,292
That's correct. Cash straight to you.

59
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:04,752
Could you hold on?

60
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:07,296
Could you please wait off the property?

61
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:08,755
We're just trying to sneak a peak.

62
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:11,758
Well, just stay off the
property until I'm off the phone.

63
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:12,717
Why?

64
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,260
Because that's the way we do it.

65
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:16,262
Chop, chop.

66
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:29,271
So, it's 5 guys, 900
bucks, just dancing.

67
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:30,772
Anything else is extra.

68
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:32,189
Are you in?

69
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,775
It's just how I feel. I feel
that, at some point in time,

70
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:37,277
You're going to have to reevaluate
some of your friendships.

71
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:39,279
Well...ok.

72
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,738
Specifically--
Specifically who?

73
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:42,781
Charles Moore.

74
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:44,741
You don't like Moore?

75
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:46,284
I just don't see him in the big picture.

76
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:48,285
Ok...but realize,

77
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:51,288
I've known him since the third grade.

78
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:52,288
Well, he's weird.

79
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:53,789
He's quiet.

80
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:54,790
He's weird.

81
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,792
Hon, he just doesn't talk a lot.

82
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,793
Why? I mean, is he mildly retarded?

83
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:00,294
He never speaks! He's a mechanic.

84
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:03,296
Well, he's weird, Kyle,
and frankly, I really--

85
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:04,797
I--I expect
more from you.

86
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:06,799
Yeah, ok, wh-- You
expect more what?

87
00:04:07,258 --> 00:04:09,259
You are going to be
hung over for 3 days,

88
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:12,262
Like those guys on
oprah who-- Who get drunk

89
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:13,804
And have disgusting
sex with prostitutes,

90
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:15,806
And then they go ahead, and
they just say their vows.

91
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,808
They say their vows with the stench

92
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,767
Of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.

93
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:20,768
That's absurd. Listen to yourself.

94
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,310
It's Vile, Kyle. It's not Vile.

95
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,312
I've seen it on television.
I'm not going to--

96
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,604
What do you mean it's not Vile?!

97
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:25,772
I'm not going to marry you

98
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:27,314
With the cheap smell
of hotel whore sex--

99
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:29,316
I am not to be common, Kyle, ok?

100
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:30,775
I am a creature like no other.

101
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:32,777
I know that. I am a
creature like no other.

102
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:33,819
And I will not--I
will not be common.

103
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:35,279
Do you understand me? I got you.

104
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:37,280
Is that too much to ask,
Kyle? Is it too much to ask?

105
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:39,281
You won't be common!

106
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,826
Honey, take it.

107
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:44,827
Are we going to eat,
or am I just going to--

108
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,788
Honey...

109
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,288
Do you love me?

110
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,290
Of course I--
I love you.

111
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,291
Of course I love you.

112
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,333
How much?

113
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,335
I love you with all my heart.

114
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,835
Kiss me.

115
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,297
Look, it's just insecurity.

116
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,342
Kyle: I don't know. She's
just really been stressing.

117
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:05,843
It's insecurity,
nut-Gnawing gut-Splitters.

118
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:07,344
What does that mean?

119
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,346
It means she's insecure.

120
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:10,347
About what?

121
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:11,848
About--

122
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:13,349
Mike Berkow.

123
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:15,351
Just a second. All right, big man.

124
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:18,352
14.3. Thank you. 17.5.

125
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:20,855
4-6...29.83...

126
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:22,356
At 9.

127
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:23,648
Look at him.

128
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,358
I'm amazed that the windows

129
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,859
Don't blow out of their fucking sockets

130
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,318
With all the ass-Puckering rage

131
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:29,862
In these soulless lizards.

132
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,863
You know, I just-- I
just want her to be happy.

133
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:33,239
Same alarm clock every morning,

134
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:35,365
Same two pops on the same snooze button.

135
00:05:35,574 --> 00:05:38,451
Same shower, towel,
toothbrush, razor, blazer,

136
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:40,369
Hair pump, gel spray.
It's a fucking epi--

137
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:41,370
Woman: the beatrice accounts.

138
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:42,871
It's an epidemic, Fisher.

139
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:44,372
You're getting married, baby bub.

140
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:46,373
I'm not going to candy
coat it. It just gets worse.

141
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:47,875
It's an 18-Wheel cement truck

142
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,377
That's going to crush
every bone in your big body.

143
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:51,919
Well, I'm not breathing
right lately, either.

144
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,463
Course you're not.

145
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:55,964
I--I just start getting,
like, lightheaded and dizzy,

146
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:57,423
And then the next
thing I know, I realize

147
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,967
I haven't breathed in, like--In
two minutes. That's because--

148
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,427
Hey, hey, hey-- We're leaving
from my house in 3 hours, ok?

149
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,969
If you want to come, you better
get your numbers in order by then.

150
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:04,971
All right,
first of all--

151
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:07,431
No "first of all." I'm
not in a game mood, ok?

152
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:09,433
We were having a conversation, ok?

153
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:10,434
You never said "excuse me."

154
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:11,434
I'm sorry. Fisher, I'm sorry.

155
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,435
That's all right. We'll be there, Adam.

156
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:15,479
I know you'll be
ready. Michael--3 hours.

157
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:16,938
Ok. All right.

158
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:20,942
Look at that big,
blind, gawky bitch boy.

159
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:22,484
Well, he's your brother.

160
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:24,944
Freaks me out, man. You know that?

161
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:26,446
Panic junky, I want to smack him.

162
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:27,947
I don't deserve that.

163
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:29,448
Kyle Fisher.

164
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:30,948
We've got problems.

165
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:31,950
Problems?

166
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:33,451
Seating problems.

167
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:34,993
Ok,
well, uh--

168
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:37,454
Ok, first they said it wasunderstood

169
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:40,456
That we were supposed to have
gold-Trimmed, padded seats, right?

170
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:41,957
And now they're trying to tell me

171
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:43,959
That there's some sort
of misunderstanding

172
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:46,460
And that now we can't have padded ones!

173
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,463
Ok, so what kind of
seats can we have, then?

174
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:50,964
Nonpadded ones!

175
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:53,466
So what do we do about it?

176
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:54,967
Well, you're going to go down there.

177
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:56,468
Go down to where?

178
00:06:56,468 --> 00:06:57,469
You're going to go down,

179
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:58,469
And you're going to straighten out

180
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:59,387
Those chair people.

181
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:01,972
What--Honey, I'm going
to Vegas in 3 hours.

182
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:04,015
I need your help!

183
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:06,976
I'll call from the road.

184
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:08,519
Do you love me?

185
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:12,522
Do--More than I ever imagined
I could ever love anyone.

186
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:14,523
Straighten out these chairs?

187
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,025
Ok, listen, we're leaving from Adam's.

188
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:20,486
Why don't you come down and see me off?

189
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:22,029
Maybe.

190
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:26,032
Timmy, Adam junior,
take a good look at this

191
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:28,492
And notice how clean-Cut

192
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:30,035
And well-Behaved they all appear,

193
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:33,955
Respectable members of modern society.

194
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:35,206
That's us.

195
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,957
Ok, boys...smile.

196
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,458
Smile, dad. Smile.

197
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,542
Smile!

198
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,960
Hey. Smile...

199
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,961
Smile, smile...

200
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:45,380
We're smiling! And all right.

201
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:46,464
As you were!

202
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:48,465
Good-Bye. I love you.

203
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:49,967
I love you.

204
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:50,968
Have a really, really good time.

205
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:52,468
I'll be back tomorrow.

206
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,011
No, hey,
hey, hey--

207
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:56,013
No, no, don't let anybody
smoke in the car honey--

208
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:57,472
Because Adam Junior
gets sick, ok? Ok, I'm--

209
00:07:57,472 --> 00:08:00,392
Did you hear that, Boyd?
No smoking. I'm so serious.

210
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:02,476
I'll drive. Come on. Not on your life.

211
00:08:03,977 --> 00:08:06,980
Boyd, do you promise on
camera that you won't smoke?

212
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,481
Uh...I won't smoke.

213
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:09,981
Good. Thank you.

214
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:10,982
I'm coming, honey!

215
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:11,984
Bye, dad.

216
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:12,984
Don't smoke!

217
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:13,985
We won't smoke.

218
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:16,486
Bye! Bye!

219
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:17,988
Bye! Bye! Bye!

220
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:21,490
Vegas!

221
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:23,492
All right...

222
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:26,744
Dog needs a flea bath. Let's go.

223
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:39,504
Oh, what if I bring the wrong thing?

224
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:41,005
What if I bring cucumber soup?

225
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:43,006
Who cares! You're a fucking moron!

226
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,967
Shut up! It's my fucking opinion.

227
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,009
It's a stupid fucking opinion, ok?

228
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:47,468
Oh, thank you.

229
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,471
You have developed this incredibly
annoying habit of talking just...

230
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:53,473
For the pleasure of
hearing yourself speak.

231
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:55,515
Listen, he--Boyd
brought up statistics--

232
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:56,976
Hey, hey, hey! Leave me out of this.

233
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:57,976
The hell I did.

234
00:08:57,976 --> 00:08:58,977
The hell you
didn't. You said--

235
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:00,519
The hell
I did--

236
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,979
You said one out of every
two marriages ends in divorce.

237
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:03,480
You said it.
I didn't--

238
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:04,523
You're an asshole, Adam.

239
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:05,523
You're an asshole.

240
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:06,524
Oh, why am I an asshole?

241
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:07,484
Multiple reasons.

242
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:08,484
Give me one. No.

243
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:09,985
Name one reason. No!

244
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:11,986
Give me one reason. I'm
not going to give you--

245
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:12,988
You can't give me a
reason. I don't have to--

246
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:14,489
Give me one reason. Give it to me.

247
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:15,489
Shut up!

248
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,490
I want one reason.

249
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:17,824
Shut up for one second.

250
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:19,492
Give me a reason. I want a reason.

251
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:21,035
Shut up! Shut up!

252
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,495
You're just an asshole. Live with it.

253
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:24,997
Is this culver party rentals?

254
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,998
Yeah, can I speak to
whoever's in charge of chairs?

255
00:09:27,498 --> 00:09:28,499
Can't you wait till we get back there?

256
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll pay you for the call, ok?

257
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:31,501
I'm on a monthly rate, here.

258
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,002
How am I going to tell
what call is your call?

259
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:34,003
Just use my phone.

260
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:35,505
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

261
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:37,005
No, you're being ridiculous.
You're being a tightwad!

262
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:38,506
A tightwad, huh? Yeah!

263
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:41,009
Why don't you just say what
you mean, huh? Jew! Say it!

264
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:42,009
All right, you're a jew!

265
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,010
Yeah, "jew." I knew
it. You're being a jew!

266
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,511
I knew it was coming,
you goy is her fuck.

267
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:46,555
Shut up! Hello?

268
00:09:47,013 --> 00:09:48,014
Cheap bastard!

269
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:50,515
I'd like to speak to
somebody in chairs, please.

270
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:51,975
Hola. You drive like a jew!

271
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:53,518
Ah, how does a jew drive?

272
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:55,519
4 hours and 15 minutes. I can
make Vegas in 3 and change...

273
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,520
I'm not getting a ticket.

274
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,021
I'm not going to get a ticket for you.

275
00:09:58,021 --> 00:09:59,022
You slow-Driving son of a bitch!

276
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:00,523
Yes? Is this--
Let's go!

277
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:02,524
Tony, this is Kyle Fisher.

278
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,485
I have a wedding in a week.

279
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:07,028
We have--You're doing my
wedding with the chairs.

280
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:08,571
Every car is passing us.

281
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:10,030
Yeah, I'll hold.

282
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:11,073
Hold? You're going to hold?

283
00:10:11,073 --> 00:10:12,573
For chris sakes, call
him when we get there.

284
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,075
You're being a jew!

285
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:15,576
Please get off
the goddamn phone--

286
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:17,077
Yes, I'm holding
for tony in chairs--

287
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:18,911
Don't hold anymore! Hang up!

288
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:20,580
It's 45 cents a minute!

289
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,665
No, I'm not Tony. I'm holding for Tony.

290
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:14,078
Hello?

291
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:15,120
Kyle Hi.

292
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:17,122
Hello? Hey!

293
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:18,623
Is it--Hello--
Baby, is that you?

294
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:20,124
Hi.

295
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:21,126
Hi.

296
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:23,627
Are you calling me from jail? Not yet.

297
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:26,128
Hey, did you check out
the chair situation?

298
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:28,131
What? What about the chairs?

299
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:30,590
The chairs? I
made 3 calls--

300
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,134
What? 3 calls?

301
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:35,636
But I can't stop thinking
about how much I love you.

302
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:38,639
Well, you should. Well, I do.

303
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,140
What are you doing?

304
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,641
Oh, just a bit of organizing.

305
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:44,101
Are you nesting?

306
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:46,102
Yeah, I'm nesting.

307
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:48,645
Go have some fun.

308
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:50,106
Not too much, ok?

309
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:51,648
Ok, I'm going to go
have fun with my friends,

310
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:53,107
But not too much.

311
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:02,615
And you know in your heart

312
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:04,157
That it is just
a matter of time--

313
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,160
All day, bullets flying,
babies are getting shot.

314
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,620
If I'm the king
of Israel, right--

315
00:12:09,953 --> 00:12:10,745
Israel does not have a king.

316
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,122
What the hell do they have?

317
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:14,123
They have a president--
President yahoo.

318
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:17,126
Ok, I'd say to myself, "yahoo"...

319
00:12:17,126 --> 00:12:18,127
Hee hee hee.

320
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,252
"Take a look at the map." Yeah?

321
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:20,670
"Look what's all around you.

322
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,631
"People who are wishing
horrible, bad, bad things

323
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:25,173
For you and your people."

324
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:28,593
The buck's going to
stop right here, buddy.

325
00:12:28,593 --> 00:12:30,594
Not going to happen with me.

326
00:12:30,677 --> 00:12:33,095
My kid don't know the 6
fucking new England states,

327
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:34,597
He has trouble with geography,

328
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:37,599
I'm not going to stick
that shit in his face.

329
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:39,101
I'm going to help the
little guy, you know?

330
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:40,101
That's right.

331
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:41,602
Put him in the car.

332
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,103
Take him to maine for
the lobster dinner.

333
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,105
That's how you teach a
kid. Go skiing in vermont.

334
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:46,606
That's it. Take him skiing!

335
00:12:46,606 --> 00:12:48,190
Or Yankee stadium for a hot dog.

336
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,191
That's the way.
You got to--

337
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:51,693
I'm just saying, it's not--
You don't stare him down.

338
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:52,694
No, don't stare him down.

339
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:53,695
I'm not going to do it!

340
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:56,697
Do not... eyeball your kids.

341
00:12:56,697 --> 00:12:58,198
That's my point exactly!

342
00:12:58,198 --> 00:12:59,199
What? What is your point?

343
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:00,700
Take Mexico!

344
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,702
Think about it. The
mexicans would love it.

345
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:04,161
They're dying for a
little order down there.

346
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:06,162
First of all, you get what I'm saying.

347
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:07,164
You know exactly what I'm saying.

348
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:10,165
Let the Israelis work it out!

349
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,168
They kind of all look alike!

350
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,711
The jews and the Mexicans!

351
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,214
So I think, on a whole,
your average joe mexican's

352
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,173
Going to have less of a
problem getting his head around

353
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:22,216
The whole fucking
assimilation thing! Am I right?

354
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:25,677
Yeah!

355
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:27,220
I mean, I
tell mine--

356
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:29,680
I tell mine they're little men.

357
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,182
I tell them that they're strong,

358
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:34,684
That they make me feel joy.

359
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:36,727
I let them know, man.
I mean, I really--

360
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:40,188
I really let them know
that they are just--

361
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:42,190
Just as important.
They mean just as much.

362
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,190
You know what I'm saying? Mm-Hmm. Yes.

363
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,191
Just as much, man. Yes, yes.

364
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,693
And you're their godfather.

365
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:47,694
I know, and I'm honored.

366
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,195
No, no, no, no, no.

367
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:50,445
No? I'm not.

368
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,197
No, no, you're the godfather,

369
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:54,198
But I'm saying--
What I'm saying is,

370
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,658
If anything ever
happens to me--

371
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:58,702
Oh, brother,
don't even--Yeah.

372
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:00,703
Don't worry about it.

373
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,706
Becausethatis the point here, ok?

374
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:06,207
That is what I'm driving for.

375
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:09,210
Because, man, when the big storm comes

376
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,711
And all the forests are knocked down

377
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,672
And all the rocks have fallen away

378
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:16,215
And--And the
leaves are bare,

379
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:17,716
What's left?

380
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:20,719
What is left?

381
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:24,221
The little trees.

382
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:29,183
The little fellas that
the storm didn't see.

383
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:32,727
The tiny, little fellas.
That's where it's--

384
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:35,729
The stripper's here.

385
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:42,694
Excellent.

386
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:44,778
Gentlemen,

387
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,281
This...is tina.

388
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,782
Hey, boys.

389
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:51,283
Hi.

390
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,375
Fish!

391
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,877
She's all yours, buddy.

392
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:03,379
Anything you want, man, bought and paid.

393
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,879
Whoo!

394
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,882
I can't do it. I can't do it.

395
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,883
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

396
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:31,983
I'll take a ride.

397
00:16:58,003 --> 00:16:59,004
I didn't jump the gun, did i?

398
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:01,006
I feel the vibe. I feel
the vibe a little bit.

399
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:02,507
I'm Michael.

400
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:07,552
Did I do ok out there?

401
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:08,344
Yeah, you kidding?

402
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:10,512
I'm just in Vegas
gambling, spending money.

403
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:11,513
You're so beautiful.

404
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:12,014
Did you win anything?

405
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:13,515
Look at this.

406
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,516
Not what you thought, huh?

407
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:23,523
Woo! Ha! Ha!

408
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:24,523
Woo!

409
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:27,859
Got an awful big hit.

410
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:31,528
Ok, you do know it's 500 right?

411
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:33,529
Yeah, over there, no problem,

412
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,532
But yeah, 500 of my dollars?

413
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:36,532
Right.

414
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:38,033
But I thought--
Boyd didn't pay?

415
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:39,492
No, Boyd didn't pay. It's 500.

416
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:41,036
Straight sex, nothing kinky.

417
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,495
No, no, I'm not going to use
you as a hand puppet or anything.

418
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,038
I just want to make sweet love to you

419
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,249
Because you have no idea
what you've gotten into.

420
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,011
Oh, yeah!

421
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:04,512
Trying to get his legs
up, so he can try to--

422
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:06,513
See, you didn't think it
would be like this, did you?

423
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:08,515
You thought I was some punk, didn't you.

424
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:10,057
You thought I was a little punk.

425
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:11,517
Pumped up! Pumped up!

426
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:19,023
Good boy.

427
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:21,524
This isn't work, is it? Not work.

428
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:26,028
Look at the jump he did,

429
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:27,570
Sticking it in there.

430
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:33,033
Take it!

431
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,242
Take it! Take it!

432
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:39,287
Easy, baby.

433
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,583
Aah!

434
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:15,607
Cool. Ha ha!

435
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:22,070
You fucking maniac!

436
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,119
You...

437
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:53,636
I fucked up.

438
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:06,603
Oh, my god!

439
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:09,730
Oh!

440
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,607
Jesus christ!

441
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:13,108
Don't touch her! Don't touch her!

442
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:14,609
Call
9-1-1!

443
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:16,111
Don't move.

444
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:19,112
We were playing. We were playing.

445
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:20,113
I think she's dead.

446
00:20:20,113 --> 00:20:21,615
How do you know she's dead?

447
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:23,574
She's got no fucking pulse!

448
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,117
Listen, you don't know
what the hell you're doing.

449
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:27,619
Just get back.

450
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:29,120
All right, where do you
look? What side of the neck?

451
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,121
Left, left, left side.

452
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:31,663
Either side, you idiot!

453
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,666
I'm calling
9-1-1.

454
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,668
We were playing, and
she bumped her head.

455
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:39,128
Bumped?! Bumped?!

456
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:41,129
She's got a fucking spike in her head!

457
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:42,130
Adam, wait! What?

458
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,132
What are you doing?

459
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:45,132
What do you think you're doing?

460
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:46,175
I'm calling the ambulance!

461
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:48,176
Just wait one--
Wait one second. Ok?

462
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:49,136
Michael? Michael?

463
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:50,636
I'll take it out.

464
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:51,595
I can take it out.

465
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:53,638
What the fuck have you done?!

466
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:55,640
Why are you calling an
ambulance? She's dead.

467
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,600
I'm sorry. Sorry.

468
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,976
Oh, god, just call the police. No.

469
00:20:58,976 --> 00:21:00,143
Just call
9-1-1.

470
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:01,144
I slipped.

471
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:03,146
What did you do, goddamn it?

472
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:03,896
Nothing.

473
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:05,689
What the fuck did you
do, you little shit?!

474
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:06,649
Get out of here!

475
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,691
All right, all right, just calm down.

476
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:10,109
It was an accident!

477
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:12,653
Everybody just get a hold
of themselves, all right?

478
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:15,071
You are a lying deviant!

479
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:16,113
It was an accident!

480
00:21:16,113 --> 00:21:17,615
Are you sure--
Yes, I'm sure!

481
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:18,616
What were you doing?

482
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:20,617
The floor was wet, and so I slipped.

483
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:22,118
Why was the floor wet?!

484
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:23,620
I don't know.

485
00:21:23,828 --> 00:21:24,620
Why, goddamn it?!

486
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,621
Why, you little fucking pervert?!

487
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,582
Come on, damn it, take it easy.

488
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:30,166
You don't fucking know!

489
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,125
Calm down.

490
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,044
We're not helping anything
by losing our temper.

491
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,588
Let's just get our heads together. Ok?

492
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,633
Whatever we associate in our nervous
system determines our behavior.

493
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,303
You fucking guys. You fucking
guys. You fucking guys.

494
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,138
You fucking guys!

495
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:50,097
Now let's just take a second here,

496
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,141
And take a hold of the
situation and review our options.

497
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:54,017
We call the police!

498
00:21:54,017 --> 00:21:55,143
Ok, call the police,

499
00:21:55,143 --> 00:21:56,144
That's good. That's one option.

500
00:21:56,144 --> 00:21:57,145
That is not an option!

501
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:58,646
This is not multiple choice here.

502
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:00,105
Yes, it is!

503
00:22:00,105 --> 00:22:01,105
There are always options, Adam.

504
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:02,107
You fucking guys!

505
00:22:02,107 --> 00:22:03,650
We can definitely call the police.

506
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,109
That's an easy call.

507
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:07,653
Now, if we call the
police, what happens?

508
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,154
They come up here,

509
00:22:09,154 --> 00:22:10,613
They find a dead
prostitute in the bathroom,

510
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,657
And then they ask us what happened.

511
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,616
What the hell are you
going to tell them?

512
00:22:13,616 --> 00:22:15,617
You had nothing to do with it?

513
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:17,618
You didn't know she was a prostitute?

514
00:22:17,618 --> 00:22:19,161
I mean, that it was all Michael here?

515
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:20,621
Your brother, by the way.

516
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:23,622
You don't mess around with a homicide...

517
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,666
What about the alcohol, narcotics...

518
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,126
Don't tell me there are no options.

519
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:29,669
There are always fucking options.

520
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:31,129
What is the choice? What options?

521
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:40,135
We can bury her out in the desert.

522
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:42,137
Oh, sure, why not?

523
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:44,138
No, no, he's right, he's right.

524
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:45,639
He's right. He's right.

525
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:47,182
We could take her up to red rock.

526
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,642
Find some nice quiet place

527
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:50,184
And just put her in the ground.

528
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,186
We can do this. We can
get her out of here.

529
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:54,187
Have you lost your fucking mind?

530
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:55,647
Nobody knows she's here.

531
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:58,149
I called her personally. Nobody knows.

532
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:01,151
Her blood is all over the bathroom.

533
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:03,153
Don't you think we got a little
bit of a dna problem here?

534
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:05,154
It's a marble floor. We can clean it up.

535
00:23:05,154 --> 00:23:07,155
They've got us on
accessory to murder, Adam.

536
00:23:07,155 --> 00:23:09,658
It's not accessory,
ok? I didn't do shit.

537
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:11,158
That's not the point, Adam.

538
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,660
I mean, the room is covered with blow,

539
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:16,162
Moore looks like he went at it
with a fucking mountain lion.

540
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:19,164
I mean, the room looks like the
manson family stayed here a month.

541
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:22,125
This is a major thin-Ice
situation we got here.

542
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,668
I'm getting married, guys.

543
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:27,671
I have got a wife, and I've
got two boys, ok? Don't tell me.

544
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:31,674
Let's just take a vote, a simple vote.

545
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:33,675
We got two choices:

546
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:36,178
One, we clean up this mess right now,

547
00:23:36,178 --> 00:23:38,179
Bury it out in the desert,

548
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:39,638
Go home, and never look back.

549
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:42,641
Or, we can easily call the police,

550
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:45,226
Roll the dice, take our chances,

551
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:48,729
And pray to god that it's
only Michael who falls.

552
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:52,147
The choices are simple:
it's desert or police.

553
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,735
Desert.

554
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:02,739
The fucking desert.

555
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,157
Uh-Uh.

556
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:05,241
Fish,

557
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:09,911
I owe you, bro. I owe you, man.

558
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:14,247
Desert.

559
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,252
Nobody knows she's here.

560
00:24:20,753 --> 00:24:24,088
Oh, god... oh, god.

561
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:36,430
How do we get her out of here?

562
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:44,270
We can wrap her up in blankets,

563
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,272
Bring the car around to
the back of the hotel,

564
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:49,274
Lower her gently down off the balcony,

565
00:24:49,274 --> 00:24:51,275
Put her in the car. We're done.

566
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:53,276
Jesus christ, have you done this before?

567
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,281
The reality is, you take away
the horror of the situation,

568
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:01,283
Take away the tragedy of the death,

569
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:04,285
Take away the moral
and ethical implications

570
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:07,287
Of all the crap that you've
had conditioned and beaten

571
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:09,289
Into your head since grade one,

572
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:10,789
What are we left with?

573
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:12,291
What?

574
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,251
It's a 105-Pound problem.

575
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:19,755
105 pounds that's got to be
moved from point "a" to point "b."

576
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:23,800
Now, a straight line is the
shortest distance between two points,

577
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,760
But we're denied the luxury
of a visible straight line,

578
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,304
But that line exists, and I see it.

579
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:30,722
I see that line.

580
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:34,308
Trust me.

581
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:35,767
Adam, trust me.

582
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:43,773
Hotel security. Could
you please open the door?

583
00:25:44,148 --> 00:25:45,274
Oh, fuck.

584
00:25:49,444 --> 00:25:52,279
Hello? Hotel security.

585
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,281
What do they want?

586
00:25:56,283 --> 00:25:58,242
Shit.

587
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:00,785
Oh, fuck.

588
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:02,079
They know.

589
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:03,079
Calm down.

590
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:04,247
Hello?

591
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,789
Goddamn it, they know!

592
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:06,791
Tell them right now!

593
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,292
Just keep your voice down.

594
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:12,295
They have cameras in the ceiling.

595
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:13,796
Shut up!

596
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:15,297
Shh-Shh.

597
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:18,299
We don't have time. Shut up. Shut up.

598
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:19,300
Shh.

599
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:22,760
He's gone.

600
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:27,306
He's gone.

601
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:35,145
Hello?

602
00:26:35,145 --> 00:26:36,646
Hotel security.

603
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:40,107
Hi, how are you?

604
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:42,109
Y'all didn't hear me knocking?

605
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:44,610
No, we heard you.

606
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:48,113
Mmm, yeah. You guys making
a lot of noise tonight.

607
00:26:48,113 --> 00:26:51,115
What is it, a toga party?

608
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:56,619
It's a bachelor party.

609
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:58,621
Well, y'all going to
have to keep it down.

610
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:02,624
Well, we will. We will.
We absolutely will.

611
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,626
Listen, we're very,
very sorry, we apologize.

612
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:06,168
We've been partying a little hard,

613
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,629
But we're all getting
ready to go to sleep.

614
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,674
Mmm-Mmm.

615
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,594
Well, this is going to be a problem.

616
00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:20,137
Someone's going to have to pay.

617
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:22,139
Yeah, we're going to take care of
that first thing in the morning.

618
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:23,139
Yeah, you will.

619
00:27:23,348 --> 00:27:26,142
What the hell gets into you people?

620
00:27:26,142 --> 00:27:28,143
Drugs and alcohol.

621
00:27:32,688 --> 00:27:34,147
Well, I got no problem with that.

622
00:27:35,648 --> 00:27:37,150
Dr. Bigbucks.

623
00:27:38,151 --> 00:27:39,652
Hey, how about a beer?

624
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:41,654
No. Maybe some other time.

625
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:44,155
Listen, we're very,
very sorry, we apologize.

626
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:45,656
We didn't mean any
disrespect to the hotel.

627
00:27:45,656 --> 00:27:47,158
We're very sorry.

628
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:49,117
Hey, hey, don't worry about
it. Don't worry about it at all.

629
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,160
Just as long as you keep it down.

630
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:54,663
What the fuck is that?

631
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:04,713
Sir, please, before you go in there,

632
00:28:04,713 --> 00:28:06,130
I just want to explain.

633
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,131
Can I talk to you one second, please?

634
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:10,133
D-D-Don't go
in there yet.

635
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:12,718
We were calling 9-1-1 right
when you came, I swear to god.

636
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:14,720
This is not what it looks like.

637
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,223
Go in there and put
your fucking pants on.

638
00:28:19,223 --> 00:28:21,225
I'm not going to put my pants back on.

639
00:28:21,225 --> 00:28:23,685
No, you get dressed.
Goddamn it, I'll handle this.

640
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:25,227
Just get back. Just get back.

641
00:28:25,227 --> 00:28:27,229
Everybody just
get-- Just move back.

642
00:28:27,229 --> 00:28:30,189
The floor was wet.
She completely slipped.

643
00:28:30,189 --> 00:28:33,192
Get me a phone. Just get me a telephone.

644
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:35,735
Back up, back up! He
wants us to back up.

645
00:28:36,194 --> 00:28:37,737
I want everybody just to move back.

646
00:28:37,737 --> 00:28:39,197
Just take your fucking hands off me!

647
00:28:46,076 --> 00:28:47,911
Clear a path!

648
00:28:52,248 --> 00:28:55,250
Don't let him bleed on the carpet!

649
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,252
Go on! Get out! Get out!

650
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,754
Shut the door!

651
00:29:01,755 --> 00:29:03,256
Come over here! Help me!

652
00:29:03,256 --> 00:29:04,757
Jesus! Oh, shit!

653
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:06,259
Son of a bitch!

654
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:09,260
He'll bleed out. He'll bleed out!

655
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,305
Oh, my god!

656
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:13,806
You motherfuckers!

657
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:16,308
All right, he'll bleed
out. He'll bleed out.

658
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:20,310
Oh, die!

659
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:32,821
Think
anybody--

660
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:35,322
Die!

661
00:29:35,822 --> 00:29:37,323
Die, you son of a bitch!

662
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:10,807
It's all right.

663
00:30:13,392 --> 00:30:14,810
Come on.

664
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:17,854
Come on.

665
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,361
Bingo.

666
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:45,375
New plan.

667
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:48,377
No, no,

668
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:49,336
Not so much of a new plan

669
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:50,879
As a modification on the old one.

670
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:51,880
I'm calling the police.

671
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:54,381
So help me god, you
touch that fucking phone,

672
00:30:54,381 --> 00:30:55,882
I'll bury you with them.

673
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:58,885
Surrender is no longer an option.

674
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:01,386
I repeat, it is not an option.

675
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:04,847
Is there anyone here who
does not understand that?

676
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:07,392
Little gut check time, fellas.

677
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,394
Time for some serious self-Exploration.

678
00:31:11,394 --> 00:31:12,895
How do I function?

679
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:15,897
For real, no more bullshit.

680
00:31:15,897 --> 00:31:19,901
Can I keep my cool when
they bounce my bananas,

681
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:24,196
When they won't play my
song, et cetera, et cetera?

682
00:31:24,905 --> 00:31:26,364
You get me?

683
00:31:26,781 --> 00:31:27,906
Do you get me?

684
00:31:28,073 --> 00:31:29,365
Not really, no.

685
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:31,868
That's not a problem.

686
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:36,371
Understand not my words,
but follow my orders.

687
00:31:36,872 --> 00:31:40,875
Follow my orders.

688
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:47,880
Let me be the success coach.

689
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:50,016
Wait a minute.

690
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:51,518
Wait a minute.

691
00:34:52,018 --> 00:34:53,019
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

692
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:54,520
What? We can't do this.

693
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,480
We've already done this.

694
00:34:57,022 --> 00:34:58,023
No, no, I mean the suitcases.

695
00:34:58,023 --> 00:35:00,024
We can't bury them like
this in the suitcases.

696
00:35:00,024 --> 00:35:02,026
Why not?

697
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:05,528
Because it's sacrilegious.

698
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:07,030
How do you figure?

699
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:09,990
According to jewish law,
the blood and the limbs

700
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:14,535
Are considered to be a sacred
part of the human spirit.

701
00:35:14,535 --> 00:35:18,997
The body has to be united, or
the soul can't rest in peace.

702
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:20,039
What the hell? That's what we're doing.

703
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,041
No, no, it's not. We got
their parts all mixed together.

704
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,043
We can't do this to them.

705
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:27,503
She's asian. They
don't have jews in asia.

706
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:29,045
That is absolutely not true.

707
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,840
Michael, do they have jews in asia?

708
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:33,507
Huh?

709
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,051
They have--
Yes, they do.

710
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,552
They have jews in asia. He is correct.

711
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,012
What the fuck are we supposed to do?

712
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,557
We're going to have to
open up the suitcases.

713
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:44,557
We're going to unpack the bodies

714
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:46,059
And reunite the appropriate limbs.

715
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:47,018
No fucking way!

716
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:48,310
That's what we're going to do!

717
00:35:48,602 --> 00:35:49,311
No fucking way!

718
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:50,145
We have to do this, goddamn it!

719
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:52,064
Adam, we got to get going.

720
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:53,481
The sun's coming up. Come on!

721
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:55,566
I am not flexible on this.

722
00:36:05,573 --> 00:36:07,616
Let's do it.

723
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:13,579
I've got her head.

724
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,582
This is her head.

725
00:36:16,582 --> 00:36:18,583
I got a combo situation.

726
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,085
Do you have any of him?

727
00:36:20,085 --> 00:36:22,086
I have--That's
her.

728
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:26,089
Watch your step, all right.

729
00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:27,590
Hey! Hey!

730
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:31,593
I've got a mop.

731
00:36:31,593 --> 00:36:33,594
Just open the fucking bags up!

732
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:34,595
Adam, heads up.

733
00:36:34,928 --> 00:36:36,597
Jesus christ!

734
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:38,598
Don't just toss it around, goddamn it!

735
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:40,599
Show a little fucking respect!

736
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:43,102
I have her lower leg.

737
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:46,103
Ok, I have his upper
leg and her lower leg.

738
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,106
I have his upper leg and her lower ,

739
00:36:48,564 --> 00:36:50,107
Leg and they don't go together!

740
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,566
How do we get started, Adam?

741
00:36:51,566 --> 00:36:53,568
Look, if you don't want to
do it, just sit the fuck down!

742
00:36:53,568 --> 00:36:56,195
Great fucking idea! Everybody's
losing their goddamned minds!

743
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,570
Is this her stuff here?

744
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,072
That's her! That's him!

745
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:00,073
All right, let's do this.

746
00:37:00,073 --> 00:37:03,616
All right, somebody get
his torso, find his torso.

747
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,077
Forget the head, we'll just start.

748
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:06,619
We got the head.

749
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:09,622
We'll start with black, then
we'll go to the asian, all right?

750
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:10,623
We're going to make you very happy.

751
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:12,082
Ok, you don't do nothing.

752
00:37:12,582 --> 00:37:13,583
I got toes!

753
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:14,583
Ok, relax.

754
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,919
I got toes. I have somebody's toes.

755
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:33,098
Ok?

756
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:40,103
All right.

757
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:00,118
Allow me to be the first to say

758
00:38:00,118 --> 00:38:04,621
That what we have done
here is not a good thing.

759
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:07,123
It's clearly not a good thing,

760
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:10,583
But it was, given the
circumstances, the smart play.

761
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:15,587
I'm proud of us.

762
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:21,633
I am proud of each and every one of us.

763
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:23,636
It's going to be ok.

764
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,099
We performed under the most complex

765
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,642
And nerve-Shattering of situations.

766
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:37,104
I mean, each one of us stood
fast, and we all delivered.

767
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:39,606
I feel proud.

768
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:42,608
We're going to hell...

769
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:46,152
Hell or prison, whichever comes first.

770
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:49,154
That's wrong. That is
flat-Out wrong, Adam.

771
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:51,615
You got to change your associations.

772
00:38:51,615 --> 00:38:54,116
Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites,

773
00:38:54,116 --> 00:38:58,620
For people who fear to live by the
strength of their own conviction.

774
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,121
Now, this is war!

775
00:39:00,663 --> 00:39:03,123
Given the circumstances
and given the fact

776
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:05,625
That we are alive and they are not,

777
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,627
We've all chosen life over death.

778
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:10,128
I mean, two wrongs don't make a right,

779
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:11,629
So our conviction and execution

780
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:13,631
Would only mean more
death here, not less.

781
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:15,132
I don't know, Boyd.

782
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:19,094
Just seems to me ever since you
started this personal growth,

783
00:39:19,594 --> 00:39:22,638
Self-Help, power fucking
dysfunctional fucking bullshit,

784
00:39:22,804 --> 00:39:25,140
You are all fucked up in the head!

785
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,641
Don't even go there.

786
00:39:27,141 --> 00:39:29,644
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about, all right?

787
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:32,145
Personal strength has
nothing to do with this.

788
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:35,148
True, it's helped me to unlock energies
and see my options more clearly,

789
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,608
But to give it credit for all of this

790
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,152
Is a little bit more than they deserve.

791
00:39:42,153 --> 00:39:46,615
Don't you think we ought to
say more words over the bodies?

792
00:39:47,657 --> 00:39:50,659
What kind of words?

793
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:53,495
Like a...a prayer.

794
00:39:55,954 --> 00:39:57,790
Go ahead.

795
00:40:06,462 --> 00:40:08,464
Dear god...

796
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:14,469
I don't fucking know how to pray.

797
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:16,011
Say what's on your mind.

798
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:17,971
Speak from the heart. Let it flow.

799
00:40:20,473 --> 00:40:21,974
Dear god...

800
00:40:24,477 --> 00:40:25,477
This is pathetic.

801
00:40:25,477 --> 00:40:26,519
You're pathetic.

802
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,521
What did you say?

803
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:29,938
You're not a team player.

804
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:30,981
Don't point at me.

805
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:31,982
You've never been a team player.

806
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:33,483
That's why you don't have any friends.

807
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:34,483
What are you talking
about? I have friends.

808
00:40:34,984 --> 00:40:35,985
The hell you do.

809
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:36,986
The hell I don't.

810
00:40:36,986 --> 00:40:38,487
You have acquaintances.

811
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:40,488
Business friends,
superficial golf buddies.

812
00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:41,489
You've always been a fringe player.

813
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,990
Don't point at me.

814
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,991
You have some serious
male-On-Male intimacy problems.

815
00:40:44,991 --> 00:40:45,992
What are you fucking talking about?

816
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:47,494
You can't deal with men!

817
00:40:47,827 --> 00:40:49,954
Guys, maybe now is
not the time for this.

818
00:40:49,954 --> 00:40:51,496
Come on, Fisher, this
is the perfect time.

819
00:40:51,955 --> 00:40:53,498
This is the real time.
We're in the moment.

820
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:56,000
Adam, your brother and myself

821
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,500
As well as several others present

822
00:40:58,002 --> 00:40:58,961
Have always felt that you were

823
00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:03,464
A fully repressed,
living-In-Major-Denial, lock-Down flyboy.

824
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:06,966
What?

825
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:09,469
Fire in the hole, big guy.

826
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,470
What?

827
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,932
Dear god, please forgive us for
what we've done here tonight.

828
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,474
We've lost our way.

829
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,976
Speaking for myself,

830
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:23,979
I am deeply in love with
the woman I'm about to marry,

831
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:27,440
And I am very much looking
forward to raising a family

832
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,441
And being a positive member of society.

833
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:31,444
We promise, if you forgive us,

834
00:41:31,986 --> 00:41:34,487
That we will never forget this tragedy

835
00:41:34,987 --> 00:41:36,989
And we will try with all our power

836
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,491
To use it as a daily reminder

837
00:41:39,991 --> 00:41:42,994
That we are on this earth
to do good, not evil.

838
00:41:43,494 --> 00:41:46,496
Let us move from this day forward
with new spirit and purpose.

839
00:41:46,996 --> 00:41:48,498
You have given us a second chance,

840
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:50,541
So let us take that second chance

841
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:52,542
And use it to fuel our
fires of productivity

842
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:56,504
So that the spirits of the two
people that we buried here tonight

843
00:41:56,504 --> 00:42:00,007
Can forever live on in our good
deeds and positive achievements

844
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:04,051
That we, from this day forward,
shall make our lives' work.

845
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:06,511
Thank you, god, and once again,

846
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:11,015
Please give us your guidance
and your forgiveness. Amen.

847
00:43:21,317 --> 00:43:22,318
Hello?

848
00:43:22,484 --> 00:43:23,778
It's me.

849
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,320
Hey!

850
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,780
I'm on the road. We're
running a little late.

851
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:29,782
Really? How late?

852
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:31,283
Um...like an hour.

853
00:43:31,283 --> 00:43:33,868
Honey, did you check on the chairs?

854
00:43:34,202 --> 00:43:34,869
What?

855
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:37,287
Did you check on the chairs? Ok.

856
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:39,330
Ok what? What?

857
00:43:39,372 --> 00:43:40,790
What. Yeah. What about the chairs?

858
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:43,292
I left a message.
Everything's going to be ok.

859
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:45,836
Yeah? You sound a little funny, honey.

860
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:47,837
Did you do the cocaine last night?

861
00:43:48,296 --> 00:43:49,338
Um...nope.

862
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:52,841
I'm gonna be home in,
like, 4 hours, ok, hon?

863
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:54,842
Did you have fun?

864
00:43:55,176 --> 00:43:56,344
Was it fun, honey?

865
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:58,845
You think he had kids?

866
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,346
What?

867
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:01,347
Children.

868
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:04,850
Do you think that man was a father?

869
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,809
I don't know.

870
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:08,811
I got a really bad feeling...

871
00:44:09,353 --> 00:44:11,355
That he had children.

872
00:44:11,355 --> 00:44:15,358
I don't know. I think he was
too young to have children.

873
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,861
We're gonna burn for this.

874
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,833
Come on, guys. Daddy's
home. Let's go. Adam jr.

875
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,834
Where did you go, dad?

876
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:42,378
Today is the beginning
of the rest of our lives.

877
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:43,838
Hi, daddy!

878
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:45,839
Oh...

879
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,841
Honey! Honey, we have to go.

880
00:44:48,049 --> 00:44:49,842
My soccer game's today.

881
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,843
You were gonna drive me
and my friends. You have to.

882
00:44:52,136 --> 00:44:53,887
Nobody says anything to anybody...ever.

883
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:54,887
We're late.

884
00:44:54,887 --> 00:44:56,347
Right?

885
00:44:56,638 --> 00:44:58,099
Let's go.

886
00:44:59,891 --> 00:45:01,892
The idea is to be able
to, like, look at everybody

887
00:45:01,892 --> 00:45:03,853
And know that they're all
in the same wedding, right?

888
00:45:03,853 --> 00:45:06,354
I mean, I just want to make sure
that everything's sort of pressed.

889
00:45:06,354 --> 00:45:08,857
I don't want to look like it's been
hanging on a hanger all the time.

890
00:45:08,857 --> 00:45:10,858
I want everything to be, like...

891
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:13,401
I just want them to all look like
they're just... you know, clean.

892
00:45:13,401 --> 00:45:15,403
Here, let me...

893
00:45:15,403 --> 00:45:19,364
Let me help-- I'll help you
with that. Your nails are filthy.

894
00:45:19,364 --> 00:45:21,866
I don't care-- Like,
just for the day,

895
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:24,368
All I ask is that
they're clean for the day.

896
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:26,870
After that, I don't
care what happens, ok?

897
00:45:26,953 --> 00:45:27,829
Ok.

898
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:28,871
Hi, Boyd. Hey.

899
00:45:29,205 --> 00:45:32,374
Ok, um, basically... are
you gonna stand like this?

900
00:45:32,374 --> 00:45:36,377
I'll stand any way you
would like me to stand.

901
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:39,379
Michael...

902
00:45:39,796 --> 00:45:41,380
Mike--What is--
What happened here?

903
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:44,883
He gave me a collar center
because I have an irregular size.

904
00:45:44,883 --> 00:45:45,884
An
irreg--

905
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:48,845
I'm in between sizes.
My neck is wide, and...

906
00:45:48,928 --> 00:45:50,346
This looks like it hurts. It does.

907
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:51,888
Does it hurt? Yeah. I
can't really breathe.

908
00:45:51,888 --> 00:45:54,391
Is this your shirt? Did you
bring this, or is this theirs?

909
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:57,768
It's theirs. Ok, well, this
is just totally unacceptable.

910
00:45:57,768 --> 00:45:59,853
How are you feeling? Put your arms down.

911
00:45:59,853 --> 00:46:03,605
If you can just take it in on the sides
right here... right here. Right here.

912
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:11,862
He's got two kids, goddamn
it, just like I said!

913
00:46:11,862 --> 00:46:13,363
Two fucking kids, goddamn it!

914
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:18,367
Calm the fuck down! Let's move
on past the fucking blaming shit.

915
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,909
Ok, now, where'd you get this?

916
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:21,912
At the newsstand on third.

917
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,913
Fucking Boyd, that fucking idiot!

918
00:46:23,913 --> 00:46:26,874
Goddamn it, they're onto
us! They're not onto us.

919
00:46:30,376 --> 00:46:32,420
Boyd, did you read the paper?

920
00:46:32,795 --> 00:46:33,879
Is that him? Is that him? Give me that!

921
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:35,421
Goddamn it, calm down.

922
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:38,883
Boyd, you fucking idiot!
This shit is coming down, man!

923
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:40,383
That's just nothing.

924
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,885
That's just a stupid missing
persons thing, that's all.

925
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,053
You got us into this mess!

926
00:46:44,387 --> 00:46:45,888
I did? From what I remember,

927
00:46:45,888 --> 00:46:47,889
It was your rat-Fuck brother
that decided to play chop suey

928
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,891
With the hooker's fucking head.

929
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,392
Will you shut up?! Calm down.

930
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,601
Shut up! These fucking phones
aren't secure, goddamn it!

931
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:56,396
Just lighten up, would you,
please, Adam? All right?

932
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,897
Just show some character.
Walk through some fucking fear.

933
00:46:59,356 --> 00:47:00,399
Don't talk to me about character, pal.

934
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:02,400
Watch the tone, fella, ok?

935
00:47:02,525 --> 00:47:03,401
Fuck you, Boyd! Give me the phone.

936
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:06,403
Fuck you, too, snake-Eyes, cocksucker!

937
00:47:06,403 --> 00:47:07,904
Fuck you! Shut up. Boyd?

938
00:47:07,904 --> 00:47:09,905
They have my credit card
imprint, you know that?

939
00:47:09,905 --> 00:47:11,407
He hung up, goddamn it!

940
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:13,408
Fucking asshole!

941
00:47:13,492 --> 00:47:14,909
Fucking...

942
00:47:14,909 --> 00:47:17,995
Look what you did, goddamn
it! Look what you did!

943
00:47:18,245 --> 00:47:21,497
Refocus...your mind!

944
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:26,001
Control... your...fear!

945
00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:34,508
Knock it off!

946
00:47:35,008 --> 00:47:36,509
Hey, don't snap at them.

947
00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:37,509
They're making me nuts!

948
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,011
No, they're singing.

949
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:40,512
It's a disgusting song.

950
00:47:40,512 --> 00:47:42,013
Well, you taught it to them.

951
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,433
Guys! Guys, be quiet.

952
00:47:45,433 --> 00:47:49,435
Your daddy's in a really, really
bad mood, and if you're really good,

953
00:47:49,852 --> 00:47:51,937
You're gonna get some
whizzers-- I promise.

954
00:47:52,021 --> 00:47:53,438
Whizzers!

955
00:47:53,522 --> 00:47:56,066
We want whizzers! We want whizzers!

956
00:47:56,066 --> 00:47:59,067
Ok? Ok, yeah. High-Five. All right.

957
00:47:59,526 --> 00:48:01,570
We want whizzers! We want whizzers!

958
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,571
We want whizzers!

959
00:48:03,946 --> 00:48:06,573
We want whizzers! Whizzers! Whizzers!

960
00:48:06,573 --> 00:48:09,575
Whizzers! Whizzers! Whizzers! Whizzers!

961
00:48:09,575 --> 00:48:13,579
Whizzers! Whizzers! Whizzers! Whizzers!

962
00:48:13,579 --> 00:48:15,538
Whizzers! Whizzers!

963
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:17,081
Whizzers! Whizzers!

964
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:20,083
Whizzers! Whizzers! Whizzers!

965
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:23,586
We want whizzers! We want whizzers!

966
00:48:23,795 --> 00:48:25,588
We want whizzers!

967
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:42,600
Hey, how do you like the minivan?

968
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:45,602
We want whizzers! We want whizzers!

969
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,062
We want whizzers!

970
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:50,606
We want whizzers! We want whizzers!

971
00:48:50,856 --> 00:48:52,608
We want whizzers!

972
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,109
So, how do you like your minivan?

973
00:48:55,193 --> 00:48:56,110
Fine.

974
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,112
Whizzers!

975
00:48:57,403 --> 00:48:59,113
We want whizzers!

976
00:49:02,114 --> 00:49:05,117
No, no, honey. Honey, go in
there and get them some whizzers.

977
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:07,118
What? They're screaming for whizzers.

978
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:09,579
Just go in there and get some whizzers.

979
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,122
I'm not going in there.

980
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:13,623
They are screaming like monsters.
It's giving me a headache.

981
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:16,626
I used the credit card so
I don't have to go in there!

982
00:49:16,626 --> 00:49:18,085
Go get them some fucking whizzers!

983
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:19,628
Whizzers! Whizzers! Whizzers!

984
00:49:19,754 --> 00:49:21,088
Whizzers! Whizzers!

985
00:49:21,088 --> 00:49:24,089
Thank you. Go. Please. Whizzers.

986
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:25,591
We want whizzers!

987
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:27,092
Love you!

988
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,600
Fucking whizzers!

989
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,105
Excuse me.

990
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:49,109
Yeah. Sure.
No--No problem.

991
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,110
Aah! Oh! Aah!

992
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,112
Ooh! Aah! Jeez!

993
00:49:54,613 --> 00:49:56,614
I'm sorry.
I--I got it.

994
00:49:56,614 --> 00:49:58,616
I got it. Sorry! I'm sorry.

995
00:49:58,616 --> 00:50:00,117
Just leave it.

996
00:50:00,325 --> 00:50:02,618
Leave it and get out.

997
00:50:02,618 --> 00:50:03,619
I'm--I'm
sorry.

998
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,121
Officer: buddy, you ok?

999
00:50:05,246 --> 00:50:06,121
Hey--Whoa!

1000
00:50:06,121 --> 00:50:09,624
What the hell is wrong with you?

1001
00:50:09,624 --> 00:50:11,626
Just get out!

1002
00:50:11,626 --> 00:50:12,626
Yay!

1003
00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:15,129
Dad's got the whizzers!
Dad's got the whizzers!

1004
00:50:15,129 --> 00:50:18,130
Dad's got the whizzers!
Dad's got the whizzers!

1005
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:19,631
Here he comes!

1006
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:21,133
Where are the whizzers?

1007
00:50:21,133 --> 00:50:23,134
They didn't have any whizzers.

1008
00:50:23,134 --> 00:50:25,135
What do you mean, they
don't have any whizzers?

1009
00:50:25,135 --> 00:50:27,137
They didn't have any
fucking whizzers, ok?!

1010
00:50:27,137 --> 00:50:28,138
What are you doing?!

1011
00:50:28,555 --> 00:50:30,598
What is your problem?! What
is your goddamn problem?

1012
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:31,724
Aah!

1013
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,642
Dad!

1014
00:50:38,104 --> 00:50:39,647
Oh, oh...

1015
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,650
Nice to see you.

1016
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,109
Oh, my god!

1017
00:50:46,652 --> 00:50:48,612
You look so beautiful!
I love that dress.

1018
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:51,113
Oh, my god... have you seen
amanda? Oh, my god, come here.

1019
00:50:51,113 --> 00:50:54,158
She's wearing the same exact
dress she wore to heidi's wedding.

1020
00:50:54,158 --> 00:50:55,158
I'm losing it, fish.

1021
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:57,160
Hey, now--
How's it going?

1022
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,620
Nice to see you. Nice to see you.

1023
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,122
I got a migraine like a fucking
monkey kicking in the side of my--

1024
00:51:02,122 --> 00:51:05,124
I get you, I get you. Hi.
Hi, cynthia. Nice to see you.

1025
00:51:05,124 --> 00:51:06,625
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Wilshire.

1026
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:07,626
Fish.
Fish--

1027
00:51:07,626 --> 00:51:09,627
I'm sorry, I'm not myself.

1028
00:51:09,627 --> 00:51:11,129
Just, please, not now.

1029
00:51:11,129 --> 00:51:12,630
Where's the bathroom?

1030
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,131
It's just past-- Where's
the fucking bathroom?!

1031
00:51:14,131 --> 00:51:15,631
It's past the bar! Excuse me.

1032
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:22,679
Here's a picture of Kyle, age 4,

1033
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:26,181
And his good friend, jo-Jo the mule.

1034
00:51:27,182 --> 00:51:28,684
Now...

1035
00:51:28,975 --> 00:51:31,685
Evidently, when they got to camp,

1036
00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:35,188
Kyle and Boyd over there
had some serious arguments.

1037
00:51:35,563 --> 00:51:36,689
Try and get me in the mouth.

1038
00:51:36,689 --> 00:51:37,690
Shh.

1039
00:51:38,107 --> 00:51:40,192
Who exactly was Kyle's best friend,

1040
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:42,193
Boyd or the mule?

1041
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,196
Well, fish had a less
than normal relationship

1042
00:51:45,488 --> 00:51:46,655
With that ass.

1043
00:51:48,156 --> 00:51:50,658
You're just jealous, Boyd.

1044
00:51:50,658 --> 00:51:53,202
Well, be that as it may,

1045
00:51:53,452 --> 00:51:56,204
After camp came football,

1046
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:58,164
And for those of you

1047
00:51:58,164 --> 00:52:01,625
Who didn't follow the
sports pages back in 1977,

1048
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:05,127
You might not remember the
peewee powerhouse of oklahoma,

1049
00:52:05,127 --> 00:52:08,213
Who, under the
leadership of yours truly,

1050
00:52:08,797 --> 00:52:13,217
Managed to roll to an auspicious
league record of 0 for 12...

1051
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:18,763
Scoring exactly not one damn touchdown.

1052
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,434
Where are you going?

1053
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:25,976
Oh...ho ho!

1054
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,979
He was a husky kid then,
and he's a husky kid now...

1055
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,272
Whose great talent was persistence.

1056
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,981
They showed up.

1057
00:52:34,441 --> 00:52:37,943
They didn't score much.
They didn't score at all.

1058
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:39,946
Ha ha! But they showed up.

1059
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:44,448
So...now I'd like to propose my toast...

1060
00:52:44,448 --> 00:52:48,910
To the groom and... his wonderful bride.

1061
00:52:49,702 --> 00:52:50,954
God bless.

1062
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:51,954
God bless.

1063
00:52:51,954 --> 00:52:53,455
God bless.

1064
00:52:54,956 --> 00:52:56,958
Adam, what's wrong, man?

1065
00:52:58,459 --> 00:53:00,460
I can't-- I can't
fucking breathe.

1066
00:53:00,961 --> 00:53:01,919
What's wrong?

1067
00:53:01,919 --> 00:53:03,463
Fish, I'm sorry. Ok!

1068
00:53:03,463 --> 00:53:04,922
You're freaking me out, brother.

1069
00:53:04,922 --> 00:53:06,965
That was definitely not
cool--Definitely inappropriate behavior.

1070
00:53:07,465 --> 00:53:08,467
Just shut up for a second.

1071
00:53:08,967 --> 00:53:10,468
Negative! This is not
what you've worked out

1072
00:53:10,468 --> 00:53:11,969
In terms of self-Management here, Adam.

1073
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:13,471
Come on! Pull it together.

1074
00:53:13,471 --> 00:53:14,972
He's having some kind of problem?

1075
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:16,472
What's the problem, Adam?

1076
00:53:16,472 --> 00:53:18,975
What is the fucking problem, huh?

1077
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,476
Come on.

1078
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,977
I just--I just--
We're gonna get caught.

1079
00:53:22,977 --> 00:53:24,479
We're not gonna get caught.

1080
00:53:24,479 --> 00:53:25,980
I know we're gonna get caught.

1081
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,481
They're eyeballing my minivan.

1082
00:53:27,481 --> 00:53:28,982
Who? What?

1083
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:30,525
At the minimart.

1084
00:53:30,525 --> 00:53:32,526
What the hell are you talking about?

1085
00:53:32,526 --> 00:53:33,985
They're smoking me out!
Who's smoking you out?

1086
00:53:33,985 --> 00:53:35,988
Nobody is smoking you out!

1087
00:53:35,988 --> 00:53:36,988
Shut up!

1088
00:53:36,988 --> 00:53:37,989
Kyle!

1089
00:53:37,989 --> 00:53:39,531
Yeah? What, hon?

1090
00:53:39,531 --> 00:53:40,532
Honey... yeah?

1091
00:53:40,532 --> 00:53:41,992
Is everything ok?

1092
00:53:41,992 --> 00:53:43,493
Yeah, everything's fine. Great.

1093
00:53:43,993 --> 00:53:46,495
Ok. Can we go back inside?

1094
00:53:46,495 --> 00:53:48,038
Yeah. Sure.

1095
00:53:48,038 --> 00:53:51,498
Honey,now.Now. Can we go inside?

1096
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:53,501
I just have these...
um, we have these...

1097
00:53:53,501 --> 00:53:56,002
Yeah, we got, uh... groomsmen's
last-Minute preparations to make.

1098
00:53:56,002 --> 00:53:58,505
We've got a rehearsal
dinner going on inside.

1099
00:53:58,505 --> 00:54:00,005
Dad, everything's fine, ok?

1100
00:54:00,005 --> 00:54:02,007
I'm in the middle of my
goddamn toast in there!

1101
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:04,009
Why don't the two of you go back inside,

1102
00:54:04,009 --> 00:54:06,010
You get back into the toast,
and I'll be back in, ok?

1103
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,552
So just go on, please.

1104
00:54:07,552 --> 00:54:10,013
Honey, we have a
rehearsal dinner here, ok?

1105
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,014
Everything's beautiful.
Your wife looks beautiful,

1106
00:54:12,014 --> 00:54:14,015
Except for what you
did to her fucking nose.

1107
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,518
Adam, the timing fucking
sucks on this here.

1108
00:54:16,518 --> 00:54:18,519
We got the rehearsal
dinner thing right now.

1109
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:20,521
You never gave a damn
about anyone but yourself.

1110
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:22,022
You're a fucking reject, ok?

1111
00:54:22,022 --> 00:54:23,523
You eat my ass!

1112
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:24,523
Hey! Eat my ass!

1113
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:25,984
This doesn't help!

1114
00:54:25,984 --> 00:54:28,527
If youevertouch my minivan again,

1115
00:54:28,527 --> 00:54:30,528
You are going to be very sorry, brother!

1116
00:54:31,028 --> 00:54:32,030
Very fucking sorry!

1117
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,531
You are aloser! Loser?!

1118
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:37,034
Loser! You're a-- You think
your shit's so fucking righteous?

1119
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:39,368
You were right there, right there
with us-- Side by fucking side.

1120
00:54:39,368 --> 00:54:41,494
You murdered that girl!

1121
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:44,039
You murdered her! You're
a murderer! Murderer!

1122
00:54:44,497 --> 00:54:46,040
Keep it fucking down!
Keep your fucking voice--

1123
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,541
Shut your fucking mouth.

1124
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:49,543
I didn't do anything, ok? Yes, you did.

1125
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:51,544
I might just turn your
little pathetic ass in.

1126
00:54:51,544 --> 00:54:53,003
How about that, pal?

1127
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:54,005
Did you hear that?

1128
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:55,547
Adam, calm down, ok?

1129
00:54:56,006 --> 00:54:58,007
I'm not gonna calm
down! I can't do this!

1130
00:54:58,007 --> 00:55:00,009
I can't do this! I'm
telling you, they--

1131
00:55:00,009 --> 00:55:02,010
It won't work! It cannot work!

1132
00:55:02,385 --> 00:55:04,011
Ithasworked! Itisworking!

1133
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:05,180
It's done!

1134
00:55:05,513 --> 00:55:07,514
I'm telling you,
they've got fiber optics,

1135
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:08,515
They've got dna samples,

1136
00:55:09,057 --> 00:55:10,517
They've got
fbi scientists--

1137
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:13,519
The fucking internet, goddamn it!

1138
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,063
They figure this shit out! They
figure it out every fucking time!

1139
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:20,023
They won't figure it out.
You've just got to relax.

1140
00:55:20,023 --> 00:55:22,526
I've got children. I've got a life!

1141
00:55:22,526 --> 00:55:24,527
Your kids are one crutch
away from a telethon.

1142
00:55:24,527 --> 00:55:26,028
You got a frigid,
swamp-Hog wife--

1143
00:55:26,486 --> 00:55:27,571
You fuck!

1144
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:30,031
Kyle! What is going on?!

1145
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:32,575
Jesus! What is-- Are
they fighting over there?

1146
00:55:32,575 --> 00:55:35,535
No, baby-- Baby, they
are fighting over there!

1147
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:38,037
Now, what the
fuck is--Aah! Aah!

1148
00:55:38,037 --> 00:55:40,039
Back off, Michael! That's enough!

1149
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:41,540
Goddamn it, back off!

1150
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,041
You are not going to ruin this for us!

1151
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:45,043
You will not ruin it for us!

1152
00:55:45,043 --> 00:55:47,044
This is gonna stop. You fucking go home!

1153
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:48,044
You fucking murderer!

1154
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:49,546
Back off! He's gone!

1155
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,547
You're a fucking loser! You're a loser!

1156
00:55:51,547 --> 00:55:53,048
You need to take a time-Out.

1157
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,551
Go home! Go home, you fucking murderer!

1158
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:56,551
Fucking loser!

1159
00:55:56,968 --> 00:55:58,552
Go home, you fucking murderer!

1160
00:55:58,552 --> 00:56:01,513
Easy, easy! We got to go
back in. We got to go back in.

1161
00:56:01,513 --> 00:56:03,515
The problem is gone, ok? Time out.

1162
00:56:04,057 --> 00:56:06,059
Oh, fuck. We got to get in there.

1163
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:08,560
Listen. We're gonna go back inside,

1164
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,561
We're gonna collect ourselves.

1165
00:56:11,062 --> 00:56:13,022
Adam...are you cool?

1166
00:56:13,022 --> 00:56:14,565
No, Boyd.

1167
00:56:15,023 --> 00:56:16,566
No!

1168
00:56:16,566 --> 00:56:19,026
I am definitely not cool!

1169
00:56:20,569 --> 00:56:22,570
All right, problem child is leaving.

1170
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:24,572
Back inside, ok?

1171
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:26,573
Just get the fuck out of here!

1172
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:29,534
Go home, you fuck!

1173
00:56:32,078 --> 00:56:33,370
Pull it together. I got my
whole fucking family in there.

1174
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,080
Just get it the fuck over with.

1175
00:56:49,257 --> 00:56:51,009
What do you want?!

1176
00:56:56,054 --> 00:56:58,556
Mr. Fucking Minivan.

1177
00:57:00,557 --> 00:57:02,059
Get the hell out of here, mike!

1178
00:57:05,811 --> 00:57:07,563
He's gonna take out my minivan!

1179
00:57:08,564 --> 00:57:09,564
Don't you dare!

1180
00:57:09,564 --> 00:57:11,566
Hey, hey,
hey-- My god!

1181
00:57:12,984 --> 00:57:15,069
Aah! Fucking christ!

1182
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:18,070
Oh...

1183
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,072
Oh...

1184
00:57:20,406 --> 00:57:23,074
So it was some sort of accident?

1185
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:25,076
Yeah. He, uh... he didn't realize.

1186
00:57:25,535 --> 00:57:27,578
I guess he just lost control of the car.

1187
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:29,580
Was there some sort of argument?

1188
00:57:29,872 --> 00:57:31,081
No, nothing like that.

1189
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:33,582
We heard there was
some arguing going on.

1190
00:57:33,582 --> 00:57:36,085
What, some kind of
sibling muscle-Flex thing?

1191
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:39,045
No, no, no. They love each other.

1192
00:57:39,336 --> 00:57:42,589
Just, uh...we were all
just outside, just talking.

1193
00:57:43,006 --> 00:57:44,590
We were just talking.

1194
00:57:44,757 --> 00:57:47,093
What were you talking about?

1195
00:57:47,593 --> 00:57:49,594
Uh, the wedding...

1196
00:57:49,594 --> 00:57:51,095
Married...wedding...

1197
00:57:51,304 --> 00:57:53,097
Yeah, how it's probably
going to be the last time

1198
00:57:53,556 --> 00:57:55,557
For all of us to be
together... to see each other...

1199
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:57,559
Before he gets married.
Married. I'm getting married.

1200
00:57:57,851 --> 00:58:00,102
A lot of people seem to think
there was some hostility.

1201
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:01,561
Unh!

1202
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,564
How the fuck am i supposed to comment

1203
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,065
On what a lot of other
people thought, huh?

1204
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,608
I mean, listen,

1205
00:58:07,608 --> 00:58:09,610
We've all suffered an
incredible trauma here,

1206
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:12,611
And we're in full-On
grieving mode right now,

1207
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:15,072
And your questions are just
a little bit poorly timed.

1208
00:58:15,614 --> 00:58:18,074
Do you understand? Thank you
very much, officer Randone.

1209
00:58:18,074 --> 00:58:19,074
Easy, Boyd.

1210
00:58:19,074 --> 00:58:21,077
No "easy Boyd." Don't give me that shit.

1211
00:58:21,077 --> 00:58:23,578
I got a friend in there
in pieces, for god's sakes.

1212
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:26,080
How about a little sensitivity, huh?

1213
00:58:28,123 --> 00:58:31,585
There was no fighting
going on or nothing. Yeah.

1214
00:58:32,043 --> 00:58:33,586
Unh, unh, unh!

1215
00:58:33,669 --> 00:58:36,087
What was that guy's name?

1216
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:37,589
Robert Boyd.

1217
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,090
Unh, unh, unh!

1218
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,091
Excuse me...

1219
00:58:41,216 --> 00:58:43,093
His situation is critical.

1220
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,095
He's, uh...asking to speak to his wife.

1221
00:58:46,595 --> 00:58:47,597
Yes?

1222
00:58:48,014 --> 00:58:52,558
It's bad. I just want to warn
you of what you're going to see...

1223
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:55,144
Unh!

1224
00:59:14,074 --> 00:59:18,161
He's in defib. Gonna
have to step away, ma'am.

1225
00:59:18,411 --> 00:59:20,162
10 of lidocaine.

1226
00:59:20,245 --> 00:59:21,580
Clear.

1227
00:59:21,664 --> 00:59:23,582
More blood here. More blood.

1228
00:59:23,582 --> 00:59:25,624
Charge 300. Clear.

1229
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:27,668
Nothing.

1230
00:59:27,752 --> 00:59:31,129
He's got nothing left in
his heart. I've got nothing.

1231
00:59:31,462 --> 00:59:33,131
I'm gonna call it.

1232
00:59:33,131 --> 00:59:34,673
Time of death, 11:58 p.M.

1233
00:59:34,673 --> 00:59:36,674
I'm very sorry. He's dead.

1234
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:38,135
What did he say?

1235
00:59:38,135 --> 00:59:40,136
I'm sorry, he's dead.

1236
00:59:40,136 --> 00:59:41,136
What?

1237
00:59:41,136 --> 00:59:43,722
You--Why are
you walking away?

1238
00:59:43,722 --> 00:59:46,057
What are you walking away for?

1239
00:59:46,557 --> 00:59:49,643
What are you walking away for?

1240
00:59:52,687 --> 00:59:55,147
The need to know is clear:

1241
00:59:55,147 --> 00:59:58,649
What did Adam tell Lois?

1242
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:03,153
That's the name of the game. What did
Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?

1243
01:00:07,073 --> 01:00:08,073
Yeah.

1244
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:20,041
I killed my brother.

1245
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,964
I killed my brother.
I killed my brother.

1246
01:00:27,964 --> 01:00:28,964
All right.

1247
01:00:28,964 --> 01:00:32,508
I ran my brother down in
cold blood. I ran him down.

1248
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:34,510
I killed my brother.
I killed my brother.

1249
01:00:34,802 --> 01:00:35,511
Come on.

1250
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:38,972
I killed my brother.
I killed my brother.

1251
01:00:39,472 --> 01:00:40,473
It's time to pay the man.

1252
01:00:45,894 --> 01:00:48,895
Goddamn it! It's time to pay the man!

1253
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,397
Just take it easy!

1254
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:51,981
It's time to pay! Take it easy!

1255
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,482
Listen to me. Easy!

1256
01:00:53,482 --> 01:00:55,985
You kill one man, and
you're a murderer, ok?

1257
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,486
You kill all, and you are god.

1258
01:00:58,486 --> 01:01:00,946
Ok, just take it
easy. I killed my--

1259
01:01:00,946 --> 01:01:02,489
Take
it--

1260
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:04,491
You motherfucker!

1261
01:01:04,657 --> 01:01:06,450
Aah!

1262
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:07,952
Aah! Unh!

1263
01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:09,953
Never!

1264
01:01:09,953 --> 01:01:12,456
The memory of the just is blessed,

1265
01:01:12,456 --> 01:01:14,457
While the name of the wicked shallrot!

1266
01:01:14,457 --> 01:01:15,999
Get the--Get
the car.

1267
01:01:15,999 --> 01:01:18,460
The evil that men do lives
after us. You hear me?

1268
01:01:18,543 --> 01:01:20,002
Easy. Get off me!

1269
01:01:20,503 --> 01:01:22,004
Get off me!

1270
01:01:22,004 --> 01:01:25,006
The memory of the just is
blessed, while the name--

1271
01:01:25,006 --> 01:01:26,507
Pick him up.

1272
01:01:26,507 --> 01:01:29,510
It's time to confess your
sins! Confess our sins!

1273
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:31,511
Keep your voice down, Michael.

1274
01:01:31,511 --> 01:01:33,012
Open the door!

1275
01:01:33,012 --> 01:01:34,596
Just shut your face!

1276
01:01:34,596 --> 01:01:36,056
Get in the car!

1277
01:01:36,056 --> 01:01:38,057
Get in there. Come on!

1278
01:01:38,057 --> 01:01:40,560
The memory of the just is blessed,

1279
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,061
While the name of the wicked shall rot!

1280
01:01:43,061 --> 01:01:44,062
Michael! Michael!

1281
01:01:44,062 --> 01:01:46,064
You will control your
conditioned response.

1282
01:01:46,064 --> 01:01:48,065
You will pull yourself together, Mister!

1283
01:01:48,065 --> 01:01:50,025
All right! Are you hearing me?

1284
01:01:50,025 --> 01:01:51,025
Yes.

1285
01:01:51,025 --> 01:01:52,569
Jesus. He's cracked up.

1286
01:01:52,569 --> 01:01:55,570
I'm not cracking up!
He is not cracking up!

1287
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:59,407
What have we done?

1288
01:01:59,824 --> 01:02:01,575
What did you ask me?

1289
01:02:02,075 --> 01:02:03,535
I said, what have we done?

1290
01:02:06,078 --> 01:02:08,539
Yes, you did. Now, that is the question.

1291
01:02:08,539 --> 01:02:12,083
That is exactly the question
we should be asking ourselves.

1292
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:15,586
"What have we done?" Why don't
you tell us. What have we done?

1293
01:02:16,086 --> 01:02:18,588
I just want to get married. Exactly!

1294
01:02:18,588 --> 01:02:20,590
Exactly my point. What's
your fucking point?

1295
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,591
I'm not talking to you, moore.

1296
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:25,594
What's your point?! What's your point?!

1297
01:02:27,595 --> 01:02:30,556
You want to know what you're doing here?

1298
01:02:30,556 --> 01:02:32,599
You are love-Pumping.

1299
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:37,561
You are protecting all
that is sacred and beautiful

1300
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:41,104
And in sync with poetry and sunsets

1301
01:02:41,104 --> 01:02:43,107
And little newborn babies.

1302
01:02:43,107 --> 01:02:45,066
You're walking the walk.

1303
01:02:45,483 --> 01:02:48,027
This is it, Fisher--
The real stuff.

1304
01:02:48,111 --> 01:02:50,070
You love this woman,

1305
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,615
And nothing-- Absolutely
nothing-- Supersedes love, man.

1306
01:02:55,074 --> 01:02:56,074
Nothing!

1307
01:02:56,074 --> 01:02:59,077
I love you, I love
moore, I love Michael.

1308
01:02:59,077 --> 01:03:01,078
This car is full of love!

1309
01:03:01,078 --> 01:03:04,081
But trust me, we will
do what it takes--

1310
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:06,582
Whatever it takes.

1311
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:20,593
Love does not lose.

1312
01:03:59,121 --> 01:04:01,124
Michael. Michael--
Oh, Michael...

1313
01:04:01,124 --> 01:04:03,583
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1314
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,127
No, it's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

1315
01:04:08,587 --> 01:04:10,589
I'll get you a new minivan.

1316
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:13,091
Then you can be the soccer mom.

1317
01:04:13,091 --> 01:04:15,092
You're the soccer Mom! Steady, boy.

1318
01:04:15,092 --> 01:04:17,094
No, it's not your fault.

1319
01:04:17,094 --> 01:04:20,638
No--Michael, watch
the nose. The nose!

1320
01:04:20,721 --> 01:04:21,597
Oh, Michael.

1321
01:04:21,597 --> 01:04:23,599
Michael, come on, let's go.

1322
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,058
Oh, god. Oh, oh!

1323
01:04:37,317 --> 01:04:39,111
I'm sorry!

1324
01:04:39,111 --> 01:04:41,112
I'm sorry!

1325
01:04:41,195 --> 01:04:42,613
I'm sorry!

1326
01:04:42,613 --> 01:04:44,615
Oh! Oh, my god!

1327
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:46,116
I'm sorry!

1328
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:50,577
Canceled?!

1329
01:04:51,078 --> 01:04:52,162
Canceled?

1330
01:04:52,245 --> 01:04:53,663
You're out of your fucking mind.

1331
01:04:53,663 --> 01:04:55,164
Nobody's talking about canceling.

1332
01:04:55,164 --> 01:04:56,665
I'm just talking about modifying.

1333
01:04:56,915 --> 01:04:58,166
No way. No way!

1334
01:04:58,416 --> 01:04:59,667
Can we just talk it through?

1335
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,169
Talkwhatthrough? Lookit, lookit...

1336
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:03,670
We are locked and loaded here, right?

1337
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:05,129
I mean, we are nonrefundable.

1338
01:05:05,505 --> 01:05:08,674
I have family at the
airport as we speak,

1339
01:05:08,674 --> 01:05:11,134
Getting ready to come
here to see us get married.

1340
01:05:11,134 --> 01:05:13,178
Do you understand? I have a
table full of presents out there.

1341
01:05:13,178 --> 01:05:15,179
Just answer it!

1342
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,640
Hello?

1343
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:20,183
Kyle, it's Lois.

1344
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:23,185
I was up at Adam's
study, and I found a note.

1345
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:25,187
It seems to be some sort of confession

1346
01:05:25,562 --> 01:05:29,190
About some horrible thing he did
to a woman in Las Vegas, and...

1347
01:05:29,523 --> 01:05:31,149
Buried outside of Vegas, about
Boyd being the ringleader...

1348
01:05:31,149 --> 01:05:33,150
She wants to know what the hell's
going on. I'm starting to freak out.

1349
01:05:33,484 --> 01:05:35,695
We're goosed. We're not
goosed. What's her disposition?

1350
01:05:35,986 --> 01:05:37,696
Regarding what? Did she
sound pissed, scared, hostile?

1351
01:05:38,154 --> 01:05:40,115
Did she say anything
about calling the police?

1352
01:05:40,198 --> 01:05:42,158
No, but she's definitely
pissed and hostile,

1353
01:05:42,449 --> 01:05:44,159
And she clearly is starting to
think that something's not right.

1354
01:05:44,534 --> 01:05:46,161
We're goosed--
Goosed by god!

1355
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,163
Michael, would you please calm down,
all right? What did you tell her?

1356
01:05:49,371 --> 01:05:51,707
I told her I had no idea what Adam
was talking about in that letter.

1357
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:53,708
Did she believe you? I have no idea.

1358
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:55,209
You can tell when people
believe you. It's obvious.

1359
01:05:55,459 --> 01:05:56,711
I don't have that skill,
but if I had to guess,

1360
01:05:57,211 --> 01:05:58,628
I'd say that she in no way believed me.

1361
01:05:58,712 --> 01:05:59,712
Goosed! Shut up.

1362
01:05:59,712 --> 01:06:00,713
Goosed! Stop it.

1363
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:02,215
Goosed! What's goosed?

1364
01:06:02,715 --> 01:06:04,716
Would you give him another
pill? He's already had two.

1365
01:06:05,216 --> 01:06:06,717
Give him two more.

1366
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:08,719
We are goosed!

1367
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:10,721
Open sesame.

1368
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:13,223
Jesus, Boyd, you're gonna
o.D. Him. Suck my ass!

1369
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:14,724
Goosed!

1370
01:06:14,724 --> 01:06:16,725
Hey!

1371
01:06:16,725 --> 01:06:18,143
I never liked you, Boyd.

1372
01:06:18,143 --> 01:06:19,686
You're a sneaky little
fuck-- Always have been.

1373
01:06:19,686 --> 01:06:21,687
What are you talking about?

1374
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:22,688
Don't sweet-Lip me.

1375
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:26,191
I don't understand where this
personal attack is coming from.

1376
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,692
You're a liar. I want to
know what happened in Vegas.

1377
01:06:28,942 --> 01:06:30,152
Nothing happened in Vegas.

1378
01:06:30,694 --> 01:06:32,696
I don't want to hear it from the liar,

1379
01:06:33,154 --> 01:06:35,155
So stick a plug in it, Boyd.

1380
01:06:35,364 --> 01:06:37,699
Fisher, what happened in Vegas?

1381
01:06:42,536 --> 01:06:44,204
Nothing happened in Vegas.

1382
01:06:44,538 --> 01:06:46,247
Moore?

1383
01:06:46,247 --> 01:06:48,499
Nothing happened, Lois.

1384
01:06:51,001 --> 01:06:52,252
Michael...

1385
01:06:58,257 --> 01:07:01,008
Do you have something to tell me?

1386
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:05,220
Michael, just tell Lois
nothing happened in Vegas.

1387
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,221
Shut up, Boyd! Shut up.

1388
01:07:07,221 --> 01:07:08,764
Michael...

1389
01:07:10,224 --> 01:07:11,683
Michael...

1390
01:07:11,683 --> 01:07:14,728
Goosed. What?

1391
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:21,274
Lois, we were bad.

1392
01:07:21,274 --> 01:07:24,734
We were very, very...
we were very, very bad.

1393
01:07:24,859 --> 01:07:28,237
He's just upset about Adam.
We're all a little upset.

1394
01:07:28,446 --> 01:07:30,739
Michael, Michael,
Michael... what did you do?

1395
01:07:32,366 --> 01:07:33,700
Uh...

1396
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:45,667
Nothing.

1397
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,668
Nothing happened in Vegas.

1398
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:50,671
All right, I'll call the police.

1399
01:07:50,671 --> 01:07:53,130
I will call the police right now

1400
01:07:53,673 --> 01:07:55,133
If I don't start getting some answers.

1401
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:57,676
Please calm down, Lois. Fuck you, Boyd.

1402
01:07:57,843 --> 01:07:59,678
Just take it easy, ok? Enough of this.

1403
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:01,679
Nothing happened, Lois.

1404
01:08:01,846 --> 01:08:03,680
Nothing happened. Nothing
happened. Nothing happened.

1405
01:08:04,014 --> 01:08:06,183
I am going to count to 5,
and I will call the police,

1406
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:08,642
And then we'll find out
what happened. One...

1407
01:08:08,642 --> 01:08:09,643
Goosed!

1408
01:08:09,643 --> 01:08:11,645
Two... please don't make this situation

1409
01:08:11,645 --> 01:08:14,188
3... any more tense than
it has to be, all right?

1410
01:08:14,647 --> 01:08:16,190
4... just relax, would you?

1411
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,191
I am calling the fucking police!

1412
01:08:18,191 --> 01:08:19,692
Ok, here's the deal!

1413
01:08:25,905 --> 01:08:28,741
Adam slept with a prostitute in Vegas.

1414
01:08:34,954 --> 01:08:37,122
He was sick with guilt.

1415
01:08:46,129 --> 01:08:47,630
Yeah.

1416
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:50,633
It's true. No.

1417
01:08:50,716 --> 01:08:53,634
It wasn't the first time.

1418
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:57,596
Adam had a...

1419
01:08:57,596 --> 01:09:01,099
Adam had a thing for...prostitutes.

1420
01:09:08,104 --> 01:09:10,105
My Adam?

1421
01:09:19,571 --> 01:09:22,574
My Adam? No...

1422
01:09:22,907 --> 01:09:24,575
I don't believe it.

1423
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:28,035
I don't believe it. It's not true.

1424
01:09:28,035 --> 01:09:30,037
Not my Adam!

1425
01:09:30,162 --> 01:09:32,580
We're very, very sorry.

1426
01:09:32,705 --> 01:09:34,082
You're lying!

1427
01:09:34,207 --> 01:09:36,083
You're a bunch of liars!

1428
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:37,542
I don't believe you!

1429
01:09:37,959 --> 01:09:40,087
Watch your fingers, watch your toes.

1430
01:09:40,087 --> 01:09:42,546
All right, fellas, I
want you to listen to me.

1431
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:44,547
Now, mommy's going to
take a little time-Out,

1432
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:46,550
And bunker's going to
keep you guys company,

1433
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:50,052
And everything's going
to be ok--I promise.

1434
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:52,054
Ok?

1435
01:09:53,596 --> 01:09:55,055
Ok.

1436
01:09:56,599 --> 01:09:57,600
Take my cell phone.

1437
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,601
After you drop the kids
off, take Michael home.

1438
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:01,060
Put a couple drinks
in him so he'll sleep.

1439
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,562
I don't think that's a good idea.

1440
01:10:02,562 --> 01:10:04,063
Just do it. I'll call you later.

1441
01:10:04,063 --> 01:10:05,063
What are you doing?

1442
01:10:05,063 --> 01:10:07,983
I'm gonna take care of business.

1443
01:10:07,983 --> 01:10:08,983
What does that mean?

1444
01:10:08,983 --> 01:10:11,485
What does that mean? Are you insane?

1445
01:10:11,485 --> 01:10:13,487
Do you actually think I would hurt Lois?

1446
01:10:13,987 --> 01:10:15,988
She's the mother of these
kids, for christ's sakes.

1447
01:10:15,988 --> 01:10:16,989
What's wrong with you?

1448
01:10:16,989 --> 01:10:19,991
You got a real nasty side
to your thought process.

1449
01:10:21,409 --> 01:10:24,495
Look, I'm sorry. It's just for tonight.

1450
01:10:24,495 --> 01:10:27,497
Lois is a mess, Michael is
upset, everybody's upset.

1451
01:10:27,497 --> 01:10:28,497
Shut up!

1452
01:10:28,831 --> 01:10:29,999
Ok, I am not canceling this wedding.

1453
01:10:29,999 --> 01:10:31,500
I don't want you to. I
won't even discuss it.

1454
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,001
Nobody's discussing it, ok?

1455
01:10:33,001 --> 01:10:35,003
I'm just gonna bring them back
home. I'm gonna come right back.

1456
01:10:35,086 --> 01:10:37,088
You have to pick up the
cake in the morning, early.

1457
01:10:37,504 --> 01:10:40,089
Don't we have somebody
to do that for us?

1458
01:10:40,256 --> 01:10:42,592
Yeah. You.

1459
01:10:42,925 --> 01:10:44,593
What...?

1460
01:10:44,593 --> 01:10:45,593
Ok. Ok.

1461
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:47,012
Aah!

1462
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,014
Why did I have to...

1463
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:53,600
Aw, Jesus fucking Christ!

1464
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:57,353
Evil bastards!

1465
01:10:58,104 --> 01:11:00,605
Aah, you hear that buzzing, fish?

1466
01:11:00,605 --> 01:11:01,606
Buzzing?

1467
01:11:01,939 --> 01:11:03,608
Yeah, like a...

1468
01:11:03,608 --> 01:11:07,110
Like a fucking chirping
in the back of my skull.

1469
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:10,112
I don't hear anything.

1470
01:11:10,112 --> 01:11:13,114
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.

1471
01:11:13,114 --> 01:11:14,616
Deedee? Deedee.

1472
01:11:14,616 --> 01:11:17,618
Boom! Bing, bing, bing. Bam, bam, bam.

1473
01:11:33,588 --> 01:11:35,089
Ahh...

1474
01:11:35,089 --> 01:11:39,593
Dad used to bring home these
sparklers for me and Adam, you know?

1475
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:42,595
Sparklers!

1476
01:11:42,762 --> 01:11:44,596
We'd go out back, the 3 of us,

1477
01:11:44,763 --> 01:11:46,598
And we'd hold it up to the sky

1478
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:49,100
And watch the explosions of
light and sparks, you know,

1479
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,102
And dad would be all, "wait for
it. Here it comes. Watch for it.

1480
01:11:52,102 --> 01:11:54,104
Ok, here it comes.
Here comes the wah-Hoo."

1481
01:11:54,271 --> 01:11:55,104
Wah-Hoo?

1482
01:11:55,104 --> 01:11:57,606
Wah-Hoo! The sparkler would burn hot,

1483
01:11:58,023 --> 01:11:59,608
Then hotter, then even hotter,

1484
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:02,109
And then there'd be this
one moment of pure burn

1485
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,612
When that little fucker would
cook perfect-- Just perfect.

1486
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,614
It would only last a second,
but that second was it.

1487
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:08,614
It wasit.

1488
01:12:09,031 --> 01:12:10,616
And that's what dad
had us looking for, man.

1489
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:12,617
Are you with me? The wah-Hoo moment?

1490
01:12:12,617 --> 01:12:14,619
That's exactly right.
That's what I'm driving at:

1491
01:12:14,994 --> 01:12:17,121
Man burning at
his absolute--

1492
01:12:17,121 --> 01:12:18,622
All the forces coming together,

1493
01:12:18,622 --> 01:12:21,124
Burning just
perfect--

1494
01:12:21,124 --> 01:12:22,125
Perfect harmony.

1495
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,584
That's what I'm driving at.

1496
01:12:23,834 --> 01:12:25,127
Are you with me?

1497
01:12:25,127 --> 01:12:26,587
I think so.

1498
01:12:26,754 --> 01:12:28,588
I've been looking for that flash.

1499
01:12:28,588 --> 01:12:30,130
I've been looking,
and I've been looking,

1500
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:32,133
And I can't find it.

1501
01:12:32,133 --> 01:12:33,592
And what if it already
happened, you know?

1502
01:12:33,592 --> 01:12:34,592
My moment.

1503
01:12:35,093 --> 01:12:37,887
What if it happened,
and I didn't even see it?

1504
01:12:43,099 --> 01:12:44,100
Lois?

1505
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,643
Lois?

1506
01:12:46,643 --> 01:12:47,643
Adam...

1507
01:12:47,643 --> 01:12:49,604
No, it's Boyd.

1508
01:12:49,604 --> 01:12:51,021
I just want you to know

1509
01:12:51,021 --> 01:12:53,023
Just how much I didn't appreciate

1510
01:12:53,023 --> 01:12:55,025
That personal attack.

1511
01:12:57,026 --> 01:12:58,026
I'm really offended!

1512
01:12:58,026 --> 01:13:00,070
Uhh! No!

1513
01:13:05,031 --> 01:13:06,033
Uhh!

1514
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:10,035
You picked the wrong
woman, motherfucker!

1515
01:13:11,037 --> 01:13:12,538
Aaaahhhhh!

1516
01:13:12,538 --> 01:13:15,998
Auuuuughh god!

1517
01:13:15,998 --> 01:13:18,042
Ahhhhhh!

1518
01:13:18,042 --> 01:13:19,042
Ow!

1519
01:13:19,209 --> 01:13:20,543
It's over, baby.

1520
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:24,046
I'm gonna turn myself in.

1521
01:13:24,338 --> 01:13:25,547
No. After the wedding, of course.

1522
01:13:25,839 --> 01:13:27,548
After the wedding, out of respect.

1523
01:13:27,548 --> 01:13:29,050
I don't think
that's a good idea--

1524
01:13:29,134 --> 01:13:30,551
No, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

1525
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:32,052
Out of respect for Fisher.

1526
01:13:32,052 --> 01:13:33,554
Out of respect
for you--

1527
01:13:33,554 --> 01:13:34,554
Listen to me,
listen to me--

1528
01:13:35,013 --> 01:13:36,555
Respect for your wife

1529
01:13:36,555 --> 01:13:39,016
And your wedding, ok? All right?

1530
01:13:39,016 --> 01:13:40,017
Do you hear where I am here?

1531
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:41,059
I appreciate it.

1532
01:13:41,059 --> 01:13:42,560
You're just being too hard on yourself.

1533
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,560
No, no, no, no, no.

1534
01:13:44,061 --> 01:13:45,062
This is my doing, ok?

1535
01:13:45,062 --> 01:13:46,521
Just stop.

1536
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:47,522
I'm gonna have a spark
of my own, all right?

1537
01:13:50,066 --> 01:13:50,858
Ahh!

1538
01:13:51,067 --> 01:13:52,484
Jesus!

1539
01:13:55,069 --> 01:13:56,071
Aah!

1540
01:13:58,155 --> 01:13:59,989
Get up!

1541
01:14:02,992 --> 01:14:04,993
You're mine!

1542
01:14:05,077 --> 01:14:05,994
I'm gonna do this for Lois...

1543
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:09,580
And for my brother...

1544
01:14:10,998 --> 01:14:12,541
And for the kids...

1545
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,002
I'm gonna turn myself
in, 'cause I'm all that.

1546
01:14:16,002 --> 01:14:17,002
Shh!

1547
01:14:17,002 --> 01:14:18,504
Aaaaahhhhhh!

1548
01:14:20,922 --> 01:14:22,965
I've thinked it over, fish.

1549
01:14:22,965 --> 01:14:23,967
What is it?

1550
01:14:23,967 --> 01:14:24,967
Listen...

1551
01:14:25,509 --> 01:14:27,052
If you think about names,

1552
01:14:27,052 --> 01:14:29,012
You know, babies...

1553
01:14:29,012 --> 01:14:31,013
Michael's a pretty good one,

1554
01:14:31,013 --> 01:14:33,014
You know?

1555
01:14:33,014 --> 01:14:35,058
This stuff will be over, right?

1556
01:14:35,558 --> 01:14:37,018
Fish? Fish?

1557
01:14:39,019 --> 01:14:41,021
You know what I'm saying?

1558
01:14:41,021 --> 01:14:42,063
Hello?

1559
01:14:42,397 --> 01:14:44,064
Ok, here's the deal.

1560
01:14:44,064 --> 01:14:46,066
And it's a good one. Lois is cool.

1561
01:14:46,066 --> 01:14:48,568
It's a pacified situation.

1562
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:51,028
Whoa, whoa. What do you mean?

1563
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,572
She's resting, she's comfortable.

1564
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,031
The only thing is,

1565
01:14:55,031 --> 01:14:57,033
You still got Michael
there, right? Right?

1566
01:14:57,033 --> 01:14:58,034
Yeah.

1567
01:14:58,576 --> 01:14:59,576
Ok, great.

1568
01:15:00,076 --> 01:15:01,577
She wants to see him in person.

1569
01:15:01,869 --> 01:15:03,079
She, uh...

1570
01:15:03,079 --> 01:15:05,080
She needs to grieve with her family.

1571
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,040
Just a little family time.

1572
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,542
Right now? Yeah.

1573
01:15:08,542 --> 01:15:10,084
Well, isn't it a little late?

1574
01:15:10,084 --> 01:15:13,546
Get over here and don't
be so goddamn selfish!

1575
01:15:19,592 --> 01:15:22,593
Ok, you guys wait in the car.

1576
01:15:22,593 --> 01:15:24,594
I'm gonna take him in.

1577
01:15:24,594 --> 01:15:26,597
She just wants to see him alone.

1578
01:15:26,597 --> 01:15:28,598
Lois wants to see me?

1579
01:15:28,598 --> 01:15:30,600
Here we go, big guy.

1580
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,059
Upsy-Daisy!

1581
01:15:33,602 --> 01:15:36,062
Yes. She wants a big
hug, big family hug.

1582
01:15:36,563 --> 01:15:37,396
Come on.

1583
01:15:37,563 --> 01:15:39,064
One foot in front of the other...

1584
01:15:39,564 --> 01:15:40,398
There you go.

1585
01:15:40,565 --> 01:15:41,567
Hey, Fisher? Yeah?

1586
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:44,110
I'm gonna do this, and then
we're gonna go to fatburger.

1587
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:45,569
Ok, big guy.

1588
01:15:47,571 --> 01:15:48,572
Lois is in the house.

1589
01:15:48,572 --> 01:15:51,073
Come on, Michael, get in the house.

1590
01:16:06,085 --> 01:16:07,585
You know...

1591
01:16:09,086 --> 01:16:12,089
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.

1592
01:16:12,089 --> 01:16:13,090
A move?

1593
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:15,592
Yeah. Greenpeace.

1594
01:16:15,592 --> 01:16:16,593
Greenpeace?

1595
01:16:16,593 --> 01:16:17,593
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1596
01:16:17,593 --> 01:16:20,095
Maybe go up to the
north pole, the arctic.

1597
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:23,598
Tag polar bears with dart guns.

1598
01:16:23,598 --> 01:16:26,100
I've always had pretty good aim.

1599
01:16:54,121 --> 01:16:56,664
Michael was in love with Lois.

1600
01:16:56,664 --> 01:16:59,625
That's what Michael and
Adam were arguing about

1601
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:01,626
In the parking lot.

1602
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:04,086
Michael killed Adam in a jealous rage,

1603
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:06,046
Lois rejected Michael,

1604
01:17:06,046 --> 01:17:09,007
He strangled her to death...

1605
01:17:09,007 --> 01:17:12,885
And he shot himself in the head.

1606
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:14,886
Happens all the time.

1607
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:23,184
That Lois, she fought
like a fucking comanche.

1608
01:17:25,686 --> 01:17:28,188
Well, I don't see how this
could have been kept from you.

1609
01:17:28,397 --> 01:17:30,690
Last month, Adam and
Lois changed their will.

1610
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:34,234
They requested that you
two, as a married couple,

1611
01:17:34,568 --> 01:17:36,235
Be custodians of
record for their estate,

1612
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:40,947
Including all properties, cash
holdings, security holdings,

1613
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:43,992
And...children.

1614
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:47,952
Adam had a $500,000 term
life insurance policy.

1615
01:17:48,077 --> 01:17:49,412
What does that mean?

1616
01:17:49,496 --> 01:17:51,914
That means we have $500,000
to help raise the kids.

1617
01:17:51,997 --> 01:17:52,873
No! Yes.

1618
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:53,665
No! Yes.

1619
01:17:53,999 --> 01:17:55,459
Actually, no.

1620
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:59,461
Adam failed to make his last
payment, so his term life lapsed.

1621
01:17:59,878 --> 01:18:02,964
But he did have a pension
account worth $150,000

1622
01:18:03,131 --> 01:18:05,549
And the house, valued at 350,000.

1623
01:18:05,549 --> 01:18:07,092
Ok, so where does that leave us?

1624
01:18:07,092 --> 01:18:09,094
150 and 350,

1625
01:18:09,094 --> 01:18:11,095
That takes us back up to 500,000.

1626
01:18:11,095 --> 01:18:13,097
Not even close. The
property value's down.

1627
01:18:13,097 --> 01:18:15,598
The house is worth 100,000 less...

1628
01:18:15,598 --> 01:18:18,059
3 credit cards...

1629
01:18:18,267 --> 01:18:20,018
The minivan payments...

1630
01:18:20,352 --> 01:18:23,938
And the income and the state
taxes assessed on his I.R.A...

1631
01:18:24,105 --> 01:18:26,607
That leaves you in
the neighborhood of...

1632
01:18:27,107 --> 01:18:30,568
$14,223.

1633
01:18:30,943 --> 01:18:32,111
Are you fucking kidding me?

1634
01:18:33,945 --> 01:18:36,531
Timmy: the hell did you do
that for, you little asshole?

1635
01:18:36,614 --> 01:18:38,532
What are you gonna do
about it, you little fucker?

1636
01:18:38,532 --> 01:18:39,950
Come on, hit me!

1637
01:18:40,117 --> 01:18:42,577
Secretary: hey, hey, come
on--Enough, enough, enough.

1638
01:18:44,078 --> 01:18:45,037
So...

1639
01:18:45,037 --> 01:18:46,622
When's the wedding?

1640
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,039
Tomorrow.

1641
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,084
We're getting married tomorrow.

1642
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:53,085
Secretary: I've had
enough of you two devils!

1643
01:18:53,627 --> 01:18:54,628
Enough! Enough!

1644
01:18:54,628 --> 01:18:57,589
Excuse me for a moment.

1645
01:18:59,381 --> 01:19:00,090
Enough!

1646
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:01,132
What is going on?

1647
01:19:01,591 --> 01:19:02,592
These are your clients'
kids! Look at these--

1648
01:19:03,009 --> 01:19:04,135
It's gonna be ok.

1649
01:19:04,594 --> 01:19:06,136
It's not ok.

1650
01:19:06,595 --> 01:19:09,097
It's not ok. It's not ok.

1651
01:19:09,097 --> 01:19:10,598
We're gonna be fine.

1652
01:19:10,598 --> 01:19:13,059
We have to cancel.

1653
01:19:13,059 --> 01:19:15,102
No. No, we don't, no, we don't.

1654
01:19:15,102 --> 01:19:16,602
It's gonna
be ok, honey--

1655
01:19:16,602 --> 01:19:18,103
It's gonna be ok.

1656
01:19:18,228 --> 01:19:19,605
Do you love me?

1657
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:22,607
Kyle... it's gonna be ok.

1658
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:25,109
W-W-We killed
a woman.

1659
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:28,111
What are you talking about?

1660
01:19:28,111 --> 01:19:29,612
In Vegas.

1661
01:19:29,905 --> 01:19:32,114
Michael killed a woman.

1662
01:19:32,364 --> 01:19:35,116
Michael killed her-- He
hit her head and she bled.

1663
01:19:35,617 --> 01:19:38,619
And she...she died.

1664
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:42,622
But there was nothing we could
do about it, so we buried her.

1665
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:44,623
Who's dead?

1666
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:46,626
The prostitute's dead.

1667
01:19:46,792 --> 01:19:48,126
You fucked a prostitute?

1668
01:19:48,126 --> 01:19:49,627
No. Michael did.

1669
01:19:50,044 --> 01:19:51,587
It was an accident, Michael did it.

1670
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:53,130
Where is she?

1671
01:19:53,464 --> 01:19:55,632
She's buried in the desert.

1672
01:19:56,132 --> 01:19:59,635
You left a dead prostitute
alone in the desert?

1673
01:19:59,885 --> 01:20:02,178
She's not alone.

1674
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:04,139
Boyd
went--

1675
01:20:04,222 --> 01:20:06,140
Boyd went crazy.

1676
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,183
He went nuts, and he
started killing everybody.

1677
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:11,185
He killed a guard. He killed Michael.

1678
01:20:11,185 --> 01:20:12,186
He killed
Lois--

1679
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:14,730
Stop, ok? Just stop right there.

1680
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:17,690
I don't want to hear
any more of this, ok?

1681
01:20:17,898 --> 01:20:20,693
I told you not to do that stupid
fucking bachelor party thing.

1682
01:20:21,026 --> 01:20:22,235
I know.

1683
01:20:22,527 --> 01:20:24,028
You were warned! I know.

1684
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,697
You were warned, Kyle! You were warned!

1685
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,698
I told you your friends
were just jackasses!

1686
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,699
I know! And I'm sorry.

1687
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:33,702
I've waited 27 years, ok?

1688
01:20:33,702 --> 01:20:37,705
27 years I have focused and prepared

1689
01:20:37,705 --> 01:20:40,165
To walk down that aisle,

1690
01:20:40,249 --> 01:20:42,209
And I will not be derailed.

1691
01:20:42,543 --> 01:20:44,752
I will not be embarrassed,

1692
01:20:45,002 --> 01:20:46,211
And I will not be denied!

1693
01:20:46,712 --> 01:20:48,213
So tomorrow, I am
walking down that aisle,

1694
01:20:48,714 --> 01:20:51,132
Come hell or high fucking water!

1695
01:21:28,202 --> 01:21:29,744
Ok!

1696
01:21:29,744 --> 01:21:30,745
Showtime.

1697
01:21:31,203 --> 01:21:32,204
We're about two minutes out.

1698
01:21:32,747 --> 01:21:33,747
Moore?

1699
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:35,749
Better take your position.

1700
01:21:36,082 --> 01:21:37,208
Chop-Chop!

1701
01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:40,210
Let me see you.

1702
01:21:42,253 --> 01:21:44,714
There you are.

1703
01:21:45,673 --> 01:21:47,716
You look great, man.

1704
01:21:49,259 --> 01:21:50,718
Go get 'em.

1705
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,428
Hoooo...

1706
01:21:56,556 --> 01:21:59,725
This is a situation
that defies judgment.

1707
01:21:59,933 --> 01:22:02,227
We have acted and shown courage

1708
01:22:02,436 --> 01:22:06,606
Of a nature not known by most.

1709
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:10,191
You've got a warped though process.

1710
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:12,276
Your brain doesn't function properly.

1711
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,194
Whatever you say, kojak.

1712
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:14,236
I'm serious.

1713
01:22:14,236 --> 01:22:15,237
No,
no, no--

1714
01:22:15,695 --> 01:22:17,280
I'mthe serious one here, ok?

1715
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,198
I'm the serious one.

1716
01:22:18,198 --> 01:22:19,698
I'm the guy making the fucking plays.

1717
01:22:20,115 --> 01:22:22,283
I'm the Indian runner, for Chris sake,

1718
01:22:22,367 --> 01:22:24,452
And I want my money!

1719
01:22:26,286 --> 01:22:27,037
What money?

1720
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,247
Blood money!

1721
01:22:28,247 --> 01:22:31,290
Insurance dollars
which you have thus far

1722
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:34,460
Somehow let slip your
mind to tell me about!

1723
01:22:36,294 --> 01:22:37,295
You're sick.

1724
01:22:37,753 --> 01:22:39,756
If you think you can fuck me, fish,

1725
01:22:40,297 --> 01:22:41,298
You can't, ok?

1726
01:22:41,298 --> 01:22:43,800
I'm backed up. I'm insulated, baby!

1727
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,802
Backed up on floppy, do you get me?

1728
01:22:45,802 --> 01:22:47,803
I want that fucking money!

1729
01:22:47,803 --> 01:22:49,804
Oh, god, I can taste it!

1730
01:22:49,971 --> 01:22:51,806
Not a prayer.

1731
01:22:52,015 --> 01:22:52,807
Goddamn it!

1732
01:22:52,807 --> 01:22:54,808
I'm a fucking lighthouse, man!

1733
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:57,269
I stay lit for you! I stay lit!

1734
01:22:57,811 --> 01:23:00,979
I never go dark! Never go dark!

1735
01:23:04,774 --> 01:23:06,775
You need help.

1736
01:23:07,777 --> 01:23:08,694
I want that fucking money!

1737
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:11,779
I told Boyd two fucking minutes.

1738
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:14,782
I want my money!

1739
01:23:14,782 --> 01:23:16,783
Aaahhhh!

1740
01:23:19,535 --> 01:23:22,829
Hope you have a nice
wedding, you stupid idiot!

1741
01:23:23,121 --> 01:23:26,832
You trying to cheat
me, you goddamn bastard!

1742
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:29,292
Boyd!

1743
01:23:30,752 --> 01:23:33,462
This is my day!

1744
01:23:38,216 --> 01:23:39,300
Baby, wait! Wait!

1745
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,302
Stop, baby.

1746
01:23:47,806 --> 01:23:49,808
Ok.

1747
01:23:50,224 --> 01:23:53,811
Stick him in the crapper
and get your ass upstairs.

1748
01:23:53,936 --> 01:23:55,812
Baby?

1749
01:24:01,316 --> 01:24:03,318
The best man's not gonna make it.

1750
01:24:03,318 --> 01:24:05,319
We're gonna just start, ok?

1751
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:06,320
Sure.

1752
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,821
Great.

1753
01:24:10,323 --> 01:24:12,283
Where's Boyd?

1754
01:24:12,283 --> 01:24:13,825
In the toilet.

1755
01:24:16,286 --> 01:24:19,288
We're gonna get started, ok?

1756
01:25:22,878 --> 01:25:24,420
Dearly beloved,

1757
01:25:24,504 --> 01:25:28,424
We are all here today because
two very special people,

1758
01:25:28,549 --> 01:25:29,424
Laura and Kyle,

1759
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:30,925
Have found each other.

1760
01:25:31,384 --> 01:25:34,928
You can't...spawn the salmon man!

1761
01:25:35,012 --> 01:25:37,931
When I see two young
people in love as they are,

1762
01:25:38,265 --> 01:25:41,933
I find myself renewed and
inspired because the spirit--

1763
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:43,935
Rise!

1764
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:47,437
With hope for the future and joy.

1765
01:25:47,813 --> 01:25:49,356
I'm coming!

1766
01:25:49,481 --> 01:25:50,440
Let us begin.

1767
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,899
May we have the rings, please?

1768
01:25:52,191 --> 01:25:53,900
I'm on my way!

1769
01:25:54,193 --> 01:25:55,903
The rings. We need the rings.

1770
01:25:56,194 --> 01:25:56,987
I don't have the rings.

1771
01:25:57,195 --> 01:25:58,863
I got the ring!

1772
01:25:58,946 --> 01:26:00,448
Boyd has the rings.

1773
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:02,949
I'm there...

1774
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:03,950
Excuse me.

1775
01:26:15,917 --> 01:26:17,878
Oh, god.

1776
01:26:21,421 --> 01:26:23,465
Oh, god...

1777
01:26:23,673 --> 01:26:24,507
Where's the rings?

1778
01:26:24,924 --> 01:26:25,925
Shh!

1779
01:26:40,936 --> 01:26:43,396
Aaaahhhhhh! Jesus christ!

1780
01:26:53,446 --> 01:26:54,446
Got 'em.

1781
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,534
Now we can begin.

1782
01:27:01,952 --> 01:27:05,454
Do you, Kyle, take this woman Laura

1783
01:27:05,579 --> 01:27:06,956
To be your wife and helpmate

1784
01:27:06,956 --> 01:27:08,457
In sickness and in health

1785
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:10,917
Along life's highways,
wherever they may take you,

1786
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:13,419
Until death do you part?

1787
01:27:13,419 --> 01:27:14,420
I do.

1788
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:16,421
And do you, Laura,
take this man Kyle--

1789
01:27:16,421 --> 01:27:17,881
I do.

1790
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:19,465
You may kiss the bride.

1791
01:27:26,846 --> 01:27:27,930
Hey, guys?

1792
01:27:28,388 --> 01:27:29,390
Listen, I need two minutes with him.

1793
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:30,932
I'll be right out.

1794
01:27:31,307 --> 01:27:32,391
Baby, I just want you
to know that all this,

1795
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,393
Everything I did, is 'cause I love you

1796
01:27:34,393 --> 01:27:36,395
And I wanted you to have that wedding

1797
01:27:36,687 --> 01:27:37,937
Like you always wanted to have, ok?

1798
01:27:38,271 --> 01:27:39,396
You and moore are gonna go
move those fucking bodies,

1799
01:27:39,897 --> 01:27:40,898
Do you understand me?

1800
01:27:40,898 --> 01:27:42,441
And you're gonna bury Boyd with them.

1801
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:43,900
And in fact, you know what?

1802
01:27:44,442 --> 01:27:46,444
You're gonna fucking put
moore in the ground, too.

1803
01:27:46,528 --> 01:27:48,445
You want me to kill moore?

1804
01:27:48,445 --> 01:27:50,446
I know he's your only friend left, ok?

1805
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:51,907
But he is a loose string,

1806
01:27:51,907 --> 01:27:52,907
And you are gonna have to start

1807
01:27:52,907 --> 01:27:54,908
Fucking flushing the
toilet like a big boy,

1808
01:27:54,908 --> 01:27:55,909
Do you understand me?

1809
01:27:55,909 --> 01:27:56,910
Laura?

1810
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:58,411
Fuck!

1811
01:27:58,870 --> 01:27:59,912
You know...

1812
01:28:00,162 --> 01:28:01,413
You guys,
listen--

1813
01:28:01,413 --> 01:28:04,374
Two minutes, please. Just make
my apologies for me. Do your job.

1814
01:28:04,499 --> 01:28:06,000
And while you're at it, you know,

1815
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,960
Just get rid of that fucking dog.

1816
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,420
The dog?

1817
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:10,920
I don't care what you
do, get rid of him.

1818
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,421
Lose him in the desert.

1819
01:28:12,421 --> 01:28:14,423
You want me to kill the dog?

1820
01:28:14,423 --> 01:28:15,924
Do you love me? Yes.

1821
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:16,967
Do you? Mm-Hmm.

1822
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:17,967
Do you love me?

1823
01:28:17,967 --> 01:28:18,968
Mm-Hmm.

1824
01:28:18,968 --> 01:28:20,970
Do you love me? Mm-Hmm.

1825
01:28:24,973 --> 01:28:26,974
Do it?

1826
01:28:28,975 --> 01:28:30,477
Laura!

1827
01:28:30,477 --> 01:28:31,478
Fuck!

1828
01:28:32,895 --> 01:28:34,938
I told you two fucking minutes!

1829
01:29:57,042 --> 01:29:59,085
I've been thinking.

1830
01:29:59,085 --> 01:30:02,629
I've been thinking about
what you said that day--

1831
01:30:02,629 --> 01:30:04,630
The prayer.

1832
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:06,132
About using this whole mess

1833
01:30:06,633 --> 01:30:08,133
To bring out the good in me.

1834
01:30:10,594 --> 01:30:11,595
I think there's a lot of truth in that.

1835
01:30:12,137 --> 01:30:14,138
I'm gonna pursue some options.

1836
01:30:17,599 --> 01:30:20,142
I want to join that big brother thing.

1837
01:30:20,142 --> 01:30:21,143
Yeah.

1838
01:30:21,561 --> 01:30:24,146
I want a black one.

1839
01:30:24,146 --> 01:30:26,647
I want a little black brother.

1840
01:30:26,647 --> 01:30:30,108
It's a big problem, it seems to me,

1841
01:30:30,108 --> 01:30:31,109
You know?

1842
01:30:31,651 --> 01:30:34,654
Lack of racial integration,
that's a big one.

1843
01:30:34,654 --> 01:30:36,655
Don't you think?

1844
01:30:38,114 --> 01:30:39,115
Kyle?

1845
01:30:54,126 --> 01:30:56,128
Do you love me?

1846
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:14,642
That ought to be about the end of that.

1847
01:31:16,143 --> 01:31:18,645
Yup.

1848
01:31:31,154 --> 01:31:33,155
Because that is the point here, ok?

1849
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:36,158
That is what I'm driving for.

1850
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:38,159
When the big storm comes

1851
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,619
And it knocks down all the forests

1852
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:41,621
And all the rocks fall down

1853
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:44,164
And all the leaves
are bare, what is left?

1854
01:31:44,664 --> 01:31:47,125
What is left?

1855
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:50,126
The little trees.

1856
01:31:50,668 --> 01:31:53,671
The little fellas that
the storm didn't see.

1857
01:31:53,671 --> 01:31:55,964
The tiny little trees.

1858
01:32:39,497 --> 01:32:41,999
Ok, boys, let's hear the badger oath.

1859
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,501
Come on, boys, Let's
hear it one more time.

1860
01:32:44,501 --> 01:32:46,002
A badger is great.

1861
01:32:46,002 --> 01:32:50,005
A badger faces great adversity...

1862
01:32:51,506 --> 01:32:53,008
A badger is economical,

1863
01:32:53,216 --> 01:32:55,509
Saves for the unforeseen.

1864
01:32:55,592 --> 01:32:57,010
A badger is sanitary,

1865
01:32:57,385 --> 01:32:59,512
Keeps his mind and body pure.

1866
01:32:59,512 --> 01:33:00,513
Yes.

1867
01:33:01,013 --> 01:33:02,472
Come on, let's see the badger salute.

1868
01:33:02,472 --> 01:33:03,474
Aw, no!

1869
01:33:03,474 --> 01:33:05,475
Come on, let's see the badger salute.

1870
01:33:07,435 --> 01:33:08,519
Yes.

1871
01:33:08,519 --> 01:33:09,979
Shit!

1872
01:33:11,021 --> 01:33:12,522
The hell with it.

1873
01:33:12,522 --> 01:33:14,023
Come on, give me your hand.

1874
01:33:14,023 --> 01:33:15,525
I don't need any help!

1875
01:33:15,525 --> 01:33:18,985
If you don't reach out
to me, I can't help.

1876
01:33:18,985 --> 01:33:20,528
Leave me alone!

1877
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:22,988
Your new mommy's coming.

1878
01:33:23,488 --> 01:33:24,989
Your new
mommy's--

1879
01:33:25,991 --> 01:33:28,034
Come on. Come on, now.
We're gonna make it.

1880
01:33:28,534 --> 01:33:30,035
Let's talk about our feelings.

1881
01:33:30,118 --> 01:33:31,495
I hate you and your bitch wife!

1882
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:33,038
Get your own crutch, stump boy!

1883
01:33:33,329 --> 01:33:35,039
Please clean the bathroom.

1884
01:33:35,289 --> 01:33:37,958
Let's talk about our
feelings. How do we feel?

1885
01:33:38,083 --> 01:33:39,501
A little help?

1886
01:33:39,584 --> 01:33:41,502
I can't breathe, asshole!

1887
01:33:42,503 --> 01:33:43,504
A little help, please?

1888
01:33:43,504 --> 01:33:45,005
Let go of me, you gimp!

1889
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,005
A little help?

1890
01:33:48,007 --> 01:33:50,009
Honey, could you help
me with the wheelchair?

1891
01:33:50,551 --> 01:33:52,552
Honey? I need some help.

1892
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:55,554
That's ok, she's not running from you.

1893
01:33:56,013 --> 01:33:58,431
Help me, honey. You
want to talk about us?
