1
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,770
As though we are atop living stilts which continuously grow,

2
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,480
occasionally taller even than church belfries,

3
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,480
until eventually, walking becomes difficult and dangerous

4
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,940
and at last, the fall.

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,650
They're coming.

6
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,980
Three clicks left...

7
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,570
Four clicks right...

8
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,900
One click left...
Two clicks right...

9
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,240
Now!

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,710
You did it, Kougami!

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,690
I say, it is the cruel law of art that

12
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,110
human beings should die

13
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,320
and that we ourselves must die after

14
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,030
exhausting the gamut of suffering,

15
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,870
so that the grass, not of oblivion but of eternal life

16
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,320
may grow, the thick grass of fecund works.

17
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,920
Do an equipment check.

18
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,820
Power the glasses.

19
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,770
Download the map and our schedule.

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,860
No problems. They're working.

21
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,110
Don't deviate from the specified route.

22
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,870
Let's go.

23
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,120
Did you find something?

24
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,540
It's nice to see that my customers got here safely.

25
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,370
Identity confirmed.

26
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,740
You are Mr. Miyazaki?

27
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,560
Hey c'mon. Give me a sec.

28
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,250
Let me turn my translator on first.

29
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,550
Say something.

30
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,670
We need a car.

31
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,680
We need a car.

32
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,900
Okay. Let's get down to business.

33
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,330
I want it just as I ordered it earlier.

34
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,700
An older-model car, without interior cameras.

35
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,900
It needs to have the lifeform scanners fooled too.

36
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,640
Not a problem.

37
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,750
Show me the money, and I'll get you anything.

38
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,040
Don't get tagged by the street scanners, alright?

39
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,870
I can tell just by looking at you guys

40
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,300
that your Psycho-Passes aren't good.

41
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,820
I'm surprised you found this place.

42
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,810
I've been using an information broker these days.

43
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,780
Huh.

44
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,240
Sort of like one of those old-school detectives.

45
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,620
You see the info from the Pillbugs

46
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,160
on your Terminals, right?

47
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,300
They're probably illegal immigrants,

48
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,130
although I don't know how they got in.

49
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,130
Six foreigners,

50
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,780
and one probable black market broker.

51
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,700
A quick Hue Check shows that they're all past the limit.

52
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,140
Checking their Crime Coefficients with the Dominators

53
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,170
will probably say the same thing.

54
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,210
What's the plan of attack?

55
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,670
Once we block the entrance to the parking garage with drones,

56
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,070
we'll split into emergency staircase
and elevator teams.

57
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,160
We've verified that there are no traps

58
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,950
at either of our entry points.

59
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,780
So,

60
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,830
Ginoza and Kunizuka will take the stairs with me.

61
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,770
will take the stairs with me.

62
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,340
Inspector Shimozuki will take the elevator with
Sugou and Hinakawa,

63
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,530
putting two drones in the lead.

64
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,290
Roger that.

65
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,940
First, my team will enter

66
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,790
using flashbang grenades,

67
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,180
which will distract the enemy.

68
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,480
At that time, Inspector Shimotsuki's team

69
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,750
will enter from the rear and flank the enemy,

70
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,760
trapping all of them.

71
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,790
Flashbangs?

72
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,030
You're being really careful.

73
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,360
If the information from the Pillbugs is correct,

74
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,830
the enemy is equipped with firearms.

75
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,450
You mean...

76
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,330
If we allow the enemy to counterattack,
there will likely be casualties.

77
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,910
Take extreme caution.

78
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,240
Roger.

79
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,160
Hmmm...

80
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,260
Well then, the deal's done.

81
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,680
Huh?

82
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,360
Shit! It's the Bureau?!

83
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,050
This is the Bureau of Public Safety!

84
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,160
Don't do anything stupid!

85
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,770
Crime Coefficient over 170.

86
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,510
He's a target for enforcement action.
The safety will be released.

87
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,440
Return fire!

88
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,960
Who are these guys?

89
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,770
They're used to combat.

90
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,350
Crime Coefficient is 310.

91
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,430
Lethal Eliminator.

92
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,290
He is a target for enforcement action.

93
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,000
Crime Coefficient is 326.

94
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
Lethal Eliminator.

95
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,330
Damnit!

96
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,520
He is a target for enforcement action.

97
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,340
Target's Threat Judgement has been updated.

98
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,740
Explosive Destroy Decomposer.

99
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,570
Secure him!

100
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,870
Understood!

101
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,120
This is the Bureau of Public Safety.

102
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,890
Please cease all resistance

103
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,570
and hand over the weapon in your possession,

104
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,540
then surrender.

105
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540
This is the Bureau of Public Safety.

106
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,070
That's enough!

107
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,380
Put down the weapon and give yourself up.

108
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,300
Turn around slowly.

109
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,270
Stop!

110
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,360
Crime Coefficient is 293.

111
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,640
He is an enforcement target.

112
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,000
This is a world where the mental state and personal tendencies of humans can be quantified.

113
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,940
While all sorts of inclinations are recorded and policed, these measured numbers used to judge people's souls are commonly called “Psycho-Pass."

114
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,370
When a person's Crime Coefficient exceeds a certain value, they are deemed a “Latent Criminal," and are arrested and isolated.

115
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,830
The Ministry of Health and Welfare manages a massive network to unmask Latent Criminals and provide Mental Care for the registered populace. This surveillance system is known as:

116
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,500
The Sybil System.

117
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:23,510
<font color="#b2fffb">In my heart the discord and the siren of emptiness won't stop ringing</font>

118
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:30,060
<font color="#b2fffb">It's as if they are testing me. Answer the truth</font>

119
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:36,060
<font color="#b2fffb">A freedom filled with blood is what you wanted, right?</font>

120
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:48,240
<font color="#b2fffb">In reality, I'm shaking. I don't even know my name</font>

121
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,870
<font color="#b2fffb">even though I know all about you</font>

122
00:12:53,250 --> 00:13:03,380
<font color="#b2fffb">Even if I cry, nothing will stop ringing</font>

123
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,470
<font color="#b2fffb">I'm just breathing. Where is my heart?</font>

124
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,560
<font color="#b2fffb">In this imitation play, freedom leads to a manipulated future and encounters</font>

125
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,980
<font color="#b2fffb">In the maze of the “meaning" that was set in this world,</font>

126
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,440
<font color="#b2fffb">I realize I'm sinking. “Who? What? Who? What?"</font>

127
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,450
<font color="#b2fffb">The indelible questions line up. A resounding distortion, why?</font>

128
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:31,290
<font color="#b2fffb">The double-edge knife colored this flawless abnormality</font>

129
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:37,370
<font color="#b2fffb">The griefs of “Who? What? Who? What?" have also been lost</font>

130
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,210
<font color="#b2fffb">Good bye feelings</font>

131
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,770
Up against armed criminals, yet you took zero casualties.

132
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,800
Well done.

133
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,290
The investigation will resume

134
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,780
once the Paralyzer wears off.

135
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,800
I'd like you to take a break until then.

136
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,820
Those illegal immigrants had guns.

137
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,620
Those advanced glasses

138
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,460
were developed by someone with knowledge

139
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,890
of this country's security protocols.

140
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,830
What are you trying to say?

141
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,960
Isn't something

142
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,910
strange going on?

143
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,340
Naturally,

144
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,300
all kinds of things are going on.

145
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,750
Whether it's strange or not is a matter of perspective.

146
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,420
Anyway,

147
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,770
I'll have more after my investigation.

148
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,450
Yes?

149
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,440
Inspector Shimotsuki,

150
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,670
come up to my office.

151
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,510
You're getting married?
Yes.

152
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,960
He's busy too, so

153
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,090
the ceremony will probably have to wait.

154
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,310
Even so, I want you to meet him.

155
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,330
You're finally getting married, huh?
Congrats!

156
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,980
Thanks.

157
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,810
Now I finally know firsthand that the Sybil System's

158
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,010
Romantic Compatibility is really something.

159
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,420
The System was the only reason I had a chance to meet him, too...

160
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,660
So we said “what the heck," and
contacted each other's parents.

161
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,220
Still,

162
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,850
I can't say that I didn't have any
complaints about him at first.

163
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,930
But in the end,

164
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,220
he was the perfect guy for me.

165
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,970
Although there was a lot to deal with too.

166
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
I see...

167
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,110
We can live in peace

168
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,330
Because of your Bureau of Public Safety, right?

169
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,850
Yeah.

170
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,470
If Sybil

171
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,110
can find us the path to happiness

172
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,500
better than we ever could,

173
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,890
maybe someday,

174
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,000
Sybil will be able to save everyone on Earth.

175
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,060
I wonder about that...

176
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,230
And now news regarding

177
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,070
the Sybil Export Program,

178
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,980
currently being conducted to aid SEAUn.

179
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,010
The experimentally deployed Sybil System
in the capital of Shamballa Float

180
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,410
which had issues with its initial roll-out,

181
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,970
is now functioning well...

182
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,420
It's impressive

183
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,980
that we could bring peace and order to a
war-torn nation.

184
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,260
I wonder...

185
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,240
where he is and what he's doing?

186
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,840
What's going on,

187
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,330
Shion?

188
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,620
I'm using a secure line right now.

189
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,490
Don't tell anybody that we had this conversation.

190
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,330
Inspector Shimotsuki is operating under the Chief's orders.

191
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,810
What's she doing?

192
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,670
I can't defy a superior's orders.

193
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,740
Get here as fast as you can.

194
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
I don't know what she's trying to do,

195
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,520
but could you stop her?

196
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,610
Can you buy some time?

197
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,230
Sorry, it's too late for that.

198
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,480
I'm so sorry.

199
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,120
You performed a Memory Scoop for the investigation?

200
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,970
What the hell were you thinking?

201
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,400
Don't get mad at me...

202
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,630
Chief's orders.

203
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,910
It's not Analyst Karanomori's fault.

204
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,020
The man was a confirmed Latent Criminal.

205
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,560
Just because there's no precedent

206
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,630
doesn't mean it's illegal.

207
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,690
That's awful.

208
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,620
We gave him some drugs

209
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,910
to make his brainwaves stand out more.

210
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,890
We've never had armed illegal immigrants come in before,

211
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,270
and on top of that, he's a Latent Criminal.

212
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,880
It's not like he has any rights we need to consider.

213
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,890
Thanks to that, I got results.

214
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,100
Results?

215
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,890
The Chief wants to see you.

216
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,160
What the hell are you using Inspector Shimotsuki for?

217
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,250
Investigating the incident.

218
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,250
You have no shame!

219
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,280
It's an incident all the same.

220
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,000
We did what had to be done.

221
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,970
Look at this.

222
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,400
I'm certain that you'll recognize him.

223
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,190
He was under your command, after all.

224
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,510
A group of foreign terrorists smuggle themselves in,

225
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:48,050
and their memories contain an Enforcer who deserted three years ago.

226
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,420
Very interesting, don't you think?

227
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,190
You see, my theory is that

228
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,570
Kougami Shinya has finally become a true criminal.

229
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,990
We've even determined where the illegal immigrants came from.
It was SEAUn.

230
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,530
They originated there,

231
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,030
and were terrorists involved in anti-government operations.

232
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,670
The Southeast Asian Union,

233
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,790
they're the ones in charge of managing the Sybil System?

234
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,940
That's right.

235
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,880
The current capital, the artificial island of Shamballa Float

236
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,440
is being administered as a Special Ward, and is also a

237
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,010
test case for remote management of the Sybil System.

238
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,960
However, the region is currently gripped by internal strife.

239
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,910
The top-grade armed drones we currently have in place

240
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,300
have been destroyed far more frequently as of late.

241
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,640
That also resembles him quite well.

242
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,660
There have occasionally been tales of hunters,
who in their zeal to catch their prey

243
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,650
end up becoming the prey themselves.

244
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,910
I don't know how he escaped, or what route he took,

245
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:58,760
but let's say that Kougami Shinya is hiding overseas,

246
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,940
and he's sending criminals over to Japan.

247
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,650
If he wanted to jeopardize the Sybil System,

248
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,840
that's a halfway decent plan.

249
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,980
Kougami wouldn't do that.

250
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,880
Then what do you think of the results of this memory montage?

251
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,230
Kougami Shinya and this terror group

252
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,270
might be connected in some way.

253
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,300
But,

254
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,220
we can't say with certainty that it proves he's become a criminal.

255
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,440
We should bring out the truth by investigating this.

256
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,960
We've identified the country that you came from.

257
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,710
Why did you come to Japan from SEAUn?

258
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:50,170
It must have something to do with the exportation of the Sybil System.
Right?

259
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,000
What can you tell me about this man?

260
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,340
Even if you don't talk, someone will.

261
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,320
No one will tell you anything.

262
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,660
What?

263
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,350
You animals lost sight of true justice

264
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,190
when you entrusted your fate to an oracle machine.

265
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,110
Our wars won't make any sense to you now.

266
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,780
You're asking about the possibility that

267
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,020
Kougami Shinya aided and abetted a crime?

268
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,060
That's right.

269
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,730
Maybe he isn't on the battlefield personally,

270
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,940
but his plan is to organize and lead people
to carry out his crimes.

271
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,680
Do you think that he's capable of that?

272
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,100
Like Makishima Shougo, for example?

273
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,460
Yes.

274
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,440
I'd like to say that it isn't possible,

275
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,950
but I also can't deny that the answer is colored by my personal feelings.

276
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,260
What Kougami is doing now wasn't captured by any of my predictions.

277
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,130
But...

278
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,640
If you want to live life

279
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,550
according to your professional duties,
you need to mold your soul

280
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:22,130
into the part assigned to you by society.

281
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,350
Kougami walked that path once.

282
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,570
But,

283
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:34,240
as he worked to capture Makishima, one who deviated from the mold,

284
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,860
he ended up deviating from what was expected of him as well.

285
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,630
Oh... You're applying to conduct your investigation abroad?

286
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,930
Yes.

287
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,620
You want to go to SEAUn personally?

288
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,450
The special ward of Shamballa Float is operated by the Sybil System.

289
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,270
In other words, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare
is entrusted with police powers.

290
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:08,450
Naturally, as it is enforced by one of its departments, the Bureau of Public Safety,

291
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,820
your actions will be permitted.

292
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,510
However,

293
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,880
you will be stepping into a lawless land the minute you set foot
outside Shamballa Float,

294
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,830
and this is why they will attempt to keep you within the Ward,

295
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:25,280
and they will not provide any aid in
the search for Kougami Shinya.

296
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,740
Is that all right with you?

297
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,250
I'm more than prepared.

298
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,120
There's an air mail transport leaving tomorrow.

299
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,750
It's a jet plane used to deliver sensitive equipment.

300
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,710
How many will be accompanying you?

301
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,810
Just me is enough.

302
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,830
If we consider what you know about <i>us</i>,

303
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,970
it's probably best that you're going alone.

304
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,120
I offered to come along, but they turned me down.

305
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,730
I'm not surprised.

306
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,610
Inspectors are never deployed abroad, after all,

307
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,860
let alone Enforcers.

308
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,170
I have a favor to ask.

309
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,630
What is it?

310
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,180
If you manage to meet up with him,

311
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,680
give him a punch for me.

312
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,140
I can't do that.

313
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,710
What?

314
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,300
If I find him, I'll arrest him and bring him back,

315
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,180
so I want you to punch him yourself.

316
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:41,790
I can't tell whether you've changed or not.

317
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,320
You're a mystery as always.

318
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,930
Good to have you along, Miss Ministry of Health and Welfare.

319
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,960
I'm glad to be here.

320
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,050
It's been a long time since we've brought along a living person.

321
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:38,830
All order and morality simply vanished into the chaos.

322
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:44,160
Nowadays, the vast majority of humanity is now forced to live lives no better than animals,

323
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,920
driven only by the compulsions of their desires.

324
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,540
Will they live in the cage that is the Sybil System?

325
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:58,110
Or will they step outside, and submit themselves to the Law of the Jungle?

326
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,410
Either way,

327
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,860
there's no longer any place on Earth that respects the ideologies and dignity of their fellow humans.

328
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,710
You've got to respect the strength it takes
to muster the willpower

329
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,010
and do what's necessary to live life according to your values

330
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,050
while forging your own destiny.

331
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,140
Especially to those who have been put in such a bind by their predicaments

332
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,010
that they're willing to go out and commit crimes.

333
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,220
Makishima Shougo demonstrated that strength,

334
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,990
and in the process of trying to catch him,

335
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,720
Kougami demonstrated it as well.

336
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,680
Yes.

337
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,040
Hey, does the SEAUn government

338
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,970
know who you really are?

339
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,740
Of course not.

340
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,500
Do you really think we would reveal a national secret to people overseas?

341
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,700
As of today, we've given SEAUn

342
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,040
street scanners for Cymatic Scanning

343
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,630
and the ability to send the collected data back to Japan.

344
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,320
We have forbidden their use of Dominators

345
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,380
and we have left the matter of public order

346
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,390
to the nation's military police.

347
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,650
To them, the Sybil System

348
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,940
is a black box somewhere overseas.

349
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,560
I'm surprised Chairman Han was willing to

350
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,990
accept an enigmatic system like that.

351
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:44,840
It simply goes to show how important it was to restore public order quickly.

352
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,620
It was a good opportunity.

353
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,480
I think it would be valuable for you to see just how scarce and valuable

354
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,230
something like peace is in the outside world.

355
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,070
Perhaps you will once again

356
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,510
become aware of Sybil's greatness.

357
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,710
This craft will arrive at SEAUn International Airport in fifteen minutes.

358
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,690
We will now be preparing to land,

359
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,660
so please fasten your seat belt.

360
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,140
I am Nicholas Wong, the captain of the Union Military Police.

361
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,290
You must be Inspector Akane Tsunemori, from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare?

362
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,660
Yes.

363
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,720
Welcome.

364
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,180
We welcome you and the Sybil System.

365
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,210
Are you shocked at how bad the situation is down here?

366
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,180
No...

367
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,230
Every country around the world is like this right now.

368
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,680
Except Japan, that is.

369
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,870
Is it really that dangerous around here?

370
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,390
This is one of the better parts of town.

371
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,840
The Junta in charge has been crushed.

372
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,540
This civil war is coming to a close.

373
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,380
So by that, you mean

374
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,170
that the war isn't quite over?

375
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,500
That's right.

376
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,430
At present, disruptive elements of the population opposed to the current regime remain.

377
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,590
Ahead of us lies Shamballa Special Ward,

378
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,990
where the Sybil System is being experimentally started.

379
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,450
Only those whose Hue and Crime Coefficient are at normal levels are permitted

380
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,730
permitted to enter.

381
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,920
Please, let me into Shamballa Float!

382
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,920
It's thanks to your country.

383
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,710
Please, open up!

384
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,710
Hurry up and remove her.

385
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,050
<i>Let me in, please!</i>

386
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,470
<i>Don't move! Move and I'll shoot!</i>

387
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,510
Don't worry about it.
This happens quite often.

388
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,650
This bus is only for residents authorized by the Sybil System.

389
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,300
Who are those people with the collars?

390
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,950
You've noticed them, have you?

391
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,020
They are Latent Criminals.

392
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,080
That device allows allows them to move about freely,

393
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,030
but constantly monitors their Psycho-Pass.

394
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,580
If their hue clouds, their Crime Coefficient is immediately measured.

395
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,930
Depending on their Coefficient,

396
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:55,410
the device can inject a sedative or a lethal poison.

397
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,060
While allowing them to live among the general population

398
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,680
is harmful to the Area Stress levels,

399
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,920
we still haven't been able to

400
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,780
isolate our nation quite as well as Japan has,

401
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,890
thus this arrangement is only temporary.

402
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,290
Soldiers wear them too?

403
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,350
Yes... you might call them “Enforcers."

404
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,040
The entire officer corps has clean Hues,

405
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,580
so we can act as “Inspectors."

406
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,920
By the way, Inspector Tsunemori,

407
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,870
Yes?

408
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:31,510
If you plan to step outside Shamballa Float,

409
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:35,900
or enter important facilities, you must go with an escort of our choosing,

410
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,560
and coordinate your visits with us.

411
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,020
You need someone to come with me?

412
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,740
Will that be inconvenient?

413
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,380
No.

414
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,370
I'm an Inspector from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare's Bureau of Public Safety,

415
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,530
Inspector Tsunemori Akane.

416
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,240
I am Chuan Han.

417
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,400
I didn't think you'd come to greet me personally,

418
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,090
Chairman.

419
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,730
It simply means that we are very interested

420
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,890
in both you and your country.

421
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,810
You must be tired from your long journey. Please, sit.

422
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,290
Okay.

423
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,680
We would like your assistance in an international investigation...

424
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,960
The man you are pursuing,

425
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,590
is apparently a terrorist aiding the guerillas?

426
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,470
Yes, we suspect him of that.

427
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,740
This nation's efforts to take countermeasures against the guerillas are a stubborn effort at suppression;

428
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,650
we would not refer to it as an “investigation."

429
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,670
We will provide you with plenty of support, of course.

430
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,850
However, remember that the situation in this country

431
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,120
is fundamentally different from that of your own.

432
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,970
I only ask that you keep that in mind.

433
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,820
Understood.

434
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,710
Very well. Colonel?

435
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:02,900
I leave her in your care. Treat her well.

436
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,300
Leave it to me.

437
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,590
Open case.

438
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,930
Hm?

439
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,660
Sign: Open this if you're in a bind.

440
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:23,660
...Geez, come on, Shion.

441
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,670
Chuan Han, former Army general.

442
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,690
In the internal disunity that plagued the Union

443
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,970
12 years ago,
he was one of the generals competing for hegemony.

444
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,810
By making an agreement

445
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,330
to create a Sybil-controlled Special Ward within SEAUn,

446
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,670
he gained the backing of the Japanese government, and gained supremacy over his rivals.

447
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:57,190
It's been two years since he re-established the parliament and named himself Chairman.

448
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:02,170
But the voices of rebellion still cry out against the military government.

449
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,110
The situation within the country is still unstable.

450
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,010
The terrorists that came to Japan

451
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,330
were probably anti-government guerillas.

452
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:18,130
The foundation of Han's power base is the support of the Japanese government,

453
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,680
and as a result, Tokyo became the target of terrorists seeking revenge.

454
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,480
I will be taking care of your surroundings.

455
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,380
I am called Yeo. If you need anything,

456
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,260
please do not hesitate to ask.

457
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,260
If you would like something to eat, it would be no trouble
for me to prepare something for you right now.

458
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,500
If you plan to go out again,

459
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,240
I have been informed that as long as you do not

460
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,880
venture into secure areas or cross the bridge,

461
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
you may go wherever you wish.

462
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,120
I understand.

463
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,110
In one week's time, Sybil will

464
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,100
put restrictions on the alcohol trade,

465
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,780
so if you would like to sample some, now is your chance.

466
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,810
Um...

467
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,850
Yes?

468
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:15,660
Can you answer a personal question?

469
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,060
I will answer it if I'm able to.

470
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,290
Do you...

471
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,020
consider your life on Shamballa to be a happy one?

472
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,910
Of course.

473
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,090
Everyone who lives in this Special Ward

474
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,660
is thankful that Chairman Han

475
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,160
introduced the Sybil System.

476
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,750
After all,

477
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,030
there was no such thing as a safe place in this country until very recently.

478
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,180
This is not my fault! He did it!

479
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,600
How 'bout it?

480
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,590
All green.

481
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,690
Move out.

482
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,220
What?

483
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,040
Mind if I join you?

484
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,560
I don't mind, but don't do anything rash

485
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,320
when the fighting starts.

486
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,460
Of course. I understand.

487
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,360
What kind of operation is this?

488
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,620
The ruined old capital

489
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,890
is 50 kilometers north of here.

490
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:06,530
It's a ghost town now,

491
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,420
but yesterday, we learned that there is a high probability

492
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,990
that the anti-government guerillas have a base here.

493
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,530
I was under the impression that our drones

494
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,080
were being lent to you for peacekeeping purposes, am I right?

495
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,740
Do you intend to use them for something other than policing the Ward?

496
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,460
Taking care of latent threats is just another one of our duties.

497
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,700
It's nothing that goes against the agreement.

498
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,940
Shamballa Float is just the first step in

499
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,610
getting the Sybil System a foothold here.

500
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,780
We'll eventually have to expand its control

501
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,620
across the entire nation.

502
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,890
In order to do that, we must crush all armed opposition

503
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,290
and measure the Psycho-Passes of everyone in the country.

504
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,990
Commence attack!

505
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,290
Roger!

506
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:46,960
All units, switch to combat mode.

507
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
We are commencing our attack.

508
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,630
<i>Get to the point, hurry!</i>

509
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,380
This is horrible.

510
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,780
If the Cymatic Scan doesn't have a problem with it,

511
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,420
the safety gets unlocked.

512
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,280
Their Crime Coefficients

513
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,740
must be at least that of Latent Criminals.

514
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,190
There's no way that anybody's Psycho-Pass would

515
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:50,050
give good numbers in a situation like this!

516
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,300
It's kill or be killed.

517
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,130
And unfortunately, we have no form

518
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,740
of mental care to help rehabilitate these people.

519
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,140
In the new SEAUn,

520
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,230
only the citizens who are needed will remain.

521
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,670
These guys are,

522
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,920
to put it bluntly,

523
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,500
the leftovers of our civil war days.

524
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,670
Activating Skandas.
Commencing mobilization.

525
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,810
Lost communication with Ganga 02.

526
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,390
I think it was shot down.

527
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,370
We've also lost Ganga 03!

528
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:14,550
And also Ganga 01! It was shot down!

529
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,090
It's that guy.

530
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:34,280
Start the counterattack. Do exactly as I told you.

531
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,300
<i>Go! Let's move!</i>

532
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:49,070
We're losing control of the Ganeshas and Skandas

533
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:51,660
deployed at all points.

534
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,270
It doesn't matter. The drones will restart soon

535
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,620
and go into stand-alone mode.

536
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,420
They can't measure Psycho-Passes,

537
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,260
but it's fine as long as the Identify Friend-Foe system works.

538
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,330
Don't you think that restart time is what they're after?

539
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,530
All units have restarted.

540
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,830
Good. Commence counterattack.

541
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,490
Leave our escort units here, and commit the reserves.

542
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,000
What the hell are you doing?

543
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,600
Investigating the incident.

544
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,500
You need to stay with me!

545
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,860
I'll keep the enemy occupied here.

546
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,970
We're in control now!

547
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:33,120
But if you don't keep your eyes open, this could turn into a massacre!

548
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,200
It's been a while,

549
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,860
Kougami.

550
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:07,480
I can't say that I expected you to chase me all the way out here.

551
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,810
You're under arrest.

552
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:15,520
Arrest? Do you realize the situation we're in?

553
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,470
Are you the one who sent

554
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,420
terrorists to Japan?

555
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,190
What? What are you talking about?

556
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,160
Then...

557
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,650
Well, Inspector? Are you gonna stop me,

558
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,050
or let me go?

559
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:00,020
Jump in!

560
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,430
Kougami.

561
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:38,140
I'll cooperate with you.

562
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,470
Hey now.

563
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:42,990
It's only temporary.
Just for the investigation.

564
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:49,690
Got it, Inspector.

565
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,180
Colonel!

566
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,520
Remove her from the Identify Friend-Foe system!

567
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,980
But...

568
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,320
This is a battlefield. The mission has priority.

569
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,990
It'll take time. We have to send the system back to headquarters first.

570
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,290
No abdominal hernias.

571
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:31,500
No pelvic abnormalities.
The pubis is joined properly.

572
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,870
No lumbar vertebrae abnormalities.

573
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,070
No femoral abnormalities.

574
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,880
No abnormalities in the limbs.

575
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,410
Get me a neck brace.

576
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,180
Hurry up. We're moving out soon.

577
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:13,000
What's going on here?
Explain.

578
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:30,040
It's exactly what it looks like.

579
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,340
I'm taking part in the democratization of the country.

580
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:43,730
Where are you going next?

581
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:46,600
I'm going back to base camp.

582
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,740
By the way, Inspector.

583
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:01,830
Quit calling me that.

584
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,260
Have you met Chairman Han?

585
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,860
Oh, yeah. I met him yesterday.

586
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,900
Don't you think there's something off about him?

587
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,350
Huh?

588
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:17,480
I wonder what a dictator's

589
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,220
Crime Coefficient looks like?

590
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,370
So, the mission was a failure,

591
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:28,700
and our Japanese Inspector, Tsunemori, is missing?

592
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,220
Her conduct was tantamount to aiding the guerillas.

593
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,790
She acted completely without authorization!

594
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:37,400
Be that as it may,

595
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,570
she was a foreign guest in your custody.
This is a question of responsibility.

596
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,670
But!

597
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,380
I'm joking.

598
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,350
The Japanese government understands
the state this country is in.

599
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:56,920
You wouldn't expect them to send her here alone in that knowledge if her life mattered to them.

600
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:00,940
This situation is most regrettable.

601
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:06,030
If anything, Colonel, you should prepare yourself for even bigger trouble.

602
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:06,760
What?

603
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,080
It's entirely possible that she was sent here precisely

604
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,750
because they know that she's capable of surviving in these conditions.

605
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:20,280
I'm very interested in seeing how this plays out.

606
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:47,050
I have an urgent job for you.
Of course, there will be a reward.

607
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:52,290
I'm very grateful. We have more time than we know what to do with.

608
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:57,130
Near Siem Reap, there's a guerilla stronghold containing two Japanese.

609
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:02,130
One is a member of the group, the other, an Inspector from Tokyo who came to arrest him.

610
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,490
I want them taken care of.

611
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:09,760
The guerilla's one thing, but the Inspector too?

612
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,140
She's an agent of the Japanese government, right?

613
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:17,220
She looks as though she may get in the way. She's a hazard.

614
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,510
Here we go.

615
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,270
Since we got on board with Sybil,

616
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:25,730
how will we get our message out like this?

617
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:33,930
Thanks to Sybil, we have this paradise we call Shamballa.

618
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:38,480
You could live civilized lives here, if you wanted.

619
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:43,350
Just how long do you plan on playing savages
on your little island?

620
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:45,510
“At the level of the individual,

621
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:51,100
violence has a detoxifying effect.
It takes away the inferiority complexes,

622
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:56,460
and changes the contemplative and desperate attitude of native people.

623
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,810
Violence makes them fearless,

624
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:02,800
and restores their dignity in their own eyes."

625
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:06,110
You're not familiar with Frantz Fanon?

626
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:11,190
We're investigating the present whereabouts of the targets.
As soon as we find them...

627
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,160
Don't worry about it.

628
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,660
We mercenaries have our own intelligence network.

629
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,870
Most information can be bought with money or valuables.

630
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:24,500
Of course, I have to bill you for
the necessary expenses separately.

631
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,710
No problem.

632
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:32,660
I need military aircraft ground clearance
and IFF recognition codes.

633
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,880
Both the young and old are here, huh?

634
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,180
You're back, Kougami.

635
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,290
Who's she?

636
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:46,130
It's hard to explain,

637
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:50,320
but she isn't an enemy. She's a guest of mine, Sem.

638
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:56,160
Did Kougami show you the way too?

639
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,660
Then we're comrades.

640
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:02,810
I'm Sem. I act as the leader here.

641
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:06,890
I'm Tsunemori Akane. Nice to meet you.

642
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,110
I lost a lot of good men again. I'm sorry.

643
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:16,100
No.
If it weren't for you, we'd all be dead.

644
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,820
Is Gino doing well?

645
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,280
He became an Enforcer after that.

646
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,710
I see.

647
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,930
And what exactly are you doing in a place like this?

648
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:44,630
At first, I was looking for someplace quiet.

649
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,690
I was tired, you see.

650
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:55,780
But once I left the Sybil System,

651
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:59,000
I found that there weren't any quiet places left.

652
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,140
Everywhere around the world was a battlefield.

653
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:06,170
I thought I had prepared myself for that reality,

654
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,710
but I soon found out how naive I was.

655
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:10,480
I beat those survival instincts

656
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,580
into my body.

657
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,420
But why did you join the guerillas?

658
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,510
Soon after I came to this country,

659
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:22,720
Han's decrees

660
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,790
and the deployment of drones to hunt guerillas began.

661
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,670
So I decided to teach the guerillas

662
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,050
how to fight drones.

663
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:36,150
The drones are all made in Japan.

664
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:38,590
I know their weak points as well as

665
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:40,780
the best ways to defeat them.

666
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:47,660
But what do you hope to achieve by doing all this?

667
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:50,290
We may look like this now,

668
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:53,570
but at the time, it looked like we could win by toughing it out.

669
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,890
He might call himself “Chairman" now,

670
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:04,260
but Han is just a leader of one faction of the military.

671
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:08,270
He joined forces with Sybil

672
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:11,510
to get a leg up on his rivals.

673
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,070
His aim wasn't

674
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:20,470
to turn Shamballa Float into a paradise.

675
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,800
In all practicality, Han's real power

676
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,260
is the result of his faction being the strongest militarily.

677
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,200
We thought that would be his downfall.

678
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:46,760
The Sybil System is the basically the ultimate bureaucracy

679
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,850
and would be anathema to a dictator.

680
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:53,110
Once it got to the point where it could rule,

681
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:55,740
it would force everything into the system,

682
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:59,030
and leave the dictator powerless.

683
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:03,240
It was only a matter of time until Han figured out how terrifying Sybil could be

684
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,260
and we thought that once he realized that,

685
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,160
Shamballa Float would throw them out before they could finish construction.

686
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,040
That's what we thought a year ago, at least.

687
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,750
But... that isn't what happened.

688
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,280
Yeah.

689
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:24,680
Han opened up Shamballa to the experiment without a fight,

690
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:28,430
a floating paradise similar to Japan opened its gates,

691
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:32,190
and armed drones are still slaughtering

692
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,510
anti-government forces.

693
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,650
There has to be some angle we're not seeing

694
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:06,620
in the relationship between Han and Sybil.

695
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,970
But we can't give up

696
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:12,100
until we figure out what that is.

697
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,470
Is that what you call justice?

698
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:18,420
Ignore the law, involve anybody you can,

699
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,560
and continue to fight in order to satisfy your self-centered pride?

700
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:25,380
You sure learned how to talk back.

701
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,740
And you haven't changed at all.

702
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,780
Yeah... That's a relief.

703
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:39,480
So... you really didn't have anything to do with

704
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,550
the terrorists sent to Japan?

705
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:43,360
I do remember some who were saying that we should

706
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,080
take revenge on Japan, because it was where Sybil was based.

707
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:49,470
Sem and I were opposed to it

708
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:52,850
and they ended up leaving our camp

709
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:57,180
but they didn't seem like the types who would be able to cross the ocean on their own.

710
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,610
There's no mistaking them.

711
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:07,990
Samlin, Ma, Shim; it's those guys.

712
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:11,290
They had advanced hacking tools,

713
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:15,700
as well as the connections necessary to get in touch with a fence at the Waste Block.

714
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,660
Doesn't something seem off?

715
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:21,480
You're right.

716
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:25,380
I can only imagine that someone was guiding them.

717
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,340
Kougami.

718
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:32,250
Looks like both of us

719
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:36,960
have bitten off way more than we can chew.

720
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:43,690
Stay here tonight.

721
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:44,860
Tomorrow morning,

722
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:47,660
we'll get you to within walking distance of Shamballa Float.

723
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:51,780
If you stay quiet, you shouldn't be in any danger.

724
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:54,910
Would it be too much to ask you to turn yourself in?

725
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,290
Please,

726
01:04:57,290 --> 01:05:00,350
don't tell Sem or the others that you're a detective.

727
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:02,250
If they find out you're involved with the government,

728
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,960
even they won't be able to ignore that.

729
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,770
Hey, it's already past time.

730
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,770
All clear.

731
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,790
Get moving.

732
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:26,320
Roger that.

733
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,320
Roger that.

734
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,680
The terrorists who came to Japan

735
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,550
had some rare paper books with them.

736
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:19,520
Proust's <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>.

737
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,400
I'll bet that was mine.

738
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,810
When Samlin was still here,

739
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:27,270
he kept bugging me about wanting to read it.

740
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:32,480
I thought I'd lost it, but I guess he took it.

741
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,950
The man named Sem,

742
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:38,120
he told me that you “showed him the way."

743
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,620
Are you sure you're not their spiritual leader

744
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:45,360
and not just a tactical advisor?

745
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:50,910
To be honest, it doesn't sit right with me, and it doesn't suit me.

746
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:53,400
But, it seems like the guys here

747
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,620
have been influenced too much by my words and behavior.

748
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:01,240
Even if you're not intending for it to happen,

749
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,410
you've got the ability to draw people to you;

750
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:06,180
it's almost like gravity.

751
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:09,670
It's just like Makishima Shougo.

752
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,150
Do we look similar to you?

753
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:19,370
You could accurately predict his next moves better than anyone else.

754
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:22,870
It wouldn't be unusual if you also possessed similar

755
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:25,110
talents and character traits.

756
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,210
At the very least, my words never

757
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:32,110
steered anyone wrong while I was still back in Japan.

758
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,950
So why now?

759
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:39,240
It's because you've changed the way you live your life.

760
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,460
Even if you can't see it,

761
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,060
the place you stand right now

762
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:49,670
is no different from where Makishima Shougo stood before.

763
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:54,570
Are you trying to say I'll become him?

764
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:55,980
No.

765
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:00,240
But I'd be willing to bet that people who want what you

766
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,700
and Makishima Shougo do will keep appearing.

767
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:06,710
The people who are angry and frustrated at society

768
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:11,170
are looking to pin their hopes on something...

769
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:12,870
I'm afraid they might try to

770
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:16,880
put you on a pedestal like they did to Makishima.

771
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,840
Sounds like a pain in the ass.

772
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:24,160
But you aren't the kind of guy who wants to control people's hearts.

773
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,540
That's the biggest difference between
you and Makishima Shougo.

774
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:35,330
If that's really what you thought of him,

775
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:38,890
then it's no wonder he's giving me so much trouble.

776
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:59,240
<i><Enemy attack! There are flames rising in the direction of Bayon!</i>

777
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:09,000
Acquiring.

778
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,960
Weber, Babangida, keep sniffing around for them.

779
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,940
Copy that!

780
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,370
Break out the ECM!

781
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,490
Yuria, did you find the target?

782
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:04,010
Not yet.

783
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,440
Shit, only small fry here.

784
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,400
Hey, Boone!

785
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:15,780
That's fine. Search for the targets.

786
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,070
Roger.

787
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:30,140
These tactics are different from the military's.

788
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:31,810
How so?

789
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:32,890
They're not relying on drones;

790
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:35,520
They're highly trained special forces.

791
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,760
I've got a bad feeling about this.

792
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:44,280
Sem, where's my ECM?

793
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,980
They've seized the controls!

794
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:48,360
We're trying to stall them!

795
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,450
Sem!

796
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:51,910
We'll have her escape.

797
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:56,380
Kougami!

798
01:11:56,380 --> 01:12:00,050
You need to leave without me.
We'll hold them off.

799
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:01,980
I'm not leaving alone!

800
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,480
Your criminal investigation

801
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,940
might get to the bottom of Han's crimes!

802
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:07,690
It's an opportunity for us.

803
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:10,060
Go back to Shamballa, and continue your mission!

804
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:11,010
But!

805
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:14,960
Don't worry.
Do you really think I'll die that easily?

806
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:18,670
If we both survive this,

807
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:21,590
come try to catch me again.

808
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,010
Sure.

809
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:03,300
Sem!

810
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,770
Go, Kougami!

811
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:14,750
Sem, get outta there!

812
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:17,200
I can't abandon a friend!

813
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:25,000
Sem!

814
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:45,480
Target Delta identified! Open fire!

815
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,390
Wait.
What about Target Juliet?

816
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:12,260
Signal lost. She's getting away.

817
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:13,800
Do you want me to chase her?

818
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,470
No, it's too late.

819
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:19,850
Get me Delta alive instead. Don't kill him.
I'll be right there.

820
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:21,340
Roger.

821
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,880
You're quite something.

822
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:07,300
You'll regret it if you don't kill me now.

823
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:14,390
Terrifying! Unfortunately, we have some important questions to ask you.

824
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,860
You may be an important guest of ours,

825
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,340
but there is a limit to our patience.

826
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:36,540
An “important guest?"

827
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,800
You tried to kill me!

828
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,980
It's because you were operating alongside the guerillas.

829
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,840
That was part of the investigation.

830
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:48,950
Why can't you understand that this is <i>our</i> country?

831
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:50,980
You will be jailed

832
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:55,640
and sent home immediately on the next flight to Japan.

833
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:07,320
Colonel, I'd rather you not decide important matters
without me.

834
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,830
Mister Chairman!

835
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,130
There is no need to deport her.

836
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:16,470
Simply put her under observation and return her to
her quarters.

837
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:17,360
But!

838
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,840
Silence!

839
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:20,970
It is not as if

840
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:25,790
I do not have issues with some of the Military Police's conduct as of late.

841
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:29,300
Also, I <i>am</i> the Commander-in-Chief.

842
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:33,180
Yes sir.

843
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,860
Well then...

844
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:02,620
Excuse me, Miss Tsunemori.

845
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,610
I see you have returned to your room,

846
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:07,190
so I have come to prepare your meal.

847
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,590
Thank you, Yeo.

848
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:12,790
I'll take my meal after my shower.

849
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:16,200
Yes, certainly.

850
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:21,710
Hm? Akane?

851
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,970
Sorry about this, Shion.

852
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:25,140
Can you hear me?

853
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:27,140
Yes, of course.

854
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:30,310
Looks like the program I gave you is working properly.

855
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:32,430
So, what is it?

856
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:34,820
Is it possible to systematically

857
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,500
inspect the Psycho-Pass diagnosis

858
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:40,690
equipment that the Public Saftey Bureau
gave Shamballa Float?

859
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:41,550
Sure.

860
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,080
It should be just fine if we use the Pillbugs, I think.

861
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,830
What do you hope to find?

862
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:48,410
The Sybil System is

863
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:50,960
in use over there, right?
In that case...

864
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,350
There's a possibility

865
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:55,350
that the system is not being used fairly.

866
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,500
Check the Ward's equipment,

867
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:00,300
and make sure you take a close look at the Military Police.

868
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:03,740
I need you to figure out ASAP if Cymatic Scans

869
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,250
are being measured accurately.

870
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,250
A detective's gut feeling... I take it?

871
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:15,310
It's not that.
It's just a conclusion I've drawn after looking at the facts.

872
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:21,060
All right. I'll inspect the hell out of this.

873
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,950
Oh, and one more thing.

874
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:27,200
The collars being used to manage Latent Criminals on Shamballa Float

875
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,030
are made in Japan, right?

876
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:33,040
Do you think you could get me a code to unlock them

877
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,600
under the Public Safety Bureau's authority?

878
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,880
Sounds simple enough, but will you be all right?

879
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,750
I don't think the Military Police will appreciate that.

880
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:43,210
I'm way past the phase where I make my decisions

881
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:45,670
just so I can please people.

882
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:50,080
Your meal is now ready.

883
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,290
Thank you.

884
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,350
Don't say a word.

885
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,150
Th-this is...

886
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:15,270
Calm down and listen to what I have to say.

887
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:17,650
I need your coopera...

888
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,650
tion...

889
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:31,040
This is...

890
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:52,410
I did just as you said!

891
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:56,540
You'll really remove my brother's collar now, won't you?

892
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:58,980
I'll have a good think about it.

893
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:10,300
Don't kill the girl yet.

894
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:14,270
I'll arrange for her to die with our guerilla military adversaries.

895
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:18,090
This should avoid any unnecessary suspicion.

896
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:21,740
I knew you guys

897
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:24,840
weren't undergoing

898
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,650
Cymatic Scans.

899
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,650
Oh?

900
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:32,890
Do you have proof?

901
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,650
You just killed someone, for god's sake!

902
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:40,960
As long as the Sybil System doesn't bitch about it,

903
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,710
it's not a crime.

904
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,070
Am I right?

905
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,400
Hey, did you buy them all?

906
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,880
These aren't regular army methods. Are you mercenaries?

907
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,630
You surprised me.

908
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:33,780
The guerilla military advisor, whom we've heard so much about, is a Japanese.

909
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:37,320
I was under the impression that the whole country had been turned into

910
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:40,350
spineless, phony wimps by the Sybil System.

911
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:45,970
Well, it's true that I don't have a place there anymore.

912
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:52,820
Did you decide to quit government work after getting professional training?

913
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:55,530
But you're still only a third rate mercenary.

914
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:59,490
After all, you still haven't grasped how to choose the right employer.

915
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:03,870
Don't lump me in with you hyenas.

916
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:05,850
I don't live my life sniffing for

917
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:08,210
blood in the water.

918
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:09,810
Oh, really now?

919
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:12,590
If you really were a detective, that's bullshit.

920
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:14,090
There are some who chant slogans,

921
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:17,430
saying that violence is both the law and just.

922
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:25,330
When society begins to collapse, violence becomes increasingly privatized.

923
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:28,570
That's because the state has monopolized

924
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:31,030
organized violence.

925
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:35,570
When violence begins to spread, it leaves the realm of politics.

926
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:41,690
The organized violence becomes an economic activity, with societal unrest at its heart.

927
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:54,260
<i>The Wretched of the Earth</i>, huh?

928
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:56,900
A mercenary obsessed with Post-Colonialism is something

929
01:23:56,900 --> 01:24:01,140
I'd rather not deal with...

930
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:04,910
Oh, you have brains as well as brawn, do you?

931
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:07,340
This is getting even more interesting.

932
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,490
From what I've heard, it sounds as though

933
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:17,740
those guerillas really took a shine to you.

934
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:22,480
Did you whisper sweet nothings into their ears?

935
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:30,320
No idea.

936
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:34,120
But still, I've gotta wonder.

937
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:40,130
As I talk to you, I'm strangely getting into a better mood.

938
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:43,460
It's like I'm listening to Wagner or something.

939
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:53,650
Those are words

940
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:56,830
I'd rather hear from a glamorous woman instead.

941
01:24:56,830 --> 01:25:00,100
Hearing it from a guy just makes my skin crawl.

942
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,290
You should be thankful for

943
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:07,110
the advice of your elders!

944
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:14,300
But that ability of yours is very precious, Mister Japanese.

945
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:17,180
You'd make a very good agitator.

946
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:20,780
You can incite rage and focus resentment;

947
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:23,620
that's a special kind of charisma.

948
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,390
Although it's modest,

949
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:31,660
we've been

950
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:34,970
managing our own little community.

951
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:39,990
We need to build our forces first, but we want to form our own faction.

952
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:42,580
And when that happens, we'll need

953
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,970
not only leadership,

954
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:49,410
but the ability to fire up the crowds and captivate them.

955
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:54,000
How 'bout it? Do you feel like joining us?

956
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,610
If we hone your abilities,

957
01:25:56,610 --> 01:26:01,180
I can get you a squadron that you can use
to your heart's content.

958
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:02,720
Hey, boss!

959
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:08,390
If I go ahead and give you up to my client, you're dead anyway.

960
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:10,040
I'm saying that

961
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,680
I'm giving you a chance to live.

962
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:18,000
Don't expect me to thank you for offering me an option

963
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,150
I'd rather die than accept.

964
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:31,330
Hey, someone. Give him treatment.

965
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:35,040
Is he still alive? The male target.

966
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,810
Yeah. Can I kill him yet?

967
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:39,500
He still has some use.

968
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,960
Bring him to me.

969
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,740
Understood.

970
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:49,270
I would've liked to give you some time to change your mind,

971
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:52,880
but unfortunately, you're out of luck.

972
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:38,420
Kougami...

973
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:42,420
“The Japanese terrorist who joined the guerillas

974
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,320
managed to break free while being escorted,

975
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,780
took Inspector Tsunemori hostage and seized a helicopter.

976
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:50,760
He attempted to commit terrorist acts against the State,

977
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:55,060
and in our attempt to thwart him, we reluctantly shot the helicopter down."

978
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:57,860
That's how it'll go.

979
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:02,360
It sure is a waste to destroy one helicopter to kill two people.

980
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:06,510
This was all the result of a Public Safety Bureau Inspector's mistake.

981
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:08,880
We can petition Japan to reimburse us for damages.

982
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:11,990
I want to get rid of them quickly.

983
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:15,930
It's fine as long as we find some of their
remains in the wreckage.

984
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:19,760
Kill both of them. Now.

985
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:36,520
Do you really think you can keep hiding all of this?

986
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,080
How are you going to explain this to Chairman Han?

987
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:41,330
The Chairman?

988
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:43,550
The Japanese Government won't stay quiet about this either.

989
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:46,250
They're sure to do a detailed investigation.

990
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:49,320
What a pitiful stooge.

991
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:52,720
She knew not what her master's right hand was doing

992
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:55,450
while allowing the left hand to work her to the bone.

993
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:58,290
Hey, Miss, what would you say if I said that

994
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:01,940
we're actually operating according to the Japanese government's plan?

995
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:02,710
What?

996
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:04,650
Isn't that right, Colonel?

997
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:08,240
We took out Chairman Han at your request,

998
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:12,580
and apparently the Japanese government provided the body double who replaced him.

999
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:13,610
Hey!

1000
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:16,080
Don't let another word slip!

1001
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:19,540
Shoot them, now!

1002
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:40,650
Hey, Nicholas...

1003
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:42,230
What the hell is it doing?

1004
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:44,820
This is the Public Safety Bureau Investigative Division.

1005
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:48,670
According to paragraph three of the Sybil System Treaty,

1006
01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:51,120
and the powers vested in us by paragraph five,

1007
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,580
the Japanese government will now be restoring public order.

1008
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:57,600
Persons who exceed the Crime Coefficient threshold may be

1009
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,330
eliminated without warning in some cases.

1010
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:05,330
Please purge all thoughts of resistance, calm down,
and return your mental state to stability.

1011
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:08,180
We repeat,

1012
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:10,900
this is the Public Safety Bureau Investigative Division.

1013
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:13,360
According to paragraph three of the Sybil System Treaty...

1014
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,340
The Japanese Public Safety Bureau?

1015
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,710
These outsiders

1016
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:21,010
don't know anything!

1017
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:24,360
Crime Coefficient is over 380.

1018
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:28,090
Enforcement Mode: Lethal Eliminator.

1019
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,700
Boss!

1020
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,610
Kougami.

1021
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:52,470
Tsunemori, you find the Chairman.

1022
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:56,850
Okay.

1023
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:04,870
Descending!

1024
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,460
Are you all right, Inspector?

1025
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:15,920
Why are you guys here...?

1026
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,140
Karanomori was able to determine from

1027
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:20,100
the Pillbug's data...

1028
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:23,590
...that the Street Scanners here have all been illegally modified.

1029
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:25,930
This place is a nest of Latent Criminals.

1030
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:29,690
How did they do it?

1031
01:32:29,690 --> 01:32:33,920
They managed to insert the data from their IFF system

1032
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,030
into their Hue scans.

1033
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:41,660
Anybody judged as friendly by the IFF wouldn't be targeted by the scanners.

1034
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:43,430
Nearly everyone in the Military Police

1035
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:47,330
was able to fake their Psycho-Pass using this method.

1036
01:32:47,330 --> 01:32:49,460
They were able to fool the Sybil System

1037
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:52,000
using such a brazen trick?

1038
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,750
Sybil wasn't fooled, obviously.

1039
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:57,340
They were merely being tolerated.

1040
01:32:57,340 --> 01:33:02,240
Exposing the Military Police all at once was Sybil's goal all along.

1041
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,800
If you'd guessed that in the first place,

1042
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:06,520
you wouldn't have had to go through all this trouble.

1043
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,520
You sure love doing things the
roundabout way don't you, Senpai?

1044
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,480
What do you mean?

1045
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:14,030
You don't even need a Cymatic Scan

1046
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:17,360
to figure out what these guys were thinking.

1047
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,550
Even so,

1048
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:21,490
we had no choice but to use them until SEAUn

1049
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:23,570
had enough infrastructure to support Sybil.

1050
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:26,600
Once Shamballa Float was complete,

1051
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,390
they would have fulfilled their usefulness.

1052
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:31,660
Then we'd just need to find evidence of their wrongdoing and dispose of them.

1053
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:35,610
The whole part about pursuing an escaped Enforcer

1054
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,850
was just an excuse to send you away.

1055
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:42,540
And you're totally okay with all of this?

1056
01:33:43,130 --> 01:33:46,160
It takes those who are capable to do what needs to be done.

1057
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:49,470
Basically, get your head out of your ass, Senpai.

1058
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:58,220
In that case, let's do what needs to be done.

1059
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:06,080
Dominator Portable Psychological Diagnosis and Suppression System

1060
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,990
has been activated.

1061
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:12,660
User authentication: Inspector Tsunemori Akane.

1062
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,840
You are a valid user.

1063
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:16,260
Inspector Shimotsuki,

1064
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,220
you'll take Kunizuka, Hinakawa, and Sugou,

1065
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,130
and take command of the site.

1066
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:22,260
Okay.

1067
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:25,260
I'm going to arrest the Chairman.

1068
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,060
You're coming with me, Ginoza.

1069
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:28,100
Roger.

1070
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,250
This isn't time to be playing around.

1071
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:06,870
You'll be in danger if you don't get out of here soon.

1072
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:14,140
Or maybe you can't work up the motivation

1073
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:17,600
unless you're chasing your prey?

1074
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:20,120
Oh my.

1075
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:24,280
You truly are a bloodhound, down to your very bones,
aren't you?

1076
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:27,610
Do you really think I can let a guy who wants to form his own military force

1077
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:29,950
get away scot-free?

1078
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:32,560
What good does it do to believe that bullshit?

1079
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,130
Besides, even if you hadn't gotten involved,

1080
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:38,240
he would've ended up destroying himself anyway.

1081
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:43,880
What is it that drives you?

1082
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:47,430
Your sense of justice?

1083
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:49,420
That's not it...

1084
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:52,350
There are thousands of men like him.

1085
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:56,860
Killing a guy like him wouldn't change a damn thing.

1086
01:35:56,860 --> 01:36:00,960
Even so, you continue to risk your life by hounding him.

1087
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,960
Why are you so tenacious?

1088
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,220
The dead need to stay silent!

1089
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:26,780
I'm going it alone from here.

1090
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,320
What's going on?

1091
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:31,830
I want you to chase down Kougami.

1092
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,350
Meaning,

1093
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:37,730
I can deal with him however I'd like?

1094
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:39,630
I'll leave it to you.

1095
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:56,320
You aren't a detective, are you?

1096
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,230
I'm a <i>former</i> detective.

1097
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,500
That's not what I meant.

1098
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:05,990
I meant you were born to be something different.

1099
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:57,560
Crime Coefficient is zero.

1100
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:02,980
He is not an enforcement target. The trigger will be locked.

1101
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:07,440
Criminally Asymptomatic... I knew it.

1102
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,220
You figured it out?

1103
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:14,060
Someone revealed to me that you were a body double.

1104
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:17,740
But I doubt he knew

1105
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:22,380
that Japan's Ministries are already full of body doubles.

1106
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:23,850
Yes...

1107
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:27,280
Colonel Nicholas thought

1108
01:38:27,670 --> 01:38:32,010
that I was merely a person who had

1109
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:34,550
undergone plastic surgery.

1110
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:39,240
As it turns out, the current me

1111
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:43,050
has only known him for about two days.

1112
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:50,250
You see, I came to SEAUn on the same flight you did.

1113
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:54,240
Switching bodies is a pain when you have to cross the ocean.

1114
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:58,540
So it's just as Inspector Shimotsuki guessed.

1115
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:02,520
It's all gone according to your plan, hasn't it,

1116
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:05,440
Sybil System?

1117
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:09,550
Colonel Nicholas' aim was to complete

1118
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:12,480
the construction of Shamballa Float, even

1119
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,720
if he had to overcome Han's opposition to it.

1120
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:22,330
Japan offered up its unmanned weapons systems in exchange,

1121
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:27,720
which ended up becoming our trump card in taking control of SEAUn.

1122
01:39:28,530 --> 01:39:32,030
We were attracted to the concept of setting up a model city

1123
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:36,570
overseas that made use of the Sybil System.

1124
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:40,100
What both parties needed was a

1125
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:42,470
cooperative Chairman who would support

1126
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:45,660
and greenlight the project.

1127
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:49,610
Staging a foreign intervention...

1128
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:54,030
conspiring to assassinate the real Chairman Han...

1129
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:57,510
those are clearly criminal acts!

1130
01:39:57,510 --> 01:40:01,160
This nation, for all intents and purposes,

1131
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:04,270
had no organized government.

1132
01:40:04,270 --> 01:40:10,260
Corruption. Discrimination. Racial strife that was almost religious in nature.

1133
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:14,240
Two years ago, SEAUn was

1134
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:18,320
a group of “allied nations" in name only.

1135
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:22,160
All you wanted to do was expand the Sybil System's area of control.

1136
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,140
We do not possess the simple

1137
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:27,540
lust to expand our dominion that you believe we do.

1138
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:31,260
“The greatest happiness of the greatest number."

1139
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:35,870
In other words, it depends on how you define the extents.

1140
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:41,750
You have judged our actions to be criminal behavior.

1141
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:45,160
However, a crime is merely a deviation from the law.

1142
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,350
Laws don't simply exist for their own sake.

1143
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:52,030
The law wouldn't exist without the support of the people.

1144
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:55,860
You've seized this country,

1145
01:40:55,860 --> 01:40:58,930
but you haven't received the consent of the people.

1146
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:01,820
All you've done is fool a dictator and lie your way in.

1147
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:06,770
In order to bring peace and quiet to a people

1148
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:09,850
constantly at risk of starvation or slaughter,

1149
01:41:09,850 --> 01:41:13,540
it was necessary to take the fastest measures possible.

1150
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:20,410
We deemed this to be the fastest and most optimal way of doing things.

1151
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:25,270
You need to resign, Chairman Han.

1152
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:29,900
And in a free election, select a new leader.

1153
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:32,770
You need to discuss the pros and cons of bringing in the Sybil System,

1154
01:41:32,770 --> 01:41:35,510
and decide based on the consensus of the people.

1155
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:39,690
And if the people of this nation reject us?

1156
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:43,030
If, of their own will, the people opt to throw away this brief peace

1157
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:49,040
and this shining city of dreams?

1158
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:52,580
What's worth protecting

1159
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:56,740
is something that can only be decided of your own volition.

1160
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:59,860
Don't just force them to obey,

1161
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:02,600
but make them want to

1162
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:05,550
take the law and continue to protect it.

1163
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:09,940
I reluctantly understand your

1164
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:14,190
stubborn insistence on

1165
01:42:14,190 --> 01:42:17,390
protecting our transparent little farce,

1166
01:42:18,030 --> 01:42:20,590
but perhaps we only

1167
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:22,740
value our consensus

1168
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:25,570
because you have asked us to do so.

1169
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:30,440
The abilities to approve of one's society and change it

1170
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:34,930
are rights people have long

1171
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:37,580
shed blood over in order to attain them.

1172
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:43,760
Have some respect for history,

1173
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:47,420
Sybil System.

1174
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:10,060
Pretty good, Mister Japanese.

1175
01:44:08,010 --> 01:44:09,790
Surrender!

1176
01:44:57,230 --> 01:44:58,730
Kougami...

1177
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:06,850
I owe you one.

1178
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,330
Gino...

1179
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,330
Leave. Now.

1180
01:45:10,330 --> 01:45:13,370
And don't ever show your face around us again.

1181
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:16,010
Don't make Inspector Tsunemori

1182
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:18,950
shoulder more burdens than she already has.

1183
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,880
Are you okay with this?

1184
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:31,830
I've learned how to compromise.

1185
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:41,550
We're even now.

1186
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:52,580
The day before yesterday

1187
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:56,460
involved a coup d'etat by the commander of the Military Police.

1188
01:45:56,460 --> 01:46:02,310
Colonel Wong has given me deep concerns about my leadership in the current government.

1189
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:07,320
And, after reflecting seriously on my responsibilities,

1190
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:09,460
I, Chuwan Han,

1191
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:12,420
hereby declare my intention

1192
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:14,680
to step down.

1193
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:19,710
hereby declare my intention to step down.

1194
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:25,590
What does that mean?

1195
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:31,720
It means we may not need our guns anymore.

1196
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:37,940
Finally. Geez.

1197
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,460
What honeyed words did you whisper into his ear?

1198
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:48,410
I didn't, really. I just asked him to make the optimal decision.

1199
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:50,900
You look like

1200
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:55,160
you're thinking over something that's way bigger than you.

1201
01:46:56,220 --> 01:47:00,290
Kougami disappeared again, didn't he?

1202
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:05,320
Sorry, my Dominator got destroyed at the last minute.

1203
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:07,080
My mistake.

1204
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:09,860
It wouldn't be like him to shoot you

1205
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:12,070
and run away.

1206
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,110
He's changed.

1207
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:18,270
He's just a common scoundrel now.

1208
01:47:19,370 --> 01:47:22,830
He's no longer worth your attention.

1209
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:27,330
Just leave him alone;
he'll wind up dead somewhere eventually.

1210
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:28,960
Ginoza,

1211
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,910
you haven't changed, have you?

1212
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:35,950
You're always trying to carry the burden.

1213
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:40,350
Excuse me, Inspector Tsunemori.

1214
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:42,810
We are ready to leave.

1215
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:44,380
Okay.

1216
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:52,570
Well then, we leave the rest to you.

1217
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:54,510
Yes!

1218
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:26,540
The fairy-tale

1219
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:30,550
has died just now

1220
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:35,890
I couldn't sing it well

1221
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:40,970
in this brick hospital

1222
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:46,100
The foggy night,

1223
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:51,690
let the red moon float

1224
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:57,070
Look at me

1225
01:48:57,910 --> 01:49:02,620
Keep eyes on me

1226
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,920
Behind these iron bars

1227
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:09,630
I was born

1228
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:12,050
Pray for what deserves for your malice

1229
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,920
And as you wish, to you

1230
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:17,590
I will bring justice

1231
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:20,100
Destroy them, before they destroy us

1232
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:24,390
We'll pay for our karma and go together,

1233
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:30,150
nameless monster

1234
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:46,640
My ears are ringing

1235
01:49:45,890 --> 01:49:50,650
The barbed-wires are noisy

1236
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:55,990
I can't remember the melody

1237
01:49:56,860 --> 01:50:01,070
on that day

1238
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:06,200
Still rain has not stopped

1239
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:11,790
I can't see anything

1240
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:17,170
See,

1241
01:50:18,010 --> 01:50:22,720
it is now this big

1242
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:27,020
Let the sky rain the black rain

1243
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:29,730
I am a being of undesired

1244
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:32,150
a cracked neruroic

1245
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:35,020
To beloved bystanders with the same guilt

1246
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:37,690
now excercise justice

1247
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:40,200
Embracing my unerasable scars

1248
01:50:40,030 --> 01:50:44,490
accepting this body - let's go together,

1249
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:50,250
nameless monster

1250
01:51:06,890 --> 01:51:09,510
Ah

1251
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:19,650
The God sentences

1252
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:28,320
the true world

1253
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:52,440
Behind these iron bars

1254
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:55,150
I was born

1255
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:57,570
Pray for what deserves for your malice

1256
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:00,440
And as you wish, to you

1257
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:03,110
I will bring justice

1258
01:52:02,910 --> 01:52:05,620
Destroy them, before they destroy us

1259
01:52:05,450 --> 01:52:09,910
Pay for your karma and repay,

1260
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:10,660
nameless monster

1261
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:13,680
Let the sky rain the black rain

1262
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:16,390
I am a being of undesired

1263
01:52:16,180 --> 01:52:18,810
a cracked neruroic

1264
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:21,680
To beloved bystanders with the same guilt

1265
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:24,350
now excercise justice

1266
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:26,860
Embracing my unerasable scars

1267
01:52:26,690 --> 01:52:31,150
accepting this body - let's go together,

1268
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:36,910
nameless monster

1269
01:53:08,470 --> 01:53:13,470
<i>With 40% of the votes counted, the results of the</i>

1270
01:53:13,470 --> 01:53:16,190
<i>SEAUn Council Chairman election have been announced.</i>

1271
01:53:16,190 --> 01:53:19,680
<i>Currently, the former Chairman, Mister Han,</i>

1272
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:24,400
<i>is pushing aside his challengers with an overwhelming number of votes.</i>

1273
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:31,780
The world under the System is evolving.

1274
01:53:25,990 --> 01:53:27,730
One day,

1275
01:53:27,730 --> 01:53:31,100
this System's true worth will be tested.

1276
