00:40:21,492 --> 00:40:22,903
So a closed loop like that

517
00:40:23,061 --> 00:40:26,167
will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

518
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,311
But how big do these levels have to be?

519
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,608
It could be anything
from the floor of a building to an entire city

520
00:40:31,771 --> 00:40:35,218
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections

521
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,787
- A maze?
- Right, a maze

522
00:40:36,944 --> 00:40:38,287
And the better the maze

523
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:41,153
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

524
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:42,590
Exactly

525
00:40:43,251 --> 00:40:46,893
My subconscious seems polite enough
Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

526
00:40:47,056 --> 00:40:49,969
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

I don't know if he can't, but he won't

529
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:58,479
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn’t know the layouts

He won’t tell me. But I think it's Mal

No, not his ex

00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:08,219
They're still together?
No.

534
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:10,951
No, she's dead

535
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,662
What you see in there

536
00:41:19,194 --> 00:41:20,673
What was she like in real life?

She was lovely

No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb

546
00:41:49,764 --> 00:41:53,338
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

547
00:41:53,502 --> 00:41:57,473
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative

Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject

which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

Can we run with that?

00:50:33,758 --> 00:50:37,365
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man

676
00:50:37,529 --> 00:50:41,000
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

- I just don't know.

1027
01:14:57,673 --> 01:15:00,017
he called me into his deathbed

1028
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,354
He could barely speak

1029
01:15:03,414 --> 01:15:07,659
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing

1030
01:15:10,155 --> 01:15:11,794
He pulled me close

1031
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,566
And I could only make out

1032
01:15:17,431 --> 01:15:18,876

You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

Truth? What truth?

The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

1039
01:15:43,495 --> 01:15:47,569
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

1040
01:15:47,733 --> 01:15:50,145
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer

1041
01:15:50,303 --> 01:15:52,113
we're also going deeper into you

1042
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:56,217
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find

1043
01:16:00,215 --> 01:16:01,695
We were working together

1044
01:16:01,851 --> 01:16:05,526
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

1045
01:16:05,721 --> 01:16:06,996
I kept pushing things

1046
01:16:07,157 --> 01:16:10,832
I wanted to go deeper and deeper
I wanted to go further.

1047
01:16:11,328 --> 01:16:16,210
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

1048
01:16:16,367 --> 01:16:19,110
That we could get trapped so deep

1049
01:16:19,938 --> 01:16:23,250
that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

1050
01:16:23,843 --> 01:16:26,380
We lost sight of what was real

1051
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:35,025
We created.
We built the world for ourselves

1052
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:38,661
We did that for years

01:16:56,482 --> 01:16:59,125
It wasn't so had at first
feeling like gods.

1059
01:16:59,179 --> 01:17:00,918
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

1060
01:17:00,946 --> 01:17:05,356
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

1061
01:17:05,519 --> 01:17:06,921
And what about for her?

1062
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:14,300
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

1063
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:20,943
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

1064
01:17:23,876 --> 01:17:26,381

Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

1067
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:39,299
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

1068
01:17:40,195 --> 01:17:43,970
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

1069
01:17:45,337 --> 01:17:47,607
Eventually, she told me the truth.

1070
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:51,413
She was possessed by an idea.

01:17:51,577 --> 01:17:57,289
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

1072
01:17:58,419 --> 01:18:00,891
That our world wasn't real.

1073
01:18:01,824 --> 01:18:06,099
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

1074
01:18:06,629 --> 01:18:09,001
...that in order to get back home...

1075
01:18:10,234 --> 01:18:12,036
...we had to kill ourselves.

01:18:18,678 --> 01:18:22,152

- She thought they were projections...

1077
01:18:22,315 --> 01:18:25,321
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

MAL: I'm their mother!
COBB: Calm down.

01:18:27,354 --> 01:18:28,624
I can tell the difference.

why can't I control this?

01:18:33,161 --> 01:18:35,367

there was nothing I could do...

1083
01:18:35,532 --> 01:18:39,374
...no matter how much I begged,

but she could not do it alone.

Just step back inside now, come on.

No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

01:19:30,134 --> 01:19:31,837
No, I'm not.

Now, you listen to me.

remember? You're gonna die.

01:19:41,215 --> 01:19:43,953
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

- Okay.

01:19:59,605 --> 01:20:00,773
All right?

- No, honey.

1100
01:20:06,981 --> 01:20:09,988
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1101
01:20:10,152 --> 01:20:12,924
Take a second, think about our children.

1102
01:20:13,089 --> 01:20:14,827
Think about James.

1103
01:20:15,558 --> 01:20:17,194
Think about Phillipa, now.

01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,300
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1105
01:20:20,464 --> 01:20:23,771
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

1106
01:20:24,201 --> 01:20:27,542
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

How you've threatened to kill me.

- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1109
01:20:37,518 --> 01:20:39,288
Why did-? Why would you do this to me?

1110
01:20:39,453 --> 01:20:42,326
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1111
01:20:42,491 --> 01:20:45,532
We're going home to our real children.

1112
01:20:45,696 --> 01:20:49,336
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1113
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,803
You're waiting for a train.

1114
01:20:51,303 --> 01:20:54,876
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

1115
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:57,045
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1116

will take you, but you can't know for sure.

- But it doesn't matter.

1118
01:21:03,584 --> 01:21:06,792
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

01:21:06,956 --> 01:21:10,798

She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1122
01:21:19,805 --> 01:21:24,015
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

Your guilt defines her.

that we'd grow old together.

1690
02:13:02,971 --> 02:13:04,473
But we did.

1691
02:13:06,406 --> 02:13:08,779
We did. You don't remember?

1692
02:13:13,450 --> 02:13:16,289
I miss you more than I can bear...

1693
02:13:18,656 --> 02:13:20,659
...but we had our time together.

1694
02:13:21,994 --> 02:13:24,065
And I have to let you go.

1695
02:13:26,165 --> 02:13:27,969
I have to let you go.

1696
02:14:19,232 --> 02:14:20,535
I'm sorry, Robert.

1697
02:14:42,427 --> 02:14:43,930
[ARTHUR YELLS]

1698
02:14:48,202 --> 02:14:51,877
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1699
02:14:52,941 --> 02:14:54,979
...not just to live for him.

1700
02:14:56,578 --> 02:14:59,117
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1701
02:15:08,894 --> 02:15:10,130
What happened?

1702
02:15:10,596 --> 02:15:12,299
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1703
02:15:12,464 --> 02:15:13,733
No, to find Saito.

1704
02:15:16,003 --> 02:15:17,774
He'll be lost.

1705
02:15:20,309 --> 02:15:22,146
No, he'll be all right.

1706
02:15:38,165 --> 02:15:40,136
SAITO:
Have you come to kill me?

1707
02:15:44,405 --> 02:15:46,877
I'm waiting for someone.

1708
02:15:51,348 --> 02:15:54,120
COBB:
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1709
02:15:56,854 --> 02:15:58,257
Cobb?

1710
02:15:58,990 --> 02:16:00,026
[SCOFFS]

1711
02:16:00,193 --> 02:16:01,963
Impossible.

1712
02:16:02,494 --> 02:16:05,100
We were young men together.

1713
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:09,037
I'm an old man.

1714
02:16:10,271 --> 02:16:12,342
Filled with regret.

1715
02:16:15,478 --> 02:16:18,183
Waiting to die alone.

1716
02:16:21,352 --> 02:16:23,522
I've come back for you.

1717
02:16:26,793 --> 02:16:30,668
To remind you of something.

1718
02:16:33,934 --> 02:16:36,307
Something you once knew.

1719
02:16:39,175 --> 02:16:41,413
That this world is not real.

1720
02:16:46,317 --> 02:16:50,827
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1721
02:16:51,657 --> 02:16:54,428
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1722
02:17:00,535 --> 02:17:01,870
Come back...

1723
02:17:04,406 --> 02:17:07,780
...so we can be
young men together again.

1724
02:17:11,548 --> 02:17:13,518
Come back with me.

1725
02:17:16,621 --> 02:17:18,056
Come back.

1726
02:17:27,801 --> 02:17:29,504
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Hot towel, sir?

1727
02:17:30,138 --> 02:17:33,011
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1728
02:17:33,175 --> 02:17:35,481
Do you need immigration forms?

1729
02:17:37,581 --> 02:17:38,917
Thank you.

1730
02:17:39,383 --> 02:17:41,020
Hot towel, sir?

1731
02:17:42,020 --> 02:17:45,025
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1732
02:18:56,415 --> 02:18:57,483
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1733
02:18:58,616 --> 02:19:00,252
Thank you, sir.

1734
02:19:44,307 --> 02:19:45,676
Welcome.

1735
02:19:46,142 --> 02:19:47,545
This way.

1736
02:20:08,737 --> 02:20:12,212
MILES:
James? Phillipa?

1737
02:20:15,946 --> 02:20:17,215
Look who's here.

1738
02:20:22,822 --> 02:20:23,890
Hey.

1739
02:20:24,991 --> 02:20:27,697
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
PHILLIPA: Daddy! Daddy!

1740
02:20:27,861 --> 02:20:30,132
JAMES: Daddy!
COBB: How are you?

1741
02:20:31,232 --> 02:20:32,835
Look what I've been building!

1742
02:20:33,002 --> 02:20:36,708
- What are you building?
JAMES: We're building a house on the cliff!

1743
02:20:36,872 --> 02:20:39,745
COBB: On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1744
02:20:39,910 --> 02:20:42,482
JAMES: Let's go.
PHILLIPA: Come on, Daddy!
