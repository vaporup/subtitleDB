1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,920
<i>It was a long time ago.</i>

2
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,440
<i>Sometimes I can still hear their voices
across Sally’s Woods.</i>

3
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,920
<i>There was Billy, Steve, Tommy...</i>

4
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,760
<i>and the tall kid
from down the street, Joey.</i>

5
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,680
<i>It was Joey Walsh.</i>

6
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,800
<i>My best friend was Timmy Burns
who lived two blocks away from me.</i>

7
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,360
<i>We turned the woods
into a battlefield...</i>

8
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,040
<i>and dreamed that someday
we would become men.</i>

9
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,680
- Did you hear it?
- What?

10
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,520
Let’s go, Timmy!
Let’s go!

11
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,200
Massapequa, Long Island - 1956

12
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,800
Come on, Major.

13
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,880
They’ve got to be somewhere,
Ronnie. Watch out.

14
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,480
We better stay in the ravine.

15
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,360
Go.

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,520
Look, there they are!

17
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,640
Wipe them out!

18
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,960
- You’re dead, and you know it.
- No, I’m not.

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,840
Ronnie’s dead!

20
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,520
No, I’m not!

21
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,680
Look at the mayor.

22
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,960
Donna, come back here.

23
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,800
Get out of the way.

24
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Hey, you boys, stop that.

25
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,640
Stevie Boyer just gave Mary Barnett a ring.
Can you believe it?

26
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,440
Over there.

27
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,280
Okay. Come here.

28
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
Stay out of the way.

29
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,040
What is this?
Is this a firecracker?

30
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,880
What’s the matter with you?

31
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,040
- This is boring.
- Yeah, square, man.

32
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,320
Look, Daddy, the soldiers.

33
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,000
Happy birthday, Ronnie Kovic.

34
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
- For me?
- Yes. Open it.

35
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,840
That’s really nice, Donna.
Say thank you, Ronnie.

36
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,000
Thanks, Donna,
but you didn’t have to do that for me.

37
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,320
Going to the woods tonight?
They’ll have fireworks there.

38
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,760
- Should be a real blast.
- Yeah, okay.

39
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
What is it?
Open it, will you?

40
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,400
Leave him aIone.

41
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,360
Beautiful.

42
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,880
It’s the real thing, Ronnie.
Feel that.

43
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,120
Just like Mickey MantIe.

44
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,200
Ain’t he a little 4th of July firecracker
in that hat?

45
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,280
Yeah. He’s my little
Yankee Doodle boy.

46
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,920
Get it.

47
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,760
Come on!

48
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,520
- Did you like it?
- I don’t know.

49
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Look how many push-ups I can do.

50
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,520
Yeah!

51
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,280
Come on, Ronnie.

52
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,200
Go, Ronnie, go.

53
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,480
<i>Go, Ronnie.
You can do it.</i>

54
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,360
Yes! That’s my boy!

55
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,920
Ronnie, you made it.

56
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,920
Yeah, all right.

57
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,520
<i>Tommy, Ronnie, come on!</i>

58
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,520
<i>You’re going to miss it!</i>

59
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,040
<i>Michelle, Barbara,
you’ve got to see this.</i>

60
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,720
<i>Not as a call to bear arms,
though arms we need...</i>

61
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,480
<i>but a call to bear the burden
of a long twilight struggle...</i>

62
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,200
<i>a struggle against
the common enemies of man:</i>

63
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,160
<i>tyranny, poverty, disease,
and war itself.</i>

64
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,120
You’ll get a licking
if you’re late.

65
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
<i>In the long history of the world...</i>

66
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,560
<i>only a few generations
have been granted the role...</i>

67
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,920
<i>of defending freedom....</i>

68
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,280
- Look, President Kennedy.
- That’s right.

69
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,800
- He’s so handsome.
- <i>I dont shrink from this responsibility...</i>

70
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,400
<i>I welcome it.</i>

71
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,040
<i>Let the word go forth
from this time and place...</i>

72
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
<i>that the torch has been passed...</i>

73
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,120
<i>to a new generation of Americans...</i>

74
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,800
<i>born in this century.</i>

75
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,200
<i>Let every nation know...</i>

76
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,320
<i>that we shall pay any price...</i>

77
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,640
<i>bear any burden...</i>

78
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,360
<i>support any friend...</i>

79
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,800
<i>oppose any foe...</i>

80
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,320
<i>to assure the survival
and the success of liberty</i>

81
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,240
I had a dream, Ronnie,
the other night...

82
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,760
and you were speaking to a large crowd
just like him.

83
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,120
Just like him.

84
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,000
And you were saying great things.

85
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,800
<i>And so, my fellow Americans...</i>

86
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,600
<i>ask not what your country
can do for you...</i>

87
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,480
<i>ask what you can do
for your country.</i>

88
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,680
Right. Get out.
Got to get out.

89
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,440
<i>You got to get out.</i>

90
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,240
<i>Hit that switch.</i>

91
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,800
All right, hit the ropes.

92
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,560
Go, go, go!

93
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,960
Hand over hand over hand.
Get those legs off those ropes.

94
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,280
<i>Come on, ladies,
let’s come down.</i>

95
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,960
That rope is like life.

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,360
You grab it and hang onto it.
Next!

97
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
<i>I want you to kill!</i>

98
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,640
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir!

99
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,920
I want that conference championship.

100
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,160
- You want that championship?
- Yes, sir!

101
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,560
Get up! Heads!

102
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,680
Get them up!
Do you hear me?

103
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,880
Get your heads up, ladies!

104
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,200
<i>I want that conference championship!</i>

105
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,080
<i>If you want to win,
you got to suffer!</i>

106
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,520
<i>You want to be the best?
You got to pay the price for victory...</i>

107
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,560
<i>and the price is sacrifice!
Sacrifice, people.</i>

108
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
<i>Susanne, no homework
at the table, please.</i>

109
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,640
<i>No, Tommy. After supper.</i>

110
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,280
Dad, can I come with you--

111
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,680
There’s the next conference champion.

112
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,960
Sorry I’m late.

113
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,520
There’s rice on the stove
and fresh fruit in the icebox.

114
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,280
- I can’t.
- It’s on your diet.

115
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,560
No, I told you, Ma.
I got to drop 3 pounds by Saturday.

116
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Your brother’s a hard worker, Tommy...

117
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,960
‘cause he wants to be the best.

118
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,640
Win or lose.
In school, in sports, in life...

119
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,920
as long as you do your best.
That’s what matters to God.

120
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,960
<i>Win or lose, we’re still here.
We still love him.</i>

121
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,800
- Can I go to my room, Dad?
- Yeah, sure.

122
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,920
Thank you, God,
for the food on our table.

123
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,920
In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Ghost. Amen.

124
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,680
Daddy, Jimmy took my doll.

125
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,640
- Go to bed, I’ll get the doll.
- I hate his guts.

126
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,000
Just go to bed.

127
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,840
- I didn’t take it.
- Where’s your sister’s doll?

128
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,400
Jackie?
Why is Jackie not in bed?

129
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,200
<i>Settle down.
Come on, go to bed.</i>

130
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,800
Where’d you get this?

131
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,840
What are you doing in my room, anyway?

132
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,560
Don’t change the subject.

133
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,840
I don’t allow <i>Playboy</i> magazine--

134
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,120
Stevie gave it to me.

135
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,240
I was holding it for--

136
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,120
You have filthy, impure thoughts.

137
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,760
God is going to punish you for this.

138
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,960
I haven’t even looked at it yet,
all right?

139
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,440
I want you to go to confession.
I want you to tell Father McKenna.

140
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,640
I don’t want to see this filthy magazine
in my house again. Now, take this away.

141
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,520
- What’s going on?
- Nothing.

142
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,400
What do you mean, nothing?
What’s going on?

143
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,800
Nothing, Dad. Okay?

144
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,080
You’re out of bounds, guys.
Back inside.

145
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,320
Come on, Kovic, back inside.

146
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,120
<i>Kovic, back inside.</i>

147
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,560
Come on, Kovic.
Back inside. Let’s go.

148
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,920
I want to see some explosion.

149
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,600
No messing around.

150
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,040
You’re great, Ronnie.
Stay with him.

151
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,560
Come on down.
All right.

152
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,600
Get off the mat.

153
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,880
Get him!

154
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,560
Reversal. 2-3.

155
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,960
One, red!
You’re both up.

156
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,000
All right, fresh start.

157
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,960
Stand up.
Don’t let him get you.

158
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,320
Don’t let him get you.
Pull him out. All right.

159
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,120
Watch those legs.
Watch him!

160
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,880
Get him down.
Don’t let him get the neck.

161
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,120
No!

162
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
You can beat him, Ronnie.

163
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Come on.

164
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,680
Bridge!

165
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,560
You can win.
Don’t give up.

166
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,600
Okay, son?

167
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,000
<i>Come on. Get up.</i>

168
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,040
Left, right, left.

169
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,240
Seats!

170
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,040
Good morning.
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hayes.

171
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,680
This is Sergeant Bowers.

172
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,520
United States Marine Recruiting Station,
Levittown, New York.

173
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,720
We are here today...

174
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,640
at the request of your principal,
Mr. Richards...

175
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,680
and other members of the faculty...

176
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,000
to tell you a little bit
about the Marine Corps.

177
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,640
First off, young men,
let’s get one thing straight.

178
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,760
Not everybody becomes
United States Marines.

179
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,200
<i>We want the best...</i>

180
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,000
<i>and we’ll accept nothing but the best...</i>

181
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,200
<i>because there is nothing prouder,
nothing finer, nothing standing as straight...</i>

182
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,320
<i>as a United States Marine.</i>

183
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,960
<i>Now, they’ve got the Army.</i>

184
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,640
<i>They got the Navy.</i>

185
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,000
<i>They got the Air Farce.</i>

186
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,520
<i>And if you want to join them,
be my guest.</i>

187
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,920
<i>But if you want a challenge...</i>

188
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,080
<i>if you want to try
something difficult...</i>

189
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,800
<i>if you want to try
to achieve the impossible...</i>

190
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,280
you try 13 weeks of hell
at Parris Island, South Carolina...

191
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,040
and you’ll find out
if you got what it takes.

192
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,480
<i>You’ll find out
if you really are a man...</i>

193
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,600
<i>and the Marines may be
what you’re looking for.</i>

194
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,560
<i>Tarawa...</i>

195
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,920
<i>Iwo Jima...</i>

196
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,040
Belleau Wood...

197
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,080
the frozen Chosin Reservoir.

198
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,560
First to fight.
We have never lost a war.

199
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
We have always come
when our country’s called us.

200
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,600
<i>Sergeant Bowers and I would like
to open this up to questions.</i>

201
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,640
<i>If any of you young men do have questions,
go ahead and raise your hands.</i>

202
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,280
<i>Come on, now.
Don’t be afraid.</i>

203
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,200
<i>Don’t forget,
a good Marine’s a thinking Marine.</i>

204
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,680
<i>Billy Vorsovich, sir.</i>

205
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,840
<i>When would I get to wear
a uniform like you?</i>

206
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,280
<i>You make PFC out of boot camp,
you’ll be wearing this in 13 weeks.</i>

207
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,520
Go, Massapequa!

208
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,080
Go!

209
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,480
My brother’s at school at Adelphi.

210
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,040
He said that there’s gonna be
a big war in.... What is it?

211
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,400
Vietnam.

212
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,760
He said that the Marines are gonna be
the first ones in, and it ain’t gonna last long.

213
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,520
That’s right. So if we don’t sign up soon,
we’re gonna miss it.

214
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,120
I’ve already decided.
I’m going in.

215
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,160
- Really?
- Just like that?

216
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,280
- I’m not waiting. I’m going in now.
- Come on. You’re crazy.

217
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,480
No, you’re crazy.

218
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,560
Our dads got to go to WWII.
This is our chance to do something...

219
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
to be part of history, guys.

220
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,680
Yeah, just like our dads.

221
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,600
You should think about what you’re doing,
you know, Ronnie.

222
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,520
Come on. It could be dangerous over there.
You could get yourself killed.

223
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,160
Did you ever think about that?

224
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,120
Where are you going,
squirrel head? College?

225
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,240
I want to do something with my life.

226
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,680
I can get a degree
in business administration.

227
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,040
You don’t think
you need to serve your country?

228
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,240
Don’t you care about anybody
but yourself?

229
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,840
Better dead than red.

230
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,560
They got missiles pointed at us
everywhere. ICBMs.

231
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,280
They’re coming in all around us.

232
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,320
- Cuba now. 90 miles away.
- Ronnie, they’re taking over the world.

233
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,280
- When will we stop them?
- You can’t stop them by yourself.

234
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,560
Karl Marx theory.

235
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,840
- Communism is moving in everywhere.
- Where, Ronnie? I don’t see them.

236
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,040
The’re not here in Massapequa,
so I’ll just take care of number one.

237
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,800
That’s right. Me...
Stevie, number one.

238
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,040
It’s okay. Someone’s got to stay
with the women and children...

239
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,760
while the men go do the fighting.

240
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,840
You guys are nuts.
I’m getting out of here.

241
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,040
All I’m saying is, you should think about it.
Think about it, Ronnie.

242
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,800
Stevie, who are you taking to the prom?

243
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,160
- Wendy Daniels.
- Wendy Daniels?

244
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,920
How desperate were you?

245
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,160
Well, who are you taking, Joey,
your mother?

246
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,240
Ronnie, who are you going
to take to the prom?

247
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,160
You don’t know her.
She’s a pretty girl from Ronkonkoma.

248
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,640
- What’s her name?
- You don’t know her.

249
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,120
- What’s her name, Ronnie?
- It’s Lombardi.

250
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,280
- Lombardi?
- Yeah.

251
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,760
Vince Lombardi?

252
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,120
Rosanna Lombardi.

253
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,320
She’s from out of town, right?

254
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,760
She going to get a motel?
‘Cause I’d like to get in on that.

255
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,880
Ronnie, would you take this
to section three?

256
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,360
- And check the stock for dog food.
- Dog food.

257
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,640
Then finish stacking the potatoes.

258
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,200
Come on. Let’s go.

259
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,080
Let’s do some work for a change.

260
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,600
- Section three I wanna put this is in?
- Yeah, right. Section three.

261
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,160
Hey, Donna.

262
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,200
Hi, Ronnie.

263
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,760
- How you doing?
- Good.

264
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,280
- I heard you were going into the Marines.
- Yeah.

265
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,280
It’s better than working at A&P.

266
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,160
That’s great, Ronnie.
That’s wonderful.

267
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,920
I’m going to boot camp soon.

268
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,960
I joined the Marines for four years...

269
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,680
so if I go to Vietnam,
probably go right to the front line.

270
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,800
- Really?
- I’ll see a lot of action.

271
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,840
- Wow.
- That’s neat.

272
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,240
Heard you got into that school.
The letter?

273
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,680
Yeah.

274
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,200
Yeah, Syracuse.

275
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,480
It’s going to be really hard.

276
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,000
Could I talk to you in private?

277
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,600
Oh, yeah. Sure.

278
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,560
I’ve been meaning to call you.
I was wondering...

279
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,000
are you going with someone to the prom?

280
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,240
Yeah, I’m going with Jed.

281
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh, yeah?

282
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,200
That’s great.
He’s a nice guy, isn’t he? Jed.

283
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,040
Stevie Boyer said you were taking
a girl from Lake Ronkonkoma.

284
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,600
- Yeah. No.
- No?

285
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,760
No. I don’t have time for that stuff.
You know, going to proms....

286
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,480
There’s a lot of things to take care of
before you go in the Marines.

287
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,720
I didn’t even know how much stuff.

288
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,720
<i>Maybe I’ll see you
before I leave, okay?</i>

289
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,000
I told you I love you.
You promised.

290
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,720
<i>The batter is Mickey Mantle.
Mickey has two strikes...</i>

291
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,040
<i>and the chance to put the Yankees
ahead in this game.</i>

292
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,960
<i>The pitcher gets his sign, takes his stretch,
checks the runners.</i>

293
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,920
<i>Here’s the pitch. Mickey swings.
And he gets hold of it.</i>

294
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,720
<i>Theres a long drive
deep to center field.</i>

295
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,880
<i>It is going, going.
It is gone into the bleachers...</i>

296
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,240
<i>455 feet away...</i>

297
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,600
<i>for Mickey’s 491st home run!</i>

298
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,160
<i>How about that?</i>

299
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,040
<i>The crowd is on its feet,
giving Mickey a standing ovation.</i>

300
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,960
<i>For the times,
they are a-changin’</i>

301
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,520
<i>Come senators and congressmen
Please heed the call</i>

302
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,520
<i>Don’t stand in the doorway
Don’t block up the hall</i>

303
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,800
<i>For the times,
they are a-changin’</i>

304
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,560
<i>There’s no question.
The First Cavalry Division...</i>

305
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,520
<i>is the latest concept in mobile warfare.</i>

306
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,280
<i>Just one of those divisions is worth...</i>

307
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,000
<i>two and a half Russian
and as many as six Chinese divisions.</i>

308
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,800
<i>How well will the individual
American soldier...</i>

309
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,480
<i>stand up here in Vietnam?</i>

310
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,840
- <i>I’ve never seen anything like--</i>
- What do you think? About that.

311
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,680
I don’t know.
13,000 miles....

312
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,440
That’s a long way
to go to fight a war.

313
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,680
<i>The Vietcong, they fought
the French and the Japanese for 30 years.</i>

314
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,680
<i>Do you really think
they can be weeded out?</i>

315
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,040
<i>I think that anything that lives in a cave
can be weeded out.</i>

316
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,200
I just hope they send to
to Europe or Korea or...

317
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,200
- They can’t.
- Some place safe.

318
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,520
Every Marine has a tour of duty there.

319
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,280
It’s not like the Army.

320
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,520
What’s the matter with you, anyway?

321
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,560
- You served. Uncle Bob served.
- I know, Ronnie. I know.

322
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,720
Don’t you remember what
President Kennedy said?

323
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,880
"There’s not gonna be
an America anymore...

324
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,360
"unless there are people
who are willing to sacrifice."

325
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,120
- I love my country.
- I know.

326
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
And you’re right Ronnie.
You’re doing the right thing.

327
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,480
Communism has to be stopped.

328
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,280
It’s God’s will you go.
We’re proud of you.

329
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,560
Be careful, that’s all.

330
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,600
<i>Up there in Hanoi they don’t allow
magazines and newspapers, televisions...</i>

331
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,440
<i>to cast doubts on the military system.</i>

332
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,640
Don’t you know what it means to me
to be a Marine, Dad?

333
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,080
Ever since I was a kid, I’ve wanted this.
I wanted to serve my country.

334
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,880
And I want to go.

335
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,080
I want to go to Vietnam...

336
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,720
and I’ll die there if I have to.

337
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,240
<i>The attitude of people on the home front
is very important.</i>

338
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,520
Not a nice night for the prom.

339
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,920
Sometimes, God, I’m so confused.

340
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,880
Sometimes I think I’d just...

341
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,880
like to stay here in Massapequa...

342
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,600
and never Ieave...

343
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,280
but I got to go.

344
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,040
Help me, Jesus.
Help me to make the right decision.

345
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,760
<i>Please, dear God.</i>

346
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,320
Ron.

347
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,320
Ronnie, what happened to you?

348
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,760
What....
Oh, jeez.

349
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,200
- Donna.
- Ronnie.

350
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,400
Will you dance with me?

351
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,520
Yes. Sure.

352
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,960
Near the Cua Viet River, Vietnam
October 1967

353
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,520
<i>You have beaucoup gooks.
They’re coming at you.</i>

354
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,280
<i>Echo-1’s pushing them. Over.</i>

355
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,000
6, 2-Actual.
Sit Rep as follows.

356
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,480
<i>Two set in on the beach.
The tracks are moving this way. Over.</i>

357
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,080
Sounds like beaucoup gooks in there.

358
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,360
I got a feeling I’m finally going
to get to see one.

359
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,200
Relax, you’ll be all right.

360
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
Where you from, Wilson?

361
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,600
First Battalion, 9th Motor T.
Mostly around Danang.

362
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,520
The Sergeant Major said the grunts
needed replacements...

363
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,480
so they took me out of battalion supply.

364
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,480
- Where are you from in the world?
- Venus, Georgia.

365
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,680
This is my second tour.
I haven’t seen a Georgia boy get hurt yet.

366
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,240
You’ll be all right.

367
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,560
Echo-1’s taken in,
coming northwest edge of the ville.

368
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,920
We got gooks moving this way.

369
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,160
Look out there, Sergeant.
Can you see them?

370
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,160
Right there. You see them?
They got rifles.

371
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,840
<i>Can you see the rifles?
Right there. You see them?</i>

372
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,560
<i>Can you see the rifles?</i>

373
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,160
Yes, sir.

374
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,440
Pass the word.
When I give the order...

375
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,480
I want to light up this ville
like a motherfucking Christmas tree.

376
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,040
I think we got them! This time I think
we fucking got them! Move out.

377
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,840
Pass the word.
Fire on my command.

378
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,560
Wilson, come with me.

379
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,720
Cover that big hooch.
Fire on my command! Pass the word.

380
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,960
Corporal, start ranking.
Fire on my command.

381
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,840
Fire on my command.

382
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,360
Cease fire. Cease fire, you asshole.

383
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,600
What the fuck are you doing?

384
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,840
Cease fire.

385
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,920
What happened?

386
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,480
Cease fire, you asshole.

387
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,200
I want to know what happened.

388
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,720
I don’t know, sir.
Possible accidental discharge, sir.

389
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,760
We better get a sweep team in there.
Take five men. Tell me how many we got.

390
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,920
Yes, sir.

391
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,560
Motherfucker!
Baldy, on me.

392
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,800
Brooks! Martinez! On me!
Wilson, on me!

393
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,040
Line.

394
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,360
<i>Standby.</i>

395
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,880
<i>Target: 15,637 meters.</i>

396
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,360
<i>Direction: 5800.</i>

397
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,520
Get him out!

398
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,400
Check it out over there.
Everything out.

399
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,760
Baldy, get everything out.
Baldy! There! Check it out.

400
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,840
Get him out!

401
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,520
Oh, my God.

402
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,720
We didn’t do this, did we?

403
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,680
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus Christ.

404
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,400
2-Actual, 2, better get down here quick,
and bring the corpsmen.

405
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,640
We got beaucoup wounded.
Civilians.

406
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,680
Martinez, help me!

407
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,880
We wasted them.
Motherfucker! We wasted them!

408
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,640
Where are the rifles?

409
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,920
Where are the rifles?

410
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,120
There ain’t no fucking rifles.

411
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,160
Jesus fucking Christ!
Well, help him, then.

412
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,200
Help him!

413
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,560
Motherfuck!

414
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,240
- Fucking great.
- Shit!

415
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,720
Get up and help him.
I want you to help him.

416
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,840
Forgive us.

417
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,680
Help me.
Somebody help me!

418
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,320
6, 2-Actual.
Request emergency medevac.

419
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,840
We got a lot of friendly wounded. Over.

420
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,400
<i>Negative. Get out of there! Leave
the wounded! You got Arty inbound!</i>

421
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,920
<i>Get out!</i>

422
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,240
Get back to the dunes.

423
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,320
We got gooks in the ville.
I want you moving out of here.

424
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,880
Get out. Move out.
That’s a direct order.

425
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,600
I want you out that door.

426
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,320
It wasn’t your fault, god damn it!
They got in the goddamned way!

427
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,000
Kovic, get your fucking ass up.
We gotta move! We got gooks in the ville.

428
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,320
- The baby.
- Move out. Get back.

429
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,800
- The baby.
- No, move. Now. Let’s move.

430
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,040
Move out!
Get the fuck up! Move!

431
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,960
The ville is going to blow!
Arty’s on the way.

432
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,960
Red, Abbot.

433
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,120
<i>Wilson’s hit.</i>

434
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,720
What happened?

435
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,360
X.O., Sergeant Kovic here
to see you, sir.

436
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,520
Stand easy, Sergeant.

437
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,400
Yeah, Kovic. Lieutenant told me
that was a pretty rough time.

438
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,360
Yes, sir. It was pretty bad.

439
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,880
- Ran into a few of them, didn’t you?
- Yes, sir.

440
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,160
You want to see me
about something, Sergeant?

441
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,480
Yes, sir.

442
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,800
Like I said to the captain, sir,
it was a very confusing day.

443
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,000
- The villagers--
- Yeah. I know about the villagers.

444
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,680
- The villagers--
- It was very, very unfortunate.

445
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,920
- The enemy used them as cover.
- Yes, sir.

446
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,240
They popped up, started firing.
We were running back. And it was real glary.

447
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,720
Very confusing,
and that’s when it happened, sir.

448
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,560
What happened?

449
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,440
- Sir, that was when Wilson was killed, sir.
- I know about Wilson.

450
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,680
Sir, you see...

451
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,880
he was the last one out,
and that’s when it happened, sir.

452
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,320
Sir, I think I might
have killed him, sir.

453
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,240
I don’t think so.

454
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,520
He was coming up over the dune.
It was very confusing.

455
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,400
And I think I might
have killed him.

456
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,960
It’s hard. I was out a couple of weeks ago.
Sometimes it’s...

457
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,120
very hard to tell what’s happening.

458
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,080
Yes, sir.

459
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,880
But, sir, I think I killed Wilson.

460
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,920
I don’t think so, Kovic.

461
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,840
But, sir, I want you to know that--

462
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,720
Don’t talk like that. I don’t need anybody
to come in here and tell me this shit.

463
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,520
- I’ll take your head off. Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

464
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,000
All right.

465
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,480
Carry on.

466
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,320
X.O. ought to court-martial his ass.

467
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,720
Sergeant K.

468
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,600
January 1968

469
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Ain’t nothing but a thing, baby.

470
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,280
It’s so hot out here,
I want to kill some motherfucking gooks.

471
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,520
Dog, you’re sounding
like a bitch, man.

472
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,360
Ain’t nothing but a thing.

473
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,280
It’s so hot out in this motherfucker,
this must be hell.

474
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,200
Or purgatory.

475
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,000
Where’s the motherfucking devil at?

476
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,520
Take cover.

477
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,800
Take cover.

478
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,400
<i>Snake 199 airborne...</i>

Son of a bitch.

487
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,440
Fuck, man!

488
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,480
Fuck!

Heavy incoming from the ville.

<i>2, Echo-6.

<i>They’re going to cut you off.</i>

497
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,360
I need everything you got.

<i>We’re going dow,

<i>Hold it, god damn it.

Goddamn! Motherfuckers!

504
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,520
We got six sucking chest wounds
and 12 crispy critters coming in.

505
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,720
Give him 250 ml of happy juice
until he crashes out.

506
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,960
- Just get him to sleep.
- You got it.

507
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,600
- Who’s got a hot one?
- What do we have?

508
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,480
His kidney and liver are gone.
He’s leaking like a sieve.

509
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,880
- We better just kiss this one goodbye.
- All right, take off.

510
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,600
- There’s something wrong with me.
- Code blue.

511
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,160
Let’s go.
He’s code blue.

512
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,760
Get the machine.
Let’s go.

513
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,880
Stay with me, Marine.
Stay with me.

514
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,560
Give me the shock defibs.

515
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,760
Stay with me now.
We’re going to jump-start you. Clear.

516
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,240
Where’s the priest?
Get me a priest.

517
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,640
Breathe. Breathe.

518
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,880
- I took the Packers at minus 7.
- They ain’t got a chance.

519
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,840
How are you?

520
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,600
Tell them they’ve got to operate.
There’s something wrong with me.

521
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,600
The doctors are real busy right now.
There’s a lot of wounded here today.

522
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,000
No time for anything
except trying to stay alive.

523
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,600
So you got to try and stay alive.
You hear me?

524
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,360
Try and stay alive.

525
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,400
I’ve come to give you your last rites.

526
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,720
Are you ready?

527
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,480
I’m ready, Father.

528
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,400
"I am the resurrection and the life.

529
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,320
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

530
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,000
"We brought nothing into this world,
and we can take nothing out.

531

Bronx Veterans Hospital - 1968

534
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,080
<i>I got sunshine</i>

535
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,480
<i>On a cloudy day</i>

536
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,480
<i>When it’s cold outside</i>

537
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,120
<i>I got the month of May</i>

538
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,920
Eddie, I need some help
in Room 13.

539
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,560
Give me a second, man.

540
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,760
His catheter’s plugging up.
It’s backing up into his kidney.

541
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,800
I said I’d be there when I be there.
Give me a fucking break.

542
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,040
Give me two cards.

543
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,880
You know you ain’t supposed
to have this.

544
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,560
What the fuck?

545
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,480
Didn’t I tell you not to do that
to him in the a.m.?

546
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,720
Take the needle out of my arm.

547
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,080
Good morning, Nurse Washington.
How are you today?

548
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,360
You up bright and early today.

549
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,080
Everybody up.

550
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,640
Good morning, gentlemen.
Let’s rise and shine.

551
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,280
Can I have some aspirin?

552
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,960
I ain’t feeling well.

553
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,840
I’ll get to you.
Leon, how you doing today?

554
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,640
Look at this shit.

555
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,280
- My catheter’s clogged.
- Give it a minute.

556
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,720
Swear to God,
they’re getting bigger every day.

557
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,480
Don’t bother them,
they won’t bother you.

558
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,200
That’s why I’m feeding him.

559
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,920
Keep on feeding him,
and everything will be fine.

560
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,520
Up and at them.
Frankie’s here.

561
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,080
Hey, Frankie.
What’s up?

562
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,440
Hopkins, come on, wake up.

563
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,200
- All you guys, 6:00 special.
- Fuck you.

564
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,080
- I’m looking at you.
- Keep looking, asshole.

565
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,440
My man, Kovic. Up already?
That’s good. Let’s go.

566
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,640
- Let’s do it. Let’s go.
- Give me a hand over here.

567
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,480
How you doing, Eddie?

568
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,200
Yeah, you about ready.
Let me have that thing there.

569
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,720
I think my stomach is bloated.

570
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,560
Just take it easy.
Eddie’s going to take care of all you boys.

571
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,640
It’s like a fucking car wash.

572
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,880
Bernstein, what’s wrong today?
You’re impacted.

573
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,800
You got shit up you
that ain’t coming out.

574
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,680
Stick your head up my ass,
see what the problem is.

575
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,200
Your piss bag’s cloudy, too.
You been drinking enough water?

576
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,440
- You got to flush them kidneys.
- Yeah, yeah.

577
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,240
Frankie, I think I’m done.
I think I’m ready, man.

578
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,160
You fucking with me again?
You better chill out.

579
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,920
I’m not fucking with you.

580
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,120
My man, Kovic.

581
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,960
Mr. Fourth of JuIy.

582
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,720
<i>Politicians, protesters, and police
are in Chicago...</i>

583
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,200
<i>for the 1968 presidential election.</i>

584
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,720
Fucking gook-lovers.
They ought to die.

585
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,440
They’re here.

586
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,920
There he goes, man.
It’s Leon.

587
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,520
They’re coming through the wire.

588
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,240
They’re going to overrun us.

589
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,680
Hey, John.

590
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,640
Shut the fuck up, Leon.

591
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,160
Hit him with some morphine.

592
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,160
<i>Chicago has an
</i>Alice in Wonderland<i> quality.</i>

593
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,320
<i>Things are getting
curiouser and curiouser.</i>

594
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,080
<i>Everywhere you go,
there’s a sign reminding you....</i>

595
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,800
Love it or leave it,
you fucking bastards.

596
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,720
Hey, you ready, Kovic?

597
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,280
They’re burning the flag.
They’re fucking burning the American flag.

598
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,400
<i>Come on.
Let’s look alive.</i>

599
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,160
<i>Looking good.</i>

600
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,280
Come on, Kovic.
Real nice.

601
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,440
- How many did I do yesterday?
- Three.

602
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,840
- You had enough?
- Let’s do seven.

603
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,360
There you go. Let’s go for seven, then.
Come on, Ronnie.

604
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,120
Come on. Get up there.
Keep going.

605
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,800
Come on, fucking Marine.
There you go. Real nice.

606
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,920
<i>We want to make one thing
very clear to you, Ron.</i>

607
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,760
<i>The possibility of your
ever walking again is minimal.</i>

608
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,880
Almost impossible.

609
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,040
You’re a T-6,
paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

610
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,760
Probably you’ll be in a wheelchair
for the rest of your life.

611
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,000
<i>Do you understand
what I’m saying?</i>

612
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,600
Well, doctor, will....

613
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,800
Will I ever be able...

614
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,520
to have children?

615
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,080
No.

616
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,160
No, but we have
a very good psychologist here.

617
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,160
- I’ll walk again. I know I’ll walk again.
- Let me tell you something.

618
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,520
You will never walk again.

619
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,120
How am I looking, Willie, good?

620
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,520
You’re one crazy marine.

621
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,920
So gung ho, but you don’t know shit
about what’s going on in this country.

622
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:22,120
- Fuck you, Willie.
- It ain’t about burning the flag and Vietnam.

623
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,080
Why fight for rights over there?
We ain’t got rights at home.

624
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,760
It’s about Detroit and Newark, man.
It’s about racism.

625
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,480
But you can’t get no job at home.

626
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,720
Vietnam’s a white man’s war,
a rich man’s war.

627
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,120
Where’s my money?

628
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,720
You got to read some books.
There’s a revolution going on.

629
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,680
Brothers are getting it together.

630
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,640
If you ain’t part of the solution,
you’re part of the problem.

631
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,240
Jesus Christ, Willie.
Just get my chair for me.

632
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,520
You got to watch for the bitch.

633
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,360
Take the bra off.
I’ll give you another $10.

634
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,080
Why, sure, sugar.

635
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,000
Like this?

636
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,880
- Suck on my tits.
- Honey, anything you want.

637
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,400
Oh, Jesus!

638
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,560
<i>Good. Easy now.</i>

639
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,880
<i>Very good.</i>

640
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,680
Hey, Doc, it’s really beautiful up here.

641
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,600
I’m walking out of here, guys.

642
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,160
- You’ll see. Right, Willie?
- Right.

643
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,880
Easy.

644
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,880
- I’m all right. I’m all right.
- Okay. That’s enough for today.

645
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,040
Good. Easy, now. Easy, now.
Don’t go too far.

646
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,000
- Don’t do too much.
- Looking good today. Looking good.

647
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,960
Don’t go too far.

648
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,840
- All right!
- Way to go, Kovic.

649
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,360
Amazing, huh?

650
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,600
Nothing from the chest down.
It can be done.

651
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,800
<i>Semper fi,</i> motherfucker!

652
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,600
All right, Harry, man.
Keep it going. Let’s go.

653
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,560
Let’s go.

654
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,480
Willie, I think I need....

655
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,200
Get him up.
Somebody get over there.

656
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,120
Something snapped.
It’s my neck.

657
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,320
- Just my neck.
- Shit.

658
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,800
Harry! Hang on.

659
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,680
It’s just my neck?
What was that sound?

660
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,080
Oh, shit.

661
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,560
What?

662
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,400
It’s fine.
Everything’s fine.

663
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,520
- Is that my bone?
- Harry, get a doc.

664
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,040
Am I okay?

665
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,600
It’s okay. Everybody, relax.
Harry. Let’s go.

666
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,000
Washington!

667
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,680
Washington, where the fuck were you?

668
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,120
I’ve been pushing this call button,
staring at my own vomit for two hours.

669
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,080
What’s the matter with you fucking people?

670
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,920
I lay in my own shit.
Why don’t you change the sheets?

671
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,000
This goddamned fucking place.
I need a bath.

672
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,720
Don’t be raising your voice to me.
You watch your mouth.

673
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,880
Why don’t you people help me?
What’s the matter with you?

674
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,520
I don’t feel right.
I need to see the doctor now!

675
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,080
- He’s not available.
- I want to see him now.

676
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,680
He’s always too busy.

677
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,880
- What’s eating you now?
- Fucking shit.

678
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,640
You going off the deep end?

679
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,760
We’ll amputate that leg
if you continue.

680
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,520
What do I have to do
to make you people--

681
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,200
Don’t put your hands on me.

682
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,600
I want to be treated
like a human being.

683
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,120
I don’t want any of that shit.

684
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,400
Trying to keep me fucking drugged
so I don’t know what’s going on.

685
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,800
This place is a fucking slum.

686
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,520
You want out? We take that leg,
you’re out in two weeks.

687
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,240
- I want my leg.
- Why? You can’t feel it.

688
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,600
It’s my leg. I want my leg, you understand?
Can’t you understand that?

689
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,400
All I’m saying is I want to be treated
like a human being.

690
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,560
I fought for my country.
I’m a Vietnam veteran.

691
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,600
I fought for my country.

692
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,400
- Shut the fuck up.
- I deserve to be treated decent.

693
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,560
I earned that right.

694
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,600
Vietnam don’t mean nothing to me, man...

695
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,360
or any of these other people.
You got it?

696
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,200
You can take your Vietnam
and shove it up your ass, you hear?

697
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,960
- Go on.
- No! I don’t need this!

698
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,600
Hey, you fuck!

699
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,360
- Hey, god damn you.
- God damn it.

700
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,160
I am a fucking Vietnam veteran.

701
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,160
Marvin.

702
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,000
Marvin, now.

703
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,040
- What’s up?
- Marvin, look.

704
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,080
- Oh, fuck.
- It’s off.

705
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,720
It’s not working.

706
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,040
- Get the doctor.
- Wait a minute.

707
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,960
Okay. Yeah.
All right. I will.

708
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,960
How you doing, Eddie?
Let’s see what’s wrong with this.

709
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,480
They tell me if we don’t get
this pump working...

710
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,480
they’ll cut my leg off.
I want my leg.

711
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,800
- It’ll be all right.
- What do we do?

712
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,040
- Do we have another pump?
- It’s the only one, Eddie.

713
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,880
Ron. It’s Ron Kovic.

714
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,960
Sorry, man. Ron.

715
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,600
You are a doctor?

716
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,280
It’s the Vietnam war.
Cutbacks.

717
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,000
<i>The government’s not giving us the money
to take care of you guys.</i>

718
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,160
We’re doing our best.
It’s really too bad.

719
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,720
- It’s not fair.
- I’ve tried really hard to keep this leg.

720
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,040
I’ve been strapped in this bed for four months
so I could keep this leg.

721
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,680
- I’m trying to remain calm.
- Maybe I can rig up a substitute.

722
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,640
I’ll look in the basement
and see what we got.

723
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,680
- You’re coming back?
- Soon.

724
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,600
Let go, Ron.
Let go.

725
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,080
We really did try
to help Mr. Kovic, Doctor.

726
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,280
Massapequa, 1969

727
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,840
Ronnie’s home.

728
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,480
Okay. Out on three.
One, two, three.

729
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,920
That’s great.

730
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,960
- Did you paint the house, Dad?
- Yeah.

731
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,080
Yellow. It looks good.
Looks really good.

732
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,520
- It looks pretty good.
- I got that. That’s all right.

733
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,200
The kids have been talking about you.
They can’t wait to see you.

734
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,240
It’s great to be back in the neighborhood.
I got it. I got it.

735
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,720
Everything looks so different.

736
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,800
Major.

737
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,920
- You know who this is?
- Yeah.

738
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,880
You know who this is?

739
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,680
- He’s gotten old, huh?
- Just like your old man.

740
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,600
Hey, Tommy.

741
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,840
Good to see you.

742
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,360
Look at that hair, Dad.

743
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,600
You let him look like that?

744
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,960
I don’t have much say.

745
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,200
How are you, Jimmy?

746
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,480
- Good to have you home.
- It’s good to be home.

747
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,600
- You’re out for good?
- I’m out for good.

748
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,440
Patty, look at you.

749
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,680
- That’s Jackie.
- Jackie?

750
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,880
I wanted to visit you in the hospital.

751
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,440
How many pull-ups you do, huh?

752
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,640
You know, I did 23 pull-ups.

753
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,320
I’m okay. I’m all right.

754
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,080
- Ronnie.
- Susanne.

755
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,920
Good to have you home.

756
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,440
- You didn’t say she was this beautiful.
- I’m sorry.

757
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,480
It’s all right. I can’t feel anything anyway.
I’m only paralyzed.

758
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,040
- You look good.
- Yeah?

759
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,000
Ronnie.

760
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,840
Mom.

761
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,160
Look at your hair.

762
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,080
- Looks great.
- You like it?

763
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,560
- You look beautiful
- Thanks.

764
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,480
It’s good to be home.

765
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,320
It’s better than seeing me
in that hospital, huh?

766
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,200
- It’s okay.
- I know.

767
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,800
I’m okay.

768
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,000
It’s good to have you home, Ronnie.

769
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,200
Everybody looks so good.

770
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,360
I’m going inside for a minute.

771
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,880
Mom, wait.

772
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,560
She’ll be okay.

773
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,640
How are you, man?
You look good.

774
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,040
- Ronnie, you look good.
- Welcome home. You look so good.

775
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,120
- It’s so good to see you.
- Welcome home. Nice to see you.

776
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,120
Look at Harry.
You look good.

777
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,200
- Welcome home.
- Let’s go in the house and help.

778
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,840
- Come on, Mom. It’s all right.
- Looks good.

779
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,360
- You need some help?
- No, I’m okay, Dad.

780
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,120
Fixed up a bathroom for you, Ronnie.

781
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,600
Put a wider doorway in.

782
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,160
I built a shower for you, too.

783
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,040
You can get in here pretty easy.

784
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,600
And I put some handles
on the toilet for you.

785
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,760
- Ronnie?
- Thanks, Dad.

786
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,000
It’s really great
to be back in my room.

787
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,200
It’s good to have you.

788
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,160
It’s good to have you, Ronnie.

789
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,800
Come on, I’ll show you....

790
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,920
I’ll show you some new stuff we got..

791
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,960
in the bedroom over here.

792
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,080
<i>My Hauppauge Boyer’s
grossed $85,000 last six months.</i>

793
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,800
<i>My competitor’s rushing to build,
but I was first. People are loyal.</i>

794
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,480
You problably think
this is just a hamburger.

795
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,560
A patty’s just a piece of meat,
but it can have character, all right?

796
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,240
See that doughnut hole in the patty?

797
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,200
<i>My idea gets us 18 patties to the pound
instead of 16.</i>

798
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,600
Saves me about $40,000 a year.
That’s serious money.

799
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,920
<i>I plug the hole with lettuce, tomatoes,
onions, spices, our secret sauce...</i>

800
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,920
I cover the whole thing with a pickle.
They’ll never miss a thing.

801
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,680
Give me a good one for Ronnie.
Thank you very much.

802
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,120
You’re doing a good job.
Try this.

803
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,640
You don’t find that at McDonald’s.
I got a drive-in window, too.

804
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,200
It’s the first one in Long Island.
It’s clean, it’s cheap, it’s fast.

805
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,280
Feed the family for $3.95.

806
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,560
<i>Check out these chicks.
They’re wearing those new miniskirts.</i>

807
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,720
My idea. It’s good for tips.
The customers always come back.

808
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,160
Massapequa’s changed.
Watch yourself.

809
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,840
It’s no mom-and-pop operation any more.
This is our town.

810
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,720
You all right?
I want to push you out. Excuse me.

811
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,840
You’re doing a nice job.
Keep up the good work.

812
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,480
Copiague, Jericho, Bayville,
Valley Stream, man.

813
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,720
I want to turn Boyer’s
into a whole Long Island thing.

814
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,960
I want you to come to work for me, okay.
What do you think?

815
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,560
What can I do?

816
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,120
This is our town now.
You’re a part of it.

817
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,680
You’re a war hero, and you can benefit.
You should benefit, Ronnie.

818
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,240
You mean, partners?
We open a place together?

819
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,800
You got to walk before you run.

820
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,240
I could start you out as a cashier.

821
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,040
Then you could learn the business...

822
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,480
and eventually work your way up
to be manager.

823
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,160
Just like your dad.

824
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,560
I get $1,700 a month from the government.
I’ll take my time, look around.

825
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,360
That’s charity money.
This isn’t.

826
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,320
- Charity?
- Here’s your cola.

827
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:34,760
You got to put the war behind you.
Forget about this chair you’re in.

828
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,480
Sometimes, Stevie...

829
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,800
people know you’re back from Vietnam,
and their face changes, the eyes...

830
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,800
the voice, the way they look at you.

831
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,840
I know, but people here...

832
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,960
they don’t give a shit about the war.

833
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,720
It’s just a million miles away.
It’s all bullshit, anyway.

834
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,280
The government sold us a bill of goods
and we bought it.

835
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,120
We got the shit kicked out of us.

836
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,880
What do you mean "we"?
You were in college.

837
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,600
It was you who bought
that communist bullshit.

838
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,400
They were going to take over the world.
Remember that?

839
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,320
Finnelli, you, Walsh.

840
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,360
The whole town was devastated.

841
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,400
For what? For lies?
For bullshit lies?

842
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,600
They burn the flag, demonstrate against us
on the cover of today’s paper.

843
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,240
They have no respect.

844
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,920
They have no idea what’s going on there,
the men sacrificing their lives.

845
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,240
Nobody here seems to care.
It’s a bunch of goddamned shit.

846
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,720
Don’t take the Lord’s name in vain,
not in front of the children.

847
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,320
- I agree with everything you say.
- I served my country.

848
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,400
They just want to take from it,
that’s what I think.

849
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,920
I got to do some homework.

850
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,560
The other side’s angry
because we’re not winning.

851
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,240
How can we win?

852
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,400
- Tommy, what’s the matter?
- Nothing.

853
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,760
- Anybody listening here? Tommy?
- What?

854
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,880
Tommy’s going to fail English.

855
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,160
He doesn’t believe in the war.

856
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,040
What?

857
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:12,840
He thinks we’re doing the wrong thing
over there. He thinks it’s all a mistake.

858
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,600
Mistake? What’s this? Spit it out.
You believe in demonstrators?

859
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,400
What? You don’t talk anymore?
You don’t think we’re right.

860
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,320
I just don’t agree
with everything you’re saying.

861
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,040
- I don’t think you understand.
- I don’t understand?

862
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,040
He’s hanging around with long-hairs
who take drugs.

863
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,160
- They smoke pot.
- That’s not the reason.

864
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,600
Have they ever worked?

865
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,160
You want to burn the flag?
Huh, Tommy?

866
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,520
What is it?

867
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,000
You want to bring down this country?

868
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,800
Love it or leave it, Tommy.

869
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,080
All they’re trying to say
is they don’t want more people...

870
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,840
to come back like you.

871
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,080
That’s an easy excuse.

872
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,160
Where were they
when their country needed them?

873
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,720
You served your country.

874
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,440
What did you get out of it?
Look at you.

875
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,560
Well, look at me.

876
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,880
Look at you, man.

877
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,760
- I got to go. I’ll see you around.
- What’s wrong with me, Tommy?

878
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,920
<i>Is there something wrong with me?</i>

879
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,000
<i>I volunteered, Tommy!</i>

880
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,520
You don’t know what you’re talking about!
Were you there?

881
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,320
You can just love it or leave it, Tommy.

882
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:27,560
I can’t believe what Tommy
just said to me.

883
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,200
Parade time, Ronnie.

884
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,760
You tell them I’ll be right there,
all right?

885
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,880
<i>Hurry up.</i>

886
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,000
What kind of car is it?

887
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,520
- I think it’s a Continental.
- Continental?

888
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,400
- A convertibIe.
- Yeah.

889
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,040
- They said it would be.
- Coming up in the world.

890
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,440
Massapequa - July 4, 1969

891
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,840
Die!

892
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,640
<i>Today is July the fourth,
and I believe in America.</i>

893
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,880
<i>And I believe in Americanism.</i>

894
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,160
<i>But most of all...</i>

895
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,680
<i>I believe in victory for America.</i>

896
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,560
<i>Some people are starting to say
the war is wrong...</i>

897
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,320
<i>that we shouldn’t be there.</i>

898
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,040
<i>Some people would like to tear
our country down.</i>

899
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,560
<i>But who are the kids
defending their right to protest?</i>

900
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,000
<i>These are the kids
who care about our country.</i>

901
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:09,680
<i>Kids who have respect for their flag
and their parents and their government...</i>

902
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,760
<i>and their religion.</i>

903
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,240
<i>Kids like Joey Walsh.</i>

904
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,520
<i>He was the first.</i>

905
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,160
<i>We got a street in the park
named after him.</i>

906
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,640
<i>And Danny Topinka...</i>

907
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,920
<i>Billy Vorsovich...</i>

908
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,800
<i>Phil and Larry Powell...</i>

909
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,720
<i>Tommy Finnelli.</i>

910
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,400
<i>Six boys from Massapequa...</i>

911
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,560
<i>and they all knew what honor,
duty, and sacrifice meant.</i>

912
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,320
<i>They paid the highest price.
They died for it.</i>

913
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,000
<i>This town’s been hit hard.
It’s always been hit hard.</i>

914
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,400
<i>Doc here, he was in the First War.</i>

915
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:52,040
<i>A lot of us here were in the Second.
That’s why we can’t give up.</i>

916
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,680
<i>Thats why we’re going to win in Vietnam.</i>

917
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,080
<i>Because Massapequa’s been there before...</i>

918
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,360
<i>because of those six wonderful boys...</i>

919
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,840
<i>and because of him.</i>

920
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,920
<i>Ron, come say a few words,
would you, please?</i>

921
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,240
<i>Ron Kovac, ladies and gentlemen,
was born on the 4th of July, 1946.</i>

922
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,040
<i>Give him a big hand
on his great birthday.</i>

923
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,760
<i>I just want to say for all the guys
in Vietnam that we’re doing our best.</i>

924
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,400
<i>lt’s not an easy situation...</i>

925
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,040
<i>but the boys’ morale
over there is real high...</i>

926
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,440
<i>and you can feel confident
that we are going to win that war.</i>

927
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:54,320
<i>I served my country,
and I don’t want you to feel sorry for me.</i>

928
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,880
<i>Do not shed a tear.</i>

929
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,240
<i>I have my hands,
my eyes, my ears....</i>

930
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,560
<i>I have my heart...</i>

931
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,280
<i>and I have what I feel....</i>

932
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,760
<i>I have what I feel is...</i>

933
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,000
<i>an unquenchable....</i>

934
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,000
- It’s okay, Ronnie.
- It’s okay, kid.

935
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,000
I’m sorry.

936
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,960
<i>And we’ll continue to fight
because of guys like Ron Kovic....</i>

937
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,080
Dad, where’s the car?

938
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,360
It’s across the street.

939
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,600
<i>Like he said,
we’re going to win that war.</i>

940
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,680
Ronnie.

941
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,640
Timmy?

942
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,400
I heard you were....
When did you get back?

943
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,040
When did you get out?

944
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,160
Wow, man.

945
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,160
Let’s get the hell out of here.

946
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,320
- Mr. Kovic?
- Sure.

947
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,560
<i>Many antiwar demonstrators
have come to Washington, D.C...</i>

948
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,240
<i>to shut the city down.</i>

949
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,560
<i>Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In.</i>

950
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,720
<i>Starring Dan Rowan and Dick Martin...</i>

951
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,000
<i>with Sammy Davis, Jr...</i>

952
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,480
<i>and Judy Came....</i>

953
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,040
Honey, come on, it’s starting.

954
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,360
- <i>Okay.</i>
- It’s the one with Sammy Davis.

955
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,440
Oh, yeah?

956
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,400
- Who else used to play?
- Come on, Ronnie.

957
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:26,120
- Come on. Tell me who.
- Bobby Moore at shortstop.

958
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,760
- Grady Rogers at third.
- Grady got sick. It was Finnelli at third.

959
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,680
Tommy Finnelli. Yeah.

960
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,440
Got hit with one of his own mortars
up at the DMZ.

961
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,840
- That’s crazy, man.
- Shit, I heard about that.

962
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,240
Remember the twins,
Phil and Larry Powell?

963
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,760
The twins.
They were great wrestlers.

964
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,560
They were fucking great.
Tough bastards.

965
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,400
When Phil got killed...

966
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,560
Larry, who wasn’t much too much
in the brains department either...

967
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,280
- went down the next day and joined up.
- Oh, God.

968
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,560
- Then he got hit.
- Oh, no.

969
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,280
- I’m telling you it’s true.
- Right away?

970
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,760
A land mine or something.

971
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,280
He got hit in the head with a tree,
for Christ’s sake. Yeah.

972
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,880
I’m telling you the truth.

973
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:12,080
He goes over to Vietnam,
and he gets killed by a flying fucking tree.

974
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:19,160
That’s really fucking funny.
I think the whole town got devastated.

975
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,720
I don’t think we got
a fucking friend left.

976
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,040
It’s really funny.

977
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,240
When did you get hit, Timmy?

978
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,240
September 18.

979
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,800
Near Dong Ha.

980
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,280
A lot of bad shit up there.
I’m telling you.

981
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,520
Things I don’t even want to talk about.
You know....

982
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,120
It was crazy.

983
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,760
Shooting anything that fucking moved.

984
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,320
When did you get hit?

985
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,200
Me? Well....

986
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,760
January 20.

987
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,040
Someplace off.... I don’t even remember.
Near some river up in the DMZ.

988
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,400
Walked into a whole battalion of them.
Got shot in the foot.

989
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,920
I just got up,
running around like I was...

990
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,440
back in the woods again,
like I was John fucking Wayne...

991
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,560
emptying a mag, screaming,
"Come on, Charlie, motherfucker.

992
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,360
"Come on out, Charlie, motherfucker!"

993
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,800
I heard a crack above my right ear,
and I just felt my body...

994
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,360
drop out from under me.

995
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,760
Christ, I thought I was dead for sure.

996
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,280
- How was the hospital?
- It sucked.

997
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,080
- I know.
- Really bad.

998
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,680
I’ll tell you something.
Sometimes at night...

999
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,040
I get these headaches,
you know. Bad.

1000
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,320
They just kind of come over me
and these fucking doctors don’t know shit.

1001
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,040
They just come,
like I’m going crazy or something.

1002
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,200
I don’t feel like me anymore,
you know?

1003
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,800
When they come,
I feel like somebody else.

1004
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:22,240
- What do you do when that happens?
- Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.

1005
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,240
Mostly I do a lot of drugs.

1006
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,960
Do anything you can.
You get through it any way you know how.

1007
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
When I was in the hospital, I thought,
"Yeah, this makes sense."

1008
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,000
- What makes sense.
- ‘Cause I failed, Timmy.

1009
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,240
What are you talking about?

1010
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,320
‘Cause I....

1011
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,480
‘Cause I killed someone,
some people.

1012
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,400
I made some terrible...

1013
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,000
mistakes.

1014
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,640
Christ’s sakes,
we all made mistakes.

1015
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,640
You had no choice.

1016
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,560
Those damn pansy demonstrators
will never understand.

1017
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,040
<i>You dont have to talk about it.
It was insane over there. It was crazy.</i>

1018
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,120
Sometimes I wish I’d....

1019
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:17,400
First time I got hit, I was shot in the foot,
I could have laid down.

1020
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,280
Who gives a fuck now
if I was a hero or not?

1021
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,240
I was paralyzed,
castrated that day. Why?

1022
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,440
‘Cause I was so stupid.

1023
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,600
I’d have my dick and my balls now
and I think....

1024
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:36,280
I think I’d give everything I believe in,
everything I got...

1025
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:40,200
all my values just to have my body again,
just to be whole again.

1026
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,920
But I’m not whole.
I never will be, and that’s...

1027
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,680
the way it is, isn’t it?

1028
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,280
For Christ’s sake, Ronnie.
It’s your birthday.

1029
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,440
You’re alive.

1030
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,440
You made it.

1031
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,920
<i>Smile.</i>

1032
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,520
<i>Syracuse, New York, next stop.</i>

1033
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,960
Those long letters I wrote you
from over there?

1034
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,560
- Crazy stuff.
- That’s all right.

1035
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,160
I had to say everything I couldn’t say
when we were growing up.

1036
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,280
They were beautiful letters.

1037
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,040
I wasn’t too sure
about the spelling in them.

1038
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,120
Who cares if you can spell?

1039
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,480
There was a lot of feeling in the words.

1040
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,440
I’m so sorry for what happened to you.

1041
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,120
My mom called me at school
and told me.

1042
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,920
I was just so shocked.

1043
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,760
I wanted to reach out and help you.

1044
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,400
It was just so frustrating.

1045
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:32,000
I just stood in the hallway
of my dorm room shaking.

1046
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,680
I couldn’t say anything.

1047
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,560
Donna.

1048
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:41,760
- They need you over at Locklin.
- I can’t right now, later.

1049
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,280
Don’t forget about the meeting.

1050
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,640
- 9:00?
- Yeah. Thanks.

1051
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,400
- I’m sorry.
- You’re real busy.

1052
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,440
We’ve got this Kent State
demonstration tomorrow.

1053
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,080
I’m on the organizing committee.

1054
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,600
Kent State.
I heard about that.

1055
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:59,480
- It was terrible.
- It’s terrible.

1056
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,720
When I saw that girl
lying in that pool of blood at Kent State...

1057
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:09,280
I kept on thinking of that poster
of the children that were killed at My Lai.

1058
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,080
And I kept on thinking
about you over there...

1059
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,880
and all the boys who’ve died...

1060
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,120
who’ve sacrificed their bodies
and their minds.

1061
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:26,080
The war is so wrong.
It’s so wrong.

1062
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,520
I just had to do something.

1063
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,440
<i>We dont need arms</i>

1064
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,520
<i>We need hands to hold</i>

1065
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:46,160
<i>And we don’t need bombs</i>

1066
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,920
Strike now, shut it down!

1067
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,160
I’m not saying that you are...

1068
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:01,400
but if you have any feelings
against the war, you could really help.

1069
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,880
You’ve been there.
You know what it’s like.

1070
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,040
You could tell people what’s happening,
and they’d really listen to you.

1071
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,680
Remember the prom?

1072
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,280
<i>Moon River
Wider than the sea</i>

1073
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,800
<i>My huckleberry friend</i>

1074
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,320
- Remember that?
- Yeah.

1075
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,960
<i>Moon River for me</i>

1076
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,040
Was I crazy that night,
running through the rain.

1077
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,840
<i>I just had to dance with you
before I went in.</i>

1078
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,880
<i>I just had to dance with you.
I don’t know, it was like I knew.</i>

1079
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:37,320
I made a promise to myself
that I would come back...

1080
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,840
and love you forever.

1081
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,240
The Reverend can’t make it tomorrow.

1082
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,200
- What?
- He can’t make it.

1083
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,480
What can we do?
Who can we get?

1084
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:53,120
- Just let me think. I’ll see you later.
- Better hurry.

1085
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,000
<i>I got to go inside.</i>

1086
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,760
<i>Do you want to come?</i>

1087
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,200
- No, I don’t think so.
- Okay.

1088
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,240
Maybe I’ll hang around.
Maybe we’ll talk later.

1089
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,560
I’ll see you later.

1090
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,840
One, two, three, four!
We don’t want your fucking war!

1091
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:42,040
Five, six, seven, eight!
We don’t want to escalate!

1092
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:50,920
<i>lt’s great to be
a free Syracuse University.</i>

1093
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:57,240
<i>We’re really getting
an education now, aren’t we?</i>

1094
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,680
- Right on, man! Shut it down!
- Right freaking on!

1095
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:06,480
<i>Yesterday I was at Brooklyn College, NYU.
They were both closed down.</i>

1096
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:11,200
<i>Over 200 high schools are closed down.
Over 400 universities are closed down.</i>

1097
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,400
<i>I’ll be twice that number by the time....</i>

1098
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,400
<i>This is an unlawful assembly.</i>

1099
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,200
<i>If you do not disperse....</i>

1100
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,800
<i>The people that killed
the kids at Kent State...</i>

1101
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,640
<i>have names like
General Waste-more-land.</i>

1102
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,040
<i>Spiro Agnew.</i>

1103
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,600
<i>Tricky Dicky Nixon.</i>

1104
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,800
<i>Wait for the command.</i>

1105
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,760
<i>And then we go to Washington...</i>

1106
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,680
<i>confront the war makers
in their own house.</i>

1107
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:48,320
<i>On to Washington.
On to the White House.</i>

1108
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,680
<i>I loved this country once.</i>

1109
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:00,520
<i>And all this I won over there.
Check it out.</i>

1110
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,320
<i>Purple Heart, Bronze Star...</i>

1111
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:08,200
<i>all of the commendation medals,
all the rest of that garbage...</i>

1112
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,000
<i>it don’t mean a thing.</i>

1113
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:13,040
<i>Fuck this shit.</i>

1114
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,840
<i>This is war.
I said this is war.</i>

1115
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,200
<i>They just killed two brothers
at Jackson State.</i>

1116
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,880
<i>Stand by to gas.</i>

1117
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,200
Take them down.

1118
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,320
What’s going on?

1119
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,480
Get out!
Get out of here!

1120
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,440
Get back! Get back!

1121
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,560
Donna!

1122
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:13,200
The whole world’s watching.

1123
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,400
Donna!

1124
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,360
My machine breaks down,
and they’re ready to cut my leg off.

1125
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,440
And that’s what the guy....

1126
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,640
That’s what the guy in the hospital said.
He said:

1127
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:02,040
"You can take your Vietnam,
and you can stuff it up your ass."

1128
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,520
That’s what it’s about in Vietnam.

1129
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,720
Hey, Mel!

1130
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,320
Double shot of rye,
beer chaser, sweetheart.

1131
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,000
They ain’t fighting the war to win, anyway.

1132
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:15,160
They should just bomb Hanoi
and get the boys the fuck out of there.

1133
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,960
Four, corner, hard way.

1134
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,240
Vietnam.

1135
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,080
They ought to write a song about
something that gets under your skin.

1136
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,480
<i>Remember Del Shannon?</i>
Runaway?

1137
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,800
<i>As I walk along</i>

1138
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:33,520
<i>I wonder what went wrong</i>

1139
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,240
<i>To our love</i>

1140
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,800
<i>A love that was so strong</i>

1141
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:44,560
<i>I’ll tell you what went wrong
It was fucking Vietnam</i>

1142
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:50,120
It was the wrong fucking war.

1143
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,040
Take a shot, will you?

1144
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,920
You can take your Vietnam...

1145
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,320
and you can shove it up
your fucking ass.

1146
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,560
You shove it up your ass, pal.

1147
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:03,760
Is everybody supposed to feel sorry
because you’re in a fucking wheelchair?

1148
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,680
- What?
- You ain’t the only fucking Marine here.

1149
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,560
I was on Iwo Jima.
We lost 5,000 men the first day.

1150
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,280
Don’t cry in your fucking beer to me.

1151
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,000
<i>You served and you lost.
You got to live with it.</i>

1152
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,280
You’re a Marine, man.
<i>Semper fi.</i>

1153
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,240
You picked them. They didn’t pick you.
Quit your fucking pissing and moaning.

1154
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:28,680
- Who is this asshole?
- I don’t know. Leave it alone.

1155
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,320
I think guys...

1156
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,440
like you...

1157
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,800
are dumb fucking assholes.
That’s what I think.

1158
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,240
I bet you do,
you sorry son of a bitch.

1159
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:44,320
‘Cause you know if they win,
your ass will be the first against the wall.

1160
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,360
You know you can’t trust
a fucking traitor.

1161
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,880
Call me a fucking traitor?

1162
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:53,600
If you weren’t in that chair....

1163
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,440
I am in this chair.

1164
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,720
- Top of the ninth, Charlie.
- Shut the fuck up.

1165
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,960
Come on, Phil, forget it.

1166
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,880
- Bullshit!
- He’s a nut job!

1167
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,520
Come on, Ronnie,
he ain’t fucking worth it.

1168
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,920
What’s happening?
What’s your name?

1169
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,400
Jenny.

1170
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,680
- Penny?
- Jenny.

1171
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
How about going to Mexico
with me tonight?

1172
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:20,120
Mexico?
What do you mean, Mexico?

1173
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,200
I mean, you’re really beautiful.
That’s what I mean.

1174
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,360
A really beautiful place...

1175
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,280
the ocean...

1176
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,960
the sand, sun.

1177
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:34,040
We could leave tonight.
We could take a plane. Let’s go tonight.

1178
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,920
I think you’re really crazy.

1179
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,320
- What’s going on?
 -Same old shit.

1180
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:00,520
- I bet you practiced a lot.
- I’ve got a lifetime of practice, Jenny.

1181
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,440
You all right?
I don’t mean to laugh.

1182
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:17,800
Shut up, Janet.

1183
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:20,000
Look at him.
He’s fucking shitfaced!

1184
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,520
Get back.
Give him some room.

1185
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,480
Get him the fuck out of here.

1186
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,040
Give me my chair.
I just want to dance.

1187
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,080
Give me my chair.

1188
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,560
I got it.

1189
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:54,160
Come on. Let’s go.
Come on.

1190
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,760
Come on. Let’s go.

1191
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,840
What’s going on?
Are you drunk again?

1192
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,360
Hey, Mom.

1193
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,840
He’s drunk again.
We have a drunk for a son.

1194
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,720
You leave that alone.

1195
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,800
You can’t stay in this house.

1196
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,240
This is what you believe in...

1197
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,600
but I don’t.

1198
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,120
I don’t believe in him any more.
He only spent three days up there.

1199
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,920
I have to spend the rest of my life.

1200
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,080
- I wish I were dead like him.
- You don’t know what you’re saying.

1201
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,960
That’s the problem. I’m not dead.
I got to live.

1202
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,600
I got to roll around
and remind them of Vietnam.

1203
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,400
<i>You don’t want to see us.</i>

1204
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,560
You want to hide us
‘cause it is a can of shit.

1205
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:49,560
- And I am a fucking dummy.
- He won’t listen. He won’t change.

1206
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:53,040
Take your mom seriously.
You can’t drink in this house.

1207
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:56,760
I believed everything they told us.
"Go fight! Go kill!

1208
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:01,880
"Sergeant man, Marine Corps! Yo, squad!
Left, squad, right!"

1209
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:06,400
And it’s all a lie.
The whole thing is a bunch of lies.

1210
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,600
<i>Stop it. Go to bed.
You sleep it off.</i>

1211
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:12,000
<i>What did they do to you in that war?
What happened to you?</i>

1212
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,080
You need help, Ronnie.

1213
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:15,320
You need help...

1214
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,880
with all your God
and your bullshit dreams about me.

1215
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,360
You are ashamed of me.
You’re embarrassed by me.

1216
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:25,080
Go to sleep.
You go to bed.

1217
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:29,000
- Fuck you.
- What did you say to me?

1218
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,520
Mom!

1219
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:33,720
Fuck you.

1220
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,600
You’ll wake the whole neighborhood.

1221
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,240
Wake them up.
Tell them.

1222
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,960
Cusacks, Camelettis, Walshes!

1223
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:44,120
You tell them all what they did to me...

1224
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:47,160
what they did to this whole block,
this whole country.

1225
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:51,000
- They’ll call the police.
- We went to Vietnam to stop communism.

1226
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:54,520
- We shot women and children.
- You didn’t shoot women and children.

1227
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,800
The Church blessed the war.
Communism, the insidious evil.

1228
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:01,800
- They told us to go.
- Yes, that’s what they told us.

1229
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,680
"Thou shall not kill," Mom.

1230
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:09,000
Thou shall not kill women and children.
Thou shall not kill, remember?

1231
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:13,240
- Isn’t that what you taught us?
- Stop it.

1232
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:18,760
I don’t want you in this house.
You’re out of this house.

1233
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:23,680
- You made your point.
- I haven’t made my point!

1234
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,600
They’re killing everyone now.

1235
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,520
- I didn’t force you to go.
- Yes, you did.

1236
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,880
And it’s all falling apart.

1237
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,160
King, Kennedy, Kent State.

1238
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:36,120
- We all lost the fucking war.
- It’s not my fault.

1239
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,680
Communism won.
It’s all for nothing.

1240
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,960
- That’s not true.
- How do you know? What do you know?

1241
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,120
<i>You tell her, Dad!</i>

1242
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,480
Tell her it’s a lie.
It’s a fucking lie.

1243
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:55,040
There’s no God. God is as dead as my legs.
There’s no God. There’s no country.

1244
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,640
It’s nothing. It’s just me
in this fucking wheelchair...

1245
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:02,720
for the rest of my life for nothing.

1246
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,440
Me and this....

1247
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:06,920
- This dead penis.
- Oh, God!

1248
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,520
- No, not with the catheter, for God’s sake.
- Penis!

1249
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,720
I can’t stand it any more.
To hell with you.

1250
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,600
In church they say it’s a sin...

1251
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,960
if you play with your penis.
I just wish I could.

1252
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,440
Don’t say "penis" in this house.

1253
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,960
- Penis!
- Stop!

1254
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,720
Penis.
Big fucking erect penis, Mom.

1255
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:29,920
- Stop!
- Penis. Penis.

1256
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,640
He won’t let go.
What can I do?

1257
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,640
I never even got time
to learn how to use it.

1258
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:37,080
It’s gone in some fucking jungle
over in Asia.

1259
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:39,080
Just gone for....

1260
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,640
I’m sorry it happened this way.

1261
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,320
I’m sorry you’re sad, Mom.

1262
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,200
I’m so sorry you’re sad.

1263
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,640
I’m so fucked up.

1264
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:29,440
Maybe a little trip
is all you need.

1265
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,280
That place in Mexico
you were talking about.

1266
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:36,480
I don’t want to go to Mexico.
I don’t want to go no place.

1267
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,920
I think you should go.

1268
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,040
What can I do?

1269
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,840
What do you want?

1270
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,720
I want to be a man again.

1271
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,000
Who’s going to love me, Dad?

1272
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,800
Who’s ever going to love me?

1273
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,560
Who’s going to love me?

1274
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:47,640
Villa Dulce, Mexico - 1970

1275
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:56,000
<i>You maggots, ante up, US $5.
Let’s go. Ante up.</i>

1276
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,560
<i>Ed, you’re light.</i>

1277
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,760
<i>The game is seven-card stud,
one up, two down.</i>

1278
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:03,880
<i>One up, two down.
We got a five, a jack.</i>

1279
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:06,040
<i>That’s a fucking joker, a king.</i>

1280
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:09,280
<i>A bullet, the price of poker
just went up, gentlemen.</i>

1281
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,160
<i>Charlie buys a queen.</i>

1282
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,200
<i>Two down, two down.</i>

1283
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,680
Big blue eyes,
what’s your name?

1284
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:22,520
- What’s that?
- What’s your name?

1285
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,800
Ron. Ron Kovic.

1286
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,440
- Just what we need. Another limp dick.
- Where from?

1287
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,040
Massapequa, Long Island.

1288
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:31,360
Say hello to Ron Kovic.
Just in from the States.

1289
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:32,600
Hi, Ron.

1290
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,400
Laugh, motherfucker.
Go ahead, you’ll get yours.

1291
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,800
Fuck you.

1292
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,640
Put your hand in my crotch.

1293
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:43,800
- What’s your name?
- Charlie, from Chicago.

1294
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:48,000
- How long has this game been going on?
- Fifty-five hours.

1295
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:49,880
How long you been here?

1296
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,360
A hundred fucking years.

1297
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,240
‘Cause I got a gun.

1298
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:56,120
I ain’t ever going back.
Fuck the States.

1299
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:59,080
<i>Nobody understood.
Nobody gave a shit.</i>

1300
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:03,480
The fucking women
didn’t even want to look at me.

1301
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:06,200
Fucking States.
I ain’t never going back.

1302
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,800
<i>I want something simple.</i>

1303
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,200
You’re so beautiful.

1304
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,120
Ain’t she beautiful?

1305
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:16,000
She’s beautiful.

1306
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:19,000
Go into town.
Get yourself one.

1307
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,280
Fuck the shit out of you,
even if you are paralyzed.

1308
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,880
Ain’t that right, Martha?

1309
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,760
You know what they say:
If you ain’t got it in the hips...

1310
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:28,000
you better have it in the lips.

1311
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:33,760
Don’t stay here, man.
Get the fuck out.

1312
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:39,040
You’re really drunk
on this mescal shit...

1313
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,280
when you swallow the worm
and don’t even know you did it.

1314
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:47,600
Last round of betting.
Let’s go, maggots.

1315
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,280
Are you from Villa Dulce?

1316
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:01,560
Yeah.

1317
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,760
- We go?
- What’s that?

1318
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,280
Do you want to go upstairs?

1319
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:11,120
No, I’m just looking around.

1320
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:15,160
I just came in.
Yeah, I’d like to go upstairs.

1321
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:21,920
- Good. Then come.
- Let’s do it.

1322
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,760
- What’s your name?
- Maria Elena.

1323
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:44,800
The money.

1324
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,240
Sorry, I don’t know how much.

1325
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,560
This is good.

1326
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,600
Why don’t you take them off?

1327
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:01,400
It doesn’t matter. I can’t feel anything.
I was paralyzed in the war.

1328
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,480
- Vietnam?
- Yes.

1329
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:07,800
You let me see?

1330
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:09,840
No. Doesn’t move.

1331
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,400
I can’t. It’s no good.

1332
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:16,640
- Yes, let me see.
- No. Look, please.

1333
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:20,600
The spine was severed.
I have no movement, no feeling.

1334
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,960
There’s nothing down here at all.

1335
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,600
Nothing happens.

1336
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,840
We’re going to have a good time.

1337
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,160
It’s going to be okay.

1338
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,080
- You like?
- Yes. You’re very pretty.

1339
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:13,280
How was it?

1340
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:19,160
Did you get one?
Did you get two?

1341
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:22,360
Look out.
Banzai, motherfucker.

1342
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,280
She loves you, right, tiger?

1343
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,400
Thanks a lot.
It was great.

1344
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,840
Just remember:
keep one hand on her tits...

1345
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:40,280
and the other hand on your wallet.

1346
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,160
Paradise.
Right, man?

1347
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,480
Can I see this?

1348
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:48,960
<i>Yeah, I’ll do it, man.</i>

1349
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:52,640
<i>It don’t mean a fucking thing.</i>

1350
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,280
I’ll be here tomorrow.

1351
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:58,520
You couldn’t keep me away
with a baseball bat.

1352
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:00,480
I’ll be here for sure.

1353
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,560
- We get married today?
- Yeah, that would be great.

1354
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:44,800
Hi.

1355
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:49,480
Want to fuck me, mister?

1356
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,560
I’ll give you a blow job?

1357
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:04,760
Mister, you want me?
60 pesos.

1358
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:10,640
Let’s go.

1359
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,640
<i>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Wilson...</i>

1360
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:23,040
<i>I don’t know how to tell you this.</i>

1361
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,360
<i>I knew your son in Vietnam.</i>

1362
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,240
<i>He was....</i>

1363
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,040
I’m going to kill that fucking guy.

1364
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:37,600
I got him once.
I’ll kill him now.

1365
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:41,520
<i>You’ll see. I’m serious.</i>

1366
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:46,840
Your body.

1367
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:50,400
I’m just going to fucking kill him.

1368
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:54,040
I’ll fucking kill you.

1369
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:59,360
I’ll kill you, bitch.
You can’t talk to me like that.

1370
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,360
Get out.

1371
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:06,640
The bitch thinks it’s funny
I can’t move my dick.

1372
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:08,640
Fuck her.

1373
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:10,960
I’ll kill you, bitch.

1374
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,600
Fuck all you Mexican motherfuckers.

1375
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:19,040
You don’t like it, get out.

1376
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,000
Don’t touch my friend.

1377
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:26,400
- Don’t you touch me.
- Get the hell out.

1378
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,400
Don’t come back no more.

1379
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:31,800
I wouldn’t be here
if it weren’t for that fucking war.

1380
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:34,640
Fuck all of you!

1381
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:40,080
- You sure you told him the right place?
- I told him fucking Villa Rosa!

1382
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:45,400
Villa Rosa, <i>señor.</i>
Beautiful place. You’ll see.

1383
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:47,760
Great whorehouse there, man.
Wait until we get there.

1384
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:50,320
Beautiful <i>señoritas</i>
with big tits, small tits--

1385
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:53,880
That goddamned fucking slut.
That Mexican scumbag cunt.

1386
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:58,240
I think I saw a sign, Villa Rosa,
10 minutes ago.

1387
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:00,480
How far you going, taco head?

1388
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:04,600
Wasn’t that turn back there?
That sign that said "Villa Rosa"?

1389
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:08,320
Look at the meter. It’s rigged.
He’s rigged the fucking meter.

1390
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,760
I told you fucking Villa Rosa!

1391
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,400
- What are we going to do now?
- Fuck them.

1392
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:34,480
Yeah, sure.
How we going to get out of here?

1393
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:37,880
Fuck them all.
Fuck the whores.

1394
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,520
Fuck the cab drivers.

1395
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,280
Fuck Mexico.

1396
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:44,760
Fuck Nixon, fuck Vietnam,
fuck them all.

1397
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,800
But how we going to get out of here?

1398
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:48,960
They made me kill babies, man.

1399
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:52,400
Little gook babies.
You ever have to kill a baby?

1400
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:56,480
Okay, come on. We’ll get a ride.
We got to get back to the villa.

1401
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:59,840
Fuck you!
What do you mean, okay?

1402
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:04,520
What do you mean, "okay"?
You ever have to kill a little gook baby?

1403
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,320
What the fuck do you know what I did?

1404
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:12,160
- I didn’t think so. You’re full of shit.
- No, you are.

1405
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,680
Leave me the fuck alone.
You’re nuts.

1406
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:19,640
The fucking sun is going down.
We got to get out of here.

1407
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:22,520
Don’t shit me, Kovic.
You never killed a baby.

1408
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:24,760
You never had to kill a baby.

1409
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:28,440
You never put your soul into that war,
never put your soul on the line.

1410
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,160
How the fuck do you know?

1411
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:33,640
Maybe I killed more babies
than you did, you fuck.

1412
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:37,760
Maybe I did, but I don’t talk about it.
I don’t have to talk about it.

1413
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:40,000
Why the fuck not?

1414
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:43,080
What are you hiding?
What are you, better than anybody else?

1415
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:44,960
You a hero?
Is that what you are?

1416
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,960
Maybe you got a bunch of medals,
but deep down you’re full of shit.

1417
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:52,120
You never fought that war.
You weren’t even there.

1418
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:59,120
What do you mean,
I wasn’t there?

1419
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:00,960
Come on, hero, come clean.

1420
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,800
- Why should I?
- What are you hiding?

1421
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:06,080
You’re the one
that’s hiding here in Mexico.

1422
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:08,960
- What are you hiding from?
- Don’t shit me.

1423
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,080
- You never killed a baby, anybody, did you?
- Did you?

1424
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,640
Ever look at yourself
in the fucking mirror?

1425
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:17,560
- Fuck you.
- You.

1426
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,160
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

1427
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:36,800
Get off me!

1428
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,360
We need a ride.

1429
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:10,080
- You okay, man?
- Fuck you. You’re full of shit.

1430
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,640
You don’t get it.

1431
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:15,160
I had a town once...

1432
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:19,640
had a mother and father.
Things that made sense.

1433
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:22,360
Do you remember things
that made sense...

1434
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:24,640
things you could count on...

1435
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:27,640
before we all got so lost?

1436
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:36,600
What are we going to do?

1437
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,640
What am I going to do?

1438
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:47,880
What am I going to do?

1439
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:23,480
<i>Where you from, Wilson?</i>

1440
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:24,640
<i>Venus, Georgia.</i>

1441
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:29,440
<i>Georgia? This is my second tour.
I haven’t seen a Georgia boy get hurt yet.</i>

1442
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:37,800
<i>Yeah, I know about Wilson.</i>

1443
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:40,280
<i>Sir, I think I might
have killed him, sir.</i>

1444
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:43,480
- <i>I think I might have killed him.</i>
- <i>I don’t think so.</i>

1445
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:31,720
You don’t have to worry about them dogs.
They won’t bite.

1446
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:36,800
Y’all get away now.
Get on away.

1447
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:39,160
It’s all right.

1448
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:42,200
They’re probably just afraid
of that chair.

1449
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:44,360
Mr. Wilson, I’m Ron.

1450
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:47,080
Thanks for seeing me.

1451
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:50,080
Any friend of Billy’s
is a friend of ours.

1452
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,880
Why don’t you come on in the house?

1453
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:58,080
My wife fixed some chicken,
if you want some.

1454
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:03,200
It was a real nice funeral.

1455
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:06,520
Marine Honor Guard
came all the way down from Atlanta...

1456
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,320
in their fancy uniforms.

1457
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:13,360
Fired their rifles up in the sky.
The drums was beating.

1458
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,680
‘Course it was nothing like the big war
100 years ago down here.

1459
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:24,680
But there was Billy and Bruce Crabtree...

1460
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,400
Andy Henderson.

1461
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:32,200
- And the Rutledge boy, Lance.
- He was a nice boy.

1462
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:37,160
<i>For the life of me,
I still can’t quite figure that war out.</i>

1463
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:39,960
<i>Why we had to go
all that dang way to fight it.</i>

1464
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:43,680
<i>And why’s we had to lose
so many young men.</i>

1465
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:45,600
<i>Can’t figure it out.</i>

1466
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:50,440
<i>But we got a proud tradition
here in this town.</i>

1467
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:54,240
<i>Billy’s great-grandfather
was at the First Bull Run.</i>

1468
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:57,280
<i>My pa was over in France in ’18.</i>

1469
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:00,920
Don’t forget,
you were over in the Pacific in ‘44.

1470
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,160
- Guadalcanal.
- Is that right?

1471
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:09,240
I guess this family’s fought in every war
that this country’s ever had.

1472
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:13,960
<i>I reckon we’re ready to do it again
if we have to.</i>

1473
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:20,920
‘Course they never did know
what done happened and all.

1474
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:26,520
There was a letter from a colonel,
I think it was.

1475
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:30,080
- Col. Moore.
- That’s right, Col. Moore.

1476
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:33,080
<i>He said there was
a bad ambush one night.</i>

1477
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:36,480
Said that Billy distinguished himself
in the fighting.

1478
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:40,760
He also told us that Billy died real quick.

1479
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,640
That’s good that he died quick.

1480
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:59,200
I was his squad Ieader.

1481
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:02,880
I didn’t know Billy real well.
He was new, kind of quiet.

1482
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,680
We didn’t talk much to new guys.

1483
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:11,640
- He was 19, is that right?
- That’s right.

1484
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:14,920
- Only son?
- Yes, sir. My only boy.

1485
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:19,800
I think he said he was married
and you were pregnant?

1486
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,560
I remember the day he was killed.

1487
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:29,160
It was a strange day.

1488
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:32,440
We were out on patrol
near a beach area...

1489
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:37,400
and it was very confusing.
There was screaming and firing.

1490
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,440
It was getting late...

1491
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:47,000
and there were these children...

1492
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:54,120
these babies that we killed by mistake.

1493
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,560
How awful.

1494
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:03,160
And then it got really crazy.

1495
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:10,400
<i>Then we had to pull back
because the NVA were coming up on us.</i>

1496
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:13,640
<i>And we got scattered in the dunes.</i>

1497
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:17,760
<i>People were yelling at anything,
firing at anything.</i>

1498
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,440
<i>And that was when it happened.</i>

1499
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:24,920
<i>I was confused...</i>

1500
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:26,560
<i>scared.</i>

1501
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:36,080
I raised my rifle three times...

1502
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:42,160
<i>and shots....</i>

1503
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:49,400
<i>The body fell in the dunes.</i>

1504
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,760
God, this is very difficult
for me to say.

1505
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,120
We don’t have to hear this, Ron.

1506
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:01,280
But I think I was the one
that killed your son.

1507
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:04,360
I was the one.

1508
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:09,760
I was the one.

1509
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:29,600
What’s done is done.

1510
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:34,760
I can’t ever forgive you,
but maybe the Lord can.

1511
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,720
We understand, Ron.

1512
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:56,800
We understand the pain
you’ve been going through.

1513
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:15,160
Peace now!

1514
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:20,760
Bring our brothers home now!

1515
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:29,680
One, two, three, four,
we don’t want your fucking war!

1516
02:01:56,440 --> 02:02:00,120
<i>Drugs. Marijuana.
Traffic violations.</i>

1517
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:01,640
<i>Separate the hippies.</i>

1518
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:05,440
<i>Tonight, I again proudly accept
your nomination...</i>

1519
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:07,920
<i>for President of the United States.</i>

1520
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:13,640
<i>And let us pledge ourselves
to win an even greater victory...</i>

1521
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:15,840
<i>this November in 1972.</i>

1522
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:20,560
<i>Four more years.</i>

1523
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:33,240
<i>Can I break through your complacency?</i>

1524
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:37,200
Do you have compassion
for the people suffering in this war?

1525
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:40,160
Do you hear me when I tell you
that this war is a crime?

1526
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:43,400
<i>I’m not as bitter about my wounds....</i>

1527
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:45,720
Who do you think you are?

1528
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:48,520
Can I help you, sir?
You can’t come through.

1529
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:51,440
- You can’t come through, sir.
- I have a pass.

1530
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:58,800
Who are these people?

1531
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:02,320
You can’t stop us.
You can’t stop me.

1532
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:07,000
Why are you here tonight?
What do you have to say to these people?

1533
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,800
My name’s Ron Kovic.
I’m a Vietnam veteran.

1534
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:14,640
I’m here tonight
to say that this war is wrong...

1535
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:17,720
that this society lied to me
and my brothers.

1536
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:20,640
<i>It deceived the people
in this country.</i>

1537
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:24,080
<i>It tricked them into going 13,000 miles...</i>

1538
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:28,080
<i>to fight a war
against a poor peasant people...</i>

1539
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:30,760
<i>who have a proud history of resistance...</i>

1540
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:34,280
<i>who have been struggling
for their own independence...</i>

1541
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:36,520
<i>for 1,000 years.
The Vietnamese people.</i>

1542
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:40,280
<i>I cant find the words to express...</i>

1543
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:43,160
<i>how the leadership
of this government sickens me.</i>

1544
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:46,360
<i>People say....</i>

1545
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:50,280
<i>People say if you don’t love America
then get the hell out.</i>

1546
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:53,720
<i>I love America.
We love the people of America very much...</i>

1547
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:56,560
<i>but when it comes to the government,
it stops right there.</i>

1548
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:59,160
<i>The government is a bunch
of corrupt thieves.</i>

1549
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:00,960
<i>They are rapists and robbers.</i>

1550
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:04,320
<i>We are here to say
we don’t have to take it anymore.</i>

1551
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:06,880
<i>We are here to tell the truth.</i>

1552
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,800
<i>They’re killing our brothers in Vietnam.
We want them to hear the truth.</i>

1553
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:12,400
Traitor.

1554
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,480
What are you, a communist?

1555
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:25,680
Is this what we get, sir?
Spit in the face?

1556
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:29,640
We’re never going to let
the people of United States forget that war.

1557
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:31,840
Four more years.

1558
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:36,120
<i>You’re not sweeping it under the rug
because you didn’t like the ratings.</i>

1559
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:39,800
This wheelchair, our wheelchairs,
this steel, our steel...

1560
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,400
is your Memorial Day on wheels.

1561
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:44,040
We’re your
Yankee Doodle Dandy come home.

1562
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,480
<i>Let’s reject any philosophy...</i>

1563
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:50,400
<i>that would make us
a divided people of America.</i>

1564
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:53,640
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!

1565
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:08,200
Some sort of scuffle or commotion
has broken out on the convention floor.

1566
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:10,800
Disabled veterans
protesting the Vietnam War.

1567
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:12,840
We’ll try to get a mike down there.

1568
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:17,160
<i>Why are they gassing us in the parking lot?
Why are they fighting us?</i>

1569
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:20,200
<i>Because it’s a lie.
The truth is, they’ve killed...</i>

1570
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:22,480
a whole generation of young men.

1571
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:25,560
They have sacrificed
a whole generation of young men.

1572
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:27,200
Stop the bombing!

1573
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:31,560
Communists!

1574
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:44,320
Stop the bombing.
Stop the war.

1575
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:47,560
Traitor! Go home!

1576
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:04,280
<i>I say to you tonight...</i>

1577
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:08,320
<i>in these times.</i>

1578
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:11,360
<i>when there is so much
of a tendency to run down...</i>

1579
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:15,000
<i>those who have served America
in the past and today...</i>

1580
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:18,440
<i>let’s give those
who have served in Vietnam...</i>

1581
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:22,240
<i>the honor and the respect
that they deserve and that they’ve earned.</i>

1582
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:26,520
One, two, three, four,
we don’t like your fucking war.

1583
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:35,880
Get the car.

1584
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:37,280
Shut the fuck up.

1585
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:39,360
You’re under arrest, Kovic!
Come on!

1586
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:41,520
- What?
- Shut up!

1587
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:42,840
You’re a pig?

1588
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:45,560
You should’ve died over there,
you traitor.

1589
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:47,360
I don’t have balance.

1590
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:49,520
Give me your fucking hands.

1591
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:51,840
Okay, I’ll go with you.

1592
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:58,920
I don’t have any stomach muscles.
I don’t have balance.

1593
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,360
Take it easy.

1594
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:03,960
Get your hands behind you.

1595
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:05,320
I’m paralyzed.

1596
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:07,720
Get those cameras out of here.

1597
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:12,560
I’m paralyzed.

1598
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:15,360
Get in the fucking car.

1599
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:30,160
My chair!

1600
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:55,000
<i>Tactical line!</i>

1601
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:58,120
<i>Advance and disperse the crowd!</i>

1602
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:03,400
Let me go.

1603
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:04,680
- You okay?
- I’m okay.

1604
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:07,000
- Doc, is he okay?
- I’m okay.

1605
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:08,160
How we doing here?

1606
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:10,000
- How many fingers you got?
- Ten.

1607
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:12,640
Your head is cut.
Anyplace else hurting?

1608
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:14,520
I’m okay.
Where’s my chair?

1609
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:19,720
You’re cut over your eye.

1610
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:21,080
The media’s got to see this.

1611
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:23,000
We heard you shouted down Nixon.

1612
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:25,720
Eddie was arrested,
they beat Peterson...

1613
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:29,480
O’Malley’s gassed real bad
and Piscatelli’s got a concussion.

1614
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:32,360
It’s a fucking mess over there.

1615
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:35,360
Frankie, bring the media to the gate.

1616
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:37,160
- What?
- The pigs are coming.

1617
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:40,560
They’re clearing the park.
They’ve arrested, like, 30 people--

1618
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:42,000
Listen up!

1619
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:46,200
We’re going to take the hall back.
You hear that?

1620
02:08:46,280 --> 02:08:48,040
We’re going to the gate...

1621
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:50,440
we’re gonna take
the motherfucking hall back.

1622
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:52,280
Fall out! Let’s move!

1623
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:36,360
<i>Let us reject the notion...</i>

1624
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:38,960
Four years later - Democratic National
Convention - New York City, 1976

1625
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,320
<i>of politics of the few,
by the few, and for the few.</i>

1626
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:43,400
<i>We dedicate ourselves to the notion..</i>

1627
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:48,080
<i>that this is a government of the people,
by the people, and for all the people.</i>

1628
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:52,520
<i>black, brown, red, yellow, white, women...</i>

1629
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:55,200
<i>young, old, workers, students.</i>

1630
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:57,600
<i>This is our land in this country.</i>

1631
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,920
Ransom, the feminist,
she’s six minutes over.

1632
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,600
I got the Jackson people
breathing down my neck.

1633
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:07,080
Who follows?
It’s not gonna be a problem.

1634
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:10,360
Mr. Kovic?
We’re just about ready for you.

1635
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:12,280
Can I get you anything?

1636
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:14,440
Let’s do it.

1637
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:16,760
Okay, Ron. It’s your time.

1638
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:20,800
It’s been a long way to get here.
Tell them what it is, Ron.

1639
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:23,160
Come on, Ronnie.

1640
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:25,360
Go get them, man.
For Eddie, man.

1641
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:27,160
Ronnie for President!

1642
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:30,080
The whole world’s watching.
I love you.

1643
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,800
All right, Frankie.

1644
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:33,320
I feel good.

1645
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:35,120
Ronnie for President.

1646
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:37,800
Congratulations.

1647
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:40,720
I love what you’re doing.

1648
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:44,320
Clear a path for me, please.
Stand back. Thank you.

1649
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:48,360
<i>I had a dream, Ronnie.</i>

1650
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:50,960
<i>You were speaking to a large crowd.</i>

1651
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:53,920
<i>And you were saying great things.</i>

1652
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:06,240
<i>Our next speaker is one
of our Vietnam veterans...</i>

1653
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:09,800
<i>who has something very special
to say tonight.</i>

1654
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:12,400
<i>Please...</i>

1655
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:15,440
<i>please be quiet.</i>

1656
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:16,640
Coming up top.

1657
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:19,200
What will you say tonight, Mr. Kovic?

1658
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:23,160
- I’m just going to tell the truth.
- Any plans for the future?

1659
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:25,040
I guess we’ll see.

1660
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:27,560
Mr. Kovic, could you please
sign your book?

1661
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:31,280
<i>A young man who comes
from Massapequa, Long Island.</i>

1662
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:34,240
Coming through.

1663
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:37,040
All right, sweetheart.
Straight on through.

1664
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:39,760
How does it feel
to address the entire country?

1665
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:43,840
Overwhelming, an honor....

1666
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:46,600
It’s been a long way for us, the vets.

1667
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:51,720
Just lately, I’ve felt like I’m home.

1668
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:55,840
Like, maybe we’re home.

1669
02:11:57,560 --> 02:11:59,600
Welcome home, Ronnie.

1670
02:11:59,640 --> 02:12:01,240
Go get them, Ron!
