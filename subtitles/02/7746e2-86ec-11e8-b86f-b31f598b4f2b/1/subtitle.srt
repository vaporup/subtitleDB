Director Guka OMAROVA

12
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,420
They said he can't study
with normal kids.

13
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,540
They said he can't study
with normal kids.

14
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,380
Look here...

15
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,300
He's just like that - he'll do
whatever they tell him.

16
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,380
Stretch your arms out.
Close your eyes.

17
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Touch the end of your nose
with your finger.

18
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,260
Don't rush. One more time.

19
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,220
Well, of course he is slow

20
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,620
but basically he isn't dangerous,
he won't hurt anybody.

21
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,340
- What's your name?
- Schizo.

22
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,140
What Schizo?

23
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,740
They tease him like that at school.
He's Mustafa.

24
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,020
How old is he?

25
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,980
He'll be 15 soon.

26
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,620
Mother, you stay in corridor for
a while. I'll talk to him myself.

27
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,740
Okay.

28
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,380
Get dressed.

29
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,140
Why did you get kicked
out of school?

30
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,060
Bakha said,
"Do you wanna bonk Anelka?"

31
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,380
And you?

32
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,900
I said, "I do."

33
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,740
And then what?

34
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,180
And then

35
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,180
Bakha pushed me into the cloakroom
with the girls

36
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,180
and they bonked me themselves
on the head.

37
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,940
That's it?

38
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,780
I don't remember anything else.

39
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,700
Does your head hurt?

40
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,060
It hurts.

41
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,740
Go call your mother and
wait in the corridor.

42
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,780
Buy him this medicine, have him take
two pills at a time.

43
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,220
How is he, Victor lvanovich?

44
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,260
He has some deviations. You have to
go to the city, to a specialist.

45
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,980
Come by in a couple of weeks
for the paperwork.

46
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,300
You will have to pay, understood?

47
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,780
Of course I understand.
I'm already saving.

48
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,100
This is from our place...
sour cream, eggs...

49
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,420
Maybe I should talk to the teacher?

50
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,020
No, don't bother. I don't want to go
to that school.

51
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,740
You're right. You'll work for me!

52
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,580
And what if I can't do it?

53
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,900
Don't be scared! Stick with me,
I'll teach you!

54
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,620
That's it. Deal?

55
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,060
How many for you?

56
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,020
Four.

57
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,820
Let's go, I want...

58
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,660
- Let me finish cooking.
- Let it cook itself.

59
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,420
Mustafa is watching.

60
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,260
Come on, what is he,
a baby or something?

61
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,180
I'll turn off the gas.

62
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,180
- You're not scared?
- No.

63
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,260
We'll be there in a second!

64
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,340
A fool is one thing,
an idiot's even more so.

65
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,420
It's a trick, a trick, don't cheat!
You're cheating.

66
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,260
A jack, what a pity.

67
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,140
- What do you need?
- I've been standing half the day.

68
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,820
- How you doing, Sakura?
- Fine.

69
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,340
That's good.

70
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,220
Listen, Almaz.

71
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,380
Everybody knows my face there already.
I found myself a helper.

72
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,780
- Who is it?
- It's my girlfriend's son.

73
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,020
Make sure he keeps his mouth shut.

74
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,940
You couldn't find a bigger one?
He'll knock ours out...

75
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,780
I think it's worth the risk.

76
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
It's interesting for the crowd.

77
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,220
All right then, here are the rules.

78
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,540
You've got to make it to the end.
Understood?

79
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,100
Advance.

80
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,820
What about the rest?

81
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,740
You have to win the rest. We'll
start in a half-hour. You're first.

82
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,820
Who's this guy to you?

83
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,540
A friend.

84
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,860
You've known him long?

85
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,780
Can we trust him?

86
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,060
That's it. Get out of here.

87
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,820
Hey, what's with you?
You call this money?

88
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,660
I'll kill you for this money.

89
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,340
Get lost. You're gonna threaten me?

90
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,700
Go. Get out of here, you idiot!

91
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,900
I bet on the boxer.

92
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,380
I on the T-shirt.

93
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,860
They need a doctor there.

94
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,500
He needs help.

95
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,260
- Take him away from here.
- What's the matter?

96
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,540
Ali's bad there.

97
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,780
What Ali?

98
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,220
The one from the exchange.

99
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,260
Bring some water!

100
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,700
Forget about him,
go bring some water.

101
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,820
They finished me, bastards...

102
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,780
Take the money from my pocket.

103
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,420
Do you know the house
at the edge of town?

104
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,460
Her name is Zina...
You'll do it?

105
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,060
Hey, Schizo. You here?

106
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,740
Don't you get it?

107
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,380
I told you, forget about him
or I'll rip your head off! Got it?

108
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,100
Okay, guys!

109
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,940
I'm taking new "Benz", I'll stake
old one on the fight. Let's drink!

110
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,940
Oh, cool. Come on guys, come on.

111
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:52,420
To Almaz' new "Benz". To you, Almaz!

112
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,860
Dance with him.

113
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,500
Does Zina live here?

114
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,820
And who are you?

115
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,380
A friend.

116
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,620
Zina's on her way.

117
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,260
Do you have some water?

118
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,580
Wanna play?

119
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:10,980
Who's this?

120
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,420
Your friend.

121
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,460
I don't have this kind of friend.

122
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,660
What do you need here?

123
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,820
Ali asked me to bring money.

124
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,660
And that's all of it?

125
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,780
Yeah.

126
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,100
And where is he?

127
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,940
He left.

128
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,220
Left? Where did he go?

129
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,500
I don't know.

130
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,380
When will he be back?

131
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,940
Does he think it's possible
to live on this money?

132
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,660
I haven't paid the landlord
in three months!

133
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,060
I'll move to find work and let him
take care of his boy, understand?

134
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,340
Tell him that!

135
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,060
Left! He thinks I believe his lies?

136
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,460
Scum!

137
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,380
Hey, guys! Guys! Grab him!
I recognize him. It's him!

138
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,740
What's the matter?

139
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,460
He's recruiting people for work.

140
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,060
And he organizes fist fights.

141
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,860
So what, shit?
Who are you working for?

142
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,780
Cat got your tongue or what?

143
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,780
He's sick in the head.

144
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,620
You're the one who's sick.

145
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,940
What did you say, bitch?

146
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,300
Enough, put him in the tank.
Quick, quick, take him there.

147
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,460
- Go to hell!
- Come here, you bastard!

148
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,380
From the crowded city
with the skin-topped milk

149
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,100
It's always interesting for me
to go far away

150
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,620
To where there is a river
with a nice bank

151
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,220
And a heel, like a stove
will warm the sand for me.

152
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:12,380
The sky, the air,
and the naughty wind

153
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,140
And even the air will sing with me.

154
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,180
You, moron. Get the hell over here!

155
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,940
Quicker. Quicker.

156
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,500
Let's go, double-time!
To the cell...

157
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,180
Let's go.

158
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,020
So what, what did they want?

159
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,500
They asked me whom I'm working for.

160
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,780
You didn't squeal?

161
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,740
Good job!

162
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,860
What do you want?

163
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,060
Do you have money?

164
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,140
How much?

165
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:55,220
What do you need it for? For girls
or something? Okay, sit down.

166
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,220
- What's with you?
- Money.

167
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,460
Did you bring my car?

168
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,500
Sanzhik!

169
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,700
I've got to go...

170
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,140
You are rubies,

171
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,060
rubies, precious little gems...

172
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,700
What do you want?

173
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,700
Will you go to the restaurant?

174
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,060
Do you have money?

175
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,580
Got it.

176
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,500
We can stay at home...

177
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,700
It'll be cheaper.

178
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,420
Let me make a run.

179
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,460
You hang the laundry, okay?

180
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,940
What do you drink?

181
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:42,980
Vodka.

182
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,100
Do you know how much...

183
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,580
they would have ripped
you off for in a restaurant?

184
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,420
You go to restaurants a lot?

185
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,740
Yeah.

186
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,020
I used to go
to restaurants a lot, too.

187
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,820
Now I don't even
have a decent dress.

188
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,620
The sun rises
and sets behind the river.

189
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,740
Someone is quietly singing...
ah, ah, ah, ah.

190
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,420
Sing along.

191
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,260
And in the algae, the green algae

192
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,980
The girl's body floats.

193
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,900
And in the algae, the green algae

194
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,060
The girl's body floats.

195
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,180
Can you imagine Ali, that jerk,

196
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,860
dumps his kid on me and takes off.

197
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,940
And no help whatsoever...

198
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,700
I'll go to China to look for work.

199
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,620
People say waitresses
make good money there.

200
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,940
I'll marry a Chinese guy.
People say they make good husbands.

201
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,700
Have you heard it?

202
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,140
Listen, I forgot, what's your name?

203
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,020
Mustafa. Nickname's Schizo.

204
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,140
Short for schizophrenic.

205
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,060
Wait, I don't understand.
Are you sick or something?

206
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,940
Take your hands off me!

207
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,860
When you see Ali, just tell him

208
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,060
that his Zina moved to China and
sent his boy to an orphanage.

209
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,380
He was killed.

210
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,260
What are you talking about,
you idiot?!

211
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,860
Why didn't you tell me before?

212
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,300
Who are you? What are you doing
here? I'm going to kill you!

213
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,740
I'm Kulyash's son. Let me go!
And you are my uncle.

214
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,540
You bloody...

215
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,660
What are you doing here?

216
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,140
Listen, I'm late for work.
You coming with me?

217
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,300
- Your mother got married?
- No.

218
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,980
What, she lives alone?

219
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,540
No, with Sakura.

220
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,300
- He doesn't treat you badly?
- No.

221
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,940
Come on, faster!

222
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,900
Hey, did you cut it? Throw it!

223
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,460
I cut it.

224
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,460
Me, too.

225
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,060
I'm throwing it.

226
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,180
I'm throwing too.

227
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,460
Throw it!

228
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,700
What if they turn on the power?

229
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,020
There's no power here.

230
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,900
And what if they do?

231
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,500
It'll fucking kill 'em!

232
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,420
Come on, load it up fast.

233
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,620
Faster, faster!

234
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,660
Give me money.

235
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:31,580
Money. Load faster!
We have no time at all!

236
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:35,300
Here it is. Faster!

237
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,980
When is the train back?

238
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,860
How do I know? Daut, you know?

239
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,220
What, like I take trains
or something?

240
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,100
Okay, I am leaving.

241
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,580
Stop!

242
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,820
What did you come for?

243
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,740
I wanted to offer some work.

244
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,700
What work?

245
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,020
Fight for money.

246
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,300
You can't do it, you got old.

247
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,460
How much they paying?

248
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,780
A lot. The prize is a car!

249
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:46,980
No way.

250
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,020
Why would I lie to my uncle?

251
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,180
10 years ago,

252
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,500
10 cops couldn't put down
your Uncle Zhaken.

253
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:00,940
Even their electric clubs
didn't work. He busted their faces.

254
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,060
What kind of car?

255
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,180
A big one. An American Mercedes.

256
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,780
Stop, you little snot!

257
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,620
Why do you want to disgrace
your uncle?

258
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,220
Hold on! I'll show you!

259
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,620
Let's go. I'll show you how
Uncle Zhaken can't fight!

260
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,700
Why did you bring someone so old?

261
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,580
He won't even last 5 minutes.

262
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,900
He will. Even electric clubs
didn't work on him.

263
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,460
Okay, we'll see...

264
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,460
Are you gonna make
it at least 5 minutes?

265
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,580
I don't know. I probably will.

266
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,220
All right, pour.

267
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,860
Well, go on brother.

268
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,300
Don't pound him right away!
Stretch it out a little, okay?

269
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:19,820
Go on!

270
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:24,100
Beautiful. Good car.

271
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,180
Hey, give me the keys to the car!

272
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,100
Hey, Almaz, give him the car.
He won fair and square.

273
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,780
Give him the keys.

274
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,780
You selling?

275
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,540
You selling?

276
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,140
I'm selling.

277
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,140
How much you asking?

278
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,020
Twenty-five hundred.

279
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,660
Dollars.

280
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,460
Twenty-five hundred.
That's expensive, Dad.

281
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,860
I'll take it for two thousand.

282
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,580
I told you twenty-five hundred.

283
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,340
You just take a look at the wheels.
They're already old.

284
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,340
Weighted down, they'll go flat.

285
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,980
If you don't want it, don't take it.

286
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,780
I'm buying.

287
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,580
But you've got to bring it down.
Open the trunk.

288
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,140
Everything's fine.

289
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,700
Here brother. I'm giving you money.

290
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,380
Okay, take it.

291
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,780
You just owe me a bottle.

292
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,500
A bottle. All right, a bottle.

293
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,260
Dad, six seconds.

294
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,580
Well, all right. Pour.

295
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:14,460
Don't drink a lot. You'll fall
asleep and they'll steal the money.

296
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,980
Why are you constantly lecturing
your own uncle?

297
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,980
Did you see how I got him?

298
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,300
Come on, he messed up your face.

299
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,620
- Why are you so late?
- I had things to do.

300
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,340
- What is it?
- It's for you.

301
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,060
Oh my god!

302
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,980
- What do you think?
- Fine.

303
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,260
- Does it fit?
- Uh-huh.

304
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,620
Wow, you even chose my size!

305
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,620
- Will you have some watermelon?
- Uh-huh.

306
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,460
- Hi.
- Hi.

307
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,740
Look what I've got.

308
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,020
What have you got on?

309
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,660
Schizo gave it to me.

310
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,580
They're for swimming underwater.

311
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,980
Where did you get so much?

312
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,340
I earned it.

313
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,540
It's all for me?

314
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,140
For you.

315
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,180
Will you stay?

316
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,940
Are you sleeping?

317
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:10,900
No.

318
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,180
Well, what do you want?

319
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:18,860
Nothing.

320
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,020
Don't lie.

321
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,380
Do you know how to screw?

322
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,860
I do, and you?

323
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,020
I tried once.

324
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,660
And so?

325
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,340
Didn't work out.

326
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:00,900
Everything okay?

327
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,540
Don't go to China.
Look after the boy.

328
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,660
Okay, I'll stay.

329
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:22,860
Stop wandering out at night.
You have to look after your health.

330
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:30,060
- What are you talking about?
- This guy's related to you.

331
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,500
This is a total scam.

332
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:39,100
I don't have any relatives. Schizo
found him. I know nothing about it.

333
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:49,140
Listen, Sakura, this Schizo
is an idiot! But you're not!

334
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,780
I lost a fighter and a car!
Who's gonna give me my money back?

335
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,660
Almaz, I have nothing to do with it.
I swear!

336
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:03,900
If you don't bring me money
in 3 days, I'll put you in the ring

337
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,460
and kill you myself!

338
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,340
Do some sit-ups. How do you feel?

339
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:20,780
Fine.

340
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,860
- Have you been taking your tablets?
- Yes.

341
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:23,700
Come here.

342
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,540
Does he have a sex life?

343
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,100
No.

344
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:36,740
There is some progress, but you have
to take a treatment in Almaty.

345
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,940
I've already arranged it.

346
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:42,700
Here is the paperwork.
Go there tomorrow, straight away.

347
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,860
Thank you, Victor lvanovich.

348
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:14,940
So, you played the fool?
And you framed me?

349
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:16,860
He won fair.

350
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,900
Where's the money?
Where's the money?

351
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,180
I spent it.

352
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:21,620
On what?

353
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,300
None of your business.

354
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:27,460
They called me on it! I can
get killed over this, understand?

355
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,300
Where's my money gone?
Sakura, did you take it?

356
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,340
Yeah, I took it.

357
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,980
What for? We have to go to the city
tomorrow for treatment.

358
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,860
Treat him for what?
He turned out to be the smartest.

359
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,700
Now you can save for the funeral.

360
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,100
What funeral?

361
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:02,940
The hell with you, you jerk!
Choke on the money!

362
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,140
It's my fault.

363
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:16,420
We need to pay them off
or they will tear us apart.

364
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,420
I know how to get money.

365
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:30,700
There's one job. We can take a lot
of money. There'll be enough for us.

366
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:38,820
But I need your help.

367
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:01,940
We are friends,

368
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:07,060
- aren't we?
- Fifty-fifty.

369
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:30,660
You'll go to the counter, show them
the gun, and say "Money". Got it?

370
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,620
Repeat what you have to do.

371
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:35,100
And why don't you go yourself?

372
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,460
I'll wait for you here. You're sick.
You won't get anything for it.

373
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:47,380
- But they'd put me behind the bars.
- How much should I take?

374
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:51,780
Take everything. Don't be a pussy!

375
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:53,780
Go, go, go on!

376
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,420
# Currency Exchange #

377
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,500
Give me the money!

378
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:02,540
Everything!

379
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,340
He's got no money left.

380
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,340
- How much is here?
- I don't know.

381
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,540
- Should I count it?
- There's no time.

382
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,740
Quiet. Understand?

383
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,180
You'll hitch a ride home.

384
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,380
Where's the gun?

385
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:34,460
I forgot it on the counter.
Should we go back?

386
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,660
Give me the money.
I need to take it right now.

387
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:47,260
Hey, leave them. I love apples.

388
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,740
Where's my share?

389
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:55,740
What share?

390
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,540
But we've got a fifty-fifty...

391
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:02,580
Forget about fifty-fifty.
And forget about me.

392
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,420
Go home. You need to get treatment.

393
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,940
It was fair. Fifty-fifty.

394
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:08,980
Say hi to your mother.

395
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:05,860
What?

396
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,300
You know how good
it is on the water.

397
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:16,020
- How are you doing?
- Good.

398
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:22,300
Is Zina home?

399
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:27,700
And how are you doing?

400
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:31,220
Not bad.

401
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:47,460
Bring me a notebook and a pen.

402
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,860
Did you take your pills?

403
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,180
No, I ran out of them.

404
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:13,260
Zina, give half to my mother.
Your friend, S.

405
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,780
Will you stay with me?

406
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,300
No, I have things to do.

407
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:29,220
You'll give Zina money
at the first snowfall.

408
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,460
And when will the snow fall?

409
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,820
I don't know.
You'll see for yourself.

410
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:39,620
Sometimes the snow doesn't fall
for a long time.

411
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,180
And tell her not to move away
for now.

412
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,300
Yes.

413
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:11,700
Well, bye.

414
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:17,460
Bye.

415
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,660
I didn't say anything in court.

416
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:49,300
They pronounced me normal
and gave me 6 years.

417
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:56,060
Mother sold the house
and moved to the city.

418
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,900
She visited me in prison
now and then.

419
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,300
There was nothing from Zina.

420
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:08,180
I didn't know what happened to them.

421
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:25,460
Then I got lucky. They let me out
on amnesty before my time was up.
