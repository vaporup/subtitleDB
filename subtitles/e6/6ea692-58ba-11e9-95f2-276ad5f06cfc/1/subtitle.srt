1
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:40,792
<i>By the year 2000, we had begun to</i>
<i>overpopulate, pollute and poison our planet...</i>

2
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,176
<i>...faster than we could clean it up.</i>

3
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:48,053
<i>We ignored the problem for as long as</i>
<i>we could but we were kidding ourselves.</i>

4
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,142
<i>By 2025, we knew we were</i>
<i>in trouble...</i>

5
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,807
<i>...and began to desperately search</i>
<i>- Mars.</i>

6
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:59,978
<i>For the last 20 years, we've sent</i>
<i>unmanned probes with algae...</i>

7
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,314
<i>...bio-engineered to grow there and</i>
<i>produce oxygen.</i>

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,484
<i>We'll build ourselves an atmosphere</i>
<i>we can breathe.</i>

9
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:11,618
<i>And for 20 years it seemed to work.</i>
<i>It looked like we'd pulled it off, we'd done it.</i>

10
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,622
<i>Then all of a sudden,</i>
<i>oxygen levels started to drop.</i>

11
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,624
<i>We don't know why.</i>

12
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,849
<i>The international community has thrown</i>
<i>all its resources behind us.</i>

13
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,690
<i>It's the greatest undertaking man</i>
<i>has ever attempted.</i>

14
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:46,028
<i>Our ship,</i> Mars-1, <i>is too massive to</i>
<i>launch from the surface of the planet.</i>

15
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,033
<i>We've shuttled to the high-orbit</i>
<i>space station...</i>

16
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,867
<i>...for a low-gravity launch to begin</i>
<i>our six-month trip:</i>

17
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,702
<i>The first manned mission to Mars.</i>

18
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,997
<i>The hope and survival</i>
<i>of mankind rests on us.</i>

19
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,138
<i>But I know we'll solve the problem.</i>

20
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,385
<i>Because the best scientific minds are</i>
<i>going there to figure out the answer.</i>

21
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,474
<i>And I'm leading the mission.</i>

22
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,390
<i>I'm Bowman, pilot</i>
<i>and mission commander.</i>

23
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:24,069
<i>Chantilas, chief science officer</i>
<i>and the soul of the crew.</i>

24
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,150
<i>Santen, a hothead,</i>
<i>but a fine copilot.</i>

25
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,284
<i>Gallagher, our mechanical systems</i>
<i>engineer. Maintenance.</i>

26
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,411
<i>Frankly, not my first choice.</i>

27
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,127
<i>The two civilian members</i>
<i>of the team are:</i>

28
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:49,887
<i>Burchenal, one of the world's leading</i>
<i>bio-engineers, his own greatest hero.</i>

29
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,221
<i>Pettengil...</i>

30
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:56,557
<i>...terraforming expert and last-minute</i>
<i>replacement on the science team.</i>

31
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,597
<i>And packed away in her box, AMEE:</i>

32
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,562
<i>Autonomous Mapping Exploration</i>
<i>and Evasion.</i>

33
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,189
<i>A multi-task robot on loan</i>
<i>from the Marines.</i>

34
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,814
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>our Mars surface navigator.</i>

35
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,362
<i>We're the first travelers</i>
<i>to another planet.</i>

36
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,827
<i>It's another giant leap</i>
<i>for mankind...</i>

37
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:18,328
<i>...and if we don't figure out what's</i>
<i>wrong on Mars, it could be our last.</i>

38
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,263
Alpha Mach Indicator.

39
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,269
- Clear.
- <i>Confirmed.</i>

40
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,731
<i>That concludes the primary systems</i>
<i>checklist, commander.</i>

41
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,437
- Thanks, Lucille.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

42
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,067
Gentlemen...

43
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,819
...take over.

44
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,993
- Can't believe we're doing this.
- Just follow the routine.

45
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,990
Secondary systems. OHS/RCS.

46
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,120
- Clear.
- <i>RCS, confirmed.</i>

47
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,294
- Optical alignment sight.
- <i>Op sight, rate 19.</i>

48
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,921
- Clear.
- <i>Confirmed.</i>

49
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,673
How many hits you get on your website
yesterday, Pettengil?

50
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,759
- I got 500,000.
- That's great.

51
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,337
How many did you get?

52
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,756
<i>ATU, 13.6 degrees.</i>

53
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,308
- Eight hundred and thirty-two.
- Ha, ha, ha.

54
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,686
- Were they all from your mother?
- Yeah.

55
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,317
You know, it's strange. It's gone.

56
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,286
Yesterday I could see it.
Today I looked and I couldn't find it.

57
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,616
So what? You think the Earth just
vanished? It's gone forever?

58
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,793
- It's weird not being able to see it.
- Yeah, so it's weird.

59
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,333
You'll get over it, or you won't.

60
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,463
Just something I wasn't expecting,
that's all.

61
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,846
Gallagher, up for a couple of turns
around the campus?

62
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,150
My grandfather taught me
to sail when I was a kid.

63
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,478
Taught me to read the stars.

64
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,317
"Just in case all the GPS satellites
fell out of the sky," he said.

65
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,653
He said, "Any man who puts his life...

66
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,865
...in the hands of a bunch
of batteries is an idiot."

67
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,455
A real Yankee.

68
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,333
No, he just wouldn't approve something
he couldn't build with his hands.

69
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,878
- He wouldn't have approved of this.
- Going to Mars?

70
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,089
He'd say we were headed for trouble.

71
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,383
Say we didn't try.

72
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,474
We just finished poisoning the Earth...

73
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,223
...and everyone was dead in 100 years.

74
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,179
Then what was the point of any of it?

75
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,981
Art, beauty, all gone.

76
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,772
The Greeks. The Constitution.

77
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,772
We've been dying for freedom, ideas.

78
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
None of it meant anything?

79
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:02,078
And what about religion?
Do we give up on God too?

80
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:06,246
You didn't just give up being
a scientist one day, did you?

81
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,877
I realized science...

82
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,924
...couldn't answer any of the really
interesting questions.

83
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,252
So I turned to philosophy.

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,634
Been searching for God ever since.

85
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:37,899
Hey. You're talking to a classroom of
second graders from Iowa. At 14:30.

86
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,904
Wait a minute.
It's your turn to do the kiddies.

87
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,658
Oh, no. It is your turn,
and you know it. Besides...

88
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,165
...I outrank you.
I could order you to do it.

89
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,827
Just because they promote faster
in the Navy.

90
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,047
Of course they do. You have to when
you deal with the best people.

91
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,461
14:30, with a smile on your face.

92
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,841
This mean you're pulling rank
for the shower too?

93
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,676
No, not rank.

94
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,808
Gender. Ladies first.

95
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,322
Could you pass me the towel, please?

96
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,577
Sure. Sorry.

97
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,869
Just pretend I'm your sister.

98
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,880
I have two sisters.
They don't look like you.

99
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,380
This only works if we both believe
it doesn't matter.

100
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,392
- So I should pretend you're Burchenal.
- It could matter more than that.

101
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,312
Why don't we practice? You can get
back in the shower naked...

102
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:55,234
...and come out, and I'll pretend it
doesn't matter.

103
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,487
Why don't you go fix something?

104
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,615
Yes, sir. Ma'am.

105
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,043
- <i>MEV systems check confirmed.</i>
- I'll be on the deck with Bowman.

106
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,424
- Yep, sure.
- Five hundred thousand.

107
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,836
- Eight thirty-two. Tighten up. Hee-ta!
- Ha, ha, ha.

108
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,671
- Get ready, boys.
- Yeah.

109
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,724
I hate him. It's like high school.

110
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,977
There's the jocks and then us.
You watch my back, I'll watch yours.

111
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,934
Do you want to help me with AMEE?

112
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,315
It's time for her prelaunch
diagnostics check.

113
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,775
Hang on. Who are you kidding?
You're a jock.

114
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,027
You did the NASCAR circuit, right?

115
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,910
I was just tuning cars.
Wasn't really jock stuff.

116
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,446
- It's heavy.
- Ears are still ringing.

117
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,120
What powers this thing?

118
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,705
A helium nuclear power cell.

119
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,879
Size of a beer can,
runs her for eight months.

120
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,429
Hey, sweetie.

121
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,266
Sweetie? Is she our navigator
or your girlfriend?

122
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,893
- Been a long flight.
- Certainly has.

123
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,145
It's looking good.
Let's check your TI.

124
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,617
Tighten up!

125
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,827
So the military removed her reflexes?

126
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,961
That should make her your kind of girl.

127
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,010
Gut him like a fish.

128
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,770
Kill him.

129
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,690
That's my kind of girl.

130
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,234
That's real damn funny.

131
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,696
- <i>Activity strictly prohibited. Cease.</i>
- She could've hurt me.

132
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,537
They took away her knife,
but inside she's all Green Beret.

133
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,377
Back in navigator mode.
You'll dig Mars.

134
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,132
<i>So have a good time...</i>

135
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,552
<i>...and I hope to see you back
on Earth soon. Good luck.</i>

136
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,137
<i>We miss you.</i>

137
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,880
<i>Bye.</i>

138
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,259
<i>209 web messages remaining.</i>

139
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,592
<i>Hey, Teddy. Remember me?</i>

140
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,103
<i>Sure hope you haven't forgotten</i>
<i>your old friends...</i>

141
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,230
<i>...now that you're a big hotshot</i>
<i>astronaut.</i>

142
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,892
<i>Just wanted to let you know</i>
<i>I'm thinking about you.</i>

143
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,158
<i>I sense an irregular humidity mixture.</i>

144
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,413
- Hi.
- Hi.

145
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,085
How you doing?

146
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,248
Fine.
Soon as someone explains to me...

147
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,794
...why a flight deck indicator says
the temperature is above normal.

148
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,754
About 10 degrees.

149
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,431
Fahrenheit or centigrade?

150
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,223
He's teaching me about biology.

151
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,310
- I've developed an interest in...
- Fermentation?

152
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,111
A billion dollars in this mission, and
you use the lab equipment as a still?

153
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,942
No. I'm...

154
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,282
- I'm sterilizing.
- Uh-huh.

155
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:40,204
And how do you propose
that I explain to Houston...

156
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:49,301
...that two of my crew went blind
drinking moonshine vodka?

157
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,633
Very carefully?

158
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,641
So, what? Doesn't this establishment
serve women?

159
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,149
Allow me.

160
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,486
Commander Bowman.

161
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,488
Whoo!

162
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,996
I learned how to drink
in the Navy, boys.

163
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,000
Chantilas, there were frogs
around when you were a kid, right?

164
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,251
Lots.

165
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,675
And then we killed them.
Every last one.

166
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,975
Now, since frogs breathe
through their skins...

167
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:43,180
...they react to the toxins
in the environment more rapidly.

168
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,517
That should've been a warning.
Don't you think?

169
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,560
What's your point?

170
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:54,695
Man's a party animal. If he's doing
okay, then nothing else matters.

171
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,825
That's not gonna change.

172
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,702
Unless there are larger forces
at work than biology.

173
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:07,712
Uh-oh. We're gonna talk about God now,
aren't we? If we are, I'll need another pop.

174
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,048
Not God, faith.

175
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:15,383
Faith? I had a girlfriend named Faith.
Cheated on me with a girl named Chastity.

176
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:23,057
You wouldn't be riding
309 million kilometers...

177
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,313
...into outer space and back...

178
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,442
...in a rocket ship that nobody
ever tested properly...

179
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,728
...without having a little faith.

180
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,695
Listen. Let's forget all the hypotheticals
for a second, okay?

181
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,745
I say...

182
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,034
...to hell with humanity.
I say, Commander Bowman...

183
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,754
...when we get to Mars,
we just take it.

184
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,583
We just take it over for ourselves.

185
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,257
Call Earth, tell them it sucks
and don't bother coming?

186
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,385
Yeah. Whatever keeps out the riffraff.

187
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,091
You can do the religion thing.

188
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,062
Gallagher, you can keep
the space john working, and...

189
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,514
...Pettengil's passed out...

190
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,439
...and I can handle pretty much
everything else, you know.

191
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,981
King.

192
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,071
What about me?

193
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,489
Well, you'll be my queen.

195
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,300
It's just a...

196
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,055
It's just a joke.
Commander Bowman, it was a...

197
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:51,645
And on that note, gentlemen,
I suggest we retire.

198
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,398
Mars-1, <i>Houston.</i>
<i>You have acquired orbit.</i>

199
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,826

00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,825
<i>And welcome to Mars. Houston out.</i>

201
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,450
Find a good parking space?

202
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,862
Yep. Right between Phobos and Deimos.

203
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,576
I prefer one moon, you know?

204
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,703
That way, you know what to call it.
"The moon."

205
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,215
More color commentary
from the janitor.

206
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,628
The correct term is
"mechanical systems engineer."

207
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,223
- But he will accept "space janitor."
- To hell with the chitchat.

208
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,511
After six months, I'm ready to get out
of this hamster cage. Bowman?

209
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,314
Lucille, initiate all pre-launch
systems checks.

210
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,770
- <i>Yes, commander</i>
- Finally.

211
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,397
We're eating dinner on Mars.

212
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,403
Sounds good to me.

00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,909
It'll be nice to live on the ground.

00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,625
Even if we are exchanging one
hamster cage for another.

00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,924
If all's gone well, hydroponics
have been online for six months.

218
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,218
We'll have fresh tomatoes tonight.

219
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,344
That's one requirement
for my dream house.

220
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,257
Bet you want
a white picket fence, right?

221
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,800
I wouldn't mind.

222
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,095
- Lucille, can we see our new home?
<i>- Yes, commander.</i>

- Gamma burst.
- Latch up. Free flow.

00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,698
We'll lose chips. Shut it down!

228
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,875

230

Whoa. Radiation alert. Safe area.
Go, guys! Go!

231
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,397
- You too, lieutenant.
- I'm not going anywhere.

232
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,150
- You need me here.
- I want you back there now!

233
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,986
Lieutenant, now. Go.

- Yeah, Bowman, we copy. We're all okay.

- We're dead in the water.
- <i>Main power unit offline.</i>

00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,106
<i>I'll secure the ship.</i>

246
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,822

Okay, guys. Listen up.

The MEV's not supplying power
to the launch release system.

271
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,421
I'm gonna have to stay back
and arm it manually.

Where the hell is HAB?

339
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,467
If you hadn't dumped
our navigator, we'd know.

340
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,382
Can't get a visual on AMEE,
but maybe I can fix this radio.

341
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:01,846
How long?

342
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,182
I don't know.
These repairs'll take a while.

343
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,434
Science package is KO'd also.

344
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,984
- Shit. There goes the mission.
- Mission's not over yet, Pettengil.

345
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,355
Really? Did you miss something?
We lost the science package.

346
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,941
- We can't do what we came here for.
- Quit whining.

347
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,235
You did park us on the rocks.

348
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,237
And you knew there were risks.

349
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,866
Right now, gentlemen, locating HAB
is what matters.

350
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,581

351

<i>- Calculating landing ellipse.</i>

352
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,875
Based on our last uncorrupted nav
state...

353
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,216
...I'd say we're somewhere
in this 60 by 120 kilometer ellipse.

354
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,517
The mission data's here. We need to
close in on the downrange variables.

355
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,969
It's about the math.

356
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,476
This is it. That moment they told us
about in high school...

357
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,103
...where one day, algebra would
save our lives.

358
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,314
Shut up.

359
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:54,854
Sorry.

Hey, guys. Look at this.

00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,488
What, Gallagher?

369
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:49,079
I don't think it's about the math.
I think it's about the picture.

370
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,413
What picture?

371
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,792
This one.

372
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:56,082
We're not in that picture.
If we were, we'd know where HAB was.

373
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:01,341
I know, but if this rock is HAB and
it's in the line about 30 degrees...

374
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:04,765
...it sees these two peaks, but
reverse, as it's on the other side...

375
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,388
...and at 180 degrees,
it sees those two peaks.

376
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,015
Which puts us on a line about here...

377
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,356
...which makes the line to the HAB
about there.

378
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,776
He's right.

379
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,151
Nice work, space janitor.

380
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,487
We only have seven
and a half hours of air left.

381
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,827
Let's get moving.

382
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,398
<i>I realized science...</i>

383
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,399
...couldn't answer any of the really
interesting questions.

384
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,730
So I turned to philosophy.

385
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,033
Been searching for God ever since.

386
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,819
Who knows?

387
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,447
I may pick up a rock and it'll say
underneath, "Made by God."

388
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,541
Universe is full of surprises.

389
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,869
That would be a big one.

390
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,255
You ready, sir?

391
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,555
Unfortunately, I'm staying here.

392
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,886
What?

393
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,886
My spleen's ruptured.
There's significant internal bleeding.

394
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,562
I wouldn't get very far.

395
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:38,563
We have emergency medical gear at HAB.
We can lock out the spine impulse.

396
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,940
You can walk us through the surgery.

397
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:45,532
Carrying me will slow you all down,
enough to deplete everyone's oxygen.

398
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,531
This is no time for misguided heroics.

399
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,987
I won't let you die here.

400
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,453
What we came here to do
is more important.

401
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,165
The four of you must carry on
with the mission.

402
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,623
It won't be easy,
but I know you can do it.

403
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,175
Get going.

404
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,932
You heard the man.

405
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,653
Hey...

406
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,284
...I got to see Mars.

407
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,530
Come on, give me a red light.
Give me juice.

408
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:19,665
Come on, don't do this to me and
my team. Give me a goddamn red light.

410
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,464

415
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,732
It's weird. There's nothing here.

416
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,651
It's Mars.

417
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,363
No, I mean there's not one sign
of the algae we sent up here.

418
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,572
Even if it all died, there should be
something. Dried algal mat, traces...

419
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,911
He's right. They're not
just dead, they're gone.

420
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:03,250
Like they were scoured off. This says
there was nothing ever here. Impossible.

421
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,415
Maybe there was never anything
in this valley.

422
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,634
If we are where we think we are...

423
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,883
...this area was covered
with blue algae just a month ago.

424
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:17,009
The valley before this should've been
blazing with red-orange chloroflectic.

425
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,348
All this talking's burning up oxygen.
Move out.

426
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,310
We know what happened to the oxygen.
Nothing here to make it.

428
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,268

00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,621
- Ice storm couldn't have done this.
- No way.

451
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,216
Every HAB stood up to an F-5

Okay. What are we gonna do?

454
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,927

Houston, this is <i>Mars-1.</i>

00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:38,771
Even if the rest of the team is alive,
they have no way to survive.

00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,398
I hope Bowman made it.

477
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:12,155
You know, I had a thing for her...

478
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,200
...from the start.

479
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:19,379
I thought they chose me
because I was single...

480
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,881
...in case I died.

481
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,218
Short time to live.

482
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:34,014
Long time to wait.

483
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,816
God, it really is beautiful, isn't it?

484
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,119
I was planning on getting engaged
when I got back.

485
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,673
Yeah, well, I'm gonna miss
a lot of girls.

486
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,585
A lot of girls are gonna miss me.

487
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,008
I was never supposed to be here.

488
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,348
I was just the next lucky guy
on the list.

489
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:21,316
Well, my flying ability
isn't an issue now.

490
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,023
With HAB destroyed, it makes no
difference where we landed.

491
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,608
You're calculating excuses.

492
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:31,151
Nothing to excuse.
It's moot. No impact.

493
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,870
- But Chantilas?
- Moot.

494
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,120
He'd have died here anyway.

495
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,623
Just like us.

496
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,673
You're amazing, Mr. Santen.

497
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:49,427
Your life is about to end,
and you still can't accept defeat.

498
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:54,803
I can come across as a hard-ass.
I know that. But technically...

499
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,309
...I didn't fail.

500
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,274
Look, what's done is done.

501
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:09,572
- I came up here to forgive you.
- Yeah? Well, screw you.

502
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,026
I don't need forgiveness
from a pussy like you.

503
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,865
Get out of here.

504
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:24,413
Go away and die like a man if you can.

505
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,968
Santen. Oh, my God. Santen!

506
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,725
Oh, Jesus.

507
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:49,237
<i>Mars' polar ice is mostly CO-2.</i>

508
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:54,735
<i>We use low-order nuclear detonations</i>
<i>to melt the ice.</i>

509
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,320
<i>That releases CO-2.</i>

510
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:02,663
CO-2 buildup creates a greenhouse
effect.

511
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,628
Mars starts to warm up.

512
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,005
Now, when it's hot enough...

513
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,626
...we seed down some algae.

514
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:16,430
The algae grows and emits oxygen.

515
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,400
You want me to just shut up
and let you die quietly?

516
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:31,233
No. Kind of peaceful.

517
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:36,531
Okay. So they sent us here...

518
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:41,786
...to figure out what happened
to the oxygen.

519
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,787
Question is...

520
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,625
...what happened to the algae?

521
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,713
You know?

522
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,050
Santen's dead.

523
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,727
He threw himself off a cliff.

524
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,773
I tried to stop him.

525
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,370
<i>Gallagher,</i>
<i>replace your O-2 canister immediately.</i>

526
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,197
I'm under a minute.

527
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,539
What's it gonna be like?

528
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,750
Hypoxia?

529
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,585
Dizziness. Skin will tingle.

530
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,004
Vision narrows.

531
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,343
Then shock, convulsions...

532
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,675
...acidosis...

533
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,428
Is it gonna hurt?

534
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,015
Yeah.

535
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,650
I'm going to... I'm going to...

536
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,898
...go over here. Take a walk.

537
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,370
<i>Gallagher, oxygen supply depleted.</i>

538
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,713
- Gallagher.
- I was... Ugh! Ugh!

539
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:44,663
<i>Burchenal,</i>
<i>replace your O-2 canister immediately.</i>

540
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:11,306
<i>Pettengil, replace your</i>
<i>O-2 canister immediately.</i>

541
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,583
I can breathe.

542
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,288
I can breathe.

543
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,632
It's like being in high altitude.

544
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,928
I don't know how we can breathe,
but we can breathe.

545
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,012
We can breathe!

546
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,976
I don't know what the hell this is.

547
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,231
But I'll take it.

548
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,746
I can breathe.

549
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,123
This can't be possible.

550
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,290
What the hell is going on here?

551
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,552
If Santen waited a few more
minutes...

552
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,005
We can breathe, Santen.

553
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,799
We can breathe.

554
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,481
<i>Attention, commander, incoming relay.</i>

555
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:39,561
Mars-1, <i>this is Houston. We</i>
<i>got your message. Glad to hear your voice.</i>

556
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,900
<i>Analysis of your telemetry...</i>

557
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:45,028
<i>...indicates</i> Mars-1 <i>orbital failure</i>
<i>in 31 hours.</i>

558
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,740
<i>The good news is, we'll have you</i>
<i>out of there by then.</i>

559
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:51,076
<i>We believe we can restore engine</i>
<i>function for a main engine burn...</i>

560
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,536
<i>...and exit from Mars' orbit.</i>

561
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,670
<i>Ground crew is presumed</i>
<i>end of mission. Houston out.</i>

562
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:06,342
Terraforming didn't even come close
to creating breathable air up here.

563
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,718
- Right?
- Right.

564
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,930
The oxygen levels were already
dropping when all the sensors died.

565
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,141
So how can there be more O-2
now than ever before...

566
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:19,270
...and no algae to make it? Huh?

567
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:27,859
<i>Sorry, commander.</i>
<i>No response from ignition systems.</i>

568
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,374
Houston, <i>Mars-1.</i>

569
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,040
No joy on all scenarios
for engine ignition.

570
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:43,295
That includes hitting the console.
What next? Over.

571
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:47,379
God, I wish I didn't have to wait
40 minutes to hear your answer.

572
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,931
Hey, guys. Here's the radio.

573
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,727
We're not going to be calling Bowman
on this.

574
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,014
Wait a second.

575
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,277
I saw something when we were trying
to locate HAB.

576
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,904
That little rover they sent up here
back in '97.

577
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:07,948
That must have a radio, right?

578
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,741
- Yeah.
- Hang on.

579
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,452
It's 4 kilometers from here.

580
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,078
Gonna get dark real soon.

581
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,038
It'll be too cold.

582
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,952
We'll go first light.

583
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:25,000
At least this thing still has
enough rocket fuel to keep us warm.

584
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,634
Here comes a billion-dollar campfire.

585
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,923
At least it's good for something.

586
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,683
Ha.

587
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,123
If the radio at the rover works...

588
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,709
...we can contact Bowman...

589
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,914
...tell her there's breathable air here.

590
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,381
But that isn't gonna help us, is it?

591
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,348
Hey, Pettengil.

592
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,555
Must have been hard watching
Santen go like that, huh?

593
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,351
Yes, it was.

594
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:26,561
I bet.

595
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,157
It's your girlfriend. She made it.

596
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:43,119
Hey, AMEE. I thought you were dead.

597
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,788
Hi, sweetie. Good to see you.

598
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,215
You're kind of banged up.

599
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,088
Knew you'd make it.

600
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:54,472
Hey, are you a little out of whack?
Flip over for me.

601
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,855
Shoot. The processor's damaged.

602
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:10,188
- Can she still navigate for us?
- Yeah, till she breaks down for good.

603
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,490
We wait till she breaks down,
the drone'll crash.

604
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:15,026
Let's yank her Mars positioning
system now.

605
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:18,283
MPS hard drive's modular.
It's self-powered.

606
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:21,787
We can run it through an HHC. That
would give us control of the drone...

607
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,914
...but then, that'd be killing her.

608
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,750
Yeah? You want me to do it?

609
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,340
No, I'll do it.

610
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,516
AMEE!

611
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,817
AMEE.

612
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,822
Shit.

613
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:01,826
Ah!

614
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,794
AMEE, no.

615
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,428
No.

616
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:26,930
Ah!

617
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,446
AMEE.

618
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,873
Gallagher, what's going on?

619
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,576
She's in military mode.
Crash must've flipped her.

620
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:51,085
- Why did she turn on us?
- We tried to kill her.

621
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,333
- Made us the enemy.
- Son of a bitch.

622
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,293
- You okay?
- Then override her.

623
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,383
I tried. She won't respond.

624
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:04,844
It's a broken rib.

625
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:09,231
Tell me something I don't know,
like why she let us live. She had us.

626
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,938
She's playing war games.
Guerilla tactics.

627
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,611
It's an old trick.
Wound one of the enemy.

628
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,940
The others have to help out.
Slows them down.

629
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,488
Sooner or later,
she'll play search and destroy.

630
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,077
Then she'll come and kill us.

631
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,583
One by one.

632
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,661
You all right?

633
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,647
AMEE jammed the transmitters
so we won't know where she is.

634
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,118
You all right?

635
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,127
Only hurts when I breathe.

636
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:22,296
Sun's gonna come up soon.

637
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,884
Might as well get going.
Give me a hand?

638
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,375
Whoa.

639
00:56:56,747 --> 00:57:00,297
Sure get some high arc
in this low gravity, huh?

640
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,717
Watching this, AMEE?
Taking the first piss on Mars.

01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:24,626
Do you copy? Hello?

677
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,586
We're the guys on Mars.

678
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:28,959
Come on. Someone talk to us.

679
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,585
Let's try it again.

680
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:33,551
This is <i>Mars-1</i> ground crew.
Do you copy?

681
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,884
This is <i>Mars-1</i> ground crew.
Do you copy?

682
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,894
Maybe they'll hear us back in 1997.

683
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,437
It's been two hours.

684
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:51,899
Mars-1, <i>Houston.</i>

685
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,409
Mars-1, <i>Houston.</i>

686
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:58,323
<i>We've picked something off a radio</i>
<i>telescope pointed in your direction.</i>

687
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,702
<i>You won't believe this.</i>

688
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,661
<i>You'll have to tune to a frequency</i>
<i>we haven't used in 50 years.</i>

689
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,332
Yeah, well...

690
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,790
...it was worth a shot.

691
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,678
<i>Mars ground crew, this is</i> Mars-1.
<i>Do you copy?</i>

692
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,848
<i>Mars ground crew, this is</i> Mars-1.

693
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,184
Bowman! Bowman!

694
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,522
<i>Gallagher?</i>

695
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,277
You're alive.

696
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,865
Yeah.

697
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,452
Holy shit, you made it too.

698
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,948
I know that HAB is wrecked.
What is your status?

699
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:43,705
<i>We're down here at the little rover,</i>
<i>what's-its-name...</i>

700
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:46,086
...with Burchenal and Pettengil.

701
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:49,043
Got no food and water,
AMEE's gone mustang...

702
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:51,838
...and, oh, yeah, we can breathe.

703
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:57,840
How can that be? The oxygen levels are...
That is impossible.

704
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,301
I don't know.
But we're doing it.

705
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,178
<i>I saw a body back at MEV.</i>
<i>Who was it?</i>

706
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,981
That was Chantilas.
Santen's gone too.

707
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,312
<i>What happened?</i>

708
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,853
Pettengil says he threw himself
off a cliff.

709
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:13,606
<i>Anyway, that's the news.</i>

710
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:16,650
We're not gonna make it much longer.

711
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:20,320
I hope you got an idea,
because we're fresh out.

712
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:24,162
Okay, well, let me work on it.
I'll get back to you.

713
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,578
I hope she has a magic wand.

714
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:33,922
Houston, we have three men alive
and breathing on Mars.

715
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,094
Let's bring them home.

716
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,469
You just can't get around it, can you?

717
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:44,512
I still can't figure out this algae
and oxygen business.

718
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,396
You hate not knowing, don't you?

719
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,856
- Given time, believe me, I'll know.
- Yeah, maybe.

720
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:55,230
Maybe life's just more mysterious
than you think it is.

721
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,035
You know, you spent too much time
with Chantilas.

722
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,537
But if you want
to take the God route...

723
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,160
...the easy way, that's up to you.

724
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,956
Easy way? There's nothing easy
about a spiritual life.

725
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:12,039
It's a lot more difficult
than just being intelligent.

726
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,041
I think you're just ignoring the facts.

727
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,799
Facts. I bet you were no fun
at Christmas.

728
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,886
I bet your mom told you there's
no tooth fairy when you were 4.

729
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,551
I'm a geneticist. I write code.
Okay?

730
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:27,847
A, G, T, P in different combinations.

731
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,227
Hacking the human genome. Okay?

732
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,355
I choose what, I choose where...

733
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:36,897
...and either your kidneys work or
you grow a sixth finger. I do that!

734
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,774
Now, you spot God...

735
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,617
...you let me know.
Until then, I'll trust my Ph.Ds.

736
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,666
<i>It might sound crazy,</i>
<i>but it's the only choice you got.</i>

737
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:59,970
We walk 100 kilometers to a 30-year-old
Russian rock probe...

738
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,014
...that failed to launch and try
to jump-start it.

739
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,259
Gee, why couldn't you make it tough?

740
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:11,607
The probe's called <i>Cosmos.</i> Houston
found the designer, name's Borokovski.

741
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,816
<i>Owns a deli in Brooklyn.</i>

742
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:17,612
<i>He thinks you can start the launch</i>
<i>sequence right there on site.</i>

743
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:21,241
Former rocket scientist
who now specializes in...

744
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:24,703
...making sandwiches. Terrific.

745
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,450
Here's the hard part:

746
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,708
You got just under 19 hours to get
there and get it off the ground.

747
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:33,166
Then I take back what I said
about it being tough.

748
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:37,750
I gotta ditch the B tank and burn
more fuel from A to hold orbit that long.

749
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:42,133
I can't burn much after that or <i>Mars-1</i>
won't have enough fuel to get home.

750
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:44,305
I need a heading.
Which way should I go?

751
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:50,013
Okay, you want to go
to your 5:00.

752
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,025
- There you go.
- <i>Okay, we're set.</i>

753
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:58,320
I got some work to do, then I'll be
in blackout on the dark side.

754
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,063
So I'll call you when I get back.

755
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,857
Roger. Thanks.

756
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,363
<i>Sorry it's not more.</i>

757
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,069
Hey, it's something.

758
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:07,904
Give me a hand.

759
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,369
<i>It's nice just to know</i>
<i>you're still up there.</i>

760
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:13,376
Well, I don't mind dying.
I just hate being alone...

761
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,504
<i>...so get your asses back here.</i>
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

762
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:20,505
Thanks. My rib feels
like it's through my lung.

763
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,343
<i>Gallagher, what do you think?</i>

764
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:27,182
<i>I think it's very distracting</i>
<i>seeing you get out of the shower.</i>

765
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,885
I started to lock the door after that.

766
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:31,561
No, you didn't.

767
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,847
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

768
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,790
Good night.

769
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,536
What's that?

770
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,743
Over there.

771
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,750
Looks like the ground's moving.

772
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,543
I didn't see anything.

773
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:43,959
It's gone now,
but I definitely saw something.

774
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:55,432
<i>Gallagher?</i>

775
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:58,599
Hey, Bowman. How you doing?
Need a headings check.

776
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:01,609
You're right on target.
Listen, I need to talk to you.

777
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:07,281
Took the comm off. What's the matter?

778
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,566
Bowman?

779
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:14,289
The only place to ride the <i>Cosmos</i> is
in the rock sample container.

780
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:16,290
Sounds comfy.

781
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,289
<i>It's very small.</i>

782
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,086
<i>Borokovski and Houston...</i>

783
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:25,793
...have been trying to figure out how
to cram three people in...

784
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,216
...and it only fits two people.

785
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,426
Two people, barely.

786
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,516
How we doing?

787
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,094
Good. Great.

788
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,680
I'm sorry.

789
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,814
Yeah, right. I'll talk to you later.

790
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,913
Let's patch you up.
It'll help with the pain.

791
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:02,963
I can barely breathe.
This air's too damn thin!

792
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,332
You're gonna be okay.

793
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,210
Put your arm over.

794
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,762
That's right. Left foot.

795
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:12,847
Right foot. That's right.

796
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,174
Hop like a bunny. Just go.

797
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:19,729
<i>Here it comes, here it comes</i>

798
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,978
<i>Here comes your 19th</i>
<i>nervous breakdown</i>

799
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,525
What are you doing?

800
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:27,696
It's a song my grandfather sang.
The Rolling Stones.

801
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,021
Come on, sing it.

802
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,112
<i>Here it comes</i>

803
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:36,079
<i>Here comes your 19th</i>
<i>nervous breakdown</i>

804
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,776
<i>Commander.</i>
<i>A massive low-pressure system...</i>

805
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,561
<i>...is approaching the crew.</i>

806
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:12,153
<i>Atmospheric pressure 820 millibars.</i>

807
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,947
Gentlemen, a big ice storm's
coming straight for you.

808
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,996
It's the size of Montana,
and it's moving fast.

809
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,165
I'm going into comm blackout.

810
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:24,001
You need to find shelter immediately.
Now.

811
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,833
Where are we gonna
find shelter around here?

812
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,719
Over here! There's an opening!

813
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:39,893
<i>Maximum sustained winds:</i>
<i>111 miles per hour.</i>

814
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:43,021
<i>Negative 50 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

815
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:52,651
Hurry.

816
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:03,992
Shit!

817
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,043
Houston, this is <i>Mars-1.</i>

818
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,278
How far is <i>Cosmos</i> from here?

819
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:35,360
What?

820
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:37,404
<i>Cosmos.</i>

821
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,407
How far you think it is?

822
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,489
Five or six hours.

823
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:44,616
Say five.

824
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:48,712
That leaves us four hours
to try and launch...

825
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:52,381
...not counting whatever time
we lose here.

826
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,926
This Borokovski better have
a good memory.

827
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:00,007
Won't be time for plan B.

828
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:40,930
Only two of us can go on <i>Cosmos.</i>

829
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:45,684
What?

830
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:49,477
There's only room on <i>Cosmos</i>
for two people.

831
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,064
You two will both go.

832
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:57,400
You carry on with the mission.

833
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,908
Tell people what they need to know,
about what you learned here.

834
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:04,738
When we get to <i>Cosmos</i>
I'll help you rig it, and then...

835
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,164
...we'll say goodbye.

836
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:18,093
Heh. Probably won't even launch.
It is Russian, after all.

837
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:21,972
Ten feet off the ground, it'll explode.
I'll live longer than both of you.

838
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,272
You're a rare man, Gallagher.

839
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:36,436
But somehow I don't quite believe it.

840
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,445
What are you talking about?

841
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,989
He thinks I'm responsible
for Santen's death.

842
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:47,155
What do you think, Gallagher?

843
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:49,745
Gallagher?

844
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,701
You trust me?

845
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,293
Do you?

846
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,551
I'll watch your back, you watch mine?

847
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,931
Shit, I know I don't trust you.

848
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:17,022
But you're going to leave
your buddy here behind...

849
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,228
...and take off with me?

850
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,157
Yes, that's...

851
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:26,027
That's what he's gonna do.

852
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,505
Mars-1, <i>this is Houston.</i>

853
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,713
<i>We don't know about your clock,</i>
<i>but ours is running out of time.</i>

854
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,803
<i>Your team's been out of contact</i>
<i>over three hours.</i>

855
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,466
<i>They did a great job getting</i>
<i>this far...</i>

856
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,552
<i>...but that's a killer storm</i>
<i>no one can survive.</i>

857
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,348
<i>So here's where we are:</i>

858
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:55,432
<i>If you haven't heard from your crew</i>
<i>by the time you receive this...</i>

859
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,729
<i>...you're ordered to return home.</i>

860
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,978
<i>Houston out.</i>

861
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,607
Gallagher, come in.

862
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:08,827
Gallagher, can you hear me, please?

863
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,634
Shit.

864
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,212
Burchenal.

865
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,756
- He's gone.
- What?

866
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,637
He took the radio.

867
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:33,261
Aw, shit. Shit!

868
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,399
It's AMEE.

869
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,273
She wants us to watch.

870
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:38,617
She's got him.

871
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:53,516
He was afraid we were gonna
leave him here. He made it come true.

872
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,521
We gotta get that radio
or we're both dead too.

873
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,027
We lost three hours.

874
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,855
At least Pettengil's heading
in the right direction.

875
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:12,535
- How do you know?
- I took a heading before the storm.

876
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,071
And lined it up with the stars.

877
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:16,698
We're okay.

878
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,845
Hey.

879
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,349
Hold on.

880
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:49,855
This is algae.

881
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:52,445
There's algae here.

882
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,278
Why is it here and nowhere else?

883
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:03,961
No time for that now.

884
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:05,709
There's Pettengil.

885
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,978
At least he didn't drop
the goddamn radio.

886
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:33,908
AMEE really tore him up.

887
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:40,994
Ugh.

888
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:47,126
Little shit's got a death grip on it.
Give me the radio.

889
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,255
I'll call Bowman.

890
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,545
Why'd he close his visor?

891
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,843
He didn't have any air left.

892
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,446
Bowman, it's Gallagher. You up there?

893
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,782
Bowman, it's Gallagher.

894
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:26,745
Must still be on the dark side.

895
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:35,545
Argh!

896
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:37,763
Jesus!

897
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,725
Some kind of nematode.

898
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:51,852
The sparks ignited them.

899
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,901
They're feeding on the algae.

900
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:58,826
That's where it went.
They're feeding on the algae.

901
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,908
Come on. Son of a bitch.

902
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:02,408
Got it.

903
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,619
- Thought there wasn't any life here.
- I was wrong.

904
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:10,713
Where there's water
and air, there's life.

905
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:14,087
Think it's so smart to take
those things with us?

906
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:17,678
- You don't get how important this is.
- I'm the janitor, remember?

907
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,514
Earth's losing oxygen.
See how those things burned?

908
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:23,017
They make it.
They eat algae, and they make O-2.

909
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:26,645
I finally get it.
I told you I'd solve this damn thing.

910
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,647
Why are the nematodes here?

911
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:31,309
Because there's something left to eat.

912
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:39,863
Hang on.

913
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,667
I haven't seen green fields like this
since I was a kid.

914
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:33,579
Gallagher.

915
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,085
Burchenal.

916
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,091
They're eating through my suit.

917
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:40,885
Stay there.

918
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,682
You'll need my air. For the launch.

919
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:49,228
Take this back, Gallagher.

920
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:52,765
Accomplish the mission.

921
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,434
It's up to you now.

922
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,898
Better put your helmet on.

923
01:20:57,227 --> 01:20:59,696
I'm not going out like Pettengil.

924
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:16,540
<i>Commander, there is a disturbance</i>
<i>on the surface of Mars.</i>

925
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,050
Oh, God.

926
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:28,847
<i>Mars ground crew, this is</i> Mars-1.
<i>Can you hear me? Over.</i>

927
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:33,230
<i>Mars ground crew, this is</i> Mars-1.
<i>Do you copy? Over.</i>

928
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,354
<i>Gallagher, what's going on?</i>
<i>What's happened?</i>

929
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:41,067
<i>Mars ground crew, this is</i> Mars-1.
<i>Can you hear me? Over.</i>

930
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,452
<i>I can't go back.</i>

931
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:54,209
<i>There was some kind of oxygen burn-off.</i>

932
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,503
<i>It was like a blowtorch.</i>

933
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,206
<i>- Burchenal's gone.</i>
- Gallagher.

934
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,796
He sacrificed himself.

935
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,178
<i>Gallagher, where are the others?</i>

936
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:07,006
<i>- I've got to rest.</i>
- Gallagher.

937
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:09,303
Where are the other guys?

938
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,182
Dead.

939
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:16,682
All dead.

940
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:21,354
<i>- I'm the only one left.</i>
- Gallagher, stop and listen to me.

941
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:23,776
<i>It's over.</i>

942
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:26,325
I don't know what happened tonight...

943
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,704
...but you have come too far
to give up now.

944
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:35,209
<i>You are going to accomplish</i>
<i>the mission.</i>

945
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:36,998
I can't.

946
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:41,423
<i>Burchenal sacrificed himself for you.</i>
<i>You want to make that for nothing?</i>

947
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:45,507
I want you to stand up
and I want you to start walking.

948
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:50,758
<i>If you can't do it for him,</i>
<i>Gallagher...</i>

949
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,226
- I can't.
<i>- ...do it for me.</i>

950
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:57,014
Do it for me.

951
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:00,734
<i>You have to keep going.</i>

952
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:02,236
Okay.

953
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:34,889
<i>Fifty-five minutes until we</i>
<i>need to leave orbit, commander.</i>

954
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:44,270
- Time?
- <i>Fifty-two minutes to go.</i>

955
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:45,862
Should be there by now.

956
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:48,111
You're almost there.

957
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:50,777
I could have screwed up
the celestial nav.

958
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,366
- Could be off-course.
<i>- Trust me, you're there.</i>

959
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:58,913
- Could've run right past it.
<i>- Shut up and keep moving.</i>

960
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:18,975
I found it.

961
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,616
Okay. What do I do now?

962
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,822
Get rid of the sample return tray.

963
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,461
Okay. What next?

964
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:54,135
There's an infrared maintenance port.
It should be marked.

965
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:57,475
Marked. Yeah.

966
01:24:57,843 --> 01:24:59,345
In Russian.

967
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:03,564
All right.

968
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:05,396
Got it.

969
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:06,685
Now what?

970
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:09,108
Connect the radio to <i>Cosmos.</i>

971
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:12,365
I'll download what you need
through the modem.

972
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:26,292
Still works.

973
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:36,006
Go.

974
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,268
Okay, you should be able
to run diagnostics now.

975
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,243
All green.

976
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:59,154
Okay, now, this thing has two settings:
on and off.

977
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:02,616
<i>Right now, "on" sends it all the way</i>
<i>back to Earth.</i>

978
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,452
As you lack air, food and water,
that would be bad.

979
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:09,837
We want power to reach orbit. I've
recalculated for the weight of one.

980
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:14,420
Take two liters out of each fuel tank.
There's a central purge.

981
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:18,056
Russians couldn't add a gas gauge?

982
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:21,935
I'm going into comm blackout soon,
we're down to 49 minutes...

983
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,062
...so shut up and get to work.

984
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,237
Okay. What now?

985
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:39,578
Launch diagnostics. Avoid pressing
anything that says "ignition."

986
01:26:57,087 --> 01:26:59,465
Gallagher.

987
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:04,602
Battery's dead.

988
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,194
There's not enough power to launch.

989
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:15,780
Not enough power to launch.

990
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:19,118
- Anything else you can use?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

991
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:22,909
Let me look around. See if I see any
alternate high-voltage sources.

992
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:24,330
No.

993
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,537
It's just rocks.

994
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:35,588
I'll die on this planet.

995
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:39,508
I'll stay up here
and we'll find another way.

996
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:42,345
<i>You can't stay there without burning</i>
<i>more fuel to hold orbit.</i>

997
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:45,636
You gotta go.

998
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:53,731
How much time till blackout?

999
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:56,650
About a minute.

1000
01:27:57,314 --> 01:28:00,534
<i>Okay. There's a couple things</i>
<i>I gotta tell you.</i>

1001
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:02,528
<i>There's life here on Mars.</i>

1002
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,661
The guys couldn't figure how they got
here, but they ate the algae...

1003
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,159
<i>...and they ate HAB too.</i>

1004
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:11,752
<i>The important thing...</i>

1005
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:15,799
...is that they make oxygen.

1006
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,668
Don't know how...

1007
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:22,305
<i>...but Burchenal said it might</i>
<i>be able to save Earth...</i>

1008
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:27,144
<i>...so get some guys up here quick.</i>
<i>Just tell them to be safe.</i>

1009
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,479
They eat everything.

1010
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,813
<i>Thirty seconds, commander.</i>

1011
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:42,909
Well, that's about it. I, uh...

1012
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,329
I really hate this planet.

1013
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:50,659
I really miss Earth.

1014
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:55,171
I really miss a lot of things.

1015
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:58,717
I, um...

1016
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:04,673
I'm gonna miss you.

1017
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:13,098
Aren't you gonna say anything?

1018
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,866
I should have kissed you.

1019
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,414
Yeah, you should've kissed me.

1020
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:39,549
<i>Comm frequency lost, commander</i>

1021
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:54,765
Goodbye.

1022
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:20,295
<i>Here it comes</i>

1023
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:23,168
<i>Here it comes</i>

1024
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:56,410
Alternate high-voltage energy source.

1025
01:30:57,744 --> 01:30:59,462
Come and get me.

1026
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:03,504
I'm gonna steal your batteries,
sweetie.

1027
01:33:31,981 --> 01:33:33,449
Bye, sweetie.

1028
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,481
I'm going home.

1029
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:08,578
Fuck this planet.

1030
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:10,754
<i>Oxygen supply is low.</i>

1031
01:35:58,378 --> 01:36:00,506
<i>Warning. Object in orbital path.</i>

1032
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,424
Oh, my God. Gallagher.

1033
01:36:04,217 --> 01:36:05,264
Abort!

1034
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:08,434
Re-route orbital maneuvering.
I need pitch. Roll!

1035
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,682
Yaw. Ten-millimeter bursts.

1036
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:46,767
Seal this level.

1037
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:49,554
<i>Level sealed.</i>

1038
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:54,396
Open the dock.

1039
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:14,412
<i>Targeted object, .3 kilometers.</i>

1040
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:17,749
<i>We only have five minutes</i>
<i>before</i> Mars-1 <i>leaves orbit, commander.</i>

1041
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:19,925
Hook me up, Lucille!

1042
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:24,381
Line release! Full velocity!

1043
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:49,993
Gallagher!

1044
01:37:51,282 --> 01:37:53,284
Gallagher!

1045
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,047
Retract.

1046
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:21,153
Ninety-millimeter bursts!

1047
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:45,087
Seal! Emergency atmosphere now!

1048
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:50,174
<i>Atmosphere restored.</i>

1049
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:11,446
<i>Linking to suit computer.</i>

1050
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:13,619
<i>Gallagher's vital signs are negative.</i>

1051
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:16,201
<i>Bio-scan indicates cardiac arrest.</i>

1052
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:38,306
Come on!

1053
01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:45,063
Come on!

1054
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:52,408
<i>Stand him up, commander.</i>

1055
01:39:52,612 --> 01:39:53,909
Come on.

1056
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:17,307
Aw, man.

1057
01:40:19,055 --> 01:40:20,978
I saw Elvis.

1058
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:30,991
Let's go home, Lucille.

1059
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:50,219
<i>Organism bio-scan. DNA mapping.</i>

1060
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:54,552
Hard to believe they're the good guys.

1061
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:57,347
Do you think it was worth it?

1062
01:40:59,512 --> 01:41:01,355
Houston thinks so.

1063
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:04,935
On Earth, they're calling you a hero,
Gallagher.

1064
01:41:06,102 --> 01:41:08,981
God works in mysterious ways.

1065
01:41:11,941 --> 01:41:13,534
A memento?

1066
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:17,871
It's for Chantilas' granddaughter.

1067
01:41:22,118 --> 01:41:23,836
He had faith.

1068
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:38,601
You are not who I thought you were.

1069
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:52,364
<i>Nothing went the way</i>
<i>it was supposed to.</i>

1070
01:41:52,648 --> 01:41:56,778
<i>But the team, mankind</i>
<i>at its best and its worst...</i>

1071
01:41:56,986 --> 01:41:58,954
<i>...accomplished the mission.</i>

1072
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:06,713
<i>Maybe Chantilas was right.</i>
<i>Maybe it isn't just the science.</i>

1073
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:08,456
<i>I sure don't know.</i>

1074
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:11,926
<i>But whatever forces were at work,</i>
<i>we triumphed.</i>

1075
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:16,510
<i>And me? I've got six months</i>
<i>before we get home.</i>

1076
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:18,466
<i>I guess I'll get to know the janitor.</i>
