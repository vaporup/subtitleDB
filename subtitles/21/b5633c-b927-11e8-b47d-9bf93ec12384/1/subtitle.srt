1
00:00:57,754 --> 00:01:00,552
Frost fills the sky over
Ten Mile Lake

2
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:04,489
Silken threads anxicus of youth.

3
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:08,289
Looking at the moon and feeling lonely.

4
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:11,623
Envious of love, not of imortality.

5
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:15,927
This pointing will remind you of me.

6
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,238
Sian's grave?!

7
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:22,735
Sian died long ago.

8
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:25,007
She's ghost?!

9
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,646
Yes!
I'm a ghost but I bring mortals no harm.

10
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:34,357
I died far away from my home

11
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:36,348
An evil spirit took by corpse
and won't let me rest in peace.

12
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:42,198
If you want to save me,
move my bones away from here.

13
00:01:42,198 --> 00:01:44,597
Then it will be possible for
me to be reincarnated.

14
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:46,190
Sian!

15
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:47,795
I will save you.

16
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,802
Sian!

17
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:56,542
Ning!

18
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:06,352
Let them go, please.

19
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:12,121
The Diamond Sutra!

20
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:20,599
We've escaped!
Sian, we're safe!

21
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,663
Dawn is breaking.

22
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,631
Sian, hide in the tower of ashes.

23
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:28,900
If the sun's rays shine on you,
you'll never be reincarnated.

24
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:32,342
Ning, good-bye forever!

25
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:49,695
I hope that Sian will be reincarnated.

26
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,431
I must return
to the Orchid Buddhist Monastery.

27
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:56,201
If you need me, you can find me there.
Take care!

28
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:10,487
Looking for the way,
the way of freedom.

29
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:14,858
Sea and mountains,
I have traversed countless times.

30
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:17,554
A thousand paths,

31
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:21,756
all leading to my homeland.

32
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:25,869
The endless verdent mountains,

33
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:29,566
The mountains everywhere,
in howling wind and driving rain.

34
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:32,971
The path of the ancient garden.

35
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:37,171
Why does it never end?

36
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,021
The way of the Tao,
the way of freedom.

37
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:49,392
Devils and demons always
pronounce themselves good.

38
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:52,293
The anger of youth

39
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:56,324
Weeping ghosts and angry spritis,

40
00:03:57,067 --> 00:04:00,370
Times gone-by,

41
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,741
Why was there such a sea of blood?

42
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:07,539
The path of the ancient garden

43
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:11,741
Why can one never return on it?

44
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,189
Who is that young man?

45
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:21,724
He's the poor schoolar who
lived 2 blocks away.

46
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:24,625
Things have changed since he
was last here.

47
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,908
Wasn't he that shop's bill collector?

48
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:46,645
He doesn't even know it went
out of business long ago!

49
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:00,159
Welcome! Welcome!

50
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:33,129
The bill collector's here.

51
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,323
How much money did you collect?

52
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:36,866
We're here to catch escaped convicts.

53
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:38,101
It's the police! Run!

54
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:38,999
Pursue them!

55
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,240
You're Bing Chow?!

56
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,243
You've made a mistake.
He has a beard and I don't!

57
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:48,411
You shaved it off!

58
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:49,779
Take him back and collect the reward.

59
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:50,677
Get in!

60
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:53,816
I haven't committed any crime!

61
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:56,152
Let me go.
I've been wrongly accused!

62
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:58,052
Let me go.
I've been wrongly accused!

63
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,057
You're made a mistake.
I'm not Bing Chow!

64
00:06:01,057 --> 00:06:02,854
I am wrongly accused!

65
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:19,676
My name is Ning,
not Bing Chow.

66
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:20,768
Old man may I ask who...

67
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:27,250
A man just like you,
fated to being imprisoned.

68
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,148
So pessimistic!

69
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:32,155
It's all my elders' fault,
insisting I get an education

70
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:33,952
When I grew up,
I was learned and wrote books.

71
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:38,228
But when I write of my travels,
I'm accused of revealting state secrets.

72
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:40,797
When I write of history,
they say I'm satirizing the present.

73
00:06:40,797 --> 00:06:43,391
If I analyse milltary strategy,
they say I'm planning arebellion.

74
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:47,027
I can't even write fairy tales,
for they accuse me of promoting superstition.

75
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,073
Finally,
I wrote the biography of a powerful man.

76
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:52,166
Then he was arrested,
accused of being a rebel.

77
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:55,044
We here both sentenced to life imprisonment.

78
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:57,842
Wouldn't you say that prison is my fate?

79
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,551
A cockroach!

80
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,540
Where?

81
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:04,351
Cockroach?!

82
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:10,682
You're really wasteful!
The cockroaches here are of the best quality.

83
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:12,996
There are no delicacies here

84
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:15,487
After you're been here a while,
you'll even salivate ever a housefly.

85
00:07:16,532 --> 00:07:17,726
Old man, how long have you been here?

86
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:20,603
I was your age when I first arrived.

87
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:23,902
Look how I've changed!
Full of character!

88
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:25,866
You've been here a long time

89
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:29,012
Help! I am innocent!

90
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:30,747
I'm not Bing Chow!
I am innocent!

91
00:07:30,747 --> 00:07:35,150
You've made a mistake.
I'm not Bing Chow!

92
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:08,618
Another nightmare.
What did you dream this time?

93
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:09,986
I dreamt you were haggard and exhausted.

94
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:12,481
Exhausted?!
True, you will soon be totally exhausted.

95
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:16,559
You have nightmares every night.
Look at the calendar.

96
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:18,795
You've been here so long and
still can't adjust.

97
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,592
Soon you'll even forget
that your last name is Chow.

98
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:22,325
Old man, my last name isn't Chow!

99
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,594
Bing Chow!

100
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:28,371
Supper!

101
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:29,770
OK.

102
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,508
A chicken leg?!

103
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:38,613
Happy days are here again!

104
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:43,653
Old man!
There's only one bowl. You eat first.

105
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:46,251
No, it's for you.
I'd rather eat cockroaches.

106
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:48,391
I'll tell you something
when you've finished.

107
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:50,090
I haven't had chicken in a long time.

108
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:52,627
Old man, why are you carving my name?

109
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:57,567
All these men ate chicken legs.

110
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,159
We call that chicken a headless chicken.

111
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:02,101
After you've eaten it,
they chop off your head!

112
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,438
Chop off your head?!

113
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:14,951
Bing Chow, we have no personel quarrel.

114
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:16,441
Don't come back from the
greve and seek revenge on me

115
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:22,923
They behead people at noon.
It's now the middle of the night.

116
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:27,864
Some official's son got in trouble,
and they're looking for a substitute.

117
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:31,265
At night, the executioner
can't tell one from another.

118
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,770
Is there no justice in the world?

119
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:41,872
Is there no reward for being a good man?

120
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:48,516
It is of no concern to me.

121
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:01,790
I was always an honest man.

122
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:03,659
I'll give you whatever I can

123
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:07,904
This painting was a gift
from my dearest one.

124
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:09,296
I don't want to part with it even in death.

125
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,275
Young man, you have a good heart.

126
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:14,566
Let me give you a present.

127
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,279
You are so learned.

128
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,383
It is fortunate that I die
rather than you.

129
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:22,352
You're a good man.
Such a pity you have to die.

130
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:24,053
It would be a pity if you died, not me.

131
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:25,388
Anybody's death is a pity.

132
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:26,956
You're a rare speciman.

133
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:29,159
If you die, your type will be extinct.

134
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,760
It's been a long time
since I set somebody free.

135
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,955
This tunnel leads to the outside.

136
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,430
Go out and start anew.

137
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:40,103
Don't give me such false hopes.

138
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:42,438
If this is an escape route,
why didn't you escape long ago?

139
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:44,574
It's less troublesome for me
to write my book here.

140
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:47,177
When I finish,
then I'll escape and get it printed.

141
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:49,078
Don't worry about me.

142
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,147
Always keep this bundle with you.

143
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:54,584
Once you're out of here,
never come back!

144
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:56,279
Get going!

145
00:10:57,387 --> 00:10:58,684
What will happen to you
after I've gone?

146
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:00,823
They like hearing my stories

147
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:02,492
So long as I don't get to the story's end,

148
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:03,726
they'll never harm me.

149
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:05,094
But they'll accuse you
of helping me escape.

150
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:08,798
I'll say you were put to
death for somebody else 2 days ago.

151
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:11,096
They won't dare make a fuse.

152
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:13,732
- Go!
- Take care!

153
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:18,130
Bing Chow! The time has come

154
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:23,046
Bing Chow!

155
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:24,138
He's dead.

156
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:34,315
I've escaped!

157
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:50,168
There's even a horse here waiting for me!

158
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:56,973
That old man is really remarkable!

159
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,337
I must repay his kindness someday.

160
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,856
Hey! That's my horse!

161
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:09,256
What a stupid horse!
Letting a stranger ride him!

162
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,449
I don't even have time
to wash my hands!

163
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:17,698
You think you're fast over land...
I'll go underground!

164
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:19,595
Open sesame!

165
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,702
I must find a place
to get out of this downpour!

166
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:33,545
Good! A house!

167
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:38,777
Open the door!

168
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:48,660
"Righteous Villa"...

169
00:12:58,141 --> 00:12:59,335
Anybody home?

170
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:08,607
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

171
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:11,009
8 coffins!
Must be the whole family.

172
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:16,417
I won't disturb you.
I just want to stay the night.

173
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,422
Don't bother to get up.
I'll take care of myself.

174
00:13:22,398 --> 00:13:26,994
I told you not to go any trouble.
Please go back!

175
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:31,997
The way you rush about
in no fixed direction!

176
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,672
I had a hard time following you underground.

177
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:36,367
Don't you have any idea
where you're going?

178
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:39,747
Your face looks so horrible,
you must have suffered a painful death.

179
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:42,374
If you'd rushed around underground
all day like me,

180
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:44,916
you wouldn't have the energy
to come back to the surface.

181
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,961
I don't know you.
Why are ou following me?

182
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,861
I don't know you either,
so why did you take my horse?

183
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:57,090
That's your horse?

184
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,569
I thought it was the old man's.

185
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:02,163
Still you should have asked before taking it.

186
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:05,972
You're alive! Sorry!
It's all a misunderstanding.

187
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:11,773
If there's anything I can do to help,
just let me know.

188
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:16,219
Enough of your tricks!
A good thing my reactions are so fast.

189
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:18,688
Friend, you need a place to stay the night.

190
00:14:18,688 --> 00:14:20,182
Here there's a roof over your head.
Might as well stay here.

191
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:23,054
How do I know what you'd do
after I fell asleep?

192
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:29,889
I knew it!

193
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:34,337
Let's draw up some boundaries.
I'm staying next door.

194
00:14:34,337 --> 00:14:36,935
If you have something to say shout it!
Don't come over.

195
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:51,985
I haven't bathed in a long time.

196
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:45,704
The way

197
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:51,206
The spoken "way" is not "way"

198
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:54,876
Of haven and earth,

199
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:57,077
Of humang and swards

200
00:15:58,287 --> 00:15:59,455
Of evil and good,

201
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:00,556
This way, that way, every which way

202
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:01,423
Say that their way,

203
00:16:01,423 --> 00:16:02,658
is the only way

204
00:16:02,658 --> 00:16:05,094
Bah. Tehah, hah!

205
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:07,085
All bullshit,

206
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,269
This way, that way,

207
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:14,537
is still not the way

208
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:16,839
Ha! Ha!

209
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:17,940
The way of flowers and tea, Ha!

210
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,141
Of life and death,

211
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:20,276
Of density and intensity,

212
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:21,410
Of light and heat,

213
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,578
Of evil spirits

214
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:23,712
Of people committing crimes

215
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:25,407
Of bed ones in power! Ha!

216
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:27,745
I find my own way

217
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,947
I seek

218
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:36,952
My way!

219
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:53,035
Who is it?

220
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:58,035
Are you a mortal?

221
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:05,187
Hey, friend next door!
Get up! There's ghosts!

222
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:06,984
Get up! Do you hear me?

223
00:17:07,323 --> 00:17:08,415
Hurry and get up!

224
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:10,719
Not a sound.
Maybe he left already.

225
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:32,243
What a nuisance!

226
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,427
Friend, there are fierce ghosts here!

227
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:51,398
Ghosts?
I'll use my magic to banish them!

228
00:17:56,305 --> 00:18:00,503
Ghosts and goblins,
I order you to leave!

229
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:07,509
Oh, you understand the occult!

230
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:10,610
My nose is sensitive to
other worldly spirits...

231
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:12,383
So why do I smell nothing now?

232
00:18:13,722 --> 00:18:14,518
Get out of the way!

233
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,851
Abracadabra!

234
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:22,453
Strange!
Not even a hint of ghostly odour!

235
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,497
Abracadabra!
Hocus-pocus flash!

236
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:41,647
Abracadabra!
Abracadabra!

237
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:45,016
- Don't come here!
- Leave!

238
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:02,898
You're not even real ghosts!
Wasting my occult talents.

239
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:04,428
Phonies?

240
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,180
Want to trick me?

241
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,495
A good thing you have a waistband.

242
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:41,604
Stay away from me!

243
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:44,568
I'm falling...

244
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:47,979
Stop hugging me!

245
00:19:50,686 --> 00:19:51,675
Let go!

246
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,048
If I let go, I'll fall!

247
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:54,950
If you don't let go, I'll...

248
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:24,980
Sian?!

249
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:28,552
Sian!

250
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:38,423
Hocus-pocus heebie-jeebie!
I order you to freeze!

251
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:41,058
Freeze!

252
00:20:42,237 --> 00:20:44,330
Freeze!

253
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:46,299
Sian, is that you?

254
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,643
What kind of black magic is that?
Let them go!

255
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:51,339
Otherwise I'll kill him.

256
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,077
Oh... Freeze!

257
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:57,074
Kill him!
He's no friend of mine!

258
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:04,954
Elder Chu!
Are you Elder Chu, travelling incognito?

259
00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:06,688
Elder who?

260
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:08,221
Your disciple is deeply sorry.

261
00:21:09,164 --> 00:21:10,256
Disciple?!

262
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,694
Elder Chu?!

263
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:17,097
Sian, it's me!
Don't you recognize me?

264
00:21:18,273 --> 00:21:20,676
We come from a good family.
My name is Windy.

265
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:21,870
This is my younger sister, Moon.

266
00:21:22,444 --> 00:21:23,536
Elder Chu.

267
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,081
Elder, you can save us.

268
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:28,150
My father is Lord Fu,
the ex-Minister of Rites.

269
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,686
He was framed.
They're now transporting him to be executed.

270
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:32,586
We want to attack the transport wagon
and rescue him.

271
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:36,892
You are the learned and brilliant Chu.

272
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:39,461
You two are loyal imperial warriors.

273
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:40,763
Everyone is an eminent personnage.

274
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:42,331
Now it's my turn to introduce myself,

275
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:45,732
I am... Spell!

276
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:53,976
My name is Autumn,
from the Kunlun sect.

277
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,878
I've read everything that
the Elder has written.

278
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:57,546
I only use my magic to battle demons.

279
00:21:57,546 --> 00:21:58,945
I never get involved in affairs of state.

280
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:01,247
We pay our respects to Elder Chu.

281
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:06,422
My name is Ning, not Chu.

282
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:08,457
I can tell you are clever.

283
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:10,125
Clever people do not always
reveal their identities.

284
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,325
Anyway, in our hearts
we know who you really are.

285
00:22:13,562 --> 00:22:15,052
How can I make you believe me?

286
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:17,933
No need for you to say anything.
Everybody remember

287
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:20,102
From now on,
Elder Chu will be known as Ning.

288
00:22:20,102 --> 00:22:21,770
Chu is Ning.

289
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,759
Yes!

290
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:28,077
We will now take an oath.

291
00:22:28,077 --> 00:22:29,912
Whoever reveal their identities
will be chopped up into 10,000 pieces.

292
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:31,004
Yes!

293
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:35,115
Such an honour that you rode my horse!

294
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:44,822
Sian,
do you remember this painting and poem?

295
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:48,920
Sian?
Poem?

296
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:51,567
He's reciting poetry.
Quickly, pen and paper.

297
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:53,769
We must record what he says.
Elder is giving us a hint.

298
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:55,426
Hurry!

299
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,908
Frost fills the sky over 10 Mile Lake;

300
00:22:59,908 --> 00:23:02,177
Silken threads anxious of youth.

301
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:05,047
Looking at the moon and feeling lonely;

302
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:07,538
Envious of lovers, not of immortality.

303
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:10,445
Very profound!

304
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,388
What does "10 mile" mean?

305
00:23:13,388 --> 00:23:15,982
10 mile!

306
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:18,959
It is all very deep.

307
00:23:21,964 --> 00:23:23,659
His words are too profound!

308
00:23:26,802 --> 00:23:30,305
10 Mile?
That must mean 10 Mile Pavilion.

309
00:23:30,305 --> 00:23:31,499
There's a 10 Mile Pavilion near hear.

310
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:37,946
That's right!
Sister, "10 miles" refers to 10 Mile Pavilion.

311
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:38,844
It's nearby.

312
00:23:40,883 --> 00:23:45,254
I understand.
10 Mile Pavilion is not far from here.

313
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:48,257
"Frost" refers to Frost's Descent.

314
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:49,892
Each year has 24 climatic periods...

315
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:51,827
After the autumnal equinox comes the frost...

316
00:23:51,827 --> 00:23:53,462
and today is the day of Frost's Descent.

317
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:56,265
Elder is telling us that father will be
transported past 10 Mile Pavilion.

318
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:57,432
He's telling us to rescue him there.

319
00:23:57,432 --> 00:24:01,129
Elder is truly perceptive.
We can save father.

320
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:04,406
We had it right!

321
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:05,703
Good.

322
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:08,308
It hurts!

323
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,785
What's the matter?
Get up!

324
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:12,210
Reporting!

325
00:24:13,982 --> 00:24:17,286
Miss Windy! Your father will pass
the 10 Mile Pavilion tonight.

326
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:18,480
We already know that.

327
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:20,980
Elder is truly brilliant!

328
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:25,894
But what about the rest of the poem?
What do those 2 stanzas mean

329
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:26,862
3 stanzas.

330
00:24:26,862 --> 00:24:28,163
The meaning doesn't matter now.

331
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:29,357
Interpret it in any way you desire.

332
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:32,067
He means that we should have our own views...

333
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:33,903
not just listen
to what other people say, right?

334
00:24:33,903 --> 00:24:35,671
So, should we still listen to
what Elder says?

335
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:38,340
Not only listen,
but take notes and ponder his meaning

336
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,142
We must pass his wisdom
on to future generations.

337
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:41,210
Right!

338
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,445
Time to leave!

339
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:44,980
Good-bye.

340
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,248
We're off to 10 Mile Pavilion.

341
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:47,340
Yes. We're off to 10 Mile Pavilion.

342
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:52,283
Miss Windy,
please return Sian's painting to me.

343
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:54,314
Yes, Elder.

344
00:24:57,292 --> 00:25:00,083
When you call me Sian,
is that a hint that I need a pseudonym?

345
00:25:00,396 --> 00:25:01,995
From now on, my name is Sian

346
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:13,364
If Sian were reincarnated,
she would now be a babe in arms.

347
00:25:18,347 --> 00:25:19,644
She's not Sian!

348
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,562
What are you spying on?

349
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:47,667
Me?
Nothing.

350
00:25:56,485 --> 00:25:57,679
What are you spying on?

351
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:02,546
I wanted to see what you were spying on.
Time to go!

352
00:26:04,026 --> 00:26:06,561
Do you think your fiance, Prince Ma...

353
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:07,963
is as handsome as Elder?

354
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:10,999
We were betrothed before birth.
How do I know what he looks like?

355
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,796
Is that what people mean by fate?

356
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:15,499
Who are you referring to?

357
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:18,971
Oh, nobody.
It's just that I feel so fortunate.

358
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:23,238
Fortunate?
You're frothing at the mouth!

359
00:26:49,504 --> 00:26:50,493
Evil spirits!

360
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,316
Is this a foot print or a hand print?

361
00:27:01,316 --> 00:27:02,510
We'll know when we find the monster.

362
00:27:03,452 --> 00:27:04,350
Right!

363
00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:10,554
It even harmed a man.

364
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:13,662
What a pity to leave it here.
Better show it to Elder.

365
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:16,358
OK!
There really are ghosts in this place!

366
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,667
What is that?

367
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,635
A corpse!
It's all that ghost's fault.

368
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:22,034
Don't hug it.
Put it down.

369
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:26,007
How did this person die so pitifully?

370
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:28,407
I'd say this an evil ghost.
The odour is very strong.

371
00:27:29,177 --> 00:27:30,371
It's back!

372
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,774
Is it looking for us?

373
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,316
Use your "freeze" magic.

374
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:35,684
Right!

375
00:27:35,684 --> 00:27:38,380
I command you to freeze!

376
00:27:40,822 --> 00:27:45,816
Heebie-jeebie! Freeze!
That'll stop him!

377
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,965
How do you do it?

378
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:52,263
When you see a ghost, shout "freeze".

379
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:55,492
Like this? Freeze!
Is that right?

380
00:27:56,271 --> 00:28:03,370
Oh, no!
How do you lift the spell?

381
00:28:08,617 --> 00:28:10,016
I have to think of a way
to communicate with him.

382
00:28:10,152 --> 00:28:12,721
What can I do?
Let's try this...

383
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:15,257
If I'm right,
move your eyes up and down.

384
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:16,625
That's right! Fantastic!

385
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:19,494
If I'm wrong,
move them from left to right.

386
00:28:19,494 --> 00:28:20,688
Great!

387
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:24,455
Will a hand gesture lift the spell?

388
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:38,340
What?
Not up and down or left to right.

389
00:28:39,448 --> 00:28:41,983
Don't joke with me.

390
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:44,152
If we wait too long,
that monster will get us.

391
00:28:44,152 --> 00:28:48,336
Does lifting the spell
have to do with an acupuncture point?

392
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:51,322
Your eyes are moving faster
than a revolving lantern!

393
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:55,330
I understand!
You're provoking me into hitting you.

394
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,531
OK.
I'm going to hit you now

395
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:00,423
Ready or not, here it comes!

396
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,379
Let's get out of here!

397
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,611
Come on!

398
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:27,988
You're too heavy.
I can't carry you.

399
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:35,704
Drag it!
Dragging you isn't fast enough either.

400
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:37,296
Better hide upstairs.

401
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,111
I told you
not to fool around at a time like this.

402
00:29:54,322 --> 00:29:56,017
That monster is so tall,
it'll see us if he stand up straight.

403
00:29:59,761 --> 00:30:02,855
How can I undo the spell?

404
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:08,968
It's safer inside.
Better hide yourself quick.

405
00:30:22,651 --> 00:30:23,852
I told you to hide inside.

406
00:30:23,852 --> 00:30:25,752
Why did you go down there,
where it's so dangerous?

407
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:08,356
Try the "freeze" curse!
Freeze!

408
00:31:19,107 --> 00:31:20,699
Let's continue without guessing game.

409
00:31:22,944 --> 00:31:25,037
You're getting heavier and heavier.
Can't carry you much longer.

410
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:27,782
Since that monster isn't here...

411
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:29,374
let's try to lift the spell.

412
00:31:32,587 --> 00:31:33,986
Does it have anything to do with this amulet?

413
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:37,656
Yes?!
What then?

414
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:42,998
Point at me.
Point at me and the curse will be lifted.

415
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:44,090
Point!

416
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:54,568
How do I undo the spell?

417
00:32:09,157 --> 00:32:11,455
Freeze!

418
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:22,169
Don't move!
Move! Move!

419
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:23,968
Don't move!

420
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:28,710
Why does he "unfreeze" so quickly,

421
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,302
but you haven't moved for so long?

422
00:32:31,346 --> 00:32:35,942
Do you mean...
I pointed to this amulet...

423
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:38,751
Then I asked you how to lift the spell...

424
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:42,384
And he moved!
Freeze!

425
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:48,654
I'll take care of it.
Get out of here fast!

426
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:51,380
Finally lifted the spell!

427
00:33:53,228 --> 00:33:54,225
Get out of here!

428
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:56,326
Abracadabra!
Open up a way out!

429
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:01,331
Abracadabra!
Open up a way out!

430
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:06,703
Out of the way!
I'll take care of it!

431
00:34:16,484 --> 00:34:17,576
Abracadabra!

432
00:34:22,724 --> 00:34:24,123
Hocus pocus!

433
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:48,410
I order all ghosts to be expelled!

434
00:34:59,594 --> 00:35:01,084
Wow!
It doesn't fear my incantations!

435
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:14,430
It's still moving!

436
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,210
I order all ghosts to be expelled!

437
00:35:33,805 --> 00:35:35,597
Even when it's chopped up
he can still run away!

438
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:36,791
It could still come back at any time.

439
00:35:37,332 --> 00:35:39,701
Elder, get out of here.
I'll pursue it!

440
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:40,668
Be careful!

441
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:41,566
Earth, open up!

442
00:35:50,511 --> 00:35:51,637
Dawn is breaking

443
00:35:56,317 --> 00:35:57,807
Heebie-jeebie!
Freeze!

444
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:04,587
Freeze!

445
00:36:08,196 --> 00:36:09,128
Earth, open up!

446
00:36:16,037 --> 00:36:16,867
Want to leave!

447
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:18,769
Wow!

448
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:22,331
My magical powers are no good at all

449
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:29,742
Earth, open up!

450
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,009
A magician?!

451
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:32,415
Take this!

452
00:36:43,765 --> 00:36:45,967
Hey!
Stop! Stop!

453
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:48,265
Are you stupid?
I told you to stop!

454
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:50,894
We don't even know each other.
Why are we fighting?

455
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,542
I learned magic to deal with evil spirits.

456
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:57,033
If you don't stop,
I'll use my magic to "freeze" you.

457
00:36:58,146 --> 00:37:00,341
Why are you blocking my way?

458
00:37:01,015 --> 00:37:02,183
I was just taking a rest
after battling some ghosts,

459
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:03,751
and you say I'm blocking your way.

460
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:05,720
When that monster makes a run for it tonight,
you'll be in deep trouble.

461
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,321
Brother!

462
00:37:06,321 --> 00:37:07,989
Call me Master.

463
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:09,023
Master, your skill is extraordinary.

464
00:37:09,023 --> 00:37:11,719
If you worked for the imperial court,
your future would be boundless.

465
00:37:12,994 --> 00:37:15,530
You know that I'm a Taoist monk.

466
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,133
Seeking wealth and position
is for the likes of you mere mortals.

467
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:23,126
I don't want to end up like you...
Earth, open up!

468
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,608
What a pity.

469
00:37:27,608 --> 00:37:31,009
Hu, our horses' hoofs are rigid.
They won't move!

470
00:37:36,117 --> 00:37:38,152
It must be that monk's magic at work!

471
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:40,455
He said there are evil spirits.
Be careful!

472
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:41,353
Yes!

473
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:55,129
Lord Fu!

474
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:59,098
There's nothing I can do
about squabbles in the imperial court.

475
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,212
It's hard to tell right from wrong.
I'm just following orders.

476
00:38:04,212 --> 00:38:05,406
But don't worry.

477
00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:08,540
I'll make sure your journey is safe.

478
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,918
After we get to the capital,

479
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:14,319
whatever the emperor does to you
is not my responsibility

480
00:38:19,761 --> 00:38:21,058
Let's go!

481
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,136
Where can I get something to eat?

482
00:38:39,313 --> 00:38:40,648
Please give me a bowl of your cheapest food.

483
00:38:40,648 --> 00:38:42,116
What?
The cheapest?

484
00:38:42,116 --> 00:38:45,711
Sit down!
If you're starving don't waste your money.

485
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:49,888
Show me your face.

486
00:38:50,258 --> 00:38:51,759
Go!

487
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:52,953
Stand up.

488
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:56,023
Don't lower your head.

489
00:38:56,697 --> 00:38:57,765
Go!

490
00:38:57,765 --> 00:38:58,663
Go!

491
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:01,750
Don't run away!

492
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,759
Don't move!

493
00:39:09,744 --> 00:39:10,836
Monks?

494
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,472
Don't move!

495
00:39:14,582 --> 00:39:15,674
Stand still!

496
00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:27,924
Out of the way!

497
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:29,285
Get out of the way!

498
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:48,540
What kind of magic is this?

499
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:11,868
It's Windy...

500
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,236
Come back!

501
00:40:16,777 --> 00:40:18,677
Hey!

502
00:40:21,516 --> 00:40:22,884
The soldiers never come to
10 Mile Pavilion last night.

503
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:24,378
Rush back to Righteous Villa
and lie in ambush for them.

504
00:40:26,154 --> 00:40:28,452
Hey!

505
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:31,552
Back to Righteous Villa?
It's haunted!

506
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,957
Come back!

507
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:43,462
Elder! Elder!

508
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:46,541
I wonder if Elder has already gone?

509
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:47,675
Better search for him.

510
00:40:47,675 --> 00:40:48,471
Yes!

511
00:40:51,846 --> 00:40:54,041
Do you think father's transport
has already passed by here?

512
00:40:54,682 --> 00:40:57,919
No. They're not supposed
to reach here until after dark.

513
00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:00,319
Miss Windy, the villa has been ransacked.

514
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:03,224
I'm sure Elder did it
to remove any traces of our presence.

515
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:04,325
Set everything up.
Prepare to attack.

516
00:41:04,325 --> 00:41:05,226
Yes!

517
00:41:05,226 --> 00:41:06,420
Hurry up! Over there!

518
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:56,043
Who is it?

519
00:41:56,043 --> 00:41:57,032
Who is it?

520
00:41:57,912 --> 00:41:59,903
- I'm Ning.
- Ning?

521
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,947
Oh, it's Elder!

522
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:05,620
This villa is haunted.

523
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,821
Haunted?

524
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:07,722
Where is Miss Windy?

525
00:42:07,722 --> 00:42:08,911
Inside.

526
00:42:09,924 --> 00:42:10,791
Ghosts?

527
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:11,780
Real ghosts?

528
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:35,237
Miss Windy!

529
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,442
My clothes!

530
00:42:39,987 --> 00:42:41,079
Miss Windy!

531
00:42:43,024 --> 00:42:44,013
Miss Windy!

532
00:42:49,664 --> 00:42:50,961
Elder, they said you came.

533
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,751
Miss Moon!

534
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:54,799
Who are you?

535
00:43:01,575 --> 00:43:03,566
Oh, it's Elder.
I recognize your back.

536
00:43:04,145 --> 00:43:05,043
Elder...

537
00:43:07,915 --> 00:43:09,109
I...

538
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:15,952
With your beard shaved off,
you're so, so...

539
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:18,014
Yes.

540
00:43:19,093 --> 00:43:21,584
When my sister sees you,
she'll be so happy for me.

541
00:43:22,963 --> 00:43:24,098
Happy?!

542
00:43:24,098 --> 00:43:25,690
When you came in,
did you see my sister?

543
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:28,469
Your sister?
No. No!

544
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:32,667
Sister! Sister! Sister!

545
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:37,178
What are you grinning about?

546
00:43:37,178 --> 00:43:38,270
It is improper to look.

547
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:45,553
There are some things you shouldn't look at.

548
00:43:45,553 --> 00:43:47,154
You're all right!

549
00:43:47,154 --> 00:43:49,957
I didn't recognize Elder
with his beard shaved off.

550
00:43:49,957 --> 00:43:51,254
Really?
I must see for myself.

551
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:53,627
Elder,
if you have something to say, just say it.

552
00:43:53,627 --> 00:43:55,796
It scares me when you hint at things.

553
00:43:55,796 --> 00:43:56,990
I'm cold.

554
00:43:57,365 --> 00:43:59,265
Your face is so hot,
how can you be cold?

555
00:44:00,368 --> 00:44:02,336
Wouldn't this be faster?

556
00:44:02,336 --> 00:44:04,138
Not fast enough.
Faster would be better.

557
00:44:04,138 --> 00:44:06,638
- Faster?!
- OK.

558
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,077
Elder...

559
00:44:17,618 --> 00:44:18,915
Elder said he was cold.

560
00:44:19,687 --> 00:44:20,676
Cold?

561
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:23,989
Elder,
you're overly exerting yourself.

562
00:44:33,734 --> 00:44:36,404
Have you seen Miss Windy?

563
00:44:36,404 --> 00:44:37,894
No, I'm looking for her too.

564
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:40,000
Where did she go?

565
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:44,908
There's noise coming from upstairs.
Let's go up for a look.

566
00:45:04,131 --> 00:45:05,223
Don't go up there.

567
00:45:07,812 --> 00:45:09,299
Strange!
Nobody up here.

568
00:45:13,341 --> 00:45:15,033
Maybe it's next door.
Let's go over and look.

569
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:29,890
What are you doing?

570
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,593
Sister,
Elder came back to find me... us.

571
00:45:32,593 --> 00:45:35,084
Why are your clothes so dishevelled?

572
00:45:37,031 --> 00:45:38,328
Don't be so impolite in the future.

573
00:45:44,271 --> 00:45:46,171
Miss Windy, this villa is haunted.

574
00:45:47,074 --> 00:45:49,043
Do we still have to pretend to be ghosts?

575
00:45:49,043 --> 00:45:51,545
No matter what,
we must wait here for father.

576
00:45:51,545 --> 00:45:53,035
We mustn't leave.

577
00:45:54,448 --> 00:45:55,583
In this moment of danger,

578
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,151
we must thrust out
our chests and be fearless.

579
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:59,142
We must be utterly devoted to our cause.

580
00:46:02,056 --> 00:46:03,956
Elder, let's go in.

581
00:46:07,061 --> 00:46:07,995
Elder!

582
00:46:07,995 --> 00:46:09,189
Your clothes are torn in the back.
