1
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:21,040
How do you write the
"freeze" incantation?

2
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:31,124
I didn't spy on him.
I didn't even know he was outside.

3
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:35,130
Better tie your heart down.

4
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,165
Otherwise, it might fly away

5
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:37,654
If I could tie it down, I would!

6
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:54,372
This is how you do it...

7
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:04,884
It works!

8
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:11,934
This is the "freeze" incantation.

9
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:14,903
If you see that monster,
do this and he'll freeze in his tracks.

10
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:15,671
Like this?

11
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:17,673
Don't do it haphazardly.
This spell is hard to reverse.

12
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:19,368
- Give me your hand.
- Yes!

13
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:32,743
Sister, what's that sound?

14
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:46,667
- It's coming from up there.
- Windy!

15
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,967
Windy, give me your hand.

16
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:52,107
Elder, shouldn't you be calling me Sian?

17
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:54,343
Whether I call you Sian or Windy,
there's no need to be bashful.

18
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:56,140
I'll never reveal what happened just now.

19
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,478
I was really anxious on your behalf.

20
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:02,685
Actually, I kissed you
because I couldn't control myself.

21
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:04,286
Fortunately you made a quick get-away.

22
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:06,488
Otherwise, if Moon had seen you undressed
and with me...

23
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:08,683
it would be hard to explain,
even if I were Elder Chu.

24
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:10,924
Give me your hand.

25
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,028
Moon?!

26
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:15,519
Moon, what are you doing here?

27
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:18,367
I was looking for you.

28
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,356
Don't bother explaining.

29
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:21,637
Moon!

30
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:24,340
No, Windy!
Give me your hand

31
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,332
We're not fated for each other.
I'm betrothed to Lord Ma's son.

32
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:29,745
You're betrothed?

33
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:30,946
We weren't meant for each other.

34
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:33,346
You should be looking for Moon, not me.

35
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,342
Windy, one at a time.
I'm after both of you.

36
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:49,124
Miss Moon, it's getting dark.
Give me your hand.

37
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,293
Go to my sister instead.

38
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:54,870
I'll go to her next.
Quick, give me your hand.

39
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,438
Elder, aren't you the playboy!

40
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:58,073
You can only choose one of us.

41
00:02:58,073 --> 00:02:59,165
I'm not going to compete with my sister.

42
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:03,844
No need to compete.
When I finish with you I'll go to her.

43
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:26,024
Elder, there is something I must tell you.

44
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:29,369
Actually, love is a strange thing.

45
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:33,703
My heart beats wildly when I look at you.

46
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:39,637
I don't even have the courage
to glance at you.

47
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:46,249
I'm afraid that my heart
would jump right out.

48
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:00,766
Help!

49
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:02,204
What's that?

50
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:03,694
Hurry up!
That monster is back.

51
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:08,007
Go inside and search.

52
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,575
Yes!

53
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:13,682
Inside there's a huge creature.

54
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:14,876
I don't know what it is.

55
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:25,494
Be calm!
Use the "freeze" incantation.

56
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:26,586
Together: Freeze!

57
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:32,296
It sure does!

58
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,507
We froze it in its tracks.

59
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:51,680
Everybody, jump up there!

60
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:08,129
The archery machine!

61
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:23,909
- Be careful!
- Elder!

62
00:05:41,403 --> 00:05:43,338
Moon, go and rescue Elder.
I'll lure away that monster.

63
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:44,236
Yes!

64
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:52,138
Put out the net.

65
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:56,881
Your hand...

66
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,091
Let's retreat from here.

67
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:19,641
See what's going on up ahead

68
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:20,539
Yes!

69
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:24,613
Soldiers!

70
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:26,005
Hu, they've set up an ambush

71
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:29,881
Windy, Moon?!

72
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:31,587
It's father!

73
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:33,488
Lure the soldiers into the villa.

74
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:34,785
Use the archery machine
to mow them down!

75
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:39,721
Trying to get away?

76
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:43,365
The monster destroyed the archery machine!

77
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:44,457
We're surrounded by our toes

78
00:06:46,134 --> 00:06:48,170
Let me out!

79
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,569
Right!
Let Elder go!

80
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:51,440
Elder, what should we do now?

81
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,507
We'll stay on the sidelines.

82
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:54,304
When the enemy comes in,
the monster will deal with them.

83
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:05,952
Obviously a fake ghost.
Unmask it.

84
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:13,276
- Let's rescue father!
- Yes!

85
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:24,527
You're hopelessly outnumbered.

86
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:35,009
I'll save you!

87
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:40,850
Swords are too dangerous!
Let's use our fists.

88
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,670
I told you that swords are too dangerous!

89
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:20,386
Father!

90
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:22,088
Get out of here.
Don't worry about me!

91
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:27,459
Don't worry about me!
Rescue father!

92
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:35,873
The monster is here!

93
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:38,473
Abracadabra!
Hocus pocus!

94
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:43,180
Abraoadabra!
Hocus pocus!

95
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:48,686
Windy! Windy!

96
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:51,700
- Possessed by evil spirits?!
- Sister!

97
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,479
- What happened to Windy?
- She's been possessed by evil spirits.

98
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,630
What should we do?

99
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,831
Still a lot of soldiers around.
Better get inside.

100
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:02,525
Don't move!

101
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:04,639
Press down on her!

102
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,705
Sister!

103
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:08,377
Think of a way to save my sister.

104
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:09,978
She's possessed by the evil spirits.

105
00:09:09,978 --> 00:09:11,570
She could turn into a giant monster
at any moment.

106
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,647
It's your fault, you traitor.
I'll kill you!

107
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:17,152
Wait!
His troops are still out there.

108
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:19,147
We must keep him as a hostage.

109
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:23,751
She's turning into a corpse monster!

110
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,501
Sister!

111
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,429
We must kill her immediately

112
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:29,624
- Otherwise she'll turn into a monster.
- You can't kill her!

113
00:09:30,298 --> 00:09:31,800
Are you a good person or evil?

114
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,402
You won't kill Hu,
but you'll kill my sister.

115
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:34,300
Kill Hu!

116
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:37,606
No matter how many you kill here,
you still won't save the kingdom.

117
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:41,643
The emperor has no idea
of the suffering of his people.

118
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:43,845
Take my head to the emperor.
Maybe it will move him.

119
00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:47,115
He'll be convinced
of our sincerity and loyalty.

120
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:49,985
Father, if you die
we'll have no one to lead us.

121
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:51,453
Take my head instead.

122
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:53,855
No!
Take our heads.

123
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:56,258
Bastards!
What good is it to cut off your heads?

124
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:57,859
Who are you, ordering people about?!

125
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:00,054
I am the learned and brilliant Elder Chu!

126
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:03,021
The learned and brilliant Elder Chu.

127
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:11,239
Please guide us.

128
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,841
None of you are permitted to die.

129
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:13,742
Please explain!

130
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:14,910
Explain?!

131
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,745
Your severed heads
will mean nothing to the emperor.

132
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:18,280
You'll have died in vain.
Need I explain more?

133
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,372
Stupid pigs!

134
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:22,141
What about her?

135
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:39,434
To exorcise her,
she needs a dose of "yang" energy.

136
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,669
I am not powerful enough.

137
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:43,205
We better do something soon
or it will be too late.

138
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:44,372
What can we do?

139
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:45,841
Try this magic charm.
It may or may not work.

140
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,209
Hurry up and pull Miss Windy down.

141
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:48,107
OK.

142
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:03,149
I order the evil spirits to be exercised.

143
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:19,065
How did this happen?

144
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,013
I've forced the evil spirit from her.

145
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:27,182
If she gets a quick dose of "yang" energy,
there will be a gleam of hope.

146
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:28,517
Hurry up.

147
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:29,885
Hurry!

148
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:32,220
I'm a monk.
I must not get too close to women.

149
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,339
Don't be afraid of her ugliness.

150
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:36,358
- How do we give her "yang" energy?
- With your mouth, of course.

151
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:37,692
Mouth?

152
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:38,784
What then?
Your ears?

153
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:40,419
Send me to her.

154
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:43,260
Abracadabra!
Hocus pocus!

155
00:12:36,184 --> 00:12:37,276
Sister!

156
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,755
A real man is afraid of nothing.

157
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,221
Lord, a golden-robed priest
is on his way here.

158
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:18,219
A golden-robed priest?

159
00:13:36,144 --> 00:13:37,236
Put your swords down!

160
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:43,576
Not enough!
More!

161
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:46,781
Lower your swords!

162
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:48,320
Put all your swords down!

163
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:56,658
There are evildoers
behind every country's downfall.

164
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:59,258
Take my head and collect your reward.

165
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:10,245
The way that you look death
calmly in the face,

166
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:11,542
proves that you are loyal to our country.

167
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,272
Even though our political views are different,

168
00:14:16,184 --> 00:14:18,175
I'm still willing to help you.

169
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:22,584
The golden-robed Taoist outside
is the High Priest.

170
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:24,759
The High Priest?

171
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,852
All the rites and rituals in the palace...

172
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:29,898
the emperor consults him for guidance.

173
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:32,792
If he speaks on your behalf,
justice will triumph.

174
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:35,094
Father!

175
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:40,998
Lord Fu, if you trust me,
let me go to him.

176
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:43,170
I'll explain the true situation.

177
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:50,983
Father, he might betray you!

178
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,510
He could have killed me had he wanted to.

179
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,259
Still not awake?!

180
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:04,361
Enough!
I'm going to puke.

181
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,991
Elder!

182
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:43,171
I am here to pay my respects
to the high priest.

183
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:45,974
Lord Fu is not a traitor.

184
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:48,543
He is a loyal subject, a patriot.

185
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:50,140
I hope that you will uphold justice.

186
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:54,504
There are many
who cannot tell between good and evil.

187
00:15:55,216 --> 00:15:57,485
They do not know the hardships
of the imperial court.

188
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:00,181
The purpose of my journey
is to pacify the people.

189
00:16:00,688 --> 00:16:05,489
I'll intercede at court on
behalf of these loyal subjects.

190
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,061
Amen! Amen!

191
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:08,050
Thank you, High Priest!

192
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:31,808
How are you, Autumn?

193
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:39,115
Women are very tempting.
If I didn't exercise self-control...

194
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:41,084
my energy would have been dissipated.

195
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,736
Hu is treacherous
and disrupts the High Priest's harmony.

196
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:49,725
Please stay here.

197
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:17,098
The convict Lord Fu is here
to see the High Priest.

198
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:18,867
I pay my respects to the High Priest.

199
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:22,604
Amen! Amen!
You have a murderous air about you.

200
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:25,801
Put down your weapons.

201
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:29,544
I've been framed,
but I am concerned about our nation.

202
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:34,649
You're so merciful.
Guide the emperor to save the nation.

203
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:37,886
Life is chaotic.

204
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:41,287
Mistakes can always be corrected.

205
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:22,520
In my former life I was evil
so I must do good in this life.

206
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:29,800
Release my soul from purgatory.

207
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:32,200
Release my soul from purgatory.

208
00:18:46,054 --> 00:18:47,146
Evil chanting?!

209
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:50,683
Don't be tricked!

210
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,748
Sit down!

211
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:56,924
His mercy is false!
Don't be tricked by his devilish voice!

212
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,195
Abracadabra!
Freeze!

213
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,034
I order the evil spirits to be exercised!

214
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,492
I am the absolute Buddha.

215
00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:29,457
What kind of evil spirit are you!

216
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:32,762
Even before Buddha
you refuse to reveal your true appearance!

217
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:35,903
The spirit of evil?!
I am what I look like!

218
00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:38,539
I don't believe you are Buddha!

219
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:39,774
Let's go over
and see if you're real or false.

220
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:40,866
Don't!

221
00:19:51,586 --> 00:19:55,078
Abracadabra!
Hocus pocus!

222
00:20:12,674 --> 00:20:13,641
Elder!

223
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:14,835
The bastard Hu betrayed us.

224
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:17,078
I'll take care of things here.
Leave quickly!

225
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:20,673
Abracadabra! Hocus pocus!
The universe revolves.

226
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:29,223
May Buddha be in your heart.

227
00:20:29,223 --> 00:20:31,418
I knew he was false,
but couldn't conquer him.

228
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,154
I failed!

229
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:38,188
I can't perform my magic with you here.

230
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,657
I'll open a tunnel in the earth for you.
Hurry!

231
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:49,110
Autumn!

232
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,101
Hurry up!

233
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,873
I can't hold out.

234
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:55,183
Hurry!

235
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:58,277
Abracadabra!
Hurry!

236
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:08,420
Father!

237
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,699
They've escaped for now
but I'll get them in the end.

238
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:24,979
Guard the three we've captured!

239
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,071
Yes!

240
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:35,857
What about Lord Fu?

241
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:38,126
They have admitted their errors.
They have departed.

242
00:21:38,126 --> 00:21:40,495
People should acknowledge
the immensity of the universe.

243
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:41,587
I just heard a fight going on.

244
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,299
Your ears aren't clean!

245
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:49,702
Vacate your mind
to attain perfect peace of mind.

246
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:48,353
I'm very cold.

247
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:24,859
Sian!

248
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,529
Don't leave me!

249
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:48,051
Sian!

250
00:23:54,262 --> 00:23:55,456
Don't be reincarnated so soon.

251
00:23:57,198 --> 00:23:58,597
It's too hard to be mortal now.

252
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,999
You're so good to Sian.

253
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:04,196
I never realized
how much you missed her!

254
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:07,306
I never realized
how much you missed her!

255
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:11,496
Frost fills the sky over 10 Mile Lake.

256
00:25:12,006 --> 00:25:14,497
Silken threads anxoius of youth.

257
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:19,914
Looking at the moon and feeling lonely.

258
00:25:19,914 --> 00:25:27,912
Envious of lovers, not of immortality.

259
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:37,661
Sian!

260
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:47,508
Sian, what are you doing here?

261
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:49,777
Hide!
You can't let the sun shine on you!

262
00:25:49,777 --> 00:25:51,312
If the sun shines on you,
your soul will be scattered.

263
00:25:51,312 --> 00:25:53,507
You would never be reincarnated!

264
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:57,106
Why don't you listen to me?
Sian!

265
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:04,925
Oh, it's you!
I'm sorry.

266
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:06,324
Once again I've made a mistake.

267
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:09,287
I mistook you for her.

268
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:15,625
So there really is someone named Sian!

269
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,664
Is she the one in the painting?

270
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:20,067
Do you miss her very much?

271
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:23,072
She's already dead and buried.

272
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:25,403
We'll never meet again.

273
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,984
If you want,
you can call me Sian for now.

274
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,612
For now?

275
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:41,286
I understand.
You're betrothed to another.

276
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:44,496
When I knew Sian,

277
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:46,656
she was also betrothed to somebody else.

278
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:48,695
It's beyond my control.

279
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:53,166
Sian said exactly the same thing.

280
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:03,306
You are mortal; she's a ghost

281
00:27:04,518 --> 00:27:05,815
But you're both exactly the same.

282
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:11,588
Are we very much alike?

283
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,357
Too much so.

284
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:16,421
You gave me false hope.

285
00:27:17,865 --> 00:27:19,856
Anyway, false hope is better than none.

286
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,462
Excuse me!

287
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,403
Here's your tea.

288
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,307
Your meal will be served presently.

289
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:33,178
Please make yourselves at home.

290
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:39,849
I've seen that man before.
He's...

291
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:45,459
The tea is poisoned!
This inn is run by thieves!

292
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:46,527
Really!

293
00:27:46,527 --> 00:27:48,028
Is the water boiling?

294
00:27:48,028 --> 00:27:49,296
The blade sharpened?

295
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:50,798
Everything's ready.

296
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:51,866
Put the man in the cauldron immediately.

297
00:27:51,866 --> 00:27:54,460
Save the woman for tonight,
to warm our cold beds.

298
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:56,730
Kill!

299
00:27:57,271 --> 00:27:59,106
Slice them up good!

300
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:05,511
Right on!

301
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:09,675
Stop!

302
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:15,382
Watch where you're stabbing!

303
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:19,922
They escaped through the window.

304
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:34,263
It's dangerous here.
This is no way to escape!

305
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:39,037
Better jump into the tree and hide.

306
00:28:40,948 --> 00:28:43,341
I still haven't recovered.
No energy to jump.

307
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:47,087
Don't worry about me.
Run!

308
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:48,987
No, I won't leave you.

309
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:53,861
This time there's no escape!

310
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:55,529
I never thought we'd die here.

311
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:57,520
Elder, it's our fault for getting you involved.

312
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:00,668
I'm not Elder Chu.

313
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:02,465
I'm just a poor scholar.

314
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:05,105
No matter who you are...

315
00:29:05,105 --> 00:29:07,300
I feel fortunate
to die with the one I love.

316
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:14,007
We'll never be parted again.

317
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:22,887
We'll never be parted again.
Hold me!

318
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:30,219
Let me be on the outside
so that the wolf eats me first.

319
00:29:32,266 --> 00:29:33,255
You're wonderful.

320
00:29:36,737 --> 00:29:37,635
So are you.

321
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:39,802
If we could be like this forever,
it would be great.

322
00:30:13,774 --> 00:30:18,579
Orchid - Monastery!
Orchid Monastery!

323
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:19,671
What's the Orchid Monastery?

324
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:26,020
How could I have forgotten about Yan?

325
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,918
Who is he?

326
00:30:27,454 --> 00:30:29,354
The bearded man in the Orchid Monastery.
A wizard in the occult.

327
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:31,723
If we find him,
we can deal with the High Priest.

328
00:30:44,371 --> 00:30:45,861
Isn't the High Priest
returning to the capital city?

329
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:48,304
Why go to his palace?

330
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:51,907
He needs a tranquil place to meditate.

331
00:30:58,118 --> 00:31:00,609
Only holy people may enter this sacred place.
Stay where you are.

332
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:24,635
This is the hour of the eclipse.

333
00:31:28,982 --> 00:31:33,885
My body is changing against my wish.

334
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:54,299
Why are all the officials
of the imperial court here?

335
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,151
Lord Chiang! Lord Yang! Lord Lee!

336
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:10,591
I was escorting Lord Fu back
to the capital...

337
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:12,882
But couldn't complete my mission.
Allow me to explain

338
00:32:16,063 --> 00:32:18,156
Lord Chiang!

339
00:32:20,868 --> 00:32:21,857
A hollow shell?

340
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:25,861
Lord Yang is a hollow shell, too?

341
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:28,709
What kind of a place is this?
Are you demons?

342
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:31,007
What did you do
with the flesh and blood of these officials?

343
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:38,517
You demons, come out and face me!

344
00:32:43,957 --> 00:32:45,626
What did you do
with the flesh and blood of these officials?

345
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:46,524
What evil intentions do you harbour?

346
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:50,121
Are they all hollow shells?!

347
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:54,196
I'm going to destroy
all of you evil monks.

348
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:03,532
Strange, where have they hidden?

349
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:19,088
Autumn? Moon? Lord Fu?

350
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:22,118
Lord Fu!

351
00:33:24,665 --> 00:33:26,462
What happened?
Where are the others?

352
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:30,037
I was wrong to believe you!
You've caused so much harm!

353
00:33:30,037 --> 00:33:30,938
What other plots do you have
up your sleave?

354
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:33,474
We were tricked.
The High Priest is a demon!

355
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:35,374
He turned many officials
into walking corpses.

356
00:33:36,143 --> 00:33:37,845
We must report this to the emperor.

357
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:39,244
Otherwise,
the kingdom will be beyond redemption.

358
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,482
Oh, he's the one
who instigated this calamity!

359
00:33:41,482 --> 00:33:43,083
No wonder the court is in upheaval.

360
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:44,482
We must hurry to rescue the others.
We can talk later.

361
00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:50,884
Moon!

362
00:33:58,198 --> 00:33:59,290
Autumn!

363
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,270
There are demons in the court,
so I must get involved in affairs of state

364
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,259
Everyone must do his bit.

365
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:07,274
Hurry!
There's danger everywhere.

366
00:34:07,274 --> 00:34:08,366
Let's get past this hurdle first.

367
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:11,345
These demonic monks
have great magical powers.

368
00:34:11,345 --> 00:34:12,937
Once he's awake
we won't be able to escape, so hurry!

369
00:34:14,915 --> 00:34:16,314
Autumn, get out of here!
Don't fight anymore!

370
00:34:18,552 --> 00:34:19,453
This is a scene of desolation.

371
00:34:19,453 --> 00:34:20,750
Lord, ride my horse.

372
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:25,392
More chanting!

373
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:26,689
I'll use my powers
to help you concentrate.

374
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:30,490
Come back, Hu.
You'll never beat him.

375
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:44,598
Put down your butchers' knives.
Bow before Buddha!

376
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:50,308
Hu, don't sacrifice yourself in vain!

377
00:35:51,945 --> 00:35:54,081
I mistakenly trusted these demons
and slaughtered righteous officials.

378
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:56,174
To atone for my sins,
I'll fight him to the death.

379
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,087
Don't!

380
00:36:00,087 --> 00:36:02,078
I'm headed for hell anyway.

381
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,654
Hu!

382
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:13,224
Yan, why does the wind
suddenly blow so violently?

383
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,894
It's hard to tell
which direction is which.

384
00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:17,537
Yan, what should we do?

385
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:20,841
Evil spirits pervade this road.
Our lives hang by a slender thread.

386
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:22,138
We mustn't stop.
Follow me!

387
00:36:31,952 --> 00:36:34,045
Oh, boundless heaven and earth!
Help me!

388
00:36:42,763 --> 00:36:47,063
Recite the scriptures with me!
Prajna paramita...

389
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:52,368
Prajna paramita...

390
00:36:57,544 --> 00:36:58,636
The Diamond Sutra incantation?

391
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:01,005
Prajna paramita...

392
00:37:05,385 --> 00:37:08,183
Ignoramus,
behaving so boorishly in front of me!

393
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:10,319
Prajna paramite...

394
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,162
Ning, Windy... get out of the way!

395
00:37:15,162 --> 00:37:16,652
Oh, boundless heaven and earth.
Help me!

396
00:37:23,336 --> 00:37:27,932
Buddha is present!

397
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:35,682
If you dare to impersonate Buddha,
what would you not dare to do?

398
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:38,879
You think
you can hoodwink the people forever?

399
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:42,551
I'm going to let everyone know
what you really are!

400
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:45,826
The masses love to worship their idols.

401
00:37:45,826 --> 00:37:48,226
Why set yourself against the people?

402
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:52,432
It's their ignorance
that has allowed you to succeed.

403
00:37:52,432 --> 00:37:54,000
I'll never let them worship demons like you.

404
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,796
You'll never decieve the people again!

405
00:37:55,368 --> 00:37:58,769
If you refuse
to follow my shining beacon...

406
00:37:59,206 --> 00:38:00,901
you will be destroyed!

407
00:38:01,808 --> 00:38:06,108
What crap!
Look out!

408
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:13,811
Justine for all!

409
00:38:22,262 --> 00:38:23,354
Swords are part of the infinite!

410
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,972
We've only destroyed the false cuter body.

411
00:38:31,972 --> 00:38:32,973
He can come back and attack us at any time.

412
00:38:32,973 --> 00:38:34,875
We must use our swords to fight back!

413
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,377
Let me introduce myself.
I'm from the Kunlun sect...

414
00:38:37,377 --> 00:38:38,945
At a time like this,
let's not separate into sects.

415
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:41,281
We're all fighting the same enemy.
Destroy this demon!

416
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:42,516
Chant with me!

417
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:51,750
Prajna paramita...

418
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,652
The old demon has stolen into the earth
and broken through our ring of swords.

419
00:39:18,652 --> 00:39:19,987
What should we do?

420
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:21,185
Watch!

421
00:39:23,957 --> 00:39:25,125
What kind of demon?

422
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,217
Come with me!

423
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:34,356
Hold on to me as I fly.

424
00:39:36,603 --> 00:39:37,892
Ning!

425
00:39:38,438 --> 00:39:39,632
You pulled my sleave off.

426
00:39:46,046 --> 00:39:47,138
What are you coming back for

427
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:50,572
What happened?

428
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:52,781
Gone?

429
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:15,730
Be careful!

430
00:40:24,084 --> 00:40:26,075
Moon, look after your father.
I'll help Yan.

431
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:28,150
Autumn, be careful!

432
00:40:29,322 --> 00:40:30,457
The demon's actually a giant centipede!

433
00:40:30,457 --> 00:40:33,360
That worm can never be a dragon.

434
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,258
Elder!

435
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:45,605
I've never had to deal
with such a giant creature.

436
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:46,573
What should we do now?

437
00:40:46,573 --> 00:40:48,165
Pierce the crown of its head

438
00:40:58,118 --> 00:40:59,016
Ning!

439
00:41:09,462 --> 00:41:10,451
Windy!

440
00:41:18,638 --> 00:41:20,435
The flying sword!

441
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,474
Prajna paramita!

442
00:42:04,484 --> 00:42:05,576
Exercise the demons!

443
00:42:09,923 --> 00:42:11,914
Oh, boundless heaven and earth.
Help me!

444
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:21,835
Elder!

445
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:22,733
Autumn!

446
00:42:24,571 --> 00:42:26,139
Two heads are better than one.

447
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:28,130
Abracadabra.
Hocus pocus.

448
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:37,339
Hocus pocus.

449
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,385
I've been in the Orchid Monastery for so long...

450
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:15,688
I didn't know
the world was so full of devils and demons

451
00:43:15,688 --> 00:43:17,257
It's hard to separate the living from the dead.

452
00:43:17,257 --> 00:43:19,054
The world is in chaos.

453
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,461
It's a good thing
you hid in the Orchid Monastery.

454
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:23,361
Otherwise I might never have found you.

455
00:43:24,264 --> 00:43:25,598
We share the same ideals...

456
00:43:25,598 --> 00:43:27,801
We should roam this world together
and fight for justice.

457
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:28,790
We should work together.

458
00:43:29,402 --> 00:43:30,670
What are you saying?

459
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,572
I've always led a solitary existence.

460
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:35,642
Last time, I almost died
trying to help you save Sian

461
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:37,644
This time, I've helped you
battle the demons...

462
00:43:37,644 --> 00:43:38,511
and almost lost my life.

463
00:43:38,511 --> 00:43:39,913
It's better if we go our own ways.

464
00:43:39,913 --> 00:43:42,211
When you need my help,
I'll return and save you.

465
00:43:58,164 --> 00:43:59,563
Be careful, Autumn!

466
00:44:19,085 --> 00:44:21,485
We're locked in.
We must think of a way to escape.

467
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:25,521
You're right!
I've really caused you harm.

468
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,731
Our bodies are restrained.
We can be saved only if our souls can escape.

469
00:44:34,267 --> 00:44:35,635
Souls?

470
00:44:35,635 --> 00:44:38,934
Will we have enough energy
to later let the souls back in?

471
00:44:39,873 --> 00:44:41,341
This is the only way!

472
00:44:41,341 --> 00:44:43,138
Chant along with me.

473
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:52,110
The spirit of Buddha conquers all!

474
00:44:53,386 --> 00:45:00,383
Goodness is indestructible.

475
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:11,835
Oh, boundless heaven and earth.
Help me!

476
00:45:13,473 --> 00:45:16,374
Help me!
Hocus pocus!

477
00:45:43,002 --> 00:45:44,299
Autumn!

478
00:45:49,008 --> 00:45:50,600
- Yan!
- Autumn!

479
00:45:51,778 --> 00:45:52,870
Yan!

480
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,473
Soul, return!

481
00:46:00,486 --> 00:46:01,578
My soul can't return to my body!

482
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:04,514
Autumn, catch the soul!

483
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:13,066
His power isn't strong enough.
I'll help him.

484
00:46:13,066 --> 00:46:14,556
Prajna paramita...

485
00:46:16,302 --> 00:46:17,599
I can't catch it.

486
00:46:18,404 --> 00:46:19,496
Moon!

487
00:48:02,742 --> 00:48:03,731
What's all the hubbub outside

488
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,407
What hubbub?
I don't hear anything!

489
00:48:23,629 --> 00:48:25,829
Who's getting married?
Such a large golden pig!

490
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:29,560
It's a gift to Lord Fu from the emperor.

491
00:48:31,304 --> 00:48:33,573
Since he exposed the traitors
in the imperial court,

492
00:48:33,573 --> 00:48:34,907
he performed a great service for the emperor.

493
00:48:34,907 --> 00:48:37,398
It's a wedding gift for Lord Fu's daughter.

494
00:48:41,147 --> 00:48:42,546
Moon!

495
00:48:43,483 --> 00:48:44,973
Moon!

496
00:48:45,952 --> 00:48:47,249
Ning!

497
00:48:53,793 --> 00:48:55,192
Is Windy getting...

498
00:48:55,695 --> 00:48:57,063
Sister is already married.

499
00:48:57,063 --> 00:48:58,553
Don't cause her any trouble.

500
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,001
I'm about to start on a journey.

501
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:04,799
Give her my best wishes
for a happy marriage.

502
00:49:08,207 --> 00:49:10,698
I will.
Take care of yourself.

503
00:49:21,721 --> 00:49:22,813
Adieu!

504
00:49:37,703 --> 00:49:39,796
It's hard to differentiate
between true and false hopes

505
00:49:40,339 --> 00:49:43,631
Now I understand
why you stay away from our mortal world.

506
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:47,547
Mortals are forgetful.
Good deeds fade like the wind.

507
00:49:47,547 --> 00:49:50,141
No matter what you've done,
it's soon forgotten.

508
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:53,386
Is forgetting good or bad?

509
00:49:53,386 --> 00:49:55,081
Should we have hopes?

510
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:10,424
You said you'd cherish no hopes!

511
00:50:11,103 --> 00:50:13,200
Sister, don't hesitate!
Go to him!

512
00:50:21,113 --> 00:50:21,714
Windy?!

513
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:22,912
Ning!

514
00:50:23,616 --> 00:50:26,016
Let's go, hurry!

515
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,521
You go back.

516
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:30,819
- Farewell!
- Take care!

517
00:50:32,124 --> 00:50:33,113
Let's go!

518
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:42,862
The path of life

519
00:50:43,436 --> 00:50:46,928
Are dreams, like the length of the path

520
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,710
The storm on the way

521
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:54,612
Pass by as you go along

522
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:58,885
In the world

523
00:50:58,885 --> 00:51:02,377
How many ways can one dream?

524
00:51:03,122 --> 00:51:07,718
Looking for dream-like love

525
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:11,927
And the path goes on

526
00:51:13,232 --> 00:51:16,402
Life is what

527
00:51:16,402 --> 00:51:19,803
Dreams and desires are made of

528
00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:23,676
Somewhere in the dream

529
00:51:23,676 --> 00:51:28,079
There are traces of tears

530
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:31,918
Where to go to?

531
00:51:31,918 --> 00:51:35,410
To find where my heart wants to go

532
00:51:36,055 --> 00:51:41,060
The wind seems to sign in the dream,

533
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:45,053
and the path and I go on.

534
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:53,272
The path of living

535
00:51:53,272 --> 00:51:56,571
The happiness of youth

536
00:51:57,543 --> 00:52:00,034
The path is full of difficulties

537
00:52:00,513 --> 00:52:04,210
That no light can be seen

538
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:08,688
In the dust,

539
00:52:08,688 --> 00:52:12,283
how many ways can one find happiness

540
00:52:12,892 --> 00:52:17,488
The wind and rain pass like a dream,

541
00:52:17,964 --> 00:52:22,765
and the path goes on.
