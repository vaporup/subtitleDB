1
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:28,835
Son of a bitch!

2
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:32,443
When l first saw you, l wasn`t scared.

3
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:35,106
Just wondered why
you wore those boots.

4
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:36,445
Now l know.

5
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,452
We`ve both played this game, Rath.

6
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:16,887
What kind of shoes will you wear...

7
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,755
...when your day comes?

8
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:22,693
l`ll double the contract.

9
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:24,560
Say you couldn`t find me.

10
00:03:29,372 --> 00:03:30,703
Listen to me.

11
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:32,670
l`m talking like a mark!

12
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:48,183
Don`t pull yet.

13
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:49,586
Not yet.

14
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:54,026
l`ve killed a few innocents in my time.

15
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:58,292
You`re so high and mighty!
You and your principles!

16
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:02,065
Someone had to do the
jobs you wouldn`t do.

17
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,108
l can`t die like this!

18
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,302
l`m not a mark.

19
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:11,871
Not like a mark.

20
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,630
lt`s chambered.

21
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:40,900
Thanks, Rath.

22
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,908
My old friend.

23
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:39,812
l don`t care what you believe.
l`ve had it.

24
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:42,013
l want out. l quit.

25
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:49,028
Go away, you son of a bitch.

26
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,132
You should be.

27
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,987
The attention is not for the man being
buried, but for one of the mourners.

28
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:22,985
Just arriving is reclusive
billionaire Alan Branch...

29
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:26,890
...attending the funeral of his brother,
who died in an auto accident.

30
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:31,056
Branch was last seen testifying
before the Senate 10 years ago...

31
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,861
...for his alleged financing of...

32
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:37,528
...right wing death squads throughout
South and Central America.

33
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:40,642
Branch was born in Queens,
New York, and, as you can see...

34
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:43,870
...from the wheelchair, the
victim of a hit man`s bullet.

35
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:48,881
10 years ago Alan Branch was brought
before the Senate and questioned...

36
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:52,418
...about his alleged involvement in
money-laundering, drug-trafficking...

37
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:54,522
...and death squad-financing.

38
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:52,245
Let us pray.

39
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:55,006
Lord Jesus Christ...

40
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,014
...by the 3 days you lay in the tomb...

41
00:10:57,753 --> 00:11:00,813
...you made holy the graves
of all who believe in you.

42
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,222
Though their bodies lie in the earth,
they trust that they will rise again.

43
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,830
Bless this grave, Lord, and
give Samuel peaceful rest....

44
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:26,611
My God!

45
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:29,944
He`s been shot!

46
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:21,601
Come on, you little bastard, be brave.

47
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:22,930
Run for it.

48
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:40,856
Put it down!

49
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:43,589
Fuck.

50
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,556
Throw the gun away!

51
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:47,759
On the ground!

52
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,760
Face down!

53
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:49,929
All right!

54
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:51,430
Throw it away!

55
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:56,627
Don`t move!

56
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:00,538
Hands behind your back!

57
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:02,405
What`s he doing?

58
00:13:05,948 --> 00:13:08,041
Check him for more weapons.

59
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:08,945
Where is it?

60
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:11,479
- Don`t worry.
- l`m not worried.

61
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:12,484
There.

62
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,284
The area`s secure.

63
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:26,863
Nice to meet you.

64
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:09,907
Wait. Ambulance, let`s go!

65
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:15,713
Hold it!

66
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,647
#1, move it out!

67
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:20,448
#2, come on!

68
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,017
Get out of here!

69
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:58,157
What is the disposition of your suspect?

70
00:14:58,894 --> 00:14:59,986
1 Bravo 5.

71
00:15:00,162 --> 00:15:02,323
We`re proceeding to the precinct...

72
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:03,726
...suspect in custody.

73
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:07,832
Roger. l show you en route to
the precinct with one suspect.

74
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:11,734
Look.

75
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:13,397
Watch it.

76
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:31,859
Look out!

77
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:06,019
Don`t fucking try it!

78
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:12,063
Officers down.

79
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:14,293
Victoria Ave. 2700 block.

80
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:20,397
Repeat...

81
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:21,634
...officers down.

82
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:34,653
1 Bravo 3, what`s your status?

83
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:46,433
1 Bravo 3, please respond.

84
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:18,524
Repeat, officers down.

85
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:42,984
All units, suspect in the four-officer-
down call is still at large.

86
00:17:43,158 --> 00:17:45,820
Male Hispanic, thirty years,
armed and dangerous.

87
00:17:45,994 --> 00:17:48,394
Monitor all bus stations
and the airport.

88
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:06,946
Goddamn it!

89
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:08,277
You okay?

90
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,281
l just got this car!

91
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:12,283
l`m sorry. Are you okay?

92
00:18:12,454 --> 00:18:15,389
What`s it going to take?
l don`t have insurance.

93
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:16,785
Take it.

94
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:18,154
l`m sorry.

95
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:34,465
Who`s near Denny Way and 5th?
We have a couple going to Crown Hill.

96
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:38,478
Who`s near Christina`s?
We have a man going to the airport.

97
00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:41,305
501, l`m there.

98
00:18:53,962 --> 00:18:56,226
Come on. Be the right one.

99
00:19:06,341 --> 00:19:07,603
Taxi!

100
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:09,574
l`m booked.

101
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:11,507
We saw it first!

102
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:14,107
Airport.

103
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,773
You got it.

104
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:24,854
You got a cut on your head.
You see that?

105
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:29,220
l had an accident at work.

106
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:30,797
What do you do?

107
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:34,130
l am, how do you say...

108
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:35,861
...dead tired.

109
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:38,866
So, save the chitchat for someone else.

110
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:44,478
Chitchat. l haven`t heard
that word for a long time.

111
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:04,059
What`re you doing?

112
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,826
There was a turnoff.

113
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:06,990
l`m sorry.

114
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:09,565
You blew your tip.

115
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:11,068
Think l`m trying to run you up?

116
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:12,570
Just do your job.

117
00:20:12,774 --> 00:20:15,174
l never ran up a fare in my life!

118
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:16,777
Do your job!

119
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:23,278
Get out.

120
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:28,187
You think l`m running you up?
Just get out.

121
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,091
You can`t just....

122
00:20:31,426 --> 00:20:33,189
The hell l can`t.

123
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:34,692
Out.

124
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,293
Find another cab.

125
00:20:40,035 --> 00:20:42,094
l don`t believe this.

126
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:55,872
Robert...

127
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:57,110
...Rath.

128
00:21:01,123 --> 00:21:03,887
You can`t shoot me through the glass.

129
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:07,326
Bulletproof.

130
00:21:08,463 --> 00:21:09,828
So, l get out...

131
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:12,129
...you got me.

132
00:21:15,837 --> 00:21:16,963
So...

133
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,329
...now what?

134
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:21,068
Who are you?

135
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:25,073
Robert Rath...

136
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:26,974
...wants to know me.

137
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:30,474
l don`t believe this.

138
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:32,914
Bain.

139
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:35,350
Miguel Bain.

140
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:40,757
Let me see. You rolled some cabbie...

141
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:43,428
...then waited for the right call.

142
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:45,989
That`s genius.

143
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:49,865
Then you got the balls
to bullshit with me.

144
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:52,269
No way l could have done that.

145
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:54,598
You stole my contract.

146
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,872
How`d you know of it?

147
00:21:57,512 --> 00:21:59,104
A silenced...

148
00:21:59,281 --> 00:22:00,771
...Ruger .22.

149
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:04,283
Classic.

150
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:08,887
You know, l switched...

151
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:10,889
...when l heard you used one.

152
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:15,621
Excuse this.

153
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:18,029
lt was a long shot.

154
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,389
But a good one.

155
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:21,127
Wasn`t it?

156
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:24,533
Who`s your contractor?

157
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,403
Why don`t you drive?

158
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:31,139
We can get acquainted.

159
00:22:32,547 --> 00:22:33,639
Chitchat.

160
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:36,809
Let`s sit.

161
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:38,541
Okay?

162
00:22:58,573 --> 00:22:59,562
Drive.

163
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,240
Number 13 looks tired.

164
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,570
Maybe she needs rest.

165
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,179
Drive.

166
00:23:10,952 --> 00:23:12,180
Drive.

167
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:13,685
Drive.

168
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:37,709
Protect the innocent.

169
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:39,210
That`s weak.

170
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:43,615
You could`ve had me at the cemetery
but you couldn`t shoot the cops.

171
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:45,218
You are anticuado.

172
00:23:53,895 --> 00:23:58,127
l had to try! Who knows?
Maybe it wasn`t made in America!

173
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:10,507
They look pissed, huh?

174
00:24:11,012 --> 00:24:13,640
They get that way when
you kill 4 of them.

175
00:24:14,516 --> 00:24:16,313
How do you like the cemetery?

176
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:20,748
Rome, 14 B.C.

177
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:25,082
They killed a general, Flavius,
at his brother`s funeral.

178
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:29,827
l couldn`t wait for Branch`s
brother to die, so l killed him too.

179
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:32,129
Proud of me, Bobby?

180
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:35,660
Well....

181
00:24:36,838 --> 00:24:39,033
lt was nice meeting you.

182
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:44,043
Someday, l`ll tell my little niños
about this wonderful encounter.

183
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:12,869
Shit!

184
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,529
Who`s your contractor, kid?

185
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:53,040
You blew it!

186
00:25:53,214 --> 00:25:55,205

What is he talking about,
''Bishop takes rook pawn?''

232
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:26,518
15 years, and l still

265
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,352
- You never have time to talk about it!
- That is not true!

266
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,361
But now is not a good time!

Don`t walk away, because

You`re not helping matters here.
You`re not.

367
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:49,301
This is not my beeper.

368
00:47:18,432 --> 00:47:19,763
lnterpol.

369
00:47:21,668 --> 00:47:23,158
What`s going on?

370
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,662
Hello? Can you hear me?

371
00:47:28,675 --> 00:47:32,771
Hans Brinker, Mr. Dutchman, talk to me.
l`m not kidding.

372
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,011
Hello?

373
00:47:35,182 --> 00:47:37,275
Complete the transmission.

374
00:47:39,786 --> 00:47:41,014
Who is this?

375
00:47:45,025 --> 00:47:46,356
Who is this?

376
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,292
Please complete the transmission.

377
00:47:49,463 --> 00:47:50,953
Shit!

378
00:47:55,802 --> 00:47:57,292
No, wait.

379
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:03,801
Fuck.

380
00:48:06,046 --> 00:48:07,138
Honey...

381
00:48:07,648 --> 00:48:09,582
...l`ll tear your heart out.

382
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,040
Holy Mary.

383
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:21,723
Let`s get you your case.

384
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:27,857
Don`t do this to me.
We must go. Come on.

385
00:48:31,905 --> 00:48:34,897
Pearl, come on. Come on, please.
Don`t do this.

386
00:48:40,013 --> 00:48:41,571
Come on.

387
00:48:55,128 --> 00:48:55,890
Don`t!

388
00:48:57,497 --> 00:48:58,225
Don`t?

389
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:02,228
Don`t what?

390
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:07,737
Rath...

391
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:12,636
...is that you?

392
00:49:15,515 --> 00:49:16,413
The disk.

393
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:19,584
lt`s you.

394
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:21,315
lt`s you.

395
00:49:21,388 --> 00:49:22,252
Disk.

396
00:49:22,823 --> 00:49:24,313
You tried the move.

397
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:27,416
Bishop takes rook pawn.

398
00:49:27,594 --> 00:49:29,653
lt`s a powerful move.

399
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:33,593
Would have been Nicolai`s move.
Don`t you think?

400
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:36,101
You got a move for me?

401
00:49:37,604 --> 00:49:39,834
You know, it`s like chess.

402
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,835
ls she alive?

403
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:44,601
Did you kill her?

404
00:49:46,613 --> 00:49:48,672
Did you kill my mark?

405
00:49:51,785 --> 00:49:53,116
Are you there?

406
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,952
542.

407
00:49:59,626 --> 00:50:01,457
ls she dead yet?

408
00:50:02,863 --> 00:50:06,128
l took care of business
on my end. Did you?

409
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:18,470
A woman. lt`s not the
same as killing a man.

410
00:50:18,645 --> 00:50:21,705
You have to pull the
trigger a different way.

411
00:50:23,483 --> 00:50:25,314
ls she beautiful?

412
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:32,990
Pull the trigger. Kill her.

413
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,321
Come on. Do it. Do it.

414
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:37,160
Pull the trigger.

415
00:50:43,236 --> 00:50:46,603
Pull the trigger. Kill her.
Be professional.

416
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,832
Kill her.

417
00:51:01,421 --> 00:51:03,013
lt`s my beeper.

418
00:51:33,453 --> 00:51:34,442
Go on.

419
00:51:34,888 --> 00:51:37,379
- Where`s your car?
- l don`t remember where it`s parked.

420
00:51:37,557 --> 00:51:39,718
l got your car right here.

421
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:53,729
That`s all right. l got it.

422
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:17,091
Who are you?

423
00:52:17,697 --> 00:52:18,823
A government employee.

424
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:20,088
Bullshit.

425
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:21,598
Just drive and don`t speed.

426
00:52:21,768 --> 00:52:22,496
Where?

427
00:52:22,702 --> 00:52:25,102
You`ll know when we get there.

428
00:52:42,956 --> 00:52:43,718
Slow down.

429
00:52:43,857 --> 00:52:45,848
l can`t, l`m too nervous.

430
00:52:46,026 --> 00:52:46,856
Slow down.

431
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:51,628
This other guy, does he work
for the government too?

432
00:52:52,365 --> 00:52:54,458
lt`s between you and him, right?

433
00:52:54,634 --> 00:52:56,465
Just leave me out of it.

434
00:52:57,737 --> 00:52:58,635
We can`t.

435
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,639
You`re the mark.

436
00:53:35,842 --> 00:53:37,173
Take it easy!

437
00:53:39,346 --> 00:53:41,007
My cat!

438
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:08,433
Damn!

439
00:54:42,075 --> 00:54:46,739
Pearl, come out, don`t be afraid.
Why are you here? How are you?

440
00:54:47,981 --> 00:54:48,913
Where`s her mama?

441
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:51,975
l was going to ask you that.

442
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:05,089
Thank you, pussycat.

443
00:55:07,367 --> 00:55:08,857
Cold.

444
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,429
Cold.

445
00:55:19,112 --> 00:55:20,443
Hot.

446
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:24,943
So that`s where you live.

447
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:40,698
l really love you.

448
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:41,723
l love you.

449
00:55:55,148 --> 00:55:56,137
Baby!

450
00:56:06,993 --> 00:56:07,823
Where is he?

451
00:56:07,994 --> 00:56:09,484
You sick bitch.

452
00:56:09,662 --> 00:56:10,720
Downstairs.

453
00:56:13,733 --> 00:56:15,428
Do you want to live?

454
00:56:45,598 --> 00:56:47,361
Give me your house keys.

455
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:52,027
Meet me at the pet shop.

456
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:44,818
Blank. Shit.

457
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:49,653
Blank.

458
00:57:54,334 --> 00:57:55,767
Jennifer, wait!

459
00:57:59,606 --> 00:58:01,437
Come on! Move it!

460
00:58:46,486 --> 00:58:48,386
l`m sorry!

461
00:59:02,402 --> 00:59:03,391
Jasmine.

462
00:59:34,033 --> 00:59:35,694
Your gun is slow!

463
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:40,762
l`m not the one shooting at mirrors.

464
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,271
Who do you think--

465
00:59:42,442 --> 00:59:43,875
Surprise.

466
00:59:44,043 --> 00:59:44,702
The disk.

467
00:59:46,045 --> 00:59:46,875
The disk!

468
00:59:48,047 --> 00:59:49,537
Wait, wait!

469
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,221
l said to wait. Shut up!

470
01:00:11,671 --> 01:00:12,569
Disk.

471
01:00:13,072 --> 01:00:14,061
Get out.

472
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:22,078
l got the buyers.

473
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:24,739
Now, l beat you to the mark.

474
01:00:26,185 --> 01:00:27,584
l`m sorry...

475
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:30,689
...but l think l picked the
wrong guy to be my hero.

476
01:00:34,327 --> 01:00:36,192
Macho. Macho.

477
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:40,091
You know...

478
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,758
...it`s my birthday.

479
01:00:43,102 --> 01:00:44,000
Today...

480
01:00:44,203 --> 01:00:46,194
...l become number one.

481
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:49,702
And l got a present....

482
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:04,286
Fuck!

483
01:01:04,524 --> 01:01:06,719
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

484
01:01:33,252 --> 01:01:34,241
Happy birthday.

485
01:02:28,808 --> 01:02:30,605
Goddamn it.

486
01:02:35,715 --> 01:02:38,878
The girl from downstairs,
l saw her come back here.

487
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:43,954
She`s not in her apartment. She could
be here somewhere. l must find her.

488
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:47,615
She`s dead.

489
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:25,256
Come here.

490
01:03:26,999 --> 01:03:28,762
Get back here.

491
01:03:30,002 --> 01:03:31,264
Come here, girl.

492
01:03:31,504 --> 01:03:32,368
She likes me.

493
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:34,600
She likes dead fish too.

494
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:38,602
What`s your name?

495
01:03:40,379 --> 01:03:41,277
Robert Rath.

496
01:03:42,782 --> 01:03:43,771
Right.

497
01:03:45,184 --> 01:03:46,173
l`m Electra.

498
01:03:50,022 --> 01:03:51,683
Are you one of them?

499
01:03:54,794 --> 01:03:56,284
Was.

500
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:58,189
Retired.

501
01:04:00,032 --> 01:04:01,966
l don`t believe you.

502
01:04:04,704 --> 01:04:05,898
l told you...

503
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:08,630
...if l wanted to kill you...

504
01:04:08,808 --> 01:04:10,207
...l would have already.

505
01:04:18,317 --> 01:04:19,409
Look what she did.

506
01:04:20,419 --> 01:04:21,545
lt`s not loaded?

507
01:04:26,225 --> 01:04:27,920
lt`s loaded. lt`s silenced.

508
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:30,989
Just shoot.

509
01:04:32,932 --> 01:04:34,229
l could.

510
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,060
l`d be 500 miles away
before they found you.

511
01:04:37,937 --> 01:04:39,234
How`s that?

512
01:04:46,012 --> 01:04:47,502
Stop! She doesn`t like it!

513
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:51,948
l say she`s afraid she might hit you.

514
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:00,083
Sorry l have the gun?

515
01:05:00,259 --> 01:05:03,456
You think it was a mistake?
You think l`m scared?

516
01:05:05,765 --> 01:05:07,027
You don`t know me!

517
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:08,763
Shut up!

518
01:05:11,704 --> 01:05:14,036
Today was supposed to be a good day.

519
01:05:14,206 --> 01:05:15,468
Payday.

520
01:05:15,608 --> 01:05:18,873
40 grand. l was going to
buy Pearl a boyfriend.

521
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,711
Now two people are dead.

522
01:05:24,984 --> 01:05:26,884
l`m in way over my head.

523
01:05:28,054 --> 01:05:29,487
l just want out.

524
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:33,285
You got the gun.
The key`s on the dresser.

525
01:05:33,492 --> 01:05:34,481
Go.

526
01:05:35,995 --> 01:05:39,294
l don`t have a social security
number, or a driver`s license.

527
01:05:39,498 --> 01:05:41,989
l barely remember my real name.

528
01:05:42,735 --> 01:05:44,794
l`m a ghost. l`m nobody.

529
01:05:45,004 --> 01:05:46,130
l`ll disappear.

530
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,131
l found you. So did he.
You can`t hide.

531
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,642
l just want my life back.

532
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:55,636
That`s all.

533
01:06:03,422 --> 01:06:04,252
l`m sorry.

534
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:21,671
l`ll take that.

535
01:06:27,546 --> 01:06:29,104
l need to be alone.

536
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:34,048
l haven`t spent this much
time with someone in years.

537
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:47,622
Neither have l.

538
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,665
Well, the disk....

539
01:07:41,754 --> 01:07:43,619
You`ll get it.

540
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:08,205
Fuck you.

541
01:08:17,156 --> 01:08:19,215
l don`t care what you are.

542
01:08:25,664 --> 01:08:27,063
Fuck you!

543
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,980
Then who the hell`s Miguel Bain?

544
01:09:06,272 --> 01:09:08,433
Who the hell is Miguel Bain?

545
01:09:09,108 --> 01:09:10,598
Christ.

546
01:09:31,997 --> 01:09:34,261
What`d they say about the shooting?

547
01:09:34,433 --> 01:09:35,331
Nothing.

548
01:09:35,668 --> 01:09:38,000
l don`t need details, just in general.

549
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:39,831
- Nothing.
- lmpossible.

550
01:09:40,005 --> 01:09:41,267
Not really. Not if....

551
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,602
lf what?

552
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:45,509
The ClA or lnterpol....

553
01:09:49,448 --> 01:09:50,437
What`s on this?

554
01:09:52,017 --> 01:09:53,348
lt`s encrypted.

555
01:09:53,519 --> 01:09:57,285
Breaking the code on my lap top
could take 200 or 300 years.

556
01:09:57,957 --> 01:09:59,185
Aren`t you a genius?

557
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:00,781
l am.

558
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,690
l was the best. lf it was stored
electronically, it was mine.

559
01:10:03,862 --> 01:10:04,851
Was?

560
01:10:06,365 --> 01:10:08,356
Yeah, l`m retiring too.

561
01:10:10,202 --> 01:10:11,965
l wish l had an insight...

562
01:10:12,137 --> 01:10:15,368
...but it was anonymous, an
intercepted satellite transmission.

563
01:10:15,975 --> 01:10:18,637
Probably just industrial secrets.

564
01:10:22,715 --> 01:10:24,205
There`s one bed.

565
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,484
l guess you noticed that.

566
01:10:26,652 --> 01:10:28,210
- lt`s yours.
- You want the couch?

567
01:10:28,387 --> 01:10:29,479
No, thanks.

568
01:10:36,161 --> 01:10:38,322
A trick so you don`t get comfortable?

569
01:10:41,233 --> 01:10:43,724
Tie a string from your
toe to the doorknob.

570
01:10:44,336 --> 01:10:45,826
lt opens in.

571
01:10:51,343 --> 01:10:52,571
You wouldn`t feel it.

572
01:10:52,745 --> 01:10:55,077
Yeah, l got it. l understand.

573
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:48,627
Thanks.

574
01:11:49,735 --> 01:11:50,895
For what?

575
01:11:51,637 --> 01:11:52,899
l don`t know.

576
01:11:53,806 --> 01:11:55,740
Saving my life, l guess.

577
01:12:02,081 --> 01:12:04,242
How`d you like to make $1 million?

578
01:12:04,917 --> 01:12:06,578
What do l have to do?

579
01:12:09,488 --> 01:12:11,149
Nothing cheap, l hope.

580
01:12:13,158 --> 01:12:14,420
What is it?

581
01:12:14,593 --> 01:12:15,753
Tell you tomorrow.

582
01:12:15,928 --> 01:12:17,259
l can`t sleep.

583
01:12:17,429 --> 01:12:18,327
Be patient.

584
01:12:18,497 --> 01:12:19,930
What? Tell me.

585
01:12:21,433 --> 01:12:22,923
Thanks for the chocolate.

586
01:12:25,437 --> 01:12:26,495
Good night.

587
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:49,859
Forget something?

588
01:12:59,805 --> 01:13:01,204
You be careful.

589
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,664
l`m right here.

590
01:15:42,367 --> 01:15:43,800
What`s going on?!

591
01:15:43,969 --> 01:15:45,368
l`ll move!

592
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:17,228
l hate that music.

593
01:16:17,402 --> 01:16:19,063
Let`s go.

594
01:16:22,507 --> 01:16:24,236
Got it? ls it all there?

595
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:28,174
What`re you doing?

596
01:16:28,347 --> 01:16:29,075
Drive!

597
01:16:29,748 --> 01:16:31,181
Drive, fast!

598
01:16:32,017 --> 01:16:33,575
l mean, fast!

599
01:16:36,922 --> 01:16:38,355
Get off this street!

600
01:16:43,362 --> 01:16:44,590
Stop!

601
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:49,265
Hit it!

602
01:17:08,053 --> 01:17:10,044
No money, no disk.

603
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:14,887
What`s so funny?

604
01:17:16,294 --> 01:17:19,388
l wasn`t sure you`d come back
so l switched the disks.

605
01:17:19,564 --> 01:17:21,794
And all they have is file names.

606
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:23,901
- No, you didn`t.
- Yes, l did.

607
01:17:24,403 --> 01:17:27,634
And they got bubkes. Zero, zilch...

608
01:17:27,806 --> 01:17:30,639
...zot, nix, nada, dry hump, squirt...

609
01:17:30,809 --> 01:17:31,901
...diddley-squat.

610
01:17:32,911 --> 01:17:35,141
l read a slang dictionary once.

611
01:17:40,485 --> 01:17:41,645
Keep reading.

612
01:17:44,656 --> 01:17:46,920
Contractor tried to kill you.

613
01:17:47,325 --> 01:17:49,156
That`s not good.

614
01:17:59,271 --> 01:18:00,761
l have caviar for you.

615
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:03,100
Come here.

616
01:18:04,009 --> 01:18:05,499
Good girl.

617
01:18:07,012 --> 01:18:09,503
Caviar is not a Russian word.

618
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:12,275
lkra. l think the word is ikra.

619
01:18:14,619 --> 01:18:15,677
How do you know?

620
01:18:15,954 --> 01:18:18,013
l had a Russian friend. He told me.

621
01:18:20,025 --> 01:18:21,356
Had a friend?

622
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:26,453
About 15 years ago he was taken.

623
01:18:29,201 --> 01:18:30,293
He was killed?

624
01:18:42,881 --> 01:18:45,315
Yes, l`m still alive, you bastard.

625
01:18:57,062 --> 01:18:58,324
Not this time.

626
01:18:59,664 --> 01:19:02,064
Let`s see how valuable
he thinks this is.

627
01:19:04,669 --> 01:19:05,897
$3 million?

628
01:19:06,338 --> 01:19:06,997
Four?

629
01:19:09,908 --> 01:19:11,000
More.

630
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,581
$20 fucking million?

631
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:30,919
Where do you suppose this
person is right now?

632
01:19:31,596 --> 01:19:32,756
A mile away?

633
01:19:32,931 --> 01:19:34,592
1,000 miles from here?

634
01:19:36,935 --> 01:19:38,926
Never thought about it till now.

635
01:19:39,704 --> 01:19:42,935
You quit your job, you have
thoughts you never had before.

636
01:19:43,108 --> 01:19:45,440
Sounds like a mid-life crisis.

637
01:19:50,115 --> 01:19:51,377
You`re right.

638
01:20:14,072 --> 01:20:16,302
Twenty million dollars.

639
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:26,139
We`re partners?

640
01:20:37,762 --> 01:20:39,252
That`s $10 million apiece.

641
01:20:39,431 --> 01:20:40,989
8. The bank keeps 20°.

642
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:42,497
l thought l was a thief.

643
01:20:44,669 --> 01:20:45,601
Passport?

644
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:47,601
12. Where to?

645
01:20:48,006 --> 01:20:49,439
To the bank.

646
01:22:09,187 --> 01:22:10,916
What happened to the hotel?

647
01:22:11,089 --> 01:22:14,252
They had a fire years ago.
Nobody had money to fix it.

648
01:22:16,027 --> 01:22:17,255
Wait here.

649
01:22:20,198 --> 01:22:22,598
Keep the air on and watch my cat.

650
01:22:22,767 --> 01:22:23,927
You got it.

651
01:22:30,442 --> 01:22:32,034
ls that our bank?

652
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:33,700
Where our money is?

653
01:22:38,616 --> 01:22:39,947
What`s up there?

654
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:41,107
He`ll be.

655
01:23:27,332 --> 01:23:28,663
Hug the wall.

656
01:23:28,867 --> 01:23:29,959
Careful.

657
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:31,693
Go light.

658
01:24:43,141 --> 01:24:43,937
You okay?

659
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:53,040
Ten o`clock tomorrow morning,
l`m going in that bank.

660
01:24:54,152 --> 01:24:56,950
He`ll be in the plaza
somewhere, in the crowd.

661
01:24:57,455 --> 01:25:00,549
When he sees me go in,
he`ll make his move up here.

662
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:03,150
You`ll be in the café over there.

663
01:25:03,294 --> 01:25:05,285
You`ll see him when he goes inside.

664
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:07,664
Then we wait.

665
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,560
We wait.

666
01:25:11,469 --> 01:25:13,960
Tomorrow will be a long day for him.

667
01:25:14,672 --> 01:25:18,233
He`ll begin to doubt himself.
He`ll think he missed me.

668
01:25:18,977 --> 01:25:22,413
He`ll want to see whether
l`m still in the bank.

669
01:25:23,815 --> 01:25:25,476
Then it`ll be sunset...

670
01:25:26,317 --> 01:25:27,807
...closing time.

671
01:25:29,988 --> 01:25:31,478
He`ll get desperate...

672
01:25:31,689 --> 01:25:32,986
...real desperate...

673
01:25:34,092 --> 01:25:35,753
...but he must leave his rifle...

674
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:38,695
...inside.

675
01:25:38,963 --> 01:25:40,453
He`s right-handed.

676
01:25:41,232 --> 01:25:44,224
He won`t take a pistol because
the doors have metal detectors...

677
01:25:44,402 --> 01:25:46,131
...and he`ll be nervous.

678
01:25:50,241 --> 01:25:51,902
When he`s out of sight...

679
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:53,902
...you come get the rifle.

680
01:25:54,078 --> 01:25:56,410
He`ll shoot you before you go in.

681
01:25:59,918 --> 01:26:01,647
He`ll wait for the prime shot.

682
01:26:04,822 --> 01:26:05,982
When l come out.

683
01:26:08,927 --> 01:26:10,417
He`ll want to see my eyes.

684
01:26:18,336 --> 01:26:19,769
Why`re you so sure?

685
01:26:23,508 --> 01:26:25,100
He loves history.

686
01:26:26,778 --> 01:26:28,609
15 years ago...

687
01:26:29,447 --> 01:26:31,108
...in this room...

688
01:26:33,117 --> 01:26:34,846
...in this same window...

689
01:26:36,287 --> 01:26:37,345
...l was here.

690
01:26:42,694 --> 01:26:44,184
Oh, my God.

691
01:26:46,464 --> 01:26:48,955
Your friend, Nicolai. He was taken.

692
01:26:53,304 --> 01:26:54,532
You killed him.

693
01:27:27,238 --> 01:27:28,398
lt`s fine.

694
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:40,670
Who is it?

695
01:28:40,878 --> 01:28:42,277
Room service.

696
01:28:43,481 --> 01:28:45,312
l didn`t order room service.

697
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:47,412
l did.

698
01:28:49,921 --> 01:28:51,752
You should tell me these things.

699
01:29:00,031 --> 01:29:01,896
Where should l put the tray?

700
01:29:02,533 --> 01:29:04,467
Over here`s fine.

701
01:29:10,475 --> 01:29:12,705
What`s going on outside?

702
01:29:15,213 --> 01:29:16,703
The Day of the Dead.

703
01:29:16,914 --> 01:29:18,643
What`re the flowers for?

704
01:29:18,816 --> 01:29:22,650
The families make a path from
their homes to the cemetery...

705
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:24,651
...with the flower petals...

706
01:29:24,822 --> 01:29:28,724
...so the souls of the dead
can find their way home.

707
01:29:28,926 --> 01:29:29,722
That`s nice.

708
01:29:30,194 --> 01:29:31,855
Call me anytime for the tray.

709
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,633
Sounds great, huh? Can we go?

710
01:29:45,143 --> 01:29:47,703
No, he`s here now. l know he is.

711
01:29:48,212 --> 01:29:50,203
So we`re staying in the hotel.

712
01:29:50,715 --> 01:29:52,876
The enemy of fun.

713
01:29:53,718 --> 01:29:55,049
l got you a beer.

714
01:30:45,903 --> 01:30:48,303
l wish l could explain to you why...

715
01:30:48,506 --> 01:30:49,996
...l killed Nicolai.

716
01:30:51,075 --> 01:30:53,805
At the time it was the
right thing to do, but...

717
01:30:54,645 --> 01:30:56,237
...l`m sorry l did it.

718
01:30:56,514 --> 01:30:59,506
lt`s something l`ve had to
live with for 15 years.

719
01:31:01,252 --> 01:31:03,914
l used to wish it would happen to me...

720
01:31:04,088 --> 01:31:05,817
...and that`d be my way out.

721
01:31:07,425 --> 01:31:08,585
Permanently.

722
01:31:10,094 --> 01:31:11,527
But not any more.

723
01:31:14,932 --> 01:31:16,593
Not since l met you.

724
01:32:14,825 --> 01:32:16,884
Too bad you don`t understand English.

725
01:32:17,128 --> 01:32:21,292
l would like to tell you how wonderful
this cemetery is. lt`s gorgeous.

726
01:32:21,465 --> 01:32:25,026
l love cemeteries.
l really do. l really do.

727
01:32:25,469 --> 01:32:30,304
You`re here, the next day you`re there.
l put a lot of people down there.

728
01:32:31,042 --> 01:32:33,033
A lot of people down there.

729
01:33:20,091 --> 01:33:21,581
Jasmine.

730
01:34:38,936 --> 01:34:40,267
Jasmine.

731
01:34:42,339 --> 01:34:44,273
lt`s all over the place.

732
01:35:11,769 --> 01:35:13,760
l just killed your brother.

733
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,511
''Contract has been paid...

734
01:35:31,689 --> 01:35:34,852
''...transferred to the
specified account.''

735
01:35:36,527 --> 01:35:38,688
And her disk?

736
01:35:42,099 --> 01:35:44,795
''You`ll be advised. Good-bye, Robert.''

737
01:35:45,803 --> 01:35:46,861
Good-bye.

738
01:35:48,706 --> 01:35:49,934
Let`s get ready.

739
01:35:54,211 --> 01:35:55,439
Don`t lose this.

740
01:35:55,613 --> 01:35:56,944
Two-way?

741
01:35:57,114 --> 01:36:01,050
They saw you coming.
This is a piece of junk.

742
01:36:01,719 --> 01:36:05,712
Tell me when he leaves the hotel,
l`ll tell you when he leaves the bank.

743
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:07,448
- What`s this for?
- Just in case.

744
01:36:08,225 --> 01:36:10,819
No. l can`t shoot anybody.

745
01:36:10,961 --> 01:36:11,791
l can`t.

746
01:36:11,962 --> 01:36:13,327
You almost shot me.

747
01:36:13,731 --> 01:36:15,130
l aimed at the lamp.

748
01:36:15,633 --> 01:36:16,827
Aim at him.

749
01:36:20,905 --> 01:36:23,135
Ever play cowboys and lndians?

750
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:26,332
- Sure. Everybody did.
- And which were you?

751
01:36:27,144 --> 01:36:28,338
An lndian.

752
01:36:29,146 --> 01:36:31,580
- l was always an lndian.
- Always the lndian.

753
01:36:32,149 --> 01:36:33,980
Just pretend he`s a cowboy...

754
01:36:34,151 --> 01:36:35,584
...and pull the trigger.

755
01:36:35,853 --> 01:36:37,650
Then pretend he gets up after.

756
01:36:38,088 --> 01:36:39,988
But you must pull the trigger.

757
01:36:40,858 --> 01:36:42,257
You`ve got to.

758
01:36:44,595 --> 01:36:47,155
l never depended on anyone in my life.

759
01:36:48,666 --> 01:36:50,099
l`m depending on you.

760
01:37:19,530 --> 01:37:21,464
l don`t see him.

761
01:37:21,899 --> 01:37:24,299
l`m looking all around the square.

762
01:37:28,472 --> 01:37:29,905
l`m in the bank.

763
01:37:36,814 --> 01:37:38,975
Where do l go for transfers?

764
01:37:39,483 --> 01:37:40,643
Oh, my God!

765
01:37:41,919 --> 01:37:43,045
He`s here.

766
01:37:43,721 --> 01:37:45,484
He`s going to the hotel.

767
01:37:47,658 --> 01:37:49,319
He`s almost at the door.

768
01:37:53,230 --> 01:37:55,664
He`s going in. He`s going in.

769
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:59,928
That`s what we wanted.
Relax, try the decaf.

770
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:03,662
He must be upstairs now.
Should l stay or go in?

771
01:38:03,841 --> 01:38:06,571
No. Stay? Wait, wait. l`ll just wait.

772
01:38:07,344 --> 01:38:08,174
lt`s hot.

773
01:38:08,345 --> 01:38:09,676
Goddamn, it`s hot.

774
01:38:09,847 --> 01:38:12,577
l`d rather be out there than in here.

775
01:38:15,185 --> 01:38:16,675
May l help you?

776
01:38:16,854 --> 01:38:19,015
l`m expecting a transfer.

777
01:38:49,486 --> 01:38:51,977
Señor, we have received
your transfer.

778
01:38:52,122 --> 01:38:54,113
l`d like to close the account.

779
01:38:54,291 --> 01:38:55,383
Today?

780
01:38:55,726 --> 01:38:57,125
Close it today?

781
01:38:57,294 --> 01:38:58,727
Right now.

782
01:38:58,896 --> 01:39:01,626
- How would you like the funds?
- American currency.

783
01:39:02,633 --> 01:39:05,898
Would you please step right over there.
l`ll be right back.

784
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:07,059
No problem.

785
01:39:44,108 --> 01:39:45,541
Mr. Rath?

786
01:39:47,444 --> 01:39:50,106
You`re aware there may
be a withdrawal fee.

787
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,440
Yes, l am.

788
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:54,681
This will take some time.

789
01:39:55,619 --> 01:39:57,280
l`ve got all day.

790
01:39:57,688 --> 01:39:58,848
Take care of him.

791
01:39:59,056 --> 01:40:01,547
Please, follow me. Right this way.

792
01:40:03,694 --> 01:40:05,628
You may sit right here.

793
01:40:06,196 --> 01:40:08,687
Relax. We`ll get you some coffee.

794
01:40:37,628 --> 01:40:39,528
What are you doing there?

795
01:40:57,815 --> 01:40:59,043
Fuck!

796
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:40,750
Talk to me.

797
01:41:41,091 --> 01:41:44,083
No sign of him. He`s just
sitting up there, same as us.

798
01:41:44,561 --> 01:41:48,395
l mean, talk to me. Tell me some
of that weird stuff you know.

799
01:41:48,699 --> 01:41:50,360
Tell you weird stuff.

800
01:41:51,101 --> 01:41:52,090
Like what?

801
01:41:52,269 --> 01:41:53,702
Tell me a joke.

802
01:41:55,372 --> 01:41:56,361
May l?

803
01:41:56,773 --> 01:41:57,865
Sure.

804
01:41:59,109 --> 01:42:01,202
Tell me something to distract me.

805
01:42:03,614 --> 01:42:05,605
l`m not getting paid for this.

806
01:42:05,716 --> 01:42:07,274
Be generous.

807
01:42:07,784 --> 01:42:09,615
Once upon a time...

808
01:42:10,554 --> 01:42:12,454
...there was a little sparrow...

809
01:42:12,623 --> 01:42:15,558
...who, while flying south
for the winter, froze solid...

810
01:42:15,792 --> 01:42:17,384
...and fell to the ground.

811
01:42:17,794 --> 01:42:20,456
To make matters worse,
a cow crapped on him.

812
01:42:20,797 --> 01:42:23,391
But the manure was warm
and defrosted him.

813
01:42:23,567 --> 01:42:28,300
So there he is, warm and happy to
be alive and he starts to sing.

814
01:42:28,472 --> 01:42:30,235
A cat comes along...

815
01:42:30,407 --> 01:42:33,240
...and he clears off the manure
and eats the little bird.

816
01:42:34,578 --> 01:42:36,910
The moral of the story is this:

817
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:40,641
Everyone who craps on you is
not necessarily your enemy...

818
01:42:40,817 --> 01:42:43,308
...and everyone who
gets you out of crap...

819
01:42:43,654 --> 01:42:46,088
...is not necessarily your friend.

820
01:42:46,256 --> 01:42:48,315
And if you`re warm and happy...

821
01:42:48,592 --> 01:42:51,755
...no matter where you are,
keep your big mouth shut.

822
01:42:55,899 --> 01:42:56,957
You like that?

823
01:43:13,884 --> 01:43:16,876
l think l`m running out of stories.

824
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,350
Keep your eye on that building.

825
01:43:19,523 --> 01:43:21,514
He must be getting impatient.

826
01:43:21,692 --> 01:43:23,455
He`ll make his move soon.

827
01:43:25,629 --> 01:43:27,187
Thanks for the stories.

828
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:56,323
Sorry l`ve been taking up the table.

829
01:43:56,493 --> 01:43:58,393
Thank you. Thank you.

830
01:44:11,742 --> 01:44:14,233
Fuck! Shit! Motherfucker!

831
01:44:14,745 --> 01:44:16,679
Fuck! Shit!

832
01:44:28,625 --> 01:44:31,822
We have deducted our fee and
are making a second count.

833
01:44:31,962 --> 01:44:34,453
The funds will be
available in a half-hour.

834
01:44:34,831 --> 01:44:36,822
l hope you are comfortable.

835
01:46:21,838 --> 01:46:23,567
Oh, my God. He`s coming.

836
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:24,729
He`s coming.

837
01:46:24,941 --> 01:46:26,431
He waited longer than l did.

838
01:46:26,576 --> 01:46:27,668
Here he is.

839
01:46:29,579 --> 01:46:30,511
Go.

840
01:46:35,452 --> 01:46:38,012
- l have your property.
- Be right there.

841
01:46:42,192 --> 01:46:43,090
Where are you?

842
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:45,760
l`m here in room 303.

843
01:46:47,864 --> 01:46:49,525
The rifle should be on the right.

844
01:46:49,699 --> 01:46:53,032
lf so, the gun is
going to be right here.

845
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:54,198
lt`s not.

846
01:46:54,371 --> 01:46:55,531
What`s happening?

847
01:46:58,475 --> 01:46:59,373
lt`s not here.

848
01:47:00,043 --> 01:47:01,374
Listen to me.

849
01:47:01,711 --> 01:47:02,700
Get out now.

850
01:47:07,284 --> 01:47:08,546
Damn it.

851
01:47:08,718 --> 01:47:10,982
Forget the rifle. Get out.

852
01:47:22,999 --> 01:47:24,057
Have you left?

853
01:47:29,673 --> 01:47:30,662
Found it!

854
01:48:16,553 --> 01:48:18,544
Damn hot day, isn`t it?

855
01:48:18,688 --> 01:48:20,053
Scorcher.

856
01:48:24,561 --> 01:48:25,858
l got it.

857
01:48:33,136 --> 01:48:34,467
Tell me...

858
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:38,471
...how did you know?

859
01:48:39,576 --> 01:48:41,373
Who the hell taught you?

860
01:48:42,212 --> 01:48:43,474
History.

861
01:48:43,813 --> 01:48:44,643
Nicolai.

862
01:48:46,216 --> 01:48:49,652
15 years ago l walked into
this bank just like you.

863
01:48:49,819 --> 01:48:51,150
That makes you good...

864
01:48:51,488 --> 01:48:53,217
...because l was the best.

865
01:48:54,724 --> 01:48:56,487
Now you feel like a mark.

866
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:58,491
You think you were sold out.

867
01:48:59,329 --> 01:49:00,990
Don`t know who to trust.

868
01:49:01,831 --> 01:49:03,389
And you, anticuado?

869
01:49:04,834 --> 01:49:05,823
Who do you trust?

870
01:49:06,002 --> 01:49:07,094
No one.

871
01:49:07,237 --> 01:49:09,228
You`re alone. Same as me.

872
01:49:16,246 --> 01:49:17,679
l don`t have it!

873
01:49:19,182 --> 01:49:20,410
l don`t have the gun.

874
01:49:25,855 --> 01:49:27,686
Why the sunglasses, kid?

875
01:49:28,124 --> 01:49:29,682
Afraid l`ll see your eyes?

876
01:49:31,928 --> 01:49:33,862
Just between you and me...

877
01:49:35,265 --> 01:49:36,357
...l`m nervous.

878
01:49:42,872 --> 01:49:44,635
l have $16 million in there.

879
01:49:47,277 --> 01:49:49,438
This is where we can change history.

880
01:49:49,646 --> 01:49:50,772
Our history.

881
01:49:52,282 --> 01:49:54,273
l`m willing to give it to you...

882
01:49:54,951 --> 01:49:56,646
...if you`ll let me walk.

883
01:49:56,786 --> 01:49:57,775
But...

884
01:50:00,056 --> 01:50:01,648
...you won`t do that.

885
01:50:12,902 --> 01:50:14,802
Excuse me, but...

886
01:50:17,407 --> 01:50:18,965
...you are...

887
01:50:19,175 --> 01:50:20,164
...pathetic.

888
01:50:20,910 --> 01:50:22,901
You sound like a mark.

889
01:50:23,179 --> 01:50:24,908
What happened to you?

890
01:50:25,415 --> 01:50:27,906
Nothing. l know where you`re going.

891
01:50:28,985 --> 01:50:30,418
l tell you...

892
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,683
...that night in the taxi...

893
01:50:33,189 --> 01:50:35,680
...l thought l was
lucky just to be alive.

894
01:50:35,825 --> 01:50:36,917
Now...

895
01:50:37,193 --> 01:50:39,093
...l think differently.

896
01:50:39,596 --> 01:50:41,427
You were the lucky one.

897
01:50:47,003 --> 01:50:49,437
l`m a very, very lucky man.

898
01:50:52,609 --> 01:50:54,201
No more chitchat.

899
01:50:59,282 --> 01:51:00,442
Good luck.

900
01:51:20,537 --> 01:51:23,028
Where are you? Talk to me.

901
01:51:34,050 --> 01:51:35,244
Can you hear me?

902
01:51:36,486 --> 01:51:37,817
Fuck.

903
01:51:46,062 --> 01:51:49,054
Everything is in order.
Please, come with me.

904
01:52:12,355 --> 01:52:15,017
This is awkward.
lt`s not really my affair...

905
01:52:15,191 --> 01:52:18,786
...but l was told you would
give us something in return.

906
01:52:38,715 --> 01:52:41,206
Oh, God, l`m fucked. l`m fucked.

907
01:53:04,574 --> 01:53:06,064
Now...

908
01:53:06,242 --> 01:53:07,903
...we are closed.

909
01:53:34,671 --> 01:53:36,605
Step outside.

910
01:53:37,874 --> 01:53:39,432
Step outside...

911
01:53:39,609 --> 01:53:41,270
...and l`ll set you free.

912
01:53:41,511 --> 01:53:44,776
Excuse me, sir, would you
please sign this receipt?

913
01:53:48,685 --> 01:53:50,175
l got the sword...

914
01:53:50,386 --> 01:53:51,944
...right here.

915
01:53:52,689 --> 01:53:54,680
There is no shame.

916
01:53:55,792 --> 01:53:58,022
You won`t feel a thing.

917
01:54:00,897 --> 01:54:02,694
Thank you for your business.

918
01:54:03,132 --> 01:54:04,463
You`re welcome.

919
01:54:18,047 --> 01:54:19,139
Here he is.

920
01:54:19,716 --> 01:54:20,546
Here he is.

921
01:54:21,217 --> 01:54:22,479
Thank you.

922
01:54:28,057 --> 01:54:29,149
We`ve got it.

923
01:54:29,325 --> 01:54:30,815
We did it.

924
01:54:33,062 --> 01:54:34,324
Come on.

925
01:54:34,497 --> 01:54:35,930
Step outside.

926
01:54:36,065 --> 01:54:37,054
We`re in.

927
01:54:37,433 --> 01:54:38,559
You there?

928
01:54:39,669 --> 01:54:40,829
Where are you?

929
01:54:47,577 --> 01:54:48,839
You there?

930
01:54:53,516 --> 01:54:54,483
Can you hear me?

931
01:54:54,851 --> 01:54:55,681
Look up.

932
01:54:56,352 --> 01:54:58,513
l want to see your eyes, motherfucker.

933
01:55:01,190 --> 01:55:02,179
Look up.

934
01:55:21,477 --> 01:55:22,205
Jasmine?

935
01:55:22,245 --> 01:55:22,939
Howdy.

936
01:56:21,104 --> 01:56:22,935
You have something of mine.

937
01:56:23,106 --> 01:56:24,437
l need it now.

938
01:56:34,684 --> 01:56:36,948
We got something for you here!

939
01:56:40,556 --> 01:56:42,683
What the fuck do l do with this?

940
01:56:42,859 --> 01:56:44,053
Two against one!

941
01:56:45,128 --> 01:56:47,289
ls that your edge, Rath?

942
01:56:49,465 --> 01:56:52,127
You didn`t take the mark!
You took the bribe!

943
01:56:59,575 --> 01:57:00,564
Don`t worry!

944
01:57:00,710 --> 01:57:02,644
Don`t worry, l`ll take her!

945
01:57:03,146 --> 01:57:05,307
He`s serious, Rath!

946
01:57:05,481 --> 01:57:06,709
Even the odds!

947
01:57:08,084 --> 01:57:10,484
Are you scared, honey?!

948
01:57:11,087 --> 01:57:13,214
l`m going to find you!

949
01:57:32,341 --> 01:57:36,004
l told you l was going to
tear your heart out!

950
01:57:38,047 --> 01:57:39,537
And l will!

951
01:57:41,317 --> 01:57:42,545
l will!

952
01:57:43,653 --> 01:57:45,644
l promise you that!

953
01:59:06,402 --> 01:59:07,630
Wait here.

954
01:59:23,653 --> 01:59:25,245
l said, stay up there!

955
01:59:25,421 --> 01:59:28,151
l`m not going to.
The floor could give way!

956
01:59:28,324 --> 01:59:30,588
Goddamn it,
why don`t you listen to me?!

957
01:59:32,762 --> 01:59:33,990
Don`t move.

958
01:59:35,164 --> 01:59:36,324
Throw it away.

959
01:59:36,933 --> 01:59:38,423
Throw it away!

960
01:59:42,939 --> 01:59:44,839
That was no way to talk to a lady.

961
01:59:52,448 --> 01:59:53,437
Nicolai.

962
01:59:58,854 --> 02:00:00,685
lt`s been a long time.

963
02:00:07,129 --> 02:00:09,120
The years have been good to you.

964
02:00:10,466 --> 02:00:11,364
Miguelito?

965
02:00:12,468 --> 02:00:15,198
Never pictured him so young. A shame.

966
02:00:15,371 --> 02:00:17,032
Second best, after all.

967
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:18,466
He killed you...

968
02:00:18,641 --> 02:00:19,972
...15 years ago.

969
02:00:20,142 --> 02:00:21,370
Yes, he did.

970
02:00:22,778 --> 02:00:23,767
l don`t understand.

971
02:00:23,913 --> 02:00:27,542
Walking out of that bank was
the worst moment of my life.

972
02:00:28,884 --> 02:00:30,818
He always went for the heart.

973
02:00:32,488 --> 02:00:33,477
Predictable.

974
02:00:38,995 --> 02:00:40,394
15 years.

975
02:00:41,664 --> 02:00:43,655
For 15 goddamn years...

976
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:47,832
...you let me think l`d killed you.

977
02:00:50,906 --> 02:00:52,567
Son of a bitch.

978
02:00:54,076 --> 02:00:55,737
Son of a bitch.

979
02:00:56,512 --> 02:01:00,073
You`re forgetting you shot me.
You son of a bitch.

980
02:01:00,249 --> 02:01:01,409
Why?

981
02:01:01,584 --> 02:01:03,176
Why did you set me up?

982
02:01:03,586 --> 02:01:05,247
The Cold War was ending.

983
02:01:05,421 --> 02:01:06,854
l needed to die...

984
02:01:07,423 --> 02:01:09,687
...to leave no past behind.

985
02:01:09,925 --> 02:01:11,586
You delivered me.

986
02:01:12,928 --> 02:01:14,088
You`re the mark?

987
02:01:14,764 --> 02:01:16,425
You must be the contractor.

988
02:01:16,932 --> 02:01:19,264
l`m disappointed. You were to kill her.

989
02:01:27,043 --> 02:01:28,533
You`re a thief.

990
02:01:29,879 --> 02:01:31,107
A good one.

991
02:01:33,783 --> 02:01:35,273
l retired.

992
02:01:35,785 --> 02:01:37,446
You were so good.

993
02:01:38,054 --> 02:01:41,046
l had to use both my
best to track you down.

994
02:01:41,791 --> 02:01:44,954
There`s something on that disk
that would bring you to life?

995
02:01:45,127 --> 02:01:47,459
Enough information to expose us all.

996
02:01:48,064 --> 02:01:49,554
Especially me.

997
02:01:52,968 --> 02:01:54,629
Can`t you kiss and make up?

998
02:01:56,639 --> 02:01:58,630
This is sad for me, Robert.

999
02:01:59,241 --> 02:02:00,299
Sentimental, but...

1000
02:02:00,476 --> 02:02:02,740
...l did not want to find you alive.

1001
02:02:05,381 --> 02:02:06,678
First things first.

1002
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,931
Don`t do this.

1003
02:02:30,106 --> 02:02:31,767
She`s right.

1004
02:02:32,608 --> 02:02:33,666
She always is.

1005
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:36,444
Female intuition.

1006
02:02:40,649 --> 02:02:42,480
Where are you going?

1007
02:02:43,319 --> 02:02:44,911
To finish something...

1008
02:02:45,554 --> 02:02:47,818
...you didn`t finish years ago.

1009
02:02:48,491 --> 02:02:49,423
What?

1010
02:02:54,430 --> 02:02:56,057
Just to make sure.

1011
02:03:01,070 --> 02:03:01,832
Take it.

1012
02:03:05,508 --> 02:03:07,169
Are you going to kill me?

1013
02:03:07,343 --> 02:03:09,743
l never wanted to kill you at all.

1014
02:03:15,751 --> 02:03:16,945
Help me up.

1015
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:18,578
Will you?

1016
02:03:18,954 --> 02:03:20,751
Don`t even breathe hard.

1017
02:03:25,961 --> 02:03:27,588
You want to die?

1018
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:33,190
Help me up.

1019
02:03:42,278 --> 02:03:43,370
Thank you.

1020
02:03:49,618 --> 02:03:50,983
Now what?

1021
02:03:52,555 --> 02:03:53,988
l`m finished.

1022
02:03:54,790 --> 02:03:56,223
What do you mean?

1023
02:03:56,892 --> 02:03:58,723
The history stops here.

1024
02:03:58,994 --> 02:04:00,120
No more.

1025
02:04:00,496 --> 02:04:01,986
l`m gone.

1026
02:04:02,631 --> 02:04:03,620
l quit.

1027
02:04:13,742 --> 02:04:16,074
That would make me number one.

1028
02:04:17,079 --> 02:04:18,410
Number one.

1029
02:04:21,817 --> 02:04:23,512
l can live with that...

1030
02:04:23,752 --> 02:04:24,582
...can you?

1031
02:04:28,257 --> 02:04:30,589
Absolutamente, compañero.

1032
02:04:30,759 --> 02:04:32,818
Then live with it, Miguel.

1033
02:04:33,329 --> 02:04:34,523
Live with it.

1034
02:04:38,834 --> 02:04:41,098
lt was very nice meeting you...

1035
02:04:41,670 --> 02:04:43,262
...Robert Rath.

1036
02:04:43,439 --> 02:04:46,101
lt was very dangerous
meeting you, Miguel Bain.

1037
02:04:59,355 --> 02:05:00,617
You know...

1038
02:05:01,457 --> 02:05:03,186
...as long as you`re out there...

1039
02:05:04,793 --> 02:05:06,624
...l`ll never be number one.

1040
02:05:09,565 --> 02:05:10,691
Say good-bye...

1041
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:12,358
...Bobby.

1042
02:05:16,805 --> 02:05:17,794
No good-byes.

1043
02:05:20,876 --> 02:05:21,808
Good-bye, Miguel.

1044
02:05:50,406 --> 02:05:51,737
Thank you.

1045
02:06:00,416 --> 02:06:01,747
Wait a minute.

1046
02:06:12,761 --> 02:06:14,854
You`d better keep the disk, Robert.

1047
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:17,021
My real name is Joseph.

1048
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:20,191
l`m Anna. Nice to meet you, Joseph.

1049
02:06:20,436 --> 02:06:23,132
So, Joseph, let`s go
get Pearl a boyfriend.

1050
02:06:23,372 --> 02:06:27,365
Sure. And after that, if you don`t
mind, l`d like to go to the hospital.
