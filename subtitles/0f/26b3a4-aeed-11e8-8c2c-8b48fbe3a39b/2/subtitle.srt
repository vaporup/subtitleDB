1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:03,599
He wants to go to college.

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,401
Really?

3
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:08,709
He's really something.

4
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:11,312
Son!

5
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:15,311
If you get into college,
the tuition is on me.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,111
Go, Taesik!

7
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:20,421
Come eat some melon.

8
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:23,124
Give me a minute.

9
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:26,421
Come on now. Eat some.

10
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:27,323
Pretty good.

11
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:31,125
Wait for your brother!
Put it down.

12
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:41,704
What?

13
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:43,208
Hold still.

14
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,608
Come on, it's my favorite.

15
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:47,715
'Princess can't sleep.‘

16
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:50,409
- Princess what?
- Listen to it.

17
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,214
She's officially crazy.

18
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,417
Look into the camera.

19
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,122
Here we go.

20
00:02:56,644 --> 00:03:01,604
- I'm going home.
- Okay, good job today.

21
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,307
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

22
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:04,509
Yes.

23
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,826
You live with Sunflower Lady?

24
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:18,523
Yes.

25
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:24,095
I'm sorry about your leg.

26
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,201
No point talking about the past.

27
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,510
Forget about it.

28
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,614
Mr. Cho Pansu...

29
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:37,615
He wants to build a big mall.

30
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:42,221
He's bought the field of sunflowers...

31
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:46,823
...except that restaurant
standing in the middle of it.

32
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,929
That made him very upset.

33
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,724
You know what?

34
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,529
I hope you leave town with her.

35
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,103
Otherwise,
your family will be in trouble.

36
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,105
Cho is a ruthless bastard.

37
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,009
I hope to not see you again
around here.

38
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:29,229
Tocopherol,
unsaturated fatty acid...

39
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,998
It's good for the system.

40
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:37,304
Drink it.

41
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,413
Drink it now!

42
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:40,905
Gulp it down.

43
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:42,516
Changmu!

44
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:48,020
I never thought the day would come
for you to visit me here.

45
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:51,523
We got ourselves a problem.

46
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,220
'We'?

47
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,623
Since when?

48
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:05,603
But it wasn't Cho who met him.

49
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,207
Who's Byungjin?

50
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:10,310
Use your head.
That's for thinking.

51
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:13,812
I do a lot of thinking, too.

52
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:15,711
Forget it.

53
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,116
I think Cho made him an offer.

54
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,520
What would that be?

55
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:25,023
It can't be anything small.

56
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,320
- Oracle?
- You got it.

57
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:28,622
What about us?

58
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,025
Changmu.

59
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,223
Stop calling me like that.

60
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,129
Take care of the restaurant.

61
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,793
I'll deal with Taesik.

62
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:50,015
I'll kill you
if you ever come back.

63
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:51,311
Okay.

64
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,821
You look so unique.

65
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,614
Sure.

66
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:18,610
Doesn't it hurt?

67
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:21,215
I bet it does.

68
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:29,519
I don't understand
why you want it erased.

69
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,319
It's cool, isn't it?

70
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,429
Like an iguana with skin trouble.

71
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,531
Come on.

72
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:43,126
Send her out.
She's too noisy for me.

73
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,500
Don't you smell meat burning?

74
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:51,601
What's wrong with you?
Be quiet!

75
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,505
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:59,913
Study hard, okay?

77
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:02,714
What?

78
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,624
Study hard.

79
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,628
I hate repeating myself.

80
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,427
Why?

81
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:13,932
You don't know?

82
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:16,798
I'm going to a good college.

83
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,805
It'd be good
if we went to school together.

84
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,806
You can be my bodyguard.

85
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:25,208
It's a dangerous world
for pretty girls.

86
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:27,314
You know I'm pretty.

87
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:35,614
What, you don't think so?

88
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,821
How much is it?

89
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,829
Going to the same college
with Huiju

90
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:58,901
Why don't you leave?

91
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:02,709
We're not thugs.

92
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,114
We don't want any trouble.

93
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,221
Cooperate with us.

94
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:11,621
To my eyes,
you're nothing but thugs.

95
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,819
So save it and get out.

96
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,829
- God damn it!
- What?

97
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,832
I'm Lee Changmu.

98
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,232
And I'm about to lose it.

99
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:25,396
Don't you get it?

100
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,707
Get out, asshole.

101
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:36,715
- Get out of here.
- Fuck it.

102
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,910
Okay, boys.
We'll do it my way.

103
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:40,418
Get out!

104
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,613
- Trash it.
- Okay.

105
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,724
Let go, asshole!

106
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:01,499
What are you doing?

107
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,008
You crazy bitch!

108
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,914
Call the cops, please!

109
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,111
Call the cops!

110
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,820
Bitch!

111
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:23,726
Changmu, are you okay?

112
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:26,433
What are you doing?
It's our restaurant!

113
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,626
- Leave us alone!
- What?

114
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,795
What should we do?

115
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,600
I saw it coming.

116
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,710
Let's go.
We have to stop them.

117
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,711
God, I hate this situation!

118
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:43,613
Wait a little longer.

119
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:48,713
Hold your horses!
I said wait, didn't I?

120
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:52,924
Damn, it hurts.

121
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:02,031
That was your daughter, right?
She hit me with a weapon.

122
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,397
A weapon?

123
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:06,199
What was it then?

124
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,503
She almost killed me with it.

125
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:13,704
Stop staring at me.

126
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:20,814
Look, we'll call it even today.

127
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,617
Or I'll have her arrested.

128
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,525
I'm very well aware of that area.

129
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,630
A lot of witnesses.

130
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:32,426
I'm not bluffing.

131
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:35,831
You're nothing but trash!

132
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,301
Look here.

133
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:41,898
This car is 14 years old.

134
00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:45,410
It's been quite well maintained.

135
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:48,413
Look, it's in good shape.

136
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,909
Come on, let's go!

137
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:53,213
HuUu?

138
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:57,618
Mom... Mom...

139
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,020
I gotta go.

140
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:08,126
What'd you bring him for?
It's nothing.

141
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,799
This is nothing?

142
00:11:17,445 --> 00:11:19,106
I'm sorry.

143
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:20,907
It's totally broken.

144
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,908
I'll buy you another one.

145
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:28,215
No, I don't need it now.

146
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,017
Buy me one
when I get into college.

147
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,318
Okay.

148
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,929
The pictures are good, though.

149
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:43,603
Bastards...

150
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,105
Let's see who laughs last.

151
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,101
It's Cho Pansu, isn't it?

152
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:56,612
How do you know that scumbag?

153
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:02,453
Cheers!

154
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:07,122
Good job today.

155
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:11,129
That's how we get things done.

156
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:12,323
Let's drink.

157
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,002
Hey, Taesik.

158
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,811
I have no business with you.
Let me talk to Mr. Cho.

159
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,912
You're the Oh Taesik, huh?

160
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,418
I've heard about you.

161
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,424
I have a favor to ask of you.

162
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:44,921
I promised to myself
that I'd never fight again.

163
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,825
Help me keep that promise.

164
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:50,596
I force you to fight?

165
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,797
What makes you think that?

166
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:57,500
I was going to ask you help me
with my business.

167
00:12:57,645 --> 00:12:59,112
I have a job.

168
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,908
You should have bigger goals in life.

169
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,611
I'm satisfied now.

170
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:06,311
My business is legitimate.

171
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,911
Thank you.
But no thanks.

172
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:12,020
That's a shame.

173
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,421
Do me this favor.

174
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:21,524
It's a favor?
More like a threat to me.

175
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:36,908
What's so difficult?
We're helping each other.

176
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:40,011
It's very easy.

177
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,213
We'll set the table.

178
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:44,620
You arrest him afterwards.

179
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:48,717
He's on parole.
It'll put him back in jail.

180
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:49,726
Can you do it?

181
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:53,321
No problem.
You know I'm good.

182
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:57,903
What's up?

183
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,500
You don't need to know.

184
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:05,005
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

185
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,214
Hi.

186
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,822
I hear you guys are good.

187
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,723
You got that right.

188
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,420
What's wrong with it?

189
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:27,331
I want something special.

190
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:30,403
Like a flying car in the movie.

191
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,902
Cool, isn't it?

192
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,007
Put wings on my car.

193
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,301
You're kidding.

194
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,604
I am?

195
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,607
I had a burger for lunch.

196
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:44,217
You think I ate that to joke
with you?

197
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:48,517
Come on, put wings on my car.

198
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:50,920
We don't do that here.

199
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,423
Go to a different garage.

200
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,323
A different one?
Where?

201
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:59,125
You should be able to tell us
where I can have it done.

202
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,130
Where?

203
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,131
Please, don't.

204
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,236
Asshole!

205
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,899
I'm sorry if! offended you.

206
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,008
You're sorry?

207
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,703
This guy is so arrogant.

208
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,404
What are you doing?
Beat him.

209
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:14,605
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,319
Sorry my ass!

211
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,026
Taesik!
What are you doing?

212
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,634
Stop it!

213
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:36,695
Taesik!

214
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:51,315
Why are you doing this?

215
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,113
Stop it!

216
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:54,811
I'm okay.

217
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,515
Why are you doing this?

218
00:15:57,658 --> 00:16:00,126
I'm okay. I'm okay.

219
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,625
What are you doing?

220
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:10,703
- What are you looking at?
- I'll poke your eyes out.

221
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,104
That's enough.

222
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:17,802
Let's go.

223
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:23,709
Are you okay?

224
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:25,113
Sir.

225
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,715
I'm glad you didn't lose it.

226
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,721
You did well.

227
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:34,021
Look!
They're leaving?

228
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:37,619
Who's that stupid ass?

229
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,733
He couldn't get him upset?

230
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:45,705
Anyway, Taesik has changed a lot.

231
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,707
He would've knocked them out
10 years ago.

232
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:54,906
5 big ones, and...

233
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,716
Are these all you have?

234
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,012
That's right.

235
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,921
I need more.

236
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,726
Can I order them in sets?

237
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,029
You didn't know them?

238
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:12,428
Never seen them before.

239
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:16,327
No reason?

240
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,494
Right.

241
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:23,200
It is true.

242
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:26,008
You did get beat up.

243
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:30,606
When I heard you got beat
by petty thugs...

244
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:33,311
I didn't believe it, but it's true.

245
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:35,217
You know him?

246
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,119
He's just a kid.

247
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,021
A kid?

248
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,424
You call me a kid?

249
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,724
Watch it.

250
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:49,832
Get out of here.
Don't bother my son again.

251
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,996
Your son my ass.

252
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,608
I know the whole story.

253
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,903
What a fucked-up family.

254
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:01,208
How can you adopt a guy
who whacked your own son?

255
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,111
You call that a family?

256
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:06,314
Shut up.

257
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:10,822
You whacked her son, right?

258
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,324
Choi Dopil.

259
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,506
What? What?

260
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:41,514
It's late.

261
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,425
Go to your room.

262
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,329
He really killed my brother?

263
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,798
Did he?

264
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,708
How could you do that?

265
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:06,802
How could you adopt a man
who killed your son?

266
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:11,511
Things happen in life.

267
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,620
It was an accident.

268
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:17,212
Still, it was him who killed
my brother.

269
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,320
After the funeral...

270
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:26,321
I went to see him in jail.

271
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,393
I wanted to ask him...

272
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:35,397
...what he did to deserve that.

273
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,507
Then what?

274
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:44,617
He started crying,
saying he was sorry.

275
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:52,018
I'd never seen anybody
cry like that.

276
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,423
Seeing him cry...

277
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:03,325
I realized
he'd just made a mistake.

278
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:07,407
And that he wasn't a bad person.

279
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:13,110
So I visited him a few more times.

280
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,215
I watched him for 10 years.

281
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,520
He was a good kid.

282
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,117
So I decided to make him my son.

283
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:33,924
I must be crazy.

284
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:55,919
I thought you had quit.

285
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:04,522
I want to, but it isn't easy.

286
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,898
I'm sorry.

287
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,801
I wasn't thinking right.

288
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,410
I'll leave.

289
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,712
Take care of your mom.

290
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:29,713
What about us?

291
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,917
Mom and I were happy
to have you with us.

292
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:35,619
Now you're leaving?

293
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,727
You're so funny.

294
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,528
You come and go as you like?

295
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:43,897
Huiju...

296
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,003
I'm thankful.

297
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:52,810
I came to thank you,
and you tell me you're leaving?

298
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,018
My brother was her son.

299
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,520
But he was a piece of shit.

300
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,118
He would beat her for money.

301
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:13,729
I was very young
when I heard that he died.

302
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:16,233
But I was very happy.

303
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:24,506
That mom would never be
beaten up by her own son.

304
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,807
Don't go.

305
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,209
I don't care what others say.

306
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,318
And mom is happy with you.

307
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,226
I've never seen her that happy.

308
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,126
Live with us.

309
00:22:56,443 --> 00:23:00,311
I'm going down.
Smoke another cigarette.

310
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,415
I'll call you brother
from now on.

311
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:08,619
Brother...

312
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:11,417
God, it feels awkward.

313
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:28,296
So you're saying...

314
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,807
I ordered Dopil to hit Taesik.

315
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:36,109
So one died,
and the other ended up in jail?

316
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,519
And I cheated Dopil
out of the field of sunflowers?

317
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:47,618
If you leave Taesik and us alone,
I'll keep quiet.

318
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:50,723
You must be going senile.

319
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,027
Let's say that's true.

320
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:57,796
Why make an issue out of it now,
not 10 years ago?

321
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:00,498
If even you gave an order,
it was my son who did it.

322
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,906
It's my son's diary.

323
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:12,016
I couldn't care less
if you become a Congressmen.

324
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:15,918
But if this diary gets out...

325
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:18,923
You're going down.

326
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,231
It's Dopil's?

327
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,495
Yes, it's his.

328
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,198
What are you gonna do?

329
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,201
What do you think?

330
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:43,410
Nothing gets done
without me stepping in.

331
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,508
We should take care of this.

332
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:53,817
This is impossible.
Taesik, open this for me.

333
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,018
Okay.

334
00:24:58,064 --> 00:24:59,531
Damn.

335
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,229
Hi, Wellbeing Garage.

336
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,702
Taesik, it's me.

337
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,905
Sunflower Lady is in danger.

338
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,003
What?

339
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:14,512
She blackmailed Mr. Cho.

340
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:17,811
- He won't leave her alone.
- What do you mean?

341
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:20,317
What happened 10 years ago...

342
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:22,512
It was Cho's work.

343
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,519
He gave Dopil the order.

344
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,426
What she knows is true.

345
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:34,024
I'm telling you
Cho won't let this slide.

346
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,393
Taesik, be careful.

347
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,801
I called to warn you.

348
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:47,904
You missed class.
Where'd you go?

349
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,915
How will you go to college
if you play hooky?

350
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:59,123
She's been drinking all day.

351
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:03,526
Mother, I'm home.

352
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:10,996
Nobody can touch us now.

353
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:14,004
I fixed the problem.

354
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,598
Give me a minute.
Let me finish the song.

355
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:27,814
J'Fall, this lonely night

356
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:33,824
IBugs are crying

357
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,632
Doing your best isn't enough.

358
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,396
The winner sleeps with a beauty.

359
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:46,596
And the loser sleeps alone.

360
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,799
- Understood?
- Yes.

361
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:50,709
Let's go, boys.

362
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:54,204
One, two, three.

363
00:26:54,347 --> 00:26:55,507
Let's go!

364
00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:02,121
Nice serve!

365
00:27:02,255 --> 00:27:03,415
Far, further!

366
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:05,824
Guard! Guard!

367
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:40,818
She got hurt because of me.

368
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:44,415
No, don't be saying that.

369
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:48,921
Ifl had sold the restaurant,

370
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,724
it wouldn't have happened.

371
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:58,501
I didn't think
I wanted that much out of life.

372
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:06,806
Taesik, she's family.

373
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:08,709
Okay?

374
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,007
Yes.

375
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:17,316
Nothing's more important
than family in life, okay?

376
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:20,524
Yes, mother.

377
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:27,124
Okay, we'll sell the place
and leave.

378
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:31,397
We'll start all over.

379
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,406
Take it.

380
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,805
It's for her surgery.

381
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,808
It should be enough.

382
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:46,014
I saved it for her wedding later.

383
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,616
But we need it now.

384
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:56,829
Byungjin, it's me.

385
00:29:58,064 --> 00:30:00,624
I need to see Mr. Cho.

386
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:04,100
Where should I go?

387
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,096
I need to talkto him.

388
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:13,703
- Or...
- It's Oracle.

389
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,610
- What does it mean?
- A prophet.

390
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:21,209
Crazy bastards!
A prophet at a night club?

391
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:23,413
What can he predict?

392
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:25,023
Who knows?

393
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:28,525
I hope to see them go down
before I die.

394
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,526
But I don't see it happening.

395
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:33,728
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

396
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,997
Want a shot?

397
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,103
No thanks.

398
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:47,709
What'd you wanna see me for?

399
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,617
My family will leave town.

400
00:30:58,258 --> 00:31:00,123
Oh, okay.

401
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,124
Nobody's stopping you.

402
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:07,426
Thank you.

403
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:10,797
We'll leave in a few days.

404
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:12,597
Well...

405
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:19,508
If you commit a sin,
you get punished for it.

406
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,413
Give me one of your arms,
and I'll let you go.

407
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:29,219
What do you say?

408
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:31,116
No?

409
00:32:08,461 --> 00:32:10,520
Go ahead.

410
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:02,011
You'll be able to hold a spoon.

411
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:20,724
Taesik, your arm is fine.
Don't worry.

412
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,601
You know what! mean?

413
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:27,695
Have a good life somewhere else.

414
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,805
Consider it as a last gift from me.

415
00:33:58,838 --> 00:34:00,100
It's okay.

416
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:05,206
Everything will be fine.

417
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:12,709
I'll protect you with my life.

418
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,213
We'll be happy again.

419
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:34,003
My dear son...

420
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:39,108
Only if! could see you again.

421
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:46,710
Ifl have to pick the most
difficult time of my life...

422
00:34:47,954 --> 00:34:53,722
It's when we built the restaurant.

423
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:59,224
After your father died suddenly...

424
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:03,895
We were so poor then.

425
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:09,299
I wasn't eating well
so I couldn't breastfeed Huiju.

426
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:17,112
But what kept me going was you.

427
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:24,121
You were mean to me later.

428
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:31,422
Butl believed
you'd come around one day.

429
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,397
Looking back...

430
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:46,601
It was the toughest time
of my life.

431
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:52,613
But at the same time...

432
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:57,411
I couldn't be happier then,
building the restaurant together.

433
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:04,824
I wanted to keep the restaurant.

434
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:09,928
But those bastards are forcing us out.

435
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,605
I'm sorry.

436
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:20,305
Mom's so sorry.

437
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:30,318
The living has to keep on living.

438
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:39,228
Yes, we'll leave.

439
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:44,400
I'll be fine somewhere else.

440
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:48,898
Yes, we'll leave.

441
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,708
Mother, it's me.

442
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:11,723
Mother!

443
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:16,728
Mother, open your eyes.

444
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:18,022
Mother?

445
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:22,322
Mother! Mother!

446
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:25,198
Mom, open your eyes.

447
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:27,305
Open your eyes!
Mom! I

448
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,499
Mom...

449
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:33,009
Open your eyes!
Mom? I

450
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,613
Mom... Mom...

451
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:37,215
Mother...

452
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:45,814
Mom, open your eyes.
Mom? Mom!

453
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:09,704
She was such a good person.

454
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,413
Being rich isn't everything
in life.

455
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:19,217
It's about living a healthy life,
respecting others.

456
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:22,123
I don't understand
why she did it.

457
00:39:23,162 --> 00:39:26,029
She was such a nice person.

458
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:43,106
She should've listened to us.

459
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:47,307
She got too greedy.

460
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,407
Anybody?

461
00:40:21,654 --> 00:40:23,315
It's me, Taesik.

462
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:25,216
Taesik?

463
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:30,922
Oh, I said I'd call you brother.

464
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,427
Brother...

465
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:42,198
Sounds weird?

466
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,702
No.

467
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:48,811
Where's mom?

468
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:50,806
Mom?

469
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:57,210
She's at the restaurant.
She'll be back soon.

470
00:40:58,557 --> 00:40:59,615
Brother...

471
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,527
Do me a favor.

472
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,201
Hello?

473
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:20,206
Hello?

474
00:43:35,748 --> 00:43:37,807
Everybody, focus.

475
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,517
Let's rehearse again.
Attention. Bow.

476
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:52,621
Sir!

477
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:32,803
Nothing's impossible
if you push it.

478
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:36,403
How nice of you
to work together.

479
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:39,406
It's all thanks to you.

480
00:44:39,545 --> 00:44:43,811
Get along from now on.

481
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:47,118
Run the club well.

482
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:02,033
What's this?

483
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:04,094
What?

484
00:45:04,236 --> 00:45:05,601
Can't you hear it?

485
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,098
Who the fuck is crying?

486
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:15,406
It's me, fucker.

487
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:20,111
Oh Taesik.

488
00:45:21,954 --> 00:45:23,216
You know what?

489
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:31,220
For 10 years, I regretted
and promised to myself.

490
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:37,194
Did you have to do it?

491
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,207
You shouldn't have.

492
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:51,314
Did you have to take it all?

493
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,418
Motherfuckers!

494
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:57,112
Are you out of your mind?

495
00:45:57,456 --> 00:45:59,424
Taesik, you're back.

496
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,620
Welcome.

497
00:46:04,263 --> 00:46:06,629
What can you do with
that hand?

498
00:46:08,267 --> 00:46:10,292
I heard about that lady.

499
00:46:11,737 --> 00:46:13,500
And her daughter.

500
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:18,703
It's so sad.

501
00:46:22,948 --> 00:46:24,813
I'll make it sadder for you.

502
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,221
I was looking for it.

503
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:38,229
You had it.

504
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:44,893
Who messed up Huiju's face?

505
00:46:46,438 --> 00:46:50,807
I did, asshole.
Got a problem?

506
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:53,301
Byungjin, leave.

507
00:46:56,348 --> 00:46:58,111
Unless you wanna die.

508
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:09,024
That moron!

509
00:47:14,466 --> 00:47:15,626
I'm sorry.

510
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:20,999
Thanks for letting me live.

511
00:47:30,249 --> 00:47:37,712
If you commit a sin,
you get punished for it.

512
00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:41,521
Understood?

513
00:47:44,763 --> 00:47:49,530
Consider it my punishment.

514
00:47:50,736 --> 00:47:54,695
Hey, do something.

515
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,808
This is quite embarrassing.

516
00:47:56,942 --> 00:48:01,811
Give me a chance.
I'll take care of him.

517
00:48:02,748 --> 00:48:05,717
Yeah? Go ahead.

518
00:48:09,755 --> 00:48:15,421
This is my break
to leave a good impression.

519
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,027
I can do this.

520
00:48:25,137 --> 00:48:26,900
He's a joke.

521
00:48:36,048 --> 00:48:37,709
Should I make it worse?

522
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,723
Fuck! Put out the fire!

523
00:53:45,357 --> 00:53:46,824
Get away from me!

524
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,825
Motherfucker!

525
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:17,512
I saw this coming.

526
00:54:17,956 --> 00:54:20,720
I should've dealt
with you myself.

527
00:54:22,961 --> 00:54:25,225
Trash is trash.

528
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,599
Did you drink?

529
00:55:12,644 --> 00:55:13,804
No.

530
00:55:14,846 --> 00:55:16,507
I didn't drink.

531
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:19,116
Did you ﬁght?

532
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:21,912
No.

533
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:25,122
I didn't ﬁght.

534
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:30,023
Then you won't be crying.

535
00:55:30,862 --> 00:55:32,420
Forever!

536
00:55:37,936 --> 00:55:39,403
Mom...

537
00:55:42,741 --> 00:55:44,299
Huiju...

538
00:55:46,644 --> 00:55:48,009
I'm sorry.

539
00:56:03,061 --> 00:56:08,328
Here's the definition
of Laplace transform.

540
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:12,596
Either F (s) or L (f) are used
as notation.

541
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:16,495
Laplace transform of F (t) is...

542
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:18,006
0 to infinity.

543
00:56:18,143 --> 00:56:21,408
2 and -s (t), f (t), dt.

544
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:27,007
And this inverse
Laplace transform is F (t).

545
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:32,013
Next, this is example of
Laplace transform.

546
00:56:32,157 --> 00:56:36,321
When t is bigger than 0 and
F (t) is 1...

547
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:38,827
Laplace transform
of this is...

548
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:44,697
By the definition L (f) is L (1)
and integral 0 to infinity,

549
00:56:44,836 --> 00:56:48,897
2 and -s (t), dt so,
if you integral calculus

550
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,407
- 1Is, 1 and -s (t)...

551
00:56:52,544 --> 00:56:57,004
0 to infinity
so the answer is 1Is.

552
00:56:57,148 --> 00:56:58,308
That's it for today.

553
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:02,013
You had a hard time
staying awake.

554
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:08,422
I'll make sure those who dozed off
will get a F.

555
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,227
Hand in your papers to Huiju.

556
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:17,701
Everybody's impressed
with your thesis, Huiju.

557
00:57:17,836 --> 00:57:18,996
See you.

558
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:52,500
Passing a thesis examination

559
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:56,505
Let me ask you something.

560
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:57,801
What is it?

561
00:57:58,343 --> 00:58:02,109
Were you in love with Taesik?

562
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:03,807
Love?

563
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:06,109
I don't know.

564
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:09,814
What do you think love is?

565
00:58:11,556 --> 00:58:13,023
What's love?

566
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,220
It's simple.

567
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:21,430
It's about happy moments
and good memories.

568
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:26,594
If you remember,
love doesn't change.

569
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,802
It doesn't?
