I'll never drink again
I'll never ﬁght nor cry again

7
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,085
Eating walnut snack

8
00:02:51,137 --> 00:03:00,011
Sunﬂower

9
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,692
Hey!

10
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,197
- Me?
- Yes.

11
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:24,703
What?

12
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,896
You're retarded, aren't you?

13
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:32,407
The field of sunflowers is gone.

14
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,012
It's changed a lot.

15
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,779
I can't believe this.

16
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,380
My mom's out now.

17
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,283
Come back tonight.

18
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,787
I have nowhere to go.

19
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,895
You said you're from here.
No friends?

20
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,797
Go to a sauna then.

21
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,605
You mean a public bathhouse?

22
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:10,974
Going to a public bathhouse

23
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,807
Damn.

24
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:50,285
Stop playing with that thing.

25
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:54,484
It's a delicate sensor.

26
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,691
You'll break it.

27
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,890
Okay, I won't.
I'm sorry.

28
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,798
You should know better.

29
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,209
No wonder it keeps breaking.

30
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,774
You have no idea
how expensive it is.

31
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,583
If broken...
Are you loaded?

32
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,882
You'll pay for it?

33
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,588
I've never used it before.

34
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,889
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,598
I'm sorry.

36
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,798
Who is that asshole with?

37
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,308
He's one of Changmu's boys.

38
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,003
Did they report it in?

39
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,607
No.

40
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,683
Things are crazy around here.

41
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,285
I should ask for a transfer.

42
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,392
Changmu and Yangki...

43
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,190
They're bickering
over that Club Oracle.

44
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:09,199
You have to hold your mind.
There's war brewing.

45
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:15,697
I hear they were friends,
weren't they?

46
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,206
Thugs can never be friends.

47
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,679
They knew each other
when they were nothing.

48
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,078
Let's go.

49
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,180
What about her?

50
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,782
They didn't call it in.

51
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:36,384
We're shorthanded.
We got no time for that.

52
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,090
And it's time to eat.

53
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:45,100
She must've done something bad.

54
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,001
- Let's go!
- Okay.

55
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,304
Sugary carbonic acid gas.

56
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,707
Caramel, phosphoric acid.

57
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:57,582
A lot of good stuff in it.
Gulp it down.

58
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,877
Drink it.

59
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,584
Why aren't you?

60
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,185
Drink it, assholes.

61
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:11,285
Hitting you is useless
and so ignorant.

62
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,298
I've decided to change.

63
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,802
Damn, look at you.
You're pathetic.

64
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,604
Haven't I told you?

65
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:29,977
Once Club Oracle is completed,
we're done suffering.

66
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,981
Until then, do yourjob right.

67
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,181
You got that?

68
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,185
Right?

69
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,195
Changmu?

70
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,498
Who the fuck is this?

71
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,100
Fuck.

72
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,602
Taesik!

73
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:03,679
- When'd you get out?
- This morning.

74
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:08,276
Why didn't you call me?
I could've picked you up.

75
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,787
I'll go.

76
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,288
Go where?

77
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:21,394
I just wanted to drop by
and say hello.

78
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,900
You seem quite busy.

79
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,799
Where are you going?

80
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,406
To see Yangki.

81
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,307
- You don't have to see me out.
- It's okay.

82
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,982
Happy to see you're doing well.
Bye.

83
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,089
Call me if you need anything.

84
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,784
Bye.

85
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,790
Asshole.

86
00:08:55,434 --> 00:09:00,394
I should leave you alone?
Whatever you do?

87
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,601
Fuck you.

88
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,303
Keep an eye on him.

89
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,707
Okay, Boss.

90
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,283
Sir!

91
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,593
We're closed.

92
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,709
I thought you drowned
at the sauna.

93
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,377
Mom's been waiting.

94
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,681
Whatever.

95
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,477
Duckja, come out here.

96
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,288
What?

97
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,892
You've been waiting for him.

98
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,591
He's here.

99
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,890
What?

100
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,302
I totally forgot!

101
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,097
You're home, Taesik.

102
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,206
Let me look at you.

103
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,002
- How are you?
- Fine.

104
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,704
It must've been hard.
Did you eat?

105
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,508
Tell me what you feel like.

106
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,276
It's okay, Ma'am.

107
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,882
Get out.

108
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,183
What?

109
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,790
Get out and don't come back.

110
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,389
Where...

111
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,492
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,797
Sorry for what?

113
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,306
I'm sorry, Mother.

114
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,977
Close the shop.

115
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,787
What do you feel like?

116
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,990
Some meat?

117
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,491
Welcome home.

118
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,509
Here.

119
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,471
I'll help myself.

120
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,082
Come on.

121
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,483
Good.

122
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,385
That's good.

123
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,687
I can't believe this.

124
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,295
Dukja, are you happy?

125
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,591
Better watch it.

126
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,200
Don't call me by my name again.

127
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,801
Or what?

128
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:47,201
This! How about it?

129
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,906
Damn.

130
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,910
Where are you going?

131
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,883
To get some water, Dukja!

132
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,280
Can't you see that?

133
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,579
What?

134
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,083
God, you're choking.

135
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,384
Spit it out.

136
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,590
Come on, spit it out.

137
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,992
Listen.

138
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,895
This is your room now.

139
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,695
My brother...

140
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:22,597
Anyway, we fixed it up
with a new boiler.

141
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,903
You'll find it comfortable.

142
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:29,005
I'll do the laundry for you.

143
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:34,677
You clean the bathroom
and feed the dog.

144
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,588
Follow me.

145
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:52,800
Don't expect me to treat you
like a real brother.

146
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,806
I'm known for being mean.

147
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,704
- Okay?
- Sure.

148
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:04,876
I don't know the story
between you and my mom.

149
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,678
But I don't like you.

150
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,980
And I don't like living

151
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,682
with a total stranger.

152
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,394
I was so against the idea.

153
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,795
But I gave in to her
because it was her wish.

154
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,799
You should thank me.

155
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,702
Thanks.

156
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,502
Even if! bother you, suck it up.

157
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,406
Or move out.

158
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,608
I'll suck it up.

159
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:41,987
Here's a piece of advice
for your pathetic life.

160
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:46,389
Being dumb isn'tjust bad.
It's a crime.

161
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,688
It makes others suffer.
Got it?

162
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,996
I'll never drink again.

163
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,297
I'll never fight again.

164
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,803
I'll never cry again.

165
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,077
Wake up.

166
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,883
Get the hell up.

167
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,795
Get up now! I'm late.

168
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:27,899
Okay.

169
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,801
What is it?

170
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,498
I forgot to give you the keys.

171
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,906
Lock the door if you go out.

172
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,308
There isn't much to steal, though.

173
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,414
Here.

174
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,285
Why are you looking at me
like that?

175
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,081
Never seen a pretty girl?

176
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,993
Bye!
Have fun with yourself.

177
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,089
Congratulations on your election.

178
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,294
We expect a lot from you.

179
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,997
We're counting on you.

180
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,109
Don't you worry.

181
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,007
I'll have the market renovated

182
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,410
and bring back customers.

183
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,778
Thank you so much!

184
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,180
Development doesn't happen
for itself.

185
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:26,587
It takes us to abandon the old
and welcome the new.

186
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,693
That's right!

187
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:37,994
I will never disappoint you!

188
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,798
- Cho Pansu! Cho Pansu!
- Thank you!

189
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,411
Thank you!

190
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,285
It's disgusting.

191
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,595
Let's get out of here.

192
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,298
It stinks.

193
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,882
Hey, we're back.

194
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,484
How are you?

195
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,793
What are you doing here?

196
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,096
- What?
- What brought you here?

197
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,994
I was told to report to...

198
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,103
Not that.

199
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,400
Why'd you come back here?

200
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,903
I know Korea is freaking small.

201
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,604
But why?

202
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,781
Why here?

203
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,377
Don't you know me?

204
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,387
We went to middle school together.

205
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,092
You don't remember?

206
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:14,390
You bullied me like crazy!

207
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:20,897
If I were you,
I wouldn't have come back.

208
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,702
People here don't like you.

209
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:28,607
I'm saying this for your sake.
Leave town.

210
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:34,481
I'll be good. Trust me.

211
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,382
You will?

212
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,286
If you say so...

213
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,883
I'll be watching you.
Don't cause any trouble.

214
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,086
Okay.

215
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,489
I said no basketball on duty!

216
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,500
We're on a lunch break.

217
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,304
- Did you eat?
- Yes.

218
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,604
- I'm off to lunch.
- Okay.

219
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:12,184
I got it when I was younger...

220
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,489
...to intimidate people.

221
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,993
Now I think it looks horrible.

222
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,495
Right.

223
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:23,397
It's absolutely a turnoff.

224
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,299
- What?
- A turnoff.

225
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,101
So, what is it that you want?

226
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,202
You know what.

227
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,307
Is it possible?

228
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,878
It's a work of art.

229
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,283
Why don't you leave it?

230
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,181
No.

231
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:49,090
If you want it erased,
it can be done.

232
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,095
But it'll leave a trace.

233
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,689
And it costs a lot of money.

234
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,495
How much?

235
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,198
It's 30 by 50, so...

236
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:06,209
I can't give you
an exact number now.

237
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,905
But I'm sure it's a lot.

238
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,571
A lot.

239
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,682
What if...

240
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,987
Never seen anything like this?

241
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,490
Of course not.

242
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:27,495
Think of me as a guinea pig
and do it for free?

243
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,792
We're not social workers.

244
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,303
No!

245
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,408
I don't think
that's gonna work.

246
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,912
I'll make life easier for you
City Councilor Cho Pansu

247
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,888
- You can't go in!
- Let go!

248
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,490
I don't need an appointment!

249
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,787
You can't see him
without an appointment!

250
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,692
- I need to talk to him!
- What's wrong with you?

251
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,695
What's the matter?

252
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,598
She forced herself in to see you.

253
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,498
It's been a while.

254
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,198
You can leave us.

255
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,502
Yes, sir.

256
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:17,081
Sunflower Lady,
what can I do for you?

257
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,582
I'll make it short.

258
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,484
I'll never sell you my restaurant.

259
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,783
So don't bother.

260
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:32,286
I'm doing everything I can
to develop our community.

261
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,790
You got a hearing problem?

262
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,802
Stop bothering us
by sending those thugs.

263
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,204
Or I'll bite back.

264
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,908
You play a nice daddy
for your kids?

265
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:53,582
I'm sure
they'll learn a lot from you.

266
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,485
Bastard!

267
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,291
Everybody on earth is bad.

268
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,193
You're old enough to know that.

269
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,600
Son?

270
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,408
It's hard to get a job these days.

271
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,707
Why don't you work here?

272
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,975
I'll pay you.

273
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,886
What? No?

274
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,587
- Taesik got a job?
- Yes.

275
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:38,389
At Wellbeing Garage
down the street.

276
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,088
Wellbeing Garage?

277
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,891
Has he gone insane?

278
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:48,900
And he went to the hospital
to have the tattoo erased.

279
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,099
What?

280
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:55,003
And he's living
with that Sunflower Lady?

281
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,882
What the hell is he up to?

282
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,794
Who says you can come up here?

283
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,497
This is the only place of mine
on earth.

284
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,298
Get down now.

285
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,808
What are you hiding?

286
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,703
Oh, cigarettes.

287
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,676
Fine, you can smoke.

288
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,284
Go ahead.

289
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,990
Is it good?

290
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,594
You're pathetic.

291
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,697
Quit smoking.

292
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,403
I hate the smell.

293
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:00,804
Leave now.

294
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,875
Leave.

295
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:09,075
Can't you call me brother?

296
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,386
I told you not to expect that.

297
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,889
I can be a good brother.

298
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:18,587
But I can't be a good sister.

299
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,095
What happened to your face?

300
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,694
My face?

301
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:31,803
There's only one reason for it.

302
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,904
What's that?

303
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,781
I'm too pretty.

304
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,678
The world won't leave me alone.

305
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,684
It's so tiring.

306
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,086
I'm used to it, though.

307
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:53,694
smoking

308
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,513
- Hey
- Yeah?

309
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,275
That's Oh Taesik.

310
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:15,584
Both Changmu and
Yangki were scared of him.

311
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,984
No kidding.

312
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,488
He looks docile.

313
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,092
He got kicked out of high school,

314
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,491
and started causing trouble.

315
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,996
Back then,
Choi Dopil ruled the town.

316
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,296
But he couldn't stop that ass.

317
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:35,600
Within 2 years,
he lost his turfto him.

318
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:41,504
Then Yangki and Changmu
were his underlings.

319
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:46,777
That was 10 years ago.
Damn, time flies.

320
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:47,885
Look, it's raining.

321
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,987
The sun is out,
and it's raining?

322
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,589
- You tell me.
- It feels cool, though.

323
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:59,488
What were you doing 10 years ago?

324
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:03,294
Me? Nothing much.

325
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,802
You know what he did then?

326
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,499
When drunk,
he becomes a beast.

327
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:14,703
Dopil didn't know that
and gathered up his boys...

328
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,873
...to get rid of him.
But he ended up dead.

329
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,878
Look at him drink.

330
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,883
It's about to begin.

331
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:31,391
That's right.
Right, left, and a front kick!

332
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,193
Doesn't it feel so real?

333
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,800
Throw him!

334
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,095
A spin kick!

335
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:43,298
He evades the knife and holds him.

336
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,501
He twists his arm
and goes in for a kill!

337
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,277
That's how he died.

338
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,687
Oh, that's what happened.

339
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,286
Here come Yangki and Changmu.

340
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:08,696
Look at them.
They couldn't look more scared.

341
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:14,504
After Taesik went to jail,
everybody thought...

342
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,199
...either Yangki or Changmu
would take it over.

343
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,906
But this guy named Byungjin
who limps because of Taesik...

344
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,481
...teamed up with Cho Pansu
who was a pimp then...

345
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,176
...and took over town.

346
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,081
What's going on?

347
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,689
What is it?

348
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,486
That's Cho Pansu!
That's him!

349
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,696
Byungjin was stupid.

350
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:45,895
Yangki and Changmu
alleged loyalty to Cho Pansu.

351
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:49,905
Byungjin thought
he'd be ruling the town.

352
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,100
But he thought wrong.

353
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,110
The rain is stopping.

354
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,976
It looks as if we staged this.

355
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,777
It's stopped.

356
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,078
Yeah.

357
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,182
That's what happened.

358
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,482
And he's back.

359
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:12,586
Trust me.
He'll fuck up big time soon.

360
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,396
- Get out.
- What for?

361
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,800
We'll do some interview.

362
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,805
When he first showed up,
I was so nervous.

363
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:31,279
I even prayed for him to leave.

364
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:36,376
But he begged me for a job.

365
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,989
And I couldn't say no.

366
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:42,493
I didn't want him
to hold a grudge against me.

367
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:43,787
Right.

368
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:49,093
So I thought I'd fire him
if he wasn't any good.

369
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:53,603
But he works so hard.

370
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,803
I hate those who goof around,

371
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,205
but love those hard workers.

372
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,812
Taesk is good.

373
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,881
- What about drinking?
- Right.

374
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,381
Not at all.

375
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:11,285
We all went drinking
and asked him to drink some.

376
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,685
He didn't.

377
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:16,487
He's changed. Very nice.

378
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,788
I can't believe it.

379
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,598
We're working here.

380
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,798
What's that?

381
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,502
Where are you going?

382
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,510
Have Taesik help you.

383
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,613
I'm not a slave.

384
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,476
Get back here!

385
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,884
You haven't taken care of that?

386
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,790
We're not building the mall?

387
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:58,296
We've bought all the land
around it, asshole!

388
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,804
When will the construction finish?

389
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,102
In about 3 weeks.

390
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,713
It makes me so crazy!

391
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,475
I'm gonna crazy.

392
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:15,279
Why should I step in
to get anything done?

393
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,888
Get the boys tonight.

394
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,387
Yes, sir.

395
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:26,691
When X falls in between 0 and 2,
what's g (t)?

396
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,093
It's 1.

397
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,691
When X falls between 2 and 3...

398
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:36,296
...g (t) is square (t-1).

399
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,999
Let's use the formula.

400
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:42,011
From integral 0 to 3,
gt, dt is...

401
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,480
From integral 0 to 2,
1dt plus

402
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:50,987
Integral 2 to 3 is
square (t-1) and dt.

403
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:56,082
So if you calculate this,
1 is t and o to 2...

404
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:04,996
How important do you think
infinitesimal calculus is in life?

405
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,297
That depends on
what kind of life you live.

406
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,900
For what you want in life?
You should know it.

407
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,379
What's he doing here?

408
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,480
What are you doing here?

409
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,583
You didn't come to pick me up.

410
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,989
What's that?
You'll study here?

411
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,189
You wanna go to college?

412
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,898
- Yes.
- What?

413
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,900
What for?

414
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,299
Why can't I?

415
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,499
No, I'mjust saying...

416
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,011
Sure, why not.

417
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:51,479
You can't be too old to study.
It's my bad.

418
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,277
Taking all the courses?

419
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,283
No, just English.

420
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,588
I'm good at other subjects,

421
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,489
but not English.

422
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,586
What about math?
You'll just pick answers?

423
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,599
I'm good at math.

424
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,202
You're good at math?

425
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,305
But you're dumb.

426
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,906
- Can you do integral calculus?
- Yes.

427
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,304
What?

428
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:23,005
You can do integral calculus?
Don't lie to me.

429
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,577
Taesik!

430
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,588
I went to see you in jail.

431
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,493
Why'd you refuse to see me?

432
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:44,893
Just because...

433
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,302
So you've become a teacher.

434
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,102
I wanted to see you once and for all.

435
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,079
You did? Why?

436
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,382
To tell you I'm sorry.

437
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,285
That's all?

438
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,288
Nothing else?

439
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:15,090
What else do I have to tell you
except that?

440
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,707
What are you looking at?

441
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,476
Can't you see?
Done talking to her?

442
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,882
Yes, I thought you'd be waiting.

443
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,081
Why would I wait for you?
Am I nuts?

444
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:48,090
That's a portable multimedia player.

445
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:49,494
Okay?

446
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,896
I don't know.

447
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:57,301
You can take pictures, play music,
and watch movies with it.

448
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,610
What?

449
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,974
- You're lying.
- It's true.

450
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,181
Knock it off.
What do you take me for?

451
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,485
I'm not stupid.

452
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,794
Fool!

453
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,396
- You can do integral calculus?
- Yes.

454
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,005
How do you do it?

455
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,098
Do the differential backwards.

456
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,210
I know that!

457
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,404
How do you do it backwards?

458
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,877
You just do it.

459
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,378
You!

460
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,987
What's wrong with this?
There's no taste to it.

461
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,590
It's pretty good.

462
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,194
You can eat it all.

463
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,996
Hey, check them out.

464
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,191
What?

465
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:02,695
Isn't that the girl
you have a crush on?

466
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:08,005
How do you do differentials?

467
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,807
Do integral calculus backwards.

468
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,276
Are you kidding me?

469
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,679
No, I'm...

470
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,089
Asshole!

471
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,990
Get up, asshole.
Get up.

472
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,791
Get the hell up.

473
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,997
Son of bitch!

474
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,605
You piece of shit.

475
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,680
She's mine.
I've been eyeing her for 2 years.

476
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,978
And you're hitting on her?

477
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,278
You're totally mistaken.

478
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,582
Mistaken my ass!

479
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,189
You stop me?

480
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:54,989
Cut it out!

481
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:56,794
Let go!

482
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,486
What the...

483
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,588
Stop it!

484
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,890
What's going on
between you and this ass?

485
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,600
Stop hitting him!

486
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,797
Damn, I'm pissed.

487
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,501
What should I do with him?

488
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,311
Look, asshole.

489
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,779
Ilove Huiju
See this?

490
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,579
Can you see this?

491
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:28,082
You stole money from others
and got that tattoo?

492
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,194
You're really something.

493
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,694
- What the...
- How touching.

494
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,898
You wont' see her again, right?

495
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,503
Right?

496
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,704
Huiju, you disappointed me.

497
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,403
You know! love you.

498
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,276
I don't like you!

499
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:55,682
You'll love me eventually.

500
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:03,387
Leave her alone, will you?

501
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:04,495
What?

502
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,688
What'd you just say?

503
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:11,600
You know what?
You're digging your grave.

504
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,595
Hey!

505
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,603
Sure.

506
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,002
Hey!

507
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,907
It's been a while, Huiju.

508
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,280
- I don't like you.
- I missed you, babe.

509
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,178
This is a joke.

510
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,479
Fucker!

511
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,491
Hey!

512
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,589
What?

513
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,297
It's an ointment.

514
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,205
What do you say?

515
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:31,975
Thanks.

516
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,688
Don't tell mom
what happened today.

517
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,791
I don't want her to freak out.

518
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,085
And...

519
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,995
How do you know the math teacher?

520
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,198
Long time ago...

521
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,498
You dated her?

522
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,504
I knew her.

523
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,085
Congratulations on your election
as city councilor.

524
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:17,684
Maybe you should run
for Congress.

525
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:24,099
Rushing things is never good.
One step at a time.

526
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,401
My next goal is mayor.

527
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,807
I'll serve you with my life.

528
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,309
I'm counting on you.

529
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,504
Sure.

530
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,585
Hey, Changmu.

531
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,088
Sit down and drink.

532
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:22,791
There you go, Changmu.
You're the man.

533
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,589
I like that.

534
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,897
I know you boys are busy.
I'll get to the point.

535
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,601
It's about Club Oracle.

536
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:39,906
I expect one of you boys to help me.

537
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,808
I'll do my best, sir.

538
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,783
It'll be the biggest club in town.

539
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:52,286
I have the right business mind.

540
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,889
I'll never disappoint you.

541
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,891
I have the business mind, too.

542
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,795
I'll make it full of pretty girls.

543
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:08,701
And I'll book popular singers
and comedians.

544
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,402
The most important thing is
to hire the right waiters.

545
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:19,077
I'm sure it'll do well
whoever runs it.

546
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,480
What about the Sunflower Restaurant?

547
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,284
Didn't I tell you
that I needed that land?

548
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,391
I'm doing my best.

549
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:33,990
You should've given me the job.

550
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:38,896
If she doesn't listen,
I'll bulldoze the place.

551
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,300
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

552
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,602
Yeah, you do that.

553
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:53,281
You're too soft.
Not good for the business.

554
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:01,390
Make it smooth, okay?

555
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,289
The business mind?

556
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,900
What a talker you are.

557
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,604
Oracle is mine, okay?

558
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,701
I don't know if you...

559
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,405
What?

560
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,073
Nothing.

561
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,376
I'll take care of
that restaurant...

562
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,886
...and take over Oracle.

563
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,683
Okay?

564
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,384
It's a piece of cake.

565
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:57,277
I hate those without manners.

566
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,277
Go say hello.

567
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,576
Okay.

568
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,397
Taesik!

569
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,007
Stop it, guys!
Stop it!

570
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,704
They're your boys?

571
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,708
- Well...
- Why?

572
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,678
What are you doing here?

573
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,877
Why?

574
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,877
It's just...

575
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,889
Leave.
It's my mother's place.

576
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,083
Your mother's?

577
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:44,788
What are you doing?

578
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,597
- Taesik.
- Leave.

579
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,400
Don't get me wrong.

580
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,699
Leave.

581
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,506
Okay, I'll leave.

582
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:00,803
Let's go.

583
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,573
Shit, I almost got fucked.

584
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,080
Come on, let's go!

585
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,581
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

586
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,083
What did they want?

587
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:20,390
You don't need to know.
It's nothing.

588
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,994
You know Taesik was there.

589
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:29,503
You wanted me to get fucked?

590
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,108
You never listen to me.

591
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,604
I should fucking kill you.

592
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,978
Watch your mouth, asshole.

593
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,879
What the fuck!

594
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,280
What's important is...

595
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:50,385
...what he has in mind, okay?

596
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,688
You think he's back for nothing?

597
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,795
What if he's with the Mob
from Seoul...

598
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,701
...and wants to take over
our town?

599
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,597
Even Mr. Cho can't stop him.

600
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,107
If so, we're screwed.

601
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,905
But I'm friends with him.

602
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:14,883
How many times
did you visit him in jail?

603
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,086
Not once, right?

604
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:22,491
I did 5 times for 10 years.

605
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,490
You call yourself a friend?

606
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,599
Fuck you.

607
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:36,504
I heard you, asshole.

608
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,570
Didn't he say he would destroy it?

609
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,478
What the hell did he do?

610
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:50,186
Sir, there's a problem.

611
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,378
What?

612
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,286
You should know, too.

613
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,086
Go ahead.

614
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,491
Neither Changmu nor Yangki
can touch that place...

615
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,996
...because of Oh Taesik.

616
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,690
Who's that?

617
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,696
Don't you remember?

618
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,398
Oh Taesik from 10 years ago.

619
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,906
One who whacked Dopil?

620
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:24,179
He's back in town
and you didn't tell me?

621
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:28,883
Keeping an eye on him...

622
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,391
...to see...

623
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,686
...what cards he has hidden...

624
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,301
...to put on the table?

625
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,403
That's not it.

626
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,198
No?

627
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,705
We've been watching him.

628
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,310
- He's done with this field...
- This field?

629
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:49,105
What's wrong with this field?

630
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,774
What's wrong with it?

631
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,885
Help yourself.

632
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:02,192
He's tougher than he looks.
Be nice.

633
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:03,988
Come here, eat.

634
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,898
You do integral calculus well?

635
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:13,093
- A little bit.
- You said you were good at it.

636
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,500
lam.

637
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,898
This is how it works.

638
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,509
I can't believe this.

639
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:25,074
You didn't finish high school
and are better than me.

640
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:31,786
When I was in jail,
there was this math teacher.

641
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:37,290
He started teaching me
to kill time.

642
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:41,293
I was a cell leader,
and he was nice to me.

643
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:46,300
So he was like your tutor.

644
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,801
Right.

645
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,599
I see.

646
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,408
But no English teacher?

647
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:55,011
I waited for one, but none came.

648
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:00,272
What did that teacher do?

649
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,580
He took kickbacks from parents?

650
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,984
You don't need to know.

651
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:08,591
Tell me, or I'll hit you.

652
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,593
- Adultery.
- Adultery?

653
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,891
You know love is no sin.

654
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,707
What's integral calculus?

655
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,707
Doing differential backwards.

656
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,906
Give me a break.

657
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:34,880
How come I understand differential...

658
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,486
...not integral calculus?

659
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,580
Being dumb...

660
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:44,585
It's a sin and makes others suffer.

661
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:50,396
What the... Is that a joke?

662
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,297
You're laughing at me?

663
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,997
You think you're something
because you're better at math?

664
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,197
No.

665
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,302
I'm sorry I was nice to you.

666
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,309
And don't smile like that.

667
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,471
Looking stupid is your concept,
isn't it?

668
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,873
What's that?

669
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,382
You don't know?

670
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,178
Oh, you don't know English.

671
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:17,792
You're dead.
Go get an English book!

672
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,498
Not studying?

673
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,895
Idid.

674
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,706
Listen to yourself.

675
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,207
You can never study enough.

676
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:38,576
Without studying hard,
you can't make it in life.

677
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,276
Mother?

678
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:44,285
Taesik, what is it?

679
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,690
Can I come in?

680
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:49,587
Sure, come in.

681
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,293
Sit here.

682
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:01,000
What's going on?
What is that?

683
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:07,299
I got my first paycheck today.

684
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,912
So I bought you something.

685
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:19,381
You should've saved it
for your future.

686
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,585
- What is it?
- Don't touch it.

687
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,696
I've never done this before.

688
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,704
I don't know if you like them.

689
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:43,107
God...

690
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,776
How could I wear these?

691
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,482
Thank you.

692
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:56,784
No, I owe you so much.
Thank you.

693
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,710
Let me give you...

694
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:34,188
When will I get a job...

695
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,799
...and do what he did?

696
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,401
Damn, I should age fast.

697
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,906
I told you not to come up here.

698
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,307
Should I leave?

699
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,676
You can have your smoke.

700
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,785
Trying to suck up to both
mother and daughter?

701
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:11,594
Mom promised to buy me this.

702
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,094
Fine then.

703
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,797
You can watch TV on it.

704
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,109
I'm going.

705
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,801
Smoke.

706
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,310
Iquit.

707
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,675
Why?

708
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,373
You hate the smell.

709
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,378
Huh?

710
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,977
You're quite character.
My gift...

711
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:41,487
Buying gifts

712
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,682
So that's it?

713
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,295
That's what it is.

714
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,392
Come here.

715
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,099
You're so cute.

716
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,501
What?

717
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,205
That's a dragon.

718
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:04,470
And a bamboo.

719
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:05,882
Oh Taesik

720
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,985
What's this?

721
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,381
Huiju, no!

722
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,078
Let me see.

723
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:15,680
'I won't drink.'
'I won't fight.‘

724
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,292
'I won't cry.'

725
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,285
Mom gave you this?

726
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,592
She's really something.

727
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,876
This is so funny.

728
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,277
'Peeing on the street.
Getting full from coke.‘

729
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,185
'Getting hair dyed.‘

730
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:56,587
They're all boring.

731
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,694
- Give it back.
- Wait.

732
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,390
What's this?

733
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:04,698
'Kissing my breath out.'

734
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:12,504
Fine, I'll give you this one.

735
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:16,877
Here!

736
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,580
Going on a picnic

737
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:29,687
Closed.

738
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,180
It's ripe.

739
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:07,989
I finally got to understand
integral calculus.

740
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:11,589
You said you hated math
because of that.

741
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:15,296
Taesik taught me how to do it.

742
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,404
He taught you?

743
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,203
He's good at math.
