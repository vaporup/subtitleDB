1
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:26,869
Sonpyong 1975

2
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:40,183
I'm not supposed to be wasting
my time on a rabbit drumstick.

3
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,120
Here, have the front legs then.

4
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:03,308
Eun-ji.

5
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:08,578
There's an old saying that says
send horses to an open plain,

6
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:11,317
and send people to big cities.

7
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:14,987
In short, whether
you're human or animal,

8
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,221
you need to get out in the
open and mix with the crowd.

9
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:18,725
So we're going to Seoul?

10
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:21,660
Catch what I'm saying here.

11
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:25,802
Not us, me.

12
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:30,003
I don't know who said it,

13
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:31,566
but I sure have respect for the guy.

14
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:35,471
And that's why I need
to get out of here.

15
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:38,812
This place isn't
for YOUN Min-jae.

16
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:40,785
You understand, right?

17
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:46,315
Why do you always have
to cry like that?

18
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:00,335
I swear on this snow.

19
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,208
I'll be back in a year on
a snowy day like today.

20
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:11,645
You trust me, right?

21
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:17,079
Look. You trust me, right?
You know how true our love is.

22
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,664
How do you do?

23
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,434
Go home.

24
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:40,341
The shades aren't too dark?

25
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:41,777
They're just fine.

26
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,782
I told you.

27
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:55,956
What are you doing?

28
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,255
Your collars are up.

29
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,556
Get with it.

30
00:03:58,665 --> 00:04:00,292
This is a fad in Seoul.

31
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:06,529
What?

32
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:12,638
I'm just worried.

33
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:14,176
About what?

34
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:20,384
Girls in Seoul will
all chase after you.

35
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:27,684
Eun-ji, you're more beautiful
than most girls in Seoul.

36
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,092
All they have is make-up.

37
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:44,268
Have a good day.

38
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,879
Go home now, I'll see you.

39
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,685
I'll see you soon, okay?

40
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,663
You have to let go.
There's nothing in it.

41
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,429
Let go.

42
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:14,301
The train's here.
Let go.

43
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:19,274
I'm leaving to better my life.
What are you doing?

44
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:22,907
Come on, please.

45
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:25,813
Eun-ji, let go.

46
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:42,493
Min-jae, Min-jae.

47
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:44,966
Don't worry. Just go home.

48
00:05:46,506 --> 00:05:48,303
I'll come back looking good,

49
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,074
- Min-jae
- so don't worry and go home

50
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:55,245
Eun-ji, don't worry
and just go, okay?

51
00:05:58,284 --> 00:06:00,377
I'll be waiting for you.

52
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,419
Just go now.

53
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:09,285
I'll be waiting for you.

54
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:37,482
1980

55
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:48,458
Hey Axe, didn't I tell you
to get out of my way?

56
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:09,746
Come on, just let me go.

57
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,121
Let me go!

58
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:49,727
Boss, I'm here.

59
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,288
Boss!

60
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:54,532
It's me, Min-jae.

61
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:58,662
Relax. Calm down and come sit.

62
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:09,741
What did you tell me
when we first met?

63
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,909
You said you wanted to
live in style, right?

64
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,580
And that's why you said you
wanted to become a gangster.

65
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:19,857
And now you want out?
You'll just leave us?

66
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:22,589
Why?

67
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:25,822
I thought I'd live in style
if I worked for you.

68
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,426
But evidently, there's no style.
I want to end my thug life here.

69
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:34,405
So then what? What will you do?

70
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,603
I'm going to become a philanderer.

71
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:41,813
I'm going to seduce rich women
and get them to pay up.

72
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:46,349
You may go now.

73
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:48,147
- Boss!
- Just go.

74
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:55,360
Thank you, boss.

75
00:08:57,563 --> 00:08:59,588
One more thing, Min-jae.

76
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:05,164
I could careless if you become
a philanderer or a playboy.

77
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:09,999
Just don't tell anyone
you worked for me.

78
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:13,840
It's a goddamn shame.

79
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:28,291
Boss, you sure you should
let him go like that?

80
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:31,522
He's a catch, but he's
no thug material.

81
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:34,164
The kid has too much heart.

82
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:40,904
Sister dear...

83
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,074
Love is eternal.

84
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:47,509
Imagine if there were
no love in our lives.

85
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,915
I just can't stand people
that try to buy love.

86
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:58,279
- Sister.
- Yeah?

87
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:00,953
You believe in love, right?

88
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:10,597
- Thanks.
- What for?

89
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,160
You're right.

90
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,968
Love is eternal.

91
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:17,933
I must've lost it.

92
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:21,441
My husband didn't
hit me out of hate.

93
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,912
It was probably all out of love.

94
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:29,350
And he probably stomped on me

95
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:31,719
without knowing that it was me.

96
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:33,753
He probably knew.

97
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:37,152
Thanks to you,
I regained my rationality.

98
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:39,025
Thank you so much.

99
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:42,362
- No, you see...
- Have a good life, honey.

100
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:43,365
Sister.

101
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:47,565
It's way too late.
I need to go fix him dinner.

102
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,001
Wait, I didn't have dinner either.

103
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:56,304
Fuck.

104
00:10:56,482 --> 00:11:01,419
You're no good as a philanderer.

105
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:04,717
You should become a
marriage counselor.

106
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:06,189
Shut up.

107
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:10,685
You need to stop
that love bull shit.

108
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:13,988
Just get straight to the point.

109
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,262
And look, if you're trying
to play the game,

110
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,669
You don't want to be all nice.

111
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:24,436
Get to the point.

112
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:27,077
I got some good stuff.
Wanna check it out?

113
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:29,511
Thought I almost had it this time.

114
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:32,049
- It doesn't hurt to look.
- Hey, Dong-shik.

115
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:35,119
I'm just trying to be a
humane philanderer, you know.

116
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:36,745
I mean, being a philanderer is a
service-centric profession.

117
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:39,154
But then we got all these
inhumane suckers, you know.

118
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:41,749
Especially for you two, I'm
willing to offer you the best,

119
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:43,351
and the most advanced, you know?

120
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:45,795
- Get out.
- For almost nothing.

121
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,196
I said, leave.

122
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:49,757
Good day.

123
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,731
Just watch.
I'll get another chance.

124
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,901
Sure.
That's what dreams are for.

125
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:01,139
I'm telling you.

126
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:07,413
I'll find someone, hit it big,
and live in style.

127
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:08,883
You'll see.

128
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:19,294
Hey, Dong-shik.

129
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:24,834
I'll show you how it's done today.

130
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,298
She's mine.

131
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:39,682
It'd be great if you could help,
but if not, I have a plan.

132
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:43,544
Just remember when you
first came to our store.

133
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:48,283
If I blurt it out, you know
your old man won't be happy.

134
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:54,429
We'll talk over a drink.

135
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:08,002
What an honor to be getting
a drink from Hae-mi.

136
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:18,583
That's for your medical bill.

137
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:22,590
If you're thinking the
old Hae-mi, think again.

138
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,657
I make a call, you're dead.

139
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:27,590
Keep calling if you want
money for medical bills.

140
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,361
I can't pay you a penny
other than medical expense.

141
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,129
You bitch!
Since when did you...

142
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:36,208
turn all arrogant and
condescending.

143
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:40,568
You fuckin' whore!

144
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:43,978
Who the hell are you?

145
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,708
Fuck...

146
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,110
Let's run, ma'am!

147
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:53,215
Get him!

148
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:47,068
It should be safe here.
This place is temporarily closed.

149
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,609
You're all wet.

150
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:18,436
Ma'am, if it weren't for me today,
you would've gotten in big trouble.

151
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:22,970
Choi back there... he's known
for beating women.

152
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:28,249
Anyway, he must've
really loved you, huh?

153
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,752
Stupid bastard.

154
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:39,155
Ma'am, love is eternal.

155
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,795
Imagine if there were
no love in our lives.

156
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:47,772
You believe in love, right?

157
00:15:51,176 --> 00:15:52,200
Ma'am!

158
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:55,344
Well... uhhh...

159
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:01,278
You!

160
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:03,452
All you do is rip off women?

161
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:05,987
I don't rip off anything.

162
00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:09,654
You said you would go
hit it big in Seoul.

163
00:16:12,164 --> 00:16:13,563
And all you are is a philanderer?

164
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,992
What did you used to tell me?

165
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:18,601
Wait, because you'll be back?

166
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:21,667
It's been five years since you left.

167
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:30,939
Eun-ji. It's really you, huh?

168
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,847
Wait a second. Is it really you?

169
00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:37,885
Was it that hard to make a call?

170
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:40,187
No...

171
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,318
I never crossed your mind?

172
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,793
Of course, I did.

173
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:48,893
I thought you were dead.

174
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:52,729
You know what, it would've been better
if you were dead. What's this now?

175
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:55,806
Well... I thought of killing myself.

176
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:58,669
But it's me we're talking about.
You know, YOUN Min-jae. Remember?

177
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:01,736
I wanted to hit it big and live
with you till death do us part.

178
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:03,772
Has it really been five years?

179
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:09,510
One thing though, do you have
to be that rude to me?

180
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:10,952
What's wrong, Eun-ji?

181
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:20,598
I'm OH Hae-mi. The Eun-ji you
know died five years ago.

182
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:22,923
What? Eun-ji?

183
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:24,364
Hey, Eun-ji.

184
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:32,469
Eun-ji, you can't just
leave like this.

185
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:36,106
Let's talk and catch up.

186
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:42,543
Hey, Eun-ji. Locked, huh?

187
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:51,424
Hey, roll down the
window for a sec.

188
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:57,358
Eun-ji!
Come on, roll down the window!

189
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:34,904
I swear on this snow.

190
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,909
I'll be back in a year on
a snowy day like today.

191
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:45,106
Eun-ji!
Don't worry. Just go home.

192
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:48,846
I'll come back looking good,
so don't worry and go home.

193
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:52,081
Eun-ji, don't worry
and just go, okay?

194
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,963
Let me get another bottle please.

195
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:01,965
That's enough.

196
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,394
I won't put it on the tab, don't worry.

197
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:20,784
Sir, how about a shoe shine?

198
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:21,942
No thanks, I'm good.

199
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,387
Come on, I'll shine them
real good. Give it a try.

200
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,980
I said, no thanks.

201
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:29,489
Come on, you know you want it.

202
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:32,563
I got some good stuff here.
Want to take a look?

203
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:37,593
- I'll make it shine like a mirror.
- It doesn't hurt to look.

204
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,194
You bastards. Don't you see I'm
trying to get some reading done?

205
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:47,440
Hold on, who might this be?

206
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:52,076
Do you know me?

207
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:55,944
I had dreams about you,
and you don't remember me?

208
00:19:56,888 --> 00:19:59,049
I think you're mistaken.

209
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:01,950
You're Gwang-pal from
Kyungsang province alright.

210
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,721
It's me. WANG Do-chul from Cholla.

211
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:08,626
I'm not CHO Gwang-pal.

212
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,471
Hey, low-life.

213
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:28,579
You ruined my life and
you don't remember me?

214
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,587
You stinking bastard.

215
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:33,489
Relax, Do-chul, will you?

216
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,992
It really wasn't my fault.
I got the stuff all for you.

217
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:42,658
I didn't know that it would
have side-effects like that.

218
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:44,929
Do-chul, I'm trying to
move on with my life now.

219
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:49,838
I even have a wife
with a baby inside.

220
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:52,943
So you were living happily while
my family was getting screwed.

221
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:57,447
No, man. I'm barely getting by.

222
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,210
You bastard!

223
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:03,416
Do you know what happened to my dick
after I took the pills you sold me?

224
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:07,690
It won't get hard and it's
been sleeping ever since.

225
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:08,884
It's sleeping?

226
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:11,359
- It won't get up.
- Really?

227
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,963
- No more erection.
- None?

228
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:15,691
I turn impotent overnight.

229
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:19,598
My wife hits it off with
this guy next door.

230
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:23,135
I'd have to kill you to make up
for what I've been through.

231
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,469
Anyway, you're dead today.

232
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,338
Come here!

233
00:21:25,444 --> 00:21:29,574
Hey, drugs cause different
reactions on different people.

234
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:30,443
What?

235
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:33,215
Don't come near me.
I'm gonna run.

236
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:35,546
How fast do you run
a hundred meters?

237
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,013
Thirteen seconds.

238
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:38,688
I can do that in twelve seconds flat.

239
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:41,816
I ask for your mercy, man.

240
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,990
That's not happening.

241
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,324
Fuck!

242
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:55,473
You stinking bastard!

243
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,296
Congratulations, sir!

244
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:27,897
Colonel, it's about time you
find the right woman, sir.

245
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:33,443
Your nephew's had enough hard work.

246
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,810
That's right. That's right.

247
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:41,611
Tell him to come in.

248
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:45,948
Is someone here?

249
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:48,753
They sent someone from
the 32nd division.

250
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:51,727
Isn't that the Samchung Revival Camp?

251
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:56,363
I guess he's in a
hurry for relocation.

252
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,171
Captain Hwang from
32nd division, sir.

253
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:08,810
Happy birthday, sir.

254
00:23:08,947 --> 00:23:10,812
Leave your gift there and leave.

255
00:23:19,324 --> 00:23:22,487
Hey, where are you from?

256
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,261
What, sir?

257
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:28,658
Where were you educated?

258
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:30,899
United Armed Forces academy, sir.

259
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:32,134
UAF?

260
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:40,937
No wonder he's running errands
with a captain rank.

261
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:47,215
I don't think where you come from
is important as a soldier.

262
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,253
- How dare you...
- Wait, wait...

263
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:57,751
Then, what do you
think is important?

264
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:02,522
It's one's patriotism
for his country, sir.

265
00:24:04,202 --> 00:24:05,897
That's respectable.

266
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:13,010
I should have someone
like that under me.

267
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:23,884
Since you came, have some
dinner before you go.

268
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:27,618
This is no place for him to join.

269
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:28,920
No, no.

270
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:31,886
Since you're here already,
eat before you go.

271
00:24:36,835 --> 00:24:39,030
Wash your face with this.

272
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:36,987
There's a guest.

273
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,923
He said he was a hometown friend.

274
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,759
Eun-ji.

275
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,866
Holy cow.

276
00:25:52,978 --> 00:25:53,842
What brings you here?

277
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,536
You can go now.

278
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,975
This house is awesome.

279
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:00,615
What's this here?

280
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,187
Are you crazy?
Where do you think this is?

281
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,815
What? I'm just here to
visit an old friend.

282
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:09,924
What happened to you?

283
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:11,891
Did you find a gold
mine or something?

284
00:26:11,963 --> 00:26:13,954
How did you find me?

285
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:16,524
It's not too hard.

286
00:26:16,735 --> 00:26:21,069
How many people in Korea do you
think drive fancy cars like that?

287
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:24,102
Hey, Eun-ji, those are all
expensive stuff, huh?

288
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:27,878
Are theses antiques?

289
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:39,519
Eun-ji, are these real gold?
You found a gold mine, didn't you?

290
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:44,318
With just a few of these,
you could live in style.

291
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,827
You want them?

292
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:50,192
Of course.

293
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,801
Then take them.

294
00:26:55,674 --> 00:27:00,475
Really?
You sure I can take these?

295
00:27:00,612 --> 00:27:02,876
As long as you don't get caught.

296
00:27:03,515 --> 00:27:05,449
Who's going to catch me?

297
00:27:09,554 --> 00:27:15,390
Don't you want to know
who the owner is?

298
00:27:15,694 --> 00:27:16,626
No.

299
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:23,099
It's someone that can easily
kill any one of us instantly.

300
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:25,466
Then don't tell him.

301
00:27:27,305 --> 00:27:28,704
Then take them.

302
00:27:32,377 --> 00:27:41,513
I'm really taking them, okay?
What the hell, why not?

303
00:27:53,164 --> 00:28:02,630
Fuck it. I'm not taking them.

304
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:08,802
If I take them and go into hiding,

305
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,071
they'll never find me as you said.

306
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:16,317
But then, what's going
to happen to you?

307
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:21,850
You said the guy can kill any one of us,

308
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:25,654
so that includes you too, right?

309
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:34,067
I'm okay, but you shouldn't
get hurt because of me.

310
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:39,770
You look really good.
Look at where you're living.

311
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:45,743
You have a slick car and everything.
Don't get in trouble because of me.

312
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:49,376
You need to learn, girl.

313
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:55,090
Anyway, this is some
style we got here.

314
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:21,675
What brings you home at this hour?

315
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:25,378
I was nearby.
Just wanted to get changed.

316
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:28,219
Ummm... the thing is...

317
00:29:30,461 --> 00:29:31,985
Take my clothes first.

318
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:39,594
Are you still smoking?

319
00:30:12,237 --> 00:30:13,795
What did I tell you?

320
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:21,512
I said bad habits are
better rid than done!

321
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:34,383
Once you taste something new,
you forget the value of the old.

322
00:31:39,257 --> 00:31:41,282
Don't go anywhere and stay home.

323
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:58,230
Eun-ji.

324
00:32:00,912 --> 00:32:04,814
Eun-ji, look, you okay?

325
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,014
Eun-ji.

326
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:08,641
Just go.

327
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:12,020
What's going on?
Talk to me.

328
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,355
Just go.

329
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,788
Eun-ji, wake up.
What's going on?

330
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,625
Please go.

331
00:32:20,932 --> 00:32:24,299
You're in danger, go.

332
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:25,461
Eun-ji.

333
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:33,273
I'm begging you.
Just leave.

334
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:35,740
You can't stay here.
Just go.

335
00:32:35,847 --> 00:32:37,041
Eun-ji.

336
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:39,814
Please.

337
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,619
Come on, go. Please go.
You gotta go.

338
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:50,717
Go.

339
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:57,528
Min-jae, go.

340
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:28,326
So you're home, huh?

341
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:31,662
Remember me?

342
00:33:32,036 --> 00:33:35,437
You know, the day you threw
noodle soup at me.

343
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:38,142
Look at what you did.

344
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,910
How is it?
Looks good, right?

345
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,254
Why don't you try running again?

346
00:33:52,623 --> 00:33:54,181
Now that I know where you live.

347
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:57,386
Couldn't you forgive me?

348
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,695
You little piss ass.

349
00:34:01,632 --> 00:34:03,224
My dick's dead.

350
00:34:03,768 --> 00:34:05,736
So now it's your turn.

351
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:07,398
You dog!

352
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:12,201
They call me bulldog.

353
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:15,841
Dear...

354
00:34:16,414 --> 00:34:22,046
Stop right there!

355
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:27,981
Stop, you fool!

356
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,622
Stop!

357
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:33,055
I said, stop.

358
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,234
Stop.

359
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:47,176
Get him!

360
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,242
Hey!

361
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,013
Move!

362
00:34:57,355 --> 00:35:01,985
Sir, listen.
Please help.

363
00:35:02,093 --> 00:35:04,994
What are you two?

364
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,655
Excuse me.

365
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:11,268
I just need to get him.
So just do as you were.

366
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:12,859
- Come here.
- What?

367
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:16,832
I just have a personal business
with this guy to take care of.

368
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:17,737
Come here!

369
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:19,904
Crazy fucks.

370
00:35:20,845 --> 00:35:24,337
I think your expression
is a little excessive.

371
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:28,518
Don't you know where
this bus is headed to?

372
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,283
This bus is going to
the Samchung Revival Camp.

373
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,789
Fine.
Just take me anywhere, but here.

374
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,462
I don't care what camp it is,
just take me.

375
00:35:38,462 --> 00:35:39,895
Revival sounds good.

376
00:35:39,997 --> 00:35:41,521
You bastard.

377
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,627
Either you let the both of
us go, or take both of us.

378
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:49,668
I'm not leaving this bus without him.

379
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:51,264
Fuckin' assholes.
Kill them!

380
00:36:18,936 --> 00:36:22,167
Do you like it?

381
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:36,120
You can never leave
me unless I dump you.

382
00:37:27,672 --> 00:37:29,037
Eun-ji!

383
00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:35,668
Are you crazy?
What are you doing here?

384
00:37:36,614 --> 00:37:37,581
Follow me.

385
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:58,093
I'm sorry.
Only if I hadn't showed up.

386
00:38:11,282 --> 00:38:17,221
It hurt a lot, right?
What does he do anyway?

387
00:38:17,355 --> 00:38:19,789
Why do you have to live
with a guy like that?

388
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:27,221
Two years after you left for Seoul,

389
00:38:28,866 --> 00:38:33,235
everyone in town left because
an army base was moving in.

390
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:46,211
That's when Butcher Pal-bong offered
to find you for me in Seoul.

391
00:38:50,187 --> 00:38:51,381
And?

392
00:38:51,822 --> 00:39:01,390
The day we came to Seoul, Pal-bong
sold me to a Geisha house and left.

393
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:08,004
Pal-bong... fuckin'
asshole... fuck.

394
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:15,238
It's all my fault.

395
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:30,759
Then I was introduced to this soldier
who said he could find you.

396
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:37,829
He said he could find you for sure.

397
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,838
I was stupid for believing him.

398
00:39:58,456 --> 00:40:06,693
If I had known the shore was this
close, I would've came already.

399
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,127
It's great here.

400
00:40:36,861 --> 00:40:42,527
Thank you god for
finding Min-jae.

401
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:02,081
Eun-ji.

402
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,646
Hey.

403
00:41:06,056 --> 00:41:06,920
Eun-ji!

404
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:08,053
Eun-ji!

405
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:09,284
Eun-ji!

406
00:41:14,698 --> 00:41:16,495
Are you here for Hae-mi?

407
00:41:19,136 --> 00:41:21,570
She's been shocked by a
sudden external impact.

408
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:23,931
She needs to rest.

409
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,161
What now?

410
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:56,967
What about it?

411
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:03,443
Isn't it pretty?

412
00:42:05,182 --> 00:42:06,308
It doesn't sting?

413
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:10,711
For me.

414
00:42:10,888 --> 00:42:12,412
I'll go with this one.

415
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:16,584
Get him the butterfly just like me.

416
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:20,892
Butterflies aren't for men.

417
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:26,092
But it's something to remember
me by when you go to Seoul.

418
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:31,798
Christ... Well then.

419
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,900
This one's okay, I guess.

420
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:36,271
Happy?

421
00:42:40,651 --> 00:42:47,215
Why do you have to cry like that?
Okay, okay.

422
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:50,426
Let me get the same one.

423
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,722
Min-jae.

424
00:43:28,165 --> 00:43:34,661
They said you'll be okay
if you get some rest.

425
00:43:35,105 --> 00:43:42,477
I'm really not the old Eun-ji.

426
00:43:44,348 --> 00:43:49,153
I've changed a lot.

427
00:43:49,153 --> 00:43:55,558
That's okay, Eun-ji.

428
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:59,087
Can you forgive me?

429
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,126
You didn't do anything wrong.
There's nothing to forgive.

430
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:05,901
I'm the one that should be
asking for forgiveness.

431
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:10,672
Can you keep a promise?

432
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:21,149
Don't go anywhere and
let's run away together.

433
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:37,667
Okay, okay. I won't ever leave
you until death do us part.

434
00:44:40,237 --> 00:44:42,296
You said you liked the sea, right?

435
00:44:42,906 --> 00:44:47,070
We'll live in a place with a sea view.

436
00:44:48,746 --> 00:44:51,442
I'm talking about where
we're going to live.

437
00:44:52,549 --> 00:45:02,117
With huge palm trees and a hammock,
sipping freshly squeezed juice.

438
00:45:03,527 --> 00:45:04,960
That's right!

439
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:11,727
We'll put up a camp fire and

440
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:18,001
cook up rabbit like before.

441
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:22,111
Let's do that, okay?

442
00:45:23,247 --> 00:45:24,737
Let's live like that, Eun-ji.

443
00:46:07,357 --> 00:46:08,324
Sit.

444
00:46:09,092 --> 00:46:10,024
Yes, sir.

445
00:46:19,002 --> 00:46:21,163
Why did you want to see me?

446
00:46:22,573 --> 00:46:24,837
I want to become one
of your men, colonel.

447
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:33,706
What did you say was the most
important thing as a soldier?

448
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:36,649
I said patriotism, sir.

449
00:46:37,154 --> 00:46:41,352
Then, where should you be
showing your patriotism to?

450
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,415
My country, sir.

451
00:46:44,795 --> 00:46:46,524
Your country, huh?

452
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:50,689
Let me ask that again.

453
00:46:53,704 --> 00:46:55,467
Where should you be showing
your patriotism to?

454
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,144
You, sir.

455
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:05,108
Hey!

456
00:47:05,816 --> 00:47:08,910
You're really giving me
these clothes, right?

457
00:47:09,186 --> 00:47:10,949
Yes.

458
00:47:12,155 --> 00:47:15,989
Are you serious about leaving?

459
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:18,590
You don't need to know.

460
00:47:19,096 --> 00:47:23,192
I'm going to go live in style
with Eun-ji in a remote place.

461
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:26,896
Live happily ever after,
you son of a bitch.

462
00:47:27,204 --> 00:47:28,102
I'm out.

463
00:47:28,205 --> 00:47:29,263
See ya.

464
00:47:32,843 --> 00:47:35,573
YOUN Min-jae.
Take him.

465
00:47:35,746 --> 00:47:38,415
What's wrong?
What is it?

466
00:47:38,415 --> 00:47:40,076
What the hell?

467
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,481
Get off of me.

468
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,746
What are you doing?

469
00:47:44,855 --> 00:47:45,844
Let's go.

470
00:47:45,923 --> 00:47:50,724
Hey, Dong-shik.
What's wrong? Off of me.

471
00:47:52,429 --> 00:47:56,798
Dong-shik, Dong-shik!
What is this?

472
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:08,743
No, I'm not.

473
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:13,475
YOUN Min-jae.
Odaesan crime family member.

474
00:48:15,118 --> 00:48:19,817
Okay, okay.
I'm one of them,

475
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:24,818
are you happy now?
Now let me go.

476
00:48:25,062 --> 00:48:28,031
Eun-ji's waiting for me.

477
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:31,794
I said Eun-ji's waiting for me,
you son of a bitch!

478
00:49:15,645 --> 00:49:20,480
Hey, Do-chul, I guess this is it.

479
00:49:20,617 --> 00:49:24,576
I feel like I'm back in the army.

480
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:27,280
It can't be as bad as the army.

481
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:28,187
You never know.

482
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:31,727
I bet this place is way
worse than the army.

483
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:34,963
As far as I know
it could be worse than the army.

484
00:49:35,132 --> 00:49:37,293
Look at their eyes, man.

485
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:40,998
Did I ask you?

486
00:49:41,638 --> 00:49:47,099
I'm just trying to be
nice to you boys.

487
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,575
Show some respect, will you?

488
00:49:48,678 --> 00:49:50,873
- Who do you think you are?
- What?

489
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:54,550
Hey, dip shits.
Just shut the fuck up.

490
00:49:54,618 --> 00:49:55,607
What are you on a picnic?

491
00:49:55,786 --> 00:49:57,811
Fuck.

492
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:03,493
You suckers.

493
00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:47,794
You'll repeat what I say.

494
00:50:47,904 --> 00:50:52,000
Trainee rule of conduct Number one.
I'll do as told.

495
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:55,512
One, I'll do as told!

496
00:50:55,512 --> 00:50:59,539
Two!
I'll take all beatings.

497
00:50:59,683 --> 00:51:03,175
Two, I'll take all beatings!

498
00:51:03,286 --> 00:51:07,086
Three!
I'll eat as served.

499
00:51:10,994 --> 00:51:16,455
Take off everything you're wearing
except your skin and bone.

500
00:51:16,533 --> 00:51:18,902
You have ten seconds.
Execute!

501
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:20,460
Execute!

502
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,735
Take off your watches,
necklaces, and rings.

503
00:51:43,326 --> 00:51:44,657
Freeze!

504
00:51:45,095 --> 00:51:52,331
Freeze! You will salute the
commander with 'Allegiance'.

505
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:55,902
Salute like a man, and bellow
forth your 'Allegiance'.

506
00:51:55,972 --> 00:51:58,065
- Got that?
- Yes, sir!

507
00:51:59,376 --> 00:52:04,939
Now only put on your pants.
Execute!

508
00:52:13,123 --> 00:52:15,057
Salute to the commander.

509
00:52:15,158 --> 00:52:17,149
Allegiance!

510
00:52:19,763 --> 00:52:21,025
Allegiance!

511
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:22,654
Allegiance!

512
00:52:23,633 --> 00:52:24,964
At ease.

513
00:52:27,637 --> 00:52:32,074
Most of you were delinquents
in the real world.

514
00:52:35,078 --> 00:52:41,244
Our society will no longer
tolerate people like you.

515
00:52:41,551 --> 00:52:45,988
With regards to this, the army
has decided to help you revive

516
00:52:46,056 --> 00:52:47,683
into a worthy human being.

517
00:52:50,193 --> 00:52:53,287
The program will last for weeks

518
00:52:54,364 --> 00:53:02,464
with its focus on rebuilding
your body, spirit, and mind.

519
00:53:03,173 --> 00:53:07,234
I'm Captain HWANG Gi-duk,
your unit commander.

520
00:53:08,411 --> 00:53:16,341
I hope you'll follow your
instructors' lead without trouble.

521
00:53:17,621 --> 00:53:19,589
Salute to the commander.

522
00:53:19,723 --> 00:53:21,350
Allegiance!

523
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:22,951
Allegiance!

524
00:53:29,299 --> 00:53:30,926
Stay still!

525
00:53:54,457 --> 00:53:58,018
Can you please leave that?

526
00:53:58,128 --> 00:53:59,652
Shut up.

527
00:54:00,797 --> 00:54:05,166
Can't believe you're cutting it.

528
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:07,029
I said, shut up.

529
00:54:07,137 --> 00:54:08,627
It hurts.

530
00:54:08,705 --> 00:54:10,036
Next.

531
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,708
You don't have anything
to cut, asshole.

532
00:54:21,618 --> 00:54:23,313
Dreaming of Miss Yang from
Daemyung adult barbershop.

533
00:54:23,453 --> 00:54:25,318
Shut up and get out.

534
00:54:32,962 --> 00:54:36,921
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

535
00:54:50,513 --> 00:54:53,038
You're dead once
we're out of here.

536
00:54:54,284 --> 00:54:58,778
You think they'll
let us out to eat?

537
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:02,688
How can you be fuckin'
hungry right now?

538
00:55:02,826 --> 00:55:06,387
You stupid bastard.

539
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:11,632
I'm cold and hungry, man. Shit.

540
00:55:22,912 --> 00:55:28,214
Patience, Reflection,
Patience, Reflection,

541
00:55:28,451 --> 00:55:34,185
Patience, Reflection,
Patience, Reflection,

542
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,472
Hae-mi?

543
00:56:32,582 --> 00:56:33,913
Who are you?

544
00:56:34,384 --> 00:56:36,784
I'll explain that to you later.

545
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,854
I have something to tell you.

546
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:41,022
You know Min-jae, right?

547
00:56:41,925 --> 00:56:43,517
You know, YOUN Min-jae.

548
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:50,959
That's right.

549
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:53,601
A bunch of soldiers dragged
him away that day and

550
00:56:53,703 --> 00:56:57,264
next thing I know, I get
this notice in the mail.

551
00:56:57,707 --> 00:57:01,336
But you see, the Samchung Revival
Camp is supposed to be way more

552
00:57:01,444 --> 00:57:07,576
than four weeks of
revival training.

553
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:10,345
They say it could take anywhere
from six months to a year.

554
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,514
Once you're in,

555
00:57:13,623 --> 00:57:16,854
they don't let you out safe

556
00:57:20,964 --> 00:57:28,530
can prepare about ten grand,
he may be able to work something out.

557
00:57:29,372 --> 00:57:37,074
You know, that's the money.
For about a thousand, he said.

558
00:57:39,148 --> 00:57:43,642
But I just can't afford for that money
so I come here to...

559
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:44,879
Get out.

560
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:54,163
If it's too much
five is good.

561
00:57:54,264 --> 00:57:55,925
I said, get out.

562
00:57:58,635 --> 00:58:02,230
Well then
maybe two grand?

563
00:58:02,372 --> 00:58:03,930
Get the fuck out!

564
00:58:04,407 --> 00:58:05,669
Want me to get out?

565
00:58:18,588 --> 00:58:20,818
I should've gone with two
grand from the start, shit.

566
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,222
Man, I was too greedy.

567
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,411
Is this a butterfly?

568
00:58:46,883 --> 00:58:50,614
That's a pretty
sorry butterfly.

569
00:58:52,055 --> 00:58:56,082
Stay still. Boss is trying
to take in the art work.

570
00:58:56,326 --> 00:58:57,725
Go away.

571
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,521
Go away? You fuckin'...

572
00:58:59,796 --> 00:59:02,162
Do you have a death wish?

573
00:59:05,735 --> 00:59:07,760
You disgusting flab of meat.

574
00:59:08,004 --> 00:59:12,338
Hey, why would you wanna
bother this scrawny kid?

575
00:59:12,442 --> 00:59:15,775
Get off, you fat fuck.

576
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,171
You okay?

577
00:59:21,818 --> 00:59:23,911
You don't look like
you belong here.

578
00:59:23,987 --> 00:59:26,421
What brought you here?

579
00:59:27,123 --> 00:59:31,924
No way.
You were a gangster? You?

580
00:59:32,228 --> 00:59:35,391
How scary.
What's your name?

581
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:37,566
YOUN Min-jae.

582
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:43,833
I'm WANG Do-chul. Think of me
as your big brother from now on.

583
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,776
As long as I'm here,
you don't need to worry.

584
00:59:46,776 --> 00:59:52,476
I got your back.

585
00:59:54,984 --> 00:59:56,576
Hey, listen.

586
00:59:57,253 --> 01:00:04,421
If any of you gets near my boy here,
I won't leave you alone.

587
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,256
You got that, or what?

588
01:00:16,673 --> 01:00:20,040
What's wrong with
those guys? Fuck.

589
01:00:24,547 --> 01:00:27,448
Come on, move.

590
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:31,186
Wash what you can for
the next one minute.

591
01:00:37,794 --> 01:00:40,729
Come on, hurry up now.

592
01:00:43,866 --> 01:00:45,333
Over there, sir.

593
01:00:52,241 --> 01:00:54,141
How are you
Captain Hwang?

594
01:00:54,343 --> 01:00:57,437
Sorry for intruding like this.

595
01:00:58,114 --> 01:01:04,815
That's okay, Hae-mi.
What brings you here?

596
01:01:06,889 --> 01:01:10,586
My cousin's in the camp.

597
01:01:10,993 --> 01:01:13,621
Oh, so he's a soldier?

598
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:20,499
No, the police had some things
mixed up and brought him here.

599
01:01:21,037 --> 01:01:25,599
I was thinking maybe
you could help.

600
01:01:26,909 --> 01:01:32,905
If it's your cousin
wouldn't it

601
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:37,078
be a lot easier if
you ask the colonel.

602
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:42,822
Well, the thing is...

603
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:46,192
The Corp commander is
paging you, sir.

604
01:01:50,032 --> 01:01:52,466
Hey, I'm sorry.
I need to be excused.

605
01:01:52,602 --> 01:01:53,569
Hold on, wait.

606
01:01:56,472 --> 01:01:58,770
What's his name?

607
01:01:58,908 --> 01:02:01,035
Min-jae. YOUN Min-jae.

608
01:02:01,144 --> 01:02:06,343
He should be out safe
in four weeks.

609
01:02:06,649 --> 01:02:08,913
Can I see him now?

610
01:02:09,118 --> 01:02:12,884
I'm sorry.
Visitings are prohibited.

611
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:17,951
But, let me see what I can do.

612
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:23,029
Thank you. And one more thing...

613
01:02:23,266 --> 01:02:28,966
I would appreciate it if you
don't tell this to the colonel.

614
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:31,635
Yes, ma'am.

615
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:50,254
Count, One!

616
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:54,625
Two! Three! Four! Five! Six!
Seven! Eight! Nine! Count over!

617
01:02:54,964 --> 01:02:56,397
Numbers one to three
may go in and eat.

618
01:02:56,465 --> 01:02:57,762
Enter!

619
01:02:57,867 --> 01:02:59,198
The rest of you,
get on your heads!

620
01:02:59,302 --> 01:03:00,580
On your heads, shitheads!
