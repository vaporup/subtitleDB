1
00:00:00,415 --> 00:00:01,712
Next.

2
00:00:01,783 --> 00:00:04,377
I'll kill anyone that beats us.

3
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:07,522
Don't risk your lives for a meal.

4
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:22,135
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!
Six! Seven! Eight! Nine!

5
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:23,795
The first three may enter.

6
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,065
Enter!

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,164
The rest of you,
you know the drill.

8
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:27,366
On your heads, you fuck.
I said, on your heads!

9
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:38,115
YOUN Min-jae, get up.

10
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:57,999
Eun-ji?

11
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:11,047
I'm really dirty right
now and I stink.

12
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:20,021
Min-jae.

13
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm sorry, Eun-ji.

14
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:29,297
I really meant to keep
the promise this time.

15
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,555
Cute, huh?

16
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:06,136
Min-jae, it's okay.
It's okay.

17
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:10,003
Listen to me.

18
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:14,241
I met someone here.
He's Captain Hwang.

19
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:18,380
I told him that you were my cousin,

20
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:20,750
so act accordingly
Got that?

21
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:22,921
Okay.

22
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:30,828
You should be out in no time.

23
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:34,528
Okay.

24
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:14,506
Allegiance!

25
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:28,387
If it's okay, I'd like to
take you out to dinner.

26
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:39,967
You must feel better about
seeing your cousin.

27
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,072
Yes.

28
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:54,582
YOUN Min-jae has a solid
record so far,

29
00:03:54,822 --> 00:03:59,555
so I'll make sure he gets out after
the four-week training.

30
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:03,092
Thank you so much.

31
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,640
How's the food?

32
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:23,814
What? Oh, the food...

33
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:27,887
Are you okay?

34
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:30,953
My earring...

35
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:36,229
That's okay.

36
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,962
Come out here for a second.

37
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:49,437
You don't have to do this.

38
00:04:55,016 --> 00:05:00,420
I'm really sorry.
I wanted to find it for you.

39
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:02,421
That's really okay.

40
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:06,290
You can't just have one though.

41
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:10,163
I'll just take one off like this.

42
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:15,692
Can I have that?

43
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:17,303
Excuse me?

44
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:21,798
I'll find the other piece for you.

45
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:23,444
Ummm...

46
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:24,739
Here.

47
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,045
Hey, get up.

48
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:03,015
- Balls!
- Ferocity!

49
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:04,778
- Balls!
- Ferocity!

50
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,911
- Balls!
- Ferocity! Balls!

51
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:35,314
Eat that, you animals.

52
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,245
Let's get moving, boys.

53
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,436
Allegiance!

54
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:12,413
The release trainee list
has been completed, sir.

55
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:15,013
How about YOUN Min-jae?

56
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:16,746
He's on the list as ordered.

57
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:18,959
Let me see.

58
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:36,474
Allegiance!

59
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:03,995
Colonel Hur's relative?
Are you crazy?

60
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,033
YOUN Min-jae's a former thug
slash philanderer that

61
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:09,269
took away Hae-mi from the colonel.

62
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:26,621
- Number 2322, KIM Bong-gun.
- Yes!

63
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:30,855
- 2351, HWANG Young-jae!
- Thank you!

64
00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:35,796
- Number 2133, YOUN Won-suk.
- Yes!

65
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:41,033
- Number 2400 PYO Dong-jong.
- Yes. Halleluiah!

66
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:44,611
- Number 2281, HONG Suk-jun.
- Yes! Thank you, god.

67
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:47,113
- Number 2116, HWANG Gi-suk.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

68
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,274
That's all for the third
Samchung Revival Camp!

69
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:54,315
The rest will be transferred
to Samchung Volunteer Corps.

70
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:57,925
Those of you that had their
names called to your left.

71
00:08:58,192 --> 00:08:58,920
Execute!

72
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:00,220
Execute!

73
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,088
Fuck. What about me?

74
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:08,098
What about me?

75
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:09,498
What are you doing, you fuck.

76
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:18,971
Sir, one sec!

77
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:22,706
I think there's been a mistake.

78
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:25,017
My name wasn't called.

79
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:29,283
Number 2126, YOUN Min-jae.

80
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,449
There's no YOUN Min-jae.
Is that clear?

81
00:09:33,628 --> 00:09:35,994
There definitely is.

82
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,962
That's impossible!

83
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,862
There definitely is!

84
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:43,400
You fuck.

85
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:46,705
I need to get out!

86
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:51,808
I need to get out, you fuckers!

87
00:09:51,946 --> 00:09:53,538
I need to get out!

88
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:16,550
Freeze!

89
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:21,758
This is where you boys will
be staying starting today.

90
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:23,958
There's no agenda for today.

91
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:31,461
After six months of volunteer
work, you'll be sent home.

92
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:47,682
It's been a while.

93
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:53,522
I have one little question
I wanted to ask you.

94
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:54,892
What is it?

95
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:57,429
Did you know that Samchung
Revival Camp was like this?

96
00:12:58,432 --> 00:12:59,990
I didn't have a clue.

97
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,831
So you didn't know, huh?
You stinking bastard!

98
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:06,340
- What's with you?
- You got me into this.

99
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,035
Off of me.

100
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:11,336
What do we do now, huh?
What now?

101
00:13:17,718 --> 00:13:19,549
Stop crying.

102
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,018
Leave him alone.
I feel him.

103
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,579
Shut the fuck up.

104
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:26,891
You are a living nightmare.

105
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:29,130
Whatever man... it's you that

106
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,599
got us on the bus here

107
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,327
What did you just say?

108
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:33,991
Hey.
WANG Do-chul, you.

109
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:35,432
Shut up.

110
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:37,368
Who the fuck is this now?

111
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:43,108
Okay, so you wanna test
my patience today, huh?

112
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:45,611
- Okay then, let's go.
- Come here you little punk

113
00:13:45,713 --> 00:13:46,771
- What?
- I said, come here.

114
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:49,315
He doesn't understand that.

115
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:51,317
You need to call him
as if you would a dog.

116
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:55,347
You bitch. Do you wanna die?

117
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:58,356
Do you boys have a death wish?

118
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:12,295
I own a barbershop.

119
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,770
One day, this cop came in for
a hair cut and a hand job.

120
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:22,914
Then he would leave without paying.

121
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:31,615
So I said he should at least pay
the chick for the hand job.

122
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,121
Just for saying that,
he tried to arrest me.

123
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:46,972
So I beat the crap out of the cop,
and that's how I ended up here.

124
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:54,572
I may be a mere barber,
but I can never stand injustice.

125
00:14:54,849 --> 00:15:01,254
During the Park administration,
I used to be a Navy Seal, you know.

126
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:08,055
Anyway, after Park's death,
things just got tangled up.

127
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:12,794
KIM Jae-kyu's an asshole for

128
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,401
assassinating President Park

129
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:19,698
That was just foul, you know.

130
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:20,762
Enough!

131
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:23,003
Sit!

132
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:28,406
Next.

133
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:30,650
Number 3202.

134
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:32,950
Load personal story!

135
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:34,247
Load!

136
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:35,445
Fire!

137
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:37,950
I'm a doctor.

138
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,688
And I chose to come here.

139
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,658
Bullshit.

140
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:50,295
Please listen to my story.

141
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:55,166
I used to roam around the
country practicing medicine

142
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:58,639
to help out the needy.

143
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,877
I worked gruelingly to serve

144
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,378
my patients with utmost care.

145
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:10,381
But one day,
I met this woman who

146
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:14,723
was suffering from a clogged artery.

147
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:18,164
Why is that a big deal?

148
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:20,096
Well, if you don't prevent the

149
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,533
artery from being clogged,

150
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:28,573
the artery will expand and
eventually result in death.

151
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:33,506
The good thing is,

152
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:37,048
I knew the proper cure for the disease

153
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:42,285
and so I slid my rod in her clam,

154
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:46,222
attempting to save her life.

155
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:55,927
But ignorant people thought that
I was trying to rape her,

156
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,128
which in turn got her husband furious.

157
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:04,035
So I decided to go into hiding.

158
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:09,479
The end.

159
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:27,058
Go into the cathedral.

160
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,140
It's freezing out there.

161
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:11,110
Man, I need to get out of here
before my son sees birth.

162
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:13,908
But guess that's not
happening anytime soon.

163
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:18,384
Son? He's just going to turn
into a thief like you anyway.

164
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:24,048
Shut up. His mother's smart, so he'll
probably get the brains from her.

165
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:25,455
Yeah, whatever.

166
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:30,486
Like father like son.

167
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:33,226
How smart do you think
he can possibly be?

168
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,160
Besides, your wife's probably

169
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:38,704
banging some guy left and right.

170
00:18:38,906 --> 00:18:41,397
Shut up, you fuck!

171
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:45,137
If you talk about Mi-ja again,
I'm going to kill you.

172
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:46,644
Mi-ja...?

173
00:18:48,315 --> 00:18:51,045
That's right. WANG Mi-ja.

174
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,181
Now that I come to thin of it,

175
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,288
she has the same last name as you.

176
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:04,330
She's really something though.

177
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:07,827
Did you say, WANG Mi-ja?

178
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:08,932
Yeah.

179
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:10,927
What does she do for a living?

180
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:13,105
She's a hair stylist.

181
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:18,176
So it's WANG Mi-ja that
cuts people's hair?

182
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:19,677
Yeah, man.

183
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,948
She has a mole here?

184
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:28,112
And how do you know this?

185
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:31,747
You stinking bastard...
that's my sister.

186
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:36,586
Oh, so you're the younger
brother that ran away after

187
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,961
getting expelled from school?

188
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:41,796
Holy mother lord.

189
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,832
Oh my god. This stinking bastard
and my sister...

190
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:48,898
How dare you... you stinking...

191
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:52,767
So you're my brother in law.
That's fantastic, brother.

192
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,245
You're my brother
in law for real.

193
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:56,680
Nice meeting you, man.

194
00:20:31,552 --> 00:20:33,850
Please cut that out, will you?

195
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:37,622
That crazy motherfucker.

196
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,227
Why would you want to take
off his pants, you homos?

197
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:43,261
Are you out of your mind?

198
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,624
Fuckin' A.

199
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:00,272
Freeze!

200
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:05,874
What's going on here?

201
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:11,186
Cut out the crap.
I'll give you another chance.

202
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:14,785
Back to sleep.

203
00:21:22,102 --> 00:21:24,536
No violence, gentlemen!

204
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:45,319
Thank you, Min-jae, Mr.

205
00:21:47,594 --> 00:21:50,290
Be nice to our new boss now.

206
00:21:50,631 --> 00:21:54,658
We'll call him Mr. Butterfly.

207
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:59,234
If you don't call him that,
I'll kick all your asses.

208
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,372
Good night, boss.

209
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:05,496
Can you tell me where Min-jae is?

210
00:23:11,678 --> 00:23:16,877
Why didn't you tell me the
truth from the beginning?

211
00:23:19,052 --> 00:23:21,145
Your relationship
with YOUN Min-jae.

212
00:23:21,955 --> 00:23:26,289
I didn't mean to lie.

213
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,051
What good is it for you
if you know where he is?

214
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:33,397
Please help.
I just need to find him.

215
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:37,762
Please tell me.

216
00:23:38,472 --> 00:23:40,633
He's not for you.

217
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:55,722
Why not?

218
00:23:56,456 --> 00:23:59,448
Because he's a gangster?

219
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:00,851
It's not like I'm any better.

220
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:02,895
I'm just a mistress.

221
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:04,790
Don't degrade yourself like that.

222
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:06,998
I love Min-jae.

223
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:09,059
I don't buy that love.

224
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:11,033
I don't care what you think.

225
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,099
What I need is knowing
where he is right now.

226
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:16,636
Please.

227
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:21,212
Okay, fine.

228
00:24:24,151 --> 00:24:33,059
But I'll closely be watching
the love you just talked about.

229
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:40,360
We searched everywhere

230
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,328
but couldn't find anything.

231
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:45,971
But I did issue a warrant.

232
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:48,006
We should be able
to find her soon.

233
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:53,273
Forget about it.

234
00:25:04,825 --> 00:25:10,821
I know what a man like you wants.

235
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,727
And I have the power
to give that to you.

236
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:25,142
But the question is,
what can you give me?

237
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:33,314
Leave it up to me.

238
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:38,286
Should I?

239
00:25:39,926 --> 00:25:42,190
I already swore my
patriotism to you, sir.

240
00:25:42,863 --> 00:25:44,125
Give me a chance.

241
00:25:51,905 --> 00:25:56,433
- That dude...
- Why the hell is he here?

242
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:07,480
Attention!

243
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:12,753
You were all given an opportunity
for revival at the Samchung Revival Camp.

244
00:26:13,793 --> 00:26:16,023
But you were all sent here
because you didn't make it there.

245
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:20,561
You gentlemen must change.

246
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:26,538
If you don't get better here,
you won't have another chance.

247
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:32,675
And the entire unit will take
responsibility for one's action.

248
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:36,648
If one fucks up, the rest
will be disciplined.

249
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:43,682
And if one of you decides to betray
the group for personal benefit,

250
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:46,418
I'll teach you why
it was a bad choice.

251
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:48,151
Prepare yourselves.

252
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:50,194
The end.

253
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,062
He's changed completely.

254
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:01,267
He was nicer than that before.

255
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:15,117
From what I'm seeing,
I guess he fucked up.

256
00:27:15,455 --> 00:27:16,649
Or else, he wouldn't
be here, right, brother?

257
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:20,715
Don't call me brother
before I kick your ass.

258
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:25,498
You need to accept
our relationship.

259
00:27:25,498 --> 00:27:26,692
Shit.

260
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:31,261
Settle down, brother.

261
00:27:47,153 --> 00:27:49,348
As long as I'm here,
there will be no more fighting.

262
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,649
I'll teach you discipline from now.

263
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:54,551
- Get started.
- Yes, sir.

264
00:29:05,465 --> 00:29:07,558
Authorized personnel only, miss.

265
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:09,798
How about visits?

266
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:12,133
I said,
authorized personnel only, miss.

267
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:23,714
Do you know YOUN Min-jae?

268
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:26,616
Does anyone know YOUN Min-jae?

269
00:29:26,686 --> 00:29:29,519
Anyone?
Anyone know YOUN Min-jae?

270
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:35,354
Hold on.

271
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,894
Hold on. Wait!

272
00:29:37,997 --> 00:29:40,465
You can't go in.

273
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:45,233
It's the same butterfly tattoo as this.

274
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:51,869
You know YOUN Min-jae?
YOUN Min-jae?

275
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:55,611
She was calling out
your name, boss.

276
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:59,312
And she had the same
butterfly tattoo as you.

277
00:30:09,796 --> 00:30:12,321
Eun-ji?!
Eun-ji!

278
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:14,758
Stop!

279
00:30:15,735 --> 00:30:17,703
Min-jae, be careful!

280
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:20,662
No, Min-jae!

281
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:22,271
Boss!

282
00:30:24,444 --> 00:30:25,638
Eun-ji!

283
00:30:28,381 --> 00:30:29,746
- Eun-ji!
- Min-jae!

284
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:33,877
Eun-ji, what are
you doing here?

285
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,282
Are you okay, Min-jae?

286
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:36,945
- I'm okay.
- You sure?

287
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:40,258
- Go back now. I'm okay.
- Min-jae...

288
00:30:42,095 --> 00:30:43,255
Don't worry and just go, Eun-ji!

289
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:45,831
- Min-jae, I...
- I'm going to you later.

290
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:47,523
Min-jae...

291
00:30:48,268 --> 00:30:52,967
Min-jae! Min-jae!

292
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:54,672
You dip shit!

293
00:30:55,742 --> 00:30:58,233
Don't hit him!
Please stop!

294
00:30:58,645 --> 00:31:01,136
Please just give me one second.

295
00:31:01,247 --> 00:31:04,182
She came here to see me, okay?

296
00:31:04,284 --> 00:31:04,978
Min-jae.

297
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:08,019
- Just a minute, please.
- Don't hit him!

298
00:31:37,183 --> 00:31:39,515
I was hoping that
you wouldn't show up.

299
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:45,753
What are you doing here?

300
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:48,291
Did the colonel send you here?

301
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:58,635
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

302
00:31:59,272 --> 00:32:04,335
So, can you please save him?
I'm begging you.

303
00:32:06,045 --> 00:32:08,070
He didn't do anything wrong

304
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:13,312
It's all me. Let him go.

305
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:15,448
This is my last warning.

306
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:17,957
Don't ever come back here.

307
00:32:22,228 --> 00:32:26,028
Will you let him go,
if I leave then?

308
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:31,400
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

309
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:34,737
Do you think I'm here to
kill YOUN Min-jae alone?

310
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:39,437
Hey, Sergeant, get her out of here.

311
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,646
Yes, sir.

312
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:49,854
If you see her again,
get rid of her.

313
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,371
Hey!

314
00:33:08,474 --> 00:33:10,601
Do you think she's still here?

315
00:33:10,877 --> 00:33:13,107
Of course man.
She's boss' woman.

316
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,376
She didn't look like she was
going to leave anytime soon.

317
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:19,842
What a kiss ass you are

318
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:21,543
What's Mr. Butterfly to you?

319
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:23,418
Are you talking shit about boss?

320
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,251
Well, if you think about it,

321
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,020
butterflies may look fancy

322
00:33:30,596 --> 00:33:32,996
but in reality they're really a
Ionely and poor species.

323
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:35,357
You need to live as larva

324
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:39,130
for six years underground.

325
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:42,702
And for what? So that you can

326
00:33:42,842 --> 00:33:47,836
fly for maybe a couple of weeks?

327
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:50,106
With bad luck, you can even get hit

328
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:53,548
by a rain shower on your first day.

329
00:33:54,153 --> 00:33:56,747
They're some poor species.

330
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:01,550
So no larvas for snack when
you boys are out of here.

331
00:34:01,627 --> 00:34:03,322
Got that?

332
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:07,990
What about the broth?

333
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:14,696
That you can. Larva broth with
a shot of Soju is the best.

334
00:34:14,974 --> 00:34:17,238
Shut the fuck up.

335
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:21,741
How can you be talking about
Soju and larvas right now?

336
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:25,144
Hey, you little cold-blooded.

337
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:31,888
Eun-ji...

338
00:35:51,237 --> 00:35:52,431
Eun-ji?

339
00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:57,606
Eun-ji...

340
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:02,410
How did you get here?
How did you escape?

341
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:04,641
I knew that you would be here.

342
00:36:07,253 --> 00:36:09,153
Min-jae, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

343
00:36:09,255 --> 00:36:12,349
I think all of this
happened because of me.

344
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:14,117
Stop saying that.

345
00:36:14,594 --> 00:36:17,188
I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.

346
00:36:18,297 --> 00:36:22,199
It's dangerous here.
Let's go, okay? Let's go.

347
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:53,722
Min-jae! Min-jae!
No, no. Please don't shoot.

348
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,064
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

349
00:36:59,105 --> 00:37:02,563
Please don't shoot!

350
00:37:06,345 --> 00:37:07,505
Take him.

351
00:37:07,713 --> 00:37:10,181
No! Please, no!

352
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:14,753
Let Eun-ji go, you fuckers!

353
00:37:14,854 --> 00:37:16,947
Don't touch her! Eun-ji!

354
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:19,082
Min-jae... Min-jae...

355
00:37:19,158 --> 00:37:20,557
Let her go.

356
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:22,253
What about her, sir?

357
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,097
Put her in my car.

358
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,394
Off of me!

359
00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:58,460
- Go back to the corps.
- Allegiance!

360
00:38:03,703 --> 00:38:05,637
Out! Get out!

361
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,364
Off of me!

362
00:38:12,411 --> 00:38:15,505
You're not even human!

363
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:18,045
That's right, I'm a soldier.

364
00:38:18,251 --> 00:38:19,809
My duty is to kill all enemies.

365
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:21,284
Foreign and domestic.
And YOUN Min-jae is an enemy.

366
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:24,379
If he dies, so will I.

367
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:26,424
Wake up!

368
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:31,621
Why would you want to risk
your life for a scum like that?

369
00:38:32,531 --> 00:38:35,500
I never disobeyed higher
order up until now.

370
00:38:36,302 --> 00:38:38,668
But you smiled at me when
everyone was laughing.

371
00:38:38,804 --> 00:38:40,999
You acknowledged me as a
soldier when no one did.

372
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:44,175
YOUN Min-jae would've been dead a
long time ago if it weren't for you.

373
00:38:44,477 --> 00:38:47,605
I never asked you to sacrifice.

374
00:40:31,784 --> 00:40:34,014
Where's Eun-ji?

375
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:37,118
Where's Eun-ji?

376
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:39,950
Where's Eun-ji, you fuck?

377
00:40:53,906 --> 00:40:55,635
Please don't shoot.

378
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:58,537
I'm back.

379
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:01,739
So don't shoot.

380
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:13,950
Hey, brother.
So you're back, huh?

381
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:16,217
So you ran and couldn't

382
00:41:16,295 --> 00:41:20,595
go farther than a kilo?

383
00:41:41,053 --> 00:41:45,319
Eun-ji had it in her hands.

384
00:41:58,537 --> 00:42:02,234
Where was it, huh?

385
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,911
Heads!

386
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:25,726
CHO Gwang-pal!

387
00:42:26,232 --> 00:42:27,927
CHO Gwang-pal!

388
00:42:33,038 --> 00:42:35,529
You can't die!

389
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:42,537
Let's run away! If I'm going to die,
I want to die in style.

390
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:47,380
Mr. Butterfly! Mr. Butterfly!

391
00:43:00,533 --> 00:43:01,727
Reload the magazine!

392
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,291
Sir, there's no more!

393
00:43:10,843 --> 00:43:12,242
Out of my way!

394
00:43:20,886 --> 00:43:22,786
Is it YOUN Min-jae?

395
00:43:24,189 --> 00:43:26,123
I'll gather a search
team right away, sir.

396
00:44:35,661 --> 00:44:39,529
Eagle, Eagle, Tiger.
We have a problem. Backup needed.

397
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:41,600
Inform the location,
and contain this mess.

398
00:45:32,117 --> 00:45:33,550
Eun-ji.

399
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,616
Eun-ji!

400
00:45:35,888 --> 00:45:37,185
Eun-ji!

401
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:52,532
Eun-ji! Eun-ji! Get up.

402
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:54,902
I'm here. It's me, Min-jae.

403
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:02,171
Come on, Eun-ji. I'm here.

404
00:46:07,086 --> 00:46:12,183
Eun-ji, you can't die like this

405
00:46:12,758 --> 00:46:14,555
Eun-ji, you can't die like this.

406
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,388
What happened to our promise

407
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:21,297
that we'd live on the beach with palm

408
00:46:21,366 --> 00:46:24,358
trees and a hammock drinking juice.

409
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:27,432
I thought we were going to live

410
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:31,441
happily ever after just like that.

411
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,364
Eun-ji, this can't happen.

412
00:46:57,569 --> 00:47:09,208
We need to live together in style, remember?

413
00:47:18,016 --> 00:47:20,049
Wake up, Eun-ji!

414
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:23,993
Wake up. Come on!

415
00:47:42,381 --> 00:47:48,581
Why did you kill her? Why?
You fucker!

416
00:48:38,537 --> 00:48:45,443
Why did you kill her?

417
00:48:46,311 --> 00:48:50,338
Why did you kill her?

418
00:50:51,169 --> 00:50:58,439
Did you have a wedding and
everything with my sister?

419
00:51:00,178 --> 00:51:08,950
Of course. At this huge
wedding chapel in Namwon.

420
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:18,492
Did she look good?

421
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:25,993
Brother!

422
00:51:32,944 --> 00:51:37,347
You know damn well
how good she looks.

423
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:45,417
You know damn well...

424
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:25,554
At least Mr. Butterfly's
with his woman.

425
00:53:26,324 --> 00:53:34,925
Good thing he'll be with his love.
I mean, it's a long way.
