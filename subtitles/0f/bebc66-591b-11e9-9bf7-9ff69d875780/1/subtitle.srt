1
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,411
Good morning.

2
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,279
<i>It was just the two of
us after my father left.</i>

3
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,039
<i>He said I should count
the new baby he had</i>

4
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,239
<i>with his new wife, Marjorie,
as part of my family, too.</i>

5
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,807
<i>Plus Richard, Marjorie's son.</i>

6
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,359
<i>For the most part, my mother
never mentioned my father,</i>

7
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,599
<i>or the woman he was married to now.</i>

8
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,801
<i>You could always come live
with Marjorie and me.</i>

9
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,759
I mean, if that was something you
wanted, we can have her evaluated.

10
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,279
No. Mom is great.

11
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,039
She's learning to play the cello.

12
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,039
I just asked because
I get the feeling her...

13
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,447
That she's getting worse.

14
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,279
<i>I don't think losing my father
broke my mother's heart</i>

15
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,847
<i>but rather, losing love itself.</i>

16
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,239
<i>Even at that age, I understood this</i>

17
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,879
<i>and wanted to make up for
some of the neglect.</i>

18
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,491
<i>Oh, what did you do?</i>

19
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,841
- You made all this for me?
- Mmm-hmm.

20
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,279
"Husband for a Day."

21
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,448
<i>I made her a coupon book.</i>

22
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,159
- I cleaned.
- "One week of clean dishes."

23
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,362
<i>Did little chores around the house.</i>

24
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,039
"Handyman."

25
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,242
<i>There was a coupon
for a shoulder rub.</i>

26
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,284
<i>A bubble bath.</i>

27
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,843
<i>I even took her on a date.</i>

28
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,159
A man should know how to dance.

29
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,126
When a man can dance,
the world is his oyster.

30
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,079
<i>Some men just set their hand on
your shoulder or against your back</i>

31
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,887
<i>but there has to be
strong pressure there.</i>

32
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,079
<i>At the time, I was too
young to understand</i>

33
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,359
<i>the part of being husband for a day,
I was not equipped to carry out.</i>

34
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,406
<i>But I sensed my own
terrible inadequacy.</i>

35
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,564
<i>I could feel her loneliness and
longing before I had a name for it.</i>

36
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,199
Hey, Henry. How's your mother?

37
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,401
Fine.

38
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,525
I hope to see her in
here one of these days.

39
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,691
<i>I understood who my
real family was.</i>

40
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,360
<i>Her.</i>

41
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,999
<i>Even if that meant</i>

42
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,125
<i>only leaving the house once a month
to pick up supplies at Pricemart.</i>

43
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,404
I think it's this way.

44
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,484
Is it all right if I go
check out the comics?

45
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,046
Um...

46
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,484
Okay. Just don't wander.

47
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,685
I'll be right over there.

48
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,282
I wonder if you could
give me a hand here.

49
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,159
You're bleeding.

50
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,159
Yeah, well, I fell out a window.

51
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,839
We should get help.

52
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,279
No, I wouldn't want
to upset anyone.

53
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,642
Did you come here with
that woman over there?

54
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,321
My mom.

55
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,804
She looks like the kind of
person that could help me.

56
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,319
I... I don't know.

57
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,002
What I want to ask is,
you think she'd give me a ride?

58
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,521
Hmm?

59
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,762
This is my mother, Adele.

60
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,604
Mom, this is Frank.
He needs our help.

61
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,759
You got a good boy here, Adele.

62
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,042
He was kind enough
to offer me a ride.

63
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,521
Oh.

64
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,880
Um...

65
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,645
Well, he may have, but...

66
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,806
We have a big afternoon.
I don't think we can help you.

67
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,290
Well, that's a shame.

68
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,130
I thought we could have a catch.

69
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,970
- I suck at baseball.
- Hey.

70
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,721
Maybe you used to.

71
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,122
Don't you throw around
a ball with your dad?

72
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,599
I only see him on Sundays.

73
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,039
- Oh.
- No. I'm sorry.

74
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,159
I won't be any trouble.

75
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,283
We really can't help you.

76
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,081
Frankly,

77
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,650
this needs to happen.

78
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,522
Oh, here. Why don't
you get in back?

79
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,724
Where do you want to go?

80
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,050
Your house.

81
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,725
Just for a few moments,
to rest my legs.

82
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,999
You'll have to excuse the mess.

83
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,690
We've been busy.

84
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,290
Nice place.

85
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,599
How do you, uh, take your coffee?

86
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,165
As is.

87
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,606
How did you hurt your leg?

88
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,405
I'm going to be straight
with you, here, Henry.

89
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,244
I'm not going to lie.

90
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,759
I hurt my leg jumping out of a
second floor window at a hospital

91
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,566
they'd taken me to to
get my appendix out.

92
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,764
At the prison.
That's how I got out.

93
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,441
When?

94
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,041
This morning.

95
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,930
You escaped?

96
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,930
So, now, the police
are looking for you.

97
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,959
I would have gotten further
except for the damn leg.

98
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,646
I'd be grateful if you let
me stay till nightfall.

99
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,999
I'd try and help out.

100
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,123
I wouldn't ask anything of you.

101
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,810
You just did.

102
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,647
Nothing more than a place to lay low
and rest my leg for a few hours.

103
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,439
How do I...

104
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,642
How do I know you won't hurt us?

105
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,009
I've never intentionally
hurt anyone in my life.

106
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,010
You understand how that
could be hard to believe.

107
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,330
Yeah, I do.

108
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,931
How far are the train
tracks from your backyard?

109
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,601
Running?

110
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,361
Limping.

111
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,284
Twenty minutes, maybe.

112
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,879
People come over. Often. Randomly.

113
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,999
Friends, salesmen,
religious people.

114
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,919
I'll make a run for it tonight and I
can stay out of your way until then.

115
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,839
I mean, they'd notice
if I went quiet.

116
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,719
Even for a little bit.

117
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,119
I just escaped from prison.

118
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,239
The last place
I want to go is back.

119
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,761
I'm stronger than you think.

120
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,964
I don't doubt that.

121
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,566
And I won't let anything
happen to my son.

122
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,883
He's in good hands.

123

<i>Captain! Where is Frank Chambers?</i>

130
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,799
<i>Considering his injuries,
we believe he hasn't gotten far.</i>

131
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,527
<i>Now keep in mind that he is
dangerous and quite possibly armed.</i>

132

141
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,123
Didn't happen that way.

142
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,439
Isn't it against the law
to hide a fugitive?

143
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,642
You got a wise son here, Adele.

144
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,848
It's good to know he's
looking out for you.

145
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,644
It's all going to be fine.

146
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,359
It would only be a problem
if someone found Frank here.

147
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,439
And that doesn't need to happen.

148
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,519
He can just lay low for a few
hours, and then keep moving.

149
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,324
That's true enough.

150
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,086
It's still not acceptable to place you
and your family here in jeopardy.

151
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,242
If someone were to come by, it would
need to look like I kidnapped you.

152
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,002
That's why I'm going
to have to tie you up.

153
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,599
It's about keeping up appearances.

154
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,007
I think you understand what I mean.

155
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,329
- Who are you going to...
- Only you.

156
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,399
Henry here knows he doesn't want
anything to happen to his mother.

157
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,726
Right, Henry?

158
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,606
Hmm?

159
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,411
Open these.

160
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,610
Grab a bowl.

161
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,649
<i>I don't suppose your father has
told you anything about sex.</i>

162
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,719
Most people put all this focus

163
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,999
on the physical changes
you'll be going through soon.

164
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,559
It's okay.

165
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,239
They explained everything
in a health assembly.

166
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,445
Well, there's another aspect that your
health teacher is unlikely to explore.

167
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,279
People act as if making love is all
about secretions and body functions.

168
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,209
Mom. It's okay.

169
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,079
For all the discussions of
body parts and hormones,

170
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,965
they forget to mention
how it feels.

171
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,962
<i>There's another kind of hunger.</i>

172
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,801
<i>The hunger for human touch.</i>

173
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,165
<i>Desire.</i>

174
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,650
<i>People never tell you
about how it feels.</i>

175
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,845
<i>The longing.</i>

176
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,649
What time do the trains
start in the morning?

177
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,691
I don't know.

178
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,764
I'll just have to keep an
ear out for them, I guess.

179
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,770
I don't blame you for wondering.

180
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Just know that there's more to this story
than you'll see in that paper there.

181
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,364
How did you escape?

182
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,047
I told the guard at the hospital if he
left, I was going to jump out the window.

183
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,611
He heard that and
went to have a smoke.

184
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,046
Nothing misleads
people like the truth.

185
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,802
You have any brothers or sisters?

186
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,962
No. My mom tried, but...

187
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,439
I've got a stepbrother
and a half-sister.

188
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,041
My dad takes me out to
dinner with them on Sundays.

189
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,403
How does a fellow let a woman
like your mother get away?

190
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,009
He got together with his secretary.

191
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,801
Good riddance.

192
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,601
Good morning.

193
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,409
We won't be needing
that any longer.

194
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,205
But if the day comes and you have to
say I tied you up, you won't be lying.

195
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,248
Haven't heard any trains go by.

196
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,091
Holiday weekend.

197
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,126
Breakfast?

198
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,929
You have to try one.

199
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,811
Okay.

200
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,525
Hey, give me a three-quarter-inch
ratchet wrench.

201
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,479
Ratchet wrench.

202
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,759
<i>That day, Frank changed
the oil in the car</i>

203
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,639
<i>and replaced the fuse
for the blinkers.</i>

204
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,650
<i>Then he replaced the
filter on the furnace.</i>

205
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,999
<i>He checked out the cord of
firewood that just got delivered</i>

206
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,885
<i>and informed my mom that
the guy was shorting her.</i>

207
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,563
<i>Then he washed the
floor and waxed it.</i>

208
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,731
<i>Then you rotate the ball.</i>

209
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,411
Grip it loose.

210
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,879
Two fingers up top,
thumb on the bottom.

211
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,402
Just let it rest there.
Barely tight enough to hold.

212
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,879
And when you release,

213
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,719
snap your wrist down, like a whip.

214
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,251
Just crack.

215
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,242
<i>And then you grab those seams
when the ball leaves your fingers.</i>

216
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,449
You bite your lip when you sew.

217
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,248
I'm trying not to stick you.

218
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,451
How'd you get that scar?

219
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,241
<i>Stars and Stripes Forever</i>
routine for my dance recital.

220
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,450
Halfway through rehearsal,
they got rid of the ramp.

221
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,560
I tapped myself right
off the stage.

222
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,969
Come here! Come here!

223
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,919
Answer the door, Hank.

224
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,770
Let them know your mother's out.

225
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,559
And I trust you're not gonna
get nervous and say something.

226
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,000
Now go.

227
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,239
Oh.

228
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,090
Hi, Henry. I was looking
for your mother.

229
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,642
I'm sorry, Mr. Jervis,
she's not home.

230
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,330
Oh. Well, that's...

231
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,684
That's not like her.

232
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,319
Has she been following
the news, do you know?

233
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,522
Did she leave you here by yourself?

234
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,919
No, I just mean she
can't come to the door.

235
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,009
- She's taking a bath.
- Oh.

236
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,959
Are those for her?

237
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,479
Yeah. I had so many, I didn't
know what to do with them.

238
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,011
I thought your mother
might like them.

239
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,639
Thank you.

240
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,524
I'm sure she'll appreciate them.

241
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,965
Let her know there's something
I'd like to discuss with her.

242
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,204
Is everything okay?

243
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,843
Well, uh...

244
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,519
Look, Henry, I don't know if you've
heard, but there's a guy loose.

245
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,370
Broke out of Stinchfield.

246
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,639
He's probably long gone
by now, but till they find him,

247
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,844
I wouldn't be opening the
door without an adult.

248
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,839
Thank you for telling me.

249
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,408
Look, I doubt he's
anywhere near here by now.

250
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,368
Just remember, I'm right
across the street.

251
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,850
You have any problems,
just give me a jingle.

252
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,525
He had more than he needed.

253
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,611
You did good, Hank.

254
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,891
Um...

255
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,921
Henry, why don't you
go check on Joe?

256
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,081
I'm sure he's fine.

257
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,199
It's a hot day.

258
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,607
Make sure his water
hasn't dried up.

259
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,641
Yeah.

260
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,091
You can't do that again.

261
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,759
What? What did I do?

262
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,122
My son is not your lookout.

263
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,359
He's not your accomplice.
And I don't...

264
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,767
- it was just a neighbor.
- It doesn't matter!

265
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,079
Don't forget what's going on here.

266
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,089
Not for a second.

267
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,410
Now, I see the way he looks at you.

268
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,559
What he wants.

269
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,410
That encouragement,
pat on his shoulder.

270
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,769
And I want it for him.

271
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,725
But not for that.

272
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,564
I can't promise what's going
to show up at the door.

273
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,401
I know.

274
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,611
Okay, then.

275
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,485
It's a good peach.

276
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,371
It's too bad they're all so ripe,
you'll never get through them all.

277
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,484
We should throw most of
them away before they rot.

278
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,163
No, I have another idea.

279
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,559
Take a peach.

280
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,799
Thank you.

281
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,606
<i>Now, the filling is easy. What
I want to talk about is crust.</i>

282
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,399
<i>You've got to keep
your ingredients cool.</i>

283
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,967
<i>Hot day like this is
challenge enough.</i>

284
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,640
The phone rings while you're making
a crust, just let them call you back.

285
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,646
Mix it up.

286
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,519
Pie crust is a very
forgiving thing. Forks.

287
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,769
You can make all kinds of mistakes,
but don't forget the salt.

288
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,719
- All of it?
- Yeah, before it gets too warm.

289
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,399
Keep everything cool.

290
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,409
Then mix it up.

291
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,444
Take that knife.

292
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,282
It's all about instinct.

293
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,769
Pay too much attention to
recipes, you forget how to feel.

294
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,719
It's like reading a
book on gardening

295
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,491
when all you've got to do is get
dirt underneath your fingernails.

296
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,719
All right. Put it in there.

297
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,251
That's it.

298
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,605
Now, don't over-handle.

299
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,126
You want it right on the verge
of crumbling at any moment.

300
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,051
There you go.

301
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,489
Now grab the outside.

302
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,169
Heel of the hand.

303
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,079
People buy all these fancy gadgets,

304
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,330
but sometimes the best tool is
attached right there to your own body.

305
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,566
Okay.

306
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,919
Scatter a little tapioca,
like salt over an icy road.

307
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,963
Cure for a soggy crust.

308
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,290
The whole thing.

309
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,768
Make a little mountain out of it.

310
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,325
Perfect.

311
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,483
Okay, moment of truth.

312
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,490
Can't go too fast.

313
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,330
You can't hesitate.

314
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,519
<i>I don't know when my mom's hands</i>

315
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,688
<i>started shaking exactly.</i>

316
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,165
<i>But eventually, it was
beyond her control.</i>

317
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,522
Help me put a roof on this house.

318
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,361
Perfect.

319
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,606
I should go.

320
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,439
They won't come back
for a few hours.

321
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,449
This is as good a window
as I'm gonna get.

322
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,681
Maybe tomorrow,

323
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,126
once your stitches have
had a little more time.

324
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,639
They're not going to
stop looking, Adele.

325
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,127
They have dogs that
can smell your blood.

326
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,128
You should probably let
your stitches heal.

327
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,210
You should stay.

328
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,159
Thank you. I'm really nervous.

329
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,044
You have to...

330
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,839
I understand.

331
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,999
We'll just lay here a while.

332
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,525
We haven't had anybody in this
house for such a long time.

333
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,204
Let me get my...

334
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,201
<i>Rhythm.</i>

335
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,559
<i>This was the word that
burrowed into my brain</i>

336
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,560
<i>as I listened to their late night
conversation quietly dissipate.</i>

337
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,883
<i>I thought about
that word, "rhythm,"</i>

338
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,411
<i>and whether my mom
thought Frank had it.</i>

339
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,769
<i>These were the images
I returned to at night.</i>

340
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,799
<i>Particularly now that the
evening was no longer silent.</i>

341
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,085
<i>The next day, Frank fixed the
loose floorboard on the stairs.</i>

342
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,279
<i>He got the squeak out
of the kitchen door,</i>

343
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,960
<i>then cleared the debris
out of the gutters.</i>

344
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,165
Thank you.

345
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,319
I'll tell you this.

346
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,239
You don't want to wait
to learn to fix it.

347
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,331
Especially if you got a lady in the
seat beside you when it happens.

348
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,479
<i>They did laundry. He ironed.</i>

349
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,251
<i>And in return, my mom
taught him to rumba.</i>

350
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,683
Two... three... four.

351
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,559
Shift your weight this way.

352
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,843
Two... three... four.

353
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,559
<i>For lunch, Frank thought</i>

354
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,639
<i>it only right that we
fire up the barbecue.</i>

355
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,081
<i>So, he sent me to
pick up groceries.</i>

356
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,411
You know, drinking from
aluminum gives you Alzheimer's.

357
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,039
Is that true?

358
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,199
Uh-huh.

359
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,399
It's the perfect crime

360
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,409
'cause you can't
remember how you got it.

361
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,648
Is there anything
to do in this town?

362
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,250
There's bowling?

363
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,445
Bowling.

364
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,719
If you ask me, I think he's
holing up in someone's house

365
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,359
waiting for things to cool down.

366
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,079
I just can't get his
face out of my head.

367
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,124
The worst part is knowing that a
man like that has nothing to lose.

368
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,879
Life to a person like that
is worth about 10 cents.

369
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,759
They'll get him eventually.
They always do.

370
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,804
- Henry. How's your mother?
- She's doing great.

371
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,399
Where's all the canned goods?

372
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,559
You usually buy like you're
planning for a tornado.

373
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,888
Yeah. Special recipe.

374
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,079
Henry. This is a man's razor.

375
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,439
Your mom wants one of the
pink ones on aisle 7.

376
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,130
It's not for my mom.

377
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,931
It's for me.

378
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,281
You practicing?

379
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,605
All right. Just do me a favor
and keep the cap on, okay?

380
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,084
Keep an eye out, all right?

381
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,726
Mom?

382
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,324
You were just a boy.

383
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,843
I was 21.

384
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,119
You didn't know what
you were doing.

385
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,479
Doesn't make it right.

386
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,490
Why didn't you say something?

387
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,210
Adele?

388
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,679
Hey, Henry, where's your mom?

389
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,086
I don't know!

390
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,123
Um, let me go... Let me
go get her. Stay here!

391
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,880
I need you to watch Barry!

392
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,719
Ev, hi!

393
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,719
She asked me to watch Barry.

394
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,242
Listen. I'm at my wits' end.
I really need some help from you.

395
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,561
I have to go.
My dad's in the hospital.

396
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,359
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

397
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,839
So I need somebody to watch Barry.

398
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,610
- Like, right now?
- Yeah.

399
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,082
Yeah, I'll be back tonight.

400
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,879
You know, I can't. Um...

401
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,359
- Hey, Barry. How's it going?
- Good.

402
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,999
They don't expect my dad
to hold on for long.

403
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,079
Yeah, normally...

404
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,279
I really don't have any
other options, Adele.

405
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,519
I know. I really want to help you.

406
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,359
I promise he'll be good.

407
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,439
You're gonna be good, right, Barry?

408
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,599
You remember Henry? And his mom?

409
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,007
And all the good times
you've had here?

410
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,039
Evelyn.

411
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,399
Please. One mother to another.

412
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,879
I would not ask you if
I wasn't desperate.

413
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,919
It's just that...

414
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,600
I don't have any
other options. Please.

415
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,328
You're not going anywhere.

416
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,647
- Okay.
- Thank you.

417
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,439
Thank you, thank you. I owe you.

418
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,799
I will be back by the end of the night.
It's about two hours' drive.

419
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,879
Ah, okay.

420
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,919
Just put his chair
in front of the TV.

421
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,485
He loves cartoons.

422
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,127
Okay. Um...

423
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,971
Come on. I'll get you inside.

424
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,811
Here we go.

425
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,651
The door.

426
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,079
Hey, Barry, you look mighty
toasty in all those clothes.

427
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,807
I swear, she dresses him
for winter in August.

428
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,319
Well, you got here just in time.

429
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,329
We needed a third baseman.

430
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,884
Now, Barry, my name's Frank.

431
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,363
That's right. Frank.

432
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,371
There you go.

433
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,491
All right. Let's see that swing.

434
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,564
Don't get your hopes up.

435
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,359
Want to run that by me again?

436
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,519
Bat up. Shoulders forward.

437
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,041
Choke up on the bat,
hands together.

438
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,011
Knees bent.

439
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,159
There we go. Good.

440
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,679
When I throw it
to you, see the ball.

441
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,479
- See the ball.
- See the ball.

442
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,920
Keep it fluid.

443
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,726
- There we go.
- Whoa!

444
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,851
See the ball.

445
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,406
<i>The thing was, when Frank
threw the ball, I hit it.</i>

446
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,242
<i>If I had more time to work with
you, we could really get somewhere.</i>

447
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,766
You ready? Your turn?

448
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,211
- No, no.
- Come on.

449
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,004
Take a deep breath.

450
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,279
Relax.

451
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,131
There you go. Bend your knees.

452
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,285
Hands together.

453
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,919
There you go.

454
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,599
- I can't do this.
- Yeah, you can.

455
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,485
You are doing it. Bend your knees.

456
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,808
Ready?

457
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,124
Bring on the heat, Hank.

458
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,441
- There you go.
- Whoa!

459
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,959
<i>The count is 2 and 2.</i>

460
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,959
<i>The Red Sox are leading, 4 to 0.</i>

461
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,322
<i>Cleveland batting
in the 5th inning.</i>

462
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,846
<i>All four Red Sox runs in the 2nd.</i>

463
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,804
You fool.

464
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,119
<i>Tonight at 11:00, more on
escaped convict Frank Chambers.</i>

465
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,079
<i>Our psychologist weighs
in on what to expect</i>

466
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,159
<i>from a murderer on the run and
where he might be hiding.</i>

467
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,283
<i>That and more at 11:00.</i>

468
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,359
Okay, Barry.

469
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,722
Looks like your mother is here.

470
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,719
- Hi.
- Hi.

471
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,959
How's your dad?

472
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,879
Oh. It's complicated and not all
good, but he's under supervision.

473
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,799
Did you have a good time today?

474
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,331
Yee-yeah!

475
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,639
<i>This is Lynn Jolicoeur</i>

476
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,879
<i>for News Four New Hampshire.</i>

477
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,599
<i>Tonight's top story is

00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,679
<i>of the escape of Stinchfield
Prison inmate Frank Chambers,</i>

479
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,166
<i>a convicted murderer.</i>

480
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,559
Well, we've had a busy day, so...

481
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,679
Uh, listen, I've been on
the road for two hours.

482
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,530
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

483
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,919
Uh, sure.

484
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,521
Henry, would you grab
Evelyn some water?

485
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,719
<i>leaving police with very few clues.</i>

486
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,081
So, was he difficult?

487
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,047
No. No, not at all. No. We had
the best time with Barry.

488
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,199
We went outside and
threw a ball around.

489
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,039
Oh, God. Did you put on sunscreen?

490
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,479
Yeah. Of course.

491
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,079
A lot of people don't do that.

492
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,442
Fwah. Fwah. Fwah!

493
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,239
Yes, I know. We're going.

494
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,879
Fwah, Fwah, Fwah!

495
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,999
Oh, God.

496
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,839
Okay, okay. We're going home.
I just need a sip of water.

497
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,879
Fwah!

498
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,039
<i>Leaving Labor Day motorists with
more than the usual delays.</i>

499
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,319
Fwrank!

500
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,839
We're gonna watch television
when we get home.

501
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,883
Fwranh! Fwrank!

502
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,041
Stop it!

503
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,644
He needs some rest.

504
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,639
You were so young.
Why didn't you appeal?

505
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,526
I don't know. I thought
I got what I deserved.

506
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,799
But you don't feel that now.

507
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,684
No, now it doesn't matter.

508
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,686
You couldn't take a lot.
Might seem suspicious.

509
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,204
We just start driving?
Just like that?

510
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,363
You couldn't tell any
of your friends.

511
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,444
No one to tell, really.

512
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,682
I can't imagine you not being free.

513
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,727
I can't call myself free until I can
walk down the street, arm around you.

514
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,531
I'd like that.

515
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,043
Take you on road trips to
places we don't know a soul.

516
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,639
Like on the run?

517
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,799
Mmm-hmm.

518
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,162
That's right. On the run.

519
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,884
My ex-husband would never
let me take Henry away.

520
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,130
You know what that would mean.

521
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,961
I know.

522
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,119
All right, then.

523
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,959
I noticed a spot under the shower

524
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,519
where the water is finding
its way under the linoleum.

525
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,566
You don't want dry rot.
I'll tackle that tomorrow, okay?

526
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,403
Maybe it doesn't matter.

527
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,251
What do you want to do?

528
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,441
<i>I don't know.</i>

529
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,125
<i>I think you know.</i>

530
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,371
Come on.

531
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,441
Just say it.

532
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,731
<i>What's the matter?</i>

533
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,371
Is it cold?

534
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,450
You're a tough guy.

535
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,879
I think you could take it.

536
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,759
Is it too cold to grow things?

537
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,803
It's mostly farms.

538
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,644
It sounds nice.

539
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,164
Morning, sport.

540
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,641
Hey.

541
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,279
How'd you sleep?

542
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,641
Fine.

543
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,799
Um, I was wondering if you
could do me a little favor.

544
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,650
Top secret research.

545
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,639
Research?

546
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,367
Just a trip to the library to pick
up a book on Prince Edward Island.

547
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,083
Your mom says it's beautiful.

548
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,683
<i>Can you pick up the book, Hank?</i>

549
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,641
So, do you go to
school around here?

550
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,279
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

551
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,164
I just moved here from Chicago.

552
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,086
I'm supposed to try out
living with my dad this year.

553
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,719
Oh.

554
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,081
What happened?

555
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,279
The official reason is
I have an eating disorder

556
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,559
and they think a new school
environment will help.

557
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,359
But really, I think my mom
just wanted to get rid of me

558
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,639
so she can fool around
with her boyfriend.

559
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,559
I understand.

560
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:25,162
This guy, he just moved
in with my mom and me.

561
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,604
And now he wants you out.

562
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,208
- I don't think so.
- He will.

563
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,443
So they can have sex.

564
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,639
So, what are you reading?

565
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,399
I'm investigating my legal rights.

566
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,439
You see, I got into this
really great private school

567
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,759
where they only focus on drama.

568
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,611
No one cares about sports or
what kind of clothes you wear.

569
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,839
The teachers stay off your case.

570
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,451
It's really elevated.

571
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,568
But at the last minute, my parents
decided they didn't have the money.

572
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,199
Could they get a loan?

573
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,599
Oh, they have the money.

574
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,531
They're just using me as a
pawn in their sick little game.

575
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,245
What's that?

576
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,719
It's for my mother.

577
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,491
She wants to know if Canada
might be a good place to move.

578
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,245
And how do you feel about that?

579
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,008
Moving. Leaving your friends.

580
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,359
I'm asking because
that's what I had to do.

581
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,404
And frankly,
I consider it child abuse.

582
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,480
I don't know. Canada seems nice.

583
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,844
Do you even know if
they're taking you?

584
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,999
My mom wouldn't leave me behind.

585
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,959
When people have sex,
it affects their brains.

586
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,879
They can't see things normally.

587
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,320
It's like a drug.

588
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,319
I'm not sure if that's true.

589
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,839
Well, you're probably gonna
need an intervention.

590
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,088
Maybe even need to deprogram her.

591
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,807
- Deprogram her?
- Yeah.

592
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,525
This guy...

593
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,611
Does he have charisma?

594
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,001
Maybe.

595
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,319
Too bad your mom and my
dad couldn't get together

596
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,727
before this whole boyfriend
person showed up.

597
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,683
But then if you and I got married,
it'd be kind of like incest.

598
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,966
My mother doesn't
normally date anyway.

599
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,159
I see only one hope for you.

600
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,522
You need to find a way to
get him out of your life.

601
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,643
I don't know if that's possible.

602
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,729
Either you get rid of him, or he's
probably going to get rid of you.

603
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,439
<i>All these people
here love you a lot.</i>

604
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,599
<i>A lot of them don't even
know you and they love you,</i>

605
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,839
<i>because you represent so very much.</i>

606
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:37,119
<i>But I'm very, very proud that
I could put this show on for you.</i>

607
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,359
<i>And I hope next year
we can do better</i>

608
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,759
<i>so that you can sit in
a different position.</i>

609
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,566
<i>We love you, Mikey
Neufeldt. God bless you.</i>

610
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,963
What time is Women's League?

611
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,450
Women's League is Tuesday.

612
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,121
Mandy?

613
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,959
Hey, pal.

614
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,640
So that's the fool that
walked out on you.

615
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,321
You full? Yeah, Chloe?

616
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,639
He's good. You're a
good eater tonight.

617
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,729
Uh-Oh. Fribbles.

618
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,321
So...

619
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,002
Seventh grade. How about that?

620
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,919
Richard's thinking of
going out for lacrosse.

621
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,451
Aren't you, Rich?

622
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,039
Yeah. Maybe.

623
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,799
How about you, pal?

624
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,685
Lacrosse? Soccer, maybe?

625
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,880
Probably not football till you get a
little more meat on those bones, huh?

626
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,000
Actually, I was thinking of signing
up for modern dance group.

627
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,239
Well, I'm not sure that
would be such a good move.

628
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,919
I know how your mother
feels about dancing,

629
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,839
but people might get
the wrong idea.

630
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,599
They might think...

631
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,759
- They might think you're gay.
- Richie.

632
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,724
Or they might think
I like girls in tights.

633
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,727
You boys are reaching
that stage of life.

634
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,079
Probably time for us to have a
little man-to-man conversation.

635
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,044
I already had that
with my real dad.

636
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,079
I guess that just
leaves you and me.

637
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,199
It's okay. I'm up to speed.

638
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,439
Well, I'm sure your mother
gave you the basics,

639
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,519
but there are some things a
guy needs to hear from a man.

640
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,119
It can be difficult not having
a man around the house.

641
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,890
Who says I don't?

642
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,719
Before you know it, you two boys
will be going out on dates.

643
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,639
A couple of lady-killers!

644
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,959
If I was still in seventh grade,
I'd think you two were the cutest.

645
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,164
Gross. If you were still in seventh
grade, I wouldn't even be born.

646
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,924
Not to mention it'd be incest.

647
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,171
Were you serious?

648
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,799
About a guy hanging
around the house?

649
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,048
- What do you care?
- Hey.

650
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,239
You're my kid. I'd like
to know who's around.

651
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,771
Thanks.

652
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,965
- See you later.
- Bye, pal.

653
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,206
Henry, your mom is
some kind of dancer.

654
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:57,159
Most people wouldn't tackle the
cha-cha in this kind of weather.

655
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,759
Yeah. it was a little loud.

656
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,883
It's just music.

657
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,887
I just figured we were
trying to avoid attention.

658
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,963
Oh, come on, Hank.

659
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,481
You can have the next dance.

660
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,239
I'm going to go to bed.

661
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,646
Henry, wait!

662
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,931
Um...

663
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,803
There's something we wanted
to talk to you about.

664
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:28,886
After your father left, I thought
I would be alone forever.

665
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,009
I didn't think I would care
about anyone else besides you.

666
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,083
I'm really happy for you.

667
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:42,166
We're thinking Canada might be
a good place to start over.

668
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,320
Canada?

669
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,119
They speak English.

670
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,005
And you don't need passports
to get across the border.

671
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,402
Thanks for the research, bud.

672
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,242
We've decided to go together.

673
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,444
Will I ever see you again?

674
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,605
What are you talking about?

675
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,399
Do you even care about
what happens to me?

676
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,601
What?

677
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,329
You didn't think...

678
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,125
We're all going.

679
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,281
Really?

680
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,602
I would never leave you.

681
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,211
You would have to leave school.

682
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,279
And you couldn't tell anyone, okay?

683
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,962
We would just pack the car and go.

684
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,481
What about the roadblocks?

685
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,850
They're looking for a
man traveling alone.

686
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,641
They won't be expecting a family.

687
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,811
<i>A family.</i>

688
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,079
- Half.
- But, I just...

689
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,406
Half.

690
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,999
I'll be back in a little bit.

691
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,725
Hank, we still have work to do!

692
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,803
I know. I'm almost done.

693
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,041
Any luck getting that sex
fiend out of your house?

694
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,799
I don't think he's a fiend.

695
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,162
But, no. He's still there.

696
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,279
It's easy, you know.

697
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,323
Just tell your mom he touched you.

698
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,799
It's not like that anymore.

699
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,604
We're actually getting along.

700
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,839
They're going to take me
with them. To Canada.

701
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,201
When?

702
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,731
Tomorrow.

703
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,042
On the first day of school?

704
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,090
It's him, isn't it?

705
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,121
You're on the run.

706
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,251
This one, right?

707
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,411
Are you okay?

708
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,359
Probably just need some aspirin
before we hit the road.

709
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,404
- Let me take a look.
- No, I'm fine. It's fine.

710
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:14,244
If this is going to work, sometimes
you need to let me take care of you.

711
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,359
Oh.

712
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,721
Jesus.

713
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,159
- You need medicine.
- No, it can wait.

714
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,359
No, it's infected.

715
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,759
I'll send Henry to the
pharmacy. Let me do it.

716
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,919
It's okay. You go.

717
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,805
No, there's still too
much packing to do.

718
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,641
I don't think you're going
to make a run for it.

719
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,611
Okay.

720
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,599
How'd you escape?

721
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,325
It's not like that.

722
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,245
He trusts me.

723
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,399
Or maybe he was just waiting
for you to leave the house

724
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,489
so they could run off together.

725
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,443
<i>It's just like Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

726
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,959
Who?

727
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,079
They made a movie about them.

728
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,759
Bonnie was this woman who was bored

729
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,962
because she hadn't had
sex in a long time.

730
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,119
<i>This guy, Clyde just showed
up one day and took her away.</i>

731
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:25,325
<i>They drove all around, holding up
banks and living out of their car.</i>

732
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,161
<i>What happened to them?</i>

733
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:28,759
In the end, they got killed.

734
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:32,439
Federal agents tracked them and
gunned them down in an ambush.

735
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,599
The part where Bonnie gets killed

736
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,802
there's so much blood, my
mother couldn't even watch.

737
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,319
<i>Could you imagine if your
mom got killed in an ambush</i>

738
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,204
<i>and you were right
there watching it?</i>

739
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,399
<i>They probably wouldn't shoot
at you since you're a kid,</i>

740
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,170
<i>but you'd see the whole thing.</i>

741
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,163
It'd be pretty traumatic.

742
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,479
I bet you never did that before.

743
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,331
Now you'll always remember I was
the first girl you ever kissed.

744
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,959
It's a shame you're leaving
just as we started dating.

745
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,208
I'll have to find another
boy to make out with.

746
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,005
What's wrong?

747
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,879
Nothing.

748
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,719
If you're not up for this,
you need to let me know.

749
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,679
No, it's not that.

750
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,879
Because tomorrow you're
gonna say good-bye

751
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,199
to everyone you've ever known.

752
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,679
I've already said
good-bye. It's just...

753
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,719
We're gonna hit the road
and never look back.

754
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,199
There's gonna be roadblocks
and border-crosses.

755
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,279
I know, I know.

756
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,759
So, if you don't want this,
you need to tell me.

757
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,883
No, I do want this.

758
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,050
More than almost anything
I've ever wanted in my life.

759
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,610
Then what is it?

760
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:30,399
After Henry was born,

761
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,648
my body just

762
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,804
forgot how.

763
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,484
<i>The first time it happened, I woke
up with these horrible cramps.</i>

764
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,003
<i>I felt something slip
from me. It was tiny.</i>

765
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,006
<i>If I could have just held tighter.</i>

766
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,439
I know this is a very difficult
and painful time for both of you.

767
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:19,959
<i>My doctor said that this was
more common than we thought.</i>

768
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,686
<i>I was young. We could try again.</i>

769
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,522
<i>But two more times...</i>

770
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,204
<i>I'd start feeling the
nausea and the swelling.</i>

771
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,843
<i>We'd celebrate.</i>

772
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,722
<i>Began setting up the nursery.</i>

773
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,203
<i>Only to wake up feeling
betrayed by my own body.</i>

774
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,049
No...

775
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,444
No. No. No. No.

776
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,529
<i>By my fourth time,</i>

777
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,882
<i>we knew better than to celebrate.</i>

778
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,159
<i>We knew better than
to tell our friends.</i>

779
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,519
<i>Or think of baby names.</i>

780
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,959
<i>We hadn't even packed a
suitcase for the hospital</i>

781
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,479
<i>when the contractions started.</i>

782
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,359
All right. Two pushes. Two pushes.

783
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,639
Stop. Take a breath.

784
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,479
One more. One more. This is it.

785
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,206
- Last big one.
- This is it. Come on, come on.

786
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,199
- Push, push, push.
- There you go.

787
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,719
We'd made it.

788
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,841
What?

789
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,731
What is it?

790
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,241
<i>Maybe they just took pity on me.</i>

791
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,961
<i>They'd wrapped her in a pink
blanket and put on a diaper.</i>

792
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,327
<i>The only one she'd ever wear.</i>

793
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:30,769
<i>As I stared at this
beautiful little girl,</i>

794
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,167
<i>her long eyelashes,</i>

795
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,008
<i>her daddy's nose, my chin,</i>

796
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,003
<i>the little mouth that would
never take a breath,</i>

797
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,843
<i>I knew there would be no
further conversations.</i>

798
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,523
<i>No more attempts.</i>

799
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,170
<i>We were done.</i>

800
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,360
<i>The world had become a cruel place.</i>

801
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,999
<i>I stopped going for walks.</i>

802
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,679
<i>I couldn't leave the house.</i>

803
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,119
<i>I couldn't even open
a window at night.</i>

804
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,880
Eventually, when Gerald left,

805
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,730
I understood.

806
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,243
I'd become a prisoner.

807
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,607
I came to save you, Adele.

808
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,764
Tomorrow that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

809
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,445
I can't...

810
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,287
I can't give you a family.

811
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,603
You already have.

812
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,639
<i>By the end of the afternoon,</i>

813
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,879
<i>everything in the house
had been neatly separated</i>

814
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,402
<i>into essentials and
things we'd leave behind.</i>

815
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,759
<i>For no practical reason more than
it seemed like the right thing to do,</i>

816
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,883
<i>we cleaned each room.</i>

817
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,639
Is he even mine?

818
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,080
Huh?

819
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,365
Is he even my son?

820
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,085
You fool.

821
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,251
Mandy?

822
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,091
Mandy?

823
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,051
Mandy, honey?

824
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,561
No!

825
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,561
No, no!

826
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,531
Morning, son.

827
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,361
You all right?

828
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,804
Yeah, I'm okay.

829
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,884
You want to tell me
where you're going?

830
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,044
I'm just walking. Heading home.

831
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,526
Well, hop in.

832
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,359
Your parents are probably
worried about you.

833
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,244
It's just my mom. She's fine.

834
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,687
Well, just to be safe,
I'm gonna give you a ride.

835
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,839
I'm... I'm really fine.

836
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,724
You not going to make
me arrest you now?

837
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,362
School starts today, doesn't it?

838
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:50,407
What grade are you in?

839
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,199
I'm going to guess, uh, sixth.

840
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,999
- Seventh.
- Seventh.

841
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,759
I've got a son about
to start fifth,

842
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:00,851
although I guess you wouldn't
associate with a grade schooler.

843
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,242
So, what are you doing out here?

844
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:11,288
I left something at my dad's house.

845
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,606
But he'd already left for work.

846
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,247
Thank you for the ride.

847
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,961
No.

848
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,641
No.

849
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,801
No.

850
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,279
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

851
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:12,959
Found him by the side of the road.

852
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,605
Did you know he was out?

853
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,922
He said he'd be right back.

854
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,122
He's got to be in school in
a few minutes, doesn't he?

855
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,171
Sure does.

856
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,046
Thank you for bringing him home.

857
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,599
You going on a trip?

858
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,040
Hmm?

859
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,530
You taking a road trip?

860
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,571
Um...

861
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,521
No.

862
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,363
Just taking some old things
to sell on consignment.

863
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,207
You need some help?

864
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,211
I'll be fine.

865
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:55,239
I don't want to take you
away from your duties.

866
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,599
No.

867
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,371
I think the streets are
safe for the moment.

868
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,244
That's the heavy one.

869
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,890
Nice place.

870
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,051
Clean.

871
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,479
This one?

872
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,205
Mmm-hmm.

873
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,402
You weren't kidding.
What've you got in here?

874
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,083
Some old kitchenware.

875
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,199
Hey.

876
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,731
Thank you for your help.

877
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:59,286
A pleasure.

878
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,203
Got a good handshake
there, partner.

879
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,529
Have a good day, ma'am.

880
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,646
He seem suspicious?

881
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,439
I don't know.

882
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,839
We have to get out of here now.

883
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,719
Take Henry to the bank.
I'll finish up here.

884
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,450
- Hey.
- What?

885
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,490
We're going to be fine.

886
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,531
Okay.

887
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:47,844
Hey, Henry. Nice to
see you in here.

888
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,843
You need to sign it.

889
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,688
Hmm? Oh.

890
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,365
Of course.

891
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,361
Adele?

892
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,249
Thought you'd be in school today.

893
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,923
He has a dentist appointment.

894
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,970
On the first day of school?

895
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,611
My teeth hurt.

896
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,087
Oh, sorry.

897
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,370
Is Adele here?

898
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,922
Uh, she'll be right back.

899
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,767
She's dropping her kid at school.

900
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:46,328
I just brought these to
thank her for something.

901
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,801
Well, I'll make sure she gets them.

902
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,199
And you would like
this all in cash?

903
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,561
Mmm-hmm.

904
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,207
Yeah.

905
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,959
With an amount this large, I just need
to get it approved by my supervisor.

906
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,199
I'll be right back.

907
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,448
Is that really...

908
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,330
Are... Are you a friend?

909
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,010
Just the handyman.

910
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:25,679
I shouldn't have tried
to get so much.

911
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,406
I should have just asked for half.

912
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,679
It's gonna be fine.

913
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,609
They're just being extra careful.

914
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,559
- Hi, Adele.
- Hi.

915
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,764
I just wanted to make sure you
weren't experiencing any problems.

916
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,201
No.

917
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,810
Everything's fine.

918
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,999
Are they going somewhere?

919
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,959
I don't know.
It sure looks like it.

920
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:58,848
Well, maybe I should get my pan back,
then, in case they're gone for a while.

921
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,119
It's just a somewhat
unusual situation for us

922
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,164
having a person withdraw
this much in cash.

923
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,759
Normally, when transferring
funds of this quantity,

924
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,803
our clients prefer
a cashier's check.

925
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,290
Yeah, I, uh...

926
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:23,006
Yeah. Mmm.

927
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,119
Yeah, it's...

928
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:28,006
I just don't really get
out much anymore, so...

929
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,282
Did they say where they were going?

930
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,771
I'm just here to fix a few things.

931
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,288
Some would even call a withdrawal
like this a little suspicious.

932
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,839
Actually, we've packed
up all our things.

933
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,239
We're emptying our bank account

934
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,159
and then gonna make a
run for the border.

935
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,601
You know, like Bonnie and Clyde.

936
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,761
Of course you are.

937
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:19,160
Well, come on, Muriel, let's not
keep our friends here waiting.

938
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,925
We should go.

939
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,162
Get in here. Get in.

940
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:06,159
Henry's father called
and left a message.

941
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,679
Did you leave him
some sort of note?

942
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:10,239
I wanted him to know
that I'd be all right.

943
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,879
- Why would you do that, Henry?
- We need to go, now.

944
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,639
I just need to say
good-bye to my room!

945
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,799
Oh, Henry, don't! We need to leave!

946
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,684
Listen to your mother!

947
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,846
Henry!

948
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,845
Don't be scared.

949
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,331
What do we do?

950
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,999
Where do we go?

951
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,168
We have to get you out of here.

952
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,445
No.

953
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,959
<i>We have a perimeter.</i>

954
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,559
<i>Open the door slowly.</i>

955
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:01,527
<i>Step outwith your hands open and above
your head, palms facing forward.</i>

956
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:18,239
You're a fine boy, Henry.

957
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:21,728
Anybody who says otherwise
is not worth your time.

958
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:31,199
I'd take 20 more years just to
have another three days with you.

959
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,759
Open the door slow.

960
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,962
Hands above your head!

961
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,279
Keep them up!

962
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,039
- Hands above your head!
- On your knees!

963
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,279
- Get down.
- On your knees, do it now!

964
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,323
Hands behind your head!

965
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,484
All right, all right,
we got him! Move in!

966
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,325
Move to the kitchen.

967
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,239
Okay, I need to run some tests.

968
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,959
Don't be scared, son.
Your mom will be fine.

969
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,119
We got the guy.

970
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,520
He won't be able to do anything
to you and your mom anymore.

971
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,759
Ma'am, over here. I need you
to look over here, please.

972
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,803
- I'm going to cut the tape.
- Can you hear me okay?

973
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,722
<i>They charged him with kidnapping.</i>

974
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,359
<i>When my mother heard,</i>

975
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:23,159
<i>she drove to see the prosecutor
with me as a witness</i>

976
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,999
<i>to make him understand that no
unlawful detainment had taken place.</i>

977
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,839
He didn't hurt us.
He is a good man.

978
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,088
He was kind to my son.

979
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,084
<i>She omitted the fact
that they were in love.</i>

980
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:42,679
Adele, these situations
are never simple.

981
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,519
Never clean.

982
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,724
It may take years for you to
fully weave it all together.

983
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:51,679
Now, perhaps, before putting this
kind of statement into record,

984
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:55,521
you might want to take some time to
think about what actually happened.

985
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,602
Harboring a fugitive is a major
crime we don't look lightly upon.

986
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:04,364
And, of course, there is
delinquency to a minor.

987
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:07,408
You could lose custody of your son.

988
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,359
<i>They gave Frank 10 years</i>

989
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,404
<i>for the escape and 15
for the kidnapping.</i>

990
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:23,809
<i>My mother tried to visit him once,
but was told he was doing solitary.</i>

991
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:30,284
<i>She wrote to Frank, sometimes
daily, but received no response.</i>

992
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,719
<i>Eventually, a package arrived</i>

993
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:37,606
<i>containing all of her letters
stamped with a prison seal.</i>

994
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,601
<i>None of them had been opened.</i>

995
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:47,644
<i>She called to enquire and was
told Frank had been transferred.</i>

996
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:58,168
<i>Within a month, my mother voluntarily
relinquished custody of me to my father.</i>

997
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,799
<i>He rarely knew what to say.</i>

998
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,799
<i>More often than not,
he just kept quiet.</i>

999
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,651
<i>The newspapers had
said it all anyway.</i>

1000
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:16,959
<i>When I visited my mother,
she would act busy and distracted.</i>

1001
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,479
<i>Calls to make, chores to do.</i>

1002
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:22,799
<i>I think my presence
made her uncomfortable.</i>

1003
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,606
<i>A strange reminder
of what was missing.</i>

1004
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:30,207
All those two had was each other.

1005
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,364
That was enough.

1006
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,359
<i>By my junior year,</i>

1007
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:48,167
<i>people hardly brought up the events
leading up to seventh grade.</i>

1008
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:54,570
<i>For the first time, I had
someone to call a girlfriend.</i>

1009
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,319
There's something I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

1010
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:24,364
Oh, Dad, please. We're
having such a pleasant time.

1011
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:30,039
Everybody talks about all
this crazy, wild passion.

1012
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:33,403
That's how it goes in
the songs. You know.

1013
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,284
Your mother was like that.

1014
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:42,399
She was in love with love.

1015
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,728
She couldn't do anything partway.

1016
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,602
She was a terrific woman.

1017
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,286
Funny.

1018
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,285
So beautiful.

1019
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:06,126
A better man might have stayed around
and helped her through all that sadness.

1020
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:09,408
But I couldn't bear it.

1021
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:13,122
I just wanted a regular life.

1022
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:21,490
I don't know what these last
few years have done to repair,

1023
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:25,649
but I'm sorry I cut out on you.

1024
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,485
It's okay.

1025
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:36,482
I'm going to get the check.

1026
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,559
<i>The next day, when I suggested</i>

1027
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,239
<i>I move back in with my mother
for the rest of senior year,</i>

1028
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:50,090
<i>he didn't argue.</i>

1029
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:58,279
<i>And it was there in my mom's
kitchen, my final summer at home,</i>

1030
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:01,165
<i>that I first tried
my hand at baking.</i>

1031
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,891
Dear Henry.

1032
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,679
<i>I hope you will remember me.</i>

1033
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:12,479
<i>We once spent Labor
Day weekend together.</i>

1034
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:15,251
<i>Five of the best days of my life.</i>

1035
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:20,879
<i>I had always wondered who you would
become and what you would look like.</i>

1036
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,608
<i>And then one day, I came
across a familiar-looking pie.</i>

1037
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,568
<i>And there you were.</i>

1038
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,245
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

1039
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:39,079
<i>I will understand if you choose
not to respond to this letter.</i>

1040
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:42,409
<i>However, I am due to
be released shortly.</i>

1041
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:48,047
<i>I am no longer young, but I have
plenty of good health remaining.</i>

1042
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,319
<i>And I'd like to live much
the same way we discussed</i>

1043
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:54,649
<i>that weekend back when we
thought we'd be a family.</i>

1044
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:59,599
<i>Most likely, your mother
has remarried by now.</i>

1045
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,963
<i>But on the off chance
that she might be alone,</i>

1046
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:06,599
<i>I wanted to ask you whether
I might write her a letter.</i>

1047
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:07,959
<i>I promise you,</i>

1048
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:12,245
<i>I would sooner cut off my own hand
than bring any more grief to Adele.</i>

1049
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,359
<i>I wrote him back that day</i>

1050
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:21,769
<i>to say that it wouldn't be
difficult to locate my mother.</i>

1051
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,486
<i>She lived at the same address.</i>

1052
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,639
<i>I spent half of my life
worrying my mother</i>

1053
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:22,003
<i>wouldn't be able to go out
into the world on her own.</i>

1054
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:28,441
<i>But as it turned out,
she wouldn't have to.</i>
