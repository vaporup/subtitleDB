1
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:07,042
You scared me!
This is the Ladies' restroom.

2
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:08,736
I know.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,644
It's kind of getting late,

4
00:00:11,783 --> 00:00:15,241
and I'm bored.
Let's get out of here.

5
00:00:22,894 --> 00:00:26,557
Don't mind them.
Keep dancing.

6
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:28,256
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,766
You jerk!

8
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:36,435
Ohh...

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,945
You jerk!

10
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:48,352
Not again!

11
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:53,048
I saw this coming.

12
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:57,059
Take good care of yourself.

13
00:00:58,897 --> 00:00:59,864
Are you okay?

14
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:02,762
Thank God she didn't kill you!

15
00:01:04,603 --> 00:01:08,573
But I see she beat the crap
out of you.

16
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:11,440
She's such a cutie.

17
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:13,237
You sure this will work?

18
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:16,040
Trust me on this, man.

19
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:19,639
Never seen any North Korean
say no to this.

20
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:22,446
Some want this for a dowry.

21
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:23,554
Come on.

22
00:01:23,688 --> 00:01:26,248
- For a dowry?
- Sure!

23
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:30,252
We...

24
00:01:30,395 --> 00:01:32,056
Let's make up.

25
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:36,067
After me!

26
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:39,834
Come on, take it.

27
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:44,437
Is this to make up?
Or to hook up with us?

28
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:49,536
If possible, for both.

29
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:52,946
What's this?
It smells great.

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,334
What do you take us for,
beggars?!

31
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:18,638
You boys are so senseless.

32
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:21,345
Didn't her mom teach her

33
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,640
not to play with food?

34
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:27,240
What a waste!

35
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:36,553
It's hopeless.

36
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:41,755
Chul-soo, don't give up.

37
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:51,940
I'll work things out.

38
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:55,535
So you're looking for a way
to hook them up?

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,944
That's right!

40
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,142
Any ideas how to get them

41
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:04,654
as close as we are?

42
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,352
I have an idea!

43
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,755
You do? What is it?

44
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:10,258
Give me your ear.

45
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:18,226
What an idea!

46
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:21,930
You're not only pretty,

47
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:24,132
but very smart.

48
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:26,937
Wish you hadn't blown

49
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:30,241
into my ear, though.

50
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:33,248
In fact, I'm smarter
than Young-hee

51
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:36,251
That's what I think, too.

52
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:39,754
Chul-soo has bad taste
in women.

53
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:42,451
You really think so?

54
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:44,755
Of course!

55
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:46,256
If I'm

56
00:03:46,397 --> 00:03:48,262
lying to you...

57
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,367
...may I be struck by lightning

58
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:53,733
and my lips fried.

59
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:57,332
I'm so flattered.

60
00:03:57,475 --> 00:03:59,033
Umm.

61
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:02,340
At the zoo across the street...

62
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,849
...there's this secluded spot.

63
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:09,945
Why don't we go over there...

64
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:15,253
...and enjoy some privacy?

65
00:04:15,393 --> 00:04:17,861
What do you say?

66
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:38,740
Comrades, gather up!

67
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:47,051
What's going on here?

68
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:49,958
Our Great Leader sent us

69
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:52,358
to excavate these tombs.

70
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:57,257
And this is how you repay him?

71
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:59,632
Shame on you!

72
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:02,933
We should find the tomb

73
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:05,941
before they do.

74
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:09,444
What's wrong with that bitch?

75
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:13,039
She has no idea
what's more important.

76
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:15,049
Stupid cow.

77
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:16,949
Unit 1 here, and Unit 2

78
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:19,454
takes the other side.

79
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:23,759
Unit 3 comes with me.
Got it?

80
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:25,453
Okay.

81
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:29,064
Back to work!

82
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:42,444
I got them for you.

83
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:47,049
Another magic trick?
Quite a few this time.

84
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:50,552
What? That's...

85
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,056
Just kidding.

86
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:57,651
I've never received flowers
from a man.

87
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:01,656
Very sweet of you,

88
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,164
but I can't go out with you.

89
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:05,132
What the...

90
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:09,538
A respected revolutionary...

91
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:10,641
- What's next?
- Asia!

92
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,834
Lantern of Asia,

93
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:17,243
The sun of the race...
And the protector of the universe...

94
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:20,542
The successor to our
Great Leader...

95
00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:24,451
General Kim Jong-il once said...

96
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:28,047
'The healthy love of
young couples...'

97
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:32,151
'...brightens the future
of the Republic.'

98
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:35,560
Take these and give me a hug.

99
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:39,928
I'm not going out with you.

100
00:06:41,272 --> 00:06:43,740
Come in with me then!

101
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:47,039
Go after her.

102
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:56,743
He's a nice guy.
I'd date him, if I were you.

103
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:58,546
Have you forgotten?

104
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,248
He's from South Korea.

105
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:02,552
It's impossible.
It's just dating,

106
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:06,460
not like marrying him.

107
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:11,261
And we're in China now.
I don't see why not.

108
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:14,335
Hae-young, are you out
of your mind?

109
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:16,940
We're not here to meet guys,

110
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:18,838
but excavate the tomb!

111
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:22,344
I can't wait to go back.

112
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:27,550
What are you yelling at me for?

113
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:31,553
Whatever!

114
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,656
I don't care.

115
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:40,257
Maybe I should give up.

116
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:44,564
Chul-soo, you know what?

117
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:48,730
What she wants most is

118
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:51,441
to find the tomb, right?

119
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:54,136
You should find it before her.

120
00:07:54,278 --> 00:07:57,839
And use it as bait.

121
00:07:57,982 --> 00:08:01,349
Tell her you wouldn't mind...

122
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:04,849
...letting her receive credit
for finding the tomb.

123
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:09,751
See what I'm getting at?

124
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:12,856
She would be so touched...

125
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:17,161
...that she'd lie down
with her legs wide open.

126
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:19,735
That's it!
That's a good idea!

127
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,634
You're a genius!

128
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:24,841
I'm so impressed!

129
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:28,045
Cut it out, man.

130
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:30,044
You know what?

131
00:08:30,181 --> 00:08:34,550
When you see a doctor,
That's a good idea!

132
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:39,145
In this case, I was...

133
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:43,454
I got it.

134
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:47,052
I'm not that stupid.
I have it right here.

135
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:49,359
Show me the money.

136
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,365
Where is...

137
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:54,433
I don't have any.

138
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:59,532
No money?
You left it in the room?

139
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:10,052
I'm exhausted!
Let's take a break.

140
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:12,952
Comrades, take a break!

141
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:16,549
Stop playing with that flashlight.

142
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:18,659
- What's wrong?
- What?

143
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:22,755
- Have you gone insane?
- This just isn't you!

144
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:27,938
Staying at a luxurious hotel
has messed up your head.

145
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:28,834
Hey!

146
00:09:28,973 --> 00:09:32,136
We have to find the tomb

147
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:35,336
before they do!
Got that?!

148
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,143
Okay, good luck to you.

149
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:40,841
Keep digging.

150
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:42,953
He's gone crazy, girls.

151
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:44,554
Leave him alone.

152
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:48,557
Hey, where are you going?
It's not there!

153
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:53,254
Why don't you eat?

154
00:09:58,102 --> 00:09:59,330
What's wrong with her?

155
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,836
Eat with us, my friend.

156
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:04,134
Who says I'm your friend?
Out of my way!

157
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,539
We're eating here, man!

158
00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:10,340
No work, no food!

159
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:20,054
Look at this dust!

160
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:27,354
Hae-young!

161
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:29,762
Get over here.

162
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:32,631
Why can't a girl eat in peace?

163
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,136
Don't eat mine.
Sure.

164
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,034
Out of my way!

165
00:10:44,882 --> 00:10:48,045
Leave him be.
He's gone crazy.

166
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:52,347
Jesus, it's gotten all dusty.

167
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,151
- Min-chul!
- What?

168
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:57,261
I found the tomb!

169
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:58,453
Really?

170
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:01,656
He found it!

171
00:11:08,372 --> 00:11:10,340
Hae-young!

172
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,138
I think you dug too much.

173
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:18,644
You should've eaten
instead of digging this far.

174
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:21,651
Back up!

175
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:25,745
Stop pushing me!

176
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:35,356
It feels like we're in

177
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,529
'Indiana Jones.'

178
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,130
I'm not quite sure if this is it.

179
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,435
What do you think?

180
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:49,239
Give it here.

181
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:54,548
Is this the tomb?

182
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:58,351
- I Don't think so.
- Shit!

183
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:01,549
Nothing but a mural painting.

184
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:05,856
I know. It's a couple
getting married.

185
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:10,961
Maybe it's a sign that
I should get married, too.

186
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:12,433
Really?

187
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,835
Should I set you up with a girl?

188
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:16,837
I'd appreciate it, man.

189
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:18,635
Hey, get over here.

190
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:21,836
- I'm scared.
- It's okay. Come on.

191
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:25,647
You'll make a great couple.

192
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:30,852
- Damn!
- What the hell?!

193
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:37,756
- Chul-soo.
- God, you scared me!

194
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:38,953
Don't be.

195
00:12:39,096 --> 00:12:41,564
Keep your voice down.

196
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:45,032
What am I doing here

197
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:48,229
in the dead of night?

198
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:51,239
Don't chicken out now.

199
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,139
It was your idea.

200
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:57,145
Stupid! You got me wrong.

201
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:59,784
I meant do it during the day.

202
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:02,687
Look at all these bugs!

203
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:04,552
You should've told me so.

204
00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:07,556
Stop making faces at me!

205
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:11,757
Why didn't you tell me

206
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:13,261
to wear long sleeves?

207
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:16,560
Stop complaining. You just
loaf instead of working anyway.

208
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:20,034
I dug all day long!

209
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:26,434
Isn't that Chul-soo
and Il-Pyong?

210
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:28,536
Yes.

211
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,445
Who's that crazy woman, running
so fast over there?

212
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:35,450
That's Young-hee!

213
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:36,644
What!

214
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,250
One of them is going to die tonight.

215
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:43,257
What are they doing?

216
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:44,861
No!

217
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:45,962
Dibs!

218
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:48,458
I called it first!

219
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:50,567
I got here before you.

220
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:54,228
What are you talking about?

221
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:55,339
I called it first!

222
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:57,839
You said nothing but 'Dibs'!

223
00:13:57,975 --> 00:13:59,442
Don't you know what it means?

224
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:03,144
This is mine!

225
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,542
What the hell!

226
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:08,049
You see any 'dibs' here?

227
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,846
Make some sense!

228
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:12,148
You don't know
what you're talking about!

229
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:15,952
I won it fair and square!

230
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:18,561
You shameless piece of trash!

231
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:20,559
What'd you just say?

232
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,131
Oh. Mom...

233
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,239
God... my balls...

234
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:39,245
I'm really worried.
What if they kill each other?

235
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:41,044
Hae-young, my sweetie,

236
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:44,345
don't worry.

237
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:47,150
What do you mean?

238
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,852
They're alone inside.
Isn't it obvious

239
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:54,260
what they'll be doing?

240
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:57,265
Why don't we...?

241
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:00,026
You're embarrassing me.

242
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:05,339
Let's get out of here, and...

243
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:07,844
...see if we're a good match.

244
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:34,735
Young-hee!

245
00:15:34,872 --> 00:15:36,430
Young-hee, don't move.

246
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:41,938
Look out!

247
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:49,646
What happened?

248
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:54,247
I think it's collapsed!

249
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:09,027
Get off of me right now.

250
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:11,835
I know what I'm doing.
Keep your head down!

251
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,038
My knees...

252
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:21,049
and my head
are pounding like hell.

253
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:23,849
We're trapped in here.

254
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:25,250
What?

255
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,554
No! No!
Anybody out there?!

256
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:35,358
Help me!
Get me out of here!

257
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:37,464
Help!

258
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:41,628
Stop making a fuss.
Let's think of a way to get out.

259
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:45,731
I'm making a fuss?
Get your butt over here!

260
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:49,744
It's like I've dug a tomb
for myself.

261
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,348
You call that a fuss?
What the hell!

262
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:55,350
You do the thinking, bitch.

263
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:57,954
Get me out now!
Shut the fuck up!

264
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:00,949
You're using the 'F' word now?

265
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:03,651
I'm trapped in here
because of you!

266
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:06,661
Are you saying it's my fault?

267
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:08,355
You bet your ass it is!

268
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:10,262
What does my ass have to do
with anything?

269
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:12,926
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you!

270
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,039
Just looking to get your
tiny dick wet?

271
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:22,835
What?! I've got a small dick?

272
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,244
What do you know?

273
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:27,543
I'm sure no girl wants you

274
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:29,550
because it's so freaking small!

275
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:32,952
You're unbelievable.

276
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,854
I've been trying so hard
to win your heart...

277
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:37,255
...and this is what I get?

278
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:39,954
My package is big enough!

279
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:41,860
Stop yelling at me.

280
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:43,762
And don't lie...

281
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:47,337
I've never seen you
with any packages!

282
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:51,134
That's not what I mean!

283
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:53,937
You sure you speak Korean?

284
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:56,740
You don't understand jack!
I speak Korean, just fine!

285
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,247
All you do around here is

286
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:02,443
chase after skirts!

287
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:07,046
Surprise!

288
00:18:07,191 --> 00:18:09,955
You just drove a spike
deep into my heart, bitch!

289
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:13,359
Don't point at me!
I'm not a frigging carpenter.

290
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:16,057
And don't call me names!

291
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,431
Now you use violence?

292
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,539
Got a problem with that?

293
00:18:22,673 --> 00:18:26,336
You do the same then!

294
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:29,537
Enough of this chitchat,
go make a tunnel.

295
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,945
On my mark... 1, 2, 3!

296
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,744
I'm not a mole!

297
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:36,853
Doesn't it run in your genes?

298
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:39,455
I know you North Koreans

299
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,457
are good at making tunnels.

300
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:43,855
You made a lot of them
under the DMZ...

301
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:46,053
...to infiltrate into the South, right?

302
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:49,859
At least three of them!

303
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,160
You know what?

304
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:53,326
When I was in primary school...

305
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,335
...we'd go see them

306
00:18:55,472 --> 00:18:58,032
on school field trips.

307
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,633
What?!

308
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:04,441
Our Republic made tunnels
to invade the South?

309
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:05,240
Right!

310
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:08,146
You're saying our Republic

311
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:12,847
did such a dirty trick?
You're a damned liar!

312
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,651
Come on!

313
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,555
Let's get it on!

314
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:20,255
What are you doing?

315
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:21,762
Timeout!

316
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:25,926
It's been a while

317
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,635
since I took on a chick.

318
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:30,035
I got you!

319
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:35,939
Stop it!

320
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:41,245
What's this, a game?

321
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:47,791
You stupid liar!

322
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,555
You stupid liar!

323
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:00,534
Dickhead!

324
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:04,232
You beat the shit out of me.

325
00:20:04,374 --> 00:20:06,638
I'm the one
who should be crying.

326
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:08,745
Is that true our Republic

327
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,344
made those tunnels?

328
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:17,551
I know YOU didn't, okay?

329
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:19,856
So sensitive.

330
00:20:22,593 --> 00:20:26,654
As a matter of fact...

331
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:31,166
...we made many tunnels, too...

332
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:33,026
...for the subway.

333
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,731
I'm sure North Korea did it
for the same purpose.

334
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:40,842
It'd be great if we had subways
running through the DMZ.

335
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:42,639
Don't you think?

336
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:51,245
So I could come to see you

337
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:53,447
anytime I wanted.

338
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,252
Yeah, that'll be the day.

339
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:58,861
Laughing now?
Don't you know the old saying?

340
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:02,762
'Laughing when crying
makes the asshole hairy.'

341
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:07,126
Where are they?

342
00:21:07,471 --> 00:21:10,929
Where are my shoes?

343
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:13,440
They must've been buried.

344
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:15,738
I'll go find them.

345
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,732
Nothing.

346
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:43,235
Stay here. Let me look
for them again.

347
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:45,036
It's okay.

348
00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:47,040
I knew you'd say so.

349
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:49,839
I'll find them later...

350
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,949
...like that prince did

351
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,746
for Cinderella.

352
00:21:57,087 --> 00:21:59,146
Cinderella?

353
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:01,548
Who's that?

354
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:02,852
What?

355
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:05,859
You don't know?

356
00:22:06,897 --> 00:22:13,530
'Cinderella, Cinderella,

357
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,638
all I hear is Cinderalla...'

358
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:17,340
No?

359
00:22:17,674 --> 00:22:19,642
Let me tell you the story.

360
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:22,345
Once upon a time, there was

361
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:24,538
a pretty girl named Cinderella.

362
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:28,139
She had two stepsisters

363
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:30,549
who were like...

364
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:31,847
...so ugly and mean.

365
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:35,152
One day, there was a party

366
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:36,759
at the kingdom's palace.

367
00:22:36,894 --> 00:22:39,055
A fairy changed a pumpkin

368
00:22:39,196 --> 00:22:41,960
into a carriage...

369
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,363
...and gave Cinderella a gown
and glass slippers, for free.

370
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:46,526
Her and the prince danced
like crazy...

371
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,332
...until the clock struck midnight.

372
00:22:49,473 --> 00:22:53,034
She ran home so fast, she

373
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:55,940
lost her glass slipper.

374
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,344
The prince found it, and
visited every home in the realm.

375
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:02,543
Didn't he come by your house, too?

376
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:05,348
They were reunited and

377
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:07,855
lived happily ever after.

378
00:23:09,993 --> 00:23:10,960
Look out!

379
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:21,533
They should be okay, right?

380
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:26,030
It's quite spacious in there,
enough oxygen to breathe.

381
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:28,736
Let's be hopeful.

382
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:30,437
Young-hee, are you okay?
What a cutie!

383
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:43,657
What's this?

384
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:49,861
Let's see... we're done

385
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,524
with the Cinderella story...

386
00:23:51,668 --> 00:23:54,831
Should I tell you about
animation characters?

387
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:58,138
Astro Boy or Golden Bat...

388
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:01,039
What about a superhero...

389
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:03,738
No, you don't want to hear it.

390
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,441
It's okay.
Save your strength.

391
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:10,647
Why isn't the rescue party

392
00:24:10,787 --> 00:24:13,449
here yet?

393
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:19,762
I hope

394
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:23,566
they don't find us.

395
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:26,936
Just a thought.

396
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,234
What are you talking about?

397
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:35,836
I'm just saying that...

398
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:42,552
...the later they find us...

399
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:47,953
...the longer we can be

400
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:28,164
alone together.

401
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:30,858
Check this out!

402
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:34,227
What's going on here?

403
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:36,939
Trying to see whose lips
are thicker?

404
00:25:37,374 --> 00:25:40,935
You could've taken your time.

405
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:44,343
Should we have waited
for a few days?

406
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:46,039
We should have!

407
00:25:47,084 --> 00:25:49,746
Let's get out of here.

408
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,048
Easy.

409
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:05,025
- Here.
- What a night!

410
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,630
God, I'm tired.

411
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:14,642
Come on.
Get in.

412
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,541
Take care of yourself.

413
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:22,142
I hope they're okay.

414
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:28,546
Goodnight.

415
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:29,852
What?!

416
00:26:29,993 --> 00:26:30,660
I saw this coming!

417
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,958
I saw this coming!

418
00:26:33,897 --> 00:26:39,335
I can't let my girl ruin her life

419
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:43,539
over some South Korean asshole.

420
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:45,937
Send her back right now!

421
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:49,639
No, wait.

422
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,743
I'll send my men out there.
Keep an eye on her.

423
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:09,256
What does your dad do?

424
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,526
He's a powerful man.

425
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:15,832
Yeah? So you're strong
after your dad, huh?

426
00:27:15,972 --> 00:27:18,941
Does he work in the mining
or something?

427
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:22,238
Ever hear of the Ministry of
the Peoples' Armed Forces?

428
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,438
Yeah!

429
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:27,744
He's the Secretary.

430
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:33,149
How about your father?
What does he do?

431
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:40,856
Huh? He's a director of National...
uh... Gardens...

432
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:43,056
What's that?

433
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,533
Sorry. I'll look it up.

434
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:53,836
So...

435
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:55,239
He just...

436
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,546
He takes care of gardens.

437
00:28:00,884 --> 00:28:03,444
You know, gardens.

438
00:28:03,587 --> 00:28:07,353
For instance...
Like National Parks!

439
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,152
But a lot smaller in size.

440
00:28:10,293 --> 00:28:12,853
That's what he does.

441
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:18,163
Oh, I see.

442
00:28:18,268 --> 00:28:21,829
He looks after beautiful
flowers and trees.

443
00:28:21,972 --> 00:28:24,031
What a nice job he has!

444
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:27,234
Not really.

445
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:32,241
Not only are you pretty,
but so naive!

446
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:35,141
Let's go.

447
00:28:48,898 --> 00:28:52,732
Sorry!

448
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:57,738
I lost it right there. Stop it.
There are people watching us.

449
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,835
I know you liked it.

450
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:07,442
Where do people go
on dates in North Korea?

451
00:29:07,584 --> 00:29:09,449
To a cafe like this?

452
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:12,555
We're too busy studying
to date.

453
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:16,955
We don't fool around
like you do in South Korea.

454
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:21,254
Did you have a boyfriend?

455
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:23,463
Boyfriend? That's...

456
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,827
Boyfriend?

457
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:29,736
You mean a stud that I do
the mattress mambo with?

458
00:29:29,873 --> 00:29:32,433
So many guys have wanted to

459
00:29:32,575 --> 00:29:36,443
lead the Ilama to my lift shaft...

460
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:38,444
but no one's 'buried the burrito' with me, yet.

461
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:44,851
My cherry hasn't been popped.

462
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:47,351
Wanna slip me the sausage?

463
00:29:51,995 --> 00:29:53,758
You!

464
00:29:54,597 --> 00:29:56,861
Who taught you those
expressions?

465
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,762
How about my expressions?

466
00:29:57,901 --> 00:30:01,837
One of the girls from the South.
I bought her coke in return.

467
00:30:02,772 --> 00:30:04,433
Oh God!

468
00:30:04,874 --> 00:30:07,934
Listen to me very carefully.

469
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:09,540
Listen.

470
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:11,039
Even in the South, no decent

471
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:14,947
girls say those things.

472
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:17,645
Who was it?
Give me the name!

473
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:20,847
Watch what you're saying!

474
00:30:23,193 --> 00:30:25,058
I didn't know!

475
00:30:25,295 --> 00:30:28,162
I just wanted to impress you.

476
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,429
Sorry. I lost my cool.

477
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:38,535
You've put your father

478
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:42,042
in a awkward situation.

479
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:46,947
It's none of your business.

480
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:12,632
Young-hee!

481
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:14,334
What's wrong?

482
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:19,142
I'll be okay. It's just a cramp.

483
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:25,543
Wanna watch me change my pad
or something?

484
00:31:33,196 --> 00:31:35,756
You were faking it?!

485
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:52,337
Does it take this long
to change pads?

486
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:57,051
Il-Pyong, help me.

487
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:07,456
What are you doing?

488
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:09,258
Run like hell!

489
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,232
Go! Damn!

490
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:20,732
Is your house that way?

491
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:31,043
Wish I could come with you.

492
00:33:31,381 --> 00:33:33,747
I wanted to show you.

493
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:36,245
Chul-soo,

494
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:39,150
you found it!

495
00:33:39,989 --> 00:33:41,650
Let's go inside.

496
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:52,226
It's a great mural painting
from Goguryeo.

497
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:58,940
Not that I know much about art.
Just a little bit.

498
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:02,244
- Chul-soo.
- What?

499
00:34:02,378 --> 00:34:06,838
The couple in the painting
are not from Goguryeo.

500
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:09,745
This painting is

501
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:14,653
A Baekje girl and a Shilla man
getting married.

502
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:19,057
Why'd they have a wedding

503
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:22,961
in Goguryeo then?

504
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,337
I think they fled to Goguryeo.

505
00:34:28,471 --> 00:34:29,733
Fled?

506
00:34:29,872 --> 00:34:33,933
Back then, Baekje and
Shilla were at war.

507
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:39,144
Yeah, that's right.

508
00:34:39,983 --> 00:34:44,147
They must've loved each other so much.

509
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:51,349
Enough to flee to Goguryeo...

510
00:34:51,494 --> 00:34:56,056
...to stay together?

511
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:05,739
When I was in middle school...

512
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:12,039
...my mom died of cancer.

513
00:35:14,183 --> 00:35:15,741
And...

514
00:35:16,486 --> 00:35:21,253
If she were alive...

515
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:27,261
...she would like you a lot.

516
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:38,531
You know what?

517
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:44,446
Let's run.

518
00:35:45,581 --> 00:35:48,846
Like that couple

519
00:35:49,485 --> 00:35:52,045
in the mural painting...

520
00:35:57,894 --> 00:36:00,158
What do you say?

521
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:03,258
You don't love me enough?

522
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:03,152
Young-hee...

523
00:37:06,896 --> 00:37:08,659
I love you.

524
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:30,243
'Dear Chul-soo, as you know
I'm from North Korea...

525
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:33,246
...and there are still a lot of things
left to be done for my country

526
00:38:33,883 --> 00:38:35,942
I know you are a good fellow

527
00:38:36,085 --> 00:38:38,645
And I liked you from the beginning

528
00:38:38,988 --> 00:38:42,947
but I don't think that
we're meant to be together

529
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:44,957
I'm sorry and

530
00:38:45,194 --> 00:38:46,855
I wish you the best.

531
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:55,031
From Younghee'
Have you ever had Coke?

532
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:59,631
Why would I drink the black
water that Yankees drink?

533
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:02,039
Makes sense.

534
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,344
Are you expecting anyone?

535
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:11,753
What do you want?

536
00:39:11,888 --> 00:39:13,651
I'd like to see Young-hee.

537
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:18,053
Young-hee, it's him.
Go see him.

538
00:39:18,194 --> 00:39:19,855
She's out now.

539
00:39:19,996 --> 00:39:22,965
I'll wait for her then.

540
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:24,464
Hey!

541
00:39:25,268 --> 00:39:26,735
You!

542
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:29,235
This isn't the right thing to do!

543
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:31,636
You piece of crap!

544
00:39:31,874 --> 00:39:35,037
Didn't you hear him?

545
00:39:35,177 --> 00:39:38,635
This is a diplomatic residency.
You're asking for trouble!

546
00:39:38,781 --> 00:39:40,043
I'd like to see her

547
00:39:40,983 --> 00:39:43,042
one more time.

548
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:46,445
Stop!

549
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:49,457
Worm!

550
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:51,253
What are you, deaf?

551
00:39:51,494 --> 00:39:54,054
Leave before I blow
your head off.

552
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:55,455
I'm not armed.

553
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:58,431
Get the hell out!

554
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:01,627
I'm not going anywhere!

555
00:40:01,771 --> 00:40:03,329
Or... you're dead.

556
00:40:09,178 --> 00:40:12,147
- Young-hee!
- Dog!

557
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:14,246
Young-hee!

558
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:23,653
Young-hee, do you love

559
00:40:23,793 --> 00:40:27,160
this South Korean man?

560
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:37,630
This dog!

561
00:40:38,574 --> 00:40:41,941
Do you love him?!

562
00:40:47,383 --> 00:40:52,047
Are you in love with
this piece of trash?!

563
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:59,060
Just amoment!

564
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:01,561
- Asshole!
- Young-hee!

565
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:05,626
Young-hee!

566
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:08,937
Young-hee!

567
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:19,345
You stupid prick!
Stop right there!

568
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:25,250
Take one more step,
this dog is dead!

569
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:30,350
I don't love him.

570
00:41:31,193 --> 00:41:33,161
I never did.

571
00:41:33,996 --> 00:41:36,556
Young-hee...
Please

572
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:41,530
Young-hee!

573
00:41:42,772 --> 00:41:44,740
Young-hee!

574
00:41:45,574 --> 00:41:49,237
Wait... wait!

575
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,824
Sons of bitches!

576
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:48,630
How could they do this?

577
00:42:52,174 --> 00:42:54,642
Are you okay?

578
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,436
Does it hurt a lot?

579
00:42:59,782 --> 00:43:03,240
Let me tell you.
You should start working out.

580
00:43:03,385 --> 00:43:07,048
I know some great gyms
in the area.

581
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,754
Aren't you hungry?

582
00:43:10,893 --> 00:43:11,860
You need to eat well if you

583
00:43:11,994 --> 00:43:15,760
want to get back at them.

584
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:18,833
Let me

585
00:43:18,968 --> 00:43:20,731
go grab some stuff

586
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,737
to eat for you.

587
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:29,442
Jesus!

588
00:43:29,678 --> 00:43:32,044
What are you doing here?

589
00:43:36,585 --> 00:43:38,143
Chul-soo!

590
00:43:45,694 --> 00:43:49,653
I'll go buy some food.

591
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,030
What took you so long?

592
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:03,839
It took time for the pumpkin
to change into a carriage.

593
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:27,826
Young-hee...

594
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:30,736
You can go now.

595
00:44:30,873 --> 00:44:34,536
Gosh, look at you!
They messed up your face.

596
00:44:34,677 --> 00:44:38,238
Young-hee, I'll be okay.

597
00:44:39,381 --> 00:44:41,144
I don't want you to get

598
00:44:41,283 --> 00:44:43,945
in trouble for this.

599
00:44:44,086 --> 00:44:46,350
Go now.

600
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,850
Chul-soo!

601
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:51,960
They're in the lobby!

602
00:44:52,895 --> 00:44:54,453
Who?

603
00:44:54,597 --> 00:44:55,461
Those goon from North Korea!

604
00:44:55,598 --> 00:44:58,226
Get out of here now!

605
00:44:58,367 --> 00:45:01,131
They'll kill you!

606
00:45:02,871 --> 00:45:04,236
Get out of here!

607
00:45:04,373 --> 00:45:07,638
Get out of here now!

608
00:45:08,978 --> 00:45:11,344
Young-hee, leave now.

609
00:45:16,385 --> 00:45:18,444
Go!

610
00:45:18,587 --> 00:45:21,750
Why can't you ask me
to come with you?

611
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,358
Don't you love me?

612
00:45:24,493 --> 00:45:28,361
I can't pass a moment
without thinking of you.

613
00:45:28,497 --> 00:45:31,728
And you don't have guts
to take me away?!

614
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:23,238
Chul-soo Kim!

615
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:25,544
Stop right there!

616
00:47:43,198 --> 00:47:44,256
Back up!

617
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,527
Stay away from us!

618
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,147
Wait...

619
00:48:01,784 --> 00:48:02,944
Wait...

620
00:48:03,886 --> 00:48:05,751
Wait!

621
00:48:20,736 --> 00:48:24,695
Let's get started.

622
00:48:24,873 --> 00:48:26,135
Name?

623
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,341
Your name!

624
00:48:39,288 --> 00:48:42,849
Watch your attitude!

625
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:46,854
I'm chul-soo, Kim.

626
00:49:06,482 --> 00:49:09,349
Sir!

627
00:49:27,169 --> 00:49:29,831
Is it true that you're
stepping down?

628
00:49:31,273 --> 00:49:36,040
I apologize to my fellow Koreans

629
00:49:36,178 --> 00:49:38,544
for the actions of my son.

630
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,148
As of today, I'm resigning
from the position of...

631
00:49:42,384 --> 00:49:45,148
...director of the National
Intelligence Service.

632
00:49:53,896 --> 00:49:55,761
Mr. Chul-soo Kim?

633
00:49:55,998 --> 00:49:57,556
Going back to Yanbian?

634
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:01,328
You know you won't be
able to see her.

635
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,631
Not enough space to stamp.

636
00:50:03,872 --> 00:50:06,136
This is my last trip.

637
00:50:16,084 --> 00:50:18,746
It's been over a year.

638
00:50:19,688 --> 00:50:26,059
Nothing you can do about it.
Forget about him.

639
00:52:29,184 --> 00:52:31,152
So lovely!

640
00:52:31,286 --> 00:52:35,347
Never seen a cuter girl than her.

641
00:52:41,997 --> 00:52:43,760
You.

642
00:52:43,999 --> 00:52:46,024
Jealous? Then get married!

643
00:52:46,168 --> 00:52:48,534
Stop drooling over my girl.

644
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:49,728
I'm not.

645
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:54,934
That's sexual harassment!
I can have your ass arrested for it.

646
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:57,841
We're landing...

647
00:52:57,979 --> 00:53:01,938
in Pyongyang

648
00:53:02,084 --> 00:53:06,248
in 10 minutes.

649
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:11,050
Please, let us...

650
00:53:11,193 --> 00:53:14,162
Thanks for flying KAL.

651
00:53:14,496 --> 00:53:16,157
Have a good day.

652
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,245
What I have to show you
today are...

653
00:54:07,382 --> 00:54:10,545
...ancient remains found
at a construction site...

654
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:13,654
...in Shinheung, North Korea.

655
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:16,656
They're believed to be
from the Goguryeo Era...

656
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:19,852
...giving us an insight
to the Iron Age.

657
00:54:20,195 --> 00:54:22,060
What is most noticeable
is that...

658
00:54:22,197 --> 00:54:24,757
...Shilla and Baekje remains

659
00:54:24,866 --> 00:54:27,426
were also discovered...

660
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:29,730
...which is very intriguing.

661
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:38,335
This mural painting was found

662
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,641
5 years ago in Yanbian...

663
00:54:40,782 --> 00:54:44,240
...by a joint excavation between
South and North Korea.

664
00:54:44,586 --> 00:54:46,747
If you look at it closely...

665
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:50,051
...it's a Baekje and Shilla couple

666
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:52,558
getting married in Goguryeo.

667
00:54:59,467 --> 00:55:03,426
Recently discovered remains

668
00:55:03,572 --> 00:55:05,130
show us that...

669
00:55:05,273 --> 00:55:07,741
...as this mural painting does...

670
00:55:07,876 --> 00:55:10,037
...many Baekje and Shilla
couples fled to Goguryeo.

671
00:55:10,178 --> 00:55:12,840
In other words...

672
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:16,542
...they deserted their homelands...

673
00:55:16,685 --> 00:55:18,949
...for love.

674
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:26,256
Let me say that the power of love transcends...
...time and space.

675
00:55:28,096 --> 00:55:30,564
I bring this up, because...

676
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:40,039
...because I love a girl
who lives here.

677
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:43,134
I once thought about...

678
00:55:43,278 --> 00:55:48,648
...fleeing to another country for love.

679
00:55:50,085 --> 00:55:52,349
Great Leader,

680
00:55:52,487 --> 00:55:54,352
do you remember me?

681
00:55:54,489 --> 00:55:57,754
I was arrested for an incident

682
00:55:57,893 --> 00:55:59,758
5 years ago in Yanbian.

683
00:55:59,895 --> 00:56:03,160
I'm Chul-soo Kim, the son

684
00:56:03,298 --> 00:56:05,027
of a former NIS director.

685
00:56:07,168 --> 00:56:11,628
5 years ago... I fell in love with...

686
00:56:11,773 --> 00:56:14,139
...a girl from Pyongyang.

687
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:16,635
We loved each other enough

688
00:56:16,778 --> 00:56:21,044
to give up everything.

689
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:25,644
But we didn't run as that
couple in the painting did...

690
00:56:26,688 --> 00:56:31,148
...for I loved everything that

691
00:56:31,293 --> 00:56:34,751
she loved.

692
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:37,456
So did she!

693
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,431
Nothing can separate us!

694
00:56:40,568 --> 00:56:42,729
Today...

695
00:56:43,672 --> 00:56:45,537
...I'd like to ask a question...

696
00:56:47,075 --> 00:56:49,942
...to the love of my life.

697
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:39,654
What took you so long?

698
00:57:39,894 --> 00:57:45,025
It took time for the carriage
to change back into a pumpkin.

699
00:57:46,768 --> 00:57:53,640
Don't ride anything that changes
from now on.

700
00:58:00,582 --> 00:58:03,050
Great Leader!

701
00:58:03,685 --> 00:58:07,951
Allow us to get married.

702
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:12,952
Please, let us stay together forever.

703
00:59:36,478 --> 00:59:39,447
Thanks for watching.

704
00:59:39,581 --> 00:59:42,448
I appreciate all the staff

705
00:59:42,584 --> 00:59:44,848
who worked so hard!

706
00:59:44,986 --> 00:59:46,544
Thank you!
