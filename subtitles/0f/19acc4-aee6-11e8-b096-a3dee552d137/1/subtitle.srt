Directed by Cho-shin Jung

00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:32,892
Ancient tombs found
in Yanbian, China

7
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:40,934
Estimated to date from Goguryeo
Era, perhaps 2,000 years ago

8
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:46,600
North and South Korea to form
a joint-excavation party

9
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,188
Hi!

10
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,390
It's been a while, man.

11
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,897
Ah, the lovely scent of perfume!

12
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:20,604
Girls, here comes Chul-soo,
your prince!

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,705
- Let's go.
- Come on!

14
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,978
She looks hot.

15
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,177
'Blue Marine'?

16
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,789
How did you know?
Oh my!

17
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,194
You're the cutest guy
I've ever seen!

18
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:49,595
Where did you buy
that perfume?

19
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,004
I'd like to get it

20
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,902
for my girlfriend

21
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:01,202
She's your type.
Say hi.

22
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,377
Hi there.

23
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,582
She's way past her expiration date.

24
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,588
Hey cutie, where's your table?

25
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,486
Hey, good-looking!

26
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,289
Wow, Chul-soo, she's a fox!

27
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,496
She's mine, boys.

28
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,598
Come on.

29
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,905
How's it going?
What's this?

30
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,406
- What are you doing?!
- A piece of string!

31
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,409
So long.

32
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:13,803
Let's light it!

33
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,893
Let me set you on fire tonight.

34
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,604
They made it to the finals
through harsh competition.

35
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:49,807
Now the final round begins!

36
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,994
Let me read the question.

37
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:17,098
In 1975... our Great Leader,
Comrade Kim II Sung...

38
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,009
...visited an industrial site

39
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,910
and gave a speech.

40
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,179
What was his teaching
on that day?

41
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,291
A Great Leader of
the Korean peoples...

42
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,994
A forerunner that leads

43
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,901
the history of Asia...

44
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,805
A respected revolutionary...

45
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:54,208
The Sun of the race,

46
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,872
Lantern of Asia...
He got it wrong?

47
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,075
The order's mixed up.

48
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,187
- 'Lantern of Asia' comes first.
- That's right!

49
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,290
In the course of his life,
his only concern was...

50
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,691
...to make our lives better off.
He couldn't put more emphasis...

51
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,890
...on increasing the output
of cereals, and...

52
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:19,198
He's wrong again!
It's grains, not cereals.

53
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,909
You're joking, aren't you?

54
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,102
You're so funny.

55
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,803
I need to look for a job.

56
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:32,077
There's no way
I'm going to Yanbian.

57
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:36,587
Mr. Chul-soo Kim. Do you think you could
find a job in the real world?

58
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,484
What a mean thing to say!

59
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,183
You're too mean.

60
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,386
Hi. What's your name?

61
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,689
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

62
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,389
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

63
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,791
What do you want a job for?

64
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,197
What?

65
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,601
I'm not gonna be a bum
after I graduate.

66
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:56,901
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

67
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,378
You crack me up!

68
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,680
I know.

69
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,481
Forget about it.

70
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,783
Because you're not graduating!

71
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,793
What are you talking about?

72
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:18,590
A supreme commander
of the armed forces...

73
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,598
The almighty leader of
the Korean peoples...

74
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:27,604
General Kim Jong-il...

75
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,506
...has made our military invincible...

76
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,511
...on the road to completing

77
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:39,084
- the revolution.
- Not a single mistake!

78
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,278
The hardest part is over.
She's going to win!

79
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,683
The morale of our military
soars high to the sky...

80
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,884
...and our passion reaches
every corner of the world...

81
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:55,399
...like the violent waves
of the oceans!

82
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,482
- Mr. Chul-soo Kim.
- Yes?

83
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,587
This is your last chance.

84
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,890
- If you go to Yanbian...
- What?

85
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,891
...I'll let you graduate.

86
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,691
I'm not going!

87
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,993
You'll be the representative.

88
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,103
No way!

89
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,499
No? That's a shame.

90
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,007
I thought you might
be interested.

91
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,704
I've got to get going.
Bye.

92
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,573
Screw the tombs!

93
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:51,179
I'm busy enough trying
to dig up chicks in Seoul.

94
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,789
You'll be going with college girls

95
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,202
Our Great Leader,
Comrade Kim II Sung...

96
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,398
...designed this competition
for college students.

97
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:16,004
And the Kim II Sung Award goes to...

98
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,878
...an archeology major
at Kim II Sung University...

99
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:28,590
...Comrade Young-hee Oh!

100
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,181
You can't film here!

101
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,880
This is the National Intelligence Service!

102
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,788
No filming the NIS!

103
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,795
Dad!

104
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,988
Calm down.

105
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,191
You're totally mistaken.

106
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,595
Mistaken, my ass!

107
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:18,909
Dad... you really hit me...
in my stomach... hard...

108
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,309
I meant to!

109
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:26,578
I might as well disown you,
you pathetic Casanova!

110
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,084
Put it down.

111
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,679
Going to Yanbian for what?

112
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,189
To pick up girls?

113
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,192
Is that the latest hot spot for
hooking up or something?!

114
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,491
Dad!

115
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:49,697
Relax, okay?

116
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:54,004
Like I said, you totally got it wrong.

117
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,704
Save it!

118
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,180
I don't want to hear it.

119
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,079
I'm not lying!

120
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,686
Why did you take it off?

121
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,187
Because I'm hot!

122
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,188
If not for girls, what would

123
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,293
you go there for?

124
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,689
- Dad!
- Don't 'dad' me!

125
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,297
In this building,

126
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,096
I am an NIS director!

127
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,102
It's to graduate!

128
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,540
That's why I'm going!

129
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,565
To graduate?

130
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,109
That's right!

131
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,112
I'm shy of some credits
to graduate.

132
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,182
They'll give me credits
for going there.

133
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,081
I swear it's not about girls.

134
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,485
What are you doing?

135
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,287
Anybody there?

136
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,394
So, it's for credits?

137
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,498
Dad, let's have some tea.

138
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,311
Sure.

139
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,082
You must be really close.

140
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,590
I mean, hugging like that.

141
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,990
Huh?

142
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,699
You're a carbon copy of
your father.

143
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,599
So handsome!

144
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,779
He looks more like
his late mom.

145
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,614
Are you okay?

146
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,379
God, you've got coffee

147
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,487
all over your legs.

148
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,590
Miss Kim, get me
a glass of water.

149
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,284
- Yes, sir.
- Why don't you...?

150
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,892
Sorry I lost it there.

151
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,298
And I'm about to!

152
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,798
To graduate?

153
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:06,803
If you're lying,
you're dead meat.

154
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,178
Hi, Professor. Lee.
This is Chul-soo's dad.

155
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,879
How are you?

156
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,087
Let me ask you something.

157
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:23,890
Does my son have to go

158
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,094
to Yanbian?

159
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,699
What happened to that
glass of water?

160
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,495
Thanks. Bye.

161
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,704
Start packing!

162
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,207
If you mess up again...

163
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,004
I will bury you next to that tomb!

164
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:54,288
I should've sent him
to the military academy.

165
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,495
Young-hee.

166
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,902
I'm so proud of you!

167
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,005
Suitors will be

168
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:13,100
lining up after you.

169
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,873
You must be tired. Go to bed.

170
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:22,776
- Goodnight, father.
- You, too.

171
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:30,586
Why'd you bring it up?

172
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:43,604
She's still too young
to get married!

173
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,504
Don't be like that.

174
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,614
It's for her sake.

175
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,184
Have you forgotten?

176
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,085
When you proposed to me...

177
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:02,385
...you said love was all
that counted.

178
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,986
Give her some space.

179
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,099
Pipe down!

180
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,803
I'll make sure she marries

181
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:16,401
only the best.

182
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,106
Just watch!

183
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,901
'Screams echo away
as waves in the ocean...'

184
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,702
'A beautiful youth,
beautiful memories...'

185
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,402
Gosh, I missed it again!

186
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,911
I can't breathe, singing this!

187
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,884
This is way harder than
memorizing speeches!

188
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,895
Isn't that Young-hee Oh?

189
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,797
Right!

190
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:21,895
An archeology major
at Kim II Sung University

191
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,607
Who's going?

192
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,814
- Why don't I...
- No way!

193
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,481
Don't you have some things
with you from Japan?

194
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,487
You give it a shot.

195
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:42,587
She won't fall for them.

196
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:47,392
Every girl is materialistic.
It's a piece of cake.

197
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,999
Let me go talk to her.

198
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,008
Aren't you Young-hee Oh?

199
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:03,478
You won the Knowledge

200
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,879
Competition, didn't you?

201
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,885
How'd you know?

202
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,280
I thought so.

203
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,785
I was in the competition, too.

204
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,696
I didn't do well, though.

205
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,392
I see.

206
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,408
Young-hee.

207
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,581
This is for you.

208
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,476
Wow, isn't this Coke?

209
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,486
This is so hard to get around here.

210
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,193
No thanks. I can't take it.

211
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,196
Please, I want you to!

212
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,192
And... Young-hee...

213
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:02,706
Can I see you tomorrow?

214
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,400
Why don't we...

215
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,374
You pathetic player!

216
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,780
You gotta study harder.

217
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,890
Wow!

218
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,492
Young-hee!

219
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,092
Sorry I'm late.

220
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:30,693
What's that boy doing
on the ground?

221
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,704
Beats me, Hae-young. He was there
when I got here.

222
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,486
Is that true?

223
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,088
Don't be too excited.

224
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:56,385
I'd never send you to Yanbian.

225
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:01,798
But it's a direct order
from our Great Leader.

226
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,095
I couldn't say no to him.

227
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:13,100
I'll do my best as the leader
of the excavation party.

228
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,186
Keep this in mind.

229
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,484
There'll be boys from the South.

230
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:30,994
So behave yourself.
Okay?

231
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,391
Don't worry.

232
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,592
I won't let you down.

233
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,200
- Father.
- What?

234
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,103
Thank you so much!

235
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,006
What are you doing?

236
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,702
Stop it!

237
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:59,081
Don't thank me.
Thank our Great Leader.

238
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,300
Eat well

239
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:52,103
and be a good girl.

240
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:59,881
Where the hell is he?

241
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,578
What the...

242
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,687
This is... Aren't you hot, Mr. Kim?

243
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,372
Welcome!
We've been expecting you.

244
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,982
Thanks.

245
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,005
Girls of Yanbian...

246
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,709
Here I am!

247
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,109
Others are coming tomorrow.

248
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:06,374
It's small, but you'll find it
to your liking.

249
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:11,287
If you need anything,
call me at the embassy.

250
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,389
Thank you.

251
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:25,494
This is so exciting!
Let's unpack.

252
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:42,778
Do you like you room?

253
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,486
Let's go.

254
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:54,187
I've once dug up a tomb twice

255
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,698
the size of a mountain.

256
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,598
No big deal, though.

257
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,103
That's a primary school.

258
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,400
3 years ago...

259
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:09,811
...we found one, 10 times
bigger than a pyramid.

260
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,781
You can count on me.

261
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,582
You got yourself an expert.

262
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:22,284
In Yanbian, Il-Pyong is known
as Mr. Tomb!

263
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,793
Who's that?

264
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,592
Oh, I forgot to tell you!

265
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,701
My name's Il-Pyong Kang.

266
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,701
Look,
Il- Pyong.

267
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:36,704
Don't mind the tombs.

268
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,003
Your job is to dig up
chicks for me. Okay?

269
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,307
What, aren't you a guide?!

270
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,971
I am.

271
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,477
You can go home now.

272
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,485
I'm off to do market research.

273
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,991
What a self-absorbed ass!

274
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,990
That way goes to the park,
not any markets.

275
00:24:56,127 --> 00:25:00,086
The scenery is breathtaking,

276
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,200
you idiot!

277
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,479
Help me!

278
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,685
Help!

279
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,393
I can't swim!

280
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,686
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

281
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,497
I can't swim!

282
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:56,612
He's here.

283
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,182
Come on in!

284
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,784
What do you want?

285
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,284
You ditched me like I was...

286
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:07,981
What on earth are you
giggling about?

287
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,185
Find a girl for me.

288
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,387
A girl?

289
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,091
That's right!
That's an attitude, man.

290
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,895
What girl?

291
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,903
I ran into her today.
She's gorgeous.

292
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,000
Where?

293
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,899
At the park.

294
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:28,012
Talk about a needle in
a haystack...

295
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,909
What does she look like?

296
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,575
Long-nosed like me...

297
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:37,084
Her thick lips were so sensual.

298
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,986
About 170-cm-tall...

299
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,683
Kind of slim, but graceful.

300
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,691
For instance...

301
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,791
Like this lady!

302
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,897
Let me see.

303
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:55,905
You've got unique tastes
in women, Chul-soo.

304
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,010
You're into middle-aged

305
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:03,012
Just the style, man!
She's my mom!

306
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,276
She looks so generous.

307
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,785
As you know,

308
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:13,789
this kind of thing costs...

309
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,291
- Right!
- the more, the better.

310
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:20,091
- Yes.
- Some more.

311
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,799
Don't worry about it.

312
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,894
What's this?

313
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,406
Am I looking for a dog?
This is a joke.

314
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:37,778
Let me give you some more.

315
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:43,012
Here you go.
This is like 30 dollars.

316
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:47,581
What is this shit?
Excuse my language.

317
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,287
You go find her,
you ignorant cheapskate!

318
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,294
I thought that was a lot

319
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,093
for you guys here.

320
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,702
What the hell...

321
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,501
This is what I'm taking about!

322
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,506
Fork it over, nitwit.

323
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,007
Hang on.

324
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,204
You want South Korean money?

325
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,577
It costs a lot of money
to find a person.

326
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,081
Hold on!

327
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:18,281
Yanbian isn't the boondocks.
This is more like it, dolt.

328
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,983
Stop calling me names!

329
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,994
This is Yanbian, and

330
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:30,590
I'm much older than you.
I can call you whatever

331
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:34,603
I want to. Okay?
I'll find her for you.

332
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,401
Don't you worry a thing.

333
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,306
Where the hell is she?

334
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,875
Hey!

335
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,881
Where have you been all day?

336
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,884
Sorry, Hae-young.

337
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,280
Have you eaten?

338
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,284
You haven't eaten all day?

339
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:58,088
Grab your bowl there.

340
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,579
Slow down, girl.

341
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,681
Happy to be away from

342
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,879
that 'get married' garbage?

343
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:34,087
Even rice tastes better here.
It's sweeter than honey!

344
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:42,202
The North Koreans are running late.

345
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,604
They'll be here shortly.

346
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:49,704
Just my luck!

347
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,281
I can't believe the professor

348
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,883
is the prettiest woman here.

349
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,076
Yes? Got a question?

350
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,679
Of course not.

351
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:04,693
I'm so getting back at him!

352
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,990
Oh, they're here!

353
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,595
Who?

354
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,996
What?

355
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:20,800
He's so cute!

356
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,106
Cute? Please!

357
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,087
We should've sat in the back.

358
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,789
Why don't you guys say hi

359
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,590
to one another?

360
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,405
It's a stone tomb from

361
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,099
the Goguryeo Era.

362
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,800
Relatively small,

363
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,004
but its historical value...

364
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:59,082
...can't be overemphasized.

365
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,882
This project is very significant.

366
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,080
Why is he staring at us?
He must have a crush on me!

367
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,690
This tomb...

368
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,088
very important...

369
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,586
My heart's pounding so hard!

370
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,197
He's looking at the professor.

371
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,890
I'm telling you!

372
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,901
He's checking us out.

373
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,595
You've got to be watch him!

374
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,705
Many ancient Goguryeo tombs

375
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,502
have been found here.

376
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:28,407
In this circled area alone...

377
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,277
...more than 10 of them have
been unearthed over the years.

378
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,975
Don't be shy,

379
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,882
you cutie you.

380
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,682
A military post stood here
during the Japanese rule.

381
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:42,884
So, be cautious at all times.

382
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,994
Chul-soo Kim from South Korea?

383
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,791
Yes, ma'am!

384
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,900
I'm the party leader.

385
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:53,094
He's the leader of the South?

386
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,205
Good for you!

387
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,798
Young-hee Oh from North Korea?

388
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,410
Yes, ma'am.

389
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,370
Let's work hard together

390
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,779
to find the tomb.

391
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,887
It will be a step toward
reunifying the two Koreas.

392
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,785
Step forward, please.

393
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,788
Shake hands.

394
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:28,902
Your hand is so soft.

395
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,808
Please...

396
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,795
Young-hee!

397
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:57,299
That's your name, right?
I was wondering...

398
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,995
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

399
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:04,199
You came all the way here
to hit on girls?

400
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,607
You think you're hot stuff?

401
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:11,476
You totally got me wrong.

402
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,484
As leaders of both parties,

403
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,280
we've got things to discuss.

404
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,184
Zip it up!

405
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,687
Zip up what?

406
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:20,984
Hey. You.

407
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,094
Don't forget what you're here for.

408
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,593
Later!

409
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,898
Young-hee, let's go.

410
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,294
I know what I'm here for!

411
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,301
Lord almighty...

412
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,202
The wind feels so creepy,

413
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,503
doesn't it?

414
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,505
- Look, Chul-soo.
- What?

415
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:45,377
You know the girl
you asked me to find?

416
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,381
- Yes.
- I found her.

417
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,678
Where?

418
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,079
Look straight ahead.

419
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,084
- She's the one, isn't she?
- Right.

420
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,785
I thought so.

421
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,190
Check out that bomb

422
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,696
next to her.

423
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,994
Getting rid of her
won't be easy.

424
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,800
You can say that again.

425
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,201
Any ideas?

426
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:16,404
No matter how bad,

427
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,675
there's always a way out.

428
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:22,886
Let me tell you.

429
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:27,282
I was with the bomb squad...

430
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,391
...serving in the Chinese

431
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,690
People's Army...

432
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:37,995
...defusing bombs...

433
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,205
Oh, that!

434
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,308
You're a fast learner, Huh?

435
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,205
I'm smarter than you think.

436
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,874
Whatever.
You know what?

437
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:55,374
It might look easy to you.

438
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,388
But a bomb like her is very
hard to defuse.

439
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,186
Yes. But...

440
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,988
Give me a little more.
You won't be sorry.

441
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,690
Can I write this off?
Just kidding!

442
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,894
This is enough.

443
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:14,004
This'll help me...

444
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,698
disarm her.

445
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,503
I'm counting on you.

446
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:24,874
Chul-soo, trust me.
We're compatriots.

447
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,179
I'll blow her into pieces.

448
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,980
She's done for.

449
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,189
They've got everything

450
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,095
here in Yanbian.

451
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,692
So do we in the Republic!

452
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,101
- Young-hee.
- What?

453
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,905
Look!

454
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,970
Isn't that a dance club?

455
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,676
Let's go there tonight

456
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,482
and have some fun.

457
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,191
Comrade, are you nuts?

458
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,295
That's a symbol of
corrupt capitalism.

459
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,689
Stop calling me comrade!

460
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,891
It's so embarrassing.

461
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,904
Stop yelling at me.

462
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,005
This is China.

463
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:26,098
Whatever I call you,
they don't understand.

464
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,505
Please, go.

465
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:32,082
Think of it as studying,

466
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,776
experiencing new things.

467
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,287
Over my dead body!

468
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,584
Fine! Let's not!
Don't be upset.

469
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,495
Hae-young.

470
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:52,195
Do this for me. Please!

471
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,980
Putting on lipstick is
harder than studying.

472
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,282
Everything is hard at first.

473
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:16,189
I'll help you put it on in a minute.

474
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,992
Get over here and help me

475
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,999
fix my lips now!

476
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,300
I thought you didn't want to go?

477
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:33,310
Okay, I'll do it now.

478
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,778
Look.

479
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,991
What's the matter now?!

480
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:01,393
What if diplomats or other
students see us?

481
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,302
No diplomats here!

482
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,908
And the others won't rat on us...

483
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,909
...because that means
they were here, too.

484
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:11,476
Forget about them
and let's have fun.

485
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,173
Still...

486
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,784
Stop being a party pooper!

487
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,888
Keep your mouth shut

488
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,990
and follow me!

489
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,206
So many cute boys here!

490
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:44,872
You call that dancing?
They dance like zombies!

491
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,777
I'll get you girls a table.

492
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,698
Even the waiters are cute here!

493
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,801
Right here, girls.

494
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,495
Have a seat.

495
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,297
What can I get you?

496
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,401
Chinese beer. You?

497
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,513
- Beer from Pyongyang.
- I'll be right back.

498
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,680
- Look who's here!
- What are you doing here?

499
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,688
Mind if we sit?

500
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,586
You already have!

501
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,490
Who would've imagined
running into you here!

502
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:35,395
This club rocks!

503
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,292
Yes, sir?

504
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,803
A bottle of whiskey...
Some beer?

505
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,908
- 10 bottles!
- You heard the man.

506
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,506
Shake a leg, okay?

507
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,306
On the double.

508
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,477
Bite it hard!

509
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,074
Let's party like there's no tomorrow.

510
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,880
Wow, that was quick.

511
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,997
How'd he do that?

512
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,186
Awesome!

513
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,291
Are you guys ready?

514
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,689
You bet!

515
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,090
Here we go.

516
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,704
Grab your...

517
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,878
She must be a drinker.

518
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,992
That's good for us.

519
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,601
What's up with you?
Slow down.

520
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,099
What a finish!

521
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,796
Are you okay?

522
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,184
What are you doing?

523
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:41,185
It's called a 'Cannon Shot'
in the Republic.

524
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:44,089
Go ahead.

525
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,794
Me?

526
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:57,007
My stomach...
I need to hit the head.

527
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:01,609
What a wimp!

528
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,079
Where are you going?

529
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,079
Is she okay?

530
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:23,391
Never been at a disco with a man.

531
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,101
I have, but not with a pretty

532
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:31,196
girl like you.

533
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:36,006
Let's get to know each other better.

534
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:37,875
Stop peeking.

535
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,880
But they Look so good.
