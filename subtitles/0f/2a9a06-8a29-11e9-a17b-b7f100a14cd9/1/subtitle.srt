1
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:23,181
All we can do is try to publicize the facts.

2
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,524
Not what the government is saying,
but the facts.

3
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,219
And not simply parrot or regurgitate...

4
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:34,396
what the government's saying,
because that's largely bullshit.

5
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:40,231
It was the dead of winter.

6
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:43,100
I don't remember it ever being so cold.

7
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,234
And we were on a mission.

8
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,212
A bunch of us had volunteered
to drive our good friend to his new home...

9
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:53,012
the Schuylkill Federal Prison
in the middle of Pennsylvania.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,384
He called himself Phiber Optik.

11
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:59,447
You'd have to look hard to find someone
who didn't think he was brilliant.

12
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:03,090
Before we left, we had a night of fun...

13
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:06,563
in the streets of Philadelphia,
in the middle of an ice storm.

14
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,197
Phiber learned by exploring.

15
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,792
He was never too busy to explain...

16
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:12,733
howthings worked to anyone interested.

17
00:01:12,837 --> 00:01:15,671
I think that's what pissed of
the authorities the most.

18
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:19,072
They never tried to prove that
Phiber Optik hacked into any computers.

19
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,474
They got him for conspiracy...

20
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:22,444
for talking on a tapped phone line...

21
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,980
about howto hack certain sites.

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,018
There were people who broke into systems...

23
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:28,917
and fucked things up,
and they never even got arrested.

24
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,010
The feds didn't care.

25
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:34,492
They wanted to shut down the teachers,
the people who didn't knowto keep secrets.

26
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,584
There's Bernie S.

27
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:38,686
He's another guy who loves to explain...

28
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,129
howtechnology works
to anyone who's interested.

29
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:45,066
He didn't know it, but hell
was just around the corner waiting for him.

30
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:48,403
We made one last stop
before we dropped Phiber off.

31
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:49,941
It was a town called Frackville.

32
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:53,308
We thought it was funny because
of a hacker newsletter called Phrack.

33
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:56,209
We thought it'd make a good picture
for the hacker community.

34
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,614
But Bernie had the balls
to get a Frackville cop...

35
00:01:58,718 --> 00:01:59,980
to pose with Phiber.

36
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,917
These guys had no clue
what was going on...

37
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,284
but they quickly got into the spirit.

38
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:10,961
It was the last time we laughed that night.

39
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:13,960
We drove to the prison.

40
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,497
It felt like it was 20 degrees below zero.

41
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,569
We didn't know
they'd throw him in the hole...

42
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:21,764
for the entire weekend.
Some kind of prison welcoming ceremony.

43
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,139
And like the gullible idiots we were...

44
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,770
we figured we'd have a chance
to say goodbye.

45
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,877
We didn't.

46
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,608
They grabbed him.

47
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:36,381
And we had to run out of there
to keep them from taking our camera.

48
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,221
Phiber came home 10 months later, a hero.

49
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,729
Everyone knew
sending someone like that to prison...

50
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:48,460
was a big mistake.

51
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,294
After it was over, we were pretty sure
it wouldn't happen again.

52
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,438
Were we ever wrong.

53
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,030
Bad boys gone to jail

54
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,068
Bad boys gone to jail

55
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:32,133
Look at you, boy, you've come of age

56
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:36,008
and now you're going around
saying you're a bad boy

57
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:40,149
You say that you'll never go to jail

58
00:03:40,252 --> 00:03:44,383
'Cause you're so bad and you cannot fail

59
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,288
Oh bad boy
Oh rude boy

60
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,056
Oh bad boy
Gots to believe me

61
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:57,562
Oh bad boy
Here is how you fail

62
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,068
Gots to believe me one time

63
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:04,371
You went to town just to fool around

64
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:08,343
You met a girl who was wearing a frown

65
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,145
You going around, boasting, feeling bad

66
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,242
Now you're sitting in jail

67
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:16,514
don't you feel so sad

68
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:20,059
This is like the crudest form
of communication I've ever had to do.

69
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,750
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

70
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:32,466
I just saw something.

71
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:36,307
Was that you? Well, we can see your hand.

72
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,067
I doubt you can stick your whole head
through the window

73
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:41,408
Splotch your face up against the window

74
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,483
We'll know it's the right one,
we can at least zoom in on it.

75
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:45,317
We'll know it's the right one,
we can at least zoom in on it.

76
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:48,617
Kevin Mitnick, the world's most dangerous
computer hacker.

77
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,213
My regret about Cyberpunk
is talking about Kevin...

78
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,023
and how he was always eating
and how he was overweight.

79
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,254
People have really gotten on my case
about that.

80
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,132
Some guy came up to me
at anAustin book thing and said:

81
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,831
''Why did you go on and on
about Kevin's weight?''

82
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,372
And he was right.

83
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,769
I did that to the point
where it just wasn't tasteful.

84
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:15,514
Where it was sort of...

85
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,379
just beating an issue
that didn't need to be beaten.

86
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:21,451
For a period
after he was arrested, incarcerated...

87
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:23,180
and released into a halfway house...

88
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:24,879
I couldn't find a single article...

89
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,687
that talked about him
without mentioning his weight.

90
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,661
And the real fascination with Kevin's body...

91
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:34,699
and its relationship to technology..

92
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,165
is one of the things
that absolutely hooked me.

93
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:41,673
I found a number of articles in Time,
Newsweek, and the New York Times...

94
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,901
written by people like Markoff
and Joshua Quittner and so on.

95
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,639
And they would say
Kevin was in a halfway house...

96
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,444
where he no longer touched a computer,
and lost 100 pounds.

97
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,040
As if those two things were connected.

98
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,319
1988, USA Today...

99
00:05:57,689 --> 00:05:59,624
put his picture on the front page...

100
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:02,718
morphed or superimposed
with the image of Darth Vader.

101
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:07,458
And I thought this is
a remarkable combination of two things...

102
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,627
and it's really picking up on the idea
of the Dark Side hacker.

103
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,934
If ever there was someone
who fit that description, it was Kevin.

104
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,634
The mention of his name was enough
to incur the wrath of the authorities.

105
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,612
Over the years, his reputation grew
and so did the falsehoods.

106
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:25,177
In numerous articles, Kevin was said to have
broken into NORAD...

107
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:27,184
harassed actress Kristy McNichol...

108
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,516
and turned his friends'
home phones into payphones.

109
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,052
His beginning was on ham radio.

110
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:37,161
And on ham radio,
it's a close-knit community.

111
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:43,699
A couple of dozen people at the most
on a particular repeater or channel.

112
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:47,661
And, you know,
they would get into challenges.

113
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:50,634
And, of course,
Mitnick would be the underdog.

114
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:52,766
''Let's challenge him, let's do this and that.''

115
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,473
When he met their challenges,
they'd start crying and screaming...

116
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,141
as if they were innocentvictims of Kevin's.

117
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,220
This has been the case throughout.

118
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,687
And then people
would start unfairly using...

119
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,750
other contacts that they had.

120
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:11,353
In one case there was a lieutenant
or commander in the LAPD....

121
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,531
One ham radio operator
who was a friend of his...

122
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:19,536
got him to write a letter saying Kevin
was interfering with LAPD communications.

123
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,769
And all sorts of crazy things in his past.

124
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:22,942
Cyberpunk was published in 1991...

125
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,043
Cyberpunk was published in 1991...

126
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:27,706
by Katie Hafner
and then-husband John Markof...

127
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,180
and relied almost entirely
on the words of people...

128
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,216
who Kevin had had a falling out with...

129
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,980
as well as those who didn't know him at all.

130
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:39,420
Hafner and Markoff never talked to Kevin,
because he wanted to be paid for his time.

131
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:41,788
But it didn't take much to dispel the rumors.

132
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,951
NORAD denied any break-ins...

133
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:46,725
Kristy McNichol had no idea
she was being harassed...

134
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,995
and no evidence ever surfaced
of any payphone conversions.

135
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,899
But none of this ever got printed.

136
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:56,439
Kevin's name was enough to convict him,
regardless of the actual evidence.

137
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,435
And then there was Security Pacific.

138
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,377
After being hired,
Kevin had once again been terminated...

139
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,641
because of the stories that followed him.

140
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,480
And this resulted in
yet another Mitnick myth being born.

141
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:12,548
There was a Newswire article coming out
that stated...

142
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:16,759
that Security Pacific
had lost billions of dollars or something...

143
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,125
in bad loans...

144
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,495
which would have affected their stock price.

145
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,125
That was actually tracked down
to some error...

146
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:25,725
that someone made
in entering the information.

147
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,170
It had nothing to do with it not being true...

148
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,504
but it was an error that someone made
in entering the information.

149
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,975
Immediately, because there were
employees at Security Pacific...

150
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,745
that knew Kevin Mitnick,
including one ham radio operator...

151
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,253
immediately that was attributed to,
''Kevin Mitnick did this.''

152
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,788
And that's how that rumor spread.

153
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,648
I'd seen this all before.

154
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,591
Hackers were always getting blamed
for things they didn't do.

155
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,221
In many cases
for things that weren't even possible.

156
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:56,322
It was obvious
somebody had to set the record straight...

157
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,903
somebody who would command respect.

158
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:01,932
Hackers break into government
and business computers...

159
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,836
stealing and destroying information...

160
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:06,639
raiding bank accounts,
running up credit card charges...

161
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:10,182
extorting money by threats
to unleash computer viruses.

162
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:13,048
Whoa, hold on a second.

163
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,620
What was this guy reading?
The Weekly World News?

164
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,918
Hackers don't steal and extort,
they play with all kinds of things.

165
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:21,355
Like those Simplex locks
on the FedEx boxes.

166
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,291
In typical corporate brainpower...

167
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:26,888
FedEx uses the same combination
on every drop box in the country.

168
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,297
It's fun to stick something
really big in there...

169
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,565
that couldn't possibly fit in the chute
just to fuck with the guy

170
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,072
And he got some cheap beer out of it too.

171
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,734
If you go somewhere
you're not supposed to be...

172
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:40,437
and bring something back to show people...

173
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,980
that always struck me
as being a whole lot like a panty raid.

174
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:46,980
And you know, panty raids are really...

175
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,019
in the grandest tradition of this country

176
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:52,349
Try to make your way in there...

177
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:56,153
get the stuff, and get back out with it
without getting your head cut of.

178
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,129
What we're doing here is we're talking...

179
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:03,029
on McDonald's external speaker
for their drive-thru.

180
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,493
And what we're doing to do that...

181
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,937
is we have a modified ham radio...

182
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:12,773
meaning it transmits on frequencies
other than the ones it was intended to.

183
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,005
In this case,
it's standard business band frequencies.

184
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:24,081
154.6 megahertz seems to be
the standard McDonald's frequency

185
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,519
I'll take your order.

186
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,720
The blonde, would you please
kneel down for a second?

187
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:33,264
Could one of you take off your tops?
We'll give you the food for free.

188
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:35,832
You bastards, you better stop being smart.

189
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:37,926
-Here comes the manager.
-Really?

190
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:47,774
While corporateAmerica
would always be the playground of hackers...

191
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,441
it was mostly about fun and exploration,
not damage or profit.

192
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,778
But try telling that to corporateAmerica.

193
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,211
Kevin Mitnick had already paid
a heavy price for his curiosity.

194
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,312
He had served a year-and-a-half in 1988...

195
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:02,019
for logging into DEC computers
without authorization.

196
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,494
By simply looking
at the VMS operating system...

197
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:06,995
DEC claimed he caused
millions of dollars in damage...

198
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,330
and was sentenced as if he had caused
that amount of physical damage.

199
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:10,735
He was held without bail and was put
in solitary confinement for eight months...

200
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:14,340
He was held without bail and was put
in solitary confinement for eight months...

201
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,831
because they thought he could do
more damage from the prison payphone.

202
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:21,344
After his sentence, Kevin served
three years of supervised release...

203
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,142
reporting to authorities every month...

204
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,149
and being restricted in where he could go
and what he could do.

205
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,980
He only had days to go
when federal authorities decided...

206
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:31,613
he had violated the terms
of his supervised release...

207
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,485
by associating with Lewis DePayne...

208
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:36,686
and accessing someone's voice mail
without permission.

209
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,057
It was nothing.

210
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:39,528
But it was enough.

211
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,633
Knowing howthe media
and the court system...

212
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,599
would crucify him over any offense...

213
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:46,534
because he could start World War III
from a payphone...

214
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,538
Kevin decided to just walk away.

215
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,303
I was devastated.

216
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:54,105
We were never far away from each other.

217
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:58,249
And how was he living on his own...

218
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:02,716
without his family to share things with?

219
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:05,221
It was horrible.

220
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:06,880
What kind of a life is this?

221
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,754
He is not streetwise.

222
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,322
He's a home person.

223
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,827
Kevin managed to avoid attention.

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,436
Then, on July 4, 1994, everything changed.

225
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,961
A front page story in the NewYork Times...

226
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:24,474
turned Kevin Mitnick into a household word
all over again.

227
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:26,706
The evil-looking picture...

228
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,508
the mythical stories
about breaking into NORAD computers...

229
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,774
and controlling all the telephones
in California...

230
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,716
even the Security Pacific news release tale
was retold as fact.

231
00:12:36,754 --> 00:12:40,715
Nobody could figure out howthe story
made it onto the front page ofThe Times...

232
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,384
since there was nothing new in the story

233
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,721
But the author was no stranger.
John Markoff...

234
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:50,268
who was quickly becoming a Mitnick expert
without ever having met him.

235
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,099
We looked at the story
as an amusement back then.

236
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,902
We were planning the first Hackers On
Planet Earth conference thatAugust.

237
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,945
The story had gotten so big that
we all walked around with Mitnick masks.

238
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,346
They came here to the Hotel Pennsylvania
by the hundreds.

239
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,918
These usually anonymous creatures
of the cyberworld...

240
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,350
better known as hackers,
were holding a convention.

241
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,619
Throughout that weekend,
Kevin called in several times to say hi.

242
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,317
We all wished he could be there.

243
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,190
But we knew why he was running.

244
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,990
One of the things Markoff
hadn't mentioned in his article...

245
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,465
was the eight months
of solitary confinement.

246
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:25,730
The guy was in solitary confinement
for eight months.

247
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,096
Think about it.

248
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:32,836
I mean, that would definitely change a man.

249
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,706
You would run.You wouldn't want that.

250
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:39,114
It was eight months, not for anything he did,
but because the judge was scared.

251
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:41,778
And if you get someone
who is that unaware...

252
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:44,980
of actually what he can do
and thinks he can destroy the world.

253
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:47,451
If you have someone
who has enough power...

254
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:49,994
to put you in solitary confinement
you will run.

255
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,426
It makes perfect sense to me.

256
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:53,519
I think it's part hype...

257
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,268
part hysteria, part lack of understanding...

258
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,663
and part fear.

259
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,365
Solitary confinement means no books...

260
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,841
no pencil, no paper, no company.

261
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,874
Nothing to do...

262
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,947
but stare at these small four walls.

263
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,043
He would get out one hour a day..

264
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:16,211
and that's it.

265
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,312
You know, he might whistle up
some missile launch codes.

266
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:21,325
That's a big problem
with hackers nowadays.

267
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:25,158
They get a little pissed off
and they launch some nukes by whistling.

268
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:27,464
The fear factor is just insane.

269
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,625
Once or twice or maybe more,
I can't even remember...

270
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:33,899
they didn't even bring him down
to the visitors' room.

271
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,235
They took my daughter and I...

272
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:39,436
upstairs to a floor...

273
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:41,909
that wasn't occupied at that time.

274
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,846
We were the only ones there and the guard.

275
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,850
They were hovering over him...

276
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:50,216
as though he was an absolute monster

277
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,846
What could he possibly do, you know?

278
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,652
Could he make...

279
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:00,394
a computer out of the telephone?

280
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,659
I don't know what they were afraid of!

281
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,302
First of all, he had no desire to.

282
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:09,931
Secondly, it wouldn't have
accomplished anything.

283
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,100
Thirdly, he couldn't do it.

284
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,538
Kevin managed to elude the authorities
into the next year.

285
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,379
Then, on February 15, 1995...

286
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,052
they found him in Raleigh, North Carolina.

287
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:26,022
The FBI's most-wanted computer hacker
is behind bars.

288
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,591
Kevin Mitnick was jailed without bond
in Raleigh, North Carolina...

289
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,822
where he was arrested this week.

290
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,365
He's accused of breaking into
corporate computers nationwide.

291
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:39,426
Private computer experts say
so many other hackers are at work...

292
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,768
that privacy is virtually impossible.

293
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,202
The FBI had managed to track Kevin...

294
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:47,745
with the help of a mysterious
computer expert, Tsutomu Shimomura...

295
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,110
who, along with some friends
had managed to track...

296
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,378
Kevin's cellular phone signal
to the apartment he was staying in.

297
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:57,279
One of Shimomura's friends who was there
while the signal was being traced...

298
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,322
was none other than John Markoff...

299
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:02,120
who wrote an even bigger
front page story this time.

300
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:05,456
Sure enough, I opened the door,
the next day...

301
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,325
to the hotel room,
and there was The Times outside the door.

302
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:12,604
And I picked it up and I just thought,
''Oh, my God.''

303
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:17,340
This article had a new list of things
that Kevin had supposedly done...

304
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:20,469
including breaking into
Shimomura's ultra-secure computer...

305
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:22,604
leaving nasty voice mail messages...

306
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,615
and stealing 20,000 credit card numbers...

307
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:29,777
something that was mentioned
in the first paragraph on the front page.

308
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,879
But 13 paragraphs later, on Page D17...

309
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,524
it was revealed that he had never used
any of them.

310
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,822
They were credit card numbers
that had been left lying around...

311
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,899
by Internet Service Provider Netcom
for almost a year.

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,332
Netcom credit card file,
everybody had that file.

313
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,769
If you didn't have that file, you were a loser.

314
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,399
Hundreds of people had that,
they swapped it around like bubble gum.

315
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:55,139
And then they claim that he's the one
who did it, he's the one that had it...

316
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:58,976
when that was floating around for months
before he theoretically had it.

317
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:01,880
Everybody and his sister's
got a million credit card numbers.

318
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:05,479
What's the big deal?
It's a meaningless thing to have.

319
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,558
What I want to know...

320
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,487
is did he threaten anybody in any way?

321
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:14,430
Did he claim he was going to do
some particular set of harm?

322
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:18,025
Are there any notebooks
that showed he had plans...

323
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:22,695
to conspire to commit any particular thing...

324
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:25,067
other than humiliating
Tsutomu Shimomura...

325
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:28,374
which any idiot who's ever met Shimomura
could have told him...

326
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,913
this was not the guy to mess with.

327
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:32,517
I met Shimomura once.

328
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:35,483
The first time I met Shimomura
was in front of Congress.

329
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:38,317
And I was testifying
to a congressional subcommittee...

330
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:40,255
and there's this guy...

331
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:44,227
in sandals and, like, ragged-ass cutofs.

332
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,261
And the rest of us are done up in ties...

333
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,833
it's me and theAttorney General
from New Jersey.

334
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:52,893
And we're sitting there, giving our best
''Yes, we're in front of Congress'' thing.

335
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:57,269
And Shimomura is there in this surfer gear.

336
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,277
And he pulls thisAT&T cell phone...

337
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:03,770
pulls it out of the shrink-wrap,
finger-hacks it...

338
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,009
and starts monitoring phone calls...

339
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:08,018
going up and down Capitol Hill...

340
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:12,056
while an FBI agent
is standing at his shoulder listening to him.

341
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:16,227
I'm like, ''This fucker's got balls
the size of durian fruit.''

342
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:20,057
You know, this is unbelievable.
This is the heaviest guy I've ever seen.

343
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:23,028
I mean, he's hacking, right?

344
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:26,104
He was finger-hacking this phone
in front of Congress...

345
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:30,642
with two FBI agents
and John Gage from Sun Microsystems...

346
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,971
in the room with him.And I was like,
''Wow,'' you know.

347
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:35,478
I mean, I was impressed.

348
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:38,548
Inside of a week, Shimomura and Markoff
had signed a book deal...

349
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,413
estimated to be worth $750,000.

350
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,817
It would be another 19 months
before Kevin would even be indicted.

351
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,381
The book, entitled Takedown,
was finished by the end of the year.

352
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,855
When I read it, I was aghast.

353
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:56,557
It was Tsutomu's
eating and skateboarding habits.

354
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,835
I'd been to a lot of the restaurants
he'd been to...

355
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,736
but I didn't need a hacker book
to tell me about them.

356
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,397
Takedown. Well....

357
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,376
I don't what I want to say about Takedown.

358
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,913
Takedown was not well received.

359
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:19,881
1996 came and went as did 1997.

360
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:22,583
Kevin remained in prison
without even a bail hearing...

361
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:25,355
and no prospect of a trial anytime soon.

362
00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:28,826
A25-count indictment
accused him of nothing more serious...

363
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:31,095
than lying on the telephone
about who he was...

364
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:34,468
and copying software which he
never tried to sell or even distribute.

365
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,803
Nothing about hacking
into Shimomura's machine...

366
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,036
or having 20,000 credit card numbers...

367
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,442
nothing that would have appeared
in a John Markoff story.

368
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,111
North Carolina had also charged him
with making free cellular phone calls.

369
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,980
Kevin was given a two-year sentence...

370
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:51,248
more than he would have gotten
for manslaughter.

371
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:54,018
But the federal charges still remained.

372
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:56,688
They even put him
in solitary confinement again...

373
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,891
because the authorities were convinced
he'd build a transmitter out of a Walkman...

374
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,400
sneak into the warden's office
and monitor his conversations.

375
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,560
The mainstream media made light of it...

376
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:10,005
claiming Mitnick was put in solitary
for having too many cans of tuna.

377
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:12,736
What everyone seemed to forget
was years were going by...

378
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,778
and this guy had yet to be tried.

379
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,440
And then, things got a whole lot worse.

380
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:17,615
June 1998.

381
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,317
June 1998.

382
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:21,876
A movie version of Takedown
was announced.

383
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,421
Skeet Ulrich, who played a killer in Scream...

384
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:25,785
was set to play Kevin Mitnick.

385
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,825
And Russell Wong
from The Joy Luck Club...

386
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:29,721
would be Tsutomu Shimomura.

387
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:31,384
It didn't seem to matter to anyone...

388
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,759
that the real-life Kevin
was still rotting in prison without a trial.

389
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,096
According to the script
we got our hands on...

390
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:39,692
he had been found guilty
and sentenced already.

391
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,295
The magic of Hollywood.

392
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:44,204
They even brought
Kevin and Tsutomu closer.

393
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:47,210
In real life, they'd only met
for a few seconds in a courtroom.

394
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,746
In the Hollywood version
they met in a dark alleyway...

395
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:52,337
where Kevin would proceed
to bash Tsutomu on the head...

396
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,816
with a garbage can lid.

397
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:56,644
We had to tell the world
that this was a big mistake.

398
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,482
The truth needed to be told.

399
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:01,150
And we could either do it ourselves,
or use the media.

400
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,854
That's right, the media,
democracy's biggest allies...

401
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:06,487
committed to informing the public
no matter the cost.

402
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:08,190
The true conscience of America.

403
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,932
-Stop pushing!
-Get out of the way, Brad.

404
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,096
Watch yourselves!

405
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:18,375
Come on, guys.

406
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:21,711
Don't yell at me, everyone's in front of me.

407
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,472
Tell them to come back.

408
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,777
He's coming to the mike!

409
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:30,288
Would you guys get down?

410
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:37,355
Watch the mikes!

411
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,192
Let's get out of the way.

412
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:46,170
Come on.

413
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:56,112
We decided to do it ourselves.

414
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,339
We found Skeet Ulrich's apartment
in New York in a phone book...

415
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,781
and paid a visit
to try and get him the real story

416
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:02,854
But he had moved.

417
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:07,152
I know, because the doorman let me
look at every single name in the book.

418
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:10,526
So the next stop was Miramax Films
on the West Side.

419
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:14,429
We figured they'd appreciate a chance
to correct the mistakes in the screenplay.

420
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:17,400
And we knew we'd be warmly received
because this was Miramax.

421
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,130
The company had distributed
Michael Moore's latest film...

422
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,761
you know, the guy
who films in everybody's lobby.

423
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:29,906
Hi, we're looking for Miramax?

424
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,076
-What's your name?
-Emmanuel Goldstein.

425
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:35,173
Who you here to see?

426
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,185
Sorry, you can't film in here.

427
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:40,221
-You can't film here?
-No, it's a landmark.

428
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,758
Sorry, you can't....

429
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:45,021
So there's no way you can call upstairs....

430
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,798
You have to call them, they will call me.

431
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,731
This wasn't going well.

432
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,438
How could a movie company
tell us to stop filming?

433
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:56,403
All we wanted to do was talk to somebody.

434
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:01,269
What a letdown.

435
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,641
His light is on, so he's capturing everything.

436
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,615
So please go outside
before he has to call the police.

437
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,585
All right, we don't want that,
so we'll go outside....

438
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:13,184
We called the office and waited
to hear from them, but we never did.

439
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:16,952
It was like they were scared of us.
Maybe they agreed with Bill Clinton...

440
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,997
that hackers were as one-dimensional
as they were in the script.

441
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:21,998
How could we get them
to see the other side?

442
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:26,836
That night, NewYork City
introduced unlimited ride MetroCards.

443
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:30,066
We decided to find out
how long it would take for our cards to reset...

444
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:32,539
so we could let people in for free.

445
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:43,174
This is what the hacker world
was really all about.

446
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,721
Why didn't they see this?

447
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:48,416
Why did it always have to be something evil
to the people who didn't get it?

448
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:54,363
We had only one option.

449
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:56,592
''For Off The Hook,
I recently heard the show...

450
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,192
''where you got the copy of a script
for Takedown.

451
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,603
''I found it really amusing
howthe scriptwriters can take the truth...

452
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:06,643
''and not twist it or fabricate it,
but just plain lie about what happened.''

453
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,573
I've heard about Kevin's story,
and thanks to Off The Hook...

454
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,173
I heard about this meeting,
and I decided to come...

455
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,615
and see how I can help.

456
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,618
It wasn't from me, it's from somebody else,
I knew who that is.

457
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:21,852
-ls there a good catchiness?
-Yeah. ''From Supermax to Miramax:

458
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,457
''Three-and-a-halfYears With No Trial.''

459
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:29,063
And then you can make another one,
''From Miramax to Supermax:

460
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,362
''And No Trial.''

461
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,439
When they see two ''Free Kevin'' stickers...

462
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:39,134
when they see 10, 20, 100,
they're gonna say, ''Who the hell is Kevin?''

463
00:24:39,242 --> 00:24:41,608
They'll keep saying it
until somebody answers them.

464
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:45,547
One or two people that know more about it
are one or two people more on our side.

465
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,881
Those two people get two people
who get two people.That's how it is.

466
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,285
We're gonna be in their face
every step of the way.

467
00:24:51,387 --> 00:24:54,721
If it comes to showing this thing
on the screen, in theaters...

468
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,519
we're going to be there, too.

469
00:24:56,626 --> 00:25:00,086
I mean, what we're doing now
isn't going to be finished...

470
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,133
until Kevin has his trial, until Kevin is out.

471
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,634
''Guilty by Hollywood''
or something like that.

472
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,035
-That's a good one.
-I like that.

473
00:25:09,105 --> 00:25:11,701
Yeah, I did look at the script, and....

474
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,101
I don't know.

475
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:17,509
It's a shame and it definitely
shouldn't be something out there...

476
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:20,105
for someone
who knows very little about Kevin...

477
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:24,211
to then see this movie
and have ideas in their head that are untrue.

478
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,118
We had tried talking to them
and they wouldn't listen.

479
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:31,025
Now, by having a demonstration outside
their offices, they would have to listen.

480
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:33,857
But we were hackers.
What did we know about demonstrations?

481
00:25:33,963 --> 00:25:35,557
Just that they can turn into riots...

482
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:38,727
especially when the Mayor
bans demonstrations outside City Hall...

483
00:25:38,836 --> 00:25:41,169
and the cops shoot people a lot more.

484
00:25:41,337 --> 00:25:44,307
We needed guidance,
someone with experience.

485
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,567
We looked all over town for an activist.

486
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,738
Maybe one of those gray-haired hippies
from the '60s.

487
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:52,009
We found one. Sort of.

488
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,257
What's it like demonstrating here?
Do you get harassed?

489
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:08,490
They hate our guts because
they don't want the truth to come out.

490
00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:11,260
Why do you think there isn't more activism?

491
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:14,269
Because people don't care, they're scared...

492
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:18,634
they're afraid they'll get into trouble.
I can understand it.

493
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:21,608
But we still have to take a stand,
afraid or not.

494
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:24,703
We have to at least give it a try,
we have to give it a shot.

495
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:28,775
-Has this cop been giving you any trouble?
-No, he hasn't bothered me.

496
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:32,323
And we have a President
that wants to suck their brains out.

497
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,892
That bothers a lot of people, but....

498
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:39,894
Anybody that's decent gets bothered
when a little child is tortured to death.

499
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:42,498
Or when a President
is sucking their brains out.

500
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,863
Yeah.

501
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,058
He wasn't exactly what we had in mind.

502
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,402
I got a real earful about
the evils of homosexuals and communists.

503
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,806
But in the end,
he told us the one thing we needed to hear

504
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:56,174
When you demonstrate,
make sure you're in the right.

505
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,038
And that's the one thing we were sure of:
We were right.

506
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,314
The day arrived.
We had no idea what to expect.

507
00:27:12,462 --> 00:27:15,022
We just stood there for a while,
not knowing what to do.

508
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,656
Our converted phone company van
got more attention than us.

509
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,930
My name is Noah Kenickstein,
I'm an attorney.

510
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,903
-For Miramax?
-No. For you all!

511
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,566
I didn't even know.

512
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:28,337
-I'm a lawyer. I'm representing you all.
-Okay. Great.

513
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,579
So, no one's getting arrested, right?

514
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:34,076
-I didn't plan on it.
-Good.

515
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,112
The National Lawyers Guild
sent someone to protect us...

516
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:38,915
and that was the turning point.

517
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:42,423
Things began to come together.
Even members of the media showed up.

518
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:46,054
It seemed like everyone except Miramax
was taking this seriously.

519
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:50,758
We learned that when you stand outside
a film studio's offices with picket signs...

520
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:52,028
people notice.

521
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,611
These folks are gonna
put on a little demonstration here.

522
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:07,583
They're gonna be marching around.
I thought I would tell you.

523
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:09,846
-You could tell the....
-I'll tell the precinct.

524
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:13,820
Tell the precinct, and tell them I'm a lawyer
It's nice and calm.

525
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,922
No problems at all.

526
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,019
But they're having a little....
They'll be marching around.

527
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,028
-I've got it.
-I wanted to tell you that.

528
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:24,588
I appreciate thatvery much.
Could you tell me approximately how many?

529
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:28,432
I would say there's gonna be....
50 people, Patty?

530
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,173
50 to 60, maximum 50.

531
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:39,308
-What area are you doing it in?
-ln front of Miramax Films.

532
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:42,284
They're demonstrating about a movie
that they're making.

533
00:28:42,385 --> 00:28:44,651
Thanks a lot, I appreciate you stopping me.

534
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,189
Everybody's nice and calm.

535
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:49,852
-I'll tell them that. Thanks for the advice.
-Okay, no problem.

536
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:52,959
No, they're not gonna come on purpose.

537
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,723
People are, you know....

538
00:28:54,932 --> 00:28:57,627
You're talking about suits.

539
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,671
They don't give a fuck.
You got to go hand it to them.

540
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,000
Don't harass the people who walk by

541
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:05,633
Some people have crises
going on in their lives.

542
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:08,233
They can't be bothered with our problems.

543
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:12,948
Do you have a permit?
Who's in charge out here?

544
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,451
Do you all have a permit?

545
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,213
As long as you don't block
the front of the entrance.

546
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,814
You stay to the side, please. Thank you.

547
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:26,656
They can walk in front.
The cops have been--

548
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,665
As long as you don't block the entrance,
I don't have no problem.

549
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,237
They have a FirstAmendment right.

550
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:35,567
Don't block the entrance.
That's all I'm saying.

551
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,836
It's ringing. I got put in voice mail,
guess they got too many calls.

552
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:42,001
This one's reaching voice mail.
I'll leave a message.

553
00:29:42,211 --> 00:29:45,478
Hi, this is the protest outside.
Are you guys there?

554
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:48,083
If you get this, come outside.
We're right down here.

555
00:29:48,184 --> 00:29:49,653
I see someone.

556
00:29:50,153 --> 00:29:53,488
All right. Maybe you'll pick up the phone
or come downstairs later.

557
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:55,182
You calling the Publicity Department?

558
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:58,260
No, the main number.
I got a hold of them yesterday...

559
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,161
and I asked for directions to the protest...

560
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:05,223
and they told me they couldn't get me
from where I was at to here.

561
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,362
I said, ''Okay, I'll call you back tomorrow
when I'm out front.''

562
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:11,442
-I see them, they've got their heads out.
-There's one.

563
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,106
They're not answering the phones.

564
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,509
Waving banners that said ''Free Kevin''...

565
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,511
and holding ''Stop Miramax'' posters...

566
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,877
the small butvocal crowd of protesters...

567
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:23,351
stood outside Miramax Pictures'
New York offices yesterday.

568
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:26,012
At issue: this script, entitled Takedown...

569
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:30,083
the story of the nation's most notorious
computer hacker, Kevin Mitnick.

570
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:32,923
Mitnick is currently being held in prison
without bail...

571
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:35,088
awaiting trial on computer crimes.

572
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,226
It's a script these Kevin Mitnick supporters
say is libelous...

573
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,066
and would hurt Mitnick's chances
of getting a fair trial.

574
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,298
It might influence the jury

575
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:46,740
It might change a lot of things
in a negative way.

576
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,872
He's trying so hard to at least
get a trial and then this comes up...

577
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,914
where he's constantly being defamed.

578
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:58,682
You never know who you might see
when you're standing outside a film studio.

579
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:01,923
Kevin Bacon had no interest whatsoever.

580
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,595
But radio personality Lazlow did.

581
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,361
With the proliferation of the news...

582
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,798
TV news journalism like Primetime Live...

583
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:16,567
and these shows
that completely distort the facts...

584
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:22,944
and shows like 60 Minutes
being forced to go in the same direction...

585
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,314
people don't know the facts about the case.

586
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:29,682
They don't know the facts about hackers.

587
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,217
I'd say that hackers...

588
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,884
are the communists of the 1990s...

589
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:39,587
where, basically, if anybody says ''hacker''...

590
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:43,258
all of a sudden you've got this demon 666 across
your head.

591
00:31:43,366 --> 00:31:45,961
Nobody actually understands any of it.

592
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,534
What I do in my part, on the radio...

593
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:55,207
with my syndicated show,
is try to get people to open their brains...

594
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:59,682
because I talk to a lot of old people,
because I'm on a lot of news talk stations.

595
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:04,242
When I can, I put Emmanuel or Bernie S.,
or anybody else on there...

596
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:08,414
to talk about the state of what's going on,
because nobody else will cover it.

597
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,685
The people who cover it
in the mainstream media...

598
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,318
do so for profit,
like the guy that wrote the book.

599
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:17,866
The demonstrators say they have sent
a copy of this illicitly obtained script...

600
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:21,132
to Kevin Mitnick in jail,
and that he absolutely hates it.

601
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:24,037
Miramax's parent, Disney,
may not like it either.

602
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,769
The controversy comes on the heels...

603
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:28,605
of the dumping of $43 million
in Disney stock...

604
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:30,576
by the Texas Board of Education.

605
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:34,309
The board's complaint: Miramax films
have too much sex and violence.

606
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,012
Miramax distorts the facts!

607
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,294
Was that Harvey Weinstein,
President of Miramax?

608
00:32:45,394 --> 00:32:46,488
He walked right by us.

609
00:32:46,596 --> 00:32:49,430
He didn't even get
a ''Stop Miramax'' brochure?

610
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:52,166
Of course we had a brochure for Harvey.

611
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:54,596
Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

612
00:32:56,272 --> 00:32:58,365
-What did they say?
-I don't know.

613
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,508
There she is.
That's the one who answered the phone.

614
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,202
She hung up on me yesterday

615
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,679
I got through.

616
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,114
They waved. Did you see them wave?

617
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,980
Miramax distorts the facts!

618
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:11,555
They said if you use a bullhorn...

619
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:15,114
or obstruct people's walkways,
you have to have a permit.

620
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,284
Miramax distorts the facts!

621
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:20,618
If you continue to use that,
I'm gonna have to call the cops.

622
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:27,797
I think that three years is a long time
to be held without actually having a trial.

623
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,030
And I think that what Miramax is doing...

624
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:34,601
is going to jeopardize his right
to have a free and honest trial.

625
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:37,577
So that's why I'm out here protesting.

626
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,942
Thank you.

627
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,682
They all were aware of the thing
in front of the building in NewYork City.

628
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,050
They talked about it on the set,
asked me about it.

629
00:33:47,156 --> 00:33:48,750
They said ''Did you talk to Emmanuel?
That's great.''

630
00:33:48,858 --> 00:33:50,759
They were waving. They think it's fantastic.

631
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,557
And they all want Free Kevin stickers.
The whole crew.

632
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:56,722
If you give me some, I will send it to them.
They will put them on their cars.

633
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,035
Hello, sir.
Do you know who Kevin Mitnick is?

634
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,435
Hello, sir.
Do you know who Kevin Mitnick is?

635
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:00,596
No, I do not.

636
00:34:00,703 --> 00:34:05,074
Computer hacker who's been in jail
for three-and-a-half years without a trial.

637
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,869
Miramax has decided
to make a movie about him.

638
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:12,313
The script is false.
It makes him out to be a violent racist...

639
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:14,280
which he is not.

640
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,284
I want to know what you think about it.

641
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,751
When are they doing the film?

642
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,722
-They start shooting in a few weeks.
-Kevin Mitnick is great.

643
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:24,317
-How do I find out the truth?
-They should take him out of prison.

644
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,896
-Hold on, I want to talk to you.
-What's that?

645
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:31,434
My main thing is the only reason
he ended up running afoul of the law...

646
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,699
is because people don't have
access to communications.

647
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:39,436
All you got is big corporations like Miramax
with access to communications.

648
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:41,375
FirstAmendment! Yeah!

649
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,405
This is inAmerica.

650
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:46,505
-He was in jail three years without a trial?
-He's still in jail.

651
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:49,414
I saw something about this
on CNBC on Friday.

652
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:51,181
This happens a lot, though.

653
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:55,349
You always have unauthorized biographies
and stuff like that.

654
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,690
Where it's like, you have an autobiography...

655
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:00,059
you have an authorized biography.

656
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:04,099
-This is sort of like an unauthorized--
-This is going to be big.

657
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,068
-He hasn't had a trial yet?
-Hasn't had a trial yet.

658
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,668
Not only that, in the movie,
they already wrote that he had a trial.

659
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:15,469
-You ever hear of Kevin Mitnick?
-No. Who's that?

660
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:18,708
Well, if you're walking away, I really can't....

661
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,581
How did you guys get a hold of the script?

662
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,579
Okay. All right.

663
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:32,454
You're a lawyer.
Isn't it illegal if they're gonna slander him?

664
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,030
Can't they try and stop them
on legal grounds?

665
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,623
That's not right.They have to put a waiver--

666
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:41,465
I think they should hold the film
until after he's had a fair trial.

667
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,273
I mean, it happens.
It happened, unfortunately

668
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,137
You know, I don't think it should be....

669
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:50,043
Obviously, it's probably not legal
to have a lawsuit against Miramax.

670
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,583
I think they should have to wait
until he's had a fair trial.

671
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,652
And also they shouldn't use his real name.

672
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,585
If they want to change the facts,
they should change the name.

673
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:01,885
-Make it a fictional story.
-Three-and-a-half years is a long time.

674
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:05,224
Think about what you've done
for the last three-and-a-half years.

675
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,766
And imagine being in jail
while all that stuff was happening.

676
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,766
For just that. Just for copying software.

677
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,163
I've copied software.

678
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,931
-What did he do? He hacked.
-He hacked.

679
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,175
I would like to know your opinion...

680
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,681
on the slandering in this film.

681
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:31,181
Miramax sucks. So, like, Free Kevin!

682
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:38,523
I can't talk shit about a movie
I haven't seen or read the script of.

683
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,630
But the one relevant thing that I could say..

684
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:45,963
is it seems to me there is
a witch-hunt sort of hysterical mentality..

685
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,061
vis-a-vis hacking, you know.

686
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:52,074
People are very quick to fly off the handle
and condemn as terrorists...

687
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:56,445
people who are, you know,
exploring a newtechnology landscape...

688
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,708
in a way that they don't understand.

689
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:02,009
-Definitely.
-That's as far as I can go not having seen it.

690
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,882
Not only did we find a receptive bunch
at local theaters...

691
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,980
they even started to do our work for us.

692
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,559
New York was great.
But it was only the start.

693
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,360
New York was great.
But it was only the start.

694
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,422
We had to travel to get to the right people.
So we put together a camera crew...

695
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:18,092
and made sure none of us had anything
planned for the next several weeks.

696
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,103
We charted out a course,
and headed to the airport.

697
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:24,663
That's where we got our economy-sized
rental car with unlimited mileage.

698
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:27,175
The plan was to go
to Wilmington, North Carolina...

699
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:29,576
where filming for Takedown
was about to begin.

700
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,648
On the way, we figured we'd make a detour
and stop at Defcon...

701
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,945
the annual hacker convention in Las Vegas.

702
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,748
If we were going to do that,
we should stop in San Diego...

703
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,413
to say hi to Tsutomu Shimomura...

704
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,617
and maybe convince him
to stop using Kevin Mitnick as a cash cow.

705
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:45,695
And if we did that,
it would be rude not to visit John Markof...

706
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:49,253
to ask him to inject some accuracy
into his stories about Kevin.

707
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,494
Since we were suddenly adding
10,000 miles to this rental car...

708
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,764
we might as well visit
some of the corporations...

709
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:58,431
who were claiming Kevin Mitnick
cost them millions of dollars in damages...

710
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,304
just to see what the hell they were talking about.

711
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,414
There's something about Pennsylvania.
I call it the Prison State.

712
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:09,543
That's because they seem to have prisons
everywhere you look.

713
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:15,320
And almost everyone I know who's gone
to prison seems to wind up in Pennsylvania.

714
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:16,449
Weird.

715
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:19,489
Besides, every time I get pulled over
by a cop...

716
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:23,465
I seem to find myself in the Prison State.
I knew I'd better be careful.

717
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,559
Let's not get off on the wrong foot,
Pennsylvania's great.

718
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,333
Home of such landmarks as the Liberty Bell,
Independence Hall...

719
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:34,873
that little surveillance camera
above Independence Hall...

720
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:42,277
and the house where Thomas Jefferson
signed the Declaration of Independence...

721
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:45,913
just down the block from theAfro-American
Museum and its new neighbor.

722
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:52,356
A maximum-security federal prison
right in the middle of Philadelphia.

723
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,621
Howtimes change.

724
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,170
They say it's illegal to take pictures
of any prison...

725
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,797
even those under construction,
even those right in the middle of a city

726
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:06,342
We couldn't find a law anywhere
that backed this up...

727
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:08,139
but try taking a picture of a prison...

728
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:11,237
without getting threatened
by some prison guard or cop.

729
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,010
Here, look at this part.

730
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:17,447
Maybe there are subtle details
that will lead to a prison uprising some day

731
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:30,492
I think fully half of the people
in federal prison, if not more...

732
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:32,367
shouldn't be there.

733
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,695
It's not violent criminals.

734
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:39,367
Drug crimes. Somebody gets
a mandatory 10 years...

735
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:42,206
for selling $800 worth of LSD.

736
00:39:42,612 --> 00:39:46,014
That's not right either.
That's the way the federal system works.

737
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,277
It's just not right.

738
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,788
I know the state of California
has more prisoners than SouthAfrica.

739
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:56,351
Incarceration is a big business.
I think that's part of the reason.

740
00:39:58,161 --> 00:40:01,527
There is less and less tolerance
on the part of the public...

741
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,565
for people who have transgressed the rules.

742
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:08,536
We have a huge prison population.
This gets into other questions.

743
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:12,170
Putting a computer hacker in
with sex offenders and murderers...

744
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:15,005
is probably the worst thing
you can possibly do...

745
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,840
to somebody who has...

746
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:21,478
not murdered, is not a violent criminal!

747
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,713
Somebody who's a technological....
Who's gone over the edge.

748
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,688
Then, again,
we have to define what we mean.

749
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:31,556
We need a new classification system
for technological law.

750
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:34,755
In one of my books
I talked about setting up a court system...

751
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:39,268
especially for technology
where the people that were prosecuting...

752
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:41,998
and the judges
and the people involved in the cases...

753
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,335
would have some technological basis...

754
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,170
to evaluate and try the case
in a reasonable manner...

755
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:51,373
and to come up with
an alternative sentencing system...

756
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:53,643
that reflected more the nature of the crime.

757
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:57,610
If you're exposed to people like that
for too long, you change with them.

758
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,518
You become one of them.

759
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,092
Next thing you know you'll be locked away
again for doing what they do.

760
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,661
One night...

761
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,902
...I was in my cell in a minimum-security
facility, Bucks County Prison.

762
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:16,063
Two guards stormed in...

763
00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:19,199
and flipped my bed upside down...

764
00:41:19,742 --> 00:41:23,907
and locked me in handcufs and started
rummaging through my storage locker..

765
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:26,514
demanding to know
where my computer was.

766
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,911
I'm like, ''I don't have a computer here.
What are you talking about?''

767
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,284
They were squeezing the toothpaste
out of my tube...

768
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:36,916
ostensibly looking for a computer
or whatever they were looking for.

769
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,221
It was bizarre!

770
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,628
But Pennsylvania was more than prisons,
it was a place of learning.

771
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:47,135
And theAge Expo was where
thousands of senior citizens learned...

772
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:49,762
that corporateAmerica
really cared about them.

773
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:59,481
The guy representing Bell Atlantic
was the most sincere of all.

774
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,516
How could you not trust a fox?

775
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,213
Freddie the Phone-Fraud Fox was passing
corporate numbers to the seniors:

776
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,882
Over $4 billion in phone fraud every year.

777
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:11,989
Freddie said most of that was
because of evil computer hackers.

778
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,563
And I met him.

779
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,994
Freddie knew words like ''digit''
would only confuse older people.

780
00:42:20,103 --> 00:42:22,664
It made more sense to say things like
''ten-number number.''

781
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,239
It means they will have to dial
the area code...

782
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:28,606
along with their seven-digit number
each time they place a call...

783
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:33,045
within and between 215, 610...

784
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:36,146
and the new 267 for 215...

785
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:39,786
and the 484 for 610 area code.

786
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:44,726
You give them out in blocks of 10,000 and people
that get these blocks of 10,000...

787
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:48,355
end up using 300 numbers
and all the others are tied up wasted.

788
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:53,766
Easy listening
Never mind the world outside

789
00:42:54,103 --> 00:42:59,201
Easy listening
Famine, war, and genocide

790
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:04,411
Easy listening
Forget the loony on the loose

791
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:09,847
Easy listening
Rising crime and child abuse

792
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,614
Ignore the poisoned atmosphere

793
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:15,221
Open up another beer

794
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,728
The media feeds you every day
what to think and say

795
00:43:20,797 --> 00:43:21,958
We went back...

796
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:26,295
...to a familiar place.

797
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,771
Everything was just as we left it...

798
00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:34,076
only it was about 90 degrees warmer.

799
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,039
But you could still feel the chill
after four-and-a-half years.

800
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,483
It was surprising
how nobody tried to stop us from filming.

801
00:43:43,585 --> 00:43:46,317
So we filmed everything.
The medium-security facility...

802
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:47,947
the minimum-security prison camp...

803
00:43:48,056 --> 00:43:51,516
the sign that lets minimum-security
prisoners know when they've escaped...

804
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:53,597
and Unicor, the slave-labor office...

805
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:57,030
where prisoners make furniture
for the government for pennies a day.

806
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,635
We almost made it out.

807
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,646
It was the first time we had ever gotten
pulled over by prison cops.

808
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,447
How could we not drop in
on our friends at CERT...

809
00:44:18,554 --> 00:44:20,385
the Computer Emergency Response Team?

810
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:23,460
They tell the world
when there's a threat to computer networks.

811
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:25,322
They'd back us up and tell the world...

812
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,795
that Kevin Mitnick
posed no threat at all to NORAD...

813
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,195
Kristy McNichol, or theAmerican way of life.

814
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,369
We thought computer people
worked odd hours...

815
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,630
but these guys
apparently took Saturdays off.

816
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:38,538
We asked the security guard to come down
and let us leave a pamphlet or two.

817
00:44:41,077 --> 00:44:44,239
Something must get triggered
whenever you say Mitnick's name.

818
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:47,340
We were meeting far too many cops
in so brief a period of time.

819
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,782
But at least Pennsylvania
was living up to its name.

820
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,626
We explained why we were there
but got the message we expected.

821
00:44:58,094 --> 00:44:59,289
You're not welcome.

822
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:01,625
We're used to that.

823
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:05,463
In the event that you should
maybe happen to come again...

824
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:07,793
if you are not welcome...

825
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,532
and I find out that you are not welcome...

826
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:15,036
you will be exactly where Kevin is...

827
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:18,378
and then you'd be defeating your purpose.

828
00:45:19,315 --> 00:45:22,114
I'm here to do the job
and my job right now is...

829
00:45:23,152 --> 00:45:25,347
-to get you out of here.
-I understand that.

830
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:28,947
I know a lot of people who are in prison
who probably shouldn't be there.

831
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,050
But that's our judicial system.

832
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:32,956
You know what I mean?

833
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,463
Sometimes it works and sometimes it don't.

834
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,338
Believe me, I've seen it not work
in the favor of my people many times.

835
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:45,434
I'm gonna parlay the rest of this...

836
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:50,646
my tedious job is to run you for wants
and warrants and all that kind of stuff...

837
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,079
if you would expedite your leaving.

838
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:57,085
We'll get out of here,
we'll head for the border right away

839
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:58,188
19 radio.

840
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,516
The gentleman has been given
a standard warning.

841
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,224
I'll give you his name and stuff.

842
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:13,297
Before we left,
we decided to check the mood of the street.

843
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,202
He told me not to mess with her.

844
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:20,471
She did everybody she could in the weeds...

845
00:46:20,943 --> 00:46:22,911
and then she moved to the projects.

846
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,871
It's not Kevin's fault.

847
00:46:24,981 --> 00:46:27,576
Free Kevin. Kevin has nothing to do with it.

848
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:31,780
The broad quit me
'cause I was an alcoholic...

849
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,550
and I wasn't making no money.

850
00:46:35,224 --> 00:46:37,385
I was broke, that's why she quit me.

851
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:41,088
The reason I don't have a girlfriend
is I don't have no money.

852
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,226
Oh, wow.

853
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,702
He seems like a nice guy.
Why would you want to do anything to him?

854
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:52,902
You think his girlfriend's gonna quit him
or something?

855
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,068
It was time to go.

856
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:01,974
We was peeling potatoes

857
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,143
Back in World War Two

858
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:09,623
And we was playing that rock and roll
After school for you know who

859
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,260
Hidden from the public

860
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,695
It was behind the scenes

861
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,260
There was a relic
They called the purple hair

862
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,527
With Kevin Mitnick locked away...

863
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:48,530
the phone companies of the world
felt safe from intruders.

864
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:51,692
But the fact remained,
many people were exploring all the time...

865
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:52,996
online and off.

866
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,967
Allied Signal Aerospace...

867
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:57,398
Sprint PCS up there...

868
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:00,202
Informix,
Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems....

869
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:01,436
You're scaring me.

870
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,012
It's like this flat area where there's no trees
or anything, just industry

871
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,889
Oklahoma, the state that created Hanson.

872
00:48:13,922 --> 00:48:17,518
People kept telling us our sound guy
looked like one of the Hanson brothers.

873
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,925
Since we were going through
their hometown, Tulsa...

874
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,521
we figured we'd go
to one of Tulsa's bustling malls...

875
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:25,362
and turn the Free Kevin campaign
into a Hanson campaign.

876
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:27,159
We could use the publicity..

877
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,967
and if we could confuse some Tulsans
in the process...

878
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:31,300
all the better.

879
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:33,431
And it sure wasn't hard to do that.

880
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:50,726
Once we'd confused people at the mall,
we headed over to Oral Roberts University...

881
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,659
in the hopes that the Religious Right
would climb on board.

882
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,530
When the vice president of the university,
a former federal agent...

883
00:49:01,637 --> 00:49:04,697
came down the stairs with a golf club,
we took the hint.

884
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,409
There wasn't a golf course for miles.

885
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:11,244
Hellflower, Satan's power

886
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:14,916
You grow more beautiful by the hour

887
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:18,315
You feed our hearts
And you free our minds

888
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:22,050
With the essence of the souls
that you devour

889
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:32,893
Shrinking violet makes the scene

890
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:36,661
In the formal garden of the queen

891
00:49:37,806 --> 00:49:40,367
Bloody Mary, so contrary

892
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,072
They had a hard time getting into my place.

893
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:47,041
I had the bedroom door closed,
so I didn't hear the pounding on the door

894
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:50,510
They were pounding on the door
out there for a good 10 minutes.

895
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:53,054
They actually started calling
on the cellular phone...

896
00:49:53,155 --> 00:49:55,454
and leaving messages
on my answering machine.

897
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,152
''This is the FBI.
We're at your door. Open up.''

898
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:02,157
I wasn't there when they searched my home.
My mom had to get me from school.

899
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:04,494
My dad was the only one home.
They thought...

900
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,460
that he was me.

901
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,003
They were looking for somebody
that was an adult.

902
00:50:09,905 --> 00:50:12,500
When they found out that I was like, 13...

903
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,277
they didn't know what to do.

904
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,940
I think when they walk in
and want to take things...

905
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:20,539
they should be told to go to hell...

906
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,016
take what they want, we'll see you in court,
don't even talk to me.

907
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:29,121
The problem, of course, is that
hackers don't have the resources to do this.

908
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,626
They want to try to get off cheap...

909
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,288
so they cooperate and they plea bargain...

910
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:37,431
and they end up pleading guilty
to something they didn't do.

911
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,559
And that sets the record bad
for them going forward.

912
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:45,132
I think if people had the resources,
or if there were an organization...

913
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,905
dedicated to helping people,
to providing the resources....

914
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:53,139
You know, something that's much more
than just a dummy front...

915
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,409
such as the EFF.

916
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:59,481
An organization that's actually truly willing
to help in those matters...

917
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:02,358
that we'd see a lot more progress
along those lines.

918
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:04,516
The government, for once...

919
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:07,188
would have to start conforming
to the same laws...

920
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,356
that they're supposedly enforcing.

921
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,032
We were detained for two hours
in the parking lot.

922
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:15,297
There were 13 police officers
and I think five or six police cars.

923
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:18,902
I told them what was going on...

924
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,068
but they seemed to think
there was more going on than there was.

925
00:51:23,746 --> 00:51:26,181
Without my consent
they took my box of crystals...

926
00:51:26,282 --> 00:51:28,911
even though they admitted
they didn't know what they were.

927
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:32,681
They took anything and everything
that had magnetic media on it...

928
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,552
or had an electrical plug on it.

929
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,487
They took other unrelated items
such as a woman's purse.

930
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:41,686
I'm not quite sure how that fits
into the scope of their investigation.

931
00:51:41,797 --> 00:51:43,594
Every business card I had.

932
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,934
They took everything
just to make life difficult on me.

933
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,704
They told me they're not trying
to chastise me...

934
00:51:51,407 --> 00:51:53,000
and then one of them said...

935
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:56,608
he used to play with baseball cards
when he was a kid.

936
00:51:57,079 --> 00:51:58,706
They would be searching my wardrobe.

937
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,545
I'd be standing there with the guy
he's asking questions...

938
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,914
and he's going through every pocket
in my wardrobe.

939
00:52:04,018 --> 00:52:05,681
Then it suddenly dawned on me...

940
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,349
I don't have to stand there.
So I walked out of the room.

941
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,518
He stopped searching the wardrobe
and walked out with me.

942
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,958
It was very obvious.

943
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:16,226
Their tactics weren't meant
to actually accomplish something.

944
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,927
Searching every pocket
of every shirt in my closet...

945
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:23,597
that tactic wasn't meant to do anything
except intimidate me.

946
00:52:24,106 --> 00:52:26,097
They showed up at my friend's house...

947
00:52:26,775 --> 00:52:29,744
where a 3-year-old and a 5-year-old
had just been put to bed.

948
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,313
They came storming into the house
with guns drawn...

949
00:52:32,414 --> 00:52:34,210
ran up the steps...

950
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,978
and said,
''Freeze! Secret Service! Don't move!''

951
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:41,987
I was sitting at the keyboard of a computer,
so I looked extremely dangerous.

952
00:52:42,925 --> 00:52:46,384
I was thrown to the floor, handcuffed,
and hogtied, and all that...

953
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,152
and dragged out. I told my..

954
00:52:48,797 --> 00:52:53,030
friend Ellen Fisher, who was there,
to call my lawyer, which she did.

955
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,199
They kept telling me to shut up.

956
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,976
I was taken back to the police station
in Havertown, Pennsylvania...

957
00:53:01,677 --> 00:53:05,704
and locked in a cell for about three hours
while my car was searched.

958
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,248
Then a Secret Service agent
interviewed me...

959
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,822
or interrogated me, wanted to know
what I was doing with the crystals.

960
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,324
And I said I was making them
available to people.

961
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,724
He tried to get me to say I was
committing fraud with them which I was not.

962
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:27,527
He got very irate that I wasn't telling him
what he wanted to hear.

963
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,003
Eventually they locked me
back in the cell again.

964
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,233
They refused to let me call my lawyer.

965
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,570
In fact, my rights weren't read to me.

966
00:53:34,677 --> 00:53:36,838
There were many instances
in which I told them...

967
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:38,608
I wanted to consult with my attorney...

968
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:42,445
and they said, ''That's not a good idea.''
They wouldn't let me get an attorney

969
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:44,452
So finally, when...

970
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:49,724
they all shifted from my apartment
to searching my office, actually at work...

971
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:52,351
I got to drive down in my own car.

972
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,393
I called an attorney...

973
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:57,523
and by the time they were at my work,
so was an attorney.

974
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,527
The agent in charge, Ken McGuire,
in particular...

975
00:54:01,637 --> 00:54:03,833
gave me a very nasty
and disappointed look...

976
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,635
at the fact
that I was willing to protect my rights.

977
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,306
It's really amazing.

978
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,208
He really gave me one of these:

979
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:15,677
''You shouldn't have done that'' looks.
''Now you're really in for it.''

980
00:54:15,784 --> 00:54:17,753
NASA people told my parents I was cocky...

981
00:54:17,853 --> 00:54:19,981
because I told them
to choose harder passwords.

982
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,581
I had cops tell me pretty well straight out:

983
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,753
''We really didn't want to harm Junior..

984
00:54:26,862 --> 00:54:29,126
''so we took his computer
and gave it to the boys...

985
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:32,166
''over in traffic management,
and it was just really groovy.''

986
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:36,300
Wait a minute. You're like,
''You took this kid's equipment?''

987
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:39,306
They were like,
''lt was his dad's, but he was using it.

988
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,237
''Dad should have known better.''

989
00:54:42,777 --> 00:54:47,512
So this is $4,000 worth of equipment
full of heaven only knows what content...

990
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,710
and you just pocketed it, basically?

991
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,755
Now you're going to charge him?
They said, ''lf we charge him...

992
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:57,554
''we've got to bring him up
under 14 different interstate laws...

993
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,492
''he's gonna be a felon and be ruined.''

994
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:04,226
''We explained this to them and they said,
'Take the machine, please.'''

995
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,193
But that's not legal.

996
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:09,202
That's nothing like legality

997
00:55:10,005 --> 00:55:11,496
It's blackmail, basically.

998
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:16,170
It's like with anyone else.
Simply because you have a badge...

999
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,481
doesn't give you the right to be an asshole.

1000
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:21,777
Unless you'd like me to be an asshole
back to you.

1001
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,443
I don't care who you are.

1002
00:55:24,085 --> 00:55:27,818
You will obtain the respect from me
that you earn. Period.

1003
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,782
I may have hacked NASA, but who doesn't?

1004
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:44,438
They say they clocked us
at just under 100 miles per hour...

1005
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,268
on the Interstate in New Mexico.

1006
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:50,411
And the cop wouldn't let us go
until I gave him my Social Security number.

1007
00:55:50,512 --> 00:55:54,277
To make matters worse, he told us
we were still 11 hours away from Vegas.

1008
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,710
Things seemed pretty bleak.

1009
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,612
But, then, a miracle happened.

1010
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:04,152
All right!

1011
00:56:06,061 --> 00:56:08,655
He said 11 hours
and we made it in two and a half.

1012
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:11,858
These highway patrol people
don't know what they're talking about.

1013
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:13,731
All right, Las Vegas, let's do it!

1014
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:21,541
Twilight City gonna set my soul
It's gonna set my soul on fire

1015
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,206
Got a whole lot of money
that's ready to burn

1016
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:27,907
So get those stakes up high

1017
00:56:28,217 --> 00:56:31,449
There's a thousand pretty women
waiting out there

1018
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:34,847
They're all waiting, they're devil-may-care

1019
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:38,052
And I'm just the devil
with love to spare, so

1020
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:40,592
Viva Las Vegas

1021
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:43,762
Viva Las Vegas

1022
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,831
Viva Las Vegas

1023
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:54,440
How I wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day

1024
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:59,208
Even if I ran out of speed, boy

1025
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:01,675
We're looking for the Defcon conference.

1026
00:57:01,784 --> 00:57:03,684
We're supposed to be filming here.

1027
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:05,014
Defcon conference?

1028
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,949
It's like computer hackers....

1029
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:09,251
Not that I know of.

1030
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:14,291
Were they gonna start inside the computer
and work their way out?

1031
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:19,458
It's about a thousand computer hackers
coming here.

1032
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,199
I've never heard of it.

1033
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,465
They must've done a good job
keeping this quiet.

1034
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:25,039
They even got me going.

1035
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,699
Plaza Hotel, Las Vegas?

1036
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,141
New Mexico.

1037
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,179
It was a mistake anybody could have made...

1038
00:57:35,284 --> 00:57:37,480
except nobody else seems to have made it.

1039
00:57:37,585 --> 00:57:39,143
At least if we were in New Mexico...

1040
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:43,123
we could stop by LosAlamos National Labs,
home of well-guarded nuclear secrets...

1041
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:46,820
and one of the many places
Shimomura had mysterious connections to.

1042
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:50,864
If we could get the word to the people here,
we just might turn some heads.

1043
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,148
In those few places
where we actually did get in...

1044
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:13,222
we always seemed to stay a bit too long
looking at the things...

1045
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:15,313
we weren't supposed to be looking at.

1046
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,121
This guy was mean,
and told us to get the hell out.

1047
00:58:20,762 --> 00:58:23,697
As we left, we noticed
more of these weird guys in fatigues...

1048
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,266
all around the building.

1049
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:31,065
That's when we got lost on a dark road
with no name in New Mexico...

1050
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:33,608
with a bunch of military zealots
surrounding us.

1051
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,338
We got the message.

1052
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:58,389
Twilight City gonna set my soul

1053
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,192
It's gonna set my soul on fire

1054
00:59:01,737 --> 00:59:04,639
Got a whole lotta money that's ready to burn

1055
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,465
So get those stakes up high

1056
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:11,244
There's a thousand pretty women
waiting out there

1057
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:14,347
They're all waiting, they're devil-may-care

1058
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:17,552
And I'm just the devil
with love to spare, so

1059
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:20,047
Viva Las Vegas

1060
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,215
Viva Las Vegas

1061
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,454
Viva Las Vegas

1062
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:34,094
How I wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day

1063
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:39,197
Even if I ran out of speed, boy

1064
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,036
When I started,
I never intended it to last this long.

1065
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:45,376
I thought it was going to be a party
and that's it.A one-time deal.

1066
00:59:45,547 --> 00:59:48,483
When we left, everybody said,
''Are you going to do it again?''

1067
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,518
And I said, ''I guess I could do this again.''

1068
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:55,215
Since then, more people get involved,
more people say:

1069
00:59:55,324 --> 00:59:57,793
''We could probably have some music.''

1070
00:59:57,893 --> 01:00:00,829
Next thing you know,
we've got a live laser light system...

1071
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:05,059
with LCD wall projectors and DJs coming in
from the United Kingdom to spin.

1072
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:16,139
It has taken on this life of its own.

1073
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,152
We are the Ghetto Hackers.

1074
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,565
Low-class, low-budget, high-octane.

1075
01:00:48,577 --> 01:00:50,010
-Dead!
-Cow!

1076
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:53,577
When I say rock, you say ass!

1077
01:00:53,681 --> 01:00:55,981
-Rock!
-Ass!

1078
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:57,813
Thank you very much. Good night.

1079
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,755
I have in my hand proof positive...

1080
01:01:02,858 --> 01:01:06,157
that NTis not the solution
to your computing problems.

1081
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:09,822
I have captured earlier today on film...

1082
01:01:09,931 --> 01:01:11,262
the blue screen of death...

1083
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:14,768
at Las Vegas' own
MGM Grand Hotel and Casino!

1084
01:01:17,005 --> 01:01:18,371
Thousands showed up.

1085
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:21,202
Even though the Free Kevin stickers
turned into toys...

1086
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:23,277
at least everybody here knew his name.

1087
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:30,646
You have to go to www.kevinmitnick.com.
Look it up for yourself.

1088
01:01:33,588 --> 01:01:35,523
''And it doesn't matter
what he says about us.''

1089
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:39,021
''What matters is us.

1090
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,686
''What matters is....''

1091
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:46,802
We were hot on the trail.

1092
01:01:46,802 --> 01:01:48,304
We were hot on the trail.

1093
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,204
I don't want to get into Shimomura.

1094
01:01:51,206 --> 01:01:53,641
I think he has a very large ego.

1095
01:01:53,742 --> 01:01:56,405
He's a very bright person and very smart...

1096
01:01:56,746 --> 01:02:00,204
but I think his social skills are lacking.

1097
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,643
For years, Shimomura had been eluding me.

1098
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,719
I couldn't even get on the same TV shows.

1099
01:02:06,054 --> 01:02:07,920
He'd pop up over on CNN...

1100
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,789
while I was stuck over
on a broadcast network.

1101
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:15,030
While he was getting all cozy
with Tom Brokaw...

1102
01:02:15,764 --> 01:02:18,199
I was being interrogated by Mike Wallace.

1103
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,764
2600: The Hacker Quarterly?

1104
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:24,431
Tsutomu wasn't even answering my e-mail.

1105
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,440
But nowthere would be no escape.

1106
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:31,342
The San Diego Supercomputer Center,
the place where he worked.

1107
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,574
We were closing in.

1108
01:02:33,815 --> 01:02:35,784
You notice how quiet it is?

1109
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:40,315
Like when a deer
is about to be killed by a lion?

1110
01:02:43,992 --> 01:02:45,858
-You're here to see him?
-Yes.

1111
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,791
-You're looking for Tsutomu?
-Yes.

1112
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:51,128
-I haven't seen him in three months.
-Really?

1113
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,697
Do you know where he is?

1114
01:02:54,268 --> 01:02:55,737
He's not here.

1115
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,132
Let me check with....

1116
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:59,434
Did you make arrangements
to meet him here?

1117
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:02,476
They weren'tvery firm
but he knew we were coming.

1118
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:07,672
-You can try his office.
-Did you have an appointment with him?

1119
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,978
-lt was very informal.
-I'm sorry.

1120
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:12,753
You can try the extension,
but I haven't seen him.

1121
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,322
Do I know him?

1122
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,384
Just from interacting on....

1123
01:03:17,492 --> 01:03:20,155
But I'm not.... I can't....

1124
01:03:20,262 --> 01:03:23,164
Definitely should have called first, I guess.

1125
01:03:23,465 --> 01:03:25,626
It's just he likes surprises so much.

1126
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:28,768
This sheet of paper
that we wanted him to have.

1127
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:33,467
He'll know what it's about. He wanted
a couple of these stickers as well.

1128
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:35,141
He wanted these?

1129
01:03:35,277 --> 01:03:39,476
I just wanted to make sure he got them.
Great. Thanks so much for your help.

1130
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:42,449
It wasn't much better than the reception
we got at Miramax.

1131
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:45,679
But we left our calling card in a place
where we knew he'd see it.

1132
01:03:48,356 --> 01:03:52,487
I think it's absurd when I find out
that Shimomura, in addition...

1133
01:03:52,594 --> 01:03:55,563
is giving instructions to Skeet Ulrich...

1134
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:58,257
on howto act more like Kevin.

1135
01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:02,166
Here's someone instructing him
howto act more like Kevin...

1136
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:05,172
and it's a person that met Kevin only once...

1137
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:09,068
in court, under circumstances of duress.

1138
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:13,213
From there how he can ascertain
how Kevin acts, I don't know.

1139
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:18,215
When I step on this curb
we're officially on his property.

1140
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,565
Sorry to bother you.
We're looking for somebody next door.

1141
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,929
We're not sure if we have
the right neighborhood.

1142
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:36,492
-Tsutomu Shimomura.
-He moved. He's long gone.

1143
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,369
How long ago did he move?

1144
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,099
-Seven, eight months?
-Really?

1145
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,835
Do you have any idea where he went?

1146
01:04:41,943 --> 01:04:44,708
No, he was renting,
and the people who own it moved back in.

1147
01:04:44,813 --> 01:04:47,304
He's in the national news.
Are you aware of that?

1148
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,940
-He's what?
-There's a movie that they're making.

1149
01:04:50,418 --> 01:04:52,943
-You can see, I'm on the phone.
-I'm sorry.

1150
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:56,021
-They're making a movie about him.
-They're making a movie?

1151
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,956
-lt's all about--
-I read his book.

1152
01:05:00,862 --> 01:05:03,592
They're making a big
Hollywood blockbuster about it.

1153
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:06,929
They may film around here
because this is one of the places he lived.

1154
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:09,266
-So I could be a star?
-You could be a star.

1155
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:12,530
I've been waiting to be discovered
for a long time.

1156
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:14,405
He could be anywhere.

1157
01:05:16,945 --> 01:05:18,208
Man, that's scary.

1158
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:21,373
We had one last address to try
inside a gated community.

1159
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,643
But this was getting frustrating.

1160
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:25,947
We have another lead here.

1161
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:30,853
We're certainly seeing a lot
of the nicer places of this neighborhood.

1162
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,030
''Out of order, please use other door.''

1163
01:05:40,902 --> 01:05:44,838
You know, if that was a computer,
we'd be facing 50 years in jail.

1164
01:05:50,478 --> 01:05:53,106
They think we're
the Publisher's Clearinghouse.

1165
01:05:55,684 --> 01:05:58,277
It was like he was a step ahead of us.

1166
01:05:59,688 --> 01:06:01,384
Japanese? Long hair?

1167
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,652
For some reason,
people think it's a good idea...

1168
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,855
to have a full directory
of every tenant in an apartment complex...

1169
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,023
available to anyone in the world.

1170
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,597
But it gave us
the definitive proof we needed:

1171
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,398
Shimomura wasn't here either.

1172
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,605
It's a pretty cool system, though.

1173
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,204
Let's try a couple of other things.

1174
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:29,306
We're going to enter
the room number this time.

1175
01:06:33,121 --> 01:06:34,179
Now it's dialing.

1176
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:38,425
That's their whole phone number
being broadcast!

1177
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,097
See if we get an answering machine.

1178
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,525
You've reached Amy.
I'm sorry I'm unavailable to take your call.

1179
01:06:47,635 --> 01:06:50,126
Please leave a message.
I'll get back to you as soon....

1180
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,503
We've gotten everything
we can out of this place...

1181
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:56,668
and made ourselves look suspicious at
the same time so we'd better get out of here.

1182
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:58,514
On the way out of San Diego,
our rental car broke.

1183
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,681
On the way out of San Diego,
our rental car broke.

1184
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:02,081
The trunk wouldn't close.

1185
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,744
We should get this tape of the trunk, too.

1186
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,849
Holy fuck! Oh, my God! Shit!

1187
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:14,257
We're right underneath the flight path!

1188
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:17,023
We had to clean everything out
so we could exchange it...

1189
01:07:17,132 --> 01:07:20,728
including the disgusting piece of gum
that somehow got stuck to the door.

1190
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:23,938
You know what,
I'll use their own key to scrape it off.

1191
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:25,597
Okay, I'm down.

1192
01:07:25,974 --> 01:07:29,034
This is the most disgusting thing
I've ever had to do in my life.

1193
01:07:29,143 --> 01:07:30,907
You know it's still soft. Oh, God!

1194
01:07:31,646 --> 01:07:32,670
Want some gum?

1195
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:41,619
This is a scary neighborhood.

1196
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,851
We made it to LosAngeles
in a brand-new rental car.

1197
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,427
Our first stop,
the University of Southern California...

1198
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:51,295
where Kevin had been accused of storing
software from cellular phone companies.

1199
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,097
USC claimed that somehow caused
over $1,000 in damage.

1200
01:07:55,335 --> 01:07:57,702
I wanted to know what computer system
gets damaged...

1201
01:07:57,806 --> 01:07:59,739
by having files stored on it!

1202
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:03,507
I'm Brian Johnson. I'm
the Associate Director of Customer Support.

1203
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:06,978
Yeah, we're not allowed
to comment on any of the security.

1204
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,210
At least we finally
managed to find someone...

1205
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,512
who'd say they weren't allowed
to say anything.

1206
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:13,588
That was progress, right?

1207
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:15,556
The Metropolitan Detention Center
in Los Angeles...

1208
01:08:15,556 --> 01:08:17,560
The Metropolitan Detention Center
in Los Angeles...

1209
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,926
where Kevin had been held
for three-and-a-half years.

1210
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:22,497
It was his 35th birthday
and we wanted to say hi.

1211
01:08:22,596 --> 01:08:25,725
The closest we could come
was the Mobil station across the street.

1212
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:29,395
It was a popular place for all the people
who couldn'tvisit their friends.

1213
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:32,064
I know he's looking at me, so I can wave hi.

1214
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:36,337
And he gives me a call
and he says, ''lt's cool, you went to see me.''

1215
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:39,502
-He's comfortable with that.
-How often do you come by?

1216
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:41,911
Like, almost once a week.

1217
01:08:42,015 --> 01:08:45,180
When I drop off my sister
that goes to see him.

1218
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:48,085
-How come you can't go in there and visit?
-lt's too strict.

1219
01:08:48,189 --> 01:08:51,158
I wouldn't know why the reason
they don't let us go in.

1220
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,194
-You're his brother?
-He's my brother-in-law.

1221
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,523
Married to my sister.

1222
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:58,225
-So it's only immediate family?
-Yeah, immediate family. So I can't see him.

1223
01:08:58,332 --> 01:09:00,698
He talks to me
through the phone and letters.

1224
01:09:01,136 --> 01:09:03,296
-I just come and say hi.
-What's he in for?

1225
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,576
I don't know what the reason why he's in,
but he's just in.

1226
01:09:10,645 --> 01:09:14,104
And you bring your friends with you?
Are they part of the family, too?

1227
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,207
Yeah, they know my brother-in-law

1228
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,618
We grew up together so....

1229
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,122
Have you heard of Kevin Mitnick,
the person we're here for?

1230
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,591
-I never heard of him.
-He's a computer hacker.

1231
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,854
-You know what computer hackers are?
-Yeah.

1232
01:09:27,962 --> 01:09:30,488
He's been in there
for three-and-a-half years...

1233
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:35,359
-and he hasn't had a trial yet.
-He should get a trial, you know?

1234
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:39,667
He's working on it, he's trying,
but the wheels of justice move very slowly.

1235
01:09:39,774 --> 01:09:41,172
That's something true.

1236
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:43,899
They're not the ones that--

1237
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,408
Sure.

1238
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,649
There's so many people, I think.
It's overcrowded.

1239
01:09:51,386 --> 01:09:54,912
I wouldn't even know what to tell you,
I've never been in that system.

1240
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,720
He must've went in
somebody's government--

1241
01:09:57,826 --> 01:09:59,555
He must've pissed somebody off.

1242
01:09:59,993 --> 01:10:02,189
Pissed somebody off
in the government pretty good.

1243
01:10:02,296 --> 01:10:05,426
They probably laughed and said,
''You have to stay there a while.''

1244
01:10:05,533 --> 01:10:07,796
That's not fair but that's the way it is.

1245
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:10,167
When the windows
are only a couple of inches wide...

1246
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:12,502
it's hard to find
the person you're looking for...

1247
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:14,939
even if you know exactly what time to look.

1248
01:10:15,042 --> 01:10:16,805
And then we heard it.

1249
01:10:23,685 --> 01:10:24,845
Yeah, what was that?

1250
01:10:24,953 --> 01:10:26,716
I heard a pounding on the window

1251
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,353
1,2,3,4,5.

1252
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:40,060
He's shining a light or something.

1253
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:47,332
I can see him now.

1254
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,739
Was that you?That was you.

1255
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:54,078
You were pounding on the glass, right?
We heard that across the street.

1256
01:10:54,181 --> 01:10:57,640
We were looking at the wrong window.
Then we heard this pounding noise.

1257
01:10:57,752 --> 01:10:59,653
Come back to the window
and wave some more.

1258
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:01,118
Can you do that?

1259
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:05,524
We'll put a sticker up, we just don't want
the sticker to come back to haunt you.

1260
01:11:05,627 --> 01:11:06,925
He wants us to put a sticker.

1261
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,122
-He wants a sticker?
-A sticker would be cool.

1262
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:10,662
We can see your hand.

1263
01:11:10,765 --> 01:11:13,496
I doubt you can stick
your whole head through the window

1264
01:11:13,801 --> 01:11:15,792
Splotch your face up against the window

1265
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:18,667
Nowthat we know it's the right one,
we can zoom in on it.

1266
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:21,537
All right, cool.
We'll see you in two minutes?

1267
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:25,009
Okay, great. See you then. Bye.

1268
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:29,073
He's going to be up there in two minutes.
That was definitely him.

1269
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:32,381
I wish we could go in there
and see him without having to do this.

1270
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:34,149
But, hell, I'll take it.

1271
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:38,386
We found out that our filming
the prison had caused such a stir..

1272
01:11:38,493 --> 01:11:40,394
that every single prisoner
was locked down...

1273
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:42,962
confined to their cell for the rest of the day

1274
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:46,729
And Kevin told us
it was the best time he had had in years.

1275
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:49,761
Like this.

1276
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:55,908
That's cool.

1277
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,747
Even the manager of the station
said it was all right.

1278
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:15,153
This guy in the blue car
just gave me $6 for the defense fund.

1279
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:18,288
No kidding. Thanks! That's great.
That's amazing.

1280
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:21,493
Look where I put the sticker.
I got permission from the owner.

1281
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:22,934
It'll be gone tomorrow.

1282
01:12:23,037 --> 01:12:24,903
-That's great.
-lt'll be there for a while.

1283
01:12:25,006 --> 01:12:26,667
-He let you do that?
-Yeah, I asked him.

1284
01:12:26,774 --> 01:12:30,140
Randolph's gonna get gas
and he's gonna fucking shit a brick.

1285
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:31,912
He was never served...

1286
01:12:34,082 --> 01:12:36,345
with a warrant for his arrest...

1287
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:41,055
for the supervised release violations
during the period of his supervised release.

1288
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:45,921
So by the time that he was done
and went on his way...

1289
01:12:47,395 --> 01:12:51,162
there's no indication that he was aware
that such a warrant existed.

1290
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,894
Damn! You know, Sprint really sucks.

1291
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:00,497
We wanted the entire city
of Los Angeles to know about Kevin.

1292
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,768
And what better way
than to put the message...

1293
01:13:03,877 --> 01:13:06,368
on the most famous billboard in town?

1294
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:11,377
It took us hours to climb that thing.

1295
01:13:12,587 --> 01:13:16,046
We honestly didn't know there was a road
that went straight up the back.

1296
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,648
But we made it.

1297
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,827
Funny thing, though.

1298
01:13:19,926 --> 01:13:22,761
We couldn't find anybody
who saw our Free Kevin banner.

1299
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:27,225
Later, we went
to the most famous movie theater in town...

1300
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:29,859
to try and spread the word from up close.

1301
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,076
Here, Free Kevin! Free Kevin Mitnick.

1302
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,148
It won't bite you. Speak English?

1303
01:13:40,247 --> 01:13:42,877
We're trying to get the message
across to Miramax...

1304
01:13:42,984 --> 01:13:46,318
that it's wrong to release
a movie that's supposed to be factual...

1305
01:13:46,421 --> 01:13:47,684
that's based on real events....

1306
01:13:47,788 --> 01:13:50,484
People will see this movie
and think this is a true story...

1307
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,060
when so much of it
has been completely fabricated.

1308
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:54,890
-I've heard about this guy.
-Really?

1309
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:57,488
Here, help stop a movie
about a computer hacker?

1310
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,134
-You got a problem?
-I got a problem.

1311
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:04,068
Come back and tell me about it.

1312
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,569
Pussy!

1313
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,801
It's hard to believe
someone in this country...

1314
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:14,076
could be in jail for three-and-a-half years,
held in a maximum-security facility...

1315
01:14:14,181 --> 01:14:15,810
no bail, no trial.

1316
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:18,176
I don't find thatvery hard to believe.

1317
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,845
-I read a book, Takedown.
-Takedown, that's right.

1318
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,685
I read like half of it.

1319
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:26,953
He gets out of jail,
he'll probably take over everything.

1320
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:30,791
That's the problem.
People think that, but it's not true.

1321
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:33,800
You don't think he could hack anything
if he just gets online?

1322
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,993
He can't hack anything
just by getting online.

1323
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:38,265
I mean, you gotta have
a program and whatever....

1324
01:14:38,372 --> 01:14:40,000
Why are you recording this?

1325
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:43,407
Hey, read about Kevin Mitnick?
They're making a movie about this guy.

1326
01:14:45,546 --> 01:14:48,277
He's the best guy ever!
I know him since I was, like day one.

1327
01:14:48,381 --> 01:14:49,939
Yeah, me too, yo!

1328
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:59,987
He's never done anything wrong,
he's never hurt anyone...

1329
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:02,461
and he's being treated
like that in this country.

1330
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:05,032
That is theAmerican way. Wake up.

1331
01:15:06,533 --> 01:15:10,027
Kevin was denied bail. Even a bail hearing.

1332
01:15:11,671 --> 01:15:15,268
If you recall,
even Ted Kaczynski got a bail hearing.

1333
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:18,868
His bail was turned down.
You're entitled to a bail hearing.

1334
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,407
On the other hand, Kevin...

1335
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,877
is getting treatment that is outside the law

1336
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:31,524
And that's what makes itvery difficult
for him to mount a legal defense.

1337
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,724
He's not being treated in a legal manner

1338
01:15:35,029 --> 01:15:38,395
I've never heard of anything
even approaching this level of...

1339
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,502
...confinement prior to a trial.

1340
01:15:43,069 --> 01:15:44,698
Murderers get bail.

1341
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,002
Armed robbers get bail.

1342
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:51,408
The fear of what he's going to do...

1343
01:15:51,511 --> 01:15:55,038
from a push-button telephone
in the general population of a cell...

1344
01:15:55,216 --> 01:15:59,676
shows again a lack of technical
understanding on the part of the prison...

1345
01:15:59,787 --> 01:16:02,586
and judicial system.And I think that's sad.

1346
01:16:02,989 --> 01:16:05,355
And he is right nowthe victim of that.

1347
01:16:07,662 --> 01:16:08,529
On our way up the coast,
we dropped in on Sun.

1348
01:16:08,529 --> 01:16:10,096
On our way up the coast,
we dropped in on Sun.

1349
01:16:10,096 --> 01:16:12,032
According to a letter we got our hands on...

1350
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,466
they said Kevin's acquisition
of their source code...

1351
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:17,332
represented hundreds of millions
of dollars in damage.

1352
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,564
Nowthey give
the source code away for free.

1353
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,471
Something wasn't right.

1354
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:22,634
So we're right here.

1355
01:16:22,743 --> 01:16:25,474
On the other side of the freeway
there's the other Sun.

1356
01:16:27,314 --> 01:16:29,578
And then further up is their big campus.

1357
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:33,551
Basically, all of this blank area...

1358
01:16:33,654 --> 01:16:36,520
is actually Sun buildings and Sun streets.

1359
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:39,524
We knew where we were,
now we just needed someone to talk to.

1360
01:16:39,627 --> 01:16:41,890
What number do we call
and who do we speak to?

1361
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:43,792
1-800-USA4SUN.

1362
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,957
They can direct you to whoever you need.

1363
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:47,533
USA4SUN?

1364
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:50,069
Can you remember
or do you want me to write it down?

1365
01:16:50,171 --> 01:16:53,608
The receptionist wouldn't let us talk
to anyone unless we called.

1366
01:16:53,707 --> 01:16:56,234
But we slipped a few leaflets
onto their coffee table.

1367
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,243
I thought she was being kind of patronizing.

1368
01:16:58,345 --> 01:17:01,180
''Do you want me to write that down
or can you remember it?''

1369
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:02,680
I can remember it.

1370
01:17:05,685 --> 01:17:07,243
USA4SUN, right?

1371
01:17:07,488 --> 01:17:10,582
-Was that it? Or was it SUN4USA? Fuck!
-Yeah.

1372
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:11,783
You sure?

1373
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:14,759
Should I run in and ask her again?

1374
01:17:15,363 --> 01:17:17,127
''Thank you for calling Sun.''

1375
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:26,368
I have a rotary phone.
I'm not going to press any buttons.

1376
01:17:32,546 --> 01:17:33,877
I'm pressing zero.

1377
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,944
I'm probably going to get her,too.

1378
01:17:41,622 --> 01:17:43,591
My call ''may be monitored.''

1379
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:46,956
Another machine.

1380
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:53,194
They want my eight-digit ID number!

1381
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:56,434
This is bullshit, man.

1382
01:17:57,372 --> 01:18:00,273
They've got me waiting
for a customer service representative.

1383
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,364
It's not exactly what I had in mind.

1384
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,104
But let's see what happens.

1385
01:18:06,413 --> 01:18:08,474
My call is ''very important to them.''

1386
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:12,984
He hung up!

1387
01:18:13,421 --> 01:18:14,719
He hung up on me!

1388
01:18:15,221 --> 01:18:18,350
Maybe he didn't hang up on me
but he hung up all the same.

1389
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,291
Fuck!All right.

1390
01:18:22,529 --> 01:18:25,863
I think on their web page
there's a direct public relations number

1391
01:18:25,966 --> 01:18:28,800
But we're not on their web page,
we're in their parking lot.

1392
01:18:30,203 --> 01:18:33,197
Wait a minute.
You don't have your Ricochet modem?

1393
01:18:33,306 --> 01:18:34,969
-Not today.
-You're not prepared!

1394
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:37,270
Shit. We can't access the web from here...

1395
01:18:37,377 --> 01:18:39,506
we're outside Sun
and we can't get on the net...

1396
01:18:39,613 --> 01:18:41,912
to find out what their phone number is!

1397
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:45,341
I'm gonna try this number one more time.

1398
01:18:45,453 --> 01:18:49,412
I'm gonna be a little patient here.
Assume maybe they made a little mistake.

1399
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:53,488
Okay, now I am waiting
for the corporate switchboard.

1400
01:18:56,096 --> 01:18:58,462
Hi, Pete, my name is Emmanuel.

1401
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,127
I'm trying to reach somebody
in Public Relations.

1402
01:19:01,234 --> 01:19:06,171
I'm hoping somebody can contact me
concerning the Kevin Mitnick case...

1403
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:09,109
and how it involved Sun.
We're doing a documentary.

1404
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:12,542
We came to the corporate headquarters
hoping to get an appointment...

1405
01:19:12,645 --> 01:19:16,604
and they gave us a phone number
and we're trying to do just that...

1406
01:19:16,716 --> 01:19:18,412
so if you could get back to me....

1407
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,010
They have a fortress here.

1408
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:24,786
They have that mighty guard there
at the front that won't let anybody by

1409
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,551
And then the voice mail guard here...

1410
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:30,323
that won't let anybody actually call
and speak to a person.

1411
01:19:30,797 --> 01:19:33,095
Maybe they'll call back, maybe they won't.

1412
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:36,033
This is the red hotline.
If that rings, we'll know

1413
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:39,332
We have GPS, good.

1414
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:41,934
GPS but no modem. Man, that sucks.

1415
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:47,069
I was using it last night and it was gone
in the morning which means....

1416
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,444
Sorry, no cameras in front of the building.

1417
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,576
How about if we film in that direction?

1418
01:19:52,453 --> 01:19:54,216
We can't have the cameras filming.

1419
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:56,288
Okay, 'cause we were just filming us.

1420
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:59,359
No, I can understand that,
but unfortunately...

1421
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:01,184
Wow, this was a new one.

1422
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:04,322
We couldn't even film ourselves
in Sun's parking lot.

1423
01:20:04,497 --> 01:20:07,332
Corporate paranoia was at an all-time high.

1424
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,493
And, needless to say,
Pete never called us back.

1425
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:11,604
Meanwhile, John Markoff
had agreed to talk to us.

1426
01:20:11,604 --> 01:20:13,506
Meanwhile, John Markoff
had agreed to talk to us.

1427
01:20:13,506 --> 01:20:15,635
Maybe now we'd finally get some answers.

1428
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,545
We made it to San Francisco
on the exact same day...

1429
01:20:18,645 --> 01:20:21,739
that psychologists from around the world
gathered for a convention.

1430
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,375
Maybe because so many people
in that area were depressed.

1431
01:20:24,484 --> 01:20:26,420
They have counseling phones
on the bridges...

1432
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,546
because so many people
are jumping off them.

1433
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,350
But San Francisco was a friendly town...

1434
01:20:30,457 --> 01:20:33,484
where people felt safe
leaving their trash unattended.

1435
01:20:33,828 --> 01:20:35,296
But more importantly...

1436
01:20:35,662 --> 01:20:40,158
the psychologists wound up taking
almost every hotel room in the entire city...

1437
01:20:43,069 --> 01:20:45,162
even the old-fashioned ones.

1438
01:20:47,841 --> 01:20:50,310
We were beginning to get desperate.

1439
01:20:52,011 --> 01:20:55,676
Then we found a hotel
that was almost completely deserted.

1440
01:20:55,783 --> 01:20:57,216
We never did find out why.

1441
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:02,417
Markoff mentions certain stories.

1442
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:06,426
He'll say, ''lt's been said that....''
or ''Other people have said that....''

1443
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:11,328
And he'll come up with these stories
like he shut down judges'TRW ratings...

1444
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:13,264
shut off power.... It's bullshit.

1445
01:21:13,734 --> 01:21:18,604
I don't think John Markoff
did it because he wanted to destroy Kevin.

1446
01:21:18,872 --> 01:21:23,002
But I think he did it
to keep Kevin's evil image.

1447
01:21:23,109 --> 01:21:25,408
Maybe he believed
some of the things himself.

1448
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,814
Okay, isn't a newspaperman...

1449
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:31,975
supposed to investigate something
before they publish it...

1450
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:34,747
before they put it in the newspaper as fact?

1451
01:21:35,256 --> 01:21:38,658
I know Spencer Tracy
and Clark Gable always did.

1452
01:21:42,363 --> 01:21:46,960
We didn't know what we were walking into.
Would Markoff tell us things about Mitnick...

1453
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,662
that would shock and horrify us?
Or would he realize...

1454
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:52,706
how much his front-page stories
and books had demonized Kevin...

1455
01:21:52,805 --> 01:21:55,569
helping to put him in the lousy place
he was still in?

1456
01:21:55,676 --> 01:21:57,667
This was our one chance
to make a difference.

1457
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:01,212
And, more than anything,
we wanted to be fair.

1458
01:22:01,614 --> 01:22:05,484
So we came up with the Markoff Meter.
We set a bar on his left and right side...

1459
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:09,386
and resolved not to judge him badly
until he said six bad or inaccurate things.

1460
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:11,185
And if he said six good things...

1461
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:14,194
well, then, the hacker world
would just have to deal with it.

1462
01:22:15,962 --> 01:22:18,158
Maybe this wouldn't be so bad.

1463
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:24,529
Nowthere's an easy point
for common courtesy.

1464
01:22:26,105 --> 01:22:28,096
I wanted to get to the heart of the matter

1465
01:22:28,207 --> 01:22:32,077
Like howthey knew it was Kevin
they were chasing in the first place?

1466
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:36,777
When I called the Qualcomm guys,
they had been talking to the FBI.

1467
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:40,514
And the FBI believed that it was Kevin
who had social engineered them.

1468
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:41,609
Why?

1469
01:22:43,823 --> 01:22:47,020
I don't know enough
about what was going on...

1470
01:22:47,127 --> 01:22:48,755
inside the FBI investigation.

1471
01:22:49,162 --> 01:22:51,756
That's a good question. I don't know why

1472
01:22:51,864 --> 01:22:55,461
But the FBI told the Qualcomm people
that it was Kevin.

1473
01:22:55,636 --> 01:22:58,399
And, to my mind, as a reporter,
it fit Kevin's M.O.

1474
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:00,804
-Which is what?
-Social engineering.

1475
01:23:00,908 --> 01:23:02,238
Really good social engineering.

1476
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:04,470
But there are thousands
of hackers out there--

1477
01:23:04,578 --> 01:23:06,103
That's true.

1478
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:08,345
I'm not saying it's proof.

1479
01:23:08,448 --> 01:23:10,814
I'm simply saying
the FBI believed it was Kevin.

1480
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:14,817
Did they hear a voice
or did they have a voice recording?

1481
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:19,649
Did they have a voice recording?
That's a good question. What did they have?

1482
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,319
This we couldn't forgive.

1483
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:25,229
Before you print front-page stories
about people eluding the authorities...

1484
01:23:25,332 --> 01:23:27,663
shouldn't you have
some real conclusive evidence?

1485
01:23:28,935 --> 01:23:30,564
What did Kevin do that was diferent?

1486
01:23:30,671 --> 01:23:33,800
He had a reputation
as being a very good social engineer.

1487
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:38,506
I've heard some tapes,
I've heard some people assert this.

1488
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:43,140
If he in fact was the person
who was at Qualcomm...

1489
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:45,377
then he was a good social engineer.

1490
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:50,988
Nowthat's better. No need to be stingy
with the compliments, after all.

1491
01:23:51,091 --> 01:23:53,287
One thing that's been following
Kevin Mitnick...

1492
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:58,094
since the first story Markoff wrote about him
is this myth about breaking into NORAD.

1493
01:23:58,198 --> 01:24:02,158
When you say something like that
enough times, people start to believe it.

1494
01:24:02,502 --> 01:24:05,529
And in Kevin's case,
it really made him into a villain.

1495
01:24:06,172 --> 01:24:08,573
So where did the NORAD stuff come from?

1496
01:24:09,176 --> 01:24:10,542
The NORAD stuff...

1497
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:14,046
is stuff that I got from someone...

1498
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:16,672
who was in legal trouble
with Kevin early on.

1499
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:21,546
So I have not been able to interview Kevin
face to face.

1500
01:24:21,654 --> 01:24:25,353
I've heard he said that it's inaccurate
but I haven't been able to ask him.

1501
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,826
The story did come from a friend of his.

1502
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,658
I know there are lots of stories
and you gotta sort through them.

1503
01:24:32,332 --> 01:24:34,301
But what stories have stuck?

1504
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:38,734
I remember the Kristy McNichol thing.
That didn't stick. NORAD didn't stick.

1505
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:43,470
Security Pacific I think is probably one
that stuck, that probably should stick.

1506
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:46,671
-You know about that?
-The bank that he got a job at--

1507
01:24:46,779 --> 01:24:49,341
That's right.
And then there was a press release...

1508
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:52,180
that suggested that the bank
was in financial trouble...

1509
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:55,188
though they managed to keep it of the wire,
it almost went on.

1510
01:24:55,288 --> 01:24:57,154
But what links that to Kevin?

1511
01:24:57,256 --> 01:25:01,056
The police investigators that we interviewed
believed it was Kevin.

1512
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:02,694
Based on what?

1513
01:25:06,332 --> 01:25:07,801
Based on what....

1514
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,931
Just coincidence of things.
Who else would do something like that?

1515
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:14,969
You've got to be kidding!

1516
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:17,609
You used ''who else''
to pin a crime on the guy...

1517
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:19,542
on the front page of the NewYork Times...

1518
01:25:19,645 --> 01:25:22,274
without even using
the word ''allegedly'' anywhere?

1519
01:25:22,381 --> 01:25:25,113
This was reported as fact
but it was never backed up.

1520
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:27,484
Just like NORAD, just like Kristy McNichol...

1521
01:25:27,587 --> 01:25:30,988
just like everything that made them
want to catch Kevin so badly.

1522
01:25:31,091 --> 01:25:33,492
Let's look at the issue
of solitary confinement.

1523
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:35,654
It wasn't mentioned
in the front-page article...

1524
01:25:35,761 --> 01:25:39,390
that Kevin was in solitary for 8 months
and was desperate not to go back...

1525
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:42,229
and that this above all
was what made him run.

1526
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:44,805
I mean, he didn't want to go back to jail.

1527
01:25:44,904 --> 01:25:47,372
Not just jail, solitary confinement.
Eight months.

1528
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,943
Was he in solitary before?
This was his first time.

1529
01:25:50,042 --> 01:25:51,203
1989.

1530
01:25:51,377 --> 01:25:54,109
He spent 8 months in solitary in 1989?
I didn't realize.

1531
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:58,618
Wait. He didn't spend 8 months in prison.
He was only in prison for six months in '89.

1532
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:03,247
You've written two books on the guy
as well as countless articles.

1533
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,417
You're somewhat of an expert
on Kevin Mitnick...

1534
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:07,893
and you didn't know
he was in solitary confinement?

1535
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:10,122
Or even how long his sentence was?

1536
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:13,426
For the record, Mitnick spent a year
in prison in 1988...

1537
01:26:13,533 --> 01:26:15,899
eight months of which
was in solitary confinement...

1538
01:26:16,002 --> 01:26:18,493
plus another six months in a halfway house.

1539
01:26:18,971 --> 01:26:21,462
With the psychologists in town
we could confirm...

1540
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:24,636
locking Kevin in solitary
was a fucked-up thing to do.

1541
01:26:28,814 --> 01:26:33,014
I think it's inhumane, and I think there are
better ways to handle our problems.

1542
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:36,783
Obviously if this person has been able
to do some of the things...

1543
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:40,292
that they think he was doing
with a computer, he's very bright.

1544
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,828
That's a real talent that's being wasted.

1545
01:26:43,162 --> 01:26:47,189
And, to lock him up, especially
in solitary confinement for 8 months....

1546
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:49,532
We wouldn't treat an animal that way

1547
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:53,203
And yet, this is a talented individual?
Excuse me.

1548
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:56,573
- It's not right. Thank you.
- Thanks very much.

1549
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:59,778
Wait, he was in solitary
the entire time he was at Lompoc?

1550
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,247
A large amount of the time. Eight months.

1551
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,746
Yeah, that's pretty hard.

1552
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:10,145
Okay. Markoff gains a point
for that show of humanity.

1553
01:27:10,756 --> 01:27:13,988
Now, here's something interesting.
When Kevin was on the run...

1554
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:17,426
he communicated with an Israeli hacker
known as jsz...

1555
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:21,729
who's believed to be the mastermind behind
the hacking that Kevin was blamed for.

1556
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:24,270
Yet Markoff never wrote a story about him...

1557
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:27,500
and didn't even followthrough
when jsz moved to New York.

1558
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:30,337
In fact, none of the authorities
seemed to care either...

1559
01:27:30,444 --> 01:27:33,005
almost as if these crimes were really trivial.

1560
01:27:33,113 --> 01:27:36,140
Nowthat would be a great story,
wouldn't it, John?

1561
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:38,180
I thought a lot about that.

1562
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:43,152
I just haven't had time to do the reporting.
I've got a day-to-day beat out here.

1563
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:47,091
You're right. It's probably a great story
I would love to talk to jsz.

1564
01:27:47,194 --> 01:27:50,528
-I should come to New York--
-That story was going on back then.

1565
01:27:50,631 --> 01:27:54,225
Jsz was supposedly the mastermind
behind everything.

1566
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:56,569
I never knew what the relations were.

1567
01:27:56,671 --> 01:27:59,604
The only thing I could say that I knew..

1568
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:03,143
was that jsz and Kevin...

1569
01:28:03,243 --> 01:28:05,734
were actively trading
information and software.

1570
01:28:05,845 --> 01:28:09,840
That's what I knew.
I knew nothing about masterminding.

1571
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:15,154
If you asked me
to reconstruct just from what I knew..

1572
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:18,555
it was jsz provided the tools
and Kevin made the attack.

1573
01:28:18,658 --> 01:28:20,127
But I have no idea if that's true.

1574
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,788
No idea?

1575
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:28,198
Isn't this what the book, series of articles,
and nowthe film are supposedly based on...

1576
01:28:28,301 --> 01:28:30,237
what Kevin actually did?

1577
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:33,296
I was amazed by what he didn't know

1578
01:28:33,573 --> 01:28:37,237
But there was more that he did know
and had never talked about before.

1579
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:40,371
But one interesting thing
that hasn't been made public.

1580
01:28:40,613 --> 01:28:44,413
You know, so much was made of the fact
that the credit cards were never used.

1581
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:45,917
They were used.

1582
01:28:46,453 --> 01:28:49,319
An American Express card,
part of the Netcom collection...

1583
01:28:49,422 --> 01:28:53,917
was used in Raleigh within two days
after Kevin was arrested.

1584
01:28:55,229 --> 01:28:56,489
So who used it?

1585
01:28:56,595 --> 01:29:00,087
-How did you find this out?
-I've just known it for a long time.

1586
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:02,698
You're saying the credit card
was used in Raleigh...

1587
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:05,238
and it was used after he was arrested?

1588
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,242
There are indications that there was
someone Kevin was in contact with...

1589
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:12,541
who knewthis and may have been
active in the Raleigh area.

1590
01:29:12,645 --> 01:29:15,411
All I'm saying is there's some evidence.

1591
01:29:15,515 --> 01:29:17,279
How come this wasn't in the book?

1592
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:19,376
How come it wasn't in the book.
Good question.

1593
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:21,819
I don't know why
we didn't put it in the book.

1594
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:24,783
This was really getting annoying.

1595
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:27,952
He didn't follow up on
the most interesting part of the story..

1596
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:31,259
and he didn't mention the fact
about the credit cards until now?

1597
01:29:31,364 --> 01:29:34,301
One more remark like that
and it's all over for Markoff.

1598
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:40,364
Look how many people are standing here
and not one person took my brochure.

1599
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:43,706
Look at all these people.
Not one of them took this.

1600
01:29:45,145 --> 01:29:46,670
Valuable coupons!

1601
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:49,676
What are they doing now?

1602
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,519
Oh, Kevin Mitnick!
He's the computer wizard.

1603
01:29:52,618 --> 01:29:56,112
The way that the Japanese wizard
found him was very interesting.

1604
01:29:56,422 --> 01:29:59,689
Mitnick respected the Japanese wizard
for tracking him.

1605
01:29:59,792 --> 01:30:00,988
On the other hand...

1606
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:04,756
since the whole computer business
is stupid and ridiculous to begin with...

1607
01:30:04,864 --> 01:30:09,166
why should Mitnick suffer
for a ridiculous assault on the culture...

1608
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:11,635
namely the computer. So that's it.

1609
01:30:11,738 --> 01:30:13,796
-What do you think of computers?
-I hate them.

1610
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:14,895
Why?

1611
01:30:15,341 --> 01:30:20,176
Because they're not like feeling skin,
and they're not like walking in the forest.

1612
01:30:20,546 --> 01:30:23,711
And one can get lost deeply in them.

1613
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:26,546
My son, of course, is in that world.

1614
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:31,221
These people are computerphiles
and he's a computerphobe.

1615
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:35,158
Hackers are all right
because they're anarchists, that's fine.

1616
01:30:35,261 --> 01:30:37,127
But the rest of it....

1617
01:30:37,863 --> 01:30:39,797
-This is bullshit.
-lt's pornography!

1618
01:30:39,899 --> 01:30:41,368
This is such bullshit!

1619
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:43,993
I like Chaos Computer Club, I like anarchy.

1620
01:30:44,104 --> 01:30:46,435
- You know Chaos Computer Club?
- No, but I like the whole idea.

1621
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:48,475
He's never heard of it.
He's saying this because--

1622
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:51,600
No, it's great. But Mitnick, it's ridiculous.

1623
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:53,978
Look, an activist.

1624
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,176
Look, a bag of artificial intelligence.

1625
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:02,220
They're from the '80s but I still bought them.
Just to get back to my roots.

1626
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:05,759
It's like the government's
making him look like....

1627
01:31:05,859 --> 01:31:10,591
It's to create a hacker mythology so
they can deprive other people of privacy...

1628
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:11,858
and other stuff like that.

1629
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:15,832
He hasn't done anything wrong. He hasn't
done any financial damage to anybody

1630
01:31:15,935 --> 01:31:18,131
He's basically just like a scapegoat.

1631
01:31:18,238 --> 01:31:22,073
I think most of the kids that I hang out with
are cool, geeky, hacker types.

1632
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:26,112
They understand.
Then there's my mom and everybody else.

1633
01:31:26,212 --> 01:31:29,181
Why would they have any reason
to believe anything...

1634
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:31,478
other than he's a total scumbag who....

1635
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:34,520
You know, like WarGames, the hacking.

1636
01:31:34,787 --> 01:31:38,189
That guy! Didn't he break into
massive computer systems?

1637
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:41,819
He's not accused of selling information,
of destroying computers...

1638
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:43,760
he's just accused of copying files.

1639
01:31:43,863 --> 01:31:46,832
Three-and-a-half years in prison for that.
How does that sound?

1640
01:31:46,934 --> 01:31:48,993
Yeah, cool, wow, all right, great. Register to vote?

1641
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:50,661
You're an activist, too?

1642
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:52,761
Imagine if somebody made a film
about you...

1643
01:31:52,872 --> 01:31:55,899
and they get this totally evil kind of guy
to play you...

1644
01:31:56,277 --> 01:32:00,770
and take everything that you ever did and
make you look like you're really terrible?

1645
01:32:01,046 --> 01:32:05,212
Look, there he is cheating
on a crossword puzzle, too!That guy!

1646
01:32:07,453 --> 01:32:11,152
Many interesting items
relating to Telegraph Street.

1647
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:14,194
Street scene, one of the best places
for street scene material!

1648
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:16,319
Here on the street scene...

1649
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:19,024
we've got newspapers, we got novels...

1650
01:32:19,131 --> 01:32:23,033
we got documentary calendars,
nine calendars for nine years, man.

1651
01:32:23,435 --> 01:32:27,567
What sysadmin is gonna have dot slash
in their path before usr/local/bin?

1652
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:31,167
It was cool. It's about using SUID
and making a script called ls...

1653
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:35,238
and keeping it in your home directory
and creating a file with escape characters...

1654
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:38,180
pretending to be a lamer,
''I need help deleting this.''

1655
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:40,277
And then they go and do an ls....

1656
01:32:40,386 --> 01:32:44,881
But what sysadmin is gonna have dot slash
in their path before usr/local/bin?

1657
01:32:45,457 --> 01:32:47,823
I don't know man, some of those hackers...

1658
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:51,363
when I'm on my computer
send me all this shit all at once.

1659
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:53,296
-Like what?
-I don't know.

1660
01:32:53,399 --> 01:32:55,631
All these messages. Makes my computer--

1661
01:32:55,734 --> 01:32:58,466
-Are you onAOL by any chance?
-No. Prodigy.

1662
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:01,564
We've been bending over backwards
to help this guy..

1663
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:04,439
and he's only one point away
from disqualification.

1664
01:33:04,545 --> 01:33:06,536
Let's do an easy one, the film.

1665
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:08,408
Everyone hates the film, right?

1666
01:33:08,515 --> 01:33:11,041
When I read the screenplay...

1667
01:33:11,152 --> 01:33:15,212
I was mostly just disappointed because
it seemed like a crummy screenplay.

1668
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:18,319
There we go. He's back in the running.

1669
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:21,862
With one clip to go,
the best Markoff could hope for was a tie.

1670
01:33:22,261 --> 01:33:24,823
So I gave him a chance
to show some humanity.

1671
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:27,867
I asked him to help us help Kevin
and sign a petition...

1672
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:30,961
to get him released from prison
and end the nightmare.

1673
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:35,537
He didn't want to sign the petition
but he had a better idea.

1674
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:38,470
If you could pass a message to Kevin...

1675
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:42,943
and say if he'd be willing to sit down
and talk to me before his trial...

1676
01:33:43,551 --> 01:33:47,715
I would love to do a piece.
And I think that's perfectly fair.

1677
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:53,091
If nothing else,
you gotta give the guy credit for trying.

1678
01:33:53,194 --> 01:33:57,390
More than a decade of writing about Kevin
and he still had yet to talk to him.

1679
01:33:57,698 --> 01:33:58,430
It was time for our last corporate visit.

1680
01:33:58,430 --> 01:33:59,966
It was time for our last corporate visit.

1681
01:33:59,966 --> 01:34:04,233
Novell, who claimed Kevin
cost them more than $75 million.

1682
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:07,529
We went to their corporate headquarters
in Provo, Utah.

1683
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:10,006
Okay, nowthe road says ''180 East.''

1684
01:34:11,545 --> 01:34:15,412
All right, we want 122 East, 1700 South.

1685
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:18,975
It's like some locker combination.

1686
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:21,645
Okay, here we are.

1687
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:25,751
Is there somebody
in charge of security maybe?

1688
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:28,859
The person in charge of security is....

1689
01:34:32,233 --> 01:34:33,823
He's just brand-new

1690
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:37,461
Check that out.This guy is so worried
about us seeing his nametag...

1691
01:34:37,569 --> 01:34:41,701
that he went through this acrobatic act
to turn it over nice and casual-like.

1692
01:34:42,274 --> 01:34:45,243
But in the end,
it was just like everywhere else.

1693
01:34:46,011 --> 01:34:48,207
Nobody was allowed to say anything.

1694
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:52,408
But, at least, we tried.

1695
01:34:54,055 --> 01:34:56,078
Hey, pal, look down. Whoops!

1696
01:34:58,225 --> 01:35:00,953
So the last corporate door
had been closed on us.

1697
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:02,029
And now we had one last task...

1698
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:03,296
And now we had one last task...

1699
01:35:03,296 --> 01:35:05,595
to head across the country
and stop the film.

1700
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:09,295
We knew it wouldn't work.
We always knew it wouldn't work.

1701
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:11,997
That's what hacking's been about
from the beginning.

1702
01:35:12,104 --> 01:35:15,631
Doing things that you knew wouldn't work,
just because you had to.

1703
01:35:15,743 --> 01:35:18,712
And trying to ignore the shit
happening to your friends...

1704
01:35:18,813 --> 01:35:21,872
and trying not to feel bad
when you couldn't change a thing.

1705
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:23,916
As we drove from state to state...

1706
01:35:24,018 --> 01:35:27,545
I thought of how bad it could get,
how bad it had already gotten.

1707
01:35:27,654 --> 01:35:30,283
I remembered what they do
to people who piss them off.

1708
01:35:30,457 --> 01:35:32,688
I remembered what they did to Bernie.

1709
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,760
The Bernie S. case,
as far as I'm concerned...

1710
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:38,832
got blown out of proportion
by a lot of things.

1711
01:35:38,931 --> 01:35:41,332
It got blown out of proportion
by the prosecution...

1712
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:46,064
who knew what exactly he had done
and their representation of it...

1713
01:35:46,171 --> 01:35:50,939
was almost to make him look like the guy
who blew up the Murrah Federal Building.

1714
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:55,104
To do that was an incredible leap.
But they managed to pass that of.

1715
01:35:55,614 --> 01:35:58,845
They made Bernie S.
look like an absolute terrorist.

1716
01:35:58,953 --> 01:36:02,854
The new statute that my attorney
had never heard of and neither had I...

1717
01:36:03,323 --> 01:36:06,760
that, in fact,
wasn't even in the law books yet...

1718
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:10,796
makes it a federal felony to possess...

1719
01:36:11,864 --> 01:36:13,527
hardware or software...

1720
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:16,533
for the modification
of telecommunications instruments...

1721
01:36:16,636 --> 01:36:19,697
for the unauthorized access
to telecommunications services.

1722
01:36:19,805 --> 01:36:23,172
I wasn't accused or alleged
to have done anything with software...

1723
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:26,269
or ever cloned a cellular phone
or anything of that nature.

1724
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:29,042
Just the mere possession of these things...

1725
01:36:29,181 --> 01:36:32,710
now constituted a federal felony
according to this new statute.

1726
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:35,287
The judge ordered me held without bail...

1727
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:37,149
based on the fact that books...

1728
01:36:37,256 --> 01:36:40,421
in fact, I think I had two books in my home...

1729
01:36:41,127 --> 01:36:45,359
on howfireworks, explosives are made.
That stuff has fascinated me.

1730
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:48,060
I had about 2,000 books
in my personal library.

1731
01:36:48,167 --> 01:36:52,162
What little media attention the case got
made Bernie look like a dangerous maniac.

1732
01:36:52,273 --> 01:36:54,537
He had never stolen anything,
not even a phone call.

1733
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:58,667
Everything used to make him look
like a terrorist, he had legitimately obtained.

1734
01:36:58,779 --> 01:37:01,907
When the Secret Service wants you
in prison, nobody asks them why

1735
01:37:02,015 --> 01:37:03,313
Not even a judge.

1736
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:08,015
''Your Honor, when we initially searched
Mr. Cummings' house...

1737
01:37:08,587 --> 01:37:12,046
''federal agents discovered a substance...

1738
01:37:12,193 --> 01:37:14,889
''they believed to be C4 plastic explosives.

1739
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:19,662
''While upon later analysis...

1740
01:37:20,332 --> 01:37:22,529
''it turned out not to be C4...

1741
01:37:22,636 --> 01:37:25,399
''the fact that it might have been
concerned us greatly.

1742
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:29,908
''And, based on that,
we'd recommend for a stronger sentence.''

1743
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:32,770
The judge didn't even blink
at that sort of a thing.

1744
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,179
Then the prosecutor made
a startling revelation to Bernie's lawyer.

1745
01:37:36,283 --> 01:37:38,613
She told him
she was under a lot of pressure...

1746
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:41,381
to prosecute this case
by the Secret Service...

1747
01:37:41,988 --> 01:37:45,787
and that, in fact, the real reason,
and that's a quote:

1748
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:49,020
''the real reason'' Ed is in jail...

1749
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:53,229
was not because of crystals or software
or anything like that.

1750
01:37:53,332 --> 01:37:56,631
It was because of other things
that they found in my house.

1751
01:37:57,738 --> 01:37:58,898
Namely:

1752
01:37:59,907 --> 01:38:04,104
surveillance photographs
of undercover Secret Service agents.

1753
01:38:04,612 --> 01:38:07,341
So I made these photos available
at the 2600 meeting...

1754
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:11,314
and it apparently was a coincidence
because I didn't call them...

1755
01:38:11,417 --> 01:38:14,046
but the local Fox television affiliate...

1756
01:38:14,854 --> 01:38:18,256
Fox 29 in Philadelphia, their news division,
showed up at the meeting.

1757
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:20,953
Most are between their mid-teens to late 20s.

1758
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:24,724
They gather every Friday night
at 30th Street Station for all to see.

1759
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:28,393
It's called the 2600 meeting,
named after a telephone frequency...

1760
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:30,297
and meetings like these are advertised...

1761
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:32,837
in a hi-tech magazine
you can buy at a bookstore.

1762
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:36,136
Some hackers call themselves ''fighters
for the freedom of information.''

1763
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:38,871
The US Secret Service
monitors some hackers.

1764
01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:41,310
But hackers say
it should be the other way around.

1765
01:38:41,413 --> 01:38:44,907
In this photograph the Secret Service agent
is picking his nose.

1766
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,886
The Secret Service didn't find it humorous.

1767
01:38:47,988 --> 01:38:50,684
Not only did they have
some of their agents' covers blown...

1768
01:38:50,791 --> 01:38:55,353
but they were picking their noses
on a major market television news station.

1769
01:38:56,729 --> 01:38:58,993
We all thought that was amusing...

1770
01:38:59,364 --> 01:39:01,560
until I was in federal prison...

1771
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:05,604
and I found out that the real reason
I was locked up was because of that.

1772
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:07,261
For a year-and-a-half...

1773
01:39:07,372 --> 01:39:11,399
Bernie was bounced around maximum
security prisons throughout Pennsylvania.

1774
01:39:12,179 --> 01:39:14,738
I think they got tired
of me filing these appeals...

1775
01:39:14,846 --> 01:39:19,546
because I found myself in handcufs
and shackles and taken up to...

1776
01:39:20,787 --> 01:39:24,019
Lehigh County Prison
which had a reputation...

1777
01:39:24,524 --> 01:39:28,051
amongst prisoners I had talked to
over the past year...

1778
01:39:29,261 --> 01:39:32,287
as probably one of the roughest prisons
in Pennsylvania.

1779
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:34,560
Within a day, Bernie was attacked.

1780
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:38,496
He punched me in the mouth
and I went down.

1781
01:39:38,904 --> 01:39:41,841
He was a big guy,
probably weighed like 220 pounds...

1782
01:39:43,344 --> 01:39:46,506
and I think it turned out later
he was on drugs...

1783
01:39:46,979 --> 01:39:49,108
coming down off crack or something.

1784
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:54,350
I went down and he started
to kick me in the head...

1785
01:39:54,453 --> 01:39:57,685
and I put my arm up to block his kick
and it broke my arm also.

1786
01:39:57,791 --> 01:40:01,750
After bleeding for hours,
Bernie was finally taken to the hospital...

1787
01:40:01,862 --> 01:40:04,886
but the authorities refused
to let him contact his relatives.

1788
01:40:04,997 --> 01:40:06,899
The hospital wanted me to sign this waiver.

1789
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:10,127
Whenever you go into surgery
you have to sign this thing saying...

1790
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:13,694
that you understand all the risks involved.
I refused to sign the paper.

1791
01:40:13,805 --> 01:40:16,104
I said, not until I get a hold of my uncle...

1792
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:19,439
or at least let somebody in my family
know what's going on.

1793
01:40:20,113 --> 01:40:23,377
The prison officials went bananas
that I wouldn't sign this waiver.

1794
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:27,613
It was a liability for them
that I wasn't getting medical treatment.

1795
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:32,252
I was severely injured and
they needed to operate on me right away.

1796
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:35,157
It got all the way up to
the warden at this place.

1797
01:40:36,529 --> 01:40:39,292
My uncle was a known person
in the community.

1798
01:40:39,399 --> 01:40:42,528
He'd been the president of the city council.
They knew who he was.

1799
01:40:42,636 --> 01:40:46,970
He wasn't someone who'd run down there
and try to spring me out of the hospital.

1800
01:40:47,239 --> 01:40:50,073
Meanwhile, I was handcuffed and shackled...

1801
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:55,042
to the hospital bed, which was ridiculous.
I didn't feel like going anywhere.

1802
01:40:55,582 --> 01:40:57,047
I was in bad shape.

1803
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:00,979
With a guard sitting there with a gun...

1804
01:41:01,087 --> 01:41:03,988
making sure that I didn't break
the handcuffs and run away.

1805
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:08,287
I was denied antibiotics for two days.

1806
01:41:08,662 --> 01:41:11,288
I was denied any painkillers at all...

1807
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:15,332
not even aspirin which I couldn't take
because my teeth were wired shut...

1808
01:41:15,435 --> 01:41:18,269
and I was probably in
the most excruciating pain...

1809
01:41:19,404 --> 01:41:22,863
that I've ever had,
which was more than I could ever imagine...

1810
01:41:22,975 --> 01:41:24,966
having multiple fractures.

1811
01:41:27,814 --> 01:41:32,274
It was like being in an altered state
of consciousness, this much pain.

1812
01:41:32,618 --> 01:41:34,779
They weren't bringing me food I could eat.

1813
01:41:34,886 --> 01:41:38,153
They brought solid food which
I couldn't eat because my jaw was wired shut!

1814
01:41:38,256 --> 01:41:40,417
I was getting to the point where....

1815
01:41:41,295 --> 01:41:44,729
I was starting to feel like,
''I don't care anymore.''

1816
01:41:46,364 --> 01:41:49,233
I was really feeling like, ''I give up.''

1817
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:51,529
I was losing my will to go ahead.

1818
01:41:52,171 --> 01:41:54,697
I was able to get a phone call out
the next day...

1819
01:41:54,806 --> 01:41:57,140
tell people where I was, what was going on.

1820
01:41:57,243 --> 01:42:01,180
And that was when
a major telephone campaign...

1821
01:42:01,582 --> 01:42:04,608
and Internet crusade started...

1822
01:42:05,752 --> 01:42:07,082
gaining momentum.

1823
01:42:07,252 --> 01:42:11,917
We had state representatives getting called.
I mean, like major politicians got calls...

1824
01:42:12,024 --> 01:42:16,189
and they called saying, ''What's with this?
What's this generating all the publicity for?''

1825
01:42:16,296 --> 01:42:20,060
Finally, the prison and the judge realized
they didn't need this publicity

1826
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:24,604
They wanted to get this thing over with
and wash their hands of it. So the judge...

1827
01:42:26,273 --> 01:42:29,502
signed an order to have me released
on a medical furlough...

1828
01:42:29,609 --> 01:42:32,010
which the guards had
never even heard of before.

1829
01:42:32,112 --> 01:42:35,444
They said, ''What is that? People die here.
We don't even let them out!''

1830
01:42:35,547 --> 01:42:39,006
So this was an unusual thing.
I'm convinced...

1831
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:44,614
that all the publicity
generated by 2600 Magazine...

1832
01:42:44,858 --> 01:42:46,826
the Internet, their website...

1833
01:42:47,528 --> 01:42:50,051
radio interviews,
I even forgot to mention that.

1834
01:42:50,162 --> 01:42:54,725
I'd been repeatedly interviewed
on WBAI's Off The Hook show...

1835
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:56,929
with Emmanuel Goldstein...

1836
01:42:57,037 --> 01:42:59,595
and people were following this case
from the beginning...

1837
01:42:59,706 --> 01:43:03,608
and it was generating a lot of attention
that way as well.

1838
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:05,939
I got letters, I got hundreds of letters.

1839
01:43:06,046 --> 01:43:09,377
We had gotten him out
but it sure didn't feel like a victory

1840
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,613
And the scars were permanent.

1841
01:43:11,716 --> 01:43:13,207
They had to put a....

1842
01:43:13,386 --> 01:43:15,787
The surgeons mounted...

1843
01:43:16,122 --> 01:43:20,389
a titanium bar in my arm.

1844
01:43:20,827 --> 01:43:23,453
I don't know if you can see it or not.

1845
01:43:23,564 --> 01:43:28,466
A nice scar from here to here
where they put this titanium bar in...

1846
01:43:28,734 --> 01:43:32,728
and seven stainless-steel screws.
This is how much my arm opens now.

1847
01:43:32,837 --> 01:43:36,739
That's it. That's my full range of motion
in my left arm.

1848
01:43:36,841 --> 01:43:40,506
Unlike my good arm which straightens out.
Anyway, that's what I got.

1849
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:44,274
My jaw doesn't open as much as it used to.

1850
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:48,286
If I'm trying to bite an apple,
I can't get it in like I used to.

1851
01:43:48,787 --> 01:43:50,345
But I live with it.

1852
01:43:52,626 --> 01:43:53,460
We crossed the entire country and
were finally closing in on the Takedown set.

1853
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:56,761
We crossed the entire country and
were finally closing in on the Takedown set.

1854
01:43:56,761 --> 01:43:58,390
But there was a problem.

1855
01:43:58,497 --> 01:44:01,524
It seems that the hurricane...

1856
01:44:02,469 --> 01:44:06,734
is making a beeline for the set
at this point in time.

1857
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:11,734
In fact, it's estimated that it will reach
and destroy the set by sometime tomorrow.

1858
01:44:12,212 --> 01:44:14,645
And, that's something
that causes me concern...

1859
01:44:14,747 --> 01:44:17,841
because it's not like that's something
we wanted to have happen.

1860
01:44:17,951 --> 01:44:22,251
I fear that one of the listeners
or one of the subscribers or somebody...

1861
01:44:22,622 --> 01:44:25,216
may have called upon almightyAllah...

1862
01:44:25,323 --> 01:44:27,622
or Christ or whatever...

1863
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:31,685
to rain forth upon these people
with all kinds of venom.

1864
01:44:32,265 --> 01:44:35,564
I'd like to stress at this point
that that's not what we meant to do.

1865
01:44:35,667 --> 01:44:38,229
That's not exactly how
I want things to turn out.

1866
01:44:38,337 --> 01:44:42,536
I fear that the Takedown people
aren't taking this seriously.

1867
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:47,344
If you look at the map,
if you look at the news reports...

1868
01:44:47,712 --> 01:44:52,014
you will see the eye of the hurricane,
you will see the direction it's heading for...

1869
01:44:52,118 --> 01:44:55,712
you will see a little dot that indicates
Takedown being produced there.

1870
01:44:55,822 --> 01:44:58,948
That is where it's heading.
This is like the scene in Twister...

1871
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:02,926
where the rival gangs of twister watchers
are trying to warn each other:

1872
01:45:03,029 --> 01:45:05,189
''This is the big one!''
Well, this is the big one.

1873
01:45:05,297 --> 01:45:06,960
They were looking at this thing...

1874
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:10,594
and they saw another hurricane
contained within this hurricane.

1875
01:45:10,871 --> 01:45:13,237
And they say they've never seen that before.

1876
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:16,867
And, if that's not enough for you,
Hurricane Bonnie.

1877
01:45:17,243 --> 01:45:19,974
Bonnie is the name
of Kevin Mitnick's ex-wife.

1878
01:45:20,078 --> 01:45:24,140
Nowthe metaphor just could not
be more perfect for me.

1879
01:45:24,384 --> 01:45:28,411
Of course, we didn't take our own advice
and drove straight into the storm.

1880
01:45:34,225 --> 01:45:38,527
We thought we might be able to get
a lot closer to the set if nobody was around.

1881
01:45:38,765 --> 01:45:40,060
We were right.

1882
01:45:46,872 --> 01:45:50,069
They seemed to have a real fixation
on gun safety in this place.

1883
01:45:50,176 --> 01:45:52,337
You had to wonder what had happened.

1884
01:45:55,448 --> 01:45:59,975
We took a little tour of the restricted area
past the unguarded guardhouse.

1885
01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:09,493
The storm passed.

1886
01:46:09,828 --> 01:46:12,319
And while we were exploring the next day...

1887
01:46:12,631 --> 01:46:14,359
we made a discovery.

1888
01:46:15,868 --> 01:46:18,497
And they all want Free Kevin stickers.
The whole crew.

1889
01:46:18,604 --> 01:46:22,301
If you give me some, I will send it to them.
They will put them on their cars.

1890
01:46:22,408 --> 01:46:23,931
Was it really this easy?

1891
01:46:24,042 --> 01:46:26,569
Had we discovered where
the Takedown people were...

1892
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,408
through our own bumper sticker?

1893
01:46:28,515 --> 01:46:30,813
-I have Mr. Wong in Number 9.
-Russell Wong.

1894
01:46:30,917 --> 01:46:32,782
Yeah. He's in Number 9.

1895
01:46:32,886 --> 01:46:34,944
-ls he still here?
-I think he is.

1896
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:38,786
The receptionist went out of her way
to tell us where everyone was staying.

1897
01:46:38,890 --> 01:46:41,417
And while the guy playing
Shimomura wasn't in...

1898
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:44,929
we found the producer who promised us
an interviewthat coming Sunday.

1899
01:46:45,029 --> 01:46:46,930
The place was swarming with celebrities...

1900
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:50,694
like cast members from Dawson's Creek
engaging in decadent behavior.

1901
01:46:51,872 --> 01:46:55,033
We wandered around town,
taking in the carnage from Bonnie...

1902
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:56,939
seeing the desperate people.

1903
01:46:57,911 --> 01:47:01,310
We witnessed civilization
brought to a standstill.

1904
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,688
Roads were closed...

1905
01:47:11,556 --> 01:47:12,957
power was out...

1906
01:47:17,296 --> 01:47:18,957
trees were knocked down.

1907
01:47:20,466 --> 01:47:22,229
But it didn't matter.

1908
01:47:22,435 --> 01:47:25,371
We were going to finally talk
to the Takedown people!

1909
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:29,902
There was nothing to do,
the computer store was closed.

1910
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:33,104
We had four days to kill
so we drove all the way to Raleigh...

1911
01:47:33,212 --> 01:47:35,545
to see the town where Kevin Mitnick
was captured.

1912
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:39,105
The cellular towers where Markoff
and Shimomura tracked Kevin's signal.

1913
01:47:39,219 --> 01:47:41,913
And this was the apartment complex
it led them to.

1914
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:44,614
And this was Kevin's actual apartment.

1915
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,216
-You have a computer yourself?
-Yeah.

1916
01:47:47,327 --> 01:47:48,487
Be careful.

1917
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:50,563
I'll keep that in mind.

1918
01:47:50,662 --> 01:47:54,862
We foundT akedown crew members in
Wilmington where the power was restored.

1919
01:47:54,966 --> 01:47:59,268
You have to remember that
film is usually for fourth-grade mentalities.

1920
01:47:59,372 --> 01:48:02,305
Skeet is definitely.... He's a great actor.

1921
01:48:04,077 --> 01:48:07,274
He's the most natural actor,
so Kevin's lucky.

1922
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:10,140
He's very charismatic.

1923
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:14,015
There's nothing you can do to Skeet Ulrich
that makes him uncharismatic.

1924
01:48:14,118 --> 01:48:17,145
So that's kind of, I mean,
from your side, it's kind of...

1925
01:48:17,256 --> 01:48:19,247
he's lucky, you know?

1926
01:48:19,591 --> 01:48:22,890
I promised to tell Kevin how lucky he was
next time I talked to him.

1927
01:48:22,996 --> 01:48:24,987
But now it was time for our interview.

1928
01:48:25,096 --> 01:48:27,532
We had been in North Carolina for five days.

1929
01:48:27,634 --> 01:48:28,997
But something was wrong.

1930
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:32,832
Miramax had changed their mind
and nowthey didn't want to talk to us.

1931
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:35,872
So we staged an impromptu protest
outside the studio.

1932
01:48:35,975 --> 01:48:38,877
And as we were leaving,
destiny hit us again.

1933
01:48:39,377 --> 01:48:39,944
This time we wouldn't let them escape.

1934
01:48:39,944 --> 01:48:43,716
This time we wouldn't let them escape.

1935
01:48:43,716 --> 01:48:46,777
We drove next door
and waited for them to leave.

1936
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:51,453
There he goes. Yeah.

1937
01:48:54,792 --> 01:48:57,819
And off he goes into the wild blue yonder

1938
01:48:58,096 --> 01:49:00,362
This is the real Takedown!

1939
01:49:04,537 --> 01:49:06,198
We had two cars on our side...

1940
01:49:06,305 --> 01:49:10,207
we would outflank them, chase them,
ambush them, whatever it took.

1941
01:49:21,087 --> 01:49:24,523
-I wish I didn't have these running lights.
-Close enough. Go.

1942
01:49:26,225 --> 01:49:28,786
For six weeks
we'd been trying to talk to these people...

1943
01:49:28,895 --> 01:49:31,193
and we hadn't even gotten
a phone call back.

1944
01:49:31,296 --> 01:49:32,890
So this is what it came down to:

1945
01:49:32,997 --> 01:49:35,466
A cat-and-mouse game
in the streets of Wilmington.

1946
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:38,037
They didn't know
who they were dealing with.

1947
01:49:38,738 --> 01:49:40,533
He's making a U-turn.

1948
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:43,774
He's making a U-turn, that motherfucker

1949
01:49:44,377 --> 01:49:46,072
-Oh, God.
-No, he's getting gas.

1950
01:49:46,179 --> 01:49:49,908
-Man, there's a boat in the way.
-And only eight minutes left on this tape.

1951
01:49:50,015 --> 01:49:52,109
What do we do now?This is just great.

1952
01:49:52,216 --> 01:49:54,412
This is just so typical North Carolina-ish.

1953
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,886
Fucking boat blocking us on the street.

1954
01:49:57,090 --> 01:49:59,386
-He's not there.
-Oh, man!

1955
01:50:02,362 --> 01:50:05,331
This guy's good.This guy's real good.

1956
01:50:10,002 --> 01:50:13,131
They took off that way.
I think they know we're behind them.

1957
01:50:13,238 --> 01:50:15,537
They made a U-turn
and went into the gas station.

1958
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:17,166
Really? That's why.

1959
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:19,801
-Did they then go that way?
-They did go that way.

1960
01:50:19,912 --> 01:50:21,743
After they made the U-turn?

1961
01:50:21,846 --> 01:50:24,009
They left the gas station and went that way?

1962
01:50:24,117 --> 01:50:26,413
-They went that way.
-When? After the gas station?

1963
01:50:26,519 --> 01:50:28,350
A few minutes ago. I waited.

1964
01:50:28,453 --> 01:50:30,649
I thought maybe you'd come by

1965
01:50:30,788 --> 01:50:33,054
So they're headed that way
and I don't know where.

1966
01:50:33,158 --> 01:50:34,283
So let's go.

1967
01:50:34,394 --> 01:50:35,884
-Where are we gonna go?
-Forward.

1968
01:50:35,996 --> 01:50:38,122
Even if we go forward at maximum warp...

1969
01:50:38,229 --> 01:50:41,198
we can't catch them
because they're doing the same thing.

1970
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:44,099
Let's face it guys, we lost.They beat us.

1971
01:50:58,251 --> 01:50:59,877
-Shakes?
-Yeah.

1972
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:01,243
Shakes.

1973
01:51:01,819 --> 01:51:04,720
There's always the outside chance
they'll get a shake too.

1974
01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:06,658
We had failed.

1975
01:51:06,826 --> 01:51:08,487
We never found Shimomura...

1976
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:11,029
we never got to talk
to the Takedown people...

1977
01:51:11,131 --> 01:51:15,122
and we never got past the lobby
in any of the corporations we visited.

1978
01:51:15,234 --> 01:51:17,930
Worst of all, Kevin was still in prison.

1979
01:51:18,904 --> 01:51:19,005
1999 sawthe Free Kevin Movement
reach a fever pitch.

1980
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:23,810
1999 sawthe Free Kevin Movement
reach a fever pitch.

1981
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:27,109
The media wouldn't cover it,
so the message went on hacked web pages.

1982
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:34,247
And for the first time...

1983
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:37,948
hackers marched in the streets
in 15 cities all over the world...

1984
01:51:38,489 --> 01:51:40,980
even overseas in England and Russia.

1985
01:51:41,261 --> 01:51:42,658
It was an amazing spectacle...

1986
01:51:42,761 --> 01:51:46,528
and more people learned
about Kevin's plight than ever before.

1987
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:51,930
Even though Kevin Mitnick saw
his fourth year behind bars come and go...

1988
01:51:52,037 --> 01:51:54,698
we felt like we were getting somewhere.

1989
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,676
Excuse me? What are you doing?

1990
01:52:00,947 --> 01:52:03,846
And in the end,
Kevin did what he had to do...

1991
01:52:03,948 --> 01:52:06,817
to avoid spending
the next 10 years behind bars.

1992
01:52:08,688 --> 01:52:12,988
You're watching Southern California's
CBS 2 News at 6:30.

1993
01:52:13,259 --> 01:52:16,228
Good evening. I'm Gretchen Carr.
Ann Martin is off tonight.

1994
01:52:16,328 --> 01:52:18,488
And I'm Michael Tuck. Up front at 6:30...

1995
01:52:18,596 --> 01:52:22,090
a guilty plea by notorious computer hacker
Kevin David Mitnick.

1996
01:52:22,335 --> 01:52:23,893
Juan Fernandez joins us live...

1997
01:52:24,002 --> 01:52:26,301
from the Federal Courthouse
in downtown LosAngeles.

1998
01:52:26,404 --> 01:52:27,997
He was the first computer hacker...

1999
01:52:28,108 --> 01:52:30,770
to make it to the FBI's Most Wanted List.

2000
01:52:30,877 --> 01:52:33,277
And after a long battle
with the federal government...

2001
01:52:33,377 --> 01:52:36,746
the 35-year-old man
from the San Fernando Valley comes clean.

2002
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:40,944
His computer crimes apparently
cost companies millions of dollars...

2003
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:44,917
although Kevin Mitnick
never admitted to them until today..

2004
01:52:45,158 --> 01:52:48,059
ending a four-year battle
with the federal government.

2005
01:52:48,161 --> 01:52:49,457
This is a very serious crime.

2006
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,894
The federal government
takes this crime seriously.

2007
01:52:51,997 --> 01:52:53,260
We will prosecute hackers...

2008
01:52:53,364 --> 01:52:56,265
particularly when they cause
significant amounts of damage.

2009
01:52:56,368 --> 01:52:59,099
Mitnick nowfaces 46 months in jail.

2010
01:52:59,203 --> 01:53:02,470
He's already served eight months,
and according to his attorney...

2011
01:53:02,573 --> 01:53:06,636
with good behavior, Mitnick
might only have to serve one more year.

2012
01:53:07,011 --> 01:53:09,537
Mitnick will pay for his crimes
for the rest of his life.

2013
01:53:09,649 --> 01:53:11,582
Although his attorneys say
he has no money...

2014
01:53:11,684 --> 01:53:14,015
to pay restitution
to the companies that he hacked...

2015
01:53:14,118 --> 01:53:16,680
that doesn't mean
that they won't go after him later.

2016
01:53:16,788 --> 01:53:19,256
It was as if we hadn't said a word.

2017
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:24,957
I pray that they never wind up
in the legal system.

2018
01:53:26,698 --> 01:53:28,221
I pray that nobody does.

2019
01:53:28,332 --> 01:53:31,301
But the thing is that if they do...

2020
01:53:32,270 --> 01:53:36,037
right nowthe way it stands,
the cards are stacked against them.

2021
01:53:36,509 --> 01:53:37,567
It's not about fairness.

2022
01:53:37,676 --> 01:53:40,805
It's just about the way
the legal game is played.

2023
01:53:41,712 --> 01:53:43,908
It's crazy to bring up
the O.J. Simpson case...

2024
01:53:44,015 --> 01:53:45,541
because there's no comparison here...

2025
01:53:45,652 --> 01:53:49,554
but here's a case where a defendant
had basically an unlimited budget...

2026
01:53:49,756 --> 01:53:51,621
and look what that legal team accomplished.

2027
01:53:51,724 --> 01:53:54,420
I'm not saying you need a lot of money
to get off for something you did.

2028
01:53:54,527 --> 01:53:57,551
I'm saying it doesn't matter
whether you did it or not.

2029
01:53:57,764 --> 01:53:59,457
The case, the legal system...

2030
01:53:59,564 --> 01:54:02,694
the justice system isn't about what you did
or what you didn't do.

2031
01:54:02,801 --> 01:54:05,667
It's about either the government
is going to win the case...

2032
01:54:05,770 --> 01:54:07,000
or you'll win the case.

2033
01:54:07,104 --> 01:54:10,631
That's all that matters in the case.
It isn't all that matters morally

2034
01:54:10,743 --> 01:54:13,676
I'm just saying in the court system,
that's all that matters.

2035
01:54:13,779 --> 01:54:15,837
The prosecution will do
whatever they can do...

2036
01:54:15,948 --> 01:54:18,609
spend whatever money they can
to win a case...

2037
01:54:18,716 --> 01:54:21,185
and you have to do the same thing
or you will lose.

2038
01:54:21,386 --> 01:54:24,877
You know, this is no longer
about what the law allows or doesn't allow

2039
01:54:24,989 --> 01:54:29,221
This is about how do you make it
as difficult as possible for the defendants...

2040
01:54:29,529 --> 01:54:32,622
to get them to roll over or cop a plea.

2041
01:54:32,730 --> 01:54:34,595
It has nothing to do with justice anymore.

2042
01:54:35,533 --> 01:54:37,594
God help you
if you get stuck in that system...

2043
01:54:37,703 --> 01:54:39,636
because it's very easy to get in...

2044
01:54:39,738 --> 01:54:43,002
and it's almost impossible
to get out unscathed...

2045
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:47,243
because you're up against an adversary...

2046
01:54:49,282 --> 01:54:52,681
that has everything going for it
except maybe the truth.

2047
01:54:54,118 --> 01:54:56,782
And, unfortunately,
that doesn't count for much.

2048
01:54:58,858 --> 01:55:00,792
So, that's the way it is.

2049
01:55:02,127 --> 01:55:05,220
If the legal community
doesn't wake up shortly...

2050
01:55:06,765 --> 01:55:09,756
we're gonna have more people locked up...

2051
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:12,064
than we know what to do with.

2052
01:55:13,404 --> 01:55:15,895
A lot of them are going to be kids.
Unfortunately.

2053
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:20,489
I don't think it ended.

2054
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:23,328
It turned into this huge controversy
that went on until now

2055
01:57:23,435 --> 01:57:26,997
But there weren't any more stories
in the New York Times about it.

2056
01:57:28,806 --> 01:57:32,573
What would you think
that we should have reported? I mean....

2057
02:01:02,154 --> 02:01:02,921
I appreciate everybody taking the time
to viewthis film...

2058
02:01:02,921 --> 02:01:05,224
I appreciate everybody taking the time
to viewthis film...

2059
02:01:05,224 --> 02:01:08,658
which was a tremendous effort
on the part of Emmanuel Goldstein...

2060
02:01:08,761 --> 02:01:11,752
and everyone on the 2600 staff.

2061
02:01:12,296 --> 02:01:13,662
And I want to offer...

2062
02:01:13,765 --> 02:01:17,395
my sincere appreciation and gratitude...

2063
02:01:17,536 --> 02:01:20,733
for the tremendous moral support
that everyone has given me...

2064
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:23,274
throughout this five year ordeal.

2065
