When I was a kid,

I would sneak out onto the roof at night.

I thought the moon
looked like a big round eye.

00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,135
And I would look up and I'd say,

"Do you see me?"

178
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,133
I would stay out there for hours.

179
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,403
Sometimes I'd fall asleep just dreaming.

183

I could never figure it out.

504
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,131
And so on and so forth.

505
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:22,465
Wow!

506
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,456
Did you always wanna be an actor?

507
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,959
Well, performing always
came naturally to me

508
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:28,805
because I'm a creator.

509
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:31,729
All right? I build, I make.
It's in my blood.

510
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:36,531
So whether I'm designing a collection
or creating a character,

511
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:38,895
it's all the same, right?

512
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:43,386
- I went out for a film last week.
- Oh, yeah, how did it go?

513
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,810
They said my face didn't match my voice.

514
01:06:45,902 --> 01:06:48,075
- Well, you can fix your face.
- No, don't do that.

515
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:49,239
Why not?

516
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:53,582
Because you can always tell
when beauty is manufactured.

517
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,316
And if you aren't born beautiful,
you never will be.

518
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:59,169
- That's terrible.
- No, it's true.

519
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:00,751
I don't think you can always tell.

521
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:08,097

and we need your expertise.

522
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:10,599
Okay.

01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:13,349
You know Gigi, right?

524
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:14,931
Well, I mean, we just met.

525
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:18,336
Will you stand up so that
he can take a look at you?

526
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:19,435
Go on, stand up.

527
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:26,178
Well?

528
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:30,116
Well, what?

529
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,023
What do you think?
Do you think she is beautiful?

530
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,693
I don't know, I mean...

531
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,193
Yeah, I guess she's fine.

532
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:42,361
Yes, yes. That's exactly the word
that I was looking for.

533
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,131
She's fine, right?

534
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:45,535
You can sit down now, thanks.

535
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:47,969
Thank you, Dean.

536
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,901
Now look at Jesse.

537
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:56,083
Nothing fake, nothing false.

538
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,816
A diamond in a sea of glass.

539
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:06,885
True beauty is the highest
currency we have.

540
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,155
Now, without it, she would be nothing.

541
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:13,994
DEAN: I think you're wrong.

542
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:15,992
Excuse me.

543
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,599
I said, I think you're wrong.

544
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:24,420
So are you gonna tell me that
it's what's inside that counts?

545
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,343
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.

546
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:30,517
Well, I think

547
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:34,012
that if she wasn't beautiful,

548
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,752
you wouldn't have even stopped to look.

549
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:49,360
Beauty isn't everything.
It's the only thing.

550

Hey, let's get out of here.

she hasn't worked in months.

682
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:29,200
I mean, I keep telling her,
"Girl, you need to retire."

you're so irrelevant.

ANNIE: No.

689
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:45,320
I mean, she's so desperate,
the other day she went uptown,

690
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:49,280
she was trying to buy this baby seal fat
from this random woman.

Yes.

697
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,602
So what did you do about it?

698
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,325
I ate her.

Annie, you're fired!

Thank you.

ANNIE: Are you serious?

709
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:15,360
It's not fair.

710
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,363
You... You can't fire me.
