1
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,996
In the year of King Tai, Ming Dynasty

2
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,163
The eunuches held the real power of
the development

3
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:15,402
They built up different departments
to reinforce their power

4
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,132
The whole country was under their control

5
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:22,547
East Chamber was the most powerful
and arrogant intelligent bureau

6
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,200
In order to get rid of those opposing power

7
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,164
They recruited many heartless
and cruel soldiers with high pay

8
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,836
To form a cold-blooded Black Arrow Troop

9
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,805
They were under severe training secretly

10
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,970
There was an arsenal under the East Chamber

11
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,374
It is responsible to design new
killing weapons

12
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,480
They used the prisoners for test

13
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:13,952
Let me go!

14
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,585
You shameless bastards!

15
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:16,424
God will punish you

16
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,042
Come out

17
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,209
I'm a government officer
you can't kill me

18
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,377
And you

19
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,886
Let's go

20
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,993
Plum Blossom Sun Shooting Arrow

21
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,881
Dogs Teeth Arrow

22
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,369
Phoenix Tail Arrow

23
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,313
The head Eunuch Tsao Siu Yan

24
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,014
After appointing himself
the head on the East Chamber

25
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:54,322
He controlled the Emperor
and the whole government

26
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,663
He tried every means to get rid
of those who went against him

27
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,689
What he wanted was a kingdom of himself

28
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:06,165
He set up a court and collected Information
from many different sources

29
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,198
Those who were against Tsao

30
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,835
Would be arrested and executed
with terrible punishment

31
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,447
Everybody was afraid
of the East Chamber

32
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:22,580
The whole country was covered
with frights and anxiety

33
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,559
You Excellency, he is the Military Secretary
Yang Yu-hin

34
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,887
What secret do we know about him?

35
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,298
On the 4th of April
he and the secreataries of 3 other department...

36
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,530
wanted to submit an impeachment against
the East Chamber

37
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,265
He pleaded the Emperor to close
the East Chamber

38
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,830
Your Excellency
please give your judgement

39
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,672
Your Excellency, here is his impeachment

40
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,044
Secretary Yang

41
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,070
Damn

42
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,239
You've misunderstood us

43
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:55,721
We're faithful to the Emperor

44
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,953
Your frame to us would scare our Majesty

45
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,051
Aren't you afraid of death?

46
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:06,922
It's a royal order that eunuches
aren't allowed to involve in politics

47
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:11,130
So as to avoid you freaks
to mess up the country

48
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,570
Now you slaugher the officials

49
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,301
You're the one who should be dead

50
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,608
How dare you?

51
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,540
Execution

52
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,509
Yes

53
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,178
Yang, I don't think you know
the situation well

54
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,985
Give me the military power

55
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,992
Then I'll let you live

56
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,795
It's so ridiculous that
the government of Ming dynasty

57
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,764
is controlled by you dogs

58
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:45,362
No one can take over military power
without imperial permission

59
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,305
Stop dreaming

60
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,100
Officer

61
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:55,403
Give Officer Yang a permission as he wanted

62
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:01,920
Tsao, because of you bastard

63
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,616
Ming Dynasty is hopeless

64
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,494
He committed suicide

65
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:17,068
Although Yang was dead
I'm afraid his fellows

66
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,264
would go to his right hand Chow Wai-on

67
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,431
Protect Yang's children to the frontier

68
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,376
I'm sure Chow'd try hard to save them

69
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,074
Yes, sir

70
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,673
This is the Royal Order

71
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:05,007
The traitor Ex-Military Secretary
Yang Yu-hin

72
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:10,017
Is to be executed at noon

73
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,223
Tsao Siu Yan killed
the whole family of Yang

74
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,600
but the son and daughter
of Yang were interitionally left

75
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,909
In the Autumn of the same year
they were exited

76
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:45,108
Tsao orderd the Black Arrow Troop
to tail them secretly

77
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:52,654
What he wanted was to kill
Yang's right hand, Chow Wai-on

78
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,524
So as to terminate
the remained power of Yang

79
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,319
Kiddo, are you fine?

80
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,226
What the hell it is? Not even a tree

81
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,627
It's so hot

82
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,037
My holy God, I, Yau Mo-yin
swear in front of this sword

83
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,409
I must save Yang's children

84
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,381
All is ready, let's go

85
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:30,683
Go!

86
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:48,465
To get out of the boundary
we'd pass Tsi, Turk, Hai-ku 3 places

87
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,675
You divide into 3 teams
I will give order in the central

88
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,569
They can never escape from us!

89
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,643
Your Excellency, the troops are all ready

90
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,186
What shall we do now?

91
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:24,663
From here to the boundary,
we'd pass Tsi Turk, Hai-ku 3 places

92
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,029
There are steep atopes and cliffs!

93
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,104
I think, Tsao must hide his troop here
to trap us

94
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,304
There is a dried river bed at the West

95
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,015
Let's take risk, to give him a raid

96
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,682
OK, let's go this way

97
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,253
President
nothing happened in these 3 days

98
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,889
Chow has been the right hand of Yang

99
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,456
He could be the coach of 800,000
imperial soldiers

100
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,559
Because of Yang's recommendation

101
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,231
Thus, thinking of such relationship

102
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,206
Chow would come to save the kids

103
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,612
I am thirsty

104
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,285
Drink it

105
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,624
Uncle, can you give us
something to drink?

106
00:14:58,797 --> 00:14:59,991
Get lost, get lost

107
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,527
Come over... open your hands

108
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:04,893
Thank you

109
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,734
No hurry, drink it slowly

110
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:13,836
Sister, drink it!

111
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,574
No, you drink it

112
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,857
The president really knows everything

113
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,225
Set them free, now

114
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,734
No, we can't defy government's order

115
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,134
If not, let's kill him

116
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,501
We come to save

117
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,631
But not to kill

118
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,735
If you want to kill
let's kill the dogs of the East Chamber

119
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,405
Set them free and leave with us

120
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,346
Otherwise, those bastards won't let you go

121
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,447
Stop puzzling

122
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,582
You've no choice, hurry up

123
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,124
Sister

124
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,956
Kiddo

125
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,453
Enemies

126
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,088
Protect the kids

127
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:59,875
They are small potatos only
our large hasn't shown up yet

128
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,282
Kiddo

129
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,007
Your Excellency, Chow finally comes

130
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,086
The twins Sword

131
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:28,071
Sister, I'm so scared

132
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,897
The Black Flag Arrow Troop?

133
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,196
Sister, I'm so scared

134
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,399
Sister, where are you?

135
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:07,734
Just follow me

136
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,822
The arrows are like a storm.
Save the kids and leave at once

137
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,274
Shit! The soldiers are coming towards us

138
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,693
Stay where you are

139
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,477
Your Excellency,
it wasn't Chow who came

140
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,673
They seem to be rascals

141
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,887
Brother, we are safe!

142
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,831
Chow Wai-on is such a wise man

143
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,898
The people come for the children
are trobbers only

144
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,666
Let them go first

145
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,838
I want to make a deed set at them all!

146
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,344
This is the Dragon Gate

147
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,741
I've made a date in the Dragon Inn with Chow

148
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,576
We'll leave the frontier together

149
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,589
We're carrying the kids
and the soldiers are after us

150
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,556
I think

151
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,856
We'd go to the Dragon Gate
along the river bed

152
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,492
Just do what you said

153
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,489
Yang Kwan is a main road

154
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,160
Shang, take 500 soldiers
to guard this gate

155
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,134
Yes

156
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,860
There are many lanes to Yu Mun Kwan

157
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,428
Send the best soldiers to block all exits

158
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:18,136
Although the Dragon Gate is heavily armed

159
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:22,510
I think Chow'd take this risk

160
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,947
And leave from the Dragon Gate
with the rascals

161
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,144
Go there by taking the path

162
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,346
I'll follow with the Black Flag Troop

163
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,181
It's wise of you, Your Excellency

164
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,383
Let's go

165
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,551
Yes, sir

166
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,466
Spicy Meat Bun

167
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,697
Three-taels
why don't you send me the wine?

168
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:20,636
It's coming...

169
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,196
Damn weather, the wind made me so dirty

170
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,764
Good morning, sir

171
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,606
What? You don't want to serve me?

172
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,875
No, if it's not you guarding the border

173
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,939
We can't even do business here

174
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:31,505
Fetch me some wine

175
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,983
OK, I'll go right now

176
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,789
Sir, here comes the wine

177
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,186
See, your nickname suits you well

178
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,128
Exactly 3 taels of wine per cup.
Not a drop less

179
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,626
My grandpa gave me this name

180
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,654
Spicy Meat Bun

181
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,495
Come here

182
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,659
Where is your boss?

183
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:53,933
She is dealing some business upstairs

184
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,809
You want to leave the border
through my secret tunnel...

185
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,939
Or want to sleep with me?

186
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,874
Tiger, you can only choose one of them

187
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,149
Choose carefully

188
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,417
I've made it

189
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,591
Men are all sex-oriented

190
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,758
You want it whenever you want it
and leave whenever you finish it

191
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,360
Cut the crap

192
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,069
Just relax

193
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,301
Come on

194
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,700
I want the answer, tunnel or me?

195
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,766
I want both

196
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,172
It's too greedy of you

197
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,309
I've checked it. I'm not interested at all

198
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,673
The Willow Dart?

199
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,767
I'll get 100 taels by sending you
out of the frontier

200
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:07,267
But I'll get 400 taels by sending you to hell

201
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,444
I really don't know what to choose

202
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,547
Here is fresh meat for the buns

203
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,481
The boss's coming.
We're waiting for you to extinguish our fire

204
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,985
Eating mutton will make you have more fire

205
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,384
It'll make you hot. Bastard

206
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,184
Maybe you can help us with this?

207
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,417
Damn you

208
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,818
I don't eat mutton

209
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,986
I want to eat you

210
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,254
Go to hell

211
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,064
Why not eat me? I'm bigger in size

212
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,227
Damn you

213
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,095
Who is he?

214
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,704
You're always interested in men

215
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,234
How about me?

216
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,079
I always treat you as well as I can

217
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:19,982
Good looking

218
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,146
He is Chow, a wanted criminal.
He was a coach of the Imperial Army

219
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,682
He doesn't look like a coach

220
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:28,784
Yes, he doesn't

221
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,421
He's in big trouble with
the East Chamber

222
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,795
They want his head

223
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:34,389
East Chamber?

224
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,228
Yes

225
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,392
It's nothing

226
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,133
Mind your tongue

227
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:43,202
Tiger's head worths 500 taels?

228
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,678
Meaner, ask the chef, Duo
to keep the head of the lamb

229
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,543
You just care about lamp but not me

230
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,280
How dare you do this
in front of your fellows?

231
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,119
You'll give them a bad example

232
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,516
Why is there blood on your dress?

233
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,526
No. There is no blood

234
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,925
Look

235
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:04,487
Really?

236
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,689
You're having period?

237
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,925
Haven't you seen it before?
Ask your mother then

238
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,456
She passed away long long time ago

239
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,593
Go ask your sister then

240
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,433
Come over here,
I'll teach you a good lesson

241
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:14,468
Come over here...

242
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,973
Come if you have guts

243
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,200
Damn you

244
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,653
Welcome.
How many rooms do you want?

245
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,220
We want 3 of your best

246
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,959
Okay, take a rest first

247
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,670
Your period doesn't seem to be regular

248
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,139
Tell me earlier next time

249
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,812
Time to go back, we're just here

250
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,354
May I help you, sir?

251
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,485
Thanks, I'll do it myself

252
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,189
This way please, this is clean

253
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,701
With less wind and sand

254
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,328
What do you want to eat?

255
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,998
Give us some bread

256
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,234
Why not some wine?

257
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,940
OK, give us 3 catties

258
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,705
I'll get it now

259
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,546
Listen

260
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,483
This is my place, everything is mine

261
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,509
If you violate the rules

262
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,350
You can never
trade your pilfered goods here again

263
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,378
Damn you

264
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,949
I'll do it

265
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,255
The Dragon Mountain is famous for its rain

266
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,559
Why?

267
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,064
How can it rain in such a sunny day?

268
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,834
I think you're a stranger here

269
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,140
Where are you from?

270
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,837
We came from the south

271
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,147
To the north

272
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,077
How long will you stay?

273
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,609
We'll leave tomorrow

274
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:12,311
Spicy meat buns...

275
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,749
Beautiful

276
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,319
How sweet of you

277
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,490
We don't know where they are from

278
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,966
Watch out for them

279
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,630
One is soldier, one is wounded

280
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,503
The one in black should be their leader

281
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,935
- She's a woman
- A woman?

282
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,544
I can tell she is female because...

283
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,102
She didn't show interest in me

284
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,374
There is something wrong with the meat

285
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,079
Don't eat

286
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,178
What is it?

287
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,622
There is something wrong anyway

288
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,528
Not showing respect

289
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,352
Go

290
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,382
Let's go

291
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,066
Do you have any medicine?

292
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,161
No

293
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,938
It's getting dark. Light up the candles

294
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,909
Mistress, what meat is it?

295
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,279
Spicy Meat

296
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,840
What is spicy meat?

297
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,876
Haven't you heard of it?

298
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,219
The name of spicy meat appeared in a novel.
Mrs Suen sold it

299
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,226
Mrs Suen opened an inn which robbed

300
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,388
But mine is Dragon Inn

301
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,023
But you don't look like a jinx

302
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,795
Really? My name is Jade King

303
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:08,636
What a pity that it's hard for
a stone to turn to jade

304
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,698
In this world

305
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,540
There're many things unworthy of the name

306
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,843
and many people got empty brains

307
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,579
You're pretty

308
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,367
You too

309
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:24,100
But I'm sure I know you better

310
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,920
So you should let me know you better

311
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,704
I don't think it's a big deal actually

312
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,677
Why not ask some men here
that'd be fun

313
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,704
What! You think I'm afraid of men?

314
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:07,149
I've messed with more men than
you've seen

315
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,450
Just look at you, you're still a virgin

316
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,319
Aren't you?

317
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:28,004
Where is the hen hurrying to?

318
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,529
Let's see how you light up
a candle on the roof

319
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,316
Who are you? Why are you laughing?

320
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,772
May I know where the Dragon Inn is?

321
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,810
Here it is

322
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:13,914
Are you the boss?

323
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,475
Just call me Jade King

324
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,888
Jade! What a good name

325
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,480
Beautiful name

326
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,491
How about me?

327
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,716
Any room?

328
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,654
Handsome guy

329
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,628
Are you a businessman?

330
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,998
I want a room

331
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,701
How long will you stay?

332
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,365
Do I look like I've no money?

333
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,567
I'm just afraid that
you'll leave without saying goodbye

334
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,539
You know,
Dragon Mountain is famous for its rain

335
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:46,477
Even the most
vigorous animal scares of it

336
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,647
So we're the same people
we should keep in touch

337
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:57,522
Glad to make friends with you.
I may need your help some day

338
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,228
It depends on how smart you are

339
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,694
Miss Yau

340
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,571
He is here

341
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,109
This is my inn, please make yourself at home

342
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,545
Wearing foreign dress for
foreign customers tonight?

343
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,209
I've told you to wash that flag

344
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,740
See, I got mud all over me

345
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,912
This must be a woman

346
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,818
How do you know?

347
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,757
As you said
only women won't be interested in you

348
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,193
But he is different

349
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,697
His eyes didn't show interest on me
but his heart did

350
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,201
I don't think his heart
is interested in you

351
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,437
I can listen to your flute again

352
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,602
Go to work

353
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,405
Don't just play that song

354
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,682
Uncle Chow

355
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,451
Poor kids, you suffered a lot

356
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,321
He is Ho Fu

357
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:40,219
Thank you for your help

358
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,288
I really appreciate for all your kindness

359
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,321
Don't mention it

360
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,389
This is called Dog's teeth Arrow

361
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:14,762
It's produced by the East Chamber

362
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,597
I'd seen when I worked for the government

363
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:21,002
So you'd better pay much attention
to it in future

364
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,401
When can we get out of here?

365
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,965
As soon as possible

366
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,574
Chun, take the money

367
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,479
Hide up and meet your family later

368
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,244
Sir, I can't take this

369
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:37,380
This inn is so complicated

370
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,049
Pack up and leave here
as soon as possible

371
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,036
Mistress

372
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,269
I know you will come

373
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,866
You're really clever

374
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,038
I don't need you to flatter me

375
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,480
I just want to know about the weather here

376
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,948
Come inside

377
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,887
This room is nice and quiet

378
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:18,862
No room is nice
in a deserted place like this

379
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,788
What tea do you want to have?

380
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,665
Tuckanhoe or something else?

381
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,407
What kind of flower is this?
It's beautiful

382
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,404
You think it's white lotus?
It's turnip flower

383
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,111
White lotus can only be found
on Snow Mountain

384
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,382
Try the tea

385
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,219
When will you leave?

386
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,221
Tonight

387
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,261
I'm afraid you can't

388
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,329
Why?

389
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,890
Don't you know
the weather of the desert?

390
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,368
Please advise me

391
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:03,334
This's raining season
the weather is unpredictable

392
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:09,142
It'll rain cats and dogs even
the sun is on

393
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,774
This's the only hotel here

394
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,248
You can't reach the gate even
you can leave here

395
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:22,119
I think you know
whether it's sunny or rainy day

396
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,485
It depends on who that asks

397
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:32,135
The rain'll keep you here
just stay for a few more days

398
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:36,305
Though the weather is unpredictable
we can't stay forever

399
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,140
Seems we're connected in some ways

400
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,809
Please help us

401
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:50,786
You're leaving?

402
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:57,453
- I've two children with me
- They're hostages?

403
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,262
Mistress, please lead us the way

404
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,163
It depends on which way you want to take

405
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:13,066
The general of the border is my friend

406
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:17,437
I think I can help you with my reputation

407
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,939
But if you want to leave secretly...

408
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,158
Let me think...

409
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,598
I'm okay. Weapons are ruthless

410
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:40,061
We're friends now. And I'll repay you

411
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,406
Come again tonight

412
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,610
I have to leave tonight

413
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:55,943
You can't. I'll wait

414
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,025
Block the gate

415
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,898
Damn you. Fool

416
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,632
The latch is useless, move the table

417
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,975
Open the door...

418
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,308
Who is it? We just closed the door

419
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,442
Don't open it, let him die in the rain

420
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:28,943
Open up, quick

421
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,181
Stop knocking, bastard

422
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,587
If you knock again, I'll...

423
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,359
What's the matter?

424
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,355
Are you deaf?

425
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,097
Why didn't you open the door?

426
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,405
We're in trouble

427
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,498
3 branch heads from
the East Chamber have come

428
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,267
Damn you

429
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,472
My books are all wet!

430
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,814
Are you blind? Just close the door!

431
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:02,243
Go and shut the door

432
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,480
Boss

433
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,845
He is calling you

434
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,048
Can't you see I'm busy?

435
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,527
Any good room?

436
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,128
No, all full

437
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,595
Please ask them to move out

438
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:22,569
I just do whatever I like

439
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:23,573
Not tall enough

440
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,842
I don't do things I don't like

441
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,845
Take it back

442
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,368
You bitch

443
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:30,744
What did you say?

444
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,242
Money isn't my concern

445
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,618
Most important of all
I want a comfortable accommodation

446
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,015
I'm doing business too

447
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,217
I don't care about the money

448
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,691
You've messed up my place

449
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,988
So what to do then?

450
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:47,929
Count the loss

451
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,331
And I'll pay you by triple?

452
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:59,200
Good room? There is one, come on

453
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,676
It is raining cats and dogs
we can't leave now

454
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,407
We'll wait

455
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,346
Take the luggage in

456
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,824
We have limited rooms but numerous guests

457
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,622
How long will you stay?

458
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,419
The weather is unpredictable

459
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,364
See how long can this gold pay for?

460
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,400
You must be tired

461
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,407
Sir, please have some tea

462
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:35,003
Any strangers checked in these days?

463
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,139
Are you looking for someone?

464
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:41,281
We businessmen should be careful
and get rid of trouble

465
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,885
I just want to know
if there is any trouble around

466
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,213
Have some tea

467
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,423
If there is any, I won't open an inn here

468
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,227
Sorry

469
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,299
This is a very special tea

470
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,870
The taste is nothing special

471
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,805
But you have something special
on your mind

472
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,684
Don't you think Chow Wai On
will take this route?

473
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,589
Go and check

474
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,680
Meaner...

475
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:45,977
Boss

476
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,677
Why you acted before my order?

477
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,083
Shadows are found everywhere

478
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,416
But they're not our men

479
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,285
We haven't taken any action yet

480
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,290
Go and check carefully.
Watch out for the money box

481
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,291
Yes

482
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,389
What a troubled world it is

483
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,486
Thieves'd watch out for other thieves.
Damn it

484
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,107
What is he singing?

485
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,381
He is barbarian.
He is humming barbarian song

486
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,059
I'll dig your eyes out

487
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,693
So you can't see

488
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,934
I'll peel off your skin
so you can't wear

489
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,874
I'll chop your head off
so you can't live

490
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,315
Don't make any trouble

491
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:58,813
Somebody is on the roof

492
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,225
Forget it

493
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,124
We'll leave right after the rain stops

494
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:10,831
Who was killed by the thunder?

495
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,426
We are all here

496
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,394
Good job! Kill your tribe

497
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,568
Thank god

498
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,003
Where are Bill Chow and Shao Tong?

499
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,539
I'll go and find them

500
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:28,215
No! It'll alarm our enemies

501
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,653
The rain is so heavy, we can't leave

502
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:32,746
Neither can they

503
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,779
Right

504
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:46,635
Look at the sword under the lamp
after drunk...

505
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,872
When can we live in peace?

506
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,091
I don't want to wait anymore!

507
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,329
Just stay calm

508
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,625
Anxiety won't help

509
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:48,653
But waitng won't help either

510
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,257
Lower your voice

511
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,962
If the eunuches come
we'll be in danger

512
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,731
What'll we do
if we are trapped in this inn?

513
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,635
Ho, I didn't pay a penny less

514
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,469
There are rules that
we all should follow

515
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:01,273
Miss Yau, my buddies and I...

516
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,801
make money by risking our lives

517
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,541
To save this two kids...

518
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,549
we've missed many business opportunity

519
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,175
and money

520
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,618
Now the government knows who we are

521
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,582
Damn, we've given all
we have to be a good guy

522
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,622
Well, I'll pay your loss

523
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:17,885
It sounds reasonable

524
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:22,523
Make it clean

525
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:24,536
Sir, did you sleep well last night?

526
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,434
Bull shit

527
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,233
Have a seat

528
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:29,297
- Shun, clean the tables and chairs
- Yes

529
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,732
Give us some tea

530
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:35,838
Still didn't get any news
from Bill Chow and Shao Tong?

531
00:48:35,881 --> 00:48:39,078
It's strange!
We can't even find their bodies

532
00:48:41,553 --> 00:48:44,317
There must be something strange

533
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,021
Tony, give them some bread

534
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:49,054
We don't want bread this morning

535
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:50,459
Give us a roasted lamb

536
00:48:50,629 --> 00:48:51,459
Roasted lamb

537
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:53,487
- Do you have roasted lamb in desert?
- Yes

538
00:48:53,532 --> 00:48:57,332
They're fat lambs!
We just killed two last night

539
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:59,164
Give us one

540
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:01,295
You too? Ok, coming...

541
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:15,679
The fight last night was tiring enough

542
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:16,983
And now we've to work this morning

543
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:18,144
Go and get the weapons

544
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,888
You are good looking

545
00:49:20,926 --> 00:49:22,951
From your forehead

546
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:25,327
There is florid

547
00:49:25,364 --> 00:49:27,628
I can tell you're having good luck

548
00:49:28,634 --> 00:49:30,431
Thank you.
Hope your fortune telling comes true

549
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:34,965
If you don't mind,
can I see your hands?

550
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:37,237
Sure

551
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:42,503
From your influence line

552
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:44,947
you were a government officer 2 years ago

553
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:47,315
What're you working now?

554
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,010
Anywhere! When there is rough road
I'd make it flat

555
00:49:50,222 --> 00:49:53,783
When there is tree blocking the road
I'd remove it

556
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:58,622
That's why
your influence line isn't that smooth

557
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:03,093
I don't think I've the luck
to be gov't official, but I think you have

558
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,830
Why?

559
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,531
In such a desert

560
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:09,506
Ordinary citizens won't wear
officer's boots

561
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:19,748
Don't be nervous! You're an officer

562
00:50:19,785 --> 00:50:23,050
So you should know
something happened in town

563
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:24,848
Which one are you talking about?

564
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:29,082
The Secretary
of the Military Dept. Yang was killed

565
00:50:29,428 --> 00:50:34,695
His corpse was hanged and his
whole family was killed too

566
00:50:34,733 --> 00:50:39,067
Pal, do you know who did it?

567
00:50:39,338 --> 00:50:43,001
I don't know

568
00:50:43,342 --> 00:50:44,832
Really?

569
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:49,770
The water is boiling

570
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:55,818
Sir... oh no...

571
00:50:55,954 --> 00:50:57,114
Mister

572
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:59,952
Can you tell me is he a lady killer?

573
00:51:00,192 --> 00:51:04,185
Yes! His eyes attract women

574
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:05,093
Really?

575
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:10,129
The ones who killed Yang

576
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:13,365
are some ruthless bastards

577
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:21,405
It's hot, let it cool down

578
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,047
Mistress

579
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:27,415
This is for the broken table.
Buy a new one

580
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:30,154
I don't think it's enough

581
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:33,021
Give us the food! We're starving!

582
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:44,702
Pal, you are a man
of righteousness and guts

583
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:46,636
May I know your name?

584
00:51:47,072 --> 00:51:50,940
I'm a wanderer, name is meaningless to me

585
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:55,311
Let's cheers for this nameless world

586
00:51:55,614 --> 00:51:59,175
OK! I'll drink this wine with you!
Cheers!

587
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:00,445
- Please
- Please

588
00:52:07,926 --> 00:52:09,689
Here's the roasted lamb

589
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:16,224
Mistress, how about our lamb?

590
00:52:19,771 --> 00:52:22,035
It'd be roasted one by one

591
00:52:22,074 --> 00:52:23,541
But first come first serve

592
00:52:25,844 --> 00:52:27,971
Make it half then

593
00:52:28,013 --> 00:52:30,538
Dao

594
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:39,553
Cut the lamb in half

595
00:52:40,492 --> 00:52:41,959
How? Straight or cross?

596
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:44,791
As you like, just make it half

597
00:53:16,828 --> 00:53:19,422
I wonder what relationship Chow has
with this inn?

598
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:20,761
I think we'd better take action
as soon as possilble

599
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:24,097
Let's ambush them tonight

600
00:53:32,144 --> 00:53:34,544
Bravo! The rain has stopped!
We may go now

601
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,570
Don't panic, they will discover it easily

602
00:53:38,517 --> 00:53:39,984
The larget is so great

603
00:53:40,018 --> 00:53:42,350
We are not clear about the outside world

604
00:53:42,521 --> 00:53:46,013
We have 2 kids too.
We can't go as fast as they can

605
00:53:46,992 --> 00:53:50,758
Once this inn is owned by thieves
there must be some secret tunnel

606
00:53:51,196 --> 00:53:53,061
Let's search it tonight

607
00:53:58,403 --> 00:53:59,734
It was dangerous!

608
00:54:00,872 --> 00:54:04,239
Quickly I fixed up the mess
otherwise I'd have lost if there're a fight

609
00:54:04,276 --> 00:54:06,574
No, some hocus is put!

610
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:07,771
Drink this

611
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:09,243
Tonight, why no we...

612
00:54:09,281 --> 00:54:10,612
What shall we do tonight?

613
00:54:11,783 --> 00:54:12,511
What?

614
00:54:12,551 --> 00:54:14,917
You are all fools!

615
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:19,883
If we want to leave here

616
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:22,357
We must get rid of those bastards first

617
00:54:22,527 --> 00:54:27,328
Ho Fu, Iron, you two'll attack
from both sides

618
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:29,390
Mo-yan will attack in the midle

619
00:54:29,568 --> 00:54:33,231
Cha's room is at the corner
and has just one door

620
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:35,796
Okay, let me do it

621
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:39,937
Mr Chow, have you fallen asleep?

622
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:42,903
I come to serve you

623
00:55:53,585 --> 00:55:55,883
Jade, why do you come here
in the middle of the night?

624
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,356
Why do you come here then?

625
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:01,121
Stop bothering my business

626
00:56:03,328 --> 00:56:05,455
This is my inn

627
00:56:05,497 --> 00:56:08,830
Who'll responsible for it
if someone get killed here?

628
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:11,696
But there were many people got killed
in this inn before

629
00:56:12,404 --> 00:56:18,274
I tell you, I know your story very well

630
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:21,211
Don't push me to make a dead set at you

631
00:56:25,784 --> 00:56:27,274
What are you?

632
00:56:27,319 --> 00:56:29,184
Officers and thieves have their own ways

633
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,916
And our own duties

634
00:56:32,624 --> 00:56:35,184
But I'd ask your help

635
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,122
How?

636
00:56:37,162 --> 00:56:40,188
Be frank, they are kidnappers

637
00:56:40,532 --> 00:56:42,796
That's none of my business

638
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:44,491
$1000 taels, deal or not?

639
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:45,736
To kill him?

640
00:56:46,004 --> 00:56:49,770
No, just delay them.
Make them stay one more night

641
00:56:49,941 --> 00:56:53,934
And forget everything, what say you?

642
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:55,070
Guess

643
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,247
Fantastic

644
00:57:00,285 --> 00:57:01,912
Promised?

645
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:10,820
If you can't sleep, get something to eat

646
00:58:13,992 --> 00:58:14,754
Sister

647
00:58:14,793 --> 00:58:15,851
Take care of the kids

648
00:58:31,476 --> 00:58:33,341
Where is Uncle Chow?

649
00:58:33,645 --> 00:58:34,577
It's fine

650
00:58:38,917 --> 00:58:40,179
Yuk Bo

651
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:30,289
You went for a walk so late?
It's freezing

652
00:59:30,335 --> 00:59:33,099
- Here is too hot
- Hot?

653
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:35,196
But I feel cold! Am I so sick?

654
00:59:57,795 --> 00:59:59,922
The logner we stay
the more danger we'll have

655
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:01,488
We can't wait

656
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,128
Let's take a risk! Go!

657
01:00:04,502 --> 01:00:07,164
Ho Hu, Iron
I'll stop the enemies with Mo-yan

658
01:00:07,205 --> 01:00:08,399
Just take the kids away

659
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:09,630
We'll meet at the Dragon Gate

660
01:00:09,674 --> 01:00:12,575
Wai-on, cover them

661
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,577
Leave the inn to me

662
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:14,373
Mo-yan

663
01:00:14,412 --> 01:00:15,436
Who is it?

664
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,512
Chun

665
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:18,980
- Brother Ho
- Come in

666
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:20,549
Miss Yau

667
01:00:20,585 --> 01:00:22,348
Chun, don't worry

668
01:00:22,387 --> 01:00:24,150
We'll protect you

669
01:00:25,557 --> 01:00:26,524
Mo-yan

670
01:00:26,658 --> 01:00:29,354
Wai-on, take care of Yang's kids

671
01:00:30,495 --> 01:00:31,427
Wait

672
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:40,827
Can I have this flute?

673
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,966
Don't waste time

674
01:01:17,008 --> 01:01:18,066
The rabbit in the trap is always
anxious to escape

675
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:19,406
But it can never make it

676
01:01:19,444 --> 01:01:20,172
Yes

677
01:01:26,384 --> 01:01:29,649
We'd move this time!
My inn would be jacked up

678
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:31,245
Pack up now

679
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:32,682
No matter how, we'd move

680
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:36,226
Damn it

681
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,023
Why do you shut the door?

682
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:40,053
Don't you know the wind is killing me?

683
01:01:40,365 --> 01:01:41,297
No business today?

684
01:01:43,034 --> 01:01:44,296
Thank god! Our savior comes

685
01:01:48,573 --> 01:01:49,904
Don't let them fish in the trouble water

686
01:01:49,941 --> 01:01:51,932
Just tail them

687
01:01:57,281 --> 01:01:58,646
Thank god

688
01:01:58,683 --> 01:02:00,583
You bring us peace

689
01:02:00,618 --> 01:02:02,176
Even fire has to go off

690
01:02:02,487 --> 01:02:03,977
What peace?

691
01:02:04,022 --> 01:02:05,649
There is sand-storm outside

692
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,180
You said there was a fire?

693
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:08,817
Here! Here!

694
01:02:08,993 --> 01:02:09,960
Where is it?

695
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:10,688
Here

696
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:11,285
Where is the fire?

697
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:13,957
What were you doing?
You should smell it!

698
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,657
Damn it! Can you see the fire?

699
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:18,032
I want them to show up

700
01:02:18,836 --> 01:02:19,598
What's wrong?

701
01:02:22,974 --> 01:02:23,963
Who are you?

702
01:02:24,008 --> 01:02:25,669
Why do you bring so many weapons?

703
01:02:25,877 --> 01:02:27,310
For business

704
01:02:27,345 --> 01:02:28,710
Trade with knives?

705
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:33,445
Sir, businessmen should be careful

706
01:02:33,484 --> 01:02:36,419
In this troubled world
we've to protect ourselves

707
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:41,885
You look familiar

708
01:02:41,926 --> 01:02:43,587
Who are you?

709
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,195
I'm talking to you

710
01:02:48,566 --> 01:02:49,396
Sir

711
01:02:52,003 --> 01:02:53,971
Watch the opera
we don't have to do anything

712
01:02:54,005 --> 01:02:55,734
Just wait and see

713
01:02:55,907 --> 01:02:57,465
Where are you from?

714
01:02:57,508 --> 01:02:59,635
Are you the general guarding the border?

715
01:02:59,811 --> 01:03:02,405
How dare you talk to me like this?

716
01:03:02,447 --> 01:03:04,438
We are...

717
01:03:05,183 --> 01:03:06,548
Secret agents from the East Chamber

718
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:09,045
This is our identity proof

719
01:03:10,221 --> 01:03:11,449
It's confidential

720
01:03:14,025 --> 01:03:15,890
Our identity proof

721
01:03:16,094 --> 01:03:17,083
Damn it

722
01:03:17,528 --> 01:03:20,122
We become thieves in return

723
01:03:23,468 --> 01:03:24,992
Where are you going to?

724
01:03:25,036 --> 01:03:26,503
Going out of the border

725
01:03:27,105 --> 01:03:31,132
Don't you know the gate is closed?

726
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:33,439
No one can get out without the order

727
01:03:33,478 --> 01:03:35,969
from the President of the East Chamber

728
01:03:37,448 --> 01:03:38,506
I know

729
01:03:40,418 --> 01:03:43,979
You look like
the wanted criminal Chow Wai-on

730
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:45,783
You look almost the same

731
01:03:47,258 --> 01:03:48,885
You should be him...

732
01:03:49,127 --> 01:03:50,788
I don't think so

733
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:54,457
Look! There is a mold on the man's face

734
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:56,064
But he hasn't

735
01:03:57,602 --> 01:04:01,003
But I don't remember there's any mold

736
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:05,771
Look at that guy
he has a mold when he came

737
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,141
Now, only a scar is left

738
01:04:10,114 --> 01:04:12,480
Look, they pretend to be calm

739
01:04:12,517 --> 01:04:14,576
You can tell there is something wrong
with them

740
01:04:14,619 --> 01:04:17,087
Take them to your camps for questioning

741
01:04:17,755 --> 01:04:20,815
Maybe they're the people we want

742
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:23,759
If you get any merit from it
don't forget us

743
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:27,063
Sure

744
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:31,498
You, come over here

745
01:04:31,536 --> 01:04:33,367
The one with a scar

746
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:35,697
Hey, I'm talking to you!

747
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:41,276
Why do you stare at me?

748
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:42,677
Not happy with it?

749
01:04:46,651 --> 01:04:49,313
You are just like a thief

750
01:04:49,353 --> 01:04:51,480
And you're a businessman?

751
01:04:51,522 --> 01:04:52,921
You can never cheat me

752
01:04:53,191 --> 01:04:56,024
Don't get angry, it's their trick

753
01:04:56,294 --> 01:04:58,455
I don't like you since the first time
I saw you

754
01:04:59,764 --> 01:05:01,629
Take them to the camp

755
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:02,360
Yes, sir

756
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,492
Drink with me

757
01:05:03,935 --> 01:05:04,799
Go

758
01:05:04,836 --> 01:05:06,030
You two get up

759
01:05:06,671 --> 01:05:08,662
They are all here

760
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,370
Watch over the general.
I'll look for another exit

761
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:14,541
Three taels, give me wine

762
01:05:14,712 --> 01:05:16,839
Sir, take care...

763
01:05:17,014 --> 01:05:18,948
The reward from
the government is just $1000 taels

764
01:05:18,983 --> 01:05:21,178
See, these cheques cost $1,000 taels each

765
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,588
I'm a reasonable man

766
01:05:26,224 --> 01:05:27,589
Drop the knife

767
01:05:27,792 --> 01:05:31,353
There is trouble in the frontier.
No one can go in or go out

768
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:33,886
You'd better stay few more days

769
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:36,729
When the order is cancelled
I'll let you go

770
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,927
Thank you, sir

771
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:39,231
You'll have a share too

772
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,237
Let's drink

773
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,964
Chow Wai-on disappeared

774
01:05:45,376 --> 01:05:46,536
Lu Siu Chuen

775
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:40,859
Sir, he doesn't seem to be here

776
01:06:46,804 --> 01:06:48,362
Dao, the stuff is here

777
01:07:24,442 --> 01:07:26,103
It is the first time...

778
01:07:26,844 --> 01:07:27,811
you stare at me like this

779
01:07:27,845 --> 01:07:28,834
Boss

780
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:32,274
Go

781
01:07:38,189 --> 01:07:39,679
He came from the secret passage

782
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:46,329
If you are willing to stare at me
because of the passage

783
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,723
How about I open all the passages...

784
01:07:48,766 --> 01:07:51,234
So you can stare at me for
the rest of your life

785
01:07:53,371 --> 01:07:56,033
You're in this business for
such a long time

786
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:58,132
You should know what I want

787
01:08:00,144 --> 01:08:02,078
and I like most

788
01:08:02,847 --> 01:08:05,315
I want to buy a road to leave the country

789
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:07,010
I'll offer $1,000 taels

790
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:08,211
$1,000 taels?

791
01:08:08,853 --> 01:08:11,822
If I want $1,000 taels
I wouldn't have added the...

792
01:08:13,891 --> 01:08:15,518
So you don't want money

793
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,427
No

794
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:20,052
I want $2,000 taels

795
01:08:21,065 --> 01:08:22,760
and you

796
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:27,062
What? Scared?

797
01:08:31,809 --> 01:08:34,835
Hero always goes with beauty

798
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,109
But I do want to try...

799
01:08:38,382 --> 01:08:39,872
a special one like you

800
01:08:40,217 --> 01:08:41,115
But on one condition

801
01:08:41,152 --> 01:08:41,982
What is it?

802
01:08:42,019 --> 01:08:43,919
I want a formal wedding

803
01:08:47,224 --> 01:08:49,317
What? Scared?

804
01:08:50,528 --> 01:08:54,020
Forget it!
I just want to have one night stand

805
01:08:55,433 --> 01:08:58,869
I'm a righteous man

806
01:08:58,903 --> 01:09:00,336
Sleeping with you...

807
01:09:00,371 --> 01:09:02,931
may bring me a notorious name

808
01:09:05,643 --> 01:09:07,110
OK, let's have formal wedding

809
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:08,338
I'll take this as present

810
01:09:08,379 --> 01:09:09,346
Give it back to me

811
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:12,045
Come on, go ahead

812
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:15,177
Move your hand downward
then we'll save the wedding

813
01:09:15,486 --> 01:09:16,783
Come on

814
01:09:18,189 --> 01:09:20,851
I'll take it back on our wedding

815
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:42,910
Your Excellency,
we'll be at Dragon Gate soon

816
01:09:45,616 --> 01:09:47,516
A wedding? Do you mean it?

817
01:09:47,818 --> 01:09:50,651
Jade's secret tunnel is
the only way out

818
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:52,918
Only you believe her

819
01:09:53,357 --> 01:09:55,052
I don't trust that bitch

820
01:09:55,893 --> 01:09:57,724
You are a triad member too

821
01:09:59,096 --> 01:10:01,587
We can be brothers

822
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:03,259
So why can't I trust her?

823
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:05,862
Dragon Inn is a place
only talks about interests

824
01:10:05,903 --> 01:10:09,031
It has its own way to survive in a desert

825
01:10:09,073 --> 01:10:12,372
The wedding is to confuse the East Chamber

826
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:15,276
I want Cha to be the master of
the wedding so as to hinder their act

827
01:10:15,813 --> 01:10:19,180
Then I'll force Jade to tell me
where the tunnel is

828
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:21,684
When you see I put the candle on the sill

829
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:23,050
you all rush our from both sides

830
01:10:23,087 --> 01:10:24,850
Mo-yan'll take the kids to Jade's room

831
01:10:25,856 --> 01:10:28,723
Then we'll escort Jade to lead us
out of here

832
01:10:28,993 --> 01:10:30,893
There is no righteousness in politics

833
01:10:30,928 --> 01:10:32,395
Mo-yan, do you understand?

834
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:36,628
How can a man come out
after entering the bride's room?

835
01:10:38,636 --> 01:10:40,501
Don't you think...

836
01:10:40,538 --> 01:10:42,938
I'll give you all up for having sex?

837
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:46,709
Just follow his instruction

838
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:51,576
Even Miss Yau can't understand him

839
01:10:52,783 --> 01:10:56,913
The more confused we are,
the easier it goes

840
01:10:58,489 --> 01:10:59,979
Dragon Inn

841
01:11:00,391 --> 01:11:03,224
I hope I won't see you here again

842
01:11:34,892 --> 01:11:36,189
How is it going on outside?

843
01:11:36,227 --> 01:11:37,353
The set has almost done

844
01:11:39,163 --> 01:11:40,630
Did the geanny promise?

845
01:11:41,832 --> 01:11:43,265
There won't be any problem!

846
01:11:43,534 --> 01:11:45,593
Of course!

847
01:11:45,803 --> 01:11:47,998
Just only you stay...

848
01:11:48,038 --> 01:11:50,836
The granny will promise anything

849
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:54,469
How can I be the master of wedding?

850
01:11:54,511 --> 01:11:56,103
If it's not your reminder
on the other day...

851
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:57,909
I can never marry Jade

852
01:11:58,115 --> 01:11:59,082
You deserve it

853
01:11:59,283 --> 01:12:01,683
Right, their parents are not here

854
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:02,913
and you are old enough...

855
01:12:02,953 --> 01:12:03,681
You're the only choice

856
01:12:07,358 --> 01:12:10,759
Okay, I'll do it

857
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:12,426
Congratulation

858
01:12:12,463 --> 01:12:13,555
Thank you

859
01:12:13,597 --> 01:12:14,655
Today is my wedding

860
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:17,565
Enjoy yourselves and let's get drunk!

861
01:12:17,601 --> 01:12:18,898
Make yourselves at home

862
01:12:21,605 --> 01:12:23,800
You men look sad

863
01:12:24,742 --> 01:12:26,676
Give a speech

864
01:12:27,611 --> 01:12:31,911
I've been a homeless
and lonely businessman before

865
01:12:31,949 --> 01:12:36,511
I'm so glad to be a match maker
in a desert

866
01:12:36,553 --> 01:12:38,248
I really feel honored

867
01:12:41,025 --> 01:12:42,617
Why are you standing here?

868
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,651
Today is Jade's wedding

869
01:12:44,695 --> 01:12:46,060
Why don't you congratulate them?

870
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:47,063
Smile

871
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:57,499
I know it's nosy of me...

872
01:12:57,541 --> 01:13:00,009
but it's hard to find a good man

873
01:13:00,344 --> 01:13:01,606
If you find one...

874
01:13:01,645 --> 01:13:04,614
just keep him by any means

875
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:10,413
Perfect couple

876
01:13:10,454 --> 01:13:14,049
They're made for each other

877
01:13:18,595 --> 01:13:20,324
Great! Have my toast

878
01:13:20,364 --> 01:13:22,332
Don't get drunk on this big day

879
01:13:22,366 --> 01:13:23,924
But it's a big day! We should get drunk

880
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,832
Sir, don't drink any wine
that is not ours

881
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:27,063
It may be poisoned

882
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,401
Cheers

883
01:13:31,442 --> 01:13:32,340
Fine

884
01:13:33,477 --> 01:13:35,035
Great!

885
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:38,074
Go to the bride's room.
Don't let them delay us

886
01:13:49,827 --> 01:13:50,759
What are you doing?

887
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:51,954
Going to bed so early?

888
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:53,724
It's good time

889
01:13:53,764 --> 01:13:54,822
We want to play with the couples

890
01:13:54,865 --> 01:13:58,392
If you can defeat me, I'll let you go in

891
01:13:58,435 --> 01:13:59,902
OK! Come on

892
01:14:00,738 --> 01:14:04,196
It's a big day, don't fight

893
01:14:04,241 --> 01:14:05,469
Let's drink

894
01:14:05,843 --> 01:14:06,935
Give us wine

895
01:14:08,312 --> 01:14:10,780
Sir, it doesn't matter

896
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:14,375
We've more men! We are having advantage

897
01:14:15,953 --> 01:14:17,818
Water is filled into these 2 pots

898
01:14:17,855 --> 01:14:18,787
Don't worry, you won't get drunk

899
01:14:18,956 --> 01:14:20,287
Let's make it five

900
01:14:22,092 --> 01:14:25,425
Don't waste time.
Tell me where the tunnel is

901
01:14:25,596 --> 01:14:28,360
Light the candle first

902
01:14:30,601 --> 01:14:32,296
But in case you're fooling me...

903
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:34,698
Here it is

904
01:14:36,507 --> 01:14:38,407
See if you are capable to go in

905
01:14:38,442 --> 01:14:40,535
Mr Ngai, the 4th one

906
01:14:42,946 --> 01:14:43,640
The last one

907
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:52,354
Tell me now

908
01:14:52,523 --> 01:14:53,990
It's not funny to fool you

909
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:57,225
Do you have weapons on your wedding?

910
01:15:01,598 --> 01:15:02,860
Where is my flute?

911
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:04,801
Search it

912
01:15:08,172 --> 01:15:09,400
Baldy, cheers

913
01:15:10,574 --> 01:15:13,202
Ok! Let's finish a pot each

914
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:31,651
Useless! Get lost

915
01:15:57,087 --> 01:15:58,019
Come on

916
01:16:02,226 --> 01:16:03,386
Be careful

917
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,288
Come on

918
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,064
I have brought some fruits for you

919
01:16:21,645 --> 01:16:22,475
Thank you

920
01:16:24,081 --> 01:16:25,048
Thank you

921
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:29,385
Isn't it delicious?

922
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,983
The moon is beautiful tonight

923
01:16:35,025 --> 01:16:36,356
Sister, tell me why...

924
01:16:36,393 --> 01:16:39,692
it's not the same moon as in our hometown?

925
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:42,757
Mom said the moon
is always more beautiful in hometown

926
01:16:42,799 --> 01:16:44,994
So this is less beautiful than
the one in our hometown

927
01:16:45,269 --> 01:16:47,794
But, we have no home now!

928
01:16:47,838 --> 01:16:49,465
We can see the moon here safely

929
01:16:49,506 --> 01:16:51,633
it's the mercy of God indeed

930
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:54,103
How do you feel this place?

931
01:16:55,479 --> 01:16:58,380
Good, cause you are so kind
to treat me fruit!

932
01:16:58,682 --> 01:16:59,740
Come and eat together

933
01:17:03,487 --> 01:17:05,546
There may be some changes

934
01:17:05,689 --> 01:17:07,122
If anything goes wrong, I'll drop the cup

935
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,527
Once you get this signal, take action

936
01:17:15,566 --> 01:17:17,830
Think some ways to send me out

937
01:17:18,402 --> 01:17:19,426
Sure

938
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:21,562
But not tonight

939
01:17:23,907 --> 01:17:26,239
This is the only chance, I must go

940
01:17:27,778 --> 01:17:31,179
I tell you, once stepping in my room

941
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:34,479
you have to listen to me

942
01:17:34,518 --> 01:17:35,780
I say yes, then yes

943
01:17:42,092 --> 01:17:43,616
Jade, please help me

944
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,025
I'll marry you when I return

945
01:17:45,062 --> 01:17:46,154
So we won't owe each other

946
01:17:46,496 --> 01:17:48,157
Haven't you fooled me enough?

947
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:06,648
Sir, the President's army will
arrive soon

948
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:18,556
Miss Yau, this is water, not wine

949
01:18:19,229 --> 01:18:21,789
Forget me, just watch out for the signal

950
01:18:25,769 --> 01:18:27,293
They seem to be serious

951
01:18:27,337 --> 01:18:28,201
I think so

952
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:31,605
Cut the crap! We've bet our lives on it

953
01:18:34,745 --> 01:18:37,578
You're a man of the world

954
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:42,384
Inform me once you get any news

955
01:18:47,457 --> 01:18:49,288
There is a secret passage in Jade's room

956
01:18:49,326 --> 01:18:51,351
Chow'll leave through this tonight

957
01:18:52,562 --> 01:18:54,120
He's smart

958
01:18:54,164 --> 01:18:55,688
No one can leave here

959
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:59,432
How about going up there and check?

960
01:18:59,469 --> 01:18:59,992
Will it help?

961
01:19:00,037 --> 01:19:02,164
Check? Okay

962
01:19:09,613 --> 01:19:10,773
Don't waste time

963
01:19:10,814 --> 01:19:12,304
Yes! Time is running short! Come on

964
01:19:13,417 --> 01:19:15,749
Mistress, open up

965
01:19:15,786 --> 01:19:16,844
Who is it?

966
01:19:17,487 --> 01:19:19,751
It's Cha Ting! Open up please

967
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:22,421
What's the matter?

968
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:24,192
My servant is hurt

969
01:19:24,227 --> 01:19:25,990
Do you have any medicine?

970
01:19:28,799 --> 01:19:30,323
What's up?

971
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:33,459
You're trouble

972
01:19:34,337 --> 01:19:36,305
My servant's head is hurt

973
01:19:36,339 --> 01:19:37,636
Please have a look

974
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:42,311
Today is my big day.
You should know what to do

975
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:44,711
Give me the medicine

976
01:19:45,415 --> 01:19:46,541
Come over here, this way

977
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:48,045
Let's talk

978
01:19:48,085 --> 01:19:49,313
What's up?

979
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:55,021
Don't you think you can go that easily?

980
01:19:58,261 --> 01:19:59,319
Why do you act in such a hurry?

981
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:00,761
Let's take action after this night

982
01:20:11,108 --> 01:20:12,166
Don't ruin my wedding

983
01:20:12,676 --> 01:20:15,167
But I'm afraid you'd ruin my plan

984
01:20:15,545 --> 01:20:16,637
What does that mean?

985
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,447
I know Chow is planning to leave
through your secret tunnel

986
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:28,820
He gives me much money
and accompanies me

987
01:20:28,859 --> 01:20:30,019
What can you pay?

988
01:20:32,429 --> 01:20:34,329
Give me a price

989
01:20:52,582 --> 01:20:53,981
$100,000 taels

990
01:20:54,351 --> 01:20:59,288
Money isn't a problem, we can talk about it

991
01:21:00,624 --> 01:21:02,057
Give me the money, I'll give you the man

992
01:21:02,826 --> 01:21:05,954
Be careful that you'll lost
both money and man

993
01:21:07,631 --> 01:21:08,620
You're back

994
01:21:08,665 --> 01:21:11,099
2 more injured?

995
01:21:11,134 --> 01:21:14,331
I tell you, you've to pay for my medicine

996
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,239
Have you finished your business?

997
01:21:18,408 --> 01:21:21,002
But our affair is not ended

998
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:27,844
You can't go

999
01:21:31,922 --> 01:21:33,787
Mr Ho, where are you going to?

1000
01:21:33,824 --> 01:21:35,348
Come on! Have some more wine

1001
01:21:35,392 --> 01:21:37,883
Get lost! I want to piss

1002
01:21:37,961 --> 01:21:40,452
What a coincidence, I want to piss too

1003
01:21:41,865 --> 01:21:42,957
Then you go first

1004
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:49,466
The candle is blown off

1005
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,372
Bitch

1006
01:21:59,716 --> 01:22:01,946
Shall we wait for the signal?

1007
01:22:01,985 --> 01:22:02,974
He is enjoying himself

1008
01:22:03,019 --> 01:22:04,316
but forget about our lives

1009
01:22:04,354 --> 01:22:05,378
Broken cups

1010
01:22:07,657 --> 01:22:10,558
Nothing... this is for protection only

1011
01:22:10,827 --> 01:22:11,919
Let's keep on drinking

1012
01:22:12,262 --> 01:22:14,196
These bastards are well prepared

1013
01:22:14,231 --> 01:22:15,926
We've to fight anyway, let's start now!

1014
01:22:16,466 --> 01:22:17,728
I'll help you

1015
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:23,399
Take the knife

1016
01:23:02,846 --> 01:23:03,813
You want to escape?

1017
01:23:21,798 --> 01:23:22,958
Go with the kids

1018
01:23:22,999 --> 01:23:23,829
Ok

1019
01:23:30,774 --> 01:23:31,638
Let Chung chase after them

1020
01:23:31,675 --> 01:23:32,972
Our target is Chow Wai-on

1021
01:23:34,711 --> 01:23:36,008
Shall we wait for Chow?

1022
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:37,646
Stop waiting, let's get out of here

1023
01:23:37,681 --> 01:23:38,807
Get up, let's go

1024
01:23:38,915 --> 01:23:39,643
Where is Uncle Chow?

1025
01:23:39,683 --> 01:23:41,082
Don't ask, quick!

1026
01:23:45,722 --> 01:23:47,713
Let me go, what have you got from
the East Chamber?

1027
01:23:47,757 --> 01:23:50,225
They've given me much more than you have

1028
01:23:53,964 --> 01:23:55,727
Stop him!

1029
01:23:56,933 --> 01:23:57,957
I won't let you go

1030
01:23:58,001 --> 01:24:00,834
I can't believe you work for
the East Chamber

1031
01:24:01,237 --> 01:24:02,397
Damn you

1032
01:24:02,672 --> 01:24:03,696
Don't frame me

1033
01:24:13,016 --> 01:24:14,347
Chow, you're going to lose

1034
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:24,255
Meaner

1035
01:24:24,294 --> 01:24:25,522
Who told you to take action?

1036
01:24:25,862 --> 01:24:29,059
We didn't, that old man...

1037
01:24:29,099 --> 01:24:30,031
The old bastard?

1038
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:32,599
Meaner

1039
01:24:34,437 --> 01:24:35,563
Damn you

1040
01:24:36,873 --> 01:24:38,397
Jade, we've paid you

1041
01:24:38,641 --> 01:24:39,608
Take it back to buy your coffin

1042
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:42,376
You're good

1043
01:24:48,618 --> 01:24:49,949
There is a sand-storm ahead

1044
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:54,386
It isn't sand storm

1045
01:24:54,424 --> 01:24:55,823
Someone is riding a horse

1046
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,227
The troop from East Chamber is coming

1047
01:25:02,032 --> 01:25:03,192
Let's go separately, we'll join later

1048
01:25:03,233 --> 01:25:03,995
Okay

1049
01:25:05,068 --> 01:25:06,899
It's Tsao's black Flag Arrow Troop

1050
01:25:09,072 --> 01:25:10,403
I'm your man

1051
01:25:15,812 --> 01:25:18,337
I'm your man

1052
01:25:31,828 --> 01:25:34,296
Iron, Ho Fu

1053
01:25:34,697 --> 01:25:36,756
Yuk Ying, Yuk Bo

1054
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:37,926
Yuk Bo

1055
01:25:38,935 --> 01:25:40,994
Sister, I am here

1056
01:25:41,037 --> 01:25:42,868
Where is Yuk Bo?

1057
01:25:42,906 --> 01:25:43,998
Sister

1058
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,600
Don't be afraid, I will take you away

1059
01:25:58,021 --> 01:25:59,318
Are you mad, Jade?

1060
01:26:08,898 --> 01:26:09,762
Siu Chuen

1061
01:26:15,839 --> 01:26:18,171
You two bastards, you are beasts

1062
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:25,139
I'll take your skin off!

1063
01:26:36,426 --> 01:26:37,791
Sister

1064
01:26:37,827 --> 01:26:38,851
Mo-Yan

1065
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:47,762
Hold it

1066
01:26:47,804 --> 01:26:49,999
Tsao is here

1067
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:51,666
What? Tsao is here?

1068
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:54,700
She fainted, it's useless

1069
01:26:56,379 --> 01:26:57,277
Take her to my room

1070
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,288
Dao

1071
01:27:12,195 --> 01:27:14,561
Tell the general I'm in trouble, go!

1072
01:28:13,289 --> 01:28:15,052
The medicine

1073
01:28:29,205 --> 01:28:30,672
We've been through all adversities...

1074
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,267
and we'd escaped from every danger

1075
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:36,545
But it's an ever changing world

1076
01:28:36,846 --> 01:28:40,543
We can't be sure if we can escape this time

1077
01:28:46,756 --> 01:28:48,223
Mo-Yan

1078
01:28:48,658 --> 01:28:52,424
Wai-on, I should have faith in you

1079
01:28:54,197 --> 01:28:55,892
That flute

1080
01:28:58,234 --> 01:29:00,725
I didn't mean to give it to jade

1081
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:02,770
I really don't know...

1082
01:29:03,306 --> 01:29:05,672
you'd be so upset

1083
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:08,040
Luckily I can explain to you

1084
01:29:08,678 --> 01:29:11,306
People said: Love is not secured
in a messy world

1085
01:29:11,347 --> 01:29:14,145
Actually, love is more valuable in
such a troubled world

1086
01:29:15,652 --> 01:29:18,052
You can't get the flute back

1087
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:21,752
It's nothing

1088
01:29:23,626 --> 01:29:25,958
Nothing is more important than our love

1089
01:29:29,332 --> 01:29:30,299
Damn it

1090
01:29:31,467 --> 01:29:32,661
Why don't you leave?

1091
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:37,003
This is my inn, why should I leave?

1092
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:38,038
I've nearly forgotten

1093
01:29:38,074 --> 01:29:39,632
You're as cool as a desert

1094
01:29:39,676 --> 01:29:41,473
You're so mean

1095
01:29:41,644 --> 01:29:43,908
The people in desert are always selfish

1096
01:29:43,946 --> 01:29:44,913
They only care about themselves

1097
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,047
So you open this inn

1098
01:29:49,085 --> 01:29:51,053
You travellers
leave when you reach your aim

1099
01:29:51,087 --> 01:29:52,418
I just learn this from you

1100
01:29:53,456 --> 01:29:54,946
And I'm cool and mean?

1101
01:30:24,854 --> 01:30:25,843
Who is it?

1102
01:30:25,888 --> 01:30:26,684
Dao

1103
01:30:26,723 --> 01:30:27,815
Are the helpers coming?

1104
01:30:27,857 --> 01:30:29,791
He's not coming

1105
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,121
Damn it, they're all heartless beasts

1106
01:30:33,396 --> 01:30:34,556
After killing those bastards

1107
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:36,087
I'll come back and teach them
a good lesson

1108
01:30:37,734 --> 01:30:39,895
Why are you back?

1109
01:30:44,774 --> 01:30:46,867
It's out of my expectation that

1110
01:30:46,909 --> 01:30:49,707
the one who stays behind with me
is a barbarian

1111
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:19,439
Watch out for the arrows

1112
01:31:26,215 --> 01:31:28,877
Dao, take the kids to the tunnel,

1113
01:31:29,118 --> 01:31:29,777
Hurry up

1114
01:32:08,758 --> 01:32:09,747
Damn it

1115
01:32:32,782 --> 01:32:33,544
Hold it

1116
01:32:35,885 --> 01:32:36,909
Hurry up

1117
01:32:42,925 --> 01:32:43,914
Your flute

1118
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:46,319
I don't want anything that
is given out of pity

1119
01:32:54,403 --> 01:32:57,531
Your excellency, the inn is surrounded

1120
01:33:01,911 --> 01:33:03,208
Mo-yan, go down first

1121
01:33:22,832 --> 01:33:23,696
Hold my hand

1122
01:33:32,174 --> 01:33:33,072
There are many soldiers

1123
01:33:33,109 --> 01:33:33,632
Forget it

1124
01:33:33,676 --> 01:33:34,267
Go

1125
01:33:44,186 --> 01:33:45,050
There are people behind the hill

1126
01:34:00,169 --> 01:34:00,965
Still chasing?

1127
01:34:01,003 --> 01:34:02,561
Go to hell!

1128
01:34:12,582 --> 01:34:14,049
Go...

1129
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:15,914
The desert is huge, I'll follow you

1130
01:34:16,118 --> 01:34:17,346
I will stop him

1131
01:34:30,967 --> 01:34:32,935
Jade, take the kids away

1132
01:34:34,103 --> 01:34:35,400
Wait for me at the Dragon Gate

1133
01:34:36,005 --> 01:34:36,937
Don't think about it now!

1134
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:46,411
Wai-on, we'd live or die together

1135
01:34:46,449 --> 01:34:47,711
Me too

1136
01:34:49,285 --> 01:34:50,547
Why don't you leave?

1137
01:35:05,901 --> 01:35:07,459
Block his way

1138
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:08,601
Are you okay?

1139
01:35:24,286 --> 01:35:25,275
Wai-on!

1140
01:35:33,996 --> 01:35:34,792
Get lost!

1141
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:44,399
After killing you

1142
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:46,237
my kingdom is as solid as steel

1143
01:35:49,278 --> 01:35:50,802
We'll fight you together

1144
01:35:50,846 --> 01:35:52,006
But you fight alone

1145
01:35:52,048 --> 01:35:54,039
Damn you, we can kill you any time

1146
01:35:59,522 --> 01:36:01,012
Come on, eunuch

1147
01:36:32,188 --> 01:36:34,019
Shit, we are trapped inside
the drift sand

1148
01:36:38,227 --> 01:36:39,319
What should we do?

1149
01:36:39,462 --> 01:36:40,520
We can't move

1150
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:43,291
It's your end

1151
01:36:49,638 --> 01:36:51,435
Mo-Yan

1152
01:36:54,477 --> 01:36:55,876
Mo-Yan

1153
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:11,285
Don't close your eyes

1154
01:37:11,327 --> 01:37:12,351
I'll help you to chop him

1155
01:37:17,533 --> 01:37:18,363
The Willow Strike

1156
01:37:22,838 --> 01:37:24,863
Destroying stance

1157
01:37:29,512 --> 01:37:31,173
Mo-Yan

1158
01:37:32,181 --> 01:37:33,978
Mo-Yan

1159
01:37:43,192 --> 01:37:44,181
Go to hell

1160
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:45,892
It's useless

1161
01:37:52,735 --> 01:37:53,702
I will kill you

1162
01:37:55,738 --> 01:37:56,727
Stop

1163
01:38:01,076 --> 01:38:02,100
Be careful

1164
01:38:15,224 --> 01:38:16,851
Chow, you are a man

1165
01:38:16,892 --> 01:38:18,951
You have to take the kids out of here

1166
01:38:20,763 --> 01:38:22,594
I'm the most powerful man in the world

1167
01:38:22,631 --> 01:38:25,065
You choose the way to hell

1168
01:38:45,254 --> 01:38:46,687
Oh, my leg

1169
01:38:55,464 --> 01:38:56,988
My hand

1170
01:39:07,643 --> 01:39:08,974
Where else can you go?

1171
01:39:22,992 --> 01:39:24,118
Wonder sword

1172
01:39:24,927 --> 01:39:26,394
Push me over there, hurry up

1173
01:40:13,442 --> 01:40:17,071
Chow, can you hear me?

1174
01:40:22,084 --> 01:40:23,346
Mo-Yan

1175
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:26,578
Mo-Yan

1176
01:41:02,057 --> 01:41:04,048
Will you come back to the Dragon Inn?

1177
01:41:05,027 --> 01:41:07,461
When other guests come

1178
01:41:07,496 --> 01:41:10,192
you may have already forgotten me

1179
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:14,666
I can't face the desert as brave as you

1180
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:15,959
I want to leave now

1181
01:41:52,941 --> 01:41:54,568
The Dragon Inn

1182
01:41:55,210 --> 01:41:56,177
Give me some wine

1183
01:42:14,029 --> 01:42:16,361
Let's leave this heartless place

1184
01:42:17,766 --> 01:42:19,063
to go after Chow
