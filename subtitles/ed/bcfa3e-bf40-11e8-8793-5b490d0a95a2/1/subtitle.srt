1
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:48,854
Welcome! Come inside please!

2
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,423
Come in and have a drink.

3
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:55,667
This way please.

4
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:20,391
Something's wrong.

5
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:23,018
They're too busy!

6
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:25,690
There's too many waiters!

7
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:35,598
White Tiger! Give yourself up!

8
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:36,903
We'll get you!

9
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:38,433
There's no escape!

10
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:07,067
Bounty hunters from six provinces!

11
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:13,771
Seems like the end of the line for us.

12
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:16,011
Be careful!

13
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:34,329
Get us? Never!

14
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,250
White Tiger!

15
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,359
White Tiger!

16
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,824
Split!

17
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,006
Mr. Huang...

18
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:52,610
What is it?

19
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:54,407
I'm there for the money.

20
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:57,941
Come in and get it.

21
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:20,697
I just scared him off.

22
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:22,865
He really is a coward.

23
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,305
Fortunately I can run very fast.

24
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,318
Biggie!

25
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:36,611
Biggie!

26
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:38,818
Mr. Chiu, what's the matter?

27
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:40,985
Ask her to help me get dressed.

28
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,859
Biggie!

29
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,329
You only read the script in this moment.

30
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,035
Why are you still hesitating?

31
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:56,934
Hurry...

32
00:04:57,043 --> 00:05:00,137
You see me as nothing, hurry...

33
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,770
How dare you.

34
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:11,956
Collect the laundry fee again?

35
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:22,560
Came back here.

36
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,230
I'm not pushing you,
you can paid me few days later.

37
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:29,307
Clean my wife's underwear too.

38
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,301
Well...

39
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:33,606
You clean it or not?

40
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:37,139
Yes, but my sister will scold me.

41
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,012
I will bit you.

42
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:02,620
Huang,

43
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:05,289
you'll meet your match!

44
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:10,531
Master Tam, you've got a visitor.

45
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:12,801
A visitor?

46
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:18,300
Our school's famous in Canton.

47
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,709
You're a wanted man.

48
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:23,948
True, we're partners in the past.

49
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,245
But I don't want to be investigated now.

50
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:33,019
I think you better lay low.

51
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:39,163
I still treasure our friendship.

52
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:49,004
I've got friends in the opera troupe.

53
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,111
Why don't you join them?

54
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,107
And we'll find a way for you.

55
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,226
I'm telling you!

56
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,557
No one owes me money!

57
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:14,389
I'll break your neck!

58
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,298
What are you staring at?
You don't know me?

59
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:21,336
You look rough!

60
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:25,071
But you're a coward!

61
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:28,670
Just wait till you meet my sister!

62
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:31,215
Mousy! What are you doing?

63
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:34,783
I'm scolding him!

64
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:36,048
Who is he?

65
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:39,724
Me.

66
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:43,218
You're useless.

67
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:47,893
Have you collected the money?

68
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:51,369
I've collected... Some more clothes.

69
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:52,965
More clothes?

70
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:54,972
Take off your clothes.
I'll wash them too.

71
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:56,664
It doesn't matter.

72
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:58,569
Take them off!

73
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,216
Money?

74
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:10,454
Where's the money?

75
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,957
I was chased by dogs,

76
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:17,995
and Biggie threatened to kill me...

77
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:20,691
We'll never survive like this!

78
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,791
- But Biggie was tough!
- Why not say that you're scared.

79
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:25,064
You're a coward! Admit it!

80
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:27,533
Wake up! You fool!

81
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:29,865
Biggie was as rough as you're now!

82
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:34,405
I'll kill you!

83
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:36,908
I'll kill you!

84
00:10:38,318 --> 00:10:40,912
Don't come back without the money!

85
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,560
"Pochilam"

86
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:24,654
Which one is Huang Fei-hung?

87
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:32,729
- Excuse me...
- I'm the king fu instructor for the navy!

88
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:34,571
What do you want?

89
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:35,935
Are you blind?

90
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:37,901
Just wait a second please.

91
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:39,438
No!

92
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:43,912
Please.

93
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:46,715
Sit here.

94
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:51,412
Let me examine you.

95
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:59,196
Don't hurt me, or I'll beat you up!

96
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:02,559
You want a fight?

97
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:04,363
That's fine with me.

98
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,870
Stop! That's no way to treat a patient!

99
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:13,507
I as just arranging your seat, Master.

100
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:20,044
What's wrong with you?

101
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:21,676
I feel uncomfortable from head to toe!

102
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:23,483
I'm Huang Fei-hung. I'll examine you.

103
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:27,051
Let me warn you first.

104
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,927
I've crippled several of my doctors!

105
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:45,000
Your pulse is weak!

106
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:48,643
Can you do something about it?

107
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:51,375
Of course! No problem!

108
00:12:57,957 --> 00:12:59,857
Back to normal now!

109
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:06,395
Excellent! What's wrong now?

110
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:11,531
You've suffered internal injuries!

111
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:14,002
You're joking!

112
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:16,704
Touch your rib cage.

113
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,504
Does it hurt?

114
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,140
No.

115
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:28,185
No? What about this spot?

116
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:31,915
Yes, it hurts a bit.

117
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:34,925
You've breathing problems, too.

118
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,764
Yes, how do you know?

119
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,772
I think you trained much too hard.

120
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:52,967
I must try to relieve your tension.

121
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,981
You'll be okay when that's done.

122
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,511
Does it hurt?

123
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:02,052
No!

124
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:06,685
It doesn't!

125
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,622
What's wrong?

126
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:25,500
It doesn't hurt, does it?

127
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,139
What are you doing?

128
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:30,008
Trying to kill me?

129
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,741
It's burning...

130
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:43,792
Stop it!

131
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:47,455
It won't hurt.

132
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:03,776
Have you finished?

133
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:18,557
Feeling better?

134
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:25,100
You're great!

135
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:26,498
Of course.

136
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:32,936
You dare to hit me?

137
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:43,254
How many hands you want to use?

138
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,722
You're magnificent! Thank you!

139
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:01,963
I don't like this.

140
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:03,368
You can have it.

141
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,669
Hey! Come back!

142
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:06,870
Stop screaming.

143
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,405
He didn't pay!

144
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:12,006
Forget it!
Prepare for the lion dance contest!

145
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,345
Yes, Master.

146
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:17,413
"Henan Club"

147
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,087
Fire!

148
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:50,353
Ladies and gentlemen.

149
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:52,356
To celebrate the opening of the club,

150
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:56,927
we've invited Huang Fei-hung

151
00:16:57,063 --> 00:17:02,194
to perform a lion dance
with his students.

152
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:04,168
Great!

153
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:11,304
Master, is this an easy one?

154
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:12,342
No!

155
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,878
You'll hurt yourself if not careful.

156
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:17,608
What does it call?

157
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:20,310
The Gold and Silver Rosette!

158
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:26,914
You'll have to cross the bridge first.

159
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:30,859
- Let's go, Ah Foon!
- Yes!

160
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,227
Roll the drum!

161
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:24,114
Go!

162
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:49,364
Hurry! Come on!

163
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:50,702
Hold on!

164
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:38,815
Jump!

165
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,595
What's wrong with you?

166
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,726
Shut up! The Bridge!

167
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:26,799
I can't hold on any longer.

168
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:31,775
The waist band!

169
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:47,619
Master, we've failed.

170
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:48,920
Shut up!

171
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:51,286
Use the pole!

172
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:22,818
Hurry!

173
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:32,496
It's alright!

174
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,100
We've got it!

175
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:45,511
Master. Look!

176
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:47,482
The Northern Lion!

177
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:19,881
The Seven Stars!

178
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:43,399
- An Foon! Support me!
- Yes.

179
00:22:44,743 --> 00:22:46,643
Watch it! Here comes Huang Fei-hung!

180
00:22:57,723 --> 00:22:59,020
The Seven Stars!

181
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,860
Ah Foon, be careful!

182
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:25,406
- Get on my shoulders!
- Fine!

183
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:38,312
Master, are you alright?

184
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:40,712
Huang, you wait and see!

185
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:11,881
"Everything turn out as you wish."

186
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:26,623
Thanks...

187
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,965
Master Huang's magnificent!

188
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,473
Mousy.

189
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:47,113
Why look so depressed?

190
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:52,048
You've failed to collect the money?

191
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:56,717
All men bully you just because
you aren't brave enough!

192
00:26:56,862 --> 00:27:00,764
I'll go collect the money for you.

193
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:05,865
But give me a smile first!

194
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:18,274
Let's have our picture
taken with Mr. Chiu.

195
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,542
Fine.

196
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:22,545
Mr. Chiu!

197
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:27,815
Mr. Chiu!

198
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,855
Sister!

199
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:31,990
You worked too hard.

200
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:33,463
Did I perform well?

201
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:36,089
- It was superb!
- Really?

202
00:27:36,268 --> 00:27:37,758
Let's have our picture taken.

203
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:39,927
Fine. Can you take a picture of us?

204
00:28:13,872 --> 00:28:17,273
Move closer. Look at here!

205
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:20,639
Say cheese! Ready...!

206
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,908
Go to hell!

207
00:28:42,434 --> 00:28:45,926
Damn it!

208
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:47,766
You dare to offend Mr. Chiu?

209
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:52,099
You'd be dead if not for Master Tam.

210
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:53,843
Scream!

211
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:20,997
Tiger...

212
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,958
I'll buy you a meal tonight.

213
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:47,657
Empty promises!

214
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:49,430
I don't believe you.

215
00:29:57,075 --> 00:30:01,569
Bi... gg... ie, Biggie.

216
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:08,312
What do these words say?

217
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:10,148
"Bastard"

218
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:13,346
Compliment?

219
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:15,392
Sure! It reads: "Biggie is Bastard"!

220
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:20,596
Damn you! I'll get you for this!

221
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:22,632
Help!

222
00:30:26,938 --> 00:30:28,337
Ah Foon, that's the man.

223
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:37,344
Mousy! Show us some tricks!

224
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:39,780
I can't. I'm scared of him.

225
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,159
If I'm half as good as him...

226
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:48,515
It hurts? I want a smile from you.

227
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:53,714
Smile again?

228
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:00,129
It hurts like hell!

229
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:02,961
Give me a sweet smile!

230
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:06,330
Mousy!

231
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:18,114
I want you to smile at Mousy in future.

232
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:20,576
Mousy!

233
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:22,084
Have you forgotten something?

234
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:27,681
- Let's go!
- Yes.

235
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:32,319
Ah Foon, you're great!

236
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:35,925
You've got to act tough.

237
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:38,768
I can never be tough.

238
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:41,595
I really envy you.

239
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:44,571
Will Master Huang
accept me as a student?

240
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:46,904
I'll ask him.

241
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:50,004
I better be going now.

242
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,152
What are you doing?

243
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:02,709
Excuse me, my friend.

244
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:08,457
Stop it! Go away!

245
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:55,629
Excuse me...

246
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:00,367
Excuse me...

247
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:25,167
Help!

248
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,438
Help!

249
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,417
Someone wants to kill me!

250
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:26,785
Help!

251
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:30,224
You hear me? Someone tries to kill me!

252
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,352
Damn it! You're deaf and mute!

253
00:38:17,141 --> 00:38:20,133
Where do you live?
You know the deceased?

254
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:23,372
- I know the deceased.
- Which people he's been going out with?

255
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:24,675
I don't really know.

256
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:27,114
Did he drink?

257
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:28,482
He didn't drink at all.

258
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,815
The Marshal has arrived!

259
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:33,089
Attention!

260
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:36,423
Salute!

261
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,398
Good day, sir!

262
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:51,675
Marshal, this way please!

263
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:56,510
Who asked you to come in?

264
00:38:56,614 --> 00:38:58,309
Lock him up!

265
00:38:58,449 --> 00:38:59,939
You agree with me, Marshal?

266
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,816
Marshal...

267
00:39:03,888 --> 00:39:09,485
What? You're the Marshal?

268
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:31,804
It looks like a love triangle...

269
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:48,832
He was murdered by his enemy!

270
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:52,525
Brilliant!

271
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:57,869
Could it be the White Tiger?

272
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:03,105
After my careful observation...

273
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:04,375
No?

274
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:09,615
Possible. After my careful analysis...

275
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:11,148
Possible?

276
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,282
No way.

277
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:17,790
Excellent judgement, Marshal.

278
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:21,762
I traveled far for White Tiger.

279
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:24,731
So I leave this
insignificant case to you.

280
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:29,299
I'll hold you responsible
for your fail this.

281
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:35,635
Responsible? Me? Marshal!

282
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:39,372
You've come such a long way.

283
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,350
How about having dinner with me tomorrow.

284
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:45,251
Please...

285
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:51,159
We weren't invited
to the restaurant's opening.

286
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:52,354
Why?

287
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,830
They've invited Huang Fei-hung.

288
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:00,169
Huang?

289
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:03,767
It's his birthday a couple days later.

290
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:08,504
Send him a birthday suit.

291
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:13,549
He'll like my suit for sure.

292
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:25,351
Is everything ready for my birthday?

293
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:26,327
Everything is ready, Master.

294
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:30,366
Master...

295
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:35,030
A tailor's here to make a suit for you.

296
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:36,265
What?

297
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:42,142
Your birthday suit.

298
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,679
Show him in.

299
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:55,753
How come it's different tailor?

300
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,550
Ah To's away.

301
00:41:57,695 --> 00:42:00,095
Let me take your measurement.

302
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:02,626
Fine.

303
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:11,505
You'll live longer wearing my suit.

304
00:42:13,377 --> 00:42:15,368
Make one for yourself.

305
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,012
24 inches! Must be a good fighter.

306
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,139
Thank you.

307
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:24,212
Three foot! What kind of cuff you like?

308
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:25,652
Wen's style.

309
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:27,747
6-inch cuffs.

310
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,561
2-foot splits and 5-foot-long suit.

311
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,198
1.8 foot for shoulders.

312
00:42:37,468 --> 00:42:38,867
30 inches waist.

313
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:44,702
What are the needles for?

314
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:47,407
The secure your button.

315
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:50,207
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

316
00:42:52,383 --> 00:42:53,680
Let me measure your neck.

317
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,759
Have you finished?

318
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:05,819
I would have if you had cooperated.

319
00:43:27,118 --> 00:43:29,518
What else you want to do?

320
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:31,952
Choose the material.

321
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:36,625
I'll take the piece on your hand.

322
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:40,689
Cut it.

323
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:22,333
I know you're the Demon Tailor!

324
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,132
Why do you want to kill me?

325
00:44:26,978 --> 00:44:29,378
My Big Brother
Tam King is angry with you.

326
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:35,309
Can you tell Mr. Tam?

327
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,814
I want to be his friend, Liang Foon!

328
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:40,083
Master!

329
00:44:42,326 --> 00:44:44,419
- Give him his scissors!
- Yes, Master!

330
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:57,100
It's difficult to clean.

331
00:44:57,341 --> 00:45:02,244
Rub...

332
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:06,706
It snapped.

333
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:22,028
Help!

334
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:26,835
What's wrong with you?

335
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:34,036
I thought you're the masked killer.

336
00:45:34,712 --> 00:45:37,704
You're the biggest coward I've ever seen.

337
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:40,808
Dry the clothes!

338
00:45:49,093 --> 00:45:51,493
Use both fingers.

339
00:45:52,797 --> 00:45:55,595
Why? It's a waste of effort.

340
00:45:55,966 --> 00:45:57,365
This is our family secret.

341
00:45:57,501 --> 00:45:58,991
Do it!

342
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,265
It's not practical.

343
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,162
Get it.

344
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:19,879
Who dropped these money?

345
00:47:19,984 --> 00:47:22,475
Money? It's mine! I dropped it!

346
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:29,658
You dirtied my clothes!

347
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:33,192
I'll kill you.

348
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:36,563
You've got the wrong person!

349
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:38,567
- I'll get you.
- I'm innocent!

350
00:47:38,636 --> 00:47:41,036
Where do you think you're going?

351
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:44,673
- Ah Foon.
- What? Look, we're friends.

352
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:47,175
I'm going to make you brave tonight.

353
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:48,541
How?

354
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,772
You mean...

355
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:53,846
It's not as bad as that.

356
00:47:54,084 --> 00:47:55,483
Really?

357
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:56,711
Let's go.

358
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,486
Marshal, please.

359
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:04,926
What kind of place is this?

360
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:07,429
This is a high class brothel.

361
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:10,261
A brothel?

362
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:14,234
What do you take me for?

363
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:20,738
The moral standard is down the drain...

364
00:48:25,816 --> 00:48:27,716
What a lovely bottom!

365
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:34,818
What a surprise!

366
00:48:34,892 --> 00:48:36,985
Take good care of him.

367
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:38,560
Marshal...

368
00:48:38,696 --> 00:48:40,596
Let's go somewhere else.

369
00:48:40,864 --> 00:48:44,061
Let's stay and check the place out.

370
00:48:44,235 --> 00:48:46,533
There may be underage girls here.

371
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:47,967
Yes.

372
00:48:48,606 --> 00:48:51,200
Let's have a toss.

373
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:55,805
Drink up. Don't be shy.

374
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,174
What's wrong? You're flushed.

375
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:01,774
What? I just had a little drink.

376
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:04,183
But you just drank the soy sauce.

377
00:49:09,426 --> 00:49:11,724
I want to investigate this girl.

378
00:49:12,429 --> 00:49:13,919
Wait.

379
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:16,631
What's the matter?

380
00:49:16,834 --> 00:49:18,927
Can I investigate your wife?

381
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:19,865
Do you know who I am?

382
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,460
- And do you know who I am?
- Who are you?

383
00:49:21,672 --> 00:49:23,264
- Liang Foon of the Pochilam School.
- I've never heard your name.

384
00:49:23,407 --> 00:49:25,807
- Have you heard of Huang Fei-hung?
- Yes, I have.

385
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:28,803
That's him over there.

386
00:49:31,248 --> 00:49:34,046
- Huang Fei-hung?
- I'm not a afraid of you.

387
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:38,044
You just wait and see.

388
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:39,916
Marshal...

389
00:49:44,061 --> 00:49:45,358
Be courageous.

390
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:47,396
Follow me.

391
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:50,360
- Arrest them.
- Yes.

392
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:57,539
Who shall we arrest?

393
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,505
The one behind.

394
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:01,634
Yes, Marshal.

395
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:05,409
It's none of your business. Go.

396
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,645
Resisting arrest?

397
00:50:10,754 --> 00:50:13,746
Don't worry. Get them.

398
00:50:15,993 --> 00:50:18,086
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

399
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:30,963
I'm sorry.

400
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:38,577
Marshal...

401
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:40,411
- Are you alright?
- Shut up!

402
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,193
Excellent footwork!

403
00:50:52,129 --> 00:50:54,723
You dare to kick me
with your lnvisible Kick?

404
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:56,092
Coming!

405
00:51:06,143 --> 00:51:07,132
Hand off!

406
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:26,819
Get away your foot!

407
00:51:33,537 --> 00:51:35,334
You made me do it.

408
00:51:45,549 --> 00:51:47,642
This punch bag is great.

409
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:49,248
Come on, don't be afraid.

410
00:51:50,821 --> 00:51:53,619
Hit it.

411
00:51:57,027 --> 00:51:58,324
Harder.

412
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:03,093
Huang Fei-hung, you dare to hit me?

413
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:10,534
You want to use weapon?

414
00:52:15,412 --> 00:52:18,711
Marshal?

415
00:52:19,149 --> 00:52:20,844
What to do?

416
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:27,887
Have a rest. I'll get someone for you.

417
00:52:29,693 --> 00:52:30,819
"Fu Xing Lou"

418
00:52:35,332 --> 00:52:40,770
Master, this is Mousy I told you about.

419
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:42,828
Where's he?

420
00:52:44,508 --> 00:52:47,602
Come out! Speak to Master!

421
00:52:49,413 --> 00:52:50,505
Say it.

422
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:52,705
I want you to be my student.

423
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:56,041
No... I want to be your master.

424
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,280
He said he wanted to be your student.

425
00:52:59,423 --> 00:53:01,220
He wants you to be his master.

426
00:53:01,325 --> 00:53:03,725
I'm your admirer!

427
00:53:06,697 --> 00:53:10,394
No! This is hopeless!

428
00:53:30,621 --> 00:53:33,317
What are you trying to do?

429
00:53:33,423 --> 00:53:34,219
Kill my son?

430
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:36,258
Ignore him! Let's go!

431
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,258
Well...

432
00:53:37,427 --> 00:53:38,826
Mousy!

433
00:53:38,996 --> 00:53:40,395
Come over here!

434
00:53:41,532 --> 00:53:43,727
Master Huang, I'm innocent!

435
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:46,467
Have you learnt kung fu before?

436
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:47,897
No!

437
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:53,198
Yes! You've got it!

438
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:54,566
Got what?

439
00:53:54,645 --> 00:53:57,045
Kneel down, you fool!

440
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:18,928
What's going on?

441
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:24,706
You freed my bird.

442
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:27,869
You'll take its place.

443
00:54:28,078 --> 00:54:29,773
Give him his bird.

444
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:32,675
Yes!

445
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:38,314
Here's your chance.

446
00:54:38,455 --> 00:54:42,050
Go to him! Be courageous!

447
00:54:45,095 --> 00:54:47,290
- Take her back!
- Yes.

448
00:54:47,664 --> 00:54:50,656
Here's your bird! Hands off the girl!

449
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:55,801
How dare you?

450
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:02,338
Huang Fei-hung?

451
00:55:02,879 --> 00:55:04,278
What are you waiting for?

452
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:05,506
I'm sorry!

453
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:08,278
Let's go!

454
00:55:08,585 --> 00:55:10,075
It's Huang Fei-hung! Run!

455
00:55:14,224 --> 00:55:15,521
Are you okay?

456
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:18,593
I'm fine, thank you!

457
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:20,026
Master Huang?

458
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:29,532
Here's your chance.

459
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:31,265
The girl dropped her wallet.

460
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:33,000
Send it back to her.

461
00:55:33,076 --> 00:55:34,270
Go!

462
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:48,988
Miss!

463
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:52,858
Master Huang!

464
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:54,453
Where? Where is he?

465
00:55:55,032 --> 00:55:56,226
She was just calling you.

466
00:55:57,768 --> 00:55:58,962
Yes, I'm here!

467
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:01,431
That's my wallet!

468
00:56:03,607 --> 00:56:04,904
Here!

469
00:56:05,008 --> 00:56:05,906
Thanks.

470
00:56:06,076 --> 00:56:07,270
Don't mention it.

471
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:10,106
Can you go out with Master Huang?

472
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:13,705
Sure, but don't too night.

473
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:22,153
I'll make you look like Master.

474
00:56:43,847 --> 00:56:45,041
Liang Foon!

475
00:56:46,116 --> 00:56:46,912
Master!

476
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:49,985
It's hot in this.

477
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:53,882
You've got to look smart for your date.

478
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:56,182
What if we fail?

479
00:56:56,326 --> 00:56:59,124
Don't worry!

480
00:56:59,463 --> 00:57:05,368
Keep your cool!

481
00:57:06,036 --> 00:57:09,130
I'll give you a chance to save her.

482
00:57:09,306 --> 00:57:10,204
How?

483
00:57:10,373 --> 00:57:16,676
The masked killer that
you most scared at will appear to-night.

484
00:57:42,172 --> 00:57:44,072
Huang... you want to hit me?

485
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:46,502
No. I was trying to get this mosquito.

486
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:13,797
Don't be afraid...

487
00:58:17,107 --> 00:58:19,507
Let me teach him a lesson.

488
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:29,045
Ward me off!

489
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:37,186
Kick me!

490
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,454
How?

491
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:39,426
A kick below the belt!

492
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,391
You've kicked at the wrong place.

493
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:56,010
Harder!

494
00:59:02,018 --> 00:59:04,009
You're too hard!

495
00:59:04,521 --> 00:59:05,419
Get out!

496
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:08,487
Good boy!

497
00:59:11,661 --> 00:59:13,754
This is the proudest moment in my life.

498
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:15,856
Master Huang.

499
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:23,062
I feel safe with you.

500
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,434
Really?

501
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:30,473
Get up!

502
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,415
The masked killer is back!

503
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:45,426
Get rid of him!

504
00:59:51,301 --> 00:59:54,202
You're a great help to me today.

505
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:57,069
You want to give me another chance?

506
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,938
Thank you.

507
01:00:10,754 --> 01:00:11,846
Are you alright?

508
01:00:11,955 --> 01:00:15,447
Just a lapse of concentration.

509
01:00:17,294 --> 01:00:21,492
The masked killer? You're not Ah Foon?

510
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:22,587
Run!

511
01:00:28,571 --> 01:00:33,474
Help...

512
01:00:34,177 --> 01:00:35,474
Run...

513
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:37,978
Rum?

514
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:41,545
Run...

515
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:47,216
Master Huang! What about me?

516
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:48,689
I...

517
01:00:51,461 --> 01:00:54,953
What's the matter with you? You crazy?

518
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:56,893
I'm haunted!

519
01:00:57,033 --> 01:01:03,131
Haunted? I'll get the ghost for you.

520
01:01:03,707 --> 01:01:06,005
Where's the ghost?

521
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:08,600
It's behind you.

522
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:13,605
Oh my God!

523
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,777
I invoke the spirit!

524
01:01:47,183 --> 01:01:48,582
Master, have some tea.

525
01:01:48,718 --> 01:01:51,118
Huang Fei-hung!

526
01:01:51,254 --> 01:01:53,245
Come out!

527
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:54,584
Oh dear!

528
01:01:54,924 --> 01:01:56,221
It's no use hiding!

529
01:01:58,895 --> 01:02:00,385
May I have your name, please?

530
01:02:01,464 --> 01:02:02,658
He's our leader!

531
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:04,489
He's the Marshal!

532
01:02:04,968 --> 01:02:06,367
He's Marshal Pao!

533
01:02:06,736 --> 01:02:08,033
Nice to meet you.

534
01:02:08,138 --> 01:02:09,537
I'm here for Huang Fei-hung.

535
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:11,934
Not you!

536
01:02:13,676 --> 01:02:16,474
Have you met Huang before?

537
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:19,538
Yes! And I've fought him, too.

538
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:21,749
You fought him?

539
01:02:22,452 --> 01:02:24,750
Do I look like Huang Fei-hung?

540
01:02:25,121 --> 01:02:27,214
No!

541
01:02:27,357 --> 01:02:29,257
Huang's much younger.

542
01:02:29,626 --> 01:02:33,790
Then Huang ought to buy you a drink.

543
01:02:34,264 --> 01:02:37,165
Why do you call Huang a bastard?

544
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:38,632
I...

545
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:42,699
Who are you?

546
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:44,362
Why the questions?

547
01:02:44,507 --> 01:02:49,410
Marshal, I'm Huang Fei-hung.

548
01:02:49,612 --> 01:02:52,809
You must be his father.

549
01:02:56,786 --> 01:02:58,583
Huang Fei-hung! Don't run!

550
01:02:59,122 --> 01:03:00,419
He...

551
01:03:00,924 --> 01:03:03,620
Arrest him!

552
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:06,454
Ah Foon! Ah Foon!

553
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:07,761
So he's Huang Fei-hung!

554
01:03:07,831 --> 01:03:10,732
That's right. He's in it, too.

555
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:30,912
Eagle's Claw? Stop!

556
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:35,554
Kneel down!

557
01:03:37,627 --> 01:03:38,924
- Master!
- Master Huang!

558
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:45,858
What's the matter with you? You crazy?

559
01:03:46,035 --> 01:03:48,435
How dare you?

560
01:03:48,605 --> 01:03:50,800
Are you really Huang Fei-hung?

561
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:53,107
Yes.

562
01:03:53,176 --> 01:03:54,768
Show some mercy, Marshal.

563
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:57,812
I'll punish them myself.

564
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:01,181
Alright.

565
01:04:01,317 --> 01:04:04,809
I'll let them off this time.

566
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:09,081
Thanks.

567
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:12,922
I'll buy you dinner tonight.

568
01:04:13,062 --> 01:04:14,552
You better.

569
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:18,626
Ah Foon! Come with me!

570
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:27,134
Master Huang!

571
01:04:31,548 --> 01:04:34,540
You've learnt the Eagle's Claw.

572
01:04:34,651 --> 01:04:38,143
You don't need me as your master.

573
01:04:44,027 --> 01:04:45,824
Eagle's Claw?

574
01:04:53,036 --> 01:04:54,936
Excuse me...

575
01:04:57,507 --> 01:05:01,409
Master Huang, let's have a toss.

576
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:03,572
Thanks for coming!

577
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:08,211
Master Huang, here's to you.

578
01:05:10,253 --> 01:05:14,349
Thanks. Help yourself!

579
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:18,155
I can help myself!

580
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:22,322
Make yourself at home!

581
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:34,905
I'll never be Master Huang's student.

582
01:05:36,879 --> 01:05:38,073
Forget it!

583
01:05:41,117 --> 01:05:45,110
We're still friends. I'll help you.

584
01:05:53,896 --> 01:05:55,193
I've got it.

585
01:05:55,865 --> 01:05:56,854
What?

586
01:06:00,436 --> 01:06:01,630
You...

587
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:07,065
You saved a girl last time, right?

588
01:06:09,879 --> 01:06:13,280
This time you'll get yourself beaten up.

589
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,778
I don't want to do it!

590
01:06:15,918 --> 01:06:18,910
You must win my master's sympathy.

591
01:06:19,422 --> 01:06:21,413
I see! Let's do it.

592
01:06:21,758 --> 01:06:24,056
Master...

593
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:25,387
What's wrong?

594
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:27,826
Someone just raided the bank.

595
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:30,593
Mousy went and fought them.

596
01:06:30,733 --> 01:06:34,134
He was outnumbered.

597
01:06:34,237 --> 01:06:35,534
What's happened?

598
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:39,006
He was badly beaten up.

599
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:41,366
Where were the police?

600
01:06:42,145 --> 01:06:44,545
They've all disappeared.

601
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:48,544
Mousy is righteous.

602
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:50,778
Take him as your student, please.

603
01:06:51,587 --> 01:06:52,679
Mousy!

604
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:54,383
He can't even stand straight.

605
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:11,029
I'll treat you in a special way.

606
01:07:11,307 --> 01:07:13,002
What special way?

607
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:19,346
You've got your heart in the wrong place.

608
01:07:19,816 --> 01:07:23,912
I must open your chest and put it right.

609
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,114
Then I'll sew up your chest.

610
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:29,281
Then you'll be okay.

611
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:31,521
He can stand it.

612
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,200
Master Huang, this knife alright?

613
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,932
Just about. Ah Foon! Hold him down!

614
01:07:47,577 --> 01:07:50,478
I'm fine! I'm okay.

615
01:07:50,613 --> 01:07:51,602
Mousy...

616
01:07:51,714 --> 01:07:56,913
Ah Foon! Drink to the Marshal!

617
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:01,112
I'm generous. I don't bear grudges.

618
01:08:04,227 --> 01:08:07,025
I thought you're really clever.

619
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:12,499
Master Huang.

620
01:08:12,602 --> 01:08:15,799
Stop drinking. You're on duty now!

621
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:19,040
Master Huang, see you later.

622
01:08:19,108 --> 01:08:20,405
Goodbye!

623
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:22,207
Goodbye!

624
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,180
So long...

625
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:45,425
White Tiger! Give yourself up!

626
01:08:45,535 --> 01:08:46,729
We'll get you!

627
01:08:46,903 --> 01:08:48,302
There's no escape!

628
01:08:48,504 --> 01:08:49,698
Be careful!

629
01:09:06,956 --> 01:09:08,947
You just scared me dead!

630
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:10,853
I wouldn't mind
going to the toilet myself.

631
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,359
Yes, me, too.

632
01:09:12,495 --> 01:09:14,087
- Let's go over that side.
- Good.

633
01:09:19,235 --> 01:09:20,429
Let's do it here.

634
01:09:25,408 --> 01:09:26,602
Having a pee?

635
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:28,499
Nonsense!

636
01:09:29,879 --> 01:09:32,279
I feel very sorry to the two of you.

637
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:37,580
When you see Master Huang,
ask him not to be angry with me, please.

638
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,218
- Certainly...
- Not!

639
01:09:57,373 --> 01:09:58,772
"Having a pee is not allowed."

640
01:10:00,076 --> 01:10:02,909
I can piss anywhere cause I'm a cop.

641
01:10:03,012 --> 01:10:05,913
Don't watch me piss!

642
01:10:08,217 --> 01:10:10,208
Stop it!

643
01:10:41,517 --> 01:10:42,506
Mousy!

644
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:44,017
The two bounty hunters are dead.

645
01:10:45,588 --> 01:10:47,579
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

646
01:10:47,757 --> 01:10:50,453
- Where are they?
- Over there!

647
01:10:56,599 --> 01:10:58,590
Must be masked killer!

648
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:00,400
The masked killer?

649
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:05,872
He must be connected
with the opera troupe.

650
01:11:06,275 --> 01:11:08,470
You don't have to tell me.

651
01:11:08,544 --> 01:11:13,948
Just let me know if I can be of service.

652
01:11:14,283 --> 01:11:17,275
No thanks. You're not the Marshal.

653
01:11:17,386 --> 01:11:19,581
I can easily handle this.

654
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:23,884
I've got
all the masked opera singers here!

655
01:11:24,093 --> 01:11:25,890
But who is the murderer?

656
01:11:31,901 --> 01:11:33,596
Shut up!

657
01:11:45,181 --> 01:11:47,581
Speak up! Who's the murderer?

658
01:11:48,985 --> 01:11:50,384
Speak.

659
01:11:56,058 --> 01:11:57,150
You've got the wrong person!

660
01:11:57,326 --> 01:12:00,921
I've got to go!

661
01:12:03,299 --> 01:12:04,596
Cross-eye!

662
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:06,526
Yes, Marshal!

663
01:12:06,602 --> 01:12:10,595
Have you got
all the masked opera singers?

664
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,835
Every single one of them.

665
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:14,465
What about him?

666
01:12:15,711 --> 01:12:17,406
We missed him.

667
01:12:18,581 --> 01:12:20,481
- You fool!
- Yes, Marshal!

668
01:12:20,616 --> 01:12:21,810
Wait here!

669
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:29,189
Wait here!

670
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,753
What are you doing?

671
01:12:37,933 --> 01:12:40,424
Shut up or be arrested!

672
01:12:40,603 --> 01:12:42,093
I can lock you all up!

673
01:12:44,674 --> 01:12:46,869
Is this an uprising or what?

674
01:12:47,243 --> 01:12:49,541
- What's going on?
- Yes, Marshal!

675
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,579
Stupid.

676
01:12:53,249 --> 01:12:54,716
What about my loss?

677
01:13:05,327 --> 01:13:07,727
If you find any one suspicious.

678
01:13:07,863 --> 01:13:11,264
Let me know. You'll get paid for it.

679
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:17,003
They're all crooks!

680
01:13:19,275 --> 01:13:23,371
The murderer is connected
with the opera troupe.

681
01:13:23,546 --> 01:13:24,945
Keep your eyes open for me.

682
01:13:25,047 --> 01:13:26,241
Yes?

683
01:13:29,218 --> 01:13:32,244
There's a newcomer who acts strangely...

684
01:13:32,354 --> 01:13:34,049
Mr. Chiu, it's your turn.

685
01:13:34,223 --> 01:13:35,315
I'm coming!

686
01:13:35,391 --> 01:13:37,086
See me after the show.

687
01:13:37,193 --> 01:13:38,592
I'll tell you more.

688
01:13:43,766 --> 01:13:45,859
I hate Huang,

689
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:50,061
and Huang's suspicious of you.

690
01:13:52,374 --> 01:13:57,175
Let's cooperate.

691
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:04,477
I'll send you
out of the country afterward.

692
01:14:04,887 --> 01:14:09,381
They'll never get you.

693
01:14:09,759 --> 01:14:13,661
But you may not be able
to take Huang single-handed.

694
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:42,755
- Mayor!
- Congratulations!

695
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:45,723
Thanks for coming. Have a seat please!

696
01:14:48,063 --> 01:14:50,861
Have a few more drinks, Marshal.

697
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,798
I'll get myself drunk alright.

698
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:02,506
I've got to see Chiu at the theatre.

699
01:15:02,545 --> 01:15:04,809
- I'll come along.
- Stay here!

700
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:11,377
Ah Foon, but...

701
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,011
But what? You think I'll die?
What are we?

702
01:15:14,156 --> 01:15:15,851
- Friends.
- Right.

703
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:17,949
Take revenge if I die.

704
01:15:19,228 --> 01:15:20,422
What are you doing?

705
01:15:21,797 --> 01:15:23,890
This is my family charm.

706
01:15:24,099 --> 01:15:25,396
Take it.

707
01:15:25,935 --> 01:15:28,335
Superstitious!

708
01:15:30,472 --> 01:15:32,463
Wait for me!

709
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:36,803
Go to hell!

710
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:15,982
Mr. Chiu!

711
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:33,119
Substitution!

712
01:19:24,473 --> 01:19:26,065
Help yourself!

713
01:19:26,175 --> 01:19:29,372
- Buttoms up!
- Master Huang!

714
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:58,803
Huang Fe-hung will be the next!

715
01:19:59,908 --> 01:20:01,500
Help yourself!

716
01:20:23,031 --> 01:20:24,623
Ah Foon!

717
01:20:24,766 --> 01:20:26,165
Ah Foon!

718
01:20:26,969 --> 01:20:32,373
I didn't tell you really to go to hell!

719
01:20:34,009 --> 01:20:37,604
Ah Foon...!

720
01:20:38,514 --> 01:20:40,209
Where did Ah Foon go?

721
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:42,675
The Theatre.

722
01:20:42,818 --> 01:20:44,012
Theatre?

723
01:20:52,161 --> 01:20:54,254
Avenge my death if I die!

724
01:21:20,889 --> 01:21:24,518
The masked killer!

725
01:21:25,494 --> 01:21:26,984
The masked killer!

726
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:30,525
The masked killer!

727
01:21:42,444 --> 01:21:45,038
"Kill him."

728
01:22:27,389 --> 01:22:30,483
The masked killer!

729
01:22:37,799 --> 01:22:39,198
Pao?

730
01:22:49,111 --> 01:22:51,807
What are you doing here, kid?

731
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:53,904
You'll never know why you die.

732
01:22:54,049 --> 01:23:02,548
You want me, not my students.

733
01:23:03,992 --> 01:23:05,789
White Tiger killed him!

734
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:07,326
You harbored a wanted man?

735
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:10,790
Yeah, so what?

736
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:15,194
I want you out of my way!

737
01:23:16,171 --> 01:23:18,071
My school will be famous.

738
01:23:18,173 --> 01:23:21,665
You'll never get away with it.

739
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,701
I'll get you first.

740
01:23:41,029 --> 01:23:42,223
Master Huang.

741
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:14,695
Master Huang, I was wrong.

742
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:16,320
Iet me go!

743
01:24:16,465 --> 01:24:19,161
Give me one more chance!

744
01:24:19,201 --> 01:24:22,432
Let me go, please.

745
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:34,178
I'm sorry, Master Huang.

746
01:24:50,365 --> 01:24:51,457
Mousy, run!

747
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:54,825
I can't leave you now.

748
01:25:10,552 --> 01:25:11,849
The Flying Cuff!

749
01:29:58,606 --> 01:30:00,403
Charge! Get him!

750
01:30:13,421 --> 01:30:18,222
I'll kill you!

751
01:30:19,427 --> 01:30:24,421
Die! You fool!

752
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:30,103
I'll kill you!

753
01:30:30,205 --> 01:30:35,404
Stop it. He's dead.
