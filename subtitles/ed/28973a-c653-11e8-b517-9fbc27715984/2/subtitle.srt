1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:01,443
That punk!

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:07,523
I'll be right back, boss.

3
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:09,561
It's so great eating meat
after so long.

4
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:11,223
Who do we have here?

5
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:15,998
Isn't it our brave police officer?

6
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:20,632
You have time for dating
despite your busy official work?

7
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:21,732
Are these the guys?

8
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:22,799
Huh?

9
00:00:25,177 --> 00:00:27,441
Hey mister.

10
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:31,839
I got no business with you today,
why don't you sit down and eat.

11
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:38,312
Oh, sir! I am almost
scared to death now.

12
00:00:39,224 --> 00:00:40,623
You're lucky to
have a man like him.

13
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,324
Such courage, huh?

14
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:46,026
Hey, say it again.

15
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,891
- Damn!
- Sit down!

16
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:53,429
What are you staring at?

17
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:58,265
Acting the man
in front of your babe?

18
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:00,567
What are you gonna do?

19
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:04,343
Don't worry,
we know them. Go on.

20
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,477
Do you really
wanna fight with me?

21
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:08,041
Sit down and drink.

22
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:12,212
I'm going crazy here.

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,517
And if I want to?

24
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:20,592
If I'm not careful,
I may end up killing you.

25
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,190
Stop!

26
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:27,564
You're really talking
nonsense here.

27
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:30,903
What to do with this little brat?

28
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:34,407
Boss, what do we do with him?

29
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,977
He seems to be
ignorant of manners.

30
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,019
Teach him what
manners are about.

31
00:01:41,086 --> 00:01:42,610
Did you hear?

32
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:45,312
Sang-hwan!

33
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:46,683
You bastard!

34
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:48,350
Hey!

35
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,159
That asshole!

36
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:38,738
You stupid bastard! We'll...

37
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,437
Stay away!

38
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:48,311
Have a drink?

39
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:51,152
Let go!

40
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:01,889
Shithead!

41
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:06,636
Asshole...

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,243
Boss! Are you all right? Boss!

43
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:22,912
Let go, damn it! You shithead...

44
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,606
You have the right
to remain silent.

45
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,944
Stop!

46
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:50,243
You have the right to
choose a lawyer.

47
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:55,346
What the hell are you doing here?

48
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,024
Huh?

49
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:07,090
Come here...!

50
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:10,628
Damn!

51
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:11,600
Come here!

52
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,036
What did I do wrong?

53
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:54,140
Okay, I screwed up.
Let's drop it now, huh?

54
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,978
Didn't you teach me that crap
so I can catch bad guys?

55
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,542
Look, you listen carefully.

56
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:06,147
Some people dedicate
their lives to that crap.

57
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,820
We're not trying to
help you relieve your stress.

58
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:12,997
Then what about me, huh?

59
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:16,130
Do I look like I'm here
because I want to be?

60
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:17,866
- So do you feel better now?
- I feel great.

61
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,564
Yeah, you beat up those guys
like you wanted.

62
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,036
Since we have nothing left
for each other,

63
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,510
let's just split up
before things deteriorate.

64
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,575
And who was the one
that started all this?

65
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:32,281
I have no reason
to see you anymore.

66
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:36,843
And if you need to win so badly,
try winning over yourself first.

67
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,048
Can't even control your own self.

68
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:38,919
Hey!

69
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:45,824
Yeah? I don't need you anymore.
I'm leaving.

70
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:50,768
Sure, I can't do anything right.

71
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:55,330
But damn, the more I think of it,
the angrier I get!

72
00:05:55,607 --> 00:06:00,044
Hey, what did I do wrong?
Where are you?

73
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:05,176
They started the whole thing!

74
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:09,383
Who are you, mister?

75
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:13,013
Did you come here to study, too?

76
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:18,385
Wait a second,
you're that jaywalker...

77
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:19,828
I said, where is Mu-un?

78
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:23,866
I told you he went
to the mountains.

79
00:06:24,402 --> 00:06:26,097
That's not the answer I want.

80
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:29,267
Wait.

81
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:32,473
What are you doing here?
This guy here...

82
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:33,203
Sang-hwan, don't.

83
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:35,474
We're no match for his chi.

84
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:38,414
Hey, mister, what are you...!

85
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:41,709
Who are you, mister?

86
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:44,282
I ask the questions.

87
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:54,397
Eui-jin!

88
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:43,338
Sang-hwan!

89
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:18,446
You should not point
a sword at just anyone.

90
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:20,682
Stop!

91
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:02,082
Stop this right now!

92
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:06,690
Have you lost all decency?

93
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:08,453
Doing this to young kids?

94
00:10:09,894 --> 00:10:11,327
Please, no more killing.

95
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:13,190
- I want the key.
- You monster!

96
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:17,283
You stay here.

97
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:19,296
He's wounded,
this is our chance.

98
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:21,191
We aren't strong enough.

99
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,130
Nonsense!

100
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,164
It's too dangerous alone!

101
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:28,499
Sang-hwan!

102
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:41,412
Let's stop wasting time.

103
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:47,821
Give me the sealed key, and the
Seven Masters need not fight.

104
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:49,793
You don't understand, do you?

105
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:54,228
In this day and age,
even with the power of Arahan,

106
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:56,090
do you think you
can rule the earth?

107
00:11:56,401 --> 00:12:00,770
I just want to create order.

108
00:12:00,838 --> 00:12:01,862
What order?

109
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,202
I have learned just one truth.

110
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:09,044
Only a supreme power
can guarantee peace.

111
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:12,977
You haven't learned that
power shifts with the wind.

112
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:16,077
You wretch!

113
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:45,677
Master!

114
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:46,679
Go back!

115
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:04,552
Master!

116
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:22,379
You'll feel better with some rest.

117
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:30,844
I'm sorry, Dad.

118
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:33,718
I shouldn't have challenged him.

119
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:35,252
It was unavoidable.

120
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:42,029
But was it you who wounded him?

121
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:43,359
No.

122
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:50,769
I think Sang-hwan used
Sound Vibration Technique on him.

123
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:56,803
Was that man one of
the vanished Seven Masters?

124
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:28,103
We have long called enlightened
male masters Maruchi,

125
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:29,696
and women masters Arachi.

126
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:35,607
Maruchi and Arachi, between
mortals and the enlightened,

127
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,207
were entrusted with the key to
attain the state of Arahan.

128
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:43,709
Arahan is an enlightened state
when one has nothing more to learn.

129
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:48,347
To be enlightened on the
principles of all creation,

130
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:52,886
also means you have the power
to rule over the world.

131
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:56,664
Such power may create desire
that leads to huge sacrifice,

132
00:16:56,734 --> 00:17:01,433
so the Seven Masters kept it a
secret from anyone else.

133
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,569
The man who struck Mu-un
is one of those Seven Masters.

134
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,347
Long ago, a man who betrayed
heaven almost got the key.

135
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:21,391
People realized that when a
corrupt man seized hold of the key,

136
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:26,829
unstoppable chaos and evil
spread as a result.

137
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:40,900
Ceaseless greed made children kill
parents, brothers kill brothers.

138
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,047
And yet the enlightened masters
could not intervene in the world,

139
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:53,752
for it was against the
law of nature to do so.

140
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:58,059
Ordinary humans failed
in their quest for peace.

141
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:04,765
Hearing the cries of an orphaned
child, Heug-un broke the covenant

142
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:06,936
and rushed to intervene.

143
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:16,610
Ultimately the flames of war
consumed both worlds.

144
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:25,913
Seduced by the power of the sword,
Heug-un lost his self-control.

145
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:59,919
He decided to become Arahan
himself to bring order to chaos.

146
00:19:02,593 --> 00:19:05,289
But the Masters knew that
Heug-un, full of rage,

147
00:19:05,363 --> 00:19:10,391
would only re-start the
cycle of terror and misery.

148
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:15,497
Until they could find
a true Arahan,

149
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:20,010
they hid the key in their bodies,
and sealed Heug-un underground.

150
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:26,409
But unable to cast off ambition,
Heug-un endured in a wicked chi,

151
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:29,385
preserving his life
and returning to us now.

152
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:34,990
The weight of the key's
chi alone is so great

153
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:38,659
that no ordinary
Tao disciple can bear it.

154
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,664
For me, bearing the key

155
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:45,634
was no ordinary burden.

156
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:51,733
Now it's time that I
let go of this burden.

157
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,543
Welcome.

158
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:55,606
Pull over.

159
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:03,951
Eui-jin, I don't know
what to say, but...

160
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:05,113
Yeah, same here.

161
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:08,283
Seeing what happened to Master Mu-un,
it made me think a lot. But now...

162
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,519
I said pull over!

163
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:15,557
Go wherever you want.

164
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:17,459
Hey, Eui-jin!

165
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:21,761
Hey.

166
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:25,867
Have you gone mad?

167
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:30,310
He may just be
another person to you,

168
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:31,507
but to me, he's a father.

169
00:20:38,722 --> 00:20:40,314
Then what am I?

170
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:42,486
Sang-hwan,

171
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:45,192
don't you get it?

172
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:48,859
Do you still think
you can become Maruchi?

173
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:06,844
If you're not joining in,
will you let go?

174
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:17,025
It was nice knowing you.

175
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:30,100
This is just too much.

176
00:21:35,246 --> 00:21:37,441
It seems we've
a long way to travel.

177
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:41,713
Let's have some tea.

178
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:47,814
It must have been hard,
hiding it all this time.

179
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:58,629
I'm sorry, but I don't
have the key either.

180
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:35,894
Jeez, what am I supposed to do?

181
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:43,244
Hey, wait up!

182
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:05,296
Excuse me.

183
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:51,443
First of all...

184
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:52,709
should we call the
insurance company?

185
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:12,933
Hey, your hand's bleeding!

186
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:15,068
Hold on, let go.
Give me the glasses.

187
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:18,001
Wait, okay okay...

188
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:21,167
Wait... you should calm down first.

189
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:22,875
Wouldn't you be upset?

190
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:26,612
I know how you feel, but this is
something you've trained for.

191
00:24:26,984 --> 00:24:27,450
What?

192
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:29,045
You said to control oneself!

193
00:24:41,198 --> 00:24:42,756
Let's not get worked up.

194
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:47,167
At times like this,
we should try thinking calmly.

195
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:52,207
That guy wants the key, right?

196
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:53,770
Your dad doesn't have it.

197
00:24:54,345 --> 00:24:56,836
All the other Masters were
eliminated because of it!

198
00:24:57,815 --> 00:24:59,612
That's why there's hope.

199
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:01,445
Think about it.

200
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:08,856
He must think your father is the
last one who knows where it is.

201
00:25:08,992 --> 00:25:12,553
Would he just kill someone
like that? No way!

202
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:14,057
Don't worry.

203
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:15,626
Then where do we find him?

204
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:18,195
Now, that's a problem.

205
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:22,399
Are you going to keep
talking nonsense?

206
00:25:23,974 --> 00:25:25,373
Dammit!

207
00:25:27,044 --> 00:25:30,343
I'm trying too.
Are you the only one with a temper?

208
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:33,379
This bugs the hell out of me,
I'm worried too!

209
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:49,992
If those who wish for enlightenment
get a key and stand on this altar,

210
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,557
the path to Nirvana opens.

211
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,261
Eui-jin...

212
00:25:56,673 --> 00:26:01,508
Wasn't the key
connected to this place?

213
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:06,580
The meridian points
in your body are blocked.

214
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:11,451
You'll die unless I take
emergency measures.

215
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:17,894
Don't be stubborn,
surrender the key.

216
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:22,697
Freedom from attachment
means freedom from fear.

217
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:26,763
I'll take on Heug-un,
you look for my father.

218
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:28,931
And then run far away.

219
00:26:29,473 --> 00:26:31,600
- I'll join you soon.
- Wait, Eui-jin!

220
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:36,743
Cripes, she's got
no sense of strategy.

221
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:40,847
I'm telling you, girls should
serve in the military too.

222
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,851
Jeez, are all
museums this complicated?

223
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,131
Impressive that you
found me, wench.

224
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,274
I know you've been
out of touch,

225
00:27:09,346 --> 00:27:12,804
but it's not nice to call
a lady a "wench," asshole!

226
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:13,974
Where is he?

227
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:16,409
Hey, you!

228
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:19,280
Concentrate.

229
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:22,283
Are you in the
broadcasting room?

230
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,324
I don't know where I am, either.

231
00:27:26,497 --> 00:27:28,727
Then how can I find you?

232
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:33,202
Heug-un has corrupted my chi.

233
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:40,801
Don't just use your eyes,
open your five senses.

234
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:42,577
Oh, darn.

235
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,811
Okay then.
I'm not sure where you are,

236
00:27:47,217 --> 00:27:48,707
but... just stay there for now.

237
00:27:50,954 --> 00:27:51,921
Dammit!

238
00:27:58,495 --> 00:27:59,086
This way?

239
00:28:20,484 --> 00:28:21,815
Spread the chi around you.

240
00:28:24,555 --> 00:28:25,385
Prepare for the attack!

241
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:29,183
Concentrate the chi
into a point of light!

242
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,577
Master!

243
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:55,008
Master...

244
00:28:56,887 --> 00:29:01,187
Can you feel my chi?

245
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:34,420
Who told you to come here?

246
00:29:34,992 --> 00:29:38,223
I'm telling you,
you have no sense of strategy.

247
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:39,554
What?

248
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:47,503
Hey, jaywalker!

249
00:29:47,571 --> 00:29:48,162
Cool, huh?

250
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:14,328
I'm the one you want.
Let's rumble.

251
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:20,233
Master Heug-un.

252
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:28,272
Without renouncing attachment,
the key leads to self-destruction.

253
00:30:29,212 --> 00:30:30,543
Times have changed.

254
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:34,810
Let's leave the key
with these youngsters.

255
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:43,391
A sword can slaughter a pig,
or cut through the world.

256
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:50,658
Power comes to
the man who can wield it.

257
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:10,107
Renounce all...

258
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:13,985
The things we see are just the
shadow of things we can't.

259
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:16,416
Renounce all...

260
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:34,443
One who aspires to be Maruchi
must renounce all his desires,

261
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:38,808
and the door to
enlightenment will open.

262
00:37:28,865 --> 00:37:31,390
The moment you renounce yourself,

263
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:36,368
you feel a true freedom
that exists between earth and sky,

264
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:42,535
it is then that you
can command gravity.

265
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:46,277
In the act of going,
you find understanding.

266
00:37:47,283 --> 00:37:51,117
And in the constant practice,
you find enlightenment.

267
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:54,315
The moment that
you command your ego,

268
00:37:55,391 --> 00:37:58,724
the gate of
Arachi's heart will open,

269
00:38:01,564 --> 00:38:04,658
and you will become Maruchi.

270
00:39:13,469 --> 00:39:16,029
What's all this blood?

271
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,030
Hey, mister!

272
00:39:22,078 --> 00:39:23,909
My stomach hurts!

273
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:29,385
That key doesn't
seem to fit you.

274
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:34,188
And you're in
the wrong spot!

275
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:19,452
Tired already, mister?

276
00:42:05,975 --> 00:42:06,703
Another round?

277
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:27,039
Give up, you...

278
00:45:29,078 --> 00:45:31,046
But know this...

279
00:45:33,716 --> 00:45:37,618
Nature did not
abandon the world,

280
00:45:37,687 --> 00:45:39,518
it is the world that
abandoned nature.

281
00:45:41,524 --> 00:45:45,358
The tao never
abandoned people,

282
00:45:45,428 --> 00:45:47,521
it was people
who abandoned tao.

283
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:54,235
As long as there is a path,
there will be people following it.

284
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:51,324
Eui-jin! Eui-jin!

285
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:00,228
Hey, wake up!

286
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:16,780
- Eui-jin, bring me the dye.
- Yes.

287
00:47:21,457 --> 00:47:22,685
Can you empty this?

288
00:47:23,192 --> 00:47:24,181
Yes.

289
00:47:34,303 --> 00:47:34,894
Excuse me!

290
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:38,634
I'll just run to the bank...

291
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:53,984
Huh, it's the police!

292
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,257
You guys are such a pain.

293
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,230
You're breaking my heart.

294
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:21,975
Freeze!

295
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:35,719
Bong... Officer Bong!

296
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:37,824
Officer Bong!

297
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:40,291
Are you okay, Officer Bong?

298
00:48:40,936 --> 00:48:44,394
Corporal Yoo, I tried my...

299
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:50,343
When are you gonna
learn to shoot a Palm Blast?

300
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,147
Hey, let's see you try it
at a moving person!

301
00:48:54,717 --> 00:48:56,344
Try doing it just like before.

302
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:57,444
Look!

303
00:48:58,521 --> 00:49:01,115
Look over there. You shot
at him, and what happened?

304
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:02,115
Haven't you learned...

305
00:49:02,558 --> 00:49:03,525
I was looking over here!

306
00:49:03,592 --> 00:49:06,425
Look what happened
to Officer Bong!

307
00:49:06,662 --> 00:49:10,723
You learned it way before me,
can't you do it right?

308
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,360
Hey, I usually do fine.
You wanna see?

309
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:19,607
Anyone can do it in practice.
It's real situations that count.

310
00:49:19,675 --> 00:49:22,803
Did you see me shoot back there?

311
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:25,938
Yeah, I saw it.
You think you're good, but...

312
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,848
Just quit it, okay?

313
00:49:28,918 --> 00:49:32,445
Shouldn't you take him
to an acupuncturist?

314
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,356
That kid Sang-hwan called.

315
00:50:08,424 --> 00:50:09,789
There will be a police raid today.

316
00:50:09,859 --> 00:50:10,757
A raid?

317
00:50:11,694 --> 00:50:12,592
See you later, Dad!

318
00:50:13,295 --> 00:50:14,387
Eui-jin, wait!

319
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:18,195
Is this place illegal?

320
00:50:18,634 --> 00:50:21,432
Oh, don't worry.

321
00:50:21,503 --> 00:50:26,031
We were recommended this place.
They're better than Hippocrates!

322
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:27,439
Sang-hwan said there
will be a raid today.

323
00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:30,000
Anyway, go to the storehouse

324
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,014
and take some of the
cheapest aphrodisiacs to him.

325
00:50:33,082 --> 00:50:34,481
Jeez, I'm busy today!

326
00:50:36,285 --> 00:50:38,981
Careful on your way home at night...

327
00:50:41,056 --> 00:50:44,048
Why are there so many raids?
