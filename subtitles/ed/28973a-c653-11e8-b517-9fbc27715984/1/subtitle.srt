4
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,685
People are so naive.

5
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,688
Training in the mountains?

6
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,323
All those instructors
chasing kids' pocket money,

7
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,329
saying they did mountain training.
It's all just crap.

8
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,762
Right.

9
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:09,131
Remember in '88 when I
went to Mt. Gyeryong?

10
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,534
You get up five or six
in the morning.

11
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:16,473
Let's see, what for breakfast?
Preparing and eating takes 2 hours.

12
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,842
And then maybe
train for 1-2 hours.

13
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,540
And then it's lunch time.

14
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,481
So go down to the village
to get some lunch.

15
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,246
That's another 3 hours.

16
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,818
So, eat lunch and meditate.

17
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,120
Then you start nodding off.

18
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,491
Next thing you know it's dinner.

19
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,389
So you got 3 hours of
training max in a day.

20
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:44,335
So where's the only place
to get proper training?

21
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,065
The temple.

22
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,506
Yeah, shave off your head and
your house becomes a temple!

23
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:54,104
Does all that training give
you the right to eat meat?

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,911
Look here, how can you do
martial arts without nutrition?

25
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,281
You need strength.

26
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,547
What exactly do you do
with all that strength?

27
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,148
I can't believe
this asinine nonsense!

28
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,389
Kids these days don't even
know the meaning of tao.

29
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,820
You guys know how
serious our situation is?

30
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,197
Don't be so serious,
we gotta make a living.

31
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,236
Let's use our brain
to think, for once!

32
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,631
Forget Maruchi (supreme master),
no one wants to learn the tao.

33
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,804
Lady Banya, making
a living is one thing,

34
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,370
Telephone fortune-telling
service is another!

35
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:34,250
Ooh, listen to him! You know how
much money 1-700 service makes?

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,587
1-700 is a sign of the times.
You don't know crap.

37
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,995
Besides, how else would you
pay rent for Mu-un Academy?

38
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,192
Yeah, Banya's right.

39
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,328
We gotta go with
the flow, you know?

40
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,929
Academy, my ass!

41
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,872
We ain't got no
kids to teach!

42
00:02:55,942 --> 00:03:02,814
Well, I've been saying we
should pull some public stunt...

43
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:07,410
Like maybe appearing
on a TV show.

44
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:12,754
I'm tired of staring at
the wallpaper when I levitate.

45
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,218
I levitate only to change the light bulb.

What the heck?

54
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,494
Oh, sorry.

55
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,100
Eui-jin, snap out of it, will you?

56
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,408
Uh, can I go to the restroom?

57
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,341
Are you running off again?

58
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,266
What the hell is he doing?

59
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,933
Dumbass.

60
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,309
Excuse me.

61
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,009
What?

62
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,482
You ran a red light, sir.

63
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:52,614
So what?

64
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,281
Your license, please.

65
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,213
Huh?

66
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,120
Look, do you know who this is?

67
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:02,917
I don't recall.

68
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,657
You dumbass...

69
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,157
He's the congressman
of this district.

70
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,266
Oh, how are you, sir?

71
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,667
But he's not the one
who ran the light, is he?

72
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:20,437
You're the driver,
so give me your license.

73
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,714
Boy, which
station do you work at?

74
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,147
Why do you need to know that?

75
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,616
If you don't want a ticket,
then don't run red lights.

76
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,188
My purse! My purse!

77
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:38,158
Hold it! Stay right here,
I'll be back in a minute.

78
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,104
Hey!

79
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:59,015
Hey mister,
watch where you drive!

80
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,453
What's up with
Manager Lee these days?

81
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,595
Stop right there!

82
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,861
Gosh, we're late!

83
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,356
What the hell?

84
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:25,765
Hey!

85
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,805
Do I have to keep running
around after punks like you?

86
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,006
What the heck is your problem?

87
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,004
Watch it!

88
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,579
Hand over the purse, kiddo.

89
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,748
And who are you?

90
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,453
Stop fooling around!

91
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,305
Missed again...

92
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,075
Hey, where are you going?

93
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,447
Get back here!

94
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,114
Wait.

95
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,811
Where are you going, huh? Hey! Hey!

96
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,945
Where are you going?

97
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,049
I think it's this meridian point...

98
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,423
Aren't you going in too deep?

99
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,895
Let me concentrate!

100
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:32,102
If we don't do this right,
it could make him impotent.

101
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:42,177
The last one...
in the Main Meridian Point...

102
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,279
Great Tao!

103
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,389
He opened all the
meridian points himself!

104
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,818
My, this kid has
extraordinary chi.

105
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:55,883
Look at him!

106
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,425
What's all the fuss about?

107
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,102
Uh, Eui-jin.

108
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,138
What's wrong with him?

109
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,133
Oh, we unblocked
the flow of his chi.

110
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,970
Tell him to shut up.

111
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,677
Hey, where'd you find that kid?

112
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,077
Everybody calm down!

113
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,739
Okay, okay.

114
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,114
Don't move, mister! I'm a cop!

115
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,415
- Don't move!
- I'm a cop! I said...

116
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,216
Calm down.

117
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,348
Man, this kid is cute.

118
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,391
Hey, boy!

119
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,324
He's got a cute dong, too.

120
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,725
- Damn...
- Aunt!

121
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,263
Stop! I'm the police!
POLICE!

122
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:33,830
You've done it!

123
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,330
- Wait a minute.
- Damn, this sucks.

124
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,633
- It still works.
- Which point did you hit?

125
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:48,372
It may be hard to believe, but the
world has secret currents of chi.

126
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:54,249
We awaken this chi and guide
people toward righteousness.

127
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,255
So to speak.

128
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,356
So you gentlemen...
and this madam here,

129
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,957
Are called the Seven Masters, right?

130
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,799
But there are only five of you.

131
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,237
With only five, you should be...

132
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,330
Power Rangers?

133
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,400
Right, Power Rangers or...

134
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,375
Five Lucky Stars?

135
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,742
Yes, Five Lucky Stars!

136
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,509
Wouldn't that be
more appropriate?

137
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:28,019
It's already been 20 years...

138
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,387
...since Baek-pung left us.

139
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:40,960
In an era when the powerful
exploited the powerless,

140
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:48,029
Baek-pung gathered up all his chi
to block the force of evil...

141
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,067
...but he inhaled
too much tear gas...

142
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,941
- And as for the seventh...
- Um...

143
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,182
I think you may
have misunderstood...

144
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,447
Don't call me madam,
I'm still a virgin.

145
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:08,151
Shut your mouth...

146
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,224
Then, are all of you here...

147
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,929
...like, tao masters?
You know, like you see on TV?

148
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,300
Sure!

149
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,874
I'm having a hard time
believing this,

150
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:28,880
so could you show me some stuff?
Like, can you levitate?

151
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,207
Can you walk on walls?

152
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,023
Can you do a Palm Blast?

153
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,030
Dammit!

154
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,356
No Palm Blasts in
the house, I said!

155
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,269
Hold on!

156
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,238
But I got to work!

157
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,898
What you saw right now,
is only the beginning.

158
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,966
Why are you afraid of
your own ability?

159
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,908
What ability?
What are you talking about?

160
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,570
Please leave me alone.

161
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:44,480
You have the most powerful chi
of all the young men I have met.

162
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:50,253
The wounds you sustained today
would've felled ordinary people.

163
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,092
All right, fine.

164
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,701
If that's true,
I should be able to do a Palm Blast.

165
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,765
And walk on walls, like this?

166
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,380
And levitate, isn't that right?

167
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,251
Cripes, that was weird.

168
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,915
Pretty spooky stuff.

169
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,006
Ah, what a nice night!

170
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,337
It's downhill,
so I might as well run.

171
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,770
What a strange guy.

172
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,015
But did you see him levitate?

173
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:25,181
Sometimes chi just comes out
by itself after you unblock it.

174
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,451
Or was it his chi?

175
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:30,222
Actually, I did a
Palm Blast back there.

176
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,628
Why'd you shoot
at the window?

177
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,723
It's broken again!

178
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,700
I shot at the wall.

179
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,125
"Daily Report"

180
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,192
Hey, you!

181
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,230
You can't catch thieves,
but you ticket the congressman?

182
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,300
You think we're some kind
of citizens' group?

183
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,173
Yes!

184
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,849
Get him out of my sight. Go!

185
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,447
Courtesy!

186
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,718
Hey, does he really
plan on being a cop?

187
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,961
Nobody saw it.

188
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:08,398
Who will believe you were
knocked out for a full day?

189
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,096
- Oh, about that...
- Look here.

190
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,800
It's important to run,
but even more important,

191
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,468
is to run when people
are watching.

192
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,307
- But yesterday...
- I repeat.

193
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,869
- Hey, quiet.
- Fighting is reported at Jaru Karaoke.

194
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,110
Officers in the area,
report immediately.

195
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:34,718
If you don't know, I can show you.

196
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,357
Or you can bring your boss here.

197
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,663
Hey!

198
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:59,446
Look who's here!
It's Sheriff Choi.

199
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,853
Oh, Mr. Gang!

200
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,685
I was wondering who
was causing trouble again.

201
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,090
Why are you doing this to me?

202
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,390
Where have you been these days?

203
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,829
I've been busy too.
You think I play around all day?

204
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,027
And if something's up,
just call me directly.

205
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,036
Let's avoid the reports, okay?

206
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,935
- Sorry about that.
- Officer Choi...

207
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,769
Should we start our inspection?

208
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,674
No, no. Don't bother.

209
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,510
So Mr. Gang, are things
just about sorted out?

210
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,446
Yeah, sure.

211
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:35,613
And come visit our club
with your boys sometime.

212
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,087
You must have time for a drink?

213
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,648
Ah... well, I...

214
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,854
Anyway, I'll leave you in charge.
And Mr. Gang...

215
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,865
- Keep it down next time, ok?
- Okay, okay.

216
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,366
- See you later.
- Okay.

217
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,561
- Bye.
- Bye.

218
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,534
But Officer Choi,
how can we just leave?

219
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,672
Hey, if we stir things up here,
it'll just cause more trouble.

220
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,742
Come on.

221
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,519
Please show me your ID.

222
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,649
What the hell?

223
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,018
I said show me your ID.

224
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,655
Hey, what's with this guy?

225
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,121
You wanna get pounded?

226
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,425
Wait a second, Mr. Gang!

227
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,431
This guy here, he's new...

228
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:25,334
- I'm really disappointed in you.
- But he...

229
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,435
How are you training these kids?

230
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,736
What's going on here?

231
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:33,107
These dumb thugs scare you?
Why are you groveling?

232
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,304
What was that?

233
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,976
- Wait, let me talk to him.
- Get over here!

234
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,414
Mr. Gang!

235
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,918
What did you say now?

236
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,111
Wait a second.

237
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,847
"Why are you groveling?"

238
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,786
Before that!

239
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,188
"Do they scare you?"

240
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,719
- Before that!
- Wait, let me...

241
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,092
Dumb thugs!

242
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,491
I can't believe this.

243
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,033
- What are you...
- You bastard.

244
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:58,561
On your knees!

245
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,402
Hey, hey. Let me go.

246
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,237
On your knees, bastard!

247
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,936
On your knees!

248
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,639
Let go, let go!

249
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,877
Look, blockhead. You think
we're just neighborhood punks?

250
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,442
- Mr. Gang! Mr. Gang!
- You think we're pushovers?

251
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,583
Let go! Hey! Mr. Gang! Mr. Gang!

252
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,957
- Pick him up!
- Let go...

253
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,665
Why are you doing this?

254
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,722
Why am I doing this?

255
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,303
What are you looking at, huh?

256
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,967
What are you looking at!

257
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,102
You staring at me?
You staring at me?

258
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:48,553
You staring at me?
You staring at me?

259
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,215
Go ahead, bastard. Go ahead!

260
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,521
Stare, you bastard!

261
00:19:55,727 --> 00:20:00,096
Officer, son of a bitch?

262
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,235
Take this, asshole.

263
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,570
"Why are you doing this?"

264
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,437
Why are you doing this?

265
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,601
Bastard!

266
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,169
Asshole!

267
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,340
Wipe it clean.

268
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,943
Wipe it clean, I said!

269
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,958
Spit-shine... with your tongue.

270
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,494
What? Are they too dirty for you?

271
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,475
That's the way the world is.

272
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,887
If you push too hard, it breaks.

273
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,351
Let's have a drink tonight.

274
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,038
You...

275
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,304
...have the right to remain silent.

276
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,347
You have the right to
choose a lawyer...

277
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,995
The problem with me is that...

278
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,193
I can't fight.

279
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,838
They hit me.

280
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,442
That's the problem.

281
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,611
That's the problem.

282
00:21:55,881 --> 00:22:00,477
The fact that I can't fight...
that's the damn problem!

283
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:01,811
What the hell?

284
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,450
What the hell's your problem?

285
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,612
Are you drunk?

286
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,732
Officer Yoo,
you can do better, right?

287
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:18,792
Yes, sir!

288
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,032
Don't go around getting beat up.

289
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,506
Sorry, sir!

290
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,637
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

291
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,037
Come in early tomorrow!

292
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,481
Goodnight, sir! Courtesy!

293
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,086
What?

294
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,466
Oh, don't you remember me?

295
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,199
Good morning!

296
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,836
Ah yes, this yogurt...

297
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:31,342
I'm sorry, suddenly
I was so thirsty...

298
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:39,248
I always hate it when people
steal yogurt from our front step.

299
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,911
I'm so sorry...

300
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,187
Last time, after the acupuncture,

301
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,249
I never got a chance
to say thanks,

302
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,760
so I thought, gosh, I better visit,
but then I never got the chance...

303
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,666
But today I happened
to be walking by,

304
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:02,430
and I thought... are they home?
So I stopped in.

305
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:07,274
So is everyone healthy,
wealthy, and happy?

306
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,058
Wow, what a cool place!

307
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,929
This is the altar of divinity.

308
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:35,638
If those seeking enlightenment
stand on this altar with a key,

309
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:36,969
the path to Nirvana opens.

310
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,306
Have you heard
about Yongsan?

311
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,748
Yongsan Electronics Market?

312
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,780
Have a seat.

313
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:56,783
Yongsan is where the chi of
dragon and mountain intertwine.

314
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:03,265
But people who coveted
the powerful chi of this place

315
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,963
began building
there indiscriminately,

316
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:09,438
until the very altar
was buried underground.

317
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:14,636
Fortunately, when Army Headquarters
were rebuilt as a war memorial,

318
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,648
the remains of the
altar were discovered.

319
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,480
Excavation has been
going on for years.

320
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,184
Do you follow?

321
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,748
Um, sure...

322
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,990
I didn't know tao masters
trained at Yongsan.

323
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,293
It's not a training camp,
it's an altar.

324
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,427
Sure, I got it.

325
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,365
Still...

326
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:47,374
You know... what I mean is...

327
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,795
My, the tea's hot.

328
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:14,328
If I learn all that,
will I be a good fighter?

329
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,300
Hey.

330
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,305
We don't teach you
how to brawl here.

331
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,005
What are you thinking, Dad?

332
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,383
What makes you think
this dork can become Maruchi?

333
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,828
Your daughter has a sharp tongue.

334
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,029
Uh, Master...

335
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,735
How much do you charge
for learning Palm Blast?

336
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:59,916
Well, it depends, I guess,
on the scale of the blast.

337
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:04,846
Don't you have anything else?

338
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,053
Suit yourself.

339
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,532
You see those people working up there?

340
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,895
They are using light-body skills.

341
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,531
Construction workers
often practice them.

342
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,242
You remember the woman who
caught an armed bank robber?

343
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,807
A lot of people
were stunned by that.

344
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:37,655
Where do you think
she got the strength?

345
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,249
She's just an ordinary person.

346
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:48,028
Many skilled people reach the
state of master without knowing.

347
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,839
There are countless masters today.

348
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:04,909
They've just adjusted
to a changing world.

349
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:16,458
But most are tao disciples
who fight against evil chi.

350
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:28,137
The Seven Masters seek a
leader among such people,

351
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,869
who can restore the flow
of pure chi to the world.

352
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:37,042
Then the Seven Masters
can't do a Palm Blast?

353
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,231
That's weird.

354
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,358
Is this the right place?

355
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,424
I think it's there.

356
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,428
Do I have to do
this every day?

357
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,407
It's leaking a lot.

358
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,310
What a mess...

359
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,869
We should talk to
whoever built this wall.

360
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,081
It's so damp here.

361
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,941
Hey, come check this out.

362
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,545
What is it?

363
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,446
There's a noise.

364
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,046
What the heck?

365
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,922
You hear it?

366
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,398
What's that?

367
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,015
Isn't this a little too much?

368
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:24,948
Couldn't we add
a fried egg or something?

369
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,186
I'm not a rabbit,
how can I live off these plants?

370
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,187
During Tao training,
one must eat vegetarian.

371
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:31,827
Isn't that common sense?

372
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,094
Okay, I'll give you that.

373
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,402
But my arms! They're all tied up!

374
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:41,029
Look at my arms!

375
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,369
Tao training is a form of study.

376
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:46,433
You can concentrate better on
an empty stomach.

377
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,008
This is all to teach you sincerity.

378
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:56,016
But why is it just me tied up
when you and this girl here...

379
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:56,951
Hey you!

380
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:01,555
You came here on your own to
learn, but you've got no respect.

381
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,927
Try behaving yourself.

382
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:10,127
Did you even
finish high school?

383
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,203
I graduated from
technical college, at least.

384
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:20,266
What?

385
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,205
The fire went out.

386
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,789
Damn, I can't take this any more.

387
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,219
It's too much!

388
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:40,753
You tell me to clean and I clean,
now I'm doing laundry.

389
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,959
I stood on my head
like you told me.

390
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,559
When are you going
to teach me Palm Blast?

391
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:50,665
Look, boy! Tao training
is a form of study.

392
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,776
Forget study, when
do I learn to fight?

393
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,610
If you want to learn to brawl,
go somewhere else!

394
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:58,713
Try boxing.

395
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,344
All right, all right.

396
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,552
But still, isn't there any way
I can learn how to do a Palm Blast?

397
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,956
"No Palm Blast Indoors"

398
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,871
We'll need to examine more later,

399
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,969
but it looks like it's from
the Koryo Dynasty at the latest.

400
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,741
And the shapes
made of iron spikes?

401
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:34,217
It looks like an indicator
of battle formations.

402
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,752
Battle formations?

403
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,416
During wars with Japan, General Lee
arranged troops in a wing shape.

404
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,186
I'm sure you've heard of them.

405
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,820
These spikes indicate the
formation of soldiers.

406
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:45,857
Inspector,

407
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,032
a phone call for you.

408
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,332
The old man found
at the site has disappeared.

409
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:13,618
We need to make a profit
before we go contributing money.

410
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,391
These days the goods
I was supposed to send to Japan

411
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,521
are being held at customs,
and I can't do anything.

412
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,565
So first, bring over the goods.
That's right.

413
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,603
Just a sec. Go away.

414
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,833
Go! It's nothing.

415
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:39,244
I'll call you back in a sec.

416
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,811
Are you crazy, old man?

417
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:45,919
What the hell?

418
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,338
Who the hell are you?

419
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,411
- How about some freebie?
- What more do you want?

420
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,040
- Can't you go any cheaper?
- Go somewhere else.

421
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:57,079
All confrontations begin
and end with the eyes.

422
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,248
Like in The Art of War.

423
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:04,420
It's the best way to win a
confrontation without fighting.

424
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,493
It's winning mastery
with the eyes.

425
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,543
Don't think you'll get a discount
staring at me like that!

426
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,380
You said you'd teach me, but you
haven't taught me anything.

427
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,190
Are you starving these days?

428
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,457
I'm not starving!

429
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:45,030
If it's too hard for you,
try another job.

430
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:49,265
You get beat up all the time,
and now you don't even eat?

431
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,470
How will you find a wife?

432
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,468
I told you I'm not starving!

433
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:58,005
- When a man does important things...
- Dad's asleep, be quiet.

434
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,350
Mom, you don't know anything!

435
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,650
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

436
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,521
I'm Kim Su-chul of
"Find the Master!"

437
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,790
I'm Kim Hyo-seon.

438
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,222
We have a big
audience today, don't we?

439
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,960
- Yes.
- This is great.

440
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,399
- Hyo-seon.
- Yes?

441
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,437
Have you heard that lately,

442
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,371
because of our program
"Find the Master,"

443
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,569
many people visit
the ophthalmologist?

444
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,475
Why is that?

445
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,104
Their eyes popped out
in anticipation.

446
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:37,815
In general this type
of thing is prohibited.

447
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:43,217
But young people just
have no interest in tao...

448
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,223
We have two guests here.

449
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,665
Quite an unusual name, yes?
Brother Yuk-bong,

450
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:51,667
and Master Sul-woon.

451
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,636
We're glad to have you.
Please come out.

452
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,234
Wow, they look impressive.

453
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,603
- Don't they?
- Yeah.

454
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,611
It's a great honor
to have you here.

455
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,737
Yes, nice to meet you.

456
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,782
It must have been
difficult to come here.

457
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,286
Wait a sec.

458
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,110
This is so heavy,
are these rocks?

459
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:15,784
Oh, yes. On crowded sidewalks,

460
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,591
I walk so fast that
I often bump into people.

461
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:24,328
I'm fine, but I worry
that I'll hurt people,

462
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,336
so I walk with these stones.

463
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:30,602
Oh, you must be really fast.

464
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,599
You must've transported here by magic?

465
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,703
I took the #77 bus.

466
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,743
Ah, yes.

467
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:41,312
Well, yes, we heard about you,

468
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:42,909
and I'm quite curious,

469
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:47,686
and I'm sure our many guests
want to see it as well.

470
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,885
So let's see you perform.

471
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,452
A show of extraordinary force,
the very site of destruction!

472
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:28,988
After training in the mountains,
it may be intimidating on TV.

473
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,762
Let's give them
a show of support!

474
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,741
Let go!

475
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,750
Stop, now!

476
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,854
This can't be!

477
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,188
- Well... I mean, master,
- It's over.

478
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,219
Please calm down.
Oh, sorry, I...

479
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,788
Let me put this in perspective.

480
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:09,102
The technique we've shown you
is extremely difficult.

481
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:14,008
For an ordinary person,
this is really hard to split.

482
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,052
You wanna die?

483
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,159
Sorry.

484
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,523
Be on time.

485
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:43,717
God, she even reads
martial arts comics.

486
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:48,025
What, she has makeup?
Does she use this stuff?

487
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,562
What is this?

488
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,069
Beauty Academy

489
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,167
Huh?

490
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,841
She wasn't bad-Looking
in high school either...

491
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,479
A birthday photo.

492
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,649
Wait, it's on April 17?

493
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:15,984
Wait a second.

494
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,225
That's coming up soon.

495
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:28,298
Martial arts are for supressing
violence, for stopping conflict,

496
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,863
and for avoiding cruelty.

497
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:37,910
This is the truth
all martial arts aspire to.

498
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:45,151
Only the truly powerful can defend
by anticipating an opponent.

499
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,354
Let's see. Try to hit Eui-jin.

500
00:43:55,733 --> 00:44:00,170
Urr... the, the best defense
is offense, of course.

501
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:08,272
Those who want self-control
must learn mind control.

502
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,746
To serve others, not to win,

503
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,674
is the true, unbreakable strength.

504
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,582
To achieve this
you must renounce yourself.

505
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,558
Hey.

506
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:30,964
Do it right.

507
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,204
Suppleness is
to follow force.

508
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:43,406
To use the enemy's force
to beat him.

509
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,745
One who follows force
has no fear.

510
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:02,326
Merit is earned by
training without fakery.

511
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,924
Fist-fighting is
refined and simple.

512
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:07,163
The changes are unpredictable,

513
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,967
so you must learn to move
your body as you wish.

514
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:15,275
The body and mind are one.
To control your mind,

515
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,340
you must control the body.

516
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,849
Shut up and do it.

517
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,512
Hey, wait!

518
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,817
I said wait... wait...

519
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,783
This is too much.

520
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,142
Swiftness means fast, got it?

521
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:52,573
The fist has a form,
but hitting has no form.

522
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:59,449
In other words, you gotta
learn the laws of nature.

523
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:05,990
If I'm faster than others,
it means others are slower than me.

524
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:29,315
Sang-hwan, are you crazy?

525
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:32,947
- Mom!
- What do you have against
the eggs, you do it?

526
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,152
Bravery is not to hesitate.

527
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,656
To move in when
you see an opportunity.

528
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:47,601
Time seems to flow
equally for everyone,

529
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,372
yet with concentration,

530
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:55,571
a fleeting moment can
stretch into eternity.

531
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:39,679
Slashing is to give damage
to others without mercy.

532
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:43,322
But if you can't
control your emotion,

533
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,953
you might end up staining yourself.

534
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:50,524
Wounds on the body
may easily be healed,

535
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:55,095
but emotional scars do not
go away so easily.

536
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:16,320
Finally, truthfulness is to strike
and defend without deception.

537
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:22,023
Having reached the point
of truthful selflessness,

538
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,860
you eventually gain enlightenment.

539
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,739
What happens
after enlightenment?

540
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,514
First learn what comes before, kid.

541
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,114
Hello?

542
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,680
Is this Seung-gu?
It's me, Sang-hwan.

543
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,885
Yeah, did all of you guys
get together tonight?

544
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:57,131
Hey, I'm done,
so I'll come over there now.

545
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,762
Oh, it's fine with me.

546
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,168
But, it's okay...

547
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,846
Oh, really?
Then I'll see you guys next time.

548
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,711
OK, and give me a ring.

549
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:18,519
Anytime. Yeah, sure, sure.

550
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:29,627
Hey mister!

551
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,968
What are you doing, mister?

552
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,735
How can you just
jaywalk like that,

553
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,970
It's not even 4 lanes,
it's an 8-lane road.

554
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:45,481
Mister, you may
be busy, but still...

555
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,972
Show me your ID, please.

556
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:00,526
Nice to meet you.

557
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:04,233
I'm Officer Yoo,
servant to the public.

558
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,234
So...

559
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,467
Show me your ID, please.

560
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:16,411
Hey, look here mister!

561
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:18,776
Hey, mister!

562
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,376
Gosh, mister. Stop there!

563
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:23,782
You over there!

564
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,602
You crazy idiot, what the hell?

565
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:41,468
You aren't hurt, are you?

566
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,842
Why's he running away like that?

567
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,138
Where is he running to?

568
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,046
Damn it.

569
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:54,276
What are you doing?

570
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,251
Well, I think I'm fine.

571
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,152
What an idiot.

572
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,659
What's this?

573
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:10,726
Hey you, stop!

574
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,292
Wait, I said stop!

575
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,712
I can't believe it.

576
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,752
Now everyone knows us.

577
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:08,348
Tell me about it, the manager was
in a rage over last week's show.

578
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:12,293
But I kept telling him, splitting
wood is not martial arts.

579
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,489
By the way, should we contact
another place?

580
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:19,927
I guess so.
Gosh, it makes me nervous.

581
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,563
We're not some kind
of traveling circus.

582
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,800
Huh? That's a fearsome chi.

583
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:35,078
It can't be...

584
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,544
How did he get out...

585
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,480
Who is carrying the key?

586
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,940
Ever since
we found them,

587
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,283
they have kept the
exact same position.

588
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:14,682
Have they ever shown
this kind of symptom before?

589
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:21,086
All 72 meridian points
have been blocked.

590
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:22,490
Yes?

591
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:30,535
Their chi has been corrupted.

592
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:40,874
I've been trying so hard,
why isn't there any big improvement?

593
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:46,485
This isn't a computer game,
this is for real.

594
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,717
Of course not, but...

595
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,854
That guy's light-body skills
were really fantastic.

596
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,236
How many times
do I have to tell you?

597
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:01,428
What?

598
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,973
When you really fight,
chi is what matters, not skills.

599
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:09,034
- I'm not talking about chi...
- You have to beat him with chi.

600
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,841
Yeah... I just don't
have any confidence.

601
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,580
When somebody says,
"Let's fight,"

602
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:23,450
then you say, 'OK, but I may
end up killing you."

603
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:24,254
Did you learn this
to kill somebody?

604
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,692
If you don't...

605
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,389
Forget it.

606
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:30,756
Hey!

607
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:31,959
What now?

608
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:37,730
Here.

609
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:39,966
What's this?

610
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,408
It's your birthday...

611
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:42,704
How did you know?

612
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,841
I know everything...

613
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:49,876
I go by the lunar calendar.

614
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:53,985
Thanks anyway.

615
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,797
She is so cold.

616
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,335
Hey Sang-hwan,
what the hell is this?

617
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,431
Student ID
Beauty Academy

618
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,376
What?

619
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,948
Do cops enjoy spying on people?

620
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:20,974
Who said to spy on me?

621
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,978
You're really overreacting.

622
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:31,426
I... I did this for you,
aren't you even thankful?

623
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:40,901
Just concentrate
on your own life, okay?

624
00:56:17,355 --> 00:56:18,049
Eat up.

625
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,127
Hey, what's up?
Are you buying me dinner now?

626
00:56:26,698 --> 00:56:29,690
Mu-un said you drag
your body around,

627
00:56:29,768 --> 00:56:32,032
so he said to buy you
some meat for strength.

628
00:56:34,372 --> 00:56:34,997
Oh!

629
00:56:39,878 --> 00:56:40,401
Here.

630
00:56:42,247 --> 00:56:42,941
What's this?

631
00:56:43,882 --> 00:56:48,512
Master Mu-un said you've got nothing,
but you're full of pride.

632
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:51,621
He said to look at this
when your temper flares up.

633
00:56:52,557 --> 00:56:53,148
Here.

634
00:57:07,138 --> 00:57:10,437
Honestly, is it really from Master Mu-un?

635
00:57:11,509 --> 00:57:14,000
What? You think it's from me?

636
00:57:20,251 --> 00:57:23,482
Miss, our flame's out.
Can you change the fuel?

637
00:57:23,555 --> 00:57:24,817
Don't bother her.

638
00:57:31,162 --> 00:57:32,390
Can't you see she's busy?

639
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:36,092
Hey, you can't do that here...

640
00:57:36,367 --> 00:57:37,334
It's okay.

641
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:47,301
Hey, can you do me a favor?

642
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:51,180
Is there any way you can
teach me this Palm Blast thing?

643
00:57:53,017 --> 00:57:54,848
Get a grip, will you?

644
00:58:38,263 --> 00:58:42,097
Welcome to the world
of fortune telling.

645
00:58:42,634 --> 00:58:48,573
Curious about your future?
I'm not available to take your call.

646
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,107
So those in a hurry
please try the 1-700 number.

647
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:52,306
Banya isn't answering either.

648
00:58:55,446 --> 00:58:57,505
Heug-un must
surely want the key?

649
00:58:58,883 --> 00:58:59,645
What should we do?

650
00:59:03,488 --> 00:59:05,046
Would you take it?

651
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:08,222
What are you talking about?

652
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:11,023
We should solve this together,
don't try to avoid it.

653
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:13,897
Our power is lacking.

654
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:18,229
To fight Heug-un, we
need at least three of us.

655
00:59:19,337 --> 00:59:23,171
I've carried the key too long,
waiting for Maruchi.

656
00:59:24,175 --> 00:59:27,303
But how's it any different
if I have the key?

657
00:59:28,313 --> 00:59:31,874
Let's assume it's really Heug-un.

658
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,180
He doesn't have true chi.

659
00:59:34,252 --> 00:59:36,550
I know he has strong power,

660
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:38,589
but since we have true chi,
he can't beat is, can he?

661
00:59:38,857 --> 00:59:41,951
Yuk-bong and Sul-woon
fell without a fight.

662
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:48,262
If we can awaken Sang-hwan's
chi, matters might be different.

663
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:53,897
Honestly, in my opinion...

664
00:59:53,972 --> 00:59:56,566
I don't think Sang-hwan
can become Maruchi.

665
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,272
I have no confidence in him.

666
01:00:02,013 --> 01:00:04,709
Destiny can be made.

667
01:00:04,782 --> 01:00:05,749
The thing is will.

668
01:00:06,551 --> 01:00:08,849
That punk's will is...

669
01:00:10,455 --> 01:00:11,649
Where is he?

670
01:00:13,691 --> 01:00:15,716
Let's have some meat.
