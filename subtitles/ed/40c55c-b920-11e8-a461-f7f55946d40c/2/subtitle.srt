1
00:00:02,262 --> 00:00:12,194
- Why am I different?
- I didn't mean it that way.

2
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:17,387
Why?
Why am I different?

3
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:24,740
Go!
I don't want you here.

4
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:26,682
Sorry.

5
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:07,088
The day you came here,
Mt. Holy cried.

6
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:10,292
I didn't know what it meant then,
but I do now.

7
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:15,930
The shaky ground,
the evil spirit in the air...

8
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:19,964
...Mt. Holy was warning us
of a disaster.

9
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:22,631
Did you know?

10
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:30,348
I think you couldn't tell us,
but you did know.

11
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,987
Mt. Holy is afraid of you

12
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:38,591
cause you're to destroy it.

13
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,359
That fate of yours is a disaster,
damaging our tribe.

14
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:50,567
Hold my hands.
Mt. Holy will talk through you.

15
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:32,268
As the black moon appears
after the 3-day-long sun...

16
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:36,846
...two angry dragons will kill

17
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:39,814
all the living things on earth.

18
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:47,088
Trees will sooth the dragons...

19
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:50,123
...but the sword of the spirit
won't be stoppable.

20
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:58,700
When the sword shines...

21
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:05,007
...the world will quiet down
with sadness...

22
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:12,481
...but the chains of sadness
will last forever.

23
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:34,235
Mt. Holy wants me.

24
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:43,341
If I sacrifice myself to it,
the tribe will be safe.

25
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:48,714
I know now why my father

26
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:54,155
wanted to go to Mt. Holy...

27
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:01,397
...and why he left me here.

28
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:09,801
It was to protect the tribe.

29
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:19,480
Haeah!

30
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,885
I was born to be a sacrifice
for the tribe.

31
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:29,919
Can't you change my fate?

32
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:45,534
Haeah! You can do it,
can't you?

33
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:48,240
Do I have to die?

34
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:50,114
Can't you save my life?

35
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:53,950
I will make more paper

36
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:57,184
and stay outside the village!

37
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:02,021
I won't break my words
until the moment I die!

38
00:05:03,397 --> 00:05:06,560
Save me!

39
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,433
Help me live!
Haeah!

40
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,776
Does Dahn know?
Have you told him yet?

41
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:26,915
Not yet.
Vee wants to do it herself.

42
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:31,145
Dahn won't buy it.
He won't let her go.

43
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:35,286
But there's nothing that
Haeah can do.

44
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:41,494
Mt. Holy has decided it,

45
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:46,229
- and it was predicted long ago.
- She knew?

46
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:48,836
Haeah believes in the prophecy
of the mural painting.

47
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:55,041
Don't go!
Give them time alone.

48
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:15,094
Let me.

49
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:20,770
- Anything wrong?
- No, it's just the paper.

50
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,003
Are you sure?

51
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:27,836
The paper looks so heavy today.

52
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:35,183
Cause everybody feels down.
It will be okay

53
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:41,085
when the fury of Mt. Holy subsides.

54
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:45,063
I hope so.

55
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:30,843
Juk and Yun will get married
in a few days.

56
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,114
Will you stay with me?

57
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:48,692
I don't know.

58
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,429
The life has never worked
in favor of me.

59
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:58,604
It made everything I wanted
turn away from me.

60
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:05,609
Because I wasn't with you.
It'll be different from now.

61
00:08:07,914 --> 00:08:11,714
No matter what happens...

62
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:18,514
...I'll stay by your side
and help you out.

63
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:26,258
You can lean on me.
Okay?

64
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:45,280
Your ancestor painted it.

65
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:50,647
I'm the new patriarch.
Tell me everything about it.

66
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:55,090
It's the holy sword you saw
in the painting.

67
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:02,794
Long ago, Hwasan and Mae
went to a severe war.

68
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:05,637
Having been exiled from Mt. Holy...

69
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:10,634
...Mae tribe tried to make
the holy sword...

70
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:13,944
...with blood and bones
of a 1,000 alive people.

71
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,910
...in order to kill Mt. Holy
and exterminate our tribe.

72
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:18,549
To do so,

73
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:26,115
they needed the seed
of Hwasan Royal Family.

74
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,191
Soo, the chief of Mae, tempted
the King of Hawsan, Han...

75
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:35,760
...and gave a birth to Vee
who's to complete the sword.

76
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,070
But it wasn't easy.

77
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:45,704
Han brought

78
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:50,047
her here...

79
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,444
..to protect our tribe and Mt. Holy..

80
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:55,621
If Vee is here to protect us,

81
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:58,651
why sending her to Mt. Holy?

82
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:05,254
When the black moon
appears in a few days...

83
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:09,832
...it'll be the last chance
for Mae to perfect the sword.

84
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:13,165
They'll try to get hold of Vee

85
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,001
and complete the holy sword.

86
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:27,685
So Mt. Holy is using her
as the sacrifice.

87
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:32,854
It's the wisdom of Mt. Holy
to protect our tribe.

88
00:10:33,526 --> 00:10:35,084
Can't we save her?

89
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:40,628
Does Vee have to die

90
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:42,358
for the tribe?

91
00:10:42,702 --> 00:10:45,899
We have to live up to Mt. Holy?

92
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:52,010
What are you talking about?

93
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:07,782
Leave.
The time has come.

94
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:38,083
- Out of the way!
- Be reasonable.

95
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:39,783
I won't let you stop me.

96
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,011
It's for the tribe!

97
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,145
How can you do this?

98
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:45,889
As the patriarch,
I have to protect the tribe.

99
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:49,091
For the safety of the tribe,

100
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:50,127
I'm willing to die.

101
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:52,824
I bet you wouldn't do this
if you were in my place.

102
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:57,398
You made a big mistake,
refusing the position.

103
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:21,817
Why didn't you tell me?

104
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,398
We could've run away.

105
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,126
Sorry

106
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:43,775
Don't go.
Don't!

107
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:50,081
I'm begging you.
Don't go.

108
00:13:50,857 --> 00:13:54,122
Lock him up.
I'll punish him later.

109
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:11,469
Open it!
Let me out!

110
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:35,796
Let me out!
Let me out!

111
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:49,043
What did you just say?

112
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:53,848
We're not going to Mt. Holy.
I'm taking Vee.

113
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:58,815
I've made up my mind.
Go back.

114
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:01,121
I'll ask you who are the patriarch.

115
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:04,192
If you let Vee live,
our tribe will perish.

116
00:15:05,565 --> 00:15:06,759
Don't you know that?

117
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:10,469
I don't care about the tribe.

118
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:12,833
I'm no longer the patriarch.

119
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:14,969
I changed my mind.

120
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:19,002
Don't try to stop me.
I won't let you!

121
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:24,948
You've betrayed the tribe...

122
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:31,986
...and deserted your friends
including me and Dahn.

123
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:36,021
You'll be sorry.

124
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:51,065
Change your mind, man.

125
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,939
It's not too late.
Come with us.

126
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:55,405
Sorry.

127
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:18,670
We're friends!
Quit it!

128
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:43,585
- Give it up.
- I won't regret it. Go ahead!

129
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:46,657
Why?

130
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:48,963
- Don't do it!
- Out of the way!

131
00:16:52,105 --> 00:16:53,697
It's the only and last thing

132
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:55,064
that I can do for the tribe.

133
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,142
I'm the only one

134
00:16:57,577 --> 00:16:58,839
who can do this!

135
00:16:58,945 --> 00:16:59,912
I'm coming

136
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:02,146
And you're ruining it!

137
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:04,806
If you care about me,
don't do this.

138
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:15,456
Nothing ever happened.
Consider it as a dream.

139
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:24,896
To Mt. Holy...
Take me there.

140
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:37,174
Will you?
Come with me.

141
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,494
Go!

142
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:55,992
You've betrayed the tribe
and killed your friends.

143
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:59,893
Wasn't it for Vee?

144
00:18:01,073 --> 00:18:04,236
Get her out of here.
Save her!

145
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:07,780
You deserted me
and that's painful enough.

146
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:13,585
I can't hold them back long

147
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:16,186
with only 6 arrows.

148
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,717
Consider it as a farewell gift!

149
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:35,559
Nothing to be done now.

150
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:40,067
Mt. Holy will bring a disaster.

151
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:43,836
Juk knows it very well...

152
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:48,243
...that the holy sword of Mae

153
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:50,679
is the only thing to save Vee.

154
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:57,348
He'll go to Mae for it.

155
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:19,135
You've got only 3 days.

156
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:23,248
If you fail to take Vee
to the Mt. Holy...

157
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:27,810
...the sword will be perfected

158
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:29,477
and used to harm Mt. Holy.

159
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:33,490
If that's the case,

160
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:36,592
it'll be the end of our tribe.

161
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:41,365
The density of our tribe is
in your hands.

162
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:45,701
Find Vee and go to Mt. Holy.

163
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:50,570
Any other ways to save Vee?

164
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:54,373
The curse of Mt. Holy is
already hitting her.

165
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:57,609
She'll eventually bleed to death.

166
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:00,876
The fate of the tribe should
come before her life.

167
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:03,488
Dahn!

168
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:11,061
I know how painful that is.

169
00:21:11,998 --> 00:21:13,522
But you'll meet her again

170
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:19,801
for the pain you're in.

171
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:24,936
That's the nature's way.

172
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:30,244
I put dews from Mt. Holy on it.
Good luck.

173
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:17,191
We've got only 2 days.

174
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,397
I'm worried Mae might
find Vee before us.

175
00:22:23,235 --> 00:22:24,497
What are you thinking about?

176
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:29,865
Would I do the same
if I were Juk?

177
00:22:30,576 --> 00:22:32,305
Then he would be after you.

178
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,950
- You hate him?
- I did.

179
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:46,252
Not any more, though.
I forgot about him.

180
00:22:48,094 --> 00:22:50,358
Sorry it didn't work out.

181
00:22:50,696 --> 00:22:53,927
Stop taking about him.
Think only about the tribe.

182
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,426
That's what counts.

183
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:03,303
If not, you can go back.
I'll let you go.

184
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,142
I've chosen this way,
and it was me who Juk go.

185
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:15,711
And I failed to protect Vee.

186
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:53,182
It's still warm.

187
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,310
- Don't come closer!
- Don't move!

188
00:24:48,414 --> 00:24:50,678
- Take me to Mt. Holy.
- You'll die if you go.

189
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:56,151
That's the fate that
Mt. Holy has given me.

190
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,746
It's my fate to protect you.
You won't die!

191
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:01,052
Don't be silly.

192
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,991
Soon after I'll get the holy sword.

193
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:05,620
Then, Mt. Holy can't kill you!

194
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:06,730
I can save you!

195
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:10,892
If you save my life with it,
what about others?

196
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,899
They're sacrificing you
for their own lives!

197
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:14,630
They are deserved to die!

198
00:25:15,374 --> 00:25:23,941
That's where Dahn is.
If I live, he dies.

199
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,144
The day you showed up,

200
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:30,255
you occupied my mind.

201
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:33,817
But I had to give up on you
for Dahn.

202
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:36,291
Why? He's my friend.

203
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:39,362
Returning from Mt. Sunghwa,

204
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:42,525
I thought I could have you.

205
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:45,903
But, unfortunately,
Dahn came back alive.

206
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:52,169
I tried to forget about you,

207
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:54,343
but I couldn't.

208
00:25:56,115 --> 00:25:57,810
The more I tried, to forget you,

209
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,152
The more I wanted you.

210
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:04,979
I won't do that any more.

211
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:10,395
I will save you. And it will be me,
not Dahn, by your side!

212
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:23,934
Let me go.
Let me go.

213
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,014
Wait...
Wait!

214
00:26:37,956 --> 00:26:41,119
Stop looking for Vee.
Mae has nothing to do with her.

215
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,490
You're desperate, aren't you?

216
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:46,292
If you want to beg,

217
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:47,932
do it right.

218
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:52,199
I guess the hunting won't be
as boring

219
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:54,670
I'll let you live this time.

220
00:26:54,773 --> 00:27:00,234
If you get in the way again,
you will be sorry.

221
00:27:03,382 --> 00:27:07,148
Let them live.
We can use them as bait.

222
00:27:12,324 --> 00:27:17,193
Vee is nearby.
We'll find her soon.

223
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:53,822
When we first met,
we became good friends.

224
00:27:55,167 --> 00:28:01,367
You were brave, warm-hearted,

225
00:28:02,574 --> 00:28:04,633
and loved the tribe.

226
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:09,212
Let me remember you
as the man I know.

227
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:15,215
That's best for all of us.

228
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:18,048
You can't satisfy everybody.

229
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,522
It's dog-eat-dog out there.

230
00:28:21,026 --> 00:28:22,721
Nothing's more important

231
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:27,659
than my love for you.

232
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:37,333
Even if you save my life,
I will never forgive you.

233
00:28:55,894 --> 00:28:56,952
Send her.

234
00:28:57,095 --> 00:29:00,064
No, not so fast.

235
00:29:00,132 --> 00:29:04,762
- You've got more to give me than Vee?
- Why don't we become friends?

236
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:08,100
- What do you want?
- Vee!

237
00:29:08,907 --> 00:29:11,842
I don't care what you do
with the holy sword.

238
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:16,741
Cause Vee will resurrect
after you get what you want.

239
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:18,246
So?

240
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:23,047
Promise me you'll let her go.
Then, I'll help you.

241
00:29:23,155 --> 00:29:24,452
You know what my wish is?

242
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,149
It's killing every single soul
from the Hwasan tribe.

243
00:29:29,328 --> 00:29:30,989
And you're one of them.

244
00:29:33,332 --> 00:29:37,132
- What are you doing?
- Aren't you going to run?

245
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:41,296
- Not with your head.
- Is that right? Here's your chance.

246
00:31:03,722 --> 00:31:04,882
My baby...

247
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:13,861
You have grown up
beyond recognition.

248
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:17,066
You look just like your dad.

249
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:34,387
Do you know who I am?

250
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:43,592
No.

251
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,424
You're not the person I missed,

252
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:51,731
and I won't ask who you are.

253
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:55,003
All I want to know is

254
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,539
why you're doing this to me.

255
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:02,880
You have no idea

256
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:07,779
what curse Mt. Holy put on us.

257
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,816
For hundreds years..

258
00:32:12,924 --> 00:32:15,222
In the land of hell
where no weeds grew...

259
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:18,056
...our ancestors had to eat

260
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:20,687
their own flesh to survive.

261
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,892
We worked very hard with our bare hands.

262
00:32:23,135 --> 00:32:26,434
They couldn't die
with their bodies festering...

263
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:29,039
...and had to endure the pain
of bugs eating them alive.

264
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:32,471
It was all due to the curse
Mt. Holy put on us!

265
00:32:34,212 --> 00:32:41,277
But, with the holy sword,
we can destroy them.

266
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,148
We're giving them back

267
00:32:44,322 --> 00:32:46,381
the pain they gave us.

268
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,190
My baby...

269
00:32:57,903 --> 00:33:02,340
You can sooth the pain
that our ancestors had.

270
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:07,569
That's your fate.
Consider it as an honor.

271
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:10,947
Don't be scared.

272
00:33:11,183 --> 00:33:13,674
You'll sleep for a short time.

273
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:16,754
Then, you'll be reborn

274
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:20,416
as a daughter of Mae tribe.

275
00:33:24,863 --> 00:33:25,921
Go!

276
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:31,632
It's no use.
She can't get away!

277
00:35:07,632 --> 00:35:12,934
Hadn't you saved me then,

278
00:35:14,105 --> 00:35:16,596
Had I died then...

279
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:21,576
...this wouldn't be happening.

280
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:28,282
l have to die.

281
00:35:29,054 --> 00:35:34,754
I'm too much burden on you.

282
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:41,798
If there's anything left
that I can do for you...

283
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:44,226
...I'll be by your side.

284
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:56,644
- Can we meet again?
- Sure. I promise.

285
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:34,918
I'm sorry.
I can't take you with us.

286
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:27,368
Let's go back to the altar.
He wants the holy sword.

287
00:37:29,107 --> 00:37:31,667
He will come to the altar
to save Vee.

288
00:37:32,177 --> 00:37:35,943
We have to get back
before him.

289
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:55,531
Stopping the holy sword is

290
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:58,601
the only way to expiate my sin.

291
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:02,339
So I stuck around Vee

292
00:38:03,675 --> 00:38:05,165
and got to know you.

293
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:11,282
It was you who saved me
in Mt. Sunghwa.

294
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,375
You protected Vee.

295
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:18,985
The moonlight is dimmer.

296
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:23,785
The black moon will be up soon.
We've got to hurry.

297
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:08,171
Wake up! Wake up!

298
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:13,705
If the black moon is ours,
it will bring Vee here.

299
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:14,938
We'll see

300
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:31,252
Can you hear it?
It's calling the holy sword.

301
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,560
The curse of Mt. Holy can
no longer torture you.

302
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:41,935
Hang in there.
Just a little longer.

303
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:57,280
The girl of a fate, the spirit of Vee...

304
00:39:57,388 --> 00:40:01,484
...will bring the holy sword to us!

305
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:05,786
The spirit of Vee!
Destiny!

306
00:40:16,341 --> 00:40:19,037
Mt. Holy...
You have to go there.

307
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:26,647
Dahn is waiting for you.
Be strong. You can do this.

308
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:07,420
Where's Vee?
Where is she?

309
00:41:10,531 --> 00:41:13,591
With the black moon up,
the holy sword will appear.

310
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,267
It will be useless, though,
if you don't have Vee.

311
00:41:20,975 --> 00:41:28,279
You and your tribe will die.
How sad!

312
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:31,783
It's only the holy sword
that can save her.

313
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:33,511
I'm taking it with me.

314
00:41:33,687 --> 00:41:35,678
You think I'll let you have it?

315
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,084
You'll have to.

316
00:41:38,726 --> 00:41:41,718
Either to save her or your tribe,

317
00:41:41,862 --> 00:41:45,195
one of us has to kill Mt. Holy.

318
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:54,970
- And I have Vee.
- Say it! Where is she?

319
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:57,939
Right here.
Inside me!

320
00:41:58,078 --> 00:41:59,943
Don't mess up with me.

321
00:42:00,114 --> 00:42:03,982
I'll tear you apart
and find Vee!

322
00:42:04,185 --> 00:42:07,985
Go ahead.
Thrust it in me!

323
00:42:10,391 --> 00:42:14,391
Why?
Are you afraid?

324
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:29,387
You want to see the holy sword?

325
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:33,411
I'll tear your heart out.

326
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:46,387
At last, you're back.

327
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:05,004
Bring it!
Bring it to me!

328
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:09,980
Or you'll kill her?
Can you do that?

329
00:43:10,618 --> 00:43:11,642
I don't think so.

330
00:43:12,786 --> 00:43:16,654
But I can
cause that's my fate.

331
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:18,680
Kill him!

332
00:47:45,459 --> 00:47:48,724
It's over.

333
00:47:50,264 --> 00:47:52,323
Should I kill you

334
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:56,626
with this holy sword?

335
00:47:56,804 --> 00:48:00,638
Or should I let you have her?

336
00:48:03,076 --> 00:48:07,376
You listen to me.
I'll let you have this sword.

337
00:48:12,753 --> 00:48:16,519
- On one condition!
- Say it.

338
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:20,491
You become one of us, Mae.

339
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:24,320
Anyway, destroying the Mt. Holy...

340
00:48:24,665 --> 00:48:26,997
...is one thing we have in common.

341
00:48:27,868 --> 00:48:30,803
I'll let you live to take revenge for our tribe...

342
00:48:31,138 --> 00:48:34,972
...and you can have Vee.
Can you do it?

343
00:48:37,544 --> 00:48:40,308
With the black moon gone,

344
00:48:40,614 --> 00:48:43,174
the holy spirits will kill me...

345
00:48:44,251 --> 00:48:47,084
...but you'll be protected

346
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:54,392
...cause you'll be the last
descendant of our tribe, Mae.

347
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:19,248
As the descendants,
if we wreck vengeance...

348
00:49:20,053 --> 00:49:21,987
...we won't be breathe as alive

349
00:49:22,956 --> 00:49:25,322
and close our eyes as dead.

350
00:49:25,926 --> 00:49:30,295
Forever, Mae!

351
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,387
You'll come back to me.

352
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:38,361
Stop it!

353
00:50:38,565 --> 00:50:40,123
You think you can stop me?

354
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,460
Let Vee rest in peace!

355
00:50:41,668 --> 00:50:42,635
That's our only help for her!

356
00:50:42,836 --> 00:50:43,996
How dare you say that,

357
00:50:44,237 --> 00:50:47,502
you two-faced prick!

358
00:50:47,774 --> 00:50:49,935
When you let her go...

359
00:50:50,143 --> 00:50:52,577
...when you tried to get her
for the tribe...

360
00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:54,770
Vee was with me!

361
00:50:55,115 --> 00:50:59,415
Everybody wanted her dead,
but I protected her for my life!

362
00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:02,520
That's how we're different!

363
00:51:02,656 --> 00:51:05,853
Nonsense!
Vee didn't want any of this!

364
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:08,027
You cheated yourself

365
00:51:08,228 --> 00:51:10,696
and left yourself dream!

366
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:17,231
No way. Dream isn't painful.
It's over when you wake up.

367
00:51:18,872 --> 00:51:21,864
But there's something that

368
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:27,078
you can't get yourself out.

369
00:51:28,382 --> 00:51:30,907
That's love!

370
00:51:31,885 --> 00:51:34,183
I can't let that love die.

371
00:51:34,521 --> 00:51:37,513
How can you love a ghost?

372
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:42,090
- That's all I want!
- I don't want to let her go, either,

373
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:46,090
but that's her fate!

374
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:50,463
Her fate my butt!
I won't let her go!

375
00:51:50,704 --> 00:51:53,696
Kill me and let Vee go,

376
00:51:53,974 --> 00:51:57,137
or die to let her live!

377
00:51:57,477 --> 00:52:00,071
I'll be with her!

378
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,148
No matter where she is,
I'll be with her!

379
00:52:04,918 --> 00:52:06,977
That's how we're different.

380
00:52:28,408 --> 00:52:30,308
And you didn't love her.

381
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:31,670
You were obsessed with her.

382
00:52:43,757 --> 00:52:47,090
It wasn't an obsession!

383
00:52:50,597 --> 00:52:56,900
Vee wanted you, but it was me
who loved her! lt was me!

384
00:53:15,055 --> 00:53:20,186
Stop right there.

385
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:25,491
I'm begging you.
Don't let me kill you. Please...

386
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:48,282
There's something
I always wanted to say to you.

387
00:53:54,094 --> 00:53:59,623
Sorry.
I'm really sorry.

388
00:55:27,687 --> 00:55:35,287
I wanted to see you
once for all. Goodbye.

389
00:55:35,929 --> 00:55:42,596
- Let me go with you.
- No.l don't want you to.

390
00:55:42,836 --> 00:55:46,966
I promised you
that l'd always be by you.

391
00:55:47,407 --> 00:55:48,567
Remember?

392
00:55:50,043 --> 00:55:53,843
You said you'd help me
live a life that I choose.

393
00:55:55,682 --> 00:55:57,172
Please let me.

394
00:56:08,295 --> 00:56:13,699
Play it when you feel down.

395
00:56:16,236 --> 00:56:20,138
It'll cheer you up.

396
00:56:22,642 --> 00:56:24,837
It worked for me.

397
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,350
When the black moon rises
after a 3-day-long sun...

398
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:59,292
...a dragon with its soul lost
will look for a hidden tree...

399
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:05,061
The tree greeting the dragon,
a golden snow will fall.

400
00:59:06,105 --> 00:59:09,734
And the soul trapped in the tree...

401
00:59:10,243 --> 00:59:13,679
...will meet the dragon again
with the blessings of God.

402
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,015
Then, nothing on earth can
separate them again.
