10
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,021
Once upon a time...

11
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:15,290
In the Mt. Holy lived
Mae and Hwasan tribes.

12
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,891
Mae made war on Hwasan
to rule the world...

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,595
...and, worshiped by Hwasan,
Mt. Holy punished Mae.

14
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:23,363
Years later...

15
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:26,140
Having been exiled to the barren land...

16
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:28,902
...Mae made the holy sword with
blood and bones of 1,000 people...

17
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:31,969
..in an attempt to destroy
Hwasan tribe and Mt. Holy.

18
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,213
Now, the descendant of the Hwasan Royal Family...

19
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,548
...needs to be given as a sacrifice
to complete the holy sword.

20
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:46,051
No regrets?
We'll be lonely.

21
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:52,393
With you and our baby,
I couldn't be happier.

22
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,580
Why?

23
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:14,014
Do you really think
I loved you?

24
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:19,117
Wake up!
I only needed your sperm.

25
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:31,233
You did your job!
Forever, Mae tribe!

26
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:37,435
The baby will die anyway.
You want to kill it yourself?

27
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:49,455
What are you waiting for?
Go head!

28
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:57,660
I'll never forgive you!

29
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:32,156
Brothers and sisters of Mae!

30
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:36,096
Having ruled the world
for thousands of years...

31
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:39,432
...owning everything on earth...

32
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:43,433
...the curse of Mt. Holy

33
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:47,672
put an end to our prosperity.

34
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:55,720
In years to come, if there's to be
our descendants, our own flesh...

35
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:59,360
...they'll rule the world again,

36
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:04,393
and Mt. Holy won't stop them.

37
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:10,003
With the holy sword
made from blood and bones...

38
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:14,809
...let fight the curse of Mt. Holy!
Descendants of Mae!

39
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:21,739
Regain the honor we enjoyed
and prosper forever!

40
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:25,851
500 years from now,
when the black moon is up...

41
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,578
...a girl will be born

42
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:31,652
and named Vee.

43
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:38,195
Only her spirit can
wake up the holy sword!

44
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:58,914
Your holiness will shine the world...

45
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:04,720
...saving our tribe
from the everlasting nightmare.

46
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:08,154
Witness the eternity of Mae!

47
00:05:56,578 --> 00:06:03,211
With a 500-year-old promise,
when the darkness falls...

48
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:07,281
...the spirit of Vee
will complete the holy sword...

49
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:11,681
...that will free us
from the chains of Mt. Holy!

50
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:23,760
The spirit of Vee!
Open the world of darkness!

51
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:38,639
I'm taking her with me.

52
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,041
She was born to be a sacrifice.

53
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:43,343
You can't change her fate!

54
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,883
It's also her fate
that I'm to protect her!

55
00:07:46,154 --> 00:07:48,452
Don't be dirty her fate
with the name of tribe Mae.

56
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,624
I won't tolerate it!

57
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:59,665
Bring her back to me.
By all means!

58
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:32,030
Years later...

59
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:51,080
Where's Dahn?

60
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,581
- Nowhere in sight! Where?
- The valley of clouds!

61
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:05,155
- Who are they?
- Beats me.

62
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:07,891
We shouldn't let them
enter the village.

63
00:09:19,914 --> 00:09:22,906
A backward grip!
He's from our tribe!

64
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:25,710
Wait for Dahn.

65
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:29,619
If we do, the village will be
in danger. Come on!

66
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:36,184
Are you okay?

67
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,808
It's time to go home.

68
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:15,821
Are you okay?
It's all over.

69
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:48,962
I had a dream last night.The golden
leaves covered the whole village.

70
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:54,594
I guess it tried to tell me
you were coming.

71
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:58,798
I gave it a lot of thoughts.

72
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:02,806
It's not easy coming home
after deserting your family.

73
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:07,842
What happened today was

74
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:09,641
Hwasan against Mae tribe.

75
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:13,244
We couldn't care less

76
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:15,413
about who's after you.

77
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:17,254
Long ago,

78
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,986
you deserted us and left Mt. Holy.

79
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,962
Nether can you come back,
nor stay here. Leave!

80
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:36,576
Vee... is that your name?
I heard Han call you that.

81
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:37,911
Yes, Ma'am.

82
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:42,508
- How old are you?
- 15.

83
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:45,377
It hasn't been easy for me.

84
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:48,578
Right before you came,
Mt. Holy cried.

85
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:51,224
I guess we'll find out later

86
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:54,156
what it meant.

87
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:59,095
Han wants you to stay here.

88
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:01,565
He believes that
Mt. Holy will protect you.

89
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:05,296
I won't ask you

90
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,548
Whatever my dad wishes.

91
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:23,923
You can stay,
but Han is leaving tonight.

92
00:13:34,502 --> 00:13:39,633
This pendant of warrior
symbolizes courage before death.

93
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:42,934
It also symbolizes hope.

94
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:47,608
Courage is the only hope

95
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:51,310
that saves you from death.

96
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:55,353
Someday,

97
00:13:55,523 --> 00:13:58,788
it'll clear your eyes out of fear.

98
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:06,332
We've lived a life of hardships.

99
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:10,597
But I know that

100
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,164
daddy isn't a bad man.

101
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:25,315
Don't worry about me.

102
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:27,684
I won't.

103
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:34,025
Though I won't be with you,
I'll keep praying for you.

104
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,291
Be well.

105
00:15:02,857 --> 00:15:04,119
It's from Vee.

106
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:11,731
Take a good care of her.
She needs friends.

107
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:37,876
I haven't seen anybody
making paper for ages.

108
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:42,279
I would do it with my mom
when she was alive.

109
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:45,821
She said I was better
at it than Juk.

110
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:48,024
It's been already 5 years.

111
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:51,096
I remember her.
She was such a sweet lady.

112
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,969
It's just

113
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,067
an old memory now.

114
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,606
You care so much about Juk.

115
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:08,745
Because he's my best friend.

116
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:21,921
What were you talking about?

117
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:24,529
- Who?
- You and Vee.

118
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:29,529
I taught her how to make paper.
You saw, didn't you?

119
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:33,571
- Nothing else?
- No, that was about it.

120
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,901
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.

121
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:44,414
You like her, don't you?

122
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,956
Silly goose!

123
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:07,400
I will be fine.
I know I will!

124
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:31,504
Come on!
- Dahn! Dahn! Dahn!

125
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:39,571
Come on!

126
00:22:49,923 --> 00:22:55,862
Today, sons of Mt. Holy
became adults.

127
00:22:55,996 --> 00:22:57,054
Congratulations!

128
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:04,937
You'll be off to Mt. Sunghwa

129
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:06,630
in the morning.

130
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:10,876
It's Mt. Holy that decides
who survives...

131
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:14,810
...but those who make it back
will be warriors of the tribe.

132
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:18,841
We'll light the night for you.

133
00:23:21,455 --> 00:23:24,049
This is for you.

134
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,220
I made it myself.
It will protect you.

135
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:33,158
I always take things from you.

136
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:37,100
Haven't I told you?
I'm your shadow.

137
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:41,335
Thanks, man!

138
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:45,473
I'm so lucky to know you.

139
00:23:46,413 --> 00:23:48,347
I'm happy that I can help you.

140
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:54,185
It's the painting of prophecy.

141
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:58,016
They say our future lies in it,

142
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:00,450
but I don't buy it.

143
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:03,496
Do you know

144
00:24:04,231 --> 00:24:07,826
that it's only Haeah
and me who are allowed in here.

145
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:13,299
In the morning,
you'll be off to Mt. Sunghwa.

146
00:24:13,707 --> 00:24:15,174
When you come back,

147
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:17,140
you'll be the patriarch.

148
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:21,140
And, by the rules of the tribe,
I'll be your wife.

149
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:26,886
That's not...
What are you doing?

150
00:24:29,556 --> 00:24:34,016
Have a safe trip.

151
00:24:34,628 --> 00:24:36,789
I don't want anybody else
to become the patriarch.

152
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:43,528
Let's get out of here.
They're waiting for me.

153
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:49,406
Who?
Who's waiting for you?

154
00:25:00,254 --> 00:25:02,222
I've been looking
all over for you.

155
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:04,721
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

156
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:07,756
You're leaving in the morning.

157
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:12,858
- And?
- Have a safe trip.

158
00:25:14,635 --> 00:25:19,868
- What am I supposed to say?
- No presents?

159
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:24,973
Oh, I completely forgot.
Sorry about that.

160
00:25:25,712 --> 00:25:37,715
No, I've got one for you.
There you go. Take it.

161
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:41,450
My late father gave it to me.

162
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:44,996
Play it when you feel down.
It'll cheer you up.

163
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:56,067
It worked for me. Goodnight.
You look gorgeous tonight.

164
00:25:58,312 --> 00:26:04,512
Wait! Thanks.

165
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:16,696
Tell me about it.

166
00:26:16,897 --> 00:26:18,091
About what?

167
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:22,190
- I don't have your heart.
- That's not true.

168
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:23,495
It's Vee, isn't it?

169
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:26,236
Does she know?

170
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:28,341
What are you talking about?

171
00:26:28,508 --> 00:26:31,136
You've changed a lot
since she came here.

172
00:26:31,244 --> 00:26:34,008
She's just a friend.

173
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:36,012
Can you swear on it?

174
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:38,014
Stop being silly.

175
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:41,186
You're evading my question!

176
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:44,314
I'm afraid you might give up

177
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,719
on your goal because of her.

178
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:50,052
Nothing's going to change.
Vee needs friends.

179
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,027
You can never be sure!

180
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:53,827
All I want is to become a king

181
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:56,628
and rule the world.

182
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:00,501
I hope you mean it.

183
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:04,837
Keep in mind what you want
and who can help you.

184
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:53,520
This pendant of warrior
symbolizes courage before death.

185
00:27:54,494 --> 00:27:57,930
It also symbolizes hope.

186
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:03,369
Courage is the only hope

187
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:05,937
that saves you from death.

188
00:28:07,374 --> 00:28:11,708
Someday, it'll clear your eyes
out of fear.

189
00:28:14,715 --> 00:28:18,169
Bye.

190
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,973
Make it back!

191
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:26,082
Our ancestors' fury was
buried here 500 years ago.

192
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:28,814
As the descendants,

193
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:30,456
if we wreck vengeance...

194
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:35,289
...we won't be breathe as alive
and close our eyes as dead.

195
00:29:35,462 --> 00:29:37,396
The day of fate is coming!

196
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:41,057
We've got to destroy Mt. Holy

197
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:43,227
and Hwasan tribe!

198
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:49,304
Go bring back Vee,
the key to the holy sword!

199
00:30:06,793 --> 00:30:09,990
Forever, Mae!

200
00:30:18,672 --> 00:30:22,199
The fire of Mt. Sunghwa
will be waiting for you.

201
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:24,138
By all means,

202
00:30:24,644 --> 00:30:27,704
bring it back to Mt. Holy.

203
00:30:28,081 --> 00:30:31,175
The tribe will be waiting
for the new patriarch.

204
00:31:41,085 --> 00:31:43,647
Out of the woods is Mt. Sunghwa.

205
00:31:44,491 --> 00:31:47,858
Whoever stays alive,
bring the fire back home.

206
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:51,995
At any cost,
we have to pull this off!

207
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,664
- The leader...
- I will!

208
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:58,762
Dahn, take the lead.

209
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:41,732
Help!

210
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:10,830
Let's go!

211
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:33,021
Pull!

212
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,300
Are you okay?

213
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:07,181
Pull!

214
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:33,543
Dahn!

215
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:16,855
The village!

216
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:55,427
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Go help others!

217
00:37:16,322 --> 00:37:20,088
It's okay.

218
00:38:16,883 --> 00:38:19,215
Warriors are back!

219
00:38:32,231 --> 00:38:34,324
Welcome home!

220
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:35,599
Congratulations!

221
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:51,304
Don't be sad.
He's just being late.

222
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:59,279
Maybe he's lost,
or has a place to stop by.

223
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:07,753
Wait for him.
He's coming back.

224
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:43,388
It's a mess in here.
It'll take a while to clean it up.

225
00:40:46,232 --> 00:40:47,699
I thought I had to tell you

226
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:52,094
what happened in person.

227
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:56,136
We tried to save him

228
00:40:57,743 --> 00:41:01,941
but only to fail.

229
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,181
It's all my fault.

230
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:23,797
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Don't say anything. Don't

231
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:53,565
Dahn always supported you.

232
00:41:54,901 --> 00:41:57,267
He'd wanted to see you
sit in the throne.

233
00:41:58,004 --> 00:41:59,869
I'm so happy you're back,

234
00:42:02,408 --> 00:42:07,846
but I just can't believe it.

235
00:42:09,715 --> 00:42:12,206
I can't believe he's gone.

236
00:42:16,222 --> 00:42:18,690
Feels like he's coming in here
anytime soon.

237
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:25,660
Yeah, he's coming back.
Maybe he's already here.

238
00:42:25,898 --> 00:42:36,775
Dahn is not coming back!
Dahn's dead.

239
00:42:42,248 --> 00:42:46,708
- Mom made them for you.
- Thanks.

240
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:56,302
They're pretty good.
Try some.

241
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,600
Delicious, isn't it?

242
00:43:10,343 --> 00:43:13,710
I know why you're sad.

243
00:43:14,547 --> 00:43:19,280
It's Dahn, isn't it?
Is he dead?

244
00:43:24,423 --> 00:43:30,487
No... he's coming back.

245
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:32,525
I'm sure he's coming back

246
00:43:33,032 --> 00:43:34,727
for you.

247
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:45,601
He's here!

248
00:44:38,264 --> 00:44:39,561
Long time, no see.

249
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:45,068
- Who is it?
- Get back inside!

250
00:44:48,474 --> 00:44:52,410
Time to go home, girl.
They're waiting for you.

251
00:44:52,645 --> 00:45:01,451
I'm not going anywhere.
This is my home. No way!

252
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:11,457
I wish I could tear you apart
right now!

253
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:17,200
But I won't
You have a job to finish.

254
00:45:18,037 --> 00:45:22,235
It's shame that
your daddy isn't here.

255
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:47,658
You're late.

256
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,020
It feels as if I was dreaming.

257
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:57,195
A tree broke my fall,

258
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,096
and I was in a strange place.

259
00:47:04,376 --> 00:47:09,439
- Somebody saved me.
- Who could it be?

260
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:23,691
Don't you leave me again.
You hear me?

261
00:47:24,697 --> 00:47:25,527
I won't.

262
00:47:46,552 --> 00:47:49,521
I knew you'd make it back.

263
00:47:50,923 --> 00:47:54,859
The patriarch should be selected
through the competition.

264
00:47:55,427 --> 00:48:00,194
But all the warriors
and elders are in favor of Juk.

265
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:02,263
Dahn?

266
00:48:03,702 --> 00:48:06,830
I'll accept their decision.

267
00:48:07,273 --> 00:48:13,940
Good. By the unanimous decision,
Juk will be the patriarch.

268
00:48:14,713 --> 00:48:18,171
No! The position is only given

269
00:48:18,517 --> 00:48:21,145
to the best warrior.

270
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:24,855
The tradition should be valued.

271
00:48:25,724 --> 00:48:31,492
Therefore, I ask for a duel
with Dahn.

272
00:48:33,132 --> 00:48:34,759
I ask for your permission.

273
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:43,997
The winner will marry Yun...

274
00:48:44,276 --> 00:48:49,111
...and carry down the blood
of the Hwasan Royal Family.

275
00:48:50,149 --> 00:48:53,778
For the honor of Hwasan,
do your best.

276
00:48:59,425 --> 00:49:01,916
Why are you doing this?

277
00:49:02,061 --> 00:49:04,962
The best warrior
should be the patriarch.

278
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:11,859
Don't worry.
You'll be the one.

279
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:48,831
Let's call it quits
before one of us gets hurt!

280
00:49:49,008 --> 00:49:51,033
What do you mean?
You're willing to lose?

281
00:49:51,276 --> 00:49:53,540
- It's you that Yun wants.
- And Vee wants you?

282
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:56,708
Don' t be mistaken.
You can't deceive the tribe.

283
00:49:57,282 --> 00:49:59,512
If you don't do your best,
you'll end up dead.

284
00:50:00,019 --> 00:50:01,680
Why are you doing this?

285
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:05,523
I want Vee.
How about that?

286
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:15,295
What do you say?

287
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:51,868
- What's wrong?
- Mt. Holy...

288
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:16,756
It's over.

289
00:51:33,145 --> 00:51:38,276
Pay respect to Juk,
the new patriarch!

290
00:51:45,424 --> 00:51:47,619
Juk, where were you?

291
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,028
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

292
00:51:51,697 --> 00:51:54,530
Sorry I've lost a friend, though.

293
00:51:55,367 --> 00:51:57,130
I'll see you later.

294
00:52:05,377 --> 00:52:07,607
She said she was going
to Mt. Holy?

295
00:53:49,881 --> 00:53:53,282
By the precept of Mt. Holy...

296
00:53:53,619 --> 00:53:55,814
...Juk, you'll marry Yun

297
00:53:56,922 --> 00:53:59,550
and become the new king.

298
00:54:00,826 --> 00:54:03,954
The wedding will be held

299
00:54:04,296 --> 00:54:07,265
7 days from today.

300
00:54:09,835 --> 00:54:13,498
Dad would tell me about Mt. Holy.

301
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:17,500
He said that l'd end up there,

302
00:54:19,444 --> 00:54:21,878
and it'd make me suffer.

303
00:54:26,218 --> 00:54:29,051
- I think the time has come.
- I don't understand it.

304
00:54:29,855 --> 00:54:32,483
Forget about it.
You're confusing me.

305
00:54:33,158 --> 00:54:34,989
The day you came back...

306
00:54:36,128 --> 00:54:40,997
What happened today
...it's not coincidental, is it?

307
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:47,566
Didn't you see?
Mt. Holy tried to kill me!

308
00:54:53,178 --> 00:54:56,079
Please, leave.
I want to be alone.

309
00:54:56,315 --> 00:55:00,183
We broke the rule!

310
00:55:01,053 --> 00:55:03,817
People of Hwasan aren't
allowed to go to Mt. Holy.

311
00:55:04,323 --> 00:55:07,588
Those who did in the past
never made it back alive.

312
00:55:10,595 --> 00:55:13,723
We should be happy
we're still alive.

313
00:55:14,566 --> 00:55:18,400
That's what frightens me.

314
00:55:19,638 --> 00:55:21,230
I came back alive, didn't I?
