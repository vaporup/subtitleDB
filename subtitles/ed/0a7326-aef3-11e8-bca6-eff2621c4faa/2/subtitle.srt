1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,226
I've waited for a long time, Tezuka.

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:09,274
Sorry,
but we will be the champions.

3
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:14,115
The rules of the matches are one set match
and a tie-breaker. That is all.

4
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,107
Heard you guys are the "Golden Pair"
who has some invincible acrobatic double play.

5
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:48,870
- What double play? Can Seigaku really do it.
- One set match. Seigaku's serve. Play.

6
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,646
Go, team, go!

7
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,914
Jump a little higher.

8
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:25,662
Eiji.

9
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,942
The situation doesn't look too good.

10
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,907
- It's all right. It's still only-
- But...

11
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:32,751
Seigaku!

12
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:40,098
- Fight!
- Seigaku! Fight!

13
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:44,157
To give you guys so much trouble. Sorry!

14
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:45,890
Momo.

15
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:52,956
This is embarassing, right.

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,317
Eiji, use that move.

17
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,575
Okay.

18
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:19,713
- Yes!
- Yes!

19
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:26,049
- Happy.
- Keep it up.

20
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,018
A comeback is possible
because this is a game of doubles.

21
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:48,732
Reporting from Japan. Hai.

22
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:12,221
Game set and match.
Won by Hyotei. Seven games to five.

23
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:32,004
Oi, Echizen. I thought you were going to America.
Or are you getting ready to go?

24
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:39,105
Forget it, watch our show.

25
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:49,460
He's here. Echizen.

26
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:13,147
Second round. Doubles two.
Hyotei's profilic pair against Seigaku's incredible pair.

27
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,150
Here I go.

28
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:23,660
15 - Love

29
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,308
Yeah, we scored. That's great.

30
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,670
30 - Love

31
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,482
40 - Love

32
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:01,731
Game Hyotei. One game to love.

33
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,334
15 - Love

34
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:18,950
It's starting to progress.

35
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,523
Great, great.

36
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,301
What kind of joke is this?

37
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,603
- Defend.
- Yes.

38
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:39,152
Yosha!

39
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:51,788
Note: Inui is collecting data in real time
because the power of the opponents
exceeded the data that he had collected.

40
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,626
Game Hyotei. Five games to two.

41
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,459
You're gonna be defeated.

42
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:11,511
- Kaidou, can you still continue?
- Watch carefully.

43
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:13,112
Thanks for the hard work.

44
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,614
See, a straight shot.
Hundred percent.

45
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:27,816
Unfortunately, your ball won't make it over.

46
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:33,224
- Data tennis is starting to show its abilities.
- It's really a strong method.

47
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:36,075
Use that move.

48
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,145
Yosh.

49
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:06,417
Do it, Kaidou.

50
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:31,024
Game set and match. Won by Seigaku.
Seven games to five.

51
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:36,748
It's a pit between physical peserverence.
We can't lose.

52
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:47,093
Third match is beginning.
Hyotei's Kabaji against Seigaku's Kawamura.

53
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:58,445
One set match. Hyotei to serve. Play.

54
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:06,913
Hadoukyuu.

55
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:34,725
15 - Love

56
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:37,321
What!

57
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:41,362
Winner will be Hyotei.

58
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,397
If this continues, we'll lose.

59
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,247
Taka-san, that is...

60
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,510
I will definitely win this match.

61
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,967
I want to be in the Nationals.

62
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:14,607
Single-handed Hadoukyuu technique.

63
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:07,171
I can't play anymore.

64
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,214
Kabaji's stamina is actually drained.

65
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:33,764
The last ball doesn't count.
Singles three no game.

66
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:41,667
Chiku'so!

67
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:48,016
I'm sorry everyone.

68
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:59,603
Takashi, I love you okay! Good work!

69
00:11:00,204 --> 00:11:01,276
Oyaji...

70
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,229
Don't give up.
Go, go.

71
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:35,769
Taka-san, lend this racket to me.

72
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:45,917
Fourth match is starting. Singles two.
Hyotei's Akugatawa against Seigaku's Fuji.

73
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,490
- Disappeared?
- 15 - Love

74
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:12,629
Wow, for real?
Seriously amazing, it disappeared. Amazing.

75
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:18,652
Disappeared.

76
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,160
No shit.

77
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,150
30 - Love

78
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,134
Disappeared again.

79
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:43,260
Amazing!

80
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:44,226
40 - Love

81
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:49,233
No doubt about it,
Fuji Shusuke is a genius.

82
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:58,011
Wind. I will show you. Hakugei.

83
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:09,288
I'm lucky,
I just tapped it a little like this.

84
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,313
Careful!

85
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,377
One more time,
the wind hasn't stopped.

86
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:39,732
Everyone is pressing forward.

87
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:46,690
Game set and match. Won by Seigaku.
Six games to love.

88
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:08,811
Next match is beginning. Singles one.
Hyotei's Atobe against Seigaku's Tezuka.

89
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,817
Tezuka?
Isn't he the Seigaku captain?

90
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,240
I can see better here.

91
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,792
What are you doing here
when not even regulars sit here.

92
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,462
- Go away.
- Go away. Oi.

93
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:38,032
- But I'm part of the team, aren't I?
- That's not what it is about.

94
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:40,926
Why would a fellow like you
be allowed to sit on the bench!

95
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:43,756
Why aren't you on the way back to America?

96
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:49,622
You're... a pain in the ass.

97
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,946
Echizen.

98
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:08,425
Look after it.

99
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:11,814
'Kay.

100
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:12,815
All for Atobe!

101
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:20,019
- All for Atobe! All for Atobe! All for Atobe!
- All for Atobe! All for Atobe! All for Atobe!

102
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:15,339
The winner will be... me.

103
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,602
This place sure is crowded.

104
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:28,989
There he is.

105
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,788
- Are you done?
- Yes, I'm satisfied.

106
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:42,196
It's the first time we are playing against one another.

107
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:47,000
- Are you prepared, har?
- Yes.

108
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,506
Let's have the best match...

109
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:54,204
...of course the result will be my happy ending.

110
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:57,188
- Up or down.
- Up.

111
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:58,866
Up.

112
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,767
Of course.

113
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:06,924
The elbow...

114
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:12,919
One set match. Hyotei to serve. Play.

115
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,077
Here I go, Tezuka!

116
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,056
15 - Love

117
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,777
Be awed by my prowess.

118
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:47,762
Doesn't matter to me.

119
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:06,547
30 - Love

120
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,812
You're too naive.

121
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:18,721
Watch closely.

122
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:36,480
Oi look there,
Tezuka isn't moving a single step.

123
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:49,092
If it's not Zero-Shiki
then it will be Tezuka Zone.

124
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:55,599
All the balls that Atobe delivers are spinning towards Tezuka.
It's like they are attracted to him.

125
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,772
30 - 15

126
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:04,538
He returned all my balls.

127
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,981
It's coming.

128
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:38,065
30 - All

129
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:49,250
You're not playing badly eh, Tezuka.
But it seems like that arm
have not recovered fully, right.

130
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,321
What about his arm?

131
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,012
Heard he's got an injury in his left arm.

132
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:03,663
Don't talk about strange things, Atobe.
Just play with me seriously.

133
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,800
The four of us will practice with you.

134
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,738
That's called the Rondo to Destruction.
Remember it well.

135
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:55,979
That's high!

136
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:02,252
Oi, why didn't he smash the last ball?

137
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:14,901
It won't matter much just to win.
Let him play with that arm,
that's slowly breaking down.

138
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:22,045
If you go on playing the way you do,
your arm will be shattered.

139
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:27,083
No matter what, I want the team members
to go to the Nationals together.

140
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:34,547
- Hah!
- Game to Seigaku. One game to love.

141
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:38,489
Tezuka, you're really...

142
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:00,172
What a fearless guy.

143
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:01,926
30 - All

144
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,028
It's already been an hour into the match.

145
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:46,246
Tezuka, your arm would have already exceeded its limit.
Do you want to destroy your arm
just to win this match?

146
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:56,339
Here comes the Rondo to Destruction. Take this!

147
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,368
Again.

148
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:12,811
40 - 30

149
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:23,744
Yes!

150
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,300
Hyotei will lose?

151
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,896
Hyotei gonna lose?

152
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:31,464
Hyotei will lose?

153
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,750
Impossible.

154
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,901
One more ball.

155
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:55,328
One more ball left.

156
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,483
Just a little more.

157
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:23,153
- Tezuka!
- Tezuka!

158
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:24,831
Stay away!

159
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:35,851
The match is not over yet.

160
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:47,951
Tezuka-kun,
that's enough from you.

161
00:24:54,158 --> 00:25:00,821
Excuse me, what will happen if Tezuka-kun
gives up the match? What will happen?

162
00:25:00,822 --> 00:25:02,883
You don't know eh?
You don't know.

163
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:07,271
Excuse me, what will happen?

164
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:11,598
Saa... The one who's having a match with the sensei?

165
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,941
That Atobe is just waiting for this to happen.

166
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:18,112
- Captain, don't play any more.
- Please!

167
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:23,384
- Captain!
- Captain!

168
00:25:26,257 --> 00:25:27,658
Tezuka!

169
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:37,559
- Do your best.
- I will.

170
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:50,460
Seigaku! Fight!
Seigaku! Fight!

171
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:57,238
- Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Seigaku!
- Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Seigaku!

172
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,922
Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Seigaku!

173
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:01,566
Don't lose this after you've beaten me.

174
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,027
I will not lose.

175
00:26:56,647 --> 00:27:01,584
Sorry to keep you waiting, Atobe.
Let's settle this.

176
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,590
Okay, come at me.

177
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:35,875
Game set and match.
Won by Hyotei's Atobe.

178
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:38,142
Seven games to six.

179
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:55,280
Hyotei! Hyotei! Hyotei! Hyotei! Hyotei!

180
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:15,247
Everyone, it's time for the next player.

181
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,081
Understood.

182
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:32,742
With Hyotei Gakuen winning two games too
and with no games left, the reserves will play.

183
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:37,677
Hyotei's Higaki against Seigaku's Echizen.

184
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:08,439
Echizen, do you still remember what happened
one month ago on the tennis court?

185
00:29:13,482 --> 00:29:16,940
Higaki, we're counting on you.

186
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,050
- We are counting on you!
- We are counting on you!

187
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:25,461
Isn't this what idiots say?
Don't be jabbering around me.

188
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,167
Apologize Higaki.
I can't forgive what you said just now.

189
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:37,407
If I lose, I'll kneel on the floor to apologize.

190
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:43,980
Higaki, you know what you gotta do?

191
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:49,152
The day I lose to that chibi is the day I die.
I'm a pro.

192
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:51,379
Sixth match.

193
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:56,392
Hyotei's Higaki against Seigaku's Echizen.

194
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:30,425
You... are the pillar of Seigaku.

195
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:45,572
Ah, you don't have to be so bothered,
it's just a tennis game.

196
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:59,247
But chibi, it doesn't matter
what kind of genius you are,
I won't give any chances. I'm the real genius.

197
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,291
A dog that doesn't bite barks the most.

198
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,297
Hoh! A kid like you wouldn't know.

199
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,515
Weak, huh.

200
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:38,561
Love - 15

201
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:11,010
- Out!
- 15 - All

202
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:28,506
30 - 15

203
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,322
That fellow.

204
00:32:39,723 --> 00:32:44,660
40 - 15

205
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:59,909
Game Seigaku. One game to love.
Seigaku leading.

206
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:08,451
Damn kid, dares to look down on me.

207
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:22,687
Higaki!

208
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:35,544
Careful not to get hurt.

209
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,330
The match will start in a short while.

210
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,763
We are currently preparing the court lightings.
Everyone, please be patient.

211
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,077
15 - Love

212
00:35:15,745 --> 00:35:19,014
You still don't know how I play?

213
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,011
Stand up!

214
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:06,328
Is he trying to break his leg?

215
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:09,557
Ku'so.

216
00:36:48,738 --> 00:36:49,935
Echizen.

217
00:36:58,248 --> 00:37:01,394
Echizen! Fight!

218
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:12,428
Oi! You guys are noisy.

219
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:16,558
You alright?

220
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:19,346
Show some respect! Oi!

221
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:20,565
Shut up!

222
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,621
Let's go.

223
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:43,619
What is it?

224
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,189
Don't be too bothered about
what the doctor said.

225
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,495
Don't force yourself to talk.

226
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:53,130
Those words will come naturally, okay.

227
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:56,913
Our dead parents will want that.

228
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,236
If it's about money...

229
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:04,843
...you don't have to worry.

230
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,406
Ku'so!

231
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:50,462
There are many better players in the country.
Try playing with them.

232
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:55,584
Experience it yourself.

233
00:39:55,659 --> 00:40:00,596
You'll... be the pillar of Seigaku.

234
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,844
Don't kid around.

235
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:16,340
That's impossible...

236
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:18,540
...even if you do that.

237
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,778
I want to get stronger...

238
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:26,000
...stronger and stronger.

239
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:28,133
I will become stronger.

240
00:43:01,044 --> 00:43:01,836
Amazing!

241
00:43:02,377 --> 00:43:04,235
Yes! A comeback!

242
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:08,283
Concentrate!

243
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:30,284
Note: Echizen is using Split Step
to ease the pressure on his injured knee.
It also helps him to reach for the ball faster.

244
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,379
30 - 15

245
00:45:32,128 --> 00:45:34,746
- 40 - 15
- Yosha!

246
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,680
Concentrate.

247
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,567
Concentrate harder.

248
00:46:33,456 --> 00:46:35,447
Play with your spirit.

249
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:37,390
I will not lose!

250
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,577
I will not lose!

251
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:45,826
This ball!

252
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:50,024
This is the ball.

253
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:55,352
This ball.

254
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,737
This ball.

255
00:47:05,249 --> 00:47:07,143
Ganbatte!

256
00:47:07,223 --> 00:47:08,539
This ball.

257
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,434
This ball.

258
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,902
This ball!

259
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:26,542
Ah!

260
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:06,014
Announcing the results of this match.

261
00:48:06,115 --> 00:48:11,052
Won by Seigaku's Echizen.

262
00:48:16,025 --> 00:48:16,994
He did it!

263
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,859
- Good game! Wonderful!
- You're awesome!

264
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:20,671
I'm so glad!

265
00:48:21,272 --> 00:48:23,899
I'm so glad! Awesome!

266
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,070
You're awesome!

267
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,887
Come back to training.

268
00:48:59,401 --> 00:49:03,638
From today onwards,
we'll be challengers.

269
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:16,985
Captain, tell me if you need help
with your arm's recovery, okay.

270
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,316
I will remember.

271
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:25,758
Both team players
please assemble for the closing ceremony.

272
00:49:26,403 --> 00:49:31,965
- Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Seigaku!
- Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Seigaku!

273
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:37,506
- Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Seigaku!
- Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Ike! Seigaku!

274
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,207
Ike! Ike! Ike!

275
00:49:39,642 --> 00:49:40,666
Bow.

276
00:49:40,943 --> 00:49:43,121
Thank you for the game.

277
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,357
Nanjiro-senpai.

278
00:49:58,628 --> 00:49:59,986
Oh, sensei.

279
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,963
My son has been under your guidance.

280
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:05,398
Mada mada desu ka?

281
00:50:05,468 --> 00:50:09,167
First, I better give a call to America...

282
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:15,176
...or they will come looking for me.

283
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:17,495
Later.

284
00:50:26,956 --> 00:50:28,252
Echizen...

285
00:50:32,253 --> 00:50:33,737
...this is yours.

286
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,737
Captain.

287
00:50:57,153 --> 00:50:59,979
Oi, that's Rokkaku Chuu.

288
00:51:00,295 --> 00:51:01,632
Is that Shitenhouji!

289
00:51:02,453 --> 00:51:04,224
That is Higa Chuu?!

290
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:05,757
Look, even Rikkai is here...

291
00:51:05,828 --> 00:51:07,728
Amazing.

292
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:09,866
Does it bother you?

293
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,364
Not really.

294
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:18,559
- Yosh, let's go.
- Hai!
- Yosh!

295
00:51:24,212 --> 00:51:26,093
Mada mada da ne.
