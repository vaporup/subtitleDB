1
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:56,874
Western grip?

2
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,062
Western grip?

3
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:58,942
Correct.

4
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,417
Just like holding hands.

5
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,454
Holding hands?

6
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,146
Like this?

7
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,197
- I don't know how.
- I don't know how.

8
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,829
Yamete kudasai.

9
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:11,845
Ah?

10
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,893
Please stop doing that.

11
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,323
- Can't hear you.
- Ha ha, idiot.

12
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:18,659
This person must be mute.

13
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,220
Saa, who knows.
I'm just too ignorant.

14
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,407
Hey, you guys are noisy.

15
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,642
Na?

16
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,301
What did you say chibi?

17
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,026
The one you were talking about just now
was the Eastern grip.

18
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,222
Eastern grip?

19
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,958
It's really common...

20
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,692
...just for people like you.

21
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,432
Did you said something wrong?

22
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:49,998
How old are you?

23
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,128
- Junior High student?
- Middle School student?

24
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,106
Looks like you know a lot.

25
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,912
Get off the next stop.

26
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,649
Mada mada da ne.

27
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,120
Who's that?

28
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:16,019
Good afternoon!
Thanks for the hard work!

29
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,886
Oi chibi.

30
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,663
We are not recruiting.

31
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:33,300
Wait chibi.

32
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:34,526
What is your name?

33
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,863
I'm asking you for your name.

34
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,614
Could it be you are that transfer student...

35
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,829
...named Echi something?

36
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,662
Answer me.

37
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,414
Echizen Ryoma.

38
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,532
So it is.

39
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,772
The prodigy from America.

40
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:08,971
Show me what you've got.

41
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,423
And you are?

42
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,775
Seigaku regular,
second year student, Kaidou Kaoru.

43
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,329
You'd better not regret.

44
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,560
You will lose.

45
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:23,089
What did you say.

46
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,433
Well he looks quite cute.

47
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,968
He's really good!

48
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,012
You alright, senpai?

49
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,260
Such beautiful spinning ball...

50
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,057
It's my first time seeing something like that.

51
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,782
Hey, hey, hey, ah Kaidou?

52
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,622
Who's he playing with?

53
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:25,483
That must be the transfer student
Ryuzaki-sensei was talking about.

54
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:45,145
Heh, you can even spin the ball
into such an angle.

55
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,766
Snake shot.

56
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:04,210
Game Kaidou. One love.
Court change.

57
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,198
So it'll be like this.

58
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:23,218
If it continues like this, he will...

59
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,340
My reaction is getting slower.

60
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:57,244
I can't be losing to this chibi?

61
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,957
This is a match of perseverance.

62
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,987
I won't lose.

63
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,773
Heh...

64
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,801
This person...

65
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,144
...even knows the Snake.

66
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,560
That is a Buggy Whip shot, right.

67
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,946
It's quite difficult to use...

68
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,748
...since this is my first time trying it.

69
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,413
First time?

70
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,620
Senpai, you sure are sweating a lot.

71
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,818
You'll wet that uniform.

72
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,973
The weather's so hot yet you're dressed so weirdly.

73
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,428
It's not over.

74
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,132
Come!

75
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,894
Mada mada da ne.

76
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,885
That'll be all.

77
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,341
Good afternoon!

78
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:38,066
Captain...

79
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:42,037
Playing a match without approval,
twenty rounds around the court.

80
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:42,512
But I-

81
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,703
Forty rounds.

82
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,681
Yes.

83
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,787
The rest of you start your high-intensity training.

84
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,414
The first years pick the balls.

85
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,520
Yes.

86
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,601
You're the team captain.

87
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,137
Please give me your guidance.

88
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,990
I will join next semester.

89
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,466
First, hand up a registration form.

90
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,480
Ah, okay.

91
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,950
Oyaji.

92
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,316
Oh, Ryoma.

93
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,869
Gave me a scare there,
what're you doing here?

94
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,372
Is your mother doing fine?

95
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,746
It's outrageous.

96
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,454
What were you thinking leaving our hometown?

97
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,591
It's called Seishun Gakuen.

98
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,454
Nothing spectacular.

99
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,252
Why, don't like it?

100
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:43,701
Don't tell me that to get me into that school,
you brought me here all the way from the States?

101
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,195
Well, you can say that.

102
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,843
How about it?
Let's have a game.

103
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,720
Here then.

104
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,026
I'll crush you.

105
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:11,927
Ready. Start.

106
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:14,862
Don't look down on me!

107
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:17,598
Damned guy.

108
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,826
Mada mada da ne.

109
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,781
Go home.

110
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,113
Ku'so!

111
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,829
Ugh! What the hell? What you doing?

112
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:18,826
When did you come here?

113
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,430
Anyway, get out.

114
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,592
Scared you, didn't I?
Scared you, didn't I?

115
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,264
Get out.

116
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,164
It's been a long time
since we were in the bath together.

117
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,462
That's disgusting.
I feel like getting out of here right now.

118
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,031
You're blushing.

119
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,406
You're shy?

120
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,705
Your skin's so thin?

121
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:33,938
Who's the one that wants to get out?

122
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,309
- Tell me clearly.
- Shuddap.

123
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,713
When we were bathing together while you were young...

124
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,447
...didn't you like to put your legs like this?

125
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,299
- What kind of joke was that?
- It hurts, it hurts.

126
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,728
You're early.

127
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,363
The English test turned out bad.

128
00:13:55,534 --> 00:14:00,369
- No doubt about that. It was horrible.
- I thought it was okay.

129
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,463
Echizen Ryoma...

130
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,304
...National champion for four years running...

131
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:08,237
...never lost a single game in the championships.

132
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,027
- No defeat, that's impressive.
- Ah that's more.

133
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,089
Ryuzaki-sensei.

134
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,389
What kinda guy is that Ryoma?

135
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,226
Playing with the world's top masters...

136
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,594
...with 37 consecutive wins.

137
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,408
People said that as long as he wasn't injured
during the Grand Slam, he wouldn't lose.

138
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,303
Japan's greatest player.

139
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,914
It was also because I looked up to him
when I was young that I began playing tennis.

140
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,424
Even now he's still my most respected senpai.

141
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,358
Nitouryu no Samurai Nanjiro.

142
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,514
Exactly.

143
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,855
That boy is Samurai Nanjiro's junior.

144
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,438
Even if he's famous,

145
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,774
I still won't give him preferential treatment.

146
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,135
I will treat him fairly.

147
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,911
Now it's just to ensure
that we will achieve victory in the Nationals.

148
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:21,870
Only these.

149
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,340
As expected, it's here.

150
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:29,143
We are the same group.

151
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,074
Ah, o-xhibi.

152
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,111
Come to see the groupings?

153
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,548
About the tournament to decide the regulars...

154
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,134
First years aren't allowed
to take part in the ranking matches.

155
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,329
Why would there be your name?

156
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,634
Saa...

157
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,889
...because I am strong.

158
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,210
Don't be so arrogant.

159
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,595
Kaidou.

160
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,334
Give me your guidance.

161
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,680
Tennis is about hitting the ball back fast.

162
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,627
Let's have this practice first.

163
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,097
Don't want to.

164
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,534
How cute.

165
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:20,390
Jackknife.

166
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,809
That technique isn't too bad.

167
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,127
All the different smashes in tennis...

168
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,433
...sure benefit you guys.

169
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,663
Too bad your ball isn't high enough.

170
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,097
Sorry but I've checked your data.

171
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,712
The data won't lie.

172
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,781
If not for the data...

173
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,849
...you would have played better.

174
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,158
- What are you doing?
- Woot? Ugh.

175
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,258
What was that?
What was that?

176
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,594
Doing that by yourself.

177
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:46,995
Makes one so nostalgic.

178
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,017
This Seigaku regular uniform,

179
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,392
- Not too shabby.
- Heh?

180
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:55,200
Let's have a game at the usual place, okay.

181
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,246
Let's go.

182
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,911
When did he come in...

183
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,246
- Everybody gather.
- Hai!

184
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,053
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

185
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,587
The opposing team is Seishun Middle School...

186
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,000
...finally we get to play.

187
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,040
I still haven't accepted you.

188
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,317
Ah, I see.

189
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,353
Hey, look at that.

190
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,292
What's this?
A chibi here.

191
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,969
How come even a chibi can become a regular.

192
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,500
Oh, it's Hyotei!
Hyotei is here!

193
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:49,373
- Yo Tezuka.
- Atobe.

194
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,448
Where did this kind of manners come from?

195
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,688
How are you doing, players of Seigaku?

196
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,370
Hoi?

197
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,568
You even send Junior students
when your own players aren't good enough.

198
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,266
Hmm.

199
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,579
Who are you?

200
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,243
Really cute.

201
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,478
Tezuka.

202
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,192
We'll see you eat dirt today.

203
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,465
All the best.

204
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,273
You are?

205
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:10,354
Higaki Shioin.

206
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:33,649
The next player on the court is...

207
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:38,689
...Seigaku's Tezuka against Gokuin's Nakano.

208
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,672
Finally, he's playing.

209
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,070
Oi, Echizen.

210
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,923
Why aren't you watching the match?

211
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,059
You're Seigaku's regular, right.

212
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,528
Watch the match? Why?

213
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,693
What why?

214
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,521
Kaidou.

215
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,335
I'm just saying.

216
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,880
Anyway, I don't like these kind of things.

217
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,295
Tennis is just a game for solo players.

218
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,233
There's also doubles.

219
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,656
Is it that fun? Doubles.

220
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,654
It looks like
you still don't know much, o-chibi.

221
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,590
Two persons together can be like three people.

222
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,844
That's doubles.

223
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,454
Just joking.

224
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,513
Have some food first.

225
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,894
Milk and bread are all here. Here.

226
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,235
I don't like milk.

227
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,450
Echizen, it's your turn to play.

228
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,600
I'll be going first.

229
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,164
Oi, have you eaten?

230
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:25,029
Seigaku! Fight! Fight! Fight!

231
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,673
Seigaku! Fight! Fight! Fight!

232
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,800
- Ike, ike, ike, ike, ike, Seigaku!
- Ike, ike, ike, ike, ike, Seigaku!

233
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,863
Oi, oi, is that kid really going to play?

234
00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:57,337
One set match. Seigaku's service. Play.

235
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:16,075
Ne, umpire, you haven't counted...

236
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,607
...the points.

237
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,190
15 - Love

238
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,347
That guy's really good.

239
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,728
It's hard to believe he's a first year.

240
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,834
- Medic. Hurry.
- Ah!

241
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,086
There doesn't seem to be any problems with his eye.

242
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,747
Just a cut on his lower eyelid.

243
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,757
The match can't continue.

244
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,027
It's fine.

245
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,125
Stop joking.

246
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,372
Captain Tezuka is worried too.

247
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,935
I want to play.

248
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,338
Ten minutes.

249
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,708
If you don't win in ten minutes,
I'll substitute you.

250
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,974
Tezuka.

251
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,015
Alright?

252
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,428
No problem.

253
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,457
Sorry for the wait.

254
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,057
Still playing on?

255
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,983
Just a little cut,
no reason to make a big fuss.

256
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,889
That guy's left-handed.

257
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,145
No way.

258
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:27,424
You'd better admit defeat.

259
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,156
Nitouryu.

260
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:17,858
Note: This name refers to Ryoma's ambidexterity.

261
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,996
Seigaku Tennis Team.

262
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,070
Congratulations on your victory.

263
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,900
Thank you.

264
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,371
Players of the tennis club.

265
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:32,342
Today, my idiot son lost his game...

266
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,605
...sorry to bring you guys trouble.

267
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:35,543
It's okay...

268
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,274
...we won in the end.

269
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,578
- It's my treat today.
- Thanks.

270
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,313
Eat, eat.

271
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,406
- Everyone, let's toast.
- Okay.

272
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,584
Okay, cheers!

273
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,088
Cheers!

274
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:48,089
Let's eat.

275
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,258
Hey, no.

276
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,719
- No, don't.
- Stop it!

277
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,740
Delicious.

278
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,217
- Delicious.
- Delicious.

279
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,398
Sensei, sorry to trouble you.

280
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,019
We brought you quite a bit of trouble.

281
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:11,989
Ah er, I have some good wine here, have a little.

282
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,920
I am the team captain, Tezuka.

283
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,246
Captain?

284
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,371
- You're mistaken.
- Tezuka is a third year student.

285
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:22,917
Yo Tezuka-sensei.

286
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,289
Tezuka-sensei.

287
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,652
- But that o-chibi was quite good today.
- Yes, he was.

288
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,126
- He scared me a little.
- Um.

289
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:36,401
Ah, that was the Nitouryu.

290
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:37,805
That Nitouryu was not natural.

291
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,070
Not natural?

292
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,543
He learned from his father.

293
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,738
His father, you said...

294
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,201
...Echizen Nanjiro?

295
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,686
- You're bothered because of this?
- Eh?

296
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,393
What do you mean?

297
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,300
What is it?
What? What? What?

298
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,607
Ah Eiji, sorry to keep you waiting.

299
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,933
That Echizen sure is slow.

300
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,437
Get someone to bring him here.

301
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:08,597
Why don't you go?

302
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:09,867
Why me?

303
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,386
Damn late, Echizen!

304
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,494
Ah, my apologies. You see...

305
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,775
...we are not open for business today. Ah, dozo.

306
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,090
Sorry about it.

307
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,590
- Come back tomorrow.
- But they're eating... But they're eating...

308
00:30:25,676 --> 00:30:27,379
No, no, no. That is...

309
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:30,054
...just a minor incident. Don't worry about it.

310
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:31,931
Carry on. It is okay. It's okay.

311
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:32,932
- Taka-san.
- Yes?

312
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,996
Good accuracy.

313
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,923
What about Higaki?

314
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,564
Don't worry.

315
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:54,202
There's a reason to make Higaki lose.

316
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,215
To control him better.

317
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,525
If this carries on...

318
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,901
...it might lead to the damage of your whole body.

319
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,666
Rest for a year without playing tennis.

320
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,019
Concentrate on your therapy.

321
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,308
Wait till the National Finals.

322
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,416
Please let me play till that match.

323
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:14,280
If it's tennis...

324
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,614
...you can still play in high school.

325
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,746
No matter what, I want the team members...

326
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,675
...to go to the Nationals together.

327
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,855
Swing the racket for me to see.

328
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:42,779
Your Zero-Shiki Drop Shot.
(Zero Degree Drop Shot)

329
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,413
Stop.

330
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,251
Being your therapist...

331
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,684
...I can tell you that this is your limit point.

332
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,243
That move of yours...

333
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,260
...will add on to your injuries.

334
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:14,544
You must not use the Zero-shiki Drop Shot
under any circumstances.

335
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:16,549
Alright?

336
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,512
Hi.

337
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,524
What's the matter?

338
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,530
Have your injury recovered?

339
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,820
All thanks to you.

340
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:24,660
Recover well.

341
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,918
Competition is one week away.

342
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,196
Up or down?

343
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,570
Up.

344
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,897
- Up.
- I will serve first then.

345
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,540
Let's have a proper match.

346
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:35,081
As the captain,
you'll lose face if you don't win.

347
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,017
Give me all you've got.

348
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,204
You sure?

349
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,190
Echizen, you're strong...

350
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:09,145
...but if you don't get better,
we will not win in the Nationals.

351
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,319
Give me your best shot.

352
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,637
I won't go easy so give me all you've got.

353
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:37,311
Give me all you've got
and improve yourself, Echizen.

354
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,170
Why did you transfer schools?

355
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,781
Didn't it cross your mind...

356
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,126
...that the Nationals
are filled with the best players.

357
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:54,223
- Even stronger than yourself?
- Think about it.

358
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,262
Think about it on your own.

359
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:10,406
You're Seigaku's pillar of strength.

360
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,022
Stop kidding around.

361
00:40:44,874 --> 00:40:47,163
Echizen's not coming again today?

362
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,377
What did you hear about it?

363
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,787
Don't worry about it?

364
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,547
Looks like he came to school though.

365
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,015
What happened?

366
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,173
Is it a cold?

367
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,306
It is a cold.

368
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,660
- Ne, ne, ne, did something happen to the chibi?
- Ah...

369
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,392
What do you mean something happened?

370
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:18,537
- It wasn't easy coming here.
- Then what do you want me to do?

371
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,105
At least help me a little.

372
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:29,112
The age of Kanto will continue tonight.

373
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,914
Ryoma, let's have a game.

374
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:35,067
- Don't want.
- Good. Heh?

375
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:37,885
Oi, Ryoma.

376
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,642
{\pos(192,242)}I'm bored. What's up?

377
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,498
{\pos(192,242)}Why?

378
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:32,392
Ya, they want those training camp.
Why?

379
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:36,865
{\pos(192,242)}Sure.

380
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:38,435
{\pos(192,242)}See you then.

381
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,807
Mum...

382
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,422
...there's still one more week, right.

383
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,276
I understand.

384
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,625
Bye.

385
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,342
What are you trying to do?

386
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,647
Mind your own business.

387
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,113
How long do you intend to stay here?

388
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,029
Don't try to change the subject.

389
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:34,944
Captain, please play another round with me.

390
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:44,539
Just concentrate on practising
for the upcoming competition.

391
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,814
I wish to start immediately.

392
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,501
I'm about to leave.

393
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,866
What are you talking about?

394
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,655
I don't have much time already.

395
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:21,875
What do you mean?

396
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,520
We'll talk about it later.

397
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,463
Hurry up, go for practice.

398
00:44:44,075 --> 00:44:45,115
Tezuka.

399
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,290
Tezuka.

400
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:53,789
For next week's Kanto Meet,
the playing members have already been selected.

401
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,704
The first team we're up against is Hyotei Gakuen.

402
00:44:58,756 --> 00:45:00,296
Heh... Hyotei...

403
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:02,960
No way, it'll...

404
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,593
...definitely be a blood bath.

405
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:11,123
- We lost last year but this year,
we'll definitely win!
- Yeah!

406
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:14,100
These are the Kanto's meet regulars' uniforms.

407
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:19,192
- Tezuka's choices are Oishi Shuichiro.
- Yes.

408
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:23,068
- Fuji Shusuke.
- Yes.

409
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:26,446
- Kikumaru Eiji.
- Yes.

410
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:29,796
- Kawamura Takashi.
- Yes.

411
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:34,565
- Inui Sadaharu.
- Yes.

412
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,166
- Kaidou Kaoru.
- Yes.

413
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:45,004
The last one is, Echizen Ryoma.

414
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:12,735
Momoshiro, even though I can't put you down this time
you still have to work hard in the future.

415
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,564
Yes.

416
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:24,198
Captain, I can't take part in the Kanto Meet.

417
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,052
Can I be dismissed?

418
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:30,661
What?

419
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:36,417
I have to represent in the Youth Cup.

420
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,890
I'm going back to America.

421
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,003
Then, what about the Kanto's meet?

422
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:47,172
That's why I'm giving
this regular's uniform to Momo-senpai.

423
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,404
What the hell are you saying.

424
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,340
- Stop fucking around!
- Oi! Oi!

425
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:56,935
- Stop.
- This is a rare opportunity to come by for any Seigaku player!

426
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,272
What kinda joke is this, bloody idiot!

427
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,813
Oi, Momo.

428
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,295
Leave him alone.

429
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,278
Don't brood over it.

430
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,309
So, you guys are the players
of Seishun Middle School.

431
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:34,277
- Higa-san...
- Yes that is Higa-san.

432
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,379
I brought you a nice present.

433
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,825
Hora, who should I aim?

434
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:41,268
- Eh? Dangerous! Everyone is dangerous!
- You! You!

435
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,971
- What the hell are you!
- Oi Kaidou! Kaidou!

436
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,223
Wait, you okay?

437
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:52,259
- That bastard!
- Wait, calm down. Calm down. Stop this! Stop it!

438
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,110
Let go of me!

439
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:55,243
It's been a while, Tezuka.

440
00:47:56,273 --> 00:48:00,418
- What the hell are you doing?
- Leave here at once.

441
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,208
- Don't waste anymore of your energy.
- Why is he here for?

442
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:05,646
Why is he here?

443
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:44,987
You bunch, I'll accompany you.
Play a game in Samurai Nanjiro's meet.

444
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,824
Come on out, if you dare.

445
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:50,992
- Ano saa...
- Echizen!

446
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:55,122
Don't associate yourself
with that kind of people.

447
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,659
Isn't this chibi your opponent in the game?

448
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,501
Game?

449
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:07,933
Oh, you didn't know?
He didn't tell you?

450
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,307
Hold on.

451
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,909
Echizen Ryoma, remember that.

452
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:35,859
Brat.

453
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,922
Hyotei Gakuen.
Egate Mcleod Higaki.

454
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:45,980
- Hyotei.
- Hyotei.

455
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,624
Leave at once.

456
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,210
I will not tolerate this.

457
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,679
Are you troubled?

458
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,604
Sensei.

459
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:54,022
Ryoma's going back to America, right?

460
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,600
Is that alright?

461
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:04,259
Whether he wants to leave or not, is not up to us.

462
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,779
If it depends on him,
I guess there's nothing we can do.

463
00:53:52,002 --> 00:53:58,909
Will the participating schools
please report to the court now.

464
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,560
It's starting soon.

465
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:05,896
Momoshiro that idiot,
didn't come in the end.

466
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,976
And so is the chibi.

467
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,592
- Let's go.
- Oh!

468
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,330
Kanto District Meet is about to begin.

469
00:54:57,495 --> 00:55:01,692
Seishun Gakuen and Hyotei Gakuen match
is officially begun.

470
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,691
Please exchange your lineup.

471
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,735
I've waited for a long time, Tezuka.

472
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:13,609
Sorry,
but we will be the champions.
