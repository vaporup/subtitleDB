1
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:09,095
Comrades,
Japan belongs to the People!

2
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,043
Not the Emperor,
not the military!

3
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:15,015
Long live the People!

4
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,047
The Black Dragon Clan is coming!

5
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:25,031
Kick the Chinese out of the school!

6
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,039
Maintenance is important.

7
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,011
Do not allow

8
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:35,088
the fluid to enter the reservoir
nor the engine.

9
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:37,091
The function of the pump

10
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:41,055
is only then maintained.

11
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:45,035
And never try to repair
it without the help of an engineer.

12
00:03:03,072 --> 00:03:04,051
Stop writing!

13
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:07,031
All Chinese get out of here!

14
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,087
You can't enter here!

15
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:16,023
This school is not for
Chinese people!

16
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:17,095
Get out now!

17
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:29,051
Behave yourself here!

18
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:33,059
Are you alright?

19
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,039
Rotten scum!
What do you think you're doing!

20
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:40,023
Who are you to speak to me?

21
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:43,035
Yamada Mitsuko.
The one who looks down at you!

22
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,011
Chicken!

23
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:52,063
I don't care who you are.

24
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:55,043
Before I count to three,
you better disappear.

25
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:56,098
One!

26
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:58,007
Two!

27
00:03:59,016 --> 00:03:59,083
Three!

28
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:50,027
Master...

29
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,047
He is Funakoshi Fumio
Master of the Black Dragon Clan.

30
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:58,051
Have you already given up fighting?

31
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:00,095
Violence is no solution.

32
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:03,043
Now you see the result.
Didn't you learn anything in my school?

33
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:07,003
Professor Watanabe.
Excuse my pupils.

34
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:20,063
Be thankful for his mercy.
You could all be crippled if he wanted you to be.

35
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:23,083
Who did you fight with?

36
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,010
Me.

37
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:31,079
You alone?
Your Kung Fu is quite efficient.

38
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:34,099
I am Funakoshi Fumio
from the Black Dragon Clan. And you?

39
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,091
Mitsuko, why are you here?

40
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,047
Uncle Funakoshi,
my pen has been broken by your pupils!

41
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:48,095
It was very expensive!

42
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:53,087
You know I am poor.
Why tell me about it?

43
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:57,011
Do you guys have some money?

44
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:02,043
Satisfied?

45
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:06,039
Just like your blessed father.
Impossible to satisfy.

46
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,079
Don't you worry nobody will marry you?

47
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,003
No problem at all.
Chen Zhen is all I want.

48
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:12,087
Chen Zhen?

49
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,035
Yes. Chen Zhen of Jing Wu School.

50
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:17,087
Jing Wu School of Shanghai?

51
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,083
- That means Huo Yuen-jia...
- Is my Master.

52
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:24,099
Impressive...

53
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,067
Is there a problem?

54
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:30,067
I just received...

55
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:33,055
a telegram from Shanghai.

56
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:38,099
It says that Master Huo
was killed in a Kung Fu match by...

57
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:44,011
his opponent Akutagawa
Ryuichi of Nijiguchi.

58
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:46,015
He is from our clan.

59
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,043
lmpossible!

60
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,063
I am verry sorry. But this is what I was told.

61
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,055
Excuse me.

62
00:07:09,036 --> 00:07:12,051
Too bad I missed the opportunity
to challenge him myself.

63
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:15,058
Chen Zhen!

64
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,019
Where are you going?

65
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,099
Chinese embassy.
To check if this is really true.

66
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,043
A Japanese could never have beaten your Master.

67
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:26,055
Stop the Japanese invasion!
Long live the People!

68
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:29,043
Long live the People!

69
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:56,051
I warn you! If you
stay too long I will look for someone else.

70
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,015
Chen Zhen!

71
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:05,015
Are you coming back to Japan?

72
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:10,051
When they leave China,
I will come back to Japan.

73
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:14,026
They are only going to Tsingtao
to fight the Germans.

74
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,075
You better be right about it,
because Tsingtao belongs to China.

75
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:20,027
Both Japanese and Germans
are invaders to China.

76
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:22,010
Chen Zhen

77
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,075
Do you hate the Japanese?

78
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,099
I don't know!

79
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:32,071
Being in this area,
we have no choice.

80
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:34,070
Take care of yourself.

81
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:38,035
Chen Zhen!

82
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,003
JAPAN AND UNITED KINGODM FORM ALLIANCE

83
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:05,051
KARATE MASTER AKUTAGAWA
MATCHED WITH MASTER HUO

84
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:29,043
Some small change!

85
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:35,091
I don't have anymore.

86
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:39,079
I really don't have more.

87
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,059
I don't have anymore.

88
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,039
Go away!

89
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:45,067
- Good Morning.
- I am not Japanese.

90
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:48,055
You are not?
Me neither!

91
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:50,011
Please sit down.

92
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:54,003
- Where shall I take you?
- Jing Wu School.

93
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:56,067
Jingwu School?
To learn Kung Fu?

94
00:09:57,044 --> 00:10:00,067
Yes, I want to learn Kung Fu.
Please go!

95
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:03,031
Don't go to Jingwu.

96
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:05,067
Everyone here knows Jingwu was number one,

97
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:08,044
but this is over.

98
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:11,051
If you don't wanna take me there
I will take another drive.

99
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:16,019
Wait, wait. As you are paying me,
I will take you anywhere you want.

100
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:17,031
Attention.

101
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:19,027
Let's go.

102
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,043
JING WU SCHOOL

103
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:41,003
Now that Master Huo is dead
there is no future for Jingwu School.

104
00:10:41,064 --> 00:10:44,031
Are you sure you don't want to
try another school?

105
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:47,015
They are really finished.

106
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:48,047
5th Senior!

107
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:50,043
- Are you the 5th Senior?
- Biu!

108
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:52,039
- Let me take this.
- Thanks.

109
00:10:53,064 --> 00:10:56,027
- You are...
- Chen Zhen of Jingwu School.

110
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,075
Jingwu School is not finished.
Wait and see.

111
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,074
What are you waiting for?

112
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:09,059
5th Senior!

113
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,022
5th Senior!

114
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:23,078
Master Ngai.
This is my ancestral tablet.

115
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,071
If you want a challenge
let's go outside.

116
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:21,095
Master, are you alright?

117
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:24,083
Master Ngai.
Thank you for the fight.

118
00:12:25,004 --> 00:12:26,095
I am no match for you.

119
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:30,075
The victory was unjustified.

120
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:34,079
You must be tired from your
journey. Come later for a rematch!

121
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,039
Have you finished your studies?

122
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:50,031
Anyway, i am happy you are back.

123
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,031
Uncle Nong.

124
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:55,079
I was worried that this might affect your studies...

125
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,056
so I did not notify you about Master.
How did you hear about it?

126
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:02,019
It was all over the newspapers.

127
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:06,023
The Japs must be very happy about it.

128
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,015
Well... Let's pay our respects to my Father.

129
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,011
Wait! What are you doing?

130
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:25,015
He is not a Huo.
He is not allowed to wear this.

131
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:28,063
Uncle Nong.

132
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:31,003
He was brought up by my father.

133
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:33,023
He is a part of the family.

134
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:44,043
Before the duel,
father's asthma was already getting worse.

135
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:48,086
I tried to talk him out of it,
but of course he would not listen.

136
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:52,087
TOLERANCE

137
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,047
Please go ahead!

138
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:23,059
What are you doing?
Master Huo personally made this board!

139
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,086
Uncle Nong

140
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,023
Chen Zhen is right.

141
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:31,071
Foreigners have been doing whatever
they wanted to do in our country.

142
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:35,007
That's because we have tolerated them doing it.
As long as I live

143
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:36,091
we won't tolerate it anymore!

144
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:56,051
I will look for Akutagawa.

145
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:59,055
Chen Zhen.
You must make a challenge first.

146
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:02,022
Forget about it. I will go now.

147
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:08,047
Not even our police can enter Nijiguchi.

148
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:11,039
If anything happens to you,
what will become of the Jing Wu school?

149
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,023
- Even your father could not beat him.
- Uncle Nong...

150
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:17,083
Your father left you in my care.
I am responsible for your safety.

151
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:21,019
Lun, Cheung, follow Chen.

152
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,091
Notify me if anything happens.

153
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:31,071
- How nice!
Get out!

154
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:34,095
Chief, a phone call!

155
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:36,095
Who is it?

156
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,043
Yes, Yuen-Kui's speaking?

157
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,079
Nong Jin-Sun.

158
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,063
Is it that serious?

159
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,042
I will be there right away.

160
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:49,059
We have to go to the Nijiguchi Area.

161
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:53,027
Two.

162
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:54,027
Three.

163
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:55,051
Four.

164
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:58,043
Idiots!

165
00:15:58,064 --> 00:16:00,099
- You are like girls!
- Dismissed!

166
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:18,019
Who do you think you are to walk
in here with your shoes on?

167
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,007
I am Chen Zhen of Jingwu School.

168
00:16:20,036 --> 00:16:21,058
I am looking for Akutagawa Ryuichi.

169
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:25,007
No Chinese are allowed in here!
Get out!

170
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:27,099
Here is China. I can walk where I want to.

171
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:30,091
Bastard!

172
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,067
I don't want to fight with you.

173
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,087
Get your master out!

174
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,063
This will be a fair duel.

175
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,083
If either of us should die,
there mustn't be any vengeance!

176
00:18:45,028 --> 00:18:49,043
My master fought you using the Huo Fist.
I shall do the same.

177
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:08,063
I can see that you obviously never could have been
a match for my master.

178
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:16,059
Master!

179
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:36,018
Nobody is allowed to enter except Japanese!

180
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:40,035
Are you sure you saw him enter?

181
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:42,059
I saw him go in there myself!

182
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,051
There he is!

183
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:48,083
Are you Japanese?

184
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:49,091
No.

185
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:00,067
Salute!

186
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,075
- What is going on?
- Nothing!

187
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:29,003
Mr. Fujita, Mr. Ambassador...
Everything is ok.

188
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,047
Don't create an incident!

189
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:39,035
Patrol one. Fall in!

190
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,042
- 5th Senior, how was the match?
- I won.

191
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:48,027
Bravo!

192
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:51,083
Ask Ting-En and Uncle Nong
to join me at Master's grave.

193
00:21:52,004 --> 00:21:54,011
- It hasn't beensealed yet.
- That's even better.

194
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:57,003
Be careful.

195
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,051
What are you doing?

196
00:22:43,024 --> 00:22:45,080
- What are they doing?
- Examining the body of Master.

197
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,011
Why did you let them do it?

198
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:51,027
What can I do?
Chen is a student of the Jing Wu School.

199
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:54,091
Chen, tell me
why are you doing this to my father?

200
00:22:55,012 --> 00:22:58,063
Akutagawa could never have beaten Master.

201
00:22:58,096 --> 00:23:00,083
I suspect he was poisoned.

202
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,091
Yuen-Kui, have you ever suspected anything?

203
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:07,031
Master Huo was hit by his opponent
and vomitted blood.

204
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,087
Lots of people saw it. Nothing suspicious.

205
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:16,046
I rather want to be called disloyal and disrespectful
than not to know the truth.

206
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:18,087
I must find out the truth at any cost.

207
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:21,083
If you want to stop me,
you better kill me right now.

208
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:53,027
But who did it?

209
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:55,035
That is for you to find out!

210
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,099
Come on everbody.
Let us bury Master with the respect he deserves.

211
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,067
The Japs could never have beaten Master so easily.

212
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:07,091
They will get what they deserve now!

213
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:12,019
Luckily 5th Senior came back in time!

214
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,019
I don't understand...
how did they poison Master?

215
00:24:18,044 --> 00:24:21,043
For some people it is not very hard to do it..

216
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:24,095
Master prepared this fight for a whole month.

217
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:26,035
He did never get out!

218
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:27,087
That's right.

219
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,079
The bad guy must be among us!

220
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:35,043
Hsiao-Wei!

221
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,063
You brought the meals to Master?

222
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:40,031
Yes, why?

223
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,023
Are you suspecting her?

224
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:46,015
Not really.

225
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:50,079
I am just asking myself,
who else had access to Master's food?

226
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,098
Me!

227
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:56,030
I do all the cooking in this house!
Are you suspecting me?

228
00:24:58,032 --> 00:24:59,091
Cheung, go check the kitchen for poison!

229
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,023
See if there are any dead rats in there!

230
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:05,003
- Calm down!
- Why don't you go check?

231
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,091
Go and see if there is
anything poisonous in there!

232
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:11,023
Hurry up! Go!

233
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,075
Please, don't get mad!

234
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:16,051
I must clear my name!

235
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:18,071
Ting-En, what is going on?

236
00:25:19,028 --> 00:25:23,019
Uncle was suspecting the food was poisoned
and Uncle Gun thinks we are accusing him.

237
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:25,023
I never said I was suspecting him!

238
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,011
Ok, very well! From now on you can eat
whatever you want, but not from me!

239
00:25:29,032 --> 00:25:33,007
Master Huo was brought up by my cooking!

240
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:36,067
And you dare
accuse me of poisoning him?

241
00:25:37,088 --> 00:25:40,023
Enough now, let's eat!

242
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,051
Chen Zhen
be careful, it might be poisoned.

243
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:45,015
Master has eaten together with all of us.

244
00:25:45,036 --> 00:25:48,059
If your food was poisoned,
we would all be dead already!

245
00:25:49,052 --> 00:25:52,071
That's right.
Nong Jin-Sun, did you hear that?

246
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,063
Suspecting me!

247
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:55,039
Eat!

248
00:25:57,036 --> 00:26:00,098
The Japs may come back for revenge,
so let's eat before they come!

249
00:26:06,012 --> 00:26:08,007
I will visit Dr. Smith later

250
00:26:08,064 --> 00:26:11,047
to see the analysis
of the poison that killed Master.

251
00:26:12,032 --> 00:26:13,054
Ana... lysis?

252
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:15,059
Chemical analysis.

253
00:26:18,096 --> 00:26:20,051
JING WU SCHOOL

254
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:28,079
- Have you seen this before?
- No!

255
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:39,026
- Great!
- Wonderful!

256
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,047
You are incredible.
Will you teach us some boxing too?

257
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,059
Sure! Right now?

258
00:27:12,092 --> 00:27:15,007
Fancy moves not effective.

259
00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:17,035
And die-hard training will help.

260
00:27:17,056 --> 00:27:20,051
Challenge has one objective:
beat the opponent.

261
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:23,071
You need: reflexes, speed and power!

262
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:27,011
Simple and direct offense will work best.

263
00:27:28,028 --> 00:27:30,071
To attack an opponent...
first learn to take an attack.

264
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:33,063
But we can hit him before they attack!

265
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,055
What if you don't have enough power? You can hit him

266
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:37,079
ten times but he will not go down.

267
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,043
So you need more power.

268
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:43,043
Sir, they have come to
learn Kung Fu.

269
00:27:43,064 --> 00:27:45,047
Will Chen Zhen be our Master?

270
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:47,003
Yes, we want to learn from him!

271
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:49,015
He will not teach you.

272
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:51,031
Ting-En is the Headmaster.

273
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:55,051
- Four-legged form?
- Exact.

274
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,023
You look so shaky. Try a kick!

275
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:00,003
Where is the power?

276
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:04,042
Let me show you.

277
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,003
There is a form of side-kicking
in Japanese Kung Fu.

278
00:28:07,024 --> 00:28:07,087
Go on.

279
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:11,043
- Simple but effective.
- Show us.

280
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:16,062
Get ready.

281
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:26,099
Are you alright?

282
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:30,043
Concentrate the whole power of the body
and kick sharply at the point.

283
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,039
HSlAO HUNG

284
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:50,079
- What's the matter?
- Please stay.

285
00:28:51,068 --> 00:28:52,074
It's late.

286
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,075
Stay with me.

287
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,003
I am the Head Master now.
I must go back.

288
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,095
You were afraid of your father.

289
00:29:01,016 --> 00:29:04,019
but now you can stay.
You can do what you want.

290
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:08,063
If someone sees me here
I will lose all respect.

291
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:13,022
I don't believe it. Who would not
respect Master Ting-En?

292
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:16,003
Please? Will you stay?

293
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,031
I have to go before dawn.

294
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:28,014
I want to know
every move of these people.

295
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,031
But they're all Japanese!

296
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:41,047
There will always be ignorant
idiots who go against history.

297
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:50,007
Sorry, I am late.

298
00:29:50,084 --> 00:29:53,022
Are you still scared of Chen Zhen?

299
00:29:53,044 --> 00:29:55,019
Are you even too weak to knock the door?

300
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,086
I wanted you to rest,
that's why I did not invite you here.

301
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:04,083
I only have one question.

302
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:10,095
Did you hear about the autopsy on Master Huo?

303
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,007
You get out!

304
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:23,075
What's this? Secret affairs?

305
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,023
It really was you who poisoned him, wasn't it?

306
00:30:30,076 --> 00:30:33,019
The Japanese Empire, regarding

307
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,055
technology, industrial achievement

308
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:39,043
and military power, is ahead of China.

309
00:30:40,024 --> 00:30:42,059
We put our hopes in you, the warriors,

310
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,007
to break the Chinese Martial Arts Legend.

311
00:30:45,036 --> 00:30:48,015
But you have been a big disappointment!

312
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,087
So we had to think of something.

313
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,046
Shameless!

314
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:55,059
It's only military strategics.

315
00:30:57,052 --> 00:31:00,083
This is for military only! This is no way for a samurai!

316
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:07,051
The match was to be fair and square!

317
00:31:08,024 --> 00:31:10,095
You shameless bastard made me lose all respect!

318
00:31:11,064 --> 00:31:13,023
You dare to speak of the samurai spirit?

319
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:26,079
Let me tell you about the samurai spirit!

320
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,095
Justice is secondary!

321
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:32,059
To serve the Emperor,
I will risk becoming a criminal in history.

322
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:38,075
This is wrong.
I will show you.

323
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,011
According to Dr. Smith

324
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:45,067
Master was poisoned with a slowly growing drug.

325
00:31:47,008 --> 00:31:50,083
It damaged his lung functions,
seeming like an asthmatic disease.

326
00:31:53,052 --> 00:31:55,087
Is there a traitor at Jingwu School?

327
00:31:59,068 --> 00:32:01,079
Chen Zhen, why did you come back?

328
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:04,066
Why do you ask me?

329
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:10,031
You have become an idol here at Jingwu School.

330
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,011
Did you ever think how Ting-En must feel?

331
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:20,074
I did not...

332
00:32:21,056 --> 00:32:24,035
Since you've been back, have you ever talked with
Master Ting-En about the training?

333
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:27,027
You do what you want here.

334
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:29,099
Can you think once
about what you are doing here?

335
00:32:32,068 --> 00:32:35,075
You are very talented,
but always bare in mind...

336
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:38,099
that Ting En is the
Head Master of Jingwu School!

337
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:45,043
It's getting late.
Think about it.

338
00:32:56,088 --> 00:32:58,091
- 5th Senior, going out?
- Yes.

339
00:32:59,032 --> 00:33:00,067
Working so hard.

340
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:07,039
Master Chen!

341
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,075
Out here so early in the morning?

342
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:12,055
I brought some friends with me.

343
00:33:13,044 --> 00:33:14,075
They all want to learn from you.

344
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:16,083
Don't follow me!

345
00:33:22,012 --> 00:33:23,067
Overslept?

346
00:33:27,036 --> 00:33:28,027
Master!

347
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:32,083
I WILL KILL ALL CRIMINALS. CHEN ZHEN.

348
00:33:40,056 --> 00:33:42,099
Hold on!
Violence is no solution!

349
00:33:45,012 --> 00:33:46,043
General!

350
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:49,038
Move!

351
00:34:06,032 --> 00:34:07,091
Good Morning master!

352
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,011
Where have you been the whole night?

353
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:20,063
- Where is Chen Zhen?
- He went out.

354
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,059
Tell me when he's back.

355
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:25,003
I am in my room.

356
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:38,042
The Japs are coming.
Everyone out!

357
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,091
Little Master!

358
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:42,055
- The Japanese are here!
- Calm down.

359
00:34:46,012 --> 00:34:48,055
Something bad will happen.
Call the Police.

360
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:56,067
- What do you want?
- Where is Chen Zhen.

361
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,079
Chen Zhen? He is out.

362
00:35:00,052 --> 00:35:02,007
Maybe he went beating some Japs.

363
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,022
He has a strange habit.
If he does not beat one Jap a day he feels sick.

364
00:35:07,008 --> 00:35:08,019
Wait!

365
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:12,043
Chinese Bastards, you killed Master Akutagawa.

366
00:35:13,092 --> 00:35:16,087
You Japs only know how to blame others.

367
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:19,007
Enough talking.

368
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:21,031
We won't leave without Chen Zhen!

369
00:35:21,092 --> 00:35:24,048
As I see you carry swords,
I know you mean business.

370
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,067
Close the doors!

371
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,066
Protect Master's shrine!

372
00:37:04,036 --> 00:37:05,011
Hurry!

373
00:37:06,096 --> 00:37:09,055
- Shoot the Japs!
- Stop that!

374
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:25,099
Draw your swords.

375
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,039
You better leave now!

376
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,083
What? Just let them go!

377
00:37:33,004 --> 00:37:35,007
Both sides have been injured.
This straightens it out.

378
00:37:35,056 --> 00:37:37,094
We will not leave until we have Chen Zhen.

379
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,003
Sakamoto, give me some face.

380
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,095
Who are you talking to?

381
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:46,027
5th Senior!

382
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,075
Don't move!

383
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:57,051
Old man, you will not shoot!

384
00:37:57,072 --> 00:38:01,003
I won't.
But my finger could slip...

385
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:05,023
Shoot the first who moves.
Take Chen Zhen away!

386
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:06,095
Why are you doing this?

387
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:09,099
Akutagawa was murdered.
We must question him.

388
00:38:10,024 --> 00:38:12,043
- I did not do it!
- Take him away!

389
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:19,074
You all better leave now or we will be forced to shoot!

390
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,003
Come on... sit down!

391
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:42,023
Jie is handling this case, so no need to worry.

392
00:38:42,044 --> 00:38:43,087
Chen will be alright.

393
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,007
Why are you in this uniform?

394
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:53,071
This case is too big for me. I can't do anything here.

395
00:38:54,008 --> 00:38:55,051
And what about Chen Zhen?

396
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:58,047
- Let Fate decide it.
- Fate? Wait!

397
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,063
Captain, you have
four witnesses, don't you?

398
00:39:11,088 --> 00:39:13,079
Yes, our Police Department has four witnesses

399
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:16,075
who all claim to have seen Chen Zhen kill a man.

400
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:19,079
Strange.
Where did they come from?

401
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,059
I saw Chen Zhen with my own eyes.

402
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:25,027
There is no way it wasn't him!

403
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:28,019
It's true! I saw him
stab the deceased with a knife!

404
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:33,054
It's him. He killed the murdered with an axe!

405
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:36,015
How many fingers can you see?

406
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:37,083
Two.

407
00:39:39,088 --> 00:39:40,094
No no no, four!

408
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:46,007
Could you come a little bit closer?

409
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:47,015
No need.

410
00:39:47,064 --> 00:39:49,035
That's ridiculous!

411
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:56,003
I was at Jingwu School
with my fellow students.

412
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:57,046
They can speak for me.

413
00:39:58,016 --> 00:39:58,087
Your Honour,

414
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:03,019
the Jingwu Students cannot be taken
as witnesses, as they are very close to him.

415
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,047
What are you talking!

416
00:40:08,068 --> 00:40:11,011
Your witness has just arrived.

417
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,039
Your Honour, I have another witness to present!

418
00:40:15,092 --> 00:40:18,099
I don't think a
Chinese witness can be heard!

419
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,099
My witness is Japanese!

420
00:40:22,024 --> 00:40:22,095
Japanese?

421
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,063
Miss, please identify yourself.

422
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,075
I am Yamada Mitsuko.
The daughter of Yamada Mitsuo.

423
00:40:52,096 --> 00:40:54,051
Minister of Education.

424
00:40:55,012 --> 00:40:58,099
Chen Zhen said he was at
Jingwu School at the night of the murder.

425
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,079
Can you confirm this?

426
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,059
He is lying.

427
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,035
He spent the whole
night with me in my motel room.

428
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:11,075
He did not leave...

429
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:14,003
- The whole night?
- Yes.

430
00:41:16,064 --> 00:41:17,075
What did she say?

431
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,027
What if he sneaked
out while you were sleeping?

432
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:28,047
That is impossible!

433
00:41:28,076 --> 00:41:31,055
We didn't sleep the whole night...

434
00:41:31,076 --> 00:41:32,095
We were busy doing other things.

435
00:41:33,016 --> 00:41:35,059
What things were you doing if not sleeping?

436
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:39,007
What else can you do in a bed...

437
00:41:39,028 --> 00:41:41,011
when you don't sleep in it?

438
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,063
- What did she say?
- No idea, and you?

439
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:49,063
The Japanese said, she slept
with Chen Zhen the whole night.

440
00:41:50,012 --> 00:41:51,051
Are you sure?

441
00:42:04,044 --> 00:42:05,055
Congratulations.

442
00:42:06,044 --> 00:42:07,035
Let's go.

443
00:42:12,008 --> 00:42:15,035
The Chinese Hero
is nothing but a womanizer!

444
00:42:24,028 --> 00:42:25,079
How come you are here?

445
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:29,015
I have abandoned everything for you.
Now you must take care of me!

446
00:42:42,036 --> 00:42:44,095
Cook for her?
Don't even think about it!

447
00:42:47,092 --> 00:42:51,019
Chen Zhen, your Master sent
you to Japan to learn new technologies.

448
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,051
To beat the Japs with knowledge.

449
00:42:55,004 --> 00:42:57,047
Never forget your Master's
wishes because of a woman!

450
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,087
What will we do now?

451
00:43:02,032 --> 00:43:05,011
Jingwu School does not want to be
linked to the Japanese in any way.

452
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:06,095
Chen Zhen

453
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,030
You are a student of Jingwu.
You can't have affairs with Japanese here.

454
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:16,043
Chen Zhen, did I cause you any trouble here?

455
00:43:16,064 --> 00:43:17,031
It's alright.

456
00:43:18,044 --> 00:43:21,083
You should not worry about getting a wife.

457
00:43:22,004 --> 00:43:25,007
A hero should not be sentimental.

458
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:28,071
You want to destroy
your life for this woman?

459
00:43:28,092 --> 00:43:32,039
Uncle Nong, Mitsuko has
given up everything to help me.

460
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,031
And she testified in court
for me, what can she do now?

461
00:43:37,028 --> 00:43:39,084
Maybe that's how Jap woman behave?

462
00:43:42,088 --> 00:43:46,050
Here at Jingwu, we can't
tolerate any Japs, whoever it may be.

463
00:43:46,096 --> 00:43:50,083
It's your choice.
Either you leave the woman

464
00:43:51,072 --> 00:43:53,051
or you leave Jing Wu School.

465
00:43:53,072 --> 00:43:55,083
Little Master, you
obviously want to kick 5th Senior out!

466
00:43:56,004 --> 00:43:58,055
What is it, are you with the Japs now?

467
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:01,067
- You want to frame me?
- Why are you talking trash then!

468
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:03,087
- Say that again!
- Then what?

469
00:44:05,016 --> 00:44:05,091
Enough!

470
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,095
Chen Zhen

471
00:44:09,004 --> 00:44:12,023
If this goes on,
Jingwu School will be finished.

472
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,099
I don't want any
in-fighting because of this.

473
00:44:16,004 --> 00:44:17,051
There is only one solution...

474
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:20,044
To see who is
Head Master of Jingwu School!

475
00:44:20,064 --> 00:44:22,071
Once and for all.

476
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:25,003
I don't want to be the Head Master!

477
00:44:25,024 --> 00:44:26,043
I don't care what you think.

478
00:44:26,088 --> 00:44:30,063
Here are some students
who don't want to listen to me anymore!

479
00:44:31,072 --> 00:44:35,083
I will challenge you now
to see who is worthy of being the Head Master.

480
00:44:37,036 --> 00:44:40,059
If you win, you must become
the Head Master and this woman mustn't leave.

481
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:04,055
Little Master!

482
00:46:05,052 --> 00:46:08,023
Beat the Jap friend out of Jingwu School!

483
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:45,099
Little Master!

484
00:47:49,012 --> 00:47:50,043
Are you alright?

485
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,075
Are you ok?

486
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,027
I lost.
You are the Head Master.

487
00:47:59,024 --> 00:48:00,087
I don't want to be.

488
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,019
I will not seperate from Mitsuko.

489
00:48:03,056 --> 00:48:05,067
If I have to make the choice...

490
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:08,075
I will leave Jingwu School.

491
00:48:37,032 --> 00:48:39,035
Are you going back
to Shangtung? It's chaotic there!

492
00:48:45,068 --> 00:48:47,055
Mitsuko, wait here.

493
00:48:51,068 --> 00:48:53,055
Boss, any rooms?

494
00:48:53,076 --> 00:48:55,095
Yes, please enter.

495
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,043
They have a room.

496
00:49:01,096 --> 00:49:03,079
A Japanese? Impossible!

497
00:49:05,036 --> 00:49:07,019
She is my wife, please let us stay.

498
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,059
- Isn't that Chen Zhen?
- Damn Japanese traitor!

499
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:12,063
Jingwu traitor!

500
00:49:16,048 --> 00:49:19,004
You are harming my business.
Leave!

501
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,091
Let's go.

502
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,079
GRAVE OF HUO YUEN-JlA

503
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:50,015
A mouse! On the furniture!

504
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:51,058
A mouse?

505
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,079
- Where?
- I saw it over there, really!

506
00:49:59,028 --> 00:50:00,071
It's gone.

507
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,083
Mice like such places very much.

508
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:13,063
I don't like this place.
It scares me.

509
00:50:14,008 --> 00:50:17,095
They were here first.
In fact we scare them!

510
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:20,046
I think you are right.

511
00:50:22,044 --> 00:50:26,011
I am very sorry...
To live with me in such a lousy hideout.

512
00:50:27,008 --> 00:50:29,075
After all it's a nice place.

513
00:50:30,004 --> 00:50:33,051
Wonderful landscape.
Much better than in any hotel room!

514
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:36,075
Is that what you want?
Let's move to a place like this then!

515
00:50:36,096 --> 00:50:38,079
Are you giving up Jingwu School then?

516
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:42,071
Jingwu School has given up on me.

517
00:50:42,092 --> 00:50:45,048
After all, at least I can
relax without this burden.

518
00:50:45,068 --> 00:50:47,051
This doesn't sound like Chen Zhen.

519
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:48,099
Why?

520
00:50:49,032 --> 00:50:52,083
You are lying to yourself.
You can't live without Jingwu School.

521
00:50:53,004 --> 00:50:54,075
How can you relax!

522
00:50:56,076 --> 00:51:00,011
Chen Zhen is lying.
Mitsuko has found out the truth!

523
00:51:02,072 --> 00:51:04,015
Really?

524
00:51:17,096 --> 00:51:19,059
Uncle Nong, have some Tea.

525
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:22,099
Thanks. Have you eaten yet?

526
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:25,007
I am not hungry.

527
00:51:26,072 --> 00:51:28,055
Ting-En still hasn't returned?

528
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,035
He has a hard time,
he's never lost a fight before.

529
00:51:34,056 --> 00:51:37,012
The match against Chen Zhen
must have been a great burden for him.

530
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:41,007
He has a bad temper.
Maybe he is not willing to come back.

531
00:51:41,068 --> 00:51:43,091
But who can be the Head Master then?

532
00:51:44,012 --> 00:51:46,035
Huo's Michung Fist must stay in the family!

533
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,031
How can Master rest in
peace if nobody carries on with it?

534
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,051
Who is teaching at the moment?

535
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:55,083
Cheung and Biu.

536
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,015
What should we do if a challenger arrives?

537
00:52:02,076 --> 00:52:04,047
My mother wrote a letter.

538
00:52:04,068 --> 00:52:07,047
It says that Jingwu offended the Japanese.

539
00:52:07,076 --> 00:52:09,063
She asks me to leave here.

540
00:52:10,028 --> 00:52:12,058
So what? Will you leave?

541
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,063
I don't know what to do!

542
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,030
Don't worry. This is still British territory!

543
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:19,031
The Japanese can't enter here, can they?

544
00:52:27,028 --> 00:52:29,015
You Chinese love to waste everything?

545
00:52:29,036 --> 00:52:31,043
Two serving for one table!

546
00:52:33,064 --> 00:52:34,039
What is it?

547
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,047
I want to see your Head Master.

548
00:52:38,032 --> 00:52:40,055
He is not here.
What do you want?

549
00:52:41,048 --> 00:52:44,083
The champion of the the Black Dragon Clan,
Master Funakoshi Fumio

550
00:52:45,084 --> 00:52:47,095
wants to challenge your Head Master.

551
00:53:00,064 --> 00:53:01,059
What are we going to do now?

552
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,007
- Find Ting-En!
- Useless, better find Chen Zhen!

553
00:53:05,028 --> 00:53:06,042
We don't want a traitor!

554
00:53:06,064 --> 00:53:08,075
- Mind your words!
- Isn't he a traitor?

555
00:53:08,096 --> 00:53:11,091
Stop it! Don't argue!
This will lead us nowhere!

556
00:53:12,012 --> 00:53:15,011
Find Little Master!
Hurry up!

557
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,007
Uncle Gun...

558
00:53:25,056 --> 00:53:26,083
Cheung.

559
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:32,031
- Where did Little Master go?
- How do I know?

560
00:53:35,076 --> 00:53:36,098
What's up Uncle Gun?

561
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,031
Don't pretend!
Where is my son?

562
00:53:44,024 --> 00:53:46,039
We can talk about this at night.

563
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,095
You said if I poison
Master Huo you will release my son!

564
00:53:49,016 --> 00:53:50,011
Listen, it isn't that easy!

565
00:53:50,032 --> 00:53:53,011
Your son is a
convicted murderer in Shangtung!

566
00:53:53,032 --> 00:53:55,007
You promised!

567
00:53:55,028 --> 00:53:58,011
Did I promise?
The Japs said that!

568
00:53:58,032 --> 00:53:59,046
My daughter-in-law told me

569
00:53:59,068 --> 00:54:02,027
that my son was
already killed in the prison!

570
00:54:02,048 --> 00:54:04,078
You already killed Huo,
so what can you do about it?

571
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,039
Besides we paid you very well!

572
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,043
You didn't hesitate when we gave you the money?

573
00:54:10,092 --> 00:54:13,038
If the Japs promised you,
your son is surely alright!

574
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,043
Now stop the talking about this matter!

575
00:54:19,036 --> 00:54:22,019
You told me the drug will not kill Master Huo.

576
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,047
If I had known that beforehand,
I would rather have let my son die.

577
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,063
Help!

578
00:54:39,072 --> 00:54:41,063
Uncle Gun has
commited suicide!

579
00:54:43,036 --> 00:54:45,059
Help me get him down! Quick!

580
00:54:46,008 --> 00:54:48,059
Help me! Hurry up!

581
00:54:58,072 --> 00:55:01,007
We found this under his body!

582
00:55:01,028 --> 00:55:02,031
What is it?

583
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:07,054
This is for Master's asthma,
Tien-En's friend brought it from Nang Yeung.

584
00:55:09,008 --> 00:55:13,051
Hey! Master Huo was the only one at Jingwu to eat this!

585
00:55:14,096 --> 00:55:18,079
Gun could have used this
food for poisoning Master Huo...

586
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,091
Then he felt too guilty and commited suicide.

587
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:25,011
He is already dead.
Please don't make it public.

588
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:27,091
If people hear of this,
it will hurt Jingwu's reputation even more.

589
00:55:28,012 --> 00:55:30,075
Jingwu will perish anyway, no matter what!

590
00:55:30,096 --> 00:55:33,091
Chen Zhen has left,
Ting-En has disappeared.

591
00:55:34,012 --> 00:55:37,063
You need a new Head Master, and this very soon!

592
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,039
Where have we come to?

593
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:43,035
What would Master Huo say about all this?

594
00:55:46,068 --> 00:55:48,079
Captain, what shall we do?

595
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,023
You are the Captain today, why ask me?

596
00:55:51,044 --> 00:55:53,079
Please help me out.

597
00:55:54,036 --> 00:55:56,074
Take this stuff for analysis.

598
00:55:57,088 --> 00:56:00,031
Please help me look for Ting-En.

599
00:56:00,052 --> 00:56:02,023
I will, don't worry!

600
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,003
Miss, are you looking for someone?

601
00:56:26,052 --> 00:56:29,031
Please tell me,
is Nong Jin-Sun here?

602
00:56:29,076 --> 00:56:31,091
He is inside,
please follow me.

603
00:56:37,012 --> 00:56:39,055
Uncle Nong, this Lady wants to see you.

604
00:56:39,084 --> 00:56:40,071
What is it?

605
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:42,091
Ting-En is at my place!

606
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:46,003
He refuses to come
back here, no matter what I say.

607
00:56:47,076 --> 00:56:50,011
Where is he?
Can you bring me there?

608
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,071
- Dizzy Star House.
- A brothel?

609
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:13,091
What's your relation with Ting-En?

610
00:57:15,044 --> 00:57:16,058
I know him for two years.

611
00:57:21,092 --> 00:57:24,027
He must have spent lots of money on you.

612
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:29,011
Don't worry. I will leave him.

613
00:57:30,052 --> 00:57:34,030
Ting-En isn't as bad as you may think now.

614
00:57:35,008 --> 00:57:37,035
He always hoped to establish Jingwu School.

615
00:57:37,056 --> 00:57:40,095
He told me he wants it to
be better than it was under his father.

616
00:57:42,056 --> 00:57:43,078
This is the truth.

617
00:57:44,012 --> 00:57:46,015
Uncle Nong, you have to help him!

618
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:06,011
Beat him!

619
00:58:09,016 --> 00:58:11,067
Let me fight them!
Let me go!

620
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:14,035
Let me go!

621
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:21,067
Little Master!

622
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:36,075
Sing, Biu, let's go home.

623
00:58:37,072 --> 00:58:41,023
What are you doing here?
Something wrong with Jingwu?

624
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:46,071
The Nijiguchi School has challengend Jingwu.

625
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,067
What about Chen Zhen?

626
00:58:50,044 --> 00:58:52,074
The Head Master must meet the challenge.

627
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:54,075
Not Chen Zhen.

628
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,075
Forget it. Let's go.

629
00:59:00,008 --> 00:59:01,006
Wait!

630
00:59:04,036 --> 00:59:05,075
I will go with you.

631
00:59:09,032 --> 00:59:10,091
You think you can make it?

632
00:59:12,032 --> 00:59:15,099
I won't let people look down
on Jingwu School, even if I should lose!

633
00:59:19,096 --> 00:59:21,010
One moment!

634
00:59:23,096 --> 00:59:25,099
What about this lady?

635
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:30,075
You can't leave her here all alone.

636
00:59:31,048 --> 00:59:33,003
This is no way to treat a woman.

637
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,047
Get the chief.

638
00:59:37,036 --> 00:59:39,031
I want you to bail her out!

639
00:59:43,072 --> 00:59:46,091
Hsiao-Hung, won't you miss your shiny dresses?

640
00:59:47,012 --> 00:59:49,091
It's an honour that I can dress like you do!

641
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,059
This cloth looks old.
I will find you new ones tomorrow.

642
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,071
I've checked.

643
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,083
Funakoshi Fumio is the
number one warrior of the Black Dragon Clan.

644
01:00:00,004 --> 01:00:01,087
But he is too old.

645
01:00:02,052 --> 01:00:03,043
Uncle Nong.

646
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:07,019
Now you look decent!

647
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:14,095
You better use your real name
from now on, So-Lan.

648
01:00:17,004 --> 01:00:20,007
Why didn't you treat Mitsuko the same way?

649
01:00:20,056 --> 01:00:22,094
That's different.
Mitsuko is Japanese.

650
01:00:23,016 --> 01:00:26,031
Ting-En, we only have 10 days until the duel.

651
01:00:39,088 --> 01:00:41,047
Thanks. Biu, go on.

652
01:00:48,036 --> 01:00:50,003
You treat Ting-En very well.

653
01:00:51,044 --> 01:00:52,063
Everybody's treated the same way.

654
01:00:57,016 --> 01:00:59,075
Is his Kung Fu the best at Jingwu School?
- Yes.

655
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,059
What about Chen Zhen?

656
01:01:06,056 --> 01:01:08,071
They are equal.

657
01:01:15,028 --> 01:01:16,067
Sorry, Little Master.

658
01:01:16,088 --> 01:01:18,067
- Are you ok?

659
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,075
Go on.

660
01:01:24,012 --> 01:01:26,095
What's wrong with him?
- He seems to be somewhere else.

661
01:01:27,048 --> 01:01:28,099
BLACK DRAGON CLAN
FUNAKOSHl FUMlO

662
01:01:38,012 --> 01:01:41,055
Spirit Table of
Akutagawa Ryuichi

663
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:08,031
Master Funakoshi, we have
sent the ultimatum to the Jingwu School.

664
01:02:15,028 --> 01:02:17,035
Make sure that I chose my opponents.

665
01:02:17,056 --> 01:02:21,031
And not the military.

666
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,011
Have you got that?

667
01:02:23,048 --> 01:02:26,015
All the expenses of the Black Dragon Clan in China

668
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:29,087
are paid by the Japanese army.

669
01:02:32,036 --> 01:02:33,079
That does not matter.

670
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,056
You can leave the
Black Dragon Clan if you want to.

671
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,099
Your chairman won't agree to this.

672
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,062
Don't try to opress me with the chairman.

673
01:02:46,056 --> 01:02:48,051
I am only a martial arts master.

674
01:02:49,028 --> 01:02:50,079
Not a politician.

675
01:02:53,024 --> 01:02:56,043
CHALLENGE

676
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,059
Already awake?

677
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:11,006
Good Morning.

678
01:03:19,048 --> 01:03:21,003
Are you Master Funakoshi?

679
01:03:22,056 --> 01:03:23,047
Uncle Funakoshi?

680
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:25,047
Mitsukotu, why do you live so far away?

681
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:27,063
I would have taken a
carriage if i had known before!

682
01:03:27,084 --> 01:03:29,011
Did father send you?

683
01:03:29,032 --> 01:03:31,091
I haven't seen your father for a long time.

684
01:03:32,012 --> 01:03:33,099
Then why are you here?

685
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:36,011
Because of him.

686
01:03:36,056 --> 01:03:37,083
Chen Zhen?

687
01:03:38,096 --> 01:03:40,043
Are you two married?

688
01:03:40,064 --> 01:03:42,003
No.

689
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,015
But aren't you living together?

690
01:03:44,036 --> 01:03:48,011
Neither Chinese nor
Japanese would accept if we married.

691
01:03:48,068 --> 01:03:50,087
Lucky you aren't married.

692
01:03:51,032 --> 01:03:55,023
If he dies, you won't be a widow.

693
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,047
What did you say?

694
01:03:56,088 --> 01:03:59,099
If you should die,
I will send your ashes back to Japan.

695
01:04:00,052 --> 01:04:04,003
Young Man, you are quite confident.

696
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:08,071
You want to fight?
Why didn't you tell me before?

697
01:04:08,092 --> 01:04:11,059
Men don't have to tell everything to women.

698
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:14,023
Chen Zhen, come.

699
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:27,003
Tell me, what is the most powerful stroke?

700
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,031
Concentrate all your energy on one focal point,
then hit!

701
01:04:39,052 --> 01:04:41,063
This is really powerful.

702
01:04:41,084 --> 01:04:46,011
But stones don't hit back like humans do.

703
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:49,023
What will be the most powerful stroke then?

704
01:04:51,052 --> 01:04:54,015
Enough theories. Let's do some practice.

705
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,047
How about the best defence?

706
01:04:57,012 --> 01:04:57,099
Attack!

707
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:00,083
Why waste energy defending,
when you can attack?

708
01:05:01,004 --> 01:05:03,019
Strike the opponent in the shortest time possible!

709
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,039
Huo style seems similar to Karate.

710
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:09,071
Based on attacking first.

711
01:05:09,092 --> 01:05:11,039
You don't understand, do you?

712
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:13,031
Hard without soft only wastes energy.

713
01:05:13,052 --> 01:05:16,031
Soft without hard can't strike either.

714
01:05:16,064 --> 01:05:18,047
Old Master, how do you teach your students?

715
01:05:20,088 --> 01:05:22,087
Has your master taught you that?

716
01:05:23,008 --> 01:05:25,043
Bad temper is the weak point in a match.

717
01:05:25,064 --> 01:05:27,087
Young Man, you will lose with this attitude!

718
01:05:28,068 --> 01:05:31,039
My master never talked that much.
Are you going to fight?

719
01:05:39,016 --> 01:05:39,075
Wait!

720
01:06:05,016 --> 01:06:06,038
Wait!

721
01:06:07,072 --> 01:06:09,063
I am old. I must warm up a bit first.

722
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,023
What kind of style is this?

723
01:07:22,044 --> 01:07:24,043
Don't ask. If it wins, it's a good one!

724
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:43,099
Are your eyes alright?

725
01:08:45,024 --> 01:08:46,067
I'm fine.

726
01:08:47,072 --> 01:08:49,043
I don't want to take any advantage.

727
01:11:13,048 --> 01:11:14,087
It's over!

728
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,087
Are you alright?

729
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,043
It's not easy to be so young and so talented!

730
01:11:23,096 --> 01:11:25,063
Very rare!

731
01:11:25,092 --> 01:11:28,015
You have much energy for such an age!

732
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,043
Chinese say:

733
01:11:30,064 --> 01:11:33,099
"The Old fear the strength of the Youth"
It's true.

734
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,520
But, I have lost!

735
01:11:40,068 --> 01:11:43,019
I adopted your fighting style.

736
01:11:43,072 --> 01:11:47,042
Chinese martial arts always
emphasize on personal well-being.

737
01:11:47,064 --> 01:11:50,043
Not the battles.
You actually surprised me.

738
01:11:51,084 --> 01:11:53,087
The objective of matching is to beat the opponent.

739
01:11:54,084 --> 01:11:56,011
Wrong, young man.

740
01:11:56,032 --> 01:12:00,027
The best way to beat the opponent
is to do it with a gun.

741
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:05,023
The goal of Kung Fu is to maximize one's energy

742
01:12:05,044 --> 01:12:08,059
and to develop a higher physical level.

743
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,010
To achieve that, you must
understand life and the universe.

744
01:12:11,032 --> 01:12:13,095
Never forget that.

745
01:12:14,032 --> 01:12:16,011
I have to go. Take care.

746
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,099
Aren't we fighting?

747
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:24,031
Fighting is for animals.

748
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:26,055
The fight ended in a draw.

749
01:12:28,012 --> 01:12:31,003
However, I am not representing all Japanese warriors.

750
01:12:31,092 --> 01:12:33,099
In Japan, there are many even more powerful than me.

751
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,023
Master, aren't you the best in Japan?

752
01:12:37,044 --> 01:12:41,006
To say he is the best, is to speak of his wisdom.

753
01:12:41,032 --> 01:12:43,031
Not his expertise in killing.

754
01:12:45,016 --> 01:12:46,099
Master Huo Yuen Jia, I have lost.

755
01:12:47,048 --> 01:12:50,095
I never would have expected you
to have such a good student.

756
01:12:54,012 --> 01:12:56,091
Now, the best at the Nijiguchi

757
01:12:57,012 --> 01:13:00,007
is Fujita Gou, called the "Killing Machine".

758
01:13:00,068 --> 01:13:02,079
Young Man, take care of yourself.

759
01:13:21,036 --> 01:13:22,031
I have won!

760
01:13:26,088 --> 01:13:29,011
Your Go skills have improved.

761
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,047
Too bad life is not as easy as a Go game.

762
01:13:35,092 --> 01:13:37,047
Only a few years ago, Dr. Sun Yat Sen
was a good friend of the Kokuryo.

763
01:13:37,068 --> 01:13:41,019
Now they have changed.

764
01:13:42,016 --> 01:13:46,003
Just like the military...

765
01:13:47,088 --> 01:13:50,023
..they want to conquer China.

766
01:13:51,044 --> 01:13:53,027
Conquer China?

767
01:13:55,024 --> 01:13:57,039
They are daydreaming.

768
01:13:57,092 --> 01:13:59,091
It's not a dream!

769
01:14:00,012 --> 01:14:02,031
The Japanese army based in China

770
01:14:02,052 --> 01:14:04,075
has already more than half of China's military strength.

771
01:14:05,092 --> 01:14:08,003
I learned from you already

772
01:14:08,024 --> 01:14:10,062
that Japan is now like a very strong ant

773
01:14:13,028 --> 01:14:14,059
which wants to eat a sleeping elephant.

774
01:14:14,096 --> 01:14:18,055
While the Elephant sleeps,
the ant seems to gain some advantage.

775
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:22,011
But once the elephant wakes up, the ant has no chance!

776
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:26,007
Don't you agree on that?

777
01:14:26,064 --> 01:14:28,035
But as I see it

778
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:32,011
the elephant is still asleep.

779
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:35,043
Thus, there is more than one ant looking for a chance...

780
01:14:36,008 --> 01:14:37,059
The elephant will wake up.

781
01:14:42,088 --> 01:14:45,087
Of course. Too bad...

782
01:14:46,008 --> 01:14:48,079
that most of the Japanese won't believe you or me.

783
01:14:49,024 --> 01:14:50,079
For the past decades

784
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,027
Japan received the majority of benefit from winning wars.

785
01:14:54,096 --> 01:14:57,015
Japan wishes to become a strong Empire.

786
01:14:57,088 --> 01:15:00,007
People like General Fujita

787
01:15:01,068 --> 01:15:03,083
are not seldom in Japan.

788
01:15:04,052 --> 01:15:05,083
Seeing all these factors.....

789
01:15:06,088 --> 01:15:08,071
a war seems inevitable!

790
01:15:34,004 --> 01:15:34,079
You are back!

791
01:15:38,072 --> 01:15:39,035
Good evening.

792
01:15:41,072 --> 01:15:43,043
- Where is Chen Zhen?
- He is out.

793
01:15:47,096 --> 01:15:49,039
Have a seat.

794
01:16:06,076 --> 01:16:08,015
Have some tea.

795
01:16:08,092 --> 01:16:09,083
Thanks.

796
01:16:16,044 --> 01:16:17,087
You learned to speak Chinese?

797
01:16:19,004 --> 01:16:20,002
A little.

798
01:16:23,008 --> 01:16:24,055
You speak well.

799
01:16:29,012 --> 01:16:32,015
Chen, you are back! Mr. Huo is here to see you.

800
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,058
Where have you been? Keeping you busy?

801
01:16:50,004 --> 01:16:52,003
I found a job in the telegram station.

802
01:16:53,024 --> 01:16:55,062
- Did you really give up Jingwu?
- Doesn't matter now.

803
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,075
As I am not at Jingwu School,

804
01:16:59,016 --> 01:17:01,051
my current job is meaningful too.

805
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,015
Jingwu needs you to come back.

806
01:17:12,012 --> 01:17:14,023
I also brought Hsiao-Hung back.

807
01:17:14,064 --> 01:17:16,023
From the Dizzy Star?

808
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:18,067
Haven't you met her?

809
01:17:18,088 --> 01:17:19,059
Congratulations!

810
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:22,047
You can bring Mitsuko along to Jingwu.

811
01:17:25,052 --> 01:17:28,075
She is Japanese.

812
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,007
They won't accept her...

813
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,043
She has done so much for you.
She is a nice girl.

814
01:17:36,096 --> 01:17:38,071
But what would outsiders say?

815
01:17:38,092 --> 01:17:42,003
Jingwu School's reputation would be affected.

816
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:44,011
I can't be so selfish.

817
01:17:45,092 --> 01:17:47,023
I've learned a new style lately.

818
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,039
- Which one?
- Let me show you.

819
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,007
It's like the Huo Fist!

820
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,035
Yes. It's the Huo Michung Fist.

821
01:18:29,068 --> 01:18:31,098
Master said this style is not for others but for Huos.

822
01:18:32,056 --> 01:18:36,063
This is to be kept among Jingwu forever.

823
01:18:37,032 --> 01:18:39,043
Chen Zhen, promise me.

824
01:18:39,072 --> 01:18:42,075
I have to go to the challenge tomorrow.

825
01:18:43,016 --> 01:18:45,079
If anything happens to me...
teach it to the others at Jingwu School for me.

826
01:19:09,008 --> 01:19:12,099
Sorry, I decided to leave immediately.

827
01:19:13,056 --> 01:19:17,043
There are things in life more important than love.

828
01:19:17,096 --> 01:19:21,023
While I am not with you
you can achieve even more.

829
01:19:22,068 --> 01:19:25,099
Fulfil your promise to Ting-En.
When the Japanese army returns to Japan,

830
01:19:26,084 --> 01:19:29,019
I will wait for you in Kyoto.

831
01:20:20,016 --> 01:20:21,055
I will take only Lun with me.

832
01:20:21,076 --> 01:20:24,055
Ting-En, I am very worried.

833
01:20:24,076 --> 01:20:26,019
Don't you need more people?

834
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:30,083
Nothing to worry. The Japs
will think we are scared if more people go.

835
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,066
Right.
Wait for me.

836
01:20:34,096 --> 01:20:38,019
Hsiao-Wei, please take care of Hsiao Hong.

837
01:20:43,084 --> 01:20:44,095
Ting-En!

838
01:20:49,012 --> 01:20:51,027
I can speak Japanese, let me help you!

839
01:20:56,024 --> 01:20:57,019
Let's go!

840
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:03,019
They are going together. It will be alright now.

841
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:07,059
General, Master Fumio left for Shanghai early this morning.

842
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,067
Stubborn old man!

843
01:21:09,088 --> 01:21:12,055
If he doesn't cooperate, he is the enemy of the military.

844
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:14,075
Send the news to Tokyo!

845
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,095
General, should we cancel the
challenge with the Jingwu School?

846
01:21:21,072 --> 01:21:24,091
No. We don't have to rely on the Kokuryo Clan anymore.

847
01:21:25,068 --> 01:21:28,014
I will handle Jingwu myself.

848
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,079
Both of you are here. Excellent!

849
01:21:52,052 --> 01:21:57,007
Mr. Huo, I have good news for you.
We found the Murderer.

850
01:22:01,056 --> 01:22:02,070
Come in!

851
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,083
He was bribed...

852
01:22:14,016 --> 01:22:16,075
...to put the poison in your father's food.

853
01:22:16,096 --> 01:22:18,055
He is a traitor.

854
01:22:30,068 --> 01:22:32,091
No need to be afraid. Take him out.

855
01:22:36,092 --> 01:22:39,022
Nobody is allowed to enter without my order.

856
01:22:40,008 --> 01:22:41,079
Everybody out!

857
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,091
SICK MAN OF ASIA

858
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:52,003
If you lose, I will give this sign to you.

859
01:22:52,024 --> 01:22:54,007
It's my personal hand-writing.

860
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,011
Catch!

861
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:07,031
Can you walk?

862
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,062
Don't move!

863
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:31,099
General.

864
01:32:38,076 --> 01:32:41,067
Mr. Ambassador, General Fujita is dead.

865
01:32:48,016 --> 01:32:49,091
Don't move or we will shoot!

866
01:32:50,072 --> 01:32:52,015
Take it easy!

867
01:32:52,036 --> 01:32:53,023
- You ok?
- Yes.

868
01:32:55,052 --> 01:32:59,011
You are only the police for the Brittish territory.

869
01:33:00,044 --> 01:33:03,047
I am not here as a policeman,
I am here as a Chinese!

870
01:33:03,068 --> 01:33:05,083
Chen and Huo will be brought back by us!

871
01:33:06,056 --> 01:33:09,007
What?
You think you can leave here safely?

872
01:33:11,048 --> 01:33:12,062
Don't move!

873
01:33:12,084 --> 01:33:14,035
Just try it, you even will die before me!

874
01:33:16,076 --> 01:33:17,031
Stop this!

875
01:33:19,012 --> 01:33:21,007
Everybody put down your weapons!

876
01:33:22,028 --> 01:33:26,047
I am sure we somehow can solve this peacefully.

877
01:33:27,036 --> 01:33:29,015
Fujita is already dead.

878
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:32,031
It is not neccessary to sacrifice anymore lives for him.

879
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,019
- Lieutenant!
- Yes!

880
01:33:34,056 --> 01:33:36,031
Take your men out of here.

881
01:33:36,096 --> 01:33:38,023
Mr. Ambassador!

882
01:33:39,012 --> 01:33:41,087
I am the highest official here.

883
01:33:42,044 --> 01:33:44,079
Do you want to disobey my order?

884
01:33:46,004 --> 01:33:47,095
Attention. Fall out!

885
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,071
Mr. Jie...

886
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,086
A Japanese officer has been killed.

887
01:34:02,028 --> 01:34:05,071
I need the murderer for the governmental report.

888
01:34:06,044 --> 01:34:08,035
You must understand that.

889
01:34:09,008 --> 01:34:11,015
Otherwise, the Japanese military won't give up on this.

890
01:34:11,036 --> 01:34:15,027
So, if I don't die, the military will
make use of this to start a war?

891
01:34:21,068 --> 01:34:24,067
In this case, I will sacrifice myself.

892
01:34:31,024 --> 01:34:34,039
Great! You are a real hero!

893
01:34:48,052 --> 01:34:51,003
Back off. Nothing to see here.

894
01:34:59,028 --> 01:35:00,083
Looks like Chen Zhen.

895
01:35:01,044 --> 01:35:02,091
Is he dead?

896
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,099
Why does the police treat the Japs so friendly?

897
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:26,011
It's not their fault. They are all the same.

898
01:35:26,032 --> 01:35:29,003
They are working together to bully the Chinese.

899
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:32,003
All they can do is bully the Chinese!

900
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:36,018
Chen Zhen was a real hero!

901
01:35:37,012 --> 01:35:41,007
He beat all his enemies in the Nijiguchi Area.

902
01:35:41,028 --> 01:35:43,023
It was fantastic!

903
01:35:45,008 --> 01:35:46,099
Too bad he had to die at such a young age.

904
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,075
- What is it?
- Nothing. Keep on talking!

905
01:36:00,008 --> 01:36:03,031
To imagine Cheung was the traitor.
He was so nice.

906
01:36:03,052 --> 01:36:06,023
At least he was of use as Chens replacement body.

907
01:36:08,052 --> 01:36:10,011
5th Senior, were are we heading?

908
01:36:10,032 --> 01:36:11,085
Which part of China would a battle
with Japan take place first?

909
01:36:11,095 --> 01:36:13,087
- Tungshan Province.
- Let's go there then.
