1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That camera again?

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I hate that.

3
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It hurts.

4
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Our...

5
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
...sex?

6
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
One photo a day.

7
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Today's looks almost the same as yesterday's.

8
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But her corpse
will continue to change from day to day.

9
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's almost as if it were alive.

10
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go back!

11
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What?

12
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
A zoo? You must be joking.

13
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Go back.

14
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What a shame.

15
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Say... do you think this happened;

16
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Suddenly one day, the animals
surpassed man's mediocrity...

17
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
...and all left this place?

18
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
How did they do that?
You need a key to open these cages!

19
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You are the key to your own cage.

20
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Is it open?

21
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This reminds me of one time when I was a child.
I gazed at a zebra this way for a long time.

22
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
When I looked fixedly at the black and white pattern...

23
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
...as if it was sucking me in,
I couldn't take my eyes off it.

24
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
When I awoke, nobody was around.

25
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I got lost.

26
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Alone, I walked around and around,
but couldn't find the exit.

27
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I felt like I was lost in a labyrinth.

28
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sorry.

29
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't take any more pictures.

30
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I told you I hate it, didn't I?

31
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
- Let's break up.
- Don't get angry!

32
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You must be a little tired.
Let's go rest a bit.

33
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If you prefer to stay right here,
I'll keep you company.

34
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Didn't you hear me?

35
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I said it's over between us.

36
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't you understand?
I can't live without you.

37
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Then...

38
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
go ahead and die.

39
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You still don't get it?

40
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're not the only man around.

41
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
After that,
where had the zebra vanished off to?

42
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The zoo...

43
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I can't find it!

44
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You still don't get it?

45
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You're not the only man around.

46
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
From then on, someone other than
me took her picture.

47
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
A picture a day.
One by one, they became like a poison.
