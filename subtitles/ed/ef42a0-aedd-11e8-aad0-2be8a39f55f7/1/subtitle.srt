1
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
"Kazari and Yooko"

2
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If my mom...

3
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
...tries to kill me...

4
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Without fail...

5
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll think of a clever way to fake my own suicide.

6
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Kazari and Yooko

7
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
- Wel...
- Welcome home mom, right?

8
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Welcome home mom.

9
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Welcome home mom.
Welcome home mom, right?!

10
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hey mom?
Can I have this?

11
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No you can't, Kazari.
I like that CD.

12
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
OK...

13
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're in my way.

14
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Good morning Yooko.

15
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Want to eat this?

16
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
- Mom...
- Easy now...

17
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
- I'm leaving now.
- Take care.

18
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Kazari's an angel,
a kind younger sister.

19
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I really love her.

20
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Missing: Male white terrier
by the name of Asou.

21
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Mitsuko Suzuki.

22
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Asou?

23
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ouch...

24
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yooko-chan.

25
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
- Good morning.
- Time to get up!

26
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hey, take your clothes off and show us
the marks on your body.

27
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't struggle!
It's OK, just a little!

28
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
- Cigarette burns.
- I knew it.

29
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You stink!

30
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you ever bath?!

31
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We'll get in trouble.
Let's get outta here.

32
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yooko?

33
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Mom's...

34
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How cute!!
Turn around!

35
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So cute!

36
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Mom's admiring me...
admiring Kazari.

37
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Mom always says...

38
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She gave birth to me...

39
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
so she's free to revive me
or to kill me as she pleases.

40
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Asou?

41
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Asou! It's Asou!
Come here, come here!

42
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Are you alright?

43
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
- Are you Mitsuko Suzuki?
- You've been safe!

44
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hey, hey!
Sit over here, OK?

45
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is handmade, but I wonder if it suits
a young person's taste.

46
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Here you are.

47
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't hesitate to eat.

48
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You can have this too, if you like.

49
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Here you are.

50
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Listen, this time let's do it this way.

51
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's delicious!

52
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's been so long since anyone
told me something like that.

53
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Asou!

54
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We haven't thanked Yooko-san, have we?

55
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll give you a nice present.

56
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I know!
Please have supper here tonight!

57
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Supper?

58
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's something kind people
like to eat, isn't it?

59
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yooko-san, you're so cute!

60
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
- Want some?
- Thanks!

61
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
- Want some?
- Thanks.

62
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Tomato... here!

63
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
- Here!
- Stop it!

64
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Here!

65
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I said stop it!

66
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Here.

67
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
No more, I'm gonna be sick!

68
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Amazing.
You'll eat anything, won't you, Yooko?

69
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
God...

70
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
this is secret from mom.

71
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Like this...

72
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You managed?
Alright.

73
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

74
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's delicious.

75
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm glad.

76
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm happy!

77
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hey. What is your twin sister like?

78
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Our faces are exactly the same...

79
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
but our personalities are completely opposite.

80
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
How interesting!

81
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
In what way are you different?

82
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Gloomy... disturbed...

83
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You hate that sort of child, don't you?

84
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I wonder in what way you've been
scolded to think that.

85
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There's must be a reason why you're gloomy.

86
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
People can change.
It's in our nature.

87
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Change.

88
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yooko-san.

89
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let me flatter you.

90
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's embarassing.

91
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Nonsense.

92
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Look at your smile.
You're very beautiful.

93
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm ugly.
I look like a clown!

94
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Not at all.
You need to learn to love yourself more.

95
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We get along well, don't you think?

96
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Why don't we take a trip together someday?

97
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Get on a boat, go wherever you please.
Start all over.

98
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
As best friends.

99
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I won't have to come back?

100
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
No, you won't.
We'll live somewhere we like.

101
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Mitsuko-san!

102
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
How do I follow that dream,
I wonder...

103
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Practise for our journey?
I like that.

104
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The present I was talking about earlier,
is this actually.

105
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This house already belongs to the two of us.

106
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You can come here whenever you want.

107
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's right!

108
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This too.

109
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll treasure them.

110
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Mitsuko-san.

111
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You stole this, didn't you?

112
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's just a one-off thing,
forgive her.

113
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Kazari, go to your room.

114
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Listen, want me to tell you something?

115
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
How I felt when had you?

116
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
When I learned I was carrying twins...

117
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
When I think back on that,
it makes me sick, it's so disgusting!

118
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You were excessive,
but still I gave birth to you.

119
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Hey! Hey!
Do you understand?!

120
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Mom... thank you.

121
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm confiscating this...

122
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
If you enter my room...

123
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
this time I'll definetely kill you, OK?

124
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Mom... I'm sorry.

125
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But...

126
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That key...
is a treasured, treasured present so...

127
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Mom'll be furious!

128
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Found it!

129
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Sorry.

130
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Mom will kill me.

131
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
"Mourning"

132
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
When I brought the kairanban over last night,
she wasn't even cold yet.

133
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
They say she had a stroke.
It was too quick, wasn't it.

134
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
This...

135
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What should we do with this dog?

136
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's too much.

137
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Suzuki-san...

138
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
People change...
Right, Suzuki-san?

139
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
People change.

140
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Change.

141
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Kazari?

142
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Listen...
You broke mom's computer earlier, didn't you?

143
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Mom... already knows.

144
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh really. Well then,
let's make it your fault.

145
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You're used to getting her angry, aren't you?

146
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What?

147
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Look, mom already knows.

148
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
She said you did it.

149
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
She yelled that her CD's were arranged
in the wrong order too.

150
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
No way!
I'd just drop dead.

151
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Look...
Then why don't we do this...

152
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Just for tonight...

153
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I become you...
and you become me?

154
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll change into you and apologise to her.

155
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What do you think?

156
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Hey Yooko, this outfit looks
really weird on me.

157
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You are... Yooko.

158
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I am... Kazari.

159
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Just for tonight, OK!

160
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So which one of us should go home first?

161
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Rock, scissors, paper~

162
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I won, OK?

163
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Kazari, you go inside first.

164
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Suzuki-san.

165
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Mom, I'm sorry.

166
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I couldn't respond to your love.

167
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm going to kill myself.

168
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Goodbye mom.

169
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I really loved you.

170
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yooko.

171
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Well written, Kazari.

172
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,500
Yooko suddenly ran to the balcony...

173
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I didn't have time to stop her.

174
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You tried to stab Yooko, didn't you?

175
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Kazari, you can't be serious?

176
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Don't say such sad things.

177
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yooko really loved you, mom.

178
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
"Mom and I resemble each other",
she always used to say.

179
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yooko.

180
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Mom, I was a truly pitiful person,
wasn't I?

181
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
If it's scraps of carrots,
I'll eat them!

182
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Whatever I did,
I'm going to live!

183
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I've got Asou.
And I'm as strong as iron inside.

184
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Ouch.

185
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Satoshi.

186
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Satoshi!

187
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Ouch.

188
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What is this place?

189
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Huh?

190
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I think someone beat you up, sis.

191
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And after that, someone beat me up too.

192
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Hey! Anyone there?!

193
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Open up!

194
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Cut it out!
You crying?

195
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But, someone's trying to hurt us, right?

196
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Eat!

197
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I don't need it.

198
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But it might be poisoned...

199
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I want to go to the bathroom!

200
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Go in that. It's there instead of
a toilet, I'm sure.

201
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's disgusting, sis!

202
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Hang on.
Go over there.

203
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
If it leads to the outside,
go notify the police.

204
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Don't let the bad guys discover you.

205
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It itches.

206
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What the hell!
Let me see the cool kid in you!

207
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
- From the day you were born...
- I get it, I get it!

208
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Why'd you come back, you idiot?!

209
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
- I couldn't get outside!
- You stink!

210
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You stink, don't come any closer!

211
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
There are other rooms here.

212
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Save me. Save me. Save me!

213
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
There were three more rooms over there.

214
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
All the same as this one, no windows,
and the doors are closed there too.

215
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Women are waiting alone in them.

216
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Who locked us up in here?

217
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Don't know.
It seems they all were kidnapped.

218
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So you couldn't get into the
room beyond that one?

219
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Well then, this time try going this way.

220
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You go, sis!

221
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I can't go in there,
that's why I'm asking you!

222
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You're not asking me to,
you're ordering me to!

223
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm not evil!

224
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
A college student?

225
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah.
She said she was caught yesterday.

226
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
They kidnap a woman every day?
That's insane.

227
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There was no one in the next room.

228
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
A vacant room?

229
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Was there anyone in the room after that one?

230
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
What is it?

231
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
There was someone
who seemed kinda bad.

232
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
In what way?

233
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Kinda... like she'd gone nuts.
That kind of person.

234
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You saw him too, didn't you?!

235
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Right?!
You saw him, didn't you?!

236
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You too...

237
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
your sister too...

238
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
you're gonna be killed!!

239
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
We're all going to die.

240
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
He's gonna kill me tomorrow!

241
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Chop me up into little pieces.

242
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Throw me in there!!

243
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
She said that at 6 o'clock every night...

244
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
a body comes flowing through there.

245
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
What's that?

246
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
A body can't flow through there can it?

247
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Nobody else said anything about it.
I'm sure it's not true!

248
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Go ahead and eat.

249
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I told you I don't need it, didn't I?

250
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You wanna die?!

251
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's not poisoned.
They're delivered to the other rooms too.

252
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So what about my share?

253
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You said you didn't need it, didn't you.

254
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
- Sis, I want some too.
- You ate it all yourself yesterday, didn't you.

255
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You came back.

256
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You must be having a hard time too.

257
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Say... my older sister asked me to collect
everyone's personal belongings.

258
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
By themselves they might be useless,
but if we put them together they might be of use.

259
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And it wouldn't just be for your own gain?

260
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
If we can save ourselves,
we'll save everyone, won't we!

261
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I wonder...

262
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Can something like this be of use?

263
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Too early for you yet, huh?

264
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
What is this?

265
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
How long have have you been here?

266
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Three days today.

267
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I've been here for six days.

268
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Do you have a watch or something?

269
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Aren't you hungry?

270
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
My sister ate all the bread herself.

271
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Did you really go ask everyone?

272
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
This is it?!

273
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I told you that's all!

274
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It's true. Yesterday I met someone
in the vacant room.

275
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
She said they got her
while she was out jogging last night.

276
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Then... it's one day for her today.

277
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's been three days for you and me.

278
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
For the college student, it's been two days.

279
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
The girl in this room said
she's been here for six days already.

280
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
The girl in that room...

281
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
...has gone.

282
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Gone?

283
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Mhm. Wonder if she's gone outside...

284
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
This is the girl in the room furthest from ours!

285
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Why's this happening?!

286
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Why?!

287
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Every day,
he comes to attack the next one in line.

288
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The one who was locked up six days ago.

289
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
At 6 o'clock, he chops them up.

290
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm sure he never takes a day off.

291
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Like toothbrushing,
it has to be done everyday.

292
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
He won't kill you will he?

293
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You'll probably escape, and live a long life.

294
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm jealous.

295
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
If it was your turn today,
would you want to know about it?

296
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
What if it were you, sis?
Would you want to know?

297
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Great, you came!

298
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Your sister can use this if she likes.

299
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Are you sure?

300
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I won't be needing it anymore.

301
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
But...

302
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Why are we being killed?

303
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I don't know!

304
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Warm, aren't you...

305
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Someone's coming.
He'll find me!

306
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
He's coming to kill me!

307
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I don't want to die alone!

308
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
No, no, no...

309
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Satoshi!

310
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Shit!!

311
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I thought he'd killed you too.

312
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
What kind of person was it?

313
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I couldn't see his face.

314
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But it was a huge guy.

315
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
If we attack him together,
don't you think we could win?

316
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
He has a chainsaw.

317
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
The door, it seems it has a pole lock.

318
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It sounded that way when he opened it!

319
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
So that means doesn't lock with a key?

320
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Don't come any closer!
I won't let you hurt my little brother!

321
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Satochi!

322
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
After he comes here,
he'll try to kill us right away.

323
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
But, he won't know you'll leave the room.

324
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
You'll go and let everyone out.

325
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
If you enter that way,
I'm sure everyone will understand.

326
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
But what about you, sis?

327
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
This way!

328
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Let's go!

329
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Hurry up!

330
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I want to go home real soon.

331
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
When we get home, please take a bath.
You seriously stink.

332
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
What did you think when I was born?

333
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,500
What's this? Honestly, I didn't feel
there was any connection between us.

334
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Sis...

335
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Let's go call the police.

336
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
"3 people were seriously injured..."

337
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
"...traffic accident..."

338
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
When did you get back?

339
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Want me to give you a hand with that?

340
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I'm OK.

341
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I see.

342
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Keep at it.

343
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You're just drinking juice again?

344
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
No homework?

345
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yeah. But dad told me to
keep working on my puzzle.

346
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Your dad isn't here, is he?

347
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Huh?

348
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
So for my sake,
please do your homework.

349
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Alright.

350
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
If you do your homework over there,
you'll ruin your eyes.

351
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Now, let's go get something sweet to eat.

352
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Hey... what about mom?

353
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
From that day on,
dad wasn't able to see mom.

354
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And mom wasn't able to see dad.

355
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Ah!

356
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It's dad.

357
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I know it's painful but...
your dad is gone.

358
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
From now on, it's just the two of us.

359
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Let's do our best, OK?

360
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Hey! Which boxed dinner would you like?

361
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Do you remember that day your dad
and I went out in the car?

362
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Your dad was driving,
when an accident happened.

363
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
In the end...

364
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
only I was saved.

365
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Your mom and I went over to your uncle's house.

366
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And after that, we were in a car accident.

367
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I was safe...
but your mother...

368
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Hey... where have the scissors gone?

369
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Want me to ask dad?

370
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Hey dad, where are the scissors?

371
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
In a kitchen drawer, aren't they?

372
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
He said they're in a kitchen drawer.

373
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I can see dad!

374
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Mom is right here!

375
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So it's not just you and me, dad.

376
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
If there's anything you want her to know,
I'll tell her for you, OK?

377
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You can, can't you?
It really seems that way.

378
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I don't know what she's talking about.

379
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Ask her when that happened.

380
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
He wants to know when that happened.

381
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
All the time.

382
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
He doesn't say it, but he's always thinking it.

383
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
All the time, she says.
Mom looks sad.

384
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I'm more sad than she is.

385
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Face reality a bit more, will you.

386
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Boring, isn't it?

387
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Mom went into the bedroom.
Is that OK?

388
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Leave me alone.

389
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Well... go tell your mom

390
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
"I'm really glad you're not around anymore".

391
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
What did your dad say?

392
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
He said he's glad you're not around anymore.

393
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Well then...
Tell him this:

394
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I really...

395
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Something burst...

396
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
...inside me.

397
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I'm sorry about before.

398
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Want some black tea?

399
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Juice.

400
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Wait here, OK?

401
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
No matter how much she might have yelled earlier,
she was no match for me.

402
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Will you go ask your mom
about tomorrow?

403
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
What? Is something wrong?

404
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Dad's world and mom's world were starting
to become separate from eachother.

405
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
What's wrong?

406
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I've become unable to see you together.

407
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
You and mom...

408
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Why can't I see the both of you?

409
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
What do you mean?

410
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I'm not able to see both you and mom.

411
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Come over here.

412
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
That's not how it is.

413
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I'm sorry.

414
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Listen... mom...

415
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Do you remember what you always used to say?

416
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
What's that?

417
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
"From now on, it's just the two of us,
so let's do our best".

418
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I remember.

419
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I...

420
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I want to live in your world, mom.

421
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
After that, I became unable to see dad.

422
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
You say your father passed away in a car accident?

423
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Well then, who's that standing
right behind you?

424
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
There is nobody there.

425
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
It seems he's become unable to see his father.

426
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
He can hear my wife's voice, but it
seems he can't hear mine.

427
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
If he takes his hand, it seems he simply can't feel it,
even if his mind's used to it.

428
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
When I try to hug him, he just becomes like a doll.

429
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
So basically...

430
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
The two of you were quarreling.

431
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
And you both created a world in
which your partner had died.

432
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Living with you lead your child
into believing in that world.

433
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And he became like this.

434
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
That's about right, isn't it?

435
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Mom and dad weren't in an accident.

436
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
It's sad that I became unable to see dad but...

437
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I definetely think it was for the best.

438
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Because I really wanted mom and dad
to be together again.

439
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
"Poem of collected sunlight"

440
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Good morning.

441
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
- Who are you?
- I'm the human who created you.

442
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
- Stand up.
- Yes.

443
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
- Follow me, please.
- Yes.

444
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Happy birthday.

445
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Is that the sun?

446
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Exposure to sunlight, even a small
amount has made my temperature rise.

447
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Let's go.

448
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
The house in that forest down there...

449
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
That's where you'll keep me company.

450
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Come inside.

451
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
First, I'd like you to make coffee.

452
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I know what coffee is,
but I don't know how it's made.

453
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
That's right, isn't it.

454
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Now, let's drink.

455
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I've memorized how it's made,
so from now on I'll make it.

456
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
How was it?

457
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I hate this flavor.

458
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
That's good. I made you that way.

459
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Now drink it.

460
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
The sweet taste made it easier to drink.

461
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
It allows the coffee to be
normally absorbed inside my body.

462
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,000
The people in that picture,
where are they now?

463
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Thery're not anywhere anymore.

464
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
What are you going to do with that?

465
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I want you to learn gardening.

466
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

467
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
- It's delicious, but maybe a bit too salty.
- I understand.

468
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Do you know what this is?

469
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
A rabbit did it.

470
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Then that's what I saw this morning.

471
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
But knowing it's been at our food
gives me an unpleasant feeling.

472
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
In 47300032000~ seconds...

473
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I will become inactive.

474
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
In time, every living thing will,
without fail, become inactive.

475
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,000
That's a beautiful sound. The wind makes it.
It's coincidental music, isn't it.

476
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I like this kind of sound.

477
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
3.

478
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
2.

479
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
1.

480
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
It's been exactly one month since I was born.

481
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
After one more week,
I will die.

482
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
After I die, I want to
be buried on the hill.

483
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I made you for that reason.

484
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
I understand.

485
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Not again...

486
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Where did you break?

487
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
You're still warm.

488
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Thats right!
That man will fix you!

489
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
What's wrong?
What on earth happened?

490
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Please fix it.

491
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Please fix this child.

492
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,000
It's already dead.

493
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
You're in bad shape.
Let's hurry back to safety.

494
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I... loved this child.

495
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
That... is death.

496
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I'm sorry.

497
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I resent you.

498
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Why did you create me?

499
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I...

500
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
...I don't want to have to bury
you after you're dead. It's painful!

501
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
There are birds' nests in the trees here,
so it won't be lonely.

502
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I will die tomorrow afternoon.

503
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
How much time do you have left?

504
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
1729 seconds.

505
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I also know exactly how much
time I have left to breathe.

506
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And... you too...

507
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,000
When I fell off the cliff...

508
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I saw the forest's true shape.

509
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
There haven't been any humans
here for a long, long time, have there?

510
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
For how long have you been alone?

511
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I was made 150 years ago.

512
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
The girl who made me, was created by
someone before those 150 years.

513
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
By someone who also
had been created by someone.

514
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Then human beings were no more again
for a long time.

515
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
But to make you was my dying wish.

516
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Because I thought you'd be very
happy to be born into this world.

517
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Thank you!
