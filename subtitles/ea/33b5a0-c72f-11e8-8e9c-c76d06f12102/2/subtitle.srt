1
00:00:00,105 --> 00:00:03,074
...and what these Leviticus verses
have to do with anything.

2
00:00:06,545 --> 00:00:08,240
- What are you doing?
- Getting started.

3
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:11,974
- You can keep talking if you want.
- Don't you need to look over these?

4
00:00:12,184 --> 00:00:13,845
I got it.

5
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:00,789
Cat!

6
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:32,429
How'd you get in?

7
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:43,736
No one has asked me about
Magda in over 40 years.

8
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,343
Why would a lady like you want
to know about an awful murder?

9
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:51,015
- It interests me.
- Does it?

10
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:56,186
<i>Her husband was the first suspect.</i>

11
00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:59,585
<i>The husband is always</i>
<i>the first suspect and usually the last.</i>

12
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:03,227
But not this time.
We moved on to a neighbor.

13
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:05,191
Then a vagrant.

14
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:07,957
Once you get to strangers,
it's only a matter of time...

15
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,658
...before you get to gypsies and you
know you're never going to solve it.

16
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,134
How exactly was she killed?

17
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:16,098
- Miss?
- Salander.

18
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:20,108
Miss Salander. I hope you don't mind
me asking, but when did you last eat?

19
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:22,780
I have a high metabolism.
I can't put on weight.

20
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:27,543
I'm asking because it is better to look
at what I am about to show you...

21
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:29,083
...on an empty stomach.

22
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,020
<i>If a man's offering is a lamb,</i>
<i>it shall be a female without blemish.</i>

23
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:39,220
<i>He should lay his hand</i>
<i>upon its head...</i>

24
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:42,628
<i>... slaughter it, empty its blood</i>
<i>on the base of the altar...</i>

25
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,802
<i>... and he shall be forgiven.</i>

26
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:51,706
- How is he?
- He needs surgery...

27
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,607
...but there's no DNR in place.
So it's up to the family to decide...

28
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:58,612
...should the occasion arise,
whether to resuscitate or not.

29
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:01,914
And they're not good at decisions.

30
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,644
So how was it with Miss Salander?

31
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:06,824
She said yes. Do you think
I might be able to see him?

32
00:03:07,058 --> 00:03:09,925
He was asleep the last time I looked,
but let me check.

33
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:11,618
- Thank you.
- Don't check.

34
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:14,054
Tell him to pack his things
and leave.

35
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:16,632
- Mother, please.
- Don't use that tone with me.

36
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:19,429
Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist
works for Henrik.

37
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:22,266
- We should put this to a vote.
- Don't be an idiot, Birger.

38
00:03:22,474 --> 00:03:24,772
We all know what Henrik wants.
Can we just do that?

39
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:28,412
Henrik is fighting for his life in there.
This is the last thing he needs.

40
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:31,241
Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger,
there is no smoking in here.

41
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:35,284
Go back to Stockholm.

42
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:39,548
When we need a family chronicle
written by a libelist...

43
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:41,853
...we know who to call.

44
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:50,132
All right. Thanks.

45
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:52,828
This way, miss.

46
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,973
<i>If a woman approaches any beast...</i>

47
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:02,635
<i>... and lies with it, you shall kill</i>
<i>the woman and the beast.</i>

48
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:04,974
<i>Their blood shall be upon them.</i>

49
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,395
<i>My family's impossible.</i>

50
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:22,691
That's why the company's
such a mess.

51
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,230
I apologize for my
mother's behavior.

52
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:27,226
I'm used to it.

53
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,738
It has nothing to do with you.
It's between her and Henrik.

54
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:34,207
She lost it when my father died,
and her drinking and her...

55
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,980
Got so bad Henrik took me
and my sister away from her...

56
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:42,585
...and left her excommunicated
in the old house...

57
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:44,482
...on the other side of the island.

58
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,179
She hasn't forgiven him.

59
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,859
You must stay.

60
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:54,358
You're the last chance Henrik has
at some kind of resolution.

61
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:56,431
Put this to rest one way or another.

62
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:57,930
I'll keep my mother away.

63
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,396
But please, hurry.

64
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:01,997
Of course.

65
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:16,186
Lisbeth.

66
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:18,083
- I'll get that.
- It's okay.

67
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,289
- Martin Vanger.
- How do you do?

68
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:21,686
Fine.

69
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:29,222
- It's a girlfriend, or?
- Assistant.

70
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:31,027
Thank you so much.

71
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:33,898
- Good night.
- Good night.

72
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:39,540
Problems finding the place?

73
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:41,803
Everyone in town knows
who and where you are.

74
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:44,880
That's comforting. Are you hungry?
I can make you a sandwich.

75
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,243
No.

76
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:49,977
I used to have a motorbike,
a Triumph.

77
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:51,450
I know.

78
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:53,817
The five cases from Harriet's list.

79
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:56,550
And five more she missed.
Three I'm sure of.

80
00:05:57,462 --> 00:05:59,794
Rebecka was the first,
just as you thought.

81
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:03,229
The second, M.H., is Mari Holmberg,
a prostitute in Kalmar...

82
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:06,233
...murdered in 1954,
matching Leviticus 20:18.

83
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:09,100
Right. "If a man lies with a woman
having her sickness...

84
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:11,969
...he has made naked her fountain
and she has uncovered...

85
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:13,542
...the fountain of her blood."

86
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:17,272
Raped and stabbed, but cause of death
was suffocation by sanitary napkin.

87
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:20,580
- Okay.
- R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957.

88
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:23,253
A cleaning woman
and part-time palm reader.

89
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:26,982
Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped.
Head crushed with a rock.

90
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:28,659
Leviticus 20:27.

91
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,657
"A woman who is a medium
or sorceress...

92
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:32,989
...shall be put to death by stoning."

93
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:37,134
- I usually like to smoke outside.
- Sara Witt, 1964.

94
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,235
Daughter of a pastor.
Tied to her bed.

95
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:42,031
Raped. Charred in the fire
that burned down her house.

96
00:06:42,273 --> 00:06:43,672
Leviticus 21:9.

97
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,106
"The daughter of a priest who profanes
herself by playing the harlot...

98
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:49,746
...profanes her father
and shall be burned with fire."

99
00:06:49,948 --> 00:06:51,609
Magda Lovisa SjÃ¶berg, 1960.

100
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:54,182
Found in a barn.
Stabbed and raped with farm tools.

101
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:56,444
The cow in the next stall
had its throat slit.

102
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:58,679
Its blood was splashed on her
and hers on it.

103
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,381
Leviticus 20:16.
"If a woman lies with any beast...

104
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:04,926
...you shall kill the woman and the
beast. Their blood is upon them."

105
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,290
Lea Persson, 1962.

106
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:09,399
Found by her sister in their pet shop.
Raped, beaten.

107
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,195
The killer uncaged the animals,
smashed the aquariums.

108
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:14,200
There was a parakeet inside her.

109
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:16,900
Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960.

110
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:21,340
A runaway. Raped, strangled.
A burnt pigeon tied around her neck.

111
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:25,681
Lena Andersson, 1967. A student.
Raped, stabbed, decapitated...

112
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:28,182
- Okay.
- I'm not finished.

113
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:30,217
We're looking for
a serial murderer...

114
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:33,720
...but what could that have to do
with a teenager living on an island?

115
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,720
She was looking for him too.

116
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,160
<i>Rape. Torture. Fire.</i>

117
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:41,264
Animals. Religion.

118
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:43,692
- Am I missing anything?
- The names.

119
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:46,229
They're all Biblical.

120
00:07:46,437 --> 00:07:48,871
The first woman, the whore,
the Virgin Mary.

121
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:52,770
Rebecka, Sara,
all from the Old Testament.

122
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:55,002
Which means they're all Jewish.

123
00:07:56,881 --> 00:08:01,181
One thing the Vangers have more than
their fair share of, it's anti-Semites.

124
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:06,585
There's one right there.

125
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,486
I can sleep on a couch.

126
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,957
Okay.

127
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:15,721
Right.

128
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:20,231
Oh, yeah, there might be
a cat somewhere.

129
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:21,837
- Good night.
- Night.

130
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:24,303
Harriet's name isn't.

131
00:08:25,977 --> 00:08:27,069
Isn't what?

132
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,048
- Jewish.
- No.

133
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,941
- What are you doing?
- Reading your notes.

134
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:02,612
They're encrypted.

135
00:09:02,814 --> 00:09:05,612
Please. Have some coffee.

136
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:06,806
Okay.

137
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:10,385
Then we're gonna have
a very serious conversation...

138
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:12,818
...about what's yours
and what's mine.

139
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:16,352
It's amazing what you figured out
with the parade photos.

140
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:18,188
Thank you.

141
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:22,196
- It's too bad you don't have hers.
- Whose?

142
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:24,967
Her.

143
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:30,268
Can l...? Sorry.

144
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:32,836
Yeah, all right.

145
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:34,443
Close that.

146
00:09:34,646 --> 00:09:35,943
No. Not that.

147
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:38,906
That's the one. Yep.

148
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:43,679
Where the fuck is that? That's down
there, isn't it? Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah.

149
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:45,480
And...

150
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:49,253
What does that say there?

151
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:53,561
- "N" something "R-S-J."
- That's "NorsjÃ¶," yeah.

152
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:56,892
Then something "K."
Something "R-l-F."

153
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:58,693
"Carpentry."

154
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:01,899
Well, we need to find a carpenter.

155
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:05,636
Fuck!

156
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:03,766
The carpentry shop is gone. I don't
even know if he worked there or not...

157
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:07,062
...but if he did, maybe he used
to come in here for hardware.

158
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:09,364
I don't recognize him. Sorry.

159
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:12,202
Well, I had to start somewhere.

160
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:18,246
I'm no detective, but 1966, I would
have started at a retirement home.

161
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:26,723
This is BrÃ¤nnlund's kid.

162
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:29,085
Do you know where I might find him?
The son?

163
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,659
Next to his father at the cemetery.

164
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:36,128
He was killed in an accident
on a construction site, years ago.

165
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:39,527
But...

166
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:43,470
...she might still be alive.
His widow.

167
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,570
Do you know where
I might find her?

168
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:56,519
<i>Please drive to highlighted route.</i>

169
00:11:57,555 --> 00:12:02,015
In 1966, you were in Hedestad
with your husband.

170
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:05,161
Who took these?

171
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:06,557
A local photographer.

172
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:08,595
You were taking pictures
too that day...

173
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,894
...and I'd love to look at them
if by some miracle you have them.

174
00:12:12,103 --> 00:12:14,401
It wouldn't be a miracle.
We were on our honeymoon.

175
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:16,468
But why?

176
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:20,735
This girl here. Here, you can see
her better in the enlargement.

177
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:23,379
See, that's you there.
Just after this was taken...

178
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:26,982
...after she'd seen something
across the street, she was murdered.

179
00:12:28,953 --> 00:12:31,046
How awful.

180
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,492
- There you are.
- Thank you.

181
00:13:02,553 --> 00:13:04,350
Would you mind if I made
a copy of this?

182
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:05,544
No.

183
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:10,516
I can't give you any of this stuff without
authorization from Mr. Armansky.

184
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:12,389
So call him.

185
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:23,401
Next time,
fill out the proper paperwork.

186
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:35,879
Which one are you?

187
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:52,362
Going down.

188
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,905
How's your sex life?

189
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:04,738
I didn't care much
for your last report.

190
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:07,816
It felt perfunctory,
like your heart wasn't in it.

191
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:11,146
Let's see a little more enthusiasm
for my recovery in next month's.

192
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:13,915
Don't speak. I don't want to hear
your voice, just nod.

193
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,116
Start looking for a shrink
you can bribe...

194
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:20,093
...to swear under oath he can find
absolutely nothing wrong with me.

195
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:22,458
And stop visiting
tattoo-removal websites.

196
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:24,266
Or I'll do it again...

197
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:27,360
...right here.

198
00:17:15,673 --> 00:17:18,141
- Is that dental floss?
- Yes.

199
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,670
You're gonna sterilize that, right?

200
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:29,611
Couldn't we just use tape
or something?

201
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,185
No.

202
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,579
What?

203
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,860
Thank you. Jesus!

204
00:17:39,063 --> 00:17:41,691
- Drink.
- Okay.

205
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:45,528
Just be careful. It's my eye.

206
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,330
- Don't move.
- You're not a doctor.

207
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:04,977
- Take off your wet clothes.
- What?

208
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,350
Yeah. Thank you.

209
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:13,396
Yeah, I think it has stopped bleeding.

210
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:16,293
It still fucking hurts, though.

211
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:21,927
Madness.

212
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,008
I mean, madness.
This is fucking madness.

213
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,350
You're okay, you're okay,
you're okay.

214
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:44,855
Jesus, that hurts. Fuck.

215
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:54,530
This is insane.
I mean, these people...

216
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:58,102
Somebody was shooting at me.
I mean, it wasn't an accident.

217
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:00,276
No one's shooting at you now.

218
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:05,739
You know, I'm pretty sure
this is a bad idea.

219
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,008
Why?

220
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:09,209
I'm old and we work together...

221
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,684
You work with what's-her-name
and that's worked out for you.

222
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:15,188
Yeah, well, I do have some standards,
believe it or not.

223
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:17,355
You need to stop talking.

224
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,765
Oh, shit.

225
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:03,640
Do you want me to open the window?

226
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:33,670
- I like working with you.
- I like working with you too.

227
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:43,445
- It could have been a stray shot.
- Not by Gunnar.

228
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,740
If he wanted to shoot him,
he wouldn't be here.

229
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,851
And then we have poachers.
They shoot at anything that moves.

230
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:51,146
Or he's right, Dirch. What if he is?

231
00:20:51,822 --> 00:20:52,982
This has to stop.

232
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,555
Do you want to stop, Mikael?

233
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:56,726
Look, I have police reports, photos...

234
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:59,327
...Henrik's notes, my notes,
Lisbeth's research.

235
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,364
What I don't have is Vanger Industries'
records. That's what I want.

236
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:06,365
- Why?
- Will you authorize it?

237
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,130
What, the private corporate records?
Well, how far back?

238
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,366
Henrik said I could have access
to everything. This is what I need.

239
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:16,068
- That's not what he meant.
- I'll sign a nondisclosure statement.

240
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,577
Just a minute.

241
00:21:20,484 --> 00:21:21,849
I think Henrik would say yes.

242
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:26,819
That's why he has me, to protect
him from himself. It's insane.

243
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:28,383
What have we got to hide?

244
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:32,255
After 120 years of business,
probably a lot.

245
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:35,465
If this is what he needs to finish,
he should have permission.

246
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,561
What am I looking for?

247
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:44,237
Any connections between
Vanger Industries...

248
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:47,137
...and the towns
where the women were killed.

249
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:49,739
And everything about Frode.

250
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:45,530
Your father was taking pictures
that day that no one has seen.

251
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:48,227
- I'd like to take a look at them.
- So ask him.

252
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:51,408
- I was wondering if you could do that.
- I don't speak to him.

253
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:53,405
Could you make an exception
in my case?

254
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:56,004
Are you afraid to be
in the same room with him?

255
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:57,976
I'm not saying you shouldn't be.

256
00:22:58,449 --> 00:22:59,711
So you won't help me?

257
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:03,610
Sorry.

258
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,583
Please?

259
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:13,955
- Are you finished?
- I need to know where all factories...

260
00:23:14,164 --> 00:23:17,258
...offices and projects
were from 1949 to 1966.

261
00:23:17,468 --> 00:23:19,493
- You already have everything.
- No, I don't.

262
00:23:19,736 --> 00:23:22,830
Nothing on subsidiary corporations,
partnerships or suppliers.

263
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,804
- You'll have to do without.
- Mr. Frode said I have access...

264
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:29,137
...to whatever I need. I need this.
- You have access to this floor.

265
00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:30,335
Call him.

266
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:08,976
Thank you for seeing me.

267
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:13,481
Come in.

268
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:16,959
- Tea?
- Please.

269
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:26,699
Sven Olov Lindholm.

270
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:28,193
Me.

271
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:30,133
Handsome.

272
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:32,837
Birger FurugÃ¥rd.

273
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,408
Me.

274
00:24:35,312 --> 00:24:36,802
Per Engdahl.

275
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:41,280
But your interest is in my more
candid photographic work.

276
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:43,646
Friends, relations, that kind of thing.

277
00:24:44,087 --> 00:24:45,611
Please.

278
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:14,012
"Blom" or "Bloom"?

279
00:25:14,218 --> 00:25:15,344
Blomkvist.

280
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:19,015
I'm not a recluse.

281
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:22,318
I don't close my door to anybody.

282
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:23,515
Thank you.

283
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:25,558
They just don't visit.

284
00:25:25,996 --> 00:25:27,190
Well...

285
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,533
...perhaps if you redecorated.

286
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:33,430
Hide the past like they do?

287
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:35,628
Under a thin, shiny veneer?

288
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:37,134
Like an IKEA table?

289
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:40,073
I am the most honest of all of them.

290
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:42,609
- The family?
- Sweden.

291
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:55,721
Landscape?

292
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:58,422
Some nice landscapes there?

293
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:00,156
Who is this?

294
00:26:00,497 --> 00:26:02,226
The blurry one.

295
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:03,763
I can't tell.

296
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:06,493
Oh, that's Gottfried's boy.

297
00:26:07,204 --> 00:26:08,535
- That's Martin.
- Yeah.

298
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:11,401
Handsome but useless young man,
like his father.

299
00:26:11,608 --> 00:26:12,666
Like his father.

300
00:26:25,555 --> 00:26:27,489
- We're closing.
- Nowhere near finished.

301
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,585
- I'm not authorized to stay late.
- I am.

302
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:36,357
And I need access to everything,
including anything that's locked.

303
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:40,200
Call Frode.

304
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:52,205
Leave the keys with the guard.

305
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:22,762
Come on.

306
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:28,098
Shit!

307
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:05,056
Martin?

308
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:24,288
Mikael.

309
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:29,528
Hi there.

310
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:32,232
Your evening stroll?

311
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,672
Yes, that's right, I...

312
00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:39,013
- How are you?
- Good.

313
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:43,552
I stopped by the hospital
on my way home.

314
00:34:43,753 --> 00:34:45,448
Henrik asked me
to ask you something.

315
00:34:46,189 --> 00:34:47,247
What was that?

316
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:51,350
Come on in. I'll make you a drink.

317
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:40,941
Hello, Martin.

318
00:35:42,512 --> 00:35:45,174
Shut the door. It's quite windy.

319
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:52,086
- What happened to you?
- When?

320
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:53,550
Just now.

321
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,088
I fell in the dark.

322
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:58,817
You don't have a flashlight?
I'll get you one.

323
00:35:59,028 --> 00:36:01,656
I just wasn't being careful, that's all.

324
00:36:08,238 --> 00:36:10,570
How's the investigation going?

325
00:36:11,074 --> 00:36:13,235
- Nothing new to report.
- No?

326
00:36:13,943 --> 00:36:18,107
Dirch says the girl is really clever.

327
00:36:22,952 --> 00:36:24,510
Maybe she'll turn something up.

328
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:25,881
Maybe.

329
00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:27,579
Thank you for that.

330
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,764
- So, what did he say?
- What?

331
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:38,024
You said Henrik asked you
to ask me something.

332
00:36:38,234 --> 00:36:40,202
- Well, I just did.
- What?

333
00:36:40,403 --> 00:36:42,871
- How's the investigation?
- Oh, yeah.

334
00:36:43,072 --> 00:36:44,937
That was his question.

335
00:36:51,848 --> 00:36:53,406
Do you hunt?

336
00:36:54,484 --> 00:36:56,213
We should go hunting
together sometime.

337
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:57,818
Sure.

338
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:04,085
Nothing at all new to report?

339
00:37:04,294 --> 00:37:05,386
No. Nothing.

340
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:08,388
- I can see you're anxious.
- No.

341
00:37:08,598 --> 00:37:10,725
No, I mean to get home
after the walk.

342
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,799
Yeah, well, I suppose I am.

343
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:15,334
To have dinner with your girlfriend.

344
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:16,763
Assistant.

345
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:22,339
We'll have better luck with a gun.

346
00:37:22,578 --> 00:37:25,103
- I'm sorry?
- When we go hunting.

347
00:37:26,316 --> 00:37:29,149
A gun. Rather than a knife.

348
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:34,780
I want to show you something.

349
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:37,690
Bring your drink.

350
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:39,418
Leave my knife.

351
00:37:55,745 --> 00:37:57,337
To the right.

352
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:03,208
<i>Hi, leave a message. I'll call...</i>

353
00:38:03,419 --> 00:38:06,183
You know what's harder
than shooting someone?

354
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:07,683
Just missing him.

355
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:10,958
That was a very good shot
up at the cabin.

356
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,628
It didn't work. I'm here.

357
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,129
Mikael, it did work. You're here.

358
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:51,193
Inside.

359
00:39:30,773 --> 00:39:32,707
Spilled your drink.

360
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,279
Why didn't you just go home?

361
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:48,479
May I?

362
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:55,120
How did you do it?

363
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:58,197
What did you find?

364
00:40:01,804 --> 00:40:04,102
We can talk
or we can just get on with it.

365
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:07,172
I found a photograph...

366
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:09,167
...no one has seen.

367
00:40:09,378 --> 00:40:10,470
- Of?
- You.

368
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:13,012
In an Uppsala prep school blazer.

369
00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:15,080
What does that prove?

370
00:40:15,284 --> 00:40:17,218
You lied about
where you were that day.

371
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,320
- Did I?
- Or rather, when.

372
00:40:20,022 --> 00:40:22,354
So what? People lie all the time.

373
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:26,119
It also says that you and Lena
Andersson were schoolmates.

374
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:28,024
Lena...

375
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:31,397
That was a long time ago.

376
00:40:32,602 --> 00:40:35,628
Where's this photo now? Is it with
all the other crap on your desk?

377
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:38,329
There's a copy on my laptop.
There's another copy...

378
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:41,203
...on a secure website.
- Secure website.

379
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:43,338
That's a lie.

380
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:46,548
How much does the girl know?

381
00:40:47,884 --> 00:40:49,511
I hope it's as much as you do.

382
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,550
That'll make it fun.

383
00:40:52,555 --> 00:40:53,544
Where is she?

384
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:55,848
Stockholm. She went this morning.

385
00:40:56,058 --> 00:40:57,525
That's a lie.

386
00:40:57,727 --> 00:41:00,753
She's at our offices
looking at more old crap.

387
00:41:00,963 --> 00:41:03,022
I got a call
from our archives manager.

388
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,258
She was very perturbed
with this girl Lisbeth.

389
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:08,027
I like that name.

390
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:09,965
Lisbeth.

391
00:41:10,606 --> 00:41:14,565
So when Lisbeth leaves,
I will get a call from security...

392
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,007
...so I can be at your cottage
to greet her.

393
00:41:19,682 --> 00:41:22,947
I can't thank you enough
for bringing her to me.

394
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,043
Hey, hey.

395
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:53,779
So, what do you wanna know?

396
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,549
You're a journalist,
ask me questions.

397
00:42:03,759 --> 00:42:05,693
What do I do with the girls?

398
00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:06,953
That's a good question.

399
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:09,728
Well, before, I do what we're doing:

400
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:12,230
Sit down, relax, have a drink.

401
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:13,560
I like that part a lot.

402
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:17,227
Having a chat when both of you know
that one of you is going to die.

403
00:42:18,274 --> 00:42:21,869
And afterwards, I just get rid of them,
far out at sea.

404
00:42:22,111 --> 00:42:24,705
Unlike my father,
who left them scattered...

405
00:42:24,914 --> 00:42:28,372
...all over the place, like trophies.
That's not very smart, if you ask me.

406
00:42:29,118 --> 00:42:30,881
Well, he was a loud
and garish man.

407
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:34,151
Frankly, he got what he deserved.

408
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:37,455
You can't be a sloppy technician
like that.

409
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,890
You can't drink to excess
like he did.

410
00:42:40,096 --> 00:42:41,563
This takes discipline.

411
00:42:42,265 --> 00:42:44,665
It's a science of a thousand details.

412
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:47,695
The planning, the execution.

413
00:42:47,903 --> 00:42:49,564
It's the cleanup.

414
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,002
I guess I don't have to tell you...

415
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:55,336
...but you're going to create
quite a mess here.

416
00:42:58,114 --> 00:43:00,014
Let me ask you something.

417
00:43:00,216 --> 00:43:02,776
Why don't people
trust their instincts?

418
00:43:03,753 --> 00:43:05,220
They sense something is wrong...

419
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:07,855
...someone is walking too close
behind them.

420
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:10,519
You knew something was wrong.

421
00:43:10,826 --> 00:43:12,521
But you came back into the house.

422
00:43:12,728 --> 00:43:15,856
Did I force you?
Did I drag you in? No.

423
00:43:16,732 --> 00:43:20,099
All I had to do was offer you a drink.

424
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,102
It's hard to believe that
the fear of offending...

425
00:43:23,306 --> 00:43:28,243
...can be stronger than the fear
of pain, but you know what? It is.

426
00:43:29,912 --> 00:43:31,709
And they always come willingly.

427
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:33,443
And then they sit there.

428
00:43:33,649 --> 00:43:36,117
They know it's all over,
just like you do.

429
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,152
But somehow,
they still think they have a chance.

430
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:41,289
"Maybe if I say the right thing.

431
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:43,287
Maybe if I'm polite.

432
00:43:43,492 --> 00:43:45,722
If I cry, if I beg."

433
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:48,695
And when I see the hope
draining from their face...

434
00:43:48,898 --> 00:43:51,332
...like it is from yours right now...

435
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:53,191
...I can feel myself...

436
00:43:53,803 --> 00:43:55,065
...getting hard.

437
00:43:56,572 --> 00:44:00,941
But, you know, we're not that different,
you and I. We both have urges.

438
00:44:01,143 --> 00:44:02,735
Satisfying mine...

439
00:44:03,346 --> 00:44:05,405
...requires more towels.

440
00:44:27,403 --> 00:44:29,166
It might amuse you to know...

441
00:44:29,605 --> 00:44:34,167
...that while you were upstairs
having moose with me and Liv...

442
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:38,940
...who, by the way,
finds me very conventional...

443
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:41,680
...I had Irina down here in that cage.

444
00:44:42,485 --> 00:44:44,885
Who is Irina, you might ask?

445
00:44:45,087 --> 00:44:46,884
Just another girl.

446
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,516
Just another immigrant whore.

447
00:44:51,227 --> 00:44:52,990
- Who misses them?
- Your sister wasn't.

448
00:44:53,629 --> 00:44:54,789
What?

449
00:44:54,997 --> 00:44:59,400
Your sister Harriet
wasn't just another girl.

450
00:44:59,635 --> 00:45:01,432
You found her?

451
00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:04,829
What happened to her?

452
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:09,500
You killed her.

453
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:17,011
You useless fucking detective.

454
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:25,890
This too tight to talk?
Good. I'm tired of talking to you.

455
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:05,199
I've never had a man in here before.

456
00:46:11,507 --> 00:46:13,270
In fact, I've never touched a man...

457
00:46:13,476 --> 00:46:15,376
...except my father.

458
00:46:16,912 --> 00:46:18,971
That was our duty.

459
00:46:20,249 --> 00:46:22,274
Harriet's and mine.

460
00:46:36,131 --> 00:46:37,393
Hey.

461
00:46:53,749 --> 00:46:56,274
There's a gun.
There's a gun on the television.

462
00:47:03,392 --> 00:47:05,326
- May I kill him?
- Yeah.

463
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:17,643
How come a 23-year-old...

464
00:50:17,853 --> 00:50:20,515
...is a ward of the state?

465
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:27,786
I'm mentally incompetent
and can't manage daily life.

466
00:50:30,365 --> 00:50:32,993
Since when have they said that?

467
00:50:33,202 --> 00:50:35,864
Since I was 12.

468
00:50:37,372 --> 00:50:39,135
What happened when you were 12?

469
00:50:43,112 --> 00:50:46,878
I'm sorry,
that's none of my business.

470
00:50:49,418 --> 00:50:51,079
I tried to kill my father.

471
00:50:53,288 --> 00:50:55,347
Burned him alive.

472
00:50:55,991 --> 00:51:00,087
Got about 80 percent of him.

473
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:08,634
I made some coffee.

474
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:15,708
- Who's that?
- It's Harriet.

475
00:51:15,911 --> 00:51:19,540
I found it in Martin's basement
among his souvenirs.

476
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:22,842
No, Martin didn't deny
killing anyone.

477
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:27,353
But when I mentioned Harriet,
he was confused.

478
00:51:27,556 --> 00:51:31,856
He got angry at me because I couldn't
tell him what had happened to her.

479
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,755
He didn't kill her.

480
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:38,691
His father didn't do it.
He was dead the year before.

481
00:51:39,735 --> 00:51:43,432
What if she did somehow manage
to get away?

482
00:51:44,473 --> 00:51:45,497
I mean, if...

483
00:51:47,142 --> 00:51:49,474
...she is still alive...

484
00:51:50,813 --> 00:51:54,943
...then there's only one person in this
family who'd know where she is.

485
00:52:23,212 --> 00:52:24,406
Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.

486
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:46,291
Your turn.

487
00:52:46,835 --> 00:52:48,234
Right.

488
00:52:49,137 --> 00:52:50,468
Here.

489
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:10,849
Hi. Look, I'm sorry to bother you.

490
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:12,048
What do you want?

491
00:53:12,261 --> 00:53:13,660
- Has no one called you?
- About?

492
00:53:14,129 --> 00:53:15,619
Your cousin Martin.

493
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:20,463
- What about him?
- He died in a car accident...

494
00:53:20,669 --> 00:53:23,433
...last Thursday. There's going
to be a memorial in Hedestad.

495
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:26,233
I'm not interested in any memorial.

496
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:28,705
- Well, I understand.
- What do you understand?

497
00:53:28,911 --> 00:53:31,539
Well, that you don't care
very much for your family.

498
00:53:31,747 --> 00:53:35,046
- Look, I just thought you should know.
- Now I know.

499
00:53:44,993 --> 00:53:46,392
How'd it go?

500
00:53:46,595 --> 00:53:48,392
Okay, I think.

501
00:53:48,597 --> 00:53:49,894
She's on.

502
00:53:58,307 --> 00:53:59,774
And she's shopping.

503
00:54:09,785 --> 00:54:11,878
She's still playing solitaire?

504
00:54:12,187 --> 00:54:14,246
- And she hasn't called anyone?
- No.

505
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:16,650
We have her cell phone too?

506
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,290
I was so sure
she was gonna lead us to her.

507
00:54:20,495 --> 00:54:22,827
Put your hand back in my shirt.

508
00:54:25,834 --> 00:54:28,234
There's only one reason
she hasn't called Harriet.

509
00:54:28,437 --> 00:54:31,770
She can't. Because Harriet is dead.

510
00:54:33,608 --> 00:54:35,075
I was just thinking that...

511
00:54:35,277 --> 00:54:37,404
- Just one second.
- Okay.

512
00:54:51,259 --> 00:54:53,284
What were you going to say?

513
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:57,287
I was just thinking,
there could be one other possibility.

514
00:55:04,373 --> 00:55:05,704
Well, we could, absolutely.

515
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:09,237
What is it now?

516
00:55:09,444 --> 00:55:12,004
Before he died,
your brother hung me from a hook...

517
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:16,048
...Harriet.

518
00:55:19,254 --> 00:55:20,778
So you sent the flowers.

519
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:22,980
Yes, I did.

520
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:26,854
We found in the Swedish Family
Registry that Anita was married.

521
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:30,088
- But the family never knew, did they?
- No.

522
00:55:30,298 --> 00:55:33,699
So I'm guessing she then came here
on her married-name passport...

523
00:55:33,902 --> 00:55:36,132
...and you followed
on her maiden-name passport.

524
00:55:36,338 --> 00:55:38,670
No, actually,
it was the other way around.

525
00:55:38,874 --> 00:55:43,004
She thought that it was safer
if I traveled with Spencer myself.

526
00:55:43,211 --> 00:55:45,475
Well, what did he think about that?

527
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,649
Nothing. Only that he loved her.

528
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:53,243
She said, "If you love me,
you'll do this and not ask why."

529
00:55:53,455 --> 00:55:55,013
And he never did.

530
00:55:55,223 --> 00:55:56,884
And they both died 20 years ago.

531
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:58,286
Car accident.

532
00:55:58,493 --> 00:56:00,859
You found that out too.

533
00:56:06,068 --> 00:56:07,558
Is that you?

534
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:18,004
I was 14 the first time he raped me.

535
00:56:18,213 --> 00:56:19,271
Martin.

536
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:21,073
No, my father.

537
00:56:21,616 --> 00:56:25,712
Martin only started
after he had died.

538
00:56:25,921 --> 00:56:29,755
- Well, why didn't you tell somebody?
- I did. My mother.

539
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:33,018
- Henrik would've done something.
- I almost told him.

540
00:56:33,228 --> 00:56:35,526
But I was afraid
because of what I'd done.

541
00:56:36,331 --> 00:56:39,823
- I...
- You still don't understand, do you?

542
00:56:40,936 --> 00:56:43,632
A year after the first time...

543
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:48,299
...and there were many times
during that year...

544
00:56:49,144 --> 00:56:52,602
...my father got drunker
than usual one night...

545
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:59,687
...and he started bragging
about the women he'd killed.

546
00:56:59,888 --> 00:57:03,016
He quoted from the Bible
as he tore my clothes off.

547
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:06,420
<i>He tied a belt around my neck.</i>

548
00:57:06,628 --> 00:57:09,028
He wanted to kill me.

549
00:57:10,966 --> 00:57:13,230
I got out of the house.

550
00:57:14,503 --> 00:57:15,595
<i>I went down to the dock.</i>

551
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:18,872
He came staggering after me.

552
00:57:20,509 --> 00:57:22,636
I could never fight him off
in a small space...

553
00:57:23,145 --> 00:57:25,705
<i>... but out in the open...</i>

554
00:57:26,281 --> 00:57:29,216
...I was strong enough
to deal with an old drunk.

555
00:57:32,754 --> 00:57:34,847
When it was over...

556
00:57:36,158 --> 00:57:40,959
<i>... I looked up and Martin was</i>
<i>standing there, staring at me.</i>

557
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:46,624
And all I'd accomplished was
substitute one for another.

558
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:53,800
<i>A couple of months later, Henrik</i>
<i>sent Martin to school in Uppsala.</i>

559
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:59,140
And I thought that maybe, just maybe,
the nightmare was finally over.

560
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:03,950
<i>And then I saw him</i>
<i>the day of the parade...</i>

561
00:58:04,452 --> 00:58:06,044
<i>... across the street.</i>

562
00:58:07,055 --> 00:58:11,515
<i>And I knew</i>
<i>that it would never be over.</i>

563
00:58:12,027 --> 00:58:13,426
So how did you escape?

564
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:16,094
Anita. She...

565
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:19,293
She insisted
that I leave everything behind.

566
00:58:20,135 --> 00:58:24,401
If I took anything the police might have
suspected that I was still alive.

567
00:58:25,207 --> 00:58:30,338
<i>As everyone ate dinner, I was no more</i>
<i>than 20 meters away from them.</i>

568
00:58:31,379 --> 00:58:35,008
<i>I spent the night there.</i>
<i>That's when the search started.</i>

569
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,344
<i>In the morning,</i>
<i>she came to get me.</i>

570
00:58:39,688 --> 00:58:43,215
<i>I'd grown up with that bridge</i>
<i>as my link to home...</i>

571
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:45,458
<i>... but all I could think is...</i>

572
00:58:46,695 --> 00:58:48,856
...if I could just
get away from them...

573
00:58:50,398 --> 00:58:52,628
<i>... just get past the police...</i>

574
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:55,226
<i>... then I might be safe.</i>

575
00:58:58,473 --> 00:58:59,633
<i>And I was.</i>

576
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,672
Until you showed up.

577
00:59:04,246 --> 00:59:05,508
You're safe now.

578
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:09,942
How did you get away?

579
00:59:11,753 --> 00:59:13,812
Someone saved me too.

580
00:59:26,735 --> 00:59:28,168
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

581
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,894
Thank you, Anna.

582
00:59:31,439 --> 00:59:34,499
I made you a promise...

583
00:59:35,877 --> 00:59:39,244
...whether you found
anything or not.

584
00:59:43,018 --> 00:59:45,612
So, what do you have to tell me?

585
00:59:57,399 --> 00:59:59,060
What's this?

586
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:18,376
Hello, Henrik.

587
01:00:37,339 --> 01:00:40,706
I barely remember WennerstrÃ¶m
working here, much less being fired.

588
01:00:40,909 --> 01:00:43,002
How could you?
It was such a long time ago...

589
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:46,669
...which is kind of more to the point than
the money he embezzled from you.

590
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:49,315
You're referring
to the statute of limitations...

591
01:00:49,517 --> 01:00:52,509
...but I had no idea this is what
Henrik was holding out.

592
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:55,349
If I had, I never would've let him
bring you up here.

593
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,080
He wasn't trying to deceive you.

594
01:00:57,292 --> 01:00:59,954
He knows you can't try somebody
35 years after the event.

595
01:01:00,161 --> 01:01:03,653
- I like Henrik, but he knows that.
- A man's reputation means something.

596
01:01:03,865 --> 01:01:06,732
He believes that. He thought
you could destroy WennerstrÃ¶m...

597
01:01:06,935 --> 01:01:09,995
...in the court of public opinion.
- The court of public opinion...

598
01:01:10,205 --> 01:01:13,174
...celebrates people's bad behavior.
- He's an elderly man.

599
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:15,866
He promised me
WennerstrÃ¶m's carcass on a plate.

600
01:01:16,077 --> 01:01:17,942
This isn't even the plate.

601
01:01:18,146 --> 01:01:21,343
- I can't do anything with this.
- Yes, of course.

602
01:01:24,786 --> 01:01:27,118
What happened with WennerstrÃ¶m?

603
01:01:27,455 --> 01:01:28,615
How did he get you?

604
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:34,124
I was stupid. I heard something.
I got it from an anonymous source...

605
01:01:34,329 --> 01:01:37,389
...who I'm now sure
was one of WennerstrÃ¶m's lackeys.

606
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,095
It was fake.

607
01:01:40,502 --> 01:01:42,800
Which he easily proved in court.

608
01:01:43,004 --> 01:01:45,632
You were emphatic
that the way I looked into your life...

609
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,139
...was illegal and immoral. Would you
feel the same about WennerstrÃ¶m?

610
01:01:49,344 --> 01:01:52,108
- Go on.
- I did some work on my own on him...

611
01:01:52,313 --> 01:01:54,804
...before you hired me.
I haven't looked at it all...

612
01:01:55,016 --> 01:01:57,177
...because you
and Harriet-fucking-Vanger...

613
01:01:57,385 --> 01:01:58,443
...have kept me busy.

614
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:01,879
But I may have something.

615
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:03,985
You may have something?

616
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,452
Maybe.

617
01:02:06,661 --> 01:02:08,822
They launder money
from arms and drug sales...

618
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:10,793
...and crime syndicates in Russia.

619
01:02:11,132 --> 01:02:14,124
And that money accounts for all
but 5 percent of his holdings.

620
01:02:14,335 --> 01:02:16,701
The rest ends up in accounts
in the Cayman Islands.

621
01:02:16,938 --> 01:02:19,839
- And how do you know this?
- This time you don't want to know.

622
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:22,100
This time I do want to know.

623
01:02:22,811 --> 01:02:24,210
I have access to his computer...

624
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:28,009
...and his accountant's and lawyer's.
- And how do you have that?

625
01:02:28,216 --> 01:02:29,979
I could've gotten it from a source
inside the company.

626
01:02:30,185 --> 01:02:32,016
- You didn't.
- But that's what you'll say.

627
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,949
And what will you say to me?

628
01:02:34,155 --> 01:02:36,214
Well, that depends
if you really want to know.

629
01:02:36,424 --> 01:02:39,325
I do.
Mikael, how did you get access?

630
01:02:51,372 --> 01:02:53,499
<i>Financial journalist</i>
<i>Mikael Blomkvist...</i>

631
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:56,176
<i>... who, this time last year</i>
<i>was convicted of libel...</i>

632
01:02:56,377 --> 01:02:57,810
<i>... in a Stockholm courtroom...</i>

633
01:02:58,012 --> 01:03:00,310
<i>... doesn't seem to have learned</i>
<i>from his mistakes.</i>

634
01:03:00,515 --> 01:03:02,073
<i>Or maybe he has.</i>

635
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:05,377
<i>In the current issue of</i> Millennium
<i>magazine, he now charges...</i>

636
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:08,215
<i>... the company that sued him,</i>
<i>the WennerstrÃ¶m Group...</i>

637
01:03:08,423 --> 01:03:09,515
The shit hits the fan.

638
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:12,522
<i>... of criminal activities</i>
<i>on a global scale.</i>

639
01:03:12,727 --> 01:03:13,989
What happens now?

640
01:03:14,195 --> 01:03:17,323
Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta,
which won't wash.

641
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:20,023
The police will investigate,
FI will investigate.

642
01:03:20,235 --> 01:03:22,669
It'll go to court.
Maybe he'll go to prison.

643
01:03:23,505 --> 01:03:25,200
You think?

644
01:03:25,406 --> 01:03:26,395
Probably not.

645
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:28,904
These guys never do.

646
01:03:41,256 --> 01:03:42,245
What's wrong with you?

647
01:03:42,457 --> 01:03:44,823
- It's embarrassing.
- Tell me.

648
01:03:45,026 --> 01:03:46,516
I need to borrow some money.

649
01:03:48,129 --> 01:03:49,790
Fifty thousand.

650
01:03:51,132 --> 01:03:54,465
I have a chance to make an investment.
It's a smart, safe investment.

651
01:03:54,669 --> 01:03:57,900
- I really don't think I've got 50,000.
- Yes, you do.

652
01:03:58,106 --> 01:04:01,507
You have 65,000
in your two accounts.

653
01:04:01,709 --> 01:04:03,836
I'm sorry that I know that.

654
01:04:05,446 --> 01:04:07,141
You'll get the money back,
I promise.

655
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,142
Okay.

656
01:04:10,552 --> 01:04:11,746
Okay.

657
01:04:13,154 --> 01:04:14,849
You want a coffee?

658
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:22,919
<i>These allegations, like the last one</i>
<i>from this so-called journalist...</i>

659
01:04:23,131 --> 01:04:24,962
<i>... are as ridiculous</i>
<i>as they are untrue.</i>

660
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:28,602
<i>I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court</i>
<i>again, and I'm looking forward to it.</i>

661
01:04:28,803 --> 01:04:30,168
<i>What about his documentation?</i>

662
01:04:30,371 --> 01:04:32,305
<i>Fabricated. All of it.</i>

663
01:04:32,507 --> 01:04:36,466
<i>The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite</i>
<i>as certain as Mr. WennerstrÃ¶m of that.</i>

664
01:04:36,678 --> 01:04:39,613
<i>If a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist</i>
<i>alleges proves to be true...</i>

665
01:04:39,814 --> 01:04:42,442
<i>... not only will there be</i>
<i>a securities investigation...</i>

666
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,777
<i>... but an organized-crime inquiry</i>
<i>as well.</i>

667
01:04:44,986 --> 01:04:46,544
<i>Mr. Blomkvist names no sources.</i>

668
01:04:46,754 --> 01:04:49,348
<i>And we can't force him to.</i>
<i>But we can look for them.</i>

669
01:04:49,591 --> 01:04:52,287
<i>- Beginning where?</i>
<i>- Those closest to Mr. WennerstrÃ¶m.</i>

670
01:04:52,493 --> 01:04:55,621
<i>Only someone in the inner circle</i>
<i>of a corporation like this...</i>

671
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:57,695
<i>... has access to this kind</i>
<i>of information.</i>

672
01:04:57,899 --> 01:05:00,197
<i>Mr. WennerstrÃ¶m isn't available</i>
<i>for comment...</i>

673
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:02,164
<i>... but I'll be happy</i>
<i>to answer questions.</i>

674
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,497
<i>- Where is he?</i>
<i>- At home, I imagine.</i>

675
01:05:04,706 --> 01:05:06,867
<i>No, he's not.</i>
<i>Has he left the country?</i>

676
01:05:07,108 --> 01:05:08,575
<i>I don't think so.</i>

677
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,385
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

678
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:33,623
Welcome to the Dolder Grand, miss.
May I have your passport, please?

679
01:06:01,262 --> 01:06:02,593
<i>With his failure to appear...</i>

680
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:05,027
<i>... before a Security Exchange</i>
<i>Commission panel...</i>

681
01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:08,532
<i>... a warrant has been issued</i>
<i>for the WennerstrÃ¶m Group CEO.</i>

682
01:06:08,736 --> 01:06:10,704
<i>I can confirm that he left Sweden...</i>

683
01:06:10,905 --> 01:06:13,533
<i>... on a private jet</i>
<i>that landed in Paris last week.</i>

684
01:06:14,776 --> 01:06:16,641
<i>Whether he's still there,</i>

<i>He can be anywhere by now.</i>

686
01:06:31,092 --> 01:06:32,457
Thank you.

687
01:06:34,295 --> 01:06:37,196
I have accounts at Bank
of Kroenenfeld, Cayman Islands.

688
01:06:37,398 --> 01:06:39,559
I'd like to transfer them
and convert to bonds.

689
01:06:39,934 --> 01:06:42,926
- Naturally, you have the clearing codes.
- Naturally.

690
01:06:44,138 --> 01:06:45,833
How many accounts
will you transfer?

691
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,064
Thirty.

692
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:52,275
- This will take some time.
- You will receive 4 percent commission.

693
01:06:53,147 --> 01:06:55,445
- I will.
- Then it won't be a waste of it.

How many of these would you like

699
01:07:29,951 --> 01:07:31,350
All 50, into five accounts.

700
01:07:46,267 --> 01:07:47,859
Yes. That looks correct.

Thank you.

715
01:09:44,418 --> 01:09:45,476
No, I quit.

716
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:48,786
It was a good investment?

717
01:09:49,824 --> 01:09:51,086
It was okay.

718
01:09:52,126 --> 01:09:53,252
What are you doing later?

719
01:09:54,328 --> 01:09:55,852
I'm seeing my daughter.

720
01:09:56,197 --> 01:09:57,630
Okay.

721
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:00,428
You look nice.

722

726

I miss our meetings.

727
01:10:35,736 --> 01:10:38,000
I'm sure you don't. Why would you?

728
01:10:38,205 --> 01:10:40,673
I was always such
a headache for you.

729
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:44,307
Never showing up with good news,
only problems.

730
01:10:45,646 --> 01:10:46,908
I have good news now.

731
01:10:47,181 --> 01:10:48,842
I made a friend.

732
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,977
I mean, one that you'd approve of.

733
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,389
I'm happy.
