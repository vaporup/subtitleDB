1
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,164
- What kind is it?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

2
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,492
White.

3
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,328
<i>And the frame?</i>

4
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,232
- Dark.
- Postmark?

5
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,498
<i>Same as last time.</i>

6
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,669
And no note.

7
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,242
<i>No.</i>

8
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,578
<i>I'm so sorry, Henrik.</i>

9
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,965
Will you appeal?

10
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,435
What is this?
The media event of the year?

11
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,938
Don't try to play it down, Mikael.
It won't work.

12
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,373
Don't try to play it up.
That won't work either.

13
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,911
Mikael, can we get a quote?

14
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,846
Mikael, will you appeal?

15
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,311
Yes. I'll appeal to you, Viggo.

16
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,384
<i>Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist</i>
<i>was able to play the victim...</i>

17
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,991
<i>... the brave journalist going up</i>
<i>against the bad guy.</i>

18
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,593
<i>I don't know why malicious intent</i>
<i>couldn't be proven.</i>

19
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,890
<i>- When you call a guy a criminal...</i>
<i>- lf you want to say these things...</i>

20
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,828
<i>Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity.</i>

21
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,901
<i>There's really no greater disgrace</i>
<i>for a journalist than libel.</i>

22
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,232
<i>- Was found guilty today on 16 counts</i>
<i>of aggravated libel.</i>

23
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:05,002
Can I get that sandwich there?
And a black coffee.

24
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,078
<i>In an article published earlier</i>
<i>this year, Blomkvist claimed...</i>

25
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,444
<i>... Wennerström, founder and president</i>
<i>of the Wennerström Group...</i>

26
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,280
<i>... used state funds intended</i>
<i>for industrial development in Poland...</i>

27
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,388
<i>... in an arms deal with the right-wing</i>
<i>Ustaše in Croatia.</i>

28
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,526
<i>I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist.</i>
<i>He's a fine journalist...</i>

29
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,992
<i>... who I don't believe</i>
<i>is guided by malice.</i>

30
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,188
<i>But what he wrote was inaccurate.</i>

31
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,993
<i>And inaccuracies</i>
<i>can't go unanswered.</i>

32
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,433
<i>All journalists have to accept,</i>
<i>like the rest of us...</i>

33
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,631
<i>... actions have consequences.</i>

34
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,533
<i>Blomkvist was ordered to pay...</i>

35
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,338
<i>... 600,000 Swedish kronor</i>
<i>in damages and all court costs.</i>

36
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,879
Can I get a packet of Marlboro Red
and a lighter?

37
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,039
Yeah.

38
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,649
- Where have you been?
- Walking. Thinking.

39
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,350
- Smoking?
- Yeah. Just one.

40
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,527
TV4 called.
I told them no statement...

41
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,968
...until we've read
the judgment in its entirety.

42
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,369
Well, I have. Anyone else?

43
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,440
Everyone who wants
to see you humiliated.

44
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,079
- Been on the phone all morning?
- I'm as much to blame.

45
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,476
- You are? You wrote it?
- I read it. I ran it.

46
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,810
- Not the same.
- Our credibility isn't dead yet.

47
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,611
Mine is.

48
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,081
I'm tired.

49
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,920
I'm gonna go home,
crawl under the duvet for a week.

50
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,794
I'll call Greger,
tell him I'm not coming home.

51
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,196
Thank you.

52
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,032
It's possible we could wait forever.

53
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,974
- You called her and spoke to her?
- I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.

54
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,849
<i>No one here particularly likes her.</i>

55
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,352
I find it's much better
if she works from home.

56
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,223
But you told her
I wanted to meet with her.

57
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,054
I've told her many times
I prefer her not to meet clients.

58
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,389
<i>- You like her?</i>
<i>- Very much.</i>

59
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,830
<i>She's one of the best investigators</i>
<i>I have, as you saw from her report.</i>

60
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,732
- But?
- I'm concerned you won't like her.

61
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,940
- She's different.
- In what way?

62
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,066
In every way.

63
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,117
<i>Miss Salander is here.</i>

64
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,524
Lisbeth.

65
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,922
Mr. Dirch Frode.

66
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,926
How do you do?

67
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,800
Something wrong with the report?

68
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,569
No, it was quite thorough.

69
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,646
But I'm also interested
in what's not in it.

70
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,818
- There's nothing not in it.
- Your opinion of him isn't.

71
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,811
- I'm not paid to give my opinion.
- So you don't have one?

72
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,950
He's clean, in my opinion.

73
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,686
You mean he's hygienic?

74
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,827
He's who he presents himself to be.
In his business, that's an asset.

75
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,129
Well, there's less in his asset column
after his conviction today.

76
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,135
True. He made a fool of himself.

77
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,807
If it happened that way.

78
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,976
Are you suggesting
that he was set up?

79
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,741
That was never part
of my assignment.

80
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,608
But you're right.

81
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,306
He did make a fool of himself
professionally.

82
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,817
How much of a fool did he make
of himself financially?

83
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,717
The judgment will just about
empty his savings.

84
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,016
- May I go?
- Moment.

85
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,361
Your report is light in another area.

86
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,257
His personal life.

87
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,261
Anything you chose not to disclose?

88
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,024
Nothing that warranted inclusion.

89
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,930
Does that mean yes or no?

90
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:29,198
I think what Miss Salander means, and
I agree, is that everyone has a right...

91
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,673
...to a certain amount of privacy,
even if they're being investigated.

92
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,370
Not in this case.
I need to know anything about him...

93
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:39,142
...I might find unsavory,
even if she doesn't.

94
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,982
He's had a longstanding
sexual relationship...

95
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,218
...with his co-editor of the magazine.
It wrecked his marriage but not hers.

96
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,658
Sometimes he performs cunnilingus.

97
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,162
Not often enough, in my opinion.

98
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,968
No, you're right not to include that.

99
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,500
I know.

100
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,529
You needed a better attorney.
You needed your sister.

101
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,992
- She offered.
- He declined.

102
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,688
- As she hoped.
- Never a good idea.

103
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,300
- Mixing family and business.
- I would've lost anyway.

104
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,960
It wasn't about Mikael. It was about
Wennerström sending a message...

105
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,336
...to the press and the FSA,
saying, "Don't ask questions."

106
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,599
Cheer up.

107
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:16,837
Dad.

108
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,540
Nilla, you don't have
to worry about me.

109
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,481
- Mom's worried.
- About me?

110
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,649
About the money.

111
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,716
Good evening.

112
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,225
Nilla? What are you doing?

113
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,520
Nothing.

114
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,856
Are you serious?

115
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,626
I don't wanna talk about it
since I know you won't approve.

116
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:43,859
Of?

117
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,698
- Nilla.
- Light of Life.

118
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,236
Light of what?

119
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,677
- Hello?
<i>- Herr Blomkvist.</i>

120
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,942
- Yeah.
<i>- Forgive me for intruding on Christmas.</i>

121
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,483
<i>My name is Dirch Frode.</i>

122
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:05,589
I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik
Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of him?

123
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,883
Yeah, of course I have.

124
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,493
<i>He'd love to talk to you</i>
<i>about a private matter.</i>

125
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,687
This is an awkward moment.

126
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,958
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. I'm about to sit down</i>
<i>to a Christmas dinner myself.</i>

127
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,193
No, that's not exactly what I meant.

128
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,736
You're referring
to your recent legal problems.

129
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,771
That has provided us
with much amusement.

130
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:23,964
I'm sorry?

131
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,701
<i>Herr Vanger has little love</i>
<i>for Herr Wennerström either.</i>

132
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,437
- Have him call me.
- But he would love to speak to you...

133
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,208
...in person, if possible. Up north.

134
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,386
<i>- In Hedestad.</i>
- That's not gonna be possible.

135
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,385
<i>Herr Blomkvist, he's far too old</i>
<i>to go to Stockholm. Please.</i>

136
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,751
Be so kind as to consider.

137
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,723
<i>Hedestad is lovely in the winter.</i>

138
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,921
I'll call you back on this number.
Okay?

139
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,940
Usually when I wake up in a cold bed
it's at home.

140
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,878
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

141
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,053
- I'm writing a press release.
- Saying?

142
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,723
You're taking over as publisher,
you're very sorry...

143
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,156
...for any nuisance
Mr. Wennerström was caused...

144
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,331
...and I can't be reached for comment.
- Are you giving up?

145
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,794
Stepping aside.

146
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,895
This makes me sick.

147
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,503
- First time in Hedestad?
- And the last.

148
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,073
Oh, don't say that.
It's lovely in the spring.

149
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,972
You said it would be lovely
in the winter.

150
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,113
Well, this is unseasonable.

151
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,806
Well, I'll be on the 4:30 train
back to Stockholm.

152
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,211
Unless we get snowed in.

153
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,278
I'm joking.

154
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,320
You'll be home tonight,
if that's what you wish.

155
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,254
Welcome.

156
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,520
Come inside.

157
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,091
It's warm.

158
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,733
How do you do?

159
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,677
So...

160
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,378
...what do you know about me?

161
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,041
You used to run one of the largest
industrial firms in the country.

162
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,651
- "Used to." That's correct.
- Oh, I didn't mean that.

163
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,583
- Should I stay?
- No.

164
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,352
My grandfather forged the tracks...

165
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,686
...that the 4:30 train
will take you home on.

166
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,264
We stitched this country together.

167
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:37,163
We made the steel, milled the lumber
that built modern Sweden.

168
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,566
And what do you think
our most profitable product now is?

169
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,967
Fertilizer.

170
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,903
I'm not obsessed by
the declining health of the company.

171
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,704
But I am with
the settling of accounts.

172
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,211
And the clock is ticking.
I need your help.

173
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,781
I'm... Doing what?

174
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,418
Officially, assisting
with my memoirs.

175
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:59,147
But what you'll really be doing...

176
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:03,385
...is solving a mystery
by doing what you do so well.

177
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,961
Your recent legal mishap
notwithstanding.

178
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:10,499
You will be investigating thieves,
misers, bullies...

179
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:16,174
...the most detestable collection
of people that you will ever meet.

180
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,907
My family.

181
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,281
Would you like to sit? I could possibly
clear a place if necessary.

182
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,614
- Did you make it?
- Have you something for me?

183
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:38,527
I am on welfare, I do not administer it.
This is not enough.

184
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,205
No, thank you.

185
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,608
<i>This is Harriet.</i>

186
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,014
The granddaughter
of my brother Richard.

187
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,588
Richard was a Nazi
of the first order...

188
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:09,189
...joining the Nationalist Socialist
Freedom League when he was 17.

189
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:13,957
Isn't it interesting how fascists
always steal the word "freedom"?

190
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,838
Oh, the 4:30. Yes, I know. Okay.

191
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,840
Anyway, Richard died a martyr
to the Nazi cause in 1940.

192
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,638
Missed all the real excitement.

193
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,143
But not the opportunity to regularly
beat his wife, Margareta...

194
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,046
...and their son, Gottfried.

195
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,948
Now, Gottfried, Harriet's father...

196
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,817
...was what they used to call
a good-time Charlie.

197
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,618
- They still call them that.
- Do they? Okay.

198
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,159
He was a charmer,
a ladies' man and a drunk.

199
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,298
In other words, a born salesman.
Which he did for the company...

200
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,161
...traveling around
and taking clients out to dinner.

201
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,667
- Well, somebody's gotta do it.
- That's right.

202
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,840
Anyway, he died in 1965.

203
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,009
Drowned, drunk, here on the island.

204
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,579
His wife, Isabella, who had been pretty
much useless as a parent before...

205
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,147
...became even more so
after his death...

206
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,944
...which is when I began
looking after the children.

207
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,156
Martin, who runs Vanger Industries,
now that I'm retired.

208
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,914
That's right, I Googled him.

209
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,251
And Harriet.

210
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,420
She was bright, curious...

211
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,899
...a winning combination
in any person.

212
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,494
- And beautiful.
- Yeah.

213
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,698
Something happened to her?

214
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,069
Someone in the family
murdered Harriet...

215
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,745
...and for the past 40 years...

216
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,007
...has been trying
to drive me insane.

217
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,444
<i>It was September 24th, 1966.</i>

218
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,417
A Saturday.

219
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,284
Harriet was 16.

220
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,582
My brothers...

221
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,421
<i>... and their wives and their children</i>
<i>and grandchildren...</i>

222
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,891
<i>... were all gathered here...</i>

223
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:55,089
<i>... for our loathsome annual</i>
<i>board meeting and dinner.</i>

224
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,293
<i>It was also the day the yacht club</i>
<i>held their autumn parade.</i>

225
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,633
<i>Harriet, with one or two school</i>
<i>friends, went into town to see it.</i>

226
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,901
She returned a little after 2:00.

227
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,945
<i>She came into the parlor.</i>
<i>She asked if she could talk to me.</i>

228
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,379
I honestly don't remember
what I was doing...

229
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,415
...that I thought
was more important...

230
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,020
<i>... but I told her</i>
<i>to give me a few minutes.</i>

231
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:23,591
It was during those few minutes
that something else occurred.

232
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,799
<i>The accident had nothing to do</i>
<i>with Harriet...</i>

233
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,094
...and yet everything.

234
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,300
<i>It was chaos as everybody</i>
<i>put down what they were doing.</i>

235
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,805
<i>Police, ambulance, fire brigade...</i>

236
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,878
<i>... reporters, photographers, onlookers</i>
<i>all quickly arrived from town...</i>

237
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,540
<i>... just as we on the island, the family,</i>
<i>hurried to the bridge from our side.</i>

238
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,150
<i>The driver of the car...</i>

239
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,911
...a man named Aronsson...

240
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,386
<i>... was pinned and severely injured.</i>

241
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,492
<i>We tried desperately</i>
<i>to pry him loose with our hands...</i>

242
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,026
<i>... since metal tools might spark.</i>

243
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:03,161
<i>It was an hour after the crash</i>
<i>that Harriet was in the kitchen.</i>

244
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,461
Anna herself saw her.

245
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:14,477
<i>Well, we finally got poor Aronsson</i>
<i>out of his car and off to the hospital.</i>

246
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,175
<i>Just as we from our side...</i>

247
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,352
<i>... slowly drifted back to the house.</i>

248
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,550
<i>The sun was down,</i>
<i>the excitement over.</i>

249
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,051
<i>We sat down to dinner.</i>

250
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,852
<i>It was then that I noticed...</i>

251
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,828
<i>... Harriet wasn't there.</i>

252
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,999
<i>And she wasn't there</i>
<i>the next morning.</i>

253
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:36,923
<i>Or the next.</i>

254
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,067
Or the next 40 years.

255
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,536
<i>What was she going to tell me?</i>

256
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,940
Why didn't I make time for her?
Why didn't I listen?

257
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:51,513
- And she couldn't have just run away?
- No. Not without being seen.

258
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,344
The firemen stayed out all night...

259
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,452
<i>... on the bridge</i>
<i>pumping up gasoline.</i>

260
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,452
<i>No one swam across</i>
<i>or took a boat.</i>

261
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,353
All the boats were still tied up
on this side Sunday.

262
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,120
Believe me, I checked.

263
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,096
She couldn't have just fallen
and drowned?

264
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,033
No. The currents aren't strong here.
Anything that falls in the water turns up.

265
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,466
Like her father.

266
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,039
His body didn't drift
more than 10 meters...

267
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,608
...when he drowned the year before.

268
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,905
Oh, no. Someone killed her.

269
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,709
Someone on the island that day.

270
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,885
Someone close enough to know...

271
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:32,455
...what she used to give me
each year on my birthday.

272
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,552
Those are from her.

273
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,531
And the rest, from her killer.

274
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:54,673
Who knows about these?

275
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:58,349
There's me, the police, the killer...

276
00:21:58,784 --> 00:21:59,773
...and now you.

277
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,261
<i>After the police investigation</i>
<i>evaporated...</i>

278
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,227
<i>... I kept at it, studying</i>
<i>all the information there was.</i>

279
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,601
I have spent half my life
examining the events of a single day.

280
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,931
I understand your frustration...

281
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,937
...but what you're asking me to do,
it's a waste of money.

282
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,236
- But we haven't discussed your fee.
- We don't need to.

283
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,845
Thank you.

284
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,642
I can't find something
you've been unable to find in 40 years.

285
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,651
You don't know that. You have
a very keen investigative mind.

286
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,721
Here's what I propose:

287
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,652
You come stay on the island.

288
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,022
I have a nice little cottage
by the water you can use.

289
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,129
You study the material I send you.

290
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,526
You find something I've missed
or you don't.

291
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,794
What you're asking me to do
is set aside my life and career for...

292
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,994
Think of this
as a well-deserved holiday.

293
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,700
A way of avoiding all those people
that you might want to avoid right now.

294
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,401
As for compensation,
I'll pay you double your salary...

295
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,308
...for as many months as it takes.

296
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,245
- Quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
- Herr Vanger...

297
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,578
I'm not done.
I will throw in one more thing...

298
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,948
...even though
you're a terrible negotiator.

299
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,681
It's something you want
more than anything else...

300
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,328
...and it can't be bought at any price.
So let me give it to you.

301
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,896
Hans-Erik Wennerström.

302
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,097
He began his career
working for me...

303
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:27,965
...and I have followed it with interest,
shall we say, ever since.

304
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,374
You were right about him.

305
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,371
You just couldn't prove it.

306
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,378
We're in the middle of the worst crisis
ever, and you're writing a memoir.

307
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,210
- You fired me. I need something to do.
- You fired you.

308
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,412
I need you here, not the North Pole.

309
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,988
Mikael, you know
what this is going to look like.

310
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,251
Like I've been gutted.
I'm running away. I am.

311
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,294
Wennerström wants to see me
wave a white flag, not a red flag.

312
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,625
If it looks like there's a problem
between us, it'll satisfy him.

313
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,199
There is a problem between us.

314
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,927
He won't be satisfied
until he shuts us down.

315
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:37,564
- You're leaving me to fight him alone.
- It's four hours by train.

316
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,942
It's not the North Pole.

317
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,149
Hey, hey.

318
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,849
<i>Network busy.</i>
<i>Please try again later.</i>

319
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:42,798
<i>Network busy.</i>
<i>Please try again later.</i>

320
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,464
What?

321
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,170
Some milk?

322
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,562
<i>Network busy.</i>
<i>Please try again later.</i>

323
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,094
Oh, yeah. These as well.

324
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:00,039
- You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
- His ward. He doesn't have a daughter.

325
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,447
Please.

326
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,511
<i>He's had severe</i>
<i>cerebral hemorrhaging...</i>

327
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:11,246
<i>... either from the fall itself</i>
<i>or from a stroke that led to the fall.</i>

328
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,320
<i>His blood pressure is still high.</i>

329
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,494
<i>I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness,</i>
<i>but that's not assured.</i>

330
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,959
<i>And it's possible, even if he does...</i>

331
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,928
<i>... that there will be</i>
<i>neurological damage.</i>

332
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,184
Oh, jeez.

333
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,291
Hi. I'm Gunnar.

334
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,420
The caretaker.

335
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,930
- Oh, hey, Gunnar. Come in.
- Okay.

336
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,167
- You want to put it in there?
- Okay.

337
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,944
You're an author.

338
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:18,213
Well, I'm doing a biography
of Herr Vanger.

339
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,288
- I saw you on television.
- That's unfortunate.

340
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,258
Bit of trouble, I guess.

341
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,756
- No jail time though. That's good.
- No.

342
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,935
Cost you a lot of money
though, yeah?

343
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,269
There.

344
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:42,970
The entire island
is owned by my family.

345
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:49,713
Your closest neighbor
is my brother Harald...

346
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,920
...another Nazi, if you can believe.

347
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,614
Two in the family.

348
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:58,956
Oh, yes, he's quite detestable,
to put it nicely.

349
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,565
But you'll probably never see him.
He's a recluse.

350
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,497
- He was there that day?
- Indeed, he was.

351
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:09,139
His daughter, Cecilia,
lives over there.

352
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,004
They don't speak.

353
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,769
Does anybody speak
to anybody on this island?

354
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,606
Actually, Isabella, Harriet's mother,
who lives there...

355
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,649
...she speaks to Harald, which is one
of the reasons I don't speak to her.

356
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:21,910
Right.

357
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,283
Cecilia's brother, Birger,
lives over there.

358
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,086
Who doesn't he speak to?

359
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,384
You, probably.

360
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:32,051
But you wouldn't want him to. He can
be just as unpleasant as Harald.

361
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,992
Quickly losing track
of who's who here.

362
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,163
How you'll wish it were always so.

363
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:41,304
Soon you will know us all
only too well, with my apologies.

364
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:46,636
Now, out there, my grandnephew
Martin's house, Harriet's brother.

365
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,507
- Who speaks to him?
- I speak to him.

366
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,706
He runs the company now,
as I think I told you.

367
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,621
Someone's shooting his dinner.
Gunnar, probably.

368
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,119
Oh, yes, I met him earlier.

369
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,851
He was 19 when
Harriet disappeared.

370
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,189
Well, he lives over there.

371
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,856
- And you live there.
- Sorry?

372
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,591
Your house.

373
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,997
Oh, yes.

374
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,268
Yes, you're right.

375
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,102
The man who hires the detective...

376
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,541
...should always be kept
on the suspects list.

377
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,793
Her mother.

378
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,962
But what about the search? Please.

379
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,034
Please. I beg you.

380
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,792
<i>The fact that I never found a body</i>
<i>was not surprising.</i>

381
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,906
<i>You can't dig up an entire island.</i>

382
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,336
But neither could I find the motive.

383
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,172
Was it spontaneous?
Was it calculated?

384
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,713
Did she know something
someone wished she didn't?

385
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:42,443
- Was it about business?
- Business? Well, she was 16.

386
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,348
And very bright.

387
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,251
Henrik told me and many others
he could easily see her...

388
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,085
...running the company one day.

389
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,322
She was with some friends
that day at a parade.

390
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,193
She told them she was feeling unwell.
She left early.

391
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,859
But they also told me
she kept secrets from them too.

392
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,639
The main thing I learned was that
teenage girls are complicated.

393
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,105
- I have one.
- Then you know.

394
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,345
I wanted to...

395
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,409
...ask you about this.

396
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,710
She received that from Henrik
the Christmas before.

397
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,158
I've studied it more times
than I can say.

398
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,892
I know every page of it.

399
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,394
- It's the last page I was curious about.
- As was I.

400
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:31,500
It's a list of names, numbers
and it must have some significance.

401
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,135
All local phone numbers.

402
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,567
The first belonged
to a woman, Margot...

403
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,674
...whose mother was Magda,
who denied knowing Harriet.

404
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,868
The fourth, R.L.,
belonged to Rosmarie Larsson...

405
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,914
...an elderly woman who died
some years before.

406
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:50,486
The other three were not connected
in any way that I could find.

407
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,319
I reminded you of things
you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry.

408
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,527
I can't forget.

409
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,658
It's my Rebecka case.

410
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:01,897
I don't know what that is.

411
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,264
Every policeman has at least one
unsolved case to obsess over.

412
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,472
Back then we had an
Officer Torstensson.

413
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,541
Year after year, he kept
going back to this Rebecka case.

414
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,941
Taking out the files,
studying them over and over.

415
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,173
We were young.
We laughed at him.

416
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,283
And that was also
a missing-girl case?

417
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,216
No, no, no,
that's not why I mention it.

418
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:27,289
I'm talking about
the soul of a policeman.

419
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,726
<i>Poor old Torstensson</i>
<i>never solved it.</i>

420
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,260
<i>And he never let it go.</i>

421
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,338
So how's Mr. Palmgren doing?

422
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,671
I heard he had a stroke
of some kind?

423
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:46,901
It's terrible.

424
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:51,113
Now, what exactly do you do
at this security company?

425
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,044
Make coffee, sort mail.

426
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,878
But not full-time.

427
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,080
Not even part-time consistently.

428
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:02,225
They somehow got along without
coffee or mail in July and August?

429
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,058
- How much do you make there?
- Enough.

430
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,893
How much is your rent?

431
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,570
I pay my rent.

432
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,038
And when was the last time
you were late?

433
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,232
Never.

434
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,982
You think that thing through your
eyebrow makes you attractive?

435
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,409
Here's the problem.

436
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:33,055
There's a discrepancy
between the obligation...

437
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:37,353
...of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship
and the management of your finances.

438
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,759
There's no discrepancy. It was clear
I could manage my own finances.

439
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,057
That is not clear to me.

440
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,427
- I'm not a child.
- You are not. But you were.

441
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,728
And between then and now,
you were committed...

442
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,736
...to the locked ward of St. Stefan's
where you continued...

443
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,034
...to display violent aggression.

444
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,439
And you failed to adapt
to four foster homes...

445
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,911
...arrested twice for intoxication,
twice for narcotics...

446
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:03,143
...again for assault,
smashing a bottle into a man's face.

447
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,618
And it's not even that long ago.

448
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:10,089
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren
into thinking that you have changed...

449
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,091
...but when I'm looking at this...

450
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:16,232
...not to mention the way
you're looking at me now...

451
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,197
...I don't think you have.

452
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,331
So the good old
Mr. Palmgren days are over.

453
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,508
Starting now, you will be given
a monthly allowance.

454
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,939
You'll provide me with receipts
for your expenses.

455
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:30,341
If the numbers don't balance, I assume
the difference is going to drugs.

456
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,379
I've taken care of myself
since I was 10.

457
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,016
The state has taken care of you.

458
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,880
Miss Salander, please, look at me,
this is important.

459
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,387
Since your behavior
is elaborately documented in here...

460
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,116
...it will shock no one
if I chose an alternative...

461
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,694
...to the very lenient arrangement
I have just outlined.

462
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,296
Would you prefer
institutionalization?

463
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,350
- Mikael?
- Yes.

464
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,083
- I'm Liv.
- Oh, hi.

465
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,887
We're going to the same place.
Hop in.

466
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,427
Oh, good, thank you.

467
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,901
I found him at death's door,
halfway up the hill.

468
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:35,010
- I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape.
- It's a climb for anyone.

469
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,612
- I should've warned you. Come in.
- Thank you, Martin.

470
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,783
Henrik says great things about you.

471
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,943
- No, no. Leave your shoes on.
- Martin? Smells wonderful.

472
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,013
- What are we drinking?
- What a place. Look at that view.

473
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:50,853
I used to work in the company's
petrochemical division in Göteborg.

474
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,586
When it was sold, I went with it.

475
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,059
A dark day.

476
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,624
I live in Hong Kong, but come back
to Stockholm for family events.

477
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,235
And I drive up to spend
a couple of days with Martin.

478
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:04,238
- It's just the moose steak she wants.
- Who can blame her? It's wonderful.

479
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,111
Something's left open.
Do you like this wine...

480
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:13,079
...or you want to try something else?
- No, no, it's fine.

481
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,546
You're writing a book now,
Martin said.

482
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,351
- Henrik's biography.
- I love Henrik. He's fascinating.

483
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,822
Martin too.

484
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,191
Together they are the old Sweden
and the new.

485
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,626
Yes, they are.

486
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,766
You know about Harriet, right?

487
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,468
- You don't?
- Yes, I do.

488
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:40,441
The family doesn't want to talk about it,
but it can't be swept under the rug.

489
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,509
- What can't?
- Harriet.

490
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,780
We can talk about it later.

491
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,073
We can talk about it now.

492
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,510
Liv knows everything
about my crazy family.

493
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,154
- That's why she'll never marry me.
- That's one reason.

494
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,324
I don't want to read
about that in the book.

495
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,755
Everything else is fine.
Harriet certainly.

496
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:00,822
You know,
everything changed after that.

497
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,329
Not just the family
but the company as well.

498
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,559
- How so?
- We're not Ericsson or Nordea.

499
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,228
But we're still the largest
family-owned company in the country.

500
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,633
At our height we had
40,000 employees.

501
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,036
We have half of that now.

502
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:17,112
And that downward slide
began after my sister's death.

503
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,979
It broke Henrik's
entrepreneurial spirit...

504
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:25,377
...and his heart.

505
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,984
- You were here that day?
- I came in later...

506
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,889
...after the accident on the bridge,
with the 4:30 train.

507
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,031
- I know it well.
- A terrible day.

508
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,766
And the days after, you know?

509
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:43,201
Searching, not finding. Even worse.

510
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:48,010
This event, Mikael, it has to have
a big part in your book.

511
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,293
I got a call from social welfare.

512
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,299
I've been assigned a new guardian.

513
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:20,733
- Hi.
- Hello.

514
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,372
I thought I'd come over
and say hello.

515
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:27,066
- I'm Cecilia.
- Oh, yes. Please, come in.

516
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:32,405
Can I get you some coffee?

517
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,880
No, thank you.

518
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:48,857
We are all uncomfortable with the idea
of a chronicle of our family.

519
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,830
It's not about the family.
It's about Henrik and the company.

520
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,193
Like I said.

521
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,798
It's not my intention to present
a malicious portrait of anyone.

522
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,566
Unlike the one
that landed you in court.

523
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,940
Unlike that one, yes.

524
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,477
So you're not really here to find out
what happened to Harriet.

525
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:10,450
I can't ignore such a dramatic event,
but, no, that's by no means my focus.

526
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,588
Those boxes that Gunnar
carted down here...

527
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,124
...which are where, in the closet now?
Those weren't Henrik's investigation?

528
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:21,430
I wonder sometimes who's crazier,
my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.

529
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,659
Since we're talking about her...

530
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,961
...since you brought her up,
what was she like?

531
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,297
What was Harriet like?

532
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,133
- I'm sure Henrik has told you.
- He was my age back then.

533
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,505
He couldn't know what was
really going on with a teenager.

534
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:35,838
You were the same age.

535
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,911
My sister Anita
was closer to her in age.

536
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,845
She knew Harriet better than anyone.
You should talk to her.

537
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:43,645
- I'd love to. Where is she?
- Lf I had to guess, London.

538
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,151
You don't know
where your sister lives?

539
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,520
I haven't seen her in years.
We never really got along.

540
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:53,163
- I'm getting used to that comment.
- She hates this place more than I do.

541
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:56,197
She left.
Moved to London, that was it.

542
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,401
You couldn't pay her to send
a Christmas card, much less visit.

543
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,332
I'll track her down for you.

544
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,701
If you do, and try talking
to her about us...

545
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:08,036
...don't be surprised
if she tells you to fuck off.

546
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,686
You're backed up, aren't you?

547
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:19,682
Hard drive at home, yeah.

548
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,688
Okay. That's good,
because this one's done.

549
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,798
<i>Have you ever had any</i>
<i>sexually transmitted diseases?</i>

550
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:38,337
<i>And when was the last time</i>
<i>that you were tested for HIV?</i>

551
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,908
<i>How many partners have you had</i>
<i>in the last month?</i>

552
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,747
And how many of those were men?

553
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,280
It's regulation, I have to ask
these things. It's a health matter.

554
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,582
Write what you want.

555
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,124
And why do you need
such an expensive computer?

556
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,557
- For work.
- Making coffee, sorting mail.

557
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,698
- I should have control of my money.
- And you will.

558
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,596
Once you learn to be sociable,
get along with people.

559
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,532
Can you do that?

560
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:14,171
Why don't we start
with that now, huh?

561
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,877
Why don't we start with me?

562
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,559
You do something for me,
I do something for you.

563
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,759
That's what normal people do.

564
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,976
I want you to have that computer.

565
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,261
Feel that.

566
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,825
That's gabardine.

567
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,003
Unzip it.

568
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,412
And...

569
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,581
And...

570
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,137
I like the reticence.

571
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,374
It's almost convincing.

572
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,667
<i>Anita Vanger.</i>

573
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,465
- Through there.
- Thank you.

574
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:33,832
Excuse me.

575
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,512
I probably should have made
an appointment.

576
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,340
No, it's fine.

577
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,779
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

578
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,954
- Mikael.
- Mikael. How do you do?

579
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,622
How do you do?

580
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,314
So you're looking
for investment counseling?

581
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,289
Well, I would be if I had any money.

582
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,295
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

583
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:59,526
I'm writing a biography of your
Uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here.

584
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,064
I haven't seen him in over 20 years.

585
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,536
Actually, it's a lot more than that.

586
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:07,710
Haven't seen my sister,
haven't seen anyone in that family.

587
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:11,039
Most of what I'm writing about
predates that...

588
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,182
...so your recollections are valid.

589
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:16,216
I wouldn't know where to start,
if that was a question.

590
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,355
Well, then let me narrow it down.
I've gotten up to the 1960s...

591
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:23,083
...to the event that, you know,
changed everything in Henrik's life.

592
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:24,658
Harriet.

593
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:31,894
Everything that I know about that
I told to whatever his name was.

594
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,126
Morell.

595
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,168
My recollections
were a lot better then.

596
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:38,398
I'm not really speaking
about the event itself.

597
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,839
I just want to get a clearer sense
of what Harriet was like.

598
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:46,076
She was very messed up.

599
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:51,081
Well, just like all us Vanger kids,
really, but...

600
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,347
Crazy mother.

601
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,457
Drunken father.

602
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,217
At least her father wasn't a Nazi.

603
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,088
- Was he abusive?
- Mine?

604
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,627
No, hers.

605
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:05,461
Not that I ever saw, but you could tell
that something was going on.

606
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,872
Some days
she'd be very withdrawn.

607
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,907
And then the next minute
she'd be putting on makeup...

608
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:17,842
...and wearing the tightest sweater
that she had to school.

609
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:21,449
And then she'd be studying
her Bible like a nun.

610
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:24,950
No Vanger was ever religious.
Can you imagine?

611
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,749
She was obviously very unhappy.

612
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,728
- What do you think happened to her?
- Everyone knows what.

613
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,231
You don't have any thoughts
about who or why?

614
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:39,561
All that I know
is that I felt really sorry for her.

615
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,896
I got away when I was 18
and I never went back.

616
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,439
And she'd have done the same.

617
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,978
But she never made it to 18.

618
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,779
<i>Mr. Bjurman, please.</i>
<i>It's Lisbeth Salander.</i>

619
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,007
<i>Hold for a moment, please.</i>

620
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,208
<i>Lisbeth, I haven't seen you.</i>
<i>Are you well?</i>

621
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,617
I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our
appointment, I had a lot of work.

622
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:00,881
<i>Something the matter?</i>

623
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,685
No, no, nothing to be
concerned about.

624
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,863
Actually, I need another advance
on my allowance.

625
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,362
Can I come to your office tonight?

626
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,663
<i>I don't work at night, Lisbeth.</i>

627
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,598
<i>Why don't you come to my house,</i>
<i>huh? Do you have a pen?</i>

628
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,670
I don't need a pen.
What's the address?

629
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,340
<i>It's...</i>

630
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:37,382
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's me.

631
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,966
Lisbeth.

632
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,536
Come on in.

633
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,242
- You like it?
- It's nice.

634
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:01,741
It's home.

635
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,315
What do you need money for
this time?

636
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:06,546
Food.

637
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,123
How are you?

638
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:21,235
I'm so glad you decided
to come and visit.

639
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,430
I just want my money.

640
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,268
Well, let's see if we can
help you out with that.

641
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:38,979
Wait.

642
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,653
Is there a problem?

643
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,792
I just want to know...

644
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,961
...am I going to have to do this
every time I need money to eat?

645
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,925
You're so cute when you're surly.

646
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:35,871
I forgot to ask you:

647
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:37,931
You like anal sex?

648
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:37,024
<i>Faith is the assurance</i>
<i>of things hoped for...</i>

649
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:41,431
<i>... the evidence of things not seen.</i>
<i>Through faith we understand...</i>

650
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:45,096
<i>... that the world was created</i>
<i>by the word of God.</i>

651
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:35,950
- I'll drive you home.
- I can get home on my own.

652
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,186
Are you sure?

653
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,952
- Is it any warmer inside?
- No.

654
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:51,466
I apologize if you've been having
financial problems...

655
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,898
...at the magazine
during Mikael's absence.

656
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,230
- We'll work through them.
- Are you sure?

657
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:58,134
How long do you think
you can hang on?

658
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,467
Six months?

659
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:02,604
That sounds about right.

660
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,609
I used to be
in the newspaper business.

661
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,681
- We owned six dailies back in the '50s.
- We still own one.

662
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:10,978
- The <i>Courier</i>, here in town.
- Which I let my nephew, Birger, run...

663
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:13,587
...because he can't run
anything else.

664
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,190
So, what would you say
to taking on a partner?

665
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,821
Well, we've never had
to consider it before.

666
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,690
We value our independence
very much.

667
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,425
Independence in publishing
is dependent on advertisers.

668
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:30,003
However much you have, you retain.
We don't care about content.

669
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:33,300
Excuse me. Did I miss something?

670
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,102
Talking about investing
in the magazine.

671
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:39,179
- I gathered that. But why?
- Not out of greed, that's for sure.

672
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:43,614
I feel badly that I've taken Mikael away
from you at the worst possible time.

673
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:48,780
But now I am convinced that this is
the right thing to do. The moral thing.

674
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,988
That's one reason. And...

675
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,022
And?

676
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:57,192
The enemies of my friends
are my enemies.

677
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,030
How long have you been
discussing this with them?

678
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,830
I haven't. They called yesterday
and asked me to come up.

679
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,200
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You live in the woods.

680
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:09,936
- I deserve to be treated like an idiot?
- I wanted to hear what they had to say.

681
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,376
You would've said no
before they could.

682
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,413
Well, I'm saying it now.
It's a bad idea.

683
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,982
You heard me tell them
we had six months. I lied.

684
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,087
We will be out of business in three.

685
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,986
But you don't know this family
like I do. They're crazy.

686
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:24,420
We're not marrying into it.

687
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,721
If we do this,
that's exactly what we're doing.

688
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:30,195
So you wanna say no, let's say no.

689
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:34,392
Instead of 50 percent of something,
let's own 100 percent of nothing.

690
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,008
- Mikael?
- What?

691
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,542
I'm leaving this godforsaken island
in the morning.

692
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,579
- So?
- So are you coming to bed or not?

693
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,450
How much do one of those cost?

694
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,360
Around 3000.

695
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,955
This is really gonna hurt.

696
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:06,726
Your call.

697
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,903
<i>Vanger Industries took a controlling</i>
<i>interest in</i> Millennium <i>magazine...</i>

698
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,171
<i>... which, according to analysts,</i>
<i>has been in financial trouble...</i>

699
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:21,714
Millennium <i>is an excellent magazine.</i>
<i>We think it's undervalued right now...</i>

700
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,317
<i>... which is good business for us.</i>

701
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,817
Well, there's another reason.
I don't like bullies.

702
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,649
Are you referring
to Mr. Wennerström?

703
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:31,691
I'm referring to anyone who tries
to sue his enemies into submission.

704
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,294
<i>If Herr Wennerström</i>
<i>would like to try it again...</i>

705
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:37,830
<i>... he will find himself fighting a</i>
<i>company that can afford to fight back.</i>

706
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:41,731
<i>I've always admired Henrik Vanger.</i>
<i>He's a titan and a gentleman.</i>

707
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,769
<i>But he's also quite old now...</i>

708
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:47,500
<i>... which may explain how he could be</i>
<i>taken in by a convicted liar.</i>

709
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:48,733
Three-twenty.

710
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,994
Shit.

711
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,193
<i>The current archive is on CDs.</i>

712
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:54,733
<i>The older stuff, still negatives.</i>

713
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,235
What general period
are you interested in?

714
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,964
September, 1966.

715
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,311
Thank you.

716
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,483
Is this about Harriet Vanger?

717
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,947
You're too young
to know about that.

718
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:15,989
Everyone here grows up
knowing about her.

719
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,921
It's how we're taught
about strangers.

720
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:30,200
- Lisbeth.
- I need to pay my rent.

721
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:32,469
I need some money.

722
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,611
Oh, come on in.

723
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:45,876
I feel a bit badly
how we left it last time.

724
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,453
Me too.

725
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:37,030
Good. You're alive.

726
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,210
You recognize this? I had it with me
last time. I set it here, remember?

727
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,447
And this snap, you see it?
It's not a snap.

728
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:50,312
It's a wide-angle fiber-optics lens.

729
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:11,266
I thought it was going to be
another blow job...

730
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,236
...which is disgusting enough.

731
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:16,606
But I misjudged
just how sick you are.

732
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,425
Okay. Here's what's
going to happen.

733
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,579
Pay attention.

734
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,043
Look at me.

735
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,049
Once you can sit again...

736
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:03,282
...which could be a while, I admit,
we're going to go to my bank...

737
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:06,052
...and tell them that I alone
have access to my money.

738
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:09,527
Nod. After that
you will never contact me again.

739
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:13,629
Each month you will prepare a report
of a meeting we will never have.

740
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,797
In it, you'll describe
how well I'm doing.

741
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:20,806
How "sociable" I'm becoming.
Then you will negotiate with the court...

742
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,478
...to have my declaration
of incompetence lifted.

743
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:27,647
If you fail, this video will spread
across the internet like a virus.

744
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,215
Nod.

745
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:33,945
And if anything should happen to me,
if I get run over by a car...

746
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:37,819
...if you run me over with a car,
this will upload automatically.

747
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:39,990
Nod that you understand.

748
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,630
Gabardine.

749
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:49,799
I'm taking the keys to this apartment
because I'll be checking on you.

750
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:54,841
If I find a girl in here with you, whether
she came of her own free will or not...

751
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,776
No, not the video.

752
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,047
I'll kill you.

753
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,693
Do you doubt anything I've said?

754
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:17,332
Do you doubt what's in the reports that
have followed me around all my life?

755
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,991
What do they say?
If you had to sum it up.

756
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:22,295
They say I'm insane.

757
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,899
No, it's okay,
you can nod because it's true.

758
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,601
I am insane.

759
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:32,879
Nod!

760
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:38,315
I know it's going to be hard for you
to abide by my rules.

761
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,421
The abstinence part most of all.

762
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:44,916
So I'm going to make it
easier for you.

763
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,498
Lie still.

764
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,607
I've never done this before.

765
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,801
And there will be blood.

766
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,093
- Hi.
- Hi.

767
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:31,759
What are you doing here?

768
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:35,130
On my way to Skellefteå.
I can only stay a couple of hours.

769
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,140
What's in Skellefteå?

770
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,099
Bible camp.

771
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,470
Oh, yeah.

772
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,025
I'm not dangerous.

773
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:10,194
It's fine, Nilla.
Whatever you want to do is fine.

774
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,033
Everybody needs something.

775
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:13,640
Just as long as it's not God.

776
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,639
I didn't say that.

777
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:22,444
I haven't been around enough to
really know what's going on with you.

778
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:29,591
And I apologize for that. But I'd never
want you not to tell me something...

779
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:32,124
...because you think
I might not want to hear it.

780
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:34,789
That's what I'm doing.

781
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:37,689
<i>It should've been me visiting you.</i>

782
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,731
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

783
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:41,994
It was nice seeing you.

784
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:43,836
Bye-bye.

785
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:45,763
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

786
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,133
Thanks.

787
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:51,945
Oh, don't go too hard
on the Catholics.

788
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,081
- The what?
- The article you're writing.

789
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,410
Oh, I'm not writing
an article about Catholics.

790
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,417
The Bible quotes by your desk.

791
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,083
<i>I love you.</i>

792
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:41,185
<i>A woman who is a medium</i>
<i>or a sorcerer...</i>

793
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:44,457
<i>... shall be put to death by stoning.</i>

794
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,533
<i>If a dove is the sinner's offering...</i>

795
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:51,228
<i>... the priest shall wring off its head,</i>
<i>cleave its wings...</i>

796
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,373
<i>... and burn it upon the altar.</i>

797
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:59,044
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist.

798
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:00,579
<i>Yes, hello. How are you?</i>

799
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:03,377
<i>Not still freezing in Hedestad,</i>
<i>I hope, for your sake.</i>

800
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:06,486
You know that Rebecka case
you mentioned.

801
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,247
<i>Would you recall her last name?</i>

802
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:11,015
Of course I do.
But what has that to do with anything?

803
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:13,786
- Nothing, probably.
<i>- Jacobsson. Rebecka Jacobsson.</i>

804
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:18,332
<i>And how was she killed?</i>

805
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,399
She was decapitated.

806
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:23,070
<i>Her arms were cut off</i>
<i>and she was burned.</i>

807
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:26,503
<i>But all that happened in the 1940s.</i>

808
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,304
<i>- What have you found?</i>
- I have to call you back.

809
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:31,536
<i>Why...?</i>

810
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:46,294
- Is it Henrik?
- Yeah, we were talking.

811
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:48,122
He rubbed his arm,
then he collapsed.

812
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:51,094
- Think he's gonna be okay?
- I honestly don't know.

813
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,063
- You go. Talk to you later.
- I'm sorry.

814
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:05,836
Evening.

815
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:10,242
So how is he?

816
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,943
Well, the good news is he survived.

817
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:15,047
How he does now, we'll have to see.

818
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,282
- He's in intensive care.
- Right.

819
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:23,027
- May I have one of those?
- You want a sandwich?

820
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:26,234
- Small Scotch.
- Sure.

821
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:31,772
Thank you.

822
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:35,774
I hate to be indelicate,
but Henrik promised me something...

823
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,173
...when I agreed to do this.
- Yeah, Wennerström.

824
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,315
I need to know what he has on him.
Now. In case...

825
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:42,916
In case he dies?

826
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,916
- Well, that is indelicate.
- And I apologize.

827
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:48,612
I don't know what he has on him,
if you're asking me.

828
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:53,090
And he can't tell you
in the condition he's in, so...

829
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:57,821
We also didn't discuss who I'd report
to if something should happen to him.

830
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,830
Oh, well, you'd report to me,
of course.

831
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:03,934
But we both know that nothing's
going to come of this, don't we?

832
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:08,274
- No. No, we don't know that.
- What do you mean?

833
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:11,946
- I may have found something.
- You're joking.

834
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:13,672
What have you found?

835
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:18,186
The last time I reported on something
without being absolutely sure...

836
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,150
...I lost my life savings.

837
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:23,316
I need a research assistant.
Can you authorize that?

838
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:26,688
Yes. Do you have one in mind?

839
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:28,988
- I can find someone.
- I know an excellent one.

840
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,825
She did the background check
on you.

841
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:32,022
The what?

842
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:34,759
Well, you don't think we can
hire just anyone...

843
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,995
...without doing
a background check.

844
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,137
I want to read that.

845
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:42,801
Herr Frode was kind enough
to share your report with me.

846
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,241
The investigator's name.
That is her name, yes?

847
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:50,216
See, I can't find any record of her,
and I'm pretty good at that.

848
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:53,915
- Would it matter what her name is?
- Lf I wanted to speak to her, yes.

849
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,124
- It's against policy.
- You sure?

850
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,350
Just like your sources.
You understand.

851
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,549
Okay.

852
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,960
Here's a name for you.

853
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,223
My sister.

854
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:05,991
She's also my lawyer.

855
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,566
She'll be contacting you.

856
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:11,398
There are things in here that can
only have come from one place.

857
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:18,678
The reason you can find no record of
her is because her records are sealed.

858
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,339
- She's a ward of the state.
- What's that gotta do with anything?

859
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:24,909
She's had a rough life.

860
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:29,280
Can we please
not make it any rougher?

861
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:42,024
Who is it?

862
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,993
It's Mikael Blomkvist.

863
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:50,733
- Actually, I'm not really up yet.
- May I come in?

864
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,304
Please?

865
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:02,350
Hi. You and I need to talk.
I've got us some breakf...

866
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:05,048
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you had some company.

867
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,050
Who do you think you are?

868
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:10,186
I'm the guy you know better
than my closest friends do.

869
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:16,028
Why don't you put some clothes on,
get rid of your girlfriend.

870
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:17,289
We need to talk.

871
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:29,233
I'm sorry, you have to go.

872
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,105
Okay.

873
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:48,185
Do you need me to stay?

874
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:49,919
No.

875
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:59,070
- Bye.
- Bye.

876
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:07,137
Bye.

877
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,338
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

878
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,490
I guess I must have alarmed you,
turning up like that.

879
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,957
If you touch me,
I'll more than alarm you.

880
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:21,629
That won't be necessary.

881
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:25,562
Your report, very detailed.

882
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,759
- But for me, it wasn't very entertaining.
- It wasn't meant to be.

883
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,598
When I write about people,
I try to entertain the reader.

884
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:33,741
Wennerström wasn't
entertained much.

885
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:41,177
Your boss, Armansky...

886
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,750
...yeah, he tells me you only do jobs
that interest you...

887
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:47,421
...so I suppose I should be flattered.

888
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,952
You gonna sit down?

889
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:56,561
He also says that you're the one
he goes to when the job is sensitive.

890
01:18:56,765 --> 01:19:00,667
That's the word he used, "sensitive."
I'm gonna use "illegal"...

891
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:03,963
...because that's what it was
when you hacked into my computer.

892
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:07,073
No, I'm not gonna do anything
about that. I could, but I won't.

893
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:09,869
What I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna tell you a story...

894
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:13,809
...and if it entertains you, maybe you'll
decide to help me research further.

895
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:17,109
And if not, I'll do the washing up
and you'll never see me again.

896
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,220
Here, you should eat that.

897
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:22,423
What kind of research?

898
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:25,084
Lisbeth... Oh, can I call you Lisbeth?

899
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,155
I want you to help me catch
a killer of women.

900
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:31,955
<i>I've got R.J.</i>

901
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,601
Rebecka Jacobsson.
I've got absolutely no idea...

902
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:37,363
...who the rest of these are
or how they're connected...

903
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:40,541
...to the death of a 16-year-old girl,
but they must be somehow.

904
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:43,973
What we've gotta do is find out who
they are, what happened to them...
