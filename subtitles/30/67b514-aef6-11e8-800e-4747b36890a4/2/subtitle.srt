1
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:03,226
What's in your mind?

2
00:00:03,564 --> 00:00:07,591
Your mission is to divert the girl

3
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:10,362
who's reading the comic book with a wild look.

4
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:12,904
That one, no way.

5
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:14,964
What about the one next to her?

6
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:18,008
I'll take care of her,
you take care of the wild one.

7
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,078
It is an order.

8
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:39,828
Miss, do you have it?

9
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:42,168
What are you talking?

10
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:43,960
Just a little is enough.

11
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:46,705
What do you want?

12
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:48,063
I mean time.

13
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:49,266
No.

14
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:54,572
Hey.

15
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:58,307
You bastard, you wanna get away?

16
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:00,076
Don't let me catch you.

17
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:03,053
Sis.

18
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:30,873
What a coincidence?

19
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:35,622
Yes.

20
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,421
What're you doing here?

21
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:40,292
Getting a sun tan.

22
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:47,225
Good.

23
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:51,197
Let's go.

24
00:01:54,508 --> 00:01:56,442
Seems like we've known for a long time.

25
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,407
Yes, I have the same feeling.

26
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:03,107
Tell you the truth, I like you.

27
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:05,879
I know.

28
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:10,047
Tell you the truth, I'm not short-sighted.

29
00:02:11,158 --> 00:02:12,523
Blocking...

30
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:30,070
Returning to the point.
Where did I leave off?

31
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:31,908
Returning to the point.

32
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,274
Yes, do you know

33
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:36,439
a guy named Mike Chan?

34
00:02:38,352 --> 00:02:39,751
Do you know Mike Chan?

35
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,654
- No.
- What?

36
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:44,948
- What?
- Mike Chan?

37
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,524
I don't know him.

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,820
Mike... Chan.

39
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:53,089
There's Mike Chu, and Peter Chan,

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,158
but not Mike Chan.

41
00:02:56,136 --> 00:02:59,367
Have you forgotten?
Please think carefully.

42
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:01,029
It's very important to me.

43
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:02,639
I think my sister may know.

44
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:04,003
Then let's go and find her.

45
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,354
See how long can you stand.

46
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:50,078
Play? Let's play together.

47
00:03:50,257 --> 00:03:51,747
No, thank you.

48
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:54,118
Get up, are you okay?

49
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:55,352
Yes.

50
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:56,757
Sis, do you know

51
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,295
a guy called Mike Chan?

52
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,731
Mike Chan?

53
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,594
Tell him.

54
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:01,756
Which Mike Chan?

55
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:03,129
This Mike Chan.

56
00:04:04,237 --> 00:04:06,569
Oh, it's Coward Chan.

57
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,734
Coward Chan?

58
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:10,433
Yes, it's him.

59
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,202
Four days absent in a week.

60
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:13,846
Sleeping in the class.

61
00:04:14,014 --> 00:04:14,673
Is that right?

62
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:15,473
Yes.

63
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:17,810
Do you know what are his activities?

64
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:19,948
He doesn't have any.

65
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,384
He's a coward.

66
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,148
Play ball.

67
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:28,750
Play ball.

68
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:31,364
I have to try it this time.

69
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:33,797
I don't think it's a good idea.

70
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,194
This isn't our game.

71
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:38,735
Sis isn't afraid, why you?

72
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:40,236
You haven't tried it before?

73
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:42,866
Yes, I haven't.

74
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:44,067
Me too.

75
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:44,801
Is it right?

76
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:45,842
Let's try it.

77
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:48,003
We're no longer kids afterwards.

78
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:49,642
Come, try once.

79
00:04:49,816 --> 00:04:50,578
I don't think so.

80
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:52,048
Come on, there's no one here.

81
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:53,379
- No.
- Once!

82
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:54,918
- Okay...
- Hurry!

83
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,146
Can you take it?

84
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,220
- Quick!
- Coming...

85
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:01,825
- You won't regret?
- No!

86
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:02,984
- Close your eyes then.
- No!

87
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:03,629
Then I'm coming.

88
00:05:03,797 --> 00:05:05,094
- Come.
- Coming...

89
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:16,468
What are you doing?

90
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:21,812
You've got asthma?

91
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:23,842
No, just breathing.

92
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:25,477
Breathing?

93
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:27,751
Where's my glasses?

94
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:28,683
What glasses?

95
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:30,914
- Glasses...
- Glasses?

96
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:33,449
Okay.

97
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:35,488
How do you feel?

98
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:36,890
Alright, you?

99
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:38,291
Very good.

100
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:41,023
But little girl shouldn't try this.

101
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:43,065
If you wanna try, count me in.

102
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:44,294
You aren't afraid of asthma?

103
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:47,304
Yes, but for you, it's okay.

104
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,166
- Chow Sing-Sing
- Run!

105
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:52,572
I wanna ask you something.

106
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:54,543
- It's you.
- Don't be afraid...

107
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:55,874
What?

108
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:58,813
I think you're the only one
who can teach me.

109
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:01,018
How to get a girlfriend?

110
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:03,380
Why ask me?

111
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,354
I've seen you two just now,
very skillful.

112
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:11,057
It's only basics, any target?

113
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:14,792
Yes... but... I'm afraid.

114
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:16,230
No problem, let's discuss it.

115
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:18,735
Of course, you should have
the guts to do it.

116
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:21,372
But, I think you should
take care of your hair first.

117
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,906
Yes... yes...

118
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,478
Wasting my time.

119
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:29,906
All those stuffs are irrelevant.

120
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:32,680
How are you, Turtle?

121
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:33,783
Turtle...

122
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:36,252
So powerful! How can a kiss

123
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:37,856
be that powerful?

124
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,015
It must be the power of love.

125
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,788
When do you marry her then?

126
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:45,159
She said when she'd get enough saving.

127
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:50,827
Fine... Then I must be the most miserable?!

128
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,399
I'm in love with a little girl.

129
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:53,630
How can I end that up?

130
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:57,675
Sing, you've got a girlfriend.
Can you manage?

131
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:03,510
I can manage that for you.

132
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,115
Okay... go ahead.

133
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:07,185
You must be kidding.

134
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:10,555
Look at me... my appearance... by how?

135
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:13,522
Good that you know.

136
00:07:14,594 --> 00:07:17,859
After all, it's a big trouble.

137
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:20,797
Big brother... I've got information.

138
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:21,956
What?

139
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:25,263
Mike's been out with
the two girls over there.

140
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:27,371
Those two...

141
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:32,135
You two... go and handle them first.

142
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,145
Sing, you always ask us to do so.

143
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:37,215
Are we like gigolo?

144
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:40,109
- Then do you go for it?
- Of course.

145
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:44,685
Such young men

146
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,726
can't hold themselves on.

147
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:50,062
How can they handle big cases?!

148
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,454
Hello.

149
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:53,432
Hi...

150
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:54,929
Go and buy a drink with me!

151
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:58,501
Drink only?
How about... lunch together?

152
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,477
Still playing?!

153
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:06,077
Does Sing

154
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:07,736
really have a girlfriend?

155
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:09,912
Yes, very pretty?

156
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:10,913
Prettier than you.

157
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:13,882
Yes, tell Sandy to consider me.

158
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:15,282
I'm not bad, right?

159
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:17,218
Just the haircut is a bit outdated.

160
00:08:17,557 --> 00:08:18,717
Bad boy.

161
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:24,361
Do you have another girlfriend? Tell me.

162
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:25,498
No.

163
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:27,326
Why your ears turned red?

164
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:28,691
Don't know.

165
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:33,703
What a shame to know your friends.

166
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:35,067
Let me tell you.

167
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:37,141
Don't let me see Chow Sing-Sing again.

168
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,470
If I see him.

169
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,545
I'll beat him up. Did you hear?

170
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:47,419
You don't wanna go out with me?

171
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:49,783
Not really. It depends.

172
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:52,655
Tell me if you don't want.

173
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,787
If you like me, you should hold my hand.

174
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:57,361
But not holding the school bag.

175
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,120
That's what I mean.

176
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,633
Get something to eat.

177
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:05,661
What did you say earlier?

178
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,138
I ask you again, am I pretty?

179
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:10,867
- Say it
- Pretty...

180
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,371
Let's go somewhere else.

181
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,175
What?

182
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:19,613
I wanna pee.

183
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:20,218
I wait for you.

184
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:21,513
Let's go together.

185
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:24,686
No, don't talk in the washroom,
talk it here.

186
00:09:24,858 --> 00:09:25,916
Do you wanna pee?

187
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:27,582
I wanna hold it for a while.

188
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:28,859
Can you?

189
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,395
Nothing's hard in the world
if you're sincere.

190
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:32,858
Go and get something to eat.

191
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,793
- You hold it a while then.
- Okay!

192
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:40,271
To be an undercover, I'm ready for this.

193
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,750
How come you're like this?

194
00:09:58,925 --> 00:09:59,448
Let's go.

195
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:00,923
No... There's someone I know.

196
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,385
Uncle, auntie.

197
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,358
What a coincidence?!

198
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:06,692
Yes, it is. This is Miss Ho.

199
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,493
She's my previous previous tutor.

200
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:11,395
Miss Ho, ever since you
stopped tutoring me.

201
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,232
My school result drops.

202
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:15,437
Come to my place if you have time.

203
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:17,240
But I'm going to move.

204
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:17,933
Are you?

205
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:19,078
I'm getting married.

206
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:21,179
Marry? Congratulations.

207
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:22,279
Thank you.

208
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:23,882
Congratulations.

209
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:26,474
I'm dating now.

210
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:28,313
Your boyfriend?

211
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:30,620
Hello, how are you?

212
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,851
But he's naughty.

213
00:10:34,294 --> 00:10:35,886
How interesting.

214
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:37,320
Let's go.

215
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:38,063
Haven't eat yet?!

216
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:39,220
I'm not feeling well.

217
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,767
Excuse me, I have to go.

218
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:42,629
Okay, bye...

219
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:44,895
Bye...

220
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:47,500
Bye, I'm safe now.

221
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:48,732
- Sing...
- Who is it?

222
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:50,205
- It's me.
- You've got the wrong person, man.

223
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:51,343
Not wrong.

224
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,276
If it's not your voice,
I couldn't recognize you.

225
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:57,643
Sit...

226
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:58,749
It's you?!

227
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:00,613
Yes... Sit...

228
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:03,312
Let me fix the situation for you.

229
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:05,248
Miss Ho, don't you get mad.

230
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,756
The reason why Sing is with Sandy lately.

231
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:09,656
It's all because of work.

232
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:12,889
There may be some personal
feeling between them.

233
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:15,167
It's hard to say,
but don't think it's real.

234
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:16,597
You too.

235
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:18,997
In fact, Sing is aggressive.

236
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:20,900
Even though he got fired
by the police force.

237
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:22,268
He still comes back as undercover.

238
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:24,410
Also, because of it,

239
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:25,339
he even spent

240
00:11:25,512 --> 00:11:27,412
$100,000 of your wedding money.

241
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,410
What a guy!

242
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:29,513
He's very miserable now.

243
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:31,081
Look at him, right?

244
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:33,583
So, let's think of a way to help him.

245
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:34,945
Let's think.

246
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:37,880
That means the wedding is off.

247
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:42,258
Good idea, what a good solution it is.

248
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:43,122
No wedding.

249
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:47,255
You damn fool. I'm in big trouble now.

250
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:51,126
Why insult me?

251
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:52,630
I helped you.

252
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:57,599
Lucky that we don't
have your kind in our team.

253
00:11:57,844 --> 00:11:59,607
Damn Old Fool.

254
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:01,173
You insult me?

255
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:03,247
What? "Damn Old Fool".

256
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:03,939
Say it once more.

257
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:05,516
Damn Old... Fool.

258
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:08,849
Why did you hit him?

259
00:12:09,022 --> 00:12:10,182
He insulted me.

260
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:12,051
Me too, why didn't you beat me?

261
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:14,253
I'm not as big as you.

262
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:15,585
You know it better.

263
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:26,237
Have a cup of tea.

264
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:34,109
Don't be angry, those guys are just...

265
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:35,837
jealous of you.

266
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,714
Don't you worry. I'm here.

267
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:42,618
But this case depends on you.

268
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:48,460
The problem isn't you,
it's Chow Sing-Sing.

269
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:52,622
This guy's gone too far.
He'll get in trouble soon.

270
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,556
You have to be careful.

271
00:12:56,636 --> 00:12:57,660
Here, go have some fun.

272
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:01,669
Here's my supplementary visa card to you.

273
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:05,140
Are you teaching me?

274
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:06,579
No.

275
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:09,746
Don't ever say bad things
about my friend before me.

276
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:14,309
I admire your loyalty.

277
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:16,212
You know?

278
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:19,081
Everyone respect you in the station.

279
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:24,053
They say you're honest,
capable, kind and generous.

280
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:27,455
If the world has more people like you,

281
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,200
it'll be good.

282
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:33,236
So, what you gonna do?

283
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:36,139
- Expel Sing.
- Good!

284
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:45,845
Don't follow me, I'm getting married.

285
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,247
I like to.

286
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,780
You've got no future.

287
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:50,513
I don't want future.

288
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,055
Give it to someone else
if you don't want it.

289
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:54,193
Don't bug me.

290
00:13:54,494 --> 00:13:56,155
What about me?

291
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:59,898
Ask your mother, don't ask me.

292
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:03,368
Have you ever liked me?

293
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:12,009
You know it's only a game.

294
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:24,548
What? Am I contagious?

295
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:26,719
Jacky said you're no good,

296
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:28,724
asked me not to be with you.

297
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:56,180
Fellow classmates.

298
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,848
We're here to have a test,
how about it?

299
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:02,726
Get out.

300
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:18,107
Damn you.

301
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:23,940
Throwing dusters in front of me?

302
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,686
When I throw dusters,
you're still nowhere.

303
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:30,114
Tell them to get back to class.

304
00:15:30,857 --> 00:15:31,755
You tell.

305
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:33,616
I tell?

306
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:35,458
You're the teacher.

307
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:38,263
Where's your dignity? How do you teach?

308
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:39,728
Say it.

309
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:40,990
Class begins.

310
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:42,532
Louder.

311
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:44,263
Class begins.

312
00:15:44,437 --> 00:15:45,802
Say in complete sentence.

313
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:50,102
Class begins, today... has a test.

314
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:54,406
Class begins, today has a test.

315
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:57,142
Is it okay?

316
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:01,619
Test, test.

317
00:16:04,123 --> 00:16:05,852
Chow Sing-Sing, you come out.

318
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:08,454
I'm not in a good mood today,
what do you want?

319
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:09,959
I can't control myself.

320
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:11,562
Let me go then.

321
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:12,720
Mr. Principal.

322
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:13,829
Hello, Mr. Principal.

323
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,592
Hello, Sing, long time no see.

324
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:16,632
Yes, I haven't seen you at school.

325
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:17,462
How's business?

326
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:19,104
It all depends on the students.

327
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:20,762
Where are you getting rich?

328
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:22,804
Rich? Most important is to
have you to look after me.

329
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:25,970
I've taken over a food stall
at Temple Street. Interested?

330
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:28,142
A food stall? Yes.

331
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:29,212
Okay, count you in.

332
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:30,212
Well thanks.

333
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,010
Why are your parents looking for me?

334
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:32,810
What parents?

335
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:33,451
Your mother.

336
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:34,108
Your mother.

337
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:34,912
Your mother.

338
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:36,452
She's here, Auntie.

339
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:37,520
Yes!

340
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:44,323
You bad boy, I'm here to
withdraw you from school.

341
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:46,291
Mr. Principal? I'm here to withdraw my son.

342
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:47,194
Welcome...

343
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,095
It's sad to see kids school less.

344
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:50,360
Who said so?

345
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:51,901
Hold it, who said withdrawal.

346
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:52,662
I said it.

347
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:53,305
Hello, Madam?

348
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:54,872
What Madam, call me mother.

349
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,770
What? You did it with my dad?

350
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:59,741
Of course, or else how would I have you?

351
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:02,412
You don't acknowledge me, is it?

352
00:17:02,582 --> 00:17:03,241
You did it with my dad?

353
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,178
I've done it too.

354
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,375
Look, I've brought his birth certificate.

355
00:17:06,552 --> 00:17:09,578
His mother, Yu Su-Chiu, that's me.

356
00:17:10,122 --> 00:17:11,111
What, you're Yu Su-Chiu?

357
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,157
Yes, I can prove she's Yu Su-Chiu.

358
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:15,789
Be quiet please.

359
00:17:15,962 --> 00:17:18,192
Give me time to think what has happened.

360
00:17:18,364 --> 00:17:18,955
Okay.

361
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:20,894
Right, kids must go to school.

362
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,297
What? What are you talking about?

363
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:27,166
Look, what do you think I look like?

364
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,867
What? Yes, you've got it, I'm a hooker.

365
00:17:31,244 --> 00:17:35,476
I'm at the whorehouse at Portland Street,

366
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:37,843
called the Big Breasts girl.

367
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:40,712
And I've been worked
as a hooker for 25 years.

368
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,285
Come when you have time.

369
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:43,444
How much do you charge?

370
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:44,214
You?

371
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,880
Just wanna know.

372
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:50,051
$100, buy one get one free.

373
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:53,457
10 men a night, only get $500.

374
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:56,830
If I work hard for the whole month,

375
00:17:57,336 --> 00:17:59,201
I can only survive, hold this for me.

376
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:00,532
I have to scold the bad boy.

377
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,071
You bad boy.

378
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:05,638
You said you'll attend English school
to get foreigners for me.

379
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:09,269
But you come here for fun.

380
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:11,478
Poor me.

381
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:14,511
How come hooker wears a gun?

382
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:15,654
Yes...

383
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,085
I even buy you a toy gun.

384
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,287
He likes to play toy gun.

385
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:26,956
Thank you, mom.

386
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,364
You give it back to me.

387
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:30,502
Didn't you say that you bought it for me?

388
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,568
You... give...

389
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:32,328
You bought it for me.

390
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:33,995
Yes.

391
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:34,764
Then it's mine.

392
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:37,466
I wanna play it now, I wanna try it.

393
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,638
Look up.

394
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:39,835
Let me play.

395
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:42,105
You love me, you bought me the gun.

396
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:43,680
Play.

397
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,407
You play, but don't aim at me.

398
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:47,875
Don't.

399
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:51,016
Don't aim at anybody.

400
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:54,851
Sing, playing gun in school
is a serious crime.

401
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:56,752
I want school.

402
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:58,157
No, put down the gun.

403
00:18:58,331 --> 00:19:01,027
I'll play gun if no school.

404
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:08,139
Are you alright?

405
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:09,069
Alright...

406
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:11,266
The gun is loud.

407
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:16,978
Don't.

408
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:18,810
The gun is here.

409
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:20,982
The gun is so real.

410
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:25,717
Don't play gun... very serious...

411
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:28,223
What? I'm in charge here.

412
00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:34,388
The sound is so real.

413
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,628
Wow! The gun is really powerful.

414
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:40,194
Mrs. Chow,

415
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:41,635
where did you get such a toy gun?

416
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:42,739
Damn you.

417
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,705
Mrs. Chow, I'll teach a lesson to your son.

418
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:46,037
Let's go!

419
00:19:47,947 --> 00:19:50,108
Hey, you really wanna mess things up?

420
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:51,681
You mess things up, not me.

421
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:53,375
What do you mean to withdraw me?

422
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:54,541
What can you do here?

423
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,312
I'm in charge here.

424
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:57,783
Don't be so mean.

425
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:59,549
I just wanna help you.

426
00:19:59,725 --> 00:20:01,420
Help? You just wanna help yourself.

427
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:02,925
You're selfish.

428
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:04,655
Let me try once, okay?

429
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,060
Whether lose or win,
I'll take the consequences.

430
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:09,296
My career, romance and future

431
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:11,459
are all in your hand.

432
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:13,329
Leave now if you wanna help me.

433
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:15,235
Silence means you promise.

434
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:17,035
It's only a toy gun, don't get excited.

435
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:18,904
It's for kids.

436
00:20:19,078 --> 00:20:20,170
It's not for adults.

437
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:21,938
Fire all my bullets, how do I report it?

438
00:20:22,114 --> 00:20:22,808
- Mrs. Chow.
- Yes.

439
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:23,573
You can leave with your son.

440
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:24,807
Good.

441
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:28,547
Why are you in such a hurry?

442
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:29,982
I'm leaving, bye.

443
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,323
I'm just playing, no need to scold me.

444
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:33,788
Then why you didn't respect her.

445
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,051
You deserve it.

446
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:36,558
Go back to your business.

447
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:47,303
Big brother.

448
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:50,533
You're leaving?

449
00:20:51,577 --> 00:20:54,375
This is my phone number, call me.

450
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:00,376
What is it?

451
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:03,819
School map, good for escape.

452
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:04,948
Did you draw it?

453
00:21:05,124 --> 00:21:06,386
No, just pick it.

454
00:21:13,632 --> 00:21:15,099
Who would draw something like this?

455
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:16,996
Beat the shit out of me.

456
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:19,368
Here.

457
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,632
Where did you get this map?

458
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:24,298
Sing gave it to me.

459
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:27,444
Where did Sing get it?

460
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:29,613
I don't know.

461
00:21:30,716 --> 00:21:33,276
Madam Wong, do you believe in Sing?

462
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,848
I believe in Tat.

463
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:37,681
I believe in Sing.

464
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,148
I believe in Sing.

465
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:40,883
How can I trust you guys?

466
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:44,856
I believe you...

467
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,930
You believe in Sing, he said so.

468
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,126
Madam, I've talked
to the Secretary of Security.

469
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:53,396
You guys from RCU are no
longer needed in this case.

470
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:55,335
We'll take care of it ourselves.

471
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:59,408
You can continue believing in Sing.

472
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:03,877
Sorry, Lydia.

473
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:07,877
Tat, I trust you...

474
00:22:17,863 --> 00:22:18,852
Where's Sandy?

475
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:21,827
Don't know, I'm busy now.

476
00:22:22,635 --> 00:22:25,297
I told you to keep an eye on her.

477
00:22:25,504 --> 00:22:27,028
Seems she went downstairs.

478
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:28,696
Why didn't you say earlier.

479
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:33,969
Hey, still some more, finish it.

480
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:39,778
Come on, mark the time.

481
00:22:41,554 --> 00:22:42,953
No watch.

482
00:22:43,122 --> 00:22:44,316
Let's go.

483
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:51,023
Mr. Lee, we're on position.

484
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,259
Over.

485
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:58,531
Hey, have a drink first.

486
00:22:58,704 --> 00:22:59,830
- Let's go.
- Okay.

487
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,098
Make sure you know where they are.

488
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:33,397
Got it.

489
00:23:34,073 --> 00:23:36,064
These guys are really amateurs.

490
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:45,843
Yesterday Prime Minister John Major
told reporters that.

491
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:50,216
British government has no intention of
yielding to any terrorist demands.

492
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:50,946
He denied.

493
00:23:51,123 --> 00:23:55,389
Any negotiations have taken place between
the terrorist group and Government.

494
00:23:55,861 --> 00:23:56,691
Let's see how tough

495
00:23:56,862 --> 00:23:59,626
they play when I've got
300 school kids in my hand.

496
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:01,057
Roll the ball.

497
00:24:03,435 --> 00:24:04,663
See you later.

498
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:07,001
The machine isn't working.

499
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:08,161
Let me check it.

500
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:24,816
Let me tell you a secret.

501
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,684
What?

502
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:28,656
There's terrorists in Hong Kong.

503
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:30,419
Crazy...

504
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:40,532
Merry Christmas.

505
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,284
Don't move. I don't want to hurt anybody.

506
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:11,193
Everything's ready.

507
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,141
Hurry...

508
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,528
Hello.

509
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:40,728
Sing.

510
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:42,228
Louder.

511
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:43,700
Sing.

512
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:52,104
Where's those guys from Special Branch?
Where's Tat?

513
00:25:56,982 --> 00:25:58,882
Go to call the police at once,

514
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:00,279
I'll be there immediately.

515
00:26:05,257 --> 00:26:05,780
Special Branch.

516
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,220
Hello, I'm Chow Sing-Sing.

517
00:26:07,393 --> 00:26:08,087
Damn you!

518
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,525
Hello...

519
00:26:13,565 --> 00:26:16,033
What's the telephone no.
Of calling police?

520
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:18,667
999. Quick!

521
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,499
We've got a mantle of frequency
in here from around here.

522
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:24,733
With intention to jam the signal.

523
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,401
I can't exact the signal
path is moving too fast.

524
00:26:27,646 --> 00:26:29,136
Johnathan, check it out.

525
00:26:46,598 --> 00:26:48,793
Damn you.

526
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:28,406
Follow me.

527
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:41,951
Wait... I'll do this one.

528
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,550
What's the problem?

529
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,249
Someone's going?

530
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:52,096
Shit... get them to the basement.

531
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:55,332
Get up, move...

532
00:27:56,034 --> 00:28:00,095
Moving...

533
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,203
Sir.

534
00:28:09,381 --> 00:28:10,473
Sing, why are you back?

535
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,344
There's a heavy armed group of terrorists.

536
00:28:12,518 --> 00:28:13,712
Currently kidnapped a group of hostages.

537
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:16,354
I want you to dispatch
a team of SDU to save them.

538
00:28:16,588 --> 00:28:17,577
I haven't received the order from above.

539
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:18,654
There won't be any

540
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:20,985
because there's only me
who know at this time.

541
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,918
You're the captain here before.

542
00:28:23,228 --> 00:28:25,890
We can't go without the order from above.

543
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:27,656
I know, but there're lives involved.

544
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:28,857
It's emergency.

545
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:29,557
There's no more time.

546
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:31,225
Sorry, can't help you.

547
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,867
Then can you lent me your warrant card.

548
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:34,130
Well...

549
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,040
Sing, you wanna go to jail?

550
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,268
Yes, Sir.

551
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:47,477
Team No. 3, unit A, B, C move out.

552
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:51,282
There're hundred of lives waiting
for you to rescue.

553
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:54,391
I'll take every responsibility. Believe me?

554
00:28:57,229 --> 00:28:58,161
Yes, Sir.

555
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:58,796
Move out.

556
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:10,832
Move it...

557
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:36,293
Hold it.

558
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,470
Under the pool, there's an air-raid shelter.

559
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:42,173
Follow me.

560
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:53,016
That way.

561
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,111
Hurry.

562
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:00,718
Get away... Let me do it.

563
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:11,899
Go.

564
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:16,906
Go.

565
00:30:22,748 --> 00:30:24,409
Why is it so bright suddenly?

566
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,578
Where's my glasses?

567
00:30:26,985 --> 00:30:28,782
Feels uncomfortable without my glasses.

568
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:30,019
It's here.

569
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,585
Damn it, the entrance is exploded.

570
00:31:27,813 --> 00:31:29,280
Kill you bastards.

571
00:31:38,223 --> 00:31:39,383
How come it's hot dogs?

572
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:49,090
Watch out, hurry...

573
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:52,065
- Be careful...
- Hurry...

574
00:31:52,237 --> 00:31:53,534
Police, freeze.

575
00:31:54,406 --> 00:31:55,703
Don't shoot, we're on the same side.

576
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:58,775
- Mr. Chow, I met them in the tunnel.
- Lower down.

577
00:31:58,944 --> 00:32:01,105
Sing, very scary, the terrorists.

578
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,211
Shut up!

579
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:03,443
How did you get out?

580
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:05,480
We came from the underground tunnel.

581
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:06,809
But it was exploded.

582
00:32:06,985 --> 00:32:07,815
Can't go in again.

583
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:08,953
Any injuries?

584
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:11,885
No, we're all safe, except me.

585
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:13,421
You're the best.

586
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:16,425
Yes, he's very good...

587
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,760
Any more students inside?

588
00:32:22,934 --> 00:32:24,401
I don't know but Tat is in there.

589
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:25,058
Tat?

590
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:25,896
He saved us.

591
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:26,833
He saved you?

592
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:28,131
Like an exterminator.

593
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:29,102
Exterminator?

594
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:30,935
But don't know if he's dead or not?

595
00:32:32,277 --> 00:32:32,868
Go in at once.

596
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:34,068
Yes, Sir.

597
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:38,905
Damn it.

598
00:32:40,185 --> 00:32:42,619
Hold on...

599
00:32:50,395 --> 00:32:53,296
Surrender! It's unfair
that you have two against me.

600
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,362
You'll learn a lesson
when my partner comes.

601
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:00,427
Fire.

602
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:23,559
There's a lot of police here.

603
00:33:23,728 --> 00:33:25,389
Got to make some help now.

604
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:27,123
Shit.

605
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:36,671
Move in.

606
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:47,449
Pay attention.
There must be more students.

607
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:03,591
Lead them out.

608
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:39,564
Remember, we're going to save is

609
00:34:39,738 --> 00:34:41,262
a Chinese man with moustache.

610
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,337
Any discovery?

611
00:34:42,974 --> 00:34:43,872
No, Sir.

612
00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:48,102
Sir, does he have any characteristic marks?

613
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:50,637
Marks?!

614
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:55,549
Indecency.

615
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:59,353
What about personality?

616
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:01,920
What personality?

617
00:35:02,093 --> 00:35:04,084
Who asked this stupid question?

618
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,381
Found anybody?

619
00:35:32,557 --> 00:35:34,149
No, we've searched all classrooms.

620
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,036
There's a whole fucking army out there.

621
00:35:54,212 --> 00:35:54,837
Oh, dear.

622
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:56,241
Move.

623
00:36:00,385 --> 00:36:01,477
Stand there...

624
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:02,444
You're Chow Sing-Sing?

625
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:03,588
- Sir.
- Sir.

626
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:04,517
Have you seen Terminator?

627
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:05,280
Which Terminator?

628
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:06,947
- James Bond.
- Which James Bond?

629
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,092
Head of discipline.

630
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:09,624
What head of dispensary?

631
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:11,289
- Take him out.
- Yes, Sir.

632
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:12,427
Take him out.

633
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:14,958
Don't.

634
00:36:51,636 --> 00:36:52,728
Light-grenade.

635
00:37:33,244 --> 00:37:34,370
Sir, who to do next?

636
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:35,635
Get him out for first aids.

637
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,346
What about you?

638
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:37,640
Hurry, save life first.

639
00:37:41,953 --> 00:37:42,977
Sir.

640
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:45,816
I cover you, ready, go.

641
00:38:26,664 --> 00:38:28,063
Kill all of you guys.

642
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:05,964
Anybody still alive?

643
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:08,969
Anybody still alive?

644
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:12,609
Answer me if there is any.

645
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:16,747
I've reached the last machine room, over.

646
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:20,410
Read me? Over...

647
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:22,779
Hello...

648
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:26,813
Freeze.

649
00:39:27,392 --> 00:39:29,826
Sing, relay...

650
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:43,139
No weapons please.

651
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,012
And hand gun.

652
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:54,909
Easy.

653
00:40:01,893 --> 00:40:04,657
Very nice, turn around...

654
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:10,456
Why?

655
00:40:12,503 --> 00:40:14,733
Because I want you to turn around.

656
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:32,483
What?

657
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:48,194
You fool.

658
00:40:55,713 --> 00:40:57,044
Bye...

659
00:41:05,657 --> 00:41:06,351
Are you alright?

660
00:41:06,524 --> 00:41:08,788
Yes... where's the bullet?

661
00:41:09,727 --> 00:41:10,421
Where did you hide it?

662
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:11,357
In my back.

663
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:12,655
Is it?

664
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:15,456
All inside.

665
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,865
You've been shot?

666
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:21,731
You're pretending just now.

667
00:41:22,407 --> 00:41:24,932
Young man, be realistic.

668
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:26,337
Don't cheat around.

669
00:41:26,511 --> 00:41:27,978
Don't bullshit, I'm in pain.

670
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:28,908
Let me get an ambulance.

671
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,240
- Hold it.
- What?

672
00:41:30,415 --> 00:41:33,009
Everybody is coming.
Let me be rewarded first.

673
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:35,074
You're greedy again?

674
00:41:36,054 --> 00:41:37,954
What? You are.

675
00:41:39,757 --> 00:41:41,315
He's not police, I have to arrest him.

676
00:41:42,827 --> 00:41:44,419
Chow Sing-Sing's action

677
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:47,530
is planned by our RCU's

678
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,329
Don't misbehave.

679
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:50,759
Tsao Tat-Wah.

680
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:52,459
I'll be responsible for everything.

681
00:41:52,704 --> 00:41:55,696
You've done a good job, no student is hurt.

682
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:56,464
Thank you, Sir.

683
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:59,109
Sir, you've promised
that RCU isn't involved.

684
00:41:59,777 --> 00:42:00,505
No.

685
00:42:00,678 --> 00:42:04,170
Yes, there's an order, here,
see for yourself.

686
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:06,514
You're hated by me more.

687
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:16,450
Wow... hand grenade.

688
00:42:24,068 --> 00:42:26,059
Bastard, interrupt me while I'm talking.

689
00:42:26,237 --> 00:42:27,397
Don't think that there's
no arrest after death.

690
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:29,039
Lock him up.

691
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:35,079
Who pushed me to the front?

692
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:36,846
I'll settle with you latter.

693
00:42:37,548 --> 00:42:38,708
Thank you.

694
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:42,948
This time, you got me in trouble.

695
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:44,616
Sir.

696
00:42:47,992 --> 00:42:49,926
Have I misbehaved this time?

697
00:42:50,094 --> 00:42:53,928
You've learned from me at last.

698
00:42:54,098 --> 00:42:55,360
Thank you.

699
00:42:56,134 --> 00:42:57,294
Chow Sing-Sing.

700
00:42:59,103 --> 00:43:00,001
Yes, Madam.

701
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:04,039
You have done very well,
we welcome you back to the police force.

702
00:43:04,642 --> 00:43:07,440
But, I'm not interested
in the traffic unit.

703
00:43:07,612 --> 00:43:09,102
Don't worry.

704
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,046
This time you'll be either
Chief Superintendent or Chief Inspector.

705
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,484
Thank you, Madam.

706
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:18,519
I've heard that you've been shot.

707
00:43:18,689 --> 00:43:23,558
Yes, but to me, it is only a scratch.

708
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:25,855
It's really nothing.

709
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,631
Very good, any request?

710
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:31,291
I want an ambulance.

711
00:43:32,336 --> 00:43:33,200
Call an ambulance.

712
00:43:33,371 --> 00:43:35,032
Ambulance?

713
00:43:54,392 --> 00:43:55,825
Someone's dating me.

714
00:43:56,194 --> 00:43:57,684
See if you can beat him first.

715
00:43:58,563 --> 00:44:02,192
Okay? I'm not a coward anymore.

716
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,194
Did I say I wanna date you?

717
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:09,796
I came here to learn flower
arrangement only.

718
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,868
You bastard snatch my girl,
I'll beat you up.

719
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:18,174
Beat you.

720
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,975
