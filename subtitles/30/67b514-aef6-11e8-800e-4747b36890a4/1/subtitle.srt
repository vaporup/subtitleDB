1
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,347
Sir.

2
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,342
What's your mission today?

3
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,284
Save hostages, Sir.

4
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,048
What?

5
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,714
Save hostages, Sir.

6
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,860
Kill hostage is more proper.

7
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,492
Such a lovely girl

8
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,461
was destroyed by you.

9
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,863
Can't you differentiate enemy and friend?

10
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,203
Did I tell you how many hostages?

11
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,339
No, Sir.

12
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,406
So you thought there's only me.

13
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,434
And you, rolling in and firing
at the same time are cool, right?

14
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,513
Didn't look behind you?

15
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:07,483
If I were the one who got up,

16
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,088
I'd be shot by you.

17
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,653
Then you have to handle my funeral

18
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,224
and also my parents.

19
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,363
Look at you, can you afford it?

20
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,594
Is it enough?

21
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,200
Yes, Sir.

22
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,800
Good, no more scolding then.

23
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,570
From tomorrow onwards, I'll be promoted

24
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,402
to a better life.

25
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,971
You'll be on your own.

26
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,740
Yes, Sir.

27
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,376
Give me five...

28
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,686
Are you happy that I leave?

29
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,758
Let me tell you.

30
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,129
I'm happier than you.

31
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,006
Sir Chow, your file hasn't come back yet.

32
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,440
Madam will see you later.

33
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,508
Alright then.

34
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,653
I know you may think I'm boasting.

35
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,884
But you think about it.

36
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:21,787
When I sit in that room,
I'll give out orders.

37
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,189
How can I not be proud of myself?

38
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,593
I'm lovelorn.

39
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,661
I'm finally promoted.

40
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,493
I'm lovelorn.

41
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,067
Lovelorn!

42
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,335
You're lovelorn?

43
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,770
Is it possible? You've dated before?

44
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,775
No.

45
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,810
That is!

46
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,242
We're pen pals.

47
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,511
Pen pals.

48
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,116
We've corresponded for three years.

49
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,014
Recently, she stopped writing to me.

50
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,619
Why?

51
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,482
Cause I sent her a photo.

52
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,022
You asked for it.

53
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,455
How can you send a picture of your face?

54
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,288
Right, that's why I sent yours.

55
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:58,790
My picture?

56
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,762
Yes, your picture,

57
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,594
and then she never writes me back.

58
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,340
Well, it's not your fault.

59
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,167
It's not a sin to have an ugly face.

60
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:26,752
What's love, one may sacrifice for it.

61
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:38,703
In the dark... all is ended.

62
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,441
Your mother...

63
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,575
Did I ask for cold water?

64
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,113
Have you ever seen me drinking cold water?

65
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:53,743
No.

66
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,612
Then why did you pour me cold water?

67
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,050
Behave yourself, this is police station.

68
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,121
So what?

69
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,350
I like to beat her, and she likes it.

70
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,357
So?

71
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:03,959
Do you like it?

72
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,687
Yes.

73
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,831
- Speak up.
- Yes.

74
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,295
- Louder.
- Yes, I like it.

75
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,764
Then go and get me water.

76
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,434
You're jealous I have lots of women?

77
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,938
Getting a statement.

78
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,539
- Let me finish it.
- Yes, Sir.

79
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,971
- Come here.
- Where?

80
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,634
- Over here.
- Come here right away.

81
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,840
Just questioning, no need to use a hammer?!

82
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,609
Questioning? After the beating.

83
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:27,683
Hold him, don't let him move.

84
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:28,843
Hey.

85
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:29,282
Wait.

86
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,218
What are you doing? Sit still!

87
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,983
Ah Tat...

88
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,320
This isn't right.

89
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,655
Have you questioned any suspect before?

90
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,457
No, but you'll be in trouble if you hurt him.

91
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,394
How would this hurt him?!

92
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,033
I'll put a phone book on this chest

93
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,259
and hammer on it.

94
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,801
Then there'll be no evidence.

95
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,700
Better don't make trouble at this time.

96
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:47,897
Any phone book?

97
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,041
How come there's no phone book in the station?

98
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,232
It seems I haven't bring along.

99
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,138
There is.

100
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,870
Put on his chest.

101
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,138
I really don't agree what you're doing.

102
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,077
Don't worry, it'll be alright.

103
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,342
Come, put it here.

104
00:06:58,985 --> 00:06:59,747
Count to three.

105
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,150
Sir, your phone book is so small. It'll kill me.

106
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,214
Open it.

107
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,614
Three

108
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,021
It'll kill me too.

109
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,185
Take your hand off, hold him.

110
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,294
Hold him.

111
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,863
It's not my fault, I'm forced to do so.

112
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:13,999
Three

113
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,027
Don't play around.

114
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,196
Hurry up.

115
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,997
Two...

116
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,734
Hey, wanna die?!

117
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,707
Release him, I wanna fight him man to man.

118
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,642
Don't.

119
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,679
Release him.

120
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,180
That's it, I don't care.

121
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,848
Hey, you fight him or me?

122
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,354
Fight him.

123
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,291
Sing.

124
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,094
What?

125
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,099
Relay.

126
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,294
Didn't you say man to man?

127
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,769
You're a man too.

128
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,065
I knew it.

129
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,684
Wrestling, man?

130
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,856
Relay... relay.

131
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,370
Sing... relay.

132
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,733
What a shame to know you.

133
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,170
Don't talk anymore, quick, come...

134
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,212
Hurry...

135
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,655
Hey, give me a cigarette.

136
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,657
No, it costs money.

137
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,556
Relay...

138
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,698
What?

139
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,797
Let's see.

140
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:54,933
You asked for it.

141
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,549
Why did you beat him?

142
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,247
Such a big man insulted a woman.

143
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,788
I hate those men who don't respect women.

144
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,186
You can report if you think I'm wrong.

145
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,827
I wanna report...
I'm beaten by the policemen...

146
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,828
Have your files been back?

147
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,162
No.

148
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,031
Mr., sorry, according to the procedure.

149
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,334
These two ain't policemen.

150
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,910
What? Then why did they beat me?

151
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,406
There's nothing wrong. We're reasonable.

152
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,348
If you wanna sue these two men,

153
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,253
I have to charge...

154
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,285
you three ganged fighting.

155
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,254
Interested?

156
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,589
Why did you let these two mad dogs beat me?

157
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,926
I have to report them.

158
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,891
I have to report you too.

159
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,697
Don't think that I wouldn't recognize you.

160
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:10,074
I remember you, short, fat and wrinkled.

161
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,443
Gee, my eyes.

162
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,046
I'm the top in this district.

163
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,307
If you wanna report, come to me.

164
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,641
Did anybody see I hurt his eyes?

165
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:19,443
Yes.

166
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,211
Then I'll take one more

167
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,313
and kick your bottom too.

168
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,320
See if anybody believe you?!

169
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:27,517
Let's go.

170
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,024
Yes, Madam.

171
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,091
Did anybody see I kick him?

172
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,388
Yes.

173
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,292
What about a short, fat and wrinkled me?

174
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,694
No.

175
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,026
Good!

176
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,402
Madam, it's a misunderstanding just now.

177
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,095
But...

178
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,036
I'm responsible for it.

179
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,809
I was happy to hit that guy.

180
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,138
If Madam thinks I'm wrong,

181
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,713
you can nail me anytime.

182
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:55,383
You two did very well
in the firearm case last month.

183
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,215
Yes, because.

184
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,881
That's nothing, it's our duty.

185
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:00,956
Nothing special.

186
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,290
Don't be so humble, what do you wanna do?

187
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,824
Which department is the most dangerous
in the police force?

188
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,560
Regional Crime Unit.

189
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,292
I wanna go there.

190
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,370
If you go there, what about me?

191
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,799
Then I'll go to the Transport Unit, right?

192
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,013
What have I done wrong?

193
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,140
Sigh... Hopeless.

194
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,899
Oh my god.

195
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,338
Turn it off, license, ID card.

196
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,066
Great trouble!

197
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,079
It's Brother Sing.

198
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,714
Don't be afraid.

199
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,510
You guys are getting more stupid.

200
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,713
Brother Sing, we'll be alright, right?

201
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,750
You guys are lucky.

202
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:45,822
It's me this time.

203
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:46,582
Be more careful.

204
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,453
We can go then?

205
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,490
Go...

206
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,255
Why did you degraded
to be a traffic policeman?

207
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,260
Yes...

208
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,391
Turn it off, license, ID card.

209
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,194
Don't joke around.

210
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,632
Ignore him.

211
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,297
I'm not joking.

212
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,409
Get of the car,
put both hands on your head.

213
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,106
Hold them tight.

214
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,147
I'm now charging you dangerous driving,
attempted murder.

215
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,009
I'm not the driver.

216
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,482
Shut up.

217
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,084
You have unlawful sexual intercourse
with a girl under 16.

218
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,416
I haven't.

219
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,287
Shut up! Look at it yourself.

220
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,788
Go...

221
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,569
Bastards, am I degraded?

222
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,171
It's called desertion.

223
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,404
Slow down.

224
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,686
Sing...

225
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,883
Tat.

226
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,929
Wow, in such a good mood for BBQ.

227
00:14:59,098 --> 00:14:59,587
Of course.

228
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,663
Give me a sausage.

229
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,891
There're more for me.

230
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,635
How's the uniform?

231
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,998
Good, colorful and comfortable.

232
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:08,867
- Really?
- Yes.

233
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,668
Then you wear it longer.

234
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,643
You should have made Madam happy.

235
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,040
She's lucky that I didn't beat her up.

236
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,739
Not like you, I don't date old woman.

237
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,178
Hey, it's not me who date her.

238
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,012
It's she that keeps following me.

239
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,751
I'll get her for sure.

240
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,752
Look at your ugly face.

241
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,556
I wonder what she likes about you.

242
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,822
She likes everything about me.

243
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,729
You're the No.
1 shooter in the SDU, aren't you?

244
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,096
Sir, the car's gone.

245
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,032
Oh, I'm going. I'm following a big case.

246
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,263
What case?

247
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,438
Big case.

248
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,550
Is there anybody from the other team?

249
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,849
I've got a hard band transmission.

250
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,717
We have company, gentlemen.

251
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:23,935
Is it the Urban Council
to clear the garbage?

252
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:25,734
Check it out.

253
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,281
Don't shoot, we're police too...

254
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,450
We've got an undercover up there.

255
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,600
Everybody's safe.

256
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,802
That's our undercover.

257
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,507
He's investigating a terrorist case
at an international school.

258
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,717
Those terrorists

259
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,250
have already exploded 2 schools in Britain.

260
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,045
They came to Hong Kong this time,
which school is the target?

261
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,518
We're still investigating.

262
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,522
Thank you Peter, your turn Lydia.

263
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,066
We haven't received any message about
the undercover from the Special Branch.

264
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,198
Do we have to inform you everything we do?

265
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,904
Peter, don't get mad. You both ain't wrong.

266
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,166
Little friend, what's your name?

267
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,676
Transport Unit, P.C. No.167,
Chow Sing-Sing, Sir.

268
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,148
Any backing?

269
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,512
Backing? No.

270
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:44,311
Good, then you can be
the scapegoat for the case.

271
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,787
Agree?

272
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,992
This is to make me a scapegoat.

273
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,288
Yes, it's a shame.

274
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,692
I shall beat him up.

275
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,594
Right.

276
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:55,892
You think so too?

277
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:56,557
Right...

278
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:57,702
I'll beat him up now.

279
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,895
Hey, be gentle.

280
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:00,561
Don't kill him.

281
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,001
It's hard to say, I can't control myself.

282
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:02,798
Don't use so much force.

283
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,839
I'm a strong man.

284
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:04,634
Yes, you're right.

285
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,141
Who can afford my punch?

286
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,073
I think there's no one.

287
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,508
Okay, I'll fight.

288
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,804
Hey, watch out for my Madam.

289
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,074
I'll beat whoever makes me a scapegoat.

290
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,080
- Yes...
- Am I right?

291
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,481
Yes, then hurry back for coffee.

292
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:15,650
Do you wanna go for a coffee?

293
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,412
Yes, coffee.

294
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,748
Then go for coffee first.

295
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,014
I tell you,

296
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,716
I'm not afraid of anything.

297
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,825
Whoever blame me, I'll beat him up.

298
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,535
Auntie, have a cup of tea.

299
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,301
Good boy.

300
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,173
Mom, don't force him.

301
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,713
When did I force him?

302
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,446
You say it, have I forced you?

303
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:52,985
You say it.

304
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,885
Theoretically, no.

305
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,419
Your mother wouldn't force him.

306
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:02,426
I'm talking to him. Don't interrupt.

307
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,159
Oh, yes.

308
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,429
Have you thought of getting married?

309
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:17,372
Under normal logical morality, yes.

310
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,909
What does that mean?

311
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,142
It means no.

312
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,184
It's because I've got no money.

313
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,016
No money? I don't believe.

314
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,125
You've got no money for working so long?

315
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,521
Are you joking?

316
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,722
The money needed for wedding dress,
cash gift, cakes,

317
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,630
banquet, honeymoon, new house,
and other things.

318
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,532
I couldn't afford it.

319
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,196
I heard policemen have
five hundred million income.

320
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,103
That's a long time ago.

321
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,937
It's not your business.

322
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:50,974
Five hundred million? Yes, I have it.

323
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,980
But I've spend it all on those.

324
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:58,389
What? Those worth five hundred million?

325
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,852
Yes, they do.

326
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:02,921
It's only paper.

327
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,119
Yes...

328
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,196
Right now, you just cost me
hundred and fifty million.

329
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,830
Is that too expensive?

330
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:10,961
Hey, you've got money.

331
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,262
Where?

332
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,428
This account, we own it.

333
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,731
I remember, each of us contributed $10.

334
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,173
It's worth more than $10 now.

335
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,903
$100,000? You've saved that much.

336
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,439
Hey, you've contributed too.
Don't you remember?

337
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,681
It's helpless. My daughter is like me.

338
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,755
You're lucky, get ready for the wedding.

339
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,892
Mom, don't worry. He'll manage it.

340
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,486
Okay.

341
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:53,670
Hey, Sing.

342
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,743
There's some important matters
you've got to help.

343
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,382
Special Branch and Regional Crime Unit
are cooperating for the first time.

344
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,484
I'll be exposed this time.

345
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,641
As a prostitute?

346
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,479
No.

347
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,712
Then why exposed?

348
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,554
No. I mean I'll be visible.

349
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:07,825
How should I say it?

350
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,789
Be extraordinary.

351
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,949
Yes... extraordinary.

352
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,117
That's what I've just said, right?

353
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,263
Yes, then what?

354
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,628
All these English I know,
but not understand.

355
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,029
You explain to me.

356
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,936
I see, this is about...

357
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,075
- Hum...
- What?

358
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,607
- Is it true...
- Hum...

359
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,074
- What?
- What's the matter?

360
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,213
Madam, please think twice.

361
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,882
I believe about this case, besides me.

362
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,642
You shouldn't find
another person to do it.

363
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,647
Tat is our best.

364
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,823
He'll finish the job with no problem.

365
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,016
Say it yourself, are you able?

366
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,355
Well, let me tell you
those terrorists are crazy.

367
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,461
Don't pretend, say it.

368
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,689
I know... The report is very detailed.

369
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,697
This case is very dangerous,

370
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,962
but I'm not afraid all along.

371
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,038
Don't overestimate yourself.

372
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:02,076
Your superior told me you're
not suitable for traffic.

373
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,544
I've considered to transfer
you to Tung Lung Island.

374
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,216
That's an deserted island.

375
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,512
Yes, there's no traffic.

376
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,615
Wow, then you'll be very comfortable,
congratulations.

377
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,162
Those junior grade people, please go out.
We're having a meeting.

378
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,492
Sorry, I'm not junior.

379
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,670
Actually, I'm not part of the police force.

380
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,967
I resign.

381
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,370
River flows to the east.

382
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,544
The younger generation has
no cultivation nowadays.

383
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,178
We're lucky to have you.

384
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:46,247
Don't be so loud. People will be jealous.

385
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,685
Sorry.

386
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,402
Sing... I've found you several jobs.

387
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,664
You listen.

388
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,606
The electronics factory's vacancy

389
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,178
with high salary, good benefit
and transportation is provided.

390
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,441
Not suitable?

391
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:17,121
How about this... as a watchman?

392
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,484
It'll fit you. They provide uniform.

393
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,319
No?

394
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:26,960
Hey, this one will do. A movie company
is looking for a leading actor.

395
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,895
No bad habits, young,

396
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,501
strong and good-looking.

397
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,099
Hey, everything fits you.

398
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,001
Is it?

399
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,575
But, there's a little incompatibility.

400
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:40,642
What?

401
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:44,313
They're looking for
a dog to do a love story.

402
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,345
Just a little difference.
Doesn't hurt to try.

403
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,491
You're not thinking you're worse than a dog?

404
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,817
Not that bad!

405
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,764
Sing, you've got to have a plan.

406
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,058
You're still young.
Don't destroy yourself?

407
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,531
No matter what, I've decided.

408
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,636
What? If it's business, count me in.

409
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:06,793
Doing what I do best.

410
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,202
Right, the dog leading role
is suitable for you.

411
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,307
Undercover at school.

412
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,144
I have to go back to school
as a undercover.

413
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,050
I have to go back to school
as a undercover.

414
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,754
I need a few assistants.

415
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:33,192
They have to be strong, fast and smart.

416
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,231
That's why I find you guys.

417
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,400
No.

418
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,866
You're fooling us.

419
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,061
How do you know?

420
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,068
We're not as

421
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,230
what you've described.

422
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,467
Don't think we're stupid.

423
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:46,372
That's right.

424
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,035
We're stupid, but not a fool.

425
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,475
Won't be fooled by you so easily.

426
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,373
No way.

427
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,073
No way... No.

428
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,547
How much money you want? Say it.

429
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,707
$15,000

430
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,682
Each one $15,000.

431
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:56,843
On a monthly basis.

432
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,649
Hong Kong dollar, not Yen.

433
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,717
Deal.

434
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,984
Thank you boss...

435
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,751
Let's eat...

436
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,395
Let's go together.

437
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,996
I don't understand why you have to do it.

438
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,028
That's right.

439
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:11,225
Because I wanna tell them,
I'm the No. 1 in the SDU.

440
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:15,428
Last time the firearm case, I was the best.

441
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,468
I should have been the
Chief Superintendent or Chief Inspector.

442
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,544
It shouldn't be
in Transport Unit P.C., No. 167.

443
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:22,743
You understand?

444
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,505
I do.

445
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,115
You're lying.

446
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,145
You're stupid, how would you understand?

447
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:33,118
Sing, I'm not stupid.

448
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,524
If the British Government, within a week,

449
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,993
that is before the coming
Christmas Eve midnight,

450
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,894
doesn't release the head of the terrorists.

451
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,295
They'll make trouble

452
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,868
in one of the school in HK.

453
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,572
Sing, why is Hong Kong involved
with the British Government?

454
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,297
Right.

455
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,702
Do you have a holiday
on the Queen's Birthday?

456
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,432
Yes.

457
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,269
Then you're involved.

458
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:52,967
That's right.

459
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,509
But there's so many schools.

460
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,078
How do we know which one?

461
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,708
I've analyzed.

462
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,577
The undercover just died,

463
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,879
is working in
the Adam Smith International School

464
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,382
and those studying in this school

465
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,492
are the children of the ambassadors.

466
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,093
If I were the terrorists,

467
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,558
I'll make trouble there.

468
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,924
But what if you're wrong?

469
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,565
Then I'll beat you up.

470
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:15,791
Is it real?

471
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,867
As real as the 999 real gold.

472
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,231
Now you guys get ready, I'll go apply.

473
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:24,466
Sing, don't guess wrong.

474
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,007
Excuse me, is Principal Kim here?

475
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,306
Is it Manager Kim?

476
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,711
It's Principal, not Manager.

477
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,943
It's the same.
The first one on the left ahead.

478
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,017
Is it Principal Kim?

479
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,849
Come in.

480
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,487
I've got customer. Talk to you later.

481
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:44,986
Hello...

482
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,255
What can I do for you?

483
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,728
I wanna apply for school.

484
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:48,796
Which one?

485
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,492
Adam Smith International School.

486
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:53,799
Which grade?

487
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,633
Form 6, four of us.

488
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,142
There're seats available. I'll arrange it.

489
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,743
Chow Sing-Sing, how old are you?

490
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,374
18 years old.

491
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,651
Really? You look like at least 28.

492
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,681
Is it real?

493
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,049
No matter what age you are.

494
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,951
Don't underestimate yourself.

495
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,820
If you're willing to learn, we'll teach.

496
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,183
That's good.

497
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,628
The tuition fee is $4,000 each,
$16,000 for four.

498
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,860
And books fee, each is $3,600.

499
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,766
Sport uniform fee, each is $2,800.

500
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,837
The total is $41,600.

501
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,669
Thank you, boss.

502
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,887
Hey...

503
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,050
What are you doing here?

504
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,856
Studying.

505
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,724
Where's the office, Mr?

506
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,202
Are you serious?

507
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,836
Say thank you.

508
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,704
Thank you, Mr.

509
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,274
Mr. Bond would see you later.

510
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,612
Wonder whether the head of
discipline is bad or not?

511
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,775
Can't be worse than Mr. Lam
in the previous school?

512
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,046
Idiot, we pay to come here, right? Sing?

513
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,406
It's Uncle Tat.

514
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:17,309
No, call me Bond, James Bond.

515
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,681
You're James Bond, then I'm Batman.

516
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,549
Listen, I'm your head of discipline,
James Bond.

517
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,487
Not Batman, or Superman.

518
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,715
And also not Uncle Tat.

519
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,121
Come... Hit me if you dare.

520
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,819
Those guys from Special Branch
are watching us outside.

521
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,231
I don't care, I come here for study.

522
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,958
You're the head of discipline,
you can't hit people without reason.

523
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,033
Not hit people.

524
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,568
The order is to hit you only.

525
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,433
Come, let me hit you and finish the job.

526
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,040
I'll treat you a meal.

527
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,268
Am I stupid? How can I eat after you hit me?

528
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,605
Don't worry, I'll be gentle on you.

529
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,847
If it hurts you, you can fight back.

530
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:51,845
- Then it's okay.
- Come.

531
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,711
No need for a meal, cash $1000.

532
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,216
- $500
- $800

533
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,546
Deal.

534
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,051
Wow, are they enemies?

535
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,856
Hey, you earn $800 from me.

536
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,793
Can you treat me for dinner?

537
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,227
I'll treat you a banana.

538
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,391
Why are you such a miser?

539
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,333
Hey, it's so dull to be
just left and right.

540
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:15,870
I'm so tired.

541
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,337
I'm not tired,
and you've already complained?

542
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,976
My neck is tired from all these turning.

543
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,778
Any other style?

544
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,045
Yes.

545
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,618
Why is there a rod?

546
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,222
Sing, are you alright?

547
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,085
Yes.

548
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:34,953
What about now?

549
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,821
Looking for a chance to beat him up.

550
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,190
No, I mean what's the next step?

551
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,991
The next is to collect
information on this school.

552
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:45,233
I wanna know what Mike

553
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,961
has done in this school before.

554
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,169
I see, we'll go then.

555
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:50,596
Where are you going?

556
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,898
That way.

557
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:52,938
For what?

558
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,373
None of your business.

559
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,671
What kind of manner is this?

560
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,783
Sing, where are we going anyway?

561
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,785
Anywhere can do.

562
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,487
Fool around? Kid.

563
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,423
Are you finished?

564
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,556
Almost, Sing, be patient.

565
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:10,694
Hurry up.

566
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,624
Sorry, man.

567
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,163
It's Miss.

568
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,035
I don't know if you didn't tell me.

569
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,434
And you know now.

570
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:25,831
Not really.

571
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:27,903
Apologize.

572
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:44,721
Apologize...

573
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,658
Sorry miss.

574
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,097
Is it done?

575
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,670
- Sing...
- Go.

576
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,333
Sing, we haven't found our room yet.

577
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,704
Ask someone.

578
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,075
This one must be a girl.

579
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,943
Hey, sister, where's the classroom?

580
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,223
Sweetie, would you
tell me where's Room 507?

581
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,291
- Downstairs.
- Thank you.

582
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,996
This novel isn't suitable for you.

583
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,001
The story is romantic and terrifying.

584
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,364
But the main leads are dead at the end.
Such a tragedy.

585
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,368
Too gloomy.

586
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,938
You should read something delightful.

587
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,166
Delightful?

588
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,402
Yes, such as Yik Shu's "Spring Dream".

589
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,012
Tsukasa Hojo's "City Hunter".

590
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,977
Akira Toriyama's "Doctor IQ".

591
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,306
Jademan's "Oriental Heroes".

592
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,419
I think they're all suitable for you.

593
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,286
Sing, don't know that you're
an expert of literature.

594
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,652
You're great.

595
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,418
Don't understand why did
people say you're senseless.

596
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,357
Yes.

597
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,326
- And not fair.
- It's unreasonable.

598
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:56,058
Sing, I've just got a hanger-on.

599
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,095
You?

600
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,530
Yes, I'm surprise too.

601
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,800
Say big brother.

602
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:00,596
Big brother.

603
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,796
Hello, how are you?

604
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,133
How much do you want? Big brother.

605
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,103
How much of what?

606
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,742
Every big brother asks for money.

607
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,639
What does it mean?

608
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,138
Albert joins all the clubs in school

609
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,043
from school club to gang club

610
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,877
and he pays all the fees.

611
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,486
Is there any triad here?

612
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,246
Yes.

613
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,288
That one belongs to gang B.

614
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,187
He's black, not necessary
be a triad member.

615
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,885
Black people has a triad too.

616
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,190
That one belongs to gang C.

617
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,463
C?!

618
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:29,691
C for Ca Li Fra Ga

619
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,425
Lis Tic Ex Pe Ala Docious.

620
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:32,868
I see.

621
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,169
In fact, I just wanna
ask you about one person.

622
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,238
Follow me.

623
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,873
Pay for it.

624
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:41,508
Thirty dollars.

625
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,544
Make it cheaper, we're friends.

626
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,279
Forget it...

627
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,583
- Sweet Potato.
- Yes.

628
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:48,980
Is it done?

629
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,745
I've already found some informers, Sing.

630
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,082
Absolutely no problem.

631
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,861
I have paid for it.

632
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,365
Sister.

633
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,102
Sweetheart.

634
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,246
Do you want some?

635
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,054
Ten dollar one stick.

636
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,055
Good taste.

637
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,022
Reckless.

638
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,060
Isn't it good? We can do anything.

639
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,028
Or is it better to be in a jail?

640
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,059
- It's really No. 2.
- What No. 2?

641
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,065
No. 2 of the 5th race.

642
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,203
Hey, the 6th race will soon begin.

643
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,860
Are you interested in my banker?
10% discount.

644
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,872
No? Stocks? Gold, options, currencies.

645
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,439
Hey, the Yen is appreciating.
How about it?

646
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,874
No? Women? Different nationalities,

647
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,409
18-year-old.

648
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,910
No? Men? Animal? Dog?

649
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,307
Mouse?

650
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,253
Excuse me.

651
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,326
Hi, Sir, nice haircut.

652
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,265
Sir, the book is for you. How is it?

653
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:16,931
It's good.

654
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,874
Read it carefully, really something good.

655
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,174
I don't watch football.

656
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,510
Why don't we take attendance first?

657
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,563
Sandy Lai.

658
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,035
Sandy...

659
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:55,737
I'm here.

660
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:01,312
And this one... is a new student.

661
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,884
Stephen Chow.

662
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,246
Here...

663
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,286
It's Chow.

664
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,355
Here...

665
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,187
Mr. Chow, welcome to the class.

666
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,895
Matthew, chapter 27.

667
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:17,263
At this time, when Judas,
the betrayer of Jesus

668
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:23,033
saw that Jesus would be nailed, he repented.

669
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:32,682
Play Mahjong.

670
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,112
Good, how much?

671
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,280
What are you doing?

672
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,081
Goodbye, Sir. Play mahjong.

673
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:43,625
Your punishment is to copy
the Old arid New Testament once.

674
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,026
What? Why so serious?

675
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,563
Didn't you say play mahjong?

676
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,259
Few years later, the Bible is so thick.

677
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,094
You don't even think of playing mahjong

678
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,671
for these 2 years.

679
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,201
It can't be?!

680
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,173
Returning to the repentant Judas.

681
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,247
He put $30 in the church.

682
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,309
Then left, and hanged himself.

683
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,953
What depressed him so much to end his life?

684
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:16,189
Do you think what Judas
who betrayed Christ is a good man?

685
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,059
He's alright.

686
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,566
If he did not betrayed Christ,
then Christ would not be nailed to the cross,

687
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:27,431
then you won't have a cross on your neck.

688
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,469
You'll be unemployed, fear?

689
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,977
The betrayal is arranged by God.

690
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,909
That means... God purposely cheated Judas.

691
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,750
God, please forgive my violence.

692
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,112
Please show me how to save this student.

693
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,822
Sing, it's reckless here.

694
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,463
You can do whatever you want.

695
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,232
What? Do you wanna copy the Bible?

696
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,232
It's nothing.

697
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,234
I don't care if God saves my soul.

698
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,396
Right now, I wanna beat you.

699
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,942
Sing, you're great. Your fighting is good.

700
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,411
But I've sensed something bad is coming.

701
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:31,527
You shouldn't have insulted Minister Wong.

702
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,466
He's the most powerful in the school even
bigger than me and the Principal.

703
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,538
He can kick you out anytime.

704
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,901
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

705
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,671
I forgot.

706
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,543
Go...

707
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,244
See how you can beat me up.

708
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:48,777
Go!

709
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,780
You're something, Head of Discipline.

710
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,080
Of course, don't run.

711
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:55,623
Head of Discipline.

712
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,124
What?

713
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:01,492
I wanna ask you something in the washroom.

714
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,092
Why have to be in the washroom?

715
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,063
Only takes you a second.

716
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,099
Why not here?

717
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,566
Washroom is better.

718
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,762
Don't go away, Head of discipline.

719
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,175
It's the school regulation.
I don't wanna beat you.

720
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,680
Come on, I ain't that stingy.

721
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,882
I haven't killed you right?
I ain't angry at all.

722
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:26,511
Yes... It's very kind of you not to kill me.
Thanks a lot...

723
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,659
I'm always good for you.
Worth treating me a meal right?

724
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,852
Sure...

725
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:33,322
Can you bring

726
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,864
some dim sum to me too?

727
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,393
That guy is weird, what's he doing here?

728
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,363
Don't care about him.

729
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,000
As long as he doesn't intervene
with what we're doing.

730
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,969
Most important isn't letting
him get close to Sandy.

731
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,022
Sir, I really won't do it next time.

732
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,124
You fool, see if you dare
to do it next time.

733
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,388
Yes, but can you be gentle next time?

734
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,963
You won't be scared if I'm gentle.

735
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:08,860
That's right.

736
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:09,692
Go back to the classroom.

737
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,266
Thank you, Sir.

738
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,904
Is Sandy really involved?

739
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,260
Brother Sing, you're really great just now.

740
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,597
Personal show of the ball trick.

741
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,330
It really amazes all of us.

742
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,031
- Am I that good?
- Very good.

743
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,175
It's the top.

744
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:00,537
Did any girls yell?

745
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:01,973
Not only yell, some moan.

746
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,511
- Who?
- Them.

747
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:08,349
Brother Sing, remember you can
just catch the brush before.

748
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,885
Now you've already attain such
level with the ball

749
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,024
and also play it with such style,
you're great.

750
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:15,822
I can catch not only the brush now.

751
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:16,652
Then what?

752
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:17,691
I can even catch bullets.

753
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,658
Wow, you've got to perform a show.

754
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,320
There's chances. Just be patient.

755
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,261
Then I'll wait for you.

756
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,159
The Special Branch has already
put their people here.

757
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,634
That proves I'm right.

758
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,000
There's something going on in this school.

759
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,802
Good, I don't have to be beaten.

760
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:34,705
What're you doing? Any information?

761
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,240
No, thinking of my girlfriend.

762
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:37,175
Me too.

763
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,713
What? Is it time to go now?

764
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,110
Go home and do the homework.

765
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,253
Chow Sing-Sing, the Special Branch
invites you for coffee.

766
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,547
Big Brother... I wanna go too.

767
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,058
What're you doing in the school.

768
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,054
I've said before we're there to study.

769
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,254
Sir.

770
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:55,557
Teacher?

771
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,098
Which subject are you teaching?

772
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:01,498
You must be teaching Shit, no, History.

773
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,498
I warn you guys.
Don't follow him to school.

774
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:05,937
Or else, I'll lock you up.

775
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,407
What?

776
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,172
What can I do except study?
I'm a student only.

777
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,808
Yes, you can't stop people from studying.

778
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,915
Chow Sing-Sing isn't our man anymore.

779
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,075
Is it right, Tat?

780
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,814
Are you scared of him?

781
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,724
No, not me!

782
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,916
Listen, study hard.

783
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,891
No more investigations
and no fooling around.

784
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,325
Not to beat the Head of Discipline.

785
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,657
Yes Sir!

786
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,925
Get out.

787
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:35,929
Goodbye, Sir.

788
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:39,971
Thank you, Sir.

789
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,577
Dismiss.

790
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:48,241
If there's anything went wrong,
you're responsible.

791
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,146
Let's go.

792
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,351
Did you arrange that?

793
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:01,263
Can you not ask what I'm up to?

794
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:04,624
Yes, I'll trust you then.

795
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,027
Are you alright with your face?

796
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,800
Shut up.

797
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,053
Roger.

798
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,521
Why it doesn't work?

799
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,918
Anyway, the informer said
they're here. Move in.

800
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,023
Okay.

801
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:36,927
How come no one's here?

802
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,830
Be careful, they must be here.

803
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,649
Alright, we do it as planned.

804
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,655
The target is
Adam Smith International School.

805
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:03,952
But the cops are already at the school.

806
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,255
Cops? So you're afraid of cops.

807
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,759
Now? Let's go to teach them a lesson.

808
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,860
Sing, this guy knows our identity.

809
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:15,766
We're in danger. How about...

810
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,941
Please don't kill me.

811
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,209
If our secret spread out...

812
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:28,245
No, I've already joined you guys.

813
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,346
Finish the homework
if you wanna get out of trouble.

814
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,750
It's done.

815
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,648
Sing, where's your Hi-Fi?

816
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,290
Sold it already.

817
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,689
Up-grade?

818
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,156
No money, you guys already
spent my $100,000.

819
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,559
I have to sell it.

820
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,373
Brother Sing, don't be worried.

821
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,268
I'll introduce you to a loan shark.

822
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,271
Who?

823
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:58,303
Sing, it's 6 o'clock, I'll charge you
overtime if we're not dismissed.

824
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,451
Dismiss.

825
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,756
Miss Ho, long time no see.

826
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,186
Yes.

827
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,518
Well, talk to you later. We're off.

828
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:10,216
Off?

829
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,725
Bye-bye.

830
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,520
Bye-bye.

831
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,367
Ming.

832
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:19,865
Hey, they said they're off.

833
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:21,334
Yes, just came to fix the plumbing.

834
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,369
Plumbing?

835
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,734
They're learning to be plumber.

836
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,572
My hair's getting long.

837
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:28,768
No problem, sit down.

838
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:29,605
Thank you.

839
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,872
Mr., how many of you?

840
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,137
One.

841
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,616
Have you reserved for the wedding banquet?

842
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,046
Yes.

843
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,353
Where's the Hi-Fi?

844
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:42,890
There's no need, isn't it?

845
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,328
I've got you. It's the same.

846
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:48,958
What're you talking about?

847
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,225
That means your singing
is better than a Hi-Fi.

848
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,733
I've made a appointment
with a realtor tomorrow.

849
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,634
Remember to bring the cheque book.

850
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,605
You wanna make a deposit?
Don't be this hurry.

851
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,203
What? You've got no money?

852
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,211
No, whatever you gave me
last time I've got them.

853
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:06,978
But then, if you make the deposit,

854
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,708
that means you have to pay the mortgage.

855
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:12,150
Yes, you can apply for civil allowance.

856
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,880
There's no more.

857
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,519
Why not?

858
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,985
I'm an undercover.

859
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,555
Undercover? You said you're promoted?

860
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:22,856
Yes, still an undercover.

861
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,127
I'm a commander of the undercovers.

862
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,401
Not anyone can take this post.

863
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,268
You should be happy for me, are you?

864
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,237
Smile then.

865
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,473
Will it delay our wedding?

866
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:39,341
It'd better not

867
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,650
or else I'll lose my life.

868
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,081
What're you doing?

869
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:46,613
Nothing.

870
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:47,888
Keep going.

871
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:48,953
More?

872
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,058
Yes.

873
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,524
You said so...

874
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,356
Come on, hurry.

875
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,529
Today, I'll teach you judo.

876
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:07,600
To be good,
the waist is the most important.

877
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:15,980
Besides, the feet as well.

878
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,243
Come on, hurry.

879
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:21,422
See it?

880
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,853
In fact, judo is dynamic.

881
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:36,604
Sandy, come demonstrate with him.

882
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:37,432
Yes.

883
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,507
Sir, she's a girl.

884
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,210
I purposely pick the smallest one.

885
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:44,404
The others will kill you.

886
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,248
Ready.

887
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:19,608
Cut.

888
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,717
Why are you dancing Cha Cha? Fight!

889
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,707
Thank you...

890
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,886
Alright, get even then.

891
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,417
You're done with the shower?

892
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,259
You've played judo?

893
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:06,487
No.

894
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,027
Why you took a shower?

895
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,027
We're partner.

896
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,379
Sandy isn't related to this case.

897
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,146
Sandy?!

898
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,580
I don't understand, I'm just a student.

899
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,284
Then you shouldn't talk
about dating girls.

900
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:38,559
No.

901
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,161
Then did the girls date you?

902
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:41,789
Look at your own face.

903
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,762
Your side and your head.

904
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,299
Which part will

905
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,699
the girls love?

906
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:49,800
No.

907
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:50,905
That's it.

908
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,042
You've got it, give me ten.

909
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:55,611
I've got it, give me five.

910
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,042
If it is, it's only Sandy.

911
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,014
Why are you kissing?

912
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,127
But not letting me in?

913
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,667
Next time.

914
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,468
Don't touch her anymore.

915
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,142
Give me some hair conditioner.

916
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,036
Thank you.

917
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:32,181
Don't say thank you, say thanks is okay.

918
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:34,240
Thanks.

919
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:35,877
Brother...

920
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,859
Do you know that girl with short hair?

921
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,121
Which one?

922
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:48,730
The one with the comic book

923
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,924
who looks wild

924
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,035
That's Jacky, Sandy's sister.

925
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,396
Everyone's afraid of her.
