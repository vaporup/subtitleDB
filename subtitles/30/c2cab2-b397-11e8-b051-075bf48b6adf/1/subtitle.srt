1
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,078
(Muslim call to prayer)

2
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,951
(Pink Panther theme)

3
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,511
(wolf whistle)

4
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,910
He's going in.

5
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,991
(Italian opera)

6
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,638
Ah, Inspector!

7
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,915
Chief Inspector.

8
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,309
Chief Inspector. Hail to the chief!

9
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,439
Good to see you. Your disguise
is ready for the final fitting.

10
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,511
- I'm sure you will be pleased.
- Good.

11
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,036
- Inspector Clouseau is here!
- Chief Inspector Clouseau.

12
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,155
Chief!

13
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,437
I saw some very interesting noses there.

14
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,355
Those noses over there are for amateurs.
I have some in my private stuff.

15
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,797
Yes! You always did have
a nose for noses.

16
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,273
Our Valentine's Day stuff isn't ready yet,
but we have some beauties here for you.

17
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,636
Let's try this one first.
Here's a marvellous one.

18
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,711
Inspector?

19
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,514
Shall we just get that on there?

20
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,591
What do you think of this?

21
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,994
I call this one "The Way We Were".
Do you like it? It's from our Streisand line.

22
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,310
- Do you like it?
- Mm...

23
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,872
No, I don't like it either.
Sorry, I almost took your nose with that.

24
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,309
Let's try this one now.
I think you will like this one very much.

25
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,517
It's very suitable for your face.
It fits in with your lines.

26
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,795
What do you think of that?

27
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,917
We call this one "Wino and Roses".

28
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,873
The veins are quite lifelike.
Don't you agree?

29
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,512
I am particularly proud of
the enlarged pores. Look at this one here.

30
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,870
I wasn't crazy about it either.
We'll try something else.

31
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,758
Something's missing? How about that?

32
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,953
- That's very nice, isn't it?
- That is a nose.

33
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,508
You have a nose for noses.

34
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,989
I always can tell
immediately I see the nose.

35
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,755
- We call this one our "Inky Dinky Doo".
- "Inky Dinky Doo"?

36
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,673
What do you have to go with this?

37
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,514
This will keep you very warm.
This has a nice effect with that nose.

38
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,068
- That is too legal.
- Too legal?

39
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,118
I want something that is... how can I say?

40
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,953
Leave it to Dr Balls.

41
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,430
Auguste! Look what you have done.

42
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,432
You're a genius.

43
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,988
Wait. Something is missing.

44
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,438
Yes. I know what's missing.
Here are some teeth... on the house.

45
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,511
Let me see how they look.

46
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,353
- Perfect!
- Look at this.

47
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,468
You are a genius at your art.
My dear boy.

48
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,510
He's still inside. What do you want
us to do when he comes out?

49
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,079
(man) Follow him.

50
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,909
Martha! Come and wrap
the chief inspector's purchase, please.

51
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,991
(woman coughs)

52
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,639
I've recently been doing
something very daring in a stump.

53
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,076
Arm and leg.
Only 900 francs for the complete kit.

54
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:13,350
Yes. It has been my experience that, in an
emergency, a stump can get in the way.

55
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,069
Martha, you remember
Chief Inspector Clouseau?

56
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,668
I never set eyes on zis gentleman before.

57
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,594
Good evening, Martha.

58
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,760
I cannot believe my eyes!

59
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,469
That is because your husband
is a genius, madame. A genius!

60
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,588
Wrap these up, if you would, please.
And I want that nose to go with it.

61
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,634
- Impossible.
- Money is no object.

62
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,713
That is absolutely the ugliest nose
I have ever seen in my life.

63
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,998
It is so revolting. It is a masterpiece.

64
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,909
It is also Martha's own nose.

65
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,913
My compliments, madame. It suits you.

66
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,794
Thank you, Chief Inspector.

67
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,871
Thank you!

68
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,876
I will get your bill.

69
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,231
(blows raspberry)

70
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,555
(fanfare)

71
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,751
(Martha sighs)

72
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,598
My God, Auguste, what have you done?

73
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,514
The left heel, cleverly built up,
which gives added height and authority.

74
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,070
Ja? But the real secret
is in the right heel.

75
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,278
The lifelike club-foot look
is caused by a built-in spring

76
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,876
which digs into the ankle,
causing excruciating pain.

77
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,919
- Very realistic, don't you think?
- How soon can I have a pair?

78
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,470
I can have them ready for you
by Wednesday.

79
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,952
Again, Auguste, my sincere thanks.
And to you, madame.

80
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,318
Do you like the hand?
I'll pack them up with the shoes.

81
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,439
It will come in handy for scratching,
in case you have any hand jobs.

82
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,513
- We will see you soon, Inspector.
- Chief Inspector.

83
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,591
Goodbye. We'll see you soon.

84
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,271
Oh, my God!

85
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,036
I can't stand!

86
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,156
I've never been in such pain.

87
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,630
Shall I kiss it and make it better?

88
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,711
It's not that bad.

89
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,596
For the third time
in the memory of modern man,

90
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,515
the world's largest cut diamond,
the famous Pink Panther, has been stolen.

91
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,593
Since the reign of Akbar the Magnificent
in the early 12th century,

92
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,716
until the recent bloodless coup

93
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,236
of the former Colonel,
now President Sandover Haleesh,

94
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,677
the Pink Panther has been
the symbol of continuity of the Kurfilli,

95
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,116
the ruling family of the tiny
Middle East nation of Lugash.

96
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,634
(buzzer)

97
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,950
- Yes?
- Chief Inspector Dreyfus.

98
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,031
Send him right in.

99
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,628
I came when I got your message,
Commissioner.

100
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,711
I commend your promptness.

101
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,236
- You have heard of the theft in Lugash?
- The Pink Panther?

102
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,790
Yes, of course. It is in all the papers.

103
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,519
Soon, I imagine, they will be
sending us a request

104
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,830
for assistance in catching the criminals.

105
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,675
I have already received such a request
from the president of Lugash personally.

106
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,877
I see. How many men
did the president ask for?

107
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,236
Only one. Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

108
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,157
Clouseau?

109
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,391
- See that he's on the next plane.
- Of course.

110
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,675
But, um... Commissioner.

111
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,117
Don't you think that someone more...
conventional would, uh...

112
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,636
Not to take anything away
from Clouseau, you understand,

113
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,110
but in view of the tense
situation in the Middle East...

114
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,829
I am aware of the tense situation
between you and Clouseau.

115
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,357
However, Lugash has requested
Clouseau, and Clouseau they will have.

116
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,431
Your finger is in my ink.

117
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,509
Hm!

118
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,911
Mm-hm.

119
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,398
Merde!

120
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,197
(coughing)

121
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,715
(Clouseau) Ow!

122
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,870
What's he doing in there?

123
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,072
Hello.

124
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,515
Nice weather we're having.

125
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,750
I had hoped we'd finally laid to rest
your obsession with Inspector Clouseau.

126
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,400
So had I, Doctor. So had I.

127
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,232
And something has happened
to bring on this relapse?

128
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,311
No, not something.

129
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,119
Someone. The one.

130
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,510
No. No, perhaps you're right.

131
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,070
Some thing. He is a thing.

132
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,709
- Clouseau?
- Yes! Clouseau!

133
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,998
And your compulsion to kill Clouseau,
is it also back?

134
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,878
Oh, yes. Right back.

135
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,748
The thought of a world without Clouseau
fills me with delight.

136
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,310
Like a summer with a thousand Julys.

137
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,029
It intoxicates my soul with, uh...

138
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,509
- Your eyes.
- What?

139
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,229
"Intoxicates my soul with your eyes."

140
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,029
You've just lapsed into the lyrics
of "You Go to My Head".

141
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,432
- I did? I apologise.
- Never apologise for Cole Porter.

142
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,878
Besides, your subconscious has just
confirmed what we already know.

143
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,794
- That Clouseau has got into my head.
- Precisely.

144
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,591
Now, how do you suppose
you are going to get him out of there?

145
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,671
I don't know. I don't suppose.

146
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,957
You are supposed to suppose
and give me all the answers.

147
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,874
The commissioner wants him in Lugash.
Let the commissioner handle it!

148
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,428
I don't want to know.
I don't want to be there.

149
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,592
I want to be here with you.
(whimpers)

150
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,830
What are you thinking, Doctor?

151
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,388
It wasn't Cole Porter.

152
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,869
It was Gillespie and Coots.

153
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,951
(whimpers)

154
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,591
(phone rings)

155
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,433
- Yes?
- The deputy commissioner to see you.

156
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,477
The commissioner?
Send him in immediately.

157
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,355
Come in, Commissioner.

158
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,670
I want to discuss
the Pink Panther robbery.

159
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,551
I am at your service, Commissioner.
Allow me to offer you a small cigar.

160
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,190
Pay no attention to them whatsoever.
Let them just roll.

161
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,669
Read this carefully
and give me your opinion.

162
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,390
I will read my opinion
and give you yours most carefully.

163
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,471
Yes.

164
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,234
- Do you have a light?
- Yes, in the top left-hand drawer.

165
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,548
Aagh!

166
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,839
Agh!

167
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,311
Agh!

168
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,593
I'm dancing in the rice

169
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,399
Just dancing in the rice

170
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,709
What a wonderful feeling

171
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,079
I'm... happy in the rice

172
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,119
Always happy...

173
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,351
Oh, allow me.

174
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,868
(pumping)

175
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,110
(clears throat)

176
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,589
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

177
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,877
Clouseau called.
He wants me to take him to the airport.

178
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,353
Then take him. Let the president of
Lugash worry about his blood pressure.

179
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,238
- He's not going to Lugash.
- What?

180
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,357
- He's taking the 12.15 flight to London.
- To London?

181
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,557
He suspects the Phantom to be
responsible for the robbery.

182
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,200
He said that since Sir Charles
lives in England...

183
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,070
- Sir Charles lives in the South of France.
- Yes, sir. Shall I tell him?

184
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,589
Don't bother.
He would just say "I know that."

185
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,274
Trying to talk sense to Clouseau

186
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,229
is like Einstein trying
to explain relativity to a "minkey".

187
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,317
Does Sir Charles know you're coming?

188
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,471
No, I want it to remain a surprise.

189
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,557
- Merde.
- What's wrong?

190
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,599
Your pop-out lighter is refusing to pop out.

191
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,276
It's supposed to pop out
when it reaches a specific temperature.

192
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,433
What exactly is this specific temperature?

193
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,873
I don't know.

194
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,397
You should have checked with the factory.
It is obvious that this pop-out lighter

195
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,794
has reached its specific pop-out
temperature and is refusing to pop out.

196
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,270
The first rule for the car-owner -
know your automobile.

197
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,796
- But it is your automobile.
- I know that!

198
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,110
But it is not my pop-out lighter.

199
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,799
If it were my pop-out lighter, I would
know the specific pop-out temperature.

200
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,159
Clouseau was trying to fix the lighter.

201
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,708
He is sure that someone
planted a bomb in the car.

202
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,112
Yes. Someone should have...
I mean, could have done that.

203
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,749
He wired Scotland Yard
and said he was arriving in disguise.

204
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,831
Disguise?

205
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,837
What kind of disguise?
Disguised as what?

206
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,750
He didn't say.

207
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,116
How are we gonna tell
how to look for him?

208
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,951
Grazie.

209
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,748
This is your captain speaking.

210
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,513
Please return to your seat
and fasten your seat belt

211
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,114
as there is turbulence ahead.
Thank you.

212
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,359
Whoa!

213
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,358
- Morning, sir. Good trip?
- Yes. Thank you.

214
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,278
Can I help you?

215
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,151
Idiot!

216
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,232
Inspector Clouseau.
I'm Drummond from Scotland Yard.

217
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,996
I am André Botot,
mustard salesman from Dijon.

218
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,232
Oh...

219
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,438
- Can I give you a lift, Monsieur Botot?
- That would be very kind of you, Mr Yard.

220
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,353
- Drummond.
- Yes. How is Scotland these days?

221
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,317
- Pardon?
- Scotland.

222
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,598
I've some relations
who are from Scotland.

223
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,878
My grandmother on my father's side.
I'm quite fluent in the Gaelic, you know.

224
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,109
Rrrrrrrrrr.

225
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,875
It is the night of braw bricht moons
on the night of gladess.

226
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,639
Yes.

227
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,837
Inspector McClaren,
this is Monsieur Botot...

228
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,198
From Dijon. How do you do?
I was just telling Sergeant Yard

229
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,354
about my father-in-law's sister
on my sergeant's side.

230
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,431
Go round the back.

231
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,596
Ah...

232
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,878
At last. My own house.
My own swimming pool.

233
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,237
My own 38-23-38.

234
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,198
- Telegram.
- Read it to me.

235
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,238
"Dear Chief Commissioner.
Happy birthday."

236
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,393
"Hope you enjoy the 3,000lb of Jell-O."

237
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,078
3,000lb of Jell-O?

238
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,435
There must be some mistake.

239
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,557
Where would I put 3,000lb of Jell-O?

240
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,749
Besides, only Clouseau would be stupid
enough to send me 3,000lb of Jell-O.

241
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,956
Argh!

242
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,031
(phone rings)

243
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,195
Hello?

244
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,474
Argh!

245
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,677
This is Inspector Drummond
of Scotland Yard.

246
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,830
I hope I didn't wake you up.

247
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,151
It's quite all right.
As a matter of fact, you did me a favour.

248
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,231
Who is it?

249
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,109
- What can I do for you, Inspector?
- It's about Inspector Clouseau.

250
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,479
Ml5 called and reported
that Libyan agents heard a rumour

251
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,519
that there might be an assassination
attempt against Clouseau.

252
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,876
Really? Who else wants to kill him?

253
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,679
I mean, who is behind it?

254
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,197
We don't know.
But it comes from a reliable source.

255
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,273
We've told Clouseau
but he just laughed and said

256
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,509
"The moving fingair writes."

257
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,034
"Fingair."

258
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,429
When it's Clouseau,
he could mean anything.

259
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,479
- Do you know what time it is?
- Will you shut up?!

260
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,673
No, not you. Tell me, where is he now?

261
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,151
At his hotel. I think you should
call him and order him back to Paris.

262
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,190
Until we verify this rumour, under no
circumstances allow him to go to Lugash.

263
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,109
- Yes?
- Do you have for me the "massage"?

264
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,758
Oh.

265
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,037
- You want a massage?
- If you have one for me, yes.

266
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,953
Why don't you try Tokyo Lil
at the end of the block?

267
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:43,114
Ask for Passionflower Shirley,
the Yokohama Butterfly.

268
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,714
- Why should I do that?
- You want a massage.

269
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,633
Yes, but I want it from you.

270
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,915
Sir, I don't give massages.

271
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,231
- You gave me one this morning.
- You're mistaken.

272
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,710
Don't you try the tricks anglais
with me, monsieur.

273
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,794
I received a "massage" this morning from
Inspector Quinlan of the Yard of Scotland.

274
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,952
- The massage!
- It was you that gave it to me.

275
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,079
- Message. You mean message.
- I know what I mean, you lunatic.

276
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,879
Do you or do you not
have for me the "massage"?

277
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,953
No, sir. For you, there is no massage.

278
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,751
(phone rings)

279
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,118
- Grouse-Moor Hotel.
- Inspector Clouseau.

280
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,191
Oh.

281
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,197
He just went up to his room. I'll ring.

282
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,271
Thank you.

283
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,471
(phone rings)

284
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,317
- Yes. This is Chief Inspector Clouseau.
- (knocking)

285
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,391
Turn your bed down, sir.

286
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,233
(maid coughs)

287
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,279
Agh!

288
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,596
Yes? You were saying?

289
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,271
(Clouseau) Agh!

290
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,071
Aagh!

291
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,356
Now then.
What was that you were saying?

292
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,237
(Clouseau) Aaagh!

293
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,071
Your massage!

294
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,991
Your phone.

295
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,517
To the airport, my good man,
and drive like the wind.

296
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,591
Right, sir.

297
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,270
I knew that.

298
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,999
I don't want to hear another word about it.

299
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,117
Don't get involved!
When you get mixed up with Clouseau...

300
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,191
- That's enough!
- What are you doing?

301
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,308
What does it look like? I'm doing what
I've done every morning for two years.

302
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,631
- But you can't!
- I'm sick and tired of you telling me

303
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,599
- what I can do and what I can't.
- Suit yourself.

304
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,916
I hope you like
the new pool cover you ordered.

305
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,833
(Muslim call to prayer)

306
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,991
- I think you made a mistake, Colonel.
- Wrong.

307
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,875
Never call me Colonel, Colonel Bufoni. I
am now your president and I am infallible.

308
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,110
It says so in the new constitution.

309
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,634
Which you wrote
when you were still a colonel.

310
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,190
And you were a captain, Colonel,
which you could soon become again.

311
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,717
Yes, Mr President.
It's just that sending for Clouseau...

312
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,271
Was a stroke of genius. He found the Pink
Panther before, he will find it again.

313
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,794
Possibly. And then?

314
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,670
Then... the grateful people of Lugash
will shower me, President Haleesh,

315
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,355
with praise and honour...
and their daughters.

316
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,750
And the insurance companies,

317
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,992
the ones which have already paid our
government's claim of 12 million dollars

318
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,674
for the theft of the Pink Panther,

319
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,354
what will they shower you with?

320
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,278
Why didn't you mention this
before I sent for Clouseau?

321
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,272
You've only just told me
that you'd requested assistance

322
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,351
from somebody else's police force.

323
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,558
- Maybe we can withdraw the request.
- Not "we", Mr President. "You."

324
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,591
Only you can't. Clouseau's plane at this
very minute is winging its way to Lugash.

325
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,549
Well, perhaps he won't
find the Pink Panther.

326
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,756
Perhaps he won't reach Lugash.

327
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,311
- Colonel, you wouldn't...
- To save my president.

328
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,595
Do what you must, Colonel.

329
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,716
Just don't tell me about it.

330
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,793
A president's conscience
must be unblemished.

331
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,471
You understand my meaning, General?

332
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,233
As the hand understands the glove.

333
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,436
Oh, great one.

334
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,475
(whimpering)

335
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,950
(doctor) Try to get control
of yourself, my friend.

336
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,508
Giving in in this way is not healthy.

337
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,751
If I were healthy,
why would I be here, Doctor?

338
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,877
I was referring to your blood pressure.

339
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,238
I see. He's such a maniac,
such an idiot, such a fool.

340
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,515
And such a lucky fool.

341
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,478
He would fall backwards down a manhole

342
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,791
and wind up
in the arms of Brooke Shields.

343
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,872
And now London, half in ruins.

344
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,520
Lugash, a helpless little desert country,

345
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,195
- about to be devastated.
- You must get hold of yourself.

346
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,952
Yes, I'm trying.

347
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,998
You don't want to end up
at Happy Acres again.

348
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,631
No. But, Doctor,
until Clouseau is out of my hair,

349
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,759
out of my life for ever, I'm doomed.

350
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,956
I'll never smile again.

351
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,909
Frank Sinatra with
the Pied Pipers and Tommy Dorsey.

352
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,279
I'm falling apart and you go down
memory lane with your silly jazz!

353
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,793
(phone rings)

354
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,273
They know not to interrupt me when I'm
with a patient, unless it is an emergency.

355
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,955
- Allô?
- Emergency call for the inspector.

356
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,592
It would seem the emergency
is not mine... but yours.

357
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,391
Yes, Dreyfus.

358
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,472
- I have terrible news for you.
- What?

359
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,028
Inspector Clouseau's plane is missing.

360
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,395
- You are sure?
- Yes, positive. I'm sorry.

361
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,471
- I'll be right there.
- OK, Inspector.

362
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,834
Thank you.

363
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,388
Doctor Longet... goodbye!

364
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,510
You see before you a man reborn!

365
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,831
Cured. Sane. Sound as a Swiss franc.

366
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,151
- The phone call was good news?
- Wonderful news.

367
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,711
Clouseau's plane is overdue
and presumed lost, into the sea.

368
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,109
Lost into the sea
and out of my life for ever!

369
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,192
I'm going to wash that man
right out of my hair.

370
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,558
I know. Mary Martin, South Pacific.

371
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,390
(laughs)

372
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,871
I'm going to wash that man
right outta my hair

373
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,988
I'm going to wash that man
right outta my hair

374
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,549
Agh!

375
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,312
(crash)

376
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,431
She's here. Come in.

377
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,588
I think this is a mistake.
Tell her I'm out of town on a case.

378
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,478
- Do you think that's wise?
- Is talking to her wise?

379
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,710
You were his immediate superior.

380
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,793
"Were." You really think he's... past tense?

381
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,474
- It seems possible.
- It would be wonderful.

382
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,870
Sooner or later,
a persistent reporter, like Marie Jouvet...

383
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,428
But what can I say? What can I tell her?

384
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,636
- That I thought him an imbecile?
- No.

385
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,396
That I thought him the luckiest man in the
world with the brain of a retarded clam?

386
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,357
Of course not.

387
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,954
You know he was an idiot,
I know he was an idiot,

388
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,953
but to everyone else he was the greatest
detective since Sherlock Holmes.

389
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,510
- If I tell the truth...
- Then don't. He's gone.

390
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,876
Give them the hero they want.
It's no skin off your nose.

391
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,793
But is he really gone?

392
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,192
I've got this ghastly feeling that one
of these days - next week or tomorrow -

393
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,592
I'll open the trunk of my car
or my closet and "Peekaboo!"

394
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,036
But even so,
I really don't think you have a choice.

395
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,033
What if I don't bring it off? You know me
where Clouseau is concerned.

396
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,557
My emotions are just lurking
below the surface like a floating mine.

397
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,438
- Oh, God. I can't do it.
- You can do it.

398
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,318
I can do it? Yes, I can do it.

399
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,151
No, you do it.

400
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,591
Miss Jouvet.

401
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,831
Ah, Miss Jouvet. How nice of you to come.

402
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,390
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Pull up a clam.

403
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,437
How would you describe
Inspector Clouseau?

404
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,275
Well... I've never known a man like him.

405
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,477
He was... He was unique.

406
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,314
- (Marie) Could you be more specific?
- (Dreyfus) I could be, but...

407
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,870
To start with, he was...

408
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,632
unorthodox.

409
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,599
- In what way?
- In every way.

410
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,309
- Can you give me an example?
- An example.

411
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,111
For instance, to keep himself
constantly alert to any attack,

412
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,716
he instructed his Chinese manservant
to attack him

413
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,995
wherever and whenever he could.

414
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,913
That's not only unorthodox, it's bizarre.

415
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,639
- He sounds like a real nut.
- Shut up!

416
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,951
There were rumours
that you and he didn't get along.

417
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,951
Well...

418
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,238
I suppose we occasionally
had our little disagreements,

419
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,110
but when you work
with somebody for 20 years

420
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,795
you can't always be expected to see...

421
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,156
to see... I mean, to see eye to eye.

422
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,794
Then you think he was a good detective?

423
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,350
He was... I think he was...

424
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,948
You can't just say he was...

425
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,875
There are no words
to describe what he really was.

426
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,951
How about "genius"?

427
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,671
That is a word.

428
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,194
- Courageous?
- Courageous?

429
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,037
Oh, courageous.

430
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,873
The president twice
decorated him for bravery.

431
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,075
Right.

432
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,995
- That sounds like a courageous man.
- It certainly sounds that way.

433
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,878
He was reputed to be a great athlete.

434
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,951
(Dreyfus sniggers)

435
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,113
You have no idea what an athlete he was.

436
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,191
A karate black belt?

437
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,355
- A black belt?
- Expert marksman. A born leader.

438
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,311
Inspector, I'm so sorry.

439
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,597
Gee, he's crying.

440
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,189
- Hello?
- This is Bruno. I want a meeting.

441
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,271
- Who with?
- Everybody.

442
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,669
OK, boss.

443
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,069
(ripping)

444
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,955
Aagh!

445
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,871
Aaagh!

446
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,637
You mean it was part of your job
to attack him like that?

447
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,869
Oh, yes.

448
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,869
Well, Cato. I'm back on the case.

449
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,951
Ah-ha!

450
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,799
Now to set the trap, catch the killer

451
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,635
and prove to the world that
Maria Gambrelli is innocent... of murder.

452
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,156
We must accelerate our training.

453
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,916
Attack me whenever and wherever
I least expect it. Give no quarter.

454
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,917
- Didn't anyone ever get hurt?
- Oh, yes. Mostly me.

455
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,313
There was one time, however,
when the Mafia imported a ninja.

456
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,676
The inspector thought the ninja was me.

457
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,230
- (Marie) Poor ninja.
- I know just how he felt.

458
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,756
Now, with your boss gone,
no more sneak attacks.

459
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,831
You must be very relieved.

460
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,593
Not entirely.

461
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,879
Sometimes, when you do something long
enough, you miss it even if it was painful.

462
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,868
What do you think
happened to the inspector?

463
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,394
- Beats me.
- (phone rings)

464
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,549
Inspector Clouseau's residence.

465
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,631
One moment, please.

466
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,711
It's for you.

467
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,198
- Allô?
- This is Sergeant Duval speaking.

468
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,874
I have that information for you.

469
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,111
Clouseau's former assistant,
Hercule Lajoy,

470
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,670
is living on a river barge called The Moth.

471
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,834
- Hello?
- Hello.

472
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,117
- Hercule Lajoy?
- Who wants to know?

473
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,398
- Marie Jouvet. I'm a television reporter.
- I know what you are.

474
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,119
Can I come aboard? I want to talk to you.

475
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,430
- You want answers?
- Of course.

476
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,876
How can I give you answers?
I am taking a nap.

477
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,997
I'll wait until you wake up.

478
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,071
All right.

479
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,872
You're even better-looking
than you are on television.

480
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,428
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

481
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,469
I don't know why, but I have the distinct
impression that I was expected.

482
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,199
Clouseau has disappeared.
You're a reporter.

483
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,999
- Elementary.
- Spoken like a true policeman.

484
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,957
A retired policeman.

485
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,235
- May I sit?
- As you choose.

486
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,195
You worked with Clouseau.

487
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,271
Yes. He was unique.

488
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,591
Intuitive?
A man who followed his hunches?

489
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,470
Who can tell what he followed? But he
was the most successful man in the force.

490
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:33,635
Everything I thought made up a proper
investigation, he did the opposite.

491
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,508
Facts, Hercule. Facts.

492
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,635
Nothing matters but the facts.

493
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,712
Without them, the science
of criminal investigation

494
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,872
is nothing more than a guessing game.

495
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,669
Listen to me, Hercule,
and you will learn something.

496
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,910
The facts in this case are:

497
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,835
The body of the chauffeur was found
in the bedroom of the second maid. Fact!

498
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,630
Cause of death:
Four bullets in the chest. Fact!

499
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,670
The bullets were fired at close range
from a.25 Beretta automatic. Fact!

500
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,629
Maria Gambrelli was discovered
with the murder weapon in her hand. Fact!

501
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,191
The murder weapon was registered in
the name of the deceased, Miguel Ostos,

502
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,831
and was kept in the glove compartment
of the Ballon Rolls-Royce.

503
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,239
Fact!

504
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:30,873
Members of the household staff
have testified that Miguel Ostos beat...

505
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,273
You fool, you've broken my pointing stick.
I've got nothing to point with now.

506
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:41,992
Have testified that Miguel Ostos
beat Maria Gambrelli frequently.

507
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,119
And finally comes this sworn statement
of Monsieur and Madame Ballon,

508
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:52,196
as well as all the members of the staff,
each of them with perfect alibis.

509
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,274
Now then, Hercule.
What is the inescapable conclusion?

510
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,669
Maria Gambrelli killed the chauffeur.

511
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,389
What? You idiot! Lmpossible.
She's protecting someone.

512
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,789
- How do you know that?
- Instinct!

513
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,869
But the facts...

514
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,872
You are forgetting
the most important fact - motive.

515
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,110
- He beat her.
- He was Spanish.

516
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,589
- He tore her dress off.
- Don't be ridiculous!

517
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,877
Would you kill somebody
who tore your dress off?

518
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,838
- No, I suppose not.
- Of course not.

519
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,111
No. There is no doubt
in my mind whatsoever, Hercule.

520
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,636
Maria Gambrelli is most definitely
protecting somebody.

521
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,439
Find that somebody
and you have found the murderer.

522
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,752
And I shall find the murderer
before the day is out.

523
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,038
Maria Gambrelli will tell me who he is.

524
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,110
Yet Clouseau was proved right.
Maria Gambrelli was innocent.

525
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,875
Clouseau was always proved right
at the end of the case.

526
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,794
But on the way
even he made a few miscalculations.

527
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,951
(operatic singing)

528
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,951
Agh!

529
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,790
(Marie) And now he is lost in the sea.

530
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,678
I admired his successes,
but his methods...

531
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,878
They made a mockery of everything
I knew of police work, so I quit.

532
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,669
But I have a good life.
I carry a few cargoes.

533
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,039
I charter to a group of tourists in August
when it gets too hot to stay in Paris.

534
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,113
Don't you miss it sometimes,
the excitement?

535
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:45,389
Young lady, if I missed the excitement
don't you think I would bait my hook?

536
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,954
Thank you, Hercule Lajoy. I like you.

537
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,476
I don't think you're the hard case
you make yourself out to be.

538
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,712
I like Hercule too, just because
he is the hard case he seems to be.

539
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,349
But if you really want to get
to the bottom of this Clouseau thing,

540
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,874
forget about us,
the ones on his side of the law.

541
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,476
Dig up some of the crooks
he caught, or didn't catch.

542
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,831
Goodbye.

543
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,394
- Call again when you're in the area!
- Thank you. I may do that.

544
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,754
They only show the top half
of you on television.

545
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,515
- I'm glad the bottom is just as good.
- Me too.

546
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,195
- How's business?
- Better.

547
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,918
Pickin' up.

548
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,753
Clouseau disappears.
Business gets better.

549
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,831
Sure thing, yeah.

550
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,040
- This Marie Jouvet is snoopin' around.
- So what?

551
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,999
Who knows? But I think
it's better we put a tail on her.

552
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,789
Luis, she's no dummy.
You pick a couple of good boys?

553
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,911
Done.

554
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,831
(man) When I first met Inspector
Clouseau, about 20 years ago, in Cortina,

555
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,911
I had a nasty ski accident

556
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,357
and unfortunately Clouseau happened
to be staying at the same hotel.

557
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,237
Ow!

558
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,199
- Ow!
- Excuse me. My leg is caught.

559
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,757
- You were married to the inspector?
- Yes.

560
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,273
Had you known Sir Charles
before Cortina?

561
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,271
Only casually.

562
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,439
I am willing to bet you 10,000 francs

563
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,116
that the Phantom is in Cortina at this very
moment. Even, perhaps, in this room.

564
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,714
How exciting.
What do you think, Mr Tucker?

565
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,715
I agree. Ten of his last 15 victims have
been guests at Angela Dunning's parties.

566
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,234
What are we all talking about?

567
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,756
- The notorious Phantom.
- I'm afraid I've never heard of him.

568
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,115
He seems to be quite a fellow.

569
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,510
There are few thieves
who are as clever as the Phantom.

570
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,116
Each theft is completely different
and unique, classic in its conception.

571
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,431
I thought your theory is
that he does repeat himself.

572
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,080
Only with regard to
Angela Dunning's parties.

573
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,549
However, there is one other duplication,

574
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,634
but that is his... trademark,
his calling card, so to speak.

575
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,430
- He leaves a white monogrammed glove.
- Sounds terribly theatrical.

576
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,399
Your Highness, if I were the Phantom,
I'd have chosen my victim already.

577
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,789
Really? And who would that be?

578
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,758
Who owns the most fabulous
diamond in the world?

579
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,593
- I suppose I do.
- Exactly. The Pink Panther.

580
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,353
Such a prize he could never resist.

581
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,876
He'd be disappointed.
The Pink Panther is in my safe at...

582
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,554
Your Highness, please.
Don't say it, not here.

583
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:52,873
Your Highness, I read there was a dispute
over the ownership of the Pink Panther.

584
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,077
It belongs to me.
It was a gift from my late father.

585
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,958
- I shall never surrender it.
- Why should you?

586
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,670
When this government seized power,
they claimed it belonged to the people.

587
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,389
There's talk of the international court
deciding the issue.

588
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,995
Why don't I steal the diamond,
leave that old glove behind,

589
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,277
- and you and I can split the insurance?
- All right.

590
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,828
I feel like dancing. Your Highness?

591
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,911
I'd love to.

592
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,556
- How about you, madame?
- Yes, of course.

593
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,359
- Your leg is better, Sir Charles?
- What?

594
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,194
- I say your leg is better.
- Yes. Much better. Thank you.

595
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,233
You know, Mr Tucker... Argh!

596
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,719
That's my beer.

597
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:43,036
In May 1964 you divorced
Inspector Clouseau and a year later...

598
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,190
I married the man of my dreams.

599
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,589
- Who was that, darling?
- You know.

600
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,831
That fellow Clouseau accused
of being the notorious Phantom.

601
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,595
You have to forgive her.
She's not very good on names.

602
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,229
- He's terribly attractive.
- But she has impeccable taste.

603
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,598
- Why did Clouseau think it was you?
- An anonymous phone call.

604
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,671
I see. Come up immediately.

605
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,035
Sir Charles. The Phantom.

606
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,395
I've really got him this time.

607
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,919
- But of course he was wrong.
- About what?

608
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,072
- About you being the Phantom.
- Of course. He was wrong.

609
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,550
- Wrong, but persistent.
- Persistent he was.

610
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,760
(Sir Charles) He was convinced that
I was planning to steal the Pink Panther.

611
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,155
And when Princess Dala gave
a costume ball at a villa in Rome,

612
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,549
Clouseau was there with his men.

613
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,871
- Warm.
- Yes, must be hell in there.

614
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,711
Bet it's not so good in there.

615
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,918
- Anything suspicious?
- No, nothing to worry about.

616
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,994
My men are everywhere. Mingling here,
mingling there, watching all the time.

617
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,078
How dare you drink on duty?
Who is inside there?

618
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,151
- Sergeant Walter.
- Sergeant Coff.

619
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,515
Stop that or I'll have your stripes!

620
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,115
- The Pink Panther was stolen that night?
- By a gorilla.

621
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,158
Come back! It's me!

622
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,831
(Sir Charles) To my dying day,

623
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,118
I'll never forget that old man
trying to cross the street.

624
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,475
(tyres squeal)

625
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,757
(horn)

626
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,437
(horn)

627
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,877
(horn)

628
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,837
- (Clouseau) Come on, faster!
- (horn)

629
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:33,238
What's the matter with you?
Can't you drive this thing faster?

630
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,877
(horn)

631
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,712
(Clouseau) This is the road
they have gone up.

632
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,472
(horn)

633
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,836
Don't argue with me!
I know where they've gone.

634
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,677
(horn)

635
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,157
(horn)

636
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:09,957
- George, how do we get out of here?
- I don't know. I've been all over this place.

637
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,793
- How do we get out?
- You try the high road.

638
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,758
I'll take the high road,
you take the low road. So long.

639
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,829
Ciao, George.

640
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,637
(horn)

641
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,951
- That's them!
- No, it isn't.

642
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,270
(tyres screech)

643
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,351
(crash)

644
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,111
(continuous horn)

645
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:26,512
For a while, it looked as though
Clouseau himself was the Phantom.

646
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:31,515
He was actually arrested for having stolen
the Pink Panther and sent to prison.

647
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,393
Tucker!

648
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,715
- But he was innocent.
- Inept, but innocent.

649
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,268
- Inept?
- Wouldn't you say so, darling?

650
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,432
Not in everything, darling.
He was a terrific sleeper.

651
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,829
- It's hard to believe.
- It's true.

652
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,549
He almost never made a serious
mistake while he was sleeping.

653
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,074
I mean, inept! France's greatest detective!

654
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,355
It does test one's reality.

655
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,510
- Do you think he's dead?
- I hope not.

656
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:02,354
- What do you think, Sir Charles?
- No. Men like Clouseau never die.

657
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,318
They're indestructible.
That's how it should be.

658
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,868
- Why?
- We need them.

659
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,269
They help us preserve
our sense of humour.

660
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,511
And they're living proof
that, however bad things get,

661
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:18,071
if you persevere you survive
and sometimes even win.

662
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,197
So you think determination
was the key to his success?

663
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,236
No question about it.

664
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:27,154
He was a fool but he epitomised
the 11th commandment.

665
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,596
- The 11th commandment?
- "Thou shalt not give up."

666
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,557
- I like that.
- I thought you might.

667
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,034
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

668
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,873
- Come and see us again.
- I may do that.

669
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,555
The man of your dreams
is also a Machiavellian charmer.

670
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,517
I know that. Thank you.

671
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,989
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

672
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,233
- You've just passed the hotel.
- Yes, ma'am.

673
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:21,155
- But that's where I wanted to go.
- You see that car following us?

674
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,639
What about it?

675
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,350
The two men in that car suggested
I drop you off at another address.

676
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,956
- What are you talking about?
- Actually, it was more like a threat.

677
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:36,716
- They threatened you?
- One of them showed me his new gun.

678
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,791
Who are they?

679
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:45,591
I know you'll think I'm not on the ball,
but I neglected to get their names.

680
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,240
- You realise this is kidnapping?
- Yeah.

681
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,039
I have to be honest with you.

682
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,839
I couldn't come up with an alternative.

683
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,229
You can go to prison for life
for kidnapping.

684
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,790
Lady, the gun he showed me
was a.38 Magnum.

685
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,950
I don't know anything about guns.

686
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,749
That gun makes enormous holes
in things.

687
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,753
I had a choice between kidnapping you
and getting shot with that gun.

688
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,356
To be perfectly frank,
I would look terrible and feel worse

689
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,476
with an enormous hole in me.

690
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,110
- Miss Jouvet, how nice of you to come.
- Did I have a choice?

691
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,873
Actually, no.
Let's go where we can be private.

692
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,350
- Do I have a choice?
- I just wanna have a talk with you.

693
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,034
- Watch your step.
- I always do.

694
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,794
- Why the drama? You could have phoned.
- Would you have come?

695
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,633
To see the French godfather?
Bruno, I'm a reporter.

696
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,599
And a terrific-lookin' one at that.
Take a swim.

697
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,791
Come on.
Let's make ourselves comfortable.

698
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,716
- Have a seat.
- Can I have a drink?

699
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,394
- Do I have a choice?
- Actually, no.

700
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,758
- How about some champagne?
- Terrific. And put a fresh peach in it.

701
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,116
- Champagne and put a peach in it.
- Peach?

702
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,758
Yes, sir.

703
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,879
- I never heard of a peach in champagne.
- Very sexy.

704
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,315
- Make that two.
- Yes, sir.

705
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,837
- What happens if he has no peaches?
- Something very melodramatic.

706
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,630
If it gets to that,
I'll settle for plain champagne.

707
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:02,475
Marie, you really are
some kinda sensational lady.

708
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,351
Bruno, there is an old saying.

709
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,318
- What's that?
- Never bullshit a bullshitter.

710
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,389
(laughs)

711
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,916
I want you to lay off
on this Clouseau thing.

712
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,428
- Take off your glasses.
- What for?

713
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,273
Then I can see what you're thinking.

714
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,920
I doubt that.

715
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,039
- Why do you want me to lay off him?
- Cos I asked you to.

716
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,998
- It's not a good enough reason.
- It should be.

717
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,071
What if I don't?

718
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:36,431
You know, Marie, when I was your age,

719
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,876
I used to sometimes wonder
what it would be like

720
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,918
if I suddenly found a whole lot of money.

721
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,389
- Have you ever imagined that?
- Oh, yes.

722
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:51,195
I even imagined that some day someone
might try to bribe me with a small fortune.

723
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,669
- What did you do?
- I was tempted.

724
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,593
- That's a good start.
- But I said no.

725
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,750
- Not very bright.
- I'm a reporter.

726
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,798
For better or for worse, an honest one.

727
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,914
Tell me why you want me
to lay off Clouseau.

728
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,310
Cos I prefer things the way they are.

729
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,516
Clouseau created a lot of problems.

730
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,717
A smart lady like you
could find out he's still alive.

731
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:18,351
Or dead. I might even find out
that someone killed him.

732
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:26,000
You've got a beautiful face. Why do you
want to stick it in where it doesn't belong?

733
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,435
Because it's my job.

734
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:34,390
What good's your job if you've gotta
do your TV show from a hospital bed?

735
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,319
I knew you were going to threaten me,
but I didn't know how I would react.

736
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,789
- I've surprised myself.
- Is that right?

737
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,792
Yes. Instead of scaring me,
you have made me angry.

738
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,269
I can't remember when I've been so angry.

739
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:52,195
I am a member of the press and I will not
be intimidated by you or by anybody else.

740
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:56,273
- Now who's being melodramatic?
- Melodramatic? Wait till I get home!

741
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:00,148
- What are you gonna do?
- Faint or throw up. Maybe both.

742
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,915
- Eight to five it's throw up.
- You've got a bet.

743
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,191
Sir?

744
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,193
- Gutsy lady.
- Yes, indeed, sir.

745
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,272
- Great ass.
- I didn't notice, sir.

746
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,670
Arthur, there's an old saying.

747
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,116
- "Never bullshit a bullshitter."
- Of course, sir.

748
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,954
Yes, great arse indeed.

749
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,996
(woman) Bruno!

750
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,355
Can I get out now?

751
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,071
Yeah.

752
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,752
I don't think she has such a great ass.

753
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,630
- What do you expect me to do?
- Arrest him.

754
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,870
- On what charge?
- He had me kidnapped.

755
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,996
- Can you prove it?
- Ask the taxi driver!

756
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,275
You said the taxi driver kidnapped you.

757
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,954
Bruno's men forced him to.
They had guns.

758
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:57,635
- Did you see the guns?
- No, but the taxi driver told me...

759
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,757
I'm certain that everything
you've told me is true.

760
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,116
But... I'm equally certain
Monsieur Langlois will deny it.

761
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,315
Monsieur Langlois?

762
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,710
- It boils down to...
- It boils down to his word against mine.

763
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,869
Exactly!

764
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,272
In certain circles, Monsieur Langlois' word
carries a lot of weight.

765
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,555
You are upset
so I will ignore the innuendo.

766
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,279
Upset or not, the innuendo stands.

767
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,592
Miss Jouvet, may I suggest that
you go home and forget all about this.

768
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,193
Excuse me.

769
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,636
I shall tell you exactly where I am going -
directly to my office,

770
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,951
to write my next broadcast
about the Mafia boss who kidnapped me

771
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,396
and the chief inspector
who refused to do anything about it.

772
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,472
In my opinion, that would be most unwise.

773
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,758
What it boils down to, Inspector, is,
I don't trust your opinion.

774
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,830
Miss Jouvet seemed a bit upset.

775
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,151
Miss Jouvet is turning out
to be a real pain in the a...

776
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,389
Aagh!

777
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,712
So far the incident hasn't
even been investigated.

778
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,872
If Bruno Langlois is in the mood
to deny the allegation,

779
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,554
I will be happy to repeat it
on the witness stand.

780
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,950
- She's talking about you.
- Yes.

781
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,075
Lot of guts.

782
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,954
I believe even the French godfather would
think twice about challenging me in court.

783
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,032
As for Chief Inspector Dreyfus,

784
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:30,079
if he really is the paragon of
police virtue that he purports to be,

785
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,835
why hasn't he found the taxi driver
and interrogated him?

786
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,117
- She's talking about you.
- Yes.

787
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,678
It's intriguing, but the more
I find out about Clouseau,

788
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,834
the more certain interested parties
would prefer me to drop my investigation.

789
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,071
So far, I haven't turned up
anything incriminating,

790
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:54,358
but obviously I'm rocking the boat
and people are getting nervous.

791
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:58,991
One thing's sure. I intend to keep on
rocking until I have an answer for you.

792
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,071
Good night.

793
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,556
(phone rings)

794
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,029
Clouseau's residence. Cato speaking.

795
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:18,238
I've gone to Miami Beach to spend
Chinese New Year with my grandmother.

796
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,311
Leave a message after the bleep.

797
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,031
Allô?

798
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,991
Avon calling!

799
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,311
(screams)

800
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,233
(yelling)

801
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,476
(yelling)

802
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,191
You!

803
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,311
(groans)

804
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,471
Regrettably.

805
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,431
(phone rings)

806
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,314
Clouseau's residence. Cato speaking.

807
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,632
I've gone to Miami Beach to spend
Chinese New Year with my grandmother.

808
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,392
Leave a message after the bleep.

809
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,597
- I'm sorry.
- I'm used to it.

810
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,960
This is Professor Auguste Balls of Paris.

811
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,951
You Oriental picaroon!

812
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:05,477
You can't fool me about a plane crash.
He is hiding to avoid payment.

813
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:09,553
Unless I receive 4,000 francs
by Friday, I'm suing.

814
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:14,714
You can put that in your opium pipe
and smoke it, you conniving Cantonese!

815
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,439
Who the hell is Professor Auguste Balls?

816
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,229
Inspector Clouseau's
official disguise-maker.

817
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,117
- What's a picaroon?
- A cheat.

818
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,078
- That's great.
- Being called a cheat?

819
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,550
Some of my best friends are picaroons.

820
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,952
- I'm sorry I broke in.
- That's OK. Keeps me in practice.

821
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,998
- Can I get you a cup of tea?
- No, thanks.

822
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:40,277
- I could use an aspirin.
- I telephoned before.

823
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,796
I really thought you'd gone
to visit your grandmother in Miami.

824
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:48,192
Miami Beach. She runs a bingo parlour.
She's a real picaroon.

825
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,472
I thought maybe I'd find something.

826
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,710
- Like what?
- Like this.

827
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,313
Oh, that!

828
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:04,234
- Do you know who these people are?
- His parents.

829
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,392
- Are they still alive?
- His father is.

830
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,040
He lives in the Château Clouseau
à Lamarque.

831
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,111
He's a winemaker.

832
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,749
Swine rabbit!

833
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,235
Mes chéries.

834
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,311
(giggling)

835
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,631
Beaujolais!

836
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,551
What are you doing?

837
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,240
Bon, bon, bon, bon.

838
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,118
- Au revoir, mes chéries.
- Au revoir, Papa.

839
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:14,672
It doesn't taste the same
since we lost Fifi.

840
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,876
I'm missing the great Fifi.

841
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,791
Fifi!

842
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,155
Could you tell me something
about your son?

843
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,192
No. After four o'clock,

844
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:33,029
I can't tell you anything about my son.

845
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:38,990
- Why not after four o'clock?
- Because, after tasting the wine all day,

846
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:45,318
after four o'clock
I can't remember my son -

847
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,790
let alone tell you anything about him.

848
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:55,035
It is a miracle that I remember
it is after four o'clock.

849
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,151
(laughs)

850
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,318
That felt good!

851
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:14,790
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am all right.

852
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,989
I was just checking that Nanna
vacuumed the rug.

853
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,031
Speaking of Nanna...

854
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,111
(whistles)

855
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,671
Fetch Nanna.

856
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,550
Nanna has been with me 61 years.

857
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,279
She was Jacques' nurse.

858
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,875
- Really?
- What?

859
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,997
- I said "Really?"
- I know that.

860
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,878
Because you said Nanna
was your son's nurse.

861
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,953
Mademoiselle, you don't have
to repeat what I said.

862
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,429
I know what I said.

863
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:05,356
Fortunately I am not too old
to have lost my memory yet.

864
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,396
K-nock wood.

865
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,671
Come in!

866
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,751
(laughs)

867
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,040
What am I laughing about?

868
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,509
I'm not sure I can explain it.

869
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,955
Nanna approaches.

870
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,155
(whistles)

871
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,231
Allez!

872
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,754
Apportez-moi Nanna.

873
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,111
Continuez.

874
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,595
Bon, ça va bien.

875
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,511
A gauche!

876
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,873
A gauche!

877
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,951
Sit.

878
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,595
Allez, à droite.

879
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,831
A droite, dog.

880
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,391
En bas!

881
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,313
A gauche!

882
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,511
(whistles)

883
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,151
(whistles)

884
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,711
Merci, Nanna.

885
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,751
(whistles)

886
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,231
En bas.

887
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,551
En bas.

888
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,351
- Santé.
- Santé.

889
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,991
(whistles)

890
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,911
She loves that dog.

891
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,791
Assis.

892
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,792
Regardez.

893
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,711
Regardez, dog.

894
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,392
No, Nanna.

895
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,231
Fifi.

896
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:51,348
(Clouseau Senior) My son Jacques
Clouseau was born September 8th 1920.

897
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:56,275
He had his mother's eyes
and his father's kidneys.

898
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,470
From the very beginning,

899
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,348
Jacques wanted to be a policeman.

900
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,156
He had many setbacks,

901
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,391
but he was always resourceful.

902
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:46,433
He was 18 when he entered the university

903
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,909
and fell in love.

904
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,190
The girl of his dreams married another.

905
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:02,271
Jacques decided
that life was not worth living.

906
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,911
To whom it may concern.

907
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:29,598
I find life no longer worth living.

908
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:35,838
Fortunately, there was a power failure.

909
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,514
Swine lights.

910
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,195
When the Germans invaded France,

911
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:59,796
Jacques joined the underground.

912
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,911
Swine plunger.

913
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:28,276
After the war, he joined the police force
and the rest is history.

914
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:31,113
Thank you.
It's been most interesting.

915
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:35,318
- It has?
- Yes. It helps to round out my tribute.

916
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,391
What do you mean?

917
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,510
Your tribute doesn't need rounding.

918
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,478
You have a great-looking tribute.

919
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,156
- He's alive, you know.
- How do you know that?

920
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:55,119
He has his mother's eyes,
but his father's fortitude.

921
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,919
- I thought it was his kidneys.
- That too.

922
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,994
A man with such fortitude and kidneys
must be alive someplace.

923
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,469
- I hope so.
- I knew that.

924
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,675
- Goodbye.
- Au revoir.

925
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,192
And so, after leaving
that delightful old man,

926
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:27,556
who is convinced
that his famous son is still alive,

927
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,029
I began to wonder "Is it possible?"

928
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,271
Mafia boss Bruno Langlois
seems to think it is.

929
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,636
Sir Charles Litton feels
that such men are indispensable

930
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,711
and therefore indestructible.

931
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,509
And Chief Inspector Dreyfus
is so obsessed with the possibility

932
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,672
that he's on the verge
of another nervous breakdown.

933
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:50,038
Did Inspector Clouseau really
perish in the sea, as reported?

934
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:54,877
Or, for reasons as yet unknown,
is he out there someplace,

935
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,670
plotting his next move, waiting
to reveal himself when the time is right?

936
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:05,153
I am reluctant to believe that misfortune
has really struck down such a great man.

937
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,271
Swine seagull.

938
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,351
(Pink Panther theme)

939
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,037
We must find that woman.

940
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:40,076
Here's the report.

941
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,755
I will apprehend this culprit
within 24 hours. Agh!

942
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:44,955
Ah!

943
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,634
Now we are getting somewhere.

944
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,438
You!

945
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:57,675
- But that's a priceless Steinway.
- Not any more.

946
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,911
Agh!

947
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,591
(phone rings)

948
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,751
Inspector Clouseau's residence.

949
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,434
- Clouseau.
- One moment, please.

950
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,389
For you.

951
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,919
He's Sir Charles Phantom,
the notorious Litton.

952
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,673
- The Phantom?
- Yes. One and the same.

953
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,796
My greedy little yellow pimp.

954
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:01,869
Ow!

955
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:06,272
There is something that I am
very interested to know. It's rumoured...

956
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,431
Back to town.

957
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,831
Follow that car.

958
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,517
Does your dog bite?

959
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,309
No.

960
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,114
Nice doggy.

961
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:55,629
I thought you said your dog did not bite.

962
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,154
That is not my dog.

963
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,150
Do you know the way to the Palace Hotel?

964
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,231
Yes.

965
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:10,073
Special delivery. A beum.
Were you expecting one?

966
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,319
A beum?!

967
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,473
You fool!
You raving Oriental idiot!

968
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:33,189
There is a time and a place
for everything, Cato.

969
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,714
And this is it.

970
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,511
And another thing.

971
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:51,508
I was known as
the Pavlova of the parallels.

972
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,553
Oh, yes.

973
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,548
Yes, it's all coming back now.

974
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,519
Ah, yes, I remember it...

975
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,955
Aagh!

976
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,072
Well, that felt good.
