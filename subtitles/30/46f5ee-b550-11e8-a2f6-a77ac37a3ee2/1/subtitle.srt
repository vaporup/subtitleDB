1
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,390
46-99402.

2
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,430
Transfer to 53-01138.

3
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,270
What'd we just do?

4
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,710
The Republican Party just made
a donation to the Black Panthers.

5
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,390
- Farm out.
- Right arm.

6
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,790
- Who's next?
- Let's see.

7
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,310
Richard Nixon's personal checking account
is in here.

8
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,310
This is a challenge.

9
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,070
Marty, we have to find somebody
truly worthy to give his money to.

10
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,710
How about the National Association
to Legalize Marijuana?

11
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,710
Perfect. How much should he give?

12
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,790
He's a generous man. I'd say,
all he's got. God, I'm hungry!

13
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,870
Marty...

14
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,870
...you're sure we will not
get into trouble for this?

15
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,510
Cosmo, trust me.

16
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,510
Posit: The phone company
has too much money.

17
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,830
- Good one.
- Consequence?

18
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,350
They're corrupt. Result?

19
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,750
The system perpetuates itself
at the expense of the people.

20
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,030
- Conclusion?
- Ma Bell needs to donate some money.

21
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,110
We're gonna change the world.

22
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,430
I just wish we could get course credit
for this. Gosh!

23
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,230
You gotta eat. You want some food?

24
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,390
Loser goes.

25
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,630
I never lose.

26
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,070
Pepperoni pizza, please.
Shaken, not stirred.

27
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,030
- Power to the people, Cos.
- Power to the people, Marty.

28
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,230
One cannot trust anybody these days.

29
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,510
No, don't do this.

30
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,430
Marty! Marty!

31
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,710
Martin.

32
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,310
Martin.

33
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,070
It's time.

34
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,710
How're we doing?

35
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,870
Carl's in position on the fire escape.
Mother's in the cable vault.

36
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,150
Whistler is reading.

37
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,150
We're up.

38
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,830
What's with the lobby?

39
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,750
Still just the one guard.

40
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,630
Okay, Mother,
try the ones coming off the blue trunk.

41
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,990
Nope.

42
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:12,190
Try the ones coming off the white trunk.
These don't sound right.

43
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,310
<i>Hold on.</i>

44
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,190
We even have photos
of the guy leaving the embassy...

45
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,670
...through the back service entrance.

46
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,430
Hey, Crease, you on?

47
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,750
Yeah, I'm on.

48
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,230
<i>Were you still in the CIA in '72?</i>

49
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,470
Yeah, why?

50
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,670
Did you know the Deputy
Director of Planning...

51
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,990
...was in Managua, Nicaragua,
the day before the earthquake?

52
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,590
What are you saying?
The CIA caused the Managua earthquake?

53
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,830
I can't prove it, but...

54
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,670
I can't talk to that guy.

55
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,950
Hold on, Mother. Go back one.

56
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,790
Bingo!

57
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,950
Securing bridge clips.

58
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,030
Preparing to sever master alarm circuit.

59
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,550
Five, four...

60
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,630
<i>I looked in that box just now.</i>

61
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,350
<i>There wasn't anything there.</i>

62
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,070
Nice bank?

63
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,470
You wouldn't believe what I had to do
to get a safe deposit box.

64
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,950
Shit. We're gettin' too old for this.

65
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,830
<i>- Westguard Security.
- Yeah, I got a fire at Centurion Bank.</i>

66
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,190
<i>We got the alarm. Are there any
secondary indications? Smoke or flame?</i>

67
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,470
No.

68
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,110
<i>Probably a false alarm. We've been
getting them in your area all night.</i>

69
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,670
<i>- See if it resets.
- Man, I don't know.</i>

70
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,510
- Sure you know which one to cut?
- Yes! The alarm's always the green one.

71
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,470
Good, Carl.

72
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:16,190
I'm not waitin' any longer.
I'm callin' the fire...

73
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,470
It stopped. Sorry.

74
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,190
<i>- No problem. And, son?
- Sir?</i>

75
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,230
<i>- Good work.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

76
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,710
All yours, Bish.

77
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,990
So, how much do you want?

78
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,150
$80,000, $90,000, $100,000.

79
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,670
Okay.

80
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,150
May I ask why you're closing
your account with us today, sir?

81
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:03,470
I just had this weird feeling
that my money wasn't safe here anymore.

82
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,590
Gentlemen, your communication lines
are vulnerable.

83
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,670
Fire exits need to be monitored.

84
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,270
Your rent-a-cops are a tad undertrained.

85
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,630
Outside of that,
everything seems to be fine.

86
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,510
You'll get our full report in a few days.
But first, who's got my check?

87
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,590
So, people hire you
to break into their places...

88
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,990
...to make sure no one
can break into their places?

89
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,990
It's a living.

90
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,470
Not a very good one.

91
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,910
Thank you.

92
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,350
Is that him?

93
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,710
Yeah, that's him.

94
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,030
Who's got the report for the bank sneak?

95
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,870
- I'm gonna type it up later.
- You are?

96
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,190
We haven't paid the typist since January,
so it's me or Whistler.

97
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,150
- Better Whistler.
- We've got customers.

98
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,030
- Shoes?
- Expensive.

99
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,510
Look busy, guys.

100
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,390
- Mr. Bishop. Dick Gordon.
- Hi.

101
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,390
- Buddy Wallace.
- Hi.

102
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,790
- We've heard great things about you.
- They're all true.

103
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,950
Thanks, Carl.

104
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,990
Let's go to the conference room.
You can tell us how we can help.

105
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,190
- Okay.
- Thank you.

106
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,510
- So here...
- Before we begin...

107
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,270
...there's something we'd like to clear up.

108
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,470
Most firms of this type are staffed
with ex-law enforcement types.

109
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,430
But your team...

110
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,870
- I know, kind of different.
- Yes, you are.

111
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,710
Darren Roskow, also known as "Mother".

112
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,550
Eighteen months at Dannemora
for breaking and entering.

113
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,470
Yeah, he was framed. But he's got
the best hands in the business.

114
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,990
Carl Arbogast, age 19.

115
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,750
Caught breaking into the Oakland School
District computer to change his grades.

116
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,310
I know. We're the ones who caught him.

117
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,590
Irwin Emery, also known as "Whistler".

118
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,990
He had some little problem
with the phone company.

119
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,270
Sixty-two counts?

120
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,070
You want law enforcement?

121
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,230
How about Donald Crease?
Twenty-two year veteran of the CIA.

122
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,070
Terminated, 1987. Why was that?

123
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,190
I don't know. I think a personality conflict.
Who are you?

124
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,510
Relax, Marty.
We have to check these things.

125
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,910
Everybody on your team has had
some sort of problem in their past.

126
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,550
And then there's Martin Bishop.

127
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,630
He doesn't seem to have a past.

128
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,110
Sorry to waste your time.
I don't work for the government.

129
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,910
We know.

130
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,510
National Security Agency.

131
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,190
You're the guys I hear breathing
on the other end of my phone.

132
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,070
No, that's the FBI.

133
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,430
We're not chartered
for domestic surveillance.

134
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,710
I see. You just overthrow governments,
set up friendly dictators.

135
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,390
No, that's the CIA.

136
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,270
We protect government communications,
try to break the other fellow's codes.

137
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,830
We're the good guys, Marty.

138
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,270
I can't tell you what a relief that is, Dick.

139
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,310
All right, that's enough.

140
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,110
Let's go.

141
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,710
If you change your mind...

142
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,430
...call us at this number...

143
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,390
...Mr. Brice.

144
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,670
Help me out?

145
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,310
Spare a quarter? Help me out.

146
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,710
The government's taken away my home.

147
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,510
Talk to him.

148
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,430
Well, if it isn't Robin Hood.

149
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:07,030
I could've joined the NSA, but
they found out my parents were married.

150
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,950
We're all friends here, right? Easy, easy.

151
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,950
- Want some coffee or something?
- No.

152
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,030
- Buddy, is that Janek's file?
- Yeah, Janek's file.

153
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,510
This is a mathematician
named Dr. Gunter Janek.

154
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,990
Works at a think tank called
the Coolidge Institute.

155
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,430
Specializes in large-number theory,
prime numbers, factoring.

156
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,230
- Cryptography.
- Very good.

157
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,510
Last month, the good doctor
gets a grant, $380,000.

158
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,590
Way out of profile for a guy like that.

159
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,750
It's our job to be curious, so we traced
the money. Guess where it comes from?

160
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,110
- I know you're not gonna say Russia.
- Yeah.

161
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,750
Give me a break.

162
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,510
We won, they lost.
It's been in a couple of papers.

163
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,910
We still spy on them. They still spy on us.

164
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,230
We intercepted a fax last week. Here.

165
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,750
He's making some kind of box,
a little black box.

166
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,750
The project's called Setec Astronomy.
We don't know what Setec stands for.

167
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,310
- Security technology...
- Sensor techniques, who knows?

168
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,510
It may be nothing or it may be something.
And we need to know.

169
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,710
Your job is to find that little black box.
Let us take a look at it.

170
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,190
No way.

171
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,990
Sorry, Marty.

172
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,670
We don't have a lot of choice here.

173
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,310
- Do it yourself.
- We can't.

174
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,190
By law, we're not allowed
to do this kind of operation.

175
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,350
Then get the FBI.

176
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,430
Yeah, right, the FBI.

177
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,270
The FBI can't work for us without approval
from a congressional committee.

178
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,390
- We don't have the time.
- So why me?

179
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,550
- Frankly, because we...
- Yeah, frankly.

180
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,990
Marty, sit down, please.

181
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,550
Frankly, because it's kind of illegal.

182
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,510
You've stayed underground more than 20
years. You know how not to get caught.

183
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,110
- We know you can keep your mouth shut.
- Job pays $175,000, payable on delivery.

184
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,790
You can distribute it among the poor,
if you like.

185
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,070
- Pass.
- We also clean up your record.

186
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,430
Quash the outstanding warrant
for your arrest.

187
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,350
Your pal Cosmo got 12 years.

188
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,590
That was without flight
to evade prosecution.

189
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,950
We all know what happened
to him in there.

190
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,510
If I say no?

191
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,190
Don't say no.

192
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,510
What good would you do anybody
in prison?

193
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,870
I don't believe this.
You lied to us all these years.

194
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,270
- Even lied to us about your name.
- Sorry, okay?

195
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,110
I'm sorry, but when you're wanted
by the feds, you don't go telling everybody.

196
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,590
We're not everybody, Martin,
we're your partners. You tell us.

197
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:41,110
Fine. Exactly why was it
you had to leave the CIA?

198
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,910
We all have our little secrets, don't we?

199
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,550
Look, you guys have a decision to make.

200
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,230
This is not a test.

201
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,790
The penetration is live,
the target is unaware.

202
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,870
Sneaking a foreign intelligence service
that might kill us is not what we do.

203
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,990
The probable level of security is very low.

204
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,030
But if you guys don't want to take
that chance just to keep me out of jail...

205
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,190
...fine, I understand, don't do it.

206
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,470
Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other guys,
but I'm in it for the money.

207
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,150
- I don't care if you go to jail.
- Me neither. I'm in.

208
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,430
Could we maybe just go back
to the "they might kill us" part?

209
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,470
If I thought that was likely, I wouldn't
bring this to you. But there is a risk.

210
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,870
It pays $175,000!

211
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,110
I'm in.

212
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,910
You guys'll be chalk outlines without me.

213
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,030
All right, what do we need?

214
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,550
We start with a very light surveillance.

215
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,350
Level three. First sign of baby-sitters,
we back off.

216
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,750
He's giving a lecture tomorrow at U.C.

217
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,270
I'm gonna be there and check him out.
Okay? Any questions?

218
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,350
Let's do it.

219
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,230
For the lecture, you want
to take Whistler or do you want me?

220
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,510
No, that's okay, I thought I'd ask Liz.

221
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,350
Who's this?

222
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,790
Sort of an old friend.

223
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,750
Practice! Practice, practice!

224
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,430
- Hi.
- We're not getting back together.

225
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,270
- Did I say anything?
- You will.

226
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,030
I'm here on business, Liz.

227
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,390
Bishop, you don't have a business,
you have a club. It's a boy's club.

228
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,430
You have a clubhouse,
you probably have a secret handshake.

229
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,230
Liz, I need your help.

230
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,070
I will not be dragged back into your world.

231
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,870
I have a new group of gifted children,
and I like the fact they're under 30.

232
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,230
Excuse me.

233
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,430
There's a mathematician named
Gunter Janek. You know him?

234
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,110
I've read him. Now go away.

235
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,590
- He's giving a master lecture at 3:30...
- How nice for him.

236
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,990
- I thought I'd buy you dinner after.
- I am not going out with you.

237
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,310
This isn't a date, dummy.
This is a scientific exploration, a tutorial.

238
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,390
I need you...

239
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,550
...to explain it to me.

240
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,630
Read a book.

241
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,790
They found me, Liz.

242
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,870
The government found me.

243
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,470
They offered me a deal.
If I take their offer...

244
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,270
...they clear my record,
and I can get my name back.

245
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,150
You and I are not getting back together.

246
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,870
Don't flatter yourself.

247
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,350
Pick me up at 3:00.

248
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,470
Yes!

249
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,110
While the number-field sieve
is the best method currently known...

250
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:37,710
...there exists an intriguing possibility
for a far more elegant approach.

251
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,230
This guy's good.

252
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,110
...over the rationals, and hence
contained in a single cyclotomic field.

253
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,750
Using the Artin map,
we might induce homomorphisms...

254
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,990
You seeing anybody?

255
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,870
This isn't just about large-number theory.
It's about cryptography.

256
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,350
You mean codes?

257
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,270
I mean unbreakable codes.

258
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,310
It would be a breakthrough
of Gaussian proportions...

259
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,990
...and allow us to acquire...

260
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:21,350
...the solution in a dramatically
more efficient manner.

261
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,790
Are you seeing...

262
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,950
Such an approach is purely theoretical.
So far, no one has been able...

263
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,350
...to accomplish such constructions...

264
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,910
...yet.

265
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,350
The numbers are so unbelievably big...

266
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,430
...all the computers in the world
could not break them down.

267
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,470
But maybe, just maybe...

268
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,790
...there's a shortcut.
- I'll bet you anything he's found it.

269
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,390
If he has, you're in over your head.
I'll get my coat.

270
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,710
Numbers themselves
may be our best tools...

271
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,950
...may be able to see things
in other numbers that we can't.

272
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,470
Martin.

273
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,870
Martin, how wonderful to see you.

274
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,310
- Hi, Greg. How are you?
- Is it not fabulous?

275
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,630
Today I can in public come and learn
your scientists' new secrets.

276
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,070
Alas, I did not understand one bit
of what he was talking about.

277
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,230
At least I...

278
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,950
Goodness, can it be?

279
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,030
Yeah.

280
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,270
- Elizabeth!
- She's dying to talk to you too, Greg.

281
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,990
Elizabeth.

282
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,590
- Hello, Greg.
- Elizabeth and Martin.

283
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,990
My heart leaps like gazelle
to see you back together again.

284
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,630
Tell it to stop leaping.
We are not back together.

285
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,870
No? What a pity.

286
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:46,150
Wait. I have smashing idea. Martin!

287
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,470
Kiev String Quartet plays
at the consulate on Thursday night.

288
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,910
You will be my guests.

289
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,030
Really, Greg,
I wouldn't know how to repay you.

290
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,830
Martin, now that our countries
are such good friends...

291
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,870
...perhaps you will finally be able
to do occasional favor for me?

292
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,350
- Gregor, you are shameless.
- See you Thursday night.

293
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,550
What?

294
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,350
New title.

295
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,390
Cultural Attaché.

296
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,030
Unbelievable!

297
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,550
Last few years has been very confusing
for people in my line of work.

298
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,430
I'll bet.

299
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,190
I don't care what anybody says
about the new world order.

300
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,070
I don't trust that guy.

301
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,630
Who, Greg? He's harmless.

302
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,390
Let the number itself tell us.

303
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,350
If you'll excuse me...

304
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,790
...I have some work.
- You're gonna follow him, aren't you?

305
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,510
It's okay. I'll get a cab.

306
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,750
Can I call you?

307
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,470
Just be careful.

308
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,470
Janek just got in the elevator.

309
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,950
- Going up.
- We will be ready for him.

310
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,550
- How's the audio?
- Good. Mother's close.

311
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,910
He's just wearing
four safety belts this time.

312
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,110
What, no parachute?

313
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,830
All right. Entry and lights on.

314
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,510
- Describe it.
- Looks like a workroom.

315
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:45,190
A bench with a soldering gun,
two spools of wire and a magnifying lamp.

316
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:48,670
Sounds like he's making somethin'.

317
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,790
Then a desk.

318
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:56,110
Telephone, lamp, answering machine.

319
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,510
A jar of pencils, but no little black box.

320
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,430
It's gotta be there somewhere.
What's he doing?

321
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,190
He's logging on the computer.

322
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,750
This is good.

323
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:15,190
He's gonna type in his password,
and we're gonna get a clear shot.

324
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,430
<i>Dr. Rhyzkov, good evening.</i>

325
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,270
Let's get an ID on Dr. Rhyzkov.
She was with him this afternoon.

326
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,230
She was trying to tell him something
and it was making him...

327
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,750
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

328
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,790
<i>Let's do what we did in Mexico City.</i>

329
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,390
I didn't know you could do that
in Mexico City.

330
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,150
- Mr. Bishop, mind if I take a look?
- Carl.

331
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,230
Grow up.

332
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,670
<i>- Let me see.
- Oh, Gunter.</i>

333
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,270
<i>Elena, really!</i>

334
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,950
<i>I must finish my work.</i>

335
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,630
Okay, back to work.

336
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,910
Nope, here we go.
Now we're gonna get our password.

337
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,910
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

338
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,870
<i>I'm sorry, really.</i>

339
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:27,230
Get out of the way. She's in the way.

340
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,910
<i>- I don't believe this.
- I'm sorry.</i>

341
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,630
<i>It's just, I have this work.</i>

342
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,670
<i>I give you something to work, baby.</i>

343
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:43,030
<i>Okay. Just for a little while.</i>

344
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,710
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

345
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,510
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

346
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,910
<i>Elena, really!</i>

347
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,230
<i>I must finish my work.</i>

348
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,230
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

349
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,710
Maybe there's a frame
where she doesn't block it.

350
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,470
I'll blow it up.

351
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,310
- Gentlemen.
- Who's Rhyzkov?

352
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,550
Dr. Elena Rhyzkov,
visiting professor from Czechoslovakia...

353
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,790
...senior research fellow in astrophysics.

354
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:25,150
- Bingo.
- Setec Astronomy, whatever that is.

355
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:29,350
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

356
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,590
<i>- There.
- I'm sorry.</i>

357
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,110
- "W", "G"...
- Looks like the "H".

358
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,950
- Where do you get "H"?
- Next to the "L".

359
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,310
- Come on. Do it again.
- "H" isn't next to the "L".

360
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:49,030
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

361
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,790
Okay, that's definitely "W", "G".

362
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,510
Definitely not. No, that's a "V".

363
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,030
She's in the way.

364
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,830
Fellas, Janek's little black box
is on his desk...

365
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,030
...between the pencil jar and the lamp.

366
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:13,750
Whistler, I hate to tell you this,
but you're blind.

367
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,830
Play the tape back again.

368
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,910
- But you can't see anything.
- Don't look. Listen.

369
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,470
Play it back.

370
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,030
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not...</i>

371
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,790
He's got a service.

372
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:35,070
What's he need an answering machine for?

373
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,990
There's our little black box.

374
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,190
Okay, boss.

375
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:52,350
This LTX-71 concealable mike is part
of the same system that NASA used...

376
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,910
...when they faked
the Apollo moon landings.

377
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,950
The astronauts broadcast
around the world from a soundstage...

378
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,790
...at Norton Air Force Base,
San Bernardino, California.

379
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,790
So it worked for them.
It shouldn't give us too many problems.

380
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,590
Thanks.

381
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,110
- You didn't have a delivery?
- I should have the invoice.

382
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,990
No delivery is scheduled.
They didn't have anything on record.

383
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,270
Did my wife drop a cake off for me?

384
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,230
- There's no cake here.
- Party for Marge on the second floor.

385
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,790
- She was supposed to drop a cake off.
- I don't know about it.

386
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,390
There she is, late as usual.

387
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:30,550
It states here that I am to deliver
36 boxes of Liquid Drano to this address.

388
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,630
I don't care what that says.
You're not on the list, you can't get in.

389
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,710
- I might lose my job.
- That's not my problem. Now beat it.

390
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,990
I can't reach my card.
Could you buzz this?

391
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,750
- Just buzz it. I can't reach my card.
- Wait one minute.

392
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:49,030
We're late for a party on the second floor.
Push the goddamned buzzer.

393
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,830
Thanks.

394
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:22,270
Anybody remember how to defeat
an electronic keypad?

395
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,430
Don't even joke about that.
Those things are impossible.

396
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,470
Think I'm joking?
Looks like they just put it in.

397
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,390
Oh, boy.

398
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,990
This might help. An old buddy of mine
who was in Desert Storm sent it to me.

399
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,950
'Course, he was on the other side.

400
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,870
<i>Come on. There's got to be
a way around these things.</i>

401
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,230
All right, all right.

402
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,750
This might work.

403
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,230
Yeah. Yeah.

404
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,230
Right.

405
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,310
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

406
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,430
It worked.

407
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,150
Got it.

408
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:52,550
- Gunter? You're not...
- God, no. Here you go. Nice to see you.

409
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,470
- Who the hell is that?
- Battle stations.

410
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:00,030
Monitor the audio. Grab the mike.

411
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,070
Okay.

412
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,590
I'm gonna remove my hand now.
Please, don't scream.

413
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,670
I promise, nothing will happen to you.

414
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,310
Okay?

415
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,350
Who are you?

416
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,110
- He's a PI.
- You're a private investigator.

417
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,550
- I'm a private investigator.
- But why?

418
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,830
Who hired you?

419
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,230
- Who hired you?
- Mrs. Janek.

420
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:37,910
There is not Mrs. Janek.

421
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,470
Yeah?

422
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,510
You got us stumped.

423
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:50,550
Oh, yeah? Who do you think paid
for your little love jaunt to Mexico City?

424
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,870
That was good.

425
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,230
Velma Janek.

426
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:02,150
She lives in Montreal where she handles
her family's real estate holdings...

427
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:05,710
...vast real estate holdings:
Farms, banks, shopping malls.

428
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,510
Two shopping malls.

429
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,990
She supports Gunter but figured he
was cheating. That's why she hired me.

430
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,430
Bastard liar!

431
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,310
- I'll kill him!
- No, no, no!

432
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,950
No, don't. Get a hold
of yourself, Dr. Rhyzkov.

433
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,870
Get a hold of yourself.

434
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,030
You gotta not tell him you know.

435
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,150
We weren't here. We didn't talk.
You don't know me.

436
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,310
You don't know anything about a wife.

437
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:34,950
You just give me one good reason why.

438
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,390
I'll give you a reason.

439
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,310
Give you a really good reason.

440
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,990
It's just what she'd want you to do.

441
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,950
It's just what she'd want you to do.

442
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,950
It's just what she'd want you to do.

443
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,190
I don't understand.

444
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,710
Yeah, sometimes
I don't understand myself.

445
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,550
Look, I might lose my license for this...

446
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:05,150
...but my client is
a vindictive, bitter woman.

447
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:09,950
She's been withholding marital favors
for years and now she's out to ruin him.

448
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,390
And she's using you to get to her.

449
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,830
And she's using me to get to you.

450
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,430
I know that's confusing,
but don't you see what's happening here?

451
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:25,110
You and me,
we're pawns in this ugly little game.

452
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,550
- If you love him...
- If you love him...

453
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,790
If you love him...

454
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,190
...if you really love him...

455
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,030
...then just keep on loving him.

456
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:45,670
Never let him know that you know what
he thinks you don't know that you know.

457
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,670
You know?

458
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,710
And give him head whenever he wants.

459
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,390
Give him help.

460
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:58,950
Be a beacon in his sad and lonely life.

461
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,030
Can you do that for Gunter?

462
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:05,910
- Yes, yes, I can. I can.
- Okay, good.

463
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,230
Now get outta here.

464
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,190
Give him head?

465
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,470
Be a beacon?

466
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,310
The key meeting took place July 1, 1958.

467
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,390
The Air Force brought this space visitor
to the White House...

468
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,390
...for an interview with Eisenhower.

469
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,470
Ike said, "Give us technology,
we'll give you all the cow lips you want. "

470
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,830
Don't listen to this man. He's certifiable.

471
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,990
Your husband knows
about cattle mutilations.

472
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,270
He's ex-CIA. He knows the government's
been suppressing for years.

473
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,750
Understood, understood.

474
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,430
One thing I don't quite get, though...

475
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:24,230
...was you and Cosmo,
you were taking all these big chances...

476
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,790
...what for?

477
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,710
We were young. And there was a war on.

478
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,910
- It was a good way to meet girls.
- I'll bet.

479
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,030
How come you didn't get caught?

480
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,270
I went out for pizza.

481
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,070
Then I went to Canada.

482
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,590
I was lucky. He wasn't.

483
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,110
Did he ever forgive you?

484
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:57,190
I hope so.

485
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,590
He died in prison.

486
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:12,110
So, what are you guys gonna do
with your share of the money?

487
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,790
Don?

488
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,070
We have never been to Europe together.

489
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,670
And we are going.

490
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,710
- Madrid, Lisbon.
- Athens and Scotland.

491
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,910
- And Tahiti.
- Yes, yes.

492
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,070
- Mother?
- Well, you know...

493
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,510
...I've never actually had a really cool car
that I could fit comfortably into.

494
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,390
So I think I'm gonna buy me a Winnebago...

495
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:45,750
...with a big kitchen, water bed.
Big kitchen.

496
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,070
Carl?

497
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,190
I'd like to have a deep relationship...

498
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:55,190
...with a beautiful woman, who melts
from the very first time our eyes meet.

499
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:58,510
We're not getting paid that much, Carl.

500
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,870
Well, you know, someone like Liz.

501
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,350
You're definitely
not getting paid that much.

502
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,550
Whistler?

503
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,950
Peace on earth, goodwill toward men.

504
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,990
Right on.

505
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,790
And women.

506
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,270
- All right.
- Hear, hear!

507
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,630
- That's not a word, "scrunchy".
- Yes, it is.

508
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,150
- Scrunchy is not a word.
- Scrunchy is a word.

509
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,310
- Since when?
- Know what happens to your face?

510
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,030
- It's not a word.
- Right now your face is scrunchy.

511
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,430
All right. We gotta take it as a word.

512
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,590
- I have...
- I didn't invent the word.

513
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,950
- Carl?
- Yes?

514
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,470
What does it say where this is?

515
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,910
Hold on a second here.

516
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,030
"System out. "

517
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,750
Guys...

518
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:06,390
...I really think you should
leave that thing alone.

519
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:12,030
Yeah, I know. I just wanted
to see something. Don't worry, Don.

520
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:17,670
- How are they spelling Setec?
- S-E-T-E-C. Setec.

521
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,230
Special extraterrestrial?

522
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:24,790
Earthling counter.

523
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,270
Is that right? Two, four, five.

524
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,350
And she begins to go,
and this one bull turns around...

525
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,110
...and looks at me
like right dead in my eye.

526
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,790
- Setec.
- What?

527
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,430
Setec Astronomy.

528
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,830
I just love it when a man says that to me.

529
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:49,390
Setec doesn't mean anything.

530
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,790
Excuse me.

531
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,110
Carl...

532
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:27,990
...can you get me some cable
and that I/O interface, please?

533
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,430
"Monterey's coast. "

534
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:43,830
Does "Monterey's coast"
mean anything to you guys?

535
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,110
- No.
- No.

536
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,070
Here, help me with this.

537
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:05,190
Carl, get the diagnostics.

538
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:15,110
How about "my Socrates note"?

539
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,110
No.

540
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,030
- No, I don't...
- No. No.

541
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,830
Got it. Move to another one.

542
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,670
Give me another one.

543
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,750
Stay in that quadrant.

544
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:16,350
It's kind of the same thing.
Try another quadrant.

545
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,030
Mother, what was that? Go back one.

546
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,950
All right.

547
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,790
Holy cow.

548
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:31,750
What the hell is this?

549
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,630
"Too many secrets. "

550
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:57,190
Bish, I think you better come over here.

551
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:00,070
- Carl, got your black book?
- Yes.

552
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:04,990
Give me the number
for something impossible to access.

553
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,670
Okay. What about this?

554
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,190
Federal Reserve Transfer Node,
Culpepper, Virginia.

555
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,510
- Yeah, sure. Good luck.
- 900 billion a day go through there.

556
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,110
That'll do. Punch it in.

557
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:20,310
Okay. We won't get in.

558
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,710
It's encrypted.

559
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,350
See?

560
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,910
Mother, that last contact.

561
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,630
Look at this, boys.

562
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:50,030
Anybody want to shut down
the Federal Reserve?

563
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,190
- Don't screw around with that thing!
- Wait.

564
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:57,550
- Carl, what else you got?
- National power grid?

565
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:01,110
Okay.

566
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:08,430
Here we come. Hey, Mother.

567
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:11,670
Probing.

568
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:17,710
Unbelievable.

569
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:23,710
Anybody want to black out New England?
Carl, what else?

570
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:27,190
Air traffic control system.

571
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,030
Okay, Mother.

572
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,390
Oh, my God.

573
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:46,950
How is this possible?

574
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,070
Cryptography systems are based
on mathematical problems...

575
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,390
...so complex they cannot be solved
without a key.

576
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,910
Janek figured out a way to solve
those problems without the key...

577
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:00,910
...and he hard-wired it into that chip.
- Turn it off.

578
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:04,830
- Want to crash some passenger jets?
- I said turn it off.

579
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,830
Turn it off.

580
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,470
So it's a code-breaker.

581
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:25,710
No, it's the code-breaker.

582
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,070
No more secrets.

583
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,990
Honey, you and Melissa get your things.

584
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:42,750
- Night-night.
- Good night.

585
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,670
What time is the hand-off?

586
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,750
9:00 a. m.

587
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:59,230
Well, between now and then, we are going
to institute some security around here.

588
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,390
This is where I get off.

589
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,990
Nice to see you again. I'm out of here.

590
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:09,430
Don't take this personally, Liz...

591
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,790
...but you were the only one
who knew Martin's secret.

592
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,590
Somebody talked.

593
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:20,030
So make yourself comfortable.
We're all staying right here tonight.

594
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:21,750
No.

595
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,470
I'm getting my bag, and I'm leaving.

596
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,030
So relax, Crease.

597
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:35,870
I'll relax when we get that damn thing
out of here. Until then, you stay.

598
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:41,350
What?

599
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:47,510
There isn't a government on this planet
that wouldn't kill us all for that thing.

600
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:59,990
- Sorry.
- I see.

601
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:02,110
Carl, would you get the alarm?

602
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,830
- Mother, lock everything down.
- Unplug that thing.

603
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,550
- Kill the lights.
- You bet.

604
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:10,390
Thank you for the trust, fellas.

605
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:53,870
I really enjoyed sleeping
with all you guys. Take care.

606
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:57,430
- Bye, Liz.
- You too, Liz.

607
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,910
I hope the hand-off goes well.

608
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:17,190
I'd hate for you to have
something new to run from.

609
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,910
Martin? Time.

610
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:31,630
Yeah.

611
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,670
Morning. Any problems?

612
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,510
- Nope.
- Want a cappuccino?

613
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,230
No.

614
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:42,150
Got his check?

615
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,430
Hey, Martin!

616
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:52,670
- Telephone!
- Just a minute.

617
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:56,550
It's your mother.

618
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:14,790
She's old. Excuse me.

619
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:29,070
- Get in the car.
- What?

620
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:32,150
Get in the car.

621
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,910
I didn't get the money.

622
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:37,990
Now!

623
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,950
What are you doing?
I didn't get the money.

624
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:46,150
Janek's dead.

625
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,150
They killed him.

626
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:51,230
The NSA doesn't kill people, Martin.
Who are they?

627
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,110
You said there isn't a government
on earth that wouldn't kill for that thing.

628
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:58,150
Not ours. Who were those guys?

629
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:01,790
There's one way to find out.

630
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:25,630
They took away my home. Help me out?

631
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,990
The government took away my home.

632
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:33,870
My God.

633
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,590
Don't tell me you can't do it
because I know you can.

634
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:43,790
And don't tell me you won't do it
because I've got to have it.

635
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,110
I need to know, and I need to know now.

636
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:49,870
Guys, that federal building's been
scheduled for demolition since August.

637
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,990
Housed the Federal Trade Commission,
and Dept. Of Agriculture.

638
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,270
Been vacant for a month.

639
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,670
The NSA never had an office
in San Francisco.

640
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,350
Their West Coast operations are out
of Los Angeles.

641
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:03,110
Oh, God. Yeah, thanks.

642
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:06,790
Janek's grant is from the NSA.

643
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:10,470
How could you be so goddamn stupid?

644
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,830
Two guys show up, say they're
government, and you just buy it.

645
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:17,790
They probably were government...

646
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,030
...just not ours.

647
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:30,150
Everybody pack up whatever you can.
This place isn't safe.

648
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:35,310
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to a concert.

649
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:01,590
Keep smiling.

650
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:07,190
- Martin, have you lost your mind?
- Excuse yourself.

651
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:12,430
Darling, would you excuse me
for a moment?

652
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:30,350
- Give me back Janek's box, Greg.
- Martin, I don't have it.

653
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:33,910
- Now you must believe me.
- No.

654
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,670
You set me up, Greg.
No, I do not believe you.

655
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:39,430
We had nothing to do
with this Janek business.

656
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,990
Not for lack of trying, mind you.

657
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,510
Your codes are entirely different from ours.

658
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:49,870
We never had any luck in breaking them
so Lord knows, I wanted that box...

659
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:53,470
...but we did not take it.

660
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:00,310
Then who did?

661
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:05,230
What I will tell you now,
I cannot tell you in this building.

662
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:08,510
Do you understand?

663
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,670
Come.

664
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,430
Martin.

665
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:21,470
You must trust me.

666
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:32,590
- Him?
- No.

667
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,230
- Him?
- No.

668
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,830
- Him?
- No.

669
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,990
I'm afraid these books are not
as current as they used to be.

670
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,030
You still keep tabs on all our agents.

671
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,470
These are just the ones
we thought we could turn.

672
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:55,270
You know, sexual problems,
financial troubles.

673
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:59,110
Then we had financial troubles.

674
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:02,870
That's him. The older guy.

675
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:07,510
A loathsome man named Buddy Devries,
a. k.a. Buddy Weber...

676
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,190
...Buddy Wallace.
- Wallace. That's him.

677
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:14,670
We tried to recruit him in '83.

678
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:18,070
Drinking problem, married three times.

679
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:21,950
Left the NSA four years ago.

680
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,670
Oh, my.

681
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,710
What?

682
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,790
What?

683
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:38,310
You disappeared once before, my friend.
I suggest you do it again.

684
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:42,990
Why? Who's he workin' for?

685
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,950
Your FBI is such a pain in the ass.

686
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,230
Who's he workin' for?

687
00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:00,270
Martin, I can offer you
asylum inside this car.

688
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:03,870
Technically, it's part of the consulate.
Do you wish our protection?

689
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:08,590
What? Who is Wallace working for?

690
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:14,470
Mr. Bishop? My name is
Special Agent Bestrop, FBI.

691
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:17,750
Please, step out of the vehicle.

692
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:20,870
- Do you wish our protection?
- Mr. Bishop...

693
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:24,670
...get out of the vehicle now.

694
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:33,510
You won't know who to trust.

695
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:42,830
Mr. Bishop, step over here, please.
Hands on the wall, sir.

696
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,110
Is this loaded?

697
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,030
Yes.

698
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:24,470
Too many secrets.

699
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:40,910
- Oh, shit.
- What are you doin' up?

700
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:34,740
Pain?

701
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,820
Yeah.

702
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,540
Try aspirin.

703
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,620
Cosmo.

704
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,300
I'm sorry if he hurt you.

705
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:07,820
I'm afraid Wallace doesn't
like you very much.

706
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,460
You ought to have that guy
checked for rabies.

707
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:15,460
Rabies occurs only
in warm-blooded animals.

708
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,860
Anyway, I couldn't have you talking
to the Russians.

709
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,780
Five years ago, yes, we could trust them
not to go running to the FBI...

710
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:27,700
...or if they did, we could trust the FBI
not to believe them. Today...

711
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,100
...we can't trust anybody.

712
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:32,940
What the hell's goin' on here?

713
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:37,540
Cosmo, what happened?

714
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:43,820
The world changed on us, Marty,
and without our help.

715
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:47,300
What happened?

716
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,420
There I was in prison...

717
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:59,820
...and one day I help some nice older
gentlemen make some free phone calls.

718
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:05,580
They turn out to be, let us say,
good family men.

719
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:10,980
- Organized crime?
- Don't kid yourself.

720
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,460
It's not that organized.

721
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,300
Anyway, they arranged for me...

722
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,780
...to get an early release
from my unfortunate incarceration...

723
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,660
...and I began to perform
a variety of services.

724
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,940
For starters, I reorganized
their entire financial operation:

725
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,820
Budgets, payroll,
money laundering, you name it.

726
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:33,340
The whole network is protected
by a very powerful encryption system...

727
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,220
...so the government can't read it.

728
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,500
But if the feds get Janek's box...

729
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:44,740
Disaster. Therefore, we must have it.

730
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:50,300
- To protect the organization.
- Yes.

731
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:54,660
No, I don't buy it.

732
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,740
I know you.

733
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:02,220
God, it's good to see you.

734
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:17,580
We were going to change the world,
Marty, remember?

735
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,700
Did you ever get around
to actually doing it? No, I guess not.

736
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:25,500
- Well, I think I can.
- Really?

737
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,460
Yes.

738
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,100
What's wrong with this country, Marty?

739
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,660
Money. You taught me that.

740
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,140
Evil defense contractors had it,
noble causes did not.

741
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,660
Politicians are bought and sold like
so much chattel. Our problems multiply.

742
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,100
Pollution, crime, drugs, poverty,
disease, hunger, despair.

743
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:51,620
We throw gobs of money at them.

744
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,660
The problems always get worse.
Why is that?

745
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,740
Money's most powerful ability is to allow
bad people to do bad things...

746
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,300
...at the expense of those
who don't have it.

747
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,260
I agree.

748
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,580
- Who did you say you were working for?
- That's just my day job.

749
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:11,060
While in prison, I learned everything
in this world, including money...

750
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:16,580
...operates not on reality...
- But the perception of reality.

751
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:21,780
Posit: People think a bank
might be financially shaky.

752
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,420
- Consequence:
- People start to withdraw their money.

753
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:29,620
- Result: Soon, it is financially shaky.
- Conclusion: You can make banks fail.

754
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:34,540
I've already done that.
Maybe you've read about a few?

755
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:35,540
Think bigger.

756
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:36,860
- Stock market?
- Yes.

757
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,540
- Currency market? Commodities market?
- Yes.

758
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:42,820
Small countries?

759
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:48,780
I might even be able to crash
the whole damn system.

760
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:52,860
Destroy all records of ownership.
Think of it, Marty.

761
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,820
No more rich people, no more poor people,
everybody's the same.

762
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:00,780
Isn't that what we said we always wanted?

763
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,420
Cos, you haven't gone crazy
on me, have you?

764
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,940
Who else is going
to change the world, Marty?

765
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:10,220
Greenpeace?

766
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:18,540
You are crazy.

767
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,460
Tomorrow they'll retrieve
your fingerprints...

768
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,260
...from the gun that killed
a Russian consular officer.

769
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:32,300
The following day, those prints will be run
through an FBI computer...

770
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:35,900
...and they will come up with a name.

771
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,740
Martin Brice...

772
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:45,420
...my old and good friend, who promised
me we would not get in trouble...

773
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,940
...and who, I might add, didn't.

774
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,860
Then they'll check this database
in Washington, D. C...

775
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,980
...which I'm now able to access,
thanks to you.

776
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:59,340
Of course, no one knows
where Martin Brice is, do they?

777
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:03,980
But what if this indicated...

778
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:09,140
...an alias?

779
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:14,900
Don't. Don't do it, Cos.

780
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,980
Pain?

781
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,860
Try prison.

782
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,140
Ciao.

783
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:34,220
- Oh, no, not the head.
- Just relax.

784
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:37,700
No more secrets, Marty.

785
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,540
- I've had a bad night.
- Really?

786
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:35,580
- You look terrific.
- You look awful.

787
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:38,380
I should think so,
considering what I've been through.

788
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,500
- What happened?
- You tell me.

789
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:46,900
You got hit over the head twice
and got thrown out of a speeding car.

790
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:50,380
Here, let me do this.

791
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,260
I'm sorry.

792
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,580
It's okay. L...

793
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:04,660
I'm sorry.

794
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:16,420
The paper said that Greg was killed.

795
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,620
I called your number,
and someone else answered.

796
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:23,740
I didn't recognize the voice.

797
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,260
I can't do this alone, Liz.

798
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:41,580
I'm here.

799
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:01,660
We have to meet.

800
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,780
<i>The FBI says the fingerprints
found in the embassy car...</i>

801
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:08,300
<i>...match those taken from the office
of a government researcher...</i>

802
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:10,980
<i>...found murdered earlier this week
in Palo Alto.</i>

803
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,340
<i>The connection was made after
a Bay Area radio station received...</i>

804
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,220
<i>...an anonymous tip
linking the two killings.</i>

805
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,740
I'll bet it was anonymous!
The son of a bitch.

806
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,900
All right, it's time we call the authorities.

807
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:27,660
Great. Now that we're accessories
to espionage and murder.

808
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:31,700
All the more reason to turn ourselves
in now while we can still cut a deal.

809
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:36,020
With what? We got bupkus! They'll give
us 20 years in the electric chair.

810
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:40,220
You think I like it? I've got a family!
We have no other choice.

811
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,860
Yes, we do.

812
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:47,220
We make the call, but we make it our way.

813
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,380
Unload the van.

814
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:53,660
We got these band wideners here, Whis.
Where do you want 'em?

815
01:09:55,860 --> 01:10:00,500
Thanks. Nice apartment.

816
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,660
I'll bounce this call
through nine relay stations...

817
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:07,180
...around the world and off two satellites.

818
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:10,300
It'll be the hardest trace
they've ever heard.

819
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,420
This'll measure stress
in the voice on the other end.

820
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,940
Not as accurate as a polygraph, but it'll do.

821
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:21,940
- Unbelievable.
- Let's do it.

822
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:34,900
<i>Fort Meade, Maryland. Good afternoon.</i>

823
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:36,620
Try Director of Ops.

824
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:40,180
National Security Agency,
Director of Operations, please.

825
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:44,220
<i>- What extension, please?
- I'm sorry. I forget the number.</i>

826
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:47,260
Could I have Director of Operations?
It's very important.

827
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,180
<i>What extension, please?</i>

828
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,340
Try Research.

829
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,860
Gimme Research. It's an emergency.

830
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,660
<i>I need an extension or a name.</i>

831
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:03,820
Setec Astronomy.

832
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,580
<i>One moment, please.</i>

833
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,340
They've started the trace.

834
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:12,340
<i>Who is this, please?</i>

835
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:15,020
It's my dime. I'll ask the questions.
Who are you?

836
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:20,340
<i>- Let's say my name is Mr. Abbott.
- True.</i>

837
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:23,980
- They made the second leg.
- Mr. Abbott...

838
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:26,540
...are you interested in Setec Astronomy?

839
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:30,860
<i>I'm interested in all kinds of astronomy.</i>

840
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,940
- Cute.
- They've got the satellite in Tokyo.

841
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:39,260
These guys are good.

842
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,780
I need to know if you're someone
who can make a deal.

843
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:46,700
<i>- Go on.
- Can you deal?</i>

844
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,980
<i>- Yes.
- True.</i>

845
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:52,020
They're across Transcom.
You've got about 20 seconds, Bish.

846
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,460
If I come in, can you guarantee my safety?

847
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,900
<i>Do you have the item?</i>

848
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:02,260
- No.
- Fifteen seconds.

849
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,580
<i>- Can you guarantee my safety?
- Where is the item?</i>

850
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,300
- Can you guarantee my safety?
- Five seconds.

851
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:12,220
- Yes, I can guarantee your safety.
- Bish, he's lying.

852
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,820
- Hang up. They've almost got us.
- He's lying!

853
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:19,580
- Hang up, Bish! Hang up!
- He's lying! He's lying!

854
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,820
There's gotta be a way to cut a deal.

855
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,460
Too late.

856
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,420
If we had the box, yes. Without it, no.

857
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:37,580
So let's get this friggin' thing.

858
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:41,380
- I don't know where it is.
- What did it sound like?

859
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:44,500
- No idea where they took you?
- No.

860
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,940
They threw me in a trunk,
drove around in circles.

861
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:51,300
It could be 100 miles away,
underground, in a sky-rise. Forget it.

862
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:54,140
- Bish, what did it sound like?
- What?

863
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:59,060
The road. When you were in the trunk,
what did the road sound like?

864
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:02,260
Well, I don't...
Highway. A regular highway.

865
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:06,780
Did you go over
any speed bumps? Gravel?

866
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:10,060
How about a bridge?

867
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:14,380
- Bridge, yeah.
- Four bridges in the Bay Area.

868
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:17,180
Was the Golden Gate fogged in last night?

869
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:21,100
- Yes.
- Did you hear a foghorn?

870
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:24,300
No.

871
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,020
- Scratch the Golden Gate.
- That leaves three.

872
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:30,460
What did it sound like?
Did you go through a tunnel?

873
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,660
I'm not... No.

874
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,380
Scratch the Bay.

875
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:40,140
That leaves two.
San Mateo and Dunbarton.

876
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,540
What did it sound like?

877
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:48,820
Lower.

878
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:53,020
Lower.

879
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,300
There was a recurring sound.

880
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:05,540
Like seams in the concrete.

881
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:15,460
But further apart.

882
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,820
Yeah.

883
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:41,740
- Now what?
- Bumps. Rough ones.

884
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,820
- Railroad tracks.
- Yeah, yeah.

885
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:48,340
A right on Antrim and a left on 84.

886
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:52,500
And then what did you hear?

887
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:56,700
- A cocktail party.
- What?

888
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,940
Drove through what sounded...

889
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:05,300
It sounded like a cocktail party.

890
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,540
There was chattering.
It was right at the end.

891
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:10,140
Great. Now we got to look
for a cocktail party...

892
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,260
...on the other side of the railroad track.

893
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:15,780
What's the exit
where the railroad tracks are?

894
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:16,740
Crescent.

895
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,540
Mother, stay on Crescent,
get off at the reservoir.

896
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,780
Okay.

897
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:25,500
There's a cocktail party at the reservoir?

898
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:30,660
Yeah. Yeah.

899
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:38,100
Very good, Bish. Remind me to make you
an honorary blind person.

900
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,260
Great.

901
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:45,380
Where's this road go?

902
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:49,740
Nowhere. Looks like it ends
right around that hill.

903
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:55,580
- What's behind the hill?
- Nothing. It's private property.

904
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,460
Private.

905
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:31,620
Forget it. It's a toy company.

906
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:34,660
Toy company, my ass. That's laser fencing.

907
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:39,460
There's high voltage on the perimeter.
The whole building says "go away".

908
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,860
It's Cosmo. I know it.
The toy company's a front.

909
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:49,100
Mother, get the directional.
Carl, get the video. Let's go.

910
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:58,580
- Second floor, northwest two.
- That's a bathroom.

911
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:02,580
Second floor, northwest three.

912
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:06,380
- That's an emergency exit.
- How do you know that?

913
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:11,700
I can hear the emergency
floodlight batteries recharging.

914
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:15,780
Hold it right there.
Crease, what's this mean?

915
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,740
"My voice is my passport. Verify me. "

916
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:23,500
Some sort of voiceprint ID.
I'll check it out.

917
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:31,740
- What am I listening to now, Mother?
- Third floor, southwest corner.

918
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,540
It's bursting with ultrasonic.

919
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,900
I've never heard sensors
that powerful before.

920
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:42,740
Bish, someone is very serious
about keeping people out of that room.

921
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:45,860
Yeah.

922
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,580
There's the corner room...

923
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,980
...with the motion detectors
Whistler heard.

924
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,340
That's Cosmo's office. I saw the sensors.

925
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,180
They keep the lights on all night...

926
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:08,020
...so we must assume sensors are on, too.
It won't be easy getting in there.

927
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:13,020
Run this on ahead.
Let's figure out who works next door.

928
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:18,340
It's fascinating what $50 can get you
at the county recorder's office.

929
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:22,020
- What do you got?
- PlayTronics' corporate headquarters.

930
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,980
- The complete blueprints.
- Not bad.

931
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:28,620
- Not bad, Carl.
- Thanks.

932
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,100
Where'd you get the $50?

933
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:34,060
- I took it from Mother's wallet.
- Good.

934
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:38,460
No, Mom, today's not a good day
to come over.

935
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,700
Okay, what have we got here?

936
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:44,580
It's called a Man-Trap. I borrowed
this demo from the manufacturer.

937
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:48,580
It's a digital voice-recognition monitor
hooked up to an access booth.

938
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:56,140
NSA uses this to keep people out of
restricted areas at Fort Meade. Card?

939
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:03,860
- Now speak right into this box.
- Hi.

940
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,420
My name is Martin Bishop.

941
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:10,620
My voice is my passport. Verify me.

942
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,100
You can't pass through...

943
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,180
...unless your voiceprint matches
the one encoded on the card.

944
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:19,420
- So we need someone's card.
- And their voice.

945
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,980
- Can we beat this with tape?
- Has to be up close and personal.

946
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:25,980
Otherwise you'll be caught
in a steel-reinforced booth...

947
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,620
...while the guards
with the shotguns are called.

948
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:29,780
That's great.

949
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,580
What about motion detectors?

950
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,420
I'm picking one up this afternoon.

951
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:37,940
That makes beating this look easy.

952
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,540
Hey, Bish, I think we've found our guy.

953
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:45,580
Okay, I've blown up the image a little.
Here's the room next to Cosmo's.

954
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:49,220
Now it's the end of the day.
Watch who comes out.

955
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:52,380
Let me zoom in on the front door.

956
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:55,260
A lady in a green skirt...

957
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,820
...and this guy with the cap.

958
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:00,420
Nobody comes out for another 18 minutes.

959
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,220
- So it's one of those two.
- Right.

960
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:06,140
Here's the next evening. Again...

961
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:11,180
...the office next to Cosmo's.
Lights go out.

962
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,260
The guy in the cap. Anybody else?

963
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,380
Nobody else comes out for 22 minutes.
That's who works next door.

964
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:23,380
We'll use his office to get into Cosmo's.
Can we get plates?

965
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:26,340
Let me see.

966
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,540
Zooming in.

967
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:35,060
Another bump. Enhancing.

968
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:40,100
There's your plate. 180 IQ.

969
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:46,100
Cute. All right, Carl, let's do this guy.

970
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,500
His name's Werner Brandes.

971
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:51,940
Single, 6'1", 174 pounds,
must wear glasses to drive...

972
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,580
...no outstanding tickets or warrants.

973
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:57,660
He leaves work
between 6:00 and 7:00 every night...

974
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,460
...takes the same route home,
obeys the speed limit...

975
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:04,940
...comes to a complete stop at every stop
sign and signals when he changes lanes.

976
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:07,620
He's a very safe driver.

977
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:12,020
$750 limit on his Visa, pays his bills.

978
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,500
No bad debts, no bum checks.

979
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:19,060
No firearms. Member, International
Microchip Designers Association...

980
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:21,740
...and chairman of the social committee.

981
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,900
Great. The world's most boring human.

982
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:30,140
How the hell are we going to get
close enough to record him?

983
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:34,340
Oh, Mother.

984
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:39,660
Sorry, Liz. Standard procedure.
Trash from the guy's house.

985
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:43,940
And thank you for bringing it into mine.

986
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:50,180
Okay, let's see here.
Phone bill, no long distance.

987
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:54,060
Club Med brochure.

988
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:58,540
A ticket stub to a Barry Manilow concert.

989
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:02,140
Here it is. Here we go.

990
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:07,620
"Dear Compudater: Welcome to
the world of automated compatibility. "

991
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:11,300
- He's a computer dater.
- I love it. Let's get him a date.

992
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:15,180
What was the name of that gal we used
on the cereal company sneak last year?

993
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:18,300
Sandy Krieger? Forget it. Married a cop.

994
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:22,540
How about Barbara? Now, she was cute.

995
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:25,820
Yeah, but she'd never do it.
She regards this work as juvenile.

996
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:29,380
That's why she divorced me.
How about your friend Jessie?

997
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:32,260
- Yeah, she's buff.
- Fellas.

998
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:38,020
Fellas, look at this man's trash.
He's not looking for buff.

999
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:40,500
It's the nicest garbage I've ever seen.

1000
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,820
The man who folded this tube of Crest...

1001
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:48,780
...is looking for someone meticulous,
refined, anal.

1002
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:56,580
What?

1003
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:18,100
Werner? Hi.

1004
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:20,820
I'm Doris.

1005
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,420
Hi.

1006
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,780
Are you ready for the dim sum bar?

1007
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:28,300
I'm not really in any hurry.

1008
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:32,540
All right. I'll be right back.

1009
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,540
So.

1010
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:03,180
What an interesting name you have.

1011
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:07,060
How exactly do you pronounce it?

1012
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:19,060
This is what's in Cosmo's office.

1013
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:24,420
The best motion sensor on the market.

1014
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:27,780
Watch this.

1015
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:32,260
It also responds to thermal differentials.

1016
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,220
Does this have a happy ending?

1017
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:38,260
We can wrap you in a full body suit
of neoprene, heat-resistant rubber...

1018
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,500
...or raise the temperature
in Cosmo's office to 98.6 degrees...

1019
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:45,140
...which is probably what we'll do.
The neoprene would suffocate you.

1020
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,860
Either way, you've got a top speed of...

1021
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:51,260
...two inches per second.

1022
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,060
Any faster than that...

1023
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:56,500
...and big guys with guns.

1024
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:59,860
- You'll probably do fine.
- Since when am I the one...

1025
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:03,220
This is the same answering machine
Janek used for his box.

1026
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,980
That's what you'll be carrying
across the floor at two inches per second.

1027
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:11,300
I got that for you because I figured
you'd just want to practice with it.

1028
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:14,140
Remember to go real slow!

1029
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:16,900
Slow.

1030
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:22,540
You get all the fun stuff.

1031
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,340
So, what about travel?

1032
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:45,500
Where do you like to go?
Europe? Mexico?

1033
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,140
I don't know.
I've never been out of the country.

1034
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:49,980
I think they want us to leave.

1035
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:53,220
Sit down, Werner.

1036
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:55,820
Talk to me.

1037
01:25:56,100 --> 01:26:01,020
You know what?
I really love the sound of your voice.

1038
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:02,900
Really?

1039
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:06,180
I always thought it was kind of nasal
and pinched.

1040
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,620
No, not at all. It's lovely.

1041
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:12,380
And there's this one word.

1042
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:16,820
I've always loved the sound of this word.

1043
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,980
- Oh, no!
- No, what? What?

1044
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:22,380
- You wouldn't. Never mind.
- I would. What? What, please?

1045
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:24,500
All right.

1046
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:30,660
I would really like to hear you
say the word...

1047
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,860
..."passport".

1048
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,140
Passport?

1049
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,820
You know, you're right. We ought to leave.

1050
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,980
Doris?

1051
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:51,500
Would you like to have breakfast with me?

1052
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:54,140
Sure, fine.

1053
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:58,100
Shall I phone you or nudge you?

1054
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:02,460
Check, please.

1055
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:15,060
<i>Hi. My name is Werner Brandes.</i>

1056
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:20,380
<i>My voice is my passport.
Verify me. Thank you.</i>

1057
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:44,540
Is that the gardener?
I thought they already left.

1058
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:47,740
I guess not.

1059
01:27:56,580 --> 01:28:00,380
May I use your john, please?

1060
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:12,980
Listen, a few minutes ago,
a gardener came...

1061
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:18,220
Skip it. I see him.

1062
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:25,340
Okay, fellas, I'm outta here.

1063
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:29,780
Carl, have a nice ride.

1064
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:10,020
It's hot in here.

1065
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:13,980
Maybe I'll just open this window a bit.

1066
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:19,220
I'll join you as soon as I'm through
pounding these breasts.

1067
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,700
Do you know,
the best thing about this meal...

1068
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:26,100
...besides it's absolutely fabulous...

1069
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,740
...is that it only has 400 calories.
- Oh, great.

1070
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:31,180
- I'm concerned about what we eat.
- You are.

1071
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,900
What would you say is the ideal diet?

1072
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,540
I sort of eat on the run.

1073
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:39,860
I'm really busy, so...

1074
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:45,180
The ideal diet, don't laugh,
is the bottom of a monkey cage.

1075
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:49,100
- I'm sorry?
- Look at the bottom of a monkey cage.

1076
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:51,540
Is someone answering your door?

1077
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:55,900
Just a second. I'm not expecting anyone.

1078
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:01,420
No. Nobody there.

1079
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:05,100
- I'm sorry.
- We're all alone.

1080
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:09,900
I'll just close the window. It's okay now.

1081
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:11,340
It's true. I read that once.

1082
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:13,620
I don't know.
What were we talking about?

1083
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:18,220
You have fruit, greens...

1084
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:24,100
Good evening. PlayTronics.

1085
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:50,540
Cattle mutilations are up.

1086
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:54,820
- Don't.
- Sorry.

1087
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:23,260
Here we go.

1088
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,260
Martin, we've got video. All eight of them.

1089
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,180
You're coming in fine.

1090
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:32,620
You are clear all the way up
to the Man-Trap.

1091
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:11,140
<i>Hi, my name is Werner Brandes.</i>

1092
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:15,940
<i>My voice is my passport. Verify me.</i>

1093
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:52,340
There's a three-foot area in the corner,
just outside the sensor's range.

1094
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:55,140
Good. Hold on. Whistler?

1095
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:59,860
- Carl, how's the weather?
- 98.6 and holding.

1096
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:04,100
Beauty. We got body temp, Crease.

1097
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:06,860
Go.

1098
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:30,140
Once again, I am so sorry about dinner.

1099
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:32,260
No, it was really delicious.

1100
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:35,660
No, no. I overcooked the carrots.

1101
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:40,860
No, I liked them really squishy like that.

1102
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:44,180
- That's cute.
- Watch.

1103
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:47,260
Watch this.

1104
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:53,540
Play dead.

1105
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:56,220
Great!

1106
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:58,980
I designed the voice recognition chip.

1107
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:01,100
What a thing to do!

1108
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:04,660
- Could I just make a quick phone call?
- Sure.

1109
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:08,020
- It's in the bedroom.
- Upstairs?

1110
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:12,780
Yeah, just go upstairs
and then walk straight forward.

1111
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:17,220
The first one is a closet.

1112
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:19,500
Pooch.

1113
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:23,860
Look what you've done to Doris' purse.

1114
01:36:54,460 --> 01:36:59,220
What do you say we go for a ride, Doris?

1115
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:18,300
I don't believe this!

1116
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:20,860
What are you saying?
The NSA killed Kennedy?

1117
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:25,340
No, they shot him, but they didn't kill him.
He's still alive.

1118
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,580
That's it. I've had it.

1119
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:29,780
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

1120
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:33,940
- Do your job. I don't want to talk.
- Okay, fine.

1121
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:38,380
It was the same people
who framed Pete Rose.

1122
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:42,420
Boy, this was fun. Wanna go back?

1123
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:47,380
- No, we're almost there.
- Almost where?

1124
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:54,500
- Forget it. Forget it.
- No, Crease.

1125
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:58,980
Werner just pulled up.
He's got Liz with him.

1126
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:05,700
Martin? I think you'd better hurry.

1127
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:13,060
The one thing I can't do is hurry.

1128
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,860
"I want you to say it for me just one time. "

1129
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:42,220
"Passport.
You have such a beautiful voice. "

1130
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:44,100
I'm Dr. Brandes. I work on three.

1131
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:47,740
I believe this phony is involved
in some plot to break into my office.

1132
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:52,900
Hold it! Hold it!
Let me see your entry card.

1133
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:57,340
- You took my card.
- What card? See?

1134
01:38:57,580 --> 01:39:00,620
Sir, we have a problem.

1135
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:27,100
- What?
- Call the police.

1136
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:32,100
I think that someone
is trying to break into my office!

1137
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:35,980
Let's take a look at his office.

1138
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:22,500
Well?

1139
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:25,700
Well, everything seems to be in order.

1140
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:29,140
- Does it?
- Yes, sir.

1141
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:35,340
- Very sorry to have troubled you, miss.
- Not as sorry as I am.

1142
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:38,660
Werner.

1143
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:47,500
They're letting her go.

1144
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:50,300
- We'll call you a cab.
- Thank you.

1145
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:54,340
This is my last computer date.

1146
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:58,180
Wait.

1147
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:03,900
A computer matched her with him?
I don't think so.

1148
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:10,420
Marty.

1149
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:21,700
Why is it so hot in here?

1150
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:33,900
Marty!

1151
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:41,900
We've got six guards in the front lobby...

1152
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:44,900
...four in the south corridor,
five upstairs north.

1153
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:47,580
- Guards in the boiler room.
- Oh, God.

1154
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:51,220
Carl, listen carefully. You've got trouble.

1155
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:53,220
Heating duct's over the furnace.

1156
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:56,380
You'll be all right.
Find the heating ducts above the furnace.

1157
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:59,060
That'll lead you to the elevator.

1158
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:01,740
There's a fire escape
at the end of the north corridor.

1159
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:04,300
- There are fire walls.
- Have him go south.

1160
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:08,260
No, go directly north, 30 yards.

1161
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,380
Once you're there, let me know.

1162
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:13,940
Blue team, move to corridor one.
Green team, secure north corridor.

1163
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:19,300
He'll be in a crawl space. Break through.

1164
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:33,380
Crease?

1165
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:35,900
I'm in northeast three, over the corridor.

1166
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:39,660
<i>- I think it's a dead end.
- Don't move.</i>

1167
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,820
Don't worry, we'll get you out of there.

1168
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:47,380
We've got guards at every stairwell.
Can you hear if there's any...

1169
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:54,100
Oh, no.

1170
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:58,300
What? Don't say "oh, no".

1171
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:02,340
This is Wallace.

1172
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:06,900
I'm in northeast three.
I'm gonna check it out.

1173
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:11,380
Martin, we lost...

1174
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:21,060
Do you read me?

1175
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:33,500
Damn!

1176
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:39,980
<i>Stop shooting.</i>

1177
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:43,060
Marty?

1178
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:45,620
I know you are in the building...

1179
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:49,460
<i>...and I know you can hear me.</i>

1180
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,900
<i>God.</i>

1181
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:56,500
<i>You should not have come back, Marty.</i>

1182
01:43:56,740 --> 01:43:59,380
<i>I won and you lost.</i>

1183
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:03,460
<i>If our friendship meant anything to you,
that's the way you should have left it.</i>

1184
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:07,620
<i>But you always had to be
the one to win, didn't you?</i>

1185
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:12,940
<i>You were the one who got away
with things, while I never did.</i>

1186
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:18,780
<i>You always had to get the girl, didn't you?</i>

1187
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:25,140
So I never did...

1188
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:30,860
...at least not until now.

1189
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:37,900
She's lovely, Marty.

1190
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,780
<i>Please.</i>

1191
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:47,900
Marty, please bring me the box.

1192
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:50,140
<i>You must know...</i>

1193
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:55,140
<i>...they will never let either of you live
if you try to get out.</i>

1194
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:58,380
<i>I am your way out.</i>

1195
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:02,620
I'm your only way out.

1196
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:07,300
<i>If I wanted you dead...</i>

1197
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:10,620
<i>...you'd be dead.</i>

1198
01:45:10,740 --> 01:45:12,620
<i>Marty...</i>

1199
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:16,020
...I cannot kill you.

1200
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:19,860
I cannot kill you.

1201
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:26,100
You have to trust me.

1202
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:32,740
Guys, I'm goin' in.

1203
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:36,100
Do you hear me, Carl?

1204
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:39,700
Yes.

1205
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:02,140
- Hi.
- Hi.

1206
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:06,860
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

1207
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:13,820
So you have my box.

1208
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:20,860
We have a deal.

1209
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:24,180
Right?

1210
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:29,220
Wait a second.

1211
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:32,300
Wait a minute!

1212
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:36,220
Goddamn it, you gave me your word!

1213
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:47,660
I cannot kill my friend.

1214
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:53,260
Kill my friend.

1215
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:57,980
You son of a bitch.

1216
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:02,540
You didn't really think we were gonna
let you go, did you?

1217
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:06,420
You didn't really think I was gonna
let you have this box, did you?

1218
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:09,220
- What?
- Now.

1219
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:12,340
Now? What are you talking about now?

1220
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:17,180
- Now!
- You're damn right, now!

1221
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:20,980
- Carl, now!
- Geronimo!

1222
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:30,180
Let go of him.

1223
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:34,140
I mean it. I'm an excellent marksman.

1224
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:37,740
Woman! Move!

1225
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:41,340
Sure. Sure.

1226
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:46,140
Get up.

1227
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:56,940
- What the hell were you waiting for?
- That's not easy, what I just did.

1228
01:47:57,180 --> 01:48:00,900
- Guys, could we get out of here?
- Yeah.

1229
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:04,140
Here.

1230
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:08,860
- Up, up, up!
- I'm up!

1231
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:11,740
Hurry!

1232
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:23,780
Crease, we're on the roof. There's
a fire escape on the side. Is it clear?

1233
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:26,860
Yes, clear.

1234
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:29,620
Where are you?

1235
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:32,460
<i>On a hill overlooking
the northeast corner of the lot.</i>

1236
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:36,220
- There!
- Beautiful. Come and get us.

1237
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:41,740
Hurry up. We've only got a few minutes
before anybody knows we're gone.

1238
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:45,700
Comin' to get you.

1239
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:52,540
Put your hands where
I can see 'em and step outta the van.

1240
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:55,860
You too, Midnight.

1241
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:21,260
Bish, they've got Crease and Mother.

1242
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:24,860
Shit!

1243
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:29,300
Whistler, you've got to do it.

1244
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:30,500
Do what?

1245
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:35,100
You gotta drive.
I'll talk you through it. Now, hurry.

1246
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:38,180
Drive what?

1247
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:57,060
Okay, Bish.

1248
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:59,340
There's a gate about 30 yards behind you.

1249
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:03,220
<i>Put it in reverse and floor it.</i>

1250
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:07,180
Did I ever tell you
why I had to leave the CIA?

1251
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:10,060
No.

1252
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:15,740
What's reverse?

1253
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:17,860
One down.

1254
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:21,380
My temper.

1255
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:29,100
Mess with me, I'll split your head!

1256
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:34,860
Crease, where's Whistler going?

1257
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:38,060
Bish? I'm going backwards.

1258
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:42,260
You're doin' fine. Doin' fine.

1259
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:45,580
Now, hit the brakes!

1260
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:48,500
Now!

1261
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:52,060
Okay, put the gearshift down two notches.

1262
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:56,300
Down two notches.

1263
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:59,980
<i>Turn left. Floor it.</i>

1264
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:05,180
- I'm going forward.
- Straighten out.

1265
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:10,580
- What was that?
- Okay, keep comin'.

1266
01:51:10,860 --> 01:51:14,540
Oh, God, I'm driving!

1267
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:21,820
No, don't do that. I'm driving!

1268
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:25,700
Go left!

1269
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:28,140
My left. Right.

1270
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:31,900
Go right! Right!

1271
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:38,100
It's okay.

1272
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:42,020
Beautiful! Keep comin'. Keep comin'.

1273
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:46,380
Now, you're gonna go down
a very gentle slope.

1274
01:51:46,620 --> 01:51:50,220
Okay, fine. Great. No problem.

1275
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:58,260
Doin' okay. Five more seconds...

1276
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:01,420
...and stop.

1277
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:08,220
I think I'll stop right here.

1278
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:10,900
Whistler, that was great!

1279
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:12,940
- Whistler!
- That was great!

1280
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:15,700
I'm taking the wheel. In the back.

1281
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:19,020
Where's Martin?

1282
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:24,220
Marty.

1283
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:29,980
Would you step away from the ladder?

1284
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:49,740
You will give me the box right now...

1285
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:53,700
...or I will kill you right now.

1286
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:59,700
No.

1287
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:01,900
Jesus!

1288
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:04,700
Just give me the box, Marty.

1289
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:07,540
- I thought you couldn't kill me.
- I missed on purpose!

1290
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:11,580
- Now give me the box.
- Take the damn thing! I don't want it.

1291
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:14,460
You win, I lose.
That's what you want, isn't it?

1292
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:18,220
- Say it! Say it!
- Yes.

1293
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:24,340
I'm sorry, Cos.

1294
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:26,700
- You could have shared this with me.
- I know.

1295
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:29,700
- You could have had the power.
- I don't want it.

1296
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:32,180
Don't you know the places
we can go with this?

1297
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:36,580
- Yeah, I do. There's nobody there.
- Exactly.

1298
01:53:36,820 --> 01:53:39,820
The world isn't run by weapons anymore,
or energy or money.

1299
01:53:40,060 --> 01:53:43,940
It's run by ones and zeroes,
little bits of data. It's all just electrons.

1300
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:46,220
I don't care.

1301
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:48,980
I don't expect other people
to understand this...

1302
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:51,980
...but I do expect you to understand this.

1303
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:54,660
We started this journey together.

1304
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:58,220
It wasn't a journey, Cos.

1305
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:00,820
It was a prank.

1306
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:04,220
There's a war out there,
old friend, a world war.

1307
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:06,660
And it's not about
who's got the most bullets.

1308
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:08,820
It's about who controls the information:

1309
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:11,860
...what we see and hear,
how we work, what we think.

1310
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:15,100
It's all about the information.

1311
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:19,300
If I were you, I'd destroy that thing.

1312
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:22,940
Don't go.

1313
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:29,700
Don't go.

1314
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:37,340
You do what you have to do, Cos.

1315
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:39,540
But if you want to stop me...

1316
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:43,580
...you'll have to pull the trigger.

1317
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:46,980
You.

1318
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:41,260
I can't believe we actually made it back.

1319
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:45,340
I can't believe we did the greatest sneak
in history and can't tell anybody.

1320
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:48,740
You know what I can't believe?
Tomorrow's Thursday!

1321
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:51,740
- Not one word.
- All of you, step over here.

1322
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:54,180
Hands over your head. Move!

1323
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:57,180
Move!

1324
01:55:58,820 --> 01:56:01,780
Mr. Bishop.

1325
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:13,220
I'm Bernard Abbott,
National Security Agency.

1326
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:16,140
We spoke on the phone.

1327
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:21,740
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1328
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:26,020
It's interesting, don't you think, you guys...

1329
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:28,940
...that the NSA is here?

1330
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:32,060
I thought the FBI was supposed
to do this kind of thing.

1331
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:35,740
Absolutely. This is outside
the NSA's jurisdiction.

1332
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:40,620
Unless the NSA didn't want anybody
to know about Janek's little black box.

1333
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:43,460
I keep thinking
about something Greg told me.

1334
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:46,740
He said our codes were based
on an entirely different system...

1335
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:52,340
...than the Russian codes,
so this box really wouldn't work on them.

1336
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:55,540
The only thing it would be good for
is spying on Americans.

1337
01:56:55,780 --> 01:56:58,900
Sure, with a box like that
they could read the FBI's mail.

1338
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:02,660
- Or the CIA's.
- Or the White House's.

1339
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:07,820
No wonder they don't want
to share with the other children.

1340
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:10,940
What do you want, Mr. Bishop?

1341
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:13,740
Clear up my record.

1342
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:17,380
- Get outta my life.
- I don't have much choice, do I?

1343
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:22,060
Not unless you wanna read
about it in "Newsweek".

1344
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:26,700
- Deal. The box.
- Not so fast.

1345
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,180
- I want a Winnebago.
- What?

1346
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:33,620
Fully equipped, big kitchen, water bed...

1347
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:35,820
...AM-FM, CD, microwave.

1348
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:37,780
This is not a car dealership, pal.

1349
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:41,180
He wants a Winnebago.

1350
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,300
All right, a Winnebago.

1351
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:51,460
Thank you. Burgundy interior.

1352
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:54,460
Now the box.

1353
01:57:54,580 --> 01:57:58,820
I have never taken my wife to Europe.

1354
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:01,940
I'm sorry to hear it. Give me the box.

1355
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:06,780
You will buy me two round-trip,
first-class tickets to Athens...

1356
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:10,980
...Lisbon, Madrid and Scotland.

1357
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:14,460
- Don't forget Tahiti.
- And Tahiti.

1358
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:17,820
- Tahiti is not in Europe.
- Excuse me.

1359
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:20,220
When you get the box,
give us geography lessons.

1360
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:24,060
Until then, this man goes to Tahiti.

1361
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:28,300
Fine! Tahiti!

1362
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:31,260
Carl?

1363
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:35,940
The young lady with the Uzi, is she single?

1364
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:39,180
Carl. Excuse us.

1365
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:44,860
This is the brass ring.
You gotta think bigger thoughts.

1366
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:48,820
I just want her telephone number.

1367
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:52,860
Please.

1368
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:56,740
- How about a lunch? You can chaperon.
- No.

1369
01:58:56,980 --> 01:59:01,340
- I will not do this.
- Abby, come on.

1370
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:04,220
- The FBI'd give him twins.
- No!

1371
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:07,300
Wait a second.

1372
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:13,820
You can have anything you want,
and you're asking for my phone number?

1373
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:16,780
Yes.

1374
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:19,820
273-9164...

1375
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:23,900
...area code 415.

1376
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:26,060
- I'm Carl.
- I'm Mary.

1377
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:28,140
I'm going to be sick.

1378
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:32,540
- Are we done here?
- Not yet. Whistler.

1379
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:37,900
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1380
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:40,740
- This is ridiculous.
- He's serious.

1381
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:43,300
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1382
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:47,420
We are the United States Government.
We don't do that sort of thing.

1383
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:50,580
You're just gonna have to try.

1384
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:54,220
All right, I'll see what I can do.

1385
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:56,860
Thank you very much.

1386
01:59:57,140 --> 02:00:00,220
That's all I ask.

1387
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:03,300
How about you? What do you want?

1388
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:06,940
I'm fine.

1389
02:00:09,380 --> 02:00:12,780
May I have the box?

1390
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:25,740
You know it doesn't work. It never did.

1391
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:27,540
That's not important, is it?

1392
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:31,580
What's really important is that
none of this ever happened.

1393
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:35,700
This box doesn't exist.

1394
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:38,020
I never saw it before.

1395
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:41,180
Remember that.

1396
02:00:50,060 --> 02:00:52,300
Bishop?

1397
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:56,260
All you did was say it was broken.

1398
02:00:56,500 --> 02:01:02,100
Can't they still just hook it up
and do terrible things with it?

1399
02:01:03,620 --> 02:01:05,260
Nope.

1400
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:08,580
<i>In a surprise announcement,
the Republican National Committee...</i>

1401
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:10,660
<i>...has revealed it is bankrupt.</i>

1402
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:14,900
<i>A spokesman said they had plenty
of money in their accounts last week...</i>

1403
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:18,220
<i>...but today they just don't know
where the money has gone.</i>

1404
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:20,060
<i>But not everybody's going begging.</i>

1405
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:23,980
<i>Amnesty International, Greenpeace
and the United Negro College Fund...</i>

1406
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:26,180
<i>...announced record earnings this week...</i>

1407
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:31,020
<i>...due mostly to large,
anonymous donations.</i>
