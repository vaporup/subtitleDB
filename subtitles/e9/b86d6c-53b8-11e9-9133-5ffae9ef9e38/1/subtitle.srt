1
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,975
Burglar!

2
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,008
Catch the burglar!

3
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,543
Don't you run away!

4
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,522
Happy Birthday!

5
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,756
Happy Birthday...

6
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,691
Sammo Hung!

7
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,315
- You're not Sammo Hung!
- He's not Sammo Hung!

8
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,343
Burglar...

9
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,814
Get him...

10
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:38,884
Hurry up.

11
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,620
Don't run...

12
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,482
What a coincidence!

13
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,963
We do not wish to be
the parasites of society.

14
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,534
We do not wish to
live off other people's harvests.

15
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,468
We only want to give comfort
to the despaired.

16
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,168
Bravo!

17
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,468
Let me ask: Is it shameful
to be in hard labor?

18
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,239
Let me ask: Is it a crime to support
your husband and children?

19
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,813
No!

20
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,383
I hereby implore citizens of Hong Kong,

21
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,748
that there's no right or wrong
in the entertainment business.

22
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,945
Right!

23
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,249
It's everybody's responsibility
to legalize prostitution!

24
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,487
Curly, you were great!

25
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,725
We have to act like real men,

26
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,856
be free and go bravely forward!
- Alright!

27
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:59,696
Alright...

28
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,635
Brother Jack.

29
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:08,903
Want to buy me out?
My principle is never to be a two-timer!

30
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,717
Say no more.
We'll start demonstrating today.

31
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,045
Tomorrow we'll voice our complaints
at the Council's office.

32
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,778
Then we'll protest
at the Governor's House.

33
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,982
This is the situation.
You can think about the consequences.

34
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,318
Talking to you is a waste of time!

35
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,326
Even $3,000 can't buy him.
Junkie Ming!

36
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,198
Protest! Protest!...

37
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,865
Protest!...

38
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,766
Three in a row, three in a row!

39
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,997
More than three and we'll be booked
for an illegal gathering!

40
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,674
Line up now.

41
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,173
Three by three...

42
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,277
Line up, line up!

43
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,673
Line up, line up!

44
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,714
Right. Line up just like that.

45
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,472
We protest wrongful termination!

46
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,674
Wrongful termination!

47
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,146
We must persist to the end!

48
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,854
What?
What are you saying?

49
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,515
What are you doing?
What do you want?

50
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,284
Sure, sure, I know what to do.

51
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,388
Jack said we don't need
to respect the management.

52
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,829
Jack said we can tear down the factory.
Jack said...

53
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,360
Sure, sure, I understand.

54
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,063
Jack ordered me
to make a move right away.

55
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,200
I'll make a move on you first!

56
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,946
Sir, this has nothing to do with me.

57
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,017
It has nothing to do with me either.
Get in!

58
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,463
Pal, can you please
clean that yellow car for me?

59
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,462
Thank you. I'm leaving very soon.

60
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,254
Where's my car key?

61
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:39,962
Shit!

62
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,156
It's not your lucky day.

63
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,990
You've got some nerve!

64
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,443
Hold it!
No need to shoot me for stealing a tire.

65
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,944
We citizens are very cooperative
with the police, sir.

66
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,108
Do it yourself.

67
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,051
Done.

68
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,752
This will be evidence in court. Move!

69
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,401
Buddy, do you have anything
more expensive?

70
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,397
Yes. One moment please.

71
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,167
- Please look around.
- Okay.

72
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,678
Sir, I guarantee
you will be satisfied with this watch.

73
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,848
This one? It's not bad!

74
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,093
Chan! Long time no see!

75
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,127
Can't believe I'd see you here.

76
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,998
Why don't you ever call your old friends?

77
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,899
Now that you're rich,
you never look me up...

78
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,909
I told you...
I have nothing to do with that!

79
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,343
Never thought you would shoot me!

80
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,147
You...

81
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,551
What's going on?

82
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,055
Don't look. Just go!

83
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,456
I have nothing to do with it!

84
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,760
Please show me that diamond watch.

85
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:29,902
Sure.

86
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,098
I'm sure you'll be
satisfied with this one.

87
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,174
This one's not bad either.

88
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,577
- This one suits you.
- That's right.

89
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,353
Chan! Long time no see!
Never thought I'd bump into you here!

90
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,415
How's life?

91
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,124
I told you not to be trigger-happy!

92
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,698
I told you it has nothing to do with me!

93
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,695
Don't move! This is a hold up!
Freeze!

94
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,336
Don't move.
I'll shoot anyone that moves!

95
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,070
Don't look! On your knees!

96
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,044
Let's go!

97
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,125
Sir, how are you? Are you alright?

98
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,492
I'm fine. I go home,
put some antiseptic on and I'll be okay.

99
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,725
How can that be?
You're bleeding all over!

100
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,225
No problem. I'm used to it.

101
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,730
Sir, those robbers ran that way.

102
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:39,768
Follow me!

103
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,202
You can't move!

104
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,472
What's the matter?

105
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,509
He got shot!

106
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,768
Call an ambulance, quick!

107
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,240
No, don't call the ambulance!

108
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,143
Don't be scared, don't be scared.

109
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,610
- Be careful
- No, really!

110
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:51,841
I'm alright!

111
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,455
You're covered with blood.
What're you here for?

112
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,094
For a stick up, okay?

113
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,357
Of course it's not okay.
Otherwise you wouldn't get arrested. Come on!

114
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,565
Why are you still standing there?

115
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,974
Sir, this is such a narrow street.
We should go one by one.

116
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:16,972
Get on with it!

117
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,949
I'm in a good mood today.

118
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,216
Otherwise you would've bled to death!

119
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,085
Sir...

120
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,317
Sir what? Confess now!

121
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,458
Where did the counterfeit U.S. bills
come from?

122
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,492
I withdrew them from the bank, sir.

123
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,656
What? Those counterfeit bills
were withdrawn from the bank?

124
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,001
Sir, those aren't counterfeit money.

125
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,169
Can it be genuine then?

126
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,865
Yes...

127
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,237
I'm no longer in a good mood.

128
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,806
It's counterfeit!
I picked the money up from the street.

129
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,613
Smart. You just saved your own life.

130
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,508
You wouldn't have gotten a beating if
you told me sooner. Try to lie to me?

131
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,243
You asked for it.

132
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,216
7086.

133
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,886
Sir, he has confessed.

134
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,357
They're all genuine.

135
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,193
I went to the bank and checked.
He did take out $200,000 U.S.

136
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,961
You've beaten him senseless! You...

137
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,393
Sir, I know what to do.

138
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,904
Sir, he has agreed to accept today
as though nothing has happened.

139
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,182
Don't go yet!

140
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,549
7086, you are now off
the counterfeit money case.

141
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,151
I've already sent an undercover.

142
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,352
Sir, are there any other cases
for me to take care of?

143
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,821
Sure.
Go to the parks and catch litterbugs!

144
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,155
Why am I so down and out?

145
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,730
All because I'm so impulsive.

146
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,300
I'm the eldest, so I should be No.1!

147
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,376
I'm No.2.

148
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,845
I'm No.3.

149
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,437
I'm No.4.

150
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,842
Then I guess I'm No.5.

151
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,347
From now on,
we'll share both joy and pain together!

152
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,111
Who's willing to clean the toilet?

153
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,613
Him!

154
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,670
Even the air breathes differently
from the other side of the wall.

155
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,242
What's the matter? Asthma attack?

156
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,044
Just getting used to the air outside.

157
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,273
I don't think you'll get used to it.
Go back in.

158
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:45,013
Honest to God, please don't follow us.
Go, go!

159
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,556
Wait for Teapot!

160
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:47,487
No need to wait!

161
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:48,590
I said wait...

162
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,495
You're right. We better get going.

163
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,597
Is that how you guys treat me now,
buddies?

164
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,427
Let's wait for him.

165
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,338
Look at you. Put these clothes on.

166
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,001
Boss!

167
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,133
Daddy!

168
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,137
I've told you
not to speak English with me.

169
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,071
Father.

170
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:18,783
Good.

171
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,457
Are you still fooling around
with that chauffeur?

172
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,154
Not fooling around. We plan to
get married right after you're out.

173
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,623
Future Father-in-law.

174
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,383
No need to be envious.

175
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,990
We'll get a cooler reception
the next time we get out!

176
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,528
Maybe we have to use our legs
to hail a bus now!

177
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,032
Let me!

178
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,780
A flat tire.

179
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,623
Pal, it's your lucky day.
Even here you can get 5 passengers.

180
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,668
Bye!

181
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,637
When you're down in luck,
there's simply no escape!

182
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,711
Oh well,
better get some Palmolive leaves

183
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,444
to wash away all the bad luck!

184
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,730
Ah Sing, want to play poker today?

185
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,924
You can count me out.
Today isn't my lucky day.

186
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,067
You're kidding!

187
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,964
Don't believe me? Come take a look
and you'll know what I mean.

188
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,199
Each one of them has the word "convict"
sculpted on their foreheads!

189
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,277
What are you honking at?
Late for your own execution?

190
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,695
So, uh, Curly. Why are you in for?

191
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,767
Oh, nothing. I was on this minibus
and the driver was talking shit.

192
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,167
So I grabbed him off the wheel,
stabbed him a couple of times

193
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,465
and I got 3 years.

194
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,105
You think that's bad!

195
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,675
Some guy just kept staring at me, so I
cracked his eyeball with just one punch?

196
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,174
I got 2 years for that.

197
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,540
Then using sulfuric acid is better.

198
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,782
That time when I splashed it
on the driver's head,

199
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,181
I only got 18 months!

200
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,380
Then your luck is better than mine.

201
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,525
I used sulfuric acid too!
But I got 10 years!

202
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,124
10 years?? Where did you splash him?

203
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,432
I didn't. I forced it down his throat.

204
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,702
Doesn't matter how much time you get.

205
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,704
Whoever thinks he's tough?
He's gonna get it!

206
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,038
I wonder how much time one will get
for setting a minibus on fire?

207
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,479
Hey driver, got a light?

208
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,008
No! No!

209
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,147
Enough already.
I'm getting all fired up.

210
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,814
Curly, is there a minibus
that takes you straight to your place?

211
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,549
There used to be one.
I don't know about now.

212
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,083
Then how do we get there?

213
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,160
Make a left here.

214
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,756
Then a right.

215
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,490
Go straight and through the puddle.

216
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:58,961
Stop right here!

217
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,476
How much, man?

218
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,669
All men are brothers! No need, no need!

219
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,678
Thanks!

220
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,681
Hard to believe you have property!

221
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,754
It's not mine. It belongs to my uncle.

222
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,925
His whole family
is busy washing dishes in Canada.

223
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,924
I'm just house sitting for him.
But Uncle is already 79,

224
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,190
and has no children.
All of this will belong to me one day.

225
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,765
Help yourself, guys.
There's beer in the fridge.

226
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,506
Sis! Sis!

227
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,540
Want to guess
how Curly's sister looks like?

228
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,011
Just look at him and you'll know.

229
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,611
Thanks.

230
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,945
Not necessarily so.

231
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,986
Curly, come over here.

232
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,617
What's up?

233
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,094
We're going to ask you a question,
and you must give an honest answer.

234
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,161
Say it!

235
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,394
Do you and your sister
share the same parents?

236
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,792
Yes.

237
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,468
What about it?

238
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,607
Nothing.

239
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,010
Then it's hopeless!

240
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,580
What now?
What's the matter?

241
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,148
Nothing. Going to the toilet.

242
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,284
What happened?

243
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,857
Nothing. Just being scared by my sister.

244
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,364
All these years
and she still scares him!

245
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,760
We better have some mental preparation.

246
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,962
Cut the crap.
Just be polite when you greet people.

247
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,572
- Are all the guests here?
- All here.

248
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,502
Dinner's ready. Have a seat.

249
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,410
Actually, God is very fair.

250
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,912
A beautiful lady can never cook.

251
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,050
And a lady that cooks is never...

252
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:01,990
Say Hello to the uncles.

253
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:03,091
Hello uncles.

254
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,557
She's "helloing" you guys!

255
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,529
I'm Lin,
but you can call me Vaseline.

256
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,895
Sit down.

257
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,475
You all better not
let your imagination go wild.

258
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,542
Honestly,
let me ask you one more question.

259
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:23,806
What was your father's occupation?

260
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:24,949
Seaman.

261
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,719
No wonder.

262
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,388
Burglar!

263
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,950
- What is it?
- There's a burglar!

264
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,989
He's not a burglar. He is Teapot.

265
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,927
It's alright. Go away!

266
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,662
I'm Teapot.

267
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,097
Sorry.

268
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,340
No need to say sorry. It's perfectly
normal to think he's a thief.

269
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,808
Say, does your foot hurt?

270
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,573
Are you alright?

271
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,412
I'm alright, just feeling a bit cheated.

272
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,711
It's okay.
Just a misunderstanding. Come eat!

273
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:03,618
Come get some rice.

274
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,860
What's this? This is my house. No need
to stand in line for food anymore.

275
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,346
Thanks.

276
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:34,683
Thanks.

277
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,318
Make yourselves at home.

278
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:40,855
Thanks.

279
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,555
Thanks.

280
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,476
She can get it herself.

281
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,692
Thanks.

282
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:37,975
Is the stuff ready yet?

283
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,047
All set.

284
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,195
Boss, can you tell which one is real?

285
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:03,674
The middle one.

286
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:04,739
Wrong, Boss!

287
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,973
It's the one above.

288
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,708
Wrong again, Boss.
All three are counterfeits.

289
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,878
Come over here.

290
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,252
Don't fool me like that again.

291
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,937
But you've done good on this job.

292
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,377
I'm serious. Stop following me!

293
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,315
Hey man, it's all of you
who told me to wear this rag!

294
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,514
What rag?

295
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,158
Is it so embarrassing for you
to wear my dad's clothes?

296
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,994
I didn't say that.
You were the ones who said it's ugly.

297
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,193
It is a little ugly,
but it really suits you.

298
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,963
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's the inner beauty that counts.

299
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,963
Jack was right. Your only flaw
is your awkward appearance,

300
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,264
otherwise you're fine.

301
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,771
Stop arguing. Let's go.

302
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:14,946
Don't touch!

303
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,940
That's no fun!

304
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,447
Not even a pat on the shoulder!

305
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,949
Of course. Curly Jack may think
you two are perverts.

306
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,311
Look what a bad mouth you have!

307
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,753
What do you mean "may"?

308
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,720
They are perverts!

309
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,260
Her brother is here. It's hopeless.

310
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,024
Think of a plan to get rid of him.

311
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,259
What plan?

312
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,562
Can't you think of one?

313
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:47,535
Tonight... we two...
brothers... are not selling...

314
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,775
...selling medicine.

315
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,012
How come I don't see Butcher Wing
and his sister?

316
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,084
Medicine!

317
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,388
We're... here to...

318
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,353
heal the sick.

319
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,395
And... and...

320
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,227
nourish the healthy...

321
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,868
and... and...

322
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,262
- Me?
- Of course it's you.

323
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:14,701
The smart ones talk
and the dumb ones act.

324
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,135
Strengthen...

325
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,675
- Strengthen your body.
- Most performers sell fake medicine!

326
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,472
The whole... whole...

327
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,308
body will be strong all over.

328
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,109
The pills... though they

329
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,721
are tiny,

330
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,789
but... they're... easy...

331
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:38,659
...to swallow. Three times a day,
morning, noon and night.

332
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:46,095
That's why I've... never...

333
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,236
gotten sick in the last twenty years.

334
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,837
Full... of... vitality...

335
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,446
Alright, folks.
Enough with the small talk!

336
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,705
I beg your pardon!

337
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,735
I thought it's something special.
See them all the time on those oldies rerun!

338
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:27,105
Look at you. Use some force!
Looks more like some old man pissing.

339
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,102
You've got guts!

340
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,272
How dare you hit Master Chiu?

341
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,047
- Don't go away!
- I was just kidding!

342
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,853
No! I was just kidding!

343
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:12,682
Brother...

344
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,884
Relax, sis. Your brother
is used to this kind of action.

345
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,254
He's run away from tougher battles!

346
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,622
Small matters like this are no big deal.

347
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:22,028
He'll be alright, sis.
We'll take a stroll over there.

348
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,401
Windpipe!
Are you going to compete with me?

349
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,404
Can't you tell?

350
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,608
Let me set the rules straight.

351
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,436
No need.
We'll use our own cunning ways.

352
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,611
Now what?
You like to pull men's pants off too?

353
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:37,543
You...

354
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,081
Look who's taken the gravy!

355
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:44,553
Come and get it!
Brand name Walkie-Talkie only $65!

356
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,247
Last chance!

357
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,459
Sis, can you hear what I say? Over.

358
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,960
Yes.
At this distance, anyone can hear you.

359
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,460
Got to move further. Give it to me!

360
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,628
This game is not for you and me.

361
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,165
Machinery is Windpipe's specialty.

362
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,711
This time you're right.
I can tell right away.

363
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,503
Even though it says "Made in Japan",

364
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,274
it's actually made in Hong Kong.

365
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,545
But its reception capabilities
are very strong.

366
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:17,045
I think its transmission radius
should be 51.4 meters!

367
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,313
How can you be so sure?

368
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,921
He's bullshitting.

369
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,390
Bullshitting? You can ask the boss.

370
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,726
My friend, you do have some knowledge.

371
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,229
See? Listen, sis.

372
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,464
I'll now talk to you
at the 51.4 meter spot.

373
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,363
Why am I hanging out
with a dork like him?

374
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,475
Windpipe, over, over.

375
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,836
Hi, sis. Over.

376
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,078
Are you at the 51.4 meter spot yet?

377
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,249
Not yet. I'm on my way.

378
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,281
Sis, can you hear me clearly? Over.

379
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,152
Vaguely, over.

380
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,048
What about now?

381
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,558
Sis asks you to sing a song for her.

382
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,553
What? Sing a song?

383
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:57,592
Yes!

384
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,298
"Baby loves me from the heart,

385
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,507
I love baby from the start.

386
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,574
And we wish upon a star,

387
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:21,183
till forever do we part.

388
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:27,819
Now the sea is in between...

389
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,592
Who knows when we'll meet again?"

390
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,792
Dad, someone has taken over our turf!

391
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,039
"Brief reunion can be sweet..."

392
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,802
It's a tough living, my child.

393
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,377
They'll sing theirs, and we'll sing ours.

394
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,982
"...can be sad."

395
00:30:52,917 --> 00:31:00,983
"Past joys are hard to forget..."

396
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,633
Sis, sis. Can you hear me? Over.

397
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,995
Sis? Sis your ass! I'm closing up!

398
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,137
Get me back the walkie-talkie now!

399
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,363
Or I'll call the cops!

400
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,234
Teapot, go get some peanuts
so you two can eat.

401
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:29,713
I want some too!

402
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,777
Get going. Do you need some change?

403
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:37,479
No, because I don't have
any money at all.

404
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,459
God knows I tried hard
to preserve your dignity. Here!

405
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,093
My dignity is worth more than 10 bucks.

406
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,200
Then how much?

407
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,395
150 bucks.

408
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,196
That's too much!

409
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,808
Too much?
Then try and get rid of me too.

410
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,642
Alright. Let's get this over with.

411
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,315
Relax.
I will pay this $150 back to you.

412
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,046
After three years in the cell,
even a hooker is Princess to me now.

413
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,446
See ya!

414
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:14,858
Where's Ranks?

415
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,989
He must have sent him off!

416
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,894
I think he must've left on his own.

417
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,362
That's right.
He has to take care of something.

418
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,401
Very nice!

419
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,281
That's a ladies' booth.
Why are you standing there?

420
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,210
Nothing.

421
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,545
Even those with potential are gone now.

422
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,981
You should know what to do.

423
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,346
I know. I'm leaving,

424
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,921
but I want to say goodbye to Sis first.

425
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,625
No need. Just disappear.

426
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,861
No way! Sis was already asking me...

427
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,687
why they've left so suddenly.

428
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,230
I think it'll be beneficial to you
if I let her know.

429
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,863
Sounds like you want to help me out.

430
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:04,531
That depends on whether it's worth it.
How are you going to help me?

431
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:10,743
Alright. Here're 30 dollars for a movie
and a late night snack.

432
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,813
You can keep the change.

433
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,211
Remember, don't take too long!

434
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,322
Okay.

435
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,623
Then how long is "don't take too long"?

436
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,693
I don't know
how you can live for so long.

437
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:35,567
Fine. I'll give you a signal,
then you can go. Remember now!

438
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:42,035
Sis. Vaseline told us to leave first.

439
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,805
Why?

440
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,779
Don't know. He said he has to
take care of something urgent.

441
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,358
Why don't you go and ask him?

442
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,063
There's no need. Let's go.

443
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,714
TEAPOT!

444
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,287
So that's what you guys
have been fighting for.

445
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,789
That's right.

446
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,950
Turns out I'm the one
who has a chance to be with you.

447
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,625
Actually, you can just ask me out.

448
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:36,366
I don't dare. I know who I am.

449
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,198
Look at me.
Aside from being healthy, smart,

450
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,031
kind-hearted, hard-working,

451
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,070
sincere, and honest,

452
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,072
I have nothing else in my favor.

453
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,412
Besides, girls nowadays
only care about appearances.

454
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,377
That is true.

455
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:07,097
Even you agree. That's why
I don't dare to approach any girls.

456
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,495
So what if I get to know...

457
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,634
an approachable girl like you?

458
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,999
I am shy and no good with words.

459
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,930
Just one look from a girl,
and my heart would jump,

460
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,667
my knees would jerk,
and my hands get numb.

461
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,070
I'll just be like right now,
not knowing what to say.

462
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,804
You mean you've never
asked a girl out before?

463
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,551
Asking a girl out, no.
But paid a girl for a night out, yes.

464
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,914
I'm just kidding!

465
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,220
Where do we go now?

466
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,358
We can go to...

467
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:41,861
Go to hell! All those noises.
You even scared my fish away!

468
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,263
Have people been calling you Teapot
since you were a kid?

469
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,131
No. When I was little,
everyone called me Little Teapot.

470
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,769
Actually, you hardly look like a teapot.

471
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,473
Hardly? I am from head to toe.
There's even a song about it.

472
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,684
Song? Can you sing it for me please?

473
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,811
Right here?

474
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,856
So what? There's nobody around.

475
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,624
Promise me not to laugh if I sing.

476
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,829
I promise. Now sing!

477
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:26,501
"I am a teapot fat and short,
I am a teapot fat and short.

478
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,441
This is the handle, this is the spout.

479
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,514
Water is boiling, tea is pouring!"

480
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,492
Teapot, you are a charmer!

481
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,699
Teapot.
Where did you take my sister to just now?

482
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,059
Brother!

483
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,462
We went for tea.

484
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,267
That means you haven't eaten yet.

485
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,374
I've treated each of them
with a hard-boiled egg.

486
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,906
I even saved two for you.

487
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:01,004
- You bastard.
- No!

488
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,577
I got a beating because of you!

489
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,645
Where do you want to go now?

490
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,611
Anywhere.

491
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:13,581
Want to go see a movie?

492
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,413
Alright,
but I don't watch horror movies.

493
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,484
What do you want to see then?

494
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,586
Comedies.

495
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:22,957
Your turn, kid.

496
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,755
"Maxim's smart, Maxim's best,
Maxim's cakes beat the rest."

497
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,761
Answer one more question.
What's Maxim best known for?

498
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,025
Any tips?

499
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,866
I'll give you three choices.

500
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:36,039
Pancake, pudding, or pastry.

501
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,398
Pancake.

502
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,238
Wrong. One more chance.

503
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,501
Pudding.

504
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,441
Wrong again. One last chance.

505
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,305
Pancake plus pudding.

506
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:51,719
This is for you.

507
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,426
I would like 3 ham and egg sandwiches
and 2 hamburgers,

508
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,525
3 Cokes, and a coffee to go.

509
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,127
Also 2 pork chop over rice
and 2 orange juices for here.

510
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,527
Eat in, thanks.

511
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,197
What would you like?

512
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,032
You can get a table first.

513
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:07,900
Okay.

514
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,329
Chubby, lend me your girlfriend
for a while.

515
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,175
There's going to be a robbery here.

516
00:40:56,687 --> 00:41:00,646
Don't worry.
You two will be safe as long as I'm here.

517
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,795
Chubby, sit down
and eat your pork chop over rice.

518
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,126
Just duck when I tell you to.

519
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:20,772
For you.

520
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,276
I want money, not prizes!

521
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,244
Kid, you...

522
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,814
I was a kid 30 years ago.
Now I'm a robber.

523
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,350
Give me your money now.
My gun has very little patience.

524
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,152
And don't you dare scream.

525
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:35,790
Keep cool, keep your mouth shut,
and put the money in this bag.

526
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,731
You'll soon forget about your fears.
Get used to it.

527
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,392
Better not scream
till you think you're safe.

528
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,442
Freeze! Get down!

529
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,123
Let them go or I'll kill him!

530
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,531
Chubby, you've got some moves.

531
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:53,761
Just so so.

532
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,735
Teapot, are you alright?

533
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,771
I'm fine.

534
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,873
I don't understand,
why do you let them bully you?

535
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,907
Actually, they should be glad
you're not bullying them.

536
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,946
When I was a kid,
I like fighting and bullying others.

537
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,743
And I ended up having no friends.

538
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,675
So now I treasure friendship much more.

539
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,083
As long as they are my friends,
I don't mind them bullying me...

540
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,415
once in a while.

541
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,955
Robbery!

542
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,389
Now she yells!

543
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,721
Don't move! Or this bullet
will go through your head, then theirs.

544
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,331
You fake!
How dare you rob with a phony gun!

545
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,426
You need some help?

546
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:26,627
Sure.

547
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,269
Not that! Call the cops for me.

548
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:33,209
Don't move!

549
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,261
Shoot!

550
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,616
1, 2, 3!

551
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:18,855
Next time we'll throw
when we count to 2.

552
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,113
What're you guys laughing at?

553
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,262
Don't tell, no matter what.

554
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:12,798
What're you two looking at? Sit down
and let's finish the game, idiots!

555
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,948
Invisible, sure. Even if the body is,

556
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,814
you still can see the clothes!

557
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,279
This time it'll work for sure!

558
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,968
- Shoot!
- You can't even shoot at the goal!

559
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,607
Shoot!

560
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,469
What a dumbass.

561
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:20,836
Just standing there and doing nothing.

562
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:22,306
Just shoot from midfield!

563
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:25,310
You think everyone is like that Zico?
"Just shoot from midfield"!

564
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,509
Don't just stand there!
Go after the ball!

565
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:29,947
You guys can forget about winning.

566
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:35,347
That No.9 just keeps punting around
and doesn't pass the ball.

567
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,061
Go! Shoot!

568
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,564
What a great chance and he still misses!

569
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,863
Can't just stand there
and wait for the ball, am I right?

570
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,037
That's why British soccer is much better.
Every shot is aimed for the goal.

571
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,339
What commercial is this?

572
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,009
Longine Watch.
You mean you haven't seen it?

573
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:00,445
This bald guy sure
looks like Sean Connery.

574
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,253
How can they win
if they don't even have teamwork?

575
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:11,292
This No.7 is always blocking the way.

576
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,895
No.8 is much better.
He has strength in every kick.

577
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,329
They're doomed if they kick like this.

578
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,701
What was that for?

579
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,503
Who has time to mess with you?

580
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,710
I can kick better than him!

581
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,876
Not too hard, man!

582
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:36,919
Why did you hit me?

583
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:40,051
You're nuts! Why don't you ask them
whether I hit you or not?

584
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,520
Go outside if you two want to fight.

585
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:43,786
We have a game to watch.

586
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,528
Hit me again and you're going to get it.

587
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,201
Forget it. I'll sit over there.

588
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,275
There's no escaping this one!

589
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,048
Blaming me again!
Luckily I am miles away.

590
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,046
You sons of bitches! You tricked me!

591
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,986
Move! Idiots!

592
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,029
Better let her take it off herself!

593
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,586
I'll be letting Curly down if I do this.

594
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,040
Nice!

595
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,106
How come it's missing something?

596
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:03,824
I think of you when I can't see you.
I'll love you more if I do!

597
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,417
If he goes out like that,
I'll die laughing!

598
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:22,643
It's possible!

599
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,748
He can't be. He's upstairs...

600
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:26,920
Sis!

601
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,117
He's coming down.

602
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:36,662
Pass to the right! Kick! Pass!

603
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:44,772
Shoot!

604
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:46,633
Get the door.

605
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:47,908
Let me.

606
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,109
Registered mail.

607
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,423
Pal, you sign for it.

608
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,962
You can see me?

609
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:15,569
I don't want to,
but my eyes aren't cooperating.

610
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,800
I can see even the smallest thing.

611
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:20,238
Are you sure, buddy? I'm invisible!

612
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,774
Invisible? I wish I was too!

613
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:26,142
Hurry up, pal.
I need to go home and get an eye-wash.

614
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,046
Sore eyes are a pain in the ass!

615
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,058
What are you all laughing at?

616
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,569
Windpipe thinks he's invisible
and we can't see him.

617
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,174
So?

618
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,242
He was there when I took a bath.

619
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:54,638
I just pretended that
I couldn't see him.

620
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,115
So, do I have a nice figure?

621
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,826
Remember.
Your contact person is a foreigner.

622
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,865
Both of you wear a red rose.

623
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,629
All you need to do is give him the case,

624
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,839
and bring the money back safely.

625
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,065
Then your duty is done.
Is that clear?

626
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,239
Clear.

627
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,670
Repeat it for me.

628
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:32,637
The red foreigner... no, no.
Rose... rose spray!

629
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,181
Father, what do you want him to do?

630
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,118
I've told you that women shouldn't...

631
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,821
barge in when men are talking business!
Go back to your room!

632
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,684
No!
I want to know what you want Chai to do.

633
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,154
Is it tough?

634
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:49,795
Relax. Nothing is as tough as
relying on a woman for a living.

635
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,328
Go now.

636
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,769
Bill, Pat. You two look after him.

637
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,732
Chai, let them do the dangerous stuff.
You be careful.

638
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:04,042
This is your first mission.
Don't disappoint me.

639
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:05,339
Sure, sure.

640
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,311
Wait. Your pants.

641
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,423
When's my luck going to change?

642
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,295
Little kid, don't litter.

643
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,734
If you were an adult,
I would have arrested you.

644
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,365
What's the matter?

645
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,066
He dumped my ice cream!

646
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,505
You're not done with it?

647
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,038
Don't cry.

648
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,277
There.

649
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,414
Still brainless at your age!

650
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,550
I'm sorry.

651
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:42,785
Don't cry,
mom will buy you another one.

652
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,155
Well?

653
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,453
I don't know. I may not be free.

654
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,295
Let's wait till the time comes.

655
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,938
Just forget it.

656
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,938
I'm not a man
if I don't react in this situation.

657
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,337
Were you the one who whistled just now?

658
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:09,375
Yes.

659
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,841
You're such a creep!

660
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:12,376
What did you say?

661
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,649
Looks okay, but ugly manners.

662
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:16,843
Don't make me mad!

663
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,988
Mad? Can you?

664
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,747
Forget it. Let's go.

665
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:33,129
Freeze! I'm CID!

666
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,773
Should've said so earlier, partner!

667
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:41,877
Did I hurt you?

668
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,570
Do I look like I get hurt easily?

669
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:45,408
You should be glad I didn't hurt you!

670
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:46,482
Are you alright?

671
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,208
Look how frightened your girlfriend is.

672
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,181
She's always afraid,
I might hurt somebody.

673
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,184
Let's go!

674
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,117
Bye.

675
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,519
Are you done fighting?

676
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,097
Not fighting, just practicing.

677
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,665
Don't hit on girls next time!

678
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:07,998
Hitting on girls?

679
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,264
Do you think my taste is that bad?
That whistle was meant for you!

680
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:12,305
If you don't believe me...
