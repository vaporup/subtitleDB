1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,264
Say no more.
It's time for the competition. Let's go!

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:03,231
Okay.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,507
The Roller Skates Obstacle Race
is now commencing.

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,807
Your turn to get embarrassed. Go now.

5
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,413
Let me kiss you first.

6
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,309
Don't be too hard on yourself.

7
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,363
The first contestant, No.8.

8
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,825
Be careful!

9
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:29,973
Not a chance!

10
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,549
The second contestant, No.37.

11
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:17,828
Looks like something big.

12
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,895
Let's get him.

13
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,534
Why are you robbing my stuff?

14
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,711
Robbery! Someone just robbed me!

15
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,841
Hurry! Get them! Robbery!

16
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,613
Robbery! Get him!

17
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,688
Robbery!

18
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,190
Can't give yourself away.

19
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,882
I'm CID.
I'll be responsible for any damages here!

20
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,232
It's too late! Split!

21
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,799
It's in the van!

22
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,484
Faster!

23
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,910
Monkey! Do you know how to drive?

24
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,887
I'm a cop.
Help me catch the car up ahead!

25
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,781
I'm a cop.
Help me catch the car up ahead!

26
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,429
Faster! Pass, pass!

27
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,865
Faster, faster! He's right behind us!

28
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,417
Why is your car so slow?
You can't even overtake a truck!

29
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,335
I'm a cop...

30
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,316
Stop the car!

31
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,320
Or this bullet will go through your head,
then through his!

32
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,952
I'm going to shoot!

33
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,286
Stop! Stop the car!

34
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,517
No!

35
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,294
How lucky!

36
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:54,900
Do you know how to drive?

37
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,762
Drivers are so careless nowadays.

38
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,211
Oh, shit!

39
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,187
Chai! Are you alright?

40
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,290
I'm fine.

41
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,924
Father-in-law,
I've already chased after them.

42
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,721
Boss, they've transported
the merchandise to Five Stars Cleaning.

43
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:27,731
Good. Send some guys to
search Five Stars Cleaning.

44
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,596
Yes!

45
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,501
You!
You're good for nothing, except in bed!

46
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,571
- Get out of my sight!
- Yes.

47
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,074
Get me Housekeeper Chan.

48
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,549
From now on,
I forbid you leave your room!

49
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,284
Father, don't be so mean.

50
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,818
Housekeeper Chan, use this name list
to send out invitations for me.

51
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:55,892
I understand.

52
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,711
Bring the equipment in.

53
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,070
Got it.

54
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,945
You all should already know
what to do here.

55
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,847
I won't say anymore.

56
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,814
Which one of you is in charge?

57
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,719
I am. My name is...

58
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,663
There are a few more points
I want you to take note of.

59
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,361
First, don't bring in any tools
that you don't need.

60
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,506
Leave the ones you don't use outside,
by the door.

61
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,502
Second,
these stairs lead to the second floor.

62
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,849
Bullshit.

63
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:55,047
"Weather today's Ha Ha Ha".
He said I was talking crap.

64
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,455
You guys are absolutely
not allowed to go upstairs.

65
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:03,589
Third. The toilet is over there.
But you can only clean it, not use it.

66
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,595
Smoke?

67
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,002
Thanks.

68
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:16,839
Thank you.

69
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:21,004
Fourth.
You can smoke, but you can't light it up.

70
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,207
Nothing annoys our master more than
all those ashes flying around.

71
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,119
Does your hair fall out constantly?

72
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,928
Not as much now.

73
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,199
You should wear a cap.

74
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,393
It's a health hazard
to have hair flying around.

75
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,635
Fifth. Our contract states that...

76
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,298
you'll get paid
after I deem your work satisfactory.

77
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,271
That's for certain.

78
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,809
Alright then, you may start working.

79
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,251
Finally! After hearing garbage spilling
garbage, it's time to pick up garbage.

80
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:13,021
Go faster, faster!
Go after him! Quickly!

81
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,528
Go after him!

82
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,501
7086 reporting.

83
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:23,904
Good afternoon, sir!

84
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:30,680
Sir.

85
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,409
7086 be seated!

86
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,550
Yes sir.

87
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,190
You were quite heroic this morning!

88
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,751
Thank you sir!

89
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,519
Do you know how many cars you smashed?

90
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,391
I didn't have time to count, sir.

91
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,294
It was more than 50 vehicles!

92
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,262
Thank you sir.

93
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,163
Still "thank you"?

94
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,734
No, no thank, sir.

95
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,137
Did you know what happened
to those two muggers you caught?

96
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,399
They escaped?

97
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,636
That would've been better!

98
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,039
They're out on $500 bail each.

99
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,008
You have neither witness nor evidence.

100
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,545
How are we going to prosecute them?

101
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,210
Charge them for racing with a cop?

102
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,045
Do you know you are a big spender
when it comes to solving cases?

103
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,819
I'm now considering
where to send you next.

104
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,223
You are more suitable in places
where there are more trees than people!

105
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,760
Sir, I was just doing my job.

106
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,229
Doing your job?
Get your dirty hands off!

107
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,608
Where are my two tortoises?

108
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:31,744
Hold it!

109
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,113
Sir, luckily I have quick reflexes.

110
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,378
If you've stepped on Rose, you would be
guarding the reservoir for sure!

111
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,482
Albert?

112
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,195
Luckily it's just a pencil sharpener.

113
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,505
Sir, how many sharpeners do you have?

114
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,368
I've only got one sharpener.

115
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,341
Albert...

116
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,716
Sir, might as well
send me to the reservoir.

117
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,087
Reservoir? You better have
your traffic uniform ready!

118
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,152
You'll get to taste the scorching sun
and the pouring rain.

119
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,390
That was a red light!

120
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,364
Really?

121
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,052
You just crossed a red light.

122
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,353
Sir, please give me a break.

123
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,792
Sure I'll give you a break.
Let me see your license.

124
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:06,672
I know him!

125
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,438
Let me. Sir!

126
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,305
It's you, Chubby!

127
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,414
Yeah. Luckily it's you.

128
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,674
I've always said it's good
to have connections.

129
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,853
My principle is to separate
personal from official business.

130
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,284
Next time,
tell your friend to drive more carefully.

131
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,683
Sir...

132
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,224
Sir no more. This is my job.
Sorry if I can't help.

133
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,786
Let him then!
Cops only know how to write tickets,

134
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,657
not catch thugs.

135
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,531
I was good at catching thugs!

136
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,068
Otherwise I wouldn't end up like this!

137
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,271
I'm pissed!

138
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,450
No use getting pissed off.
Let me sit down and think of something.

139
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:01,960
Pack up the stuff.

140
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,355
Didn't you say you'll think of something?

141
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,054
It takes a brain to think.
Do you have one?

142
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,522
Of course!

143
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,495
Of course? Let me ask you.

144
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,533
What are the five grains?

145
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:20,874
Rice, oat, wheat, wheat...
large wheat... small wheat...

146
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:21,809
cornflakes!

147
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,141
For you to eat?

148
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,716
I can't think of it.

149
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,081
That means you don't know them.

150
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,951
Do you want your limbs to get numb?

151
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,849
No.

152
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,788
Then hurry up and pack the stuff!

153
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,931
Actually, what are the five grains?

154
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,766
If I knew, I wouldn't have asked him!

155
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:52,170
I should know. Rice, wheat...

156
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,678
I'm beginning to despise myself
more and more.

157
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,314
Once upon a time,

158
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,147
others clean the toilet seat for me.

159
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,879
Now I'm the one doing the cleaning
and getting sneered at.

160
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,653
I wouldn't call it sneering.
But, that old hag was a little too picky.

161
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,823
That's how the rich people are
when they host a party.

162
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,964
I don't think so! If they invite me...

163
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,134
Would you go then?

164
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,462
Of course!

165
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,437
You wish! All the guests are rich.

166
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,505
So do we have to show
our savings books to get in?

167
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,268
Right.
We look like rich people at a glance.

168
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,604
Just a glance for you.

169
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,781
No matter where you look, I still have
the appearance of an achiever.

170
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,143
In that case, let's all go then.

171
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:33,745
That's not right.

172
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,446
Are you scared?
Didn't you say you know a lot of VIPs?

173
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,352
We may even solicit some business!

174
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,286
Right.

175
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,850
That's true. I'm sure I'll bump into
many old buddies there.

176
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,288
- I got it!
- Teapot.

177
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,462
Coming!

178
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,330
I've got it! The five grains are rice,
wheat, barley, oats, and rye!

179
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:52,996
So now you know.

180
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,340
Let's go.

181
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:56,872
Where to?

182
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,236
To borrow a suit for you.

183
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,411
What for?

184
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,609
To show off!

185
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:05,948
Get the door.

186
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,022
Hey. Where's the stuff?

187
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,987
You sure they will work?

188
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,327
Why not?
I even know how to make an atomic bomb!

189
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,162
Light them.

190
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,802
Go ahead.

191
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,212
Please.

192
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,180
Hi, how are you?

193
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,689
Those cigars are strong. Who are they?

194
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:49,725
Don't know.

195
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,196
Guests.

196
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,059
Stop smoking. Put them away!

197
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,844
"Wow" what?
Such ordinary scenery is no big deal.

198
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,170
Your brother knows a lot of people.

199
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,174
Well said, but God knows
whether they know who you are.

200
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,842
Isn't that Chan Chiu?

201
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,678
How are you?
I'm fine.

202
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,083
Thank you for coming, Mr. Chan.

203
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,690
Acting like he's the host.

204
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,720
This is his house!

205
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,187
How come I didn't know?

206
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,056
You don't know a lot of things.
Come on.

207
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,697
Hello, nice to meet you.

208
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,697
Sis, let me introduce you
to some friends.

209
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,605
Same old trick again!

210
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,671
I'm declaring a truce with you today.

211
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,704
Let me give you a hint.

212
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:42,338
No need to stick to one vegetable
when you're at the market.

213
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,452
I still don't understand.

214
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,520
That means no need to bring
your own lunch box to a restaurant.

215
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,481
I get it! Vaseline!

216
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,094
Courting along with Vaseline
will get you nowhere.

217
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,795
You should find a partner that
has weight and makes you stand out.

218
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,031
Teapot!

219
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,202
Don't count me in.

220
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,268
I know.
Nobody is telling you to go after girls.

221
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,633
Your job is to embarrass yourself
as much as possible.

222
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,309
You can't go wrong with that!
Just be yourself.

223
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,408
Let's go!

224
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,136
The gold just keeps going up nowadays.

225
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:17,816
Excuse me.

226
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,175
Master, Mr. Ho is here.

227
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,024
Take him to the library.

228
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,058
Yes.

229
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,361
Please.

230
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,334
Brother Chiu, congratulations.

231
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:42,441
Thanks.

232
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,275
Quite a party.

233
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,012
Thanks to everybody.

234
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,933
Sir, where are you going?

235
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,275
I... want to go to the restroom.

236
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,543
Follow us.

237
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,646
This way.

238
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,481
The restroom is
downstairs and to the left.

239
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,550
Thanks.

240
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,937
Mr. Leung, if there's anything
you need help on,

241
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,436
just give my secretary
Susan a call, thanks.

242
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:49,541
Very well.

243
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,303
Brother,
when did my name become Susan?

244
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,345
Have some class!
Can't just call you Sis.

245
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,882
You need face to do business.
Once you've got the tricks,

246
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,075
then it's smooth sailing.

247
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,288
Business has been tough lately...

248
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,722
Miss, has anyone told you
how beautiful your eyes are?

249
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,593
Really?

250
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:14,924
And,

251
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,536
no one else here
has such a figure like yours.

252
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,565
I can't go to bed with you.
I have a husband.

253
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,901
Tell this to someone else.

254
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,375
But you said it pretty well.
You'll get a chance.

255
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,673
I'm no longer available. Sorry.

256
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,859
Miss Chan...

257
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,857
Good evening. How are you?

258
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:48,729
Thank you.

259
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:49,665
It's her!

260
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,570
Do you know her?

261
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:55,195
Not yet, but I will soon.
See how feminine she is!

262
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,176
What do you mean by feminine?

263
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,475
You want to grab her
the moment you see her!

264
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,906
Enough said. Show your stuff!

265
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:05,675
Which one?

266
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:06,985
Playing dumb!

267
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,052
Come!

268
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,257
The floor sure is slippery!

269
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:23,435
Miss.

270
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,113
Brother Chiu. I hope nothing happened
to your merchandise.

271
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,982
Of course not.
You just get the money ready.

272
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:41,177
Money is no problem.
When are you going to deliver?

273
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,385
In three days.

274
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,020
This is my business card.
Hope we can do business.

275
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,090
Five Stars Cleaning?

276
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,031
How are you, Mr. Chan?

277
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:56,997
How do you do?

278
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,038
No problem then.

279
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:15,442
Brother Ho, we'll proceed as agreed.
Thanks for coming.

280
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:17,787
I'm going now.

281
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,822
- Bring him up here.
- Yes.

282
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,693
Wait for me outside.

283
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:29,765
Yes.

284
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,040
Your business must be pretty profitable.

285
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,071
Not bad.

286
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,972
Mr. Jack So, our brother Chiu
would like to talk business with you.

287
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:39,942
Brother Chiu?

288
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,009
Hold my glass for me. Excuse me,
I have some business to attend to.

289
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,046
No problem.

290
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,080
Please.

291
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,681
Teapot, shall we dance?

292
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,855
Sure.

293
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,695
Shall we dance, Mister?

294
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:04,066
No, thanks.

295
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,776
Boss, this is Mr. Jack So.

296
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,539
Brother Chiu, we've actually met before.
How are you?

297
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,416
Really?
I've heard you were pretty tough.

298
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,983
Not as tough as
my two previous partners.

299
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,883
Scarface Wing and Cat Shit Keung.

300
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,886
They like to slash people.

301
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,423
Then what kind of a company is
"Five Stars Cleaning"?

302
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:30,460
Awesome! Our cleaning company
is strong and muscular.

303
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,892
We have a staff of more than 100
and 5 board of directors.

304
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,427
Brother Chiu, even your place here
is under our management.

305
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,332
If you need any assistance from us,
just give me a ring.

306
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:42,498
In other words, "Five Stars Cleaning"
has one bright future!

307
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,473
Then, where did you hide the briefcase?

308
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,509
What?

309
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:51,579
Bring it back now,
or something's going to happen to you.

310
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,685
What do you mean, "something"?
I don't know what you're talking about.

311
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:57,615
So you are not talking?

312
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:58,720
I said, no!

313
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,321
Well?

314
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,661
Well? You kicked me for no reason.

315
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,858
I should ask you why!

316
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,095
Are you talking?

317
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,766
If you don't talk,
maybe your partners will.

318
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,207
Take him down
and round up all his partners.

319
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,115
What's going on?

320
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:33,382
That damn Chiu! He said to talk
business, but he asked for a briefcase.

321
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,322
I said "I don't know".
Then he pointed a gun at me...

322
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,792
and beat me so hard,
I couldn't even scream for help.

323
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:43,464
It's alright. Don't panic.
It's just a misunderstanding.

324
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,733
Misunderstanding? You even ordered
your men to round up my partners!

325
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,807
But don't worry.
I didn't expose you guys.

326
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,374
Now all my partners are here.
Come and get me! Kill me!

327
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,104
Bugging us for no reason. Let's go!

328
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,148
Please make them stay here.

329
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,641
What? Try to stop me?

330
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:04,815
Go to hell!

331
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,900
Let go!

332
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,123
Go to hell!

333
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,445
Sorry. My apologies. Goodbye.

334
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:08,146
Father, what is going on?

335
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,187
Go back in. Go in!

336
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,128
You bastard!

337
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,903
As my master said, "It's all
or nothing. Fight or die." Come on!

338
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,309
That's all you can do? I can take that!
Come here!

339
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,282
I'm stronger!

340
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,522
Better not use your leg,
or I'll break it!

341
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,490
I know that.

342
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:39,739
Freeze frame?

343
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,368
What the hell is going on?

344
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,573
I don't know
what led to all this either.

345
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,539
Looks like it won't be easy to get away.

346
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,390
Teapot, light!

347
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,130
Teapot, you hold the fort!

348
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:45,005
If you killed him,
how am I going to get my stuff back?

349
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,804
We'll wait for you outside!

350
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,211
Hey! Don't just leave me!

351
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,172
Get them!

352
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,174
"Get them" your ass!
Put out the fire first!

353
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,009
Put the fire out!

354
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,587
Step on it!

355
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,156
I'm no longer scared.

356
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,526
That's what you think.

357
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,491
Don't move!

358
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,971
Stop the car! Wait for me!

359
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,807
Don't try anything funny. Stop the car!

360
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,240
Are you crazy? Just leave me like that?

361
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,009
Luckily I got away, or else!

362
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,376
There're no real friends after all!

363
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,654
Sorry, I hopped on the wrong van.

364
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,388
Couldn't be wrong, right?

365
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:19,036
Good.
You young ones are quite impressive.

366
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,334
You even dared
to touch Chan Chiu's stuff.

367
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,268
I'm a chivalrous man.

368
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,205
Bring back the briefcase,

369
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,810
and I'll give you $200,000 as reward.

370
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,038
What briefcase?

371
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,942
Don't act dumb anymore, or I'll get mad.

372
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,348
We really didn't take it.
Don't know what you're talking about!

373
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,317
Boss, let us interrogate them.

374
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,854
Looks like they need a few cuts
before they'll talk.

375
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,493
Good. They are all yours.
Save me the grief.

376
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,358
Hey, wait a minute.

377
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:48,096
By now we shouldn't be greedy anymore.

378
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,734
Actually,
it's much better to deal with him.

379
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:51,960
At least he's straight to the point.

380
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,502
That's more like it.

381
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:54,865
Then let's settle this...

382
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,838
at Peak Park tomorrow at 9 a.m.

383
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:58,176
Okay. Let's go.

384
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,002
Be careful, man!

385
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,204
You think I'm an idiot?

386
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,439
The lady will stay as hostage.

387
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,910
No way! Brother, don't leave me here.

388
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,554
Brother and sister! That's even better.

389
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,654
Sorry, Boss.

390
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,462
Don't worry, Sis.
We'll come back and get you soon!

391
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,893
If I don't hear from you by dawn,

392
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,469
I'll kill the hostage!

393
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:26,571
You...

394
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,237
No problem. Let's go.

395
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,205
Remember.

396
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,207
Got it. Let's go.

397
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,482
Boss, should we tail them?

398
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,449
No need.
It's not good if Chan Chiu finds out.

399
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,250
There is no briefcase!
How could you say there is one?

400
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,891
That's right.
How are we going to find one?

401
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,060
Now what?

402
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:49,989
Yeah!

403
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,153
Yeah what?

404
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,157
If I didn't say we have one,
will we be here now?

405
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:54,327
I mean...

406
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:55,761
I know what you want to say.

407
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,198
You want to find just any briefcase.

408
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:00,066
This trick no longer works.

409
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,273
Not really. As long as
they're convinced it's the real thing!

410
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,571
Are you crazy?
Do you know how big it is,

411
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,371
what it looks like, and what's inside?

412
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,537
No.

413
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,341
Then how can we forge one?

414
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,176
You're always right.

415
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:14,785
What briefcase is this?

416
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:16,614
I think this is the one they want.

417
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:18,584
Why didn't you say so earlier?

418
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,156
You guys won't let me speak
when I wanted to!

419
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:22,055
Why wouldn't you let him speak?

420
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,525
Be quiet. Open it first.

421
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,006
Wow what?

422
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,676
Nothing. Just wowing in advance.

423
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,780
All U.S. bills! Look at this!

424
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:53,415
Money!
We're going to be rich!

425
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,092
They all new!
Smells good too!

426
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,193
All 100 dollars bills!

427
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,419
We're rich!

428
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,158
Look! There's a lot more!

429
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,825
They smell better than perfume!

430
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,805
Right,
they do smell better than perfume.

431
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,672
Can't you guys tell
these U.S. bills are counterfeits?

432
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,102
Stop joking!

433
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,541
This is the plate
for printing the counterfeit bills.

434
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:22,217
That's even better!
We can print them ourselves!

435
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:23,914
Do you know how?

436
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,547
No.

437
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,658
These things are useless to us.

438
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,427
You are all money-crazy.

439
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,256
We need these to save Sis.

440
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,556
That's right. Put them back.

441
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,293
All of you are heartless.
You forget Sis the moment you see money!

442
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,397
Let's go then!

443
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,938
Wait. There's no hurry.
Let's change first.

444
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,743
Do you see them?

445
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:27,782
They're not here yet.

446
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:28,783
Then let's go!

447
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,750
Go where?
Once we move, they'll find us!

448
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,857
We have to divert their attention.

449
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,995
You three lure Chan's men
to the warehouse,

450
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,163
so we can buy some time.

451
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,291
Curly, you take the two plates
and lure Ho here.

452
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,001
That's just like sending me to hell!

453
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,102
Don't worry. They won't kill you
until they get what they want.

454
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,301
I'll go get help.

455
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:50,908
Help? Do we have any?

456
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,373
No, but don't you worry about this.

457
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,873
I feel we have a dark future.

458
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,572
Relax.

459
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,148
Chan Chiu won't kill us
before he gets the plates.

460
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,719
And he won't kill us
if he only gets one plate.

461
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,092
They're approaching.

462
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,257
All yours.

463
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,655
Go look! Don't slack off!

464
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:14,560
Yes.

465
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,228
Remember, be careful.

466
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,103
Will they trick us?

467
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:23,069
How would I know?

468
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,300
Doesn't matter to me.
I'm used to being tricked.

469
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:29,373
Over there!

470
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,813
We're here!

471
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:41,823
Move!

472
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,030
I saw nothing! I don't know anything!

473
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,580
Did you kill him?

474
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:03,874
No. Just blasted off the lock.

475
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,175
Don't shoot for nothing!

476
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,115
Go!

477
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,332
Teapot, do you know how to drive?

478
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,271
Of course!

479
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,111
- Get up there.
- What for?

480
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,841
Charge out of here!

481
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:37,272
By myself?

482
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,110
Have you heard of "one against many,
many against one"?

483
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,610
Not me.

484
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,284
Go. I have to conserve my strength.

485
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,393
Fight further! Don't involve me.
Go away!

486
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,112
All you know is shoot.
What else are you good at?

487
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,153
Kung-fu.

488
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,448
Put the guns away!

489
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,617
You two have been acting cool all night.
Get to work!

490
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,386
Where have you been?
You're sweating all over.

491
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,062
I was looking for you guys.

492
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,118
There's one more here!

493
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,292
Behind me!

494
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,291
I'm nervous.

495
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,858
So am I!

496
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:10,934
It's safe here.

497
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,032
Why do you think I came here for?

498
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,471
You're a nuisance to both the living
and the dead!

499
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,614
Don't mind me. You go ahead!

500
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:15,250
Just these three.

501
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:20,722
Bring the briefcase over.
You can go over and finish them off.

502
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:27,066
Hold it!

503
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,102
Thank God!

504
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,366
Where are the other two plates?

505
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,410
We used it to buy life insurance.

506
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:34,306
What?

507
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,707
We gave it to our Big Brother.

508
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:37,508
Big Brother? Who's your Big Brother?

509
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,211
Vaseline, don't say it!

510
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,315
Talk! Or I'll kill you all.

511
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:44,746
You would if you could.
Our Big Brother will be here soon.

512
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,956
Windpipe, we have to think of ourselves.

513
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,752
If Big Brother has any honor,
he'll come and share our pains.

514
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,793
Otherwise, let him fall into the trap,

515
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,192
or go through our troubles with us.

516
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,766
Maybe he knows what's coming
and bailed out on us.

517
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,528
That's right.
Big Brothers are like that nowadays.

518
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,465
Alright. I'll wait for him here!

519
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,546
Big Brother! Don't come here!

520
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,883
Big Brother, this guy is nothing
but trouble. Let's kill him.

521
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,518
No. It's hard to find
such a loyal subordinate.

522
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,850
They're coming.

523
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,470
Ho Man?

524
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,438
Are you jerking me?

525
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:41,873
How would I dare, Big Brother?

526
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,740
I am not your Big Brother.

527
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,312
Teapot, Windpipe, Vaseline, we're here!

528
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:56,293
Big Brother.

529
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,895
Don't mention "Big Brother" again.
Whoever says them will die.

530
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,399
What?

531
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:05,893
They were right.

532
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:07,798
So you are the one behind all this.

533
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:10,567
Brother Chiu, you misunderstood.

534
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,209
Big Brother, you should step out
to take responsibilities.

535
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:15,737
These two plates for you,
and he has the other one.

536
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,140
You two settle this yourselves.

537
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,349
Brother Chiu, let's discuss this!

538
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,108
What's there to discuss? Men!

539
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:22,343
- Yes!
- Get ready!

540
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:31,523
Charge!

541
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,204
Ho Man, we'll see who'll come out alive.

542
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,379
When two tigers fight,
one of them will die.

543
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,915
And the one that's alive will
finish us off.

544
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:13,703
Big Brother, the cops are here!

545
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,105
Let's go!

546
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,370
Go!

547
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:21,102
We're going too!

548
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,081
On your knees!

549
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,815
Wow! Feels like an epic.

550
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:26,240
Ranks!

551
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,674
Be quiet! You all stand aside.

552
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:31,139
Get the evidence.

553
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:32,146
Yes sir.

554
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:36,915
Do you think he's for real?

555
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,453
Sir, all the evidence is here.

556
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,586
This time we have enough evidence...

557
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,626
to keep you in jail
for the rest of your lives.

558
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,495
Take them away.

559
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,461
Yes sir!

560
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:55,272
Get up, get up!
Take them all away! Move!

561
00:47:58,509 --> 00:47:59,976
Sir, can I ask you a question?

562
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,041
Go ahead.

563
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:02,170
Are you real or fake?

564
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,337
Of course I'm real.

565
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:06,345
I used to be
in the Royal HK Police Special Force.

566
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:09,453
I specialized in organized crime
undercover work.

567
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,687
Thank you all for your help
in this operation.

568
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:15,421
But I still need you to go back
with me for statements.

569
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:19,360
All the people I know are VIPs,
and you're no exception.

570
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,623
No wonder you're so vulgar,

571
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,164
cause you're a cop! You're good!

572
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,933
I knew you were not a fake
the first time I saw you.

573
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,572
We're heroes among heroes!

574
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,806
My master said that police
are the most hated of professions.

575
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:36,446
I'm glad I never listened to my master.

576
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:41,378
Ranks, you look so handsome
in that uniform. I like it!

577
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:44,816
I'll apply for police cadet tomorrow.
Let's go.

578
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,992
Sit down! What's the matter?

579
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:55,223
Don't know why, but I feel like...

580
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,798
I'm about to meet my mother-in-law.

581
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,397
You have a mother-in-law?

582
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:02,597
No. It's just a metaphor.
I don't feel comfortable.

583
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,299
You again, Chubby!

584
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,204
That's right, sir.

585
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:07,207
What're you here for this time?

586
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,875
Don't know.
Maybe it's for some unfinished business.

587
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,274
Let me help you.

588
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:14,146
Sir, are you high in rank?

589
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,586
Do you know what three stars mean?

590
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:17,718
I don't know.

591
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,625
Three stars mean Chief Inspector.

592
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,457
Teapot, give me your hands.

593
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,232
Turn them over.

594
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,173
For me?

595
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:42,310
And here's $20,000 reward.

596
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:47,110
Thank you sir.
We have money to get married!

597
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,482
7086.

598
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:51,450
Sir!

599
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,318
You're partially responsible
for this case's success.

600
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:54,515
This is to reward you.

601
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:58,354
Thank you, sir!

602
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:01,456
Sir, just a gift?
Will there be a raise?

603
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:02,494
Sure.

604
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,362
Really?

605
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,663
Not now. Wait until the government
adjusts the wages.

606
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,869
That means never.

607
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:10,771
MADAM!

608
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:12,209
Ceci.

609
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,734
Well?

610
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,310
Gave me this little dingy.

611
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,914
That's good! It's to encourage you.

612
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:19,878
Getting a raise
will be more encouraging!

613
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,383
I've something to tell you.

614
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,383
What?

615
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:24,916
I'm going to marry you.

616
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:28,959
Really? Sorry, Chubby.

617
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:32,358
She's willing to marry me!
I've been waiting for this!

618
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,729
Congratulations.

619
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:37,928
Can't you shake my hands
after I've kissed her?

620
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,567
I'll treat you two to dim sum.

621
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:40,999
Good! Let's see who runs the fastest.

622
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:41,866
Okay.

623
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:44,601
Wait!
You have to carry your girlfriend,

624
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,333
and I'll carry mine, Okay?

625
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,272
Sure!

626
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:51,140
1, 2, 3!
