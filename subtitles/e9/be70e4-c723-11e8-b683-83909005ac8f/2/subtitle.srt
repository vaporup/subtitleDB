1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,819
When did you ...
When were you gonna tell me?

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,098
Soon. Now.

3
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,938
How am I part of the decision now?

4
00:00:09,737 --> 00:00:11,497
What am I supposed to say now?

5
00:00:19,016 --> 00:00:22,374
So, the daddy bear plants his seed
in the mommy bear

6
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:25,093
and it grows into an egg.

7
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:27,414
Is this about fucking?

8
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:32,373
Do you know what that means?

9
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:36,291
The boy puts his pee pee
in the girl's doo doo.

10
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:41,010
Well ...

11
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,329
Haven't you ever wished
you had somebody around to play with?

12
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,648
No.

13
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:47,168
You might like it.

14
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:49,007
What if I don't like it?

15
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,848
Then you get used to it.

16
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:53,086
Just because you're used to
something ...

17
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,605
doesn't mean you like it.

18
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:56,207
You're used to me.

19
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:01,405
Yes, well ...

20
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:05,725
In a few months we're all gonna
get used to somebody new.

21
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:11,963
Beautiful.

22
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:16,122
Hey Kev. Come on and meet your
little sister.

23
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:19,321
This is your brother. It's Kevin.

24
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:21,960
It's your big brother.

25
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:25,319
Yes, that's right.

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,479
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes ...

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,598
Kevin! Don't do that.

28
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:35,157
No, Kevin. That's not nice.

29
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:37,157
No problem dear.

30
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:39,477
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.

31
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:57,072
Christ! To Ecuador? For 2 months?
Why can't they send someone else?

32
00:01:57,073 --> 00:02:00,512
I really wanna work this deal.

33
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,630
First he cries too much,
then he's too quiet.

34
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:08,269
Then he makes up his own little language,
and that is annoying.

35
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,149
He has trouble communicating.
A lot of kids do.

36
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,828
And you see this as some kind
of personal vendetta?

37
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,268
It's not good for him.

38
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:19,946
Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!

39
00:02:19,947 --> 00:02:21,867
Pick up the god damn phone.

40
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:27,465
... 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19 ...

41
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:31,544
... 20, 21, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27 ...

42
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:48,422
Please. Please. Let me have
a drink. Please

43
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,460
Kevin?

44
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:57,938
Kevin!

45
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:01,298
Honey?

46
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:05,616
Are you ok?

47
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:32,171
I'm sorry mom.

48
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,718
Not to worry, sweetheart.

49
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:37,610
You couldn't help it.

50
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,487
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.

51
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,287
"Aren't thou the devil in blue to shoot in that way?"

52
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:49,686
"Nay," posed Robin, laughing.
"Not quite so ill as that I trust."

53
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,566
"Then he took up another shaft ..."
Are you okay, honey?

54
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:02,483
Then he took up another shaft,
and fitted it to the string.

55
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:03,922
Again he shot.

56
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:07,121
Again, he smoathed the arrow
close beside the center.

57
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,441
The third time, he losed his bowstring

58
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:12,000
and dropped the arrow
just betwix the other two,

59
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,440
and into the very center,

60
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:16,001
so that the feathers of all three
were ruffled together

61
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:19,358
seeming from a distance
to be one big shaft.

62
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,358
And now a low murmur
ran all along the great crowd.

63
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,199
Hey champ. How are you doing?

64
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:27,598
Feeling better?

65
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:30,797
Go away. I'm tired.

66
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:33,997
Oh. Okay.

67
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:37,835
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?

68
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:40,395
Don't stop reading, mom.

69
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,471
280 score shafts were shot in all

70
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:53,911
and so deftly were they sped,
that when the shooting was done

71
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:57,189
each target looked like the
back of a hedgehog ...

72
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,911
when a farm dog snuffed at it.

73
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,018
Good afternoon, ma'am.

74
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,018
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.

75
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,537
Well, it is actually.

76
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:54,778
Well, we just have a couple
of quick questions for you.

77
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:56,778
What is it about?

78
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:59,657
Do you know where you are
spending the afterlife?

79
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:03,326
Oh, yeah. I do as a matter of fact.

80
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,014
I'm going straight to hell.

81
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:07,174
Eternal damnation.

82
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:09,894
Thank you for asking.
Okay?

83
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:19,172
Hey honey. Let me help you with that.

84
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:23,251
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?

85
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,690
Sure.

86
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,329
I'm glad you're feeling better.

87
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,569
Do you want some more of that
chowder for lunch?

88
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,008
Whatever.

89
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:36,368
- Or grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.

90
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,364
Thanks Dad, this is so cool.

91
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:49,724
You're welcome, buddy.

92
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:51,725
Right. Here we go.
In the middle.

93
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:54,203
Ooooh. Almost. Here.

94
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:56,683
Take that one.
Try again.

95
00:06:57,803 --> 00:06:59,283
Use your finger ...

96
00:07:00,282 --> 00:07:01,602
Keep your eyes in the middle.

97
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,789
Good shot, Kev.

98
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,788
You're a natural.

99
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:03,626
Perfect.

100
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:05,228
Thanks Dad.

101
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,698
Right.

102
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:46,737
It's like this.

103
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:50,497
You wake up.

104
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:52,656
Then you watch TV.

105
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:57,134
You get in the car, then you
listen to the radio.

106
00:08:57,135 --> 00:09:01,533
Then you go to you little job
or your little school

107
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:04,973
but we're not gonna hear about
that on the 6pm news.

108
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,412
Why?

109
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:11,212
Because nothing is really happening.

110
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:15,370
Then you go home
and watch some more TV.

111
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:18,090
Or maybe it's a fun night,
and you go out

112
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,851
and you watch a movie.

113
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,928
I mean it's got so bad,
that half the time

114
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,688
the people on TV,

115
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:29,607
inside the TV,
they're watching TV.

116
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:33,767
And what are all these
people watching?

117
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,485
People like me.

118
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:46,405
And what are all you
doing right now?

119
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:49,043
You're watching me.

120
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:54,161
Don't you think you would
have changed the channel by now

121
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:56,802
if all I did
was getting "A" in geometry?

122
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,069
Me and Kevin were plaiying
"Christmas kidnapping".

123
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,150
Kevin!

124
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:52,228
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.

125
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:55,028
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.

126
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:07,344
Not that, you retard.

127
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:08,664
Get me a Root Beer.

128
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:11,024
What ?

129
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:17,743
Thank you, Celia.
I was thirsty.

130
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:22,780
Hey, you wanne know a secret?

131
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:24,141
Come closer.

132
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:27,339
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?

133
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,539
It's the vacuum monster.

134
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,538
Cut it out!

135
00:11:38,377 --> 00:11:40,537
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!

136
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:44,295
Ho, ho, ho. See what I got!
Kev, come here. Give me a hand.

137
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,616
Yeah, sure dad.

138
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:08,517
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.

139
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:15,156
- Come on. Just one.
- I don't dance, really.

140
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:28,752
Where do you get off,
you stuck up bitch?

141
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:34,591
Do you think anyone else
is gonna want you now?

142
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:54,586
Come on. Stay for another drink.

143
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,025
Come on.
Come on.

144
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:18,900
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

145
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,140
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer!

146
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,641
- Should we?
- Yeah.

147
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,175
Kevin!

148
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:24,246
Didn't I see you at the
bookstore today?

149
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,404
No.

150
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:31,925
Oh, I could have sworn.

151
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:40,401
By the way, are you doing
anything on Friday?

152
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:45,040
Why?

153
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,479
I just thought we might
do something together.

154
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
For fun.

155
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:55,118
Like, do what?

156
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,117
Maybe take you for dinner.

157
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,237
Or play around with
miniature golf?

158
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:18,273
Okay.

159
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,509
Why didn't you bring a coat?

160
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:37,788
You just can't get uncomfortable
enough, can you?

161
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:40,868
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?

162
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:54,385
Whenever I see fat people,
they are always eating.

163
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:58,943
Dont' give me any of this "slower
metabolism thyroid gland" crap.

164
00:16:58,944 --> 00:17:00,463
It's food.

165
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:02,381
They are fat because
they eat the wrong food.

166
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,382
Too much of it, and all the time.

167
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,420
You know, you can be
kind of harsh sometimes.

168
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,819
You're one to talk.

169
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,726
Yeah, I am.

170
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:18,339
I wonder where I got it.

171
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:38,134
Well, you won.

172
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:01,809
So. What next, momsy?

173
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,487
We're gonna go home. You're gonna get
changed into something reasonable.

174
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:07,088
And I take you to dinner.

175
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:09,006
Great.

176
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:23,803
We're going to dinner.

177
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:27,642
I was hungry.

178
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:29,962
I'm a growing boy, you know.

179
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,319
I'll have a calorie salad,

180
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,037
steak, medium rare,
and a bottle of Merlot.

181
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:50,438
Very well.

182
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:06,674
So, how is school going?

183
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,392
It's going.

184
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,751
on a course schedule.

185
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:20,749
How about the teachers?
Are there any of them ...

186
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,710
Right, right, what bands am
I listening to these days?

187
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:28,588
Next you can read all about if there
isn't some cute little cunt

188
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:30,827
in the front row
who's got me itchy.

189
00:19:30,828 --> 00:19:34,267
Then you can segway into the whole,
it's all up to me of course

190
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:39,146
but before balling the chick in the hallway
I might decide to way until I'm ready.

191
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:42,264
Right around dessert,
you can ask about drugs

192
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,624
Real careful, like

193
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,224
cause you don't want to scare me
into, like, lying my head off.

194
00:19:46,225 --> 00:19:49,304
So you have to say, like,
how you experimented.

195
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:54,142
Then finally once you've sucked
up that entire bottle of wine,

196
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:55,541
you can go all gooey eyed

197
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,421
and say how nice it is to spend
quality time together,

198
00:19:58,422 --> 00:20:01,941
then scooch over and put your
arm around my shoulder.

199
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,300
Give it a little squeeze.

200
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:54,194
Fuck!

201
00:22:04,552 --> 00:22:08,272
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah. It's fucked.

202
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:13,591
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.

203
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:23,029
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.

204
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:28,226
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?

205
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:31,025
I don't like stamps.

206
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:35,985
But what is the point?

207
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:39,846
There is no point.

208
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,543
That's the point.

209
00:22:47,342 --> 00:22:51,022
No, it really hasn't been any trouble at all.
Everybody is bringing a dish.

210
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:05,338
Oh. That's him now. I got to go.
You have a great day.

211
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,697
Bye, mom.

212
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:12,057
Merry Christmas.

213
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,052
Alright, Kev.
You're next.

214
00:23:31,572 --> 00:23:33,011
Can you guess what it is?

215
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:41,689
That's a series 7. The guy in the
store said it was the best one.

216
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,208
- Gee, dad. Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.

217
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:57,086
What did you have for breakfast?

218
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:03,085
Had a good day, Snuffles?

219
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:20,720
Did you hear that thump?

220
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:22,520
That's a powerful thing, man.

221
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:33,478
Celia!

222
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:40,716
Come on, honey. Time for bed
Here we go.

223
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,153
I thought I closed the door.

224
00:24:54,353 --> 00:24:57,473
Kevin said I was stupid,
and he was right.

225
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:00,671
You're not stupid, honey.

226
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,910
Don't you worry. We'll find him.
Now you scoop down. Come on.

227
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:14,188
Cozy?

228
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,379
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to
the big pet store in the sky.

229
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,897
- Don't say that! Don't say that!
- Yes. It's the truth!

230
00:25:56,898 --> 00:25:58,337
Dearly beloved,

231
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:01,057
We are gathered here
to mourn mr. Snuffles ...

232
00:26:01,058 --> 00:26:02,336
Stop it!

233
00:26:02,337 --> 00:26:07,616
Who will ... tragically early ...

234
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:12,254
So daddy and mommy were looking for him
the whole night.

235
00:26:12,255 --> 00:26:14,573
And you know why we couldn't find him?

236
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:18,253
Because Snuffles has gone
to live in the garden.

237
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:20,691
He's living in the garden now,

238
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:23,732
with a whole bunch of new animal friends.

239
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:28,412
Celia.

240
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,250
Okay, give me the spoon.

241
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,689
So, they're having a big party tonight...

242
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:45,167
with the chipmunks, and the squarrels,
and the racoons ...

243
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:49,727
and they're eating nuts, and berries,

244
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:55,725
and they're gonna have a whole bunch ...

245
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:09,988
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?

246
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,347
I didn't.

247
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,306
- I put it way.
- Then how did it get out?

248
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,702
Ask Kevin.

249
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:29,823
Kevin did it.

250
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:35,342
You need to go talk to someone.

251
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:53,604
Uhm Kev. Mom has something
else she wanted to tell you.

252
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:05,801
I wanted to ...

253
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:09,480
thank you for calling the ambulance.

254
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,439
And?

255
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:17,878
And ...

256
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:24,597
I was concerned that you might
be feeling responsible.

257
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:27,475
Why is that?

258
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,394
Because you was supposed to
be looking after her.

259
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:33,554
We just don't want you to
blame yourself.

260
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:38,193
No. I don't ...
I never said I did.

261
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:41,791
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.

262
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:45,311
So, we would appreciate you
looking after her,

263
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:47,311
and any namecalling ...

264
00:30:49,111 --> 00:30:52,509
You don't really remember being
a kid much do you, dad?

265
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:55,470
Celia is just gonna have to
suck it up.

266
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,266
I thought you didn't like those.

267
00:31:05,387 --> 00:31:08,106
Well, they're a ...
Now what do you call it ...

268
00:31:11,145 --> 00:31:12,985
an acquired taste.

269
00:32:08,612 --> 00:32:10,092
I'm so sorry.

270
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,450
There you go.

271
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:26,169
Okay.

272
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:32,407
Thank you, mommy.

273
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:49,283
- Hey kiddo. You're going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.

274
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:52,482
- Hey Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!

275
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:16,876
So ...
What do you want to do?

276
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,074
Let's wait for the school year to end,

277
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:30,633
and make arrangements for this summer.

278
00:33:34,073 --> 00:33:36,592
At least the custody
is a no-brainer.

279
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:39,431
Is it?

280
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:44,870
You've decided?

281
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,069
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.

282
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:52,588
It already happened.

283
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:07,745
- I needed a drink of water.
- Hi, Kev.

284
00:34:09,825 --> 00:34:11,343
Listen, buddy,

285
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:15,183
it's easy to misunderstand something
if you hear it out of context.

286
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:20,942
Why would I not know the "context"?

287
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,180
I am the context.

288
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:45,255
- You have to appeal to reject punitive damage.
- No.

289
00:34:45,256 --> 00:34:47,413
You'll lose everything.
The business, your house.

290
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:49,654
I hate the house.
I always have.

291
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:51,254
You'll rot in hell!

292
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:13,410
A personal for Kevin Khatcha ...
dourian?

293
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:21,727
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is?

294
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:25,966
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

295
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,839
What are these for?
You never ride your bike.

296
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,558
I got these for a song of the web.

297
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:02,037
You make a bundle on them at school.

298
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:04,757
Like Donald Trump, huh.

299
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:45,467
I'll take you back to my ship.

300
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:55,450
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

301
00:37:55,451 --> 00:37:57,611
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

302
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:59,769
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

303
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,929
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

304
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,408
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

305
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,248
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

306
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:08,408
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

307
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:12,087
Ready for the big dip?

308
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:17,365
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

309
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:19,525
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

310
00:38:19,526 --> 00:38:21,766
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

311
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:23,845
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

312
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:26,243
I'm charmed to meet you,
young lady

313
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,723
- Yeah.
- Did you eat all your cereal?

314
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:37,841
- Yes.
- Did you eat all your cereal?

315
00:38:37,842 --> 00:38:39,201
Alright.

316
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,158
You're a little clammy.
Are you okay?

317
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,999
Never better.

318
00:38:54,638 --> 00:38:58,076
Hey. Only three days to go
till you're 16.

319
00:38:58,077 --> 00:39:01,116
We should do something.
How about Sunday?

320
00:39:01,117 --> 00:39:02,876
I don't know.

321
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:05,115
I might be tied up.

322
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:10,113
Come clean up some of this mess
and then we're gonna get dressed and go.

323
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,433
I do not want to go to school.

324
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:14,152
I know, but daddy have to take a shower
and then we'll go.

325
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:15,993
Say goodbye!

326
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,588
Do you think we could make some time
later to talk. Just the two of us,

327
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:30,949
without the kids?

328
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,428
I really wanna work this thing out.

329
00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:37,507
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?

330
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,618
Franklin ...

331
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:18,058
Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin ...

332
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:47,731
I have my son in here.

333
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:51,131
Kevin?

334
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,930
Kevin!

335
00:41:01,089 --> 00:41:02,368
Kevin!

336
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,008
Kevin!

337
00:42:51,943 --> 00:42:55,142
Lauren!

338
00:44:15,843 --> 00:44:18,042
Franklin?

339
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,400
Celia?

340
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,880
Franklin?

341
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:40,398
Celia?

342
00:49:18,412 --> 00:49:20,570
You don't look happy.

343
00:49:26,331 --> 00:49:27,771
Have I ever?

344
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,769
I'm almost 18, aren't I?

345
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:41,927
What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous??

346
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:45,687
Nervous?

347
00:49:47,926 --> 00:49:50,726
Do you know anything about
those places?

348
00:49:59,523 --> 00:50:01,923
Well. You managed it all so well.

349
00:50:03,523 --> 00:50:08,481
A child of a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.

350
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,640
You'll be out of here
in a couple of years.

351
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:21,358
Do you know what day it is today?

352
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,758
Why the let me come see you
on a monday?

353
00:50:24,637 --> 00:50:28,397
Sure. It's my anniversary.

354
00:50:30,556 --> 00:50:32,235
Two years.

355
00:50:33,836 --> 00:50:36,315
Plenty of time to think about it.

356
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:54,711
I want you to tell me why.

357
00:51:14,065 --> 00:51:15,905
I used to think I knew.

358
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:21,424
Now I'm not so sure.

359
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,099
Time is up.
