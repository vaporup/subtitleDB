1
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:35,208
When you go to the ball ...

2
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,688
you have to learn how to dance
like a princess, right?

3
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:41,248
1, 2, 3 ...
1, 2, 3 ...

4
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:42,608
- 1, 2, 3 ...
- Yeah!

5
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,089
What are you gonna wear today?

6
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,649
- I'm gonna wear ...
- You're gonna wear ...

7
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,489
- I'm gonna wear ...
- A bucket on your head.

8
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,369
- No!
- 1, 2, 3 ... No?

9
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,329
- And a barrel round your bottom.
- No!

10
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,610
- And cloth bags for shoes?
- Nooo!

11
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:59,572
1, 2, 3 ...
1, 2, 3 ...

12
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:04,132
1, 2, 3 ...
1, 2, 3 ...

13
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:13,893
Good morning.

14
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:18,493
Hey buddy!

15
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:20,133
Want something to eat?

16
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:22,934
No. I'm not hungry.

17
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:32,710
Yeah, that's fine.

18
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,870
Yeah.

19
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:55,697
Franklin?

20
00:08:55,976 --> 00:09:00,073
Hey. It's me. I just
wanted to leave a message.

21
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:03,712
Do you think we could make
some time to talk later

22
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:05,792
just the two of us without kids?

23
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:08,632
I really wanna work this thing out.

24
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,714
Okay?
I miss you.

25
00:09:43,197 --> 00:09:45,878
Eva Khatchadourian!

26
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,360
It's a lot.

27
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,080
Look, Eva.

28
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:10,720
I don't really care who you are

29
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:13,320
or what you've done as long as
you can type and you can file.

30
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,121
You can have this job.

31
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:19,602
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you.

32
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:25,081
I wont let you down.
I promise you. Thank you.

33
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,003
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

34
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:30,123
See you Monday.

35
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:32,763
Great. Thank you.

36
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:55,725
Looks like someone is having
a nice day?

37
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,245
Enjoying yourself?

38
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:58,686
I'm sorry?

39
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:07,207
I hope you rot in hell, you
fucking bitch!

40
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:15,887
Jesus. What the hell was that?
Are you ok?

41
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:17,208
No, no, no, it's nothing.
Its really... its nothing.

42
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,328
- Let me call an ambulance.
- No, no, it was my fault.

43
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,249
- But she just ...
- No, no, I'm fine.

44
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,378
Eva, when are you coming home?

45
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:42,378
I missed you.

46
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,819
I love you.

47
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:39,105
Promise me you'll never
go away again.

48
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:42,705
I will never, never,
never go away again.

49
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:46,906
Promise me. Promise me

50
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:49,866
you'll never go away again.

51
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:00,667
Is it safe?

52
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:01,988
No, it's not safe.

53
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:04,268
Sure?

54
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:09,868
Are you sure about this?

55
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,713
This really happened?

56
00:14:52,473 --> 00:14:55,234
I can see, I can feel it ...

57
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:15,797
We did it.

58
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:25,997
I'm gonna need these processed
today, Eva.

59
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:28,837
Uh, but today my afternoon off.

60
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:30,157
You remember? I told you.

61
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,798
Ah shit, that's right.

62
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,958
- Look, give these to Massughi.
- Sure.

63
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:37,934
- Hi Eva.
- Hey, Al.

64
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,903
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!

65
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,584
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.

66
00:19:18,585 --> 00:19:21,866
Hey lady. Lady. Lady. Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!

67
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:27,306
Get off of me!

68
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:36,787
Eva, you can stop holding back.

69
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:39,667
Stop holding back, Eva.

70
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,108
Eva!

71
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:38,881
Rise and shine.

72
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:42,201
It's late, Eva.

73
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:44,402
The day is almost over.

74
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:48,002
- Hiii! - Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.

75
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:50,002
I just put him down, Franklin.

76
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:54,362
Hi.

77
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:58,364
There he is. You wanna play?

78
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,604
You wanna play?

79
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:05,205
It's alright.

80
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:09,525
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.

81
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:13,126
Do you think I'm exaggerating?

82
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:17,805
You just have to rock him a
little bit.

83
00:22:17,806 --> 00:22:20,807
You just have to rock him a
little bit.

84
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:23,246
There's my little dude!

85
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,298
Jesus! All 12?

86
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:09,538
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken ...

87
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,939
I will take them as they are!

88
00:24:40,943 --> 00:24:43,502
You're gonna be a good looking boy.

89
00:24:43,503 --> 00:24:46,343
All the girls are gonna love you.

90
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:04,905
I know it. Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.

91
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:10,146
Can you say "mommy"?

92
00:25:10,147 --> 00:25:14,347
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?

93
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:17,787
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".

94
00:25:19,427 --> 00:25:20,708
"Ball"?

95
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:22,828
No?
Okay.

96
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:26,547
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're
gonna roll it back to me, okay?

97
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:27,908
Okay.

98
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,589
Roll it back to mommy.

99
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:35,349
Roll it back. Roll.
Roll it back.

100
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,910
Okay, okay.

101
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:49,790
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.

102
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:51,951
Roll it back.
Roll it back.

103
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:55,310
When he was a baby,
he never stopped screaming.

104
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:57,512
I thought maybe it had damaged
his hearing.

105
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:03,193
No, his hearing is fine.

106
00:26:06,352 --> 00:26:08,513
But shouldn't he be talking by now?

107
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:12,393
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing
was the...

108
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:14,554
an early sign of autism.

109
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:19,834
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.

110
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:24,155
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

111
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:32,796
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?

112
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:36,516
But there is nothing wrong with him.

113
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:43,837
Thank you.

114
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:51,717
Okay.

115
00:26:51,718 --> 00:26:53,198
Roll it back to mom.

116
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:03,158
Okay. Gonna roll it back again.

117
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:04,719
That was really good, Kevin.

118
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,680
Okay. Here we go.
Okay?

119
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,561
Okay?

120
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:24,521
"E" is for elephant,
large as a house,

121
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:28,001
he's big as can be,
not small as a mouse.

122
00:27:28,002 --> 00:27:31,762
Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?

123
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:34,043
"Elephant".

124
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:36,924
Kevin!

125
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:40,723
Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?

126
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:42,283
No!

127
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:44,643
- "mommy"?
- No!

128
00:27:44,644 --> 00:27:46,684
- Just say "mommy".
- No.

129
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:37,425
Trick or treat?

130
00:30:39,264 --> 00:30:42,545
Trick or treat?
Hey lady. We know you're in there.

131
00:30:56,347 --> 00:30:57,666
I don't like that!

132
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:58,987
I don't like that!

133
00:31:00,147 --> 00:31:01,547
I don't like that!

134
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:06,148
Mommy was happy before little Kevin
came along. Do you know that?

135
00:31:07,988 --> 00:31:11,468
And now mommy wakes up every morning...

136
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:14,629
and wishes she was in France!

137
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:28,910
That elevator is a death trap.

138
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:31,430
He needs a yard,
somewhere he can toss a ball,

139
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,751
fill a pool.

140
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,551
But I love New York.

141
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:38,910
Come on!

142
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:40,711
You sound like a bumper sticker.

143
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:43,231
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.

144
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:45,192
He's only gonna be a kid once.

145
00:31:46,025 --> 00:31:47,992
You can house hunt all you want.

146
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,873
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.

147
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,793
Kevin, stop that. That's enough.

148
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:54,392
Let mommy and daddy talk.

149
00:31:54,393 --> 00:31:55,953
Kevin, quit that!

150
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:02,754
You have your family room here.

151
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:06,275
Master bedroom is back there
and two huge walking closets.

152
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:09,356
The bathroom is amazing.

153
00:32:27,757 --> 00:32:29,076
Here we are guys.

154
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:30,838
Our very own castle.

155
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:10,962
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?

156
00:33:26,444 --> 00:33:28,405
Hey! Hey!
Wait up! Ms. K!

157
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:34,814
Hey. It's me.

158
00:33:35,822 --> 00:33:36,926
Soweto.

159
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:42,046
Hi there.

160
00:33:44,527 --> 00:33:46,407
I just wanted to see how you were.

161
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:51,327
I'm fine. Thanks.

162
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:54,247
You look well.

163
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:58,248
Yeah. The doctors are saying there's
a chance I might walk again.

164
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:00,369
That's great.

165
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,289
You take care, ms. K.

166
00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:07,969
You too.

167
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:44,893
Come on, come on!

168
00:34:44,894 --> 00:34:47,733
Die! Die!

169
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:49,974
No! No! No!

170
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,934
- Die!
- How do you jump?

171
00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:56,975
Die!

172
00:35:01,495 --> 00:35:03,136
Go! Go! Go! Go!

173
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:05,056
Die!

174
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:17,976
Hey Kev? Are you out there?

175
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:19,377
Kevin?

176
00:35:20,058 --> 00:35:22,778
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.

177
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:26,938
You can do that too.

178
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:52,020
So you want a connector right there.

179
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:55,861
You see? And click on that link
and it should open right up.

180
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,621
And If it doesn't ...
we'll try it again.

181
00:35:59,622 --> 00:36:02,743
- So you left click. Wanna give it a try?
- Yes.

182
00:36:04,023 --> 00:36:05,502
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.

183
00:36:05,503 --> 00:36:08,742
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.

184
00:36:08,743 --> 00:36:10,742
See that? It comes up.

185
00:36:10,743 --> 00:36:14,344
Right. Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.

186
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:16,744
Thank you for your help.

187
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:34,587
I pooped.

188
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:36,867
Hey buddy. What?

189
00:36:38,747 --> 00:36:40,146
You pooped?

190
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:42,987
Oh okay. Here let me help you.

191
00:36:42,988 --> 00:36:44,308
Okay.

192
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,548
Go to your room. I'll be right there.

193
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,587
Let's not wake up mommy.

194
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:52,429
Go on! Go on, buddy.

195
00:37:27,072 --> 00:37:30,913
These scribled squares of paper. They are dumb.

196
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:37,313
Everybody needs a room of their own.

197
00:37:37,314 --> 00:37:39,233
You have your room.
This is the mother's room.

198
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:42,233
I can help you make your room special,
if you'd like.

199
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:44,195
What do you mean, "Special"?

200
00:37:46,075 --> 00:37:48,955
Well, so it looks like your personality.

201
00:37:49,956 --> 00:37:52,755
What personality?

202
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:56,356
I think you know what I mean.

203
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:00,397
They're dumb.

204
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,679
No, no, no. I mean it's good.

205
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,279
You don't need me to do that?

206
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,880
And... and the guy...

207
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,680
Okay.

208
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,240
Well, I mean if you handle the lot ...

209
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:40,000
I could.

210
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:41,281
Really?

211
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,881
Well. That all sounds great.

212
00:38:46,882 --> 00:38:48,201
Okay, John.

213
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:51,403
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.

214
00:39:00,203 --> 00:39:01,724
Kevin?

215
00:39:03,764 --> 00:39:05,124
Kevin?

216
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:49,769
What else do you have to say?

217
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:53,090
Go wash your face!

218
00:40:09,931 --> 00:40:12,092
He said, he's really sorry.

219
00:40:13,492 --> 00:40:16,133
And that he was only trying to help
make it special.

220
00:40:39,495 --> 00:40:41,375
Do you remember how you got that?

221
00:40:43,496 --> 00:40:45,896
It's the most honest thing
you ever did.

222
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:51,336
Do you know how they potty train cats?

223
00:40:52,257 --> 00:40:54,497
They stick their noses in their own shit.

224
00:40:56,777 --> 00:40:58,416
They don't like it.

225
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:00,577
So they use the box.

226
00:41:03,138 --> 00:41:05,417
Okay. Let's work on our counting.

227
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:08,258
- What comes after 3?
- 9.

228
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:13,459
- What comes after 7?
- 71.

229
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,058
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

230
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:20,139
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

231
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,540
21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30,

232
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:29,100
31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

233
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:34,861
41, 42, 43, 44, 45,
46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

234
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:37,022
Now, can we quit?

235
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:47,632
There.

236
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,304
You can add that together
if you think you're so smart.

237
00:42:05,785 --> 00:42:07,425
You did not ...

238
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:11,386
You did not ...

239
00:42:31,068 --> 00:42:33,148
Are you enjoying yourself?

240
00:43:04,152 --> 00:43:06,632
I can see the doctor by myself.

241
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:24,354
I have to tell you something, Eva.

242
00:43:25,554 --> 00:43:27,915
It's a brave boy you've got there.

243
00:43:33,955 --> 00:43:36,316
- Thank you.
- That's fine.

244
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:01,839
What mamma did
was very, very wrong.

245
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:06,320
And she's so, so sorry.

246
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:21,121
Kev? Kev, hold on a sec!

247
00:44:22,402 --> 00:44:23,801
Kev?

248
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,722
Kevin?

249
00:44:27,402 --> 00:44:30,002
Hey Kev.
What happened?

250
00:44:30,762 --> 00:44:32,201
I broke my arm.

251
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,002
How did you brake your arm?

252
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:35,762
I had poopy pants.

253
00:44:35,762 --> 00:44:38,117
Mommy went to get wipes.

254
00:44:38,123 --> 00:44:41,243
I fell off the changing table
onto my dump trucks.

255
00:44:41,244 --> 00:44:43,964
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.

256
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,045
It's all my fault.

257
00:44:54,165 --> 00:44:56,245
No, don't be silly.

258
00:44:56,246 --> 00:44:58,966
You can't watch him
every second of the day.

259
00:45:27,049 --> 00:45:28,609
Franklin ...

260
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:44,691
Unbelievable.

261
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:48,131
How did you get him
to do that?

262
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:54,172
Well, whatever it was it worked.

263
00:46:08,653 --> 00:46:10,134
Not yet.

264
00:46:21,336 --> 00:46:22,735
Okay.

265
00:46:41,018 --> 00:46:42,377
I love you, kiddo.

266
00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:50,305
I don't like that.
Turn it off.

267
00:48:01,787 --> 00:48:04,506
Honey. Do you mind if we stop
over at the store?

268
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:06,627
I wanna go home.

269
00:48:07,707 --> 00:48:09,988
It's just that I need to pick up...

270
00:48:18,549 --> 00:48:19,869
Home it is.

271
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,071
Hi guys!

272
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:43,072
Hi Dad. How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?

273
00:48:53,553 --> 00:48:55,873
Eva, he is just a boy.

274
00:48:56,953 --> 00:48:59,672
He's a sweet little boy.

275
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:01,674
That's what boys do.

276
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,800
Mom is fat!
