1
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:50,712
(man over PA.) As you can see.
Lynn never breaks her dog's rhythm.

2
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:52,752
She uses rapid-fire. multiple disks.

3
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:56,050
throwing them high to display
Muffy's wonderful coordination and agility.

4
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:59,614
A terrific exhibition
by last year's runners-up.

5
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:02,423
Next up. Judith Lynman and Rocky.

6
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:06,193
- watch how Rocky doesn't take off...
- watch this one.

7
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:08,234
wow! Let's try it.

8
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:10,496
Come on. Bruiser. give it to me. Drop it.

9
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,267
Let it go. Bruiser. Let it go.
Let it go. Come on.

10
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:18,809
Strong toss. and he catches it!

11
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:23,777
Go on. Bruiser. get it. Get it.

12
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,586
Easy. even toss. and he grabs it.

13
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:33,752
Go! Get it. Bruiser.
wanna get it? Look! Look!

14
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:37,058
Jump. Bruiser! Oh. man!

15
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,430
winner of the 1 9 7 8 South Florida
Frisbee Dog Championship

16
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,526
is Judith Lynman and Rocky!

17
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:45,571
l'm gonna teach you real hard.

18
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,698
All right. boys. let's go.
what do you say?

19
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:51,437
That dumb dog will never
learn to catch a Frisbee.

20
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,672
He will so. and don't call him dumb!

21
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:56,181
How about retarded?

22
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,581
Some day he's gonna win that
championship.

23
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:00,552
Don't make me laugh.

24
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,185
All right. guys. l guess...

25
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:22,367
You know. Bill.
l don't really feel like cooking tonight.

26
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:26,208
You don't have to cook. we'll get
in the boat and get some hamburgers.

27
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,477
Guess what.
David's got the hots for Jennifer Bradley.

28
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,678
- Shut up. you dehydrated pizza face.
- Dad. he's knuckling me!

29
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:36,813
David! Just stop provoking
your little brother. please.

30
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,687
- But. Dad!
- No. really!

31
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:42,717
That's the last l wanna hear from both of
you. Now give us a break.

32
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,855
l can't believe this.

33
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:50,394
(little brother) Dad. can l play at Billy's?

34
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,938
Yeah. l guess so.
Just look out for the fireworks.

35
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:55,372
(Mother) Make sure you be back before
dark.

36
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:57,171
Give me that.

37
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:58,608
- weasel!
- Dork!

38
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:01,078
- Butt-face!
- Scuzz-bucket!

39
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:06,150
You'll never see your ninth birthday.
l promise!

40
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:12,447
(" ''You're the One That l want'')

41
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,895
(Mother) l wish you two
would try to get along.

42
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,299
- He's a jerk.
- Ah. come on. it's just a phase.

43
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,737
- He'll grow out of it.
- lf he lives that long.

44
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,535
ls that any way to
talk about your little brother?

45
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,200
No. l guess not.

46
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:32,073
Just try and remember
you're the oldest. all right?

47
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:33,976
All right. all right.

48
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:37,608
- Hi. David.
- Hi. Jennifer.

49
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,284
(boy.) Hi. Jennifer.

50
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:48,123
- Finally!
- (girl) what took you so long?

51
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:50,526
Hey. think fast!

52
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:58,461
Honey. stay out of the refrigerator.
we're going out to dinner soon.

53
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:01,530
Don't worry. l'll be hungry.

54
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:04,270
- Come on. boy.
- Do you know how to open these?

55
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,335
- Yes. l do. dear.
- Thank you.

56
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:10,474
(Casey Kasem over radio.) On the fourth
of July. 1 9 7 8. an American Top 40 extra.

57
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,575
- David.
- Dad!

58
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:18,488
- Aren't you gonna watch the game?
- l was just... watching the boats.

59
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:19,991
Oh. Yeah?

60
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,726
Oh.

61
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:34,502
So. you do have a crush
on Jennifer Bradley.

62
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:38,874
Nah. not really.
l barely even know her.

63
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:44,748
Have you ever tried talking to her?

64
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:47,685
How're you supposed to talk to girls?

65
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,585
lt's impossible.

66
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:54,252
well. you just have to try
to strike up a conversation.

67
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:58,093
Hi! How you doin'?
That's a nice bike.

68
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:01,224
lf you're gonna learn to swim.
you just gotta jump in the water.

69
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:05,362
- l guess.
- David? Don't forget to feed Bruiser.

70
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,804
l won't.

71
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,865
Come on. Bruiser.

72
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,943
Good boy. That'll make you big and strong
so you can win that championship.

73
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:20,975
David? David.
Oh. would you go meet Jeff?

74
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:23,420
The Johnsons said he left
about five minutes ago.

75
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,549
- He's eight years old. Mom.
- l know.

76
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,957
But l don't like him going
through the woods alone.

77
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:30,086
l think he can make it
a half-mile on his own.

78
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:32,996
Now. you hurry up.
And we're gonna get some burgers

79
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:35,626
and we're gonna set off
those fireworks of yours.

80
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:38,068
- OK?
- OK.

81
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,534
Come on. Bruiser.

82
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:52,542
(train whistle.)

83
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:57,848
(Bruiser whimpering.)

84
00:07:57,924 --> 00:08:01,519
what is it. macho man?
Not afraid of a little wind. are you?

85
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:03,619
(continues whimpering.)

86
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,665
See. Bruiser?

87
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:12,330
what you gotta do is be a take-charge guy.

88
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:14,896
That's what girls like.

89
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,086
Come on. boy.

90
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:31,817
Come on.

91
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:35,717
wanna know my real problem?

92
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:40,122
l don't know what l want out of life
anymore.

93
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,128
As a young dog. you might find that
hard to understand. but...

94
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:45,671
(twig breaks.)

95
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:48,641
Jeff?

96
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,975
Jeff?

97
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:13,621
(rustling.)

98
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:18,393
(barks.)

99
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:24,572
Get back. Jack! l've got a gun!

100
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:45,354
(twig breaks.)

101
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:51,195
(screams.)

102
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:54,502
- Oh!
- Gotcha! Gotcha!

103
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,474
- l'll kill you!
- (Bruiser barks.)

104
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,567
(train whistle.)

105
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,671
Bruiser?

106
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:12,114
what is it. Bruiser?

107
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:15,117
(barking.)

108
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,197
Come on. boy.
we'd better get home.

109
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:25,804
Agh!

110
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,237
(train whistle.)

111
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:34,406
(groans.)

112
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:52,056
Bruiser! Here. Bruiser.

113
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:11,606
Bruiser? Here. Bruiser.

114
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,285
Open up. you little punk!
Do you hear me?

115
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:20,152
l said open up!

116
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:26,591
- who are you?
- who are you?

117
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,658
Uh. l'm David. l live here.

118
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,103
Think you have the wrong house. dear.

119
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:38,470
- where's my mom?
- l have no idea.

120
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:40,637
Oh. are you lost?

121
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:45,173
Hey! where do you think you're going?

122
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:48,345
Now. just a minute.
You've made a mistake!

123
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:50,412
Mom? Dad?

124
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,255
Oh!

125
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:57,922
Mom!

126
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:00,226
Larry!

127
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:05,059
(" easy listening.)

128
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:09,871
what's the problem. son?

129
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:15,244
Now. calm down. son!

130
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:20,145
Now. nobody is going to hurt you.

131
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:23,415
what's your name?
where do you live?

132
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:29,160
Please...

133
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:32,197
where's my mom and dad?

134
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,898
Janet. call the police.

135
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,871
And because of that.
everything's chaos here.

136
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:42,407
You're gonna have to process this.

137
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:57,547
(man over TV) Authorities
are investigating what has caused

138
00:12:57,623 --> 00:12:59,818
power blackouts in sections of two
counties.

139
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:03,760
Emergency generators are in operation
at Lauderdale General Hospital.

140
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,388
Not hungry. huh?

141
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:07,695
The electricity should be reinstated...

142
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,428
ls my dad coming yet?

143
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:14,235
Phil? we ran his name.
and the computer came up with this.

144
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:16,275
Oh. good. A missing person report.

145
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:20,608
''David Scott Freeman.
Hair: brown. Eyes: brown.''

146
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,342

148
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:33,692
- Have we located the parents?
- Yes. but Phil. look at the date.

149
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,023
what about it?
Must be a typo.

150
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:38,893
l ran it through the computer
three times. That's no mistake.

151
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:42,526
- He was declared legally dead.
- who's dead?

152
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:47,069
No one's dead. David. Come on.
Let's start putting this puzzle together.

153
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,308
Now. David. just a few more questions
for our paperwork. OK?

154
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:59,215
- How old are you?
- l already told you. Twelve.

155
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:01,810
All right. And what is the date today?

156
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:04,448
lt's the fourth of July.

157
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:07,982
- what year?
- 1 97 8.

158
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,435
Uh. David. who's the President
of the United States?

159
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:20,302
Duh. You wanna know that
for your paperwork?

160
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,773
Mm-hm.

161
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:24,707

162
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:27,143

163
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,252
- why are we stopping?
- You'll see.

164
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:48,056
Be right back.

165
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:56,372
- (David) who lives here?
- we're not sure yet.

166
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:05,373
(dog barking.)

167
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:09,384
(man.) Quiet! Calm down.

168
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:14,214
Look. l'm sorry to disturb you folks.

Yes.

172
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:24,829
- Dad!

173
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:27,429
David. wait a second!

174
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:31,533
well. l'm Detective Banks.
Juvenile Division. lt seems that we...

175
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:34,211
David...

176
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:42,553
Oh. my God!

177
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:45,284
(laughing.)

178
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:47,622
- Oh!
- Thank God!

179
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:10,748
- Dr. Faraday.
- Any signs of life?

180
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:14,650
Not outside. But we haven't been
able to determine what's inside.

181
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,781
well. something must have flown it.
This could be our first contact.

182
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,416
She's beautiful.

183
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:24,259
Sir. this is the night watchman
who found it. Ellis Brayton.

184
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,560
Says he hasn't told anyone
except the local authorities.

185
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:28,964
so what we have here is a controlled
situation.

186
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:31,731
watch your step. Mr. Brayton.

187
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,101
- Hi.
- Hi.

188
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:37,632
- l'm Lewis Faraday. NASA.
- Sure is a pretty piece of spacelab.

189
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:41,040
lt was flying along. then it
just smacked right into the tower

190
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:46,915
and dragged it about 1 00 yards.
Then it stopped and it's floating here.

191
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,156
Say. l don't suppose you gentlemen
could tell me how you do that?

192
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:56,251
No. Mr. Brayton.
it's a matter of national security.

193
00:16:57,563 --> 00:17:01,795
- Any idea how we're gonna move it?
- Are you kidding? watch this.

194
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,267
- Uh. no...
- (ferocious barking.)

195
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,800
(distorted voices.)

196
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:18,782
who are you? what's happening?

197
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:20,944
- Just rest. David.
- l don't wanna rest!

198
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,421
- where's my mom and dad?
- we're right here. sweetheart.

199
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,981
what's happening. Mom? l'm scared!

200
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:30,927
Don't be scared. honey.
we won't let anybody hurt you.

201
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:35,428
what happened to you. Mom?

202
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,833
You too. Dad?

203
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:40,838
why were those people in our house?
why?

204
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:44,034
David. we don't know
all the answers to all this yet.

205
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,307
but the main thing is you're alive.

206
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,644
David. where have you been all this time?

207
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:57,552
All this time?

208
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:00,922
l just went to get Jeff
at the Johnsons' a few hours ago.

209
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:03,393
Get Jeff. He'll tell you!

210
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:05,453
David?

211
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,862
who's that?

212
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:16,439
That's your brother. Jeffrey.

213
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:17,976
what?

214
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:20,705
Mr. and Mrs. Freeman?

215
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,044
Could l see you outside
for a few minutes. please?

216
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:25,106
(Mr. Freeman.) Sure.

217
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,651
Honey?

218
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,586
we'll be right back.

219
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,966
You look just like l remember you.

220
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:55,604
This is totally rad.
l mean. you're my big little brother.

221
00:18:57,683 --> 00:19:00,311
You're not my brother.

222
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:04,789
Listen... l'm sorry for scaring you like that.

223
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:06,882
jumping out of the tree.

224
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:10,251
l felt rotten about it.

225
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,422
Anybody could know that.

226
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:15,695
Hey. you think it's easy for me
to believe that you're David?

227
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:19,067
l mean. you should be.
like. 20 years old now.

228
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:28,441
l'm not really sure why l kept this.

229
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:32,883
l guess l thought
maybe l'd be able to use it.

230
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:35,113
You know. kind of save the day.

231
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:41,588
Mom and Dad went nuts
when we couldn't find you.

232
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,530
They made me put those things up
on every telephone pole and tree for years.

233
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,591
Every Saturday.

234
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:56,633
You should've seen Mom.
She kept all the stuff in your room.

235
00:19:57,943 --> 00:20:00,741
She refused to believe that you were dead.

236
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:09,387
lt's 1 986. man.
Eight years since that night.

237
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,556
You little weasel.

238
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:20,629
Dork.

239
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:23,259
Butt-face.

240
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:25,735
- Scuzz-bucket...
- Bucket.

241
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:31,199
Jeff... l'm scared.

242
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,877
we'll figure something out.

243
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:41,282
- Dad. l wanna go home.
- Yeah. l know. l know. David. we want you

244
00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:43,844
to come home too but the doctor wants you
to stay in the hospital a couple of days.

245
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:46,653
No. Dad! Please don't make me stay.

246
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,955
we have to find out where you've been.

247
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:52,020
He wants to run a couple of tests
to help you remember.

248
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:55,692
and we thought that was important.
Davey. so we said OK.

249
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,963
Mom!

250
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:02,303
Oh. honey. one of us
will be with you around the clock.

251
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:07,444
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you.
l promise.

252
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:12,380
Now. um. you two guys.
you go get some sleep.

253
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:15,443
l'll stay with our guy tonight.

254
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:28,526
OK. right.
well. we'll see you in a couple of hours.

255
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:30,592
Bye.

256
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:32,762
Be cool. dude.

257
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:40,077
Mom... have l really
been gone eight years?

258
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:42,444
Yeah.

259
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:45,781
lt's like a bad dream.

260
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:49,139
(distorted voices.)

261
00:22:55,921 --> 00:23:00,984
Thyroid hormones suggest that a great
many factors could influence one of...

262
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,154
He's hurt! He's calling me.

263
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:07,632
what is it?

264
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:13,532
- Nothing. Forget it.
- No! what?

265
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,068
well. this voice keeps calling.

266
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:22,511
saying something over and over and over.

267
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:25,015
But l can't understand very much.

268
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:28,546
well. what is it saying?

269
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,611
Something...

270
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:36,518
l can't explain it.

271
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:43,023
l knew you wouldn't believe me.

272
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:45,434
No. l believe you.

273
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:53,676
You don't think l'm going crazy. do you?

274
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:58,342
Are you kidding?
They've run a million tests on you.

275
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:03,320
ln fact. you're probably
the only sane person in this place.

276
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:07,051
Don't worry about it.
lt was just a bad dream.

277
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:11,128
Thanks.

278
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:40,622
- Have you tried everything?
- Everything. lt's completely impregnable.

279
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:43,525
we must get inside.

280
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:49,534
For all we know. something may be
living. or perhaps even dying inside this.

281
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:53,401
lt appears to be seamless -
no way in. no way out.

282
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:09,317
- David. what time did you enter the
woods? - Around 8:00.

283
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:12,152
Then you met your brother?

284
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:15,421
Yeah. The jerk jumped out
of a tree and scared me.

285
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:17,792
He's lucky he's still alive.

286
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,498
Then what happened?

287
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:24,593
well... l chased him for a while.

288
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,631
Then l reached this cliff.

289
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:35,646
Jesus! He's transmitting in alpha waves
with complex frequency patterns in them.

290
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:37,807
- what's going on?
- l don't know.

291
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:40,977
l know l fell.

292
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:44,045
The alpha waves are coming in
at 1 2.7 8 cycles per second.

293
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:47,819
He's communicating directly
with the computer in binary code.

294
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:51,852
- How the hell is he doing that?
- l have no idea.

295
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:56,162
But then after you fell.
you went somewhere.

296
00:25:56,235 --> 00:25:58,226
How did you get there?

297
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,399
(Mrs. Freeman.) what is that?

298
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:07,536
- ls that coming from David?
- l believe it is.

299
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,579
(Mr. Freeman.) well. what is it?

300
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:16,985
How did l get out of the ravine?

301
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,356
l crawled out.

302
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:43,505
(man.) Let's get the gas jets now.
CO2 sensors with the breakers...

303
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:47,313
Dr. Faraday. l think you
should take a look at this.

304
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:53,717
- where did this come from?
- From the mind of 1 2-year-old boy.

305
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:03,860
David. what do you think?

306
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:06,268
No way! l'm not going.

307
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:11,303
l don't think you understand
the importance of this situation.

308
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:16,040
l don't care if it's a matter of national
security. lf David says no. then that's it.

309
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:20,778
But David would get treatment
from the best specialists in the country.

310
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:25,255
not to mention technical capabilities
this hospital is not prepared to offer.

311
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:27,053
- Am l correct. Doctor?
- lt's true.

312
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,649
we've done just about
everything we can for him...

313
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:32,925
Excuse me. l know that all sounds great.
but the fact is David has to go on living.

314
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:35,398
and he can't do that in an institution.

315
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:38,459
So until you can tell me something
that makes one ounce of sense.

316
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:41,335
then we're all going home.
and that's all there is to it.

317
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:42,930
- Right on. Dad.
- Yeah.

318
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:47,440
well. l'm sorry you don't
wanna know the truth.

319
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:49,645
what?

320
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:52,878
The truth about where David's been
for the last eight years.

321
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:58,446
why he can't remember. what all
this unusual brain activity means.

322
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:03,153
And most of all... why he hasn't aged.

323
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:13,497
David. l can offer you the truth.

324
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:15,904
All l need is 48 hours.

325
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:22,072
Just two days at the base
with me and my staff. alone.

326
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:25,378
No confusion. no distraction.

327
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,513
And then. David. you can go home
and put all this behind you.

328
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,256
That's what you want. isn't it?

329
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:43,667
Yes.

330
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:02,243
(distorted voices.)

331
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:05,889
- who said that?
- who said what?

332
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,783
Never mind.

333
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:15,099
(distorted voices.)

334
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:29,908
well. David. this will be your room for a
while. what do you think?

335
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:35,853
- ls this stuff for me?
- Yes. it is.

336
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:39,322
There's no phone in here. l thought l was
supposed to be able to call my parents.

337
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:42,758
we'll make that call together
first thing tomorrow from my office. OK?

338
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:47,993
Now. look. if you wanna watch TV.
this is a remote-control wand.

339
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:50,557
And we'll get you something
to eat right away. OK?

340
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:53,570
Now. here's a special gift just for you.

341
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:57,534
Tomorrow's gonna be very exciting.

342
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:01,943
So you enjoy yourself
and we'll see you in the morning.

343
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:07,708
Hey!

344
00:30:07,786 --> 00:30:11,722
(man on TV) ...Americans out there
who need and want to lose weight.

345
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,226
Let's constrain ourselves.
Let's get back to the basic subject.

346
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:18,524
what can your diet do for Americans?

347
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:21,259
(" ''Lose Your Love'' by Blancmange.)

348
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:27,634
Pardon me. Coming through.

349
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:32,233
Get away!

350
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:37,710
Hi. l'm Carolyn McAdams.

351
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:40,512
You gotta be real hungry
after your trip. right?

352
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:43,611
- what is this thing?
- That's RALF.

353
00:30:43,688 --> 00:30:45,781
- RALF?
- Mm-hm.

354
00:30:46,424 --> 00:30:49,825
Robotic Assistant Labor Facilitator.

355
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:53,290
Actually what he does here
is he delivers mail and supplies.

356
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:57,131
and he messes up a little bit
every now and then.

357
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:02,935
So... who did you murder
to get put here in maximum security?

358
00:31:03,008 --> 00:31:06,068
No one. l'm a national security secret.

359
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:11,241
Oh. well. in that case.
l shouldn't be talking to you at all.

360
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:16,344
wait a sec! Um. how come
Starsky and Hutch isn't on?

361
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:18,981
That show was canceled
a long time ago.

362
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:22,618
That was my favorite show!
And what's this stuff?

363
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:29,330
You've never seen a music video before?

364
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:33,098
Uh-uh. l've been gone for eight years.

365
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:35,332
Gone where? Outer space?

366
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:42,475
- Could be.
- You know something? You're a weird kid.

367
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:46,415
Me? l'm not the one with the purple hair.

368
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:54,750
Oh. yeah. l went to a concert
with some friends last night.

369
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:58,387
Really? My mom took me to see
the Bee Gees a couple months ago.

370
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:01,489
- who'd you see?
- Twisted Sister.

371
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:04,592
- Never heard of her.
- lt's a him.

372
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:08,900
- Oh.
- Actually. it's a them.

373
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:15,442
You're serious about being away.
aren't you?

374
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:18,943
what was it?
Like a coma or something?

375
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:21,518
l can't remember.

376
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,289
All right. listen. Um. l gotta go.

377
00:32:26,057 --> 00:32:28,855
Um. is there anything else you want
when l come back?

378
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:31,521
How about a Big Mac.
large fries and a Coke?

379
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:34,690
- They're still around. l hope.
- well. now. that all depends. Do you want

380
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:38,497
New Coke. Classic Coke. Cherry Coke.
Diet Coke or caffeine-free Coke?

381
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,471
- Huh?
- Nothing. Forget it.

382
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:45,036
lf they're still around.
then l'll do my best. all right?

383
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,771
- OK. Bye.
- See ya.

384
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:51,009
well. come on. RALF.
Come on. Ralfie baby.

385
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:53,448
You'll make it. Come on.

386
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,429
All right! way to go.

387
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:15,902
Jeff! David's on the phone!

388
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:20,611
They gave me a NASA cap. and
there are robots here they call RALF.

389
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:23,739
And there's a nice lady
that brings me my food.

390
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:27,911
Oh. and another thing.
They locked me in my room.

391
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:31,888
Uh. the locks are there
for David's protection.

392
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:33,389
Don't take any shit. David.

393
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:37,724
Now. don't forget your promise. Doctor.
David has to be back in 48 hours.

394
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:40,321
Don't worry. Mrs. Freeman.

395
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:42,491
Hi. David. it's Dad again.

396
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,494
Hi. Dad.

397
00:33:46,571 --> 00:33:52,009
we're just here fixing up your room.
waiting for you for when you get back.

398
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:53,601
And we'll see you soon.

399
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:57,079
That's great. Thanks.

400
00:33:57,148 --> 00:33:58,843
we sure do miss you. son.

401
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:01,750
l miss you. too. Dad.

402
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,278
l miss all you guys... a whole lot.

403
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:06,688
Bye.

404
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:08,191
Bye. Bye-bye.

405
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:10,250
Bye. David.

406
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:30,576
OK. now. David. if you can.

407
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:35,210
l'd like you to try and remember what
happened when you fell in the ravine.

408
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:42,687
well. l tried to stop myself. but the...

409
00:34:45,864 --> 00:34:49,061
OK. everybody. remain calm.
Try to bring it back up to speed.

410
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:52,501
- what's going on?
- lt's all right. David. Everything's fine.

411
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:57,040
- we're ready. sir.
- OK.

412
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:59,440
Bring the computers up
to synchronization slowly.

413
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:02,844
Let's see if we can latch the data
at a higher rate.

414
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:08,676
well. what is your name?

415
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:11,552
(woman.) we're in synch.

416
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:15,525
wait a sec! How'd that happen?
l didn't say a thing!

417
00:35:15,593 --> 00:35:17,026
Next question.

418
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:20,587
David. where have you been
for the last eight years?

419
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:23,429
l've already told you. l don't know.

420
00:35:30,341 --> 00:35:33,970
what powered the craft
that you were traveling in?

421
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:49,116
Oh. my God. This kid's head is full.

422
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:51,754
what language is that?

423
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,061
- Oh. who knows what's in this boy's head?
- what are you talking about?

424
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:59,297
- we can spend years trying to decipher it.
- who's putting that stuff on the screen?

425
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,730
You are. David.

426
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:05,002
But that's impossible.

427
00:36:06,911 --> 00:36:12,315
- How far is it from Earth to Phaelon?
- l've never heard of the place.

428
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:16,486
How long did it take you to get there?

429
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:21,921
- Light-speed theory.
- That's the only possible explanation.

430
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:24,257
well. what's that?

431
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:29,590
David. if you were traveling
beyond the speed of light.

432
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:32,898
then you could've been
gone only 4.4 hours.

433
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:37,169
and the rest of us here on Earth
would've aged eight years.

434
00:36:37,242 --> 00:36:38,766
well. what does that mean?

435
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:41,676
Time slows down
as you approach the speed of light.

436
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:47,241
- Speed of light?
- David... where is Phaelon?

437
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:50,287
How am l supposed to know?

438
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:55,993
He's searching through star charts!

439
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:10,099
- (woman.) Sir. l think he's downloading.
- (David) wait...

440
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:13,166
(man.) My God.
These are uncharted systems.

441
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:16,407
(woman.) Our computers
don't contain this information.

442
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:34,723
- David. is this Phaelon?
- l don't know!

443
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:39,595
Let me out of here!

444
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:41,764
David! David!

445
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:47,777
48 hours is not gonna be enough time.

446
00:37:57,922 --> 00:38:00,720
(RALF) Pardon me. Coming through.

447
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:02,950
Hi. there.

448
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:06,756
Hi. Carolyn.

449
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:10,457
So. how's the testing going?

450
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:15,201
Terrible. But at least
l get to go home tomorrow.

451
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:17,764
They told you that
you're going home tomorrow?

452
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,935
That's right. why?

453
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:25,282
- Nothing.
- Carolyn...

454
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:30,312
lt's just l've seen the meal sheet for the
coming week and they've got you on it.

455
00:38:30,388 --> 00:38:33,255
- Until when?
- All week.

456
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:35,451
But that's impossible!

457
00:38:35,526 --> 00:38:39,121
They promised it would
only be 48 hours!

458
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:43,429
You guys hear me in there?
l want out of here right now!

459
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:46,664
You think l don't watch television?
wake up!

460
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:50,469
Hey. Now. come on.
it's not as bad as it seems.

461
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:53,772
How would you know? You've never
been locked away from your family

462
00:38:53,845 --> 00:38:56,040
and been put in some awful place you
hate!

463
00:38:56,114 --> 00:39:01,780
Yes. every time my father got new orders.
l had to go and l had to start all over again.

464
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:07,314
Maybe you're right.

465
00:39:07,392 --> 00:39:10,088
(whispering.) Carolyn.
l've got to get outta here.

466
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:12,755
- David...
- Contact my parents.

467
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,027
Tell them what's going on.
They're in lnformation.

468
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,627
- Hey. what's he doing?
- Go see them for me.

469
00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:21,632
Please.

470
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:28,435
well. l gotta get back to work. OK?

471
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:36,919
You know...

472
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:39,853
you're cute.

473
00:39:42,226 --> 00:39:44,524
Did a girl ever tell you that before?

474
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:49,197
Nobody but my mom.
But l don't think she counts.

475
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:03,471
(distorted voices.)

476
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,447
(whispering.) Yes.

477
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:13,513
l'm here.

478
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,720
(distorted) Help me.

479
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:20,658
Help you? How?

480
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:24,860
(distorted) Are you coming?

481
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:28,031
Yes. l'm coming.

482
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:29,698
(door opens.)

483
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:33,106
Pardon me. Coming through.

484
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:36,635
(distorted voice.) Get in the RALF unit.

485
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:09,244
(chuckles.) Full house. Got you again.

486
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:12,639
l can't believe this.

487
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:35,103
(barking.)

488
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:38,142
Hey. come on.
we'll get you your own breakfast.

489
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:40,200
(sighs.)

490
00:46:21,592 --> 00:46:23,025
Agh!

491
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:28,356
(male voice speaking many languages.)

492
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:38,436
- who's that?
- Sit down. Navigator.

493
00:46:38,509 --> 00:46:42,639
- Are you the one that's been calling me?
- Affirmative.

494
00:46:42,713 --> 00:46:47,707
You have the information l require
to complete my mission.

495
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,880
Sit down!

496
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:53,947
l think there's been
some sort of mistake.

497
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:57,892
l do not make mistakes.
Awaiting final vectors.

498
00:46:57,962 --> 00:47:02,365
Vectors? l don't have any vectors.
l'm just a kid.

499
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:04,424
That is obvious.

500
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:08,598
But your brain has been programmed
with all appropriate star charts.

501
00:47:08,672 --> 00:47:12,130
You mean. that's why my brain has been
coming up with all that stuff?

502
00:47:12,209 --> 00:47:14,109
Yes.

503
00:47:14,178 --> 00:47:17,511
You are the Navigator!

504
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:28,421
Holy...

505
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:29,481
Campbell!

506
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:32,993
Oh. my God.

507
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:35,657
Seal all doors.
Activate penetration recording.

508
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:38,725
Activate all radiation surveillance
consoles one through 20.

509
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:41,965
Switch control monitors to automatic.

510
00:47:53,484 --> 00:47:56,544
Dr. Faraday. somebody
has penetrated security. sir.

511
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,383
- They're in the hangar now?
- Yes. sir...

512
00:47:58,455 --> 00:48:00,719
- when did this happen?
- we don't know yet. we're trying to get...

513
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:07,927
(sirens.)

514
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:21,201
- Can you tell what it is?
- No. l can't see a thing.

515
00:48:21,278 --> 00:48:23,576
- Do you have radiation?
- Negative. we show a cold room.

516
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:26,844
All right.
Get the goddamn door open. Now!

517
00:48:27,985 --> 00:48:31,978
we still have containment. l want security
doubled immediately. You got that?

518
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:35,219
Navigator. l detect alien life forms
approaching.

519
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:38,489
- Aliens? where?
- Observe.

520
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:46,159
Those aren't aliens.
They're human beings.

521
00:48:51,976 --> 00:48:55,412
Uh-oh. l'm gonna get it for this.

522
00:48:57,781 --> 00:49:01,444
- Holy shit. it's an alien.
- No. you idiot. lt's the kid.

523
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:03,748
- David?
- Oh. great.

524
00:49:10,427 --> 00:49:14,295
- They've got guns.
- Protective hover is advised.

525
00:49:14,365 --> 00:49:16,856
- will that shut the door?
- Affirmative.

526
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:20,836
OK. let's do that. But if anybody asks.
you're the one that did it. OK?

527
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:23,338
Compliance.

528
00:49:23,407 --> 00:49:26,274
Now. just get out of the ship. son.

529
00:49:56,674 --> 00:49:59,040
Request initial maneuvers.

530
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:02,078
l don't have any maneuvers.
l just wanna get out of here.

531
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:04,671
You wish to depart
hostile alien environment?

532
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:06,409
- Yes!
- Compliance.

533
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:17,513
wow! Did you do that?

534
00:51:17,588 --> 00:51:20,113
Elementary maneuver. l must complete
my mission and return to Phaelon.

535
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,852
But l don't wanna go to Phaelon.
l wanna go home.

536
00:51:22,926 --> 00:51:26,225
Navigator. l'm awaiting your command.
we must act now.

537
00:51:26,296 --> 00:51:29,288
Look. l gotta think.
Just take us 20 miles from here.

538
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:30,355
Compliance.

539
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,704
what are you doing?

540
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,535
Let's get over to tracking!

541
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:44,345
Stop!

542
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:48,073
(David) Agh!

543
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:49,949
Ohh!

544
00:51:50,988 --> 00:51:54,583
- You requested this distance.
- l didn't mean straight up.

545
00:51:54,658 --> 00:51:57,889
- l meant along the ground.
- Oh.

546
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:04,431
Sir. it just shot straight up
at over mach ten...

547
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:07,637
and stopped 20 miles up.

548
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:11,837
- Take me back!
- Compliance.

549
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:17,937
Oh. no!

550
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:20,744
(woman.) lt's heading back.

551
00:52:30,961 --> 00:52:31,950
There he is.

552
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:37,933
wow! How did you do that?

553
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:40,629
That was a third-class maneuver.
Navigator.

554
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:44,572
well. if that was a third-class maneuver.
what's a first-class?

555
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:45,767
Observe.

556
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:02,085
Uh-oh.

557
00:53:11,235 --> 00:53:15,467
This first-class maneuver lets me to slide
through your planet's thick atmosphere.

558
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:18,770
l can move at any speed.
l can speak thousands of languages.

559
00:53:18,842 --> 00:53:21,936
l can analyze species from civilizations
light years beyond yours.

560
00:53:22,012 --> 00:53:24,674
- Yeah. but can you fix this seat?
- Compliance.

561
00:53:25,382 --> 00:53:27,247
That's great.

562
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:31,219
- Now could you slow down a little?
- Compliance.

563
00:53:32,322 --> 00:53:33,550
Cool.

564
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:35,683
would you like me
to adjust the temperature?

565
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:37,249
No.

566
00:53:45,002 --> 00:53:47,300
(moos.)

567
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:50,169
we are precisely 20 miles from
point of origin. as you requested.

568
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,765
You are wasting time.
Give me the star charts now.

569
00:53:52,843 --> 00:53:54,504
Not now. l gotta go.

570
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:56,773
- Go? where?
- To the bathroom.

571
00:53:56,847 --> 00:54:00,305
- Do not know ''bathroom.''
- Then open the door.

572
00:54:00,384 --> 00:54:02,648
Request explanation.

573
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:07,022
Just do it or you'll be sorry.
l'll be right back. l promise.

574
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,149
Do not know ''promise.''

575
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:14,360
Damn! How did that kid get outside?

576
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:19,562
we had security everywhere.
Gotta get control of the situation.

577
00:54:19,636 --> 00:54:21,627
Sir. over here.

578
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,907
There they are.
About 20 miles west of here.

579
00:54:25,976 --> 00:54:27,944
Get some choppers out there immediately.

580
00:54:31,214 --> 00:54:33,205
(mooing.)

581
00:54:35,185 --> 00:54:37,619
what are you doing?

582
00:54:37,688 --> 00:54:41,818
- Can't l have a little privacy?
- Do not know ''privacy.''

583
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:44,190
(cow moos.)

584
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:47,230
(voice.) Moo!

585
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:51,033
what are you doing here anyway?

586
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:53,899
l have been sent from Phaelon
to borrow samples of life

587
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:55,996
from different galaxies for study.

588
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:58,564
On this planet. l chose you.

589
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,368
- why me?
- why not?

590
00:55:05,082 --> 00:55:08,813
Back on Phaelon. we discovered
that your inferior species

591
00:55:08,885 --> 00:55:11,217
uses only ten percent of your brain.

592
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:13,916
So we filled it all the way up with star
charts to see what would happen.

593
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:16,926
- what happened?
- lt leaked.

594
00:55:16,994 --> 00:55:19,485
- Navigator...
- l am not a navigator!

595
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:21,453
Yes. you are.

596
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:25,058
l crashed into electrical towers
and my star charts were erased.

597
00:55:25,135 --> 00:55:28,195
l need the ones in your head
to complete my mission.

598
00:55:28,271 --> 00:55:32,867
So you need me and my inferior brain
to fly that thing?

599
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:38,677
Correction. l need the superior information
in your inferior brain to fly this thing.

600
00:55:40,183 --> 00:55:45,883
well. if l'm so inferior. how come
you took eight years to bring me back?

601
00:55:45,956 --> 00:55:48,151
Normally. l take my specimens
back in time

602
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:51,058
to the exact moment
and place l collected them.

603
00:55:51,128 --> 00:55:55,064
Come on!
You took me away from my family!

604
00:55:55,132 --> 00:55:58,158
And when you returned me.
it was eight years later!

605
00:55:58,235 --> 00:56:01,398
Everything's changed. except me!

606
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:03,996
Unfortunately. we discovered
it was too dangerous

607
00:56:04,074 --> 00:56:07,840
for your fragile human body
to travel back in time.

608
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:13,281
OK. if l can't go back in time.
at least take me back to my family.

609
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:14,612
(whirring.)

610
00:56:15,919 --> 00:56:17,443
Come aboard quickly. Navigator.

611
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:20,251
Not until you promise to take me home!

612
00:56:20,323 --> 00:56:23,520
we've spotted 'em.
The boy's outside the ship.

613
00:56:23,593 --> 00:56:26,084
(Faraday.) Can you keep them
on the ground?

614
00:56:26,163 --> 00:56:29,621
Very well. You give me the star chart
and l'll take you home.

615
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:33,161
Come on. Let's get outta here.

616
00:56:35,138 --> 00:56:39,199
- He's gone back into the ship.
- (Faraday.) Don't let them take off!

617
00:56:39,276 --> 00:56:41,972
- Request instructions.
- l don't know.

618
00:56:42,045 --> 00:56:46,311
- Just... just get us out of here!
- Compliance.

619
00:56:55,726 --> 00:56:58,194
My God. it changed shape.

620
00:57:01,231 --> 00:57:02,664
Can you follow it?

621
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:06,396
Follow it? l can't even see it.

622
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:14,804
- Hey. this is fun.
- Fun. Navigator?

623
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:17,904
- My name's David.
- David?

624
00:57:18,682 --> 00:57:20,809
Yeah. So what do l call you. anyway?

625
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:23,876
- l am a trimaxion drone ship from...
- Trimaxion?

626
00:57:23,954 --> 00:57:26,923
- Affirmative.
- OK. l'll call you Max. lt's easier.

627
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:30,084
- Max?
- Right.

628
00:57:42,105 --> 00:57:44,471
Just take me somewhere
where they can't find us.

629
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:47,101
Compliance.

630
00:57:50,514 --> 00:57:52,573
what are you doing?

631
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:54,139
Agh!

632
00:57:57,387 --> 00:57:59,446
l didn't say take us under the ocean.

633
00:57:59,523 --> 00:58:01,855
All l asked for was a place
they couldn't find us.

634
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:06,328
This was the first place
suggested by my data banks.

635
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:09,960
- will this thing leak?
- Navigator. l do not leak.

636
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:12,160
You leak. Remember?

637
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:14,058
Hm.

638
00:58:14,137 --> 00:58:18,471
l must program my circuitry
for the mind transfer.

639
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:25,004
- (creatures make noise.)
- wow! what are these?

640
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:28,881
Those are the other specimens
we studied on Phaelon.

641
00:58:28,952 --> 00:58:30,886
- where do they come from?
- Don't touch!

642
00:58:30,954 --> 00:58:33,616
That is a Garpuntle
from South Petrawlis.

643
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,056
Once he bites. he never lets go.

644
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:37,457
what's this?

645
00:58:37,527 --> 00:58:41,588
That is a Feenastarus
from the Pixar Elliptic.

646
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:45,828
weird. what are they doing here?

647
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:49,133
After l drop you off. l will travel back in time

648
00:58:49,206 --> 00:58:53,643
and take them to their homes.
just as if they never left.

649
00:58:56,746 --> 00:59:01,012
- what's that?
- A very unpleasant little creature.

650
00:59:01,084 --> 00:59:03,712
- what's his problem?
- He's got a cold.

651
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:06,846
Ew. gross.

652
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:14,396
Don't get too close. David.
They're hungry.

653
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:23,002
That could've been your head. David.

654
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:27,766
(belches.)

655
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:36,649
what's in here?

656
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,713
Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!

657
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:48,290
what's this one?

658
00:59:48,365 --> 00:59:50,993
That is a Puckmarin
from Binpuka Minor.

659
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:52,830
He's not dangerous.

660
01:00:02,712 --> 01:00:07,342
- Can l hold him?
- Just keep him quiet. l'm concentrating.

661
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:14,481
Hey. little Puckmarin.
how long have you been here?

662
01:00:16,893 --> 01:00:18,224
what's he saying?

663
01:00:18,295 --> 01:00:21,662
He is angry because l won't take him
back to his home planet.

664
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:25,098
He does not know
it was destroyed by a comet.

665
01:00:26,269 --> 01:00:29,102
That makes him an orphan.

666
01:00:32,175 --> 01:00:36,043
l wish l could take you home with me.
Jeff would really flip out.

667
01:00:36,112 --> 01:00:38,103
(laughing.)

668
01:00:40,483 --> 01:00:42,474
Listen. He's laughing.

669
01:00:42,552 --> 01:00:45,783
what is the purpose of laughing?

670
01:00:45,855 --> 01:00:48,790
The purpose?
l guess it makes you feel happy.

671
01:00:48,858 --> 01:00:50,826
You should try it.

672
01:00:50,894 --> 01:00:53,362
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha...

673
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:56,627
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

674
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,133
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha!

675
01:00:59,069 --> 01:01:02,402
- Nothing. No sign of them at all.
- That's wonderful.

676
01:01:02,472 --> 01:01:06,101
l just lost two of the most important
discoveries of the 20th century.

677
01:01:06,176 --> 01:01:11,375
- what else could possibly go wrong?
- Sir. it's the kid's father.

678
01:01:14,651 --> 01:01:15,640
Faraday.

679
01:01:15,719 --> 01:01:18,950
Dr. Faraday. how's David?

680
01:01:19,823 --> 01:01:24,556
well. uh. actually. Bill. it's been
kind of a rough day for all of us here.

681
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:26,527
Ah.

682
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:28,564
well. is he there now? Can l talk to him?

683
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:36,434
Uh. well. he just seemed to want to have
some time to himself. Know what l mean?

684
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:39,339
well. just tell him to call me
as soon as possible. will you do that?

685
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:44,040
Sure. l will be glad to have him
call you as soon as l see him. OK?

686
01:01:44,114 --> 01:01:46,275
OK. Bye-bye. Bill.

687
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:49,250
who was the last person to see David?

688
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:54,913
- Carolyn McAdams. An intern on the base.
- Get her. l wanna talk to her right away.

689
01:01:54,991 --> 01:01:59,360
- Her shift ended about an hour ago.
- Just find her!

690
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:02,830
Gotta keep a lid on this somehow.

691
01:02:06,436 --> 01:02:11,169
l am ready to perform the mind transfer.
Sit here. Navigator.

692
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:15,142
- will this hurt?
- You will feel nothing.

693
01:02:15,211 --> 01:02:18,408
- will l remember everything?
- You will retain all data.

694
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:21,279
How many times
have you done this thing?

695
01:02:21,351 --> 01:02:24,149
- Zero.
- Zero? You mean never?

696
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:27,883
l'm not gonna let you try this out on me.
what if you fry my brain?

697
01:02:27,957 --> 01:02:30,323
- l will not fry your brain.
- How do you know?

698
01:02:30,393 --> 01:02:33,055
l have been programmed
with superior intelligence.

699
01:02:33,129 --> 01:02:35,723
- Lie down.
- OK.

700
01:02:49,312 --> 01:02:51,837
- That's it?
- That's it. Davey!

701
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:53,075
Davey?

702
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:56,744
lf you want to learn to swim. you gotta jump
in the water. Don't forget to feed Bruiser.

703
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,549
Two all-beef patties. special sauce. lettuce.

704
01:02:58,655 --> 01:03:00,748
cheese. pickles. onions
on a sesame-seed bun.

705
01:03:00,824 --> 01:03:03,588
whoa! Ha-ha! This can't be happening.

706
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:07,152
l think l've gotten stuff out of you that has
nothing to do with navigating this ship.

707
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,095
You sound just like a human.

708
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:12,100
No! That dumb dog will
never learn to catch a Frisbee.

709
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:14,762
You are an inferior species.
you dumb dork!

710
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:17,432
- Butt-face!
- Scuzz-bucket. Ha-ha!

711
01:03:17,507 --> 01:03:20,533
Hey. well. if you're so perfect.
what are you still doing here?

712
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:25,172
l told you. l blew a fuse
when l totaled out that electrical tower.

713
01:03:25,248 --> 01:03:29,708
- l was checking out some daisies.
- You crashed while looking at flowers?

714
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:30,514
Ha!

715
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:36,719
- Sounds like you're the inferior species.
- l'll show you who's inferior. Heads up!

716
01:03:37,494 --> 01:03:42,454
- Hey. take it easy.
- well. ex-cuuuuse me!

717
01:03:42,532 --> 01:03:44,557
You OK?

718
01:03:49,806 --> 01:03:52,468
why are we going way up here.
you geek?

719
01:03:52,542 --> 01:03:53,907
Geek?

720
01:03:53,977 --> 01:03:57,777
l swear to God. if l was flying this thing.
we'd be home by now.

721
01:03:57,847 --> 01:03:59,974
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

722
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:01,607
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

723
01:04:01,684 --> 01:04:04,414
OK. turkey. you fly it!

724
01:04:04,487 --> 01:04:06,978
(David) OK. quit fooling around.

725
01:04:11,528 --> 01:04:14,258
Come on. this isn't funny!

726
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:15,957
Do something!

727
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:21,536
- l take it back. we're equal. OK?
- Equal? You called me a geek!

728
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:27,167
You're not a geek!

729
01:04:27,243 --> 01:04:30,371
Max. l want you to turn on
all engines now!

730
01:04:30,446 --> 01:04:32,641
That's an order from your navigator!

731
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:34,774
Oh. now you're a navigator.

732
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:36,819
So navigate already.

733
01:04:36,886 --> 01:04:38,877
lt looks like it's out of control and falling.

734
01:04:38,955 --> 01:04:41,150
- Somebody shoot 'em down?
- l have no idea.

735
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:43,920
Better do something. big shot.
You aren't even trying.

736
01:04:43,993 --> 01:04:46,484
Come on. one of these has to start it.

737
01:04:48,932 --> 01:04:52,663
(Scottish accent) Scotty to Bridge. she
can't take much more of this. Captain.

738
01:04:55,605 --> 01:04:57,869
20.000 feet and falling.

739
01:04:57,941 --> 01:05:00,432
You're getting warmer. Boiling.

740
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:02,671
Scalding! Red-hot!

741
01:05:02,745 --> 01:05:06,738
Uh-oh. Cooling down.
Arctic. Sub-zero. Freezing.

742
01:05:06,816 --> 01:05:08,374
(Puckmarin groans.)

743
01:05:08,451 --> 01:05:12,444
Oh. real coordinated. You'd better hurry.

744
01:05:12,522 --> 01:05:15,855
- Pull up.
- lmpact in less than 1 5 seconds.

745
01:05:15,925 --> 01:05:18,917
You hockey puck.
it's right under your nose.

746
01:05:27,937 --> 01:05:28,869
Yeah!

747
01:05:28,938 --> 01:05:31,304
(woman.) He's pulled up.

748
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:36,176
Now if l can only steer it.

749
01:05:36,246 --> 01:05:38,714
No way. José. Ha-ha!

750
01:05:47,423 --> 01:05:49,687
wow!

751
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:53,251
- Lucky guess.
- You! You nearly killed me.

752
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:57,698
You're the one who almost crashed.
l just shut down to teach you to fly.

753
01:05:57,767 --> 01:06:00,031
- You liar!
- Am not.

754
01:06:00,103 --> 01:06:02,765
You did it to get even
with me for what l said.

755
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:04,932
Did not!

756
01:06:05,008 --> 01:06:08,239
- You'll get yours!
- Oh. a threat.

757
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:13,609
Oh. l'm really scared.
Look. l'm shaking.

758
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:18,284
You know. it's not real hard
to fly this thing.

759
01:06:18,888 --> 01:06:19,877
Duh!

760
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:24,552
The slightest little move of my hand.
and we go that way.

761
01:06:25,428 --> 01:06:28,829
- OK. which way to Fort Lauderdale?
- l only know what's in your head.

762
01:06:28,898 --> 01:06:31,924
and you don't know the way
from your house to a 7-1 1 .

763
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:35,698
- (David) l say we go right.
- You don't know your left from your right.

764
01:06:35,772 --> 01:06:38,434
- we go left.
- OK.

765
01:06:39,976 --> 01:06:42,843
Dr. Faraday. we've located
the McAdams girl.

766
01:06:42,912 --> 01:06:45,278
She's inside the boy's house
with his parents.

767
01:06:45,348 --> 01:06:47,714
Keep them in that house!

768
01:06:47,784 --> 01:06:51,413
So right now he's up there somewhere.
flying around inside it.

769
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:56,018
- lnside a spaceship?
- Oh. my God.

770
01:06:56,092 --> 01:06:57,286
wow!

771
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,658
See. Faraday had the ship
inside a hangar at the base.

772
01:06:59,729 --> 01:07:03,495
and all l know is that
it took off with David inside it.

773
01:07:03,566 --> 01:07:05,466
Oh. Bill. what are we gonna do?

774
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:10,305
Faraday. that bastard! That ba...
He's gonna wish he never met us.

775
01:07:11,941 --> 01:07:15,138
Dad. there's some guys
coming toward the house.

776
01:07:15,211 --> 01:07:18,044
- Do you have a back door?
- Yes. it's back there.

777
01:07:19,782 --> 01:07:23,878
lt was nice meeting you all.
and l'll call you if l hear anything.

778
01:07:24,454 --> 01:07:26,615
- Hey. let go of me.
- Sorry. Miss McAdams.

779
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:28,953
l have to take you back to the base.

780
01:07:30,326 --> 01:07:32,191
- Mr. Freeman.
- Yes?

781
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:35,958
Dr. Faraday has requested
that you remain confined to your house.

782
01:07:47,243 --> 01:07:49,541
(David) lt's getting dark. That's not right.

783
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:51,671
(Max.) No. it's left!

784
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:55,707
See? There's Miami!

785
01:07:55,785 --> 01:07:59,186
- Come on. let's go lower.
- l told you so. l told you so.

786
01:08:02,492 --> 01:08:05,222
That isn't Miami. lt's Tokyo!

787
01:08:05,294 --> 01:08:07,524
- How did we get here?
- Oops.

788
01:08:07,597 --> 01:08:09,565
OK. take us back up.

789
01:08:09,632 --> 01:08:13,159
Yeah. l knew that.
l knew this was Tokyo.

790

(David) You are such a liar. l'm taking over.

791

visual contact over Tokyo. sir.

792
01:08:22,712 --> 01:08:25,772
- Tokyo?
- Sir. the target has left Japanese airspace.

793
01:08:25,848 --> 01:08:28,612
well. where is it going now?

794
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,981
(David) Now we'll get home.
First we'll hit California. then we'll go...

(Max.) Yeah. Mr. Know-it-all.

- How'd you know that?
- Ha-ha!

797
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:44,389
l've told you that l don't know anything.
l was just trying to be a friend to David.

798
01:08:44,467 --> 01:08:46,935
l really hope you're not hiding
any information.

799
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:50,461

Are we there yet?

the way to Fort Lauderdale. would you?

Try to make your directions clear
because we get lost easy.

01:12:26,188 --> 01:12:28,452
He's going home.

840
01:12:28,524 --> 01:12:31,288
l'll need a driver and security.

841
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,887
(David and Max sing ''Old McDonald'')

842
01:12:37,366 --> 01:12:40,824
Al's Gator City.
This must be Florida. Max!

843
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:44,134
(Max.) And that must be Big Al. Ha-ha!

844
01:12:44,206 --> 01:12:46,504
(David) Maybe he has a phone.

845
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:56,941
(bell rings.)

846
01:13:01,757 --> 01:13:05,853
Hi. um. can l please borrow
some change to phone my parents?

847
01:13:10,332 --> 01:13:11,321
Thank you.

848
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,368
Hey. Blimpo! Oink-oink!

849
01:13:13,436 --> 01:13:15,404
Too many Twinkies! Ha-ha!

850
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:36,289
Uh. excuse me. pal. would you mind
if my wife used the little girls' room?

851
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:46,635
- Dad. can we look at the flying saucer?
- Sure. go ahead.

852
01:13:48,738 --> 01:13:51,229
- Jackie. isn't it weird?
- Yeah.

853
01:13:52,274 --> 01:13:55,607
well. your lndian village won't win any
awards. but that flying saucer's first-rate.

854
01:13:55,678 --> 01:13:58,579
- (boy.) l wonder how it's staying up.
- (girl) l don't know.

855
01:13:58,647 --> 01:14:02,048
How long did it take to put
something like that together?

856
01:14:04,954 --> 01:14:08,253
lt's OK. we'll just take
a look around ourselves.

857
01:14:09,258 --> 01:14:12,625
Look at this. l can push on the step
and it doesn't move. lt just wiggles a little.

858
01:14:12,695 --> 01:14:16,256
Kids. get out from under there. Come on.
They don't have insurance in these places.

859
01:14:16,332 --> 01:14:19,597
- (Jeff) Hello?
- (operator) Call from David Freeman.

860
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:24,298
Yes! lt's David. we gotta talk fast.
There's NASA guys all over the place.

861
01:14:24,373 --> 01:14:27,774
Uh. Jeff. keep the line free.
David may call.

862
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:30,708
- where are you?
- Florida somewhere. l want to come home.

863
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:35,046
but l don't know where the new house is.
Can you please give me directions?

864
01:14:35,117 --> 01:14:37,711
Uh. do you know the drawbridge
on 7th Street?

865
01:14:37,787 --> 01:14:42,190
No. l don't. Just give me a signal
that l can see from the air.

866
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:46,058
Don't let the NASA guys know l'm coming.
And remember. it's gonna be dark soon.

867
01:14:46,128 --> 01:14:50,155
All right. if l have to set fire
to the house... you'll find it.

868
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,965
- Jeff...
- (dial tone.)

869
01:14:58,407 --> 01:15:01,672
(father) OK. that's nice.
Jackie. move just a little bit... Good.

870
01:15:01,744 --> 01:15:04,474
Ryan. give me some smiles.
Come on. we're having a good time.

871
01:15:04,547 --> 01:15:08,381
l wanna get the ship in here. This is a nice
shot. All right. honey. smile. Here we go.

872
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:10,281
Excuse me.

873
01:15:16,926 --> 01:15:19,451
See you later. alligator. Ha-ha!

874
01:15:23,499 --> 01:15:25,592
(children.) wow!

875
01:15:26,635 --> 01:15:28,500
Son of a gun!

876
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:31,734
He just said he wanted to phone home.

877
01:15:40,015 --> 01:15:42,540
(David) wow. look at this.

878
01:15:47,489 --> 01:15:49,650
Highway 95!

879
01:15:49,725 --> 01:15:52,660
OK. we'll take that straight
to Fort Lauderdale.

880
01:15:52,728 --> 01:15:55,356
95? l think we should take the turnpike.

881
01:15:55,431 --> 01:15:57,422
l'm the navigator.

882
01:15:59,068 --> 01:16:02,128
whoa! Take it easy. man.

883
01:16:07,643 --> 01:16:10,271
(mocking.) ''l'm the navigator!
l'm the navigator!''

884
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:16,080
well. Mr. Smarty-pants. l thought
Highway 95 would take us straight there.

885
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:18,176
There it is.

886
01:16:18,254 --> 01:16:21,883
Now all we have to do
is follow this and l'm home.

887
01:16:21,957 --> 01:16:24,255
(Max.) The turnpike would've been faster.

888
01:16:26,695 --> 01:16:29,186
(game-show host) Come on down!

889
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,698
Barbara Taylor!

890
01:16:33,769 --> 01:16:35,737
Come on down!

891
01:16:42,878 --> 01:16:46,075
(David) That's Miami Beach down there.
we're almost home!

892
01:16:46,782 --> 01:16:48,909
Ha-ha! All right!

893
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:50,451
where do you go next. Max?

894
01:16:50,519 --> 01:16:52,885
Back in time to when l picked up
my creatures.

895
01:16:52,955 --> 01:16:55,355
By now they're so hungry.
they could eat a zigzog.

896
01:16:55,424 --> 01:16:58,882
- what's a zigzog?
- Kind of like a hippo. but with feathers.

897
01:16:59,561 --> 01:17:02,155
lt's gotta be in here somewhere.

898
01:17:03,399 --> 01:17:05,959
Ah-ha. There we go.

899
01:17:29,124 --> 01:17:31,149
(sirens.)

900
01:17:33,228 --> 01:17:35,856
Sir. tracking says they're on their way
up the Florida coastline.

901
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:37,421
All right. step on it. OK?

902
01:17:37,499 --> 01:17:41,902
Faraday. Can you pinpoint the location
a little more precisely? lt's rather general.

903
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:48,309
- ls this Fort Lauderdale?
- Yes. but look at this.

904
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:51,038
How are we ever gonna find them?

905
01:17:51,947 --> 01:17:56,350
And now you're probably saying
''what do they have in store for me?''

906
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:06,289
(game-show host)
An exciting trip to Canada!

907
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,154
Damn.

908
01:18:16,038 --> 01:18:18,131
l don't believe this.

909
01:18:25,481 --> 01:18:30,180
(David) where are they?
Come on. Jeff. where's that signal?

910
01:18:39,795 --> 01:18:42,559
lt's them!
l knew you'd come through. Jeff.

911
01:18:43,665 --> 01:18:45,223
Ooh. pretty.

912
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:52,272
- Can you see him yet?
- Not yet.

913
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:55,037
- we made it!
- we made it!

914
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:58,238
Thanks for the great ride. Max.
lt was lots of fun.

915
01:18:58,313 --> 01:18:59,837
lt was fun for me. too. David.

916
01:18:59,915 --> 01:19:02,475
My friends are never gonna believe this.

917
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:07,079
Oh. yeah. my friends are all
20 years old. and l'm only 1 2.

918
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:12,092
l'd like to take you back to your
own time. but it's just too dangerous.

919
01:19:12,161 --> 01:19:15,062
At least now you'll be safe and sound
with your family.

920
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:17,064
(sirens.)

921
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:22,569
(Jeff) Look!

922
01:19:27,776 --> 01:19:31,303
Oh. no. what are
all those trucks doing here?

923
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:33,371
why can't they just leave me alone?

924
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:44,524
l know what you're thinking.

925
01:19:44,593 --> 01:19:47,926
You're afraid they're going
to take you away again. aren't you?

926
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:50,226
Yeah.

927
01:19:50,299 --> 01:19:52,392
l'm sorry l got you into this mess.

928
01:19:58,774 --> 01:20:02,210
(man.) Attention. all personnel.
keep your distance from the object.

929
01:20:02,277 --> 01:20:05,269
There may be radiation leakage.

930
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:21,492
- David!
- wait! wait a minute!

931
01:20:21,563 --> 01:20:25,966
Keep her back! He may be in danger.
Don't make any sudden moves!

932
01:20:26,034 --> 01:20:28,502
- Make a large circle around behind the
boy. - Roger.

933
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:33,473
- wait until he's clear before you move in.
- l think we can isolate him.

934
01:20:33,542 --> 01:20:36,136
David. come away from the ship.

935
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:40,312
- Come on!
- Come on. David. Please!

936
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:42,373
- Goodbye. Davey.
- (Jeff) Come on. David. hurry!

937
01:20:42,451 --> 01:20:44,316
Come away from the ship.

938
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:47,787
l'm sorry. l don't belong here now.

939
01:20:47,856 --> 01:20:49,653
l love you.

940
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:51,784
Take me with you. Max.

941
01:20:53,362 --> 01:20:57,128
You know l can't take you.
lt's much too dangerous.

942
01:20:58,367 --> 01:21:00,597
- David. please!
- David!

943
01:21:00,669 --> 01:21:02,102
David!

944
01:21:02,437 --> 01:21:04,871
You must stay with your family.

945
01:21:05,174 --> 01:21:08,610
That is my family. But it's not my home.

946
01:21:08,677 --> 01:21:11,168
My home is back in 1 97 8.

947
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:17,075
lf l stay. those scientists will treat me
like a guinea pig for the rest of my life.

948
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:20,952
lf you go back in time with me.
you could be vaporized.

949
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:28,229
- l have to take that chance.
- lt's very risky.

950
01:21:28,297 --> 01:21:30,322
- Are you sure. David?
- Yes.

951
01:21:31,099 --> 01:21:35,297
- Let's do it.
- All right. if that's your decision.

952
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:37,133
Max?

953
01:21:39,374 --> 01:21:41,934
will l ever see you again?

954
01:21:43,712 --> 01:21:46,476
l don't know.

955
01:21:46,548 --> 01:21:49,915
we must start the journey.
Hold on tight. Davey.

956
01:21:49,985 --> 01:21:52,749
l'm gonna miss you.

957
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:55,312
l'm gonna miss you. too.

958
01:21:56,391 --> 01:21:58,757
Thanks.

959
01:21:58,827 --> 01:22:01,728
No big deal. really.

960
01:22:04,132 --> 01:22:07,260
Come on. Let's get out of here.

961
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:11,070
Compliance...

962
01:22:11,139 --> 01:22:12,766
Navigator.

963
01:22:14,776 --> 01:22:16,767
Good luck.

964
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:09,920
(train passing.)

965
01:23:36,758 --> 01:23:38,749
(Mr. Freeman.) Hey. David!

966
01:23:39,961 --> 01:23:43,397
Come on. let's go!

967
01:23:43,465 --> 01:23:45,626
Come on!

968
01:23:54,976 --> 01:23:58,878
(Mr. Freeman laughs.)
Yeah. all right.

969
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:06,344
(Mrs. Freeman.) Now watch.
l'm writing your name. J-E-F-F.

970
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:09,948
(Mr. Freeman.) Pretty tricky. huh?
Don't get Bruiser! Oh. Bruiser!

971
01:24:10,025 --> 01:24:12,619
- There. wanna try that?
- No. he looks OK to me.

972
01:24:12,694 --> 01:24:15,026
(Mrs. Freeman.)
Honey. be careful of the dog.

973
01:24:15,097 --> 01:24:17,122
(Mr. Freeman.) Yeah. pretty tricky. l'll tell
you.

974
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,497
Hi there.

975
01:24:19,568 --> 01:24:23,800
Oh. where have you been.
young man? Come on.

976
01:24:30,045 --> 01:24:32,513
Mom. l love you.

977
01:24:35,283 --> 01:24:38,184
why. thank you. sweetheart.

978
01:24:38,253 --> 01:24:40,448
well. what brought that on?

979
01:24:42,257 --> 01:24:43,485
(Bruiser barks.)

980
01:24:47,529 --> 01:24:49,326
Bruiser.

981
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:01,537
- Are you mad at me?
- No. Jeff.

982
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:03,703
l love you. too.

983
01:25:08,717 --> 01:25:11,777
- (Mrs. Freeman.) OK.
- (Mr. Freeman.) which way we heading?

984
01:25:11,853 --> 01:25:15,755
- l made reservations at the Sea View.
- Uh. that's up the lntercoastal.

985
01:25:15,824 --> 01:25:20,056
No. it's not. Don't you remember?
lt's by the church.

986
01:25:20,128 --> 01:25:22,562
(Mr. Freeman.) well. we got everything?

987
01:25:23,765 --> 01:25:25,528
Come on. gang. let's go.

988
01:25:28,136 --> 01:25:29,433
Shh.

989
01:25:39,981 --> 01:25:42,313
(fireworks explode.)

990
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,511
(Max laughing.)

991
01:25:47,589 --> 01:25:49,853
(alien creatures laughing.)

992
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:54,424
(Max.) See you later. Navigator! Ha-ha!
