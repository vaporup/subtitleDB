1
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,160
In our relations with other people,

2
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,330
we mainly discuss and evaluate

3
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,080
their character and behavior.

4
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,630
That is why I have withdrawn

5
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,420
from nearly all so-called relations.

6
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,600
This has made my old age
rather lonely.

7
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:15,100
My life has been full of hard work,
and I am grateful.

8
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,940
It began as toil
for bread and butter

9
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,820
and ended in a love for science.

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,120
I have a son, also a doctor,
who lives in Lund.

11
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,250
He has been married for many years.
They have no children.

12
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,920
My old mother is still alive
and is very active, in spite of her age.

13
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,850
My wife Karin
has been dead for many years.

14
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,270
Dinner is served, Professor Borg.

15
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,900
Thank you.

16
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,190
I am lucky
in having a good housekeeper.

17
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,830
Perhaps I should add
that I am an old pedant,

18
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,160
which at times
has been rather trying

19
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,210
for myself and those around me.

20
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,550
My name is Isak Borg,

21
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,930
and I am 78.

22
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,470
Tomorrow I shall receive
an honorary degree in Lund Cathedral.

23
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,160
WILD STRAWBERRIES

24
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,180
In the early hours of June 1st,

25
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,400
I had a weird
and very unpleasant dream.

26
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,730
I dreamt that during
my morning walk

27
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,410
I lost my way among empty streets

28
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,990
with ruined houses.

29
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,470
Are you ill?

30
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,310
Miss Agda, please prepare
some breakfast. I'm taking the car.

31
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,640
Please, Professor! Go back to bed
and I'll bring you coffee at 9:00,

32
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,060
and we'll leave at 10:00 as planned.

33
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,480
Oh, well, I'll go without breakfast.

34
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,610
And who will pack your tails?

35
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,740
- I will do it myself.
- And what about me?

36
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,750
You can come in the car or fly.
Please yourself.

37
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,460
I've looked forward to seeing you get
your honorary degree.

38
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,470
And we had arranged
everything so nicely,

39
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,840
and now you're taking the car.

40
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,600
The ceremony isn't until 5:00.

41
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,230
If I leave at once, I've got 14 hours
before the ceremony.

42
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,810
You'll ruin everything!

43
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,520
What about your son who is expecting you
at the airport in Malmo?

44
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,610
You can think up an explanation.

45
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,660
If you go by car,
I won't come at all.

46
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,080
Now listen, Miss Agda!

47
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,210
Take the car, and you'll ruin
the greatest day of my life.

48
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,750
We're not married, Miss Agda.

49
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,430
I thank God for that every night.

50
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,970
I've used my common sense for 74 years,
and it won't let me down now.

51
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,600
Is that your last word?

52
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
Yes.

53
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:02,320
But I shall say plenty to myself
about selfish, crabby old men

54
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,990
who never think of those who have
served them faithfully for 40 years.

55
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,120
Incredible that I have put up...

56
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,080
with your bossing for so long.

57
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,630
Just give the word,
and I'll leave tomorrow.

58
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,170
I'm going by car anyway,
and you can do as you damn well please.

59
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:38,020
I happen to be grown-up
and needn't take orders from you.

60
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,570
No one can pack like you, Miss Agda.

61
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,450
Really?

62
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,990
Old sourpuss.

63
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,030
Shall I boil you a couple of eggs?

64
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,580
Yes, please, if you will be
so extremely kind.

65
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,920
The faculty should have made me
honorary idiot.

66
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,390
I'll calm the old girl down
with a present.

67
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,180
I hate resentful people.

68
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,900
I wouldn't hurt a fly,
let alone Miss Agda.

69
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,610
Toast?

70
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,900
No, don't trouble yourself
on my account.

71
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,900
What are you cross about?

72
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,330
Don't you want a cup?

73
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,040
Good morning, Uncle Isak.

74
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,840
Well, well, why is my daughter-in-law
up at this hour?

75
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,550
Who can sleep when you and Aunt Agda
are making such a row?

76
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,970
There has been no row.

77
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,770
No, not at all.

78
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,690
You're taking the car to Lund?

79
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,810
Yes.

80
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,650
Can I come with you?

81
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,270
You're going home?

82
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,240
Yes, I want to go home.

83
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,070
Home to Evald?

84
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,820
You don't need to ask why.

85
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,580
I would take the train
if I could afford it.

86
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,950
Of course you may ride with me.

87
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,580
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

88
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,790
Good heavens!

89
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,530
Please don't smoke.
I can't stand cigarette smoke.

90
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,040
I forgot.

91
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,410
There should be a law
forbidding women to smoke.

92
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,870
Beautiful weather.

93
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,800
Yes, but sultry.

94
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,050
- I think we'll have a thunderstorm.
- So do I.

95
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,760
No, give me a cigar anytime.

96
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,180
That's stimulating and relaxing.
That's a vice for men.

97
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,220
And what vices may a woman have?

98
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,480
Weeping, giving birth
and speaking ill of her neighbors.

99
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,350
How old are you really, Uncle Isak?

100
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,810
Why do you ask?

101
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,690
No reason. Why?

102
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,690
I know why you asked.

103
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,820
Oh, well.

104
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Don't pretend.
You don't like me. You never have.

105
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,710
I only know you
as a father-in-law.

106
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,790
Why are you going home?

107
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,790
On impulse. Nothing more.

108
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,170
Evald happens to be my son.

109
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,710
So he is.

110
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,260
Evald and I are very much alike.
We have our principles.

111
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,260
You don't need to tell me that.

112
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,760
Now, this loan, for instance.

113
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,720
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

114
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,520
He should have paid it back
when he became an associate professor.

115
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,190
It's a matter of honor for him
to pay back 5,000 a year,

116
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,600
and so on, and so on.

117
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,650
A promise is a promise.

118
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,610
For us, it means
that we never can be free together,

119
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,610
and that your son
works himself to death.

120
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,070
You have your own income.

121
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,030
Especially when one considers
the fact that you're filthy rich

122
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,490
and don't need the money.

123
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,210
A promise is a promise.
And I know Evald respects that.

124
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,670
Perhaps.
But he also hates you.

125
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,470
What do you have against me?

126
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,310
Shall I be frank?

127
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,730
Yes, I'm asking you.

128
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,610
You're a selfish old man, Uncle Isak.

129
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,150
You're utterly ruthless
and never listen to anyone but yourself.

130
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,240
But you hide it all behind
your old-world manners and charm.

131
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,750
Beneath your benevolent exterior,
you're as hard as nails.

132
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,040
But you can't fool us
who have seen you at close quarters.

133
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,590
Remember when
I came to you a month ago?

134
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,180
I had a stupid idea
that you might help Evald and me.

135
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,720
So I asked to stay with you
for a week or two.

136
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,310
Remember what you answered?

137
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,440
I said I'd be delighted.

138
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,150
Perhaps you've forgotten,
but you said,

139
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,280
"Don't try to draw me
into your marital squabbles.

140
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,120
I don't give a damn.

141
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,200
You and Evald must make
the best of it."

142
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,870
Did I say that?

143
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,250
- Not only that.
- Oh, no.

144
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,040
These were your very words:

145
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,290
"I have no respect
for mental suffering,

146
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,340
so don't come lamenting to me.

147
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,890
If you need therapy,
you'd better see a shrink.

148
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,560
Or why not a minister?
It's in fashion now."

149
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,390
Did I say that?

150
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Your judgments are very categorical,
Uncle Isak.

151
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,610
I should hate to depend on you.

152
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,950
I have liked having you
about the house.

153
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,740
Like a cat.

154
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,240
A cat or a human being.

155
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:32,580
You're a fine young woman,
and I'm sorry you dislike me.

156
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,340
- I don't dislike you.
- Really?

157
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,670
- I feel sorry for you.
- Sorry?

158
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,390
I'd like to tell you about a dream
I had this morning.

159
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,810
I'm not very interested in dreams.

160
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,770
No. No, of course not.

161
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,950
Where are you going now?

162
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,620
I want to show you something.

163
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:49,120
We lived here every summer
during the first 20 years of my life.

164
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,790
There were ten of us children.
Perhaps you knew that.

165
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,790
Does anyone live here now?

166
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,670
No, not this summer.

167
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,470
I'll go swimming, if you don't mind.
We have plenty of time.

168
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,090
Yes, by all means, do.

169
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,980
The place where
wild strawberries grow!

170
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,040
Perhaps I got a little sentimental.

171
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,050
Perhaps I got a little tired

172
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,710
and felt a bit sad.

173
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,680
It's not impossible that I began
to think of this and that,

174
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,430
associated with places
where I played as a child.

175
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,230
I don't know how it happened,

176
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,730
but the day's clear reality

177
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:08,030
dissolved into the even clearer
images of memory

178
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,620
that appeared before my eyes

179
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,580
with the strength
of a true stream of events.

180
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:31,890
Sara.

181
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,600
Sara,

182
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,690
it's your cousin Isak.

183
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,400
Well, I've become quite old,
of course, so I don't look the same.

184
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:53,240
But you, you haven't changed at all.

185
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,080
Good morning, sweet cousin.
What are you doing?

186
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,380
Picking strawberries, silly.
Can't you see?

187
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,960
And who shall be favored
with these delicious berries

188
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,840
picked in the early morn
by a lovely young woman?

189
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,350
Nonsense. You know quite well
that it's Uncle Aron's name day today.

190
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,810
I forgot to make a present.

191
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,560
So he'll get a basket
of wild strawberries instead.

192
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,810
I'll help you.

193
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,440
You see, Sigbritt and Charlotta made
a tapestry and Angelica baked a cake,

194
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,320
and Anna has painted
a really good picture,

195
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,450
and Kristina and Birgitta
wrote a song that they'll sing to him.

196
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,570
That's the best one.
Uncle Aron is stone-deaf.

197
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,490
He'll be very pleased,
and you're stupid.

198
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,040
And you have a darned cute nape.

199
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,040
You know you shouldn't do that.

200
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,630
- Says who?
- I say.

201
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,460
Besides, you're an unusually
insufferable young man

202
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,220
who thinks he's really something.

203
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,680
I'm your cousin,
and you're in love with me.

204
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,840
With you!

205
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,930
Come and be kissed on the lips.

206
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,230
If you don't behave, I'll tell Isak
you're always trying to kiss me.

207
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,860
Little Isak! I could beat him up
with one arm.

208
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,360
You know quite well that Isak and I
are secretly engaged.

209
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,160
So secretly, everyone knows it.

210
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,280
It's not my fault that the twins
let the cat out of the bag.

211
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,370
When is the wedding?
When is the wedding?

212
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,380
I don't know which of you four brothers
is the least conceited,

213
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,840
but I think it's Isak.

214
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,510
Isak is the nicest, anyway.

215
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,260
And you're the horridest, nastiest,

216
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,220
silliest, stupidest--
I can't find the words to describe you!

217
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,430
Admit you've got
a weak spot for me.

218
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,890
And you reek of cigars.

219
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,770
It's a nice manly smell.

220
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,820
And the twins,
who know most things,

221
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,740
say you've been up to no good
with that Berglund girl.

222
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:03,250
She's not a nice girl, the twins say.
And I agree.

223
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,710
How pretty you are
when you blush.

224
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:10,090
You must kiss me.
I can't bear it any longer.

225
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,550
Now that I think of it,
I'm madly in love with you.

226
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,840
- You're just saying that.
- No.

227
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,850
And the twins say

228
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,100
that you're mad about girls.

229
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,900
Is that true?

230
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,370
Oh, look what you've done!

231
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:44,750
And what will Isak say,
who really loves me?

232
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:50,420
I'm so sad!
You've hurt me so!

233
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,510
You've made
a bad woman of me.

234
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,630
At any rate, nearly.

235
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,300
I never want to see you again,
at least not before brunch.

236
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,270
I have to hurry.
Help me pick up the strawberries.

237
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,940
Oh, and now I've got
a stain on my apron!

238
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,890
Where's Isak?

239
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,390
Out fishing with Papa,
and they can't hear the gong.

240
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,480
Anyway, Papa said
not to wait with brunch.

241
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,570
In Jesus' name
we take our seat.

242
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,080
Bless, O Lord,
this food we eat. Amen.

243
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,050
Benjamin, go and wash
your hands at once.

244
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,090
How old do you have to be
to learn cleanliness?

245
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,720
I have.

246
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,270
Sigbritt, pass Angelica the porridge.

247
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,730
Your fingernails are filthy.

248
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,100
Hagbart, pass the bread.

249
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,240
Don't take so much butter.

250
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,360
Charlotta, the salt is lumpy.
You let it get damp.

251
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,570
How often have I told you
not to let it sit out?

252
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,950
It's paint under my nails.

253
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,830
Who gathered
the wild strawberries for me?

254
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,420
- I did.
- What?

255
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,630
Speak up, dear.
Uncle Aron can't hear.

256
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,550
I did!

257
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,260
Fancy your remembering
my name day.

258
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,640
How kind of you.

259
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:53,640
Couldn't Uncle have a drink
to celebrate?

260
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,440
Never when Papa is not at home.

261
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,530
Uncle has already had three drinks.

262
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,530
We saw him when we went out
to bathe at 8:00.

263
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,950
So you've picked berries too.
Thank you.

264
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,830
Twins, speak when spoken to.

265
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,910
And as you didn't make your beds,
you can dry the silver.

266
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,170
You will do as Auntie says.

267
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,960
Benjamin, don't bite your nails.

268
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,590
Anna, what are you doing?
Remember you're not a little girl anymore.

269
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,590
I want to give Uncle my picture.

270
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,470
Please, Auntie, can't we give him
our presents now?

271
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,350
- Where is your present?
- Under the table.

272
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,140
No, after we've eaten.

273
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,190
A very advanced work of art:
Fritjof and Ingeborg.

274
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:44,150
You can't tell which is Fritjof!.

275
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,530
What were Sara and Sigfrid doing
in the wild strawberry patch?

276
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,490
We saw you! We saw you!

277
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,250
The twins ought to be muzzled.

278
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,460
The twins will be quiet
or leave the table.

279
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,080
No freedom of speech, eh?

280
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,090
Shut up, you brats.

281
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,260
Sara's blushing! Sara's blushing!

282
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,340
Sigfrid is blushing too!
Sigfrid and Sara! Sigfrid and Sara!

283
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,300
Quiet, everybody!

284
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,270
But Sara!

285
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,350
They're lying! They're lying!

286
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:50,050
Isak is so fine and good,

287
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,430
so moral and sensitive.

288
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,690
He wants us to read poetry

289
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,520
and talk about the next life

290
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,190
and play four-handed piano.

291
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,280
And he only wants to kiss
in the dark,

292
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,200
and he talks about sin.

293
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,950
He's on such a terribly high level,

294
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,790
and I feel so worthless.

295
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,050
And I am worthless--
there's no denying it.

296
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,180
But sometimes it seems to me
that I'm a lot older than Isak,

297
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,560
if you know what I mean.

298
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,230
And then I think he's a child,
although we're the same age.

299
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:46,730
And Sigfrid is so bold and exciting,
and I want to go home.

300
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,990
I don't want to be here all summer

301
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,610
and be an object of ridicule
for the twins and all of you.

302
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,740
I don't want to!

303
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,080
I'll speak to Sigfrid.

304
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,660
If he doesn't behave,

305
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,160
I'll make sure he's made to study
during the summer holidays.

306
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,960
Papa will fix that
as easy as anything.

307
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,000
He too thinks Sigfrid is a
good-for-nothing and needs to work.

308
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,590
Poor little Isak
who's so good to me.

309
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,470
How unfair everything is.

310
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,260
All will be well, you'll see.

311
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,430
Listen, now they're singing
for Uncle Aron.

312
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:26,020
How silly to write a song
for a deaf old man.

313
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,770
How typical of the twins.

314
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,780
Flowers nod, grasses bow

315
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,330
Around our lovely house

316
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:44,000
We our Uncle Aron celebrate

317
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,080
And with our song

318
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,550
Ornament his brow

319
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,970
Four cheers for Uncle Aron.

320
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:59,180
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

321
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,770
I'll run down and meet
Isak and Uncle.

322
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,360
You do that.

323
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,820
I was overwhelmed by feelings
of emptiness and sadness,

324
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,910
but was soon awakened
from my reveries

325
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,420
by the voice of a young girl
asking me repeatedly about something.

326
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,380
Is this your house?

327
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,540
No, it's not.

328
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,010
You're lucky to be telling the truth.

329
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,920
It's my dad who owns the whole
headland, including the house.

330
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,930
I lived here once.
Two hundred years ago.

331
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,350
Oh, yeah?

332
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,980
- Is that your car up at the gate?
- Yes, that's my car.

333
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,230
Looks antique.

334
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,150
Yes, it's antique, like its owner.

335
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,280
So you have self-irony too.
That's fantastic.

336
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Where are you going?
I mean, in which direction?

337
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,360
Well, I'm going to Lund.

338
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,120
But that suits me perfectly.
You see, I'm on my way to Italy.

339
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,950
I'm honored.

340
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,370
My name's Sara.
Silly name, isn't it?

341
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,790
My name's Isak.
It's silly too.

342
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,170
Weren't they married?

343
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:16,130
No, unfortunately.
That was Abraham and Sara.

344
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,340
Let's leave, then.

345
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,300
I have another lady with me.
Here she comes.

346
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,270
- Marianne, this is Sara.
- Hello.

347
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,310
We're going to have company
as far as Lund.

348
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:30,400
Sara's off to Italy, but she's promised
to ride a ways with us.

349
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,650
Ironic again, but it suits you.

350
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,940
Let's be off.

351
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,990
Hey, guys, I've got a lift
almost to Italy.

352
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,040
That's Anders and that's Viktor
and this is Father Isak.

353
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,840
That peach you're gaping at
is Marianne.

354
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,140
What a big bus.

355
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,180
Yes, there's room for us all.

356
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,390
Put your luggage in the trunk,
if you don't mind.

357
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,740
I must tell you, Isak,
that Anders and I are going steady.

358
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,620
We're crazy about each other.

359
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,000
Viktor's the chaper one.
Daddy insisted.

360
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:38,300
Viktor is in love with me too.

361
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,260
It's a brilliant move of Daddy's.

362
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,850
I may have to seduce Viktor
to get rid of him.

363
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,390
I'd better tell you I'm a virgin.
That's why I'm so cheeky.

364
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,520
And I smoke a pipe.

365
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,690
Viktor says it's good for you.
He's crazy about anything healthy.

366
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,570
I was once in love
with a woman called Sara.

367
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,070
No! She was like me, wasn't she?

368
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,080
She was, actually.

369
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,700
What happened to her?

370
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:14,210
She married my brother Sigfrid
and had six children.

371
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,250
She's 75 now
and quite a beautiful old lady.

372
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,970
I can't think of anything worse
than growing old.

373
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,140
Oh, dear,
now I have put my foot in it.

374
00:35:09,955 --> 00:35:11,455
Are you all right?

375
00:35:11,535 --> 00:35:14,585
I have no excuse.
It's all our fault.

376
00:35:14,665 --> 00:35:20,625
My wife was driving.
Are you all right?

377
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:26,925
The murderers must introduce
themselves! My name's Alman.

378
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:30,475
That's my wife Berit.
You can see she has been an actress.

379
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,475
That's the complication
we were discussing when--

380
00:35:33,555 --> 00:35:35,725
Come here, Berit,
and say you're sorry.

381
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:39,485
I'm so sorry.
It was all my fault.

382
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:43,945
I was just going to hit my husband
when that curve appeared.

383
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:49,195
God punishes some people at once,
eh, you Catholic?

384
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:52,285
Let's get your car upright.

385
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:55,165
- Oh, never mind us. Please.
- Shut up, Sten.

386
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:59,755
Some people are unselfish,
though you don't think so.

387
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:06,595
My wife is a little nervous.
We've had a shock.

388
00:36:08,425 --> 00:36:13,265
Just look at him measuring
his strength with the youngsters,

389
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:19,145
straining his flabby muscles
to show off in front of that cute girl.

390
00:36:24,855 --> 00:36:28,195
Darling, you might have a stroke.

391
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:33,285
My wife likes ridiculing me.

392
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:36,285
I let her.
It's psychotherapy.

393
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:44,565
I never know whether my wife
is really crying or just play acting.

394
00:37:45,605 --> 00:37:47,565
I'll be damned if it isn't real.

395
00:37:50,405 --> 00:37:53,235
It happens when you catch
a glimpse of death.

396
00:37:53,325 --> 00:37:55,365
Can't you shut up?

397
00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:58,205
My wife can really live a part.

398
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:02,535
For two years,
she made me think she had cancer

399
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:06,215
and plagued us
with every possible symptom,

400
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:09,125
even though the doctors
could find nothing wrong with her.

401
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:15,015
Eventually we believed her
more than the doctors!

402
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:17,305
It's natural that you're upset,

403
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:19,845
but why not leave your wife
in peace for a while?

404
00:38:19,975 --> 00:38:22,305
A woman has a right
to her tears, eh?

405
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:25,565
Don't get in the way
of a woman's tears.

406
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:31,695
You are beautiful,
but old Berit's a bit past her prime.

407
00:38:31,815 --> 00:38:33,485
So you can afford to defend her.

408
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:37,075
I sympathize with her.
For several reasons.

409
00:38:37,155 --> 00:38:39,285
Very sarcastic!

410
00:38:39,415 --> 00:38:41,825
Yet you don't seem
in the least hysterical.

411
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:45,995
But little Berit is.

412
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:48,545
Do you know
what that means for me?

413
00:38:48,665 --> 00:38:50,465
I gather you're a Catholic.

414
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:53,005
Quite right.
That's how I stand it.

415
00:38:53,095 --> 00:38:55,425
We ridicule each other.

416
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:57,805
She has her hysteria.
I have my Catholicism.

417
00:38:57,885 --> 00:39:01,145
So, you see,
we need each other.

418
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:04,305
It's only egoism
that we haven't killed each other.

419
00:39:14,615 --> 00:39:16,655
There it came.

420
00:39:16,735 --> 00:39:19,995
That's what is called syncopes,
isn't it?

421
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:24,665
Very funny.

422
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:32,175
If I'd had a stopwatch,
I could have timed the explosion.

423
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:35,465
Shut up! Shut up!

424
00:39:41,055 --> 00:39:44,225
This may be too blunt,

425
00:39:45,355 --> 00:39:49,065
but for the children's sake,
will you please get out.

426
00:39:58,615 --> 00:40:01,615
Forgive us, if you can.

427
00:40:32,105 --> 00:40:35,735
It was with mixed feelings
I saw this region again.

428
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:39,075
I had my first practice here,

429
00:40:39,615 --> 00:40:43,785
and my old mother lives nearby.

430
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,255
Hello there, Doctor.

431
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:59,965
So you're in these parts again,
Doctor?

432
00:41:00,095 --> 00:41:03,175
Shall I fill it up?
Pass me the key to the hood.

433
00:41:05,975 --> 00:41:08,475
Eva! Come here a moment!

434
00:41:10,565 --> 00:41:14,025
It's Dr. Borg in person.

435
00:41:14,895 --> 00:41:18,985
Mom and Dad and the whole countryside
still talk about him.

436
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:21,325
The world's best doctor.

437
00:41:22,905 --> 00:41:26,615
Let's call the baby after him.

438
00:41:26,705 --> 00:41:30,035
Isak Akerman-- not a bad name
for a prime minister.

439
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:32,125
Suppose it's a girl.

440
00:41:32,205 --> 00:41:35,215
We only have boys.

441
00:41:41,595 --> 00:41:44,595
And how's your father these days?

442
00:41:44,675 --> 00:41:48,645
Oh, Dad's getting a bit decrepit.

443
00:41:48,765 --> 00:41:51,515
But Mom's as lively as a cricket.

444
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:55,065
And you're going to see
your mother, Doctor?

445
00:41:56,195 --> 00:42:00,115
She's amazing.
She must be at least 95.

446
00:42:00,195 --> 00:42:02,695
- Ninety-six.
- Imagine that.

447
00:42:04,865 --> 00:42:06,495
What do I owe you?

448
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:09,745
- This is on Eva and me!
- Absolutely not!

449
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:13,705
Don't insult us, Doctor.
We can do the proper thing too!

450
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:18,375
Why should you pay
for my gasoline?

451
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:22,255
There are things
that can't be paid back--

452
00:42:22,385 --> 00:42:24,005
not even with gas.

453
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:26,595
We haven't forgotten.

454
00:42:26,725 --> 00:42:30,475
Ask anyone around here.

455
00:42:30,555 --> 00:42:33,565
They all remember your kindness.

456
00:42:35,605 --> 00:42:38,855
Maybe I should have stayed here.

457
00:42:38,945 --> 00:42:40,525
What do you mean?

458
00:42:43,775 --> 00:42:46,575
You said you should have stayed.

459
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,865
Did l?

460
00:42:48,955 --> 00:42:52,455
Well, thanks anyway.

461
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:58,295
Let me know when the new son arrives,
and I'll be the godfather.

462
00:42:58,415 --> 00:43:00,295
You know where to find me.

463
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:26,445
During lunch I was in good spirits

464
00:43:26,535 --> 00:43:30,995
and told the young people about
my years as district medical officer.

465
00:43:31,115 --> 00:43:33,745
My stories were quite a success,

466
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:37,125
and I don't think they laughed
merely out of courtesy.

467
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:42,125
I had wine with the lunch,
and then port with the coffee.

468
00:43:46,305 --> 00:43:51,935
Ah, when creation shows
so much beauty,

469
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:56,105
how radiant must be its source!

470
00:43:56,185 --> 00:43:58,355
He is going to be a minister,
and Viktor a doctor.

471
00:43:58,475 --> 00:44:00,605
Reciting poetry
is against our agreement

472
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:05,115
not to discuss God
or science on this trip.

473
00:44:05,195 --> 00:44:06,445
It was beautiful!

474
00:44:06,525 --> 00:44:10,945
How can anyone today
study to become a minister!

475
00:44:11,035 --> 00:44:15,455
Your rationalism is as dry as dust.

476
00:44:15,535 --> 00:44:17,285
I say that modern man--

477
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,165
I say that--

478
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:24,425
believes only in himself

479
00:44:24,505 --> 00:44:26,135
and his biological death.

480
00:44:26,255 --> 00:44:29,005
Modern man is a figment
of your imagination.

481
00:44:29,135 --> 00:44:32,725
Man regards death with horror.

482
00:44:32,845 --> 00:44:37,105
Religion for the people.
Opium for the aching limb.

483
00:44:37,185 --> 00:44:38,765
How sweet they both are!

484
00:44:38,855 --> 00:44:40,895
I always agree with the one
I spoke with last.

485
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:43,895
Once you believed in Santa Claus--
now in God.

486
00:44:44,025 --> 00:44:47,485
You never had any imagination!

487
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:50,075
What do you say, Professor?

488
00:44:50,195 --> 00:44:55,995
Whatever I said
would be met with tolerant irony,

489
00:44:56,075 --> 00:44:57,625
so I'll say nothing.

490
00:44:57,705 --> 00:44:59,625
I'm sure they'll be disappointed.

491
00:44:59,705 --> 00:45:03,415
No, Sara. Very, very happy.

492
00:45:05,505 --> 00:45:09,005
"Where is the friend I seek

493
00:45:09,095 --> 00:45:14,805
at break of day?

494
00:45:14,885 --> 00:45:18,855
When night falls, when--"

495
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,275
"When night falls,
I still have not found Him."

496
00:45:22,395 --> 00:45:26,155
"My burning heart
shows me His traces--"

497
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:28,195
Are you religious, Professor?

498
00:45:30,405 --> 00:45:34,495
"I see His traces

499
00:45:34,575 --> 00:45:39,375
wherever flowers bloom.

500
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:49,755
His love is mingled with every air."

501
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:53,675
"His voice calls
in the summer wind."

502
00:45:53,765 --> 00:45:56,885
Not bad for a love poem.

503
00:45:57,765 --> 00:46:02,065
I've gone all solemn again
for no reason.

504
00:46:03,275 --> 00:46:08,405
Well, I'm going to call on my mother.
I'll be back soon.

505
00:46:08,525 --> 00:46:11,235
- May I come?
- Of course.

506
00:46:22,955 --> 00:46:25,295
Here comes the thunder.

507
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:36,305
I have just sent you a telegram

508
00:46:36,385 --> 00:46:39,435
on your great day.

509
00:46:39,725 --> 00:46:41,265
And now you're here.

510
00:46:41,355 --> 00:46:44,855
We all have our bright moments,
dear Mother.

511
00:46:47,355 --> 00:46:50,155
Is that your wife over there?

512
00:46:50,235 --> 00:46:53,275
I don't want to talk to her.

513
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:56,365
She has done us too much harm.

514
00:46:56,495 --> 00:46:59,205
No, Mother dear.

515
00:46:59,325 --> 00:47:03,915
This is Evald's wife, Marianne.

516
00:47:03,995 --> 00:47:07,045
Well, let her come
and say hello to me.

517
00:47:09,335 --> 00:47:11,295
Good day, Mrs. Borg.

518
00:47:11,585 --> 00:47:14,925
And why are you
gadding about like this?

519
00:47:15,005 --> 00:47:17,015
I have been in Stockholm for a visit.

520
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:21,265
Why aren't you with Evald
and the child?

521
00:47:21,345 --> 00:47:24,265
Evald and I have no children.

522
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:29,485
These young people nowadays!
I bore ten children.

523
00:47:31,155 --> 00:47:36,905
Will you please hand me
that big box over there.

524
00:47:38,945 --> 00:47:41,865
My mother lived in this house.

525
00:47:41,955 --> 00:47:45,585
Do you remember
coming to see her, Isak?

526
00:47:45,705 --> 00:47:47,545
Very well.

527
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:51,675
Here are some of your toys.

528
00:47:51,795 --> 00:47:56,715
I have been trying to think
which of you owned what.

529
00:47:56,805 --> 00:48:00,555
Ten children,
and all dead except Isak.

530
00:48:00,635 --> 00:48:02,765
Twenty grandchildren.

531
00:48:02,895 --> 00:48:05,805
Evald's the only one
who comes to see me.

532
00:48:05,895 --> 00:48:08,645
Don't get me wrong--
I'm not complaining.

533
00:48:09,525 --> 00:48:12,735
Fifteen great-grandchildren
whom I have never seen.

534
00:48:12,855 --> 00:48:18,575
I send presents
for all their birthdays.

535
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:24,535
I get letters of thanks,
but nobody bothers to visit me

536
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:28,165
unless they want to borrow money.

537
00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:31,415
Oh, I know I'm tiresome.

538
00:48:31,545 --> 00:48:34,045
Don't think that, Mother.

539
00:48:34,175 --> 00:48:36,295
And I've one more fault.

540
00:48:36,845 --> 00:48:38,805
I don't die.

541
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:42,555
The inheritance
isn't being divided up

542
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:45,685
the way these crafty young people
had planned.

543
00:48:46,855 --> 00:48:50,275
This was Sigbritt's doll.

544
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:53,565
She got it when she turned eight.

545
00:48:53,775 --> 00:48:56,405
I made the dress myself.

546
00:48:56,525 --> 00:48:58,905
But she never cared for it

547
00:48:58,985 --> 00:49:00,945
so it went to Charlotta.

548
00:49:01,035 --> 00:49:04,575
She took care of it--
I remember it clearly.

549
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,125
Do you see who that is?

550
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:11,545
Sigfrid was three
and you were five.

551
00:49:12,255 --> 00:49:15,675
And myself.

552
00:49:15,795 --> 00:49:18,215
What a fright
one looked in those days.

553
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:20,715
May I have it?

554
00:49:20,805 --> 00:49:23,345
By all means.
It's only rubbish.

555
00:49:24,345 --> 00:49:26,185
And here's a coloring book.

556
00:49:26,305 --> 00:49:31,935
I don't know whose it was.

557
00:49:32,025 --> 00:49:34,605
They've all put their names in it.

558
00:49:35,645 --> 00:49:37,655
Kristina has scrawled:

559
00:49:37,735 --> 00:49:42,695
"I love Papa more than
anything in the whole world."

560
00:49:43,945 --> 00:49:48,955
And Birgitta has put:
"I'm going to marry Papa."

561
00:49:49,995 --> 00:49:54,375
Isn't that funny?
I laughed when I saw it.

562
00:49:55,415 --> 00:49:59,545
Don't you think it's cold in here?

563
00:49:59,675 --> 00:50:02,305
No, not particularly.

564
00:50:02,385 --> 00:50:06,055
I have felt cold all my life.

565
00:50:06,185 --> 00:50:09,645
Mostly my stomach.
I wonder why.

566
00:50:09,725 --> 00:50:12,565
You have low blood pressure.

567
00:50:12,685 --> 00:50:17,525
Let us have some tea,
and we can sit and talk.

568
00:50:17,645 --> 00:50:20,815
No, thank you, Mother.
We won't disturb you any longer.

569
00:50:25,035 --> 00:50:27,995
Sigbritt's eldest boy
will soon be 50.

570
00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:31,165
I thought of giving him
Father's gold watch.

571
00:50:31,285 --> 00:50:35,205
It has no hands.
Does that matter?

572
00:50:45,135 --> 00:50:49,435
I remember when Sigbritt's boy
was a newborn.

573
00:50:49,555 --> 00:50:54,935
He used to lie in the lilac arbor
at the summer house.

574
00:50:55,065 --> 00:50:58,105
Now he's turning 50.

575
00:50:59,235 --> 00:51:04,695
And little cousin Sara used to
carry him around and sing to him.

576
00:51:04,825 --> 00:51:07,575
She married Sigfrid,
that good-for-nothing.

577
00:51:08,575 --> 00:51:14,035
Well, you must go now,
or you'll be late for the ceremony.

578
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:19,215
I am very glad you came,
and I hope to see you again.

579
00:51:19,295 --> 00:51:22,795
Give my love to Evald.
Good-bye.

580
00:51:49,495 --> 00:51:51,915
Where are Anders and Viktor?

581
00:51:51,995 --> 00:51:57,625
They started arguing about God,
and then they lost their tempers.

582
00:51:58,085 --> 00:52:01,215
And Anders tried
to twist Viktor's arm,

583
00:52:01,295 --> 00:52:05,255
and Viktor said that was
a lousy argument for God's existence.

584
00:52:05,345 --> 00:52:08,965
I said they could talk
about me instead.

585
00:52:09,095 --> 00:52:13,805
Then they told me to shut up
because I didn't understand the debate,

586
00:52:13,895 --> 00:52:15,355
so I left.

587
00:52:15,475 --> 00:52:19,605
They went up the hill to fight it out
because each insisted...

588
00:52:19,685 --> 00:52:22,645
the other had hurt
his innermost feelings.

589
00:52:22,735 --> 00:52:24,985
- Where are they now?
- Up there.

590
00:52:29,075 --> 00:52:30,695
I'll see to them.

591
00:52:30,825 --> 00:52:33,245
Which one do you like best?

592
00:52:33,615 --> 00:52:35,825
Which one do you like best?

593
00:52:35,955 --> 00:52:39,335
I don't know.
Anders is going to be a minister--

594
00:52:39,415 --> 00:52:41,465
He's a darling.

595
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:44,425
But a minister's wife--

596
00:52:44,505 --> 00:52:47,505
Viktor's nice too.
In a different way.

597
00:52:47,595 --> 00:52:51,015
- Viktor will go far, of course.
- What do you mean?

598
00:52:51,135 --> 00:52:56,355
A doctor earns more money.
And ministers are out of date.

599
00:52:56,475 --> 00:53:00,145
Though he has got nice legs
and a sweet neck.

600
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:03,355
But how can anyone believe in God?

601
00:53:16,995 --> 00:53:19,585
Well? Does God exist?

602
00:53:43,275 --> 00:53:48,735
I dozed off,
but was haunted by vivid

603
00:53:48,815 --> 00:53:54,405
and humiliating dreams.

604
00:53:55,365 --> 00:54:01,705
There was something overpowering
in these dream images

605
00:54:01,795 --> 00:54:07,755
that bored relentlessly into my mind.

606
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:20,435
Have you looked in the mirror, Isak?

607
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:25,565
Then I'll show you
what you look like.

608
00:54:27,605 --> 00:54:30,905
You're a worried old man
who's soon going to die,

609
00:54:30,985 --> 00:54:33,695
but I have all my life before me.

610
00:54:35,285 --> 00:54:37,705
That hurt your feelings, after all.

611
00:54:38,615 --> 00:54:41,915
No, it didn't hurt.

612
00:54:41,995 --> 00:54:47,085
Yes, it hurt
because you can't bear the truth.

613
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:51,675
The truth is that
I've been too considerate.

614
00:54:52,295 --> 00:54:54,425
And so became unintentionally cruel.

615
00:54:57,595 --> 00:54:58,685
I understand.

616
00:54:58,805 --> 00:55:03,725
No, you don't understand.
We don't speak the same language.

617
00:55:04,975 --> 00:55:06,685
Look in the mirror again.

618
00:55:06,815 --> 00:55:08,815
No, don't turn away.

619
00:55:09,445 --> 00:55:10,985
I see.

620
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,275
Listen to me.

621
00:55:14,485 --> 00:55:17,705
I'm going to marry
your brother Sigfrid.

622
00:55:18,535 --> 00:55:22,665
Love is almost a game for us.

623
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:28,835
Look at your face now.
Try to smile!

624
00:55:30,505 --> 00:55:33,095
There! Now you're smiling.

625
00:55:35,175 --> 00:55:37,215
But it hurts so.

626
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:42,685
As professor emerit us,
you ought to know why it hurts.

627
00:55:42,765 --> 00:55:44,305
But you don't know.

628
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:49,395
You know so much,
and you don't know anything.

629
00:55:51,355 --> 00:55:52,985
I must go.

630
00:55:53,115 --> 00:55:56,655
I promised to keep an eye
on Sigbritt's baby.

631
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:27,605
Poor little thing.

632
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:31,065
Hush, baby. Sleep.

633
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,155
Don't be afraid of the wind

634
00:56:35,235 --> 00:56:40,075
or the birds

635
00:56:40,905 --> 00:56:43,865
or the waves of the sea.

636
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:47,915
I'm here with you,
holding you tight.

637
00:56:47,995 --> 00:56:50,545
Don't be afraid, little one.

638
00:56:51,915 --> 00:56:54,045
It will soon be day again.

639
00:56:55,085 --> 00:56:57,095
No one will hurt you.

640
00:56:57,175 --> 00:57:00,345
I am with you.
I am holding you.

641
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:10,495
Please come in, Professor Borg.

642
01:01:28,825 --> 01:01:30,825
Have you brought
your examination book?

643
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:42,005
Please identify the bacterial specimen
under the microscope.

644
01:01:53,425 --> 01:01:55,515
There must be something wrong.

645
01:01:59,725 --> 01:02:01,225
Not with the microscope.

646
01:02:01,355 --> 01:02:04,645
I can't see a thing.

647
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:08,405
Please read this text.

648
01:02:23,335 --> 01:02:24,755
What does it mean?

649
01:02:26,505 --> 01:02:28,255
I don't know.

650
01:02:29,925 --> 01:02:31,005
Really?

651
01:02:31,095 --> 01:02:34,925
I'm a doctor, not a linguist.

652
01:02:35,975 --> 01:02:41,725
What you see on the blackboard
is a doctor's first duty.

653
01:02:42,855 --> 01:02:45,775
Don't you know what that is?

654
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:50,365
Let me think.

655
01:02:50,445 --> 01:02:52,075
Take your time.

656
01:02:54,115 --> 01:02:58,245
A doctor's first duty--

657
01:02:58,705 --> 01:03:00,415
A doctor's--

658
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:03,545
I've forgotten.

659
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:07,875
A doctor's first duty
is to ask for forgiveness.

660
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:12,965
Of course! Now I remember!

661
01:03:24,685 --> 01:03:27,355
You have been accused of guilt.

662
01:03:30,525 --> 01:03:33,825
I'll make a note that you haven't
understood the charge.

663
01:03:36,995 --> 01:03:38,955
Is it serious?

664
01:03:39,665 --> 01:03:41,325
Unfortunately, Professor.

665
01:03:53,345 --> 01:03:55,005
I have a weak heart.

666
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,385
I'm an old man.

667
01:03:57,515 --> 01:04:00,345
You must be lenient with me.
It's only fair.

668
01:04:00,765 --> 01:04:03,475
There's nothing about your heart
in my papers.

669
01:04:04,105 --> 01:04:05,515
Do you want to stop the examination?

670
01:04:05,605 --> 01:04:07,645
No, for God's sake, no!

671
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:18,365
Please diagnose the patient.

672
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:34,845
The patient is dead.

673
01:04:57,115 --> 01:04:59,325
What are you writing in my book?

674
01:04:59,405 --> 01:05:02,495
- My verdict.
- And that is?

675
01:05:02,915 --> 01:05:04,875
That you are incompetent.

676
01:05:08,245 --> 01:05:13,585
You are also accused of some minor
but still serious offenses.

677
01:05:14,255 --> 01:05:18,675
Callousness, selfishness,
ruthlessness.

678
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,475
Your wife has made the charge.

679
01:05:22,595 --> 01:05:24,935
You'll be confronted with her.

680
01:05:25,015 --> 01:05:27,515
But my wife has been dead for years!

681
01:05:27,605 --> 01:05:29,475
Do you think I'm joking?

682
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:34,235
Please come with me.

683
01:05:34,735 --> 01:05:36,815
You have no choice.

684
01:07:57,415 --> 01:08:00,425
Many forget a woman
who has been dead for 30 years.

685
01:08:01,085 --> 01:08:04,215
Some cherish
a sweet and fading picture,

686
01:08:05,135 --> 01:08:10,305
but you can recall this scene
at any time.

687
01:08:11,145 --> 01:08:13,855
Tuesday, May 1 st, 1917.

688
01:08:15,105 --> 01:08:16,775
You stood on this very spot.

689
01:08:16,895 --> 01:08:21,315
and heard and saw what that man
and woman said and did.

690
01:08:36,335 --> 01:08:40,795
Now I'll go home and tell Isak.
I know just what he'll say.

691
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:44,215
"My poor girl, I'm sorry for you."

692
01:08:46,095 --> 01:08:48,465
Just as if he were God.

693
01:08:50,095 --> 01:08:55,305
Then I'll weep and say,
"Do you really feel sorry for me?"

694
01:08:56,565 --> 01:09:00,985
He'll say, "Yes, very sorry."

695
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:05,615
Then I'll weep even more
and ask him to forgive me.

696
01:09:05,735 --> 01:09:06,945
He'll say,

697
01:09:07,025 --> 01:09:12,325
"You mustn't beg my forgiveness.
There is nothing to forgive."

698
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,835
But he doesn't mean
a word he says

699
01:09:19,835 --> 01:09:22,085
because he's cold as ice.

700
01:09:24,005 --> 01:09:26,675
And suddenly he gets very tender,

701
01:09:28,215 --> 01:09:30,715
and I scream at him that he's mad

702
01:09:32,515 --> 01:09:35,765
and that his hypocrisy makes me sick.

703
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,815
Then he says
he'll get me a sedative

704
01:09:39,935 --> 01:09:43,145
and that he understands
everything quite well.

705
01:09:44,355 --> 01:09:46,485
And I tell him it's his fault
that I am as I am.

706
01:09:48,945 --> 01:09:53,075
And he looks sad
and says it is his fault.

707
01:09:54,995 --> 01:09:57,285
But he doesn't really care
about anything

708
01:09:57,955 --> 01:09:59,915
because he's so cold.

709
01:10:23,895 --> 01:10:25,395
Where is she?

710
01:10:25,485 --> 01:10:29,945
Gone. All are gone.

711
01:10:30,075 --> 01:10:33,995
Removed by an operation,
Professor.

712
01:10:34,615 --> 01:10:38,245
A surgical masterpiece.
No pain.

713
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:40,285
Nothing that bleeds or trembles.

714
01:10:41,205 --> 01:10:43,375
How silent it is.

715
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,875
A perfect achievement
in its way, Professor.

716
01:10:47,925 --> 01:10:49,715
And the punishment?

717
01:10:49,795 --> 01:10:53,465
I don't know.
The usual, I suppose.

718
01:10:53,595 --> 01:10:55,135
The usual?

719
01:10:55,265 --> 01:10:57,135
Loneliness.

720
01:10:57,265 --> 01:10:59,555
Loneliness?

721
01:10:59,645 --> 01:11:02,475
Precisely.

722
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,315
Is there no mercy?

723
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:08,775
Don't ask me. I don't know.

724
01:11:29,005 --> 01:11:30,755
What's this?

725
01:11:31,595 --> 01:11:34,465
The children wanted
to stretch their legs.

726
01:11:34,555 --> 01:11:37,265
But it's still raining.

727
01:11:37,345 --> 01:11:42,015
I told them about today
and they want to honor you.

728
01:11:43,475 --> 01:11:44,525
Slept well?

729
01:11:44,645 --> 01:11:50,405
Yes, but recently I've had
the weirdest dreams,

730
01:11:55,235 --> 01:11:59,575
as if I  must tell myself something
I won't listen to when I'm awake.

731
01:11:59,665 --> 01:12:00,995
What's that?

732
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:05,495
That I'm dead.
Although I'm alive.

733
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:08,875
You and Evald are very alike.

734
01:12:09,755 --> 01:12:11,425
So you've said.

735
01:12:11,505 --> 01:12:13,755
He said the same thing.

736
01:12:14,175 --> 01:12:16,215
About me?

737
01:12:16,345 --> 01:12:18,055
No. About himself.

738
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,635
But he's only 38.

739
01:12:22,225 --> 01:12:24,725
May I tell you about it?

740
01:12:24,855 --> 01:12:28,775
Yes, I'd be grateful.

741
01:12:30,355 --> 01:12:34,695
A few months ago
I wanted to talk to Evald,

742
01:12:34,825 --> 01:12:36,905
so he drove me down to the sea.

743
01:12:37,035 --> 01:12:41,075
It was raining then too.
He sat where you sit now.

744
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:47,705
Well, you've trapped me.
What do you want to say?

745
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:50,045
Something unpleasant, of course.

746
01:12:51,425 --> 01:12:53,505
I wish I didn't have to.

747
01:12:53,585 --> 01:12:55,675
You have found someone else.

748
01:12:56,555 --> 01:12:58,385
Don't be childish.

749
01:12:58,515 --> 01:13:03,095
You tell me in funereal tones
that you must talk to me,

750
01:13:03,225 --> 01:13:06,935
and then you find it
hard to begin.

751
01:13:07,065 --> 01:13:12,985
Come on, for heaven's sake!
Don't keep me on tenterhooks!

752
01:13:13,065 --> 01:13:14,905
I almost want to laugh now.

753
01:13:15,025 --> 01:13:16,905
Whatever do you think
I'm going to tell you?

754
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:21,205
That I've killed someone,
or stolen the faculty funds?

755
01:13:21,325 --> 01:13:22,955
I'm going to have a baby.

756
01:13:25,825 --> 01:13:27,375
Are you sure?

757
01:13:27,455 --> 01:13:29,875
The doctor told me yesterday.

758
01:13:29,955 --> 01:13:34,335
So that was the secret.

759
01:13:35,335 --> 01:13:39,635
I might as well tell you
that I intend to have this child.

760
01:13:40,845 --> 01:13:43,475
- You've made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.

761
01:13:59,945 --> 01:14:02,035
You know I don't want a child.

762
01:14:02,115 --> 01:14:04,575
You'll have to choose
between me and the child.

763
01:14:04,665 --> 01:14:07,745
- Poor Evald.
- Don't "poor Evald" me!

764
01:14:08,535 --> 01:14:12,045
It's absurd to bring children
into this world

765
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:15,005
and think they'll be better off
than we are.

766
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:18,965
- That's just an excuse.
- Call it what you want.

767
01:14:19,095 --> 01:14:23,385
I was an unwanted child
in a hellish marriage.

768
01:14:23,475 --> 01:14:26,345
Is he even sure I'm his son?

769
01:14:26,475 --> 01:14:30,105
That's no excuse
for behaving like this.

770
01:14:30,225 --> 01:14:31,775
I must be at the hospital at 3:00.

771
01:14:31,855 --> 01:14:34,815
I have neither the time nor the desire
to discuss this any further.

772
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:38,815
You're a coward.

773
01:14:39,365 --> 01:14:40,825
Yes.

774
01:14:41,195 --> 01:14:43,325
This life sickens me.

775
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,115
I will not be forced to take on

776
01:14:45,205 --> 01:14:48,035
a responsibility that will make me live
for one day longer than I want to.

777
01:14:48,165 --> 01:14:53,005
And you know
that I mean what I say.

778
01:15:05,425 --> 01:15:07,265
I know that this is wrong.

779
01:15:07,345 --> 01:15:09,685
There's neither right nor wrong.

780
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:13,935
We act according to our needs.

781
01:15:14,025 --> 01:15:15,315
And what are they?

782
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:20,525
Yours is a hellish desire
to live and to create life.

783
01:15:20,655 --> 01:15:21,775
And yours?

784
01:15:22,905 --> 01:15:26,905
Mine is to be dead.
Stone-dead.

785
01:15:39,795 --> 01:15:43,555
If you want to smoke a cigarette,
I don't mind.

786
01:15:47,885 --> 01:15:50,725
Why have you told me all this?

787
01:15:53,185 --> 01:15:59,105
I saw you with your mother,
and I was panic-stricken.

788
01:16:00,605 --> 01:16:02,275
I don't understand.

789
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:09,155
I thought: That's his mother.

790
01:16:09,955 --> 01:16:15,045
An old woman, cold as ice,

791
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:18,165
more forbidding than death.

792
01:16:19,425 --> 01:16:21,675
And this is her son,

793
01:16:22,215 --> 01:16:25,385
and there are light-years
between them.

794
01:16:26,425 --> 01:16:29,055
He himself says
he's a living corpse.

795
01:16:31,185 --> 01:16:36,605
And Evald is growing
just as lonely, cold and dead.

796
01:16:38,275 --> 01:16:41,275
And I thought of the baby inside me.

797
01:16:42,275 --> 01:16:46,535
All along the line,
there's nothing but cold and death

798
01:16:46,615 --> 01:16:49,615
and loneliness.

799
01:16:50,495 --> 01:16:52,825
It must end somewhere.

800
01:16:53,995 --> 01:16:56,545
But you're going back to Evald!

801
01:16:58,295 --> 01:17:01,375
To say I can't agree
to his conditions.

802
01:17:01,465 --> 01:17:05,465
I want this child.
No one can take it from me.

803
01:17:05,595 --> 01:17:08,015
Not even the man
I love most of all.

804
01:17:11,475 --> 01:17:13,515
Can I help you?

805
01:17:13,645 --> 01:17:15,105
No one can help me.

806
01:17:16,685 --> 01:17:19,775
We are too old.
Things have gone too far.

807
01:17:20,685 --> 01:17:23,525
What happened after your talk?

808
01:17:23,655 --> 01:17:26,115
Nothing.
I left him the next day.

809
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,735
Hasn't he gotten in touch with you?

810
01:17:30,655 --> 01:17:35,415
- I don't want us to get--
- To get what?

811
01:17:37,165 --> 01:17:39,795
Like those two in the car today.

812
01:17:41,545 --> 01:17:44,175
I was just thinking of them.

813
01:17:44,715 --> 01:17:48,215
It reminded me of my own marriage.

814
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:50,805
But we love each other.

815
01:17:50,885 --> 01:17:53,345
Long may he live
Long may he live

816
01:17:53,475 --> 01:17:56,305
May he live to be
a hundred years old

817
01:17:58,605 --> 01:18:01,525
We heard you're celebrating
a grand occasion today.

818
01:18:01,605 --> 01:18:05,815
With these simple flowers
we want to say

819
01:18:05,905 --> 01:18:10,485
that we are very impressed
that you've been a doctor for 50 years.

820
01:18:10,575 --> 01:18:14,365
We know you must be
a very wise old man

821
01:18:15,205 --> 01:18:17,875
who knows everything about life

822
01:18:17,995 --> 01:18:22,415
and has learned
all the instructions by heart.

823
01:18:24,715 --> 01:18:27,175
Thank you.

824
01:18:28,425 --> 01:18:31,595
Now we must go on.
It's getting late.

825
01:19:00,705 --> 01:19:05,165
So you did come.
Evald and I had given up hope.

826
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:08,215
A nice drive is relaxing, isn't it?

827
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:12,005
You'll have to get
into your tails at once.

828
01:19:13,055 --> 01:19:16,685
Good afternoon, Marianne.
I've told Evald you're coming.

829
01:19:16,765 --> 01:19:19,265
Thank you.
That was most kind.

830
01:19:20,265 --> 01:19:22,145
So you came after all, Miss Agda.

831
01:19:22,265 --> 01:19:27,355
I considered it my duty.
But my pleasure's been spoiled.

832
01:19:28,655 --> 01:19:30,235
Welcome, Father.

833
01:19:31,485 --> 01:19:33,535
As you see,
I've brought Marianne with me.

834
01:19:33,615 --> 01:19:36,365
- Hello, Marianne.
- May I put my things upstairs?

835
01:19:36,455 --> 01:19:39,455
The guest room as usual, Father?

836
01:19:39,575 --> 01:19:41,955
Let me take your bag.
It's rather heavy.

837
01:19:45,835 --> 01:19:48,715
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, it was pleasant.

838
01:19:48,795 --> 01:19:50,045
Who are those young people?

839
01:19:50,135 --> 01:19:52,345
I don't know. They're nice,
and they're off to Italy.

840
01:19:52,465 --> 01:19:55,425
- They seem nice.
- Yes, they're very nice.

841
01:19:55,515 --> 01:19:58,225
It's a quarter past 4:00.

842
01:20:03,315 --> 01:20:05,315
I've bought you new shoelaces.

843
01:20:14,275 --> 01:20:16,655
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so don't worry.

844
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:19,155
- Are you going to a hotel?
- No, why?

845
01:20:19,245 --> 01:20:22,955
Can't we share the bedroom
for one more night? Unless you object.

846
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:26,045
- Give me a hand unpacking?
- It's nice to see you.

847
01:20:26,205 --> 01:20:28,125
And unexpected.

848
01:20:28,215 --> 01:20:29,925
Same here.

849
01:20:30,005 --> 01:20:32,845
Are we going on
to the banquet afterwards?

850
01:20:32,965 --> 01:20:37,465
Yes, I'll just call Stenberg
and tell him I'll have a lady with me.

851
01:20:45,145 --> 01:20:47,275
Hurry up, Professor!

852
01:22:22,195 --> 01:22:27,125
During the ceremony,

853
01:22:27,245 --> 01:22:31,165
my thoughts strayed
to the day's events,

854
01:22:31,955 --> 01:22:36,175
and it was then I decided

855
01:22:36,295 --> 01:22:39,095
to write down what had happened.

856
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:45,475
In this jumble of events,

857
01:22:45,555 --> 01:22:49,765
I seemed to discern
an extraordinary logic.

858
01:23:15,415 --> 01:23:18,385
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

859
01:23:18,505 --> 01:23:20,215
Yes, thank you.

860
01:23:22,095 --> 01:23:23,635
Are you tired, Miss Agda?

861
01:23:23,715 --> 01:23:25,305
I won't deny it.

862
01:23:25,425 --> 01:23:27,475
Take one of my sleeping pills.

863
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:35,185
Miss Agda, I am sorry
about this morning.

864
01:23:35,735 --> 01:23:37,695
Are you ill, Professor?

865
01:23:37,775 --> 01:23:39,695
No. Why?

866
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:43,235
I don't like the sound of it.

867
01:23:43,865 --> 01:23:46,205
Is it so rare
for me to say I'm sorry?

868
01:23:48,915 --> 01:23:51,245
Do you want the carafe
on the table?

869
01:24:15,395 --> 01:24:19,315
Thank you anyway, Professor.
Good night.

870
01:24:19,905 --> 01:24:21,655
Miss Agda,

871
01:24:23,655 --> 01:24:27,955
as we have known each other

872
01:24:28,075 --> 01:24:30,205
for so many years,

873
01:24:30,285 --> 01:24:33,785
don't you think we could call
each other Agda and Isak?

874
01:24:33,915 --> 01:24:36,545
No, I don't.

875
01:24:36,665 --> 01:24:37,965
Why not?

876
01:24:38,755 --> 01:24:40,585
Have you brushed your teeth,
Professor?

877
01:24:42,425 --> 01:24:46,555
No intimacies for me, thank you.

878
01:24:46,635 --> 01:24:48,805
It's all right between us as it is.

879
01:24:48,925 --> 01:24:51,845
But we are old now.

880
01:24:51,935 --> 01:24:56,725
Speak for yourself.
A woman is jealous of her reputation.

881
01:24:57,435 --> 01:25:01,655
What would people think if we
suddenly began to say Agda and Isak?

882
01:25:01,775 --> 01:25:03,695
They would make fun of us.

883
01:25:03,775 --> 01:25:07,195
Are you always right?

884
01:25:07,285 --> 01:25:09,365
Almost always.

885
01:25:09,455 --> 01:25:14,455
At our age,
we should know how to behave.

886
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:25,965
Good night, Professor.
I'll leave the door ajar.

887
01:25:26,055 --> 01:25:30,095
You know where I am
if you want anything.

888
01:26:15,725 --> 01:26:19,395
Father Isak! You were splendid
in the procession.

889
01:26:19,525 --> 01:26:21,485
We were terribly proud
to know you.

890
01:26:21,565 --> 01:26:25,525
An old girl is giving us a lift
all the way to Hamburg.

891
01:26:25,655 --> 01:26:28,525
- Anders is mad about her.
- Oh, be quiet.

892
01:26:28,655 --> 01:26:30,445
We just wanted to say good-bye.

893
01:26:30,535 --> 01:26:32,995
Good-bye. And thank you
for your company.

894
01:26:35,325 --> 01:26:37,625
It's you I really love, you know.

895
01:26:37,705 --> 01:26:41,755
Today, tomorrow, always.

896
01:26:42,255 --> 01:26:44,125
I'll remember.

897
01:26:44,545 --> 01:26:47,255
Come on.

898
01:26:52,725 --> 01:26:56,475
We have to go now.

899
01:27:00,065 --> 01:27:02,185
Let me hear from you.

900
01:27:14,325 --> 01:27:16,825
- I think Uncle is asleep.
- Evald!

901
01:27:18,665 --> 01:27:19,915
Yes, Father?

902
01:27:20,035 --> 01:27:21,665
Are you back already?

903
01:27:23,005 --> 01:27:25,465
Marianne lost the heel on a shoe.

904
01:27:27,425 --> 01:27:29,545
So you're going to the dance?

905
01:27:30,755 --> 01:27:32,675
I suppose so.

906
01:27:33,805 --> 01:27:36,885
- How are you, Father?
- Excellent.

907
01:27:36,975 --> 01:27:39,725
- Heart all right?
- Excellent.

908
01:27:41,475 --> 01:27:43,565
Sleep well.

909
01:27:45,775 --> 01:27:48,735
Sit down a moment.

910
01:27:50,445 --> 01:27:52,365
Anything special?

911
01:27:53,655 --> 01:27:58,995
How is it to be
between you and Marianne?

912
01:28:00,455 --> 01:28:02,085
Forgive my asking.

913
01:28:02,205 --> 01:28:03,705
I don't know.

914
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:07,295
It's not my business, but--

915
01:28:09,295 --> 01:28:11,845
But wouldn't it--

916
01:28:11,965 --> 01:28:13,965
I have asked her to stay with me.

917
01:28:14,095 --> 01:28:16,265
Shouldn't you-- I mean--

918
01:28:16,385 --> 01:28:20,645
- I can't live without her.
- You mean alone?

919
01:28:20,765 --> 01:28:23,815
I can't live without her.
That's what I mean.

920
01:28:23,935 --> 01:28:25,895
Oh, I see.

921
01:28:25,975 --> 01:28:27,735
It will be as she wants.

922
01:28:28,145 --> 01:28:30,815
And she--

923
01:28:31,485 --> 01:28:34,615
She says she'll think about it.

924
01:28:35,535 --> 01:28:37,495
About that debt of yours--

925
01:28:37,575 --> 01:28:39,785
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

926
01:28:39,915 --> 01:28:42,495
That's not what I meant.

927
01:28:44,995 --> 01:28:46,335
How are you, Uncle Isak?

928
01:28:46,455 --> 01:28:48,375
Fine.Just fine.

929
01:28:48,505 --> 01:28:51,465
I lost a heel.
Will these shoes do?

930
01:28:51,585 --> 01:28:54,045
They're very nice.

931
01:28:57,015 --> 01:28:59,095
Thanks for coming with me.

932
01:29:02,435 --> 01:29:05,355
I like you, Marianne.

933
01:29:05,975 --> 01:29:08,275
I like you too, Uncle Isak.

934
01:29:16,735 --> 01:29:20,905
If I have been worried
or sad during the day,

935
01:29:21,415 --> 01:29:26,995
it often calms me
to recall childhood memories.

936
01:29:28,005 --> 01:29:30,375
I did so on this evening too.

937
01:29:42,225 --> 01:29:45,605
Isak, there are no
wild strawberries left.

938
01:29:46,355 --> 01:29:48,565
Auntie wants you
to look for your papa.

939
01:29:48,685 --> 01:29:51,355
We'll sail around and meet you
at the other side of the island.

940
01:29:51,815 --> 01:29:56,195
I can't find either Papa or Mama.

941
01:29:56,775 --> 01:29:59,365
Come, I'll help you.
