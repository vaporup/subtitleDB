1
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,089
Let's go!

2
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,196
- Wang!
- Chon, for God's sakes.

3
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,460
- Now he shows up.
- I found it.

4
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,433
Wait. Do you want to hear?

5
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,994
The seal's gone.

6
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:12,930
Lin.

7
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,733
Roy!

8
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,737
Are we gonna come back?

9
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,575
Roy!

10
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,682
Must you keep doing that?

11
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,922
I was taught
not to be seen or heard.

12
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,523
The seal.

13
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,327
I am a man of my word.

14
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,667
I remember watching
my brother play with this

15
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,207
like a baby rattle.

16
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,604
When I'd try to touch it,
the dowager empress beat me.

17
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,674
No doubt your deprived childhood

18
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,015
made you into the man you are today.

19
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,214
Wu Chow.

20
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,881
Wu who?

21
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,255
He is the emperor's bastard brother.

22
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,760
He was banished
from the Forbidden City

23
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,660
for trying to steal the Imperial Seal.

24
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,028
Our father caught him.

25
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,068
He vowed to return to claim
the emperor's throne.

26
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,865
This guy?

27
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,463
I'll assume everything
has been arranged as discussed.

28
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:23,441
You have nothing to worry about.
It's all in place.

29
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,571
That diamond is as big
as a damn monkey's paw.

30
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,170
- Look at that.
- Roy.

31
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,875
Don't even think about it.

32
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,680
I'm just admiring
the craftsmanship, Chon.

33
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:36,120
So for now,
our business is completed.

34
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,092
Where's Lin?!

35
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,471
Hey! Hey!

36
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,918
Gotcha!

37
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,022
Just looking out for number one.

38
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:11,921
No!

39
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,126
The kid got the seal!

40
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,275
Chon!

41
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,615
It's stuck.

42
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:52,860
Lin!

43
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,305
Go! You can do it!

44
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,747
She's got it.

45
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:11,875
She's got it!

46
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,386
Roy! Come on!

47
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,888
Chon, what in our history together

48
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,425
makes you think I'm capable
of something like that?

49
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,084
- Roy!
- I can't do that!

50
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,025
Hurry up!

51
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,086
Wait.

52
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,859
There's a better way.

53
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,501
Slow down!

54
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,010
I'm a bat out of hell!

55
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,808
Yee-haw!

56
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,246
Besides, I don't know
where the brake is.

57
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,304
What?!

58
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,851
Look out!

59
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,404
So, what now, buddy?

60
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,880
Relax, relax.
Smooth sailing from here.

61
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,288
Yes, these are the men
who attacked me.

62
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:32,593
I'm afraid the assailants have
temporarily eluded us, my Lord.

63
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,600
Perhaps you could explain to me

64
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,728
how Loony Lin managed to escape

65
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,466
from the confines of
Scotland Yard under the watch

66
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,977
of the most respected
police force in the world.

67
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,173
Yes, of course.
It's absolutely fascinating.

68
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,341
She picked the lock

69
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,818
using a deck of rather
risque playing cards.

70
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:58,153
Then scaled the walls
with a mop, a fork...

71
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,658
and various pilfered undergarments.

72
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,388
You've got to hand it to the Chinese.

73
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,056
They're awfully ingenious,
Lord, aren't they?

74
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,766
Does your incompetence know
no bounds?!

75
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,129
Where am I?

76
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,497
Lin!

77
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,731
I don't even know these women.

78
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,708
Lin, what are you doing here?

79
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,508
Oh, Lord.

80
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,448
Do you want to try
the position on page 37?

81
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,821
Come here, you little minx.

82
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,660
What?

83
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,208
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

84
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,642
I've just been violated
by a barnyard animal.

85
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,341
Who would leave a pile of stones
in the middle of the field?

86
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,480
I don't know, Chon.
These people are nuts.

87
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,455
Come on.

88
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,956
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

89
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,365
This is a hell
of a damn adventure we're on.

90
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,666
I'm having
an absolute ball with you.

91
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,505
Me too.

92
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,144
Here we go.

93
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,046
Get your thumb out, maharaja.

94
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,607
- Why?
- Get over here.

95
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,381
Excuse me!

96
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,656
- Lin!
- Lin!

97
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,224
My shoulder's getting
a little tight.

98
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,928
This is your first time
in England, isn't it?

99
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,841
How do you know your way around?
It's incredible.

100
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,343
I always had a good sense
of direction.

101
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,277
You can say that again.

102
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,680
I wish we could say the same
about you-know-who.

103
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,446
I once sent him over a mountain range.

104
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,918
He was lost forever.

105
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,649
One time, I sent him
over the Great Wall.

106
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,455
- He was lost for three days.
- Three days?!

107
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,863
Oh, gosh, we got a lot in common.

108
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,366
I've never met
anybody like you, Roy.

109
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,266
- Really?
- Yeah.

110
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:02,073
Hey, can I tell you something
without you getting offended?

111
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,439
What?

112
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,638
You have a great body.

113
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,648
There. I said it.
It's out in the open.

114
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,579
- You must work out.
- Me?

115
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,814
Excuse me.

116
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,451
Chon, what are you doing?

117
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,926
I don't like the backseat.

118
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,295
Makes me sick. Dizzy.

119
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,969
Whitechapel.

120
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,475
This looks like
a nice enough neighborhood.

121
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,240
- What is Puss 'n' Boots?
- It's a boardinghouse.

122
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,683
Some of the sailors on the ship
coming over recommended it.

123
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,686
Come on. Come on!

124
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,630
I won't let my sister stay here.

125
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,830
What are we supposed to do?
Check in to the Savoy?

126
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,736
We'll get arrested
before we get to our room.

127
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,468
I don't mind this place.

128
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,314
See?
She's a little open-minded.

129
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,851
I know this sounds crazy
'cause I just met her...

130
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,717
but I think I'm falling for her.

131
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,017
I think she's the one.

132
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,819
Roy, she's my baby sister.

133
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,951
I know she is.
Thank God!

134
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,426
That's the only chance
I've got.

135
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,463
Look, I'm getting ready
to launch a little thing

136
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,294
called "Operation:
Sweep Her Off Her Feet."

137
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,425
You're in a position to talk me up.

138
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,832
Can I count on you?

139
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,962
Please, buddy, I've never
asked you for anything.

140
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,404
Sure, Roy.
I'll tell her the truth.

141
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,839
Don't get hung up on the truth.

142
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,469
Feel free to smooth out
your old pal's rough edges.

143
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:49,640
I love you, buddy.

144
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,049
Lin. Come.

145
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,124
Sit.

146
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,151
Hello, love.

147
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,621
Fancy a tumble?

148
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,887
Oh!
Where were you two days ago?

149
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,155
I would have bedded you
in a second.

150
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,856
Now you're looking
at a changed man.

151
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,923
I'm sort of saving myself
for someone special.

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,865
I'll give you a discount.

153
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:48,440
That's the most romantic thing
any woman's ever said to me.

154
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,703
You better go.

155
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,904
You better go
before we lose control. Go!

156
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,140
If you change your mind...

157
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,272
Roy!

158
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,057
Lin. Our father would talk about
the right man for you.

159
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,096
He must be strong, courageous...

160
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,724
and a good father.

161
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,166
- Like Roy.
- We got her, Chon.

162
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,998
Not like Roy.

163
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,834
You don't know him like I do.

164
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,806
He has many bad habits.

165
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,002
Such as?

166
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,877
He drinks, smokes, and he gambles.

167
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,539
Chon, where are you going with this?

168
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,549
He sleeps with women for money.

169
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,879
What are you...

170
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,888
Roy don't do that.
I can see inside him.

171
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,355
He has a good heart.

172
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,516
That's right.

173
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,993
His salmon don't swim upstream.

174
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,359
He shoots blanks.

175
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,199
Lin, he cannot be trusted.

176
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,759
How could you say that?
You're his friend.

177
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,306
Yeah, sort of.

178
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,807
Roy is the type of a friend

179
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,207
you'd never introduce
to your other friends

180
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,040
or bring home to your family.

181
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,843
He never speak the truth.
You know what I call him?

182
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,782
Not Roy O'Bannon.
Roy O'Baloney.

183
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,014
I don't care.

184
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,181
Lin, I forbid it.

185
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,249
You are not my father.

186
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,131
Roy, there you are.

187
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,731
- Hi.
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,903
You need anything, buddy?

189
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,073
A whole lot of
"leave me alone."

190
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,982
What's wrong?

191
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,253
Nothing.

192
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,256
I woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

193
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,487
I feel a little pain in my back
like someone put a knife there.

194
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,324
I'm okay.

195
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,227
Don't worry about me.

196
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,338
Roy!

197
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,378
Ta-da!

198
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,713
That actually reminds me of a trick.

199
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,775
You ever seen this one?!

200
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,945
Or this one?!

201
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,684
You think you're so cool
with your karate

202
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,352
and your childlike reflexes.

203
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,161
Roy, you okay?

204
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,958
Look at you.

205
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,935
Do you really call me Roy Baloney?

206
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,765
Roy, you don't understand.

207
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,709
You just smashed my puzzle box.

208
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,838
I'll never figure out my message.

209
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,745
- Roy...
- Go.

210
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,582
You're dead to me.

211
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,053
I don't know a Chon Wang.

212
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,060
What?

213
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,368
Hi, Roy.

214
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,204
Who loves you, baby?

215
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,938
- Nice try, Chon.
- Roy...

216
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,673
I'm sorry.

217
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,753
You do that again,
and you're a dead man.

218
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,591
Pillow fight!

219
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,888
I am Roy Baloney!

220
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,952
Yes!

221
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,020
I'm full of it!

222
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,395
You are!

223
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,421
Roy?

224
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,124
Roy?

225
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,200
Lin!

226
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,074
It was his idea.

227
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,675
- Chon!
- Clothes!

228
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,939
Nice night for a walk.

229
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,688
Lin!

230
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,223
- Lin!
- There you are!

231
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,280
What are you doing?

232
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,020
Don't you know there's
a serial killer on the loose?

233
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,857
Forget it.

234
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,669
Who the hell are these guys?

235
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,671
Boxers.

236
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,173
What do they want with us?

237
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,472
They're with me.

238
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,313
I think we need to have a little chat.

239
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,953
Chon Wang...

240
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,792
the man who can fight an emperor.

241
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,526
The emperor should never have
his burial knife.

242
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,261
I see.

243
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,770
You're still my brother's lapdog.

244
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,669
I'm here not for him.

245
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,565
I'm here for my father.

246
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,508
Of course you are.

247
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:39,209
It was my dagger
that plunged into his heart.

248
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,276
It's still crusted with his blood.

249
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,491
I know the boy has the seal.

250
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,721
Where is he?

251
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,887
We don't know.

252
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,863
That's the truth...
we don't know.

253
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,763
Mmm...

254
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,236
What are you...
What are you doing?

255
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,768
Stop! Put her down!

256
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,368
Put her down!
Put her down!

257
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,208
Or what, Mr. O'Bannon?

258
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,646
Are you gonna kick my ass?

259
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,981
I've read all about
your ridiculous exploits.

260
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,486
I mean, just...

261
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:19,820
how does it feel to kill
a mummy with your bare hands?

262
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,086
Only a nation
of uneducated rednecks

263
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,790
would be amused by such cowboy drivel.

264
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,923
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy.

265
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,263
What's with the personal attacks?

266
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,030
You don't see me
making any comments

267
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,504
about your pasty complexion
or your snotty accent

268
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,599
or even your filthy, smutty sex books.

269
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,667
Yeah, I saw your book.
It disgusted me.

270
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,715
Oh, why is it always the head
with you people?!

271
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,081
Hold it! Stop! Hold it!

272
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,247
Just hold it!

273
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,257
What are we doing here?
Guys, look at this.

274
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,987
We're acting like animals...
over what?

275
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,289
Some seal?

276
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,923
The seal represents imperial power.

277
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,396
I will use it to unite
the emperor's enemies

278
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,438
and storm the Forbidden City.

279
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,938
What's in it for you?

280
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,237
You're looking
at the future king of England.

281
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,209
You're, like, 20th in line to the throne.

282
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,540
10th.

283
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,739
But my friend is about to change all that

284
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:19,182
by simple...
process of elimination.

285
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,414
It's called a machine gun.

286
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,790
The first of its kind...
it fires 200 rounds a minute.

287
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,159
Testament to British ingenuity.

288
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,063
Oh, so you steal the seal,

289
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,226
and then you knock off nine royals?

290
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,564
You got the short end
of that stick, my friend.

291
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,101
Dump them in the river.

292
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,413
Where are you taking her?

293
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,347
To make history.

294
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,612
I can already see the headlines...

295
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:57,850
"Nation mourns as Loony Lin
massacres royal family."

296
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:16,173
I need your assurance
that you will find the seal.

297
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,903
Don't concern yourself.

298
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,968
My men are scouring the city.

299
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:25,107
You better pray they find it...
or our agreement is over,

300
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,553
and you will never get the crown.

301
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:39,028
Chon, I got a confession to make.

302
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:41,293
You are in love with my sister.

303
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,358
Well, that, but...

304
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,165
I didn't lose all the money
on the zeppelins.

305
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,637
No?

306
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:52,006
Nah. I blew most of it
on the Roy O'Bannon novels.

307
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,567
I wrote them.

308
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,204
No, Sage McCallister wrote them.

309
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,478
That's what I'm saying, buddy.
I'm Sage McCallister.

310
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,979
You wrote those lies?!

311
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,957
I've always had low self-esteem.

312
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,493
How many books did you print?

313
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:10,722
I self-published probably a million copies.

314
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,765
We were actually second
to the Bible that year.

315
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,696
Oh, you...

316
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,894
I guess I'm just about
the worst friend

317
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,096
a guy could ask for.

318
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,839
No, you're a good friend.

319
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,001
Thank you.

320
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,478
If you really love Lin,
I won't stand in the way.

321
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:29,639
Really?

322
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:33,913
But if you break her heart...
I'll break your legs.

323
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,146
That's fair.

324
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,880
Well,
friends to the end, Chon...

325
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,620
and this is the end.

326
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,764
Chon, you got a plan?

327
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,323
You wouldn't happen to have
a plan, would you?

328
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,425
Yes.

329
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,299
- Anything I can do?
- No.

330
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,204
Good. I'll let you do
the heavy lifting, then.

331
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,022
Chon, hurry.

332
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,563
Chon!

333
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:19,689
Chon! Chon, hurry!

334
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:20,924
Hurry!

335
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,695
Hurry! Chon, hurry!

336
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,757
Roy!

337
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,105
Coming!

338
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:31,808
Chon!

339
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,134
Oh!

340
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,037
The water's so dirty!

341
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,243
No! No! It's dirty! No!

342
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,413
Just go ahead and drown me.
I don't care anymore.

343
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:14,652
Roy!

344
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,380
You look ridiculous.

345
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,573
I think we look good.

346
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,980
I really must protest
this intrusion.

347
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,185
Every bobby in London is out
scouring the streets

348
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,192
for you two.

349
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,660
Have you been drinking?

350
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:34,096
I always drink when my
employment's been terminated.

351
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,224
They fired you?

352
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,234
Lord Rathbone saw to that.

353
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,291
I'm sorry.

354
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,861
It's of no consequence.

355
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,306
I never wanted to be
an inspector in the first place.

356
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,810
It was my father's idea.

357
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,074
I always wanted to be a writer.

358
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,274
Yeah.

359
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,113
Artie, we need your help.

360
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,743
Rathbone has taken Lin.

361
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,287
He's gonna kill the royal family

362
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:57,788
and he's gonna assume the throne.

363
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,324
Do you have any evidence

364
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,418
to support these
preposterous allegations?

365
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,157
We have this.
It's the boy's.

366
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,995
Use your technique.
Tell us where he is.

367
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,436
Paraffin wax...
most interesting.

368
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,938
He's at a church.

369
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,804
The little punk's hiding
in a church.

370
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,399
No, no, no.

371
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,411
It's not candle wax.

372
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,605
I have it.

373
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,180
- Don't worry. You'll get it.
- What are you doing?

374
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,186
- He's picking the lock.
- Well, hurry up!

375
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,519
Chon, please! Please.
It's a very meticulous process.

376
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,027
Let Artie do his job.
It's almost an art form.

377
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,221
It takes the precision
of a surgeon.

378
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,527
You have to be so precise.

379
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,931
Maybe if we jam
another one in there.

380
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,930
That works, too.

381
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,202
Lacks a certain finesse.

382
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,941
All right, all right.
Let's split up.

383
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,775
What the...

384
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:10,922
I am gonna break your neck.

385
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:11,785
Come here.

386
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:53,830
Looky here.

387
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,026
- Come on, where is it?
- What?

388
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,728
You know
what I'm talking about.

389
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,202
Don't give me that "what."

390
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,235
What do we got here?

391
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,967
Oh, yes.

392
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,407
You don't mind
if I take this back, do you?

393
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,036
Go on.
Get out of here.

394
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,045
Go!

395
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,081
Roy?

396
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,342
I got it.

397
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,114
Give me the seal.

398
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,250
Give me the seal!

399
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,169
All right, spread out!

400
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,399
Through there!

401
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:38,108
Let's go.

402
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,277
The gig's up.

403
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,656
So, what are we gonna do?

404
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,732
Come on, think!

405
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,067
I'm not going
to an English prison.

406
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,006
With my feathery blond hair
and Chon's athletic build,

407
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,009
they'll try to make us
the belle of the ball.

408
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:14,136
Forget it.
I'm not going back.

409
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,677
Well, at least we'll get
a good view of the fireworks

410
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,012
from Scotland Yard.

411
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,983
- Fireworks?
- Yeah.

412
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,488
At midnight, they're launching
this huge display

413
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,319
from a flotilla of barges
on the Thames.

414
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,292
It's the official kickoff
to the Queen's Jubilee.

415
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,261
Is the royal family gonna be there?

416
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,761
They're gonna be viewing
the spectacle from a balcony

417
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,323
overlooking the river.

418
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,369
He's got a machine gun on the barge.

419
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,227
Yes.

420
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,216
You gents lost your way?

421
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,842
Kid, tell me
you got a way out.

422
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:09,059
Nice move, kid.

423
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,533
So why did you come back?

424
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,196
Why did you give up the seal?

425
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,534
'Cause I'm a fool.

426
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,904
Guess I'm a fool, too.

427
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,139
Well, put her there, fool.

428
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,509
I never got your name.

429
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,711
Name's Chaplin...

430
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,811
Charlie Chaplin.

431
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,805
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

432
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:32,975
Excuse me, please!

433
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,882
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

434
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,786
You warn the royal family.

435
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:45,887
I'll save Lin.

436
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,829
How on earth are you gonna do that?

437
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,515
You okay?

438
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:23,991
I just saved you!

439
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,154
You were late!

440
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,219
What?!

441
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,095
Nelson?

442
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,980
Why are you hiding yourself
back there?

443
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:49,282
I shouldn't like to impede
your view, Your Highness.

444
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,219
Nonsense.
You arranged all this.

445
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,154
You should have a front-row view.

446
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,751
I regret that, uh,
respectfully I must decline.

447
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,490
I need to keep a good eye
on proceedings.

448
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,168
Whoo!

449
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,635
Nelson,
you've outdone yourself.

450
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:09,173
Wait till you see the finale.

451
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,136
Hey!

452
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,210
Hey!

453
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:25,546
Oh!

454
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:31,850
This is hopeless.

455
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,857
We're not gonna get past the guards.

456
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,517
Well, not with that attitude we won't.

457
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,493
Come on, Artie.
There's got to be a way.

458
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,553
There's always...

459
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,309
Lin!

460
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,545
Yee-haw! Yeah!

461
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,312
Yee-haw!

462
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:35,784
Yee-haw!

463
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,480
We got to jump it!

464
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,303
Wu Chow!

465
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,194
Hold it right there,
Rathboner.

466
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,522
I'm guessing
by your hasty retreat

467
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,034
that you're still
20th in line for the throne.

468
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,330
10th.

469
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:01,736
Inspector Doyle, arrest this man.

470
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,432
He's got a gun!

471
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,103
Oh!

472
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,369
Come on!

473
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:13,709
- Oh!
- You okay?

474
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,047
What happened?

475
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,519
Rathbone nailed Artie
with a little sissy gun.

476
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,887
I'll look after him.
You two go.

477
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,720
Go!

478
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,158
For Father.

479
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,135
For Father.

480
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,933
For Old Man Wang.

481
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,235
Oh, my lucky playing cards.

482
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,482
Be careful.

483
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,390
Tell Rathbone to be careful.

484
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,428
Roy, let's go.

485
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,395
You're gonna need a bigger gun!

486
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:25,687
You see him?

487
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,156
No.

488
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,125
Show your face, Rathbone!

489
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,626
I'm gonna tear this guy apart.

490
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,095
Roy, you go this way.
I'll go that way.

491
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,826
Split up? I don't know
if that's a good idea.

492
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,060
It's okay.

493
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,242
He's not up here.

494
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,575
Roy, keep going.

495
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,244
Aw, come on, Roy.

496
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,532
Hey, uh, Rathbone...

497
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,868
I was just thinking
of a title for my new book...

498
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,637
"Roy O'Bannon vs. Little Lord Sissy."

499
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:23,339
But what about "Roy O'Bannon vs.
The Man Who Would Be Queen"?

500
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:27,980
No sign of him, Chon.

501
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,213
The coast is clear up here.

502
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,417
Roy! Look out!

503
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,055
Roy!

504
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,394
Oops.

505
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:47,836
Come on up.

506
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,032
I'll show you how your father died.

507
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,307
Lord, help me.

508
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,977
Just let me know you're there.
Love me. Hate me.

509
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,316
But let me know you're up there!

510
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,652
Hey, I can see our hotel from here.

511
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:40,816
Wow.

512
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,501
Come along.

513
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,302
I'm waiting.

514
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,606
Come on, Roy. Okay.

515
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,771
Roy O'Bannon will not go quietly.

516
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,178
You hear that, England?!

517
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,011
Throw whatever you want at me...

518
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,018
your terrible weather,
your perverted killers,

519
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,054
your Spotted Dick!

520
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,517
Roy, you're about to die.

521
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:52,062
You're on the minute hand of a clock.

522
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,656
My life is flashing before my eyes.

523
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,725
Wait a minute.
I don't remember her.

524
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,317
One more.

525
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:31,694
One more.

526
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,521
Oh!

527
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,856
How disappointing.

528
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,059
One more.

529
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,282
You killed my friend.

530
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:28,883
You killed my father!

531
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,739
Roy!

532
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:53,249
I thought you were dead!
Oh!

533
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,808
You think some tea-drinking psycho

534
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,854
can take out Roy O'Bannon?

535
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,492
Whoa.

536
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:12,559
Easy there, cowboy.

537
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,000
Huh?

538
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,450
You got any ideas?

539
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,017
Huh?

540
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:43,626
- We jump!
- Jump?!

541
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,534
You mean fall?!

542
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,367
Aim for the flag!

543
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,031
Aw, shit.

544
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,037
I got to tell you something.

545
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,202
What?

546
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,179
You're the best sidekick
I could ever ask for.

547
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:00,411
Thank you, Roy.
I feel the same about you.

548
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,014
On three.

549
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:04,247
One...

550
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,686
Two...

551
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:06,484
- Three!
- Three!

552
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,850
Roy. Roy!

553
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:39,912
Howdy.

554
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,689
In recognition of outstanding bravery,

555
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:49,927
I dub you Sir Chon Wang.

556
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,373
For uncommon valor,

557
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:00,877
I dub you Sir Roy O'Bannon.

558
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:10,049
And for steadfast dedication to justice,

559
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:13,318
I dub you Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

560
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,426
Arise.

561
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,578
Who loves you, baby?

562
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,658
Madam.

563
00:48:58,202 --> 00:49:01,137
Artie, I bet Scotland Yard's
dying to get you back now.

564
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:03,400
My official
crime-fighting days are over.

565
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:04,600
The queen has asked me

566
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,973
to accompany the Imperial Seal
back to China.

567
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:08,477
What a week.
Unbelievable.

568
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,480
She couldn't have picked
a better man, right, Chon?

569
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:11,606
Yeah.

570
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,674
And the voyage is gonna give me
time to work on my new novel.

571
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:16,982
It features a new kind of detective,

572
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:20,023
and he's gonna solve crimes
using deductive reasoning.

573
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,682
Give me a name.
What's his name?

574
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,249
Actually, Roy,
I was rather hoping

575
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,989
to call him Sherlock Holmes,
if that's all right with you.

576
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:30,091
I'd be insulted if you didn't use it.

577
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,240
- Ta.
- See you, Artie.

578
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:42,576
That was very nice of you, Roy.

579
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,944
I would've kept the name
if I thought it was any good.

580
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,607
It's a horrible name
for a detective...

581
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:48,845
Sherlock Holmes. Holmes?

582
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,285
Will you stop playing with that?
I'm gonna smash it.

583
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:53,584
I just want to see it for a second.

584
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,682
- Just let me see it.
- No, you're gonna break it.

585
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,795
It's just a rock
with some gibberish on it.

586
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:01,353
That's Chinese.

587
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:05,293
"Family is forever, my son.

588
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,202
I'm proud
you cast your own stone."

589
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,532
Wow.

590
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,166
That's a good message.

591
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,380
I'd like to cast my own stone, Chon.

592
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:30,993
- Hi.
- Hi.

593
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:39,294
I told you... the house
of O'Bannon will prevail.

594
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,370
Chon, I got a business
proposition for you.

595
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,307
No more zeppelins.

596
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,177
No, no, this is much better
than zeppelins...

597
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,079
a new thing they're starting
out in California

598
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,583
called moving pictures.

599
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:55,641
Pass.

600
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,277
Hold it. Hold it.
Hear me out.

601
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,720
I really think these movies
could play to your strength.

602
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:00,722
There's no sound,

603
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,884
so we don't have to worry
about the language problem.

604
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,726
And I think the kung fu stuff
could be huge.

605
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,958
People are dying
for a good action picture.

606
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:10,625
What do you think?

607
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,636
Chon Wang, movie star?

608
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,137
It could work.

609
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:18,470
I feel bad about ditching
that Chaplin kid,

610
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,908
but we're gonna be running
and gunning in Hollywood,

611
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,445
and he'd just cramp our style.

612
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,641
It's such a tough town.

613
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:44,133
Bloody tourists!

614
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,700
Action!

615
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,184
You have to say "cut."

616
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,615
You just keep looking!

617
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,055
Ouch.

618
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,492
Come here, you little minx.

619
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:18,796
Cut.

620
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,302
That was good.

621
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:22,031
That was a good one, huh?

622
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:27,069
Maybe on this one
I should lick you... you think?

623
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,204
Like, after you lick me...
that could be kind of good.

624
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,077
And, Jackie...

625
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,275
Jackie?

626
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,215
Thank you. Hi, Owen.

627
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,411
Hello. How are you?

628
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,921
Okay, and I'm not
Roy O'Bannon.

629
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,115
Who are you?

630
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,589
Damn it, Chon,
I think she's the one.

631
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,254
I know it's crazy.
We just met, but she's the one.

632
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,163
No, Roy,
she's my babysitter.

633
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,927
Your babys...

634
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,595
What?

635
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,104
Baby what?

636
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,333
Baby sister.

637
00:52:57,408 --> 00:52:58,932
Baby sister?

638
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,273
Not babysitter.
Baby sister.

639
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,117
You okay?

640
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:17,783
Action!

641
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,221
What happened?

642
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,927
Roy is the type of a friend
you never introduce

643
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:27,732
to your other friends
or bring into your family.

644
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:31,400
He's... Look at his eyes.
They're brown... full of shit.

645
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:33,238
Always...

646
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,244
Just bullshit all the time.

647
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,870
Yeah, have you ever heard of those?

648
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,414
They're parents.
We have parents that love us.

649
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:41,917
You don't,
'cause you're a little orphan.

650
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:46,915
You don't...
We've got par... Yeah, parents.

651
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,424
Have you ever heard of those?
We've got parents that love us.

652
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:52,257
But you don't,
'cause you're a little orphan.

653
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:55,397
Oh, go on.

654
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,801
So mean.

655
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:02,100
Chon Wang, movie star?

656
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,434
It could work.

657
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:06,271
It could work.
You could do your own stunts.

658
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,106
What? My own stunts?

659
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,282
Ow!

660
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:15,879
Whoa! Whoa!

661
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:20,618
Stay here and be a good horsey
for the new sheriff.

662
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,817
Ouch! Oh!

663
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,623
Ow. That hurt.

664
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:29,894
Ow! Ooh!

665
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:34,330
Ow!

666
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:37,739
Oh!

667
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,472
You're supposed to catch me!

668
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:44,707
Roy, catch.

669
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,150
- Jesus.
- That's my fault.

670
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,623
Wait a second.

671
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:58,126
This nut is killing
your street women?

672
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,292
Who did that?

673
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:05,357
Jackie Chan.

674
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,424
Me?

675
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:07,765
That's right.

676
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,167
- That was the...
- First time.

677
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,175
- The best take.
- I'm sorry.

678
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:14,540
Hurry up!

679
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,272
Are you crazy?!
I can't do that!

680
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,780
This isn't Chinatown!
I can't sail through the air!

681
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,783
- I'm not gonna break my neck!
- Roy!

682
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,146
What in our history together

683
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,710
makes you think I'm capable
of something like that?

684
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:25,720
It's getting bigger!

685
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:26,881
There's got to be
a better way.

686
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:27,787
Roy!

687
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:30,290
Roy!

688
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,952
My ass is on fire.
