1
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,616
Boxers!

2
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,060
Not one step further.

3
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,503
The keeper
of the Imperial Seal.

4
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,097
Just the man I was looking for.

5
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,335
A woman.

6
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,745
You Chinese are very progressive.

7
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,353
A gift from an old friend.

8
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,146
Wu Chow.

9
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,686
He wanted me to send his regards.

10
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,525
Father!

11
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,614
Father.

12
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:07,091
The seal.
You must get it back.

13
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,485
I promise.

14
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:15,364
Give this... to your brother.

15
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,057
What are you reading?

16
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,764
Oh.
"Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy."

17
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,066
It's incredible.

18
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,232
Roy's just taken out
the Mummy's entire army

19
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,835
of zombie confederate soldiers,
and he only had one bullet.

20
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,572
That's impossible.

21
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,908
Oh, no, it's not.

22
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,643
Oh, I see! Roy figured out
the physics of the canyon

23
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,185
and then ricocheted a bullet
off the canyon wall.

24
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,244
Nailed each zombie through the heart.

25
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,616
What about the Shanghai Kid?

26
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,420
He was captured
and knocked out on page 10

27
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,154
while he was polishing
Roy's pearl handles.

28
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,320
Don't you worry.

29
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,455
Roy's about to save him from
becoming a human sacrifice.

30
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,330
Those stories are all lies.

31
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,459
No. See?

32
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,798
It says right here on the back.

33
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,034
"Author Sage McCallister bases
all his stories

34
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,938
on firsthand accounts."

35
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,365
Sorry, sheriff.
No princess.

36
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,634
Every day you meet
the noon stage.

37
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,140
Every day it's the same story.

38
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,006
She's not coming back.

39
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,240
Pei Pei's married to her work
in San Francisco.

40
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,747
Modern woman.

41
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,079
Sheriff, you got a parcel.

42
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,317
Hey, maybe it's from her!

43
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,856
No. It's from my sister in China.

44
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,641
I know.

45
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,345
I know.
I must go.

46
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,816
Stay here and be a good horsey
for the new sheriff.

47
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:28,423
Uh, sheriff,
that stage is headed east.

48
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,156
Isn't China kind of west of here?

49
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,926
I'm not going to China.
I'm going to New York.

50
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,433
Roy invested my money.

51
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,131
Is it true that he lives in a
penthouse at the top of the Ritz

52
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,896
surrounded by dozens
of beautiful women

53
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,565
at his every beck and call?

54
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,109
That's the old Roy.

55
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,440
He's married, settled down.

56
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,310
Trust me, he's changed.

57
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,478
So there we were.
Completely outnumbered.

58
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,316
He didn't have to tell me
we didn't stand a chance.

59
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,654
So I send the Shanghai Kid
and the princess out the back.

60
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,285
Poor Shanghai Kid.
He was so frightened.

61
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,659
He forgot to thank me
for saving his life.

62
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,487
I'm used to that.

63
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,467
Now, I returned to the front,
and I counted to three...

64
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,663
and I burst out of the mission.

65
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:16,640
Pearl handles blazing.
Lead flying everywhere.

66
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,700
And not a single bullet touched me.

67
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,106
- No!
- Yeah.

68
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,341
What happened
to the emperor's gold?

69
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,678
Well, we divided it up.

70
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,844
I insisted on giving my share
to the Indians.

71
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,081
The savages?

72
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,853
Please don't ever call
those noble people savages.

73
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,154
If being proud of your body

74
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,661
and wanting to ride around naked
all day makes you a savage,

75
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,699
then, by God,
you're drinking with a savage.

76
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,447
And that is what you call
a French toast.

77
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:01,145
You are so sophisticated,
Mr. O'Bannon.

78
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,188
Whoo!

79
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:06,452
Who's up for some more bubbly?

80
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,468
Reach for the sky, Roy.

81
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,704
Say that again.

82
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,936
Reach for the sky, Roy.

83
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,570
Chon Wang!

84
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,443
You sly son of a gun!

85
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,483
- Look at you!
- Look at you!

86
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,678
- What brings you to New York?
- My share of the gold.

87
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,018
Refresh my memory.
What gold are we talking about?

88
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,216
The emperor's gold.

89
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,816
Okay, now, that gold is in

90
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,692
what the Wall Street pros call
a long-term investment.

91
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,698
We can't touch it right now
because it's building.

92
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,755
I need it tonight.

93
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,767
You just got here.
Let's celebrate a little bit.

94
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:50,767
No. I don't have time.

95
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,203
- You just got to the big city.
- My father's been killed.

96
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,775
Chon, I'm...

97
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,779
You need the money to get back
for the funeral?

98
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,112
No. I must go to England.
The ship leaves tonight.

99
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,674
Wait. Your father died in England?

100
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,482
China. My sister followed
the murderer to London.

101
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:13,116
Wait. Murderer.
I'm a little bit mixed up.

102
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,183
Let me see if I can get
the facts straight.

103
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,355
You have a sister? You never
told me you had a sister.

104
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,796
Is she pretty or does she look
like you? Be honest.

105
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,198
Roy, I need my money!

106
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,203
I don't like
that tone of voice.

107
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,331
You think after all we've been
through I'd stiff you?

108
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,500
I'm doing pretty well
for myself.

109
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,168
Yeah.

110
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,213
- I'm sorry, Roy.
- That's okay.

111
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,306
You're going through
a really tough time right now.

112
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,578
You got to be more trusting
of people, okay?

113
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,381
Look at me.
It's Roy.

114
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,580
The couple at table 5
is ready to order.

115
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,984
Do you work here?

116
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,323
No, I don't work here.

117
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,830
It looks like these guys
are wearing a similar jacket.

118
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,366
Roy, here's your cut of the tips.

119
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,734
It's the craziest thing.

120
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,469
I guess because
I come in here so much

121
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,976
they're mistaking me
for a waiter.

122
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,673
- It's embarrassing.
- You lost the gold.

123
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,107
- Not all of it.
- Where's the rest?

124
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,052
I have one word for you.
Zeppelin.

125
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,850
I need my money now!

126
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,720
Easy, easy.

127
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,017
Will you do anything for this money?

128
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,960
Yes.
I must leave tonight.

129
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,827
Okay.
Take this key.

130
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,799
Go to the room.
Get cleaned up.

131
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,426
Your old pal Roy's got a plan.

132
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,663
Go! Come on!

133
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,383
Howdy, big boy.

134
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:02,766
What?

135
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,531
There's a woman in there!
She wants me to sleep with her.

136
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,662
Of course she does.

137
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,934
I told her the Great Wall
ain't the only big thing

138
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:09,975
coming out of China.

139
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,602
- Why did you say that?
- So you could get the money.

140
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,771
I will not sleep with women
for money!

141
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:15,779
Why?

142
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,009
I'm gonna sleep with her
for money.

143
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,347
Chon, just go in there
and do your business

144
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,513
and think about your sister
in England.

145
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,022
- What?
- Roy!

146
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,921
- Duty calls.
- Roy!

147
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,464
Good evening, Mr. Mayor.

148
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,864
Where are they?

149
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,095
Who?

150
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,870
My daughters.

151
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,065
10th floor.

152
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,581
Roy?
Roy, you got trouble.

153
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,241
Roy!

154
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,843
I got to check on something.
I'll be right back.

155
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,881
Chon, new plan.
We got to go.

156
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,720
Chon, what are you doing?!

157
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,056
I'm fixing her back.

158
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,595
Put her down,
you decadent Philistine.

159
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,057
Hey, Chon, come on!
Let's go!

160
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,326
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

161
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,268
Come on!

162
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,070
I don't understand.
What's going on?

163
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,404
I don't have time to explain.

164
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,968
All you have to know is there
are bad men after us...

165
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,445
but I'm in the right.

166
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:26,951
- Roy.
- Chon, c'mon. You gotta trust me on this.

167
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,111
Okay, look.

168
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,088
I'm in a transitional phase
in my life right now.

169
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,646
- But...
- But what?

170
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,127
You want to know the truth?

171
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,186
I'm a little lost right now.

172
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,288
I see you.
You've got a sense of purpose.

173
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:44,132
But look at me.
I'm a 30-year-old waiter/gigolo.

174
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,535
Where's the future in that?

175
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,069
So what's the plan?

176
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,010
You were always my compass, Chon.

177
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,344
The plan.
You ask me the right questions.

178
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,383
The plan?

179
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,180
The plan, I think,
is to find the right woman.

180
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,687
Raise a lot of children
and teach them values.

181
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,520
No, Roy.
The plan to get out of here.

182
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,355
Okay, the plan.
Here we go.

183
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,399
- Cops! Cops!
- They can help us.

184
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,771
No, no.
Chon, not these cops.

185
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,811
These are dirty cops.
They take advantage of people.

186
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:31,339
Now, if they stop us, remember,
I'm not Roy O'Bannon.

187
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,850
Who are you?

188
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:36,217
I'm your friend Smoky Desperado
from the West.

189
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,550
And who am I?

190
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,682
You. You're Benihana.

191
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,885
- Benihana.
- Yeah.

192
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,487
You teach crippled children yoga
here in the city.

193
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,556
- You go first.
- No! Why me?

194
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,068
Because you blend in, okay?

195
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,071
Now, go!
Don't let them see you!

196
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,900
Benihana.

197
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,087
Hey! Hey!

198
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,727
Ooh.

199
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,585
Psst! Chon!

200
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,183
Come on.
Stop wasting time.

201
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:27,797
You!

202
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,096
Chon, I found our ticket
out of here.

203
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,001
We're on our way.

204
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,198
Looks like old Roy
came through again.

205
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,265
Just like old times, Chon.

206
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,071
Check over there!

207
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,204
- Over to the alley!
- That way!

208
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,318
Yeah, just like old times.

209
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,116
Will you forget about the gold
for a second?

210
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,918
You're gonna have more money
than you ever dreamed of

211
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,753
when that first zeppelin takes off.

212
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,919
Why do I always believe you?

213
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,792
What do you mean?

214
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,388
You're lucky I didn't invest

215
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,457
in that ridiculous automobile idea.

216
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,366
Yeah, that's gonna make
a lot of money.

217
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,761
What's that?

218
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,390
Doghouse.
I'm in the doghouse.

219
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,063
Oh, come on, Chon.

220
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,103
Look, I'm sorry I lied.

221
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,662
I just didn't want to disappoint you.

222
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,067
That's exactly what I mean.

223
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,735
I can't take that look.

224
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,474
I learned it from my father.

225
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,709
That's how he used to look at me.

226
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,546
What did your dad do?
Was he an Imperial Guard?

227
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,645
No.

228
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,589
Much more important.

229
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,159
He was the keeper
of the Imperial Seal.

230
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,684
That's what I love about China.

231
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,560
Everybody's job description
sounds so damn cool.

232
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,658
The seal has been symbol
of the emperor's power

233
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,929
since Genghis Khan.

234
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,302
It has been passed down
from one emperor to another.

235
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,900
My family have been watching
over it for 12 generations.

236
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,534
12 generations?

237
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,676
My father and I used to
skip stones across the moat

238
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,981
and talk about a day
I would follow his footsteps.

239
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,456
I was his only son.

240
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:36,119
If I'd have been there,
I could have protected him.

241
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,594
It's not your fault.
You were 3,000 miles away.

242
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,629
What's with that little box?

243
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:48,471
My sister sent it to me
from my father.

244
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,270
- There's a message inside.
- What's it say?

245
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,073
It's a puzzle box.
I don't know how to open yet.

246
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,078
What do you mean?

247
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,707
Get a hammer and smash it open
so you can see what it says.

248
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,013
I must have patience.

249
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,417
By the time
I'm able to open it...

250
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,886
I will be ready to read
the message.

251
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,149
Come on, Confucius.

252
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,453
That's the corniest thing
I've ever heard.

253
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,360
Let me see this.

254
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,924
You know what?

255
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,936
We're gonna go to England.

256
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,471
We're gonna find your dad's killer.

257
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,029
We're gonna get that seal back.

258
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,597
There's no reward for this, Roy.

259
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,903
Who said anything
about a reward?

260
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,468
I'm talking about friendship,
loyalty, honor.

261
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,037
Okay?

262
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,483
Thank you, Roy.

263
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,312
And I hear England is ass soup.

264
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,619
A lot of pretty girls there.

265
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,466
First order of business,
my Lords...

266
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,339
is a report from our esteemed
friend Lord Rathbone...

267
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:03,370
who recently returned from
a diplomatic mission to China.

268
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,251
Fellow Lords...

269
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:20,162
I'm afraid I bring disturbing
news from the Orient.

270
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,027
The opium wars have ravaged the land.

271
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,501
The emperor's enemies
are organizing.

272
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,164
The most vicious are the Boxers.

273
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,233
A godless band of rebels
who murder without discretion.

274
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,010
China is not well.

275
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:41,743
I have brought back an envoy
who should give us some insight

276
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,381
into the inscrutable mind
of the Chinese.

277
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,293
Is he mad?

278
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,298
Given to Her Majesty
Queen Victoria by the emperor

279
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:58,200
in recognition of her
50 glorious years on the throne.

280
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,666
Outrageousness!

281
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,770
Long live the queen.

282
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,431
Jack the Ripper strikes again!

283
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,232
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it.

284
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,966
Howdy, partner.

285
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,034
The English are not very friendly.

286
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,600
They're just sore losers.

287
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,146
What did they lose?

288
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,650
A little thing called
the American Revolution, Chon.

289
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:46,684
Never heard of it.

290
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,116
I'll give you the highlights.

291
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,086
They came over
with about a million men.

292
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,123
We had a bunch of farmers
with pitchforks

293
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,283
and beat 'em like a drum.

294
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,560
Hey! I'm walking here!

295
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,998
You're driving on the wrong side
of the road!

296
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,765
Bunch of amateurs.
These people don't get it.

297
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,601
Hello, ladies.

298
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,469
Look at you.

299
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,809
What? I'm not supposed to
notice a pretty lady?

300
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,349
I thought you wanted to
settle down and have a family.

301
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,715
I do, Chon.
I just hope I can.

302
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:22,844
Why not?

303
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,516
Sometimes I worry that
all the damn horseback riding

304
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,888
I did out in the West,

305
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:31,952
bouncing up and down on the
hard saddles might have made it

306
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,399
so my salmon don't swim upstream
the way they're supposed to.

307
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,526
What?

308
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,765
I might be shooting blanks.

309
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,863
Oh.

310
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,067
Don't say anything.

311
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:48,178
Roy, it's okay.

312
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,806
Some people are not meant
to have a family.

313
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,680
I've always had such a special
connection with children.

314
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,049
The little ankle biters.

315
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,213
Hey, watch it, you little punk!

316
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,120
Pardon me, guv.

317
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,895
You gents lost your way?

318
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,431
Yeah. We're looking for my sister.

319
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,263
She's staying at 32 Oxford Street.

320
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,498
I know it well, guv.
Me old man used to live there.

321
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,564
Can you show us the way?

322
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,634
Well, memory's a little dodgy.

323
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,146
But I'm sure for a bob
I could get you there.

324
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,944
What do you take us for?
Okies from Muskogee?

325
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,076
Go sell your bullshit
someplace else.

326
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,121
We're not buying.

327
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,849
Thanks for the tip, guv.

328
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,187
Hey! I stole that watch from my uncle!

329
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,521
What?

330
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:56,905
This way.

331
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,080
Come here,
you little rubbish eater!

332
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:06,282
What did I tell you about
poaching on our turf, Charlie?

333
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,485
I'm on the straight
and narrow. Honest.

334
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,831
What's this, then?

335
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,299
After I'm through beating you...

336
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,304
you're gonna wish you never
ran away from the workhouse!

337
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,964
Leave the boy alone.

338
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,909
Bloody tourists!
Get your noses out of it!

339
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,774
Do whatever you want to the kid...

340
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,541
but that's my watch you're holding.

341
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:34,074
Well, there's a load of us
and only two of you.

342
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,949
So piss off!

343
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,285
Easy, fellas.
You've lost one war this way.

344
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,256
Don't make the same mistake twice.

345
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,275
Come on!
After him!

346
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,843
Hey!

347
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,620
There he is!
Get him!

348
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,319
We've got him now.
Move in, lads.

349
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,584
Boys, boys, wait, wait!

350
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,294
Come on! Get him!

351
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,387
Up the bloody ladder!

352
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,426
Hey! Hey!

353
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,858
Oh! Watch it!

354
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,200
Hey.

355
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,236
Ah!

356
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,368
Come here, you!

357
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,529
Cool.

358
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,552
Move it!

359
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:40,991
You!

360
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,910
Did you see that?

361
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,607
It's okay.

362
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,773
Okay?!

363
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,511
I call that one
my kung pao chicken.

364
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,314
I clotheslined the sucker.

365
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,481
Come on, get back!

366
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,786
Clear away!

367
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,588
Make way!

368
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:25,706
I think you gentlemen should
accompany me back to the yard.

369
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,371
This isn't a yard!
It's a jail!

370
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,777
Roy, calm down.

371
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,343
Unbelievable.

372
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,417
Wait!
Someone's coming!

373
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,547
- Let me handle this.
- I'm gonna handle it, ok?

374
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,091
The English aren't like you.

375
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,354
They don't get all emotional.
Touchy-feely.

376
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,520
Do me a favor.

377
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,063
Park the kung fu.
Let me do the talking.

378
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:52,166
Come here.
Let me give you a hug.

379
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,670
Ooh!

380
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:58,231
I've been after that
Fleet Street gang for two years.

381
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,277
Then you two come along
and bring them down

382
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,210
in a single afternoon.
Brilliant!

383
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,907
Now, um...

384
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,313
Oh, that's my watch!

385
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,078
Yes. A street urchin turned it in.

386
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,210
The little punk better not
have scuffed it.

387
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,313
- I do hope your luck picks up.
- What do you mean "my luck"?

388
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,416
I deduced from your watch
that you'd hit a rough patch.

389
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,154
He has.
How do you know?

390
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,788
It's an investigative technique
I've developed.

391
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:23,129
I can deduce intimate details
about an individual

392
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:26,693
through a close scrutiny
of their personal effects.

393
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,602
What else can you tell?

394
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:34,539
The owner of this watch
is a bad gambler

395
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,045
and a lousy shot.

396
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,810
Although he's cheated death
several times...

397
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:42,410
he spends most of his life
wandering in a rather pathetic

398
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,354
and futile search
for purpose and respect.

399
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,555
Oh, yes.

400
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,617
He has a penchant for loose women.

401
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,521
Wow. That's amazing.

402
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,590
I'm sure it's a very popular
party trick

403
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,464
at birthdays for small children...

404
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,470
but it doesn't quite play
with adults.

405
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,030
Just to set the record straight.

406
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,769
Roy O'Bannon is not attracted
to loose women.

407
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,572
Loose women
are attracted to me.

408
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,772
- You're Roy O'Bannon?
- Yeah.

409
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,815
The famous Western folk hero?

410
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,043
Have you heard of me?

411
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,448
Have I heard of you?

412
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,886
I've only read "Roy O'Bannon
vs. The Mummy" five times.

413
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,183
It's fascinating.

414
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,986
I want you to meet the Shanghai Kid.

415
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,083
Oh, yes.

416
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,754
The faithful Chinese sidekick.

417
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:28,356
I'm not a sidekick.
Those stories are all lies.

418
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,333
Hey! Come on, don't be bitter.

419
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,892
I can't help what
Sage McCallister writes.

420
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,736
If there's anything I can do,
I'm at your service.

421
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,777
We're looking for my sister.
She's staying at this address.

422
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,779
Can you take us there?

423
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,781
Oh, dear.

424
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,317
I think you'd better come with me.

425
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,235
Lin.

426
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,810
Wang.

427
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:27,581
If you don't mind,
I'll just wait outside.

428
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,462
Introduce me.

429
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,657
Oh.
This is Lin, my baby sister.

430
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,127
Roy O'Bannon.

431
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,869
Pleasure.

432
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,333
You never told me your sister
was such a...

433
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,468
beautiful lotus blossom.

434
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:54,943
What'd she say?

435
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,283
No, no, no.

436
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,414
No talking about me
in your native tongue.

437
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,857
Why are you in jail?

438
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,757
I followed the man
who murdered Father.

439
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,056
And?

440
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,653
I found out where he live.

441
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:09,598
I snuck inside his house
and tried to kill him.

442
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,692
It's my duty to find
Father's killer.

443
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,431
No, it is mine!
I'm the one who promised Father.

444
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,870
But I'm his only son.

445
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,306
When you abandoned us
for America...

446
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,037
Father said he had no son.

447
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,510
What?

448
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,345
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Time out.

449
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,043
Time out. Time out.
Come here.

450
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,642
The detective's a fan.

451
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,584
Why don't I play
the celebrity card?

452
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,316
We'll get her out that way.

453
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,620
- Okay?
- Okay.

454
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,422
Don't worry.
I'll get you out.

455
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,827
Everything's gonna be okay.

456
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:50,135
In fact, I'm gonna give you
my good-luck playing cards.

457
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,341
Just ignore the naked ladies.

458
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,137
Wang!

459
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,076
Have you opened Father's box?

460
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,776
Not yet.

461
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,487
She tried to assassinate Lord Rathbone

462
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,962
whilst he was taking afternoon tea.

463
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,158
He's 10th in line to the throne...

464
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,168
Her Majesty's favorite cousin...

465
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,397
and the finest swordsman in England.

466
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,468
So, of course,
the press had a field day.

467
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,706
The story actually knocked Jack
the Ripper off the front page.

468
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,576
Artie, Lin is not a killer.

469
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,481
She's just a really, really, really hot...

470
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,451
confused Chinese girl.

471
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,784
Maybe if I agreed to sign
a few autographs

472
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,915
and talk to some of my fans
here in England...

473
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,519
do some type of charity event,
can we get her out that way?

474
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,529
I'm afraid
that's out of the question.

475
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,030
What will happen to my sister?

476
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,829
She'll go to trial,
probably be locked away

477
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,699
in an institution
for the criminally insane.

478
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,467
The tabloids have already
dubbed her "Loony Lin."

479
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,531
I thought it was rather catchy.

480
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,336
At the time.

481
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,226
Do you have any notion
what would happen

482
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,664
if we were to be seen together?

483
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:26,567
Since your return, I have yet to
lay eyes on the Imperial Seal.

484
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,902
I'm hosting a jubilee ball
at my country estate tomorrow.

485
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,340
Be at the stables at midnight.

486
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:36,606
As requested,
a token of my esteem.

487
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,322
This is where you get out.

488
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,085
I hope there will be
more trust between us

489
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,256
when I'm emperor
and you are the new king.

490
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,799
Wow. Buckingham Palace.
Look at that, Chon.

491
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,037
That's where the queen lives.

492
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,274
Hey, look at this guy.

493
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,113
He's a royal guard.
He has a very important job.

494
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,413
I used to be just like him.

495
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,113
No, they're nothing like you.

496
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,780
They're a tourist attraction.

497
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,847
You can make faces at them,
insult them...

498
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,187
and they can't move a muscle.

499
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,749
- Here. Watch this.
- Roy...

500
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,125
No, it's okay.

501
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,687
Hey, buddy,
your shoes are untied.

502
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:34,535
That is the biggest damn beaver
I have ever seen.

503
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,601
Roy, stop it.

504
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:37,606
The queen!

505
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,642
Look! The queen!

506
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,439
She's mooning us!

507
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,139
He almost went for that.

508
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,409
My friend and I just came over
from America.

509
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:48,179
You might have heard of it.
We run your jerkwater country.

510
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,415
Come on, you gonna take that
from a colonial?

511
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,547
Roy, stop it.

512
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,717
I bet you are one hell
of a damn poker player.

513
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:56,987
No hard feelings.

514
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,426
Huh?

515
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,424
They can't do that!

516
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,832
You're not allowed to do that!

517
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,960
Shouldn't have touched him.

518
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,061
You scram, you little punk.

519
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,663
I've got friends at Scotland Yard.

520
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,173
I'll give you up in a heartbeat.

521
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,732
You get your watch back?

522
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,244
Don't worry about my watch.
Go on.

523
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,472
It's a knockoff, you know.

524
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,980
What are you talking about?

525
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,812
My uncle stole this watch
from President Lincoln.

526
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,853
It's a priceless family heirloom.

527
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,945
Not according to the pawnbroker.

528
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,421
You should not steal.

529
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,685
If I don't steal, I don't eat.

530
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,786
Who showed you how to do
all that kicking and punching?

531
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,694
My father.

532
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,825
Have you ever heard of those?
They're parents.

533
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,733
You don't 'cause you're
a little orphan.

534
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:43,331
Now, go on.
You're cramping our style.

535
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,871
Oh, this country blows.

536
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,039
You need a place to stay?

537
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,619
Come on in and warm your dogs.

538
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,485
You can get into a lot of trouble

539
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,387
breaking into a place like this.

540
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,188
That being said, well done.

541
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,366
You just ate the last chocolate.

542
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:11,560
Course I did.

543
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,660
You gotta look out for number one.

544
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,365
I could really get used to this.

545
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,840
Living the life
of a country gentleman.

546
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,809
Maybe doing a little painting.

547
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,676
Let Lin play in the garden
with the children.

548
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:26,181
Vera, Chuck, and Dave.

549
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,683
Who's Lin?

550
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:31,380
Lin's the most beautiful woman
I've ever met.

551
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,652
She's gonna be the savior
of the house of O'Bannon.

552
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,523
Chon, check out the threads.

553
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,496
All I'm missing is the
loyal hound curled at my feet.

554
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,998
We are wasting time.
We must find Rathbone.

555
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,364
What do you think I've been doing?

556
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,426
Sitting here drinking expensive hooch?

557
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,493
Refill.

558
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,869
I've been working on a plan.

559
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,172
Now... Whoa.
Don't slosh the brandy.

560
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,611
- It messes with the bouquet.
- Sod off.

561
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,671
Listen, I'm trying to teach you
a skill set.

562
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,306
Help get you off the street.

563
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,342
- Bartenders make big bucks.
- Roy!

564
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,114
The plan.

565
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,917
Thank you, Chon.

566
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,151
Now I figure. If we find the seal...

567
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,251
we can prove Rathbone
killed your dad.

568
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,126
It's the old Hail Mary play.

569
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,498
I also have a version
where we dig a tunnel.

570
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:21,570
Hey!

571
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,834
Bloody catapult.
Jesus Christ!

572
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,138
- You don't need a catapult!
- Who asked you?

573
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,303
You don't interrupt grown-ups
when they're talking.

574
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,280
"Lord Nelson Rathbone requests
the pleasure of your company

575
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:32,440
at the jubilee ball

576
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:36,316
in honor of Her Majesty's
50th year on the throne."

577
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,820
Sounds good.

578
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,856
It doesn't address the issue of security.

579
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,585
They're not exactly gonna let
Chon and I

580
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,092
waltz into the castle.

581
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,628
All you need is a proper disguise.

582
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,992
I do like a good disguise.

583
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:15,915
I look like a fool.

584
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,894
What?! You're a maharaja.
That's Indian royalty.

585
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:22,160
- But I'm Chinese.
- It's the same thing.

586
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,325
Bob your head a little bit.

587
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,131
Gives you more
of a India-royalty flavor.

588
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:30,173
That's good.
Good show, good show.

589
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,434
Good show, good show.

590
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,033
- Cheerio, cheerio.
- Cheerio, cheerio.

591
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,840
What do we do
when we see Rathbone?

592
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:36,845
Kill him.

593
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,848
No, okay? No!

594
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,714
You're gonna be civil,
'cause we don't have the seal yet.

595
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:46,688
No seal. No Lin.
No family honor. Okay?

596
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,157
Be cool.
Okay, we look great.

597
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,716
Let's enjoy this party.

598
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,958
- Whoa. What are you doing?
- I'm going inside.

599
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,661
- The place is haunted.
- You're the harness man.

600
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,100
You get back at the carriage.

601
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,332
You wait in case we need
to make a quick getaway.

602
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,430
Go on.
Man your post.

603
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,065
You don't always get what you want.

604
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,576
Why are you so mean to that boy?

605
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,307
I see a lot of myself in that kid.

606
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,576
It's kind of freaking me out.
Come on.

607
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,754
Your name, please, sir.

608
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,993
So I can announce you.

609
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:41,933
Sherlock... Holmes.

610
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,843
Sherlock Holmes.

611
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,476
And which province do you represent,
Your Highness?

612
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,084
Nevada.

613
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:17,803
May I present
Major General Sherlock Holmes

614
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,874
and His Highness,
the maharaja of Nevada.

615
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,934
How are the security arrangements
this evening inspector?

616
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,164
Oh, everything seems to be
going swimmingly, my Lord.

617
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,432
And if I may say so...

618
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:45,134
it is an honor to guard
Your Lordship tonight.

619
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,643
I speak for all of us
at Scotland Yard

620
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,680
when I say that no matter how
far you are from the throne...

621
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,376
you'll always be number one
in our hearts.

622
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,053
Okay, here's the plan.

623
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,615
We're gonna get a little chow.

624
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,422
Then we're gonna sneak out of here.

625
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,929
- Start looking for that seal.
- Okay.

626
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,124
- Spotted Dick, sir?
- What?

627
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,928
Spotted Dick.

628
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,531
Can you believe this guy?

629
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,697
I'm trying to get something to eat.

630
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,638
He's asking me if I got the clap.

631
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,643
I think he's offering you food.

632
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,703
Oh. Spotted Dick.

633
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,248
Oh, no.
I think I'll pass.

634
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,748
I'm not really a dessert man.

635
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:30,116
Perhaps my friend might like
some Spotted Dick.

636
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,090
I might try one of these sausages.

637
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,921
A little smoky Joe.

638
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,855
Mmm! This is good!

639
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,024
I thought the food here
was supposed to suck.

640
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,295
The haggis is fresh from Scotland, sir.

641
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,099
It's made from
the finest sheeps' bladders.

642
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,306
I'm gonna get some whiskey
and wash my mouth out.

643
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,312
You should try the quail.

644
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,848
I shot them myself this morning.

645
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,923
How do you do, Your Lordship?

646
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,723
Very well, thank you.

647
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:16,129
I'm not acquainted
with the Nevada province.

648
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,863
But I haven't been to India since '81.

649
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,373
I spent most of my time in the Orient.

650
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:27,035
I hear you've just returned from China.

651
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,238
You are well-informed, maharaja.

652
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,544
It is my dream that the Chinese people

653
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,949
will follow India's example and
one day embrace British rule.

654
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,577
The Chinese are very proud.

655
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:41,112
They place family and honor
above all else.

656
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,627
Well, I'm sure
we can break them of that.

657
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:51,233
If you'll excuse me,
I have a matter to attend to.

658
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,633
Until we meet again.

659
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,810
Patience. Patience.
I'm proud of you, Chon.

660
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,370
We must find the seal.

661
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,112
What do you see?

662
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,153
Shh, shh, shh!

663
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:17,084
He just pulled a fancy
dragon key out of his desk.

664
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,627
That was my father's!

665
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,185
I must avenge his honor.

666
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,664
Hey, slow down, tiger.
Slow down.

667
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,201
Quit going all Chinese on me.

668
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:30,198
Where is he?

669
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,970
Damn it, Chon.
Remember your puzzle box. Patience.

670
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,407
Okay, there are no windows.

671
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,505
We just came in
through the only doorway.

672
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,243
That leaves one explanation.

673
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,080
Remember in "Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy"

674
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,312
how the zombie king got away

675
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,218
when I chased him into the pharaoh's tomb?

676
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,019
There's a secret passageway
behind the sphinx.

677
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,458
There's gotta be a lever
or a button over here.

678
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,553
Help me lift some stuff up.

679
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:08,466
Roy!

680
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,911
The painting.
It's looking at me.

681
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,243
- Look!
- Oh, yeah.

682
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,409
Looks like it's looking at me, too.
That's great.

683
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,645
No, real eyes.
Moving!

684
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,086
Oh Chon,
that kid got you, didn't he?

685
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,420
Unbelievable!
We're not in a haunted house.

686
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,550
That's a technique that an artist uses.

687
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,619
"Ubiquitous gaze" or "pursuant
eyes" is the technical term.

688
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,689
It's unnerving, though.
I'll give you that.

689
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:37,740
Roy.
Now, those eyes. Look!

690
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,241
Whatever you say, Chon.

691
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,179
Let's see what you got here,
Rathbone.

692
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,750
Roy!

693
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,118
What, Chon?
Are the statues moving now?

694
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:07,693
Wow.

695
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,232
Mm-mmm!

696
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:37,863
Roy!

697
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:42,800
I can't hear myself think
with you shouting at me, Chon.

698
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,099
Chon?

699
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,340
Chon? Chon?

700
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:52,910
This is ridiculous.

701
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,611
Chon, if you want to act
like a child and play little games...

702
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,152
then find someone else, ok...

703
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,619
'cause I take
this stuff seriously.

704
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,486
I'm here to work.
I'm on a mission.

705
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,485
Chon?

706
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,357
Okay, Chon.

707
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,491
Okay, you little Chinese otter.

708
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,898
Let's play.

709
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,195
Ha!

710
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:28,743
Chon, demons!

711
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:50,504
She's gonna fight my battles for me.

712
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,304
Come on.
Let's go.

713
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,969
What? What are you doing?

714
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,607
It's kinky.
I like it.

715
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,150
Wow! Look at this.

716
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,053
Wait. There's something
different about this room.

717
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,401
Hey.
