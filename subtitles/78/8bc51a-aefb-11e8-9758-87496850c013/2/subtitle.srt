1
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:03,629
Come on, T.

2
00:00:03,698 --> 00:00:06,394
Come on, baby.
Wake up!

3
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,628
Wake up!

4
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:11,604
- He was hit... He was hit by a car!
- It's okay.

5
00:00:11,672 --> 00:00:13,970
We need to get him
to the hospital.

6
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,635
Right now! Right now!

7
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:52,412
We'll need a gurney out here.
There's a kid. I think it's bad.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,505
We'll need some help.

9
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:06,383
Are you the boy's mother?
Please, follow me.

10
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,257
Is that your boy?

11
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,200
No.

12
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:15,826
What happened?

13
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,900
I... I think he got hit by a car.

14
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:21,066
That was his mother.

15
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:23,633
- She said he was hit by a car.
- Hit and run?

16
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:26,339
Like I said. I don't know.
I picked them up...

17
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:29,645
I need you to file a police
report if it was a hit and run.

18
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:33,448
Shit, I don't even know them.
I wouldn't know what to write.

19
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:36,649
Just stay, tell the police
what you did. What you saw.

20
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:38,282
Take you five minutes. Promise.

21
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,109
Wait!

22
00:01:59,212 --> 00:02:03,342
Wait!
That's my baby!

23
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,821
Wait!
That's my baby!

24
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:15,726
That's my baby!

25
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,097
I know you're not
supposed to move people,

26
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,465
but I didn't know
what else to do.

27
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:25,663
The boy was laying there...

28
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,435
and the woman was hysterical.

29
00:02:28,508 --> 00:02:31,602
I did the best I could do.
I just lugged him in the car

30
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:34,738
to come here as quick as I could.
That's what I did.

31
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:37,544
You did a good job.

32
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:40,381
So you were
just passing by?

33
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:43,513
Yeah, just passing by.
I don't know the lady at all.

34
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:48,117
I'll give you my card.

35
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:51,755
We'll do a follow-up
if we get anything.

36
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:54,823
We might call you as well,
if we need to.

37
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:57,233
- That'd be all right?
- Whatever you need me to do.

38
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,828
I got your number right there.

39
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:05,067
Is that it?
Can I go?

40
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:09,207
Yeah. Thanks.

41
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,247
Will that boy
make it all right?

42
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,120
No, he died.

43
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:49,817
Mrs. Musgrove,
I'll give you my card

44
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:52,449
and you feel free
to call me anytime

45
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:55,153
that you can remember
anything about this. Ok?

46
00:03:55,228 --> 00:03:57,253
I'm so sorry.

47
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,491
Can I get something
to clean that off?

48
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:02,558
That's mine.

49
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,177
- Here's your purse.
- He's gone.

50
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,406
- My baby.
- Yes, ma'am.

51
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:18,314
He's gone. He's gone.

52
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,652
Will you take her home, won't you?

53
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,956
I don't really know her.

54
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:34,890
- I'll take her home.
- That's a good idea.

55
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:36,229
Yeah,
I'll take her home.

56
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,201
Could you do me a favor
and throw that away for me?

57
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,679
- Yes, sir.
- I'd appreciate that.

58
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:08,566
Where do you live?

59
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,305
Ma'am, you'll have to tell me
where you live.

60
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:18,769
Now, I'll go
in your purse.

61
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:21,005
I'm letting you know
I'm going in your purse

62
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,047
to find
an address on you.

63
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:04,151
You should call
some of your kin people

64
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:06,020
or a friend or something.

65
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:17,096
I'm going to have to go.

66
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,932
You gonna be all right?

67
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:24,499
They told me to call
the Coroner's Office in the morning.

68
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,976
I'm sorry?

69
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:31,345
They told me to call
the Coroner's Office.

70
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,249
They said
they gonna do an autopsy.

71
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,819
I don't know why
they'll do an autopsy.

72
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:42,118
He was hit by a car.

73
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:50,699
I imagine that'll help them
find out who did it.

74
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,728
You really believe
they'll do that?

75
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:58,434
I believe they'll try their best.
I do.

76
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,172
He's a Black kid.

77
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:04,441
You think they'll do that?

78
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:16,257
Here's your bag.
I'll leave it on the floor.

79
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,464
I'm real sorry.

80
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,311
Mr. Grotowski?

81
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:17,820
Just want to say
sorry about Sonny.

82
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:22,154
- We liked him a lot.
- We feel bad, sir.

83
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:28,563
Which one of you is Willie
and which's one's Harry?

84
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:30,998
He's Willie.

85
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:32,865
He's Darryl.

86
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:37,905
I'll see ya.
I appreciate that.

87
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:56,257
I'm going over to the cafe.
Do you want me to give you a ride?

88
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,529
You sure
you don't mind?

89
00:09:00,598 --> 00:09:02,862
I'm going
that way anyway.

90
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:19,006
Is this music
all right with you?

91
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:24,409
- 'Cause I can change it.
- No, it's cool.

92
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,924
You ain't got a car?

93
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:31,256
It's broke.

94
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,420
I'm saving
to get me another one.

95
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,572
$8.64. Thank you.

96
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:50,806
Thank you.

97
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,405
You have
a good shift, okay?

98
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:55,314
Thanks.

99
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:00,523
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

100
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:33,685
Hey, Pop?

101
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:36,953
- Look it here.
- What are those for?

102
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:39,756
I bought a gas station.

103
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:43,861
- That right?
- Mmm-hmm.

104
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:48,460
It's all bought and paid for.

105
00:10:48,538 --> 00:10:50,301
We own it.

106
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:56,437
Don't say "we".
You own it.

107
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:59,846
I didn't buy it.

108
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:06,653
- Yeah, well...
- I wouldn't have bought no gas station.

109
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:08,850
Is that right?

110
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:14,995
I would have stuck
to what I knew best.

111
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:19,057
- What's that?
- Corrections Officer.

112
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,595
Right.

113
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:25,072
Well, I ain't
a Corrections Officer no more.

114
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,234
I'm a gas-station owner.

115
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:31,503
I already made the deal.
It's too late, Pop.

116
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:33,776
You want me
to fix you something?

117
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,339
No.

118
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,083
Hey.

119
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:03,536
Here you go.

120
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:07,441
How are you doing?

121
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:12,453
I'm doing all right.
Tired.

122
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:15,718
- You gonna eat something?
- Chocolate ice cream.

123
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,521
Plastic spoon.

124
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:21,890
You got it.

125
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,328
Thank you.

126
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:33,439
- You're all set?
- Mmm-hmm.

127
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:37,603
- About time for you to get off?
- Mmm-hmm.

128
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:41,381
Did you want me
to give you a ride?

129
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:43,982
No...

130
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:46,316
I really couldn't ask you
to do that.

131
00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:48,652
It's right on the way home.

132
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:58,059
- You sure you don't mind?
- No, I'd be happy to.

133
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,033
Okay.

134
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:05,795
- It's right on Prospect Street.
- Clement's?

135
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:08,240
- Yeah, Clement's.
- You bought Clement's?

136
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,834
Yeah.

137
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:11,879
I know Clement.

138
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:16,179
- I can't stand that man.
- He ain't going to be running it. I am.

139
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:18,344
Well, that's good.

140
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,888
Thanks for the ride.

141
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:23,220
Can I ask you a question?

142
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:29,523
Why did you help me?

143
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:35,200
- What do you mean?
- When you took me and my baby to the hospital.

144
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,204
Why did you do that?

145
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:46,070
I don't know. I guess...

146
00:13:46,148 --> 00:13:47,809
I just...

147
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:53,513
doing the right thing,
I guess.

148
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:03,590
My son died.

149
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:08,463
And...

150
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:13,632
well, he...

151
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,801
he died and then...

152
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:21,781
I never was
a very good father.

153
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,879
He was a good kid.

154
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:36,990
I guess that somehow
I just...

155
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,594
when I see what you're going
through there

156
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,004
it made me think about something.
I don't know.

157
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:52,007
You know when you feel
like you can't breathe?

158
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:05,485
And you can't
get out to...

159
00:15:08,229 --> 00:15:10,220
from inside yourself,
you know?

160
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:11,787
Really.

161
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:22,265
Do you want
to come inside?

162
00:15:26,814 --> 00:15:29,180
I like these curtains.

163
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:35,679
I got these here curtains
on credit.

164
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:40,056
I never heard of anybody
getting curtains on credit before.

165
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,756
What do you think?
They cute? Ain't they cute?

166
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,700
I love these curtains.

167
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:51,203
They're good and red all right.

168
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:53,365
I got...

169
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:58,140
I got these curtains right here
on credit.

170
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:01,181
And the man told me...

171
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:04,012
that I really wasn't supposed
to get this deal.

172
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:05,779
But I think he liked me,

173
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:09,220
and he told me I could have
these curtains on credit.

174
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,224
I said, hey what the hell?

175
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:13,522
Red curtains
will be great for my place.

176
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:15,459
So I said, hey I'll take it.

177
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:19,329
- So I got me some red curtains.
- Damn straight, huh.

178
00:16:22,002 --> 00:16:24,493
You sure suck
that whiskey down.

179
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:27,507
I mean,
Lord have mercy.

180
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:36,108
My husband used to love him
some Jack Daniel's.

181
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:40,517
Like I said,
it's a good drink.

182
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:47,958
- You wait right here. I'll show you something.
- Okay.

183
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:51,928
Sit right here.

184
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:04,843
What you got?
Some kind of a school annual?

185
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:06,435
No.

186
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:08,310
These pictures
right here...

187
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:14,709
these are my husband's
drawings right here.

188
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,318
Lawrence.

189
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:21,758
My husband,
he drew those.

190
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,002
He got himself electrocuted
over there in Jackson.

191
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:34,966
He got himself...

192
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:42,645
These right here,
these are my son Tyrell's.

193
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,183
He drew these.

194
00:17:48,254 --> 00:17:50,449
He drew all of these
right here.

195
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:58,095
He got his talent
from the old man, I guess.

196
00:17:58,164 --> 00:17:59,529
Didn't he?

197
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,329
That's the only thing
that negro ever gave that boy,

198
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:04,302
was some drawing.

199
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,338
Taught him how to draw.

200
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:09,569
- It runs in the family, sounds like it.
- Yeah

201
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:11,269
You know...

202
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,339
he was a good kid, you know.

203
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,577
He was a really good kid.

204
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:20,778
He was so good.

205
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:22,411
He was...

206
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:25,184
he really...
he loved me.

207
00:18:25,258 --> 00:18:27,522
He really loved me.

208
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:29,323
I understand.

209
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:34,789
He was so fat.

210
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:38,265
You saw how fat he was.

211
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,006
I don't care what
I brought in this house,

212
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:44,703
he just ate it up!

213
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:46,404
I don't care
what it was I brought in here.

214
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,447
I bring
some Popeye's chicken,

215
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:52,177
that boy eat the whole thing
before I can get a bite!

216
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:55,879
He would eat his ass off!

217
00:18:56,955 --> 00:19:00,391
You haven't seen
nobody eat like...

218
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:05,822
He would eat candy
and gumballs.

219
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:09,025
He'd make me take him over there
to the Super K-Mart

220
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:12,593
and he put them quarters
in that gumball machine.

221
00:19:12,671 --> 00:19:15,367
He had to wait
till he get the red gumball.

222
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:19,136
He always had to get
the red gumball.

223
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,244
He sounds like a character,
I guess.

224
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:28,583
He'd get
that red gumball

225
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:31,589
and he'd just eat
on that red gumball.

226
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:39,928
Hey.

227
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,366
I was a good mother.

228
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:48,270
I did... every single thing
I can think to do...

229
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,275
I was really good.
I was really good.

230
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:54,506
- I was a good mother.
- I understand.

231
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:58,173
I didn't want him
to be fat like that.

232
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,650
I did not want my baby
to be fat like that,

233
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,983
'cause I know,
a Black man in America,

234
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:05,546
you can't be like that!
And I tried to...

235
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,552
I was trying
to tell him,

236
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:12,290
"You can't be like that,

237
00:20:12,364 --> 00:20:14,389
you can't be like that
in America, and a Black man."

238
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,229
I was just...

239
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,565
I'm not sure... I'm not sure,
what you want me to do.

240
00:20:23,642 --> 00:20:26,110
I want...

241
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:28,874
I want you
to make me feel better.

242
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:31,848
I want you
to make me feel better.

243
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:36,251
I want you
to make me feel good.

244
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:40,016
I want you
to make me feel good.

245
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:42,322
Can you make me
feel good?

246
00:20:42,394 --> 00:20:44,692
Can you make me
feel good?

247
00:20:44,763 --> 00:20:46,993
Can you make me
feel good?

248
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,364
Make me feel good.

249
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:55,337
I don't know
what to feel good's about.

250
00:20:55,407 --> 00:20:59,605
Just make me feel good!
Just make me feel good!

251
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,653
I felt it too.

252
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,386
I needed you.

253
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,791
I needed you so much.

254
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:35,431
I needed you so much.

255
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:39,801
I hadn't felt anything
in so long.

256
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:45,635
Thank you.

257
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:43,961
You okay?

258
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:51,704
Me getting sick back there, doesn't have
anything to do with you, alright?

259
00:25:04,387 --> 00:25:06,321
Pop?

260
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:11,256
Hey, Pop?

261
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:15,297
I'm in the damn bathroom!

262
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:20,832
What the hell happened to you?

263
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:23,872
I twisted my ankle
trying to take a bath.

264
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:28,240
Damn it,
I told you to be careful.

265
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:33,745
Goddamn!

266
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,015
Wiggle your toes.

267
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:43,314
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

268
00:25:43,393 --> 00:25:45,122
Yeah?

269
00:25:48,498 --> 00:25:50,659
I'm sinking.

270
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:54,294
- What are you talking about?
- I ain't worth shit.

271
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:59,835
- You stop that.
- I can't clean myself.

272
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:03,208
Can't walk to the kitchen
without falling.

273
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,113
Can't get to the phone
before it stops ringing.

274
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:11,378
I don't feel
like a man anymore.

275
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:15,379
You're a man, Pop.

276
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:20,121
Can't even remember
what a woman smells like.

277
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:47,849
There's a man here.

278
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:49,220
Where?

279
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:53,526
Thank you.

280
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:59,190
- How are you doing?
- Hey, how are you doing?

281
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:00,825
All right.

282
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:05,065
What can I do for you?

283
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,042
I got this '89 Comanche
out there...

284
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:12,678
it needs a lube job,
new points and plugs.

285
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:15,045
I was wondering
if you'd work on it for me.

286
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:19,386
Yeah.
When do you need it by?

287
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:21,786
Just as quick
as you can, really.

288
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:24,615
Maggie!

289
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:27,059
Leave that alone, babe.
Put that down.

290
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,865
I can get that to you
about tomorrow afternoon,

291
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:36,494
late tomorrow then?

292
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,437
I'd appreciate it.

293
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:45,174
Maybe them boys of yours can...
if they're not doing anything...

294
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,841
wash it and wax it
and everything?

295
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,543
I'm selling it.

296
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:50,812
All right.

297
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:54,584
Yeah... I'll ask them.
I'll tell them about it.

298
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:56,453
I'm sure
they wouldn't mind.

299
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:01,222
I can't take this.

300
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:05,328
It was my son's.

301
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,837
It'd mean a lot to him. I'm sure
he'd want somebody to use it.

302
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:12,203
I ain't saying
I don't want it.

303
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:16,203
I just can't take it.

304
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,439
I want you to have it.
I really do.

305
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,378
It'd mean a lot to me.

306
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:28,412
Let's just take it
for a little spin.

307
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,517
Come on.

308
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:39,961
- I ain't even got my shoes on.
- We won't go far. Let's go. C'mon.

309
00:28:43,404 --> 00:28:45,395
You see how it drives.

310
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:58,976
- What the hell is this?
- Stick shift.

311
00:29:28,148 --> 00:29:31,117
Here's the insurance and title,

312
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:33,415
and all the papers you need.
It's all set.

313
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:37,548
- Okay.
- I'd like to see you tonight.

314
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:42,187
- We should do that.
- Is that all right?

315
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:51,936
- I'll see you later.
- See you.

316
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:21,114
Hank?

317
00:32:23,122 --> 00:32:24,487
That's good.

318
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:26,616
Hello?

319
00:32:27,727 --> 00:32:28,659
Hank!

320
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:33,695
It's Leticia.

321
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:41,229
I'm coming on in, Hank.

322
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:49,976
Hank?

323
00:32:51,117 --> 00:32:52,948
Who are you?

324
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:59,020
You just walked in my house?

325
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:00,615
My bad.

326
00:33:00,693 --> 00:33:03,594
- I...
- Hank?

327
00:33:03,663 --> 00:33:06,962
- You're looking for Hank?
- Yes.

328
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:09,297
Is he here?

329
00:33:09,368 --> 00:33:11,131
Who are you?

330
00:33:12,271 --> 00:33:15,798
My name is Leticia Musgrove.

331
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,240
And...

332
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,642
me and Hank is...

333
00:33:21,514 --> 00:33:23,209
friends.

334
00:33:24,283 --> 00:33:26,513
Musgrove?

335
00:33:30,556 --> 00:33:32,751
Please,
little darling...

336
00:33:33,993 --> 00:33:36,517
have you got a cigarette?

337
00:33:36,595 --> 00:33:38,495
Yeah.

338
00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:42,761
But it look to me like
you don't need to be smoking.

339
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:49,240
Come on.

340
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:51,366
Have you got one?

341
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,752
Match?

342
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:24,364
So, is Hank here?

343
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:28,675
Yeah, Yeah.
He'll be back shortly.

344
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:31,272
I'm Buck, his father.

345
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:35,851
Is that for Hank?

346
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:37,354
Yeah.

347
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:39,083
It's a gift.

348
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:44,359
I'll see he gets it.

349
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:57,198
Woo!

350
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:01,310
Damn!

351
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:09,112
Hank must have done
something right

352
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:11,655
to deserve
a fine hat like this.

353
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,320
I guess he did.

354
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:20,990
In my prime, I had a thing
for nigger juice myself.

355
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:24,726
Hank's just
like his daddy.

356
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:28,739
He ain't a man
till he split dark oak.

357
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:49,788
Hey, Leticia?
Hang on.

358
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:51,488
Where are you going?

359
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:54,327
Hey!
Where are you going?

360
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:56,959
- What happened?
- I met your daddy.

361
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:59,265
- Get off me!
- You can't do that.

362
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:01,931
Give me a chance.
Whatever he did...

363
00:36:02,007 --> 00:36:04,031
It don't matter
a whole lot, do it?

364
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:06,906
- Give me a chance to talk to you.
- Get off me!

365
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:28,420
We're family.

366
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:31,332
I'm your father.
Remember that.

367
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,404
Hank?

368
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:41,143
What's your problem?

369
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:48,846
- I believe that's it.
- Thank you.

370
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,889
I didn't date
that thing at the bottom.

371
00:36:52,956 --> 00:36:54,446
No problem.

372
00:36:54,525 --> 00:36:57,221
Anything below that line,
I didn't do.

373
00:37:00,464 --> 00:37:04,264
Now, you will take
good care of him, won't you?

374
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:07,826
- Oh, yes.
- 'Cause...

375
00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:11,899
I want him
to go out in peace.

376
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:15,501
You must love him very much.

377
00:37:18,515 --> 00:37:20,346
No, I don't.

378
00:37:21,418 --> 00:37:24,478
But he's my father.
So, there it is.

379
00:37:45,142 --> 00:37:48,441
They'll get you
a TV set tomorrow.

380
00:37:49,513 --> 00:37:52,004
Finally getting rid
of me, huh?

381
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:54,812
They'll
take care of you.

382
00:37:54,885 --> 00:37:58,377
There's a telephone at the end
of the hall. You can call me.

383
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:01,219
This is it.

384
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:02,758
I guess so.

385
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:06,823
I'm stuck.

386
00:38:08,899 --> 00:38:10,992
Me too.

387
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,335
I don't want
to go out like this.

388
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:19,773
Me neither.

389
00:38:24,348 --> 00:38:26,145
Goodbye, Pop.

390
00:39:23,506 --> 00:39:24,939
What?

391
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,643
You want your car back?

392
00:39:29,712 --> 00:39:32,442
No, I don't
want the car back.

393
00:39:32,515 --> 00:39:34,483
I mean for you to keep that.

394
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,211
What?

395
00:39:36,285 --> 00:39:39,254
I want you to know
I sent him away.

396
00:39:42,558 --> 00:39:44,856
I ain't got time to talk.

397
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:47,725
I wish you would talk to me.

398
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,157
Y'all ready to order?

399
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:28,167
- How are you doing, Ryrus?
- All right. How are you?

400
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:30,967
- I'm all right.
- Who's Leticia?

401
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:35,100
My girlfriend.

402
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:42,615
Sheriff's Department.
Hello?

403
00:40:55,964 --> 00:40:58,558
- Who's banging on my door?
- The Sheriff's Department.

404
00:40:58,633 --> 00:41:02,125
- Time to go, lady.
- No, no wait.

405
00:41:02,203 --> 00:41:04,068
- Time to go.
- No. Here.

406
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:06,107
No, I don't take anything.

407
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:08,199
You settle with your landlord,
then I go away.

408
00:41:08,276 --> 00:41:09,766
No,
I got the money.

409
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:11,744
I suggest
you get fully dressed.

410
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:15,909
- I'm going to put you out.
- You ain't putting me out.

411
00:41:16,985 --> 00:41:19,681
I 'bout got the money.
I'm still saving...

412
00:42:25,954 --> 00:42:27,979
I painted
the ceiling and the wall

413
00:42:28,056 --> 00:42:30,650
and fixed it up
a little bit.

414
00:42:30,725 --> 00:42:32,955
I figured I ought to.

415
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:35,826
I'll move your stuff here
so you don't have to worry with it.

416
00:42:39,634 --> 00:42:42,797
I'm going to the kitchen
to get a thing or two

417
00:42:42,871 --> 00:42:47,433
so if you want to relax,
make yourself comfortable.

418
00:42:47,509 --> 00:42:49,136
Whatever you want to do.

419
00:43:37,357 --> 00:43:41,191
- This is Tyrell's.
- I thought I'd put it up there.

420
00:43:41,261 --> 00:43:43,286
That's my boy's room.

421
00:43:45,699 --> 00:43:47,462
All right. Here.

422
00:43:49,103 --> 00:43:51,230
You can go up
if you want to.

423
00:43:57,578 --> 00:43:59,409
Can I look at these?

424
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,414
Yeah, go ahead.

425
00:44:08,822 --> 00:44:10,847
That's him right there.

426
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,059
He don't look like you.

427
00:44:17,664 --> 00:44:19,598
He got his mother in him.

428
00:44:33,514 --> 00:44:36,745
I don't mind sleeping
across the hall if you want me to.

429
00:44:36,817 --> 00:44:38,808
- Maybe you should sleep by yourself.
- No...

430
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:41,150
I wouldn't feel good

431
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,712
if you left me in here
all by myself.

432
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:47,316
I just want you
to be comfortable here.

433
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:52,560
I want you
to be comfortable too.

434
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,820
I want to take care of you.

435
00:45:22,296 --> 00:45:24,230
Good.

436
00:45:24,298 --> 00:45:27,927
'Cause I really need
to be taken care of.

437
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:07,631
Can I touch you?

438
00:46:12,111 --> 00:46:13,271
Yeah.

439
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,808
Did you feel that?

440
00:47:19,612 --> 00:47:21,204
Oh yeah.

441
00:47:31,023 --> 00:47:33,048
Did it feel good?

442
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,557
Yeah.

443
00:47:44,036 --> 00:47:46,504
I didn't hurt you or anything?

444
00:47:48,507 --> 00:47:51,135
Not in a bad way.

445
00:48:07,293 --> 00:48:09,261
What?

446
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,399
Nothing, I just...

447
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:20,200
I want to go out
and buy some ice cream.

448
00:48:24,175 --> 00:48:26,200
- Now?
- Yeah.

449
00:48:28,913 --> 00:48:31,108
It just feels right.

450
00:48:36,921 --> 00:48:39,754
- Okay.
- Well...

451
00:48:42,527 --> 00:48:44,722
Can you buy me some?

452
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,696
Yeah.

453
00:48:46,765 --> 00:48:48,926
What kind do you want?

454
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:52,730
Chocolate.

455
00:52:00,557 --> 00:52:01,956
Hey.

456
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,392
I bought
some chocolate ice cream.

457
00:52:08,398 --> 00:52:10,161
Are you okay?

458
00:52:13,537 --> 00:52:15,698
You sure?

459
00:52:21,778 --> 00:52:23,746
You look real pretty.

460
00:52:26,149 --> 00:52:28,208
Let's go out on the steps.
You want to?

461
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,811
Let's go.

462
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:04,377
I went by our station
on the way home.

463
00:54:04,447 --> 00:54:06,642
I like the sign.

464
00:54:23,232 --> 00:54:25,564
I think
we'll be all right.
