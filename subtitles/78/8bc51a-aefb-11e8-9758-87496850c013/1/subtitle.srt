1
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,595
Evening, handsome.

2
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,834
Hi, Lucille.
How you've been?

3
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:31,804
Okay.

4
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,534
- Evening, Hank.
- Hey, Betty, how's your mama now?

5
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,098
She's good.

6
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,478
Here you go.

7
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,254
So...

8
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,196
How you been?

9
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,963
- Pretty good, and you?
- Pretty good.

10
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,330
How's Sonny?

11
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,166
He's all right, I guess.

12
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,949
Vera, how are you doing?

13
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,856
- I'm good, how are you?
- I'm good.

14
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:26,915
Here.

15
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,820
It's all right.

16
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,796
- You want a drink?
- Oh yeah, thanks hon.

17
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,494
Wild Turkey.

18
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,308
I'm sore,
so go easy, darling.

19
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,608
Yes ma'am.

20
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,388
- Thanks, Vera.
- You're welcome.

21
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,720
Yeah.

22
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,110
What's the matter, hon?
You look so sad.

23
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,983
I'm fine.

24
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,542
Hey?

25
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,546
You wanna... You wanna get something to eat?

26
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,228
- Talk?
- Take care, Sonny.

27
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,320
Morning, Pop.

28
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,160
This shit's cold.
I'm gonna get some more.

29
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:28,505
What the hell are
those niggers doing out there?

30
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,375
I said something to you.
Did you hear me?

31
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:37,237
Yeah.

32
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:41,479
Damn porch monkeys.
Be moving in here soon.

33
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:47,254
Sitting next to me...
watching my TV.

34
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,993
There was a time
when they knew their place.

35
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:56,262
Wasn't none of this
mixing going on.

36
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:06,109
Your mother,
she hated them niggers, too.

37
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:20,850
Tell them to get
the hell off my property.

38
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,155
- You put that thing down.
- We came by to see Sonny.

39
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,164
I don't give a damn
who you come by to see.

40
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:28,927
Get them out of here
right now.

41
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,491
Tell them. They're your buddies.
Tell them to get out of here.

42
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,938
What are you standing there for?

43
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,550
You watch your ass, all right?

44
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,625
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah.

45
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:13,241
- Be careful walking around.
- Yeah, yeah.

46
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,456
You see these two boys here?

47
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,454
They're my sons.

48
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:36,360
They were on my property.

49
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:39,869
No need to be scared of no little boys.
They ain't come to hurt you.

50
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:43,031
No need to be letting off no shotgun
to tell them to leave, either.

51
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:45,173
You understand?

52
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:48,274
Then keep 'em off my property.

53
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,145
They're friends to your son, okay?
He invited them here.

54
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,310
They ain't trespassing,
they ain't hurting nobody.

55
00:10:56,387 --> 00:11:00,619
Next time you wanna play cowboy,
I'm over here all the time.

56
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:03,753
Well, you keep them
off my property.

57
00:11:03,827 --> 00:11:06,227
- I think you heard me, sir.
- I think you heard me too.

58
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:07,389
All right?

59
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:10,265
Come on boys, let's go.

60
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:29,619
Aw, shit!

61
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:35,352
- You're all right, Dappa.
- Yeah, I'm all right.

62
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:37,485
- You're sure?
- Yeah. It was loose.

63
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,585
Yeah.

64
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:43,465
Did you see what you did, Sonny?

65
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,900
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It was my mistake.

66
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,871
- Yeah, it was.
- It won't happen next time.

67
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:51,939
Let's just keep going
till we get it right.

68
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:03,585
That's none of your goddamn business.

69
00:12:03,654 --> 00:12:05,554
Woo!

70
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:08,591
I'm surprised you're
talking like that to me.

71
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:11,924
- You being a woman, you know?
- I'm a liberated woman.

72
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:13,190
Better watch out,
Georgia Ann,

73
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:15,424
Tommy's gonna sue you
for sexual harassment.

74
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:16,659
Oh, that's okay.

75
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:22,996
Booter, how you doing?

76
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:27,075
Just give me the $2.50, Sonny.

77
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:28,372
I got it, Booter.

78
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:34,806
- You keep the rest of it.
- Thanks, Mr. Grotowski.

79
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:39,888
Just like I said,
no more mistakes, all right?

80
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:45,759
I wanna make damn sure nobody
makes any mistakes, especially you.

81
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,994
So when it gets time for us
to do it, you know...

82
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:54,237
you can't mess up.

83
00:12:57,474 --> 00:13:00,203
That goes for me too,
and the rest of them.

84
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:05,408
You ain't no different then us,
you can't screw it up.

85
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,410
Yeah.

86
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:11,851
- That's Hank's boy.
- It's in the genes.

87
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,183
Yeah, but he's a boy.

88
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:16,919
- Yes, he is.
- He will be a man tomorrow.

89
00:13:16,993 --> 00:13:20,156
In England, they give
the guy a party the night before.

90
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:23,556
They call it the Monster's Ball.

91
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:31,235
They don't want no lawyer, no preacher,
or anything like that around...

92
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:33,104
So, it's just you and me.

93
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,080
Like I said, we can't think about what he did
or anything else about him.

94
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:42,117
It's a job.
We have to do our job right.

95
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:41,266
I've been drawing a lot.
What about you?

96
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:43,141
Yeah.

97
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:49,143
Look here,
we ain't got a lot of time.

98
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:52,219
I'm going to give you
all my drawings...

99
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:55,751
all my clothes.

100
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:57,190
When you get older,

101
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:00,987
they may fit you and you may
want to wear them.

102
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:04,364
I'm not gonna
see you again after this?

103
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,094
No.

104
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:07,534
Why?

105
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:13,703
- 'Cause I'm a bad man.
- Who says?

106
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:15,437
I do.

107
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,773
But I want you to know something.

108
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:21,282
What?

109
00:15:22,685 --> 00:15:24,016
You ain't me.

110
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:27,851
- Yes I am.
- No, you're not.

111
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:32,452
You're everything
that's good about me.

112
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:36,429
You're the best of what I am,
that's what you are.

113
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:40,093
This man you see sitting
here today, you ain't.

114
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:49,100
Hey, babe.
You look nice, today.

115
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:51,111
You always look nice.

116
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:56,776
Tyrell, did you tell your daddy
what you won at school?

117
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:58,284
Oh yeah, right.

118
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:02,016
My drawing's getting used
for the school magazine cover.

119
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,058
- You know what I did?
- What did you do?

120
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:08,152
Go on, just tell him.
Don't be playing no guessing game.

121
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,697
I made a picture of you...

122
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:11,698
sitting alone...

123
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:13,495
in jail.

124
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:19,203
The theme was solitude.

125
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,906
Way to go, Ty. Way to go.
Put it there, boy.

126
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:28,043
Not too bad.

127
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:39,550
What's going on with the car?

128
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:44,229
It's leaking radiator fluid.

129
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:48,429
Take it in right away.
Have them check the hoses.

130
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:51,131
The car get too hot,
you're gonna be in trouble.

131
00:16:58,113 --> 00:16:59,307
The house?

132
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:02,416
I'm losing it.

133
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:05,385
I can't afford to make
the payments no more.

134
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:08,822
Not no more.

135
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:12,225
I'm sorry, babe.

136
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:21,361
Ty, let me and your mama
talk for a second.

137
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:22,494
Okay.

138
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:32,269
Come on, now.

139
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:38,182
Only reason I'm here,
so you can say goodbye to your son.

140
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:40,947
Okay.

141
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:44,890
I been coming here
for damn near 11 years, Lawrence.

142
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,627
And I'm tired.

143
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:50,688
I'm tired of coming here.

144
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:55,065
- Time.
- So soon?

145
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,601
I got to get going, babe.

146
00:18:16,824 --> 00:18:18,849
It's time for me to go, Ty.

147
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:22,327
I'm gonna call you.
You wait by the phone, okay?

148
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:26,389
Come on now.
Come on Ty, you got to let go.

149
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:28,059
Come on, Tyrell.

150
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:36,303
For every time
I hurt you, I'm sorry.

151
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:37,435
Come on.

152
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:42,047
Ma'am, let's go.

153
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:43,515
Let's go.

154
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:46,349
Ma'am, let's go.

155
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,514
I know my way out of here.

156
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,716
Come on.

157
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:07,003
Well, he don't have
any outstanding appeal, so...

158
00:19:07,074 --> 00:19:09,542
looks like we're definitely
gonna do it tonight.

159
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:12,510
Everybody okay?

160
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:15,047
- You all right, Georgia Ann?
- I'm okay.

161
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:19,281
Dappa, is that hood ready?

162
00:19:19,353 --> 00:19:21,548
Yeah, it's fixed
and ready to go.

163
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:22,680
All right.

164
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:26,118
Anybody got anything to say?

165
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:27,217
Tommy?

166
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:31,355
He likes to draw.
It calms him down.

167
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:32,797
Draw?

168
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,390
- Yeah.
- Okay.

169
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:38,131
Phil, will you make sure he's got
whatever it is he needs to draw with?

170
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:38,728
Yes, sir.

171
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:43,069
Tommy, why don't you
lead us in prayer?

172
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:44,132
Okay.

173
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:53,381
Open cell 13!

174
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:58,587
I'm here for your stuff, man.

175
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:02,493
...that the Lord
save us his anointing.

176
00:20:02,563 --> 00:20:06,431
He will hear Him
in His holy Heaven,

177
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,764
and the saving strength
of His right hand.

178
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:14,599
Be careful with this.

179
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:16,404
Don't worry about it, man.

180
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:19,446
Close 13!

181
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,148
Worry's all I've got.

182
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:26,208
...some in chariots,
some in horses.

183
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:28,913
But we remember
the name of the Lord, our God.

184
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:34,886
They're brought down and fallen,
but we are risen and stand upright.

185
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:38,328
Save us, Lord. Let the King
hear us when we call Him.

186
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:40,888
"Sky surfing is when you skydive,

187
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:44,425
with a board attached to your feet,
and try to do different maneuvers."

188
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:48,531
"A camera flyer flies
with a camera on top of a helmet,

189
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:49,768
filming the sky surfer...

190
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:53,107
and flies with the sky surfer
for capturing the moves."

191
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:55,579
"My camera flyer is my husband,
Craig O'Brien."

192
00:21:00,353 --> 00:21:02,321
I'm gonna put
these on nice and loose.

193
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:05,415
Everything's gonna
be okay, right?

194
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:06,856
Yes, sir.

195
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:15,160
What about my last phone call?

196
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:18,601
Warden says it's a bad idea.

197
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,301
Turn around.

198
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:30,307
Maybe you could call my son
and tell him that I tried.

199
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:33,383
I don't think so.

200
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:35,578
Okay.

201
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:41,386
Open 13.

202
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,307
"Our freefall
is usually around 60 seconds,

203
00:21:56,375 --> 00:22:00,243
and the normal altitude
we jump from is 12,500 feet."

204
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,708
Let's go.

205
00:22:07,353 --> 00:22:09,821
Close 13.

206
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:21,763
"Starting to feel a little
cramped by your present surroundings?"

207
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:24,564
"Maybe it's time
to expand your horizons."

208
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:26,901
"Maybe it's time
to think about ReMax."

209
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:30,272
"ReMax Associates
lead the real estate industry..."

210
00:22:30,343 --> 00:22:32,004
I'm going to be right back.
Stay right there.

211
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:36,709
"ReMax can help you find
a new home that meets all your needs,

212
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:37,976

213
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,076
to someone who will find it
absolutely perfect."

214
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,781
"If you're looking for results,
look for ReMax."

215
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:45,756
"Nobody sells more real estate."

216
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,013
Where... Where's my paper and pencil?

217
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,280
It's my right to have
my paper and pencil.

218
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,377
I know.

219
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:18,581
Your paper and pencil's
on the way.

220
00:23:18,657 --> 00:23:20,921
I promise you it is.

221
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,631
Thank you.

222
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:07,637
You're welcome.

223
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:11,228
Here you go, Lawrence.

224
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:16,701
Is that done?

225
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:22,638
Let's see.

226
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,976
Wow.
That's nice.

227
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,915
It's real nice.

228
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:32,446
I don't look
this good in person.

229
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:36,555
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

230
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:40,256
You're welcome.

231
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,563
You all right?

232
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:50,834
Sonny.

233
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:54,742
- Just breathe.
- Sonny.

234
00:25:57,915 --> 00:25:59,109
Sonny, sit down.

235
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:03,881
I said, sit down.
Sit down.

236
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,661
Come on, Lawrence.
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.

237
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:17,290
Let's go.
It's all right. It's all right.

238
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,198
Just let go. Let go.

239
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:21,794
Let go. It's all right.

240
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,635
Let go. Come on.

241
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,231
Come on.

242
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:39,818
I've always believed that a

243
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,883
portrait captures a person...

244
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:47,055
far better than a photograph.

245
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:56,398
It truly takes a human being
to really see a human being.

246
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:15,852
Wait a minute.

247
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,621
Come here.

248
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:31,875
What the hell is this, Tyrell?

249
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,570
What did I tell you
about eating this shit?

250
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:36,636
Didn't I tell you
don't be eating that shit?

251
00:27:36,713 --> 00:27:39,511
Look at this.
Look at all this fat!

252
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:42,710
This fat ass!
Look at all this nasty fat!

253
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:44,616
Where they at?!

254
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,786
Look at all this candy!

255
00:27:47,857 --> 00:27:50,451
You ain't eating all this candy!
You crazy?!

256
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:52,790
Look at this room!
It's a mess!

257
00:27:52,862 --> 00:27:57,231
Why is it a mess, Tyrell?
'Cause a fat little piggy lives in this room!

258
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,393
Get your ass on this scale!

259
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:02,596
Get on the scale!
What does it say? What does it say?

260
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:07,006
- 189.
- 189?!

261
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,941
You ain't lost no weight!

262
00:28:18,454 --> 00:28:20,319
Come on.

263
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:23,387
Come on.

264
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:25,518
Let's go wait
for your daddy to call.

265
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:56,107
It is ordered and adjudged

266
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:58,312
that the judgment
pronounced and set forth in this order

267
00:29:58,387 --> 00:30:00,287
sentencing
the defendant to death

268
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:03,484
in the manner and by the authorities
as provided by statute,

269
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,789
shall be executed
at this time.

270
00:31:24,873 --> 00:31:26,807
Lawrence Musgrove,

271
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,639
do you have anything
you'd like to say?

272
00:31:38,253 --> 00:31:40,721
Push the button.

273
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:57,963
Hey.
Do you know what you did?

274
00:32:58,031 --> 00:32:59,760
Do you know what you did?

275
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,733
Are you listening to me?

276
00:33:01,802 --> 00:33:03,702
Do you know what you did?!

277
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,431
Do you know what you did?!

278
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:08,963
You fucked him up!
You fucked up that man's last walk!

279
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:12,068
How would you like it
if somebody fucked up your last walk?!

280
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:14,636
You're like a goddamn woman,
you're like your fucking mother!

281
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:19,283
You shouldn't have done that,
you son of a bitch!

282
00:33:19,353 --> 00:33:21,947
Get up,
you fucking pussy!

283
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:24,388
You are a piece
of fucking shit!

284
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,358
Do you understand me?!

285
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:32,455
- Easy, easy!
- Get your fucking hands off me,

286
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:35,092
- you fucking nigger!
- Hank! Hank!

287
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:40,196
- This ain't you!
- This is me, Phil! This is me!

288
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:42,640
And I'm the man
who could have your goddamn job!

289
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:46,509
Don't you ever let me catch you touching
anybody that outranks you again!

290
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,447
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir!

291
00:33:49,516 --> 00:33:51,245
"Yes, sir"?

292
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:53,343
- I don't want to hear you.
- I just keep the peace.

293
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,217
You piece of shit!

294
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:02,553
You got... bleeding.

295
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,257
Sonny.

296
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,053
Get up!
You get out of my goddamn house, right now!

297
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:42,231
You get out!
Come on!

298
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:47,869
You lousy piece of shit!

299
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:51,035
Get up!

300
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:55,241
What are you gonna do, huh?

301
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:57,749
What are you gonna do?!

302
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:05,155
See? How do you like that, huh?

303
00:35:05,224 --> 00:35:07,522
C'mon are you a tough guy now?
Are you tough?

304
00:35:13,232 --> 00:35:15,097
Say something.

305
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:18,363
Say something!

306
00:35:32,618 --> 00:35:34,552
Get up.

307
00:35:43,996 --> 00:35:45,930
You hate me.

308
00:35:55,574 --> 00:35:57,872
Answer me.

309
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,514
You hate me, don't you?

310
00:36:03,582 --> 00:36:05,914
Yeah, I hate you.

311
00:36:09,054 --> 00:36:10,919
I always did.

312
00:36:12,425 --> 00:36:15,053
Well,
I always loved you.

313
00:36:24,603 --> 00:36:26,833
Hand me the scissors.

314
00:36:59,605 --> 00:37:01,470
Hold on a minute.

315
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,670
- Where are you going?
- I want to put these up.

316
00:38:35,466 --> 00:38:39,232
- How much?
- That'll be $2.85.

317
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:01,218
Hey Billy, I'm moving
as fast as I can.

318
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:03,351
I'll put this dress on
and I'll be right out there.

319
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:05,896
- You don't need to get dressed.
- Damn car still acting up.

320
00:39:05,964 --> 00:39:09,127
Leticia listen. It's not just your car.
You've been late every day this week.

321
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,067
Billy, I've been trying to get here.
I need this money.

322
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:13,797
- I'll lose my house.
- Look,

323
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:16,965
go home, relax.
Take some time off, you know.

324
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,599
You shouldn't be here
right now anyway.

325
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:21,770
I know that. That's why you should have
given me the week off.

326
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:25,213
- With some pay.
- Hell, Leticia! We already got a new girl.

327
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:48,530
Hank?

328
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:53,138
- Let's get this over with quick.
- Is there a passage...

329
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:56,304
- ...you'd like me to read?
- No.

330
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,009
All I want to hear is
that dirt hitting that box.

331
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:07,916
He was weak.

332
00:40:14,631 --> 00:40:18,067
You can say something if you want,
once we've covered him up.

333
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:41,312
- How are you doing?
- All right.

334
00:41:41,384 --> 00:41:44,911
- You want to see a menu?
- No, I know what I want.

335
00:41:46,823 --> 00:41:49,121
What you gonna have?

336
00:41:49,192 --> 00:41:51,422
A bowl of chocolate
ice cream...

337
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:54,196
and a cup of coffee.

338
00:41:55,465 --> 00:41:58,400
- Black, sugar, cream?
- No, black.

339
00:42:00,837 --> 00:42:03,169
- That's it.
- Is that it?

340
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:19,888
Hey, Vera, it's Hank.

341
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:21,684
Is it too late?

342
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:28,927
Chocolate ice cream.
Here you go.

343
00:42:28,998 --> 00:42:32,798
I wanna... I wanna a plastic spoon
for the ice cream.

344
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:37,268
Oh, Goddamn!
Sorry about that.

345
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:39,432
- It's all right.
- Shit!

346
00:42:39,508 --> 00:42:41,635
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry.

347
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,940
Bring me some napkins
or something.

348
00:42:44,013 --> 00:42:47,039
I'm sorry about that.
And you said a what...

349
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:48,447
Plastic spoon.

350
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,317
- Where's Lucille?
- I'm trying to fill in for her.

351
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,304
- I'm ready to pay this.
- Yep.

352
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:26,419
What's the deal here?

353
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:30,083
I don't know.
I just overrang this thing.

354
00:43:32,795 --> 00:43:34,524
If you can't get that thing open,

355
00:43:34,597 --> 00:43:37,794
just tell me how much it is,
and I'll pay you for it.

356
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:39,801
$3.92.

357
00:43:41,737 --> 00:43:44,331
Here's $4.00.
Keep the change.

358
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:48,402
Thanks.

359
00:43:48,477 --> 00:43:52,072
Hey, cowboy,
feel like some late-night pussy?

360
00:43:52,147 --> 00:43:53,580
I guess so.

361
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,709
Haven't seen you in a while.

362
00:43:56,785 --> 00:43:59,345
Yeah, well...

363
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:01,912
I ain't been
feeling too good.

364
00:44:02,992 --> 00:44:05,961
Busy with this and that
and the other, you know.

365
00:44:10,799 --> 00:44:12,664
- How have you been?
- All right.

366
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:14,464
Good.

367
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:22,441
So how's Sonny?

368
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,184
I can't do this tonight, Vera.

369
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:37,214
- Are you sure, hon?
- No, not tonight.

370
00:44:37,293 --> 00:44:41,627
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be sorry. Some other time.

371
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:44,429
All right.

372
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,635
You can keep that money.

373
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:52,502
I'm going to.

374
00:44:55,677 --> 00:44:57,144
Adios.

375
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:54,922
- Have a seat, Hank.
- Thank you, sir.

376
00:46:54,996 --> 00:46:57,829
I appreciate you seeing me.

377
00:46:57,899 --> 00:46:59,992
What brings you here, Hank?

378
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:03,128
Sir, I'm resigning

379
00:47:03,204 --> 00:47:07,231
and I wanted to come by
and tell you personally, you know.

380
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:13,707
I appreciate that, Hank.

381
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:21,448
Why don't we wait a few weeks
before we submit the paperwork?

382
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:23,921
That wouldn't do anybody
any good to wait on that.

383
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:25,855
I've got my mind made up.

384
00:47:27,627 --> 00:47:29,288
All right.

385
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:33,158
We're gonna miss you.

386
00:47:39,272 --> 00:47:41,866
I brought my badge in and...

387
00:47:44,578 --> 00:47:48,844
- Why don't you keep it?
- I ain't got no use for it.

388
00:48:16,843 --> 00:48:18,208
There you are, Pop.

389
00:48:25,018 --> 00:48:26,815
We got each other...

390
00:48:27,888 --> 00:48:29,082
son.

391
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:33,487
- Remember that.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:48:42,903 --> 00:48:44,894
I quit the team.

393
00:48:57,951 --> 00:49:00,419
That was a mistake.

394
00:49:07,394 --> 00:49:10,090
I can't do it anymore.

395
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:15,500
You're reminding me
of your mother.

396
00:49:19,573 --> 00:49:21,905
I guess that's bad, right?

397
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,410
Your mother wasn't shit.

398
00:49:27,747 --> 00:49:30,272
That woman failed me.

399
00:49:34,754 --> 00:49:38,747
I got more pussy
after she killed herself...

400
00:49:39,993 --> 00:49:43,018
than I did when
she was living as my wife.

401
00:49:48,934 --> 00:49:50,731
The point is...

402
00:49:51,804 --> 00:49:54,204
she quit on me.

403
00:49:55,341 --> 00:49:57,969
You're doing the same.

404
00:50:01,714 --> 00:50:03,944
Goddamnit!

405
00:50:05,618 --> 00:50:09,076
Let's go.
Hand me my purse.

406
00:50:09,154 --> 00:50:10,746
Come on. Get out!

407
00:50:10,823 --> 00:50:13,553
- Why, Mama, what's wrong?
- We've got to walk.

408
00:50:38,384 --> 00:50:40,750
Tyrell,
get off that street!

409
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:43,413
You'll get yourself killed.

410
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:46,458
Don't do that!
Don't do that!

411
00:50:49,361 --> 00:50:52,797
This is jim-dandy.
This is just what I'm looking for.

412
00:50:52,865 --> 00:50:56,301
At the same time,
it's the most expensive one.

413
00:50:56,368 --> 00:50:59,667
But if you're willing
to talk price a little...

414
00:50:59,738 --> 00:51:01,899
We put quite a bit of work into it.

415
00:51:01,974 --> 00:51:03,874
We could talk about it.

416
00:51:03,942 --> 00:51:07,105
Let me think it over.
You got my number.

417
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:09,340
- All right.
- It was a pleasure.

418
00:51:09,415 --> 00:51:12,043
- Nice seeing you.
- Nice talking to you.

419
00:51:12,117 --> 00:51:13,914
See you.

420
00:51:25,464 --> 00:51:28,490
Come on, T.
Let's go.

421
00:51:30,836 --> 00:51:32,861
That's what you think
your mama looks like?

422
00:51:32,938 --> 00:51:34,667
Yeah, sort of.

423
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,401
- See you in the morning?
- Yeah.

424
00:51:36,475 --> 00:51:37,806
- You too, young man.
- Bye.

425
00:51:37,876 --> 00:51:38,843
Bye-bye.

426
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,972
Come on, T.
Get up!

427
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,176
Come on, T.
Get up!

428
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:21,241
Help me!

429
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:23,810
Help me! Wait!

430
00:52:23,888 --> 00:52:24,980
Wait!

431
00:52:27,525 --> 00:52:29,686
Come back here!

432
00:52:29,761 --> 00:52:31,752
Help us!

433
00:52:33,965 --> 00:52:36,695
Please, help us!

434
00:52:36,768 --> 00:52:38,736
Help us!
