1
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:53,704
<i>Early 21st century. Robot technology
undergoes massive development.</i>

2
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,044
<i>By mid-century,
Japan leads the world</i>

3
00:00:57,184 --> 00:01:00,424
<i>in robot knowledge and application.</i>

4
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,554
<i>From domestic uses to weaponry,</i>

5
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:05,848
<i>Japan dominates the world market.</i>

6
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:09,644
<i>As the technology is extended
to the human body</i>

7
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,976
<i>the mood of
the international community</i>

8
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,480
<i>turns against use of humanoids.</i>

9
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,316
<i>Just as with nuclear power
and biotechnology before,</i>

10
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:22,065
<i>U.N. regulations are proposed</i>

11
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,443
<i>to limit robot technology.</i>

12
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:29,414
<i>Japan fiercely
resists this limitation</i>

13
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:32,450
<i>but the will of the U.N.
is unshakeable.</i>

14
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:38,423
<i>Japan takes the extreme step
of withdrawing from the U.N.</i>

15
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:40,754
<i>And begins a new policy
of national isolation.</i>

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,555
<i>Japan uses it high technology
to withdraw from world affairs.</i>

17
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:50,176
<i>10 years go by.</i>

18
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,472
<i>The resulting information blackout</i>

19
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:56,688
<i>turns Japan into a total enigma.</i>

20
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:02,064
<i>For an entire decade,</i>

21
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:07,072
<i>no foreigner penetrates the veil.</i>

22
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:45,191
This is disrupting
my entire holiday.

23
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:50,069
Now that your family has already
left Washington for Denver.

24
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:52,157
Don't the Japanese

25
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:54,540
understand it's Christmas?

26
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:57,125
Dragging us miles out here...

27
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:01,748
At least the British, French
and Russians are here, too.

28
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:52,318
<b>"S.W.O.R.D."</b>

29
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,487
<b>The R.A.C.E.</b>

30
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:04,707
Final stand-by. We go in on my mark.

31
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,840
Dumb gig. Dumb time of year.

32
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:13,984
Just some Christmas party, right...

33
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:16,092
Do the job quick

34
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:18,305
and you'll home
for Mom's Turkey.

35
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,875
Each of the world's nations has
debated the issue of human evolution

36
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:47,664
and come to
the exact same conclusion.

37
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:51,961
Thus we can say that this result

38
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:57,136
represents a true and just future
for humanity.

39
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:05,017
If we at Daiwa Heavy Industries
have your endorsement,

40
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:08,851
I'd appreciate a round of applause.

41
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,488
Didn't think so...

42
00:06:44,982 --> 00:06:47,264
The primary target is Saito
of Daiwa Heavy Industries.

43
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,976
We're working on a tip-off.
It might be a trap.

44
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:55,529
Keep your eyes open.

45
00:06:57,076 --> 00:07:01,402
I said we didn't need 'em.
Why so many robots?

46
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:04,364
No idea. Ask the chief...

47
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:06,910
They're the latest Daiwa models.

48
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:09,200
Latest or not,

49
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:12,537
I don't trust them.

50
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:33,635
S.W.O.R.D.?

51
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:38,020
Darn you, Maria...

52
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,649
Get out of my way!

53
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:47,879
Darn.

54
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,184
Dispose of all the bodies.

55
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,283
What the heck's going on?

56
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,784
What's SWORD doing here?

57
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:25,453
Answer me.
Don't you know who I am?

58
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:29,289
For God's sake, I demand to know.

59
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:38,546
Leon!

60
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,351
<b>"VEXILLE"</b>

61
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:39,350
<i>"SWORD HQ, Los Angeles"</i>

62
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:04,835
It's a flagrant violation
of international treaties.

63
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,794
Wich ones?

64
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:10,970
They ignored just about every one.

65
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:14,887
Which part is metallic?

66
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:17,597
Well, it's bio-metal.

67
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:20,349
So this was his only robotic part?

68
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:23,687
I hope that's the case.

69
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:26,986
But during the raid
we confirmed his bio-signature.

70
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:30,196
It might've been added later.

71
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:32,202
Is that even possible?

72
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:34,864
Not with our technology.

73
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:41,161
If Japan is manufacturing
androids of this level...

74
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:44,251
It would pose a threat
equal to nuclear power.

75
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:48,344
This mean Saito's an android?

76
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:53,387
In any case,

77
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,178
there's nothing comparable
in the US, legit or otherwise.

78
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,185
It'll take forever
to reverse-engineer.

79
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:03,558
This reminds me of San Pedro
last month.

80
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:16,368
Zak...

81
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,599
Despite all the people
living in this city.

82
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:48,984
We only talk to people with
this badge or to our darn computers.

83
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:51,192
It's not the city's fault.

84
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:52,991
It's the age we live in.

85
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:57,239
Anything from Irene?

86
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:03,913
Not a word.

87
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:05,916
Sorry...

88
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:12,132
Hear anything about San Pedro
from Leon?

89
00:19:15,563 --> 00:19:16,806
Really...

90
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:22,602
Was the tip-off for this misson
from San Pedro?

91
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:23,764
Correct.

92
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:26,726
Not that it's a secret any more.

93
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,019
<i>"Port of San Pedro"</i>

94
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,284
Why the need for us to guard this?

95
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,206
That's the latest
Japanese weapon system.

96
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:32,040
But any enemy would have 'em, too.

97
00:20:32,182 --> 00:20:34,676
The battlefield is Japan's
showroom after all.

98
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:40,049
It's not right that everyone
treats Japan special.

99
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:43,842
Some day, they'll get
what they deserve.

100
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:30,269
Cease pursuit and withdraw.

101
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:31,977
You've got to be kidding.

102
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:35,773
I repeat, caese pursuit immediately.

103
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,187
This is our turf.

104
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:10,346
Zak!

105
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,376
Be careful.

106
00:23:21,178 --> 00:23:22,506
SWORD...

107
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:27,299
December...23rd...Mt. Filar...

108
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:30,304
Beware...of a meeting.

109
00:23:31,103 --> 00:23:32,553
Maria...

110
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:51,825
Leon trusted
the fugitive completely.

111
00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:55,416
I mean,

112
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:58,333
even now I can't believe
it was an android.

113
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:01,337
Function-wise?

114
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:04,253
You couldn't tell it wasn't human.

115
00:24:04,681 --> 00:24:06,130
Might it have been?

116
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:09,011
There was
absolutely no bio-signature.

117
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,301
But those eyes...

118
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:14,852
Autopsy results?

119
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:16,891
They sent the android back to Japan

120
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:19,847
after political pressure.

121
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:21,226
In the end...

122
00:24:22,616 --> 00:24:26,105
they hardly laid a finger on it.

123
00:24:28,287 --> 00:24:29,700
Really...

124
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,116
Maria...

125
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:40,414
<i>Japan. Completely off our screens
for an entire decade.</i>

126
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:43,967
<i>But we ignore its</i>

127
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:46,337
<i>recent suspicious
activity at our peril.</i>

128
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:48,802
<i>We still don't know</i>

129
00:24:48,972 --> 00:24:50,674
<i>the purpose of
the meeting at Mt. Filar.</i>

130
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:56,515
<i>But a State Dept. Order says
the politician we detained there</i>

131
00:24:56,648 --> 00:24:59,563
<i>must be returned to his duties.</i>

132
00:25:00,777 --> 00:25:07,067
<i>There's also strong pressure
from Japan to return Saito's limb.</i>

133
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,988
<i>As for the results of the autopsy,</i>

134
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:16,822
<i>it's composed of
undetecable bio-metal.</i>

135
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:20,868
<i>Judging from bio-signature analysis,</i>

136
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,461
<i>we strongly suspect Saito is
an android.</i>

137
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,386
<i>Android production is a grave
violation of international treaties.</i>

138
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,559
<i>Nonetheless, the White House
is urging caution.</i>

139
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:44,057
<i>Any action that</i>

140
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:51,489
<i>might harm good relations
with Japan, is forbidden.</i>

141
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:57,954
<i>But Japan is up to something.</i>

142
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:06,165
<i>Henceforth we at SWORD
will be on our own.</i>

143
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:07,881
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

144
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:10,465
<i>you can forget about
goverment protection.</i>

145
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:19,309
<i>We are to face this threat
to international society</i>

146
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:22,720
<i>and neutralize it by our own means.</i>

147
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,434
<i>Our mission this time:</i>

148
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:32,192
<i>to infiltrate Fortress Japan.</i>

149
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:37,948
<i>Japan has been veiled in mystery
for 10 years.</i>

150
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:41,199
<i>The time has come to unmask it.</i>

151
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:56,254
These images are of Tokyo
10 years ago.

152
00:26:57,394 --> 00:27:01,514
As you know, no-one has been there
since its seclusion.

153
00:27:02,444 --> 00:27:04,636
Its most powerful corporation,
Daiwa Heavy Industries,

154
00:27:04,778 --> 00:27:07,351
has dominated the economy
for the past years of isolation.

155
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:10,648
Daiwa dictates Japan's politics
and controls all aspects of life.

156
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:15,776
We also guess that it's behind
the policy of national isolation.

157
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:19,696
Japan's high-tech seclusion
is made possible

158
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:21,908
by an electro-magnetic network
named R.A.C.E.

159
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:29,453
It relies on 270 sea-based antennas
covering the entire archipelago.

160
00:27:30,223 --> 00:27:35,418
As you know, it filters out
all waves and light reaching Japan

161
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:38,839
and scrambles outbound signals

162
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:43,346
to create a total barrier
to all transmissions

163
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:46,143
rendering even satellite
surveillance worthless.

164
00:27:47,524 --> 00:27:51,192
Your mission is to penetrate
the electromagnetic field

165
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:56,146
then transmit a reverse beacon
to unscramble the diffusion barrier.

166
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,565
If successful,

167
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:02,488
this will facilitate
direct satellite surveillance.

168
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:06,503
The beacon transmission from Tokyo

169
00:28:06,632 --> 00:28:11,328
must last at least 3 minutes
for the satellite to align.

170
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:14,669
One problem is your entry route.

171
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:18,043
All waters and airspace

172
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,093
are guarded by a warning system
on a technological par with R.A.C.E.

173
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:27,143
Not even a micro-recon craft,
much less a person,

174
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,563
can get through.

175
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:54,163
After you send
the beacon transmission

176
00:28:54,423 --> 00:28:58,166
the infiltration team will press
further into Japan

177
00:28:58,393 --> 00:29:02,551
to gain as much information
as possible about Daiwa Industries.

178
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:08,265
72 hours later you'll meet at a
predetermined extraction point.

179
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:29,825
Commander Leon Fayden

180
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:33,743
has volunteered
to lead this dangerous mission.

181
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:38,176
10 years ago
he was dispatched to Japan

182
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:42,301
leading an anti-terrorist task unit
helping Japanese security.

183
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:45,550
They suddenly shut the borders

184
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:48,801
but he was there
until forcefully repatriated.

185
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,067
Why didn't you tell me?

186
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:04,734
I didn't want you to worry.

187
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,400
Not about volunteering...

188
00:30:06,578 --> 00:30:08,161
the fact that you were in Japan.

189
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:12,707
I never had a chance to.

190
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,415
Is that the only reason?

191
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:17,629
Yes, it is.

192
00:30:32,986 --> 00:30:35,806
Didn't want you involved...

193
00:32:02,783 --> 00:32:04,604
Bring up the deck monitor!

194
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:09,447
This vessel is not damaged
or under attack.

195
00:32:09,957 --> 00:32:13,241
A nearby US cargo ship
just exploded.

196
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:15,113
We are investigating the cause.

197
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:17,453
Just in case,
let's go to emergency status.

198
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,300
Freight inspections all complete.

199
00:33:23,694 --> 00:33:25,125
Safely past border security.

200
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:27,526
We'll lose radio contact shortly.

201
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:36,877
3 minutes to analysis completion.

202
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:38,879
Receiving beacon transmission.

203
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:45,346
Please guys, just 3 minutes...

204
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:50,265
Analysis is in progress...

205
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:54,194
<i>1 minute passed.</i>

206
00:35:02,412 --> 00:35:03,991
<i>2 minutes, 30 seconds passed.</i>

207
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,914
<i>10 seconds to completion.</i>

208
00:35:13,509 --> 00:35:16,676
<i>9,8,7...</i>

209
00:35:17,722 --> 00:35:18,803
What is it?

210
00:35:19,222 --> 00:35:20,801
Signal's lost, sir.

211
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,680
- Find out why.
- Analysis not possible.

212
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,181
Scan again.

213
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:37,899
<i>System alert...</i>

214
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:47,290
<i>System alert...</i>

215
00:36:01,266 --> 00:36:02,592
Vexille, this way.

216
00:36:33,422 --> 00:36:34,621
Zak!

217
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:11,661
In an entire decade,

218
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,456
you are our first foreign guests.

219
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:20,879
We've quite a welcome for you.

220
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:27,278
On my signal, rush for the water.

221
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,509
I won't go by myself.

222
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,725
You're the only one with a back-up
transmitter.

223
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:37,058
We'll join you later.

224
00:38:44,304 --> 00:38:45,417
Leon...

225
00:38:58,192 --> 00:38:59,804
Don't worry, Miss.

226
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:03,771
I'm alone. Nothing to be afraid of.

227
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:10,698
Maria changed your clothes, not me.

228
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:12,694
Maria?

229
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,535
Don't go outside!

230
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:50,925
Leon...

231
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,346
Do exactly as I say.

232
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:28,311
Maria...

233
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:35,282
Don't you dare go out again.
They're still looking for you.

234
00:40:35,456 --> 00:40:38,534
Sorry, Maria. It was my fault.

235
00:40:42,593 --> 00:40:44,831
I never thought SWORD would turn up.

236
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:52,630
So much food...

237
00:40:55,772 --> 00:40:57,048
What about my colleagues?

238
00:40:59,352 --> 00:41:01,763
- Go cool this.
- Sure.

239
00:41:02,737 --> 00:41:04,226
What about Leon and the others?

240
00:41:07,402 --> 00:41:09,274
What happened to Leon Fayden?

241
00:41:11,283 --> 00:41:13,441
His whereabouts unknown.

242
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:20,946
We're still looking.

243
00:41:39,312 --> 00:41:40,882
This is real.

244
00:41:41,698 --> 00:41:43,726
It's really rare, y'know...

245
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:07,954
You slept for 2 days.

246
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:10,786
Get some food in you.

247
00:42:19,184 --> 00:42:23,181
It was you who sent the messenger
to America?

248
00:42:32,656 --> 00:42:34,019
One more question.

249
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:36,355
Where are we?

250
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,285
This used to be known as Tokyo.

251
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:50,286
Tokyo...

252
00:43:03,605 --> 00:43:06,726
Captain, a second transmission.

253
00:43:07,939 --> 00:43:08,936
Are you certain?

254
00:43:09,062 --> 00:43:11,515
Certain, sir.
From the back-up transmitter.

255
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,187
It's still coming in.

256
00:43:14,946 --> 00:43:16,985
We're counting on you this time...

257
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:28,287
Never used chopsticks before, Miss?

258
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,127
Tasty?

259
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:52,054
That's like magic.

260
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,391
Where did you hide it?

261
00:44:05,915 --> 00:44:07,826
Saito's heading this way.

262
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:34,471
Most impressive...

263
00:44:42,704 --> 00:44:48,026
On second thoughts, not.
5 guys for 1 girl?

264
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:50,328
That's kinda pathetic.

265
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:55,118
Where's the SWORD women?

266
00:45:02,595 --> 00:45:04,003
Any chick would run

267
00:45:04,181 --> 00:45:05,670
from a tacky tie like that.

268
00:45:06,896 --> 00:45:09,388
The boss goes soft on you

269
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,223
but I don't have his problem.

270
00:45:15,896 --> 00:45:18,265
I don't know what you're planning

271
00:45:18,861 --> 00:45:22,524
but whatever you do
it's just a matter of time.

272
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:40,665
I'll see you at headquarters.

273
00:45:47,224 --> 00:45:48,426
He's right.

274
00:45:51,434 --> 00:45:52,931
It's just a matter of time.

275
00:46:24,263 --> 00:46:26,755
Daiwa's serious about finding you.

276
00:46:34,266 --> 00:46:35,594
What is it?

277
00:46:38,901 --> 00:46:40,722
This place is so full of life.

278
00:46:48,326 --> 00:46:50,445
I've never seen anywhere like it.

279
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:57,452
It makes me nostalgic somehow...

280
00:47:56,056 --> 00:47:57,176
Bad news.

281
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:53,315
Come here...

282
00:48:54,784 --> 00:48:55,862
Get in there.

283
00:49:04,415 --> 00:49:06,824
<i>Analysis completion...</i>

284
00:49:06,966 --> 00:49:09,538
Captain, 3 minutes completed.

285
00:49:09,753 --> 00:49:12,249
Okay, let's run the analysis.

286
00:49:15,726 --> 00:49:20,587
Run the feeds from satellites
JC17 & JD15.

287
00:49:22,439 --> 00:49:24,618
<i>Running analysis.</i>

288
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:31,433
<i>Analysis is in progress.</i>

289
00:49:45,544 --> 00:49:46,948
Nothing there...

290
00:49:48,464 --> 00:49:51,334
No mountains...no rivers...

291
00:49:53,013 --> 00:49:54,288
No human habitation...

292
00:49:56,135 --> 00:49:59,501
What's going on in Tokyo?
Get it up there.

293
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:13,099
That's all that's left of Tokyo?

294
00:50:21,082 --> 00:50:22,983
<i>Daiwa Heavy Industries...</i>

295
00:50:23,793 --> 00:50:24,300
Captain,

296
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:28,202
we've got Lt. Commander Vexille
Serra's bio-signature in Tokyo.

297
00:50:30,379 --> 00:50:33,824
Satellite JD14
is scanning for her now.

298
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,543
Any other survivors?

299
00:50:35,676 --> 00:50:37,249
None confirmed.

300
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,336
Captain, look at this.

301
00:50:39,468 --> 00:50:41,044
Put it up on screen.

302
00:50:41,598 --> 00:50:43,214
The red dot is her.

303
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,757
She's being pursued?

304
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,307
JD14 is tracking her.

305
00:50:47,813 --> 00:50:49,183
- Captain?
- What is it?

306
00:50:49,565 --> 00:50:54,057
The bio-signature map...
it's unfiltered, sir.

307
00:50:56,449 --> 00:50:59,860
Her bio-signature
is the only one down there.

308
00:51:01,538 --> 00:51:02,942
How can that be?

309
00:51:09,123 --> 00:51:10,911
They aren't human?

310
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:15,206
Scan the entire country!

311
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:34,848
Maria.

312
00:52:11,357 --> 00:52:12,556
What's this?

313
00:52:23,737 --> 00:52:27,196
Let's wait to see
if we're being followed.

314
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:06,276
They say everything
outside the city's a wasteland.

315
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:10,656
Daiwa escaped
to their island fortress.

316
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:12,653
Come here.

317
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:16,198
That's Daiwa out to sea.

318
00:53:23,923 --> 00:53:27,672
It's their fault no people are left.

319
00:53:29,182 --> 00:53:32,216
The Japanese race is extinct.

320
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,682
But you guys...

321
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:39,056
We're not human any more.

322
00:53:40,071 --> 00:53:41,680
Not human...

323
00:53:43,194 --> 00:53:46,518
Just fragments of humanity.

324
00:53:53,203 --> 00:53:54,444
Fragments?

325
00:53:55,581 --> 00:53:59,370
Fragments that will soon be gone.

326
00:54:01,384 --> 00:54:05,833
You saw it, right? The final step
between man and machine.

327
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:20,597
No red blood left in our veins.
