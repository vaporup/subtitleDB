1
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:14,511
You're saying none of these people
are human?

2
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:17,977
But I'd never seen

3
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:19,521
anywhere so alive.

4
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,023
Trying to hold on

5
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:24,880
to their humanity.

6
00:00:26,705 --> 00:00:29,722
Like eating food
although we don't need to.

7
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:40,539
10 years ago, just before
the whole isolation policy

8
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:46,756
an unknown disease spread out
from Tokyo.

9
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:51,802
Infection brought a raging fever

10
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:54,519
with a high mortality rate.

11
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:59,726
There was no information about
cause or transmission...

12
00:01:00,447 --> 00:01:04,229
just a mandatory
immunization program.

13
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:10,534
That was the beginning
of our tragedy.

14
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:17,158
The disease
was a goverment creation.

15
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:20,293
And the vaccination we all received

16
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:24,083
was a Daiwa cyber-virus.

17
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:32,549
It invades every cell of the body

18
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:35,642
converting its molecular structure
into bio-metal

19
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:39,311
so that the human body
is replaced by machine from within.

20
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:46,937
What was worse, the virus
was still under development.

21
00:01:47,787 --> 00:01:48,981
Meaning what?

22
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:53,702
We were a nation of guinea pigs.

23
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:57,367
Japan was their laboratory.

24
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:03,456
Finally the brain is owerwritten

25
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:09,089
the person becomes an android
and falls under Daiwa's control.

26
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:14,430
The speed of the process
differs between people.

27
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:20,227
Some of us still cling
to our human consciousness...

28
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:25,816
to the fragments of our humanity.

29
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,319
The technology is half-baked,

30
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:35,113
so most turn into junk.

31
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:37,370
At best

32
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:40,457
we become lumps of metal
with no memory.

33
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:42,200
In either case,

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,500
we're miserable specimens
awaiting death.

35
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:52,506
How long do you have?

36
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,259
Daiwa's not done.

37
00:02:57,565 --> 00:03:01,184
The next target is America.

38
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,190
They've already planted
androids there.

39
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:11,731
That politician...

40
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,902
My buddy, Saga!

41
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,790
Let's go!

42
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,393
We call those, "Jags".

43
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:36,479
Failed experiments
from the android process.

44
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:41,778
They search around for any kind of
metal absorb it and grow.

45
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:49,667
The wasteland's crawling with them.

46
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:54,583
They throw up some neat stuff
sometimes, though.

47
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,184
We should get going.

48
00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:59,234
Our base is underground.

49
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:20,589
Saito, what about that SWORD woman?

50
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:25,760
We lost her.

51
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,134
Failure's dogging you

52
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:29,848
since you let that informant
escape to America.

53
00:06:31,236 --> 00:06:33,557
Maria is harboring the girl.

54
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,694
Leave them alone.

55
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:46,400
SWORD may have penetrated
the R.A.C.E. net.

56
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:50,409
Even so, America won't do a thing.

57
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:56,081
Relax, Saito.

58
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,749
Our decade-long experiment

59
00:06:58,926 --> 00:07:00,422
nears fruition, at last.

60
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:05,922
That group, G32 Beta, in the slums

61
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,720
they alone are perfect specimens.

62
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:15,851
Maria is a part of that group.

63
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:18,932
Left alone they'll join us
in good time.

64
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,234
But, sir...

65
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:25,441
We need not fear any act of man.

66
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:42,919
Very well. Summon Itakura,
Chairman of the slum.

67
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,232
Hello.

68
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:11,994
Here.

69
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,617
A fresh piece of junk.

70
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:17,450
It should contain the part you need.

71
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:21,001
Thanks, it's just in time.

72
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:22,711
Where's Maria?

73
00:08:25,265 --> 00:08:29,006
Everyone,
this is Vexille from SWORD.

74
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:50,321
Taro, is it ready?

75
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:52,191
Darn right it is.

76
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:00,746
My suit...

77
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,255
I fixed it up
and it's ready for action.

78
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:13,045
Looking for this?

79
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:20,117
- I sent out a beacon signal.
- For how long?

80
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:21,393
Longer than 3 minutes.

81
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:23,148
The R.A.C.E. net's down?

82
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:26,568
Daiwa already reconfigured
the diffusion pattern.

83
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:27,686
Darn.

84
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:33,488
SWORD only needs
a few minutes to act.

85
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:39,157
Another thing, there's one more
SWORD agent at Daiwa HQ.

86
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:41,206
Leon?

87
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:43,410
Yes, Leon Fayden, I believe.

88
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:51,128
Where exactly is he? Any injuries?

89
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:53,428
Sorry, that's all I know.

90
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,088
Taro, what's your source?

91
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:58,223
Daiwa's main stream. It's reliable.

92
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:00,769
Just Leon, no-one else?

93
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,576
No luck. No bio-signature
readings anywhere.

94
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,624
I found an additional signature.

95
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:26,078
There's just one other.

96
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,250
What's wrong?

97
00:10:33,642 --> 00:10:36,046
The electro-magnetic diffusion
has changed.

98
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:37,388
Darn.

99
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,804
I'll re-run the analysis.

100
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:52,945
Have Minerva ready to rescue them.

101
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:59,446
Captain Borg, a call on the hotline.

102
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,033
The Defense Secretary already?

103
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:08,119
No... it's the President.

104
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,090
Borg, here.

105
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:28,017
Yes, Mr. President.
That's correct. 7 agents.

106
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,484
I understand, sir.

107
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:53,204
We must abort the mission.

108
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:33,250
Takashi, what on earth's going on?

109
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,038
There's going to be an earthquake.

110
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:36,252
There is?

111
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:39,417
Yes, it's our last chance.

112
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:42,595
We're going to smash Daiwa.

113
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:45,139
Me, Maria and the guys...

114
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:53,310
3 freight tunnels connect Daiwa
with the mainland.

115
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:58,440
Only the main one links to the city.

116
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:00,940
The others conect to the wasteland.

117
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:02,568
They're all ceramic?

118
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:08,074
Yes. A mid-size 'quake is forecast
for the next 24 hours.

119
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:10,993
All communication gates are open.
In case of the quake.

120
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:13,165
All communication gates are open?

121
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:16,166
Correct. And we found a weak point.

122
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,501
During the earthquake stand-by,

123
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:23,883
all tunnel gates
go to auxiliary power

124
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:28,596
which creates a 50% delay
between detection of an intruder

125
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:32,225
and the gates sealing in response.

126
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,436
How soon
do they close after detection?

127
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,308
- 18 seconds.
- How far between the gates?

128
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:38,815
2,500 meters.

129
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:41,441
That's pushing it
even in a fighter suit.

130
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:43,612
With our air-buggies, too.

131
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:45,233
But it's that or nothing.

132
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,864
And after you break in?

133
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:55,245
We drag this cable behind us.

134
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:00,961
The Jags.

135
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:08,966
They finish the job
if we get the cable inside.

136
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:14,470
This is enough metal to lure them
into the heart of Daiwa.

137
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:19,023
Chairman Itakura's called
an emergency council session.

138
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:36,750
- Is that all?
- Yes, it is.

139
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:40,496
Don't make me repeat myself.

140
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,462
We don't wish to obstruct

141
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:45,378
those who calmly
wait for the end.

142
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:50,882
But surely you know Daiwa

143
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,097
is planning to take America next?

144
00:14:57,113 --> 00:15:00,896
There's so little time. Excuse me.

145
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,316
You're determined to go?

146
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:16,206
Suppose Daiwa responds
by opening the protective gates?

147
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:20,544
This is their precious laboratory.

148
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:23,664
They'd never do that.

149
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:33,426
In the end
we're all in the same boat...

150
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:36,351
trying to protect the same thing.

151
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:42,521
It's just that we choose to fight...

152
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:45,147
until the very moment
we become scrap metal.

153
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,875
As an outsider,
it's not my place to speak but...

154
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:10,592
your city seems to celebrate
the splendor of what you've lost.

155
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,014
But Maria...

156
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:20,219
she fights for

157
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:22,389
the sake of what's not yet gone.

158
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:27,995
Foreigners are to be expelled?

159
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:30,249
What on earth for?

160
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:35,127
Leon...

161
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:01,371
Maria, come to America with me.

162
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:06,784
What do you mean?

163
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:09,750
Your departure permit is invalid.

164
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:13,086
Lt. Commander L. Fayden
requested a pass for me.

165
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:15,592
No such request was filed.

166
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,211
That can't be right.
Check once more.

167
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,970
It comes up negative.
Come with us for questioning.

168
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:23,765
Get out.

169
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:26,596
What for? Let me call him.

170
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,643
Calls to the airport are forbidden.

171
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:33,775
I'm going with you.

172
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,649
Let me join your mission.

173
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:40,865
It's a Japanese domestic matter.

174
00:18:41,002 --> 00:18:42,952
Surely it's gone beyond that?

175
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:46,910
You're a foreign guest, behave.

176
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:49,792
Americans never learn...

177
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:54,586
Leon chose to return here
because of you.

178
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:06,392
Maria, please take me into Daiwa.

179
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,269
Keep personal matters out of this.

180
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:19,443
I know you want to help Leon, too.

181
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:38,251
Takashi, what's wrong?

182
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,128
Takashi, hold on.

183
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:44,637
Takashi!

184
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:47,968
Takashi!

185
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:52,681
Takashi!

186
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,300
Takashi!

187
00:20:33,404 --> 00:20:35,018
Takashi!

188
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:40,773
Call yourself human?

189
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:11,766
This is our rule.

190
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:19,147
Otherwise our plan would
be leaked to Daiwa.

191
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:45,691
Vexille.

192
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,153
We need someone to replace Takashi.

193
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:09,835
Once in the tunnel, floor it
or you won't have a chance.

194
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:14,386
Take a mid-line to reduce distance.

195
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:18,351
Touch the brakes and it's all over.

196
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:24,270
I'll lead Team Red
to the East tunnel.

197
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:28,984
Saga takes Team Black to the West.

198
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,783
We've never fielded this many units

199
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:38,224
so we don't know how many Jags
will turn up.

200
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:42,409
Even if you're the only one left,
don't give up.

201
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:46,829
We just need one cable
to reach Daiwa.

202
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:53,170
Though we are no more
than fragments...

203
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,216
we are still human.

204
00:23:57,358 --> 00:24:02,597
As long as we have our pride
we can still take back our country!

205
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:16,548
Maria,

206
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:18,420
more Jags than we thought, huh?

207
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:20,348
Murata.

208
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,593
I'll double back and
get them off your tail.

209
00:25:45,457 --> 00:25:46,739
Team Black to Red.

210
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:48,039
Red here.

211
00:25:54,015 --> 00:25:56,215
Almost to the target gate.

212
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,209
Roger.

213
00:25:58,386 --> 00:25:59,672
They're after you!

214
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,403
Murata!

215
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:41,590
We're through the gate.

216
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:02,192
Leave it to me.

217
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:30,427
2nd gate cleared!

218
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:14,145
3rd gate cleared
but we lost Masato's team.

219
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,779
Maria, we lured them away
from the gate.

220
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,824
Make another approach.

221
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:31,862
Roger.

222
00:28:44,804 --> 00:28:48,721
The Jags are on the cable already.
They're too fast!

223
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:22,791
Maria!

224
00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:55,071
Vexille.

225
00:31:07,985 --> 00:31:09,189
One left.

226
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,162
Maria.

227
00:32:51,341 --> 00:32:52,707
How come...

228
00:33:02,515 --> 00:33:03,717
Bravo.

229
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:10,813
I guess you didn't expect the tunnel
to be separated from the island?

230
00:33:14,111 --> 00:33:15,604
What a shame.

231
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:18,858
Jags can't jump that far.

232
00:33:22,452 --> 00:33:25,327
Chairman Itakura
kept us well-informed.

233
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,262
Leon!

234
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:32,720
Nice to see you again, Maria.

235
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:42,402
We're friends from our student days.

236
00:34:45,913 --> 00:34:48,201
The 10 years haven't changed you.

237
00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:54,663
As beautiful
and as dangerous as ever.

238
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,290
Mr. Kisaragi...

239
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:06,719
<i>Nobody move. You're in breach of
international law.</i>

240
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:09,260
<i>Nobody move...</i>

241
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:15,558
Maria...

242
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:17,891
I warned you in vain.

243
00:35:30,747 --> 00:35:32,491
The irony of fate.

244
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:35,782
Hardly imagined I'd see you again.

245
00:35:38,796 --> 00:35:40,378
I can't let you do that!

246
00:35:57,483 --> 00:35:58,972
"Insufficent evidence"?

247
00:36:00,532 --> 00:36:04,983
We're public servants with no chance
against the might of Daiwa.

248
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,819
It's not just breach of a treaty,

249
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:11,367
their research
is a threat to mankind.

250
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:14,656
They were released this morning.

251
00:36:23,801 --> 00:36:27,009
We are the peak of human evolution.

252
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:29,133
In fact human existence is nothing.

253
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,011
But a preparatory stage
in our creation.

254
00:36:34,689 --> 00:36:37,224
There's nothing evolved about you.

255
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:53,865
This body, born of humankind
is perfection.

256
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:58,365
Matchless in level of intellect
and stability of emotion.

257
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,789
No need for sleep nor food.

258
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:07,131
Above all, we shall attain
immortality at last.

259
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,132
What more could be asked?

260
00:37:15,356 --> 00:37:18,930
You will join me in immortality
soon enough.

261
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:26,068
Only the few
will attain this evolution

262
00:37:26,322 --> 00:37:30,610
and be reborn as Japanese...
the world's strongest race.

263
00:37:32,704 --> 00:37:35,409
I have done the work of god.

264
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:39,367
Maybe I was god all along.

265
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,791
He's insane.

266
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,553
But on the eve of completion,

267
00:37:57,732 --> 00:38:01,014
Japan is empty of
workable specimens.

268
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:06,270
But your country abounds in them.

269
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:10,357
Healthy subjects
like your dear Leon.

270
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:45,345
Nothing divine about you...

271
00:38:46,196 --> 00:38:48,190
Just another flawed human.

272
00:38:56,328 --> 00:39:00,826
I had to protect myself for
your sakes against everything.

273
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:07,666
Of course I would have the injection
once the virus was safe.

274
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:08,959
Such suffering

275
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,751
for this sicko...

276
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,714
My research brought you
all eternal life...

277
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:19,222
Androids can't act compulsively.

278
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,556
It doesn't make sense...

279
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:28,014
Halt, Saito. Stop it, please.

280
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:46,740
The city gates are opening
onto the slums!

281
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,339
You have the citizens' full support.

282
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:07,852
This is Chairman Itakura.

283
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:16,188
The Council and I were misguided
and betrayed you all.

284
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:21,029
Now, thanks to your brave resolution

285
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:25,112
we can make amends for our mistake.

286
00:40:32,258 --> 00:40:34,754
Thank you all very much.

287
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:36,798
Chairman Itakura...

288
00:41:13,965 --> 00:41:16,292
Detach the central tunnel
from the island!

289
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:19,130
A transporter is en route.

290
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:24,131
Do not let it arrive.
Detach the tunnel.

291
00:41:26,018 --> 00:41:28,096
Don't let it in!

292
00:41:43,455 --> 00:41:44,649
Darn.

293
00:41:51,794 --> 00:41:53,449
Piece of junk.

294
00:42:04,811 --> 00:42:08,174
As long as I have my research

295
00:42:08,523 --> 00:42:11,761
the world can still be mine.

296
00:42:21,993 --> 00:42:25,615
The Jags will be here soon.

297
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:19,744
I'll get him, you look after Leon.

298
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:21,253
No, I'll go after him...

299
00:43:22,302 --> 00:43:24,128
Not with that leg, you won't.

300
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:29,344
Look after Leon for me.

301
00:45:56,658 --> 00:45:58,068
Maria...

302
00:45:59,454 --> 00:46:03,699
Why didn't you come to the airport?

303
00:46:25,106 --> 00:46:27,264
I hate machines

304
00:46:27,527 --> 00:46:29,767
but humans like you
are far worse.

305
00:46:38,286 --> 00:46:39,530
Vexille!

306
00:47:05,897 --> 00:47:07,095
Vexille.

307
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,814
Where's Maria?

308
00:47:34,215 --> 00:47:37,710
Stay back, you heap of junk!

309
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:39,923
The Jags will get you soon.

310
00:47:41,388 --> 00:47:42,507
Maria.

311
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:48,304
Maria, run!

312
00:47:49,938 --> 00:47:53,307
Now we'll be together forever.

313
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:27,340
Maria!

314
00:50:35,688 --> 00:50:39,556
<i>Jags across Japan came
to destroy Daiwa</i>

315
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,392
<i>then sank deep beneath the sea.</i>

316
00:50:46,905 --> 00:50:49,483
<i>Maria and her kind died off.</i>

317
00:50:51,293 --> 00:50:57,572
<i>But they left us something vital
we should carry with us.</i>

318
00:50:59,464 --> 00:51:01,703
<i>It was Maria that taught us</i>

319
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,920
<i>as long as we communicate hope
to the next generation</i>

320
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:11,380
<i>we ourselves gain eternal existence.</i>
