1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,725
Okay, I'll drop it

2
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:17,913
"I would sacrifice my life for you
if only I could know what you want"

3
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,917
"I would agree to everything,
my beautiful one"

4
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:38,965
"Hahn! I know you, very very well"

5
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:43,973
"If you want to be with me then,
you better fulfill what I ask of you"

6
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,092
"Hoye 'hoye 'hoye, you are my life"

7
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,858
"You are my beloved"

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,293
"The festival of
Lodi is here? - Aha"

9
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,663
"Take your partners? - Aha"

10
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,998
"Grasp the wrist of your beloved"

11
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,300
"and never let it go? - Aha"

12
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,739
"Never let it go"

13
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,936
"don't tell lies? - Oho"

14
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,274
"don't be guilty of blasphemy? - Oho"

15
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:27,543
"Every oath you swear,
has been broken by you?"

16
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:30,153
"Oho...?
- Been broken by you"

17
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:37,285
"as soon as the sun sets every evening
You drink with your cronies"

18
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:42,160
"The sun goes down and you get drunk
What sort of life is this?"

19
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:50,099
"You're perfectly right and
henceforth I shall keep it in mind"

20
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:54,769
"just let me drink today,
from tomorrow I shall not touch a drop"

21
00:01:55,114 --> 00:02:00,381
"Yes, now he will come
straight home at sundown"

22
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:04,682
"I would sacrifice my life for you"

23
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:09,020
"My dear one, my fair one,
my handsome one, my beloved"

24
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:13,961
"My life, O'dear one,
O'beautiful one"

25
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:33,176
"Everyday I see you playing cards.
More beloved than me..."

26
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,583
"are your fives, sixes and sevens?"

27
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:37,448
"Why?"

28
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,753
"My card playing foolishness
will end forever"

29
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:49,458
"Now there will be only two cards
in my life, the king and the queen"

30
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,298
"My life will be yours
if you give up these decks of cards"

31
00:02:55,508 --> 00:03:00,707
"I know you, very very well"

32
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:03,404
"Hoye 'hoye 'hoye, you are my life"

33
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:08,044
"You are my beloved"

34
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,516
"The festival of
Lodi is here? - Aha"

35
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,783
"Take your partners? - Aha"

36
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,154
"Grasp the wrist of your beloved"

37
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,387
"and never let it go? - Aha"

38
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:20,861
"Never let it go"

39
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,331
"don't tell lies? - Oho"

40
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,436
"don't be guilty
of blasphemy? - Oho"

41
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,734
"Every oath you swear,
has been broken by you"

42
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:32,740
"Oho...? - Been broken by you"

43
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:46,188
"Whenever I ask you to bring something
you can never remember"

44
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:51,088
"I asked you for some ribbons for my hair
and you bought sweets"

45
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:59,070
"Now I have this notebook
in which I will write..."

46
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:03,969
"so that I can bring exactly
what you ask me to get"

47
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:09,474
"Yes, slowly he will mend
his ways completely... yes?"

48
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,618
"I would sacrifice my life for you"

49
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:18,119
"My beautiful one,
my innocent one, my life, my beloved"

50
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:23,193
"My dear one, my fair one,
my handsome one, my beloved"

51
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:38,707
"Whether you change or you don't,
you will always be mine"

52
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:43,473
"I want that in every birth
you should be mine"

53
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:55,016
"Beloved, in every birth
I'm your worshipper"

54
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:59,823
"You were mine, you are mine
and you will always be mine"

55
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:05,402
"Yes without you he will be lost"

56
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:10,507
"Now every desire of
your heart will be fulfilled"

57
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,490
"The festival of Lodi is here,
take your partners"

58
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,662
"Grasp the wrist of your beloved,
and never let it go"

59
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,167
"don't tell lies,
don't be guilty of blasphemy"

60
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,268
"Every oath you swear,
has been broken by you"

61
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:04,755
Here you are Bauji. God knows where all
Maati's sent me to look for you

62
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,330
Breakfast is getting cold. Come quickly.
I've got to leave. Come on

63
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,931
come here son... sit

64
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,169
What happened Bauji?
What're you looking at?

65
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:25,177
I'm looking at my lifetime's
achievements... my legacy, my village

66
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:31,015
Up until now I was very proud of myself
that I have done great work...

67
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:36,354
that I've developed this village
from nothing. But yesterday...

68
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:40,694
that young girl asked me
an innocent question. And I realised.

69
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:45,703
That I haven't done much...
there's still a lot left to do

70
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,534
Son, in the few years left of my life,
how much can I really achieve?

71
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,307
And after I die this village
will be orphaned

72
00:06:54,847 --> 00:07:01,377
all the work will be left incomplete...
so I was seeing a dream and wondering...

73
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:06,889
if my dream will come true or not?
- What dream, Bauji?

74
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:16,127
I saw that after Maati and I are gone
you are here riding my bicycle

75
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,569
Your wife is sitting behind you;
the village is not orphaned

76
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,435
Nothing is left incomplete...
that's what I was seeing...

77
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:25,241
So why won't this dream come true?

78
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,647
Now that you've become
Squadron Leader Veer pratap Singh...

79
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,745
you'll settle in the city.
Why would you worry about the village?

80
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,286
No Bauji. I am your Veeru
first and foremost

81
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,423
and if you've seen a dream it will
come true. Only I won't be circling around...

82
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,129
on a cycle. I'll use a helicopter.
Will that do? Okay come on now...

83
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:49,593
otherwise Maati's going to shout.
- Oh there's one more thing

84
00:07:53,038 --> 00:08:00,103
In my dream, I've also seen the girl
sitting behind you on the cycle

85
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,785
Looks like you've already had
some rum is morning Bauji she's a Pakistani

86
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:22,066
She's pakistani, chinese or japanese,
I don't care. I can just see...

87
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,299
that when this girl sits behind
you on the cycle...

88
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:31,866
Their hand will rest on your shoulder,
she'll never let you fall...

89
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:38,650
She'll never let you take a wrong turn.
Come here, sit. Listen...

90
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,147
when the right woman comes
into a man's life...

91
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,154
that's when his life becomes complete.
I chaudhry Sumer Singh am incomplete...

92
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:56,265
without your Maati. And you
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh...

93
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:03,333
you will be incomplete without zaara.
That's why... you first understand...

94
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:06,003
What your heart is telling you;
and then quickly tell her

95
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,512
Otherwise son, it'll be too late

96
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,443
Bauji tell me one thing... - Yes?

97
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,187
Since it's your dream,
is it okay if the wife sits...

98
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:20,688
the front seat of the cycle?
- Yes it's okay. Should I go tell her?

99
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,684
No please only I will tell her...
- No, no I'll tell her...

100
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,695
No, I do the talking.
- She's downstairs? I'll tell her

101
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,367
Who's marrying? You or I?
- One and the same

102
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:34,267
One and the same...?
- Never mind. Hey lucky girl...

103
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,916
May I leave, Maati?
- Oh are you leaving?

104
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,620
I'll let you go only on one condition,
you have to promise to come back

105
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:56,925
Okay I promise. But in return you'll
give me permission for something?

106
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:57,754
What?

107
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:00,327
From now on...

108
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:02,998
may I call you Bebe?

109
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:21,812
I think we should leave

110
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,957
Or it'll get late.
- I'm ready. I'll go get my bag

111
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,853
You're leaving? - Yes Maati

112
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,191
You'd asked me to come here for Lodi
no matter what. So I came

113
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:39,303
But I've got leave for only two days.
I've to report at headquarters tonight

114
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,699
I'll put zaara on a bus to amritsar and...
- absolutely not

115
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:46,641
You'll take zaara to atari
and see her onto her train. She's all alone...

116
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,546
what if something happens to her?
- She's become your favourite in a day?

117
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,713
You used to get upset when it was time
for me to leave and stop me

118
00:10:55,921 --> 00:11:00,221
Today you want me to leave quickly?
- I don't have time for your nonsense

119
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,321
I've made some laddoos for
you and ranjit. Take them

120
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:13,167
Oh Ginda where've you been?
- Veeru's getting late

121
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,670
Bauji I was filling up diesel.
- Is this any time to fill up?

122
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,000
Let it be

123
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:18,835
Okay now bless me...

124
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:21,845
May you live long, son

125
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,507
Tell her, huh? - Yes yes, I'll tell her

126
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:26,741
Shall I? - Stop pressurizing me

127
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:27,884
Maati control him

128
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,711
Where are you going?
What's in this?

129
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,514
Not for you. - No...? I see...

130
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,725
for your son...?
- Bauji...

131
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,697
What are you doing?
Here girls don't touch the feet

132
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,192
But daughters ask for blessings before
they bid farewell to their fathers?

133
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:47,201
May you live long my child

134
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,343
Give your parents a message from me

135
00:11:57,282 --> 00:12:04,518
Tell them that a sixty year old Indian
salutes the values they've put into you

136
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,933
What d'you think?
Will Veeru tell her?

137
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,764
He's chaudhry Sumer Singh's son,
why won't he tell her...

138
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,598
didn't I tell you?

139
00:12:56,441 --> 00:13:00,241
Stop it... - What... where're you going?
Listen...

140
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:12,053
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh
thank you very much

141
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:13,417
For what?

142
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,388
In exchange for my one day...

143
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:21,559
you've given me a lifetime of
memories and relationships

144
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:26,729
It was a promise from an Indian
to a Pakistani If I didn't fulfill it...

145
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,469
my country's honour
would've been tarnished, no?

146
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:34,812
I think getting Bebe's ashes here
was God's way to get me here

147
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:40,074
I was destined to meet all of you.
- Do you believe in destiny?

148
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:41,910
Of course

149
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:46,385
don't you? - Not until now

150
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,751
But now I've begun to believe

151
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,532
are you all right?

152
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,910
You aren't all right,
you're hurting?

153
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:14,345
Look let's rest here for a while...
- No, I'll miss my train

154
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:17,681
You won't miss your train...

155
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,357
You lean on me... put your hand across

156
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:26,692
Your anklet

157
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,362
I'll keep it. I'll give it to you later

158
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:33,704
come... hold on tight...

159
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,046
How many times are you going
to save my life?

160
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,211
As many times you put yourself at risk...

161
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,095
actually there's
a lot of hustle for seats

162
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,426
The festival of Idd is coming up.
At this time...

163
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:38,399
a lot of people go across the border.
But you don't worry, I'll find a way

164
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:09,165
Thank God you're all right.
I just got off the train from Lahore

165
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:12,099
I was finding out about Kiritpur,
when I saw you

166
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:20,444
Your father has returned. He sent me.
Let's call home and say you're fine.

167
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:22,272
Then we'll prepare for our return

168
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,609
and you are...?

169
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:30,284
This's Veer.
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh

170
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:36,522
Thanks to him, I've managed to get here.
This is raza. Raza Shirazi, my fiance

171
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,119
The seats are done,
we should be leaving now...

172
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:17,559
So silly of me... I went on talking
about everything...

173
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,665
but I forgot to tell you of raza
- You made a big mistake.

174
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,167
What!

175
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,471
You made a big mistake

176
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:43,719
zaara I'm a very simple man. I speak
frankly and understand things simply

177
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,157
It's the first time I started thinking
differently because of Bauji and Maati

178
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,336
The entire journey I kept thinking up
a way to stop you, not to let you go...

179
00:17:56,141 --> 00:18:03,479
and tell you that I really like you
and if you think I'm okay then...

180
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,515
let's get married

181
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,679
and we'll breeze through life together
just like these past two days

182
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,223
But the guy up there has strange ways

183
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:20,589
He kept building my confidence
and then when we got here...

184
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,859
He changed the entire story

185
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:35,040
You must be wondering why
I'm telling you all this right now

186
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:42,676
please don't get me wrong. I understand
that you belong to someone else...

187
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:49,885
and there's nothing between us
nor can there ever be...

188
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,733
but where ever...
whenever you need a friend...

189
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,569
just remember that there is a man
across the border...

190
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,575
Who will give his life for you

191
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,913
c'mon zaara we must leave

192
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:16,579
Mr. Veer...

193
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:23,089
zaara told me how you saved her life.
Now I'm indebted to you.

194
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:28,661
So tell me how may I repay you?
- Just keep zaara happy...

195
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:30,666
the debt will be repaid

196
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:33,428
careful Mr. Veer...

197
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:37,100
lest I get the impression
that you've fallen in love with zaara

198
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,373
what is love... I don't know.
But yes...

199
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:49,811
I do wish from the bottom of my heart
that zaara never has tears in her eyes

200
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,115
That she always keeps smiling

201
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,959
If that's what you call love,
then love it is

202
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:06,803
Mr. Veer, you're talking about
my fiancee to my face

203
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:13,408
I don't know whether to consider this
a compliment or an insult

204
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:19,076
If you think of this as nothing,
it's better. For the truth is that...

205
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:25,020
I'm nothing to her
and you are everything for her

206
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,655
Good Bye

207
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:34,657
Let's go

208
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:11,157
"just for two moments,
the caravans of our dreams made a stop"

209
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:16,671
"and then you went your way
and I went mine"

210
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:22,177
"just for two moments
existed the story of our hearts"

211
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,841
"and then you went your way
and I went mine"

212
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,548
"Was that really you
or was it a luminous sunbeam"

213
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:02,884
"Was that you or was it a blossoming bud"

214
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:08,618
"Was that you or was that the
monsoon of my dreams"

215
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:13,728
"Was that you or was
that a cloud of happiness"

216
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:19,732
"Was that you or was it
a full blooming flower"

217
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:25,738
"Was that you or did I find a
beautiful new world"

218
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:30,904
"just for two moments,
the caravans of our dreams made a stop"

219
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:36,577
"and then you went your way
and I went mine"

220
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:41,750
"just for two moments existed
the story of our hearts"

221
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:48,263
"and then you went your way
and I went mine"

222
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,038
"Seven eighty six"

223
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:05,040
dinner time

224
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:11,551
and Ma'am your visiting time is over

225
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,287
You'll have to leave now

226
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:25,469
I'll come back tomorrow

227
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,201
Sorry, your story is left incomplete

228
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,740
come on, Ma'am

229
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:47,321
and seven eighty six, I'm sending
someone to take the plate in ten minutes

230
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,652
Eat quickly or you'll have to sleep
on an empty stomach again

231
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:57,991
Have you ever wondered
why his number is seven eighty six?

232
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:58,828
What...?

233
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:05,832
Have you ever wondered...?
From the thousands of prisoners here...

234
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:11,508
how come this lone Hindu prisoner
has got allah's holy number?

235
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,179
This is not a mere coincidence,
this is God's great miracle...

236
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:28,830
His way of telling all of you that this
This God's own man. Treat him with respect

237
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,562
Next time you speak to him
so rudely...

238
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,835
give a serious thought
to what I've just said.

239
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,107
These are Ladoos.
My mother sent them for you

240
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,441
please have some.
She has sent them with her blessings

241
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,151
What happened?
You don't like it?

242
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:14,697
No... no... these are just like
the ones Maati used to make

243
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,302
Things made by a mother's hands
are the same everywhere

244
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,446
May I have one more?

245
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,046
Yes please, these're all for you

246
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:38,318
Tell your mother she's filled
my entire childhood into this little box

247
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,255
delicious

248
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,297
all night, I was telling
my mother your story

249
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,867
My mother cried a little
and went to sleep

250
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:55,009
But I stayed up waiting for dawn.
Kept thinking how and why...

251
00:26:55,113 --> 00:27:03,384
did you get here...? Kept wondering
why didn't this story end at that station?

252
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:14,896
This story couldn't have ended there.
Because so far this was only...

253
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:22,870
a tale of Veer's love.
Zaara's love had not yet begun

254
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:34,849
and without knowing what zaara felt
Veer's story and Veer's life...

255
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,687
would both remain incomplete

256
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:47,960
jehangir Hayaat Khan, zaara's father
and the pride of Lahore

257
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:55,637
Since the inception of pakistan
the name of the Hayaat Khan family...

258
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,099
was synonymous with respect,
power and glory

259
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:07,607
jehangir Hayaat Khan was taking
his first step into politics...

260
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,786
with the help of abdul Shirazi...

261
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,991
another rich, respectable man
of Lahore...

262
00:28:17,261 --> 00:28:20,389
he was raza Shirazi's father

263
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:26,892
zaara and raza's marriage
was no ordinary relationship

264
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,475
all these people's futures were
dependent on this alliance. In this situation...

265
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:37,740
zaara's coming to India all by herself
was a very irresponsible act

266
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:43,910
and to forgive such an act
was not jehangir Hayaat Khan's nature

267
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:48,588
It was a month since
zaara had returned...

268
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:52,092
but her father had not
yet spoken with her

269
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:57,298
God Ma'am, I'll burst with happiness
what an elegant outfit...

270
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,529
and look, I think this
jewellery set is an antique

271
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:04,367
I think it belongs to
Mr. raza's ancestors

272
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:08,875
Our zaara is very lucky. Mr. raza has
everything. Respectability, money

273
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,310
There's no doubt in that.
He has everything by God's grace

274
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:16,843
There could not be a better match
than this. Just pray for them

275
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:21,388
There's a man across the border
who will give his life for you

276
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:27,187
Ma, can you give up your life
for papa?

277
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,028
Of course. He's my husband.
I can do anything for him

278
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,998
and would papa give up
his life for you?

279
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,367
What kind of a question is that!
Pray to God...

280
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,372
such an
occasion does not arise

281
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:43,072
But if such an occasion were to arise?

282
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,873
Then can you say for sure that
papa would give up his life for you?

283
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:49,310
Have you gone mad?

284
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,479
Shabbo give me some lime
my hands have become sticky

285
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:56,557
That means, you're not sure?

286
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:07,827
Listen baby, between a woman's love and
a man's love there's a huge difference

287
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:14,773
a woman loves with
all her heart and soul

288
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:21,582
Men do not have the strength
to love like that. I know why...

289
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:26,917
you're asking me this question.
But don't expect this from raza

290
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,124
just give him your heart and soul
and fulfill your duties

291
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:37,527
and I am very sure that
he will fulfill his duties too

292
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:41,829
But he won't give up his life
for me, no...?

293
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:44,072
You're talking nonsense

294
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,900
Here Shabbo, you put it.
This girl is going to drive me mad

295
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:51,377
There's a man across the border
who will give his life for you"

296
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:58,586
But I know someone who will willingly
give up his life for me

297
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:08,992
a person whose eyes are honest
and whose words have honour...

298
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:16,401
a man who can forsake everything
for a woman's love...

299
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:27,476
a person to whom it makes no difference
that I'm a Pakistani and he's an Indian

300
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:34,415
Who're you talking about?
What've you been up to?

301
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,888
Tell me the truth... swear on me!

302
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:43,490
He hasn't even touched me Ma,
but I have lost my heart and soul to him

303
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:49,299
don't you know your father?
Till now he's not talking to you

304
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:53,610
If he finds out about this he'll kill you!
Don't you realise?

305
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,712
You're getting engaged today!
You're going to be married soon

306
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,812
Now it's wrong to think of
anything else zaara

307
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:06,981
Oh Stupid girl, love is only found
in books, and poetry! Not in life

308
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,826
That's what I thought until now...
until now...

309
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:21,502
Shabbo please put some sense into her,
otherwise a storm will hit this house

310
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:29,043
just understand one thing zaara.
Your future is with raza

311
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,139
Now neither you can
change this, nor God

312
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,486
What's all this zaara...?

313
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:41,215
It's love Shabbo

314
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:44,826
It doesn't come with reason

315
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:34,968
Sit

316
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:47,691
Since you're my only child
I've given you a lot of freedom

317
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,695
You've been brought up more like
a son than a daughter

318
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:57,966
Normally a mother explains
a daughter's duties to her

319
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:05,169
But since I think of you as my son,
I myself shall do the honours

320
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,106
You're aware...

321
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,944
that your grandfather was one
of the most respected politicians of Pakistan

322
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:19,689
But he died just a few days before
he could reach the pinnacle of his success

323
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:25,994
Ever since...

324
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:31,601
being his successor I've been trying to
get his party to that same level

325
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:38,966
I've been unsuccessful so far.
But now thanks to raza's father...

326
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:41,376
success seems near

327
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:50,819
In a few days you'll be going to their
house, taking my honour with you.

328
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,325
That's your duty to understand
the sensitivity of this bond...

329
00:34:58,195 --> 00:35:00,425
...to spread
happiness in good times and bad...

330
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:03,966
to strengthen the bonds of
every relationship

331
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:09,131
and no matter what, safeguard
their honour as well as ours

332
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:15,274
any small mistake on your part
can destroy everything

333
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,543
I hope you understand what I'm saying

334
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,408
Yes

335
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,578
do you have anything to say?

336
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,259
Then would you please come here?

337
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:41,531
It's been a long time since I've
seen the dimples of your cheeks

338
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:46,135
I hope you haven't
left them in India

339
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:50,178
That's my girl

340
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:05,391
"dearest behold..."

341
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:10,556
"The distances have gone"

342
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:23,906
"I am here, here, here and here"

343
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:19,132
"Beyond all borders and encumbrances"

344
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:25,806
"I am here, here, here and here"

345
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:54,093
"I am the secret you can never hide"

346
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:59,841
"I am the gesture you can never forget"

347
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:10,179
"Why are you surprised
at these vibrations"

348
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:15,517
"Because I am the sound of your heart"

349
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:20,887
"Listen, if you can to the
rhythms of your heart"

350
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:25,865
"I'm here, here, here and here"

351
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:33,201
"Beyond all borders and encumbrances,
here I am..."

352
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:37,904
"here, here and here"

353
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:17,009
"I and only I am now
in your thoughts"

354
00:39:17,387 --> 00:39:22,654
"I am in all your questions
and your answers"

355
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:33,329
"I occupy all your dreams"

356
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:38,634
"I am in the radiance of your sight"

357
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:44,005
"You can see me wherever
your vision goes"

358
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:49,083
"I am here, here, here and here"

359
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:51,978
"dearest behold..."

360
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,723
"the distances have gone"

361
00:39:54,925 --> 00:40:00,022
"I am here, here, here and here"

362
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:12,399
"Beyond all borders and encumbrances
I am here, here, here and here"

363
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:46,669
Tell him to get out of my sight!
I see him everywhere

364
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:50,772
He's embedded in my soul Shabbo!
Ask him to leave

365
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:55,850
Please tell him Shabbo
...please tell him

366
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,024
Yes, Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh

367
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:16,767
Hello, captain Veer Singh?
I'm Shabbo speaking...

368
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:21,343
Shabbo...? I'm sorry I can't place you

369
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,082
I'm calling from zaara's house

370
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:38,194
an unknown girl whom I'd never met
before, was giving me...

371
00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:45,192
the biggest news of my life.
She very simply told me that...

372
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:50,630
zaara is in love with you and she's
about to get married

373
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:54,104
come to Lahore, take zaara away

374
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,179
She'll never be able to take
this step all by herself

375
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:01,112
She says that you can give
your life for her

376
00:42:02,252 --> 00:42:04,243
and then she asked me
one last question

377
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,255
How much do you love zaara?

378
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:15,395
How much do you love zaara?

379
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:20,097
I didn't have an answer
to that question then

380
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,602
Neither do I have one now

381
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:26,567
How much do I love zaara

382
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:29,871
I don't know

383
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:31,845
I know

384
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:40,185
an Indian air Force Pilot
is not permitted to come to Pakistan

385
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:47,154
So I know that the minute
you got this news...

386
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:52,293
you resigned knowing fully well
that you will never be able to rejoin

387
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:58,065
Then without telling anyone
you left for Lahore...

388
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:06,442
not knowing the outcome of the journey.
Would you reach on time?

389
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:13,185
Would you meet zaara?
Would zaara come back with you?

390
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:20,788
Or would you yourself be able to return
...you didn't know anything

391
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,894
But you still left?

392
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:30,132
perhaps you don't know,
but I know...

393
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:35,402
how much you love zaara,
I know

394
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:02,804
Welcome sir, I'm Shabbo

395
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,115
I'm sorry I couldn't arrange for
anything better than this

396
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:28,788
Wow, you can see
the entire city from here

397
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,869
There can't be a better room than this
in the whole of Lahore

398
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,867
I didn't tell zaara
that you're coming

399
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:46,072
I was scared that
she would stop me

400
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,878
day after tomorrow is her wedding.
She can't come out of her house

401
00:44:51,988 --> 00:44:53,956
But tomorrow she'll be going
to the shrine with everyone

402
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:59,987
This is Munir, my younger brother.
He'll bring you to the shrine

403
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,423
Then we'll leave it to God

404
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,362
So Munir, my fate is in
your hands now

405
00:45:08,638 --> 00:45:10,606
Well, I'll leave

406
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:11,774
Leaving...?

407
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,209
I got to leave, if I'm away for long
they'll start wondering where I am

408
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,576
If you need anything Munir's here

409
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:22,776
Thank you Shabbo

410
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:32,186
I didn't think you'd come,
but now after meeting you...

411
00:45:32,662 --> 00:45:36,530
I'm sure you'll take zaara with you

412
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:39,893
How could I not come?

413
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:44,599
My Babuji says, true love happens
only once in a lifetime

414
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:51,277
and when it does
no God or allah can come in its way

415
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:58,749
Tomorrow we'll know how true
my love is in allah's eyes

416
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:06,628
"I have broken all the
barriers of society"

417
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:16,963
"I have left the world
and come to you"

418
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:26,779
"a besotted lover has
come to your door"

419
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:31,316
"Has come, has come...
- a besotted lover has come"

420
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:40,155
"a besotted lover has
come to your door"

421
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:44,565
"Besotted by you, besotted
by you, besotted by you..."

422
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:53,469
"a besotted lover has come
to your door"

423
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,645
"He is completely devoted to you"

424
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:57,813
"He is completely obsessed by you"

425
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:06,852
"He will die for your love"

426
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:15,590
"a besotted lover has
come to your door"

427
00:47:31,047 --> 00:47:32,639
"If I see your face"

428
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,812
"I will forget all my sorrows"

429
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:43,783
"These tears that are flowing,
- This is all they are saying"

430
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,324
"You are beyond where I am
But I have come here"

431
00:47:48,598 --> 00:48:00,408
"If I could have one favour
just a glance from your eyes"

432
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:09,415
"I would give my breath and heart
I would give my entire life"

433
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,959
"Like the moth dies on the flame..."

434
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:26,598
"a besotted lover has
come to your door"

435
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:21,818
"What a turn this story has taken"

436
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:33,797
"He has to die for your love
- What a turn this story has taken"

437
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:03,298
He's conscious
but he doesn't want to be

438
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,967
He's listening to everything
but he doesn't want to hear

439
00:50:08,104 --> 00:50:14,475
He's festering the shock deep within
as if he's punishing himself

440
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:23,312
The next 24 hours are very critical.
He may not be able to take another shock

441
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:29,488
The nurse is here and I will keep coming
every three or four hours

442
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:45,004
don't worry, sister-in-law,
they were all our own people

443
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,343
Thank allah that the news hasn't
spread in the city

444
00:50:49,445 --> 00:50:52,846
anyway tomorrow after the wedding
all the wagging tongues will stop

445
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:58,010
after all that's happened
raza's still ready to get married?

446
00:50:58,154 --> 00:51:01,954
Mariam Ma'am, this marriage is not only
between raza and zaara

447
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:08,021
There's a very deep and a serious pact
behind it. It's on this foundation...

448
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:13,299
that your husband's and after him
raza's career rests

449
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:20,902
raza is very well aware of this.
Now zaara has to understand this...

450
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:23,979
if this wedding doesn't
take place tomorrow, then...

451
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:31,985
jehangir Hayaat Khan's daughter's name
will be linked to an Indian man forever

452
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,824
Mr. Khan's years of hard work
will be ruined...

453
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:41,088
he'd lose the elections for sure and
he'll face a lifetime of disgrace

454
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:48,331
He will not be able to bear
the weight of that shame...

455
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:54,172
he won't be able to bear it

456
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,087
prepare for the wedding, Brother abdul

457
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:10,756
Tomorrow there will be a wedding
in this house

458
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,598
Where're you going?

459
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,442
To zaara's house...

460
00:52:27,243 --> 00:52:30,110
Please don't go anywhere!
Let tonight pass

461
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:34,777
raza is looking for you everywhere!
The house is completely silent

462
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:39,053
You can't go there and do anything.
Abbaji is in deep shock

463
00:52:39,255 --> 00:52:42,622
I am the cause for the shock
and the solution

464
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,794
I hadn't come here just to see
zaara's face

465
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:52,298
If nobody speaks,
there's bound to be silence

466
00:52:53,937 --> 00:53:01,469
Someone has to make the first move,
whether it brings on a storm or a wedding

467
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:05,667
My name is Mariam Hayaat Khan.
I'm zaara's mother

468
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:12,545
But perhaps today I have lost
the right to call her my own...

469
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:16,381
because my daughter's
not mine anymore

470
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:21,216
She's yours now

471
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,229
I've come to ask you to give
my daughter back to me

472
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:34,400
please give us back our daughter!
Otherwise her father will die

473
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:44,410
He won't be able to bear the shame,
he'll die

474
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:56,750
I've heard that you save lives...
you're the one who saved zaara's life

475
00:54:58,961 --> 00:55:03,421
So now please save her
father's life

476
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:11,439
I beg of you, please save his life

477
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:16,111
Else he'll die...

478
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,108
he'll die...

479
00:55:23,419 --> 00:55:28,447
a mother never has to beg to her son,
she just has to order

480
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:36,330
zaara has always and will
always belong to you

481
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:45,202
did you think that I would've taken
zaara away without your permission?

482
00:55:49,178 --> 00:55:57,381
People say that love is blind,
so we were also blinded by our love

483
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:04,119
We could only see each other
We didn't see if we were harming anyone...

484
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:09,295
hurting anyone or...

485
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,426
if someone's life was at stake...

486
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,201
we couldn't see anything

487
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:19,165
But now everything's clear

488
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:29,841
Love can't be more important
than someone's life. Don't you worry...

489
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:37,184
zaara will marry the person
of her parent's choice

490
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:42,722
You prepare for the wedding.
I'll talk to zaara

491
00:56:46,802 --> 00:56:53,366
I promise you that she will
willingly agree to the marriage

492
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:06,548
Is every son from
your country like you?

493
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,885
I don't know that

494
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:18,728
But yes every mother in my country
is exactly like you

495
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,158
If you think that I've made
a wrong decision...

496
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:25,325
then just tell me. No one will be able
to stop me from taking you to India

497
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:34,509
Your decision is absolutely right

498
00:58:36,712 --> 00:58:39,180
This has happened because of
one silly mistake on my part

499
00:58:40,883 --> 00:58:44,512
I'd made a promise to myself
that I won't break

500
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:47,848
If only I'd been able to stop myself
when I saw you yesterday...

501
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:48,682
That...

502
00:58:50,893 --> 00:58:54,522
one silly mistake of yours will heIp
get me through the rest of my life

503
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:04,533
If you'd taken that away from me
then what would I take back with me?

504
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,542
Why is God doing this to us?

505
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,881
I've never done anything wrong
in my life

506
00:59:13,749 --> 00:59:15,876
So why is he punishing me like this...?

507
00:59:24,593 --> 00:59:28,791
I'm keeping two moments of
your life with me

508
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,402
and I'm giving two moments
of my life to you

509
00:59:37,606 --> 00:59:39,574
These two moments are the symbol
of our love

510
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,907
These two moments make our love story

511
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:49,418
Now we'll live our lives on
these two moments...

512
00:59:53,622 --> 00:59:58,491
but with a smile

513
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:04,599
Neither will our love weaken

514
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,462
Nor will our duties
remain unfulfilled

515
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:20,648
You'll honour your parents
by being a good wife

516
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:27,318
and I'll fulfill Bauji's dreams
back in the village

517
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:37,132
and after you've had
eight-ten children...

518
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:39,496
you bring everyone along
for a visit

519
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:48,475
I'll take you for a ride on a cycle
and show you a new village

520
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:56,311
But after having eight-ten kids
I won't be able to sit on a cycle

521
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:05,293
Yes, you've got a point.
Then I'll arrange for a tractor
