1
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,301
One early morning

2
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,139
Lifting the dark misty veil
of the night

3
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,472
From its pillow of its mountain peak
the Sun rose and saw...

4
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:53,483
The valley is filled with the
season of love

5
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,984
and the branches of memories
have sprouted...

6
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,153
innumerable blossoms of moments past

7
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,752
Unspoken, unheard yearnings

8
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,988
Half asleep, half awake

9
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,490
Look out sleepily at life

10
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:13,165
as it flows in wave after wave

11
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:17,331
at once new. Also the same

12
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:25,515
Yes the very same life
Which encompasses love and desire

13
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,019
Meeting and also parting and a sense...

14
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:37,853
that time is flowing like a river,
whispering as it flows...

15
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,859
that the valley is filled
with the season of love

16
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,195
and the branches of memories
have sprouted...

17
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:48,033
innumerable blossoms of moments past

18
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:11,424
"Why is the wind singing today?"

19
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:34,413
"Why is the wind singing"

20
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:39,081
"Why is the season raining colours"

21
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:43,926
"My heart wonders What is going
to happen today"

22
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,590
"Why is there moonlight in the day"

23
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:53,261
"Which way is life moving"

24
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,936
"My heart wonders what are these
events foretelling"

25
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:07,951
"Why is the wind singing today"

26
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:38,642
"Whose face am I seeing
in every flower"

27
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:52,329
"Whose face do I see in every flower"

28
00:03:52,532 --> 00:04:01,338
"Whose unheard voice is in my ears"

29
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,940
"Whose are these sounds..."

30
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:11,306
"vibrating in my dreams"

31
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:15,578
"My heart wonders
Whose arrival is awaited"

32
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,986
"Why is the wind singing..."

33
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,254
"singing, singing"

34
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:49,111
Today your dream is coming true papa,
today your daughter begins her first case

35
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,109
You devoted your entire life
for truth and human rights

36
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,787
Today I am taking my first step
into the same battlefield

37
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:04,794
as always, I'm taking your faith
and blessings with me

38
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:36,654
Karim Khan do you know how to cook?

39
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,998
No Sir the wife cooks

40
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,502
Better start learning. Now women have
started doing men's jobs. Never know...

41
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,167
when you'll have to sleep
on an empty stomach

42
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,011
Now may I meet the Indian prisoner?

43
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:59,682
Most certainly! Now you have
the right to, Madam Lawyer

44
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,346
come, I'll escort you myself

45
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:07,014
That way I'll get to spend a
little more time with you

46
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,858
Shall we?

47
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:14,196
Excuse me Madam, but you're
wasting your time

48
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:22,364
This man is here for 22 years but
no one's heard him utter a single word

49
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:27,207
We think he is very happy here,
never fights, never complains...

50
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,208
seems like he doesn't want
to be free at all

51
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,546
Freedom is every man's birthright and
it's my duty to see that he gets it

52
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,215
You do your duty and let me do mine

53
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,554
Hey Seven Eighty Six...
Oye, look who's come to meet you

54
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:52,227
You imbecile, Madam Lawyer is here,
at least greet her

55
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:57,735
The State of Pakistan has decided to
reopen cases of some Indian prisoners

56
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:02,744
So find your lost voice quickly
and start blabbering

57
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,247
This opportunity won't come again

58
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,084
What did I tell you?
- Open the cell

59
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,490
I want to speak to him alone

60
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,591
Well, you've signed the papers,
what do I care

61
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,101
aye Karim Khan keep an eye on her

62
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,706
There

63
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:37,105
I've done my duty now
it's up to you and your God

64
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,135
Let's begin with names

65
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,639
I'm Saamiya Siddique and you are...?

66
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,640
Do you want me to call you?
Seven Eighty Six like the others do?

67
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,641
Your name can't be so unpleasant
that you prefer a number to it?

68
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:20,826
Veer Pratap Singh

69
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,166
It's ages since you've heard
your name, isn't it?

70
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,332
Please talk to me Veer Pratap Singh,
I've come to help you

71
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:47,641
Twenty two years ago you remained silent
and no one could defend you

72
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:53,087
Today God is giving you another chance.
Talk to me...

73
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,685
and I promise to get you
back to your country

74
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,861
please talk to me

75
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:13,870
I don't know why you don't want
your freedom. But I want you to know why...

76
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,481
your freedom is important for me
and other girls of this country

77
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:24,213
My father fought his entire life
for women's empowerment in Pakistan

78
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:29,224
But he could not do
as much as he wanted to

79
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:35,227
Today, after years of hard work,
I have earned my first case

80
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:44,072
But everyone knows it's impossible to
win this case. They want me to lose...

81
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:49,403
so that no woman will tread into
this male domain again

82
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,751
But I'm not going to lose

83
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,920
I will not let down my father's dream.
Or the women of my country

84
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:05,923
I just need your help.
Talk to me...

85
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,092
Please talk to me

86
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,098
Talk to me Veer Pratap Singh

87
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:56,471
That's an F 16
flying at the speed of 1200mph

88
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:06,985
When a plane tears through the skies,
plays with the clouds...

89
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:13,655
no one but a pilot can
understand that feeling

90
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:30,843
I can still feel my hands throbbing,
the blood rushing and the winds lashing...

91
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,586
when I used to take my helicopter...

92
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:42,187
into the mountains

93
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,383
ahead... left...

94
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,386
Help...

95
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,385
Let's go get them

96
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,256
This was me and this was my life

97
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:51,086
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh,
a rescue pilot with the Indian air Force

98
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,429
I loved my work

99
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,433
Flying was a childhood fantasy.
And saving people's lives...

100
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:03,271
was my father's legacy.
He was an army officer...

101
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,109
who gave his life for the country

102
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:07,942
I was alone and free

103
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,938
and I lived every moment
as if it were the last

104
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,787
Little did I know that
three days later...

105
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:20,952
my life was going to change
because of a girl

106
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:26,291
a girl who was then sound
asleep in Pakistan

107
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,137
Wake up, zaara.
It's seven o'clock

108
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:39,471
Seven! I've never woken up this early
- Whatever has not happened till now...

109
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:43,975
will begin from today.
Yesterday your marriage got fixed

110
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,978
Now you're just a guest here
for some time

111
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,320
Soon you'll have to go to
your husband's house

112
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,319
Your mother wants you to
change your habits

113
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,424
Wake up every morning at seven,
make your own bed

114
00:14:54,693 --> 00:15:00,495
Then learn cooking from Iqbal chacha...
- I'm not going to change for anyone

115
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,494
I am who I am, tell them that

116
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:07,160
aahaa, your cool attitude
won't work anymore

117
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,501
You're lucky they've chosen you
because of your beauty

118
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,110
I hope your manners won't turn
them away. Or you'll be a spinster for life

119
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:32,194
"I am the way I am and I will always be"

120
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:56,544
"Whether someone is happy,
Or even if they are unhappy"

121
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:01,055
"I will never change my style"

122
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:05,386
"Whether they understand or
they don't I will keep saying"

123
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:15,071
"I am the way I am
and I will always be"

124
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:57,605
"I am the princess of my feelings
and the queen of my mind"

125
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:11,524
"Why should I wear a veil
If the scarf drops, so let it"

126
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:16,257
"Whether they smile of they pout."

127
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,995
"It does not bother me if
What I say causes a rift"

128
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:30,342
"I am the way I am
and I will always be"

129
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,093
"I have no desire to adorn my palms with
henna"

130
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,029
"Or to hear the wedding flute play."

131
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,142
"I am quite happy
in my own home, thank you"

132
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:41,042
"If you can hear me O priest,
let me clarify"

133
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:45,383
"I don't know that
I will ever agree to marriage"

134
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:54,727
"I am the way I am
and I will always be"

135
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,685
dr Yusuf, is everything all right?

136
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:55,125
Just pray. Now there's no time
to take her to the hospital

137
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,123
She's repeatedly asking for zaara

138
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:04,299
Yusuf, I'm zaara's mother
but it's Bebe who brought her up

139
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:05,962
Where is zaara?

140
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:10,134
She's gone to the temple
to get holy water for Bebe

141
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,470
I'll break this news to zaara,
no one will say anything to her

142
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,331
zaara, is that you?

143
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,832
Yes Bebe, your zaara has come and look
what she's got for you. The priest...

144
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,669
sent special holy water for you and...
I know little one...

145
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,180
no holy water will
help me now. - Bebe...

146
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,748
Since you were a child you have been
chattering non stop

147
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:59,221
and I have been listening. Today I'm
going to speak. And you'll only listen

148
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:09,296
You know that I've been here
ever since the inception of Pakistan

149
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:16,098
I was 16 years old when your
grandfather left India...

150
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,209
and he came to Pakistan
and he brought me along with him

151
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:25,380
Your family, this country has given me lots
and I took it all with all my heart

152
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:32,554
But today I've this one last wish,
will you fulfill it?

153
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:39,257
Lmmerse my ashes in my India,
dear child

154
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:46,799
I may be an orphan but I am an Indian,
that's my only identity

155
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,398
I told you about Kiritpur haven't I?
For us Sikhas...

156
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,138
it's a very important pilgrimage.
All my ancestors are there.

157
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:02,417
Just immerse me there.
I will get my refuge.

158
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,255
You'll do this for me?

159
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,723
No.

160
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,390
There's going to be no need
to do any such thing.

161
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,260
All our Visas to go to
delhi are ready.

162
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:24,532
You just get well soon.
Then we'll both go to your Kiritpur

163
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,143
and you can pray there to
your heart's content

164
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,212
Bebe...

165
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,614
Now quickly drink this holy water

166
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,511
She was here in Pakistan
and you in India.

167
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,917
Then how and when did
the two of you meet?

168
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,490
Three... three days later...

169
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:29,133
and what an unusual meeting it was...

170
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,872
a bus had toppled over
in the mountains.

171
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:41,515
There were no serious casualties.
All passengers were rescued.

172
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:48,356
And I was on my way down
to bring the last girl up.

173
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:18,915
Pull us up.

174
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,555
It wasn't that I'd never seen
a more beautiful girl than her.

175
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,731
But I don't know why
I couldn't take my eyes off her.

176
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,334
Her eyes were lowered
and she was breathing heavily.

177
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,577
She was very scared.

178
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,246
A tendril of hair was bothering
her right eye.

179
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:51,586
She was trying to move it, but the wind
was strong and the hair stayed there.

180
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,982
As I lifted my hand from
her waist to move the hair...

181
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,253
she looked at me in fear.

182
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:03,160
We looked at each other
for the first time.

183
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,096
She kept staring at me scared...

184
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,598
then she lowered her gaze, but...

185
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,940
I kept staring at her...
and then my dream was broken...

186
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,507
Stop... stop... stop.

187
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,619
Ranjit. Stop.

188
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,445
What happened?

189
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,185
What happened?
- My bag has fallen down.

190
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,792
Please take me down.
It's only a bag ma'am let it go.

191
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,793
I can't let it go
that bag is very invaluable to me.

192
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,625
Not more valuable than all our lives?
- Yes it is.

193
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,428
Now will you please
take me down or should I go myself?

194
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,638
My bag.

195
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,136
Stop it.

196
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,304
Ranjit take it down.
- Veer have you gone mad?

197
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,999
Do as I say. Take us down.

198
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:57,647
Here.

199
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,679
Ranjit, pull us up.

200
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,535
You endangered the lives
of so many people for a little bag.

201
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:26,484
What kind are you? You know we risk
our lives everyday to save lives...

202
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,484
of people who are complete strangers,
who aren't related to us in any way

203
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,086
But still on our way home our hearts
swell with pride...

204
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,561
that we saved someone's
sister, wife, brother or mother...

205
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,989
gave someone a new life. But today
for the first time in so many years...

206
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,866
I'm doubting my work

207
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:49,102
For the first time sacrificing my life for
someone else is seeming worthless...

208
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,103
is seeming wrong

209
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,103
I'm sorry ma'am
but it was disgusting

210
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:07,289
Get out! I don't want to see your face.
Who asked you to give zaara your money?

211
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:13,558
You know I can't say no to zaara.
Even if I did she would've taken it forcibly

212
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:17,064
and she's not off to the market
to buy bangles, but to India...

213
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:22,128
wasn't important enough to tell me?
She made me pledge our friendship

214
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,400
Pledge of friendship!
There's a limit to childishness.

215
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:31,612
Who got her onto the bus? Call akram.
Call him immediately. How irresponsible.

216
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,248
Zaara... zaara are you all right?

217
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,186
Ma, I'm perfectly all right,
please don't worry

218
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:44,861
What is this nonsense zaara,
do you know what I'm going through?

219
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:49,456
Only when I was going to the police
that this godforsaken Shabbo told me

220
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,266
just come back home right away
...come home immediately

221
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:57,874
Ma, the border closes at four thirty
and I haven't even reached Kiritpur yet

222
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:02,336
God, for what sin am I being punished
...now it's about to be evening...

223
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:08,279
Why did you go alone? I promised you
that I would send the ashes to India

224
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:12,445
I also promised Bebe
that I would take her ashes myself.

225
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:16,354
Zaara is this a little trip from Lahore to
Pindi that you just took off like that?

226
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,457
Have you gone mad?

227
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,686
I'm really sorry Ma.

228
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,792
But after all my explaining,
you were still unable to understand me

229
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,395
Until now, I've done nothing
really important in my life Ma

230
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,366
Nor will I be doing anything
great in the future

231
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:38,747
My life, like yours, will be spent
being a good wife and a good mother

232
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,851
But after doing this,
I will always be proud of myself...

233
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,323
That I helped someone attain salvation.

234
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:53,820
Ma, now that I've come so far, I will
return only after completing my work

235
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:58,324
But if you stay angry with me,
then my journey will get bad luck...

236
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,403
Stop it. Can a mother ever wish
bad luck on a daughter?

237
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,936
I've been crying since eight hours,
you want me to cry some more?

238
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,707
Relax Ma I'm cool.

239
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,006
Yes, you're the only one who's cool
and we're all fools

240
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:13,847
If your father returns
before you do then...

241
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:14,882
don't worry, Ma

242
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:19,015
Papa's only back next week
and I'm back tomorrow.

243
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,020
Please

244
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,019
Ma I've to hang up now,
there's a long queue

245
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,197
Listen, take care of yourself,
and don't eat any junk

246
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:30,231
and don't talk to any strangers
and keep calling me... right?

247
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:36,033
And don't be scared, my blessings
are with you... good bye...

248
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:36,764
Good bye

249
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,538
Yes how much money?

250
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,540
Why are you worrying?

251
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:44,909
Our zaara is no less than any boy.
She can get her way anywhere

252
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,778
Thank God that she's safe,
this girl scared the life out of me

253
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,919
Why're you talking to me?
I told you to get out of my sight

254
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,457
You say that all the time.
Now cool it

255
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,323
cool it my foot!
You godforsaken fool

256
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,328
Go do your work... what are you
standing like statues for? Go.

257
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,667
Ranjit, permission for my leave
has come from the base

258
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,940
Mom and dad had asked me
to come home to celebrate Lodi

259
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,803
I'll leave from here in the morning,
that way I'll reach sooner

260
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,240
Negi will accompany you back

261
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,516
Okay, see you on Monday. Enjoy...
- Thank you. Here are the logs...

262
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,754
Mister, are there any buses
to Kiritpur from here?

263
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,922
No Ma'am, no buses leaving right now.
There's one for Kiritpur at seven am

264
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,057
Then is there a hotel
where I can spend the night?

265
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:36,723
Hotel! Of course... look there's
Kake's dhabha. Our five star hotel

266
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,066
For ten rupees you'll get a blanket
for twenty five rupees you'll get a cot

267
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,838
Ok Ma'am, please excuse me,
I'm getting late. Good night

268
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:27,209
You risk your life to save
the lives of strangers

269
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,986
There can't be nobler work than that

270
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:35,116
I would not like you to stop taking
pride in your work because of me

271
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,062
That's why I've come to tell you
the reason for my behaviour

272
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,796
These are the ashes of my Bebe

273
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,467
She was an Indian...

274
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:50,737
who spent her whole life in Pakistan
serving my family...

275
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:55,144
and never asked for anything in return.
Just one dying wish...

276
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:00,679
that her ashes be immersed alongwith
her ancestors in Kiritpur

277
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,815
This is more important
to me than my life

278
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,259
perhaps you were not happy
saving my life

279
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:17,595
But I am sure you'll be proud that
you saved this urn that was in my bag

280
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,304
please try and forgive me.

281
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,674
I'm sorry.

282
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,447
Sir, here's your buttermilk.
- Thanks.

283
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,857
If only I'd drunk it in the morning,
I wouldn't have lost my temper then

284
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,491
Here's the bus

285
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,836
One by one... who has tickets?

286
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,674
I've got a ticket.

287
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:03,503
Ladies first. - No pushing.

288
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,512
Easy... easy... no crowding.

289
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:09,175
That's it. No more.
- But I've got a ticket.

290
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:13,118
Madam, here everyone has a ticket
but here it's first-come-first-sit

291
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,788
So then where do I go?
- You go up there...

292
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:25,199
Hey baldie, move on over there.
- Why should I move?

293
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,930
Is my wife your sister that you want to
sit beside her for the entire journey?

294
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:35,144
Shove, before I break your teeth.
- Sir, I was just moving.

295
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,816
You must be wondering
what am I doing here...?

296
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:52,393
Can you see that bus over there?
Actually I should've been on that bus

297
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:59,969
But I noticed you and I saw how
graciously you took this wonderful seat

298
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:06,175
I thought to myself either you are
extremely brave or extremely foolish...

299
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:10,908
to do this long journey all by yourself.
Then I realised that...

300
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,982
although I'll reach my village,
I'll be bothered throughout my journey...

301
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,579
and probably my
entire life whether...

302
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:21,649
that silly pakistani girl reached
her destination safe and sound

303
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,759
So please don't think that
I've come to help you

304
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,457
I'm simply ensuring your thoughts
don't bother me for the rest of my life

305
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:31,992
Thank you

306
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,267
Would you like to eat some nuts?

307
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,870
By the way I'm Squadron
Leader Veer Pratap Singh

308
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,206
I'm zaara, zaara Hayaat Khan

309
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,193
"Below the blue skies"

310
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,463
"The earth is prospering."

311
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:09,832
"Every season is joyful"

312
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,209
"O'my beautiful land"

313
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:19,611
"My land"

314
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:51,173
"The earth is golden, the skies are blue
and every season is colourful"

315
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:56,409
"This is my land"

316
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:02,184
"This is my land"

317
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:11,265
"The sparrow hawk calls
and the nightingale sings"

318
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:25,008
"and the monsoon clouds arrive
This is my land"

319
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:35,118
"a crow is calling on my terrace"

320
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:43,461
"a letter from my beloved will arrive"

321
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:58,441
"and there'll surely be a mention of me"

322
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:09,057
"When the wind moves like a comb
Through the fields of wheat"

323
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:15,159
"It lifts a hundred colourful scarves"

324
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:25,608
"When the water carriers
come to the well to fill their pots"

325
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,840
"Someone entrances them
with the sweet sound of his flute"

326
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:42,357
"and so at every step
a new love story is born"

327
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:53,368
"This is my land"

328
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,246
"Where children, carried on their
father's shoulders..."

329
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:42,579
"are taken to see the fair.
And treated to comic shows"

330
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,415
"and ice cream and snacks"

331
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:56,426
"and to candy and savouries"

332
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:01,934
"These innocent children
as dear as dolls"

333
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:12,940
"are entertained by their grandmothers
with fairy tales"

334
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:24,286
"This is my land"

335
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:11,369
"In my country
a guest is revered as a god"

336
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:17,673
"and no matter what land he comes from,
He becomes a part of this land"

337
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:28,350
"I have seen and understood
your country"

338
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:39,030
"I have seen and understood
your country"

339
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:44,364
"I don't know why
it all seems familiar"

340
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:53,449
"These evenings are familiar
as are these mornings"

341
00:40:53,651 --> 00:41:04,050
"Such is also my country.
Same as your land?"

342
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:09,392
"This is my land
Same as your land?"

343
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:57,981
What are these people doing?

344
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,777
These are last rites. It is done before
the ashes are immersed in the river

345
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,320
So why aren't we doing it?
- We aren't doing it because...

346
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,322
you are a Muslim.
And this is a temple of the Sikhs

347
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,685
and it's in our interest to quietly
immerse the ashes and leave from here

348
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,994
No, I want to immerse the ashes
with the complete rituals

349
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,899
Hey no, no zaara. It's like this...
some priests are fanatics

350
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,231
So you'll get insulted
and I'll get unnecessarily beaten up

351
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,671
Should I go and ask?
- No, no you don't ask.

352
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,781
You wait here. I'll ask.
- You wait right here... please

353
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,251
dear God, it's all in your blessings

354
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:45,791
I'd told you about Kiritpur, right?
Just immerse me there. I'll get refuge"

355
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,881
Is your name zaara?

356
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:05,548
Yes...

357
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:06,781
You've come from Pakistan?

358
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:07,609
Yes...

359
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,750
I've been in this temple
since forty two years

360
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,192
But I have never seen
such devotion

361
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:21,558
You've done more than
a real daughter would

362
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:25,364
It would be an honour for me
to do the last rites for your Bebe

363
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,568
come child, come with me. Come...

364
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,637
dear God, it's all in your blessings

365
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,131
come here, please

366
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,473
Now what?

367
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:14,744
Put your hand out and fulfill
Bebe's last wish with me

368
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,353
But how can I...?

369
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:22,247
Look here, neither
I nor you are Bebe's children. But...

370
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:28,690
But... if it weren't for you I wouldn't have
been able to get Bebe here so easily

371
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,262
Like me, now you too have formed
a bond with Bebe

372
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,771
So the right...

373
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,040
to perform this
final rite is just not mine, but yours too

374
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:38,933
come...

375
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:14,003
zaara... here's your bus ticket.
You'll reach atari. And from there...

376
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,112
catch a train straight to Lahore.
And here's your change

377
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,682
Have you finished eating?

378
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,085
Anything else...? - No thanks

379
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:29,153
You've already done a lot for me.
I just don't know how to thank you

380
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,754
I'm very frank about these things.
If you ask me...

381
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:36,194
I'll tell you what I really want...
- Tell me what I can do for you?

382
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:40,960
Be careful, I will ask but
you will not be able to give it

383
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:46,538
You don't know what you've done for me.
Ask for anything you want

384
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,371
It's a promise that I'll fulfill it

385
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,383
You are making a promise without
knowing the price... you might regret it

386
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,820
a Pakistani has made
a promise to an Indian

387
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:02,719
Now my country's honour is at stake.
Now even if I want to I can't back off

388
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:10,991
Please tell me what can I do for you?
- Give me this one day from your life...

389
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:14,598
What?

390
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:21,544
You drew me close into your life. You created
a bond between me and your Bebe

391
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:25,975
You're leaving me
with a lifetime of sweet memories

392
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:33,590
I want to share my world with you.
I too wish to give you memories...

393
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,586
that stay with you
for the rest of your life

394
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:45,165
I know a day is very precious to you.
But I promise that...

395
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:48,494
you'll never forget this day

396
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:59,110
I warned you that
you'd regret making this promise

397
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,226
So you fell in love with her?

398
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,573
What I felt...

399
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,942
I still can't understand...

400
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:37,145
Why I asked her for a day
I don't know... I just asked her

401
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:43,653
But yes at that time I did feel
that our acquaintance...

402
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:49,497
was not destined to end right here.
We hadn't met just to come till here

403
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:59,608
Our relationship was still incomplete,
there was still something more to happen

404
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:07,350
With this thought, the words blurted
out of my mouth...

405
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,521
and that poor girl
listened to me silently...

406
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,623
did she come with you?

407
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:23,598
Saamiya... the honour of
your pakistan was at stake

408
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,002
How could she not come?

409
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:42,307
Why have you made that strange face?
Your mother scolded you on the phone?

410
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:46,949
I'm scared of heights...
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?

411
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,418
You said this is a shorter route

412
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,989
The other way would take
half a day more...

413
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,689
so what could I do...?
- Does that mean...

414
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,628
you'll wear this scary expression
for the entire journey?

415
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,166
please smile a little
or I'll get scared too

416
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,605
Okay look, eat some nuts.
It'll take your mind off this

417
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,407
Hold out your hand... - No...

418
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:10,277
Okay open your mouth

419
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:16,342
More?

420
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:38,297
Brother Veer has come.
And there's a girl with him.

421
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:43,071
Brother Veer has come.
And there's a girl with him

422
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,046
Hey pappu's mother see our Veer has come
and has brought his fiancee with him.

423
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,310
Oh a girl won't come
just like that with her fiance.

424
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,887
Veeru must have married her,
she must be his wife.

425
00:49:54,591 --> 00:50:01,963
Maati... Maati...

426
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,604
Oh, what's happened, who died now?

427
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,401
Maati Veeru's here...

428
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:15,839
Veeru? - Yes.

429
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:19,709
And he's got his wife
along with him. - What rubbish?

430
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:23,044
My Veeru will never get married
without telling me.

431
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,950
I'm telling the truth Maati. The whole
village has come out to see them...

432
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:34,758
What the hell... let him come...
I'm not going to talk to him

433
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:41,427
Oh chaudhry Sumer Singh where the hell
are you? Where's he gone now?

434
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,558
Bauji... Maati's calling you...
- Yeah right... I heard her...

435
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:14,063
She always calls me at the wrong time.
Come here son, I'll tell you something

436
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,703
don't ever make the mistake of
getting married. If you do...

437
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,407
you won't be able to score a goal
for the rest of your life

438
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,168
all right Sir.

439
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:25,508
Oh my dear one, how many times
do I've to tell you.

440
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,411
Not to disturb me during a game.
- And how many times do I tell you...

441
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,617
if you want to die then lie down on
a bed and die... don't play...

442
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:35,656
with kids old enough to be your
grandchildren and get your bones broken

443
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,623
Let me tell you one thing.
In this entire village...

444
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,693
there's not a single player
who can compete with Sumer Singh

445
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,529
Except your son,
look what he's been up to

446
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:49,137
Veeru's come? Where...?
- But not alone. He's got married

447
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,535
What are you saying?
- Look there...

448
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,420
How're you Kamli? - Fine...

449
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,684
I'll say hi to Bauji
...your blessings, Bauji...

450
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:14,796
You son of an ass... without asking
or telling us, you got married?

451
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,191
I'll thrash you!
- Married? Who told you that?

452
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:18,492
Then who's she, my wife?
- No no...

453
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:20,135
your wife is right here.
- I'll hit you

454
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,567
Then who's she?
- You're too much Maati

455
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:25,603
Is there only one kind of relationship
between a man and a woman?

456
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:30,012
She's our guest Bauji. After saving
her in a rescue operation...

457
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,140
I got her here to show her
our village and to make her meet you

458
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,890
Of course! I understood the moment
I saw her...

459
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:45,986
such a beautiful girl with
an ass like you... impossible!

460
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:50,263
What's your name dear?
- Zaara, Sir. Zaara Hayaat Khan

461
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,496
What a lovely name, where are you
from, child?

462
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:55,095
From Pakistan

463
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,772
Oh wow, that's fantastic

464
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:00,272
then you're our extra-special guest!
Look...

465
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,335
we've served the people
of our country a lot

466
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,072
But this is our first chance to be
hospitable to our neighbouring country

467
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,978
What would you like to eat?
Should I get some butter milk?

468
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,675
Some milk some...?
- Oh enough now

469
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,718
You come with me. If you get caught up
in his chatter it'll be nightfall soon

470
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,656
Move aside...
- Okay, never mind me.

471
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,847
Make way. - Oh yes.

472
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:22,420
Oye Veeru, where're you going?
Wait a minute.

473
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:24,824
All of you get going...

474
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,525
Yes... one minute... - What?

475
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:31,540
Yes? - Well... have you got my things?

476
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,807
Yes! Here's your bottle of rum.

477
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,639
Don't drink it all alone. - No way.

478
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,543
If Maati catches you this time,
I'm not going to lie to her.

479
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:45,184
Just once more...
one last time...? - Okay last time.

480
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,219
Now go on... go.

481
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,954
Cheers to the neighbouring country.

482
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,672
Come, I'll do that.
- No, I'll manage.

483
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:09,271
The way you're making it, it's evident.
Someone else ties your hair at home.

484
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:14,845
Come, I'll make it for you.
Just feel at home. Come.

485
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,917
This's Veer's room, right? - Yes.

486
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:24,359
Whenever he'd get a medal or a photo
I'd hang it up here.

487
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,927
And when he's not at home,
then Bauji and I...

488
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:33,099
warm our eyes looking at them.
- There's a lot of love...

489
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:36,397
between the three of you. - Because
there's no one else

490
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:41,704
to share our love. His mother and father
passed away when he was really small

491
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:47,308
Since then we're the only ones for him.
We're actually his aunt and uncle.

492
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:54,213
But he calls us his father and mother.
We don't have any children of our own

493
00:54:55,158 --> 00:55:02,064
So it's just the three of us.
Look... your plait is ready

494
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:08,498
Hey! I look just like all of you.
- This is nothing.

495
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:12,230
You'll look like a true punjabi girl
tonight... tonight's Lodi

496
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:15,070
and here we celebrate it
with a lot of pomp.

497
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:18,543
I'll take out the dress.
I wore for my first Lodi for you.

498
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:22,111
No Maati, I'll wear my own clothes.
- Hey, you call me mother...

499
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,086
and at the same time argue with me?
Look you've come to our house...

500
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,589
just for a day. For this one day
at least become one of us.

501
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,044
Are you comfortable? - Yes.

502
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,111
Like I was telling you...
when I was young...

503
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,183
I used to take Maati on a cycle
like this right till amritsar.

504
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:59,346
Now she's so become so fat
that she doesn't fit on a cycle.

505
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,524
No Bauji, she's not fat at all...
- Oh you don't know... I know.

506
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,128
Veer was telling me that Maati and you
have built this village on your own

507
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:12,028
That's right. At first there were
just fields here.

508
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:15,467
Then after writing many letters
we arranged for electricity.

509
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,235
Do you see that hospital? - Yes.

510
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:20,841
That was a cow shed earlier.
...how are you doctor?

511
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,443
Doing fine Sir.
- Very well friend.

512
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:27,547
And look, the children's school.
Maati and I were the first teachers here.

513
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:32,886
No one knew how to read or write.
Now the kids study here till eighth grade.

514
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:37,719
After that the boys are sent off
to Kartarpur, for further studies.

515
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,684
And what about the girls?
- It's not possible for us...

516
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,196
to send the girls so far. And anyway
they have to learn to...

517
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,927
Iook after the household, so what use
is higher education for them?

518
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,729
That's not fair Bauji.

519
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:57,006
Not fair? What d'you mean by that?
- I hope you don't mind this Bauji...

520
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,170
what you and Maati have done
for this village...

521
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,145
would've have taken people
centuries to achieve

522
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,718
But while you made the men
capable of facing the world...

523
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:10,917
you disabled the women. That's why a
Veer has become an air Force pilot...

524
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,252
and the girls of the village remain
illiterate and unpolished

525
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:20,860
Girls today have reached the moon.
They walk shoulder to shoulder with men

526
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:26,234
With education perhaps a girl from
this village could've outdone Veer

527
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:27,706
don't you think so Bauji?

528
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:33,141
Oh chaudhry Sumer Singh...
where are you loitering?

529
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,943
Oh man... whenever I'm doing
something really important...

530
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:38,848
she comes and bugs me.
Yes Madam, now what?

531
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:42,283
It's time to light the Lodi.
Come and get ready...

532
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,388
all right, I'm coming

533
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,195
come, dear. Let's light the Lodi

534
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,145
Listen everybody...

535
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,748
come here... come on.

536
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,217
Coming Bauji.

537
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,317
Let's go there... coming

538
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,889
Listen everyone...
to what I have to say

539
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:54,223
The cricket pitch that was going
to be made here... will not happen now

540
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,226
Why...? - Why Bauji?

541
00:58:55,431 --> 00:59:00,164
Relax, I'm telling you... because now
we're building a Girls High School.

542
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,063
The girls are glad.

543
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,767
I promise you that once
this school is built...

544
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:11,869
the girls won't have to leave
the village for higher studies.

545
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:17,077
And one more thing, the first brick
for the school...

546
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:21,514
isn't going to be laid by Maati or me,
but will be laid by the girl...

547
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:25,586
because of whom this school
is being built. Miss zaara Hayaat Khan

548
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:33,600
come dear...

549
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:44,104
Bauji how can I...? - Why not?

550
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:48,481
When being so young
you've taught me such a big lesson

551
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,480
Then why can't you do
this little thing for me?

552
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,514
Come dear, come.

553
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,409
Oye Kamli.

554
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:17,671
I, Ginda Singh... I really like you.

555
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,869
O'Soumitre...
I darshan Singh aulakh.

556
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:45,770
Will die for you.

557
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:59,549
Maati is this the custom of Lodi?
- No... this's your Bauji's custom

558
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:04,048
What d'you mean?
- In our time...

559
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:09,830
romance was taboo. On top of that
I was from Madras and he from Punjab.

560
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:14,201
So one night during Lodi he asked
for my hand in front of everybody

561
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:18,073
My parents didn't know what to say.
And we got married

562
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,905
after that ever since we've come here
and started celebrating Lodi...

563
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:25,103
he's started this custom that
if a boy is in love with a girl...

564
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:29,114
he confesses his love in front of everyone.
If the girl wants to refuse...

565
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:31,616
she quietly throws a fistful of sesame
into the fire

566
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:36,383
If she wants to accept she calls out
the boy's name and breaks sugar cane

567
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,492
Then after that we get them married

568
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:41,127
Wow, this's such a
lovely custom... that means...

569
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:45,757
when the bride and the groom agree,
what's the need of a priest...?

570
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,833
Hey Saraswathi Kaur...

571
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:56,034
My lady from Madras...
I chaudhry Sumer Singh...

572
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,974
ask for your hand in marriage
for the next seven lifetimes

573
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:10,421
come on girl

574
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,355
I'll set him right

575
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,872
What... my proposal... rejected?

576
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:36,478
Maati... what're you doing?
Bauji doesn't stand a chance?

577
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:40,380
Tell him if he wants to spend
seven lifetimes with me...

578
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,922
he has to fulfill
certain promises. Is he ready?

579
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,788
Promises? What promises Maati?

580
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,920
Sorry Bauji that's it.
Now drop the sugar cane
