1
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,790
"Was that you or was that
just a fragrant wind"

2
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:38,969
"Was that you or were there
colours everywhere"

3
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:44,806
"Was that you or were those
shining pathways'

4
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:50,814
"Was that you or were those
songs resounding in the atmosphere"

5
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:55,851
"Was it you I found,
or was it my destiny"

6
00:00:56,057 --> 00:01:01,723
"Was it you or was there
magic in the air"

7
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:06,827
"just for two moments, the caravans of
our dreams made a stop"

8
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:12,335
"and then you went your way
and I went mine"

9
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,907
"just for two moments existed
the story of our hearts"

10
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:34,688
"and then you went your way
and I went mine"

11
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,231
Today's my wedding day abbaji

12
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,330
aren't you going to give me away?

13
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,908
Aren't you going to put
your hand on my head and bless me?

14
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:35,479
Please forgive me, my child

15
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:44,022
I don't know whether this
is my obligation or my weakness

16
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:50,031
Please forgive me

17
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:15,926
This is a holy amulet.
This will protect you

18
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:20,862
The moment you cross the border,
take out the coins...

19
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,264
and give them to someone needy

20
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:36,446
My religion does not permit,
but still from now on...

21
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:44,455
I'll pray to allah everyday and ask Him
to give you zaara in every other birth

22
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,306
I'm leaving...

23
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:32,502
Listen...

24
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,178
Sign here

25
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,014
What's this?

26
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,020
It says here that my name
is rajesh rathore

27
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:52,022
I work for the Indian Intelligence raW
...critical... political... secrecy...

28
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,123
sending Pakistani secrets to India...?
That's correct

29
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:59,095
No way. My name is Veer Pratap Singh,
ex-lndian air Force

30
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,301
I'd come here just two days ago to
visit somebody and now I'm going back

31
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,203
My passport's in my bag, you can check.
We've found this in your bag

32
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,809
Your name is written clearly
as rajesh rathore

33
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:11,875
Let me see

34
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,377
We have witnesses also
who can recognise you

35
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,386
What's going on,
why are you doing this?

36
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,885
Okay... you were just saying that
you were here to meet somebody

37
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:25,225
Tell us their names,
we'll call them

38
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,825
Yes... I'm...

39
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,528
I'm here...

40
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,896
Tell us

41
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,564
I didn't come to meet anybody

42
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,741
Wow, what love

43
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,509
If you take her name
she will be disgraced?

44
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:56,622
You'll ruin yourself
but won't let your love be damned

45
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:02,224
Yes Mr. Veer, this's exactly
what I expected of you

46
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:09,167
Mr. Veer, there's one thing that is
very special about both our countries

47
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,271
On the basis of power and money
anything is possible. Isn't that so?

48
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:24,648
What were you thinking?
That you could come here...

49
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:31,619
and declare your love for my wife-to-be
in front of everyone and leave...

50
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:36,421
and I'd stand aside
and watch the whole show...?

51
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:45,969
Mr. Veer I'm about to live my life
with a woman...

52
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,472
who's in love with someone else

53
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:55,305
and it's my bad luck that I can't even
back off from this marriage

54
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,149
can you imagine...

55
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:08,856
can you imagine... everyday of my life,
will be a living hell

56
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:18,495
You and zaara were the ones who dared
to love... why should I be put to test

57
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,507
Either your life should
be a living hell...

58
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,847
or zaara's,

59
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:34,354
Not mine

60
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,357
You take great pride
in your love, right?

61
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,860
So now you're being tested

62
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:56,207
I can make zaara's life heaven or hell.
But it's all in your hands

63
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:03,205
as long as you sit silently
within the four walls of a prison...

64
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:08,716
till then zaara's life
will be more beautiful than heaven

65
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:16,560
The moment you open your mouth
zaara's life will become worse than hell

66
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:23,896
Veer Pratap Singh's identity
has to be destroyed...

67
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:27,240
in order to give zaara a good life

68
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:39,245
Now this... is the true
test of love

69
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,523
I'll take your leave

70
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,095
It's time for the wedding

71
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:53,755
Either you disgrace the names of zaara
and her family and buy your freedom

72
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:58,435
Or else sign on those papers and ensure
life time of happiness for zaara

73
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:01,805
The decision is in your hands

74
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:04,937
Goodbye

75
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:24,687
"Why is there a tradition of cruelty"

76
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:31,035
"Why is the society the way it is"

77
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,536
"These traditions of this world...
I am completely overwhelmed by them"

78
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:43,274
"do not ask what my complaints are
Or why I've been given this unhappiness"

79
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,381
"What can I tell you,
Why is love a crime"

80
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:51,881
"Why does one cry
Why does this happen"

81
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,725
"Why is everyone a stranger
to his heart"

82
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:07,464
"What turn has this story taken"

83
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,403
"What sort of world is this
that we live in"

84
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,407
"Where sorrows
wear the face of happiness?"

85
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:19,412
"Whom do I call my own
and who is a stranger"

86
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:27,419
"What turn has this story taken"

87
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:35,100
Miss zaara Hayaat Khan
daughter of jehangir Hayaat Khan

88
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,100
Your marriage has been fixed
with raza Shirazi...

89
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:42,435
son of abdul Malik Shirazi at a dowry of...

90
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:49,446
five million rupees.
Do you accept this marriage?

91
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:57,113
"What turn has my story taken"

92
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,627
do you accept that your name
is rajesh rathore or no?

93
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:10,799
I accept

94
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,466
I accept

95
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:37,986
The bus that left from Lahore met with
an accident before it reached India

96
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,826
Nobody survived

97
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,329
My name was also on the
passenger list

98
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:51,242
I was happy that Maati and Bauji
would hear about my death

99
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,276
If they got the news
that I was missing...

100
00:11:56,483 --> 00:12:00,886
then they wouldn't have been able
to live or die in peace

101
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:07,016
Now in India Veer Pratap Singh
was dead and in Pakistan...

102
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,029
there was no sign of
Veer Singh left

103
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,529
Now his only identity was...

104
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:22,531
Prisoner number seven eighty six

105
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,255
Prisoner... number,

106
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,914
Seven eight six

107
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:43,554
My country owes you, twenty two years
of your life

108
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,227
I can't bring back
these twenty two years

109
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,169
But I take a vow...

110
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,510
that I won't put flowers
on my father's grave until...

111
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:02,739
Veer Pratap Singh doesn't get his name,
his identity and his country back

112
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,600
So Miss Saamiya Siddiqui,
this is your first case?

113
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,434
Yes. - Congratulations

114
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,201
Thank you sir

115
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,109
and you're defence counsel on behalf
of the Human rights commission...?

116
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,282
That's right sir.
- Good that's good

117
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,278
No one representing the prosecution?
Well Sir they should be coming.

118
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,613
May I come in sir?

119
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,649
Oh it's you Mr. zakir...

120
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,127
Good morning sir.
- Morning. Come in, take a seat

121
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:50,789
That's Mr. zakir ahmed

122
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,956
I know. I know him very well

123
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,307
Sorry Your Honour, you know
the traffic of Lahore...

124
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:06,475
zakir sa'ab, are you presenting the case
on behalf of the Government of Pakistan?

125
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,740
Yes Sir. Actually, I've not been
to court since many days

126
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:13,077
People may be thinking that zakir ahmed
has forgotten how to fight a case

127
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,746
and anyway, I think this case is
very interesting

128
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,213
What do you think Saamiya?

129
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,161
So you both know one another?

130
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:26,230
Of course! Saamiya was working
for us earlier

131
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,097
But perhaps she didn't approve
of the way we worked...

132
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,030
so she went over
to the Human rights camp

133
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:36,005
She's a very capable lady,
it'll be fun to fight the case opposite her

134
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,041
There was a special purpose
for calling both of you here

135
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:48,017
It would be better if both the parties
can have an out of court settlement

136
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,849
Otherwise the court has fixed
the date for day after tomorrow

137
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,452
But yes, if the case does not start
day after tomorrow...

138
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,187
then the next date could be
after six months or maybe even a year

139
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,527
We're ready Sir. But if the defence
needs more time then...

140
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,363
defence is ready Sir.
- But Saamiya...

141
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:09,705
Sir you can fix it for day after tomorrow.
My client has waited...

142
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,141
for twenty two years to get justice.
I can't make him wait any more

143
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,404
Okay then that's fixed

144
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,941
I thank you both for coming here

145
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,614
Good day.
- Good day, Sir

146
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:29,752
Okay Saamiya I'll see you in court.
Good day

147
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,566
This was an impossible case
right from the start

148
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,433
and now with zakir ahmed's arrival
there's absolutely no chance

149
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,741
But this case is too small
for his portfolio... I don't know why

150
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,078
I can't understand anything. Listen, just
make any excuse and drop this case

151
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:55,979
This is your first case and the way
zakir ahmed insults the opposition...

152
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,084
he'll ruin your career.
That's exactly what he wants

153
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,261
What do you mean?
Saahil, do one thing,

154
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,760
you go back to
the office & make a list of the witnesses

155
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,091
I'll be there in a while...

156
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,324
But where're you going?
- To meet zakir ahmed

157
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:09,935
What...?

158
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:19,935
Miss Saamiya Siddiqui you'd sworn that
you'd never step into my office

159
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,941
Then how could you bear
to come here today?

160
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:28,777
There's nothing like that Sir, just
my principles differed from yours

161
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:32,990
and I thought that if I could not
respect working by your principles...

162
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:39,026
then it's better that I leave.
- Interesting, very interesting

163
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,465
You've developed great principles
at a young age

164
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,304
My principles have been passed on
to me as my father's legacy

165
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,034
do you know that you're
the first person, Saamiya...

166
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:53,040
who refused to take a case
offered by zakir ahmed

167
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,146
Here people wait for years in the hope
of getting their first case

168
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:01,382
But I recognised your capability,
I chose you...

169
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,657
I ignored your age,
your inexperience...

170
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,817
and even the fact that you're a woman.
And what did you do inspite of that?

171
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:14,823
You threw the case back in my face.
It would've set a criminal free, Sir

172
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,669
and according to me
that would've been wrong

173
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,000
It's not a lawyer's job to decide
what's right or wrong. It's the court's job

174
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:25,542
a lawyer's duty is to win the case
under any circumstance. Nothing else

175
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,947
Well, that's the difference
between you and me, Sir

176
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,550
Your principle is to fight to win
and my principle is to fight for the truth

177
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:41,290
Interesting, very interesting!
So now you're giving me lessons in law

178
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,094
This was all that was left
for me to experience

179
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:49,866
Let's forget the past, otherwise we'll
keep opening up old wounds

180
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:54,036
If you've taken the trouble
to come all the way here...

181
00:17:54,241 --> 00:18:00,441
then it must be something important.
Sit. What can zakir ahmed do for you?

182
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:09,446
Look Sir, being my first case
it's obvious that...

183
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,882
I will make some mistakes...

184
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,459
and now that you're the opposition
the problems will increase

185
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,459
Because of some trifle on my part...

186
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,194
I don't want that Indian prisoner's
freedom to be revoked. Because...

187
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:29,000
he's completely innocent.
That's true. A great injustice...

188
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,736
has been done to him Sir
and he truly deserves his freedom

189
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,342
Finally you've stooped down
to our level

190
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,817
Basically you've come asking for help
to win your first case, right?

191
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:50,252
Defeating zakir ahmed takes your career
off to a flying start! No...?

192
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,597
Have you forgotten that zakir ahmed
has never lost a case as yet?

193
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,431
And now it's very important for me
to win this case...

194
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:02,173
because I want to teach a lesson to
headstrong youngsters like yourself...

195
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:07,610
the repercussions of not following
zakir ahmed's principles

196
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,110
What's the matter
Miss Saamiya Siddique?

197
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:18,288
Lost faith in your principles of truth
that you come begging for a win?

198
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:23,194
Please forgive me Sir, for a while
I thought that you were almost human

199
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,727
I just came to discuss
if there's any possibility of...

200
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,295
giving this man his freedom
without taking this case to court

201
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,972
But you mistook my humanity
to be my weakness

202
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:43,407
Now we'll meet in court.
Be prepared to lose your first case...

203
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:49,815
because now prisoner 786
is being sent to India... and...

204
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,082
neither you nor the
State of pakistan is stopping me

205
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:58,656
Interesting

206
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,160
Very interesting

207
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,503
can I ask you one question...?

208
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,571
You hadn't spoken to anyone
in all these years...

209
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,907
then why did you tell me your story?

210
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,685
You called me by my name

211
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,515
What...?

212
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:34,694
You're the first person
who didn't doubt my innocence...

213
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,869
that I am Veer Singh

214
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:46,368
The truth is that in all these years
I'd forgotten my own identity...

215
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:56,382
you reminded me of who I am, you gave me
respect by calling me by my name

216
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:01,816
Veer Pratap Singh

217
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:13,839
For a prisoner who has been insulted
for the last twenty two years...

218
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:18,904
this was a great thing!
Great thing

219
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,915
Now I'll eat some more, okay?

220
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,460
Tomorrow is our first day in court.
You remember your promise, don't you?

221
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,262
That you're going to change out of the
garb of seven eighty six and come as...

222
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,598
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh

223
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,673
No. - What?

224
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,443
Do you remember your promise?
- Of course I remember it

225
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,942
Under no circumstances am I to mention
name of zaara or the Hayaat Khan family

226
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:03,213
You keep your promise
and I'll keep mine

227
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,710
Your Honour, defence would like
to call its first witness

228
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,057
defence calls its first witness

229
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,994
defence rests Your Honour

230
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:49,752
I call upon the prosecution
to present its case

231
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,224
Your Honour...

232
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:59,735
a man has been in prison
for the past twenty two years...

233
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:06,272
and that prison is in Pakistan.
And that man...

234
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:10,413
who was imprisoned in a pakistani jail
since twenty two years is...

235
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:14,077
an Indian

236
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:23,259
Hearing this, you, me, and everyone
sitting in this courtroom...

237
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:27,695
will have tears in their eyes.
And we'll hope for some way...

238
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:32,696
that man can go back
to his country... to his home

239
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,264
Because we are human
and we've been taught...

240
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:41,277
to respect all human beings.
But Your Honour...

241
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:46,847
in a court of law what man can't
see the law can...

242
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,316
and according to the law
the State is bigger than the individual

243
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,788
and for a person who works against
the interests of the country...

244
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,985
even being sentenced to death
twenty two times is less

245
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,999
This case is as transparent as water

246
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,074
There's no question of any doubt

247
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,470
prosecution will in a matter
of just thirty minutes...

248
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,648
and with the help of just three witnesses
prove without a doubt...

249
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,983
that the defendant rajesh rathore
is not worthy...

250
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,812
of going back to his country
or his home until his dying day

251
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,212
That's all Your Honour

252
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,826
Now I call upon the defence
to present their case

253
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,097
Ms. Siddiqui, best of luck

254
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,860
Your Honour, prosecution counsel
Mr. zaheer Khan was very quick to...

255
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,031
zakir ahmed

256
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,928
say that this case
is as transparent as water

257
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,700
But Mr. zaheer Khan forgets...
Ms. Saamiya Siddique...

258
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,702
My name is zakir ahmed!
- Being called by another name once...

259
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,375
has infuriated you to such
an extent? Then just think...

260
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:20,045
if you were called by another name every
single day for twenty two years...

261
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,372
can you imagine, what would
it feel like then?

262
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:29,881
Your Honour this case is not being
fought to send an Indian back...

263
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:34,219
to his country or his home. This case
is being fought to give a man back...

264
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:38,557
his identity, his individuality...
Someone is asking you...

265
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,962
to give him back his name!
He's telling you that...

266
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:44,628
I am Veer Pratap Singh

267
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,399
ex-lndian air Force Officer
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh

268
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,904
just give me back
the respectability of my name

269
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,311
I don't want anything else

270
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,112
Maybe not in thirty minutes
like the prosecution counsel...

271
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,978
but I will definitely prove that
this man is not rajesh rathore...

272
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,886
but he is Veer Pratap Singh.
Then whether you send him to India...

273
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:09,789
or keep him in Pakistan,
that is in your hands

274
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,193
That's all Your Honour

275
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,661
Now prosecution may call upon
it's witnesses

276
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:21,767
I'd like to call upon my first witness
police Officer dilbaaz Khan...

277
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:29,479
who had arrested rajesh rathod
twenty two years ago

278
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,343
could you tell the court without
any doubt or hesitation...

279
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:38,021
who this man is?
Yes Sir, I remember very well

280
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:42,458
This man is an Indian spy.
He's an agent of raW, rajesh rathore

281
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,294
Some twenty two years ago,
anwar ali and myself...

282
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,627
we forced him to get off a bus going
from Lahore to India and arrested him

283
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,300
We had received an
intelligence report...

284
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,637
that this man was
conspiring against Pakistan.

285
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:56,467
Good

286
00:27:56,576 --> 00:28:02,310
Mr. anwar ali, can you tell me,
if you found in his bag...

287
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,983
a passport identifying him
as rajesh rathore...

288
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:09,310
then how is it possible that
this same man's ticket...

289
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,046
was booked in the name of
Veer Pratap Singh?

290
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,985
But Sir, that was the thing...

291
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:19,654
Honour, this person also had a passport
in the name of Veer Pratap Singh

292
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,331
and how could one person
have two passports?

293
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,062
For this reason our suspicion
changed to certainty

294
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,671
and after we questioned him,
he himself signed the affidavit...

295
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,676
I, rajesh rathore

296
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,741
I've being seeing him
for the last ten years

297
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,078
He was always quiet
and kept to himself

298
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,289
He never communicated with any one

299
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:51,557
But whenever a prisoner
was ill or upset...

300
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,557
he would go forth
to heal him and comfort him

301
00:28:56,903 --> 00:29:01,101
I don't know if he is
Veer Pratap Singh or rajesh rathore...

302
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,540
for me he's just 786

303
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,380
God's own man

304
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:15,918
Yes Sir, this Hindu here is
allah's noble servant

305
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:22,657
He spent twenty two years in prison.
Can't be greater punishment than this

306
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:29,227
Send him back to his homeland...

307
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,568
send him back

308
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:39,234
Looks like you, Mr. Majid Khan, have no
great love for your country Pakistan

309
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:45,410
If it were up to you then every person
who had spied upon Pakistan...

310
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:48,086
every conspirator, should be set
free by the court?

311
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:52,580
Sir, that's not what I meant...
just reply with a yes or a no

312
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,953
Mr. Majid Khan, only with
a yes or no

313
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,255
No.

314
00:29:58,464 --> 00:29:58,930
Good

315
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:00,155
Your witness

316
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,496
No questions Your Honour

317
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:15,444
The next date for this
case is after a week,

318
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,617
Before me, on Monday, 21st March

319
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,783
On that day I will hear
the defence's case

320
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,180
and immediately after that
I will give my judgement

321
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,849
defence should be ready
with their case

322
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:31,122
adjourned

323
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,086
I'll have to mention
zaara's name...

324
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,049
No...

325
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,821
please... for once...

326
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:03,154
let me bring zaara or any one person
from the Hayaat family to the court...

327
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,193
and in a moment the verdict
will swing to our favour

328
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:06,729
absolutely not...

329
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,931
Why don't you try and understand?
We're losing this case

330
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,397
The court does not have time
for prisoners like you...

331
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:20,402
in this country there are
too many prisoners and too few courts

332
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:25,339
a lot of prisoners' cases
come up after they're dead

333
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,748
You'll never get
such an opportunity again

334
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:34,618
You'll die lying right here...
you'll die! Don't you understand?

335
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,863
Zaara must be the mother
of two by now

336
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:57,440
She perhaps has a 21 year old daughter
and a 19 year old boy

337
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,917
She must've passed through all the
good and bad times of her life

338
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:09,558
Her days, her evenings must've
settled down to a fine rhythm

339
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,559
Must be a peaceful life now for zaara

340
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:24,242
and tomorrow you'll drag her to court
and in front of everyone...

341
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,468
you'll ask her
who's Veer Pratap Singh?

342
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:31,947
Questions will be raised, what is
the relationship between Veer and zaara?

343
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,415
And no one will be able
to understand the answers...

344
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,679
no one will understand

345
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,190
In an instant that raza Shirazi
will divorce her. Zaara's life...

346
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:50,769
will be ruined. She must be
living peacefully

347
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:58,307
For the last twenty two years
I have been guarding her honour

348
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:06,179
Today how can I trample upon
her honour and go home?

349
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,624
I can't do this Saamiya

350
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:20,959
and I know you won't
be able to do it either

351
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:36,312
I'm sorry, for a while being a
lawyer made me forget my humanity

352
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:38,581
I forgot...

353
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:43,245
That Veer and zaara's names
can never be taken together

354
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:53,154
Now there's only one way out...
I'll have to go to India...

355
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,896
to bring Veer Pratap Singh's
identity from his country

356
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,170
Time is short

357
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:06,710
I'm leaving.
Take care

358
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:12,240
Saamiya...

359
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:25,023
Until now this amulet has protected me,
now it will protect you

360
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,535
If I lose...

361
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:37,608
will you forgive me...?

362
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:42,812
On one condition...

363
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,313
every day you must bring me...

364
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:50,219
laddoos

365
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,151
Take care

366
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,576
Excuse me...

367
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,589
can you show me where
chaudhry Sumer Singh's house is?

368
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,095
Yes... the largest house
at the corner there...

369
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,268
that's chaudhry saab's house.
- Thanks

370
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:40,427
But who're you looking for?
For Mr. Singh and his wife...

371
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,668
It's been years since
both of them died...

372
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:52,478
But if you want to see the house
you're most welcome

373
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,009
That house is always open

374
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,785
I'm in a bit of a hurry,
please forgive me, goodbye

375
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,064
zaara, oh zaara...

376
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,744
I'm not sparing you

377
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:28,243
Hey who're you, what d'you want?

378
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:32,441
Hey why're you crying?

379
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,321
Say something, are you
deaf or what?

380
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,724
Hey Shabbo, look here's a visitor

381
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,453
and you jassi... come here

382
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,997
Oh you'll be the death of me

383
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,129
I'll tell your Ma,
you aren't studying...

384
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,075
Yes... tell me...

385
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,744
what do you want?

386
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,804
You're Shabbo...?

387
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,746
Who else can I be?

388
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,015
And she's...

389
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,347
zaara?

390
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,147
You came asking this?

391
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,923
Is she zaara Hayaat Khan?

392
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,022
How do you know this name?

393
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:25,035
She's jehangir Hayaat Khan's
daughter from Lahore?

394
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:29,941
Who are you?

395
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:39,312
After hearing about Veer's death,
zaara called off the marriage

396
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,585
abbaji himself got her divorced

397
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:51,653
zaara came here to help Bauji and Maati
...to make Veer's dream come true

398
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:59,662
raza settled overseas.
Abbaji left politics

399
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:09,676
He died two years afterwards,
a few years later Ma'am also died

400
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:14,885
The Hayaat Khan name
no longer existed

401
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:20,018
Today Bauji and Maati
are also no more

402
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,959
But she won't go back. She says...

403
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:32,560
My soul is embedded here.
Now I'll live and die here

404
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,574
Which century are these
people from Shabbo?

405
00:39:43,182 --> 00:39:49,382
There's a Veer who so easily sacrificed
twenty two years of his life...

406
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:52,721
to protect zaara's honour...

407
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:57,822
and there's zaara who spent
twenty two years of her life...

408
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:04,399
in a strange land
to keep Veer's dream alive

409
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:13,077
are they humans pretending to be Gods
or are they Gods disguised as humans?

410
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:42,797
This...

411
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:47,245
was my mother's

412
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:57,916
Twenty two years ago Mariam Hayaat Khan
had tied this amulet on an Indian...

413
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:01,183
while bidding him goodbye
so that it would protect him

414
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:08,793
That person did not reach India
but for twenty two years...

415
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:11,764
this charm has been protecting him

416
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,372
That person's name is...

417
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:19,438
Veer Pratap Singh

418
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:32,613
He's in prison, in a jail in Lahore

419
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,290
I am his lawyer

420
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:42,058
and I've come to take you to him

421
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:59,883
For the last twenty two years
God has been testing you both intensely

422
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:06,818
But now not even God
can separate zaara and Veer

423
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,558
Not even God

424
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:30,238
Mr. Saahil Farrouqi I'm asking you
where is the defence counsel?

425
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:32,183
Your Honour, she must be on her way

426
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,511
Looks like she has decided to
give up the case

427
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,017
Please begin with the proceedings

428
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,188
Irresponsible...

429
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:41,253
absolutely irresponsible of the
defence counsel not to have arrived

430
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:45,022
Mr. Saahil Farrouqi, do you have
anything to say?

431
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:50,391
Your Honour, Saamiya... I mean my
learned colleague should be here soon

432
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:51,527
There's no problem...

433
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,865
There is a problem Mr. Farrouqi,
there is a problem

434
00:42:56,742 --> 00:43:00,041
It's no small matter to waste
the court's time in this manner

435
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,547
Especially when
I had clearly specified...

436
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,217
that this day has been reserved
for the defence's case...

437
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,784
then what is the reason
for her absence from the court?

438
00:43:09,121 --> 00:43:11,885
It's obvious that the
defence does not have a case

439
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:16,554
Silence on the defendant's part and no
one appearing on behalf of the defence...

440
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:16,151
"For you, I have lived all these days"

441
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:20,150
"With my lips sealed"

442
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:29,099
"For you, I have lived all these days,
with my unshed tears"

443
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:34,503
"But in my heart,
the flames of love"

444
00:44:35,207 --> 00:44:44,115
"Have always been burning for you,
only for you"

445
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:45,405
"Life has brought me..."

446
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:50,076
"a volume of old times"

447
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:08,492
"and I am surrounded by
countless memories"

448
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:17,675
"Unasked, I have now found
all the answers I sought"

449
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,201
"Look, what I yearned for"

450
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:22,772
"and what I got"

451
00:46:23,415 --> 00:46:27,010
"But in my heart, the flames of love"

452
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:42,294
"Have always been burning for you,
only for you"

453
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:09,993
"How can I describe
the cruelty of this world"

454
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:28,505
"I was ordered that I have to live
but without you"

455
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:37,586
"Unwise are those who say that
to me you are unknown"

456
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:47,030
"So many ordeals, were heaped
on me by this world"

457
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:52,192
"But in my heart, the flames of love"

458
00:47:53,071 --> 00:48:01,103
"Have always been burning for you,
only for you"

459
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:06,376
"For you, I have lived
all these days"

460
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:10,585
"With my lips sealed"

461
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:19,886
"For you, I have lived all these days,
with my unshed tears"

462
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:31,566
"But in my heart, the flames of love,
have always been burning for you"

463
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:43,916
"Only for you"

464
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,461
zaara Hayaat Khan's testimony...

465
00:49:02,474 --> 00:49:07,207
and photographs and documents
presented by her prove that...

466
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,474
this man is not rajesh rathore
but that he is Veer Pratap Singh

467
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:20,216
and to prevent disgracing
the honour of a pakistani girl...

468
00:49:21,493 --> 00:49:23,688
Veer Pratap Singh signed
that affidavit

469
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:31,966
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh,
this court exonerates you

470
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:42,976
Go on Veer Pratap Singh, go on

471
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:47,481
You have the right to return to your
country with your head held high

472
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:57,158
and for the precious twenty two years
of your life wasted in prison...

473
00:49:58,196 --> 00:50:02,826
the State of Pakistan and this court
asks your forgiveness

474
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:08,597
If you wish to speak, you may

475
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:32,955
I prisoner number seven eighty six...

476
00:50:33,898 --> 00:50:35,866
Look through the bars of the jail

477
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:41,528
I see days months years
change to eons

478
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:48,868
From the soil of this land comes
the fragrance of my Bauji's fields

479
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:56,043
This burning sun reminds me of
my Maati's cool buttermilk

480
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:03,660
This rain brings along with it
the swings of my seasons...

481
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:09,131
this winter fills me with the warmth
of the fires of my Lodi

482
00:51:12,604 --> 00:51:20,067
They say that this is not your country
then why does it feel like mine"

483
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:29,485
He says that I am not like him
then why does he look like me...?"

484
00:51:31,623 --> 00:51:36,617
I prisoner number seven eighty six
look through the bars of the jail"

485
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:42,498
I see an angel
who has come down from heaven

486
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:48,697
She calls herself Saamiya
and she calls me Veer"

487
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:55,302
She's a complete stranger
but treats me as her own"

488
00:51:57,315 --> 00:52:01,775
Hearing her truthful words
I feel like living once more"

489
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:08,387
Hearing her promises and vows
I feel like doing something more"

490
00:52:10,662 --> 00:52:17,192
They say that she is no one of mine
then why does she fight the world for me?"

491
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:25,306
He says that I'm not like her
then why does she look like me...?"

492
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:38,478
I prisoner number seven eighty six,
look through the bars of the jail"

493
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:46,023
I see my zaara wrapped
in the colours of my village

494
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:53,235
In making my dreams come true
she has forgotten her own..."

495
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:59,173
in serving my people
she has left behind her own"

496
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:06,574
Now I feel like filling her
being with happiness

497
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,384
I feel like living
another lifetime for her

498
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:23,125
They say that my country is not hers
then why is she staying in my home"

499
00:53:24,402 --> 00:53:29,863
He says that I'm not like her
then why does she look like me..."

500
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:42,752
I prisoner number seven eighty six,
look through the bars of the jail"

501
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:30,926
Saamiya

502
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:34,271
congratulations

503
00:54:36,808 --> 00:54:37,433
Thank you

504
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:42,540
This was my last case

505
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:46,343
I'm giving up law

506
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,449
Because you've taught me that
I'm not fit for this work

507
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:57,457
I always thought that
a country's progress is measured...

508
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:02,226
to it's judicial system.
But now I understand that...

509
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:07,036
the future of both these countries is
in the hands of youngsters like you...

510
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:13,974
who do not measure humans as
big-small, man-woman, Hindu-Muslim...

511
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:21,812
who don't rake up bitter war memories
of 1947-1965 and 1999 on every pretext

512
00:55:23,254 --> 00:55:28,419
Who wish to address the future
with the truth and only the truth...

513
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:34,828
and there's no stopping a country
where Truth prevails

514
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:39,267
Thank you Saamiya

515
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:43,534
Thank you for teaching me
the value of truth and justice

516
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:51,671
Your father would've been proud of you,
he would've been very proud

517
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:55,310
I am

518
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,179
Goodbye

519
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:48,800
Veer had lost zaara in Pakistan.
So Veer and zaara...

520
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:50,604
will be joined together
on pakistani soil

521
00:56:57,949 --> 00:57:01,350
Here take this...
make our zaara yours forever

522
00:57:21,472 --> 00:57:26,273
You said, Veer and zaara's names
can never be taken together

523
00:57:26,978 --> 00:57:31,711
Now Veer and zaara's names
have been joined together forever

524
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:37,450
What Veer says is true

525
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:42,789
You're an angel...
sent only for us by God

526
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:52,401
Go on...
Iook your country awaits you

527
00:58:12,523 --> 00:58:13,217
come zaara

528
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:16,485
Let us go home
