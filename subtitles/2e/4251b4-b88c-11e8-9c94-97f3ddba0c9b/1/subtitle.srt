13
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,834
Brother Wah, we achieved what
we have today through violence.

14
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,480
But times have changed.

15
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,597
We can't be criminals forever. Can we?

16
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,238
That's true.

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,311
Brother Wah, let me get to the point.

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,870
Your man seized my cargo at
West ShaTin two days ago.

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,919
Stop the nonsense, these matters are trivial.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,151
Brother Wah, are you
denying your involvement?

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,037
No, l accept full responsibility.

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,999
- Where's the payment?
- Your cargo can't be sold without refining.

23
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,594
We'll settle our account slowly.

24
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,069
- Next time, be careful.
- Wah, you...

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,875
A mistake on your side cost you two lives.

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,839
lt's a misunderstanding.
Brother Wah, please don't kill me.

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,035
Don't kill me.
Brother Wah, please don't kill me.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,999
- OK, l won't kill you.
- Thank you, Brother Wah.

29
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,877
Thank you, Brother Wah.

30
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,349
Brother Wah, you said you wouldn't kill me.

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,759
lt wasn't me.

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,199
Boss, how about him?

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,593
Unemployed now?
Start work for me tomorrow.

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,717
Thank you, Boss Wah.
Thank you, Boss Wah.

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,953
- Want some money?
- What do you mean?

36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,237
Nothing, l just thought you might need it.

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,629
- Any conditions?
- Forget about Cheng.

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,598
No way. l'll get him, no matter what.

39
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,799
- How dare he rape me?
- Trust me, it's for your own good.

40
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,030
For my own good? ln what way?

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,680
You'll definitely lose this case.

42
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,751
lnstead of offending the bully,

43
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,638
you'd be better off keeping the money
and winning a friend.

44
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,917
You're not the judge,
how do you know l'll definitely lose?

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,479
We'll meet in court.

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,312
Mr Lung, can't you convince her?

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,395
- Who are you?
- They are Cheng's good-for-nothings.

48
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,198
Watch your words, bitch.

49
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,998
Don't do anything foolish.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,835
Mr Lung, you have your job,
l have mine, OK?

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,792
Enough. lt's none of your business.

52
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,556
Help me.

53
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,868
Help.

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,233
Come out.

55
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,308
- Please stop. Don't hit me.
- Go back and...

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,752
Are you all right?

57
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,317
Stop pretending. You're with them.

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,556
l'm not acting.

59
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,792
Objection. Counsel is judging
the plaintiff's morals.

60
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,156
Nightclub girls make their living honestly,
it's nothing immoral.

61
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,676
ln real life, immorality doesn't cost anything.

62
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,113
Objection overruled.

63
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,998
To save time and taxpayers' money
on this case,

64
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,072
the defendant would make
a plea of no contest.

65
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,472
As the statement made
by the plaintiff is suspicious,

66
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,075
l ask your honour to acquit the defendant.

67
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,836
Legally, the defendant
hasn't raped the plaintiff.

68
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,515
Ethically, he might have made a mistake.

69
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,591
Objection. The defence is misleading.

70
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,069
The court observes law, not ethics.

71
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,392
Objection sustained.
Delete the defence counsel's last words.

72
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,517
Your Honour, l rest my case.

73
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,636
Defendant Mo Shih Cheng, please rise.

74
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,113
Before the verdict,
l must thank both the counsels.

75
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,192
The prosecution's presentation
has been terse and to the point.

76
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,196
The defence's plea of no contest
has saved the court time and money.

77
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,400
This court now finds
the defendant not guilty.

78
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,596
With no right of appeal.

79
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,195
The defendant is released forthwith.
Court dismissed.

80
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,759
Court.

81
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,596
Thank you, Lawyer Lung.

82
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,438
How could you hit him in court?
lf he doesn't sue you, the court will.

83
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,272
- l know.
- Why did you do it?

84
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,715
Are you my boss or my assistant?

85
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,109
l'm your assistant hired by your boss.

86
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,749
- Where are you going?
- Court 2, a wife-beating case.

87
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,193
- After that?
- Lunch.

88
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,635
l'm going for lunch too.
Should l wait for you?

89
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,316
- How about that?
- OK, see you at the entrance at 12.

90
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,998
Let's go. What were you saying?

91
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,958
l was saying that
l'm your assistant hired by your boss.

92
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,510
This isn't an appropriate time
to discuss that.

93
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,473
- Where are you going?
- Toilet.

94
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,232
- After that?
- Leave the toilet.

95
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,435
- Then?
- Guess?

96
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,669
- Go for coffee?
- OK.

97
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,069
- Don't see you much lately.
- You didn't call.

98
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,515
- l'll see you later.
- OK.

99
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,196
Casanova.

100
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,469
Let's go.

101
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,948
Boss.

102
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,713
Miss Yip, how do you do?

103
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,757
Have you thought it over seriously?

104
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,469
l don't want any compensation.
l want your factory to stop production

105
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,915
until the drainage system
has been improved.

106
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,675
Your factory keeps pouring
waste water into my fish pond.

107
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,398
My fish are nearly all dead.

108
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,516
How much is your fish farm? l'll buy it.

109
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,319
Money is not everything. l'm not selling.

110
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,597
You don't sound like
a wise businesswoman.

111
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,674
Every business has a code of ethics.
We have to look after our environment.

112
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,192
l don't understand.

113
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,955
Miss Yip, l'm a businessman.
l only care about my profit.

114
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,474
l don't care about other things.

115
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,950
Tell me the sum and l'll pay accordingly.

116
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,554
l won't stop production in my factory.

117
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,871
How much is your factory worth? l'll buy it.

118
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,791
The negotiation is over.

119
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,396
l'll apply for a court injunction
to stop your factory production.

120
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,429
See you in court then, Miss Yip.

121
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,237
Boss, l'll settle her.

122
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,155
Shut up. Get a new lawyer to play with her.

123
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,834
lt'll be a time-consuming case.

124
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,117
- Don't let the case affect our production.
- Yes.

125
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,992
- Have some tea.
- Thank you.

126
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,193
- Lawyer Mun, it's been a while.
- You hardly go to the races.

127
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,918
l've been out at sea mostly.

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,152
Let me introduce you to Miss Wen,
a lecturer in geography and ecology.

129
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,676
- She's also our main witness in the case.
- Hello.

130
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,638
This is Lawyer Lung,
he's in charge of this case.

131
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,948
- Hi.
- Hi.

132
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,592
- Lawyer Mun, let's get to the point.
- Good.

133
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,231
This is the report.

134
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,151
Lawyer Mun, can we settle this out of court?

135
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,629
Yes, your client's factory
can stop production

136
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,393
and solve the waste water problem
immediately.

137
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,550
My client can pay any
compensation but can't stop.

138
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,395
My client can pay any price
for your factory to stop.

139
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,040
Good, both our standpoints are quite clear.

140
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,478
Right. Whether we win or lose,
we'll be paid anyway.

141
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,598
What standard did you use
to determine the water quality?

142
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,070
The 1986 standard of the
Commonwealth Health Organisation.

143
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,549
Commonwealth? ls it complicated?

144
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,315
lt's not simple, or l wouldn't
have to spend years studying it.

145
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,916
True. l must take you out for dinner
so you can explain the standard to me.

146
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,118
Everything you need to know is in the report.

147
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,996
That signals the end of the meeting.

148
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,753
- l have to rush to court.
- OK.

149
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,429
- Let's go for tea sometime.
- OK.

150
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,953
- l'll go first.
- OK.

151
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,792
- l'll see her out.
- Thank you.

152
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,830
lf you attend court late,
you can do one more case.

153
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,313
- Miss Wen, where are you going now?
- The library.

154
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,470
- After that?
- Lunch.

155
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,120
Me too, should we lunch together?

156
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,438
- No.
- Why not?

157
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,478
- l'm used to eating alone.
- Me too.

158
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,028
l hate eating in a big group.

159
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,712
Should we have Japanese?

160
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,950
- No.
- How about Korean?

161
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,594
l'm not lunching with you.

162
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,274
Hey, it's just lunch.

163
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,590
No big deal.

164
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,038
Another failed attempt?

165
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,238
You should go for a big lunch
to console yourself.

166
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,078
Everything here is impressive.

167
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,038
This is a .38, similar
to the ones used by undercovers.

168
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,553
HK$700 each, ten per cent off.

169
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,549
This is a .45 Colt. Your comrades
should be familiar with this.

170
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,312
HK$1200 each. l have more.

171
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,276
This is top. M1 17 automatic rifle.

172
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,874
One cartridge can fire 15 bullets. Nonstop.

173
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,349
lf the cops see you with this, they'll run.

174
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,795
- ls it convincing?
- Let me show you.

175
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,428
The sound and the sparks make it look real.

176
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,512
- l want them all.
- Thank you.

177
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,715
Less 20 per cent, HK$77,000.

178
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,111
Fatty, what do you want?

179
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,510
Sorry, cash. No credit.

180
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,875
Hey, we were referred by Big Brother Seng.

181
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,997
l even sold him some
grenades without a discount.

182
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,514
lf we had HK$77,000,
we wouldn't need to rob.

183
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,676
How do you rob when you're broke?

184
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,716
l've an idea.

185
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,272
Look.

186
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,670
HK$15 each. Buy one, get one free.
Have these watermelon knives.

187
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,512
Fatty, haven't you heard
of the formidable revolutionary warriors?

188
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,190
You bastards. Trying to bully me?

189
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,475
Do you know what l did before l sold guns?

190
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,435
l was a fight instructor.

191
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,395
Hello.

192
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,109
- Wong Fei Hung, what are you doing?
- What? l just finished fighting.

193
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,510
Fighting? See you
at the usual place in half an hour.

194
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,750
What's in it for me?

195
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,274
Something rewarding.

196
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,194
ls this the reward?

197
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,158
This fish farm costs HK$10 million.

198
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,151
15 per cent commission,
isn't that rewarding?

199
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,153
- Yeah, but it's not that easy.
- l won't have called you if it was easy.

200
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,796
Get lost.

201
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,318
- Scram, now.
- Miss Yip, please calm down.

202
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,717
Don't let me see you here again
or l'll douse you with gasoline.

203
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,234
l've lots of money. l won't sell my fish farm.

204
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,953
How is it?

205
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,110
No problem. Please go back now.

206
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,314
- Hey... hey...
- You're a thief.

207
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,230
Hey, l'm Jackie.

208
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,199
Hey, don't...

209
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,474
Don't...

210
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,909
Don't you recognise me?

211
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,956
- Who are you?
- Are you blind? l'm Jackie.

212
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,474
- l can't tell.
- l'm...

213
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,758
Hey, it's me.

214
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,990
- Jackie?
- That's what l said.

215
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,157
What is it?

216
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,516
- What's happening?
- l saw someone earlier.

217
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,876
- That was me.
- What are you doing here?

218
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,916
l'm looking for the light switch.

219
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,991
Are you blind or what?

220
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,638
Here it is.

221
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,238
Do you want a coffee?

222
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,959
Why did you want to see me?

223
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,873
l want you to use your Kung Fu skills

224
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,474
to bug a house for me.

225
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,710
How could you keep fish like that?

226
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,634
No sugar, no milk.

227
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,633
That will spoil the purity of the coffee.
Don't you know?

228
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,918
l know.

229
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,516
What did you say before?

230
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,397
l wanted you to...

231
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,754
The last sentence.

232
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,035
l was asking why
you keep your fish like that.

233
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,271
The fish symbolises my life.

234
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,272
Keep going forward and never turns back.

235
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,198
- What are you here for?
- l want you to bug a house for me.

236
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,589
Let me air the room first.

237
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,320
These birds are capitalist.

238
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,794
These fish are communist.

239
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,238
They are two different ideologies.
Do you understand?

240
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,392
No, l only know
they'll eventually die in your hands.

241
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,917
- Why are you here?
- l want you to bug a house for me.

242
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,755
How could you do such an unethical thing?

243
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,554
Should l hold a knife to her neck
and ask her to tell you everything?

244
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,431
Good idea, but let's pretend
l didn't mention anything.

245
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,353
No.

246
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,834
You're my friend.
Your problem is my problem.

247
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,118
l'll help you. Why are you here?

248
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,710
l wanted you to bug a house for me.

249
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,678
Don't laugh. Are you serious?

250
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,398
lnitially.

251
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,678
This society is too pressurising.
You are mentally ill.

252
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,795
Yes.

253
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,108
- Who the hell are you looking for?
- Who are you?

254
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,318
- Why are you in my house?
- Your house? Which one?

255
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,470
Block A, 9 Lok Yeung road.

256
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,074
This is Block B, Block A is next door.

257
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,149
l'm sorry, l must have made a mistake.

258
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,871
Why are you so clumsy?

259
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,839
l'm sorry. l'm new here.
l won't be as clumsy in the future.

260
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,229
- Are you all right?
- l'm sorry.

261
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,517
- l can help you with the luggage.
- All right. Thanks a lot.

262
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,115
- l'm sorry for the inconvenience l caused.
- Don't worry, we're neighbours.

263
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,156
Stay for a while.

264
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,116
No, thank you.

265
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,510
- You want some tea?
- No, thank you. No, thank you.

266
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,715
Nothing for you?

267
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,274
No. Bye.

268
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,915
No problem, at least we met.

269
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,391
Strangers are friends you haven't met.
We'll eventually be good friends.

270
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,548
l met them yesterday to see
if we could settle out of court.

271
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,316
lf we could have settled out of court,
l wouldn't have applied for the injunction.

272
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,197
A court case could be a waste of time.

273
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,748
Did you get anything
unusual from the meeting?

274
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,748
Their lawyer asked me out to dinner.

275
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,991
That's not unusual.
A lawyer asking me out would be unusual.

276
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,276
Cousin, you shouldn't be pessimistic.

277
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,874
l'm not pessimistic, l'm just plain stupid.

278
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,748
When l was young, l was too choosy.

279
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,912
Since we're cousins, l'll be frank with you.

280
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,709
lt's really stupid
to remain choosy at your age.

281
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,916
l'm not choosy at all.

282
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,039
As long as they are healthy,
l don't care for shape or size.

283
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,111
They don't even need to have a job.

284
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,270
Ambition and responsibilty
are not important.

285
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,032
Any man would do?

286
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,712
Any man would do.

287
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,758
Yes, as long as he doesn't have a pot belly.

288
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,313
Attack! Beware of the enemy.

289
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,196
Be alert.

290
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,190
No obstacle.

291
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,028
Move in again.

292
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,472
Hey, hey. Did you accept the lawyer's date?

293
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,672
- Why not?
- Why should l accept the date?

294
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,991
At least you can find out
more about the case.

295
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,634
Right?

296
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,794
Ah Ling, l need your help here.

297
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,908
Shit, the receiver is not waterproof.

298
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,830
Hey! Are you a burglar?

299
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,350
Go and die, go and die!

300
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,115
Come back.

301
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,635
lf you slip through my fingers,
l'll catch you with my legs.

302
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,676
You can't escape.

303
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,075
What's happening?

304
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,550
- What are you doing?
- He's a burglar, l caught him stealing.

305
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,359
- Burglar!
- Go and call the police.

306
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,278
Everything is fine now.
We finally caught him.

307
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,920
Either of you could be the burglar.

308
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,833
This is Mr Wong, our new neighbour.

309
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,876
Thank you, Mr Wong.

310
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,112
Don't mention it. As neighbours,
we should look out for each other.

311
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,869
- You're too reckless.
- How is it?

312
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,315
You're on bail, let's go.

313
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,438
Do l have to go to jail? l can't go to jail.

314
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,308
- l can't even breathe here. Help me!
- OK.

315
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,278
l failed in the mission,
but you still have to help me.

316
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,918
OK, let's go.

317
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,673
- You can go now.
- Thank you.

318
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,113
Hey, let's take the lift.

319
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,670
No, l can't breathe in lifts.
l'll take the stairs.

320
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,352
OK, let's go then.

321
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,432
You go home first, l'll join you later.

322
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,352
- Hey, what a coincidence.
- Yeah, what a surprise.

323
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,910
This is Lawyer Lung,
representing Wah Chemicals.

324
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,117
- He's the one.
- Wah Chemicals.

325
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,350
This is my cousin, she owns Yip Fish Farm.

326
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,112
Nice to see you.

327
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,998
lt'd be nicer if we weren't
in the police station.

328
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,755
- Besides, we'll meet in court soon.
- That's true.

329
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,838
- Miss Wen.
- Yes?

330
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,309
- This afternoon...
- Are you asking her out?

331
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,756
- Yes, is it OK?
- Are you asking her or me?

332
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,638
lf you're asking her, look at her and ask.

333
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,472
l can't do lunch.

334
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,428
- How about dinner?
- Great.

335
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,193
May l have your contact number, please?

336
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,033
l'll call you later to make arrangements.

337
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,911
What's your phone number?

338
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,150
Bite it tight. Your hands are too busy.

339
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,310
- Thank you.
- This sofa is more comfortable.

340
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,115
Sit here, this is the most comfortable
part of the whole sofa.

341
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,668
- lt feels good here as well.
- Really?

342
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,797
lt can't be. Let me try.

343
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,552
lt's true. l've never noticed the difference.

344
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,598
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

345
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,280
- Did you spike my drink?
- What?

346
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,472
- l feel dizzy.
- lt's only just reached your stomach.

347
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,839
lt's a two-pronged attack.
Some of it has gone to my head.

348
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,358
Touch my head, is it very hot?

349
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,634
No.

350
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,917
Perhaps it's a case of self-indulgence.

351
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,036
lt's more like a case of infatuation.

352
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,399
- Hello.
- Hello.

353
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,959
- lt's Tung Te-Biu.
- What now?

354
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,395
- l'm in your room now.
- What?

355
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,959
'ln your room.'

356
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,113
Have a good rest, then. l'm with someone
right now, talk to you soon.

357
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,716
Where were we?

358
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,954
- Hello?
- lf you don't come in now, l'll come out.

359
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,238
Don't. l'll come right away. OK.

360
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,399
l've something for you.
lt's in my room, l'll go and get it.

361
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,316
Make yourself at home.

362
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,114
Hey. How did you get in?

363
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,317
- There. lt's quite easy to climb in.
- Hush, not so loud.

364
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,038
- l want to ask you something.
- What?

365
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,953
How could a righteous
and responsible man like me,

366
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,476
who is loyal to his friends
and contributes to society

367
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,235
be facing so much frustration
and psychological trauma?

368
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,675
You didn't understand my question?
l'll repeat it.

369
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,035
Jackie. Jackie.

370
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,672
A call for you.

371
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,875
Coming.

372
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,589
l'll answer your question later.
Stand back now.

373
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,390
- Here.
- 'lt's her?'

374
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,152
Thank you.

375
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,912
- Hello.
- 'Jackie, where are you?'

376
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,514
At home... Hello, hello...

377
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,269
- l thought you had something for me?
- Yeah, l'll get it.

378
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,434
Just a moment.

379
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,113
You're with the woman who sued me.

380
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,509
You don't need to bug her house to pull her.

381
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,194
Tell me honestly, what are you playing at?

382
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,236
ls my future of any importance to you?

383
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,959
Also, you've not answered my first question.

384
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,270
OK, give me one more night.

385
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,591
After tonight, you can ask
all the questions you want. OK?

386
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,353
Same way out. Go.

387
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,159
Go now.

388
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,756
- Where is it?
- l've made a mistake, it's not in my room.

389
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,718
- Can you guess what is it?
- l need to use the bathroom now.

390
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,360
Bathroom? lt's over there.

391
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,958
Hey, you haven't learnt.
You still keep your key under the mat.

392
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,476
The battery of my mobile went flat earlier.
l've good news for you.

393
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,269
l've moved next to the fish farm owner.
We're fast becoming friends.

394
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,509
You're her neighbour?

395
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,751
- One of the women is here.
- What?

396
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,188
Go and hide.

397
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,149
- Why switch off the lights?
- lsn't it more romantic like that?

398
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,032
- l prefer the lights on.
- OK then, we'll have a table lamp on.

399
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,674
Let's start our candlelit dinner.

400
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,076
- What happened?
- l'll check.

401
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,513
- What is it?
- Nothing, the dog tripped on the lamp.

402
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,990
- The dog tripped on the lamp?
- Nice coat. Where did you buy it?

403
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,668
l bought it when l was studying in Canada.

404
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,912
Good quality stuff.
l'll hang it up to avoid creases.

405
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,756
No way.

406
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,556
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

407
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,069
What is that noise?

408
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,196
- Wood creaking in the dry weather.
- Oh.

409
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,952
Let's continue our dinner.

410
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,556
The steak is delicious.

411
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,196
l forgot to replace my cupboard last week.
lt must have cracked.

412
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,236
Don't let it affect our mood. Let's eat.

413
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,955
Stupid burglar.

414
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,508
First my neighbour, now my good friend?

415
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,918
Stupid, catch me if you can.

416
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,034
The timer on my radio is switched on.
l'll turn it off.

417
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,077
- Bastard.
- You're the bastard.

418
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,230
Stop fighting.

419
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,599
- Stop fighting.
- Burglar.

420
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,796
- Burglar, your mum!
- Don't involve my mum.

421
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,632
- He's my friend.
- ls he?

422
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,836
l caught him at my neighbour's last night.

423
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,319
l asked him to bug the house.

424
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,515
- ls he your friend?
- Yes.

425
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,477
He's your friend, the woman is your friend.

426
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,357
You asked me to bug your friend.

427
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,670
You sent a friend to catch me.
Am l your friend?

428
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,672
- That's no way to treat a friend!
- Misunderstandings.

429
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,115
You two calm down, please don't fight.

430
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,998
l'll get rid of the woman now
and explain everything.

431
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,071
Hey, look at me.

432
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,116
Don't fight.

433
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,876
l won't be long.

434
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,316
Don't fight.

435
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,869
No fighting. OK?

436
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,359
- Go and die.
- You...

437
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,158
- What?
- What yourself?

438
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,632
What a nice dinner. Are you done?

439
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,830
Oh, you don't like beefsteak?
We'll have other meat next time.

440
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,354
- We should call it a day now.
- Why?

441
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,637
- l've not touched a thing yet.
- lt's fine.

442
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,273
See you soon.

443
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,717
Stop fighting. Stop it.

444
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,308
Can you two stop it?

445
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,028
Please.

446
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,399
l'm sorry.

447
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,278
- What happened to your eye?
- What did you say?

448
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,828
Really? l feel fine. Nothing happened.

449
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,309
- l forgot my coat.
- Wait here.

450
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,356
Watch out.

451
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,917
Your nose is bleeding.

452
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,959
Really? l feel fine.
You must be drunk. Bye-bye.

453
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,875
Stop.

454
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,559
Stop.

455
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,993
Where's my table?

456
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,594
Let's see. lt's there.

457
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,756
Great.

458
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,517
- Hey, what now?
- That's my line. What now?

459
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,158
l don't care what you two are doing.

460
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,993
l'm sticking
to my plan of pulling that old woman.

461
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,150
l'll get her to sell the farm
and take 20 per cent commission.

462
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,754
Money is not as valuable
as a lot of other things.

463
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,308
True. Like gold, silver and diamonds...

464
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,837
l meant righteousness,
ethics and freedom. City pig.

465
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,239
What did you call me?

466
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,470
Stop quarrelling.

467
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,793
Don't worry. When l need to l'll beg
those women to drop their charges.

468
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,279
ls it worthwhile?

469
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,318
Your comment will earn
you a bump on the head.

470
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,834
That might be worthwhile.

471
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,718
Misbehaving in public could land you in jail.

472
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,920
Are you threatening me? Look, the place
is filled with good-for-nothings.

473
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,753
Suspicious character, you better behave.

474
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,515
The world is coming to an end.
We don't have many days left.

475
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,309
l won't spend
the last few days in jail, fuck off.

476
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,233
- l'm sorry.
- Hey, how could you hire him?

477
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,072
Don't point at me like that.

478
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,674
- What do you mean by that?
- l don't mean anything.

479
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,955
Quit the meaningless blabber
in my presence.

480
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,270
lt's only because he cares about you.

481
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,271
He wasn't like that in the past.

482
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,158
You've really changed a lot.

483
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,630
Man must keep evolving
to make life interesting.

484
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,712
Not like him, asking meaningless questions.
How boring.

485
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,439
Stay calm. Drink up.

486
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,273
Have a drink. Cheers.

487
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,636
- Boss Wah, this way please.
- After you.

488
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,277
- Peace from now on.
- Jackie.

489
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,434
- Hey.
- l'm with Boss Wah, l'll introduce you.

490
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,636
OK. You go first. l'll come over later.

491
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,995
Excuse me.

492
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,517
Maybe not. Let's go together. Come on.

493
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,915
Boss Wah, let me introduce...

494
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,117
This is Jackie Lung, a partner at my firm.
He's handling your case.

495
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,510
- Boss Wah.
- Lawyer Lung, my pleasure.

496
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,637
Whether my factory stops production
all depends on you.

497
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,599
l'll try my best. They're assisting me.

498
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,397
Boss Wah, l'll serve you well.
l'm very hard-working.

499
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,517
Boss Wah, your case is in Jackie's
capable hands, you shouldn't worry.

500
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,398
That's marvellous. Be at home.

501
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,995
Boss Wah, we're collecting
evidence against our opponent.

502
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,832
Boss, something's wrong.

503
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,071
What's happening?

504
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,909
A Child Praying To Guanyin. How's that?

505
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,512
- Stop.
- Stop.

506
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,670
You're blocking my view.

507
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,160
Stop fighting. Stop.

508
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,438
Stop.

509
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,076
Let's go.

510
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,072
- Don't run.
- Forget it.

511
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,513
l'm sorry to drag you into this.

512
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,273
People always wrongly identify
me as some other bad guy.

513
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,875
Wrongly identify?
You've so many men surrounding you.

514
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,918
They're all armed as well,
you can't be good.

515
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,317
Don't go.

516
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,073
Sorry, my friend is drunk.

517
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,152
Never mind, you three are good at fighting.

518
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,712
Fortunately you're working for me.
lf you were working for my enemy...

519
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,029
Don't say that you're my man in the future.
You lot were embarrassing.

520
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,554
Boss, l didn't know
they had two new fighters.

521
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,279
Fighters? What about you lot?

522
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,035
- Get rid of the lawyer.
- That lawyer is relatively unknown.

523
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,953
How could he be unknown
when he's all brain and brawn?

524
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,759
Would it take a tattoo
on his forehead for you to notice him?

525
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,591
- That ship is beautiful.
- The one l'm taking you to is nicer.

526
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,873
Hello, they're here.

527
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,316
This way, please.

528
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,759
Mr Lung. Miss Wen.

529
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,910
Do you like it?

530
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,993
- Yeah, but it's a bit too posh.
- Nothing is too posh for you.

531
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,756
Lunch itself is boring,
we need other perks to spice things up.

532
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,115
Wow, Jackie...

533
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,757
l hope this isn't an everyday meal for you.

534
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,229
That depends on whether
l'm eating with you.

535
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,478
- l'm not used to the attention.
- l'll do it myself next time.

536
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,913
This meal must be very expensive.

537
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,710
l'm throwing all my savings into this to make
up for what happened the other night.

538
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,792
You should keep
some of your savings for other girls.

539
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,155
l'll use the interest on them. Cheers.

540
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,712
Excuse me, l need the bathroom.

541
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,951
- Please show Miss Wen to the toilet.
- OK.

542
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,598
Miss Wen, this whole ship
has been hired by Mr Lung.

543
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,319
Do you want to try the Gents?

544
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,868
- No.
- This way, then.

545
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,476
Miss Wen, please.

546
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,318
Quick. He's upstairs.

547
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,833
Hurry.

548
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,756
What are you doing?

549
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,872
He's inside.

550
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,755
Don't lose him.

551
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,239
Jackie. Jackie.

552
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,196
What's happening?

553
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,914
- Today's date ends here.
- What?

554
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,954
Let's go.

555
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,556
You're drowning the plants.

556
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,509
Miss Yip, come here, please.

557
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,710
Yes, crimebusting hero.

558
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,553
What's my reward for being a hero?

559
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,275
- Do you want a pot of flowers?
- l want to spend an evening with you.

560
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,679
ln one evening, we can eat
a lot of things and chat a lot.

561
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,149
Since we're good neighbours,
why not be good friends?

562
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,152
Friends are for betraying...

563
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,357
Fewer friends, less betrayal.

564
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,557
- l'm willing to be betrayed by you.
- Your eyes have betrayed you.

565
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,950
They're telling me you're not sincere.

566
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,235
You're only interested in women.

567
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,838
l'm interested in finding a female friend.
Trust my mouth, not my eyes.

568
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,992
Your mouth has a scar, how can l trust it?

569
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,231
This scar belongs to the nose.
Don't get it wrong.

570
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,479
Be it right or wrong,
l appreciate the invitation. Bye-bye.

571
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,996
Don't reject me.
We're only going to eat together.

572
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:11,519
Let me go. All men are alike,
they only know about food and movies.

573
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,434
l know about other things too.
l keep them in my heart.

574
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,988
l'll wait for you at the Glasshouse tonight.

575
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,752
l won't come.

576
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,400
l'll wait till you come. Don't disappoint me.

577
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,789
l won't come.

578
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,311
You must come, l'll wait forever.
l'll wait till you show up.

579
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,356
l definitely won't come.

580
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,039
He's for real.

581
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,751
- Miss, l'd like to make a call.
- Sir, l'm also making a call.

582
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,193
Take your time.

583
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,989
l'll see how long he can last.

584
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,434
Stupid man, l thought he'd wait for me
forever. All men are unreliable.

585
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,876
What are you going to do?

586
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,396
Don't look around, just turn right.

587
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,072
l asked you out and you said no.

588
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,754
Then you turned up but wouldn't come in.

589
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,752
Walk away. Wherever you go, l'll follow.

590
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,991
Actions speak louder than words
in courtship...

591
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,911
Thank you for giving me the chance.

592
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,788
l know what's on your mind.
You wanted to see if l meant what l said.

593
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,110
l said l'll wait forever and l meant it.

594
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,272
Even if you don't trust me,
you'll have more self-confidence.

595
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,999
Don't you know that you're beautiful?

596
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,669
Roly-Poly, l wasn't talking to you,
don't get carried away.

597
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,512
l was talking to the lady next to you.

598
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,549
Hey, lady in the black fur coat.
Walk slower, don't run away from me.

599
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,396
One shouldn't rush on a path of love.

600
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,596
Give others and yourself a chance.

601
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,955
lt takes two to tango. Do you get me?

602
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,112
Hey, lady with a scarf
without a black fur coat.

603
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,440
Thanks for standing still
to ponder what l've said.

604
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,272
Don't bother, it's unimportant.

605
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,193
l just wanted us to be friends,
nothing complex.

606
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,154
Are you done?

607
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,711
Don't catch a cold.

608
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,758
l'm sorry. l went too far.

609
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,037
l couldn't think of any other way
to get your attention.

610
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,438
You're a moron.
You have all the attention you want now.

611
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,476
Do l know you?

612
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,679
Where would you like to dine?

613
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,716
You decide.

614
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,919
We're going for dinner now.
Please excuse us.

615
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,471
Dinner time. Please excuse us.

616
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,959
SPRlNG ROLL RESTAURANT

617
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,550
A warm feeling rushes to my ears

618
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,791
A cupid's arrow

619
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:03,229
is turning in my heart

620
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,353
A gentle touch joins us together

621
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,991
and sets my heart racing

622
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:22,512
My love will bring you warmth and joy

623
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,720
Happiness in your heart will rise and grow

624
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,554
The warmth you feel will never fade

625
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:38,591
when our hearts are joined

626
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,074
Happiness in your heart will rise and grow

627
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,312
The warmth you feel will never fade

628
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:56,192
Love is like an electric current

629
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:04,198
My love will bring you warmth and joy

630
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,517
Tell me honestly, are you dating me
just so you can win the case?

631
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,798
What about you?
Are you seeing me for the same reason?

632
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,271
l really don't care about winning the case.

633
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,909
When l lose one, l'll win another.
l get paid either way.

634
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,595
A good girlfriend is different.
l haven't met one in ten years.

635
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,593
When l met the right one,
she could have been spoken for.

636
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,871
A good man is hard to come by too.
Most good men are married.

637
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,193
Don't stare at me. You're not a good man.

638
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,918
Because l'm not married?

639
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,792
Are you all right?

640
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,838
lt's just a kiss. Why the slap?

641
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,514
lt just happened.
What do you want to do now?

642
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,875
Yes, it just happened.
What can l do now?

643
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,115
l'm sorry.

644
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,235
OK, you can slap me again.

645
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,073
You can even pull a knife on me.

646
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,309
Hit me one more time.

647
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,558
lt's boring to catch your own fish.

648
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,673
The pleasure of fishing
doesn't depend on getting the fish...

649
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,116
- lt depends on eating the fish?
- No.

650
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,715
The time you spend
waiting patiently for the fish...

651
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,634
That peace of mind you get
is pure pleasure.

652
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,235
Why do fishermen
have so many wrinkles then?

653
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,551
lf you're going to be difficult,
l won't talk to you.

654
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,075
Have you thought of selling the fish farm?

655
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,071
Why?

656
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,039
Sell it and come to Australia with me.
We'll open a dairy farm there.

657
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,351
We'll spend our time milking the cows...

658
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,638
Don't worry, we'll spend
most of our time on horseback,

659
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,950
riding on the emerald pastures,

660
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,875
looking out over the horizon.

661
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:31,799
Riding over the mountains,
free like a floating cloud

662
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:38,831
The freedom in the mountains
reflects peace in the city

663
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:44,995
The beauty of the crescent moon

664
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,992
Reflects peace in the city

665
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,917
ls this a marriage proposal?

666
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,236
Up to you. l'm an easy-going person.

667
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,230
- Can l tell you a secret?
- Yes.

668
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:11,233
My father put it in his will that whoever
marries me will inherit the fish farm.

669
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,440
Hey, why are you reacting this way?

670
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,915
That's a big secret.
Now l've something serious to hide.

671
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,309
l feel burdened by it.

672
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,032
lmpossible, that's my secret.

673
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,158
l'm not good at keeping things to myself.
l might blab it out one day.

674
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,471
That's why l feel pressurised.

675
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,596
Keep it like your own secret then.

676
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,877
- My own secret?
- Yes.

677
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,679
Do you feel better now?

678
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,395
Yes, much better.

679
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,029
lt feels different
to treat a secret as your own.

680
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:04,673
ln a place far, far away
there lives an old woman

681
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,796
Catch this.

682
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,357
- l got you there.
- You're evil.

683
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,755
Don't worry, l'm here.

684
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,035
No, go and see why the light went out.

685
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,157
Don't you think a dark world
for two people is romantic?

686
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,516
No. lf there's no power,
food in the fridge will spoil,

687
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,513
our rice and soup will all be half cooked,
there's still something in the oven...

688
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,637
- Go and see what happened.
- l'm no generator.

689
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,915
l can't help even if l know what happened.

690
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,232
lt's not short-circuited.

691
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,158
Who is it?

692
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,318
Jackie?

693
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,634
What happened?

694
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,318
Jackie, what happened?

695
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,757
- Someone is trying to harm us.
- What should we do?

696
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,958
Go to the sitting room with this,
count to three and turn it on.

697
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,271
- But...
- Go now, quickly.

698
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,355
Jackie, l've turned it on. What next?

699
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,237
Be careful.

700
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,751
What? Tung Te-Biu?

701
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,358
- Have you gone mad?
- l'm not mad.

702
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,989
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Yes, getting rid of a witness.

703
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,348
- Let me go.
- Cousin!

704
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,591
- Cut it out. What happened?
- None of your business.

705
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,989
- You're so rude.
- l'm better than you.

706
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,674
You just wanted her to sell the fish farm.

707
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,915
What did he just say?

708
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,911
Nothing, he's lying.

709
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,029
- Stop fighting.
- Stop fighting.

710
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,473
Stop, stop.

711
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,990
- l can explain.
- Don't listen to him.

712
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,072
- Shut up.
- You shut up, it's all your fault.

713
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,278
You asked me to bug her house.
She's suing me and you don't care.

714
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,558
- You're despicable.
- Don't listen to him. He's lying.

715
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,469
Listen to me.

716
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,836
Ah Ling, let me explain,
things are not as complex as you thought.

717
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,117
- lt's a simple matter.
- lt's really simple.

718
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,156
Get out of my sight.

719
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,154
Ah Ling. Let me explain.

720
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,357
- Explain in court.
- Ah Ling!

721
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,678
Ah Ling.

722
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,233
You've ruined everything.

723
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,630
lt was ruined the minute
he caught me bugging the house.

724
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,473
l've told you, right? lt was a mistake.

725
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,472
- See who you hired.
- Hey, Ah Biu...

726
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,996
Enough... l can only depend on myself.

727
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,470
l know that this is a world without love.

728
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,512
l said l would help you win the case.

729
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,068
Win the case? You can't even win my trust.

730
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,833
- You two are useless.
- Haven't you had enough?

731
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,276
Are you taking it out on me? Come on.

732
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,999
- Don't push me so hard.
- l can't control...

733
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,351
- Big nose, you hit me?
- Any time.

734
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,151
And l can hit you any time.

735
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,195
We've called the police.
Keep on fighting, if you dare.

736
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:19,473
l've used all the tricks available to get
the Commisioner to drop the charges.

737
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,472
The three of you are too
old to fight in the street.

738
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,516
Excuse me.

739
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,595
Why were you fighting? Over women?

740
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,639
The skinny one fought over two women.
The fatty did it over a woman.

741
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,359
l did it over two men.

742
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,752
l got up early in the morning to get
you off the hook, what's my reward?

743
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,838
What do you say?

744
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,357
l'm lovelorn.

745
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,432
lf it was me you loved,
you wouldn't be lovelorn.

746
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,155
We've lost a lot of fish.
What should we do now?

747
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,629
That factory is manufacturing illegal drugs.

748
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,111
l don't believe you will stay there.

749
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,350
l don't believe you're not hitting the brake.

750
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,716
A good dog would not block the way.

751
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,392
- l'm not a good dog.
- Nor a good man.

752
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,869
- l'm a good man.
- You're a love cheat.

753
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,349
l didn't cheat you.
l invested emotionally as well.

754
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,396
- Really?
- Can't you feel it?

755
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,710
No, l've no feelings for you.

756
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,191
You wasted my time and emotion.

757
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,113
For a bit of commission,
you betrayed me and yourself.

758
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,559
- Why didn't you dodge?
- l wouldn't have come if l wanted to dodge.

759
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,678
- That was too risky.
- But not enough to kill him.

760
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:23,151
l was talking about you.
lf he got hold of the spanner, we'd be dead.

761
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,515
l'm not like that. Please let me explain.

762
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,433
lnitially, l did get
close to you for the commission.

763
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,035
After spending some time together,
l realise that l've fallen for you.

764
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,872
You just wanted to be
the boss of a fish farm.

765
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,158
lt did cross my mind,
but to prove my true love for you,

766
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,789
you can sell the farm
for charity before marrying me.

767
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,400
Sell the farm for charity?
Are we going to live on air?

768
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,756
l don't mind living on air.
As long as we don't have to live on shit.

769
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,912
Even if l don't sell the farm,
we'll have to live on air.

770
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,719
The factory kept dumping
waste water into our farm.

771
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,916
l'll check what they're doing in the factory.

772
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,877
- Get in the car, then.
- Yes.

773
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,156
Hey, why are you so obedient?

774
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,758
- Let's go, then.
- OK.

775
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,996
Your friend is here.

776
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:31,312
- Ah Ling.
- Say nothing, save it for the court.

777
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,028
- Take care.
- OK.

778
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,799
l want to help you but l can't.

779
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,033
l don't mean any harm, l just wanted
you to drop the case against me.

780
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:48,750
l'll drop the case
if you promise not to stalk me.

781
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,673
That is not a problem. l'm on my way.

782
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,316
Why are they against me and not you?

783
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,834
That's the power of love.

784
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,954
- Hey, do something for me?
- OK.

785
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,190
- l can't pay.
- l don't mind.

786
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,236
Come with me.

787
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,830
Hey...

788
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,639
- Hey, you don't have to act like that.
- l'm being cautious.

789
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:36,079
We'll split up now
and meet here in 20 minutes.

790
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,194
l've got you in shot
to prove that you're working.

791
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,035
Follow me.

792
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,476
What kind of factory is this?

793
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,155
How do you do?
Sorry to interrupt, l'm going now.

794
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,310
Bye-bye, see you later.

795
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,910
How is everybody doing?

796
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,475
- What's this?
- Nothing - a telescope.

797
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,278
- Give it back.
- Get him.

798
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,237
Don't move. You can't touch me.

799
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,955
Fatty. How did you get in?

800
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,598
Hi, how are you?

801
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,669
Don't move.

802
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,430
Don't let him escape.

803
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,159
OK, go for broke.

804
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,318
Get him.

805
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,032
Calm down, everyone,
that's the end of him.

806
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,036
Tie him up.

807
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,556
District Court civil case number 2346.

808
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,431
The Yip Fish Farm is applying for an
injunction against Wah Chemical Works

809
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,272
for continuing production.

810
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,794
The court will be presided over by Judge Lo.

811
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,910
Let me go. Why are you tying me up?

812
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,552
lf he wakes up, give him another jab.

813
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,516
Stupid Fatty.

814
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,753
Since l'm related to the plaintiff
and to show my impartiality in the case,

815
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,434
l've entrusted all specimen tests

816
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,274
to the Hong Kong University
Oceanography Department.

817
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,352
The results show that
the lead content in the water

818
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,476
is two per cent higher than normal.

819
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,790
And the oxygen is three per cent
lower than the standard.

820
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:54,710
Thank you, Miss Wen.
Your Honour, no more questions.

821
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,156
Defence counsel, this is a civil case.

822
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,118
The statements given
by the witnesses are professional.

823
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:19,876
l advise you not to use the usual
psychological tactics in your argument.

824
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,916
Yes, Your Honour.

825
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:38,600
Miss Wen, before you started
giving your statements,

826
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,719
you vowed to speak nothing but the truth,
is that right?

827
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,950
- l've not forgotten.
- Miss Wen Mei Ling,

828
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,396
please answer
the following question sincerely.

829
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,356
Do you love me?

830
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,549
Can he ask that?

831
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,834
- Objection. That's irrelevant.
- Objection overruled.

832
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,718
- None of your business.
- What happened?

833
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,598
lt's up to me to overrule any objections.

834
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:12,148
Defence counsel, please explain
the relevance of this question.

835
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,629
l'm sorry, Your Honour.

836
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,996
Please believe that l have
sufficient reason to ask the question.

837
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,153
l'll explain after the witness
has answered the question sincerely.

838
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,839
Miss Wen, do you love him?

839
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,832
Your Honour, can we talk
about the water quality?

840
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,990
l'm testifying as an oceanography expert.

841
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,117
l know you're an oceanography expert.

842
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,875
You're not only an expert,
you're also a woman.

843
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,158
The court would only object to a man
asking another man about love,

844
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,276
because that's abnormal.

845
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,831
As to a man asking a woman
whether she loves him,

846
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,319
it's perfectly normal.

847
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,960
lt's not illegal, either.

848
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:58,719
l can't find a reason to object
to him asking this question.

849
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,030
So you must answer his question.

850
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:05,113
Your Honour, l don't wish to discuss
my love life in the court.

851
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:09,637
l disagree. The Court insists.

852
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,799
Do you love me?

853
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,277
You have to answer this.

854
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,396
l don't.

855
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,598
Making a false statement is an act
of contempt of court. Did you know that?

856
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:32,915
He might sound a bit threatening
but it's true.

857
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,551
Sorry, Your Honour. l might be a bit harsh
but this question is very important to me.

858
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,791
lt's right for young people
to take love seriously.

859
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,998
Miss Wen, please think
twice before answering.

860
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,435
- Do you love me or not?
- Why are you forcing me?

861
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,114
An oath taken outside
the court means nothing.

862
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,636
lnside the court, it's legally binding.

863
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:58,439
To lie in court is a criminal act.

864
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:02,149
l want to know for real
whether you love me or not.

865
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,596
The answer you give will not only
affect my work in the future,

866
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,513
it'll determine the course of my life.

867
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,273
Sentimental men like you are rare.

868
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:15,239
l'm a judge, l decide
who's wrong and who's right.

869
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,959
But l can't decide
whether he's the one for you.

870
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,112
You'll be the judge
of this case within a case.

871
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,760
We're waiting for your verdict.

872
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,149
l...

873
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,196
love him.

874
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,590
Your Honour, since we're in love

875
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:45,070
and she and l are representing the plaintiff
and the defendent respectively,

876
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,197
for impartiality and
in the interests of both parties,

877
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,840
one of us has to withdraw from the case.

878
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:54,117
Your Honour, please allow my withdrawal.

879
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:01,029
Permission granted. Hearing adjourned.

880
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,230
Court!

881
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,991
- lncompetent service.
- Stupid man.

882
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,397
Since you didn't give me the chance
to say it, l said it all in court.

883
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,429
Keep the change.

884
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,193
- l'm sorry to interrupt, but l've no choice.
- What happened?

885
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,356
- Excuse me.
- What happened?

886
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:56,069
- Nothing. Go home, l'll come round later.
- Let's go.

887
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:00,277
Get a cab for yourself.
l've something to attend to.

888
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,676
Hey.

889
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,956
Boss.

890
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,870
This is where we started,
he went that way and l...

891
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,837
- Wait for me here.
- No.

892
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,036
- lt's dangerous inside.
- l'm not afraid.

893
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,395
- l can't take care of you.
- l'll be all right.

894
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,357
- Are you clear?
- Yes. Let's go.

895
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,996
- Put this on.
- Why?

896
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,149
You'll see later.

897
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,509
Ah Biu...

898
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,389
- Be careful.
- You too.

899
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,713
- Hey, be careful.
- l will.

900
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,911
- Dump him into the sea.
- Yes.

901
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,115
'Hey.'

902
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,269
Don't move.

903
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,510
- We're looking for someone.
- What?

904
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,556
We're looking for someone.

905
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,632
Whoever you're looking for isn't here.

906
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:11,395
He's here. We came together
and l've not seen him since.

907
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,311
He must be here, we can't be wrong.

908
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,753
Shut up.

909
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,355
The court might be your territory
but this is mine. l want you out.

910
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,671
We mustn't be rash. Let's go.

911
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,711
They're producing illegal drugs here.

912
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,279
Get rid of him.

913
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:47,190
- l said l can't take care of you.
- l said l'll be all right.

914
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,990
l don't believe l can't deal with you.

915
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,871
Wong Fei-Hung, how are you doing?

916
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,916
l'm very high.

917
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,116
Bastard.

918
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:41,071
Get rid of him
and you'll have half the factory.

919
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,798
Leave it to me.

920
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:06,995
ldiot.

921
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,079
- Wong Fei-Hung, are you all right?
- Not really.

922
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,836
- Call the police.
- OK.

923
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,710
Bitch! How dare you upset my production!

924
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,758
Jackie, Jackie.

925
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,234
My hand hurts.

926
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,556
That's the point.

927
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,552
Trying to poison me?

928
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,600
Goodbye, my friend.

929
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,155
Ah Ling.

930
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,915
Does it still hurt?

931
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,911
- No.
- Didn't l tell you not to come?

932
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,468
- l was worried about you.
- Don't do that again.

933
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,358
The love birds are mooning
and you're moaning.

934
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,079
Can you wake up, please?

935
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,913
Why didn't you tell me you were here?
What happened?

936
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:47,989
lt was...

937
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,195
Sweetheart.

938
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,553
Darling.

939
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:58,795
Love over friends.

940
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:11,671
A warm feeling rushes to my ears

941
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,799
A cupid's arrow

942
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:24,629
is turning in my heart

943
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,918
A gentle touch joins us together

944
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,790
and sets my heart racing

945
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:41,230
My love will bring you warmth and joy

946
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:48,637
Happiness in your heart will rise and grow

947
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:52,793
The warmth you feel will never fade

948
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:59,433
When our hearts are joined

949
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:06,318
Happiness in your heart will rise and grow

950
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,837
The warmth you feel will never fade

951
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:17,359
Love is like an electric current
