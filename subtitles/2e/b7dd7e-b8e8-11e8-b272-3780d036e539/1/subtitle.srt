00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,558
WORLD ON A WIRE

2
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,676
- Günther!
- I'll be right in.

3
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,475
Secretary of State von Weinlaub.

4
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,791
I'm Hirse,
Mr. Von Weinlaub's assistant.

5
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,517
Hello, my name's Lause,
I'm chief of security.

6
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,750
Please, Mr. Siskins expects you.

7
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,751
- Wasn't that Dr. Vollmer?
- It was.

8
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,837
To get right to the point:

9
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,870
Simulacron is almost
fully operational.

10
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,159
I may seem ill-informed

11
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,472
but what interests me is
your definition of "almost".

12
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,717
Of course, Mr. Secretary.

13
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,479
I apologize.

14
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,394
The margin of error
for our prognoses

15
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,120
currently reaches as high as 5. 8%.

16
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,759
I see, thank you.

17
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,878
Yes. Professor Vollmer
can tell you exactly

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,958
about the state of things.

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,351
He's overseen development
of the computer.

20
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,670
We know that, Mr. Siskins.

21
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,877
Professor Vollmer, please...

22
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,159
So, you're secretary of state?

23
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,676
Naturally.

24
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,315
I really don't care, to be honest.

25
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,675
Do you have a mirror on you?

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,992
A mirror?

27
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,115
Why?

28
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,279
Here, take this.

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,192
What do you see?
Come on, what do you see?

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,875
Let me help you, Mr?

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,235
Von Weinlaub.

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,436
Alright, von Weinlaub.

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,196
You are nothing more than the image
others have made of you.

34
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,671
- That's all.
- Enough!

35
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,236
Thank you. And the rest of you?

36
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,516
Vollmer!

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,473
You too, Siskins.

38
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,868
Want to look in the mirror?
Go on, look at yourself.

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,118
It's a sad joke.

40
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,713
That'll do, Vollmer!

41
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,190
This has gone far enough.
Hirse, let's leave.

42
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,319
Headache. It pounds
and pounds and pounds.

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,797
Do you know what's pounding
in my head?

44
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,593
I know.

45
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,875
Lause...

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,553
Please come in.

47
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,313
Why don't you lie down?
Lause will take you to your office.

48
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,795
Come on, Henri.

49
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,156
It's not a headache.

50
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,430
It's much, much more.

51
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,956
So much that my head's
about to explode.

52
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,035
Come on.

53
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,192
I'm coming, Günther.

54
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,955
They refuse to understand...

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,070
those poor worms.

56
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,110
- Take care of him.
- Yes, Mr. Siskins.

57
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,511
I must apologize
for Professor Vollmer.

58
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,753
He's been working day and night.

59
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,153
His nerves have always
been delicate.

60
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,592
The line between genius
and madness, you know...

61
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,874
Strange kind of madness,
wouldn't you say?

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,790
Of course, Mr. Secretary...

63
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,633
very strange.

64
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,029
One moment, please.

65
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,670
Go ahead.

66
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,836
Please...

67
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,630
- But I...
- Look at yourself.

68
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,636
- What do you see?
- Me.

69
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,760
Stiller was due back yesterday.

70
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,869
He'll come, Henri.

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,031
I'm scared.

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,999
I'm with you.

73
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,070
You're here.

74
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,069
The constant throbbing in my head...

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,639
Have you ever heard
of a head exploding?

76
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,277
Like that, into a thousand pieces?

77
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,275
No, never.

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,870
Really? Anyway...

79
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,029
Do you remember? As a boy

80
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,316
you must have played

81
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,477
"I see something you don't".

82
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,589
Sure, all kids do.

83
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,515
Günther...

84
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,758
I know something you don't.

85
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,837
Something no one must know.

86
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,634
It would mean
the end of this world.

87
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,796
Henri...

88
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,390
Vollmer!

89
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,717
Sorry, the bar's over there.

90
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,513
It's padding, not muscles.

91
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,315
To look manlier.

92
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,679
It's not all padding, is it?

93
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,916
If you're interested...
Fred Stiller.

94
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,999
I'm in the phone book.

95
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,991
Can't you get a drink?

96
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,112
Guess I'm small fry.

97
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,352
Too bad, but maybe you'll grow.

98
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,029
Maybe.

99
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,275
Whiskey?

100
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,714
Yes, with water.

101
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,679
Rainer, two whiskeys:
One ice, one water.

102
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,750
Yes, Mr. Siskins.

103
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,477
Coming to the funeral?

104
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,510
I'll be there, although...

105
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,719
the dead don't really care, do they?

106
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,269
Your whiskeys.

107
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,710
Thank you.

108
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,517
Can you debug the computer
without Vollmer?

109
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,159
I think so.

110
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,632
We can't afford further delays.
The Ministry's impatient.

111
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,789
By the way...

112
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,349
What?

113
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,831
Oh, nothing.
Tell me, what's your dream car?

114
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,394
Pardon me?

115
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,672
Your dream car.
It's a simple question.

116
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,593
Oh, God... A Corvette.

117
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,036
I see, a Corvette...

118
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,313
275 HP.

119
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,471
And about 40,000 marks.

120
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,915
Beyond your wage bracket?

121
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,392
Somewhat, but you asked about
my dream car, not my wage bracket.

122
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,154
- What bracket do you want?
- The next one.

123
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,551
Why not, if you're
as good as Vollmer.

124
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,908
I'm not, but I'm tough.

125
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,037
I see you're aware Vollmer and
I had our differences of opinion.

126
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,633
I believe so.

127
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,635
He was pigheaded, don't you agree?

128
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,315
Well, I...

129
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,396
Think about it.
Just so you don't misunderstand...

130
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,358
It was simply a hypothesis,
not an offer.

131
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,035
I understood you, Mr. Siskins.

132
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,028
275 HP. Quite something.

133
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,509
I'm Gloria.

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,718
Great. Care for a drink?

135
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,750
Champagne.

136
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,830
What else?

137
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,718
Still 42-26-39?

138
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,110
39 1/2.
You get fat, just sitting around.

139
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,714
But every inch is precious.

140
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,349
Thanks. How's the computer coming?

141
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,875
OK, and how's working for Siskins?

142
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,230
No, I mean it.

143
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,960
I'm very interested in Simulacron.

144
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,551
Is it true you've created
an artificial world?

145
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,950
"World" is an exaggeration.

146
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,670
Currently we've some
10,000 identity units.

147
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,558
That's all we need for now.

148
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,870
The world in a nutshell, you see?

149
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,233
10,000 people.
They're people, aren't they?

150
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,719
As you like.

151
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,558
To us they're merely circuits.
But to them...

152
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,273
They live just like we do...

153
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,112
build roads, listen to music, eat...

154
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,149
And make love?

155
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,114
That, too.

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,719
Make love, enjoy life...

157
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,028
have kids.

158
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:28,997
Exciting.

159
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,269
Pardon me?

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,399
Making love?

161
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,155
Yes, that too.
But I mean, a living world...

162
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,237
in a box full of microchips?

163
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,678
We're alive. They're like people
on TV dancing for us.

164
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,397
The way you describe it
is fascinating.

165
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,429
You're fascinating.

166
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,476
Hi, Lause!

167
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,790
Hi. Have you seen Stiller?

168
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,436
Yeah, a minute ago. Come in.

169
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,194
No, I'll wait here.
Bring him to me.

170
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,959
Sure.

171
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,151
- Fred, come with me.
- Me?

172
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,833
Lause wants you.

173
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,639
Excuse me. See you later.

174
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,274
Pity.

175
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:29,957
Lause!

176
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,680
My God, finally!
I have to see you.

177
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,229
You look awful.
Where have you been?

178
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,116
After Vollmer's death, I drove
to your place in the country.

179
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,674
You found him?

180
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,149
Yes, but... where were you?

181
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,117
I came back earlier than planned.

182
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,119
What's up?

183
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,559
Not here.

184
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,189
Come...

185
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,475
Well?

186
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,398
It's about Vollmer's death.

187
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,510
But...

188
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,514
I thought it was an accident.

189
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,830
I don't know, I didn't see it.

190
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,877
But it was very strange.

191
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,077
What? What was strange?

192
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,359
Vollmer was strange.

193
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,036
Something had happened to him.

194
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,116
I spoke to him
shortly before he died.

195
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,828
He was afraid.

196
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,832
Then he told me something
that was so...

197
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,879
that was... absolutely crazy.

198
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,390
What?

199
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,075
I can't tell you,
it's too crazy.

200
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,832
Perhaps he was crazy.

201
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,158
Do you know what fear is?

202
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,592
Yes, Lause.

203
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,557
I think so.

204
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,269
You've no idea.

205
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,150
Alright, fine. But...

206
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,514
Tell me what he said.

207
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,514
OK, then.

208
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,349
It sounds incredible,
but who knows...

209
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,593
See what you make of it.

210
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,675
My God, I'm so clumsy.
I've startled you.

211
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,519
I'll be right there.

212
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,869
"Vanished into Thin Air.

213
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,675
At a party last night
in the home of Herbert Siskins

214
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,308
- prominent head
of the IKZ Institute -

215
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,195
an Institute employee reports that

216
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,070
Chief of Security
Günther Lause vanished

217
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,071
in the middle of a conversation.

218
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,879
Police have opened
an investigation. "

219
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,758
What are you up to, Stiller?

220
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,509
What's this
about Lause and Vollmer?

221
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,750
I told the police what I saw.

222
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,117
Trying to make yourself
and the IKZ look ridiculous?

223
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,033
But it happened
exactly as I described.

224
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,116
Fine, have it your way.

225
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,993
Inspector Lehner,
Missing Persons Bureau

226
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,720
and Detective Stuhlfauth,
Homicide.

227
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,956
Dr. Stiller...

228
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,230
our acting technical director.

229
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,076
You seem to be the only one
who saw Lause last night.

230
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,194
What do you mean?

231
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,191
My men have interviewed

232
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,394
everyone at the party.
No one else saw Lause there.

233
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,875
Did you have too much to drink?

234
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,678
No, I wasn't drunk.

235
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,875
It's true that
we didn't find Mr. Lause at home.

236
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,278
But that could be a coincidence.

237
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,112
What did Lause say
about Vollmer's death?

238
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,588
He just said he found it strange.

239
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,757
Where were you
when Vollmer died?

240
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,950
At my cabin.

241
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,957
With others?

242
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,270
No.

243
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,110
We'd like to see
where Vollmer died.

244
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,192
Please show the gentlemen
the computer room.

245
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,515
Yes, Mr. Stiller.

246
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,869
Good-bye.

247
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,035
This way.

248
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,519
See you again.

249
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,797
Let's put this incident
behind us.

250
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,389
You already have.

251
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,278
Good. I'd like to discuss
Vollmer's job with you again.

252
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,430
Go ahead.

253
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,953
As I've already told you...

254
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,918
Vollmer's pigheadedness, I mean...

255
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,191
It was a strain on my nerves.

256
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,190
I'm not pigheaded.

257
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,836
That's what I wanted to hear.

258
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,551
I'm a good judge of human nature.
I knew we'd see eye to eye.

259
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,790
Tell me your dream car,
I'll tell you who you are.

260
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,949
Oh, that...

261
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,829
Good. I'll sound out
the board of directors

262
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,430
but I don't foresee
any obstacles.

263
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,473
Good-bye...

264
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,554
Mr. Director.

265
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,675
Bring me an aspirin, please.

266
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,717
Right away.

267
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,598
Problems?

268
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,552
Yes, I'm being promoted.

269
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,469
Fred!

270
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,109
Did he name you
technical director?

271
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,512
You don't seem very pleased.

272
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,833
Why should I be?

273
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,075
I'll have the same problems with
Siskins as Vollmer did, just wait.

274
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,832
Then why did you accept?

275
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,195
Simulacron's the most
exciting research project

276
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,509
in the entire world.

277
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,638
Nothing else comes close.

278
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,711
I'll earn a good salary and...

279
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,079
It's just Siskins.

280
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,150
If Vollmer was right, then...

281
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,429
Maja...

282
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,750
Forget all this.

283
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,553
I'll forget it.

284
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,915
Thanks.

285
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,154
Has Vollmer's office been emptied?

286
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,469
No.

287
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,111
His things are still there.

288
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,636
Cancel my appointments.
I'll be in Vollmer's office.

289
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,873
What are you doing?

290
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,238
You're hurting me.

291
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,553
Thank you, Fred Stiller.

292
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,638
- You are Fred Stiller?
- Yes, but what are you doing?

293
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,678
The guard at the front desk
showed me in.

294
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,993
Aren't you?

295
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,712
I'm Eva Vollmer.

296
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,077
- I didn't recognize you.
- Naturally.

297
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,231
I'm here because I was asked
to pick up Father's things.

298
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,633
- I thought you were in Montreux.
- I've been back a month.

299
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,636
You were with your father when...

300
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,990
Was he acting strange?
Did he seem nervous?

301
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,668
Not that I noticed. Why?

302
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,474
Because he...

303
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,630
I think he had made
an important discovery.

304
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,079
He couldn't tell me.

305
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,911
He was a bit preoccupied, no more.

306
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,397
You know, if you were to visit me...

307
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,751
I'd like that, really.

308
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,079
Tell me...

309
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,473
Did your dad see much
of Günther Lause?

310
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,558
Your uncle, Günther Lause.

311
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,869
Never heard of him.

312
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,438
You don't remember your uncle?

313
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,595
I remember him very well.

314
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,638
His name was Jakob, Jakob Meixner.

315
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,672
He died four years ago.

316
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,152
Eva?

317
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,517
Can I...

318
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,312
Can I be of any help?

319
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,238
I'll manage.

320
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,516
Father left me a bit of money,
and the house.

321
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,518
I apologize, Fred.
I misjudged you.

322
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,677
I thought you were interested only
in taking Father's job.

323
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,393
I should've known better.

324
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,598
I'd like some cake.

325
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,354
Choose what you want
at the counter.

326
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,912
You're under arrest.
Come with me.

327
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,431
Jeez, Franz, you scared me.

328
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,795
That one.

329
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,313
And two whiskeys.

330
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,918
What's up, Stiller?

331
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,919
Here...

332
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,713
Here's a riddle I came across,
a rebus.

333
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,590
Imagine a drawing of a Greek warrior
holding a spear

334
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,548
looking to his right,
and taking a step.

335
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,753
With a turtle going the same way.

336
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,194
First...

337
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,719
does that ring a bell?

338
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,195
Second...

339
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,831
ever seen such a drawing?

340
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,197
Me? What's this all about?

341
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,829
Vollmer left me that drawing.

342
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,236
Does it mean anything to you?

343
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,751
Bizarre, if you ask me.

344
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,119
Bizarre, sure.

345
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,069
- Does it remind you of anything?
- Maybe.

346
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,197
What?

347
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,675
Zeno.

348
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,278
Zeno's paradox.

349
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,152
Achilles and the tortoise.

350
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,679
Achilles tries to overtake
the tortoise, but cannot.

351
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,755
By the time he reaches where it was,
the turtle has moved ahead.

352
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,476
What could the paradox mean
to our work?

353
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,916
I'm only the psychologist
for our creations.

354
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,275
But...

355
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,676
as I recall,
the paradox is meant to show that

356
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,432
movement is an illusion.

357
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,670
What's the link to our work?

358
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,515
Vollmer was acting very strange
before he died.

359
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,113
Cheesecake?
Who ordered the cheesecake?

360
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,714
Maybe for a reason.
What did he say?

361
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,836
Did you order cheesecake?

362
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,709
No... I mean, yes.
I think I ordered it, thanks.

363
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,313
How was he strange?

364
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,109
I played chess with him
three days before he died.

365
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,751
He wasn't himself, he was
rambling on about philosophy.

366
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,474
He had made a shattering discovery.

367
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,797
What?

368
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,838
He wouldn't say. It was a secret.
Something like that.

369
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,997
Why are you
so interested in it, Fred?

370
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,191
I don't think Vollmer's death
was an accident.

371
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,993
What do you mean?

372
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,518
I know about Vollmer
and Siskins' disagreements

373
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,717
on the applications
of the simulation model.

374
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,757
I said no such thing.

375
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,114
OK, fine.

376
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,955
By the way, I can imagine what

377
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,032
Vollmer's shattering discovery was.

378
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,997
I bet it had to do
with his attitude towards

379
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,711
the identity units
we'd programmed in his computer.

380
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,516
You remember how he called them
"my children".

381
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,318
He was only joking.

382
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,556
You can't spend years
feeding data into a computer

383
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,271
that allows for the simulation of
every aspect of human behaviour

384
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,151
without asking yourself
if it might lead to the creation

385
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,949
of something resembling
human consciousness.

386
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,677
Lause spoke of
a "shattering discovery".

387
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,909
Lause? Who's he?

388
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,033
Stop. If I hadn't believed him,
I'd never have told the cops.

389
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,438
Lause? Cops? What do you mean?

390
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,591
Lause! Günther Lause!

391
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,877
Chief of security at
Cybernetics and Futurology!

392
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,519
Our Institute!

393
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,989
Just take it easy.

394
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,594
Stiller, do you see that man?

395
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,278
That's Hans Edelkern.

396
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,910
He's been IKZ's chief of security
for five years.

397
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,599
You remember now?

398
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,150
Stiller!

399
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,794
Got a light?

400
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,919
No, I mean it, for my cigarette.

401
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,918
Understand? I'm not trying to...

402
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,753
Pick me up? Too bad.

403
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,917
Anyway, I don't smoke.

404
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,755
Thanks. Sorry.

405
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,599
Don't mention it.

406
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,436
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

407
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,115
<i>Gloria?</i>

408
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,072
<i>Do you have a pen?</i>

409
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,719
<i>Then take this down</i>

410
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,993
<i>The chairman United Steel Inc</i>

411
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,473
<i>Dear Mr Hartmann</i>

412
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,475
I accept your invitation
with pleasure.

413
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,909
In view of the situation,
I would request

414
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,868
you treat my visit
as primarily a personal one.

415
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,151
<i>I'm sure you will understand</i>

416
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,517
<i>if I insist on</i>
<i>the utmost confidentiality</i>

417
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,791
<i>Yours truly Herbert Siskins</i>

418
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,589
Please come in, my dear Siskins.

419
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,833
A lovely couple.

420
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,359
Rupp, <i>Daily News. </i>
A quick question:

421
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,393
Is your new computer
solely for state use?

422
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,555
Please, I have no comment.

423
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,114
Certainly not here.

424
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,472
Ask at the IKZ press office.

425
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,752
Yeah, yeah. One thing:

426
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,311
Does a certain company have access
to data obtained from the computer?

427
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,950
A suggestion, Mr?

428
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,236
Rupp.

429
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,390
Why not write about
how our simulation model

430
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,232
is more than a computer?

431
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,717
I'll suggest it to my editor.

432
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,078
It's a new generation
of computer technology.

433
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,350
Who benefits?

434
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,592
Everyone, if it's up to me.

435
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,635
May I see your ID, please?
Regulations, you know.

436
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,949
I know.

437
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,159
Thank you, Mr. Stiller.

438
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,632
How can I help you? For personnel
files, you need special clearance.

439
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,357
No, just the staff directory.

440
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,835
Which letter?

441
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,155
Let's try L.

442
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,470
Alright, L... L what?

443
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,677
Ask it, "Who is Günther Lause?"

444
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,432
WHO IS GÜNTHER LAUSE?

445
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,272
Günther Lause is unknown.

446
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,269
Have a look.

447
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,310
Okay.

448
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,111
Edelkern. Ask it about Edelkern.

449
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,112
What's it say?

450
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,837
The truth, naturally:

451
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,276
"Hans Edelkern is
chief of security at IKZ. "

452
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,116
Tell me, Mrs?

453
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:22,758
Meier.

454
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,633
Know anything special about
Hans Edelkern, anything at all?

455
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,755
Mr. Edelkern? I don't think so.
Ask him yourself.

456
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,832
Hi, Fred.

457
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,155
Were there complaints about me?

458
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,558
Tell me the truth.

459
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,269
- No, that's not it.
- Good.

460
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,114
I was afraid...

461
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,435
I mean it.

462
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,429
That's alright, Fred.
You don't have to explain.

463
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,515
I'm sure you have your reasons.

464
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,753
Say, why don't you visit us again?

465
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,508
Laura still talks
about our last dinner.

466
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,513
Says you're the most
charming man around.

467
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,679
Really, am I?

468
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,189
- According to Laura.
- Well, then...

469
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,475
You see.

470
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,519
Just give us a call.

471
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,358
We'd be thrilled, honestly.

472
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,757
I've never met a Laura
in my whole life.

473
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,313
Anything else I can do?

474
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,469
No, thanks.

475
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,595
You're welcome.

476
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,796
I'm... I'm here about Lause.

477
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,719
Who's Lause?

478
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,557
Forget it, Fritz.

479
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,592
Something wrong?

480
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,874
Morning, Maja.

481
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,436
Good morning.

482
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,512
I'm a gift.

483
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,950
Siskins thought you'd be pleased.

484
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,950
Of course. Of course I'm pleased.

485
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,079
A sight to behold.
Isn't that what they say?

486
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,676
Yes, they do.

487
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,556
Where's Maja?

488
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,231
She's sick.
Probably will be for some time.

489
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,596
By the way, Siskins was very sorry
to lose me.

490
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,549
I'm deeply honoured.

491
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,028
- A cup of coffee?
- No thanks.

492
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,675
I'm delighted to work with you.

493
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,197
The pleasure's all mine.

494
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,359
Get me the police,
Inspector Lehner.

495
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,474
Yes, Mr. Stiller.

496
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,273
Inspector Lehner, please.

497
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,511
Hello, Inspector. I wanted to ask if
you found out anything about Lause.

498
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,469
<i>Who is this?</i>

499
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,996
At the Cybernetics Institute.

500
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,152
It's about the Lause case,
Günther Lause.

501
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,880
<i>Sorry I've never heard of a Lause</i>

502
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,270
My God, you must remember!

503
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,273
Siskins' party, a man disappeared.

504
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,158
I notified the police.

505
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,596
<i>Slowly Mr Stiller</i>
<i>I don't know of any Lause case</i>

506
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,996
Siskins wants you
in his office at 2:30.

507
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,593
<i>Thanks Miss Fromm</i>

508
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,873
How are you feeling?

509
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,314
No idea.

510
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,594
Not good.

511
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,913
What's the doctor say?

512
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,750
I had all the tests...

513
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:53,951
blood

514
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,988
urine, everything.

515
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,551
But they don't know.

516
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,479
Chronic exhaustion.

517
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,869
And you...

518
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,273
How are you?

519
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,273
Siskins asked me
to a meeting at 2:30.

520
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,075
Really?

521
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,515
- Who's with you now?
- Where?

522
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,952
At work.

523
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,951
A woman named Gloria Fromm.

524
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,236
42-26-39?

525
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,597
39 1/2. From all that sitting.
You should know.

526
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,719
I'll be going.

527
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,308
Get well soon.

528
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,109
Thanks.

529
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,270
Fred?

530
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,711
I'm still fond of you.

531
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,596
Have a seat, Dr. Stiller.

532
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,993
Care for a drink?

533
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,556
- A coffee?
- No, thanks. Really.

534
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,359
Alright then, let's begin.

535
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,075
Would you?

536
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,358
As you may know

537
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,269
I sit on the government-
appointed commission

538
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,751
Perspective 2000

539
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,953
as an expert on steel.

540
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,994
Also in your capacity as

541
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,230
chairman of United Steel Inc.

542
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,029
Of course, naturally.

543
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,149
And in this respect
we're somewhat preoccupied

544
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,070
especially given
certain recent trends

545
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,913
in freight
and transportation systems

546
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,633
that would have major repercussions
in the 80s and 90s

547
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,158
on demand for steel.

548
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,795
Do you have a background
in business?

549
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,436
Hardly.

550
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,112
Well, if I may briefly explain...

551
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,638
In our sector, investments are not
only long-term, they're also...

552
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,309
Very costly.

553
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,916
Let Mr. Hartmann finish, Stiller.

554
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,314
No, no, you can put it that way.
Quite right.

555
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,559
Costly.
In other words, an investment

556
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,996
to the tune of several
hundred million

557
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,597
if made today, would take,
say, 20 years

558
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,988
to be amortized.

559
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,718
- If your analyses were correct.
- If they were correct, yes.

560
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,558
Naturally we don't make
wild guesses.

561
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,350
We rely on a whole slew of
scientific analytical tools:

562
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,917
Economic and market analyses

563
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,955
trend forecasts,
input-output relations...

564
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,314
to name a few.

565
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,238
But you yourself know

566
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,916
the limitations of
the prognostic capacity

567
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,551
of conventional computer technology

568
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,990
and how much larger the margin
of error is of such computers

569
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,188
compared to your simulation model.

570
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,829
Why are you telling me all this?

571
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,756
- I don't understand.
- He does.

572
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,999
Dr. Stiller...

573
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,235
We're not talking about
opening a hot-dog stand

574
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,711
but a decision of major importance
to the national economy

575
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,509
for which Mr. Hartmann, as a member
of the Perspective 2000 Committee...

576
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,792
Then let the committee request it.

577
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,076
Can you imagine
the bureaucracy that entails?

578
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:50,076
Besides, the software wasn't
designed to access such variables.

579
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,072
It would jeopardize the entire
program and set us back two months.

580
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,628
I'll look like a fool.
From a technical...

581
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,155
Thank you, Stiller.
I'm not asking.

582
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,196
You'll call up the data
from the simulation model

583
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,830
for the demand for steel
for the next 20 years

584
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,991
and have it on my desk by...

585
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,470
by the 23rd.

586
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,351
I don't know. You can't just
let some conglomerate...

587
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,392
Please let me decide what
I can or cannot do, Stiller.

588
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,833
Then you don't need me.

589
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,637
For God's sake, Siskins...

590
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,429
I thought you'd have settled this
internally, at least.

591
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,234
We have, my dear Hartmann, we have.

592
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,879
You see, Stiller is a scientist.

593
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,915
And in every scientist
resides a bit of an idealist.

594
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,749
But...

595
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,910
I'll deal with the little idealist
in Stiller.

596
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,390
- Hello, Stiller.
- Hello, Hahn.

597
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,473
Want to check the psychograms
of the new units?

598
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,392
No, we've reviewed them.

599
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,553
Feeling better?

600
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,550
Yes, it just
came over me yesterday.

601
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,109
I should apologize for my behaviour.

602
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,156
Forget it.

603
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,992
Really, I'm sorry.

604
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,038
Excuse me, but...

605
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,874
I need to go to the computer room.

606
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,991
We're up to precisely
9700 identity units.

607
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,636
The equivalent of a small town.

608
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,793
By the way...

609
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,632
I'd like a hook-up.

610
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,789
For you?

611
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,472
To sample village life.

612
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,234
Fine with me, anytime.
Oh, have a look.

613
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,392
She's in the mind
of a millionaire's wife.

614
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,119
Yes, he's here.

615
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,268
Fine.

616
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,676
Fine, I'll tell him.

617
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,439
The police are here to see you.

618
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,439
The police?

619
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,514
Come with me.

620
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,994
Hello, Dr. Stiller.

621
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,233
You honour me, but this is Stiller.

622
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,431
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

623
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,198
Hello, Dr. Stiller.

624
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,272
I was hoping to speak to you
in private.

625
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,116
Is that really necessary?

626
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,510
I'd say so, yes.

627
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,074
OK, I'll clear out.

628
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,754
I'll be at the computer. See you.

629
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,953
Please come in.

630
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,349
Yes?

631
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,590
We have questions, Mr. Stiller.

632
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,959
Questions for you.

633
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,951
Questions about the Vollmer case.

634
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,952
You were his assistant?

635
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,673
You know full well.

636
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,274
Yes, of course.

637
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,113
Purely routine.

638
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,396
Part of the job.
Once learned

639
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,113
you never forget it.

640
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,556
Let me be frank, Mr. Stiller.

641
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,599
It's possible that Vollmer's death
was not an accident.

642
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,190
You were away?

643
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,673
I told you,
at my cabin in the mountains.

644
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,915
What do you mean, you told me?

645
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,509
Nothing.

646
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,832
Just that I was at my cabin.

647
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,796
Can anyone corroborate that?

648
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,350
No.

649
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,157
Vollmer was my best friend.

650
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,436
You're not doing too badly
as technical director at IKZ.

651
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,519
No, not too badly.

652
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,717
I can reach you here,
if I need you?

653
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,718
If you need me.

654
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,588
Good-bye, Mr. Stiller.

655
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,751
He was from Homicide.

656
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,559
If anyone makes trouble, I'm here.

657
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,919
The police aren't giving up,
that's good.

658
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,599
Lause hinted that Vollmer's death

659
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,876
might not have been an accident.

660
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,394
Who's Lause?

661
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,639
The Lause who vanished
without a trace at Siskins' party.

662
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,715
Did someone vanish without a trace
at Siskins' party?

663
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,312
Probably one of Siskins'
harmless jokes.

664
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,311
No doubt, Gloria, no doubt.

665
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,595
A simple hook-up
to an identity unit.

666
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,193
Is that alright?

667
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,754
I chose 4388 for you,
a truck driver.

668
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,277
Enjoy the ride.

669
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,914
OK, step on it.

670
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,958
Here we go. Be good,
and stay out of trouble.

671
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,475
Floor it.

672
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,710
<i>Lousy weather we gave them</i>

673
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,872
<i>Strange why's there no traffic?</i>
<i>I don't get it</i>

674
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,391
<i>Maybe it's Sunday here</i>
<i>I forgot to ask</i>

675
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,110
<i>Kid if I hit you it won't</i>
<i>even cause a short circuit</i>

676
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,269
<i>What's Walfang done now?</i>
<i>Hey what's that?</i>

677
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,115
You were lucky, young man.
Just a slight shock.

678
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,031
We nearly saw the last of you.

679
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,476
How's it possible?

680
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,312
Search me. I haven't
checked the box yet, but...

681
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:39,876
But?

682
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,953
Say it, you have a hunch.

683
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,119
Something exploded.

684
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,755
It can only have been sabotage.

685
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,228
Impossible, with our security.

686
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,078
If it exploded, <i>it must be sabotage</i>
<i>A computer doesn't just explode!</i>

687
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,511
Sabotage is quite impossible.

688
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,031
IKZ is under our control.

689
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,149
Obviously not.

690
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,710
A technical error, perhaps.
How long will repairs take?

691
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,676
I nearly died,
and that's all you say?

692
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,193
You mustn't get excited,
you need rest.

693
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,068
Yeah, yeah, OK.

694
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,034
Good-bye, then.

695
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:30,872
Thanks.

696
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,594
Don't mention it.
Just doing my job.

697
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,629
I want a thorough investigation.

698
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,431
Check security measures, Edelkern.
If necessary, step them up.

699
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,669
Understand?

700
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,152
Naturally, Mr. Siskins.

701
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:52,838
Of course.

702
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,035
Mr. Stiller, I think you should
go home and rest.

703
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,554
Seriously, how long
will repairs take?

704
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,029
Two or three days, no longer.

705
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,269
OK, then...

706
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,079
That's alright.

707
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,029
Eva?

708
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,118
You startled me.

709
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,639
Something wrong?

710
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,790
No.

711
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,390
I was thinking of my father.

712
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,117
Shall we go for a drive?

713
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,828
Just like that.

714
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,559
You know, I need a change of air.

715
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,631
Some of Father's files
are still on his desk.

716
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,637
Check if there's anything
useful to you.

717
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,152
I'll get ready.

718
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,670
Was anything removed
after your father died?

719
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,429
Pardon?

720
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,672
I asked if anything was removed
after your father's death.

721
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,235
Questioning me?

722
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,949
Come on, let's go.

723
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,360
Have you seen his drawing
since then?

724
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,119
What drawing?

725
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,551
Achilles and the tortoise.

726
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,756
I've never seen it...

727
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,471
Achilles and the tortoise.

728
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,120
I'm going to try to find out

729
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,149
how your father really died.

730
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,308
Do you think?

731
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,789
Maybe.

732
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,593
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

733
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,354
<i>What's wrong?</i>

734
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,679
Nothing. I don't feel well.
I haven't felt well for a while.

735
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,558
I get dizzy, see things.

736
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,076
Probably, or possibly,
I'm simply overworked.

737
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,674
Want me to drive?

738
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,868
I'll just wait here a bit,
then drive you home.

739
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,552
One, two, three, four...

740
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,149
Come in. Fourteen, fifteen.

741
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,756
- Hi, Fritz.
- Hi, Fred.

742
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,114
What's that?

743
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,316
- For my circulation.
- Your circulation?

744
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,315
I've been having dizzy spells.

745
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,038
Better watch it.

746
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,478
Your puppets are dancing.

747
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,999
I contacted 0001 again.

748
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,275
Einstein?

749
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,113
That system failure
has him worried.

750
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,839
He's being difficult.

751
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,951
You know, I think that was Vollmer's

752
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,872
only major mistake.

753
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,950
What?

754
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,751
The Einstein contact unit.

755
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,519
It wouldn't have worked without him.
We tried everything.

756
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,798
We needed a unit
we could contact directly.

757
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,712
Problems were inevitable.

758
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,995
Why?

759
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,916
No one can stand knowing
they're artificial.

760
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,638
Obviously.

761
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,715
But if they suffer
psychological disorders

762
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,635
it shows how successful we've been.

763
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,552
Depends how you see it.

764
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,790
Einstein reported
an attempted suicide.

765
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,036
Unbelievable. Who?

766
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,036
7326, Christopher Nobody.

767
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,033
I'll take him out.
He'll screw up the system.

768
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,991
It's inhuman of us, isn't it?
But we have no choice.

769
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,914
OK, delete him, this...

770
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,595
Right. Christopher Nobody.

771
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,679
See you later.

772
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,152
Zeno.

773
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,638
Zeno's paradox!

774
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,152
This is no coincidence.

775
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,357
That must be
what Vollmer's drawing meant.

776
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,836
Send me down to see Nobody.

777
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,317
Nobody no longer exists,
he's in heaven.

778
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,872
- Don't joke.
- I deprogrammed him. He's gone.

779
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:27,438
Shit!

780
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,432
Why?

781
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,275
- He must know something...
- <i>Knew... </i>

782
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,476
Knew something I need.

783
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,034
Hardly likely, Fred.

784
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,628
I programmed him myself.
He was an ordinary unit. Why?

785
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,152
Nothing, Fritz, nothing.
Just an idea.

786
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,278
Let me speak to Einstein,
he may know.

787
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,989
Give me a projection link.

788
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,432
OK, I'll call you.

789
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,517
- Where do I meet Einstein?
- In a hotel lobby.

790
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,637
You only have 5 minutes.

791
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,470
You've kept me waiting.

792
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,958
Hello, Einstein.

793
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,468
Is something wrong?

794
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,835
Not often I meet someone
from above.

795
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,955
Right now I'm just a bundle
of electronic circuits, too.

796
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,150
A projection, if you like.

797
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,828
Shall we sit down?

798
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,594
I only have a few minutes,
it's not really worth it.

799
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,754
It's about Christopher Nobody.

800
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,718
You spoke to him.

801
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,391
Why did he try to kill himself?

802
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,272
A whiskey.

803
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,789
He was on the verge of a breakdown.

804
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,595
Why?

805
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,359
He knew.

806
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,231
What did he know?

807
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,030
Somehow he'd found out

808
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,310
what he was.

809
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,510
<i>You don't just find that out</i>

810
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,518
<i>Did you say something?</i>

811
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,754
<i>You know my circuits prohibit it</i>

812
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,798
Time's running out.
Stiller has to be back

813
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,473
in 120 seconds.

814
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,635
In 30 seconds we'll signal him.

815
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,388
PHONE CALL FOR MR. STILLER

816
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,270
My time's up.
Good-bye, Einstein.

817
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,829
<i>Come on show me</i>
<i>Come on show me</i>

818
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,158
<i>Come on show me</i>

819
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,198
I can't bear it.
Please, take me with you.

820
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,115
You know that's absurd.

821
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:12,790
I'll be back.

822
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,991
Let me talk in peace.

823
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,114
We'll meet at 8, Gerda.
In the corner restaurant.

824
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,950
What's the idea, young man?
Where are your manners?

825
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,713
The impertinence!

826
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:53,718
A light?

827
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,949
Thanks.

828
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,119
Everything OK?

829
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,359
Everything's OK. Except...

830
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,432
I saw Günther Lause.

831
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,194
Sorry, who?

832
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,513
Come with me.

833
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,516
I want to do a test.
Got a minute?

834
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,669
Sure.

835
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,353
OK, I'm looking
for an identity unit.

836
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,511
Use the list.

837
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,909
No, let's try a different method.
I'll describe him.

838
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,435
Age?

839
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,671
55. Male. Single.

840
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,474
Engineering degree.

841
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,952
Psychological traits?

842
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,356
He's good-natured.

843
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,877
But stingy. Drinks quite a bit.

844
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,315
Two minutes.

845
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,872
Eva, it's Fred.

846
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,276
Too many. Anything else?

847
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,991
Heavy smoker,
gold medallist in sports.

848
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,033
Collects old watches.

849
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,230
That should do it.

850
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,279
Sorry, but...

851
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,269
No, I'm running a test. Listen...

852
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,952
Could you pick me up?
I want to see you.

853
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,154
See you at six.

854
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,755
I've got five.

855
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,629
- That OK?
- I hope so. Their names?

856
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,475
Teiler, Strunz, Kittel

857
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,834
Erdhofer, Lause.

858
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,399
Lause's first name?

859
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,629
Günther.

860
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,796
Günther Lause.
Didn't you just?

861
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,754
Yes. What number?

862
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,951
7683.

863
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:22,831
Programmer?

864
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:24,916
Vollmer!

865
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,074
That's fine.

866
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,834
Thanks a lot.

867
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,108
Strange.

01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,790

Problems?

873
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,876
Could say that.

874
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,472
Is it about Zeno again?

875
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,835
Or this Lause?

876
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,515
Yes, him too.

877
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,032
You know about the sabotage
during my hook-up.

878
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,112
But that a cop who'd
interrogated me once

879
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,037
forgot, and interrogated me again...
that you don't know.

880
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,228
Or that the other night everything,

881
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,269
the streets, lights...
disappeared for a few seconds...

882
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,839
that you don't know.

883
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,675
Nor can you imagine my dizzy spells
and depression.

884
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,835
I see.

885
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,394
A street vanished
and then reappeared?

886
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,115
Ice or water?

887
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,429
Nothing, thanks.

888
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,513
I've thought a lot
about you, Stiller.

889
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,195
I believe...

890
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,994
with your new responsibility
for the simulation model

891
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,872
and the unusual stress of your job

892
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,873
you're overworked,
psychologically unstable.

893
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,959
Think about it...

894
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,514
Every day you reign like God

895
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:56,037
over a miniature world
you helped to create

896
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,953
and which you mistake
more and more for a real world.

897
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,872
You can add and delete
people at will.

898
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,590
This leads to feelings of guilt,

899
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,677
depression and fear.

900
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,199
You need to relax, forget it all.

901
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,638
I have to make a call.

902
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,799
What should I do?

903
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,836
You've taken the first step:

904
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,916
You recognize the cause,
realize what's happening,

905
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,312
are aware of the problem.

906
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,396
If you keep working on yourself,
you'll get better

907
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,038
and your mental disturbances
will go away.

908
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,910
You should take a vacation.

909
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,435
Forget it, especially now.

910
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,868
I don't want Simulacron working
exclusively for Hartmann.

911
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,191
I guess I'll be going.

912
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,592
Try to have a little fun
now and then.

913
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,356
And stop brooding.
It's not good for you.

914
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,835
Believe me.

915
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,873
I'll try.

916
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,790
Getting in?

917
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,511
Quite a coincidence, isn't it?

918
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,190
It's no coincidence.
Dr. Hahn phoned me.

919
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,597
He thought I could take
your mind off things.

920
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,917
It was fine with me.

921
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,998
Me, too.

922
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,837
Now I'm feeling better.

923
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,473
But I won't be manipulated!

924
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,430
Manipulated by whom?

925
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,879
By Siskins.

926
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,317
What do you mean?

927
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,711
I won't be intimidated!

928
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,078
I can be just as pigheaded
as Vollmer was.

929
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:31,950
Vollmer wouldn't let private
interests take over his computer.

930
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,314
And I won't, either.

931
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,076
Let Siskins do what he likes.

932
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,994
Isn't Siskins a danger to you?

933
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,720
No, because he needs me.
Let's dance.

934
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,316
Morning, Fred.

935
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,596
Morning, Miss Fromm. Thank you.

936
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,595
Any mail?

937
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,790
Need an aspirin?

938
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:09,954
Important calls?

939
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,314
But Siskins wants
to see you urgently.

940
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:14,995
Miss Fromm?

941
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,879
Last night I said
some pretty crazy things.

942
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:28,990
Forget them.

943
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:34,233
Were they all just crazy things?

944
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,430
So, what's up?

945
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,352
I need your help.

946
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,552
We have to do something.

947
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,630
The media are getting impatient.

948
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:10,151
One question, just to be sure:

949
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,471
Could you convincingly explain
our computer to a layman

950
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:19,269
if all of society
depended on it?

951
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:23,792
I have my convictions,
and I can present them convincingly.

952
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:27,316
That's exactly what
I expected you to say.

953
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,356
Send them in.

954
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,994
My colleague, Dr. Stiller, and I

955
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,194
have a statement
about the simulation model.

956
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,518
Afterwards,
we'll offer refreshments.

957
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,236
A misunderstanding
has led to the publication

958
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,638
of a report in the press
that was misleading for the public.

959
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,635
We wish to take the opportunity

960
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,519
to dispel this misunderstanding.

961
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,114
Dr. Stiller developed
the simulation model

962
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,233
together with Professor Vollmer.

963
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,754
Dr. Stiller will say a few words
about the new computer system.

964
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,473
Strictly speaking, it isn't
a computer in the conventional sense

965
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,110
but rather an electronic
simulation system

966
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,510
with tremendous storage capacity.

967
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,119
As Professor Henri Vollmer put it

968
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,510
with this system we achieved

969
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:45,116
the qualitative jump
to an autonomous computer.

970
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,830
We've created
an artificial miniature world

971
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:53,079
out of circuits, switches,
electronic impulses and reflexes.

972
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,196
When fully functional,
it will lead a life of its own

973
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,515
according to our rules,
and with its own dynamics.

974
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,468
Concretely, Dr. Stiller,
what does the thing do?

975
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,713
Naturally Dr. Stiller thinks
in scientific terms.

976
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,357
If you'd prefer
a practical point of view...

977
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,319
I'm at your disposal.

978
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,356
Go on, Dr. Stiller.
We'd like to hear from you.

979
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,908
I'll try.

980
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,868
You have to imagine the inside
of our simulation model

981
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,436
we call it <i>Simulacron</i> -

982
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,433
as a reproduction in miniature

983
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,909
of our society.

984
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,115
At the moment

985
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,513
we have slightly over
9000 so-called identity units

986
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,668
each of which has the faculties
of perception, thought

987
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,156
memory, imagination

988
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,150
and so forth

989
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,676
of a real human being.

990
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,117
With Simulacron, we have

991
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:13,756
in a word, a tiny universe
identical to our own.

992
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,037
Into this universe we can

993
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,320
introduce certain impulses which...

994
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,869
I'm coming back to your question -

995
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,829
impulses which

996
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,717
lead to highly specific reactions.

997
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:31,829
Reactions...

998
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,951
that precisely replicate
human reactions.

999
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,315
20 years in the future.

1000
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,272
This means we can use
Simulacron to avoid

1001
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,908
the mistakes we'd make
in that period.

1002
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,194
For example...

1003
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:55,630
We can, to be extremely concrete

1004
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,874
use Simulacron to learn

1005
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,349
consumer habits 20 years from now...

1006
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,918
how housing needs will evolve

1007
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,912
which transportation modes
will become obsolete

1008
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,798
and which ones will be in use.

1009
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,109
Then you could also calculate

1010
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:20,114
if in 20 years we'll need
more steel or plastics.

1011
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,793
Yes, of course.

1012
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,916
In time manufacturers will have
access to this data

1013
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,833
to avoid socially
unproductive investments.

1014
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,073
What do you mean, "in time"?

1015
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,077
As you are aware,
our research project

1016
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:39,038
is state-initiated and sponsored.

1017
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,270
We do not define its mandate.

1018
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:45,956
Our sole mission is
to carry out government policy.

1019
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,318
There are questions about

1020
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,954
your relationship to United Steel.

1021
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:56,238
There are always questions.
That's why you do research...

1022
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,236
to find answers.

1023
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,034
Here, in our Institute, we seek

1024
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:05,272
to devote our energies
to designing a better

1025
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:09,270
new, more humane
and equitable world

1026
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:13,673
to meet the hopes and dreams
of Mr. Stiller and us all.

1027
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:15,750
Now, a snack.

1028
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,830
What's your true relationship
to Hartmann?

1029
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,710
Mr. Hartmann is a friend.

1030
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,553
A good friend.

1031
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,158
In private, Mr. Rupp,
only in private.

1032
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:11,398
Hahn's advice from the other day...

1033
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,873
I think it helped.

1034
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,549
At least I know
what's wrong with me.

1035
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,955
I'm sure you'll be better soon.

1036
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,397
About the other night,
I'm truly sorry.

1037
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,831
I was out of it.

1038
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,551
Hahn called it "paranoia".

1039
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,398
He's probably right.

1040
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,395
I'll be so happy
when everything's OK.

1041
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,633
Yes, and...

1042
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,635
now with all the coverage
in the papers,

1043
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,199
the TV and so on...

1044
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:27,828
I just hope he's painted himself
into a corner. And you?

1045
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,198
I hope you're right.

1046
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,439
Please excuse me.

1047
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,635
Of course.

1048
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,516
See you sometime.

1049
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,554
Say something!

1050
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,752
She's not there.

1051
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,551
Could I have a light?

1052
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,552
Now she's disappeared, like Lause.

1053
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:46,758
Lause disappeared too,
and everyone's forgotten him.

1054
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,114
Except me...

1055
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,152
He's in my head

1056
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,032
and he refuses to come out.

1057
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,393
My Eva...

1058
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,998
my darling little Eva.

1059
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,073
They'll forget you too.

1060
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,559
But in my head,
she'll stay there.

1061
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:33,878
I mean...

1062
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,788
my head's a funny head.

1063
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,312
There are things in it

1064
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,474
that don't go in any other head.

1065
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,632
Good morning, Mr. Stiller.

1066
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,197
Good morning, Miss Fromm.

1067
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,153
Aspirin?

1068
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,355
One second.

1069
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:52,834
I tried to reach you
all last night.

1070
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,156
Me?

1071
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,317
Siskins wants you.

1072
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,993
Where were you?

1073
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,790
Were you with Eva Vollmer?

1074
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,118
You should go see Siskins
right away. It's important.

1075
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,555
- <i>/t's Stiller</i>
- Send him in.

1076
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,474
Morning, Stiller.

1077
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,832
Aren't you a sight!

1078
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,190
A night on the town, I bet.

1079
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,199
Have a seat.

1080
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:41,954
What's up?

1081
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:46,629
I wanted to introduce
a new addition to your staff.

1082
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:51,509
I believe you know him.
A top-notch fellow.

1083
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,679
He sent me his résumé and

1084
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,715
I didn't want to lose him.

1085
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,548
That will be him.

1086
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,072
Come in.

1087
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,590
Mark Holm.

1088
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:06,510
Hello.

1089
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:08,515
Hello, Mark.

1090
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:11,558
Mr. Holm can join
your team immediately.

1091
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,433
Where'd you work before?

1092
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,231
The Trau Institute, but...

1093
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,071
Isn't that

1094
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,989
a subsidiary of United Steel?

1095
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,229
It is, Fred.

1096
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,789
Thanks, I was just curious.

1097
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,274
161266.

1098
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,791
My God, Eva!
Where were you?

1099
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,633
I searched the entire house
for you!

1100
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,069
Hold on.

1101
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,829
Thank you.

1102
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:21,034
- So where were you?
- <i>At home of course</i>

1103
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,954
<i>I fell asleep on the couch</i>
<i>You just didn't see me</i>

1104
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,588
- I searched every...
- <i>/t doesn't matter</i>

1105
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,909
<i>I wanted to apologize</i>
<i>for running away I love you</i>

1106
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:37,153
<i>I'm happy I've thought it over</i>
<i>I'm not worried anymore</i>

1107
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,478
I need you, Eva.

1108
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,233
<i>Yes Ciao</i>

1109
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:12,229
I've been looking for you.
How's it going?

1110
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,671
- A cigarette?
- God no!

1111
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:23,351
I hate it.
Mark Holm's been nosing around.

1112
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:28,990
I'm going to hook-up
with Einstein.

1113
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,713
I want to know
what's going on with him.

1114
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:36,232
Like to come?

1115
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,159
No, not today.

1116
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,794
See you later.

1117
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,474
Fritz, what's wrong?

1118
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,914
Nothing, Mr. Stiller,
it's nothing.

1119
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,391
You're not Fritz Walfang.

1120
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,399
You're Einstein.

1121
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,238
My God, what is this?

1122
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,037
Let me go, please!

1123
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,393
Don't send me back.

1124
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,718
It's my only chance.

1125
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:16,832
I want to be a human being.

1126
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:18,433
And I will.

1127
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,317
This is the first step.
I'll make the next one, too.

1128
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,232
Into the real world.

1129
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,156
What do you mean?
This is the real world.

1130
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,753
Still want your beer?

1131
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,398
That's what you think.

1132
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,552
But the truth is

1133
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,992
this world,
which you take for reality,

1134
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:46,631
is only a simulation model
of the real world.

1135
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,794
Fred Stiller,
the big computer boss...

1136
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:54,558
You're nothing but a mass
of electrical circuits.

1137
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,960
The identity unit Fred Stiller.

1138
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:01,198
You're a number,
like everyone here.

1139
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,868
A number in
a research laboratory.

1140
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:07,675
Admittedly,
in a highly advanced one.

1141
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:12,193
Professor Vollmer knew it.
That's why he had to die.

1142
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,713
And now you know.

1143
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,072
It can't be, Einstein.

1144
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:32,392
Tell me it's not true.

1145
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,429
