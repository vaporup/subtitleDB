00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,632
WORLD ON A WIRE

2
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,397
Einstein! Don't be a fool,
you've no chance.

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,551
I won't go back,
I want to live!

4
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,395
Get help! Call Edelkern!

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,958
Call someone for help.

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,158
You have to speak up,
I can't hear you.

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,719
I'm hard of hearing.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,436
Telephone! Help!

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,598
Edelkern, I'm in the cafeteria.
I need help, quick!

10
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,559
What's wrong, Fred?

11
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,829
What happened?

12
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,957
Take him to a hook-up station, fast.

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,357
And load the program for 0001.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,594
He looks like Fritz Walfang, right?

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,469
In reality, he's identity unit 0001.

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,791
Vollmer named him Einstein.

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,909
Yes, but, I mean...

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,719
I just saw him.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,114
Come with me.

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,154
Ready?

21
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,389
Nearly.

22
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,439
Let me do that.

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,995
I had no idea...

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,159
About what, Holm?

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,755
What could happen.

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,431
What in God's name happened?

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,715
Careful.

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,713
Quiet now.

29
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,551
Anything?

30
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,996
- No, but...
- That's OK.

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,755
I wanted to see
if I could hook myself up, too.

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,515
But...

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,760
He switched their minds.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,831
He should be here.

35
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,913
Hi, Fred.

36
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,358
Don't bother, she's not in.

37
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,235
Why not?

38
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,036
She's been gone for six weeks.
Sick.

39
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,432
Yes, but...

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,155
On sick leave. For six weeks.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,949
Do you have a key?

42
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,435
Me?

43
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,199
Oh, it's you.
We haven't seen you for a while.

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,951
No.

45
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,839
Where were you? Were you sick?

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,315
We wondered where you were.
We were talking about you.

47
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,868
The key's under the mat,
where it belongs.

48
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,629
I always see it when I'm cleaning.

49
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,871
The upper lock.

50
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,959
Please, after you,
you know the way.

51
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,076
A real ambulance
came and took her.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,629
I wasn't there,
but I sure heard about it.

53
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,994
Six weeks...

54
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,553
A long time.

55
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,359
I could do with a leave,
but our sort...

56
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,436
Where are you going? The key!

57
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,359
Strange...

58
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,917
She was always
compulsively tidy.

59
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,392
Lovely little bar, huh?

60
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,753
If you say so.

61
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,752
No, it's lovely.

62
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,514
Especially in the afternoon,
when everyone's working.

63
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,031
It gives you a feeling of...

64
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,393
Is that your line?

65
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,074
- Line?
- For meeting women.

66
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,152
No, I don't have a set routine.

67
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,797
On the contrary,
I'm a bit of a chameleon, you know?

68
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,268
I adapt.

69
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,235
Hahn? Hello.

70
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,755
Whiskey?

71
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,438
Whiskey... Hi...
milk, anything at all.

72
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,555
Angry?

73
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,114
- Pardon?
- You angry?

74
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,269
Two whiskeys.

75
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,634
I'm not angry, I'm...

76
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,598
- Heard you hit a glitch.
- I did.

77
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,719
Strange, I always thought
switching minds was a utopian joke.

78
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,075
- A joke?
- A very sophisticated one, but...

79
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,832
It's not a joke.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,036
You seem pretty upset about it.

81
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,868
Not about that.

82
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,350
Come on, out with it.
What's eating you?

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,114
I know why Vollmer died.

84
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,515
High voltage.

85
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,909
Right, high voltage.

86
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,390
Tell me.

87
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,279
He couldn't take it.

88
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,953
800 volts, you mean?

89
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,434
Sorry, bad joke.

90
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,549
- Why didn't I think of it?
- What?

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,954
The people in our simulation model

92
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,953
think their world
is the only real one.

93
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,515
So?

94
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,275
Who says this isn't
also a computer?

95
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,431
You, me, all of us...

96
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,276
Just electronic circuits.

97
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,355
Identity unit 3, 124,000,
named Hahn.

98
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,239
How does that sound?

99
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,031
Drunk.

100
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,989
The whiskey, peanuts...
all artificial.

101
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,272
Why are you gobbling them down?
Nervous?

102
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,951
No, I was thinking they taste good,
for artificial peanuts.

103
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,996
Don't joke about it.
You must have a screw loose.

104
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,390
Yeah, an artificial screw.

105
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,672
I bet Vollmer panicked.

106
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,956
- Vollmer, why?
- Because he knew.

107
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,189
Knew what?

108
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,196
That this isn't
the real world.

109
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,997
I mean, he was convinced of it.

110
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,391
And, if he was right,
then they'd...

111
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,593
Yes, <i>they. </i>

112
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,310
They'd have simply deleted him.
Exit Vollmer.

113
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,030
How did we deprogram Nobody?

114
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,189
Who?

115
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,670
Christopher Nobody.
His name was a joke. Well, how?

116
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,159
By pressing a button.

117
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,680
Yes, but discretely.

118
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,118
Do you understand?

119
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,510
It has to look like an accident

120
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,116
so the other units don't suspect.
Like Vollmer.

121
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,716
The system remains stable.
Do you see the parallel?

122
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,993
I see you're drunk.

123
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,877
And Lause?

124
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,152
Who? Oh, yeah.

125
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,671
Lause was removed
from the system too quickly

126
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,116
for them to have time
to think up a plausible excuse.

127
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
So they deleted him
from people's minds.

128
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,034
No one remembers GÃ¼nther Lause.

129
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,553
- Who?
- You see?

130
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,516
How it works.

131
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,109
God!

132
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,195
I was taken in.

133
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,352
Want me to drive you home?
You need to rest.

134
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,198
The contact unit! That's it!

135
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,439
The contact unit.

136
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,673
We needed a contact unit
for our simulation model to work.

137
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,034
Einstein.

138
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,596
If we're the simulation model
of a real world

139
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,753
there must be
an Einstein here who knows...

140
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,435
who's in contact with above.
Help me find him, Hahn!

141
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,397
You can always count on me.

142
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,916
It could be anyone,
Siskins, Gloria Fromm

143
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,038
Eva Vollmer, Walfang,
even you, Hahn.

144
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,871
Me?

145
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,712
Even you. Why not you?

146
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,838
Why not me? Well...

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,037
It's true,
I wouldn't just admit it.

148
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,270
You'd have to corner me,
trip me up.

149
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,953
OK, fine.

150
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,352
Besides, there's proof.

151
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,957
- People keep disappearing.
- Who else?

152
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,394
First, Lause.

153
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,108
- Now Maja Schmidt-Gentner.
- Who?

154
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,958
- My secretary.
- Gloria?

155
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,189
No, before her.

156
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,310
Oh, her.

157
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,833
On leave, supposedly.

158
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,275
But no one would go away
leaving their flat like that.

159
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,952
Yes, but...

160
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,758
Come, I'll show you!

161
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,833
If you insist.

162
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,756
The tab!

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,151
I don't know,
everything looks normal to me.

164
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,917
But two hours ago, it was completely
different. Everything was...

165
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,909
The bed...

166
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,234
the bathroom.

167
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,075
You?

168
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,196
I think he's gone crazy.

169
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,833
When did you get back?

170
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,073
An hour ago. The janitor...

171
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,754
Oh, forget it.

172
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,189
Come here...

173
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,753
When do you say the story appeared?

174
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,478
May 31.

175
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,551
On May 30 the world ends.

176
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,392
Uschi! Bring me May.

177
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,989
Right away.

178
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,598
How's the computer?

179
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,475
OK.

180
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,914
And Siskins?

181
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,835
Fine, thanks.

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,991
Still pals with Hartmann?

183
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,754
Maybe.

184
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,749
Why not? There are stranger reasons
to be friends.

185
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,751
Yeah, I guess.

186
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,071
Look, I'm doing you a favour.

187
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,232
You could give me
some information.

188
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,076
I'm lousy at making deals.

189
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,797
Does United Steel
have a deal with IKZ?

190
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,235
Thank you.

191
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,233
I think so.

192
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,115
But I can't provide photocopies,
if that's what you mean.

193
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,673
The official simulation program
must contain projections

194
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,273
that would be very useful
to United Steel.

195
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,519
I guess so.

196
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,793
May 31.

197
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,028
It's a new article.

198
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,039
Let me see.

199
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,199
"CS"... Christoph Simon,
our correspondent in Rome.

200
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,915
Could it have been another day?

201
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,875
No.

202
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,109
Here, ladies and gentlemen,
you see our reporters.

203
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,714
It's they who write
the stories.

204
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,916
They start with news leads

205
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,958
the yeast for any article -

206
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,750
then add background information
to write their stories.

207
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,435
The copy, once it's finished

208
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,672
is sent for typesetting,
as you'll now see.

209
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,836
Thank you, and good-bye.

210
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,073
Tell me...

211
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,230
Was there another edition
on May 31?

212
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,152
They're both there.

213
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,152
If the existing forecasts
don't meet Hartmann's needs,

214
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,670
could they program others in?

215
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,512
Yes, if they wanted to.

216
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,229
It was on this page.
But here's CS's article again.

217
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,719
Do they want to?

218
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,000
They, perhaps. Me, no.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,754
"Vanished into Thin Air",
I remember it perfectly.

220
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,629
"Vanished"... No idea.
"Drug Ring Broken up in Rimini".

221
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,156
Not as punchy, but there it is,
black on white.

222
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,432
I don't get it.

223
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,231
- This guy...
- Christoph Simon?

224
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,790
Yeah. Couldn't you
check with him to see

225
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,349
if he actually wrote this article?

226
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,110
Come on, I'll look like a fool.

227
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,439
Alright, if it helps clear this up.

228
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,430
Please!

229
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,396
Cable Christoph Simon in Rome
about his May 31 article.

230
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,109
Ask if there are any developments.

231
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,192
I'll see you out.

232
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,351
So this steel analysis?

233
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,431
- I forget.
- Forget?

234
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,639
Alright. Simulacron forecasts
transportation needs

235
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,313
through the year 2000.

236
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,872
That could be quite important
for a steel conglomerate.

237
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,632
Well, that's something.

238
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,999
Not Chinese.

239
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,594
- Why not?
- I dunno, it's too sweet.

240
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,399
No, it's not. It can be spicy, too.

241
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,915
That Stiller is definitely screwy.

242
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,316
I sent off your cable.

243
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,948
What? I just said that
to humour him.

244
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,153
It doesn't matter.

245
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,029
Uschi, get me a book on forecasting
transportation needs.

246
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,639
You've been looking at me
so strangely. Is something wrong?

247
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,748
I don't know.

248
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,510
A headache.

249
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,911
Then go lie down.

250
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,236
I don't feel bad,
I just have a headache.

251
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,631
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

Siskins...

281
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,916
or not Siskins.

282

Holm or...

00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,517
Pardon?

284
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,879
I only said good night
to the announcer.

285
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,995
It's Stiller, give me Siskins.

286
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,112
Hello, this is Stiller.

287
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,995
Feel like visiting
the computer room?

288
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,991
I have a surprise for you.

289
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,237
Come in.

290
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,354
What's up?

291
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,714
What's this?

292
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,108
It's you.

293
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,471
I programmed it myself.
Interesting, isn't it?

294
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,758
Yes, indeed. Very interesting.

295
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,993
It's funny.

296
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,516
You find it funny?

297
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,830
How many Siskins are there?

298
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,629
I have no idea.
Have you programmed others?

299
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,989
It's the only one in that world.

300
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,671
You're the only one here.

301
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,154
And above?

302
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,829
Where, above?

303
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,873
Don't you know "up"?

304
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,117
You're talking nonsense.

305
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,590
This is above, and that's below.

306
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,274
Or, how much deeper does it go?

307
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,069
Infinitely, maybe.

308
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,357
Yes, quite true.

309
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,312
And infinitely higher.

310
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,438
That's very funny.

311
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,119
What's he doing now?

312
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,112
Very impressive, Mr. Siskins.

313
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,069
Isn't it?

Nice setup, Mark.

320
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,319
Really nice.

321
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,993
What do you mean, nice?

322
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,878
Like the entire world.
It's nice, isn't it?

323
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,753
Quit playing around.
What do you want?

324
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,433
I know, Mark.

325
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,591
You can stop pretending.

326
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,273
What do you know?

327
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,716
That you're the contact.

328
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,273
You found out?

329
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,548
So what?

330
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,919
I just wanted to tell you,
Stiller knows.

331
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,511
- <i>Put him on</i>
- Sure.

332
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,192
It's him.

333
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,394
<i>But Stiller it was clear</i>
<i>from the start</i>

334
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,629
What was clear?

335
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,839
<i>That Holm was to be Hartmann's</i>
<i>contact The decision was mine</i>

336
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,319
<i>Mine alone</i>

337
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,997
Hartmann's contact?

338
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,313
Oh, God!

339
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,949
<i>What was that?</i>

340
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,432
He seems pretty screwy, our Fred.
He just walked out.

341
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,555
I think we can proceed.

342
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,314
<i>Yes I agree</i>

343
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,438
Hey, you? Are you OK?

344
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,070
Is he dead?

345
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,835
No, not exactly.
Hey, wake up!

346
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,072
Right, he's not dead.

347
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,278
Thanks, I'm OK.

348
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,040
Mr. Siskins ordered me

349
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,555
to take you home
and look after you.

350
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,869
Come along.

351
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,635
Go back to work, it's over.

352
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,878
Wake up. Breakfast's ready.

353
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,269
That's right, you're still here.

354
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,313
They're Mr. Siskins' orders.
They are.

355
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,435
Well, then...

356
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,553
Got a cigarette?

357
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,475
Thanks.

358
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,073
I think...

359
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,592
therefore I am. Right?

360
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,758
Yes, I exist.

361
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,268
I can't be alone in thinking
that nothing really exists.

362
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,115
Right. For Plato, reality exists
in the realm of ideas.

363
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,918
And Aristotle!

364
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,434
He conceived of matter
as passive non-substance

365
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,110
that only becomes reality
by thought.

366
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,589
Got a friend?

367
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,116
What? Of course.

368
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,469
Good. Let's suppose
he disappears without a trace.

369
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,795
He's standing next to you,
and suddenly he's gone.

370
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,030
But that's...

371
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,838
We're just supposing.

372
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,516
So, you inform the police.

373
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,638
Next day, the papers
run a story on it.

374
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,756
Suddenly everyone maintains

375
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,356
this friend never existed.
So they maintain.

376
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,873
What would you tell them?

377
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,271
Me? I'd tell them they're crazy.

378
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,870
After all, even the police...

379
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,872
The police also say
they never heard of him.

380
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,589
But it was in the papers.
According to you.

381
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,275
It's not there anymore.
There's something different.

382
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,591
I see.

383
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,516
You realize that
I've given you a hot tip

384
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,195
how to get yourself
declared crazy. In case

385
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,918
you ever need it.

386
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,513
More coffee?

387
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,033
No, thanks.

388
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,712
I'll take a shower.

389
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,676
I'm sure you all know
the reason we're here.

390
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,159
Of course, we...

391
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,996
The story in the <i>News</i> took us all
by surprise, aroused our concern.

392
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,996
Mr. Siskins, I'd like to hear you
answer the charges.

393
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,280
Certainly, Mr. Secretary of State.

394
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,719
To my regret, I must acknowledge

395
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,239
that Simulacron 1 has been
the object of misuse.

396
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,798
Mr. Holm will report
on the situation.

397
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,915
Excuse me...

398
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,669
but who is Mr. Holm?

399
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,677
Mr. Holm is assistant
to Mr. Stiller, our director.

400
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,110
I see.

401
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,832
So, well...

402
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,951
during an inspection we discovered

403
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,033
that a program completely
unrelated to our research

404
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,910
had been loaded into Simulacron.

405
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,473
And for what purpose?

406
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,553
That's hard to say.

407
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,112
The answers obtained
by this new program

408
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,158
are meaningful only
if one knows the questions.

409
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,236
I see, and...

410
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,429
And the questions are known
only to the programmer.

411
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,830
Who is?

412
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,833
We're not absolutely sure yet.

413
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,115
But we have suspects in mind.

414
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,909
And they are?

415
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,799
Mr. Holm, please.

416
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,831
Naturally, I can only
report on things

417
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,797
that I've seen for myself.

418
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,673
Draw your own conclusions.

419
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,075
Lately I've been doing
a lot of testing at night

420
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,876
and Dr. Stiller has always been
at the computer.

421
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,916
Dr. Stiller?

422
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,837
Several times he's thrown me out

423
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,993
saying he wanted to be alone.

424
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,393
I asked what he was doing.
He said, "None of your business. "

425
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,556
I'm sure he'll deny it all.

426
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,388
Dr. Stiller?

427
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,591
What do you have to say
to these accusations?

428
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,191
Which ones?

429
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,955
That you were alone at the computer,
and threw Holm out.

430
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,549
If he says so, it must be true.

431
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,195
I can't stand him.

432
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,789
Yes or no...

433
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,956
Did you use the computer
for unauthorized purposes?

434
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,509
What if I did?

435
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,199
What would it matter?

436
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,035
Unheard of!

437
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,236
Yes, unheard of!

438
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,994
I hear...

439
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,629
you.

440
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,909
I hear.

441
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,357
He's...

442
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,635
Crazy.

443
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,514
Yes, he is.

444
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,914
Is he?

445
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,959
Stop! Your cigarette...

446
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,350
Are you sure that's a cigarette?

447
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,231
It's...

448
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,436
The idea of a cigarette.

449
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,435
You see?

450
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,828
The real cigarettes
are somewhere else.

451
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,834
Where real people sit
on real chairs. Is that a chair?

452
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,751
Say, "It's a chair. "

453
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,035
- It's a chair.
- It's not a chair.

454
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,036
It's...

455
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,353
the idea of an idea of an idea...

456
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,192
- The man is...
- Crazy.

457
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,351
We agreed on the term long ago.

458
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,318
What colour's your coffee?

459
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:28,991
It's brown.

460
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,999
Why is it brown?

461
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,990
Because coffee's brown. Isn't it?

462
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,315
Of course.

463
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,752
Your coffee's not brown
because coffee is brown.

464
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,075
But rather

465
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,195
because somewhere outside this box

466
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,033
there's real coffee
that may be brown.

467
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,549
But it may be purple, too

468
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,276
and some idiot
made this stuff brown

469
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,753
to laugh at us
drinking brown coffee.

470
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,558
You're not a human, sir...

471
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,756
Stop it.

472
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,790
You're nothing.

473
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,313
There's the rub.

474
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,276
Because nothing doesn't think

475
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,517
it's secretary of state.

476
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,229
That's it.

477
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,836
Do you remember... who was it?

478
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,030
Professor Vollmer, right.
A similar situation.

479
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,316
Still...

480
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,233
Excuse me, but...

481
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,275
I'm the psychologist
at the Institute.

482
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,597
I've been observing Stiller
for some time

483
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,908
very closely.

484
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,516
He's suffering from a case
of acute paranoia.

485
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,633
He's an extreme example
of psychological degeneration.

486
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,997
He is, in so many words,

487
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,475
not responsible for his actions.

488
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,758
I recommend he be put
on leave immediately.

489
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,793
For treatment...

490
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,389
I mean

491
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,549
I'm certain he'll return to normal

492
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,554
one day, perhaps.

493
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,038
Thank you, Hahn.
Thanks so much.

494
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,596
I think that would eliminate
the problem, gentlemen.

495
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,392
Yes, indeed. If Stiller...

496
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,430
So he's not responsible, Hirse?

497
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,999
No, definitely not.

498
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,510
For now
I recommend Mr. Holm assume

499
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,957
Stiller's responsibilities.

500
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,831
As you like. You're still free
to make personnel decisions.

501
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,039
Thank you, gentlemen.

502
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,077
I'd be grateful if you'd prepare
a clarification for the press.

503
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,916
Of course.

504
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,279
Still, the parallel to...

505
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,872
Professor Vollmer
is quite baffling.

506
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,828
And now?

507
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,119
Nothing, I'm on leave.

508
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,068
That's terrific.
There's no one in Holm's way.

509
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,515
So what?

510
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,919
"So what"?

511
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,516
You used to care about
what happened to the computer.

512
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,875
That was then, this is now.

513
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,156
I can't figure you out.

514
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,588
Tell me...

515
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,638
What are the limits
to the perceptive faculties

516
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,233
of our identity units?

517
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,231
Listen, suppose

518
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,949
we were beings who had been
programmed in a computer.

519
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,156
We'd sit here, drinking whiskey.

520
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,479
We'd perceive what is in fact
our imaginary world

521
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,155
as if it were the real one.

522
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,551
Of course. An electronically
simulated environment

523
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,280
would appear real
to an electronic being.

524
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,229
Good.

525
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,957
And can glitches occur?

526
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,196
It's possible, but not very.

527
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,312
And what would a glitch be like?

528
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,354
A glitch?

529
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,475
Here's a simple example:

530
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,949
You're driving down a street
that suddenly ends because

531
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,951
it hasn't been fully programmed.

532
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,678
But after a few seconds
the artificial being

533
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,831
would see a completed street

534
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,992
because the correcting software
had kicked in.

535
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,759
It's obvious:

536
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,710
What can't exist, doesn't.

537
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,872
Did you read my headline?

538
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,508
"Director Suffers Nervous Breakdown"

539
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,148
- I don't like it.
- Why not?

540
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,075
It's too simple.

541
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,398
Stories written by life
are never simple.

542
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,149
No? But truth
is stranger than fiction.

543
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,433
Either way. Two sides

544
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,910
of the same coin.
You read it?

545
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,308
What?

546
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,155
The cable from Simon in Rome.

547
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,594
No, what's he say?

548
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,593
"Never wrote about
drugs in Rimini.

549
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,035
Besides, was sick at the time. "

550
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,758
That's impossible.

551
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,429
That's not all.

552
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,912
Naturally I asked
what's in his edition of May 31.

553
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,631
- Want to see?
- Give it to me.

554
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,711
"Mine reads
'Vanished into Thin Air'.

555
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,997
Hope that helps.
Christoph Simon. "

556
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,751
I must be going crazy.

557
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,595
I can't help think that

558
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,513
Stiller's caught up
in a massive intrigue.

559
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,029
Siskins must be a bigger gangster
than I thought.

560
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,952
I brought your things.

561
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,599
That's very kind.

562
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,914
Fred, I'm so sorry.

563
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,350
About what?

564
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,353
Your sick leave.

565
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,958
Especially since
I'm partly to blame.

566
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,994
What do you mean?

567
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,551
I've been spying for Siskins.

568
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,150
I was obliged to tell him
all you said that night

569
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,993
and everything else.

570
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,795
Of course.

571
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,635
I've known that for a long time.

572
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,188
But?

573
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,792
But I still like you.

574
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,954
Me, too.

575
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,195
Whiskey?

576
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,949
Yes, please.

577
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,556
Does he pay you, or?

578
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,948
Or what?

579
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,474
Do you love him?

580
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,794
Both.

581
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,038
At least you're honest.

582
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,354
You're my type of man,
well almost.

583
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,111
You're exactly my type of woman.

584
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,518
Siskins is exactly my type of man.

585
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,994
I can't bring myself to leave him.

586
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,068
Do you want to?

587
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,954
I don't know.

588
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,553
Probably not.

589
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,116
I don't know if I could.

590
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,119
You can if you want.

591
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,872
That's a fairy tale.

592
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,075
Right.

593
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,676
I'm one of his puppets.

594
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,629
But what's even worse is...

595
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,398
I love it.

596
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,953
At least at night.

597
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,513
Want to sleep with me?

598
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,594
How's it going?

599
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,716
We're running the analysis.

600
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,519
I hope you can interpret the data.

601
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,189
No need to insult me.

602
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,799
I don't want our friend Hartmann
to make a bad investment.

603
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,636
I told you, you're not wanted here.
Beat it!

604
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,118
This department is still
my responsibility, Mr. Holm.

605
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,472
Don't be impertinent.

606
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,234
I'm not being impertinent.
Not at all.

607
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,950
I'm merely doing my job.

608
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,279
We'll decide what your job is,
my good man.

609
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,631
You're mistaken there, my good man.

610
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,637
My contract contains
a precise job description.

611
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,076
Contracts can be terminated.

612
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,471
Or broken, like Dr. Stiller's.

613
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,596
What's he got to do with it?

614
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,751
Quite a bit, doesn't it?

615
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,593
- Does who?
- What?

616
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,672
What, what?
Besides, Stiller's on leave.

617
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,912
I see.
That's something else entirely.

618
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,670
What you did to him's scandalous...

619
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,477
Watch it!

620
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,393
Both of you.
But personally I'm curious

621
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,956
why you're so intent
on keeping me out of here.

622
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,194
Because you're incompetent,
that's why.

623
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,998
That's the only reason.

624
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,878
And now, please, we're busy.

625
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,717
OK, my good man.

626
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,272
But you'll hear from me.

627
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,078
Good-bye, Mr. Siskins.

628
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,513
He's next.

629
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,151
You should watch what you say.

630
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,389
Why?

631
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,189
There are employee committees,
unions.

632
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,038
Don't forget that.

633
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,749
Alright, I'll do my best.

634
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,229
I hope so.

635
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,557
Finally! Make sure
he doesn't stir up trouble.

636
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,396
- Yes, sir.
- Of course, Mr. Holm.

637
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,311
Tell me, Holm.

638
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,830
What about Stiller?

639
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,000
If everything went
according to plan,

640
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,398
he's in a straightjacket right now.

641
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,639
My head!

642
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,472
Yes, it's me.

643
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,999
What time is it?

644
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,354
330.

645
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,478
Morning or afternoon?

646
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,548
Afternoon.

647
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,873
Then we slept for 18 hours.

648
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,595
You slept for 18 hours.

649
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,636
I'll see who the idiot is.

650
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,071
Great. Siskins' latest trick.

651
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,508
- What?
- Have a look.

652
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,518
Hurry, you must get away.

653
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,159
I don't care.

654
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,153
They'll put you
in a straightjacket!

655
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,352
Maybe I belong in one.

656
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,509
Stop joking.

657
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,193
Hurry up!

658
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,079
Take the fire escape.

659
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,270
What can I do for you?

660
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,196
The madman.

661
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,275
Which madman?
What do you mean?

662
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,677
Stiller. He lives here.

663
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,276
You mean Freddy?
Yes, he is crazy...

664
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,239
in bed, if you get my drift.

665
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,556
In bed?

666
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,233
Crazy. Definitely.

667
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,353
Let us by.

668
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,030
Or else...

669
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,588
Alright, if you insist.

670
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,630
Eva!

671
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,639
<i>Open up police!</i>

672
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,237
<i>We know you're inside</i>

673
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,958
<i>Stiller don't make it any harder</i>

674
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,232
<i>We'll break down the door</i>

675
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,471
Get in, you can't escape.

676
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,990
I'll take you to a room here.

677
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,032
No one will find you.

678
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,589
Thank you.

679
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,433
My God! You?

680
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,517
Yes, me.

681
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,868
What's wrong?

682
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,151
Don't you get it? It's him!

683
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,353
The contact unit.

684
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,519
Of course, him!

685
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,629
What an idiot I am!
I fell for it!

686
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,028
But Stiller...

687
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,398
Hahn's been providing us
information on IKZ for months.

688
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,433
What's the problem?

689
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,875
Information?

690
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,589
Yes. On Siskins and the computer.

691
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,117
Then...

692
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,234
Still suffering
from your delusions?

693
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,439
Delusions?

694
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,430
Listen, Hahn.
I like Vollmer's delusions

695
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,034
more and more.

696
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,873
Yeah, I know what you'll say...

697
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,400
A madman finds proof everywhere.

698
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,196
Maybe I am crazy after all.

699
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,476
But...

700
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,276
Vollmer died for a reason.

701
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,109
If he was right,
God, or someone, help us!

702
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,353
By the way,
I got an answer from Italy.

703
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,708
You got... What did it say?

704
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,709
You were right.

705
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,274
I was right.

706
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,310
Simon never wrote the article
on the Rimini bust.

707
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:39,038
In his edition, the headline is
"Vanished into Thin Air".

708
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,871
What?

709
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,789
It's troubling

710
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,439
but we'll figure it out,
don't worry.

711
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,558
When is the strike?

712
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,268
What strike?

713
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,628
The strike at IKZ. You said...

714
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,792
Oh, that. I don't know.

715
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,434
Tomorrow or...

716
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,274
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

717
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,634
Sure, I'm fine.

718
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,556
For now.

719
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,796
What strike?

720
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,199
A certain Fritz Walfang
has been organizing the workers.

721
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,153
To have you reinstated.

722
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,789
Reinstated?

723
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,716
It's great: Worker initiative,
solidarity. You should be proud.

724
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,632
None of it matters anymore.

725
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,559
You're right, Hahn.

726
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,075
His nerves are completely shot.

727
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,396
GÃ¼nther Lause?

728
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,794
Chief of security at IKZ?

729
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,232
Siskins' party.

730
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,670
Say something!

731
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,993
Like what?

732
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,554
- We can't both be...
- Crazy?

733
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,513
Why not?

734
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,072
You're the expert.

735
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,713
Where are you going?

736
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,509
- I'm just going.
- You can't go.

737
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,755
Why not?

738
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,599
Every cop is carrying your picture.

739
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,188
Tell me...

740
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,355
the story about
your so-called contact unit...

741
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,151
I just meant...

742
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,556
I want to find out who's crazy...

743
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,955
us, or everyone else.

744
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,791
Well now, that's what I call
a noble motive.

745
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,959
Come with me,
I'll smuggle you out.

746
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,959
Your only chance.

747
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,950
It's not Siskins, Holms,
Gloria Fromm or Walfang...

748
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,271
It can't be Rupp
or you or me or Eva...

749
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,795
That's ridiculous. Eva Vollmer...

750
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,038
Stop at that pay phone.

751
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,438
My God, where were you?

752
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,195
I slept at your place,
I climbed in through a window.

753
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,994
No, but I was worried.

754
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,473
OK, fine.
Could I see you, right now?

755
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,555
Anywhere.

756
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,679
No, nothing urgent.
My God, I just want to see you.

757
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,549
I need you.

758
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,998
I'm not tense, I'm...

759
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,079
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

760
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,315
That's Stiller, the murderer.

761
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,070
The murderer's getting away!

762
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,309
Murderer!

763
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,519
Are you sick?

764
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,636
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

765
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,435
<i>Today we're going marching</i>

766
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,799
<i>to the sound of a new beat. </i>

767
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,229
<i>/n the lovely Westerwald forest</i>

768
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,551
<i>the wind blows so cold</i>

769
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,630
<i>/n the lovely Westerwald</i>

770
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,077
<i>the wind blows so cold</i>

771
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,434
<i>Oh you lovely Westerwald!</i>

772
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,113
<i>Eucalyptus cough drops</i>

773
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,955
<i>The wind blows so cold</i>
<i>over the hill</i>

774
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:30,916
Yes, sir?

775
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,789
Roast filet of wild boar
and some GewÃ¼rztraminer.

776
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,072
Very good. Excellent.

777
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,035
Halt!

778
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,797
Left face!

779
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,269
Halt!

780
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,673
Right face!

781
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,316
Fire!

782
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,794
<i>Oh you lovely Westerwald</i>

783
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,799

<i>penetrates deep into our hearts</i>

787
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,073
I'm a public safety inspector.
I'm here to check the exits.

788
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,628
Sent it back!

789
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,394
Barbarians!

790
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,152
Where does this door lead?

791
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,273
- The garbage cans.
- I'll have a look.

792
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,272
<i>Were killed</i>

793
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,112
<i>The highway between Essen</i>

794
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,117
<i>and Bochum was closed</i>

01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,877
<i>36-year-old Fred Stiller</i>

797

01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,197
<i>and that of Franz Hahn</i>

802
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,397
<i>a colleague of Stiller's at /KZ</i>

803
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,155
<i>who died today</i>
<i>in mysterious circumstances</i>

804
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,237
<i>Stiller is described</i>
<i>as unstable and dangerous</i>

805
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,636
<i>People are warned to avoid contact</i>
<i>with the fugitive</i>

806
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,758
<i>and to inform the police</i>

807
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,639
<i>of any information</i>
<i>regarding his whereabouts</i>

808
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,519
Franz Hahn.

809
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,192
A man who knew too much.

810
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,878
My God, are you hurt?

811
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,117
Say something, please.

812
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,352
What's going on?
Someone fired a shot.

813
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,071
I fired, because...

814
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,028
I was afraid.

815
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,352
Why are you here?

816
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,438
I heard you're wanted
for my father's death.

817
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,599
I just don't believe it.

818
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,192
I thought you needed me,
I wanted to be with you.

819
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,868
- You can't stay here.
- But...

820
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,189
No buts!

821
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,195
I didn't murder anyone.

822
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,232
It's all a plot
by Siskins and the police.

823
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,153
All I can do now is defend myself...

824
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,709
by any means.
No one believes me.

825
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,553
I believe you.

826
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,992
And I love you.

827
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,514
Go now.

828
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:02,113
When I know more,
I'll come into town or I'll call.

829
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,910
I'm scared for you.

830
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,598
Go now, Eva. You must go.

831
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,354
Believe me.

832
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,630
<i>How did she know I was here?</i>

833
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,429
<i>I never told her about my cabin</i>

834
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,033
<i>Then it's her</i>

835
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,433
<i>And I'm nothing</i>

836
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,919
Why are you here?

837
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,959
Aren't you afraid?

838
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,714
I'm a murderer. Do you hear?

839
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,790
A murderer!

840
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,111
Tell me...

841
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,917
- What was your name?
- Echo.

842
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,637
An unusual name.

843
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,112
Not in my family.

844
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,997
Perhaps I should take you
to a hospital.

845
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,515
No, I'm fine.
It was just the car.

846
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,119
Please don't smoke

847
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:21,830
<i>monsieur?</i>

848
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,235
Echo.

849
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,319
Mr. Echo.

850
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:30,268
I'm extremely allergic to nicotine.

851
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,718
The other day
I saw a fantastic accident.

852
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,478
Simply awful.

853
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,675
A lamppost went right through a car

854
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,679
and the driver...

855
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,632
Stop! I feel sick. I'll throw up.

856
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,995
<i>Mon dieu, </i> please, not on the seats.
The leather...

857
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,036
Stop, the man wants to get out.

858
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,036
I wouldn't try to run away.

859
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,634
Sorry, darling, but I don't
want you to escape from me.

860
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,628
Naturally.

861
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:37,069
But you must have
more subtle methods...

862
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,793
you people up there.

863
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,954
Up there, yes,
but not down here.

864
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,109
You understand a lot,
Fred Stiller.

865
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,231
You've become a bit too
intelligent for us.

866
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,871
Are you the contact unit...

867
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,515
as we call it?

868
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,914
I'm the projection of a real Eva
from the real world.

869
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,320
We don't have
contact units anymore.

870
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,679
They were a mistake,
we got rid of them.

871
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,070
And now you'll get rid of me.

872
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:20,672
Like a caged rat
after your experiment.

873
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,475
I want to help you, believe me.

874
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:28,235
Please come with me.
Don't cause trouble. Please.

875
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,473
I don't give a damn.

876
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,076
Do what you want with me.

877
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,468
I give up.

878
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,111
Deprogram me, kill me, anything.
I just want it to end...

879
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,478
this horrible nightmare.

880
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,878
You can trust me, Fred.

881
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,070
Here.

882
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,470
There's a lot I have to explain.

883
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,354
You can do anything
you want with me.

884
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,359
Even so, listen...

885
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,557
There never was an Eva Vollmer
in your world.

886
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,271
When I appeared, you quickly
threw together a memory.

887
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,759
That's how simulation units react.

888
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,480
I know how simulation units react.

889
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:58,519
We shouldn't have let you develop
your own simulation model.

890
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,516
It's easy to learn too much.

891
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:05,710
But we needed the closest
possible resemblance

892
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,314
to our own technological standard.

893
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,399
Got any cigarettes?

894
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,435
And Vollmer?

895
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,988
At first we found it interesting

896
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,869
and wanted to observe
what happened.

897
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:40,799
Of course he became a threat
to the entire system

898
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,796
so he had to have
an accident. Right?

899
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,959
There was a decision to send
an observer down here.

900
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,233
That's me.

901
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,478
I was periodically
called back to report.

902
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,950
That's why you were gone
that night.

903
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,315
I understand.

904
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:06,797
And Lause?

905
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,279
He knew all about Vollmer.

906
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:14,353
We programmed him away
because he was going to tell you.

907
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,918
I love you, Fred.

908
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:24,035
I want to stay with you.
We have to find a solution.

909
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,434
We?

910
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,032
What's it got to do with you?

911
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,754
I love you.

912
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,033
OK, fine.

913
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,031
They have to delete you.

914
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,830
You could cause
your world to be deleted.

915
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,874
They'll pull the plug

916
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,634
and it'll be over.

917
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:51,112
The man in my world
who's sitting at the computer

918
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,756
is a total megalomaniac.

919
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,075
His power over this artificial world
drove him crazy.

920
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:03,112
He thinks he's God,
he's playing his games with you.

921
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,116
You, for example... He didn't want
to kill you right away.

922
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,633
On the contrary.

923
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,198
He got enormous pleasure
from your fear

924
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,513
and your despair.

925
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,717
What will he do to me?

926
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,559
You'll be shot.

927
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,469
When?

928
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:31,868
Tomorrow morning.

929
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,755
- So we still have some time.
- Yes.

930
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:40,515
At night, there's only technical
supervision of the computer.

931
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,039
Like a drink?

932
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,594
Yes, a whiskey.

933
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,389
Tell me...

934
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,276
Why should I trust you?

935
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:05,555
I want to help you.

936
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,712
Well, we'll see.

937
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,149
Cheers.

938
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,432
What happened to Hahn?

939
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,113
You saw.

940
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,873
We had to, after that screw-up
at the paper.

941
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,595
- Imagine what would've...
- Bravo.

942
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,873
Good work.

943
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,155
My attacks, all my dizzy spells?

944
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:37,989
You get them when he tries
to hook-up with your mind.

945
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,277
And the street that vanished
and reappeared?

946
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,480
A faulty circuit, nothing more.

947
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,710
Something doesn't add up.

948
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,155
Why?

949
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,278
How can a real person
love someone who's not?

950
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,833
Very simple.

951
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,875
Because you remind me
of someone I loved, up there.

952
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,516
Who was he?

953
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,349
He's...

954
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,956
You'd call him technical director,

955
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,395
responsible
for our simulation model.

956
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:23,437
Tell me, what's his name?

957
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,908
Fred Stiller.

958
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,755
That's me.

959
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,270
No.

960
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,991
But you just said...

961
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,758
Like Vollmer did with Lause,
and you with Siskins.

962
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:57,669
He programmed a copy of himself
for the fun of it.

963
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,273
Do I resemble him?

964
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:03,953
In appearance, yes.

965
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,150
But not in character.

966
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,277
Fred is a megalomaniac

967
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,358
and you are you.

968
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,439
I love you.

969
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,679
I love you, too.

970
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,559
Come here, please.

971
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,230
Why are you getting dressed?

972
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,158
I have another headache.

973
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,838
But this time it's worse.

974
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,033
Where are you going?

975
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:24,709
I don't know.

976
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,678
The Institute, probably.

977
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,153
No, Fred. Please stay!
Let me help you.

978
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,912
<i>Since Holm's been here</i>

979
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,152
<i>everything's upside down</i>

980
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,113
<i>We can't go near the computer</i>

981
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:16,796
<i>For that reason alone</i>
<i>I urge you to join in the strike</i>

982
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,235
<i>so Stiller will be reinstated</i>

983
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,388
But he's a murderer! A madman!

984
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,199
He lined his own pockets!

985
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,749
Murderer! Murderer!

986
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,033
<i>Quiet down please</i>
<i>Just for one second</i>

987
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:00,950
<i>Stiller was set up</i>

988
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,917
<i>Set up by Siskins and Holm</i>

989
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:07,438
Friends, listen to me!

990
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,792
I am Fred Stiller.

991
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,437
What Fritz Walfang just told you

992
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,275
is true.

993
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,390
Friends, listen to me, please!

994
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,353
It's true, what he just said.

995
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,436
It's true!

996
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,629
I switched your mind
as you lay dying down there.

997
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:07,429
Like that time Einstein came,
instead of Walfang.

998
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:40,835
Hair, eyes...

999
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,469
mouth

1000
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,149
neck

1001
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,714
shoulders.

1002
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,074
I am.

1003
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:51,029
I am.
