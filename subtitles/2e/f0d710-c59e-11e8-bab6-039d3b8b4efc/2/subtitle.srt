1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
Alright. We're giving you a cool
finishing stitches.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,867
We can't stitch it up like this.
Relax, will you?

3
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:09,598
Relax!

4
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:13,802
What's that sound?
Did you get into a fight?
Are you hurt?

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:21,509
No, I'm fine. Teacher,
Il-mae is mine, right?

6
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:28,948
Everyone, bow to our teacher!

7
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:32,653
We welcome you, sir.

8
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:34,286
Teacher!

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,292
Tae-il!

10
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:45,031
Tae-il!

11
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:55,173
Why are you crying
on this happy day?

12
00:00:57,953 --> 00:01:03,914
- Then why are you crying?
- Because I'm so proud of you!

13
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:12,398
How much did you nosebleed
this time?

14
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:21,941
Not too much. Only about a bucket
this big... 2 of it...

15
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:24,104
You did well.

16
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,110
C'mon. Get up.

17
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:40,351
So, where is your bride?

18
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:44,196
My bride?

19
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:49,294
Yes, your bride!

20
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:56,868
Of course!
My bride just got off work.

21
00:01:57,446 --> 00:02:00,074
So my bride should be here soon.

22
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:07,715
Oh, I see...

23
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:13,660
you're already getting excited
just thinking about her, huh?

24
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,763
Teacher! Please, don't touch it.

25
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,235
Don't be shy.

26
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:25,029
She's here!

27
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:36,346
Hello?

28
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:43,255
Tae-il... What are you doing?

29
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:52,866
Tae-il!

30
00:02:55,838 --> 00:02:59,604
Congratulations!
Tae-il passed
level 1 bar exam

31
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:09,375
Did you really?

32
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:19,826
JOO Il-mae! How lonely you've been,
spending so many nights,

33
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:26,492
all by yourself! Open it.

34
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:50,891
This is my heart. From now on,
I'll breathe if you tell me to breathe,

35
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,656
And I'll stop if you tell me to stop.

36
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:04,195
Stupid! You're so stupid!

37
00:04:08,644 --> 00:04:10,839
Stupid! Stupid!

38
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:29,023
Teacher!

39
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:34,729
Teacher!

40
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:36,830
Dad!

41
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:39,271
- For Tae-il!
- For Tae-il!

42
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:47,809
Always wait for your return...
your apartment!

43
00:04:49,351 --> 00:05:04,528
I call you because I miss you!
And I hear your lovely voice...

44
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,534
Stop!

45
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:08,900
This is the happiest day in my life

46
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:15,634
since the birth of
my daughter Il-mae!

47
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,244
Since we're in full swing of
celebration,

48
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:26,712
let's have the engagement
ceremony for SOHN Tae-il

49
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:30,520
and JOO Il-mae right now!

50
00:05:30,592 --> 00:05:31,991
Dad!

51
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:35,218
Yes?

52
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:38,666
I wanna get married!

53
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:44,272
Sure! I'm so proud of Tae-il,
my SOHN in law!

54
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:50,004
It's not Tae-il!

55
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:55,079
It's not him

56
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:02,155
He's not the one I want to marry!

57
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:13,863
Teacher, you're just joking
with me, right?

58
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:18,373
You're worried that
I'm gonna mess up the 2nd exam,

59
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,965
And that's why you're doing this.

60
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:23,034
Shut up!

61
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:37,748
Please tell me this isn't real.
Tell me Il-mae wasn't serious.

62
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:46,030
What did you tell me before?
"Sir, I protect my woman!"

63
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:48,800
Well... you did really well.

64
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:55,602
I trusted you with my daughter...

65
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:57,144
Teacher.

66
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:09,483
You're worthless!

67
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:22,271
Even if this is the end of the world,
you can't do this to him.

68
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:25,069
You know he lived his whole life
just for you.

69
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:29,403
You're killing him.

70
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:36,048
But, dad, I slept with that man.
Many many times!

71
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,712
What?

72
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:49,787
I'm not a virgin anymore.
That's why I can't go back to Tae-il.

73
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:41,811
You worthless shit.

74
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:53,388
We did our best.

75
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:57,890
Okay, let's make a contract.

76
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:02,333
Thank you. I'll convey your message
to our president.

77
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:04,802
They want to contract
the agreement.

78
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,783
Il-mae! Il-mae! Get off me!

79
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,610
Let's go!

80
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:23,422
What are you doing?

81
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,457
It all started when we came to Seoul.

82
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,497
So let's go back to Pusan!

83
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:32,132
- Tae-il!
- Come on!

84
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,430
Let's go back to Pusan!

85
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:38,496
What am I? A joke?

86
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:42,665
You think you can just show up
like this and

87
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:49,643
cause all this ruckus and I'd
go with you?

88
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:54,883
Il-mae, I love you! I really do!

89
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:02,786
You don't know what love is!

90
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:15,903
- Il-mae!
- Excuse me, sir!

91
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:17,808
- Get off me!
- Sir!

92
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:22,249
Il-mae, don't do this. Think about it
one more time.

93
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:26,515
Do you know how I raised you?

94
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:27,418
Why are you acting like this?

95
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:31,255
- Let's go, ok?
- Get off me!!

96
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:35,793
Tae-il! Tae-il!

97
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:39,664
If you don't go with me, then
I'm gonna kill myself right here!

98
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:42,864
I already gave you my heart.

99
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:48,372
I can't live without you!

100
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:52,004
Don't be stupid. I'm not going.

101
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:59,154
Il-mae! Il-mae!

102
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,586
Tae-il!

103
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:11,055
Teacher, the sky looks
awfully blue today!

104
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:15,093
Tae-il!

105
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:57,103
I can't believe she's doing this!
Now what's gonna happen to him?

106
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,179
What am I supposed to do now?

107
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:08,922
You awake? You know how long
you've been passed out?

108
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:14,119
3 days!
You really scared me this time.

109
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:21,197
I prepared some seafood porridge.

110
00:12:22,504 --> 00:12:25,905
Kang-chul left his gang and
opened up a sushi restaurant.

111
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:30,809
He made this for you using
only the freshest ingredients!

112
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:48,195
Too hot, huh?
Should I cool it down for you?

113
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,664
Give me a cigarette!

114
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,900
What? You got a problem?

115
00:13:05,614 --> 00:13:13,578
No. I heard in Japan a father and
daughter in law smoke together.

116
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:21,054
I say, where are the morals
and ethics in that?

117
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:28,764
I mean, it's about liberation.

118
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,800
Cultural liberation!

119
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:39,608
We need to adopt that thinking
too, right?

120
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:46,918
- So what are you gonna do?
- About what?

121
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:49,647
About Il-mae!

122
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:58,227
We'll get her back. We will.

123
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,964
How the hell are you gonna get her back
when her heart has changed?

124
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:31,224
First, we gotta find out
who that guy is

125
00:14:36,471 --> 00:14:37,495
Il-mae!

126
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:44,612
English, French, Japanese and now,
Chinese, too?

127
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:48,139
Wow, I'd better study harder
to be your husband

128
00:15:11,673 --> 00:15:12,901
Who beat you?

129
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:16,808
I don't know. A woman came
into the bathroom and...

130
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:31,221
Il-mae!
How about a hot cup of coffee?

131
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:33,321
I'll get it.

132
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:38,423
Nonsense. I'll get it. Wait here.

133
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,991
Relax!

134
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:49,200
Come on, spill it out!

135
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:54,975
I'm sorry! Please stop.
I have hemorrhoid.

136
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:59,418
You should listen to your buddy
if he tells you to stop.

137
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:05,289
No, you're worse. If you're
his friend, you should've stopped him.

138
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,490
- Look! Look over there!
- Hold on. I should punish...

139
00:16:09,564 --> 00:16:11,156
We got the wrong guy.

140
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,840
Shit!

141
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:30,948
- Why didn't you tell me earlier!!
- You didn't listen!

142
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:43,488
Would you like to order?

143
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:47,992
In a minute. Calm down!

144
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:51,899
Really?

145
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,279
Bastard! What?

146
00:17:05,153 --> 00:17:09,146
You must know your enemy to win!

147
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:14,785
What's there to know? He's a rich boy
with tons of money! Fuck.

148
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:19,163
Fuck? Watch your language!
What am I? Your friend?

149
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:45,751
LEE Seung-no! Age, 30!

150
00:17:47,095 --> 00:18:00,202
According to my investigation,
he emigrated to US at the age of 12,

151
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:03,505
received masters in psychology, then
graduated Harvard Law School,

152
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:05,375
received MBA at Wharton and

153
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:08,381
returned to Korea in 1999.

154
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:14,479
Impressive! Level 1 bar exam is
nothing compared to him.

155
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:17,719
Are you on my side or his?

156
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:20,283
Of course I'm on your side.

157
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:27,192
In 1999, he established
Phoenix Software, which

158
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:30,965
exports various games to
international markets.

159
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:39,274
In 2001, he was awarded for his
excellence in his industry.

160
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:43,716
Any weaknesses?

161
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:59,996
Neuschwanstein, or sometimes
it's known as New Swan Castle.

162
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:09,474
King Ludwig ll, a fan of Wagner,
built this castle for his lover.

163
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:18,986
But sadly, they never lived
together, right?

164
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:22,749
I'm different.

165
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:30,521
I won't spend my life only building
a castle for someone I love

166
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,206
Il-mae, I love you!

167
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:49,814
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Hey, look at that
cuckoo flying over there!

168
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:53,320
You only know one side of a coin.

169
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:58,448
2002 Sisa English pg. 482.

170
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,528
King Ludwig ll and Wagner were
gay lovers.

171
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:09,069
Eventually, Ludwig destroyed
the castle, missing him

172
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:15,369
Why don't you go look for
a young boy?

173
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:18,037
Tae-il! You!!!

174
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,243
Take a good look at these!

175
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:31,454
A dog collar... At the office...
In the car... this one is outdoor...

176
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:34,693
Do you see now?

177
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,021
He has so many women,
besides you!

178
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:42,729
He's about quantity. Not quality!

179
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:48,334
He's not a man. He's a dog!

180
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:51,207
A dog!

181
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:53,438
Let's go.

182
00:20:55,717 --> 00:21:00,916
Maybe you're too shocked to
fully understand the situation here.

183
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:02,785
No. It's you who's not
getting the situation.

184
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:07,522
I knew he had other women,

185
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:11,031
but I didn't care. Because I liked him
and that's all it mattered.

186
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:18,562
I'm sorry about this.
Let's go somewhere else.

187
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,402
Are you crazy?

188
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:26,544
What are you doing with
this playboy?

189
00:21:26,614 --> 00:21:29,845
I'd rather be with a playboy who
knows how to love me,

190
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:33,276
than a kid like you who doesn't
even know what love is.

191
00:21:36,324 --> 00:21:37,916
Nice photoshop work.

192
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:40,624
Pervert.

193
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:48,001
Fine! You can call me pervert or

194
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:53,196
whatever you want!
But what about me?

195
00:21:54,242 --> 00:21:58,804
I lived my whole life just for you!

196
00:21:58,913 --> 00:22:02,679
What about me then?

197
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,861
Who are you?

198
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:23,470
Me? An international referee.

199
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,975
Ready?

200
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:44,046
Hello?

201
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:48,288
Teacher, I forgot to tell you
one thing about LEE Seung-no.

202
00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:53,493
He's a master in judo,
aikido and fencing!

203
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,250
Tae-il! Are you ok?

204
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:28,633
Teacher... he's pretty damn strong!

205
00:23:28,703 --> 00:23:32,799
Tae-il! Tae-il!

206
00:23:43,851 --> 00:23:53,590
Il-mae, I shouldn't say this
as your dad, but...

207
00:23:55,496 --> 00:24:03,528
I think purity of heart is
more important than that of body.

208
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:10,809
I believe Tae-il loves you for
who you are in your heart.

209
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:20,251
Can't you just give him
one more chance?

210
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:24,682
Dad, give me a kiss!

211
00:24:36,504 --> 00:24:41,305
You crazy?

212
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:50,412
You can't do it, right?
Neither can I. Tae-il is like that.

213
00:24:55,656 --> 00:25:01,151
He's my childhood buddy.
Like a brother.

214
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:04,124
I can't even kiss him.

215
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:10,565
Really?

216
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:14,197
It's too late, dad.

217
00:25:17,578 --> 00:25:23,210
I just want to be his friend.

218
00:25:29,657 --> 00:25:35,618
I'm worried.
He'd never give you up.

219
00:25:36,964 --> 00:25:40,263
There's only one solution.

220
00:25:42,536 --> 00:25:45,733
I should marry Seung-no quickly

221
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:55,315
Tae-il! Are you out of your mind?

222
00:25:55,383 --> 00:25:58,875
Why are you burning your books?

223
00:25:59,553 --> 00:26:03,990
The reason for my existence was
to marry Il-mae.

224
00:26:05,092 --> 00:26:08,323
Not becoming a judge
or a district attorney.

225
00:26:08,396 --> 00:26:09,420
Tae-il! Tae-il!

226
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:11,357
Oh my god!

227
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:19,199
Fire! Fire!

228
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:55,331
JOO Il-mae, come back to me!
I love you forever.

229
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:56,876
Come back to me, JOO Il-mae!
Come back to me, JOO Il-mae!

230
00:26:56,944 --> 00:26:59,435
JOO Il-mae, come back to me!
JOO... Il-mae!!

231
00:27:15,096 --> 00:27:18,088
"Prepare yourself for death, and
you'll live and prepare yourself

232
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:20,925
for life and you'll die!"
said General LEE.

233
00:27:21,535 --> 00:27:25,335
Chinese textbook pg.118, line 4!

234
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:42,417
Love is like a marathon!
I must eat to win!

235
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:57,300
Merciless bastard!
You can't take her away from me!

236
00:27:57,404 --> 00:27:59,702
Maybe today is the D-day.

237
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:06,269
They dined at a fancy restaurant
and danced at a jazz bar, right?

238
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,117
Then, he probably gave her
Neuschwanstein and said,

239
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:16,418
he won't be a fool who
only builds a castle...

240
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:21,419
then a kiss.

241
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,222
They didn't kiss.

242
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,162
That's not the point!

243
00:28:31,305 --> 00:28:36,743
With a little bit of alcohol and
sweet words, he melts her heart

244
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:43,349
Then with a seal of love,
the game is over

245
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:46,352
She becomes his woman.

246
00:28:56,463 --> 00:29:00,559
You really like polar bears that much?

247
00:29:00,634 --> 00:29:02,795
JOO Il-mae!

248
00:29:07,408 --> 00:29:09,740
Tae-il! You're impossible.

249
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:29,262
Please let her go. Please.

250
00:29:29,964 --> 00:29:37,871
You could have anything in the world.

251
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:43,068
But she's all I have.

252
00:29:43,744 --> 00:29:48,204
Please let her go. I beg of you.

253
00:29:51,552 --> 00:29:59,459
Il-mae! I never even got a chance
to show you how much I love you.

254
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:03,826
Just give me one chance!

255
00:30:11,772 --> 00:30:13,330
He looks just like a weasel

256
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:19,170
Tonight is not the first night
we're sleeping together.

257
00:30:20,114 --> 00:30:24,016
We've done it countless times.

258
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,248
So, don't bother me anymore.

259
00:30:28,889 --> 00:30:32,120
You bitch! Bother you?

260
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:36,823
I've been bothering you?
How about me?

261
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:41,694
You think I enjoyed packing
your lunch for 4 years?

262
00:30:42,436 --> 00:30:44,802
And reserving your seat at the library?

263
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:52,011
Do you think doing your
laundry was fun?

264
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:56,078
Really?

265
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:11,898
It's nice to know
how you really felt.

266
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,095
Can I go now?

267
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:25,541
Get out of my sight!
You make me want to puke!

268
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:29,077
No, I'll go.

269
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:36,612
I'm so shamed I wasted my life
chasing after a slut like you!

270
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:42,411
What? I ask you to go to Seoul

271
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:44,957
to look after Tae-il and
investigate Il-mae's affairs.

272
00:32:45,025 --> 00:32:48,620
And, now you
return and cry like a girl.

273
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:54,893
Il-mae went to the hospital.

274
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:57,266
So, I thought she's gonna see
a gynecologist.

275
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,571
Hospital?

276
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:20,456
She has the myelodysplastic
syndromes,

277
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:26,030
the same illness that
took away your wife.

278
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:27,794
Oh, lord.

279
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:12,508
Teacher, you're so light.
You got no meat on your legs.

280
00:34:13,914 --> 00:34:15,779
You've gotten so thin.

281
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:22,983
You need to eat more.

282
00:34:25,158 --> 00:34:31,188
I'm not light.
You've become stronger.

283
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:33,365
Tae-il.

284
00:34:34,535 --> 00:34:36,230
Yes, teacher.

285
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:40,873
Are you really ok?

286
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:46,645
Of course. I'm fine.

287
00:34:48,015 --> 00:34:52,179
It's not a big deal to me

288
00:34:54,421 --> 00:34:59,586
The funny thing is, the date for the
2nd exam is the same date

289
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:05,465
as Il-mae's wedding date.

290
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:12,603
Good. There is no reason why
you should attend her wedding.

291
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:22,277
Go on and do well on your exam
and pass it with flying colors.

292
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,546
Don't worry about me.

293
00:35:28,021 --> 00:35:36,827
I'll pass the exam... get married...
have kids...

294
00:35:38,665 --> 00:35:42,658
then I will come back to see you.

295
00:35:44,404 --> 00:35:56,805
I'll never forget...
all you've done for me.

296
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:00,847
Alright.

297
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:39,954
Who is it? Dad?

298
00:36:48,435 --> 00:36:50,335
Dad, Dad!

299
00:36:50,404 --> 00:36:53,498
Tae-il... Tae-il...

300
00:37:10,257 --> 00:37:14,591
Tae-il! SOHN Tae-il!

301
00:37:26,606 --> 00:37:28,471
JOO Il-mae!

302
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:31,001
Yes?

303
00:37:31,578 --> 00:37:33,341
Eat well and live well!

304
00:37:35,082 --> 00:37:36,344
Eat well and...

305
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:41,550
don't get sick, ok?

306
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:52,223
If you do get sick,
don't get too sick. Ok?

307
00:37:55,135 --> 00:38:03,338
You too! Don't get into
any more troubles!

308
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:08,643
And don't be so stubborn, ok?

309
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:17,250
Stop worrying about me.

310
00:38:17,324 --> 00:38:20,487
I'll be fine.

311
00:38:25,065 --> 00:38:27,898
Goodbye.

312
00:38:45,385 --> 00:38:52,314
Tae-il! Do you know why
I'm marrying him?

313
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,920
Because he has other women.

314
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:05,195
He'll easily fall in love again.

315
00:39:09,643 --> 00:39:12,009
Even without me,

316
00:39:12,078 --> 00:39:16,811
he'll continue to live
a happy life!

317
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:25,648
But, you can't do that.

318
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:29,292
You'll only think of me
and love me!

319
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:38,202
Just like my dad!

320
00:39:39,706 --> 00:39:46,077
I can't let you become
like my dad.

321
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:58,949
Dad, I'm not a bad person,
am I?

322
00:40:01,328 --> 00:40:04,695
Of course not.

323
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:18,410
Like a flower... like a star...
you're the loveliest girl in the world...

324
00:40:28,054 --> 00:40:33,651
Dad, let's practice the wedding march.

325
00:40:35,629 --> 00:40:43,263
We have to be careful
not to step on my dress.

326
00:40:46,306 --> 00:40:50,174
Alright, alright.

327
00:42:04,684 --> 00:42:12,113
Il-mae!!!

328
00:43:17,424 --> 00:43:21,360
- Tilt your head a bit to the left.
- Turn it just a little.

329
00:43:30,437 --> 00:43:33,634
My love, do you know
what I did today?

330
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:42,670
I went to the photo studio with
Il-mae and took pictures.

331
00:43:44,551 --> 00:43:50,114
She braided her hair and
wore this really pretty dress.

332
00:43:52,092 --> 00:43:57,758
And we took a picture together.

333
00:44:01,434 --> 00:44:06,303
She was trying to do what
you and I couldn't do.

334
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:18,883
Do you know what she said to me
as she took her portrait?

335
00:44:21,387 --> 00:44:33,766
She smiled and said,

336
00:44:36,402 --> 00:44:43,672
"Dad, I've a very happy life.

337
00:44:44,277 --> 00:44:51,513
So please don't cry
when you look at this picture."

338
00:44:52,986 --> 00:44:59,653
And she smiled.

339
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:09,691
My lovely child... my sweet child...

340
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:22,312
Teacher, you're killing yourself.
Please don't do this.

341
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,128
The 45th Level 2
bar exam center

342
00:45:44,137 --> 00:45:45,934
Begin.

343
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:23,942
It would be much appreciated
if you'd participated in blood drive.

344
00:46:25,245 --> 00:46:26,803
What the hell are you saying?

345
00:46:26,879 --> 00:46:31,680
Of course it's our duty as his students
to do as much as we can.

346
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:41,358
- What's going on?
- Get off me!! You bastards!

347
00:46:41,427 --> 00:46:43,827
SOHN Tae-il! You bastard!

348
00:46:43,896 --> 00:46:46,421
How can you take a test right now?

349
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:49,798
Tae-il, come out here! You know
what Il-mae did for you?

350
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,896
Get off me! She... Tae-il, she's...

351
00:46:53,973 --> 00:46:59,138
Tae-il doesn't understand why.

352
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,115
He's just trying to forget her
because she told him to.

353
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:10,344
Come on! Step on the accelerator!

354
00:47:11,424 --> 00:47:18,728
He has no clue that she's doing
this for his own sake

355
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:22,866
For the only person she ever loved...

356
00:47:24,203 --> 00:47:28,435
she wants him to be happy
even when she's not here anymore.

357
00:47:30,076 --> 00:47:34,570
My love, what am I supposed to do?

358
00:47:35,181 --> 00:47:39,413
What can I do?

359
00:47:40,386 --> 00:47:47,053
I now pronounce you to be
husband and wife.

360
00:47:51,898 --> 00:47:54,059
Nonsense!

361
00:48:00,373 --> 00:48:05,037
- Nullify this marriage!
- Nullify! Nullify!

362
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:07,944
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

363
00:48:08,014 --> 00:48:15,386
Ladies and gentlemen, this girl
right here, is a horrible person!

364
00:48:16,856 --> 00:48:18,551
This stupid girl...

365
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:24,360
She's suffering from the same illness
which took her mom away...

366
00:48:25,798 --> 00:48:30,167
So I can live happily by myself...

367
00:48:31,204 --> 00:48:38,542
So I can pass the exam and
live happily by myself!

368
00:48:38,845 --> 00:48:44,511
Il-mae, did you really think
I'd be fine?

369
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,455
I already gave you my heart.

370
00:48:51,391 --> 00:48:56,522
How am I supposed to
live without you?

371
00:49:01,534 --> 00:49:05,595
And our teacher...
he's a horrible person, too.

372
00:49:10,743 --> 00:49:12,802
As her father...

373
00:49:12,879 --> 00:49:23,050
this is how he shows his love.

374
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:42,135
Tae-il, why are you doing this to her?

375
00:49:43,743 --> 00:49:48,203
What can she do now?

376
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:51,842
That's exactly why
I cannot allow this marriage.

377
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:58,487
If you'd known your wife's gonna die,
would you've not loved her?

378
00:49:59,258 --> 00:50:02,022
Answer me!

379
00:50:19,011 --> 00:50:20,239
Il-mae!

380
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:29,383
I never regret loving your mother.

381
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:36,987
Your mother was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

382
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:53,205
Even now, everyday of my life is
filled of joy because your mom!

383
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:12,461
Please, forgive her.

384
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:15,358
And please release her.

385
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:23,800
Allow me to be at her side
till her last day.

386
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:29,044
- Please release her.
- Please! Release her!

387
00:51:38,558 --> 00:51:44,497
This marriage is... nullified!

388
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:23,361
Tae-il! I'm sick.
And I'll get sicker.

389
00:52:25,504 --> 00:52:36,210
I'm afraid I won't be able to
be with you much longer

390
00:52:38,618 --> 00:52:44,853
You can't die. I won't let you.

391
00:52:48,794 --> 00:52:52,787
Forget the law school! I'll study
and go to a medical school

392
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:57,063
I'm gonna find out a cure
for your illness

393
00:53:18,324 --> 00:53:20,417
I pretended I was asleep

394
00:53:20,493 --> 00:53:24,452
and he's already snoring. Little fool...

395
00:53:26,866 --> 00:53:32,532
Our first kiss was a long awaited one...

396
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:41,136
Thinking about our first kiss
still makes my heart flutter...

397
00:53:50,056 --> 00:53:52,081
I love you, Tae-il!

398
00:53:55,361 --> 00:54:05,965
Teacher, I can't say that!

399
00:54:10,443 --> 00:54:11,876
Tae-il.

400
00:54:22,388 --> 00:54:31,023
I can't... I can't do that here.

401
00:54:51,317 --> 00:54:56,880
Let go of her, will you?
Let go of her.

402
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:04,896
Never! I'll never let her go!

403
00:55:05,965 --> 00:55:14,134
I'm gonna cure her illness and
we're gonna live happily together

404
00:55:15,007 --> 00:55:19,842
till our deaths do us apart
teeth fall out.
