4
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:12,698
There once lived a mean
cuckoo guy named Young-Dal.

5
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:21,941
His wife died giving birth to
their daughter Il-mae.

6
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:27,282
Since then, it was my mother who
breast fed her and raised her.

7
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:44,361
From our birth on,
she was my destined partner
who stole half of my milk.

8
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:58,711
That's how
my first love began.

9
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:05,248
Crazy First Love

10
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,192
Teacher, can we stay closer?

11
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,759
You punks! Keep your distance!

12
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:57,866
You all are a bunch of animals
with too much testosterone.

13
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,435
Tes... what? What's that?

14
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:07,817
Joo, Young-dal must keep
his words with Sohn Tae-il!

15
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:15,617
My dear ladies!

16
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,892
You all know me, right?

17
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:24,103
Sophomore at Kang High School
Class 7, number 58

18
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,104
SOHN Tae-il!!

19
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:32,177
Promises are supposed to be kept.

20
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:39,383
Especially, words from a teacher
who is a role model!

21
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:45,848
How can he break his promise?

22
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,326
At this moment,

23
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:58,728
In the presence of Buddha, Jesus
and all other Gods in the world,

24
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:06,371
I accuse Mr. JOO Young-dal,

25
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:14,684
a teacher at Kang High,
of breaking his solemn promise!

26
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,382
10 years ago,

27
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,026
our teacher Mr. JOO promised me,

28
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:28,730
"Just wait till you have some
hairs on your balls!

29
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:35,399
When that happens, you can marry
my daughter Il-mae!"

30
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:45,642
Il-mae! My pubic hair started
growing when I was thirteen!

31
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:52,825
So, I ran to your dad
right away.

32
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,555
"Look! I have the pubic hair

33
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,066
Now, hand over Il-mae
like you promised!"

34
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,592
But, what did you say? Teacher?

35
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:10,970
"That's not it!

36
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:17,408
It's just hair attached to your body.
You wanna see my real ones?"

37
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:27,689
Fine. Let's just say it was just hair.

38
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:36,133
But now, tell me what
covers me down there.

39
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:42,402
You wanna call them a bunch
of black threads?

40
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:50,139
Teacher, do you wanna
check it out?

41
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,411
Show us! Show us!

42
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:16,536
Il-mae! Look!

43
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,577
Do they look like threads to you?

44
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:50,303
Testosterone is a type of
male hormone...

45
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,782
that can turn a normal kid like Tae-il

46
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,786
into a wild animal in a snap!

47
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,651
- Ready?
- Ready.

48
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,821
Let's go!

49
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,359
What the...?

50
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:43,754
- Boss!
- Kneel down!

51
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:51,536
Was it you that broke into
my territory and beat up

52
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,333
my boys in open daylight?
and beat up my boys?

53
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,637
What do you want?

54
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,838
I'm a righteous warrior!

55
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:03,773
You little shit.

56
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,387
You're from Kang High?

57
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:23,529
So am I. Is that why you're here?

58
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:29,265
Cut the bullshit.
Are you gonna take me in or not?

59
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,152
Are you gonna take me in or not?

60
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,519
How's Mr. JOO?

61
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,928
Why the hell did you bring up
his name?

62
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,338
Stay still!

63
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:20,757
Teacher, what's happening to
our school?

64
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:27,698
I'm a gangster now, but
I graduated high school though.

65
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:33,171
Teach them a lesson!
Especially that curly hair!

66
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,672
48th year class
Byun, Kang-chul!

67
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,975
Yes, sir.

68
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,569
Get down!

69
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,646
What?

70
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:49,052
Because of little shits like you
these kids wanna be gangsters.

71
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,653
Listen! Urgent news!

72
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,822
- Tae-il from Kang High...
- What about him?

73
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:03,232
He went to the boss of the market
area and asked him to take him in.

74
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:08,262
- For real?
- But the boss told Il-mae's
dad on him

75
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,300
and now he's getting
his ass whipped.

76
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,345
Pants down!

77
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,554
On your stomach!

78
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:43,573
Do you guys hear my heart?

79
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,704
It's crying out in pain.

80
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:52,574
Ouch! Ouch!

81
00:10:53,586 --> 00:11:00,253
If my heart hurts this much, then
how would your parents feel?

82
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,387
Right, Tae-il?

83
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:10,258
You haven't changed a bit, sir.
I'm so happy to see you again.

84
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:16,302
Your mother works so hard
selling fish at the marketplace to...

85
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,368
Feed me and to send me to school.
So what?

86
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,614
You little brat!

87
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,148
Are you giving me dirty look
during my admonition?

88
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,283
You wanna lose your eyes?

89
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,363
Sir, I apologize.

90
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:53,877
Even an animal like a crow
appreciates the love of its parents.

91
00:11:53,946 --> 00:12:01,443
Then what bird are you, teacher?
You didn't keep your words.

92
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,685
What did you say?

93
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:22,366
You think I sold fish at the market
to make you a gang?

94
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,371
Il-mae! What did you eat to grow?

95
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,207
Milk.

96
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,275
What kind of milk? Cow milk?

97
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,019
No. Your breast milk.

98
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:44,854
After all I've done for you,
how could you seduce my son?

99
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,527
Ma'am, you got it wrong.
Il-mae didn't do anything.

100
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:55,540
She ruined my boy's life...

101
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,848
Go inside.

102
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:10,615
Teacher, why don't you just expel him
from school?

103
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:19,320
He's only causing more trouble
staying in school...

104
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:43,549
Look at me.
You can't even look at me.

105
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,852
Pretty embarrassing, huh?

106
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,430
Face is busted by a gang and
ass is whipped by my dad,

107
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,056
and your back is beaten
by your mother.

108
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,928
Let me see your back!

109
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,959
Why do you live like this?

110
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:29,865
I'm gonna show him...

111
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,369
how his unkept promise
brings me down.

112
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,432
You're crazy!

113
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,303
What am I supposed to do?

114
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:41,040
You rank in top 3,000 nationwide
but I'm not even in top 300,000.

115
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,244
And everyday, you get prettier
and I get uglier.

116
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,543
You're slipping away from me
and... Shit!

117
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,916
There's nothing I can do

118
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,225
What am I supposed to do with you?

119
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,160
Shut up! Stop whining!

120
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,140
...even when you're angry,
you look beautiful.

121
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,777
What?

122
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:20,144
When I think of your pretty face,
I can't control myself!

123
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,812
I can't sleep nor eat!

124
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:32,395
When I open a book,
the words turn into your face!

125
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:39,630
You're so goddamn pretty and my
body is boiling with hot blood.

126
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,501
What am I supposed to do?

127
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,017
I've never seen a student
as unruly as Sohn Tae-il.

128
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:05,464
And what's worse is that
our naive students worship him,

129
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:14,270
and it'll keep creating someone
just like him.

130
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:23,111
it's time to pull out our swords
and eliminate the bad wolf!

131
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,241
We agree with you, Mr. Principal.

132
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:32,653
Let's hear from his homeroom teacher.

133
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:41,388
Every teenager has a bit of wolf
within himself.

134
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:49,568
To achieve peace in our school,
we should take this chance

135
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:58,482
to emasculate them all!
Even the sheepish kids!

136
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,383
Testosterone!!

137
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,252
Teacher, you'll pick a husband
for Il-mae through open contest?

138
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,420
For real? Awesome!

139
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,485
Shit!

140
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,162
Teacher! Isn't she Tae-il's girl?

141
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:26,436
Since he entered high school,
suspended from school 3 times!

142
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:32,439
Disciplinary confinement 7 times!
Lewdness in public

143
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:39,886
Intoxication, unlawful entry
and attempted kidnapping

144
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,051
Plus, he's in the bottom
with an IQ of 148 and

145
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,057
preoccupied with joining a gangster.

146
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:53,400
If you were in my shoes, would
you give your daughter to him?

147
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,030
No way!

148
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:59,407
Teacher!
What are the requirements?

149
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,016
Requirements? It can be anyone

150
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:10,551
Just improve your scores
up to my daughter's.

151
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,919
The day you bring me
your report card,

152
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,590
you will marry my daughter.
Understood?

153
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,598
Yes, sir!

154
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,106
Yes? You got a question?

155
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:42,978
As a man to man! One on one!

156
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,757
Are you challenging me?

157
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,888
Why? You scared?

158
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,977
Where are you going?
You challenged me!

159
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,407
Here I come!

160
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,833
You little punk!

161
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,144
You're nothing!

162
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,417
You can't even swing one punch.

163
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:55,352
How dare you want my daughter?

164
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,560
- Teacher!
- I'm here.

165
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,272
- Teacher!
- That's water.

166
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:23,619
I'd rather die with you
than lose her to someone.

167
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,080
You are unbelievable

168
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,587
You said you're gonna be a fisherman,
but can't even swim!

169
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,159
You're hopeless!

170
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,891
Teacher, what do I have to do?

171
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:15,567
Please tell me what I have to do.

172
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:20,402
to beat 300,000 kids in 2 years.

173
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:25,246
Please tell me!

174
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,083
Give it up!

175
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:37,622
I'll die if you ask me to die
Please tell me!

176
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,392
It won't happen to someone like you

177
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,964
Teacher, please tell me!

178
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,569
I said, it won't.

179
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,976
It's impossible! Impossible!

180
00:21:56,048 --> 00:22:02,544
Ouch! What are you hitting me?
It stings!

181
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,488
Sleep only 3 hours a day.

182
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:16,933
Then, in 3 days, you will nosebleed.

183
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,336
If you nosebleed everyday
till you graduate,

184
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,537
Then my girl will be yours.
I guarantee!

185
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:33,177
Teacher, I'll nosebleed everyday.

186
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,649
Il-mae is mine.

187
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:44,123
You can't give her
to anybody else. Ok? Dad?

188
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,826
I got it.

189
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:54,099
Gees... You're so heavy.

190
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,094
You see the spot I'm on

191
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,490
Marked with white paint?

192
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,296
Yes, teacher!

193
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,269
This is the spot,

194
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,004
where you freshmen's proud 6 year
senior SOHN Tae-il fell down

195
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:42,215
bleeding from both nostrils with
college exam scores in his hand.

196
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:59,999
That's when I found out
a man can survive

197
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,768
way too much nosebleeding.

198
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:13,617
You all know the proud tradition
of our Kang High, right?

199
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:14,947
Yes, sir!

200
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,412
Say it!

201
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:21,926
One! We don't have
guidance department!

202
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:22,957
And?

203
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:27,158
One! We're the worst enemy
of the Red Cross!

204
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,166
That's how it happened!

205
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:36,840
When Tae-il made top 3,000,

206
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,401
and got early accepted to Seoul
National University,

207
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:47,578
our principal said to the
Department of Education,

208
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:53,955
"Our students study so hard and
nosebleed everyday,

209
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:58,453
they don't have any blood to
donate!

210
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:10,101
From now on, Kang High is the
worst enemy of the Red Cross!"

211
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:21,646
Goddamn persistent kid!
Worse than a leech!

212
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,086
Father in-law!

213
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:36,834
Let's set the wedding date...
dad?

214
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:49,338
First, go to college.

215
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:58,213
Welcome! Welcome!
This is Seoul National University!

216
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,985
My school!

217
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,227
I got into the law school,
like you told me to.

218
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,771
So, let me marry her now!

219
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:21,875
Il-mae's college expels students
who get married before graduating.

220
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,513
You're joking, right?

221
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:32,050
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

222
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:37,186
Now I'm in a law school, he's gonna
ask me to pass the bar exam,

223
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,889
Then finish the judicial trainings
And after that,

224
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,864
who knows what excuse
he's gonna come up with.

225
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,463
SOHN Tae-il!! Stop right there!

226
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,970
Where are we going?

227
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:57,780
Let's do it! Let's make a baby!

228
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,784
Are you crazy?

229
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,215
What?

230
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:11,290
I can't betray my dad like that!

231
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,389
What about me, then?

232
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,941
Math workbook pg.216, #14-8!

233
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:30,414
What are all critical points,
if there are any, of a function

234
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:37,320
where k (t) equals to one divide by
the square root of "t" minus

235
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,550
squared positive one?

236
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,852
Answer!

237
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,486
its critical point is
(0, 1).

238
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:52,263
Buddha, the God of Mercy...

239
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,518
Name, SOHN Tae-il!

240
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,429
Il-mae!

241
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,101
Il-mae!

242
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,745
Is he ok?

243
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:43,917
Exactly then, you know
what your father said to me?

244
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:48,448
"C'mon, Tae-il!
Just a bit more!"

245
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:53,020
What am I? His slave?

246
00:28:53,965 --> 00:29:00,165
If I keep listening to your dad,
then I'm gonna die as a virgin!

247
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,604
Let's go in! What the...!

248
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:09,579
You kidnap my daughter
in open daylight?

249
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,276
You crazy punk!

250
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,377
We're gonna have a baby first.

251
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,945
Have what?

252
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:22,925
Dad! Tae-il!

253
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:43,178
Stop right there! You little shit.

254
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:49,643
You think you can run away?

255
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,463
Kneel down!

256
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,335
Release him.

257
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:28,783
We have laws in this country!
You think you can get away with

258
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,827
abduction and physical assault?

259
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,859
I've lived well without any laws.

260
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:43,131
You piece of shit didn't pass
the bar exam yet, so what the hell
do you know about the law?

261
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,876
This is your mother in law.
Give her a bow.

262
00:30:53,751 --> 00:31:07,597
Mom! Look how bad he's treating
one and only son in law.

263
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:15,833
If she were alive,
she'd be in her early 40's

264
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:23,038
But I only remember her as
a high school girl who likes fast food.

265
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,414
You mean...

266
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:31,712
That's right.

267
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:37,754
We both were in high school
when she got pregnant.

268
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,933
I don't like you! No, I fear you!

269
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:52,809
You're just like how I used to be.

270
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:59,448
You don't know anything about her.
About her pain and suffering...

271
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:04,611
What you see is all you know.
Is that real love?

272
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,023
Bull shit!

273
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:12,929
You're just pleasing yourself.

274
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,762
Look at me!

275
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:22,972
I loved Il-mae's mom to death...

276
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,305
but she was gone at 18!

277
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:38,753
If you really love her, then you
have to know how to protect her!

278
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,661
Tae-il!

279
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,993
Yes, sir!

280
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:55,033
Il-mae isn't going anywhere.

281
00:32:56,107 --> 00:33:01,067
I swear I'll keep her safe.

282
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:08,381
So, can she stay with me just
a little longer?

283
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:15,686
Can you please leave her with me
just a little longer?

284
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,363
Teacher...

285
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:27,862
I'll protect her!

286
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,068
Up until I graduate and
pass the bar exam,

287
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,904
I won't even touch her hair!

288
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,747
Thanks.

289
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:48,391
Kiss... I'll allow kissing.

290
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:53,021
Nonsense! If I kiss her, then
I'd wanna touch her boobs.

291
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:59,301
And if I touch her boobs, then I'll cross
the line that I must not cross.

292
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:10,872
Until the day you give Il-mae's hand
to me, I'll keep her intact, and virgin!

293
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,472
Tae-il!

294
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,895
What a lie!

295
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,199
She is a slut.

296
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:44,213
She slept with me a lot
when she's in high school.

297
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,877
She wasn't even a virgin
when we first had sex.

298
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,944
She already had abortions,
even five times!

299
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:56,786
And her tube got so damaged
that she can't even have a baby.

300
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,125
How do you know her so well?

301
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:04,100
How? She's my first love
and so am I to her.

302
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,370
Out my window, I can see
Il-mae's room well.

303
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,535
That's my room.

304
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,080
Well done, Tae-il.

305
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:23,444
I protect my girl, sir!

306
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,624
Il-mae, I had a really good time tonight.

307
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,898
I'm sorry about...

308
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,909
That's ok. Your friend Tae-il
always adds thrill to our date.

309
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,218
I don't see him.

310
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:27,114
Tae-il! You!!

311
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,314
Shit!

312
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:46,527
I'm gonna get wrinkled and die
as a virgin without kissing a man

313
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,006
Why don't you go for Tae-il?

314
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,908
Tae-il?

315
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,702
Do you really love me?

316
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:28,471
If you really love me,
if you can hear my heart,

317
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,915
then please look at me.

318
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,121
Stop that gibberish.

319
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,498
You really gonna be like this?

320
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:07,342
You're an animal with
too much testosterone!

321
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,985
Patience!

322
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:21,458
Other boys? I hooked up
Yonsei University boys

323
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,160
with girls from Sookmyung University.

324
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:28,638
Only Ewha girls here!

325
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:37,309
I'm the only one who stands up to pee.

326
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,212
So no need to worry, sir!

327
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,252
How do you manage to
prepare for the bar exam?

328
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,845
I brought everything with me.

329
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:53,256
I'm confident in memorizing
with my IQ, I gotta go, bye!

330
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:59,496
How do you say "Eat it while
it's warm" in local dialect?

331
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:07,405
Slurp it while it's hot.
Slurp it while it's hot.

332
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:16,753
Let's see, where is Il-mae's
cold medicine?

333
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:25,428
It's her shampoo, snacks.

334
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:29,432
Where is it? Oh, here it is.

335
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:36,166
Hello! It's time for my girl
to take her medicine!

336
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,274
Il-mae!

337
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,778
She went swimming with a boy
she met in the lobby.

338
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,113
I can't even leave her alone
for 2 seconds!

339
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,991
Don't you think it's way
too much sexy?

340
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,697
Not at all. I have to knock him.

341
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,033
out with one punch!

342
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:22,684
Il-mae! JOO Il-mae!

343
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:38,426
SOHN Tae-il! Let's see
who's gonna win this time!

344
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,171
Where is that bastard?

345
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:07,295
What... what are you doing?

346
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,458
Thanks, Tae-il.

347
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,198
For... for what?

348
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:19,675
For looking after me till now.
You don't have to do it anymore.

349
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,989
This is our last trip of
our college years.

350
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:43,227
I want to make a memorable moment

351
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:47,600
with you! Right now!

352
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,638
Here?

353
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,381
Tae-il.

354
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:09,091
Teacher, please forgive me!

355
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:22,870
Wake up!

356
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:27,142
Too much testosterone!

357
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,648
Cover up yourself well
before you come out.

358
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,312
Stop right there!

359
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,317
I can't move anyway.

360
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:48,295
Tae-il, if you walk out on me now
then it's over.

361
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,429
You might never see me again!

362
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,763
Do you hear me?

363
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:02,208
Calm down and come out!
After giving you your medication,

364
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,443
I've got a lot to study tonight!

365
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:13,446
You fool! What's so important
about that stupid promise?

366
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:25,994
I need you... right now...

367
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:33,975
There might not be next time...
Stupid...

368
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,062
- Are you telling the truth?
- Yes, sir!

369
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:07,140
You finally did it!

370
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:16,147
Everyone! Tae-il passed
the level 1 bar exam.

371
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,255
Sir, Il-mae is really mine, right?

372
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:29,425
Of course! She's all yours!

373
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,965
Where are you?
Are you with her?

374
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:39,272
My whereabouts is a top secret.

375
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:45,107
I'm preparing a present for her.

376
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,084
Ouch... Be careful, will you?

377
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:58,390
Alright. We're giving you a cool
finishing stitches.
