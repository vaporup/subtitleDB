1
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:24,804
When I think of my wife...

2
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:29,694
...I always think of her head.

3
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:34,056
I picture cracking her lovely skull...

4
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:36,357
Unspooling her brains...

5
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:39,031
Trying to get answers.

6
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,739
The primal questions of any marriage.

7
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:46,124
"What are you thinking?"

8
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:48,411
"How are you feeling?"

9
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:51,085
"What have we done to each other?"

10
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:30,063
The Irish prince
graces us with his presence.

11
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:34,855
His majesty prefers not to be moistened.

12
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:37,353
I got you a present.

13
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,401
- I hated this game.
- You loved it.

14
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:41,732
You loved it.

15
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:44,067
Thank you.
I'll add it to the collection.

16
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:47,033
Can you pour me a bourbon?

17
00:02:53,288 --> 00:02:55,368
What's up, jitters?

18
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:01,426
Well, if you're not going to talk,
I'm gonna have to fill the silence...

19
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:04,843
With another excruciating story
by margo dunne.

20
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:07,553
I could tell you about
my recent customer service experience...

21
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:09,604
- Changing Internet service providers.
- I like that one.

22
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:12,508
Or how about the time I saw that woman
who looked exactly like my friend Monica?

23
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,478
But it wasn't Monica.
It was a total stranger.

24
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:16,438
Who was also named Monica.

25
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,615
- Made it kind of interesting.
- It's great.

26
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:20,561
I'm just having a bad day.

27
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,567
- Amy?
- It's our anniversary.

28
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,569
- Five years.
- Five?

29
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,781
That came fast.

30
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:27,151
And furious.

31
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:34,792
I'm so crazy, stupid happy.

32
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,084
I met a boy.

33
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:43,556
A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy.

34
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,089
Excuse me, miss?

35
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:48,594
I just want you to be careful...

36
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,435
Where you put down that
monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...

37
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:54,181
Because the party's down to three
beast lights and a bottle of pucker.

38
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:55,934
It might attract
some desperate characters.

39
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:58,816
It could.
I mean, the amish are on a rumspringa.

40
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,440
They already relieved me
of my artisanal meat platter.

41
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:08,365
Finally, someone tells me
how to pronounce that word.

42
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:09,405
"Meat"?

43
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:10,656
Yes, "meat." One syllable.

44
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:13,661
Thank you. Whose beer am I
about to drink?

45
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:14,992
Don't tell me.

46
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:17,332
Let's see, who's your type?

47
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:18,828
I don't see you sitting quietly...

48
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:22,464
While he bloviates
on his postgrad thesis about proust.

49
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:24,803
Uh-oh. Is that him?

50
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:27,119
Ironic hipster, so self-aware,
he makes everything a joke.

51
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:30,341
I prefer men who are funny, not "funny."

52
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:33,509
What type are you?

53
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:35,015
Corn-fed,
salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy.

54
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:36,177
Missouri?

55
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:37,145
Cute.

56
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:39,524
- Native new yorker?
- The world ends at the Hudson.

57
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:40,641
What's your name?

58
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:41,687
Amy.

59
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:44,018
Well, Amy, who are you?

60
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:48,529
A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander.

61
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,740
B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.

62
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:55,913
C, I write personality quizzes
for magazines.

63
00:04:56,286 --> 00:05:00,496
Okay. Your hands are far too delicate
for real scrimshaw work...

64
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,791
And I happen to be a charter subscriber
to middling warlord weekly...

65
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,046
So I'd recognize you.

66
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:06,709
I'm gonna go with "c."

67
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,175
And you?

68
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,547
Who are you?

69
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:14,932
I'm the guy to save you
from all this awesomeness.

70
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:21,847
So, you write for a men's magazine.

71
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:25,155
God, does that make you an expert
on being a man?

72
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,270
No.

73
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,387
It's what to wear, what to drink.

74
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:30,362
How to bullshit.

75
00:05:30,404 --> 00:05:31,994
Never with you.

76
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,860
Ha, ha.

77
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:34,526
No, I mean it.

78
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:36,375
It's hard to believe you.

79
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,200
Why?

80
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:38,874
I think it's your chin.

81
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:40,042
My chin?

82
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,750
Yeah, it's quite villainous.

83
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,421
Okay, how's this?

84
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,589
A hundred percent true, no bullshit.

85
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:49,964
Okay.

86
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:51,555
We all move to New York...

87
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:55,722
And we end up living in these little
cubby holes, and that's not it.

88
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:59,222
Come outside. Then, you're in it.

89
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:03,393
You have to see this.

90
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,035
Hey.

91
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,071
Hey.

92
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,790
I have to kiss you now.

93
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,253
Is that right?

94
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:29,463
I can't let you go through
a sugar storm unkissed.

95
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:32,458
Wait a second.

96
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:36,637
There you go.

97
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:49,985
Nick dunne...

98
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:53,825
I really like you.

99
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:02,243
So, is Amy gonna do
one of those anniversary...

100
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:04,505
Treasure hunts?

101
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,540
You mean the forced march
designed to prove...

102
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,543
What an oblivious and uncaring asshole
her husband is?

103
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:10,666
Wow.

104
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:15,217
Life. I don't remember the point.

105
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:17,469
Deep hasbro thoughts.

106
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,841
Spin.

107
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,890
What was the clue last year
she got so mad about?

108
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:25,232
"When your poor Amy has a cold...

109
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:26,979
"This dessert just must be sold."

110
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,020
The answer?

111
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:29,811
I still don't know the answer, go.

112
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:32,017
- A few years ago, you'd have known.
- A few years ago, it was fun.

113
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,727
Year one,
the traditional gift was paper.

114
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:37,237
She got me a beautiful notebook.
Told me to go write my novel.

115
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:38,161
What did you get her?

116
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:39,568
A kite.

117
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:41,446
- She'd never flown a kite.
- Okay.

118
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:45,001
Anyway. Year four, flowers.

119
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,288
She led me outside
to the dying rosebush in the backyard.

120
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,675
That's symbolic.

121
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,710
Yeah.

122
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,171
What's the gift for five?

123
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:53,002
Wood.

124
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:55,506
- So, what did you get her?
- There's no good gift for wood.

125
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:58,879
I know! Go home, fuck her brains out,
slap her with your penis.

126
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,387
"There's some wood for you, bitch."

127
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,222
The bar.

128
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:08,396
Why, yes. Hang on one second.

129
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:09,597
Hey, it's watchful Wally.

130
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,899
Hey, Walt. What's going on?

131
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:19,358
Thanks very much. I'll be right there.
All right, bye-bye.

132
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:34,255
Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?

133
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:36,964
Thanks, Walt!

134
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:54,018
Ame?

135
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:15,838
Amy!

136
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:29,517
Hello?

137
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:31,145
Come on in.

138
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:32,695
Hey.

139
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,149
- Mister dunne.
- Hi.

140
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:36,689
I'm detective Rhonda boney.
This is officer James gilpin.

141
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,693
We understand there are concerns
about your wife.

142
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:42,655
I don't know where my wife is.
And I came home to this.

143
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:46,489
Now, I don't panic easily...

144
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:48,907
But it's weird, right?

145
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:51,164
Mind if we look around?

146
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:52,335
Please.

147
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,654
How long have you two been here?

148
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:56,497
Two years in September.
We used to live in New York.

149
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:57,635
City?

150
00:09:57,671 --> 00:10:00,801
Yeah, I was a writer.
We were both writers.

151
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:02,471
Why did you all move back here?

152
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,129
My mom got sick.

153
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:07,138
Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?

154
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:08,641
She's dead.

155
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:09,682
I'm so sorry.

156
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:17,687
What do you do now, for work?

157
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,397
My sister margo and I
own the bar downtown.

158
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:22,701
Oh, the bar.

159
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:24,988
Love the name. Very meta.

160
00:10:25,032 --> 00:10:26,122
Thanks.

161
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:30,867
Pretty things.

162
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:36,966
Stay.

163
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,752
My office, here.

164
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:43,838
Beautiful dress.

165
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:48,636
Date night?

166
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,930
It's our anniversary.

167
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:54,601
It's a guest bedroom, there.

168
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:56,525
Cat's room on the end.

169
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:58,113
I checked up here.

170
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:03,576
This is the kitchen...

171
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:04,952
Obviously.

172
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:22,552
This is my wife's office.

173
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,209
Amy's office.

174
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:40,311
Wow. Impressive gal.

175
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:41,567
Yeah. Should I be concerned?

176
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:42,778
I remember these.

177
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:45,277
I loved these books.

178
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:50,869
Wait a minute.

179
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,909
Your wife is amazing Amy?

180
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:55,835
Yeah. She is.

181
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:57,503
Wow.

182
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:04,132
Amazing-fucking-Amy
is getting fucking married.

183
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:05,963
That's how the night started.

184
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:12,098
With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,
jealous, as always, of the golden child.

185
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,729
Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy,
who's getting fucking married.

186
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,850
When I was 10, I quit cello.

187
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:22,486
In the next book,
amazing Amy became a prodigy.

188
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:25,943
Did you play volleyball?

189
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:27,866
I got cut, freshman year.

190
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:29,825
She made varsity.

191
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:33,241
When did you have a dog?

192
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,285
She got the dog.

193
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:37,412
Puddles made her more relatable.

194
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,796
Wow.

195
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:40,962
I love your parents...

196
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:42,791
But they really can be assholes.

197
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:44,286
- Nick!
- Sir!

198
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:46,128
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

199
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:46,963
No problem.

200
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:48,417
Hey, sweetheart.

201
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,429
Big night for your mom.

202
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:54,299
It would mean so much
if you would talk to a few reporters...

203
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:56,218
Bloggers, give them a little Amy color.

204
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:58,136
People wanna hear from you.

205
00:12:58,185 --> 00:12:59,815
- We can't stay long.
- Fantastic.

206
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:02,023
Fifteen minutes, tops.

207
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:06,656
This is why I have my brownstone.
My trust fund. I know I can't complain.

208
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:09,323
Your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood.

209
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:13,413
No, they improved upon it,
and then peddled it to the masses.

210
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,660
I thought you were gonna wear white
to match the wedding theme.

211
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:17,162
I thought that would be creepy.

212
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:19,664
"If it's worth doing,
it's worth doing..."

213
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:22,036
hold up! I know how this ends.
Don't tell me.

214
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:23,884
You're very cute, Nick.

215
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,559
Amy, you know
what would make dad's night.

216
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:27,207
I'm on it.

217
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,507
I love having strangers
pick at my scabs.

218
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:32,802
I'm curious whether...

219
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,555
It's difficult for you to see
amazing Amy heading down the aisle.

220
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,020
And this big party
celebrating this fictional wedding.

221
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:40,388
Because it's my understanding
you are not married.

222
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:42,105
Is that correct?

223
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:46,823
Correct. Amazing Amy has always been
one step ahead of me.

224
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,689
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I just have a few questions.

225
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:51,991
It's you.

226
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,570
I'm here in a
strictly journalistic capacity.

227
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,197
Now, you had the distinct pleasure
of dating Nick dunne for how long?

228
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:01,045
- Two magical years.
- Two magical years.

229
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,921
In the course of that time,
you've had the opportunity...

230
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,418
To perform such gracious gestures as...

231
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,380
Not correcting Nick when he
pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."

232
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:10,883
An understandable mistake.

233
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:12,124
He also thought it was a fish.

234
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,724
He thinks velveeta is a cheese.

235
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:17,051
You also manage to appear
shocked and delighted...

236
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:19,677
When Nick's elderly mother
breaks into an impromptu rendition...

237
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,935
Of New York, New York,
every time she sees you.

238
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,017
[S]These bag of bone shoes

239
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:25,232
that's just frightening.

240
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:27,902
You also bought Nick
his very first pair of scissors.

241
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:29,611
And matching stapler.

242
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,571
Amy elliott, you are more than amazing.

243
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:36,123
You are brilliant,
yet entirely un-snobby.

244
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:39,788
You challenge me. You surprise me.

245
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,158
And, fun fact for the readers...

246
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,290
You have a world-class vagina.

247
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:48,424
My colleagues tell me
that you are not yet married.

248
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,752
Is that correct?

249
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:52,257
I'm not.

250
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,629
Isn't it time we fixed that?

251
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,763
And then...

252
00:14:56,803 --> 00:14:59,643
The night wasn't so bad anymore.

253
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:18,489
And it's done. Crossed off the list.

254
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:22,494
Now, normally, we would not treat this
as a missing persons case so quick...

255
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:23,978
But given the scene at your house...

256
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:26,117
And given our spike
in violent crime of late...

257
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,626
We are gonna take this
very, very seriously.

258
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:29,669
Okay. Good.

259
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,960
We've got forensics over at your place.
You got somewhere to stay?

260
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:34,586
- I could stay at my sister's.
- Okay.

261
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,933
We're tracking Amy's phone,
her credit cards.

262
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,639
We will organize searches,
put up flyers.

263
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,679
- We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.
- You're having a press conference?

264
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,313
I wanna get the word out, right?

265
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,640
Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,
I feel like I'm on a law & order episode.

266
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:57,866
Time is of the essence in these cases.

267
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:00,656
But, that said,
do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?

268
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:01,831
Absolutely not. I just wanna help.

269
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,659
So, you and Amy
have been here two years.

270
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:06,964
- You tend bar...
- I own the bar.

271
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,499
And I teach creative writing at mvcc.

272
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:12,344
- No kids?
- Not yet.

273
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,839
So, what does Amy do most days?

274
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,091
A woman with all those degrees,
what does she do?

275
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:18,012
I don't know. She keeps busy.

276
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:19,551
Doing what?

277
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:23,393
She's a voracious reader.

278
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:26,272
So, she's always got a book in her hand.

279
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:28,812
Well, days can get long.

280
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,694
I know a few housewives, that evening
glass of wine starts coming at noon.

281
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,023
Or prescription pills.

282
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,567
Just last week, we had a soccer mom.

283
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:38,071
Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in
over some oxycontin.

284
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:40,203
Ever since that mall went bust,
half the town is out of work.

285
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,740
We cannot keep up
with the drug violence.

286
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:44,203
I'm pretty sure that's not it.

287
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:46,084
Has Amy got friends we can talk to?

288
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:49,371
No, not really.

289
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,376
No friends? This whole town?

290
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:55,048
She was very close with my mom,
before she passed away.

291
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:57,208
You know, we have a pretty serious
homeless problem...

292
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:58,377
In our neighborhood.

293
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,477
I think maybe you guys
should check that out.

294
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:02,762
We'll look into that.

295
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:05,434
You got to the bar around 11:00 today.

296
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:07,064
Where were you before that?
Just to cross that out.

297
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Well, I was home.

298
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:10,731
I left at 9:30,
I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.

299
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:12,401
I went to Sawyer beach
and read the news.

300
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,609
Did you visit with anyone there?

301
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,610
I kind of go to Sawyer beach
for the solitude.

302
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:20,358
So, your wife has no friends here.

303
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,245
Is she kinda standoffish?

304
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,702
Ivy league? Rubs people the wrong way?

305
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,243
She's from New York.

306
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:30,752
She's complicated.
She's got very high standards.

307
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:31,791
Type a?

308
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,539
That can make you crazy
if you're not like that.

309
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,416
You seem pretty laid-back. Type b.

310
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:39,634
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?

311
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:41,975
God, I don't know.
I'd have to look it up at the house.

312
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,800
You don't know if she has friends,
you don't know what she does all day...

313
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,757
And you don't know
your wife's blood type.

314
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:47,927
Sure you all are married?

315
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:50,685
Maybe it's type o.

316
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,906
- Where are her folks? New York?
- Yeah.

317
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,648
Can they get here time
for this press conference tomorrow?

318
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,730
Tomorrow? I have no idea.
I haven't talked to them.

319
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,615
You haven't called
your wife's parents yet?

320
00:17:58,652 --> 00:18:01,072
You can't get a signal in this building.
I've been in here talking to you.

321
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,573
Call them, please, Nick. Now.

322
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:04,825
Fine.

323
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,290
Should I know my wife's blood type?

324
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:13,332
No.

325
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:17,457
I apologize, marybeth.
I didn't know what was going on.

326
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:19,004
Now I'm at the station...

327
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:22,547
And the cops are at the house,
and it's serious and I'm calling you.

328
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,220
There's a lot of things
that are being juggled right now.

329
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:29,523
I'm standing right next to
detective Rhonda boney...

330
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:31,518
Who's the lead investigator on this
and she's...

331
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,940
My mother-in-law
would like to speak with you.

332
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:38,647
This is detective boney.

333
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,032
I wanna go home.

334
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:42,528
I don't know why I have to be here.

335
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:45,201
I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.

336
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,370
Dad?

337
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:48,373
This is my father. What's going on?

338
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,450
Really? You're Nick dunne?

339
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:51,703
We've been trying to get a hold of you
all afternoon.

340
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:53,407
I've been right there.
My wife is missing.

341
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:54,577
- Bitch.
- Don't.

342
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,005
Your father wandered out of comfort hill
after lunch.

343
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:59,424
We found him walking route 79,
disoriented.

344
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:00,923
We've been trying to call you
for the last...

345
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:02,214
I don't get a cell signal
in this building.

346
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:04,217
I've been sitting
20 feet away from you.

347
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:06,181
Sir, please
don't take that tone with me.

348
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,340
Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.

349
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:08,927
Dad, stop.

350
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,810
You wanna drive him home?

351
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:15,767
I think that would be wise. Thanks.

352
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:38,422
This voice mailbox is currently full.

353
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:40,336
Fuck.

354
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:45,054
Get your fucking hands off me.

355
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:46,472
Thanks.

356
00:19:59,273 --> 00:20:03,443
Everyone told us
and told us and told us...

357
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:06,075
Marriage is hard work.

358
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:09,163
And compromise and more work.

359
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,449
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter."

360
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:14,413
"When young Amy's hope did wane...

361
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:15,794
"She wandered here..."

362
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:18,331
Well, it's not true.
Not for me and Nick.

363
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,005
"...in search of Jane."

364
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:23,964
With us, two years...

365
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:25,634
It's just good.

366
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,973
Austen.

367
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:33,469
You were an alienated teen
and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you.

368
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:35,974
Look at that.

369
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:39,191
My God.

370
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:40,978
You naughty minx.

371
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:44,113
Well, technically, we are supposed
to fuck at the next stop.

372
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:45,781
Yeah, in keeping with tradition.

373
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:49,319
But I might be willing
to bend the rules this once.

374
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:51,074
God bless Jane Austen.

375
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:10,433
I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.
It's confirmed by the...

376
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:15,678
Thank you.

377
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,185
Year two. Cotton.

378
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:29,192
We had that joke that our sex
was too good for ordinary.

379
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:31,698
So, these are 2,000 thread-count...

380
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:39,665
we're so cute.
I wanna punch us in the face.

381
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:42,916
That's pretty great.
I mean, that is pretty great.

382
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:45,838
Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?

383
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:48,049
I don't need a lawyer.
Here, I'll do this.

384
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:50,509
Well, did they ask personal stuff
about Amy?

385
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:51,721
You know, they asked...

386
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:53,512
Why didn't she have any friends?

387
00:21:53,554 --> 00:21:54,394
What did you say?

388
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:56,429
- I said she was complicated.
- Nick!

389
00:21:57,432 --> 00:22:00,062
Everyone knows "complicated"
is code for "bitch."

390
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:07,272
God. I feel sick.

391
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:08,727
Thanks.

392
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:11,026
It's so bizarre.

393
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:13,571
It seems like the kind of thing
that would happen to Amy.

394
00:22:13,615 --> 00:22:14,785
She always attracts...

395
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:16,415
Drama?

396
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:18,624
You can say it. It's just me and you.

397
00:22:18,662 --> 00:22:21,212
Just because
I don't like to be around Amy...

398
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:22,688
Doesn't mean I don't care about her.

399
00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:27,756
Anyway, whoever took her
is bound to bring her back.

400
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:39,137
Detective? Excuse me.

401
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:41,813
I'm noelle hawthorne.
I'm Amy's best friend.

402
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:45,596
Well, great. Where do you live, noelle?

403
00:22:46,148 --> 00:22:47,648
Five doors down. 1032.

404
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:49,901
Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.

405
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:51,823
Can I come by in half an hour?

406
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:53,572
- Y'all know anything yet?
- I'm sorry.

407
00:22:53,614 --> 00:22:56,414
I got guys on the clock in here.
But you give me 30 minutes.

408
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,780
But that's usually bath time.

409
00:22:58,535 --> 00:23:01,125
Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.

410
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:05,174
All right. So, what do you got?

411
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,839
It was definitely blood spatter
you saw in the kitchen.

412
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:09,997
Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.

413
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:12,417
Not that weird,
but that is awfully high.

414
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,096
So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.

415
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:15,304
Well, okay.

416
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:19,103
Interesting.

417
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:20,259
What's that?

418
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:23,807
House is rented in her name.
Car's in her name.

419
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:26,982
Credit cards, utilities,
phone bill, all in her name.

420
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:28,862
Even his bar's in her name.

421
00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:30,819
I don't know that that's so surprising.

422
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:32,479
No. But it is humiliating.

423
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:33,438
What you got?

424
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:36,317
It's with her unmentionables.

425
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:51,549
Well, we have our first clue.

426
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,311
I have to take a shower.

427
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,141
No, don't. You've been up all night.

428
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:08,346
You wanna look
like you've been up all night.

429
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,322
Hey, be careful today, okay?

430
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,689
That's a weird thing to say.

431
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:17,495
Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.
You can seem angry, like...

432
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:19,031
please don't say, "like dad."

433
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,834
Or else you swing into your momma's-boy
charm offensive and that can feel glib.

434
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:22,659
Perfect.

435
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:25,453
I'll balance on the exact fucking edge
of your emotional razor.

436
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,327
Okay. Just be...

437
00:24:27,374 --> 00:24:29,294
Myself?

438
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,674
...sponsoring a raffle to
benefit west county 4h...

439
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:35,172
And raffling season tickets for
mizzou football.

440
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:38,515
Buy your tickets at the wing hut or
local tri-state tire stores.

441
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:44,428
Your in-laws made it.

442
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:47,485
- Hi, rand.
- Hey, man.

443
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,349
I'm detective boney.

444
00:24:48,395 --> 00:24:50,355
I'm the twin. Margo.

445
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:53,477
We played tennis yesterday, Nick.
I just can't get over it.

446
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,865
Marybeth, I am really sorry.

447
00:24:54,902 --> 00:24:56,692
I knew you never should have
moved back here.

448
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:57,857
We didn't have a lot of choice.

449
00:24:57,905 --> 00:25:01,575
We are all worried. We are all scared.

450
00:25:01,617 --> 00:25:06,077
But we are all here now.
And we will find Amy, together.

451
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:18,218
Should I just go first, and then
you guys can say something?

452
00:25:18,258 --> 00:25:19,258
Good.

453
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:25,226
As you know, my wife,
Amy elliott dunne...

454
00:25:25,265 --> 00:25:28,065
Disappeared from our home
on the morning of July 5th...

455
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:31,559
Under suspicious circumstances.

456
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:33,065
Louder!

457
00:25:33,106 --> 00:25:37,526
If anyone out there
has any information...

458
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,899
Please come forward.

459
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:41,567
Thank you.

460
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,739
I'm rand elliott.
My wife, marybeth elliott.

461
00:25:46,787 --> 00:25:47,867
Should I have said my name?

462
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:50,415
Amy is our only child.

463
00:25:50,457 --> 00:25:54,457
She's bright, she's beautiful.
She's kind.

464
00:25:54,962 --> 00:25:56,462
She really is amazing Amy.

465
00:25:56,797 --> 00:25:59,507
You know, there are
millions of people out there...

466
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,090
Who grew up with her and care about her.

467
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:04,765
We care about her, we love her.

468
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:08,062
And we just want her back.

469
00:26:09,977 --> 00:26:12,597
Amy is a decorated scholar.

470
00:26:12,646 --> 00:26:15,616
She forged a successful career
in journalism.

471
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:17,939
She returned here
to her husband's hometown...

472
00:26:17,985 --> 00:26:20,325
And she made a life in her adopted home.

473
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:23,785
Now, Amy needs your help.

474
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:27,954
We're establishing a volunteer
headquarters at the drury lodge.

475
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:33,335
We have a hotline, 1-855-4-Amy-tips.

476
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:39,004
And our website is
www.Findamazingamy.Com.

477
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:41,466
- Mr. dunne!
- Mr. elliott!

478
00:26:42,843 --> 00:26:44,683
Mr. dunne, any signs of foul play?

479
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,100
Mr. elliott, when was the last time
you spoke to your daughter?

480
00:26:51,602 --> 00:26:52,602
Smile.

481
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:00,783
That's all for now. Thank you.

482
00:27:03,363 --> 00:27:06,203
Amy is the kind of girl
who attracts admirers.

483
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,121
Right, Nick?

484
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,329
Yeah, definitely.

485
00:27:08,368 --> 00:27:10,868
And we've had instances...

486
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:12,963
- Where things got...
- scary.

487
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,458
Do you know about desi collings?

488
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,170
Yeah, I know all about desi collings.

489
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,460
He was obsessed.

490
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,843
He attempted suicide after Amy
broke up with him sophomore year.

491
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,421
We had to file a restraining order.

492
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,846
This would be high school?
Twenty years ago?

493
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:28,105
But he recently moved to St. Louis.
That's just two hours away.

494
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:30,008
To be fair, he is from St. Louis.

495
00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:31,677
We also have Tommy O'Hara.

496
00:27:31,725 --> 00:27:33,935
This is only eight years ago,
in New York.

497
00:27:33,977 --> 00:27:36,267
She broke up with him,
he got very physical.

498
00:27:36,313 --> 00:27:37,993
- She filed charges.
- What was the charge?

499
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,113
Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?

500
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,110
I only know it was bad.

501
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:43,942
- I didn't know this.
- Okay.

502
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:45,897
Thank you.

503
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:47,238
Anything more recent?

504
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:52,577
Not that I know of.

505
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,960
Hey, Nick? You got a minute?

506
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:00,747
Yeah.

507
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:07,514
Imagine our confusion.

508
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:08,723
A missing persons case...

509
00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:11,352
And in your wife's dressing room,
we find an envelope marked "clue."

510
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,640
That's for our anniversary.

511
00:28:13,684 --> 00:28:15,984
My wife does these treasure hunts.

512
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:18,399
I'm hoping you can tell me
what this means.

513
00:28:18,438 --> 00:28:19,438
You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?

514
00:28:19,857 --> 00:28:22,177
It'll help me track Amy's movements
before she disappeared.

515
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,571
Of course. Okay.

516
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:27,201
"Although this spot
couldn't be tighter...

517
00:28:27,948 --> 00:28:30,658
"It's a cozy room
for my favorite writer."

518
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:34,705
I know this one!

519
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:38,715
Although this spot
couldn't be any tighter...

520
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:42,134
It's a cozy room for my favorite writer.

521
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,050
After-school meeting,
don't mind if I do.

522
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:50,012
Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.

523
00:28:54,057 --> 00:28:56,387
Well, well. What does it say?

524
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:57,945
Clue two.

525
00:28:59,062 --> 00:29:02,442
"Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.

526
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,821
"You'll be the spy,
and I'll be his lover.

527
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:08,361
"Let's head on over...

528
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:10,285
"To the little brown house.

529
00:29:10,324 --> 00:29:14,034
"We'll play hot, doting husband,
sweet, loving spouse."

530
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,080
These yours?

531
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:19,707
No.

532
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,210
But you read the first clue.

533
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:24,381
Randy Professor, naughty student.

534
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:25,461
I blush.

535
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:27,266
Me and my ex just swapped cards.

536
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:29,837
Where's this little brown house?

537
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:31,395
I have no idea.

538
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:15,966
Hello?

539
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,520
Nicholas dunne.

540
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,274
Under my father's name, William dunne.

541
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:32,784
My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?
Can you just turn the bell...

542
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:33,823
yeah, I know.

543
00:30:33,824 --> 00:30:35,454
It's... it's...

544
00:30:37,911 --> 00:30:40,201
It's "puddles," right?
Or is it "poodles?"

545
00:30:44,126 --> 00:30:45,756
We're good.

546
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:48,457
Hello, stranger.

547
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:50,635
Fancy meeting you here.

548
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:52,974
It's your dad's house, right?

549
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,640
Are you following me?

550
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:55,548
What you doing?

551
00:30:55,596 --> 00:30:57,766
Like you said, it's my dad's house.

552
00:30:57,806 --> 00:31:00,516
I come by once a week,
make sure the place hasn't burned down.

553
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:03,601
But it looks okay.

554
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:06,234
I'll walk you out.

555
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:10,984
You know...

556
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:14,278
I thought maybe
this was the little brown house.

557
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:15,533
From the clue.

558
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,534
Nope. Still blue.

559
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:38,219
Picture me,
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

560
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,973
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had."

561
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:45,606
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

562
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:49,656
"So open the door, and look alive."

563
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:51,983
Bitch!

564
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:58,697
Want to test your marriage
for weak spots?

565
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:00,828
Add one recession...

566
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:02,451
Subtract two jobs.

567
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:05,158
It's surprisingly effective.

568
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:07,617
Promise me we'll never be like them.

569
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:08,788
Like who?

570
00:32:08,836 --> 00:32:10,596
All those awful couples we know.

571
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:14,589
Those wives who treat their men
like dancing monkeys...

572
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,093
To be trained and paraded.

573
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:19,428
Husbands who treat their wives
like the highway patrol...

574
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:22,395
To be out-foxed and avoided.

575
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,815
I think I'm gonna be laid off.

576
00:32:29,606 --> 00:32:32,396
We're in a recession.
If it happens, we'll deal with it.

577
00:32:32,442 --> 00:32:34,652
I'll probably be next.

578
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:35,945
We have each other.

579
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,861
Everything else is background noise.

580
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,740
You are exceptional.

581
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:50,709
My turn.

582
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:56,048
My parents' publisher dropped them,
and they're in debt up to their ears.

583
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:56,921
That's terrible.

584
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:59,387
And they need to borrow
from my trust fund.

585
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:00,928
How much?

586
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:03,181
Almost a million.

587
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:05,355
That's almost all of it.

588
00:33:05,392 --> 00:33:07,692
This is where you say,
"everything else is background noise."

589
00:33:07,728 --> 00:33:08,768
Amy, if you're laid off...

590
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:10,187
And I'm laid off...

591
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,360
I said I'd do it.

592
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:12,648
Without talking to me?

593
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,271
- Well, it's...
- Your call.

594
00:33:14,318 --> 00:33:15,898
...their money, technically.

595
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:21,994
You know what? You're right.

596
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:24,618
Everything else
is just background noise.

597
00:33:33,587 --> 00:33:34,587
Hey.

598
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:39,877
More games?

599
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:41,547
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.

600
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:44,223
What's the laptop for?

601
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:46,307
Laptop-ing.

602
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,480
I see.

603
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,520
You can give your parents $879,000
without talking to me...

604
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:55,695
But God forbid I buy a video game
without getting your permission.

605
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:56,784
You are spending a lot.

606
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:59,068
You don't trust me.
You don't trust my judgment.

607
00:33:59,112 --> 00:34:00,672
You certainly don't trust my intention.

608
00:34:00,697 --> 00:34:01,657
What are you talking about?

609
00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:03,318
That's the basic tenet
of a prenup, isn't it?

610
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:05,617
Why are you throwing that
in my face again?

611
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:07,201
Because it's easy to throw.

612
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,046
Nick, I don't get it.

613
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,420
I don't get why you're daring me
to be someone I don't wanna be.

614
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:14,538
The nagging shrew.
The controlling bitch.

615
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:16,956
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.

616
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:18,175
I'm sorry.

617
00:34:18,215 --> 00:34:20,555
I just don't know how to do this.
I've never not had a job.

618
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,592
I flipped burgers, I painted houses.

619
00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:24,646
You'll get another job.

620
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:30,269
Hi, go.

621
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,770
What? Hold on. What?

622
00:34:33,814 --> 00:34:35,234
- And suddenly...
- Slow down, what is it?

623
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,274
...I knew everything
was about to get worse.

624
00:34:37,317 --> 00:34:38,897
Okay, tell me what's wrong.

625
00:35:06,263 --> 00:35:07,763
- Bless you, Nick.
- Father.

626
00:35:08,432 --> 00:35:09,852
Hey, tom. Mayor!

627
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:11,142
Nick, good to see you.

628
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:12,185
Good to see you.

629
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:13,477
Hey, guys, hey.

630
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:17,398
- Jodie.
- Nick.

631
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:20,729
Oh, we'll find her.

632
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:37,419
You look like hammered shit.

633
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:39,131
Thank you.

634
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:48,941
You ever see that guy
in the glasses before?

635
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:52,348
Don't worry. We videotape everybody
that comes in and out of these things.

636
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:54,182
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...

637
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:55,268
Do-gooders?

638
00:35:55,312 --> 00:35:56,522
Freaks.

639
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:58,523
Hey, I meant to ask you.

640
00:35:58,565 --> 00:36:00,025
Noelle hawthorne?

641
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:02,621
She lives on your street.
Amy's best friend.

642
00:36:03,737 --> 00:36:05,067
I've never heard the name
noelle hawthorne.

643
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:07,283
She and her husband have triplets.

644
00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:08,324
Oh.

645
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:11,447
Yeah, we might say hi to them
on the street.

646
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:13,999
But "best friend"? No.

647
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,750
Excuse me, one sec.

648
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,135
He acted like
noelle was a complete stranger.

649
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:23,262
Of course he did.

650
00:36:23,632 --> 00:36:24,922
Look, these two are yours.

651
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:27,337
Oh, look. He's being a good guy...

652
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,306
So everybody can see him
being a good guy.

653
00:36:29,346 --> 00:36:31,136
You really don't like him, do you?

654
00:36:31,181 --> 00:36:32,681
What's to like?

655
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:58,001
This mailbox is currently full.
Press one to...

656
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:01,421
Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.
My name's shawna Kelly.

657
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,380
I am so sorry for your troubles.

658
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:05,343
Thank you. That's kind.

659
00:37:05,382 --> 00:37:06,802
Are you remembering to eat?

660
00:37:06,842 --> 00:37:07,972
Well, a lot of cold cuts.

661
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:12,180
I'm gonna fix you up
my world-famous chicken frito pie.

662
00:37:12,222 --> 00:37:13,742
That's very kind and very unnecessary.

663
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,395
You have to keep your strength.

664
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:16,934
Would you...

665
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:19,691
Say, "chicken frito pie!"

666
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:25,191
You know what?

667
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:27,825
Would you delete that picture for me?

668
00:37:27,863 --> 00:37:29,743
- It's a nice photo.
- I know it is.

669
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,201
But just do me a favor.

670
00:37:31,241 --> 00:37:32,991
Will you?

671
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:35,955
Would you go ahead
and please delete that picture?

672
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:36,996
You just press...

673
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,539
What is wrong with you?

674
00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:39,872
Could you please not
share that with anyone?

675
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:43,247
I will share it with whomever I please.

676
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:48,419
- Dude.
- Yeah?

677
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:49,797
Marybeth is pissed.

678
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:51,511
Why?

679
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:55,761
Marybeth?

680
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:59,227
It's like you're the goddamn
homecoming king.

681
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:04,107
It was important to my mother
that I be polite...

682
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,069
I be considerate, I be a gentleman.

683
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:07,819
It looked like you were having fun.

684
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:10,111
I am in a nightmare!

685
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,242
All I'm trying to do is be nice...

686
00:38:13,283 --> 00:38:16,993
To the people who are
volunteering to help find Amy.

687
00:38:18,956 --> 00:38:20,716
You're right.

688
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,543
And I'm sorry.

689
00:38:25,546 --> 00:38:29,176
My God, this place literally
smells like feces.

690
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:43,483
In your searches,
did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?

691
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:44,942
No.

692
00:38:46,066 --> 00:38:47,776
How about a brand new stratocaster?

693
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:48,938
No, nothing like that.

694
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:51,743
Well, all right.

695
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:59,793
How big's that TV? It's not 65-inch.

696
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,120
No, it's nowhere near that.

697
00:39:01,165 --> 00:39:02,255
Okay.

698
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,118
- Kibble?
- Excuse me?

699
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:06,248
He asked me to feed his cat.

700
00:39:06,295 --> 00:39:07,505
I saw some in the pantry.

701
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,588
Detective boney, officer gilpin?
Noelle hawthorne!

702
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:14,224
I know y'all are in there!

703
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:18,761
Would you please escort miss hawthorne
and her children back out to the street?

704
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:21,731
Detective boney!

705
00:39:21,768 --> 00:39:25,598
Just remind her
it is a possible crime scene.

706
00:39:34,323 --> 00:39:39,163
Look at that pie-eating grin,
from a guy whose wife is missing.

707
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,538
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

708
00:39:48,295 --> 00:39:49,805
How's marybeth?

709
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:51,668
She's a wreck.

710
00:39:51,715 --> 00:39:53,175
And you?

711
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,430
Awesome.

712
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:56,469
Hey...

713
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,050
Have you told me everything?

714
00:39:58,305 --> 00:39:59,305
Of course.

715
00:39:59,306 --> 00:40:00,306
Everything?

716
00:40:00,307 --> 00:40:01,467
Why would you even ask me that?

717
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:05,687
Ever since you walked into the bar that
morning Amy went missing, you seem...

718
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,980
- Off.
- I am off.

719
00:40:09,024 --> 00:40:12,364
Everybody's examining me
and projecting their shit on me.

720
00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:15,822
All I want is to come over here,
have a beer with you...

721
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:17,204
And not be judged.

722
00:40:17,241 --> 00:40:18,741
Can we do that?

723
00:40:19,827 --> 00:40:21,157
Of course.

724
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:24,538
You know what I keep thinking?

725
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:25,621
If mom were here?

726
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:29,086
Yeah. Like I'm 12.

727
00:40:30,546 --> 00:40:33,346
Nick, mom would fix it.

728
00:40:40,556 --> 00:40:43,776
I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.

729
00:40:46,687 --> 00:40:49,017
- Love you.
- Love you.

730
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,400
So, here's a strange, new sentence.

731
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:58,915
I am a missourian.

732
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:07,086
Bye, dad.

733
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:12,461
No money, no jobs, no prospects.

734
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:14,674
And then, we heard from go.

735
00:41:14,715 --> 00:41:16,635
Mama Maureen...

736
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:19,515
Stage 4 breast cancer.

737
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,520
So, we moved to Missouri.

738
00:41:24,558 --> 00:41:26,178
I don't mind.

739
00:41:26,226 --> 00:41:29,396
I just wish he'd asked.

740
00:41:41,074 --> 00:41:43,534
Nick is happy to be home.

741
00:41:43,577 --> 00:41:46,077
But I don't know
if he's happy I'm with him.

742
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:50,831
I feel like something
he loaded by mistake.

743
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:54,046
Something to be jettisoned,
if necessary.

744
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:56,297
Something disposable.

745
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:00,763
I feel like I could disappear.

746
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:46,763
Oh, my God!

747
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:48,767
- I saw you on TV.
- Okay.

748
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:50,479
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

749
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:52,729
- She just vanished?
- She's just gone.

750
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:54,611
- I've been so worried about you.
- Where have you been?

751
00:42:54,648 --> 00:42:56,478
I called you a hundred times.
You gotta pick up your phone!

752
00:42:56,525 --> 00:42:57,575
Rehearsals.

753
00:42:57,609 --> 00:42:58,649
What?

754
00:42:58,694 --> 00:42:59,994
Godspell.

755
00:43:01,822 --> 00:43:03,412
My sister's asleep in the other room.

756
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:04,568
I needed to see you.

757
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:06,276
I know this is a bad idea.

758
00:43:06,326 --> 00:43:07,826
Can you at least tell me you love me?

759
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,620
I do love you, but we have
to be really careful right now.

760
00:43:11,665 --> 00:43:12,925
I've been so scared.

761
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:14,168
Between rehearsals?

762
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:15,959
You told me
I needed to have my own life.

763
00:43:16,003 --> 00:43:17,503
I know.

764
00:43:17,546 --> 00:43:18,806
We need to stop.

765
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:20,009
I need you.

766
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:22,973
Touch me.

767
00:43:26,388 --> 00:43:29,008
Stop it. Come here.

768
00:43:30,392 --> 00:43:32,102
Sit down.

769
00:43:32,144 --> 00:43:33,484
Okay.

770
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,610
Did you, by any chance,
tell anybody anything about us?

771
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,149
Even in texting, or on Facebook.

772
00:43:39,193 --> 00:43:41,993
Facebook? I use the disposable phone.

773
00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:43,949
You buy my presents in cash.
I'm not stupid, Nick.

774
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,869
I know, sweetie. Did you leave a
pair of red panties in my office?

775
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:50,329
I don't know. Maybe.
They better be mine.

776
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,370
Sweetheart, think.

777
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:53,831
I don't know. I'd have to check
my red panty inventory.

778
00:43:53,874 --> 00:43:56,504
Andie, I need you
to take this seriously, okay?

779
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,343
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other, until...

780
00:43:58,378 --> 00:43:59,838
Until when?

781
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,840
Until it's safe.

782
00:44:01,882 --> 00:44:03,472
You were going to get a divorce.

783
00:44:03,509 --> 00:44:05,679
Never say that out loud again.

784
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:08,389
Okay. I'm sorry.

785
00:44:09,264 --> 00:44:10,264
I don't wanna fight.

786
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:13,847
I just wanna be with you.

787
00:44:13,894 --> 00:44:15,064
Andie, please...

788
00:44:15,896 --> 00:44:17,566
That's all I want.

789
00:44:18,899 --> 00:44:19,979
I can't.

790
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,569
It's our last time together.

791
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:26,663
Let's make the most of it.

792
00:44:33,413 --> 00:44:36,753
Real quick, but then you have to go.

793
00:44:39,586 --> 00:44:42,376
My husband has come undone.

794
00:44:42,422 --> 00:44:45,382
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...

795
00:44:45,425 --> 00:44:48,145
But as it turns out, we couldn't.

796
00:44:51,431 --> 00:44:53,181
It means a lot that you came.

797
00:44:54,351 --> 00:44:55,731
We took a hit on the brownstone...

798
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:58,099
And I used the last of my trust fund
to buy him a bar.

799
00:44:58,856 --> 00:45:01,116
So far, it's just costing money.

800
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,110
Nick uses me for sex when he wants.

801
00:45:12,286 --> 00:45:14,796
Otherwise, I don't exist.

802
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:18,119
We should go to outback tonight.

803
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,417
That would be nice.

804
00:45:19,459 --> 00:45:22,539
Last night, I went from desperate
to pathetic.

805
00:45:23,463 --> 00:45:26,633
I became someone I don't even like.

806
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:28,475
The kind of woman I used to mock.

807
00:45:28,886 --> 00:45:30,596
You're out so much.

808
00:45:30,637 --> 00:45:32,967
- I know.
- Stay home.

809
00:45:33,015 --> 00:45:35,355
- I can't, I'm already late.
- Then, can I come?

810
00:45:35,392 --> 00:45:37,182
You would hate it.

811
00:45:37,227 --> 00:45:40,477
It's a bunch
of my dorky high school friends.

812
00:45:41,481 --> 00:45:44,361
Do our code. No bullshit.

813
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:47,188
I thought
we weren't gonna be that couple.

814
00:45:53,702 --> 00:45:55,542
Okay, bye.

815
00:45:57,206 --> 00:46:00,176
- Hey, I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

816
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:01,579
Something positive.

817
00:46:03,003 --> 00:46:04,043
Maybe it's time.

818
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:07,169
Now is literally the worst time.

819
00:46:07,216 --> 00:46:08,456
It would be a new start for us.

820
00:46:08,675 --> 00:46:11,395
And for me,
I would have a real purpose here.

821
00:46:11,428 --> 00:46:12,638
A child is not a hobby.

822
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:13,679
Not a hobby.

823
00:46:14,681 --> 00:46:15,891
An inspiration.

824
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:19,563
We could have had this fight
four hours ago. I'm late.

825
00:46:19,603 --> 00:46:20,853
I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.

826
00:46:20,896 --> 00:46:24,316
You really wanna be the couple
that has a baby to save their marriage?

827
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:25,358
"Save"?

828
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:28,029
Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!

829
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,240
- And you're gonna walk out the door now?
- Yeah!

830
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,820
You're a fucking coward.

831
00:46:32,866 --> 00:46:34,736
No, it can't go on like this.

832
00:46:34,785 --> 00:46:35,835
Really?

833
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:37,369
- I won't.
- You won't?

834
00:46:37,412 --> 00:46:39,752
You won't?
Why, it's not good enough for you?

835
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:40,710
It's not even close!

836
00:46:40,749 --> 00:46:42,879
You stupid bitch!

837
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,420
What scared me
wasn't that he'd pushed me.

838
00:46:46,463 --> 00:46:50,303
What scared me was how much
he wanted to hurt me more.

839
00:46:50,634 --> 00:46:52,724
What scared me
was that I'd finally realized...

840
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,390
I am frightened of my own husband.

841
00:47:09,278 --> 00:47:10,778
You want me to call for backup?

842
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:12,911
Nah, I'll protect you.

843
00:47:20,664 --> 00:47:22,084
Jesus.

844
00:47:27,129 --> 00:47:29,799
They ought to burn this place down.

845
00:47:30,257 --> 00:47:31,917
Seems like folks are trying.

846
00:47:37,431 --> 00:47:39,721
You really think this is anything?

847
00:47:39,766 --> 00:47:41,926
Cross it off the list.

848
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,740
Hey, Jason.

849
00:47:54,781 --> 00:47:56,321
What's up, Rhonda?

850
00:47:56,366 --> 00:47:58,616
"...and dedicated to the proposition
that all men..."

851
00:47:59,703 --> 00:48:02,203
- Have you seen this girl around here?
- Why do you ask?

852
00:48:02,456 --> 00:48:04,296
She was reported missing.

853
00:48:07,461 --> 00:48:09,341
"...and so dedicated, can long endure."

854
00:48:09,379 --> 00:48:11,299
Yeah. I remember her.

855
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,470
What did she want?
Weed, pills?

856
00:48:15,135 --> 00:48:16,145
She wanted a gun.

857
00:48:16,386 --> 00:48:18,426
I told her it's not my thing.

858
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:21,472
I felt bad, though.
She seemed really desperate.

859
00:48:21,517 --> 00:48:25,097
She said it needed to be small,
so she could keep it close.

860
00:48:25,145 --> 00:48:26,985
Are you sure this is her?

861
00:48:27,022 --> 00:48:29,152
You don't forget a girl like that
in here.

862
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,650
She was all in pink.

863
00:48:31,693 --> 00:48:34,243
It was Valentine's day.

864
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:39,949
For Valentine's day,
I thought I'd buy a gun.

865
00:48:39,993 --> 00:48:42,583
That is how crazy I've become.

866
00:48:43,664 --> 00:48:47,794
Nick wants me gone
but he won't ask for a divorce.

867
00:48:47,835 --> 00:48:51,965
In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,
his only line of credit.

868
00:48:52,005 --> 00:48:53,515
The bitch with the prenup.

869
00:48:55,342 --> 00:48:57,682
I could go home to my parents...

870
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:00,139
But I'd have to tell them the truth.

871
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,020
And I don't even know
if I believe the truth.

872
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:06,849
Can I really think Nick would hurt me?

873
00:49:07,479 --> 00:49:09,859
I'm being paranoid. Crazy.

874
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:12,191
It's just...

875
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:15,691
I'd sleep better with a gun.

876
00:49:26,582 --> 00:49:28,002
Oh, shit.

877
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:31,671
Wake up, baby.
My sister's gonna come out here.

878
00:49:36,049 --> 00:49:38,259
- Sorry to rush you.
- It's okay.

879
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,720
- Here. Let me help you.
- Okay.

880
00:49:41,763 --> 00:49:43,853
Just get that.

881
00:49:46,518 --> 00:49:48,018
Be very careful.

882
00:49:48,854 --> 00:49:49,854
I'm all right.

883
00:49:49,897 --> 00:49:52,477
Here you go.

884
00:49:52,524 --> 00:49:54,404
Promise me we'll talk every day.

885
00:49:54,443 --> 00:49:55,693
Okay, we will.

886
00:49:55,736 --> 00:49:58,456
Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.

887
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:00,319
Don't go crazy.

888
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:01,625
Okay.

889
00:50:06,038 --> 00:50:09,368
You fucking idiot.

890
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:13,246
You fucking asshole!
You fucking lied to my fucking face!

891
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:16,305
I'm sorry.

892
00:50:18,091 --> 00:50:19,091
How old is she?

893
00:50:19,426 --> 00:50:20,626
She's in her early 20s.

894
00:50:21,553 --> 00:50:22,553
How long?

895
00:50:23,096 --> 00:50:25,886
- A year and a half.
- You lied to me for over a year?

896
00:50:25,933 --> 00:50:27,613
If I told you,
you would have made me stop.

897
00:50:27,643 --> 00:50:29,233
It's so fucking small.

898
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:32,229
You're a liar and a cheat!
You're just like dad!

899
00:50:32,272 --> 00:50:33,562
How did you even meet her?

900
00:50:33,607 --> 00:50:34,817
She's one of my students.

901
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:37,738
I thought writers hated clichés.

902
00:50:37,778 --> 00:50:38,608
I'm not a writer.

903
00:50:38,654 --> 00:50:40,904
"Boo-hoo, I got laid off.
I guess I'll fuck a teenager."

904
00:50:40,948 --> 00:50:43,738
It wasn't like that, okay? You have
no idea how shitty it was with Amy...

905
00:50:43,784 --> 00:50:45,704
How fucking terrible she made me feel.

906
00:50:45,744 --> 00:50:48,914
Flyover boy.
I would get knots in my stomach...

907
00:50:48,956 --> 00:50:50,796
Just coming home,
knowing she would be sitting there...

908
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:52,993
Dissatisfied, before I even
walked in the fucking door.

909
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:54,421
This is so bad.

910
00:50:54,461 --> 00:50:56,551
If anybody finds out,
you're totally fucked.

911
00:50:56,588 --> 00:50:59,208
Boney found a pair of panties
in my office...

912
00:50:59,258 --> 00:51:00,798
Where, occasionally, Andie and I...

913
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,380
I don't know what the fuck it means.

914
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:03,587
Are they super-twat's?

915
00:51:03,637 --> 00:51:05,717
Her name is Andie.

916
00:51:05,764 --> 00:51:07,264
She's not entirely sure.

917
00:51:07,307 --> 00:51:08,967
So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...

918
00:51:09,017 --> 00:51:10,427
Who isn't sure
where she leaves her undies?

919
00:51:10,477 --> 00:51:12,727
If they're not Andie's,
that means that they're Amy's...

920
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:14,481
And she left them there for me to find.

921
00:51:14,523 --> 00:51:18,283
Nick, I was scared for you before,
and now, I'm fucking petrified.

922
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:20,608
We're having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife...

923
00:51:20,654 --> 00:51:23,784
And this morning, you're kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye!

924
00:51:23,824 --> 00:51:24,994
Can you imagine?

925
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:28,947
Have you watched television lately?

926
00:51:28,996 --> 00:51:32,006
Cable news is all over your shit.

927
00:51:32,624 --> 00:51:34,464
I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?

928
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:36,791
His wife's nowhere to be found...

929
00:51:36,837 --> 00:51:40,507
And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting.
Cute pic, huh?

930
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:43,009
- Who is that?
- Some fucking tragedy groupie.

931
00:51:43,051 --> 00:51:44,971
- Who the fuck is that?
- I don't know.

932
00:51:45,012 --> 00:51:46,142
She was trying to give me a casserole.

933
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,310
On the show today
we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...

934
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:51,889
Patron Saint to wife-killers everywhere.

935
00:51:52,186 --> 00:51:55,696
Tanner bolt, would you actually consider
defending Nick dunne?

936
00:51:55,731 --> 00:51:56,861
Well, let me just say...

937
00:51:56,899 --> 00:51:59,649
As always, Ellen,
thank you for such a warm welcome.

938
00:51:59,693 --> 00:52:01,243
But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne.

939
00:52:01,528 --> 00:52:04,028
Listen, just because this guy
isn't walking around weeping...

940
00:52:04,072 --> 00:52:05,492
That doesn't mean that he's not hurting.

941
00:52:05,532 --> 00:52:08,872
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath
is a lack of empathy.

942
00:52:08,911 --> 00:52:10,871
But the truth is,
you'd have to be a sociopath...

943
00:52:11,371 --> 00:52:13,161
To behave normally in this situation...

944
00:52:13,207 --> 00:52:15,957
Because it's the most
abnormal situation in the world.

945
00:52:16,001 --> 00:52:18,671
Tanner, are you trying to tell me
that this photo...

946
00:52:18,712 --> 00:52:20,962
Is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior?

947
00:52:21,006 --> 00:52:23,666
I'm so sick
of being picked apart by women.

948
00:52:25,052 --> 00:52:26,932
You need to hire Tanner bolt.

949
00:52:29,014 --> 00:52:29,814
I don't deserve this.

950
00:52:29,848 --> 00:52:31,718
Innocent until proven guilty.

951
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:34,137
That's exactly what you deserve.

952
00:52:34,186 --> 00:52:35,736
Go home, Nick.

953
00:53:01,713 --> 00:53:03,133
Hey, buddy.

954
00:53:19,022 --> 00:53:20,812
I can't believe
we haven't arrested this guy.

955
00:53:20,858 --> 00:53:22,818
We're not gonna arrest anybody...

956
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,420
Just because some blonde dunce says so.

957
00:53:24,778 --> 00:53:27,278
Why are you going so easy on him?
You got a crush?

958
00:53:27,573 --> 00:53:30,913
One, I am conducting an investigation,
not a witch-hunt.

959
00:53:30,951 --> 00:53:32,871
And, two,
don't talk to me that way, ever.

960
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:34,201
She was trying to buy a gun.

961
00:53:34,246 --> 00:53:36,416
We don't know who
or what was scaring her, gil.

962
00:53:36,456 --> 00:53:37,456
Give me the update.

963
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:40,578
No drug angles panned out yet,
so cross that off the list.

964
00:53:40,627 --> 00:53:42,587
I talked to the nurses
who care for Nick's father.

965
00:53:42,629 --> 00:53:45,339
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as
a kitten, so cross that off the list.

966
00:53:45,382 --> 00:53:46,552
- Hey.
- Hey.

967
00:53:46,592 --> 00:53:50,012
So, luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of July.

968
00:53:50,053 --> 00:53:51,353
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

969
00:53:51,388 --> 00:53:52,508
The blood is profuse.

970
00:53:52,556 --> 00:53:54,776
It is Amy's, type b,
and we should have DNA soon.

971
00:53:54,808 --> 00:53:55,888
Thoughts on a weapon?

972
00:53:55,934 --> 00:53:57,854
Trajectory indicates blunt force.

973
00:53:57,895 --> 00:54:00,235
Maybe a club or a two-by-four.

974
00:54:00,814 --> 00:54:04,074
She fell there,
but I doubt she got back up.

975
00:54:04,109 --> 00:54:05,529
Amy's medical records come in?

976
00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:07,569
No, we'll have them later tonight.

977
00:54:09,156 --> 00:54:10,576
My wife says he's a killer.

978
00:54:10,824 --> 00:54:13,164
Well, if Tiffany says...

979
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:39,769
Hey.

980
00:54:40,103 --> 00:54:41,103
Hey.

981
00:54:45,526 --> 00:54:46,686
Thank you all for coming out.

982
00:54:48,362 --> 00:54:49,992
Hey Donnie, how are you?

983
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:53,370
Rich, thank you so much.

984
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:01,676
Hey.

985
00:55:08,715 --> 00:55:12,305
Thank you, folks.
Thank you for being here tonight.

986
00:55:12,344 --> 00:55:14,144
It just means the world to our family.

987
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,140
And to Amy.

988
00:55:16,723 --> 00:55:18,723
As you all know...

989
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,850
My wife, Amy elliott dunne...

990
00:55:22,896 --> 00:55:24,396
Disappeared three days ago.

991
00:55:24,982 --> 00:55:28,532
And I want to implore anyone
who has any information at all...

992
00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:31,489
Please come forward. Help us.

993
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,450
So hot.

994
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:33,859
He is so creepy.

995
00:55:33,907 --> 00:55:37,367
I wanna say something, because I think
some of you might be wondering...

996
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:39,331
And are too polite to ask.

997
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:42,920
I had nothing to do
with the disappearance of my wife.

998
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,460
I'm cooperating with the police.

999
00:55:45,502 --> 00:55:47,542
I haven't hired a lawyer.

1000
00:55:47,588 --> 00:55:48,708
I have nothing to hide.

1001
00:55:50,007 --> 00:55:52,507
Amy is my soul mate.

1002
00:55:52,759 --> 00:55:54,049
She is brilliant...

1003
00:55:54,595 --> 00:55:57,685
She's charming, and wise.

1004
00:55:58,015 --> 00:55:59,725
I love you, Amy.

1005
00:56:03,854 --> 00:56:04,944
Asshole.

1006
00:56:06,273 --> 00:56:08,193
I love my wife...

1007
00:56:08,567 --> 00:56:09,777
So much.

1008
00:56:12,279 --> 00:56:16,619
And I may not behave for the cameras
the way they want me to...

1009
00:56:17,034 --> 00:56:20,244
And if they wanna punish me for that,
that's okay.

1010
00:56:20,287 --> 00:56:23,997
But I just wanna ask you in the media,
please, harass me...

1011
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:27,081
But don't harass
the people of this town.

1012
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:29,167
If you need to mock somebody, mock me.

1013
00:56:29,213 --> 00:56:30,423
Nick!

1014
00:56:30,464 --> 00:56:32,624
But please don't turn this investigation
into a circus.

1015
00:56:32,633 --> 00:56:34,223
Where's your wife, Nick?

1016
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:35,759
Let the police do their jobs.

1017
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,800
What did you do to your pregnant wife?

1018
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,890
Did you tell them that, Nick?

1019
00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:42,983
Did you tell them
Amy was six weeks pregnant?

1020
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,900
Thank you for your support tonight.
Let's find Amy.

1021
00:56:51,068 --> 00:56:52,708
Go ahead,
if you guys wanna say something.

1022
00:56:56,782 --> 00:56:58,162
Gil, go, go.

1023
00:57:00,494 --> 00:57:01,624
Nick, where are you going?

1024
00:57:01,662 --> 00:57:03,252
Stop him!

1025
00:57:03,288 --> 00:57:05,498
No questions right now. Thank you.

1026
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:09,541
Why are you running away?

1027
00:57:10,629 --> 00:57:12,049
Don't run.

1028
00:57:13,131 --> 00:57:14,131
Everybody, stay back.

1029
00:57:18,929 --> 00:57:21,099
Guys, come on. You know better.

1030
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:23,599
Get off the grass, get down to the curb.

1031
00:57:23,642 --> 00:57:25,062
- Hey, gil...
- On it.

1032
00:57:25,102 --> 00:57:26,142
All right.

1033
00:57:26,186 --> 00:57:27,976
All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.

1034
00:57:28,021 --> 00:57:29,311
Hello?

1035
00:57:30,065 --> 00:57:31,615
Hello?

1036
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:32,480
Fuck.

1037
00:57:32,526 --> 00:57:34,036
You scared me. Want a drink?

1038
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:35,569
Did you know she was pregnant?

1039
00:57:35,612 --> 00:57:37,742
I told you,
noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy.

1040
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:38,821
She doesn't even know Amy.

1041
00:57:39,491 --> 00:57:41,091
They look like pretty good friends
to me.

1042
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:52,087
Look, I don't know. But it certainly
doesn't prove that she's pregnant.

1043
00:57:52,129 --> 00:57:53,339
We have her medical records coming.

1044
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,260
- Good.
- So, let's talk while we wait.

1045
00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:57,509
Let's start over here.
The scene of the crime.

1046
00:57:57,551 --> 00:58:00,431
You see, we've seen dozens
of home invasions.

1047
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,430
Dozens and dozens.

1048
00:58:02,472 --> 00:58:04,682
This area right here, it looked wrong
from the second we saw it.

1049
00:58:04,725 --> 00:58:07,895
The whole thing looked staged.
Watch this.

1050
00:58:09,813 --> 00:58:13,233
And yet, they remained upright
throughout this life-and-death struggle?

1051
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:15,400
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

1052
00:58:15,444 --> 00:58:17,074
Did you do any housekeeping
the day your wife went missing?

1053
00:58:17,112 --> 00:58:18,112
No.

1054
00:58:18,113 --> 00:58:20,363
Because our guys did a luminol test.

1055
00:58:20,407 --> 00:58:23,077
And I'm sorry to tell you,
but that kitchen lit up.

1056
00:58:23,118 --> 00:58:25,368
Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick.
A lot.

1057
00:58:25,412 --> 00:58:26,412
Oh, my God.

1058
00:58:26,413 --> 00:58:27,753
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.

1059
00:58:27,789 --> 00:58:30,249
Wait a second.
Why would they mop up the blood...

1060
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:31,892
If they're trying to stage
a crime scene?

1061
00:58:31,919 --> 00:58:34,669
No blood and no body
suggests kidnapping.

1062
00:58:34,713 --> 00:58:37,133
It tells us,
look at people outside the house.

1063
00:58:37,174 --> 00:58:38,594
Like these homeless you keep mentioning.

1064
00:58:38,634 --> 00:58:41,724
A pool of blood and no body
suggests homicide.

1065
00:58:41,762 --> 00:58:43,762
It tells us to look at people
inside the house.

1066
00:58:43,805 --> 00:58:46,525
- Which is what we're doing here, Nick.
- I see.

1067
00:58:46,558 --> 00:58:49,518
So, how was your marriage, Nick?
Because right now, all we got is noelle.

1068
00:58:49,561 --> 00:58:51,101
She says, "not good."

1069
00:58:51,146 --> 00:58:52,646
Gil, what do you and your wife
argue about?

1070
00:58:52,689 --> 00:58:54,819
- What pisses you off?
- Money, lack thereof.

1071
00:58:54,858 --> 00:58:56,608
Me and my ex, it's the same.

1072
00:58:56,652 --> 00:58:59,992
I mention that because
we got a look at your finances, Nick.

1073
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:02,740
$117,000 in credit card debt.

1074
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,743
- What?
- I pulled up some of the merchandise.

1075
00:59:04,785 --> 00:59:06,795
There are these fun little splurges.

1076
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:08,369
I didn't buy any of this stuff.

1077
00:59:08,413 --> 00:59:09,543
I don't even golf!

1078
00:59:09,581 --> 00:59:10,911
I do! You bought great clubs.

1079
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:12,248
I like the robot dog.

1080
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:14,252
This is identity theft!
This is a felony!

1081
00:59:14,294 --> 00:59:15,254
We need to find out who did this!

1082
00:59:15,295 --> 00:59:17,055
All right.
Let's talk about life insurance.

1083
00:59:17,089 --> 00:59:19,629
Because in April,
you bumped up Amy's life insurance...

1084
00:59:19,675 --> 00:59:20,675
To $1.2 million.

1085
00:59:20,717 --> 00:59:23,087
Yes, I did. That was her idea.
She wanted me to.

1086
00:59:23,136 --> 00:59:24,296
You filed the paperwork.

1087
00:59:24,346 --> 00:59:25,546
Because she told me to!

1088
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,310
Hold on a sec.

1089
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:29,139
Yeah? Okay.

1090
00:59:31,061 --> 00:59:32,231
For sure?

1091
00:59:32,646 --> 00:59:33,816
All right.

1092
00:59:37,901 --> 00:59:38,901
She was pregnant.

1093
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,620
This is insane.

1094
00:59:44,658 --> 00:59:47,158
So, my question becomes...

1095
00:59:47,202 --> 00:59:50,122
I don't want to talk
to you again, ever...

1096
00:59:50,164 --> 00:59:51,334
Without a lawyer.

1097
00:59:59,673 --> 01:00:00,673
Margo!

1098
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,560
Hey.

1099
01:00:14,938 --> 01:00:17,358
Just hold on a second. Let me finish.

1100
01:00:17,399 --> 01:00:18,319
Nick?

1101
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:21,148
I hear you, I hear you.
I was as surprised as...

1102
01:00:21,195 --> 01:00:25,035
I know you're upset.
I had no idea she was pregnant.

1103
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:28,579
Listen, I thought so, too,
but evidently that wasn't...

1104
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:33,209
you want to know the truth?

1105
01:00:33,248 --> 01:00:35,618
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.

1106
01:00:38,045 --> 01:00:40,095
Well, I'm as surprised as...

1107
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:43,223
you told me you didn't want kids.

1108
01:00:44,218 --> 01:00:45,618
I was trying to put a good face on.

1109
01:00:45,636 --> 01:00:47,516
Then, suddenly,
you've got a pregnant wife.

1110
01:00:47,554 --> 01:00:48,894
That's a problem for you.

1111
01:00:48,931 --> 01:00:52,021
Especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend.

1112
01:00:52,059 --> 01:00:53,519
Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott!

1113
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,890
You have to fucking talk to me!

1114
01:00:57,564 --> 01:01:01,614
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids
because she didn't want me to.

1115
01:01:01,652 --> 01:01:03,862
Because it would have just been
another reason for you to hate her.

1116
01:01:03,904 --> 01:01:05,784
And we had enough of those already!
It was easier to just...

1117
01:01:05,822 --> 01:01:08,032
- lie to me?
- I wanted kids!

1118
01:01:08,075 --> 01:01:10,245
When we first moved here,
I went to a fertility clinic!

1119
01:01:10,285 --> 01:01:11,955
- It didn't work?
- I did my part!

1120
01:01:11,995 --> 01:01:13,045
Masturbate.

1121
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,790
When it came time for Amy to do her thing,
all of a sudden it was like...

1122
01:01:14,832 --> 01:01:16,372
"Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."

1123
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:18,416
Now, who would believe you?

1124
01:01:19,586 --> 01:01:20,786
All right.

1125
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:32,220
This is a letter from the clinic...

1126
01:01:32,266 --> 01:01:34,736
Notifying me
that they're gonna destroy my sample...

1127
01:01:34,768 --> 01:01:36,768
Unless I contact them.

1128
01:01:38,021 --> 01:01:39,561
So, I gave it to Amy.

1129
01:01:39,606 --> 01:01:42,606
The next day, I saw it in the trash.

1130
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:44,231
But you were already with Andie
by then, right?

1131
01:01:44,278 --> 01:01:47,108
I wanted a baby with Amy.

1132
01:01:47,155 --> 01:01:51,335
A year ago, Amy being pregnant
would have been the best thing ever!

1133
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,755
"When your poor Amy has a cold,
this dessert just..."

1134
01:01:59,793 --> 01:02:01,173
this is the clue you couldn't solve.

1135
01:02:01,211 --> 01:02:02,341
Yeah.

1136
01:02:04,047 --> 01:02:07,417
A letter from desi.
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?

1137
01:02:07,467 --> 01:02:09,837
It was the fucking rich guy
who would do anything for her.

1138
01:02:09,887 --> 01:02:11,847
It just kept hanging over my head.
It was disgusting.

1139
01:02:11,889 --> 01:02:12,889
Your prenup?

1140
01:02:13,223 --> 01:02:16,183
Nick, why have you kept this stuff?
It's like a little box of hate.

1141
01:02:16,226 --> 01:02:18,016
I don't know, go! Maybe I hate her!

1142
01:02:20,898 --> 01:02:24,018
I love you no matter what.

1143
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:25,437
But you need to tell me.

1144
01:02:25,485 --> 01:02:26,905
Tell you what?

1145
01:02:27,738 --> 01:02:29,358
What are you asking me?

1146
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:34,119
Are you asking me
if I killed my wife, go?

1147
01:02:34,578 --> 01:02:36,658
Is that what you're asking me?
If I murdered my wife?

1148
01:02:36,705 --> 01:02:39,125
I would never ask you that!

1149
01:02:43,086 --> 01:02:44,086
Margo!

1150
01:02:56,892 --> 01:02:59,102
Don't walk on the glass.

1151
01:03:00,812 --> 01:03:03,442
You have no clue, do you?

1152
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,830
Why was he here that night?

1153
01:03:24,461 --> 01:03:27,301
His wife is missing. Why come here?

1154
01:03:27,339 --> 01:03:28,339
Who cares?

1155
01:03:28,549 --> 01:03:29,799
Rhonda, we got this.

1156
01:03:29,842 --> 01:03:31,342
Let's make the arrest.

1157
01:03:31,385 --> 01:03:33,475
Do you know how hard it is
to make a murder case without a body?

1158
01:03:33,512 --> 01:03:34,432
No.

1159
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:36,641
Well, it's incredibly hard.

1160
01:03:36,682 --> 01:03:39,562
So, I want one last thing.

1161
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:40,601
What's that?

1162
01:03:42,229 --> 01:03:44,519
I want a body.

1163
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:50,111
Picture me.
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

1164
01:03:50,153 --> 01:03:51,783
Be careful.

1165
01:03:56,326 --> 01:04:00,746
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had."

1166
01:04:05,294 --> 01:04:06,294
Fuck.

1167
01:04:08,255 --> 01:04:11,095
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

1168
01:04:12,342 --> 01:04:14,512
So, open the door...

1169
01:04:14,553 --> 01:04:15,933
Punish. Wood. Beach.

1170
01:04:15,971 --> 01:04:18,471
...and look alive.

1171
01:04:21,602 --> 01:04:24,192
Punish. Wood.

1172
01:04:25,355 --> 01:04:26,945
Wood.

1173
01:04:59,056 --> 01:05:01,776
I will practice believing
my husband loves me...

1174
01:05:01,808 --> 01:05:04,228
And will love this baby.

1175
01:05:04,895 --> 01:05:08,525
That this child
might really save our marriage.

1176
01:05:09,399 --> 01:05:10,859
But I could be wrong.

1177
01:05:17,032 --> 01:05:18,952
Because sometimes...

1178
01:05:19,952 --> 01:05:22,162
The way he looks at me...

1179
01:05:23,247 --> 01:05:24,997
I think...

1180
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,120
Man of my dreams...

1181
01:05:28,043 --> 01:05:30,133
Father of my child...

1182
01:05:30,921 --> 01:05:34,921
This man of mine may kill me.

1183
01:05:36,301 --> 01:05:38,301
He may truly...

1184
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:40,221
Kill me.

1185
01:05:42,933 --> 01:05:43,933
Wtf?

1186
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:11,466
I am so much happier now that I'm dead.

1187
01:06:16,508 --> 01:06:18,088
Technically, "missing."

1188
01:06:18,927 --> 01:06:20,587
Soon to be presumed dead.

1189
01:06:22,306 --> 01:06:23,436
Gone.

1190
01:06:24,391 --> 01:06:27,641
And my lazy, lying, cheating,
oblivious husband...

1191
01:06:27,686 --> 01:06:30,976
Will go to prison for my murder.

1192
01:06:32,274 --> 01:06:34,824
Nick dunne took my pride
and my dignity...

1193
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,360
And my hope and my money.

1194
01:06:37,404 --> 01:06:40,994
He took and took from me
until I no longer existed.

1195
01:06:41,033 --> 01:06:42,453
That's murder.

1196
01:06:42,493 --> 01:06:45,293
Let the punishment fit the crime.

1197
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:48,871
To fake a convincing murder,
you have to have discipline.

1198
01:06:53,086 --> 01:06:56,086
You befriend a local idiot.

1199
01:06:59,635 --> 01:07:02,805
Harvest the details
of her humdrum life.

1200
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:06,770
And cram her with stories
about your husband's violent temper.

1201
01:07:07,893 --> 01:07:10,193
Secretly create some money troubles.

1202
01:07:10,437 --> 01:07:13,607
Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.

1203
01:07:16,235 --> 01:07:18,445
With the help of the unwitting...

1204
01:07:18,487 --> 01:07:20,487
Bump up your life insurance.

1205
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:25,369
Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.

1206
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:28,700
Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.

1207
01:07:29,164 --> 01:07:33,794
You need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss.

1208
01:07:33,836 --> 01:07:36,806
And America loves pregnant women.

1209
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:40,130
As if it's so hard to spread your legs.

1210
01:07:40,175 --> 01:07:41,475
You know what's hard?

1211
01:07:41,969 --> 01:07:43,929
Faking a pregnancy.

1212
01:07:43,971 --> 01:07:46,141
First, drain your toilet.

1213
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:50,600
Invite pregnant idiot into your home...

1214
01:07:50,644 --> 01:07:53,154
And ply her with lemonade.

1215
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:00,488
Steal pregnant idiot's urine.

1216
01:08:02,698 --> 01:08:04,198
Voilà.

1217
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:08,201
A pregnancy is now part
of your legal medical record.

1218
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:16,040
Happy anniversary.

1219
01:08:18,714 --> 01:08:21,474
Wait for your clueless husband...

1220
01:08:21,508 --> 01:08:23,378
To start his day.

1221
01:08:24,845 --> 01:08:26,305
Off he goes.

1222
01:08:26,346 --> 01:08:28,506
And the clock is ticking.

1223
01:08:29,683 --> 01:08:32,183
Meticulously stage your crime scene...

1224
01:08:32,853 --> 01:08:36,863
With just enough mistakes
to raise the specter of doubt.

1225
01:08:38,275 --> 01:08:40,235
You need to bleed.

1226
01:08:40,569 --> 01:08:41,569
A lot.

1227
01:08:42,196 --> 01:08:43,866
A lot, a lot.

1228
01:08:47,201 --> 01:08:49,031
A head wound kind of bleed.

1229
01:08:49,703 --> 01:08:52,203
A crime scene kind of bleed.

1230
01:08:55,209 --> 01:08:57,329
You need to clean poorly...

1231
01:08:57,377 --> 01:08:58,377
Like he would.

1232
01:08:59,087 --> 01:09:01,587
Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.

1233
01:09:02,216 --> 01:09:04,806
And leave a little something behind.

1234
01:09:05,469 --> 01:09:07,219
A fire in July?

1235
01:09:08,764 --> 01:09:09,854
And because you're you...

1236
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,140
You don't stop there.

1237
01:09:11,558 --> 01:09:13,768
You need a diary.

1238
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:16,730
Minimum, 300 entries
on the Nick and Amy story.

1239
01:09:17,397 --> 01:09:19,687
Start with the fairy tale early days.

1240
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:22,033
Those are true. And they're crucial.

1241
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:24,069
You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.

1242
01:09:24,404 --> 01:09:27,034
After that, you invent.

1243
01:09:27,074 --> 01:09:28,074
The spending.

1244
01:09:28,075 --> 01:09:29,875
The abuse. The fear.

1245
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:32,870
The threat of violence.

1246
01:09:32,913 --> 01:09:34,873
And Nick thought he was the writer.

1247
01:09:35,582 --> 01:09:36,872
Burn it just the right amount.

1248
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,590
Make sure the cops will find it.

1249
01:09:45,592 --> 01:09:48,642
Finally, honor tradition
with a very special treasure hunt.

1250
01:09:51,223 --> 01:09:54,023
And if I get everything right,
the world will hate Nick...

1251
01:09:54,059 --> 01:09:56,769
For killing his beautiful,
pregnant wife.

1252
01:09:56,812 --> 01:09:59,442
And after all the outrage,
when I'm ready...

1253
01:09:59,481 --> 01:10:01,481
I'll go out on the water
with a handful of pills...

1254
01:10:01,483 --> 01:10:04,033
And a pocket full of stones.

1255
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:06,859
And when they find my body,
they'll know...

1256
01:10:06,905 --> 01:10:10,205
Nick dunne dumped his beloved
like garbage.

1257
01:10:10,242 --> 01:10:12,582
And she floated down
past all the other...

1258
01:10:12,619 --> 01:10:15,949
Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.

1259
01:10:17,332 --> 01:10:19,292
Then, Nick will die, too.

1260
01:10:20,169 --> 01:10:22,039
Nick and Amy will be gone.

1261
01:10:22,087 --> 01:10:24,207
But, then, we never really existed.

1262
01:10:24,256 --> 01:10:27,476
Nick loved a girl
I was pretending to be.

1263
01:10:27,509 --> 01:10:28,509
"Cool girl."

1264
01:10:28,969 --> 01:10:32,809
Men always use that
as their defining compliment.

1265
01:10:32,848 --> 01:10:33,848
"She's a cool girl."

1266
01:10:34,975 --> 01:10:36,105
Cool girl is hot.

1267
01:10:36,143 --> 01:10:37,563
Cool girl is game.

1268
01:10:37,603 --> 01:10:38,603
Cool girl is fun.

1269
01:10:38,937 --> 01:10:41,437
Cool girl never gets angry at her man.

1270
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:44,111
She only smiles in a chagrined,
loving manner...

1271
01:10:44,776 --> 01:10:47,736
And then presents her mouth for fucking.

1272
01:10:47,779 --> 01:10:49,779
She likes what he likes.

1273
01:10:49,823 --> 01:10:53,283
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster
who loves fetish manga.

1274
01:10:54,328 --> 01:10:57,618
If he likes girls gone wild,
she's a mall babe...

1275
01:10:57,664 --> 01:11:01,464
Who talks football
and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.

1276
01:11:01,502 --> 01:11:05,092
When I met Nick dunne,
I knew he wanted cool girl.

1277
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:07,800
And for him, I'll admit,
I was willing to try.

1278
01:11:07,841 --> 01:11:09,841
I wax-stripped my pussy raw.

1279
01:11:10,511 --> 01:11:13,641
I drank canned beer
watching Adam sandler movies.

1280
01:11:13,889 --> 01:11:16,679
I ate cold pizza
and remained a size two.

1281
01:11:16,725 --> 01:11:18,685
I blew him semi-regularly.

1282
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,350
I lived in the moment.

1283
01:11:21,647 --> 01:11:24,187
I was fucking game.

1284
01:11:24,816 --> 01:11:26,856
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.

1285
01:11:27,694 --> 01:11:30,994
Nick teased out of me
things I didn't know existed.

1286
01:11:31,031 --> 01:11:34,331
A lightness, a humor, an ease.

1287
01:11:34,368 --> 01:11:37,288
But I made him smarter. Sharper.

1288
01:11:37,329 --> 01:11:40,959
I inspired him to rise to my level.

1289
01:11:40,999 --> 01:11:44,749
I forged the man of my dreams.

1290
01:11:47,089 --> 01:11:50,009
We were happy pretending
to be other people.

1291
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,880
We were the happiest couple we knew.

1292
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:56,512
And what's the point of being together
if you're not the happiest?

1293
01:11:57,182 --> 01:11:59,392
But Nick got lazy.

1294
01:11:59,434 --> 01:12:01,644
He became someone
I did not agree to marry.

1295
01:12:01,687 --> 01:12:04,857
He actually expected me
to love him unconditionally.

1296
01:12:05,524 --> 01:12:10,034
Then he dragged me, penniless,
to the navel of this great country...

1297
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:14,030
And found himself a newer,
younger, bouncier...

1298
01:12:14,074 --> 01:12:15,074
Cool girl.

1299
01:12:17,411 --> 01:12:21,581
You think I'd let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever?

1300
01:12:22,082 --> 01:12:23,752
No fucking way.

1301
01:12:24,126 --> 01:12:25,926
He doesn't get to win.

1302
01:12:36,263 --> 01:12:40,223
My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth,
Missouri guy.

1303
01:12:42,644 --> 01:12:45,104
He needed to learn.

1304
01:12:45,814 --> 01:12:48,444
Grown-ups work for things.

1305
01:12:48,984 --> 01:12:50,944
Grown-ups pay.

1306
01:12:52,321 --> 01:12:54,911
Grown-ups suffer consequences.

1307
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:59,620
Wait.

1308
01:12:59,995 --> 01:13:02,795
I need 20 seconds where you
don't judge me, interrupt me...

1309
01:13:02,831 --> 01:13:04,461
Or get angry.

1310
01:13:05,918 --> 01:13:07,458
Okay.

1311
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,383
Is that all the stuff
from the credit cards?

1312
01:13:13,425 --> 01:13:16,595
Where do you store goodies
for anniversary five?

1313
01:13:16,637 --> 01:13:17,427
Wood.

1314
01:13:17,471 --> 01:13:20,601
- Woodshed.
- Yeah, my woodshed.

1315
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:23,141
That fucking bitch.

1316
01:13:24,978 --> 01:13:26,308
- I thought...
- it's all right.

1317
01:13:26,355 --> 01:13:27,815
I would have, too.

1318
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:32,476
What's that present?

1319
01:13:32,528 --> 01:13:34,278
I don't know.

1320
01:13:34,321 --> 01:13:36,281
Let's find out.

1321
01:13:42,871 --> 01:13:46,791
"Dear husband, I know you think
you're moving through this world unseen.

1322
01:13:46,834 --> 01:13:48,254
"Don't believe that for a second.

1323
01:13:48,293 --> 01:13:50,574
"I know where you've been,
and I know where you're going."

1324
01:13:53,799 --> 01:13:55,839
"For this anniversary,
I've arranged a trip.

1325
01:13:55,884 --> 01:13:57,764
"Follow the river, up, up, up.

1326
01:13:57,803 --> 01:14:00,513
"Sit back and relax,
because you are done."

1327
01:14:00,556 --> 01:14:01,976
What's "up, up river"?

1328
01:14:02,015 --> 01:14:04,185
"Up the river." Prison.

1329
01:14:04,226 --> 01:14:06,146
Fucking crazy bitch.

1330
01:14:06,186 --> 01:14:07,806
That's what this is.

1331
01:14:07,855 --> 01:14:10,155
She's framing me for her murder.

1332
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:11,480
You married a complete psychopath.

1333
01:14:11,525 --> 01:14:13,655
The morning of our anniversary...

1334
01:14:13,694 --> 01:14:17,994
I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
I just couldn't do it.

1335
01:14:18,031 --> 01:14:20,491
I couldn't fake it for another year,
another day.

1336
01:14:20,534 --> 01:14:21,454
Then what happened?

1337
01:14:21,493 --> 01:14:22,793
Before I could say anything, she said...

1338
01:14:22,828 --> 01:14:26,208
"I need you to go somewhere
and really think about our marriage."

1339
01:14:26,248 --> 01:14:27,498
She knew I would go to Sawyer beach.

1340
01:14:27,541 --> 01:14:28,831
So you'd have no alibi.

1341
01:14:28,876 --> 01:14:31,096
She stage-managed me.

1342
01:14:31,378 --> 01:14:35,048
She knew exactly what I would do.
And I fucking did it.

1343
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:36,630
I went to the beach,
I thought about our marriage.

1344
01:14:36,675 --> 01:14:38,385
I came back
and decided I wanted a divorce.

1345
01:14:38,427 --> 01:14:39,667
And by the time you got home...

1346
01:14:39,678 --> 01:14:41,218
she was gone.

1347
01:14:41,847 --> 01:14:42,717
You fuck!

1348
01:14:42,764 --> 01:14:44,354
She's good.

1349
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:47,350
Part of me was relieved...

1350
01:14:47,394 --> 01:14:49,694
When I thought she was gone.

1351
01:14:54,067 --> 01:14:55,777
Punch and Judy puppets.

1352
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:01,870
Remember, he beats Judy to death
and kills that baby.

1353
01:15:01,909 --> 01:15:03,029
So I'm punch.

1354
01:15:04,036 --> 01:15:06,046
We already knew that, Amy,
what's your point?

1355
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:10,046
Does Missouri have the death penalty?

1356
01:15:36,944 --> 01:15:38,364
Hey, neighbor.

1357
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:41,659
It's been weeks
since I had anyone decent next door.

1358
01:15:42,282 --> 01:15:44,912
Well, I don't know how decent I feel.

1359
01:15:44,952 --> 01:15:48,082
As long as you don't own a python
and blast death metal at 4 am...

1360
01:15:48,121 --> 01:15:50,121
We're gonna be best friends.

1361
01:15:50,165 --> 01:15:52,255
All right. Nice meeting you.

1362
01:15:52,292 --> 01:15:53,882
I'm greta.

1363
01:15:54,503 --> 01:15:55,793
I'm Nancy.

1364
01:15:55,838 --> 01:15:57,798
Are you going to the marina?
I could use some creamer.

1365
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,260
I'm sorry. I can't.

1366
01:15:59,299 --> 01:16:00,509
I've got work to do.

1367
01:16:00,801 --> 01:16:02,841
All right. See you around!

1368
01:16:03,136 --> 01:16:05,046
You will.

1369
01:16:51,018 --> 01:16:56,228
Come on.
Show me that darling Nicky smile.

1370
01:16:58,025 --> 01:16:59,905
You asshole.

1371
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:16,885
Hey.

1372
01:17:19,671 --> 01:17:21,421
Nancy.

1373
01:17:23,717 --> 01:17:25,547
Nancy.

1374
01:17:26,553 --> 01:17:28,763
It's hot again today.

1375
01:17:31,058 --> 01:17:32,888
So, where are you from?

1376
01:17:33,393 --> 01:17:34,563
Let me guess.

1377
01:17:37,689 --> 01:17:38,689
Nebraska.

1378
01:17:40,901 --> 01:17:42,111
New Orleans.

1379
01:17:45,572 --> 01:17:48,072
You know, I am an expert oiler.

1380
01:17:48,116 --> 01:17:49,906
Oh, I just bet you are.

1381
01:17:49,952 --> 01:17:52,582
Lotions and balms. Ointment.

1382
01:17:53,288 --> 01:17:55,208
I would hate
for y'all to get tan lines.

1383
01:17:55,249 --> 01:17:57,249
So sweet.

1384
01:17:58,085 --> 01:18:00,755
Okay. You know where I'll be.

1385
01:18:03,632 --> 01:18:06,052
I see we have the same taste in men.

1386
01:18:07,761 --> 01:18:10,011
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.

1387
01:18:10,055 --> 01:18:13,105
Least you could do
is not keep his secrets for him.

1388
01:18:14,142 --> 01:18:15,522
Let me guess.

1389
01:18:15,561 --> 01:18:19,441
He's trying to watch the big game
and you just won't shut up.

1390
01:18:19,731 --> 01:18:22,571
No, you don't seem
like much of a talker.

1391
01:18:22,609 --> 01:18:23,609
I got it.

1392
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:26,070
You caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank...

1393
01:18:26,113 --> 01:18:28,113
And he apologized to you
by busting you a good one.

1394
01:18:30,492 --> 01:18:31,492
Worse.

1395
01:18:31,618 --> 01:18:32,618
Worse?

1396
01:18:33,453 --> 01:18:37,163
I went to the bar where he works
to surprise him.

1397
01:18:37,207 --> 01:18:41,917
And out he comes with this girl
who had no business being in a bar.

1398
01:18:44,882 --> 01:18:46,882
On the very first night that we met...

1399
01:18:47,134 --> 01:18:51,304
We walked by a bakery
that was having their sugar delivered.

1400
01:18:52,139 --> 01:18:54,519
And it was in the air, everywhere.

1401
01:18:54,558 --> 01:18:56,848
A sugar storm.

1402
01:18:56,894 --> 01:18:59,024
And before he kissed me...

1403
01:18:59,062 --> 01:19:01,152
He leaned in...

1404
01:19:02,649 --> 01:19:04,939
And did this.

1405
01:19:15,621 --> 01:19:18,081
- And guess what.
- What?

1406
01:19:18,123 --> 01:19:19,833
He did the exact same thing with her.

1407
01:19:24,087 --> 01:19:27,087
That is the most disgusting thing
I ever heard.

1408
01:19:27,132 --> 01:19:28,842
Thank you.

1409
01:19:43,607 --> 01:19:45,187
Thanks very much.

1410
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:54,280
Well, we've gone mainstream.

1411
01:20:09,883 --> 01:20:13,013
It's an appeals process,
so we will attempt to appeal to them.

1412
01:20:13,053 --> 01:20:15,183
Mr. bolt. Tanner bolt?

1413
01:20:17,057 --> 01:20:18,467
Nick dunne.

1414
01:20:18,517 --> 01:20:20,807
I have been sitting by the phone,
my friend.

1415
01:20:24,273 --> 01:20:25,523
I'm sorry.

1416
01:20:25,566 --> 01:20:27,406
Do you not believe me?

1417
01:20:27,442 --> 01:20:30,692
No, I believe you. It's just the
craziest thing I've ever heard.

1418
01:20:30,737 --> 01:20:34,067
I love it. But, for you, it sucks.

1419
01:20:34,783 --> 01:20:38,083
But you gotta have a grudging respect
for your wife at this point, right?

1420
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,700
- Are you laughing me out of the building?
- No!

1421
01:20:39,746 --> 01:20:41,496
Are you kidding me? I'm in.

1422
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,000
I'm way in.

1423
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:45,671
You came to the right guy.
This is what I do, Nick.

1424
01:20:45,711 --> 01:20:49,131
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.
I win the unwinnable cases.

1425
01:20:49,173 --> 01:20:50,843
$100,000?

1426
01:20:50,883 --> 01:20:52,423
We'll figure something out.

1427
01:20:52,467 --> 01:20:53,507
I'll give you a special...

1428
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:56,430
"My wife is skilled
in the art of vengeance" rate.

1429
01:20:56,471 --> 01:20:57,511
Okay.

1430
01:20:57,556 --> 01:20:59,186
So, what's the plan?

1431
01:20:59,224 --> 01:21:01,104
Well, right now,
it's a "he said, she said."

1432
01:21:01,143 --> 01:21:03,603
- She's telling a better story.
- No, Nick.

1433
01:21:03,645 --> 01:21:05,485
She is telling the perfect story.

1434
01:21:05,772 --> 01:21:09,072
So, we need to start today
to prepare your defense, should we need it.

1435
01:21:09,109 --> 01:21:11,509
- And if we decide to go with your version of...
- the truth.

1436
01:21:12,404 --> 01:21:15,744
Then we'll need to realign
the public's perception of Amy.

1437
01:21:15,782 --> 01:21:18,032
Make them stop seeing her
as America's sweetheart...

1438
01:21:18,076 --> 01:21:21,406
And see her for what she is,
which a mind-fucker of the first degree.

1439
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:25,790
Now, that is a huge realignment.
We'll need other voices besides yours.

1440
01:21:25,834 --> 01:21:28,094
There has to be someone out there
that she's screwed with in the past.

1441
01:21:28,128 --> 01:21:31,208
There's a New York guy.
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

1442
01:21:31,256 --> 01:21:33,626
Eight years ago,
she pressed charges against him.

1443
01:21:33,675 --> 01:21:35,845
That should be easy to find.

1444
01:21:36,386 --> 01:21:39,756
Ex-classmate, desi collings.

1445
01:21:39,806 --> 01:21:41,686
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.

1446
01:21:42,976 --> 01:21:45,226
You go talk to Tommy,
and I'll draw up the contract.

1447
01:21:49,525 --> 01:21:52,535
I told you, you came to the right guy.

1448
01:21:54,738 --> 01:21:55,948
Apparently.

1449
01:22:04,998 --> 01:22:06,788
Tommy?

1450
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:08,384
Yeah.

1451
01:22:08,794 --> 01:22:10,754
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1452
01:22:13,841 --> 01:22:15,551
You're gonna want a drink.

1453
01:22:16,093 --> 01:22:17,433
Yeah.

1454
01:22:17,469 --> 01:22:20,259
So, she said you got physical with her.

1455
01:22:20,305 --> 01:22:23,275
No, dude, she said I raped her.

1456
01:22:23,308 --> 01:22:25,678
First degree, felony rape.

1457
01:22:26,436 --> 01:22:28,146
- Did you do it?
- Did you do it?

1458
01:22:29,314 --> 01:22:31,404
I was looking at 30 years to life.

1459
01:22:31,942 --> 01:22:33,482
- Did you get a trial?
- Fuck, no.

1460
01:22:33,527 --> 01:22:35,737
Do I look like
I would do well in the yard?

1461
01:22:35,779 --> 01:22:38,699
I pled down, man.
Sexual assault one, no jail time.

1462
01:22:39,116 --> 01:22:40,786
- That's something.
- Oh, yeah.

1463
01:22:40,826 --> 01:22:42,246
I've been unemployed
for the last eight years...

1464
01:22:42,286 --> 01:22:44,796
Because I have to write "sexual offender"
on every job application.

1465
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:47,790
I'm on a neighborhood watch list,
because I have to register as a predator.

1466
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:51,173
I haven't had a date in almost a decade,
because if a girl googles me...

1467
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:55,050
Could you walk me through what happened?

1468
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:58,470
I meet Amy at this party, you know?

1469
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:00,140
We click. She's perfect.

1470
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:02,509
She's beautiful,
she's smart, she's well-read...

1471
01:23:02,556 --> 01:23:04,856
She's got an ass
like a 20-year-old stripper.

1472
01:23:04,892 --> 01:23:06,682
I think, "what's the catch?"

1473
01:23:06,727 --> 01:23:09,897
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

1474
01:23:10,564 --> 01:23:13,614
Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?

1475
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:17,110
She annexed me.
She made me her business.

1476
01:23:17,154 --> 01:23:20,954
It was just too much.
She went out and bought me ties.

1477
01:23:20,991 --> 01:23:23,201
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

1478
01:23:23,243 --> 01:23:26,003
Ties. The whole thing just became...

1479
01:23:26,038 --> 01:23:29,828
- so, you broke up with her.
- No, I just backed away.

1480
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:32,675
Gave her some space. No big deal, right?

1481
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:34,381
So I thought.

1482
01:23:34,421 --> 01:23:36,711
Then one night,
Amy comes over to my place...

1483
01:23:36,757 --> 01:23:39,677
With a bottle of bourbon
and a bootleg of this band I love.

1484
01:23:39,718 --> 01:23:42,718
And within two minutes,
she's got my pants around my ankles...

1485
01:23:42,763 --> 01:23:44,353
And she is kneeling down, and...

1486
01:23:44,389 --> 01:23:46,389
I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.

1487
01:23:46,433 --> 01:23:48,313
- You had sex?
- Yeah, consensual.

1488
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,442
It was rough,
but she was screaming for it.

1489
01:23:50,896 --> 01:23:53,236
Next morning,
there's two cops at my door.

1490
01:23:53,565 --> 01:23:56,485
Amy has wounds
that are consistent with rape.

1491
01:23:56,527 --> 01:23:59,697
Ligature marks on her wrist,
and my semen.

1492
01:23:59,738 --> 01:24:03,408
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed,
and raped her.

1493
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:04,910
Me!

1494
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:06,702
And then, guess what they find.

1495
01:24:06,745 --> 01:24:08,795
Headboards of my bed, one on each side.

1496
01:24:09,206 --> 01:24:10,546
The ties you wouldn't wear.

1497
01:24:10,582 --> 01:24:11,922
You do know your wife.

1498
01:24:12,584 --> 01:24:14,424
- Did you ever see her again?
- Yeah.

1499
01:24:14,461 --> 01:24:15,881
On TV, last week, with you.

1500
01:24:16,463 --> 01:24:17,883
I thought, "there's Amy.

1501
01:24:17,923 --> 01:24:21,933
"She's graduated from being raped
to being murdered."

1502
01:24:25,764 --> 01:24:26,934
You been watching this, too?

1503
01:24:26,974 --> 01:24:28,184
Last night's bombshell.

1504
01:24:28,225 --> 01:24:29,275
We just found out...

1505
01:24:29,309 --> 01:24:32,139
Amy elliott dunne was, indeed,
pregnant when she went missing.

1506
01:24:32,646 --> 01:24:35,616
Kelly capitono,
this makes me wanna throw up.

1507
01:24:35,649 --> 01:24:38,609
What is it about a pregnant woman,
a woman carrying life inside her...

1508
01:24:38,652 --> 01:24:40,112
That turns men into animals?

1509
01:24:40,153 --> 01:24:41,653
Ellen, this is an epidemic.

1510
01:24:41,947 --> 01:24:44,197
The third leading cause of death
among pregnant women...

1511
01:24:44,241 --> 01:24:46,621
Is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband.

1512
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:49,540
Let's not forget about the wife, ever.

1513
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:53,620
Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend,
noelle hawthorne.

1514
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:56,037
Thanks for being on the show, noelle.

1515
01:24:56,086 --> 01:24:57,376
Thank you, Ellen.

1516
01:24:57,421 --> 01:24:58,921
And let me just say this...

1517
01:24:58,964 --> 01:25:02,554
Amy would have loved you,
and all you do for women.

1518
01:25:02,593 --> 01:25:03,633
Oh, that's nice.

1519
01:25:03,677 --> 01:25:05,797
Why don't you tell us
about your friend, noelle?

1520
01:25:05,846 --> 01:25:08,396
Amy was so nurturing.

1521
01:25:08,432 --> 01:25:10,812
Oh, I'd love if just once,
someone was like...

1522
01:25:10,851 --> 01:25:12,141
"She was a real rag."

1523
01:25:14,646 --> 01:25:17,226
She was beautiful and smart and kind.

1524
01:25:17,274 --> 01:25:19,324
Seems like a rich bitch to me.

1525
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:21,989
What do you mean? People love her.

1526
01:25:22,029 --> 01:25:24,449
I don't know. She seems uppity.

1527
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:28,658
Spoiled rich girl,
married a cheating asshole.

1528
01:25:28,702 --> 01:25:29,912
Paid the ultimate price.

1529
01:25:29,953 --> 01:25:33,413
The only secret was her husband.
We never met Nick.

1530
01:25:33,457 --> 01:25:35,077
He never introduced himself.

1531
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:37,505
Why was that, noelle? Why do you think?

1532
01:25:37,544 --> 01:25:38,544
I think we know why.

1533
01:25:39,338 --> 01:25:41,588
Because he had a violent temper.

1534
01:25:41,632 --> 01:25:42,672
A little harsh.

1535
01:25:42,716 --> 01:25:44,296
That's life, baby.

1536
01:25:44,343 --> 01:25:45,903
He knew I'd have
seen right through him.

1537
01:25:46,845 --> 01:25:48,185
Don't get me wrong.

1538
01:25:48,222 --> 01:25:50,102
I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.

1539
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:53,560
I'm just saying, there are consequences.

1540
01:25:55,687 --> 01:25:56,687
Fuck, yeah.

1541
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:59,150
She was so alone.

1542
01:25:59,191 --> 01:26:01,111
And she was so innocent.

1543
01:26:01,151 --> 01:26:04,611
You're a good friend, noelle.
And you're a good friend of the show.

1544
01:26:04,655 --> 01:26:05,865
Thanks for coming on.

1545
01:26:05,906 --> 01:26:07,366
Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt.

1546
01:26:07,407 --> 01:26:09,697
Tanner bolt landed me.

1547
01:26:09,743 --> 01:26:13,043
I'm gonna try and see desi collings
on my way home.

1548
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,040
And, go...

1549
01:26:15,082 --> 01:26:18,252
Tanner's retainer is $100,000.

1550
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:20,170
That's just the retainer.

1551
01:26:20,546 --> 01:26:24,176
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.
I've got $2,500 in an ira.

1552
01:26:24,216 --> 01:26:27,306
I'm approved for a second mortgage
on the house. We will go from there.

1553
01:26:27,344 --> 01:26:29,094
Thank you.

1554
01:26:29,847 --> 01:26:31,507
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1555
01:26:31,557 --> 01:26:34,307
Nick keeps his father,
who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.

1556
01:26:34,351 --> 01:26:36,561
Number of times he visited last year?
One.

1557
01:26:36,603 --> 01:26:37,603
Oh, fuck!

1558
01:26:37,604 --> 01:26:40,314
His twin sister, margo,
well, she is a peach.

1559
01:26:40,357 --> 01:26:42,687
These two spend their days
in the bar Amy bought them.

1560
01:26:43,277 --> 01:26:45,397
Playing what, Lauren? Playing house?

1561
01:26:45,445 --> 01:26:46,575
What the fuck?

1562
01:26:46,613 --> 01:26:49,283
Twin siblings often enable and abet.

1563
01:26:49,783 --> 01:26:51,623
While I never examined Nick,
or his sister...

1564
01:26:52,411 --> 01:26:54,541
They both seem very, very close.

1565
01:26:54,872 --> 01:26:56,122
It's twin-cest.

1566
01:26:56,456 --> 01:26:59,166
Disturbingly close, Lauren.

1567
01:26:59,209 --> 01:27:01,209
And so, we close with a question.

1568
01:27:01,253 --> 01:27:02,753
What kind of moral rot...

1569
01:27:02,796 --> 01:27:07,506
Allows a beautiful, talented,
kind, smart, loving mother...

1570
01:27:07,551 --> 01:27:11,261
To vanish without
the heavens hearing our outraged cries?

1571
01:27:11,305 --> 01:27:12,355
Can I bum a cigarette?

1572
01:27:12,389 --> 01:27:16,139
Amy elliott dunne, we care about you,
and we will not forget.

1573
01:27:16,643 --> 01:27:18,853
And you know what else we won't forget?

1574
01:27:18,896 --> 01:27:21,276
Missouri has the death penalty.

1575
01:27:21,315 --> 01:27:22,485
Amen.

1576
01:27:48,342 --> 01:27:50,632
I'd like to report
some strange activity...

1577
01:27:50,677 --> 01:27:54,177
Near the woodshed
on the property of one margo dunne.

1578
01:28:35,389 --> 01:28:36,849
Hey.

1579
01:28:42,396 --> 01:28:44,526
- Mr. dunne.
- Mr. collings.

1580
01:28:45,524 --> 01:28:48,614
I know you.
I saw you at the volunteer center.

1581
01:28:48,652 --> 01:28:50,362
I wanted to help.

1582
01:28:51,154 --> 01:28:52,864
I hope you don't mind me coming by.

1583
01:28:52,906 --> 01:28:55,986
I got your address from this letter
that you wrote my wife.

1584
01:28:56,869 --> 01:29:00,369
Amy and I believe
in the lost art of letter-writing.

1585
01:29:00,414 --> 01:29:04,254
I always wondered
why you kept in touch after...

1586
01:29:04,918 --> 01:29:06,208
Everything.

1587
01:29:06,253 --> 01:29:08,673
You were together for two years
in boarding school, right?

1588
01:29:08,714 --> 01:29:10,884
She was my first serious girlfriend.

1589
01:29:10,924 --> 01:29:13,724
- Why did you break up?
- That's a strange question.

1590
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,720
Did you treat her bad?
Did you cheat on her?

1591
01:29:15,762 --> 01:29:16,972
That's a rude question.

1592
01:29:17,014 --> 01:29:18,724
Let me tell you what Amy told me.

1593
01:29:18,765 --> 01:29:21,735
She dumped you,
you completely unraveled.

1594
01:29:21,768 --> 01:29:23,848
You stalked her, you threatened her...

1595
01:29:23,896 --> 01:29:27,406
And you attempted suicide in her bed
and were institutionalized.

1596
01:29:27,441 --> 01:29:31,361
Your wife is missing,
and you came all this way to tell me this?

1597
01:29:31,403 --> 01:29:33,613
I thought there might be
another side to this story.

1598
01:29:37,284 --> 01:29:39,124
Mr. collings.

1599
01:29:41,205 --> 01:29:43,125
Fuck.

1600
01:29:48,754 --> 01:29:51,764
...the missing persons case
of Amy elliott dunne.

1601
01:29:51,798 --> 01:29:55,468
She is the beautiful blonde inspiration
for the amazing Amy kids' book series.

1602
01:30:12,653 --> 01:30:14,863
You're reading that diary again?

1603
01:30:14,905 --> 01:30:15,955
You know how it ends.

1604
01:30:15,989 --> 01:30:18,449
It interests me.

1605
01:30:18,492 --> 01:30:20,082
Hey, Rhonda.

1606
01:30:20,118 --> 01:30:22,038
"He's gonna kill me." The end.

1607
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:24,199
Why did he go to his dad's house
to burn it?

1608
01:30:24,248 --> 01:30:25,368
It's private. There's no one there.

1609
01:30:25,415 --> 01:30:28,215
Why didn't he make sure
it actually burned?

1610
01:30:28,252 --> 01:30:31,212
Because he tripped the alarm.
You were up his ass with a flashlight.

1611
01:30:31,255 --> 01:30:33,595
The whole thing just feels hinky.

1612
01:30:33,632 --> 01:30:35,722
Like finding an envelope marked "clue."

1613
01:30:35,759 --> 01:30:36,879
You ever hear the expression...

1614
01:30:36,927 --> 01:30:38,767
"The simplest answer
is often the correct one"?

1615
01:30:39,471 --> 01:30:41,471
Actually, I've never
found that to be true.

1616
01:30:41,515 --> 01:30:43,315
- Good night.
- Good night.

1617
01:30:45,978 --> 01:30:46,978
Hey.

1618
01:30:56,446 --> 01:30:58,316
Elvis is in Missouri.

1619
01:30:58,365 --> 01:31:00,495
Thank God. Come on in.

1620
01:31:00,534 --> 01:31:03,414
First thing you have to understand
about Amy, she loves to teach lessons.

1621
01:31:03,537 --> 01:31:05,997
- Play God.
- Yeah, old testament God.

1622
01:31:06,039 --> 01:31:07,079
Okay. Keep talking.

1623
01:31:07,124 --> 01:31:08,834
She finds out I've been cheating on her
with Andie...

1624
01:31:08,876 --> 01:31:10,466
Decides to teach me a lesson.

1625
01:31:10,502 --> 01:31:12,422
Fakes her own death, frames me for it.

1626
01:31:12,462 --> 01:31:14,672
Blood in the house, credit cards,
life insurance.

1627
01:31:14,715 --> 01:31:15,925
She does the treasure hunt.

1628
01:31:15,966 --> 01:31:17,306
Now, the treasure hunt is critical.

1629
01:31:17,342 --> 01:31:21,012
She's taking us on a tour of my
infidelities. Rubbing my nose in it.

1630
01:31:21,054 --> 01:31:23,104
And she leaves clue number one
for the police...

1631
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:24,850
Which will lead them
back to my office...

1632
01:31:24,892 --> 01:31:27,432
Which is a place
where Andie and I would often...

1633
01:31:27,477 --> 01:31:28,807
And she leaves a pair of red panties.

1634
01:31:28,854 --> 01:31:30,024
Right. Racy, looks bad.

1635
01:31:30,063 --> 01:31:31,773
- Clue two.
- My father's house.

1636
01:31:31,815 --> 01:31:34,195
Another place where Andie and I
would occasionally have relations.

1637
01:31:34,234 --> 01:31:35,614
- Clue three?
- Woodshed.

1638
01:31:35,652 --> 01:31:37,152
- Also a location...
- Oh, my God.

1639
01:31:37,196 --> 01:31:38,956
- We had limited options.
- A hotel.

1640
01:31:38,989 --> 01:31:41,489
- Amy would have seen the credit card bill.
- Put it on Andie's credit card.

1641
01:31:41,533 --> 01:31:42,873
Andie's statement
went right to her parents.

1642
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:45,450
Nick, margo, can we head over
to the little brown house?

1643
01:31:45,496 --> 01:31:47,296
- This leads us to what?
- My dad's house.

1644
01:31:47,331 --> 01:31:49,081
Dad's house is blue.

1645
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:53,425
After the divorce,
when dad wasn't coming around...

1646
01:31:53,754 --> 01:31:58,014
I used to pretend that he was a spy
named Mr. brown, who...

1647
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:01,720
For the sake of his children's safety,
had to deny their existence.

1648
01:32:01,762 --> 01:32:03,182
You never told me that.

1649
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:05,220
You told her that?

1650
01:32:05,265 --> 01:32:07,565
We've got incriminating red panties
in your office.

1651
01:32:07,893 --> 01:32:10,293
We've got a showcase showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed.

1652
01:32:11,396 --> 01:32:14,726
So, what in God's name
is at your father's house, Nick?

1653
01:32:14,775 --> 01:32:15,865
And be honest.

1654
01:32:15,901 --> 01:32:17,741
I honestly have no idea.

1655
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:28,620
Whatever they found, I think it's
safe to assume that it's very bad.

1656
01:32:30,457 --> 01:32:32,707
We got a lot of uncontained issues here.

1657
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,050
Nick, do you have any idea
as to what Andie's mindset is?

1658
01:32:37,256 --> 01:32:39,056
We haven't communicated since the vigil.

1659
01:32:39,091 --> 01:32:40,421
Okay. Amy's parents?

1660
01:32:40,467 --> 01:32:42,047
- No, it's...
- More pressure.

1661
01:32:42,094 --> 01:32:45,354
We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will
no doubt go public at any moment.

1662
01:32:45,389 --> 01:32:46,889
- No, Andie won't do that.
- She will.

1663
01:32:46,932 --> 01:32:48,642
They always do.
Don't take it personally.

1664
01:32:49,142 --> 01:32:51,312
Amy's got us in an interesting bind.

1665
01:32:51,645 --> 01:32:53,945
- We need to tell the cops about Andie.
- Really?

1666
01:32:53,981 --> 01:32:56,151
Right now,
Andie just gives you another motive.

1667
01:32:56,984 --> 01:32:58,154
We need to tell the cops
about the woodshed.

1668
01:32:58,443 --> 01:32:59,863
We need to be on the front end of that.

1669
01:32:59,903 --> 01:33:02,243
But I'm gonna warn you
as to what will happen.

1670
01:33:02,823 --> 01:33:04,033
They'll go after margo.

1671
01:33:04,074 --> 01:33:05,074
They can't do that, can they?

1672
01:33:05,117 --> 01:33:07,027
She's your accomplice.
She helped you hide the evidence.

1673
01:33:07,077 --> 01:33:09,157
In all likelihood,
she knows that you killed Amy.

1674
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,500
God.

1675
01:33:11,832 --> 01:33:13,922
Well, what are we going to do?

1676
01:33:13,959 --> 01:33:14,959
We find Amy.

1677
01:33:15,252 --> 01:33:17,592
No. Any other strategy
is missing the point.

1678
01:33:17,629 --> 01:33:19,959
I've got two ex-secret service guys
that are really good.

1679
01:33:20,007 --> 01:33:21,627
I'll put them on it.

1680
01:33:21,675 --> 01:33:23,095
But where do they start, Nick?

1681
01:33:23,468 --> 01:33:24,588
Where would Amy go?

1682
01:33:26,763 --> 01:33:28,393
I have no idea.

1683
01:33:32,853 --> 01:33:35,483
Are we keeping score?

1684
01:33:36,148 --> 01:33:37,518
Hey!

1685
01:33:39,151 --> 01:33:42,321
I thought we were steering clear
of men for a while.

1686
01:33:42,362 --> 01:33:43,362
He's nice.

1687
01:33:43,363 --> 01:33:45,863
Because he wants to fuck you.

1688
01:33:47,493 --> 01:33:49,033
She's still moping about her ex?

1689
01:33:50,829 --> 01:33:53,499
He got cheated on, too.

1690
01:33:56,877 --> 01:33:59,747
We three are the
saddest sacks in all the ozarks.

1691
01:33:59,796 --> 01:34:01,336
I'm not sad.

1692
01:34:01,882 --> 01:34:02,882
I'm angry.

1693
01:34:02,883 --> 01:34:04,683
There you go.

1694
01:34:04,718 --> 01:34:07,338
I almost drank myself to death
when my wife left me.

1695
01:34:07,387 --> 01:34:09,637
I was gonna kill myself.
Can you believe that?

1696
01:34:09,681 --> 01:34:10,811
Don't give him the pleasure.

1697
01:34:10,849 --> 01:34:13,979
I was going to drown myself
in the Gulf of Mexico...

1698
01:34:14,019 --> 01:34:16,519
Let myself be dinner
for the great whites.

1699
01:34:16,563 --> 01:34:18,363
Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins.

1700
01:34:18,398 --> 01:34:22,318
Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.

1701
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:24,821
Please put that on a t-shirt.

1702
01:34:33,372 --> 01:34:35,752
Miss moneybags.
I thought you said you were broke.

1703
01:34:37,251 --> 01:34:38,541
That's a fat wad.

1704
01:34:40,337 --> 01:34:42,127
It's mostly singles.

1705
01:34:42,172 --> 01:34:44,052
Singles? What are you, a stripper?

1706
01:34:44,842 --> 01:34:47,432
Swamp girls, or treasure chest?

1707
01:34:48,554 --> 01:34:49,604
We're just teasing.

1708
01:34:50,389 --> 01:34:52,179
Don't they tease people down in nola?

1709
01:34:54,601 --> 01:34:57,561
We can expect Nick dunne's arrest
any day now.

1710
01:34:57,604 --> 01:35:01,324
We've got blood in the house,
huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.

1711
01:35:01,358 --> 01:35:05,318
And we have Amy elliott dunne,
missing for five days...

1712
01:35:05,362 --> 01:35:07,492
Crying out for justice.

1713
01:35:08,282 --> 01:35:09,992
We'll be right back.

1714
01:36:02,252 --> 01:36:04,842
Tanner has a very bad idea
he's going to pitch you.

1715
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:05,670
Yeah?

1716
01:36:05,714 --> 01:36:07,304
You're doing Sharon schieber
tomorrow in St. Louis.

1717
01:36:07,341 --> 01:36:08,341
It could go so wrong.

1718
01:36:08,383 --> 01:36:10,133
And you are going
to tell her about Andie.

1719
01:36:10,177 --> 01:36:11,467
Nope.

1720
01:36:11,512 --> 01:36:13,512
That sounds like a very bad idea.

1721
01:36:13,555 --> 01:36:15,645
You haven't heard from her
in three days.

1722
01:36:15,682 --> 01:36:19,392
This is a ticking time bomb.
You've gotta throw yourself on it.

1723
01:36:19,436 --> 01:36:21,976
- People are gonna hate me.
- And then, they will forgive you.

1724
01:36:22,022 --> 01:36:24,482
A guy admitting that he's a
gigantic asshole on television?

1725
01:36:24,525 --> 01:36:26,195
People empathize with that.

1726
01:36:27,611 --> 01:36:29,531
- Why don't we just put out a statement?
- They need to see you.

1727
01:36:29,571 --> 01:36:32,661
Sharon's specials,
they get 10 million viewers.

1728
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:35,199
She is a crusader.
If she takes you on as a cause...

1729
01:36:35,244 --> 01:36:37,164
she's going to ask real questions.

1730
01:36:37,204 --> 01:36:39,044
I will drill you
as if you were doing a deposition.

1731
01:36:39,081 --> 01:36:40,541
What to say, what not to say.

1732
01:36:40,582 --> 01:36:41,712
A trained monkey?

1733
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,870
A trained monkey
who doesn't get the lethal injection.

1734
01:36:45,128 --> 01:36:48,588
Nick, this case
is about what people think of you.

1735
01:36:48,632 --> 01:36:50,382
They need to like you.

1736
01:36:50,425 --> 01:36:54,265
Now, you do this and you will reach
millions of those people.

1737
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:57,930
Maybe I only need to reach one.

1738
01:37:07,401 --> 01:37:08,191
Hello?

1739
01:37:08,235 --> 01:37:09,445
Hey, baby.

1740
01:37:10,904 --> 01:37:12,494
One minute.

1741
01:37:21,248 --> 01:37:22,708
- Hey.
- Hey.

1742
01:37:22,749 --> 01:37:23,749
You clearing out?

1743
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,580
No, I'm just cleaning up.

1744
01:37:25,627 --> 01:37:27,207
Let us come in and say goodbye.

1745
01:37:27,254 --> 01:37:28,304
I'll come by before...

1746
01:37:28,338 --> 01:37:30,088
let us give you a hand.

1747
01:37:36,263 --> 01:37:38,723
Yeah, you gotta
clear everything out, here.

1748
01:37:40,392 --> 01:37:43,102
Dorothy is a real stickler.

1749
01:37:44,438 --> 01:37:47,728
Not even a spare hanger
can you leave behind.

1750
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:51,919
Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.

1751
01:37:54,406 --> 01:37:55,406
A sock...

1752
01:37:56,325 --> 01:37:59,125
Or undies or what have you.

1753
01:38:03,957 --> 01:38:05,287
You did a real good job.

1754
01:38:07,294 --> 01:38:09,424
Where is the money, sweetheart?

1755
01:38:13,091 --> 01:38:14,091
Look under her dress.

1756
01:38:15,636 --> 01:38:16,896
He talked you into this?

1757
01:38:16,929 --> 01:38:18,259
I talked him into it.

1758
01:38:18,305 --> 01:38:20,315
The second you leave,
I'm calling the cops.

1759
01:38:20,807 --> 01:38:24,477
Your glasses are fake.
Your hair's dyed all hamster.

1760
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:27,600
You say your name's Nancy, but you
don't even answer to it half the time.

1761
01:38:27,648 --> 01:38:30,108
You're hiding. I don't know why,
and I don't really care.

1762
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:32,190
But you ain't gonna call the cops.

1763
01:38:32,528 --> 01:38:34,608
And I don't think you've
ever really been hit before.

1764
01:38:40,828 --> 01:38:42,828
Holy shit.

1765
01:38:45,874 --> 01:38:48,674
Sorry, but we really need the money.

1766
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:50,340
Next place, be more careful, okay?

1767
01:38:50,379 --> 01:38:52,739
There are a lot of people out there
a lot worse than we are.

1768
01:39:27,332 --> 01:39:28,962
Excuse me. You can't sleep here.

1769
01:39:56,570 --> 01:39:59,660
I did not kill my wife.

1770
01:40:00,657 --> 01:40:03,947
Why don't you try it again?
A little less wooden.

1771
01:40:03,994 --> 01:40:05,084
I didn't kill my wife.

1772
01:40:06,914 --> 01:40:08,624
- What are you doing?
- Every time you look smug...

1773
01:40:08,665 --> 01:40:11,335
Or annoyed or tense,
I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.

1774
01:40:11,376 --> 01:40:13,336
- That's supposed to make me less tense?
- Let's try it again.

1775
01:40:13,378 --> 01:40:16,668
Mr. dunne, from what I understand,
you and your wife had some bumps.

1776
01:40:17,716 --> 01:40:21,676
Yeah, we had some tough years.
I lost my job.

1777
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,720
You both did.

1778
01:40:25,432 --> 01:40:27,312
We both lost our jobs.

1779
01:40:27,351 --> 01:40:29,891
I had to move back home
so we could take care of my mother...

1780
01:40:29,937 --> 01:40:32,477
Who was dying of cancer
and my dad, who had...

1781
01:40:32,523 --> 01:40:34,273
your dad's scorched earth.

1782
01:40:34,316 --> 01:40:35,986
Let's talk about your mom,
how close you were.

1783
01:40:36,026 --> 01:40:37,186
Go on.

1784
01:40:37,236 --> 01:40:39,746
For a while,
things had been building up.

1785
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:43,280
"Built up" implies that an explosion
is coming. No.

1786
01:40:43,325 --> 01:40:45,745
At a certain point,
we got on the wrong track.

1787
01:40:46,578 --> 01:40:48,198
I had a moment of weakness.

1788
01:40:48,247 --> 01:40:50,657
Your "moment" was over 15 months.

1789
01:40:54,461 --> 01:40:56,551
I disrespected my wife.

1790
01:40:57,214 --> 01:40:59,634
And I disrespected my marriage.

1791
01:41:00,092 --> 01:41:01,472
And I'll always regret it.

1792
01:41:02,219 --> 01:41:03,049
That works.

1793
01:41:03,095 --> 01:41:05,515
Don't be afraid to play up
the dufus husband thing, Nick.

1794
01:41:05,556 --> 01:41:07,266
"I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.

1795
01:41:07,307 --> 01:41:08,137
"Everything I do is wrong."

1796
01:41:08,183 --> 01:41:10,233
I know.
What men are supposed to do in general.

1797
01:41:12,354 --> 01:41:13,404
- Thank you.
- How do you feel?

1798
01:41:13,438 --> 01:41:16,648
I feel good.
Go, can you pass me that box, please?

1799
01:41:17,067 --> 01:41:19,687
It's Amy's 33rd birthday present
to me.

1800
01:41:19,736 --> 01:41:20,736
You hate that watch.

1801
01:41:20,779 --> 01:41:22,859
No, go. I love that watch.

1802
01:41:22,906 --> 01:41:24,906
Just like I love this tie.

1803
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:28,080
Just like I love my wife.

1804
01:41:58,442 --> 01:41:59,822
It's you!

1805
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:01,860
It's you.

1806
01:42:02,696 --> 01:42:04,696
I'm sorry.

1807
01:42:05,365 --> 01:42:06,705
I'm sorry.

1808
01:42:07,618 --> 01:42:09,618
Good God.

1809
01:42:09,661 --> 01:42:11,041
Last week...

1810
01:42:11,538 --> 01:42:16,708
I threatened to leave, and he said
he'd find me and he'd kill me.

1811
01:42:17,044 --> 01:42:19,214
So, I disappeared.

1812
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,210
I lost the baby.

1813
01:42:22,716 --> 01:42:24,506
I couldn't even tell my parents.

1814
01:42:24,551 --> 01:42:28,471
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.

1815
01:42:29,223 --> 01:42:30,393
Well, he is looking for you.

1816
01:42:31,058 --> 01:42:33,018
He showed up on my doorstep
three days ago.

1817
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:35,560
He tracked me from my letters to you.

1818
01:42:36,688 --> 01:42:37,898
You saved them.

1819
01:42:38,482 --> 01:42:39,522
Knowing you were out there...

1820
01:42:39,566 --> 01:42:42,186
Was the only thing that's kept me going
these past few years.

1821
01:42:42,236 --> 01:42:43,616
Let's go to the police.
You can explain everything.

1822
01:42:43,654 --> 01:42:44,954
No, I can't turn up now.

1823
01:42:44,988 --> 01:42:48,068
I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.

1824
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:52,200
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?

1825
01:42:52,246 --> 01:42:54,086
He should go to prison
for what he's done.

1826
01:42:56,917 --> 01:42:59,377
I'm setting you up at my lake house.

1827
01:42:59,419 --> 01:43:00,419
It's utterly secluded.

1828
01:43:01,839 --> 01:43:03,669
Why are you so good to me?

1829
01:43:03,715 --> 01:43:05,055
You know why.

1830
01:43:05,092 --> 01:43:06,222
Excuse me.

1831
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:07,380
I know you, don't I?

1832
01:43:07,427 --> 01:43:08,217
No.

1833
01:43:08,262 --> 01:43:10,222
You're one of the nolan girls, right?

1834
01:43:10,264 --> 01:43:13,144
No, we're from winnipeg. Excuse us.

1835
01:43:13,183 --> 01:43:14,063
We should leave.

1836
01:43:14,101 --> 01:43:15,181
Just a second.

1837
01:43:15,769 --> 01:43:19,019
That was boney. I'll call her later.

1838
01:43:19,064 --> 01:43:20,944
Tanner. Nice to see you.

1839
01:43:21,233 --> 01:43:22,363
Sharon! Hi.

1840
01:43:22,401 --> 01:43:24,071
Hope this is worth my while.

1841
01:43:24,111 --> 01:43:25,241
You're gonna be very happy.

1842
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,496
Sharon.

1843
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:28,740
Ms. schieber.
Thank you so much for doing this.

1844
01:43:28,782 --> 01:43:30,912
Can I get you anything to drink or eat
before we get started?

1845
01:43:30,951 --> 01:43:32,951
No, I had some gummy bears.

1846
01:43:34,037 --> 01:43:35,617
What the fuck?

1847
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:37,920
I'm sorry?

1848
01:43:38,333 --> 01:43:42,213
We have a major shocking development
in the amazing Amy disappearance.

1849
01:43:42,254 --> 01:43:43,634
We go live to that story now.

1850
01:43:43,672 --> 01:43:44,962
Oh, my God.

1851
01:43:47,134 --> 01:43:48,934
You little slut.

1852
01:43:48,969 --> 01:43:51,969
My name is Andie Fitzgerald.

1853
01:43:52,973 --> 01:43:54,643
I met Nicholas dunne...

1854
01:43:54,683 --> 01:43:58,313
When he was my creative writing teacher
at mill valley.

1855
01:43:58,353 --> 01:44:00,443
Why is she dressed like a babysitter?

1856
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,940
I am deeply ashamed...

1857
01:44:01,982 --> 01:44:05,112
Of having been romantically involved
with a married man.

1858
01:44:05,152 --> 01:44:07,072
The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.

1859
01:44:07,112 --> 01:44:09,112
I truly believed we were in love.

1860
01:44:09,156 --> 01:44:10,996
Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite.

1861
01:44:12,493 --> 01:44:13,953
I know that is no excuse.

1862
01:44:13,994 --> 01:44:15,294
No, it is not.

1863
01:44:15,329 --> 01:44:19,669
I do not, in my heart, believe
Nick dunne would have killed for me.

1864
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:22,128
My prayers go out to everyone
who loves Amy.

1865
01:44:22,169 --> 01:44:25,169
I apologize for the pain
this has caused them.

1866
01:44:30,385 --> 01:44:32,345
We have loved Nick dunne like a son.

1867
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:34,560
That love ended today.

1868
01:44:34,848 --> 01:44:36,468
Come on, you're staring at ghosts.

1869
01:44:36,517 --> 01:44:39,177
He met our trust with lie after lie.

1870
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,440
We now absolutely believe...

1871
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,860
Nick is involved in the disappearance
of our daughter.

1872
01:44:43,899 --> 01:44:46,149
Our amazing Amy.

1873
01:44:47,027 --> 01:44:49,147
This just got very exciting.

1874
01:44:49,863 --> 01:44:51,573
We need a moment.

1875
01:44:53,575 --> 01:44:55,335
We're gonna have to bow out of this.

1876
01:44:55,369 --> 01:44:57,169
- Nothing has changed.
- Everything has changed.

1877
01:44:57,204 --> 01:44:59,624
An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?

1878
01:44:59,665 --> 01:45:01,305
- I can handle this.
- We're on the defense.

1879
01:45:01,333 --> 01:45:03,383
This is a completely different dynamic.

1880
01:45:03,418 --> 01:45:06,168
- I can handle it.
- She's going to eat you alive.

1881
01:45:06,713 --> 01:45:08,383
Just trust me.

1882
01:45:12,761 --> 01:45:14,141
Okay.

1883
01:45:14,179 --> 01:45:15,259
Great.

1884
01:45:16,098 --> 01:45:17,558
Mic him.

1885
01:45:37,286 --> 01:45:39,086
One, two, three, four, five.

1886
01:45:45,419 --> 01:45:46,419
Thank you.

1887
01:45:47,588 --> 01:45:48,878
He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.

1888
01:45:48,922 --> 01:45:49,922
Yeah, no kidding.

1889
01:45:54,595 --> 01:45:57,725
Roll tape. Five... four...

1890
01:45:57,764 --> 01:45:59,394
Three... two...

1891
01:46:01,602 --> 01:46:04,522
Seriously, I can't believe
how fucking good you were.

1892
01:46:04,563 --> 01:46:06,023
- Amy brings out the best in me.
- Don't.

1893
01:46:06,064 --> 01:46:09,234
Keep it together, you two.
At least for the next 24 hours.

1894
01:46:09,276 --> 01:46:11,696
People still hate you.
Women want to scratch your eyes out.

1895
01:46:11,737 --> 01:46:13,607
Andie was really good TV.

1896
01:46:13,655 --> 01:46:15,705
- She's a good person.
- Therein lies the problem.

1897
01:46:15,741 --> 01:46:16,741
Ride this out...

1898
01:46:16,783 --> 01:46:19,793
And when Sharon airs tomorrow,
we'll be looking at a whole new you.

1899
01:46:19,828 --> 01:46:21,408
But, until then...

1900
01:46:21,455 --> 01:46:23,415
Don't show your face.

1901
01:46:23,457 --> 01:46:25,287
No problem.

1902
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,980
Welcome.

1903
01:46:44,978 --> 01:46:46,808
Make yourself at home.

1904
01:46:46,855 --> 01:46:50,825
I've got music, satellite...

1905
01:46:50,859 --> 01:46:51,859
Netflix.

1906
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:52,940
He was her teacher!

1907
01:46:52,986 --> 01:46:53,986
Roku.

1908
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:57,030
Internet, obviously.

1909
01:46:57,616 --> 01:47:00,336
Here is a supposedly grown man...

1910
01:47:00,369 --> 01:47:04,159
if there is ever anything you have
a taste for and you can't find it...

1911
01:47:04,206 --> 01:47:06,466
Just let me know
and I will get it for you.

1912
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:09,630
Instead of the a-b-c's,
he taught her the birds and the bees.

1913
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:12,590
And just think how her mother must feel
at a time like this.

1914
01:47:12,631 --> 01:47:14,631
Wine cellar's downstairs.

1915
01:47:18,095 --> 01:47:19,475
I'll get you some clothes, too.

1916
01:47:19,513 --> 01:47:22,933
Not that I don't appreciate
bait shop chic.

1917
01:47:24,101 --> 01:47:26,601
The floors are heated,
just dial to your liking.

1918
01:47:26,645 --> 01:47:29,815
There's robes and towels.
The shower has steam.

1919
01:47:29,857 --> 01:47:32,187
The bathtub has a massage cycle.

1920
01:47:34,027 --> 01:47:36,067
There's a great view,
if you're in the mood.

1921
01:47:36,113 --> 01:47:37,653
Blackout curtains if you're not.

1922
01:47:37,698 --> 01:47:40,158
The bed is savoir.

1923
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,450
You'll never get a better sleep.

1924
01:47:46,331 --> 01:47:48,671
This is just what I need.

1925
01:47:50,127 --> 01:47:52,037
I'm so exhausted.

1926
01:47:53,547 --> 01:47:55,707
I'll leave you to it, then.

1927
01:47:57,467 --> 01:48:00,217
Amy, I am so happy that you are here.

1928
01:48:01,221 --> 01:48:04,351
And I don't want you to worry
for one moment.

1929
01:48:04,391 --> 01:48:06,351
There are cameras everywhere.

1930
01:48:06,393 --> 01:48:09,273
The exterior, all along the grounds,
the entryway.

1931
01:48:09,313 --> 01:48:10,313
Anyone...

1932
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,730
Who is caught coming or going...

1933
01:48:15,986 --> 01:48:17,576
Will be recorded.

1934
01:48:19,156 --> 01:48:21,876
You are more than safe.

1935
01:48:23,827 --> 01:48:27,327
And I am not letting you get away again.

1936
01:49:13,085 --> 01:49:14,675
- Good morning!
- Don't do that!

1937
01:49:16,421 --> 01:49:17,551
I'm sorry.

1938
01:49:19,550 --> 01:49:21,050
I need to feel safe.

1939
01:49:21,385 --> 01:49:24,395
You are very safe.

1940
01:49:26,598 --> 01:49:28,218
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

1941
01:49:28,267 --> 01:49:30,977
Amy, I'm not Nick.

1942
01:49:31,019 --> 01:49:33,019
It's hard for me.

1943
01:49:35,941 --> 01:49:39,571
After so many years
under someone's thumb...

1944
01:49:41,822 --> 01:49:43,142
I know just what that feels like.

1945
01:49:44,032 --> 01:49:46,032
You were never under my thumb.

1946
01:49:46,618 --> 01:49:48,658
- On your leash.
- Never.

1947
01:49:48,704 --> 01:49:50,204
A new start.

1948
01:49:51,498 --> 01:49:53,118
Decent clothes.

1949
01:49:54,042 --> 01:49:56,292
Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.

1950
01:49:56,587 --> 01:49:58,087
There's a gym overlooking the lake.

1951
01:49:58,463 --> 01:50:02,013
The sooner you look like yourself,
the sooner you'll feel like yourself.

1952
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:05,180
I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch
Sharon schieber, and finally move on.

1953
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:07,760
I think that's something
I should watch on my own.

1954
01:50:08,182 --> 01:50:09,892
Nonsense.

1955
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:14,940
I'll be back.

1956
01:50:16,565 --> 01:50:18,735
And I am looking forward...

1957
01:50:18,775 --> 01:50:21,695
To my reunion with Amy elliott.

1958
01:50:44,885 --> 01:50:46,055
Great.

1959
01:50:47,095 --> 01:50:49,185
Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber.

1960
01:50:49,223 --> 01:50:50,853
- Tonight, exclusively...
- Hurry up.

1961
01:50:51,767 --> 01:50:56,147
A husband breaks his silence,
not just on his wife's disappearance...

1962
01:50:56,188 --> 01:50:59,978
But on his infidelity,
and all those shocking rumors.

1963
01:51:02,444 --> 01:51:03,994
Nick dunne...

1964
01:51:04,029 --> 01:51:07,529
You're probably the most hated man
in America right now.

1965
01:51:07,574 --> 01:51:10,164
I probably am.
And I probably deserve it.

1966
01:51:10,202 --> 01:51:11,792
I bought that tie.

1967
01:51:11,829 --> 01:51:13,869
Did you kill your wife, Nick?

1968
01:51:13,914 --> 01:51:17,004
I did not kill my wife.

1969
01:51:17,668 --> 01:51:19,208
I am not a murderer.

1970
01:51:19,253 --> 01:51:21,173
But you were unfaithful.

1971
01:51:21,213 --> 01:51:23,423
I was unfaithful.

1972
01:51:23,465 --> 01:51:25,135
And I am deeply ashamed.

1973
01:51:25,175 --> 01:51:27,515
And, on top of that,
you allowed Amy's parents...

1974
01:51:27,803 --> 01:51:30,553
Her friends,
all the people in your hometown...

1975
01:51:30,597 --> 01:51:35,517
Believe you were a loving husband,
desperate to find his missing wife.

1976
01:51:35,561 --> 01:51:37,441
Well, I am desperate
to find my missing wife.

1977
01:51:37,479 --> 01:51:40,479
You say that, but I'm wondering
how you expect us to believe you...

1978
01:51:40,524 --> 01:51:42,234
Now that we know you're a liar.

1979
01:51:42,526 --> 01:51:45,656
I didn't come forward with my affair...

1980
01:51:45,696 --> 01:51:48,866
Because I knew it would make me look
really, really bad.

1981
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:51,490
But I don't care about that anymore.

1982
01:51:51,535 --> 01:51:53,165
I just want to find my wife.

1983
01:51:53,203 --> 01:51:55,753
- I'm just trying to get clear...
- let me be clear.

1984
01:51:55,789 --> 01:52:00,209
Just because I am not a murderer
doesn't make me a good guy.

1985
01:52:00,252 --> 01:52:01,422
I'm not a good guy.

1986
01:52:01,837 --> 01:52:04,297
I was a bad husband to a great wife.

1987
01:52:04,673 --> 01:52:06,423
I broke the vow that I made to her.

1988
01:52:06,675 --> 01:52:09,225
Those are pretty words, Nick.

1989
01:52:09,553 --> 01:52:11,303
But what does that really mean to you?

1990
01:52:11,346 --> 01:52:13,386
It basically means
that I was a con artist.

1991
01:52:14,349 --> 01:52:17,559
I met Amy elliott seven years ago.

1992
01:52:17,603 --> 01:52:19,193
I was completely transfixed.

1993
01:52:19,646 --> 01:52:21,556
Amy can do that to you.

1994
01:52:21,607 --> 01:52:24,147
I was this average guy
from an average place...

1995
01:52:24,193 --> 01:52:26,193
With mediocre aspirations.

1996
01:52:26,236 --> 01:52:28,736
And I met a woman who dazzled me.

1997
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:30,740
And I wanted her to love me...

1998
01:52:30,782 --> 01:52:33,122
So I pretended to be better than I was.

1999
01:52:33,994 --> 01:52:37,664
When we got married,
I promised to be that guy.

2000
01:52:37,706 --> 01:52:39,536
That guy who works harder.

2001
01:52:39,583 --> 01:52:41,793
That guy who, who lives and acts...

2002
01:52:41,835 --> 01:52:44,755
And loves with as much passion
as she does.

2003
01:52:45,005 --> 01:52:46,215
But I failed her.

2004
01:52:47,132 --> 01:52:48,492
Instead of doing what was right...

2005
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:50,930
I did what was easy.

2006
01:52:51,678 --> 01:52:55,308
You talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife.

2007
01:52:55,349 --> 01:52:56,969
Who believes his wife is still alive.

2008
01:52:57,017 --> 01:52:58,307
She is still alive.

2009
01:53:00,187 --> 01:53:03,017
Will you look at that camera for me?

2010
01:53:03,357 --> 01:53:06,317
Will you look in the lens...

2011
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:08,320
And talk to your wife?

2012
01:53:08,362 --> 01:53:11,452
If she is out there,
able to hear and see you tonight...

2013
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:14,160
What would you like to say to her, Nick?

2014
01:53:17,704 --> 01:53:20,004
Amy, I love you.

2015
01:53:20,707 --> 01:53:23,497
You're the best person I've ever known.

2016
01:53:23,544 --> 01:53:28,014
And I've taken myself to the woodshed
for the way that I've treated you.

2017
01:53:28,048 --> 01:53:30,008
And if you come back, I promise...

2018
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:32,550
I will spend every day
making it up to you.

2019
01:53:33,053 --> 01:53:36,893
I will be the man
that I promised you I would be.

2020
01:53:39,476 --> 01:53:40,476
I love you.

2021
01:53:41,395 --> 01:53:42,985
Come home.

2022
01:53:47,734 --> 01:53:48,734
Here.

2023
01:53:54,867 --> 01:53:56,487
Regardless of what you thought...

2024
01:53:56,535 --> 01:53:58,705
What does it say?

2025
01:53:58,745 --> 01:54:00,295
...I think we can all agree...

2026
01:54:00,330 --> 01:54:01,830
Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.

2027
01:54:01,874 --> 01:54:03,044
...there's more to him
than meets the eye.

2028
01:54:03,083 --> 01:54:04,203
They're going crazy for you.

2029
01:54:04,209 --> 01:54:08,709
They disliked me, they liked me,
they hated me.

2030
01:54:08,755 --> 01:54:10,385
And now they love me.

2031
01:54:10,424 --> 01:54:13,384
...a candor and an honesty
that's worthy of respect.

2032
01:54:13,427 --> 01:54:15,337
He's certainly earned mine.

2033
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:17,260
What is it?

2034
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:23,270
I'm Sharon schieber. Good night.

2035
01:54:28,192 --> 01:54:30,982
Margo dunne, this is a search warrant
for your property.

2036
01:54:31,028 --> 01:54:33,238
I usually ignore tipline calls...

2037
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:37,870
But a neighbor was concerned about
a strange man around your woodshed.

2038
01:54:38,285 --> 01:54:39,285
Call Tanner.

2039
01:54:39,286 --> 01:54:40,456
Okay. Fuck!

2040
01:54:44,583 --> 01:54:46,043
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.

2041
01:54:47,294 --> 01:54:48,374
Is that what this is about?

2042
01:54:49,796 --> 01:54:54,546
I have treated you more than fair
throughout this entire investigation.

2043
01:54:54,593 --> 01:54:56,893
I gave you the benefit of the doubt
over and over.

2044
01:54:56,929 --> 01:54:58,429
Every time you said something stupid...

2045
01:54:58,472 --> 01:55:00,852
I thought, "maybe he's just stupid."

2046
01:55:00,891 --> 01:55:03,431
But I was wrong.
That's what this is about.

2047
01:55:03,477 --> 01:55:04,597
Are these the clubs
you don't play golf with?

2048
01:55:04,645 --> 01:55:05,645
None of that is mine.

2049
01:55:05,938 --> 01:55:07,518
None of this was put here by me.

2050
01:55:07,564 --> 01:55:11,114
Those are nice clubs.
You got the makings of a real man cave.

2051
01:55:11,151 --> 01:55:14,281
Everything just waiting
until the wife goes away for good.

2052
01:55:14,321 --> 01:55:15,401
Nick!

2053
01:55:16,657 --> 01:55:19,577
- You can't do that!
- Of course we can.

2054
01:55:27,876 --> 01:55:30,456
Amy, it's time to move on.

2055
01:55:30,504 --> 01:55:32,214
What can I do to help?

2056
01:55:32,923 --> 01:55:34,473
I need some time to think.

2057
01:55:34,508 --> 01:55:37,008
- That's the last thing you need.
- Desi...

2058
01:55:37,052 --> 01:55:39,642
twenty years,
you have kept me dangling.

2059
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:43,350
Finally, last night, you came to me,
and you chose me.

2060
01:55:44,059 --> 01:55:45,389
Follow that instinct.

2061
01:55:45,435 --> 01:55:47,855
Don't trust the instinct
that left you beaten and homeless...

2062
01:55:48,397 --> 01:55:51,567
Sleeping in your car,
fearing for your life.

2063
01:55:54,903 --> 01:55:57,613
I'm not gonna force myself on you.

2064
01:56:00,033 --> 01:56:02,703
I understand what you're saying, desi.

2065
01:56:03,954 --> 01:56:05,584
I do.

2066
01:56:08,917 --> 01:56:10,917
I've been so mistreated for so long.

2067
01:56:13,589 --> 01:56:16,469
I've forgotten how to behave.

2068
01:56:22,222 --> 01:56:24,522
I'll move in here tomorrow...

2069
01:56:24,558 --> 01:56:27,138
And we'll work it out together.

2070
01:56:29,229 --> 01:56:32,939
I just want you to be you again.

2071
01:56:40,782 --> 01:56:42,302
They only took margo to fuck with you.

2072
01:56:42,326 --> 01:56:44,036
She's not spending
another fucking second in there.

2073
01:56:44,077 --> 01:56:46,827
I'm gonna go in,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

2074
01:56:47,498 --> 01:56:49,248
What?

2075
01:56:51,251 --> 01:56:52,881
We tell boney very little.

2076
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:55,050
Without a body,
without a murder weapon...

2077
01:56:55,088 --> 01:56:57,378
Their only hope is a confession.

2078
01:56:57,424 --> 01:56:59,384
So, you let them do all the talking.

2079
01:56:59,426 --> 01:57:01,546
That way,
we can jump-start your defense.

2080
01:57:01,595 --> 01:57:03,975
The truth is my defense.

2081
01:57:09,937 --> 01:57:10,937
Recognize these?

2082
01:57:10,938 --> 01:57:13,058
Yes.
It's Amy's anniversary present to me.

2083
01:57:13,106 --> 01:57:14,896
Was that how she told you
she was pregnant, Nick?

2084
01:57:14,942 --> 01:57:17,442
Mommy, daddy, baby,
and that made you real mad?

2085
01:57:17,945 --> 01:57:19,115
No.

2086
01:57:20,364 --> 01:57:22,484
- Recognize this?
- Never seen that before in my life.

2087
01:57:22,699 --> 01:57:25,949
It's Amy's diary.
We found this at your father's house.

2088
01:57:27,955 --> 01:57:29,255
Is this your wife's handwriting?

2089
01:57:29,289 --> 01:57:31,289
- He's not a handwriting ex...
- looks like it.

2090
01:57:31,333 --> 01:57:32,463
Our experts thought so, too.

2091
01:57:33,794 --> 01:57:35,504
Do you wanna
play a little true or false?

2092
01:57:36,255 --> 01:57:37,465
Sure.

2093
01:57:37,506 --> 01:57:41,976
"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips
so he can taste me."

2094
01:57:43,095 --> 01:57:45,105
Yeah, that's true.

2095
01:57:46,348 --> 01:57:48,348
You thought quinoa was a fish?

2096
01:57:49,643 --> 01:57:50,983
That is also true, yes.

2097
01:57:53,146 --> 01:57:55,266
She wanted to get pregnant,
you assaulted her.

2098
01:57:55,315 --> 01:57:57,325
I hit her? No, never happened.

2099
01:57:57,359 --> 01:57:58,979
- "Pushed," it says "pushed."
- Absolutely not.

2100
01:57:59,027 --> 01:58:00,107
I never touched her.

2101
01:58:02,531 --> 01:58:04,161
She tried to buy a gun.

2102
01:58:04,825 --> 01:58:06,705
I doubt that, but I don't know.

2103
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:09,750
Shall I read the last entry?

2104
01:58:09,788 --> 01:58:10,828
Sure.

2105
01:58:12,124 --> 01:58:14,254
"This man may kill me."

2106
01:58:14,293 --> 01:58:16,503
In her own words,
"this man may kill me."

2107
01:58:16,545 --> 01:58:18,675
It's kind of a convenient end note.

2108
01:58:25,179 --> 01:58:26,599
For future reference...

2109
01:58:26,638 --> 01:58:28,968
The truth,
you are not a handwriting expert.

2110
01:58:29,016 --> 01:58:30,066
Okay, I know.

2111
01:58:38,483 --> 01:58:40,323
Judy's missing handle.

2112
01:58:41,862 --> 01:58:44,152
Big as a two-by-four, right?
Big as a club.

2113
01:58:44,198 --> 01:58:46,948
We found this day one,
in the fireplace in your home office.

2114
01:58:46,992 --> 01:58:49,662
We didn't know what the hell it was,
but fire in July?

2115
01:58:49,703 --> 01:58:50,543
We bagged it.

2116
01:58:50,579 --> 01:58:51,699
I've never seen that before either.

2117
01:58:51,747 --> 01:58:54,367
We just tested it.
Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.

2118
01:58:54,416 --> 01:58:56,626
So, finally, Nicholas dunne...

2119
01:58:56,668 --> 01:58:58,288
You're under arrest
for the murder of your wife.

2120
01:58:58,337 --> 01:58:59,547
Do not say another word.

2121
01:58:59,588 --> 01:59:00,918
- What about my side?
- Nick!

2122
01:59:14,269 --> 01:59:15,729
More coffee?

2123
01:59:15,771 --> 01:59:17,561
I'd love it.

2124
01:59:19,858 --> 01:59:23,488
Remember that time we skipped school
and drove to the cape?

2125
01:59:23,529 --> 01:59:26,069
God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.

2126
01:59:26,114 --> 01:59:27,744
This reminds me of that.

2127
01:59:28,242 --> 01:59:29,912
Never-ending holiday.

2128
01:59:31,453 --> 01:59:33,663
You're not bored?

2129
01:59:33,705 --> 01:59:35,215
Desi, how could I be bored?

2130
01:59:35,249 --> 01:59:37,709
You can discuss
18th-century symphonies...

2131
01:59:37,751 --> 01:59:40,671
19th-century impressionists,
quote proust in French.

2132
01:59:41,046 --> 01:59:45,166
Nick's idea of culture
was a reality TV marathon...

2133
01:59:45,217 --> 01:59:47,087
With one hand down his boxers.

2134
01:59:49,096 --> 01:59:50,686
I really have to get going.

2135
01:59:51,014 --> 01:59:54,354
But I will be back
just as soon as I can.

2136
02:00:00,941 --> 02:00:02,021
My keys.

2137
02:00:07,239 --> 02:00:09,239
Thank you.

2138
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:22,040
That's how the kids wear it.

2139
02:01:22,856 --> 02:01:26,686
Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.

2140
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:30,700
Hey.

2141
02:01:31,114 --> 02:01:33,494
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Are you?

2142
02:01:33,534 --> 02:01:34,784
Yeah.

2143
02:01:34,827 --> 02:01:36,697
Let's go.

2144
02:01:38,539 --> 02:01:39,749
What does this mean?

2145
02:01:39,790 --> 02:01:41,960
Well, you're out on bond.

2146
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,210
You can relax at home
while we prep for trial.

2147
02:01:50,717 --> 02:01:52,717
Keep your head down.

2148
02:02:08,151 --> 02:02:10,531
Tanner, is there
any fucking lead on Amy?

2149
02:02:10,571 --> 02:02:12,571
I've got two of my best guys on it.

2150
02:02:13,073 --> 02:02:14,703
She's air.

2151
02:02:16,743 --> 02:02:19,703
Come home, Amy. I dare you.

2152
02:03:16,929 --> 02:03:19,469
Mr. collings is home.

2153
02:03:19,515 --> 02:03:21,895
Hello, Mr. collings.

2154
02:03:21,934 --> 02:03:23,814
I've missed you.

2155
02:03:23,852 --> 02:03:25,482
I've been thinking...

2156
02:03:25,938 --> 02:03:28,108
I don't wanna be without you.

2157
02:03:28,815 --> 02:03:31,155
Stay with me.

2158
02:03:31,193 --> 02:03:34,153
And when all this dies down,
we'll go to Greece, like you said.

2159
02:03:34,196 --> 02:03:36,496
Octopus and scrabble?

2160
02:03:38,492 --> 02:03:40,742
How long do you think until it's done?

2161
02:03:40,786 --> 02:03:44,376
Not long. Six months for the trial.
Sentencing will be quick.

2162
02:03:44,873 --> 02:03:45,963
He'll appeal.

2163
02:03:45,999 --> 02:03:48,129
I can watch the rest overseas.

2164
02:04:05,519 --> 02:04:06,809
Go slowly.

2165
02:04:06,854 --> 02:04:07,854
But I want it.

2166
02:04:28,208 --> 02:04:29,788
Don't rush.

2167
02:04:29,835 --> 02:04:31,925
Just do it.

2168
02:04:40,387 --> 02:04:41,927
Harder.

2169
02:06:20,487 --> 02:06:23,657
You fucking bitch.

2170
02:06:32,332 --> 02:06:36,002
Don't you worry,
you're gonna have lots of babies.

2171
02:06:37,629 --> 02:06:41,129
Her wounds are consistent with rape.
There was semen present.

2172
02:06:41,175 --> 02:06:42,335
We'll make sure it's a match.

2173
02:06:42,342 --> 02:06:44,092
Yeah, it'll match.

2174
02:06:44,136 --> 02:06:46,606
Thank you very much.

2175
02:06:46,638 --> 02:06:48,138
What do you think?

2176
02:06:48,182 --> 02:06:49,472
Are we pals again?

2177
02:06:49,516 --> 02:06:53,056
Now that I know
you didn't murder your wife, yes.

2178
02:06:53,103 --> 02:06:54,103
What do you think?

2179
02:06:54,104 --> 02:06:57,024
Kidnapping? The story's insane.

2180
02:06:59,193 --> 02:07:01,653
She's on fairly heavy painkillers.

2181
02:07:01,695 --> 02:07:03,615
It's okay. I want to help.

2182
02:07:03,655 --> 02:07:05,075
Ms. dunne, I know
what you've been through...

2183
02:07:05,115 --> 02:07:07,455
So we'll keep this very brief.

2184
02:07:07,493 --> 02:07:09,873
Can you walk us through what happened?

2185
02:07:12,498 --> 02:07:15,118
That morning, the doorbell rang.

2186
02:07:16,001 --> 02:07:18,001
So normal.

2187
02:07:18,045 --> 02:07:19,885
I opened the door.

2188
02:07:20,506 --> 02:07:22,346
So strange.

2189
02:07:22,966 --> 02:07:26,586
Since high school,
he won't ever go away.

2190
02:07:26,637 --> 02:07:29,717
And I've just tried to be nice to him.

2191
02:07:29,765 --> 02:07:31,395
Answer his letters.

2192
02:07:31,642 --> 02:07:33,642
Keep him calm.

2193
02:07:35,062 --> 02:07:36,522
Oh, my God.

2194
02:07:37,147 --> 02:07:38,767
I've encouraged him.

2195
02:07:38,815 --> 02:07:40,615
You can't blame yourself.

2196
02:07:42,236 --> 02:07:44,406
He pushed inside.

2197
02:07:45,989 --> 02:07:48,029
And he grabbed me.

2198
02:07:48,742 --> 02:07:51,832
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.

2199
02:07:52,162 --> 02:07:53,872
And he clubbed me.

2200
02:07:54,331 --> 02:07:55,751
I collapsed.

2201
02:07:55,791 --> 02:07:59,841
That club was actually the handle
to a punch and Judy puppet.

2202
02:07:59,878 --> 02:08:01,298
Right.

2203
02:08:02,214 --> 02:08:03,634
Treasure hunt.

2204
02:08:05,551 --> 02:08:07,591
I'd hidden some puppets at go's...

2205
02:08:07,636 --> 02:08:09,356
then how did desi have that handle?

2206
02:08:11,223 --> 02:08:13,143
I'd just found it.

2207
02:08:13,892 --> 02:08:16,312
It must have fallen off.

2208
02:08:18,230 --> 02:08:21,900
I was holding it when desi pushed in.
So, he got it from me.

2209
02:08:21,942 --> 02:08:23,152
About that woodshed...

2210
02:08:23,193 --> 02:08:24,863
He took me to his lake house.

2211
02:08:25,445 --> 02:08:27,155
Tied me to his bed.

2212
02:08:27,197 --> 02:08:29,737
Back to the woodshed real quick.
Real quick.

2213
02:08:29,783 --> 02:08:31,623
When you went
to place the puppets there...

2214
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:33,060
Did you notice that it was packed...

2215
02:08:33,078 --> 02:08:34,238
lots of stuff.

2216
02:08:34,288 --> 02:08:38,708
Corresponding to purchases made
on credit cards in your husband's name.

2217
02:08:38,750 --> 02:08:40,250
Nick and credit cards.

2218
02:08:40,294 --> 02:08:42,844
He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.

2219
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:45,670
He hid a lot of stuff at go's.
They're very close.

2220
02:08:46,216 --> 02:08:50,546
Now, may I go back
to where I was being held prisoner...

2221
02:08:50,596 --> 02:08:53,356
By a man with a history
of mental problems?

2222
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:54,470
Please continue, Ms. dunne.

2223
02:08:58,770 --> 02:09:00,850
Desi assaulted me that night.

2224
02:09:01,815 --> 02:09:03,655
Every night.

2225
02:09:04,776 --> 02:09:07,186
He tied me up like a dog.

2226
02:09:08,572 --> 02:09:11,072
And then, he'd punish me.

2227
02:09:12,993 --> 02:09:15,043
Starve me.

2228
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:18,250
Shave me.

2229
02:09:19,875 --> 02:09:21,835
Sodomize me.

2230
02:09:22,628 --> 02:09:24,458
There were cameras everywhere.

2231
02:09:24,505 --> 02:09:27,465
Please find this. Please find the tapes.

2232
02:09:29,134 --> 02:09:32,344
She slit his throat with a box cutter.

2233
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:35,640
How did she manage
to get a hold of a box cutter...

2234
02:09:35,682 --> 02:09:38,272
If he had her tied up the whole time?

2235
02:09:39,228 --> 02:09:41,268
Can't you just be happy
your wife is home and safe?

2236
02:09:42,064 --> 02:09:44,024
Amy, we found your diary.

2237
02:09:44,066 --> 02:09:48,156
It contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse.

2238
02:09:48,195 --> 02:09:51,075
Well, it's the ugly truth.

2239
02:09:51,907 --> 02:09:53,407
Nick didn't want a baby.

2240
02:09:55,244 --> 02:09:58,544
He has a temper. We had money problems.

2241
02:09:59,456 --> 02:10:00,576
But I love him.

2242
02:10:00,624 --> 02:10:02,374
Then why did you try to buy a gun?

2243
02:10:04,336 --> 02:10:06,416
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.

2244
02:10:06,463 --> 02:10:08,303
If I could just clarify one thing...

2245
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:11,550
if this case had been left
in your deeply incompetent hands...

2246
02:10:11,593 --> 02:10:13,473
My husband would be on death row...

2247
02:10:13,762 --> 02:10:17,512
And I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...

2248
02:10:17,808 --> 02:10:21,478
Ms. dunne, you've been very brave.
We're finished.

2249
02:10:22,354 --> 02:10:24,524
Now, I have to ask you...

2250
02:10:24,565 --> 02:10:27,405
Do you feel safe
going home with your husband?

2251
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:42,460
We prayed to God,
and God has answered our prayers.

2252
02:10:42,499 --> 02:10:43,869
Amy dunne is home.

2253
02:10:43,917 --> 02:10:45,997
Now, I know there are
a lot of questions and concerns...

2254
02:10:46,044 --> 02:10:48,054
But for right now, we wanna sit tight...

2255
02:10:48,088 --> 02:10:53,008
And just be thankful and grateful
for this miracle on the Mississippi.

2256
02:11:00,475 --> 02:11:02,275
Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.

2257
02:11:54,029 --> 02:11:55,239
We love you, Amy!

2258
02:11:59,868 --> 02:12:01,698
All right, you can stop pretending now.

2259
02:12:01,745 --> 02:12:03,415
I'm not pretending.

2260
02:12:04,122 --> 02:12:05,832
You were perfect.

2261
02:12:06,458 --> 02:12:08,998
The Nick I saw on TV,
that's the Nick I fell in love with.

2262
02:12:09,044 --> 02:12:11,754
You do know I was just telling you
what you wanted to hear, right?

2263
02:12:11,797 --> 02:12:13,627
That's how well you know me.

2264
02:12:13,674 --> 02:12:16,304
You know me in your marrow.

2265
02:12:17,302 --> 02:12:18,892
Okay.

2266
02:12:18,929 --> 02:12:22,259
You need to tell me
exactly what happened.

2267
02:12:23,559 --> 02:12:24,809
Take off your clothes.

2268
02:12:25,310 --> 02:12:28,520
I need to make sure
you're not wearing a wire.

2269
02:12:41,827 --> 02:12:45,827
You killed someone, Amy.
You're a murderer.

2270
02:12:45,873 --> 02:12:47,463
I'm a fighter.

2271
02:12:47,499 --> 02:12:49,959
I fought my way back to you.

2272
02:12:50,002 --> 02:12:51,842
You killed a guy.

2273
02:12:51,879 --> 02:12:53,839
You slashed his throat
with a box cutter.

2274
02:12:53,881 --> 02:12:58,551
You went on national television
and begged for me to save your life.

2275
02:12:59,136 --> 02:13:00,396
And I obliged.

2276
02:13:00,429 --> 02:13:01,889
But I want that Nick.

2277
02:13:02,222 --> 02:13:03,642
I'm leaving.

2278
02:13:03,682 --> 02:13:06,312
You really think that's smart?

2279
02:13:06,977 --> 02:13:07,977
Shampoo.

2280
02:13:10,689 --> 02:13:14,609
Wounded, raped wife battles her way
back to her husband...

2281
02:13:14,651 --> 02:13:16,531
And he deserts her.

2282
02:13:16,570 --> 02:13:17,610
They'll destroy you.

2283
02:13:18,363 --> 02:13:19,863
Neighbors will shun you.

2284
02:13:19,907 --> 02:13:24,117
And I'll make sure that no one forgets
the pain you caused me.

2285
02:13:26,205 --> 02:13:31,295
I don't want anything to do
with your groupies outside.

2286
02:13:31,877 --> 02:13:33,497
Once they go...

2287
02:13:34,379 --> 02:13:35,299
I go.

2288
02:13:35,339 --> 02:13:38,759
Give it the night. Sleep on it.

2289
02:13:55,609 --> 02:13:57,189
Was there ever a baby?

2290
02:13:57,486 --> 02:13:59,576
There can be.

2291
02:14:03,575 --> 02:14:04,585
Good night.

2292
02:14:57,504 --> 02:14:59,174
Hey, Nick!

2293
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:12,560
Hello, handsome.

2294
02:15:15,689 --> 02:15:17,439
Crepe?

2295
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:19,070
Sure.

2296
02:15:19,109 --> 02:15:20,819
She was his dream girl.

2297
02:15:20,861 --> 02:15:24,281
And when this spoiled, rich,
entitled little boy couldn't have her...

2298
02:15:24,323 --> 02:15:25,703
He took her.

2299
02:15:33,081 --> 02:15:34,421
You must be so proud.

2300
02:15:41,673 --> 02:15:43,673
It's been four hours.

2301
02:15:44,176 --> 02:15:47,016
Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?

2302
02:15:51,183 --> 02:15:54,023
Right now, it's all about our marriage.

2303
02:15:54,853 --> 02:15:58,363
When two people love each other
and can't make that work...

2304
02:15:58,398 --> 02:16:00,818
That's the real tragedy.

2305
02:16:04,571 --> 02:16:06,611
Kiss my cheek.

2306
02:16:12,955 --> 02:16:15,755
I can't believe that fucking spider
is America's sweetheart.

2307
02:16:15,791 --> 02:16:18,001
She told me she killed desi.

2308
02:16:18,043 --> 02:16:19,383
Not self-defense. Murder.

2309
02:16:19,419 --> 02:16:20,959
- Can't we get a wire?
- That's not gonna work.

2310
02:16:21,004 --> 02:16:22,174
She told you once before.

2311
02:16:22,214 --> 02:16:24,554
Yeah, because she had me strip naked,
and stand in the shower.

2312
02:16:24,591 --> 02:16:27,841
I swear, you two are the most
fucked-up people I've ever known.

2313
02:16:27,886 --> 02:16:29,346
And I specialize in fucked-up.

2314
02:16:29,596 --> 02:16:31,426
You and Amy under the same roof?

2315
02:16:31,473 --> 02:16:33,273
You should pitch that
as reality television.

2316
02:16:33,892 --> 02:16:36,272
Amy dunne,
and the miracle on the Mississippi.

2317
02:16:36,311 --> 02:16:38,811
Nick and I have been through
some bad patches.

2318
02:16:38,856 --> 02:16:40,196
We've had our dark days.

2319
02:16:40,232 --> 02:16:42,072
But we thank you so much...

2320
02:16:42,568 --> 02:16:47,108
For supporting us in our new life together,
for forgiving Nick.

2321
02:16:47,364 --> 02:16:51,084
Really, your encouragement
means the world.

2322
02:16:51,118 --> 02:16:52,528
She's good.

2323
02:16:52,578 --> 02:16:55,158
Amazing Amy and the humbled husband.

2324
02:16:55,205 --> 02:16:57,295
The real housewives of branson.

2325
02:16:57,332 --> 02:16:58,422
Take care of this guy, will you?

2326
02:16:58,458 --> 02:17:00,058
I can't believe you're just leaving now.

2327
02:17:00,085 --> 02:17:01,635
You are not at risk anymore.

2328
02:17:01,670 --> 02:17:03,210
I'm the definition of "at risk."

2329
02:17:03,255 --> 02:17:07,385
You got a book deal, a lifetime movie,
you franchised the bar.

2330
02:17:07,426 --> 02:17:08,476
You may wanna thank her.

2331
02:17:11,513 --> 02:17:12,933
Just don't piss her off.

2332
02:17:13,765 --> 02:17:14,765
See you, guys.

2333
02:17:16,894 --> 02:17:18,564
Elvis has left Missouri.

2334
02:17:18,604 --> 02:17:19,694
She had to have made a mistake.

2335
02:17:19,730 --> 02:17:22,020
We need to check Amy's story,
piece by piece.

2336
02:17:22,065 --> 02:17:23,945
Nick, I can't do anything.

2337
02:17:24,359 --> 02:17:27,189
We had the national spotlight on us,
we stained the rug.

2338
02:17:27,237 --> 02:17:28,957
The case is with the feds now,
they're done.

2339
02:17:28,989 --> 02:17:30,029
That doesn't mean you have to be done.

2340
02:17:30,449 --> 02:17:32,239
It does.

2341
02:18:03,815 --> 02:18:05,275
What are you doing?

2342
02:18:07,194 --> 02:18:08,784
Couldn't sleep.

2343
02:18:08,820 --> 02:18:09,820
Come on...

2344
02:18:10,113 --> 02:18:12,283
Let me tuck you back in.

2345
02:18:24,962 --> 02:18:27,592
You know you can sleep with me, right?

2346
02:18:29,675 --> 02:18:31,765
Yeah, it's just...

2347
02:18:31,802 --> 02:18:33,302
I need more time.

2348
02:18:33,345 --> 02:18:36,895
I would never, ever hurt you.

2349
02:18:38,684 --> 02:18:41,144
I do need you to participate, though.

2350
02:18:41,186 --> 02:18:43,346
I need you to do your part.

2351
02:18:53,657 --> 02:18:54,657
Okay.

2352
02:18:55,409 --> 02:18:58,239
Everything you have heard
about my wife...

2353
02:18:58,287 --> 02:18:59,657
Is a lie.

2354
02:18:59,705 --> 02:19:03,795
She is a calculating,
murderous psychopath.

2355
02:19:04,418 --> 02:19:05,958
And I have been complicit...

2356
02:19:06,003 --> 02:19:07,133
Nick!

2357
02:19:12,801 --> 02:19:14,971
Nick? Breakfast.

2358
02:19:15,012 --> 02:19:16,012
Honey?

2359
02:19:19,558 --> 02:19:22,018
We should hold hands.

2360
02:19:22,060 --> 02:19:25,150
Not the entire time,
but on and off throughout.

2361
02:19:26,565 --> 02:19:28,775
"So, Nick, how does it feel
to have your wife back?"

2362
02:19:31,403 --> 02:19:33,283
"It's fantastic.

2363
02:19:33,322 --> 02:19:36,372
"How many people are lucky enough
to get a second chance at love?"

2364
02:19:36,408 --> 02:19:38,118
"Fantastic" is a little flippant.

2365
02:19:38,535 --> 02:19:39,665
"Amazing"?

2366
02:19:39,703 --> 02:19:42,543
I need you
to admit that you got the credit cards...

2367
02:19:42,581 --> 02:19:45,581
And that you hid all that stuff at go's
and that you pushed me.

2368
02:19:46,335 --> 02:19:49,385
I'm gonna need
those three things to feel safe.

2369
02:19:50,589 --> 02:19:52,419
You have to own this, Nick.

2370
02:19:53,217 --> 02:19:56,757
Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.

2371
02:19:58,347 --> 02:20:00,097
Nick.

2372
02:20:03,060 --> 02:20:05,690
What a beautiful home.

2373
02:20:06,939 --> 02:20:09,609
I so appreciate
you giving us this time, Nick.

2374
02:20:09,650 --> 02:20:11,820
You went on national television...

2375
02:20:11,860 --> 02:20:14,320
And told people that I murdered my wife.

2376
02:20:14,363 --> 02:20:15,613
I go where the story goes.

2377
02:20:15,656 --> 02:20:18,626
You implied that I had carnal relations
with my sister.

2378
02:20:18,659 --> 02:20:22,199
I didn't use the "I" word.
I said you two were "extremely close."

2379
02:20:22,246 --> 02:20:26,926
You and a panel of nitwits
diagnosed me as a sociopath.

2380
02:20:28,126 --> 02:20:29,876
Ice-breaker.

2381
02:20:33,590 --> 02:20:35,380
To go with your robot dog.

2382
02:20:35,425 --> 02:20:37,475
I'll go find Amy.

2383
02:20:39,513 --> 02:20:41,603
She's downstairs.

2384
02:20:44,101 --> 02:20:45,731
- What is it?
- It's for you.

2385
02:20:45,769 --> 02:20:47,189
Open it.

2386
02:20:47,479 --> 02:20:49,229
I don't need any more gifts from you.

2387
02:20:49,273 --> 02:20:50,983
Open it.

2388
02:21:03,537 --> 02:21:05,197
I didn't touch you.

2389
02:21:05,247 --> 02:21:06,287
You didn't need to.

2390
02:21:06,331 --> 02:21:09,541
Bullshit. That notice of disposal.

2391
02:21:09,585 --> 02:21:11,095
I have that. You threw it out.

2392
02:21:11,128 --> 02:21:12,958
The notice, yes.

2393
02:21:13,338 --> 02:21:14,338
I want a blood test.

2394
02:21:14,756 --> 02:21:15,836
I want a paternity test.

2395
02:21:16,633 --> 02:21:17,973
I love tests.

2396
02:21:18,010 --> 02:21:19,840
You can teach those people
to hate me all you want.

2397
02:21:19,887 --> 02:21:22,597
I don't care. I am leaving you.

2398
02:21:24,725 --> 02:21:27,435
I won't have to teach your child
to hate you.

2399
02:21:27,477 --> 02:21:29,847
He'll do that all by himself.

2400
02:21:29,897 --> 02:21:31,767
You fucking cunt!

2401
02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:36,030
I'm the cunt you married.

2402
02:21:36,069 --> 02:21:37,859
The only time you liked yourself...

2403
02:21:37,905 --> 02:21:41,575
Was when you were trying to be someone
this cunt might like.

2404
02:21:41,617 --> 02:21:45,077
I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.

2405
02:21:48,832 --> 02:21:52,082
I've killed for you.
Who else can say that?

2406
02:21:53,337 --> 02:21:55,877
You think you would be happy
with a nice midwestern girl?

2407
02:21:55,923 --> 02:21:58,763
No way, baby. I'm it.

2408
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:02,220
Look, you're delusional. You're insane.

2409
02:22:02,262 --> 02:22:03,762
Why would you even want this?

2410
02:22:04,139 --> 02:22:05,219
Yes, I loved you.

2411
02:22:05,265 --> 02:22:08,735
And then all we did was resent each other,
and try to control each other.

2412
02:22:08,769 --> 02:22:09,809
And cause each other pain.

2413
02:22:10,312 --> 02:22:12,102
That's marriage.

2414
02:22:14,775 --> 02:22:17,155
Now, I'm getting ready.

2415
02:22:42,469 --> 02:22:45,549
I can't watch you play house
with that thing for the next 18 years.

2416
02:22:45,597 --> 02:22:47,257
I can't just walk away.

2417
02:22:47,307 --> 02:22:48,887
You could get custody.

2418
02:22:48,934 --> 02:22:52,814
No, I won't. And you know it.

2419
02:22:52,855 --> 02:22:55,365
It's gonna be my child.
I'm not gonna leave it.

2420
02:22:55,983 --> 02:22:57,783
You wanna stay.

2421
02:22:57,818 --> 02:23:01,738
I have a responsibility.
It's not about what I want anymore.

2422
02:23:01,780 --> 02:23:03,030
You wanna stay with her.

2423
02:23:13,667 --> 02:23:14,707
You're breaking my heart.

2424
02:23:15,169 --> 02:23:18,799
Go, you're my voice of reason.

2425
02:23:18,839 --> 02:23:21,339
I need you with me on this.

2426
02:23:21,383 --> 02:23:23,843
Of course I'm with you.

2427
02:23:26,471 --> 02:23:30,471
I was with you before we were even born.

2428
02:23:32,227 --> 02:23:35,017
We've been through the darkness.

2429
02:23:35,564 --> 02:23:38,864
We've come out, united.

2430
02:23:41,862 --> 02:23:44,032
We communicate.

2431
02:23:46,325 --> 02:23:48,835
We're honest with each other.

2432
02:23:48,869 --> 02:23:50,369
Right?

2433
02:23:52,289 --> 02:23:54,789
We're partners in crime.

2434
02:23:58,170 --> 02:23:59,170
And?

2435
02:24:00,881 --> 02:24:02,211
And?

2436
02:24:05,719 --> 02:24:07,639
We're gonna be parents.

2437
02:24:09,348 --> 02:24:10,968
My goodness!

2438
02:24:11,391 --> 02:24:13,351
- How exciting!
- Thank you.

2439
02:24:18,148 --> 02:24:20,518
"What are you thinking?"

2440
02:24:23,362 --> 02:24:25,572
"How are you feeling?"

2441
02:24:27,533 --> 02:24:30,163
"What have we done to each other?"

2442
02:24:31,745 --> 02:24:33,835
"What will we do?"
