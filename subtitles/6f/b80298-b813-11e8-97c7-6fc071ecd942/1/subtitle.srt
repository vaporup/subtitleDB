00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,150
{y:i} Panasonic.
Ideas for your life. 

2
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,360
These are awful.

3
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,320
They are really bad.

4
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,910
Hair-raising.

5
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,750
We need something edgy.
Something that is not totally out.

6
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,210
Our smartphone,
must be intelligent.

7
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,640
It is beautiful. It's perfect.

8
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,100
Thank you.

9
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,650
You have a great taste.

10
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,150
Do you know
what else I like about you?

11
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,280
You are conscientious.

12
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,160
You are incredibly intelligent.

13
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,410
And you are ambitious.

14
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,380
Well look at that!

15
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,390
It is organic.
- Traditional?

16
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,940
It's healthy.

17
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,490
Hello!
- Hello.

18
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,870
Two drunk
työmuurahaista at work.

19
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,040
I will probably bother you.
I think I'll leave.

20
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,750
Do not go. It remains of course.
I love surprises.

21
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,010
So you love.

22
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,140
Hey, Isabelle.
- Hey, Dirk.

23
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,730
I even this source.

24
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:53,400
Can just leave them.
- Ice, Isabelle.

25
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,780
Good night, Dirk. Good night.
- Isabelle, wait.

26
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,910
Outside it is freezing cold.
This is for you.

27
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,500
You can keep it.
- I can take against this.

28
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,880
I think we have a good team.
- Yeah, we are. I will continue to work at home.

29
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,100
You are crazy. Awesome.

30
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,020
Damn.

31
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,110
Stop it.
Stop it, damn it.

32
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,720
{y:i} Faithful assistant. 
- I'm sorry to wake you.

33
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,600
I got a great idea
campaign. Can you come?

34
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,680
{y:i} You're the boss. 
- Put on your tightest farkkusi.

35
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,040
Rolf? Hey.

36
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,300
I can not.

37
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,260
This weekend is busy.
I'm going to London for a minute.

38
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,760
Being sent from Reynold?

39
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,400
Okay. I invented something.

40
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,900
It would be in it.
Let's see what we have.

41
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,160
What do you think?
- My bottom is wonderful.

42
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,830
What do you think about the rest?
- It's brilliant.

43
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,520
I would like to list
all budgets tomorrow morning.

44
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,190
I do not have time to...
- Do I have to do it yourself?

45
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,480
No, because it's your job, Eric.
Thank you, this was all.

46
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,580
Good morning.
- Hello! Good morning.

47
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,330
What's wrong with your eyes?
Do you have a hangover?

48
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,710
I woke up in the middle of the night
and I would come up with a solution.

49
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,550
Biscuits solution?
- I think so.

50
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,180
I did one thing in the morning,
and I want you to look at it.

51
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,100
I think it's pretty good.
- Really?

52
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:01,190
{y:i} Hello. How great are </i>
my friend new jeans </i>

53
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,110
{y:i} truly spectacular. 

54
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,280
I saved on a flash drive,
so you can watch it on the plane.

55
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,500
I do not think so.

56
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:23,710
Why do not you?
- You're going to London.

57
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,800
Really?
- Oh, yes.

58
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:34,510
You know, these campaigns would thoroughly.
You take care of your home to do the job.

59
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,060
You did not see it completely.
- I saw enough. I trust you.

60
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:44,480
{y:i}Dirk will meet you at the airport.

61
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:50,410

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,380
Are you ready? </i>

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,980
Are you ready to watch, </i>
what the man in the street is .</i>

66
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,970
Now the party.
I booked a table Margaux.

67
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,230
It has more stars
than the Milky Way.

68
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,860
I'm really tired.

69
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,490
See you tomorrow.

70
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:56,160
To think that you are here with me.
- You are amazing. You are beautiful.

71
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,850
{y:i} We liked the idea very much. </i>
We use it internationally. </i>

72
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,560
That's great!

73
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,190
I was in the middle of the night
brainwave and...

74
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,110
Sometimes it just happens.

75
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,990
{y:i} Great. Worried, </i> when you do
not come to the meeting itself. </i>

76
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,080
I'm sorry. I stayed here because
of the financial statements.

77
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,250
Briiffasin Isabelle thoroughly.

78
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,460
I was ready to come
according to need.

79
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,550
{y:i} Nice work, Christine. 
- Thank you.

80
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,680
Would you be interested in returning to
home to New York?

81
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,350
And I would reject from there?
I'm fond of them.

82
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,360
They could indeed be ready to
to stand on their own feet.

83
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,780
Can I think about it?
- , Of course. 

84
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,090
Shocked

85
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,640
I would expect you to do

86
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,770
I wanted New York,

87
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,270
This is not a back puukotusta.

88
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,650
We are a team. You have the ability,

89
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,030
Thank you.

90
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,340
Nice.

91
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,010
I heard about it.
Aggravated thing about me. - What?

92
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,390
Christine can be reached in New York City
thanks to you.

93
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,140
When the team works, everybody wins.
My success depends on him.

94
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,320
Check this out. Omniphone ad
public opinion poll.

95
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,570
Have you ever seen
such figures?

96
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:48,240
Here are the changes.
They do not make any sense.

97
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,190
Good, girls.
Set out shoes for a friend.

98
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,020
An overview of the shoes. Oh, great.

99
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,070
Excellent. Walk to the center.

100
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,780
Here, here, here.
The next girl.

101
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,620
Beautiful.
- It's high.

102
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,210
The next girl.
Show what you know, Waruschka.

103
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,210
Next, thank you.
- I like those details.

104
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,880
Oh, great.

105
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,940
Oh, my God! Who hired her?
Down from the stage.

106
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,440
Could you please leave?

107
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,120
Cocktail Invitations are really boring,
but they have to show up.

108
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,790
How do they feel?
- These look great.

109
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,840
That's the main thing.
- I do not seem to be able to walk in these.

110
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,220
Did not they know the weather too
you feel a bit tuhmaksi?

111
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,310
You are truly mysterious.
- Am I?

112
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,940
We have been colleagues for months,

113
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,980
Or what you want.
What do you want?

114
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,320
I do not know.
What do you want?

115
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,250
Before I wanted to be admired.
- I admire you.

116
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,870
Now, I want to be loved.

117
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,770
Are you ready?
- I think.

118
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,110
I do not know mahdanko to survive.
- I'll teach you to chat.

119
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,490
Hey, Mark!

120
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,130
Now it's your turn.
- Do what?

121
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,350
Do you see that bald man over there,

122
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,430
He was an important man in the company.

123
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,100
If you catch him,
nettoat lot.

124
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,280
I do not know.

125
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,740
You remind me more
than you think. - I'm drunk.

126
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,200
So much the better.

127
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,830
Put him to talk about themselves.
It is a man's favorite topic.

128
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,380
Are you ready? Go.

129
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,060
Wait a minute. Hold this.
Show a bit of bare ground.

130
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,570
Nice to meet you.
Hey. I'm Isabelle.

131
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,470
Whether it's a nice surprise.

132
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,720
What do you say next weekend?
- I'm busy. Some other time.

133
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,270
Stop, Rolf.

134
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,360
And not just my machine.

135
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:34,450
I saved you Lontoolta boring.

136
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,070
I'll call you next week.

137
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,370
Can not you leave?

138
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,370
You are drunk. Go to the home.

139
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,510
Isabelle.
- I'm going home. My head hurts.

140
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,220
That is not like you think.

141
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,770
I did not send you to London, therefore,
so that was a comfort to me.

142
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,730
I sent you to London,
because I trust you.

143
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,650
And what does it matter anyway?

144
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,530
Take another drink.
- I'm going home. I have a bad feeling.

145
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,470
I live here.

146
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,310
Do you like this place?

147
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,150
What with him?

148
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,240
He likes role play.

149
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,250
Does that sound like fun?

150
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,670
He thought it was a lot of fun.

151
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,090
Check that.

152
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,610
He gave me a beautiful scarf.

153
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,280
Oh, no!

154
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,160
Do you want it back?
- I do not.

155
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,040
It suits you better.

156
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,050
Thank you.
- Not at all.

157
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,550
That is, he did.

158
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,230
The day's program has been completed.
Are there issues?

159
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,940
Isabelle, New York sent
you report a new comment.

160
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,190
Did you get it?

161
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:20,700
Did I get it?

162
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,660
I have not read it yet.
- Do not dithered with it.

163
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,500
I want to change the data immediately.

164
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:34,290
Thank you. That's it.
It remains for a while, Isabelle.

165
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,660
Are you still angry.

166
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,800
It bothers me,

167
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,550
I like you very much.
I love you.

168
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,820
Why can not you just say it?

169
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,500
When I was six years old,
my parents bought -

170
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,330
me and my twin.

171
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,050
Do you have a twin sister?

172
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,800
Alternately cycled to school.

173
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,640
Clarissa was a better bike ride.
He knew how to ride a bicycle standing up.

174
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,650
One day, the

175
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,440
I wanted to show,
that cycled as well.

176
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:27,780
Pedal faster and faster.
Clarissa had to run hard.

177
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:34,830
I let go of the handlebars.
I felt like to fly to.

178
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,960
It felt wonderful.
I wanted to see myself, -

179
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:48,220
so I looked at the window,
and thus the shadows.

180
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,560
I do not know what happened.
Bike slid into the middle of the street.

181
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,230
Truck ran towards me.

182
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:09,200
All of a sudden I noticed that my sister.

183
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,790
Then I remember just...

184
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,420
Terrible... thump.

185
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:31,390
When I woke up in the hospital,
I saw Mama cry.

186
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,520
I asked him,

187
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,560
He did not even look at me.

188
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,900
No one said anything,
but I knew their thoughts.

189
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,700
That I killed him.

190
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,210
After that, they do not ever
said he loved me.

191
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,760
I love you.
- Do you love?

192
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,390
You are a wonderful person.

193
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,050
You called me.
Here I am.

194
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,800
Hey, Isabelle.
- Hey, Dirk. How are you?

195
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,810
Happy.
- You are so tricky.

196
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,860
If things are like this,
is the best continue to work hard.

197
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,360
Good. - Would you leave.

198
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,420
He is adorable.
- Yes, it is.

199
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,720
What we do for scams?
- Fraud?

200
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,560
I need a couple of months time.
Then all is well again.

201
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,770
For a week.
- You are crazy. It is impossible.

202
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,980
New York makes its annual accounts.

203
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,780
I do not want scandal.

204
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:59,910
My company has been working for you

205
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,960
I wrote the budget in Annex.

206
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,340
I'll put it in the folder.
Read it.

207
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,390
Do you know what myyräni
New York says?

208
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:23,100
Now the spotlight has them.

209
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,190
They're going to make a new version
choosing the right actors.

210
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,200
Okay.
- No!

211
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,450
Upload to YouTube and show your spot,
it is that you're a genius.

212
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,040
If anyone sees this,
I'm a goner.

213
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,500
Pay the money back,
I'll rip it.

214
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:53,130
Listen to me, Christine.

215
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,590
This is about me.
- What the hell are you doing?

216
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Did you get my text?

217
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,390
What's going on?
- I have problems with this.

218
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,560
Christine does not help me.

219
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,190
Please let me know. I can help.
- You can not.

220
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,150
A terrible famine. Where do we go?
- Around the corner is a nice restaurant.

221
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,700
You can not help me.

222
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,500
Tell me what happened.

223
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:14,710
What? - This is
thing between us out now.

224
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,060
Why? What did he say?

225
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,890
What Christine said?
What happened in the meeting room?

226
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:34,690
You do not get it. Christine does not care
we give a shit.

227
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,360
Do not do this.
- Do not call me.

228
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,490
Do not send out text messages.
Go on about your work.

229
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,060
What?

230
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,100
Who is sick?

231
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:17,320
Your daughter?
I did not know you had a daughter.

232
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,070
Tomorrow?
How about?

233
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,530
How about,
you do not ever call me?

234
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,050
OMNIPHOHE CAMPAIGN
PROPOSED CHANGES

235
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,080
Would you visit us, Dani?

236
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,710
Mark?
Hey. Christine here.

237
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,010
So, it is a long time.
For far too long.

238
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:14,810
What are you doing?

239
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,070
You are right. This is bullshit.
Fuck them.

240
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,650
Let's see what you think.

241
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:35,660
Lovely.
You know my taste.

242
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,290
After all, there's not too noisy?

243
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:47,300
I'll take it. Manhattan Apartment
are wildly expensive.

244
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:58,650
All right.
We'll talk in a few days.

245
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,690
Goodbye.

246
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,990
Wow, Mark!

247
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,790
{y:i}So?
- Isabelle? J. J. Koch here. 

248
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,250
{y:i} Did I wake you? 
- No, not at all.

249
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,720
{y:i} Incredible trick. </i>
Not reach Christine. </i>

250
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,640
{y:i}Sorry. Christine
did not know about it.

251
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:38,640

visible only five hours. </i>

254
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,120

We'll be there tomorrow. </i>

256
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,790
{y:i} We're going to London </i>
and pop into while there. </i>

257
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,050
Isabelle Omniphone ad
has spread like a virus.

258
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,930
Advertisements should be put
in magazines and television.

259
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,760
The preliminary estimation is that the.

260
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:21,060
Every single denim brand implores.

261
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,070
This is a huge success.
Thank you.

262
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,400
Isabelle and Christine,
I would like to talk to you.

263
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,580
Great job, Isabelle.

264
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,040
Congratulations concept
and its implementation.

265
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:49,210
Christine, do you know how to smell
abilities and train them.

266
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,180
What comes to New York City,
Now is not the best moment.

267
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:58,680
Is expected yet.
Let's talk about that later.

268
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,520
No errand is no rush.
I have a lot to keep you busy here, too.

269
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:11,860
Oh, great. Isabelle, the way we
New York months.

270
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,450
Right.
- Thank you to both of you.

271
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,990
Goodbye.
- Thank you.

272
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,470
Why?

273
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,800
I think
their amendment were false.

274
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,180
I had to act
very quickly.

275
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,020
I missed you last night.

276
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,770
Just answer the question.
Why?

277
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,400
I watched you.
I listened to.

278
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,740
I picked up a few things.

279
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,120
This is not a back puukotusta.
This is just business.

280
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,050
So be it.

281
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,830
{y:i}So?

00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:56,170
{y:i} Thank you for responding. </i>
I here. </i> - What do you want?

283
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:06,430
{y:i}You were right. Christine forced </i>
me to put an end to our relationship. </i>

284
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:12,070
{y:i}Forced?
- He's fucking dangerous. 

285
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,740
You do not understand. He is a bit
strange because of her sister at work.

286
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,660
{y:i} Her sister? What are you talking about?
- Twin Sister Clarissa.

287

{y:i} He does not have the double sisters. </i>
It is exactly those of his thing. </i>

story to compassion. </i>

Is exactly what he is. </i>

292

Hey. You are late,
I do not see you.

302
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,680

me. Turn it on. </i>

306

{y:i} Would you like to see? 

310
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,070
Hell!

311
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,620
Shit!

312
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,080
Isabelle!

313
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,380
Isabelle! Is everything all right?

314
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,590
What happened? I need to talk.
I noticed one strange thing.

315
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,810
I am looking for one contract,
which was carried out earlier this year.

316
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:24,940
I noticed a huge difference
Dirk Harriman on the figures provided -

317
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,230
and the Middle East markets
the actual budget range.

318
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,160
Christine added a folder in the Annex,
which is like a criminal prosecution.

319
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:52,510
I knew that the man?
There was something strange. - What?

320
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:57,430
Dirk betrayed the money, and Christine
stopped protecting him.

321
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,480
Can I help you with something?
- Bring me some coffee.

322
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,820
Did you hear already?

323
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:16,530
Our managers to keep cocktail party
all department managers.

324
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,450
Tomorrow night here.

325
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,660
If not turn up,
get a toaster for Christmas.

326
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:37,140
We have a little surprise for you.
I hope it amuses you.

327
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,850
What are these walls
is actually happening?

328
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,600
I've put together for us
a small document.

329
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,440
"Very stressed-out leader
not very secret life. ."

330
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:57,490
Also included is the ecstasy and suffering
and little instruction.

331
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:24,390
One manager will be pissed.
Familiar to us all.

332
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,940
Should not be given the frustration
to domination.

333
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,150
Take a deep breath,
relax and keep going.

334
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,490
Is not that right?

335
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,160
This will be the next piece.

336
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,960
Caught red-handed.

337
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,670
We all have a need for
extract a bit of pressure at work.

338
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,380
You know the ones, who you are.
Go still next time the hotel.

339
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,720
Outside working hours, thank you.

340
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,930
What about then?

341
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,980
The impact directly on the concrete column.

342
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,870
Someone is not happy
parking place.

343
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:41,130
Come on, Isabelle.
It was just a joke.

344
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,720
Where's your sense of humor is?

345
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:53,900
I think you really get hurt.

346
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,030
I'm really sorry.

347
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,490
I thought that we could
laugh at this one.

348
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,510
It was funny.

349
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,540
Hey. I would like to talk about
Katzman with your doctor.

350
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,880
Stefan? Isabelle James here.
I need to see you.

351
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,330
Come on in..

352
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,130
Close the door.

353
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,770
Isabelle, I said I was sorry.

354
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:58,400
And yet, I got this.
- What is it?

355
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,320
"I'll never forget that humiliated
to me. You'll pay for it. ."

356
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,320
"Revenge is sweet."

357
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,910
I have not written that.
- It was sent to you from your computer.

358
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,080
Not very clever.
- I did not write it.

359
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:23,050
Hard to believe after the behavior.
- I did not write it.

360
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,220
Alright.

361
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,930
Deposit of this
a safe place. Approx.

362
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:46,700
It's taken a bit of a runaway
out of control in recent times.

363
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,780
I like the small dinner party
Saturday.

364
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:58,460
There will be a few friends.

365
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,970
It is the folder in which you told...
Dirk folder.

366
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,680
That's it for me.
- Okay.

367
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,530
In this folder you requested.
- Thank you.

368
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,200
I want to go to the ballet.
"Afternoon of a Faun" presentation.

369
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,250
At ten o'clock on a Saturday night.
- Okay.

370
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,660
Are you okay?
- I am.

371
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,590
I beg your pardon.

372
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:35,100
After all, he already eats pills.
- That bitch claimed him.

373
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:40,310
It is an embarrassing story garage claimed him.
He should resign.

374
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,700
I'm coming.

375
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:26,900
Good. A bit more of a smile.
Very good.

376
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:02,930
Thank you.

377
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,850
I'll walk you out.

378
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:17,820
Isabelle, nice to see you,
that you use a scarf.

379
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:23,790
How about a little kiss
and reconciliation?

380
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,020
What are you doing?
- How so?

381
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:52,230
Why kissed the bitch?
After all he is doing.

382
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,610
Do not talk to me like that tone.
Keep your mouth shut and go back to work.

383
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:14,590
Do you think nobody would notice?
- What?

384
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,430
What do you want.
- What do you mean?

385
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,680
Her pussy.

386
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:27,980
Isabelle and I laugh at it.
- I do not believe you.

387
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,900
Do you think I did not notice,
lesboaivoissasi what happens?

388
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,820
Jealousy ruin
työtoveruutemme.

389
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:40,490
I'm not going to put up with it.
I want you out of here.

390
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,240
You can not fire me.

391
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:47,540
I do not separate you.
You resign yourself.

392
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,290
I want your resignation is
on my desk Monday morning.

393
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,710
I'm not going to resign.

394
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:14,940
While this was the
sexual harassment. - What?

395
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:20,740
The word against the word.
Which mahdetaan believe?

396
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,500
You are so charming all.

397
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,930
And all so wonderfully boring.
All and sundry.

398
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:30,970
Especially you.
It's true.

399
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,650
Good night.

400
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,240
Christine.

401
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:51,620
Hello, Christine.
- Thank you for your help.

402
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:57,960
I need to talk.
- Thank you. Good night.

403
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,800
Hello to you.
- You are quite drunk.

404
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,050
Yes, I am. Let's go inside.

405
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:12,430
How did you get here?
- I drove the car really hard here.

406
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,310
For God's sake. What's wrong with you?
What's going on?

407
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,070
We need to talk.

408
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:23,400
You made me...
- There is talk now.

409
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:28,660
You forced me to do
a very bad thing.

410
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:52,390
You owe me.
Do not leave me in the lurch.

411
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,960
DO NOT LOCK THE DOOR

412
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:27,550
RIISUUDU, go take a shower,
SIDO your eyes and come to bed.

413
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,540
Let me in, Christine.

414
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:27,340
Open the door, Christine.

415
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:59,510
I'm coming.
Are you there?

416
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:02,990
Days. I am a detective sergeant Bach.
He is my colleague.

417
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,040
Are you Isabelle James?
- I am.

418
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,040
Can we come in?
- Why?

419
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:14,000
Are you all right?

420
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:18,840
Are you all right?
- I do not. I have not.

421
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:23,220
I took sleeping pills.
I can not sleep.

422
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:30,480
Do you know that Christine Stanford
throat was slit on Saturday?

423
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,150
Do you recognize this?

424
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:49,120
Do you recognize this?
It has been sent from your computer.

425
01:03:56,250 --> 01:04:00,720
Is not the victim of some
humility now on you at work?

426
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:04,390
Miss James?

427
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:11,980
We found... Miss James!

428
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:14,270
I am here.

429
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:19,860
We found the victim's hand, fibers,
derived from scarf.

430
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:23,700
Such,
that you have in this picture.

431
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:33,080
Can you explain it? Where were you
Saturday night at 23.30 - 01.00?

432
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:42,050
I was at the ballet.
- Where?

433
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,930
Ballet.

434
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,640
Were you alone?
- I was.

435
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:54,770
To identify any of you?
- Why would it have been?

436
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:59,270
Sometimes you can meet people,
who may remember.

437
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:03,400
Remember what?
- You to attend.

438
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:08,580
You would have an alibi, and you should
could not kill Christine Stanford.

439
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,830
I could not...
I will never...

440
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:18,540
If you have a lawyer,
you should call him.

441
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:25,800
Open your mouth.

442
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:34,730
Laboratory confirmed,
the fibers are scarf.

443
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,610
You will be charged with murder.

444
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:50,280
Isabelle, are you okay?

445
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:56,000
Can we get him in the water?
- Miss James.

446
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:01,800
Is a break?
Do you need a doctor?

447
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,260
I do not.
- Let's get this soon.

448
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:13,770
Lavastitte burglary,
aggravating the offense.

449
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,560
It is, therefore, of a deliberate murder.

450
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:24,230
Why do not you just recognize?
It would save everyone time and money.

451
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,070
You have a few fiber, which is suitable for
my client scarf image.

452
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:34,450
How many other scarf they fit? Did you
find the sacrifice of my client's DNA?

453
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:44,420
Surmasitteko Christine Stanford?
- Do not answer.

454
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:52,390
Yes, yes, I suppose so.
- Think about what you say, Isabelle.

455
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,230
What do you mean "probably"?
Surmasitteko?

456
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,230
Did you kill her?
- Do not answer.

457
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,280
Acknowledge that the murder?
- He did not do it.

458
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,570
I confess.

459
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:17,500
Hell!
- Forward.

460
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,090
Login now!

461
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:32,220
Away from the door!

462
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:30,240
{y:i} Are you all right, Isabelle 

463
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,780
{y:i} Surmasitteko Christine Stanford? </i>
- Do not respond to. </i>

464
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:37,030
{y:i} Surmasitteko </i>
- He did not do it. </i>

465
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:41,250
{y:i} Did you kill her? </i>
- My client's mental state... </i>

466
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:45,460
{y:i}Heads of confessed to the murder. </i>
- I confess. </i>

467
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,610
What?
- I want to see my lawyer.

468
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:12,320
I did not kill Christine.
- You want a confession back?

469
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:16,160
I'm innocent.
- Then why are you confessed?

470
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:21,290
I do not know. I was so tired.
I was a pill drunk.

471
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:25,000
I would have recognized anything.

472
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:29,130
I need to talk
with the prosecutor immediately.

473
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:35,840
This looks the same material,
but my scarf is not broken.

474
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:41,600
Where is it?
- Somewhere in my apartment.

475
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:45,270
We studied the apartment thoroughly
and did not find anything.

476
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:52,320
Seek out yet. The scarf is there.
- He has no reason to lie.

477
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:58,320
You've wasted enough of my time.
- Why would I be murdered Christine?

478
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:03,330
You had a strong motive. Revenge.
- I have not written that.

479
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:08,040
And if I were, then it would have been
foolish to kill him.

480
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:12,130
Christine probably sent it to the
my computer.

481
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:19,340
Creator. Look at the date.

482
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:23,140
This is referred to
days before the lumps.

483
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:29,520
Do you see? The day before
he humbled me.

484
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:34,940
This does not make sense.
I did not write this.

485
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:39,490
I was about to get a promotion,
Christine and bear it.

486
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:45,250
He tried to suppress Isabelle.
Many department confirms -

487
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:49,080
that my client became depressed
Christine's bullying of.

488
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,960
Are you crazy?
That's defenses?

489
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:55,460
Spare
mitigating circumstances for the judge!

490
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:59,510
I'm only interested in evidence.
- It is what we are trying to give.

491
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,560
I was not Christine's house.
I was at the ballet.

492
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,180
You claim it.

493
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,190
I talked to
Ballet with an usher.

494
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,530
He had a gray, curly hair,
and he spoke bad English.

495
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,150
He remembers me.

496
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:25,910
Have you seen this woman?
- I do not.

497
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,330
Do not you surely?
- I do not.

498
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:41,090
Days. Katsoisitteko this?
Have you seen this woman?

499
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,270
I am.
- Do you?

500
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:51,980
He sat there. He wanted to
may sit in the middle of the line.

501
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:55,020
I had to guide him in there.

502
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:59,320
Whether or not this will certainly
this woman? - There was.

503
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:04,620
I booked a ticket
Saturday night's myöhäisnäytökseen.

504
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:07,870
He could not be
Christine's home.

505
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:13,290
Maybe he left the States. Christine
the house was ten minutes away.

506
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:22,130
Why do not you ask Dirk harrimanella?
He was reportedly there.

507
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:26,050
He was furious,
Christine rejected because of him.

508
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:28,220
And he was drunk.

509
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:35,150
He knew everything from ballet.
- It is a well-known classic.

510
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:39,730
Usher guarantee him an alibi.
What else do we have?

511
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:43,860
His DNA was not
the murder weapon and the crime scene.

512
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:47,580
No DNA but e-mail,
which is the only who could not write.

513
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:52,080
As if we were forced
labile to recognize the woman.

514
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,870
Just check
Christine male friend.

515
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,210
Witnesses saw them
fighting over the crime scene outside.

516
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:02,260
Or even miesystäväkin.
Either the house is checking out?

517
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,550
Together, this evidence
nolaan myself in court.

518
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:11,390
My client was accused of
wrong reasons. He has an alibi.

519
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,270
Against him is not
no evidence. No DNA.

520
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,110
What about the scarf fibers?
- They are not my huivistani.

521
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:24,860
You say, then, that you have for one.
- It must be found. It is not broken.

522
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:29,280
May I make a suggestion?
- Of course.

523
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:34,040
Do you offer to help my client
scarf for search?

524
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,760
What's this?

525
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:30,100
Christine found out that Dirk
tried to cheat a large sum of money.

526
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:33,810
How much?
- I do not know the exact figure.

527
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:36,390
More than five million.

528
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,400
The sum of one million of Class,
and Christine was going to expose him?

529
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,480
Why piilottelitte proof?

530
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:48,280
We are friends. Dirk needed
just the time to restore the money.

531
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:52,580
So hid the information. Do not you
understand that it is a motive for murder?

532
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:56,200
No! Dirk could never do that.

533
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:01,630
We have to leave.
- Wait a minute. Can I look for?

534
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:06,880
My scarf is in that box. Sometimes
they slip out of the back of the box.

535
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:11,140
Alright. Let her look.
- Thank you.

536
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:25,230
It's got to be here.
- That's enough, Isabelle.

537
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,820
It's got to be here! No!

538
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:33,580
Even a minute!
Just one minute! Do not be!

539
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,080
I did not do it.

540
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:43,380
Of course not.
I know that.

541
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:53,850
Headscarf is
in one of the apartment.

542
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:57,270
You have to look for it.

543
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,920
What a mess.
Should I clean up?

544
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:29,380
Where did you get this?
- It was dirty, the back of the box.

545
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:32,430
I took it to the cleaners.

546
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:37,140
Ms. Wirth, this is outrageous.
You will get another cleaner.

547
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:42,640
Detective Chief Inspector Bach.

548
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,730
Mr. Harriman.
- What do you want?

549
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:53,570
I am a detective sergeant Bach.
You are accused of embezzlement.

550
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:59,700
We studied the place.
First the car, then your apartment.

551
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:04,080
You have to get the wire.
- The prosecutor will explain to you everything.

552
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:08,920
Christine broke into Stanford
apartment night of the murder?

553
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:12,630
I will not.
- Do you deny olleenne there?

554
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,880
I do not.

555
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:20,930
Were you his guest?
- I was. I arrived late.

556
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:24,520
When?
- I do not remember.

557
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:28,690
You do not remember?
- I do not remember.

558
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,530
Is this you?

559
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,290
It was scarf.

560
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,080
Was that?
- Yes.

561
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:51,960
If that's Christine Stanford
blood... Put the recovery.

562
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:58,760
This is ridiculous.
- Kavalsitte company money.

563
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:03,930
Christine was going to report you.
You're a villain but also a murderer.

564
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:09,060
I do not speak any
without a lawyer present.

565
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:20,200
Is not it incredible?
He bought me a bouquet of roses.

566
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:24,330
Then he showed up at my door
apologize.

567
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,580
He was quite red
naamaltaan and bathed in sweat.

568
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:31,710
He was so sorry,
I was arrested a while.

569
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:35,340
The time sweet.
Did you invite him in?

570
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:40,180
No, you crazy?
I smiled sweetly, -

571
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:44,640
I took the cheap roses fool with explanatory
notes and threw them in the garbage.

572
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:47,440
Bach poor. What a cliché.

573
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,980
The hard-boiled cop
fall in love with the beautiful killer.

574
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:55,490
I'm not a murderer.

575
01:18:56,990 --> 01:18:58,660
Oh, yeah.

576
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:04,290
Dani...
I know what you did for me.

577
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:10,290
You would have done the same for me.
- Of course.

578
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:23,560
Shall again
number 26? - Okay.

579
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:47,660
They are okay, but do not
good enough. What do you think?

580
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:54,420
Dani!

581
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:59,340
That kiss did not happen.

582
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:04,050
I love you.
I want you, Isabelle.

583
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:09,680
That's the problem.

584
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,480
Why?
- Jesus Christ! Are you kidding me?

585
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:25,280
After all, you love me.
- I do not. What's wrong with you?

586
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:28,200
I do not love you.
- You love.

587
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:31,620
You may not want to admit it,
but you love me.

588
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:36,090
We have drunk too much.
I make espressos, and I'll call a taxi.

589
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:39,630
Go home and sleep.
Talk to you tomorrow.

590
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:45,010
No, not tomorrow.
It's not true, Isabelle?

591
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:49,810
You love me.
- Stop it. You are pathetic.

592
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:53,560
Am I pathetic?
All my support after that?

593
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:59,730
I am grateful. Thank you.
- That you gave already.

594
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:07,280
This is the espresso. Sit down
and then find out. I'll call you a cab.

595
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:19,590
Hello. The most space taxi.

596
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:11,510
Ytyjä pills.

597
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:20,980
You know, I'm not at risk.
I was wondering pills popsimistasi.

598
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:25,780
{y:i} Until a couple of them fell to </i>
teeheni and I tasted them. </i>

599
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:29,870
They were
Sweetening harmless.

600
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:35,830
I followed you to see
what are you gonna.

601
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:43,800
{y:i} First stop </i>
was a scarf store. </i>

602
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:48,720
{y:i} You bought the same scarf as </i>
got Christine and hide it. </i>

603
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:50,760
{y:i} interesting. 

604
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:56,730
What about then?
Oh, and ballet.

605
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:04,110
{y:i} Followed you and saw how </i>
cause a conflict and you got an alibi. </i>

606
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,890
{y:i} last stop </i>
was Christine's house. </i>

607
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,100
{y:i} All the pieces fell into place </i>
place. </i>

608
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:22,940
The perfect moment.

609
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:40,080
Let me in, Christine.

610
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:49,460
{y:i}Confession was the bait.
- I confess. 

611
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:54,340
It's a fool lieutenant swallowed up the
false hook, line and sinker clues.

612
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,940
The perfect murder.
- Except for...

613
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:11,490
Videos.

614
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:16,410
I gathered them aggravating
folder Lieutenant Bach.

615
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,870
And I downloaded this folder.

616
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,790
And can not be traced?
- I bought this for that purpose.

617
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,750
Is not it cute?
You just have to press the send button.

618
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:42,230
What do you want?
- Do not talk like that tone.

619
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,860
What do you want?

620
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:51,400
Come here.

621
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,370
Sit down.

622
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:12,760
Come closer.

623
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,510
Kiss me.

624
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:35,900
Do not like it?
You love me.

625
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,880
Turn around.

626
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:03,140
I love you.

627
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:02,780
I thought,
the twin sister of a fairy tale.

628
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:07,290
I did not get the opportunity to
ask for forgiveness.

629
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:36,020
So?

630
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:15,600
SEND?
