1
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,956
This is Chu Tu.
He's in his mid to late forties.

2
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,717
He's a nightclub owner, trader,
and property developer.

3
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,156
But we've found out all his companies
are losing money.

4
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,391
Hey, how are things up there?

5
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,677
This is Mad Wing, his bodyguard.

6
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,550
All of his employees
are actually hit men.

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,473
Be careful!
I'll see you at the dye factory.

8
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,232
Wait for me up there.

9
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,194
This is Danny Chu, his nephew.
He's always surrounded by bodyguards.

10
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,590
This is John Ko, the brains
behind Chu Tu's organisation.

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,993
This lady's name is Salina Fong.
She's only joined Chu Tu recently.

12
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,835
It's hard to tell how much she knows
but she is involved.

13
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,518
Our mission is to arrest
all these drug dealers.

14
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,309
The code name is Operation Boar Hunt.

15
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,755
- Have you got that?
- Yes, sir!

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,753
Read your orders.
You all have specific duties.

17
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,197
Memorise then destroy.
It's crucial that you stay in position.

18
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,198
Hurry, come on!

19
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,633
Attention! Crime squad!
The Operation is underway!

20
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,391
Would you like a cup of tea?

21
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,231
- Two teas please!
- OK!

22
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,119
I'll be back for them.

23
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,156
There is a suspicious looking guy.

24
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,076
Two teas please!

25
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,355
Tell the others, I'll check it out.

26
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,558
- Kim!
- Are you buying me a tea?

27
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,471
- We've been discovered.
- What?!

28
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,710
Follow the guy in the red top.

29
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,718
- What is it?
- There's a suspicious looking guy...

30
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,438
- What are you doing?
- Police!

31
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,114
- It's the police!
- The police are here!

32
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,476
Freeze! Police!

33
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,790
I just heard some gunshots.

34
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,872
- They've opened fire!
- Let's break up the crowd first.

35
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,234
Leave this area now!

36
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,755
Crime squad. What's happening?!

37
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,998
Police! Get out of here!

38
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,197
Go on! Hurry!

39
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,231
Listen! Mind the residents
and get the kids inside.

40
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,313
Hurry up! Go on!

41
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,992
- Move in and help.
- But we're supposed to stay put.

42
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,470
The situation's changed. Move it!

43
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,588
- Let me go!
- It gets tighter if you move.

44
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,635
Let me go!

45
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,029
I'll keep you covered,
you make a break for it.

46
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,195
There's a female suspect up there.
Take her back to the station.

47
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,159
It's only me!

48
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,108
- Why did they open fire?
- Don't ask me.

49
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,878
Calm down!

50
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,915
Help me!

51
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,992
Tak! Cover me!

52
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,352
Tak!

53
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,395
You must stay calm.

54
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,074
Help me.

55
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,151
You stay here and take care of him.

56
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,912
They mean business!

57
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,792
Don't forget the warning.
Mind the villagers.

58
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,519
But will the bad guys
give a damn about them?

59
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,953
Who made you a cop?

60
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,393
Come here!

61
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,712
Be careful, Ka-kui.
These guys are really mean!

62
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,839
Boss! This way!

63
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,119
Get in!

64
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,037
You're blocking the road!
Get out of the way!

65
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,678
Reverse!

66
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,269
Not this way!

67
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,238
- You OK?
- This way's blocked, go back.

68
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,719
Go back! Quick!

69
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,870
Go back up!
The road below is blocked!

70
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,997
- We're stuck, boss! Now what?!
- Go that way!

71
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,354
Let's go!

72
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,833
Boss! Quick!

73
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,953
This way!

74
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,635
Freeze!

75
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,633
Mind the civilians!

76
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,995
Where have you been?
They've all escaped.

77
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,470
- We went up to help.
- Who gave that order? They're gone!

78
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,516
You can't blame me for that.

79
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,197
Hurry, go!

80
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,634
Can I borrow this?

81
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,757
Tell them to get down.
Don't let them see my face.

82
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,512
Tell the driver to step on it!

83
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,759
Get down!

84
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,475
Turn here, turn!

85
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,069
- Keep going!
- Keep going!

86
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,031
- Easy, boss, we'll make it.
- Look!

87
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,989
Get up there, and get rid of him.
Tell the driver to go faster!

88
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,269
Come down here and get him.

89
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,032
Come down!

90
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,437
Turn the bus! Go down the hill!

91
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,030
What are you doing?

92
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,473
Police. Stay back!

93
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,272
- Boss, the bastard's right in front!
- Run over him!

94
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,952
Step on it, run over him.

95
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,713
We'll be all right.

96
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,235
Freeze!

97
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,319
You're under arrest,
but you have the right to...

98
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,868
If you let me go...

99
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,790
this is all yours.

100
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,638
There is a lot of money here,
no one will ever find out.

101
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,474
Smart guy!

102
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,549
Stop!

103
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,239
Well done, you guys.

104
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,598
Give him credit if he praises you
and don't let it go to your heads.

105
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,639
I know what to do. Ka-kui is the one
who needs your advice.

106
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,872
I didn't do it alone. It was a
success because of careful planning.

107
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,431
That's a great line. Don't forget
to say it when the Super comes.

108
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,353
He'll be very happy to hear that.

109
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,194
Operation Boar Hunt
was carefully planned.

110
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,589
You were told to go in
and make the arrest.

111
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,911
You almost let the prime suspect
get away.

112
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,955
What happened?

113
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,951
Didn't he give you clear orders?

114
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,112
Yes, but he said the operation
was very well planned.

115
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,349
What?!

116
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,074
This operation was carefully planned.
But it had a few flaws.

117
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,878
Why were there flaws?

118
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,793
That's because Ka-kui
couldn't handle the woman.

119
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,997
Before we even got to the store,
they heard her screaming.

120
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,231
How did Chu Tu get through your men,
then?

121
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,958
What do you mean by that?

122
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,032
Don't point your fingers
at each other.

123
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,678
- What?!
- The PR lady is here.

124
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,113
Let her in.

125
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,391
The press is here, Superintendent.

126
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,436
- Tell them no comment!
- Hold it.

127
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,990
- I asked them to come.
- Then, tell them to wait.

128
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,591
- Ka-kui, you'll be our spokesman.
- Me?!

129
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,639
- I can't possibly.
- The speech is ready, just read it.

130
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,995
Learn your lines
and don't botch them.

131
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,071
You can go now.

132
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,152
The Chief is well pleased
with Ka-kui's performance.

133
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,912
A promising lad.

134
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,549
After the speech, take him
to do a police recruitment poster.

135
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,279
And arrange for him to appear on TV.

136
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,554
A role model?!

137
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,359
The Chief thinks
he's a model policeman.

138
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,079
He should be good at it.

139
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,230
What are the charges on Salina?

140
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,552
Drug dealing, resisting arrest
and assaulting police officers.

141
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,393
- Drop all the charges.
- Really?!

142
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,477
You played a big part
in this operation.

143
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,270
The success of this operation
depended on skilful planning.

144
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,395
He means you.

145
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,198
Will you get a promotion?

146
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,311
As a police officer,
I don't fight crime to get promoted.

147
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,073
I'm not worried about promotions.

148
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,798
Did Chu Tu try to bribe you?

149
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,839
He sure did, with millions.
He could have bribed the whole force.

150
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,876
Just kidding! Don't put that down.

151
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,791
Can you two sit closer?

152
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,958
- What are you doing?
- Just saying hello.

153
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,314
Don't sit too close.

154
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,078
Let me sit here.

155
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,233
- He'll come this way, right?
- Yeah!

156
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,719
Let's start!

157
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,873
Straighten up your back.

158
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,757
Open your eyes a bit more.

159
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,990
Open your mouth. Wider.

160
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,230
Wider still!

161
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,509
Forget it, just be yourself!

162
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,079
Ready?!

163
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,196
The handcuffs in the middle.
Try to be more energetic.

164
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,436
- Your plan wouldn't work.
- Why not?

165
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,911
Remember, she's Chu Tu's secretary,
not just anyone can get that job.

166
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,434
Chu Tu's been arrested
and once he knows

167
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,115
his secretary is going to be
a witness, what will he do?

168
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,753
He'll do everything he can
to stop her appearing in court.

169
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,237
Whoever we send to protect her
will be in danger.

170
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,272
Don't be a cop if you're not
willing to risk your life.

171
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,958
Put that line
on one of our recruitment posters.

172
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,759
We don't have enough evidence to
prosecute him.

173
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,799
We must push him into a corner.
Then we can put him behind bars.

174
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,235
Who's going to protect her?
I suggest...

175
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,039
I have someone in mind already.

176
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,076
Great minds think alike.

177
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,717
Good luck to him.

178
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,148
You're the only one who got bail.

179
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,310
You're really lucky.

180
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,518
- They're here to see the Super.
- Please wait.

181
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,511
- Please wait.
- Right.

182
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,670
You can leave after you've seen him.

183
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,908
- You can go in now.
- Thanks!

184
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,039
Please sit down!

185
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,389
You can leave now, Miss Fong.

186
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,799
Wait a second.

187
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,192
Please keep this subpoena,
you'll need it to appear in court.

188
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,356
- What's the charge?
- Nothing!

189
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,432
But you'll be acting
as our witness.

190
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,153
I'm sorry!
My client isn't going to do that.

191
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,995
We're not asking her.
According to law, she has to do it.

192
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,438
- Inspector Chan!
- Yes, sir.

193
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,230
Your job is to protect Miss Fong
until she appears in court.

194
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,912
- Me? Protect her?
- Why not?

195
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,560
- Great!
- I don't need his protection.

196
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,916
As long as he doesn't harass you,
you can't refuse.

197
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,039
Inspector Chan.

198
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,509
As an escort of the witness,
you must be aware

199
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,434
that the witness is often faced with
threat, disturbance, and assault,

200
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,399
or irritated
by the intentions of such.

201
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,635
It is your duty to see her safety
and personal rights are intact.

202
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,678
Yes, sir!
But can you send someone else?

203
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,638
You'll get expenses
for this assignment -

204
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,199
$2.00 per day.

205
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,192
It's an old tradition,
unchanged for years.

206
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,910
I know it's very little. That's all.

207
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,117
Can we talk to you alone, Miss Fong?

208
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,239
My client doesn't answer questions
without the presence of her lawyer.

209
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,311
We won't ask her any questions.

210
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,278
We just want to advise her
for her own good.

211
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,593
- You have the right to refuse this.
- Let me see what they have to say.

212
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,116
Mr Cheung! Please excuse us.

213
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,718
You don't have to answer if they ask
you any questions about the case.

214
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,591
- Get out of here!
- I have to go, too?

215
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,193
What is your rank?

216
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,709
What do you want to talk to me about?

217
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,595
Nothing, you can go now.

218
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,879
See you in court.

219
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,958
Did they ask... Let's go.

220
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,633
Ka-kui.

221
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,112
- Your tape recorder.
- OK.

222
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,670
- What did they say to you?
- They didn't say anything.

223
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,710
- I'm your lawyer, you can trust me.
- They didn't say a word to me.

224
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,634
- Why was it only her...
- They're coming!

225
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,870
- How's our boss and the others?
- I can't bail them out.

226
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,953
- What about Salina, then?
- She's their witness.

227
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,349
- What? Really?!
- They want me to do it.

228
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,271
You should have turned it down.

229
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,237
Stop bothering our witness!

230
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,915
- Who are you?
- I'm a cop!

231
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,150
My duty is to protect her.

232
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,028
If you keep doing that, I can charge
you with interfering with the police.

233
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,269
Salina...

234
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,238
You can only say goodbye or bye-bye.

235
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,515
One more word
and you're under arrest.

236
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,192
- I'll take you home.
- That's part of my job.

237
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,918
I'll tell them nothing!

238
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,869
- Now what, Mr Cheung?
- I'll see your boss this afternoon.

239
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,473
All right! Let's go!

240
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,793
It's dangerous for you
to hang around outside.

241
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,475
- Let's go home, shall we?
- It's none of your business.

242
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,879
It's for your own safety.

243
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,478
I don't need your protection,
you fool!

244
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,469
You know what happened to the last
witness who said that?

245
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,629
What happened?!

246
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,714
Were they shot? Don't try to
scare me. It won't work.

247
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,268
You're right!
They were fine in the end.

248
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,911
- You can do whatever you want.
- You can't scare me!

249
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,229
All the evidence
points to the defendants.

250
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,197
Only your situation is better.

251
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,555
We're depending on you, Mr Cheung.

252
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,755
I'll do my best.

253
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,276
You'd better be prepared for
bad news. The chances are slim.

254
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,989
If I walk away free,
I'll take good care of you.

255
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,310
There's still something
we need to worry about.

256
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,188
- Salina is their witness.
- Is she really?!

257
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,032
She's been granted bail.

258
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,749
The police even gave her an escort -
the guy who arrested you.

259
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,637
Salina doesn't know much. She's new.

260
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,358
That doesn't concern me.

261
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,716
But she could say something bad
about us in court.

262
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,829
I don't think she would... All right.

263
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,600
Call Danny for me.
Tell him to take care of Salina.

264
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,756
- Thanks a lot!
- Keep the change!

265
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,875
See you later!

266
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,512
- It's dangerous to stay home alone.
- I always live dangerously.

267
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,637
- John? I just got back.
- The phone is tapped.

268
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,672
All right, I'll meet you later.

269
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,434
I'm really scared!

270
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,269
You think you can scare me like that?

271
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,075
Help!

272
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,235
Help!

273
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,799
I'm going to kill you!

274
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,953
I'll get you!

275
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,395
You have to die!

276
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,078
I'm going to kill you!

277
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,275
Go to hell!

278
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,995
I got you!

279
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,516
I'm going to kill you!

280
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,034
Don't run away!

281
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,313
I've got you now!

282
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,752
Go to hell!

283
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,078
There's no way out. You're finished.
I'm going to kill you!

284
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,639
Don't worry! I'm here!

285
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,311
She's terrified. Can I go now?

286
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,597
You can leave right now.

287
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,636
Hold on to him, I'll call the police.

288
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,838
The phone line!

289
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,915
Go now!

290
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,071
I knocked him out!

291
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,709
Not yet! He's still conscious.

292
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,351
He's fighting me! Keep away from us!

293
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,388
Please go now.
You can't stay here any longer.

294
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,748
He's passed out!

295
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,794
No! He's still conscious. See?

296
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:11,237
Please leave here right now!
Go now! Go on!

297
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,755
Go! Hurry!

298
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,669
Leave him to me!

299
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,238
- He's fainted.
- Let me hit him one more time!

300
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,194
Stop, or we won't be able
to identify him.

301
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,910
- But...
- I don't want to do this any more.

302
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,673
I don't know him.

303
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,072
- They'd use a stranger to kill you.
- Why kill me?

304
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,869
Of course, Chu Tu's a ruthless man.

305
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,473
Inspector Chou, it's Ka-kui.
I just realised this is a tough case.

306
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:05,272
Can you send a replacement? No?!
I'm not risking my life for this job.

307
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,309
I've had enough of her! I don't
give a damn about her any more.

308
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,949
I quit! Enough is enough!

309
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,792
- Where are you going?
- Home!

310
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,908
- You're supposed to protect me!
- But you're not cooperating.

311
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,119
- What if I cooperate?
- It's too late! I quit.

312
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,628
I was right.
You cops have no sense of duty.

313
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,554
But there's nothing I can do.
If I stay here, I'll get killed, too.

314
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,833
I'll cooperate.

315
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,995
I'm not forcing you.

316
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,470
I'm doing it of my own free will.

317
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,279
You should come to my house,
it's much safer there.

318
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,794
- Great!
- Look at you!

319
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,111
- I'll get changed!
- Chu's men could be back any time.

320
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,158
I won't change my clothes, then.
Now what?

321
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,439
What is it?!

322
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,034
I'm checking
to see if everything's OK.

323
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,918
Go back!

324
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,559
You can come out.

325
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,796
- Why are you holding that?
- This is your jacket.

326
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,313
I told you to put it on.

327
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,075
Follow me!

328
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,553
Use my car.

329
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,074
- Which one is yours?
- Over there.

330
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,471
- Why are you not nervous at all?
- I'm used to situations like this.

331
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,588
- I told you to stay quiet, didn't I?
- Now what?

332
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,110
- Are you all right?
- My son!

333
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,113
Close the car door!

334
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,874
It's me! Give me my gun!

335
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,998
It's in my jacket pocket.

336
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,475
Help!

337
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,029
I've got you!

338
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,713
Freeze!

339
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,599
Freeze!

340
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,471
Stay calm! Give me the gun.

341
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,630
- Stay calm!
- Keep away!

342
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,475
Give me the gun! It's me!

343
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,240
- Are you all right?
- Where are they?

344
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,276
You scared them off with that shot.

345
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,875
We must get you away from here,
those guys are for real.

346
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,193
Who was the guy at my house, then?

347
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,909
He wanted to kill you, too.
But these are professionals.

348
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,833
- I see why you're nervous now.
- Get in the car.

349
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,395
- You're crying?!
- How could Chu Tu do this to me?

350
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,758
You can't be that naive,
your boss is capable of anything.

351
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,559
He can't have you in that courtroom!

352
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,789
What should I do then?

353
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,155
You should tell the judge everything

354
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,915
so he can put Chu in jail
and then you'll be safe.

355
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,514
What should I say to the judge?

356
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,191
What rackets Chu Tu's involved in,

357
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,590
who his contacts are,
who the dealers are.

358
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,074
Why are you taping this?

359
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,073
It's for my own reference.
How long have you worked for him?

360
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,479
Four years.

361
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,993
He's a family friend. He used to give
my mother money to buy me food.

362
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,313
- Now you help him deal drugs.
- I hardly know anything.

363
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,595
You can still tell me
what you do know.

364
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,150
If you remember anything else,
don't forget to tell me.

365
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,038
Do you have enough to prosecute him?

366
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,079
That's for the court to decide.
What you've told me is very useful.

367
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,275
Come in.

368
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,553
Come on.

369
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,993
Let me turn on the lights.

370
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,433
It's May.
I almost forgot today's my birthday.

371
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,189
Are you all right?

372
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,635
Let me introduce you,
this is Miss Fong.

373
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,551
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. May!

374
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,795
They've all gone? That was quick!

375
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,154
It's all my fault.

376
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,437
She wanted to surprise you,
but you brought me here.

377
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,353
And I'm dressed like this.
Of course she's angry.

378
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,991
I'm angry, too. I didn't
even have the chance to explain.

379
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,036
She dumped the cake on me!

380
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,554
I won't answer
if she calls to apologize.

381
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,870
I doubt she will.

382
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,116
I knew she would be back!

383
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,319
What's happy about it?

384
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,391
I saw May. What's wrong?

385
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,439
- She saw me with our witness.
- I'll go and explain to her.

386
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,471
No need. Tell her to curb her temper.

387
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,510
Why do I have to explain everything
to everyone?

388
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,999
I'm sick and tired of it.

389
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,311
Do you want some cake?
What about a drink, then?

390
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,994
- Orange juice, please!
- Help yourself!

391
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,589
Do you live alone?

392
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,196
It's too big, they'd get me
for corruption. My flatmate's away.

393
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,955
I'm really sorry. Your girlfriend
was furious when she saw me.

394
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,033
Don't worry. I was doing my job.
It's time she understood.

395
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,998
Come on! Come in!

396
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,358
You'll be all right. I'm leaving.

397
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,668
See you!

398
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,113
I'm just a cop now.

399
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,432
But I might become a movie star
and have to kiss ladies passionately.

400
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,794
What would she do then?

401
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,630
She loves you, so she's jealous.
I'll explain to her.

402
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,076
What for? She'll never understand me.

403
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,197
Aren't you going
to say something nice to her?

404
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,912
No way! If I started sweet-talking,
I'd have a million girls.

405
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,560
She must say sorry!

406
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,838
You love her a lot, don't you?

407
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,388
To be honest, I do love her a lot!

408
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,792
But loving her is one thing,
apologizing is another.

409
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,953
When she gets home,
she'll call and apologize to me.

410
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,718
What a waste of food!

411
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,196
Am I right?
She couldn't wait to call me.

412
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,669
- Is that your girlfriend?
- It's her. She's crying!

413
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,116
Stop crying. You shouldn't
humiliate me in front of people.

414
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,034
What?! If I was with a man,
you'd think I was gay.

415
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,634
You're so childish!
Curb your temper!

416
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,029
- Let me explain to her.
- No need!

417
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,634
Curb that temper of yours!

418
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,838
You should show me some respect.
Stop crying. Talk to you later.

419
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,480
It's time to teach her a good lesson.

420
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,758
- When did she come back?
- Right after you went in the shower.

421
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,400
So she heard everything?

422
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,595
The phone call?!

423
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,194
Not again! May!

424
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,195
Let me explain. She's our witness,
my job is to protect her.

425
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,157
I'm mad about what you just said!

426
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,392
I was just kidding. Don't be mad.

427
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,837
You just insulted me in front of her.
How dare you?!

428
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,469
- Go away!
- Please listen to me! May!

429
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,958
- Are you all right?
- No! Are you happy now?!

430
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,871
I didn't mean to do that!

431
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,158
Your shoe. Here, put it on.

432
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,468
Go away!

433
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,994
- Please listen to me!
- No, I don't want to!

434
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,193
Don't be so childish.

435
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,239
- Listen to me, will you?
- Let me go.

436
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,879
Be careful!

437
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,794
I hate you!

438
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,079
Where is she?

439
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,869
I accepted her apologies,
and she went home.

440
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,270
- Oh, you! That hurt?
- What did I do?

441
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,555
You really poked me!

442
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,718
You're breaking it!
Don't push too hard!

443
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,748
What an ugly thing! Go away!

444
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,434
It's the only one I got.
It's broken.

445
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,593
You got me all wet!

446
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,238
Let me wipe it for you.

447
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:24,154
Please, no more! No, don't!
Not there, here.

448
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,593
- Here?!
- Yeah!

449
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,719
Be gentle! That hurt!

450
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,433
This sofa's hard, it's not very
comfy. Let's go to bed now.

451
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,955
Let's go to bed.

452
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,838
- But where can I sleep?
- On my bed.

453
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,037
- And you?
- Next to you.

454
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:53,033
You're so protective. It's exciting!

455
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,919
I'm going to bed.

456
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,513
Don't wake me up.

457
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,998
Women are weird!

458
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,558
Ka-kui? Wait! He's on the line.

459
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,513
- You're late. We're waiting for you!
- He's not here.

460
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,116
I know it's you. Quick!
Get that witness here.

461
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,193
What was your duty on that day?

462
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,636
I was observing the squatter huts
behind the site.

463
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,269
The suspects were trying to escape,
and I arrested two of them.

464
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,395
Thank you!

465
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,751
Can I ask the witness a question?

466
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,835
Inspector Kim, you said
you saw the suspects escaping.

467
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,390
Did they pass in front of you
one by one?

468
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,756
Or did you have a special device

469
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,753
to allow you see them escaping
at the same time?

470
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,868
I object! The question
played with the witness's wording.

471
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,995
Overruled!

472
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,872
Thank you! No more questions!

473
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,750
Bring on the next witness.

474
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,670
- That's my spot.
- I'm in a hurry!

475
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,518
I want that space!

476
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,274
Nice parking, though.

477
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,154
What?! She's gone?
What have you been up to?

478
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,800
- Now what? We might lose.
- I don't know.

479
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,150
How could you be so sure that one of
the escaping suspects was my client?

480
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,678
He had the same clothes.

481
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,639
In other words, you didn't have a
clear view of the suspects' faces.

482
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,633
I would say so.

483
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,394
- Are you short-sighted?
- No, I'm not.

484
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,710
All right. No more questions.

485
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,676
Next witness.

486
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,479
I swear to tell the truth.

487
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,559
I was at the squatter huts
for the operation.

488
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,428
The first, second, third
and fourth defendants opened fire.

489
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,999
I saw them jump on a bus.

490
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,719
So I took a short cut
and went down the hill.

491
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,952
A citizen helped me
to stop the bus with his car.

492
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,556
After the bus stopped,
I arrested the first defendant.

493
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,518
He tried to bribe me, but I refused.

494
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,555
That'll do.

495
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,279
That was very clear. Thank you!

496
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,709
You were at the squatter house.

497
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,916
- What time was that?
- About 6:00 a.m.

498
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,195
- What time exactly?
- 5:55 a.m.

499
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,554
Let's say 6:00 a.m.

500
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,518
In December in Hong Kong,
sunrise is at 6:23 a.m.

501
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,354
- Did you know that?
- I didn't know.

502
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,556
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

503
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,030
Do you know the saying
"Darkness before dawn"?

504
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,075
No, I don't.

505
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,712
The saying means that it's dark
before the sun rises.

506
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,109
- I might have heard of it.
- All right.

507
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,555
If there wasn't much light,

508
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,474
should we believe
you could actually see my client?

509
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,790
Believe what you like.
I did see him.

510
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,070
You said you ran down the hill
to stop the bus.

511
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:38,029
- Was the bus always in sight?
- Yes.

512
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,156
- Why hesitate?
- I was thinking.

513
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,753
You have doubts?!

514
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,553
Don't hound him.
Rephrase the question.

515
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,393
How long did it take you
to go down the hill?

516
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,119
And was the bus always in sight?

517
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,590
For a while my view
was blocked by the hill.

518
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,993
Could it be that another bus
overtook the first one at that point?

519
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,514
- There was only one bus!
- You're lying!

520
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,312
Sustained!
Defence should rephrase his question.

521
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,590
- Could you be mistaken?
- No!

522
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,593
There are four different bus routes
on that road.

523
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,309
On two routes,
the buses run every five minutes.

524
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,868
The other two,
the buses run every six minutes.

525
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,555
So 88 buses run back and forth
on that road every hour.

526
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,474
- That's more than one bus a minute.
- So what?

527
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,950
How long did it take you
to go down the hill?

528
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,473
About two minutes.

529
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,437
- Exactly?
- Two and a half minutes.

530
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,910
So at most eight or nine buses
could have passed by.

531
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,878
But you said there was one.
I say you're lying.

532
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,633
Don't you know the buses
are always late?

533
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,352
All right. Let's give you
the benefit of the doubt.

534
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,752
Assume there was one bus
and you could see it all the time.

535
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,037
Which part was clearly visible
to you?

536
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,111
- The body.
- How much of the body?

537
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,668
- All of it!
- You're lying!

538
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,594
What's he doing?

539
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,310
You could see only one side of
this bus. At most, only half of it.

540
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,517
You couldn't see the other half.

541
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,511
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

542
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:24,515
And anything could have happened
on the side you couldn't see.

543
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,957
So if someone jumped off,
you couldn't see him, could you?

544
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,429
- No.
- Speak louder.

545
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,715
I could have jumped off, he couldn't.

546
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,711
Just answer the question.

547
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,236
I mean it!
You try jumping from a moving bus!

548
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,515
Control yourself!

549
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,034
- He tried to bribe me.
- Why would he do that?

550
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,680
He offered me money to let him go.

551
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,072
If it was you and someone pointed
a gun at you, what would you do?

552
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,269
Objection overruled! Answer him!

553
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,471
- I'd give him all my money.
- That's what happened to my client.

554
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,711
- Am I right?
- No, I'd already identified myself.

555
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,997
There are many cases where
criminals pose as policemen.

556
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,999
Sustained!

557
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,993
Court will ignore that remark.
Confine yourself to this case.

558
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,433
I'm sorry!

559
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:19,230
Consider this, a businessman is
carrying company cash on a bus.

560
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,438
A policeman chasing robbers stops
the bus and points a gun at him.

561
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,318
So the businessman thinks
the policeman is a crook.

562
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,359
So he tells the policeman
to take the cash and let him go.

563
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,715
Inspector Chan, isn't that right?

564
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,591
The witness needn't answer.

565
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,271
We already know the answer.
He doesn't need to say it. I conclude.

566
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,675
Wonderful!

567
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,432
- Now what?
- I know what to do.

568
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,112
He'll get off the hook.

569
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,234
Your Honour, we request
an adjournment.

570
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,833
Our prime witness was delayed.

571
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,869
The Crown has failed
to establish a case.

572
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,872
There is insufficient evidence
to convict my client.

573
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,315
- I request a dismissal.
- Your Honour.

574
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,358
We have taped evidence
from our witness.

575
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,590
Tapes can't be accepted as evidence.

576
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,352
That tape is key to this case.

577
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,635
I will not adjourn
or postpone the hearing.

578
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,188
That would be unfair
to the defendant.

579
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,909
I will grant him bail.
But we will hear that tape first.

580
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,116
This case is not over yet.

581
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,792
Please turn up the volume.
It's a cheap tape.

582
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,870
Wait! I didn't erase that.
Just let it play!

583
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,759
It's coming up!

584
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,518
Oh, you! That hurt!

585
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:26,434
- What did I do?
- You really poked me!

586
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,033
You're breaking it!
Don't push too hard!

587
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:37,114
- What an ugly thing! Go away!
- It's the only one I got.

588
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,758
It's only a cactus!

589
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,714
You got me all wet!

590
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,551
- Let me wipe it for you.
- Please, no more! No, don't!

591
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,518
That was only orange juice!

592
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,194
That wasn't what you think.

593
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,395
The sofa's hard. It's not very comfy.
Let's go to bed now.

594
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,597
- Let's go to bed.
- But where can I sleep?

595
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,193
On my bed.

596
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,953
- And you?
- Next to you.

597
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,634
You're so protective. It's exciting!

598
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,911
Come on!

599
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,393
Please stand back.

600
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,195
No photographs!

601
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,679
Ka-kui!

602
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,438
I want a written report.

603
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,312
Boss!

604
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,636
No pictures!

605
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,150
John, reserve a room
at the country club.

606
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,800
We're going to celebrate.

607
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,555
- I'm leaving now.
- Thank you very much!

608
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,478
Next time let's hire him
as prosecutor.

609
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,518
This is Crime Story.
I'm so happy to see you all again.

610
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,559
Our guest today is
a brave police officer.

611
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,236
Sitting next to me is
Inspector Chan Ka-kui.

612
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,914
- Hello!
- Hello! Hello everyone!

613
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,710
After cracking down on the biggest
drug racket in Hong Kong,

614
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,110
you've become very popular
amongst the people.

615
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,159
Would you share this particular
experience with us?

616
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,958
The success of this operation
was due to team work.

617
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,399
I was just a part of it.

618
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,233
We were well prepared for
the operation.

619
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,918
What makes your department so special
in the police force?

620
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,677
To be one of us, you have to be
strong, alert, smart, and...

621
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,399
- Boss.
- What's up?!

622
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:06,110
His photo is all over
the papers and magazines.

623
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,749
He's even been nominated
for some awards.

624
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,432
"Brave Policeman Arrests Drug Tycoon"

625
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,031
And our Thai source is out of stock.

626
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,190
What? Are they crazy?

627
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,193
They've sold everything to Uncle Joe.

628
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,679
They want hard cash.

629
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,157
Boss, Mr Cheung is here.

630
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,231
Please come in.

631
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,909
Mr Chu, I've received your cheque,
thanks a lot!

632
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,638
I should thank you!

633
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,038
How's my case now?

634
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:48,796
All evidence must remain
with the court until the case ends.

635
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,552
What does that include?

636
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,918
Your passport and bank account.
You can't use them now.

637
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,834
If you're found guilty,
your assets will be confiscated.

638
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,037
And besides,
the bastards could jail me.

639
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,317
- Phone call for you, boss.
- Excuse me!

640
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,835
Salina.

641
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,514
It's boring here.
I want to go somewhere else.

642
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,919
Not just yet.

643
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,833
- Can I come and see you?
- Not now.

644
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,754
You should stay where you are.
The police are looking for you.

645
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,400
I'm planning a trip to Europe
for you.

646
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,233
Once you're there, you'll be fine.

647
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,038
You just have to wait.

648
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,076
It's for your own good.

649
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,190
- Where were we?
- We were lucky to bail you out.

650
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,955
It would have been different
if they had found Salina.

651
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,918
I doubt they'll ever
be able to find her.

652
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,356
Very well. I must leave. See you.

653
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,391
Your lawyer is right.

654
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,950
Salina's a big problem.
You can't hide her forever.

655
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,912
Snake Eyes says that stupid cop
is looking for Salina everywhere.

656
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,118
- We should send her abroad.
- On a one-way ticket.

657
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,995
Let's use that stupid cop
to kill Salina.

658
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:27,593
Be sensible. Chicks like her
aren't difficult to get.

659
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,712
Inspector Man wants to see you.

660
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,074
Let him in.

661
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,512
You paid him off, didn't you?

662
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,037
Yes, I did. But he says he wants
to retire and start a business.

663
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,680
- What does that mean?
- He wants more money!

664
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,876
This way, Inspector Man.

665
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,235
- Hello!
- Hello.

666
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,799
- Sit down.
- I'm OK.

667
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,077
- I came to see you about...
- Yes, I know.

668
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,596
You want to retire
and start a business. Good idea.

669
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,071
- Thanks for your money.
- I know you're a smart guy.

670
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,232
- But I want one more favour.
- What is it?

671
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,676
I want Chan Ka-kui to disappear
for good.

672
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,590
You want to be a hero.
I'll make you a tragic hero.

673
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,471
I'll book you for that!

674
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,879
"Superintendent"

675
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,711
Hi, there! Follow me.

676
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,628
Inspector Chan!

677
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,393
If anything happens,
you can reach me...

678
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,435
...on the pager?

679
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,829
- ...at home.
- But you're on patrol.

680
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,712
That doesn't mean
I can't pass by my house.

681
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,759
Excuse me!

682
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:21,317
I'm going to the toilet,
you stay here.

683
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,436
Don't stay there for too long.

684
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,713
Hello, Police Station.

685
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,791
You called, Inspector Chan?

686
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,314
Of course, any news?

687
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,791
On Salina? I need more time.
It's not easy, you should know.

688
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,030
Then you won't get paid.

689
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,998
I know. I'm doing my best.

690
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,958
What? Wait a second!

691
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,311
Police Station, hold the line.

692
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,032
- Three more days, Snake Eyes.
- What?

693
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,272
That's not enough time.

694
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,590
What? I'll give you four days.

695
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,717
Or you'll be in trouble,
when I get back to town.

696
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,870
I'm hanging up now! All right?!

697
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,473
- Can I help?
- I've been waiting for ages.

698
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,750
You want to speak to Inspector Chan?
Hold on.

699
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,674
- Phone, Inspector Chan.
- Right, thanks!

700
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,474
- Hello, this is Inspector Chan.
- It's me.

701
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,951
- Who was that?
- That rude guy?

702
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,033
Didn't I tell you to be polite
on the phone?! You're so rude!

703
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,279
I'm really sorry!

704
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,758
Right. I just told him off.

705
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,513
- How's it going?
- What are you doing now?

706
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,275
Now? Now I'm talking to you.

707
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,669
- Have you had lunch?
- Not yet.

708
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,398
I'm cooking some noodles.

709
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,040
- Have you eaten, then?
- No.

710
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,636
Wait a minute.

711
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,711
Police Station, hold the line.

712
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,395
I'm back.

713
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,153
Mum wants to have dinner with us
on Sunday.

714
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,152
Is that so?
That sounds great. Hold on.

715
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,071
- Police Station.
- My husband...

716
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,469
- Your husband what?
- He's beating me up.

717
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:14,109
- Who's beating who up?
- My husband's beating me up!

718
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:18,352
Don't cry. I'll put you through
to a different department.

719
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,955
I'm coming on Sunday, wait a sec.

720
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,315
The line's busy.

721
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,311
Police Station, how can I help?

722
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,391
- I'm missing a cow.
- Hold the line.

723
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,917
I'll get you the right department.
The line's still busy.

724
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,638
- Police Station.
- I was raped!

725
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,280
Really?!
I have to write down the details.

726
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,033
When were you raped?

727
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,429
I wasn't raped,
but my husband's mad.

728
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,478
Oh! It's you,
I'm still connecting your call.

729
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,791
- It's taking so long!
- This is a big police station. Wait!

730
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,188
Who's been raped?

731
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,350
- Me!
- I'm missing a cow!

732
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,714
Hold the line.

733
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,268
- When were you raped?
- Last year!

734
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,237
Why didn't you report it?

735
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,869
- Are there any pills I can take?
- Pills?!

736
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,552
I'll find out for you.

737
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,877
- Hello, Police Station.
- I'm missing a cow.

738
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,999
All right. But you need to bring in
a photo of the cow first.

739
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:26,353
May, I'm very busy. She wants me
to name a place for dinner?

740
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,158
Give me a minute first.

741
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,833
- Where shall we go?
- The Family Planning Clinic.

742
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,151
Take a double portion
of contraception pills.

743
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,153
Tell your own mum to take
contraception pills!

744
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,037
What?! May!

745
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,236
I was saying that to someone else.

746
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,874
My mum doesn't need those pills.

747
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,954
- Police Station.
- I'm testing the line, bye!

748
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,155
What?!

749
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,989
- Stuck in traffic?
- No, not traffic.

750
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,399
You're late.

751
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,597
If the roads were congested,
I wouldn't be here at all.

752
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,434
You're having dinner with us.
Mum hates it when anyone's late!

753
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,990
I've been waiting all day
for Snake Eyes to phone.

754
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,640
You're off that case.
Forget about it.

755
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,835
I can't.

756
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,678
I need to make a phone call.

757
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,517
Hold on to the car.

758
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,672
The hand brake doesn't work.
Don't let go.

759
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,556
It's me, Snake Eyes.

760
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:17,077
Chu Tu's hiding that witness you're
looking for in his Kowloon villa.

761
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,720
You sure?

762
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,509
Better hurry.
They don't plan to keep her alive.

763
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,794
Is it true?

764
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,678
Would I lie to you? Hurry up!

765
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,109
Are you coming?!

766
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,875
That was Snake Eyes.
I know where they're hiding Salina.

767
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,475
Don't go!

768
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,791
If Chu Tu kills her, he'll go free.

769
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,394
I've got to save her.
I can't let her die.

770
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,391
- What's up?
- Your car!

771
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,269
- What now?!
- Taxi!

772
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:01,478
Call someone to tow the car away.
And say sorry to your mum for me.

773
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,637
Be careful!

774
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,477
- Keep the change.
- Thanks!

775
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,630
- What happened?
- I don't know what they're up to.

776
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:29,508
- Is anyone else here?
- No one. They just disappeared.

777
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,795
Now you know what Chu Tu is like.

778
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,668
If you had listened to me,
you wouldn't be in danger.

779
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:41,036
It's lucky I got here.
Otherwise, you'd be dead.

780
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,511
Let's get out of here.

781
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,113
Stop!

782
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,553
Freeze!

783
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,359
Step aside.

784
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:52,592
- How did you know I was here?
- I have my ways.

785
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,790
- You can't be...
- Surprised?!

786
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,469
That's not the only surprise.

787
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,516
We were supposed to kill him.

788
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,317
That's right.

789
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,871
The boss wants us to use
a police gun. One cop kills another.

790
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,916
What a perfect set-up!

791
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,878
Who's killing who?

792
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,198
Let's get out of here!

793
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,709
No!

794
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,074
I can't do it!

795
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,033
No!

796
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,429
Jump!

797
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,999
Move it!

798
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,793
Stop!

799
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,799
Go get her!

800
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,074
You little prick!

801
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,959
We'll teach you.
You'll wish you'd never interfered.

802
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,519
That's enough!

803
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,038
Take care of him. I'll go down.

804
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,800
Ka-kui didn't shoot Inspector Man.

805
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:44,271
We can't take your word for it.
Where did he go with his gun?

806
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:48,353
The bullet that killed Man was fired
from Ka-kui's gun.

807
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:52,718
Policemen make lots of enemies.
Someone is trying to frame Ka-kui.

808
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,156
If it were anyone else but Ka-kui,
would you feel the same?

809
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,753
You're our boss.

810
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,833
Don't always go by the book!
Show some feelings for your men.

811
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,789
I don't want people thinking
if a cop kills, he gets away with it.

812
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,394
There'll be no cover up!
One law for all.

813
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,517
You want to nail him
even more than the crooks!

814
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,113
Enough!

815
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,195
If you were me, what would you do?

816
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,396
Hi, May.

817
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,634
I know.

818
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,678
I'll wait for you.

819
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,553
"One Cop Kills Another"

820
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,153
"Policeman Is Killed"

821
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,832
What should we do?

822
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,196
My mum is really worried about you.

823
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,629
Ka-kui, be careful!

824
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,912
Ka-kui's back!

825
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,639
- Ka-kui!
- Ka-kui!

826
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,312
Ka-kui!

827
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,114
- I didn't kill him.
- We believe you.

828
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,395
But where have you been?

829
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,432
I don't know.

830
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,957
You must remember something.
Were you drunk or with your girlfriend?

831
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,351
I was fighting Chu Tu's men.

832
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,238
Inspector Man appeared
and pointed his gun at me.

833
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:38,551
They took my revolver
and shot Man with it.

834
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,835
That's all I remember.

835
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:41,909
Nothing else?

836
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,755
You disliked Man,
and the bullet was from your gun.

837
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,799
I wouldn't kill him over
some petty differences.

838
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,314
Who would believe that?
We must have proof!

839
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,118
That's how the law works.

840
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,991
- But I'm glad you're back.
- Give me your gun.

841
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,471
Call Homicide.
Tell them we have the suspect.

842
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:13,196
Ka-kui, don't worry.
We'll do our very best to help you.

843
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,515
Lock him up.

844
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,478
And charge him... with murder.

845
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,637
How could you?!

846
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,593
Freeze!

847
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,195
- Ka-kui, what are you doing?
- I didn't kill anyone!

848
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,512
- Don't you believe me?
- I believe you.

849
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,353
But based on the evidence,
I must charge you.

850
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,592
Can't you see I was framed?
You're bloody stupid!

851
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,399
I'll conduct
a very thorough investigation!

852
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,994
- Don't give me that!
- Let him go!

853
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,429
Fine!

854
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:56,479
- What you are doing is dangerous!
- Dangerous for him!

855
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,633
While we risk our lives out there,
he's sitting back thinking of chicks.

856
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:04,315
We've arrested so many bad guys,
but he's never satisfied.

857
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,437
And that stupid idea of protecting
the witness.

858
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,794
So easy?!

859
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,270
You only have to open your mouth
and we have to risk our lives!

860
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,793
- Ka-kui!
- Shut up!

861
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,908
You got promoted at our expense.
Have you ever thought of us?

862
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,072
If any of us dies,
you need only write a report

863
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,912
and turn up for the funeral.

864
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,560
We have families, too.

865
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,758
If it wasn't for us, you'd never have
this office and all this other crap!

866
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:31,875
Get back!

867
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,312
Come any closer
and I'll blow his head off!

868
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,753
Ka-kui, don't do that!

869
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,031
Open the door!

870
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:41,795
Don't move!

871
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,193
Don't push me!

872
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,794
Keep back!

873
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,032
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doing!

874
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,353
Ka-kui's holding the Super hostage!

875
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,115
Calm down!

876
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,315
Stay cool! Ka-kui, calm down.

877
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,275
Stay back!

878
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,676
- Ka-kui, calm down.
- Let's talk about this.

879
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,352
We'll sort this out.

880
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,874
Put your hands on the table.

881
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,473
Now!

882
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,199
You're being stupid.

883
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:24,114
Give up before it's too late!
We'll help you.

884
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,760
Trust us! We'll sort this out.

885
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,513
I trust all of you,
but I can't depend on you.

886
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,955
- You're making it worse!
- Stop!

887
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,155
Don't move!

888
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,912
Don't push him!

889
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:45,716
Don't push him.
Call in the snipers. Alert all units.

890
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,197
Easy, everybody!

891
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,519
Ka-kui!

892
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,231
Get in!

893
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,596
- Ka-kui!
- Drive out.

894
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,873
Let them go!

895
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,708
Don't go after them!

896
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,639
Where are we going?

897
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,113
Stop.

898
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,152
Get out.

899
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,513
I wouldn't have shot
even if you had run.

900
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,397
I know.

901
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,314
I'm not sure how to help you,
but you'll have a head start.

902
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,789
They'll start hunting for you
once I get back.

903
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,756
I'll get Chu Tu
before your men get me.

904
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:18,312
- I hope so.
- Thank you, sir.

905
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,754
No one knows where this Salina is.

906
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:30,395
Let's get a couple of chicks
and have some fun.

907
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:50,877
I didn't set you up, Inspector Chan!
It wasn't me. I had no part in it!

908
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,154
It's for you.

909
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:02,115
I'll have it then. I'm starving.

910
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,633
Boss, I heard that stupid cop
is on the run.

911
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,312
Wasn't he arrested?

912
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:05,393
- He's run away!
- He's got some nerve!

913
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,234
We should have killed him, too,
once and for all.

914
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,035
Where is Salina?

915
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,429
Mad Wing and Snake Eyes
are looking for her.

916
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,078
We've heard nothing from them.

917
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,958
Salina could be with that stupid cop.

918
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:25,915
What's up, boss?

919
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,357
Someone's stealing my data.

920
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,512
- Who is it?
- It must be Salina.

921
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,830
Only she knows the password.

922
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,672
- Go get her.
- Alert our men.

923
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:41,749
Call Mr Cheung.

924
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,950
- How long do we need to wait?
- You're impatient.

925
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:03,589
I'm not, but I'm scared.

926
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,672
You two stay here.

927
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,588
Up there.

928
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,398
Call Inspector Chou!

929
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,393
Get that briefcase
or we're doomed! Quick!

930
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,709
That way!

931
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,991
- Ka-kui!
- Why didn't you go to the police?

932
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,957
Chu Tu's men are here.

933
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,589
- You witnessed Man's murder.
- I've got evidence on Chu Tu.

934
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,952
They're here!

935
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,795
Take her back to the office. Quick!

936
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,073
What's going on?

937
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,668
Let's go.

938
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:53,993
- Come on!
- I'm not going.

939
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,228
Kill him!

940
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,592
Catch!

941
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,552
It's there! Go and get it!

942
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,198
- May!
- Are you all right, Ka-kui?

943
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,840
Don't worry about me.
Get the briefcase!

944
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:34,435
Go to hell!

945
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,358
Chu Tu!

946
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,675
Quick!

947
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,158
Hurry!

948
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,589
- Ka-kui, stop!
- Don't do it!

949
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,593
- Put that down.
- We'll sort this out!

950
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:34,990
- This is between him and me.
- He's not worth it.

951
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,629
There's no justice. I have to take
the law into my own hands.

952
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:43,316
- Don't do anything foolish.
- I'm going to kill him right here.

953
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:46,039
It was Danny Chu
who killed Inspector Man.

954
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:49,669
All the evidence
is in the briefcase.

955
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,675
Are you all right?

956
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,469
May is hurt, Ka-kui.
Take care of her first!

957
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,273
Take all the suspects
back to the station!

958
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:10,193
You're abusing your power
as police officers.

959
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,998
You're hurting innocent people.

960
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:16,437
You're not above the law.
Justice is for everyone.

961
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:23,278
I'm going to sue you for kidnapping,
threatening and assaulting my client.

962
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,272
I'm not going to let you
get away with this!

963
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,157
You lot are a menace to society!

964
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,235
- He just proved it.
- Ka-kui, let go of him.

965
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:35,834
- This is entrapment!
- You're going to jail.

966
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,229
How dare you treat a lawyer
like that?

967
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,709
We're so glad you're here, Mr Cheung!

968
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,910
You'll have to help me
with that report.

969
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,594
- Pardon?
- Let's write it together.

970
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:07,830
I didn't see anything.

971
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,348
That's enough!
