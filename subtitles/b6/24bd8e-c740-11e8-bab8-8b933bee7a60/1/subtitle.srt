1
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:04,790
One, two, three,
four, five, six

2
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,533
Seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve

3
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:18,602
Okay.

4
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,822


5
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,824
--auditions for Miss Jackson
step rehearsals.

6
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:49,598
Step rehearsals will meet
in room 326 after school today.

7
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:07,854
Aww.

8
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:09,855
What is history?

9
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,129
Opposites.

10
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,598
You can read the board.

11
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,598


12
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,601
I'm so happy to hear that.

13
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,601
No, what is it?

14
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,602
What does it mean?
Stace?

15
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,605
Change?

16
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:21,867
Thank you, Stacey.

17
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,869
I'm glad to hear
someone's paying attention.

18
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,613
History is the study
Of change over time.

19
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,875
and what's change?

20
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,617
It's this.
It's opposites.

21
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,882
It's two things that
push against each other
in opposite directions.

22
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,884
So the civil rights movement,
okay, it's essentially,

23
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,626
It's two opposing mentalities.

24
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,663
In the south,
the majority believes

25
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,891
All men are not created equal,
and there's a minority

26
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,894
Who believes that they are,
so that minority struggles

27
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,637
and it fights and it pushes
till eventually

28
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,900
It becomes the majority.

29
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,903
Am I boring you?
Huh?

30
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,647
Let's give you some examples,
okay, of opposing forces,

31
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,910
Like I'm going to go
night and day.

32
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,650
What else?

33
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,651
Big and little.

34
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,654
Good.
Anything else?

35
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,654
Left and right.

36
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:10,916
Left and right, very good.
Stace?

37
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:11,917
Me and you.

38
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,660
You and I.

39
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:16,660
Teacher, student.
Anything else?

40
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:16,922
Mr. Dunn?

41
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,924
Yeah.

42
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,926
Just wondering if you
could count me and Gina's
baldheaded sister as opposites.

43
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,668
Oh, insult.

44
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:27,672


45
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,934
Gina come on, tell me you're not
going to take that?

46
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,677
You got a bald sister?
Is your sister bald?

47
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,712
Give me something.

48
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,940
May 17, 1954.

49
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,683
Oh.

50
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:42,949


51
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,950
and I expect some thought
from you.

52
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,692
I don't want
just dates and facts.

53
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,694
I want to know why.
I want to know consequences.

54
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,697
I want to know what it means.
All right.

55
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,699
Now, back to the bald sister.

56
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,701


57
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:57,701
What's going on with that?

58
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,964
Right.

59
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,705
Left.
Back.

60
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:03,969
Forward.

61
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,711
I'm shooting.

62
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,713
You got your girl open
over here.

63
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,975
She's sending out smoke signals
over here.

64
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,717
She's got the fire.

65
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,984
She's going I got it over here
and you're like--

66
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,760
Come on, get open.
Oh, yeah.

67
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,989
Drey?

68
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,731
You going to put that down
and come play or what?

69
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:30,997
I ain't done yet, Coach.

70
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:32,998
All right, top of the key,
three passes, here we go.

71
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:43,772


72
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,763
Thursday, 11:16 a.m.

73
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,026
Hello, this is Taylor calling
from Consolidated Credit.

74
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,766
This is an urgent message
For Mr. Daniel Dunn

75
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,029
Regarding your
outstanding balance.

76
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:05,030
Please call me back as soon--

77
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,774
Thursday, 5:25 p.m.

78
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:14,779
Hey, Dan, it's Rachel.
I'm in town for a while.

79
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:20,046
You know, my Mom, anyway,
I know it's been forever,

80
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,788
But I'd really like to see you.

81
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,790
I don't know.

82
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,053
I'll be at my parents
so give me a call, okay?

83
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,055
Bye.

84
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:35,061
Thursday, 5:25 p.m.

85
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,062
Hey, Dan, it's Rachel.

86
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:47,836


87
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,871
I like Oprah.

88
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,135
I love Oprah.

89
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,138
But the thing is I was just
fucking things up just
to fuck them up.

90
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,880
Right, right.
No.

91
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:55,970
You know what I mean?

92
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:56,878
Right.

93
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:57,142
But I was a writer.

94
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:57,972
I hate words.

95
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,142
Yeah.

96
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,887
Right, because everything
that is worth--

97
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:03,887
Right, just forget it.
so you're a teacher?

98
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:13,160
I'm a teacher.

99
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,900
and what am I supposed
To teach them, you know
what I mean?

100
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:16,161
What am I supposed
to teach them?

101
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,903
Right.

102
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:19,903
That's the point,
you know what I mean?

103
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:20,904
Yeah.

104
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:21,166
If you can help one student.

105
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:22,906
Yeah.

106
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:23,168
No, if you can change
One person, right?

107
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,170
If you can change one person--

108
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,172
Then you can change them all.

109
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,036
No, that's not the point.
The point is, if you change one.

110
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,911
I want to dance.

111
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:30,175
Then you can teach them--

112
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:31,176
Do you want to dance?

113
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:32,177
--the rest of the village,

114
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:33,041
The-- what is it?

115
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,915
I want to dance.

116
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:40,221
Let's dance.

117
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:02,981
What's going on, bro?

118
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,210
What's the word?

119
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,952
What's that?

120
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,954
What, this right here?
Mm-hmm.

121
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,217
Some new street shit.

122
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:22,229
Go ahead, man, check it out.

123
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,970
You got to feel that shit.

124
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:26,094
What you think about that?

125
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,229
Yeah, it's not bad.

126
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,233
It's the street shit?

127
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,238
That's the street shit.

128
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,979
So what you need, teach,
another eighth?

129
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,242
I only got 30.

130
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,244
Word.

131
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,986
It's been a long week.

132
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:48,254
You want that other thing?

133
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,997
On may 17, 1954,
The supreme court ruled

134
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,260
On the case of Brown
Versus Board of Education,

135
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,003
Making it illegal for states
to segregate public schools.

136
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,265
This was a major step forward
in the struggle

137
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,268
For racial justice
and helped begin

138
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,010
A flurry of bold
and heroic actions

139
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:16,044
Known as
the Civil Rights Movement.

140
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,034
Get on her.
Sally, get on her.

141
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:40,068
It's all right, Sally.
Come on.

142
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,333
Come on.

143
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:18,106
Ballgame, ladies.
Ballgame.

144
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:42,369
Okay.
Good job.

145
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,372
I like our chances
Against Saint Joseph.

146
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,111
The thing is if we could just
Figure out a way to put the ball

147
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,375
In the hoop it would be fine.

148
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,118
Stace, good job tonight.

149
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,380
Thank you.

150
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,382
You did a great job.
Is there anyone else in there?

151
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,124
No, that's it.

152
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,124
Thanks for tonight.

153
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:06,995
All right.
Bye, Mr. Dunn.

154
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,403
What are you doing here?

155
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:19,404
Came to check out
Some basketball.

156
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:24,148
I heard this was the place.

157
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:28,152
We need a little work,
But we're having fun so, yeah.

158
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,159
How are you?

159
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,423
Same old, same old.

160
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,164
I'm happy to see you.

161
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:45,431
It's good to see you too.
You look good.

162
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,173
Come on, I got fat.

163
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:59,173
Oh, I know, but it looks great.
You look healthy.

164
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,445
Do you want to go get some--

165
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,448
I can't.
I got to--

166
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:03,448
Just like a quick coffee.
I just want to--

167
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,450
To get some coffee?

168
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,452
Yeah.

169
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,457
I can't tonight.

170
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,459
Do you want to do it
Another night?

171
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:24,470
Okay.

172
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:35,243
Hey, how's your Mom?

173
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:46,254
Did you get my messages?

174
00:12:54,306 --> 00:13:03,510
Hello?
I'm coming in.

175
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:14,282
Anyone?

176
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:35,363


177
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:46,409


178
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:06,394
Somebody in there?

179
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,386
Oh, sorry.

180
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:29,656
That's okay.

181
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:36,401
It's okay.
I'm fine.

182
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:41,667
I'm sorry.

183
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:46,672
Are you okay?

184
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:57,445
Can you help me up?

185
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,699
Are you okay?

186
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,440
Yeah.

187
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:21,445
Okay, good.

188
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:29,716
It's gonna be fine.

189
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:39,453
Some water?

190
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:49,497
I'm sorry, but I'm fine.

191
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:12,758
Just don't go, okay,
Just for a minute?

192
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,762
Just for a minute?

193
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:27,535


194
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:49,592
See you tomorrow?

195
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:29,597


196
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:15,678


197
00:19:56,728 --> 00:20:06,694


198
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:43,708
Hey, kiddo.

199
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,970
How's Darrel's leg healing?

200
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:47,972
I don't know.

201
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,975
You didn't go to the hospital?

202
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,980
No.

203
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,721
Did your father pick you up
from practice last night, Drey?

204
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,724
No.

205
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,987
Fucking shit.
How did you get home?

206
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:03,988
Mr. Dunn.

207
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:04,989
Who?

208
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,731
Coach.

209
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,734
I'm tired of this.
Something has got to change.

210
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,996
I don't know what.

211
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:17,002
You don't got to worry about me.

212
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,003
Oh, look at you, Miss 12.

213
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,005
Thirteen, I'm 13 now.

214
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,748
Oh, so you grown, huh?

215
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,750
Going to take care of yourself,
Is that it?

216
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,013
Pretty much.

217
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:30,810
Well, that's a relief.

218
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:39,763
I guess I ain't got to cook up
these burgers then, huh?

219
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,026
Hey, Mom, you know this dude
Cesar Chavez
on Spanish Six?

220
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,028
Cesar who?

221
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:48,772
Cesar Chavez.
He once fasted for 35 days.

222
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,775
That means he didn't eat
For 35 days,

223
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:52,036
Something like Gandhi
Used to do.

224
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,038
Mm-hmm.

225
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:55,778
Think you could do that?

226
00:21:55,847 --> 00:22:05,813


227
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:08,052


228
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,054
Hi, honey, it's Mom.

229
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:20,828


230
00:22:53,939 --> 00:23:01,846
Hello?
Hi, um, is Rachel there?

231
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:11,879


232
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:22,128


233
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,869
Well, I feel good today.

234
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,134
Anyone else feel good?
Hmm?

235
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:35,140
I need a volunteer, and I need
somebody who feels strong.

236
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,882
So what we've got here
Is two opposing forces,

237
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,885
Terrence and myself, and we're
pushing against each other.

238
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,148
and as long as one is stronger--
and it looks like it's t--

239
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:48,892
The change is slow
and consistent.

240
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,690
But once the other side
becomes stronger,

241
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,162
There's a turning point.

242
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,164
Thank you, T.
Make sense?

243
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,166
Okay.

244
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,909
Now, turning points
can happen like that.

245
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:14,942
They can be physical, or they
can happen on a greater scale,

246
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,181
Like a war or something.

247
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:21,186
So why don't you do me
a favor and write

248
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,927
Three examples
Of historical turning points

249
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:32,198
That we've talked about
in class, okay?

250
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,199
What's up?

251
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:45,973
Have you even opened the
Civil Rights binder I gave you?

252
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:54,948
The Civil Rights binder
I have opened,

253
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,961
and it's got some great stuff
in it.

254
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,964
I think it's great.
Yeah.

255
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,226
I'm just providing
a little general content--

256
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:07,232
I need you on the civil rights
Section by next week.

257
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:08,971
Nice seeing you.

258
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:19,006
Is that gum in your mouth?

259
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,257
He was a Gemini.
He was so cocky.

260
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,999
Every day I saw him he used
to go like, oh,
you happy you got me.

261
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,261
You happy you got me,
and I be like,

262
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,264
Please you the one that's got
me, so y'all like Geminis?

263
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,006
Oh, what's his name?

264
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,269
Mr. Easton and Mrs. Wright
In the movie theater.

265
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,271
I'm pretty sure
they're married.
No.

266
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,273
I don't, they can't.

267
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,013
You don't know what you're
talking about, so don't talk.

268
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,014
No, but they look
weird together.

269
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,015
Y'all think Mr. Dunn is married?

270
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:53,277
No way.

271
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:54,278
Nobody would marry him.

272
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,020
Would you want to marry him?

273
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,020
Come in the room,
swirling his finger around,

274
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,021
Telling us to move the desk.

275
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,024
Why can't he move the desk?

276
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,026
I'm getting tired of that
every morning.

277
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,288
Don't forget about his glasses.

278
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,290
and he--
--bifocals.

279
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:10,295
--he start
Throwing them around,
throwing the chalk

280
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,069
Like he all cool and fly
and everything, but--

281
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:12,203
Ridley?

282
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,295
Quiet.

283
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:14,298
Would you marry Mr. Dunn,
Ridley?

284
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,041
Would you marry your father?
Oh.

285
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,043
"a man who was curious to know
If a knife could penetrate

286
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,305
"his bulletproof vest
Was killed yesterday

287
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,045
"by a stab wound to the chest.

288
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,309
"witnesses say the man,
Jeff Turner, 32,

289
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:32,056
"urged his brother,
Scott Turner, 35, to stab him

290
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:36,321
"as hard as he could, believing
The vest would stop the knife.

291
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:45,331
It didn't."

292
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,332
So how's
Your opposite somethings?

293
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,074
Pretty good.

294
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,337
Where'd you come up
with that stuff?

295
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,339
It's just a little something
I picked up in college.

296
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,341
A little thick
for the eighth grade, no?

297
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,343
Yeah, yeah, well, you'd think,
but I don't know.

298
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,348
I think they're getting it.

299
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:04,348
I don't know how you get away
With it though.

300
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:09,092
You know,
Drey is so textbook.

301
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,355
How's your book?

302
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,358
Don't ask.

303
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,100
There's always the summer.

304
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,100
Do you want to go?

305
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:21,366


306
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,367
You want to have dinner
with me again?

307
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,372
Okay.
Mm-hmm?

308
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,113
Did you guys hear
that they found

309
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,375
A crack vial in the locker room?

310
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,378
Jesus.

311
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,380
Hmm.

312
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:37,381
Do they know
whose it is?

313
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,124
Whose it is?
Oh, I don't know.

314
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,387
Hey, you know what?
That's a good idea.

315
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,389
We can put it in the lost
and found to see
if anybody claims it.

316
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:56,163
Better yet, why don't we put up
flyers with a picture?

317
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:06,178


318
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,149
What's new?

319
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,413
I don't know.

320
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:16,160
I can't hear you.
Come over here.

321
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,195
That's a nice cap.

322
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,423
Thanks.
It's Mike's.

323
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:25,168
Yeah, I know.
Talk to him lately?

324
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,431
He writes sometimes.

325
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,173
How's he doing in there?

326
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,175
All right, I guess.

327
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,177
Well, if he needs something,
Let me know, all right?

328
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,439
I mean, I know people in there.

329
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:36,440
I could make a call
or whatever, all right?

330
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,183
Okay.

331
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,185
Okay?

332
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,185
Yeah.

333
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:52,185
All right then.

334
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:57,200
What, you thirsty, huh?
You want something to drink?

335
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,462
My bike.

336
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:07,473
Ain't nobody going
to fuck with that bike.

337
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,215
Yo Harvey, this is Drey.
Hey, Tina?

338
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,477
You remember Mike's
little sister, Drey, right?

339
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,252
Oh, hey, sweetie.

340
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,483
Come and sit down.
Let me get that juice for you.

341
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,485
Help yourself.
Come on and sit.

342
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:32,259
I'll be right back.

343
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,535
Yo, pick a hand.

344
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:11,535
Left.

345
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:17,280
Ha, you lose.

346
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,282
Come on.
What's up with that juice?

347
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,545
I'm not thirsty.

348
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,287
Well, don't be a stranger, kid.

349
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,549
You could stop through
and say hello.

350
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:36,323
Yeah.

351
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,567
You saw Frank today?

352
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:54,341
Just ran into him.

353
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:16,601
On September 13, 1971,
1200 Attica state prison inmates

354
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:18,602
Seized control of the prison
and took hostages

355
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,608
To negotiate changes
to their inhumane conditions.

356
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,610
Governor Nelson Rockefeller
ordered a military assault

357
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:31,354
On the prison which killed
29 inmates and 10 hostages,

358
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,617
Every one caused
from police gunshots.

359
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,360
An official commission later
Stated, with the exception

360
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,623
Of Indian massacres
In the late 19th century,

361
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,366
The police assault was
the bloodiest one-day encounter

362
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,369
Between Americans
Since the civil war.

363
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:56,411


364
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:42,425
Unbelievable.
What are you doing?

365
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:50,423
Go sit in the desk.
Ten points off.

366
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,436
Second chances are rare, man.

367
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,440
You ought to take
better advantage of them.

368
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:01,706
Don't let go.
Grab the t-shirt if you need to.

369
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,448
You know, a little elbow here
and there never killed anybody,

370
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,709
You know what I mean?

371
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:10,715
As long as the ref
isn't looking.

372
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,490
Not in my house.

373
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:23,524


374
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,752
It's a nice surprise.
Where's Mom?

375
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,754
Working.

376
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,757
Darrel's uncle came to visit
so I came along with him.

377
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,759
How's Darrel's leg?

378
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,762
It's all right.

379
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,767
It's nice to see you.

380
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,771
Those for me?

381
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,510
Frank's for sending me
some of them nasty peppermints

382
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,511
He always eating.

383
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,774
What is that?

384
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:17,521
I threw them shits out.

385
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,555
So how's the team?

386
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,784
We suck.

387
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,527
and Ma,
still working too hard?

388
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,789
Yeah.

389
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,532
But she all right
for money though.

390
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,535
Frank still looking out?

391
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:32,796
Yeah.

392
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,799
Good.

393
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:41,806
He owes us.

394
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,808
So how come
you never told on him?

395
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:49,552
For what?

396
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,814
Would've made shit
more complicated.

397
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:57,822
and shit was already fucked up
as it is, you know?

398
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,824
That's all in the past, though.

399
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,829
I'm going to get out of here.
You'll see.

400
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,571
I mean, you got Russell Simmons
On the case.

401
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:14,839
Russell Simmons?

402
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:20,583
Look, we'll be all right.

403
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:28,581


404
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:29,853
I have to write
an essay about growing up.

405
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:30,854
If I don't turn it in
by tomorrow

406
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,856
I'm going to fail the course.

407
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,859
Well, that's your problem,
Charles.

408
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,599
My problem is making sure
that you keep an eye on things

409
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:38,862
While I'm gone.

410
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,865
Actually that's also
your problem.

411
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:43,605
You've got a lot
Of problems, Charles.

412
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:49,874
Don't let them get
in the way of your work.

413
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,616
There's a time when
the operation of the machine

414
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,653
Becomes so odious,
makes you so sick at heart

415
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:57,881
That you can't take part.

416
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,624
You can't even passively
take part, and you've got

417
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,887
To put your bodies upon
the gears and upon the wheels,

418
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,890
Upon the levers,
upon all the apparatus

419
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,633
and you've got to make it stop,
and you've got to indicate

420
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,895
to the people who run it,
to the people who own it

421
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:13,897
that unless you're free,
the machine will be prevented

422
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,640
from working at all.

423
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:21,303
What is this machine
that he's talking about?

424
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,235
It's keeping us down.
What is it?

425
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,649
Like robots and stuff, right?

426
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,912
It could be robots.

427
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,655
It could be robots,
but let's say it's a metaphor.

428
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:33,917
He's saying this machine
is keeping me down.

429
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,920
Now, what is that?
What keeps us from being free?

430
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,662
Ms. Drey?

431
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,925
Prisons.

432
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:46,669
Absolutely, absolutely.
Prisons, okay?

433
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:47,669
Prisons are definitely
a part of it.

434
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:47,931
What else?

435
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,674
White.

436
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:51,935
White is definitely
a part of it.

437
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,677
The man.

438
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:54,938
The school.

439
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:56,713
The school, exactly.

440
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:57,940
The whole education system
is part of the machine.

441
00:36:58,749 --> 00:36:59,943
What else?

442
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:01,945
Aren't you the machine then?

443
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,948
Oh, no, you didn't.
What'd you say?

444
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:05,949
Aren't you the machine?

445
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:07,951
You're saying I'm the machine?

446
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,954
Yeah, you're white.
You're part of the school.

447
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:12,956
Oh, yeah,
I guess you got a point.

448
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:14,958
All right,
so I'm part of the machine,

449
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,700
But if I'm part of it
so are you.

450
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,702
You are, too.
we all are.

451
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:19,963
And this is the thing,
remember?

452
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,966
Everything is made
with opposing force.

453
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,708
We may be opposed
to the machine,

454
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,971
But we're still very much
a part of it, right?

455
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,714
I work for the government,
the school, but I'm also

456
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:32,976
Very much opposed
to a lot of its policies.

457
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:33,977
You guys hate coming to school,
right?

458
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,719
Yes.

459
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:36,980
Holler back if you heard me.

460
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,982


461
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:39,983
You hate it,
but you come anyway.

462
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:40,984
Sometimes.

463
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,727
Sometimes, exactly.

464
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,992


465
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:48,992
Yo, what's up?

466
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,734
Where you headed?

467
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:52,734
You look like
you're in a rush.
Hungry?

468
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:52,996
No, I'm cool.

469
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,739
I'm starving.

470
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,742
Come on.
Burger's on me.

471
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,004
So how's school?

472
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,746
It's hard.

473
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:04,007
What's up with basketball?

474
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:05,747
I got a game tomorrow.

475
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:10,014
Word.

476
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,015
Want to come?

477
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:13,016
Your Mom's going to be there?

478
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:14,756
Working.

479
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,020
Pops?

480
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:18,760
Fuck it.
I'll come through.

481
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:25,029
Somebody got to represent.

482
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:30,773
Tina packed some sweets
For Mike last night.

483
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:35,039
Your brother was a good friend,
still is.

484
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,041
That dude was funny.

485
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,783
I mean, he ever showed you
the chicken walk?

486
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,045
The what?

487
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:43,046
The chicken walk.

488
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:48,791
I mean, I can't do it,
But it's like--

489
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,053


490
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,056


491
00:38:53,864 --> 00:39:01,794
--shit was bananas.

492
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:06,070
You know, we used
to work together, right?

493
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:15,080
You ever think about working?

494
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,080
Shit.
I used to work here.

495
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,083
For real?

496
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:25,828
$150 a week.
Hey, Keesha?

497
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:26,828
What's up, hon?

498
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,161
We need two milkshakes, baby.

499
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:54,857
I know I don't sound sincere,
but I mean it.

500
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:54,981
You're going to be great at it.

501
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,856
Thank you.

502
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:57,859
I think I--

503
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:00,123
Why can't I say that sincerely?

504
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,126
Oh, you can.
I went back to school.

505
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,128
Mm-hmm.

506
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:06,925
Environmental Policy.

507
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,868
No, I know, but I think
you're really going to be great.

508
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,873
I believed you
the first time.

509
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,877
I'm just nervous that's all.

510
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,139
How are you?

511
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,882
I don't know.

512
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,148
You still rocking out?

513
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:31,884
When the occasion calls.

514
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:41,928
Yeah.

515
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,911
Who's the lucky guy?

516
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:55,179
I met him in the program.

517
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:59,183
I don't know, Dan.

518
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,924
Some people change.
Some people actually change.

519
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:02,185
Yeah, but not me.

520
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,927
I know.

521
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:07,191
No way.
I'm still an asshole.

522
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:14,198
You're not an asshole.
You're just a big baby.

523
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:21,205
I'm a big asshole baby.

524
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:31,978


525
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,963
Let's go, rebels.

526
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,967
Pass it in.

527
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,969
All right, there you go.

528
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,231
Blue ball.

529
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,233
What is that?
You're killing us.

530
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:51,973
You need to watch yourself.
Another bad call, hear?

531
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,236
Blue ball.

532
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,978
Walk it off, baby,
Walk it off.
Come on, shake it off.

533
00:41:56,046 --> 00:42:00,983
Hustle back.

534
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:11,017
That was a bad call, man.

535
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,997
You okay?

536
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:23,268
Yeah.

537
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,271
You want a ride home tonight
after the game?

538
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:38,044
All right.

539
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:44,288
Foul, foul, call the foul.

540
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,027
Coach, go back to your bench.

541
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:46,289
She pulled her down.

542
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,029
Go back to your bench.

543
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,030
Call the foul.
Call it.

544
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:49,292
Coach, go back to your bench.

545
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,032
Call the foul.

546
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,033
This is fucking bullshit
and you know it.

547
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:52,295


548
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,035
You're gone, coach.

549
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,299
I won't tolerate that language
on my court.

550
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,039
Oh, it's the language
you don't tolerate,

551
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,040
Fucking language, excuse me.

552
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:06,049
I didn't know it was
the language.

553
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:16,082
All right.
Good luck, girls.

554
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:20,324
I think your hand is changing
colors get more ice on it.

555
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:24,066
You should've seen the wall.

556
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,328
I'm telling you, Dunn,
you should've knocked
that nigga out.

557
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,333
You can't go around
knocking people out, you know,

558
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,075
Or throwing balls at them
just because you're upset.

559
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,075
It would've felt good,
though, right,

560
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,339
Felt good to just get it out.

561
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,341
There's other ways
of getting it out.

562
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:44,348
Right.
Like you do?

563
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:50,092
Look, just because you know
that one thing about me,

564
00:43:50,160 --> 00:44:00,126
One thing doesn't make a man.

565
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,106
What?

566
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:08,372
One thing doesn't make a man?

567
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,373
You know I was just talking
about your hand right?

568
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,115
Yeah.

569
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:20,112
Yeah, I knew that.

570
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:25,127
Hey, who was that guy
that was cheering for you?

571
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,389
Do you know him?

572
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:31,395
Not really.
Do you?

573
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:37,139
No.

574
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,139
So we can just keep the whole
punching the wall thing

575
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,402
A secret, right?

576
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:50,176
You don't have to tell anybody,
right?

577
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:17,238
What's up, Santa Claus?
Where you going?

578
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:27,450
Shit.

579
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:38,299


580
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:58,210
I had a good day.

581
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:00,222
Even after the dolphin report,
right?

582
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,485
Even after it says
there are no weapons.

583
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:06,228
There are no WMD programs.
There is nothing.

584
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,228
They do that,
The Pippa study,

585
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,491
That University
Of Maryland thing,

586
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,494
and turns out 72 percent
Of his supporters

587
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,499
Still believe there's WMDs.

588
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:20,242
Seventy-five percent
still believe they're supporting

589
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:24,508
Al Qaeda and so what
the fuck do we do you know?

590
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,509
What do you do?

591
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:30,252
What does one, I'm one man,
what I do, you know?

592
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,515
I used to be so fucked up.

593
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,257
I used to be so fucked up
I was just out there, you know,

594
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:38,260
But I fucking cleaned up.

595
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:46,531
I cleaned up--

596
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,269
For the most part.

597
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,272
I do it now to get by,
but I can handle it.

598
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,275
You know what I mean?

599
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,277
I tried the rehab thing.
I tried it.

600
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:58,280
It didn't work.
It didn't work.

601
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:02,546
You know,
it works for some people.

602
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:13,319
My ex-girlfriend
is getting married.

603
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,560
So it works for some people,
right?

604
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,302
It didn't work for me.

605
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:27,572
The kids keep me focused,
and I--

606
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:38,344


607
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:20,056
Number three:
Change moves in spirals,
not circles.

608
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:27,368
For example, the sun goes up
and then it comes down,

609
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:32,374
But every time that happens
what do you get?

610
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:41,646
You get a new day.
You get a new one.

611
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:47,651
When you breathe, you inhale
and then you exhale,

612
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:52,394
But every single time
that you do that

613
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:57,399
You're a little bit different
than the one before.

614
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:02,404
We're always changing,
and it's important to know

615
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,667
That there are some changes
you can't control

616
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,410
But that there are others
you can.

617
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:14,678


618
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:18,420
Any students who did not turn
in their Hall of Science

619
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,423
Field trip permission slips
must do so by the end
Of the week.

620
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:22,685
Hall of Science
Permission slips are due
in the main office

621
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:31,423
By Friday afternoon.
Thank you.

622
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,436
Hi.

623
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,699
How come you're not eating
with the teachers?

624
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:40,442
Just...

625
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,446
I felt like being alone.

626
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,708
I know what you mean.

627
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,451
You do?

628
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:57,449
Mm-hmm.

629
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,495
All right, Mr. Dunn,
I'll see you later.

630
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:02,726
Enjoy your lunch.

631
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,468
Thank you.

632
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,731
Oh, yeah, do you think
I could get a ride home later?

633
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:09,732
Okay.

634
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:17,742
Okay?

635
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:22,484
Okay.

636
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:32,518


637
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,758
All right.

638
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:40,502
Thanks for the ride.

639
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:41,764
Okay.
Have a good weekend.

640
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:42,765
Bye.

641
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:53,539
Bye.

642
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:10,793
Yo.

643
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:12,795
I lost my key.

644
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:13,796
You lost your key?

645
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,538
What do we do?

646
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,574
I don't know.

647
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:18,801
You want to call
your mother or something.

648
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:20,803
She's an E.M.T.

649
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:26,548
I could page her,
but I don't know.

650
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,811
All right, get in.

651
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:33,180


652
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:44,556
What's up, y'all?
You want some candy?

653
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:45,566
That's all you got?

654
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,832
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
So where your bike at?

655
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:50,833
They stole it.

656
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:52,835
They who?

657
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:57,579
I don't know.
I'm going to find out though.

658
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,842
So what, man.
Y'all just chilling?

659
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:05,849
She lost my key-- her key.

660
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,590
So what, Drey, what?

661
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:08,851
You need a place to stay
'Til your Mom's get home?

662
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,593
No, man, we're cool.

663
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:12,593
Are you cool, Drey?

664
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:17,599
Mm-hmm.

665
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,601
All right.

666
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:24,606


667
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:25,868
What, you don't know him, huh?

668
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:29,873
Who, Frank?

669
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,875
Frank?

670
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:35,617
I thought you said
you didn't know him.

671
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:36,879
Just a guy from
the neighborhood.

672
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:42,624
You know what he does?

673
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,889
Look, I know that I'm
the last person

674
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:51,895
That should be saying this.

675
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:59,904
You don't have
to worry about me.

676
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:09,914
Okay, let me--
Just give me a sec.

677
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:20,652
Wait.

678
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:30,696
Okay.

679
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:33,674
Have a seat.

680
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:37,941
You can watch TV if you want.

681
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:44,948
Make yourself at home.

682
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:49,691
You got them old things?

683
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,693
Records?

684
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:52,955
Yeah.

685
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:57,699
Yeah, little Miss mp3,
I got records.

686
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:07,733
You should check them out.
You might learn something.

687
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,752
Who's this?

688
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,980
My parents and my brother.

689
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,722
Do they still live together?

690
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,988
Yeah.

691
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:28,730
Why you got so many books
about black people?

692
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,993
I got books
about all kinds of people.

693
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:38,001
Can I borrow one?

694
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,743
Yeah.

695
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:46,748
Who's she?

696
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,010
Just an old friend.

697
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,753
What happened to her?

698
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,756
Oh, well, you should
mind your business.

699
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:59,022
You put it up there.

700
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,763
I've seen her before.

701
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:07,030
She was at the game
that night, right?

702
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:14,037
Yeah.

703
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:20,043
You need help in here?

704
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,784
Do you like to cook?

705
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:29,052
Yeah, sometimes, mostly just
for special occasions.

706
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,054
You got a lady
coming over tonight or what?

707
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,796
Yeah.

708
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,058
You must like her a lot.

709
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,060
Yeah, she's all right.

710
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,802
She like you?

711
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,065
I don't know.
I'm hard to like sometimes.

712
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:44,805
That's true.

713
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:49,811
Oh.

714
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,073
Oh, yeah, you just got to,
you mash those up.

715
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:52,813
You mash them up
with your hands.

716
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,077
Get in there and squeeze them.

717
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:58,820
See, what you need
is some jokes.
Women love jokes.

718
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:02,085
Okay.
You got any?

719
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,086
What do you call cheese
that's not yours?

720
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:04,950
What?

721
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:09,829
Nacho cheese.

722
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:10,092
It's yours if you need it.

723
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,095
Absolutely not.

724
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:22,106
That's a funny joke.
Thank you.

725
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:23,105
Hey, coach?

726
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:24,845
Yeah.

727
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:25,846
Can I ask you something?

728
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:35,119
Mm-hmm.

729
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:44,128
What's it like
when you smoke that stuff?

730
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,868
Sorry.

731
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:56,936
No, don't be.
It's all right.

732
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:16,159
Mash them up.

733
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:23,895
Hope you have
a nice date, Mr. Dunn.

734
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:30,902
Hey, thanks for the joke.

735
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,175
So my buddy gets in the car
and the cab driver's like,

736
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:35,177
I'm so sorry I'm late, sir.

737
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,920
I had to kill somebody
On the way here, you know.

738
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:39,955
and he's like, what?

739
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:43,186
He's like, oh, yeah
I kill him, I kill him.

740
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,928
and he's like, what do you,
You, you killed him?

741
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:47,189
He's, like, yeah,
I kill people all the time.

742
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:50,192
I'm killing people,
you know, anybody

743
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,194
Who really kind of mouth off
to me, I fucking kill them, man.

744
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:56,199
Turns out he thinks "kill" is
the word for "punch," right?

745
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:57,199
Uh huh.

746
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:58,200
So he's punching people.

747
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,943
My friend thinks
that he's killing them.

748
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,206
He's terrified and he thinks
that the word for "cement"
is "semen."

749
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:05,981
So he's like well, basically

750
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:06,208
You can't go anywhere in India
without, you know,

751
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,210
stepping on semen.

752
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,213
There's semen everywhere.
There's semen buildings.

753
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:15,218
It's lot of people, you know,
so everything is made of semen,
you know.

754
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:23,227
I didn't say every day.
You're her father.

755
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,227
Today she got locked out
the house.

756
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:26,228
She didn't even
have your number at work.

757
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:37,002


758
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:20,343
Are you a communist?

759
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:25,348
What?

760
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:26,348
I was looking
through your books.

761
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:30,091
"Che in Africa"?

762
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,093
So?

763
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:40,364
"The Communist Manifesto?"

764
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:46,107
If I had a copy of "Mein Kampf"
Would that make me a Nazi?

765
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:51,374
You know, this is really good,
very tasty.

766
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:59,383
You should try it warm.

767
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,178
Well, you don't have
a copy of of "Mein Kampf"

768
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:05,386
But if you did, then yes,
I'd ask you if you were a Nazi.

769
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:07,389
Maybe I'm hiding it.

770
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:11,132
Why would you hide it?

771
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:21,201
'Cause it's just not cool
To be a Nazi anymore, baby.

772
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,411
So what are you doing today?

773
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:34,155
Oh, I got to--

774
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:35,417
It's great you're writing.

775
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:42,164
Yeah, we'll see.

776
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,425
I should let you get to it then.

777
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,427
Yeah, thanks though.
I had a good time.

778
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:56,201
Yeah, me too.

779
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,445
On November 1, 1977,
Harvey Milk was elected

780
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,186
To the San Francisco
City Council.

781
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:06,448
He was the first
Openly gay person

782
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:09,451
To ever be elected
To public office.

783
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,193
A year later he was
assassinated by another member

784
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,456
Of the City Council
Called Dan White.

785
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,198
--reports that Harvey Milk
have been shot and killed.

786
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,200
Dan White claimed he shot Milk
because he ate

787
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,463
too much junk food that day.

788
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:25,468
This would later be known
As the twinkie defense.

789
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,209
Is that for real?

790
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:38,243


791
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:58,561
Drey, Drey, come here.
Where are you going?

792
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:00,562
Home.

793
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,304
I'll give you a ride home.

794
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,566
That's cool.
I got a ride.

795
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,308
I don't really think
you should be riding with him,
do you think?

796
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:10,311
Drey, is everything cool?

797
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:11,311
Everything's okay.
I'm going to take her home.

798
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,312
Is that right?

799
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,315
Yeah.

800
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,317
Is that right, D, huh,
you getting a ride with teach?

801
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,352
No, man.

802
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,583
Drey, Drey, Drey, come here.
Everything's fine.

803
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,324
Have a nice night.

804
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,326
I'm going to take her home,
Okay?

805
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:26,588
Hey, look, man, you know what,
let me introduce myself, huh?

806
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,591
I'm Frank.

807
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:32,333
Come here now, okay?

808
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:33,595
Come here.
Come here.

809
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:34,596
Hey, hey, hey.

810
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:35,597
Coach?

811
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:36,598
You need to take it easy, man.

812
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:37,599
I'm sorry.

813
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:39,339
Come on.

814
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:40,340
Did I hurt you?

815
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:40,602
Didn't mean to.

816
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:44,607
We'll see you later, Teach.
Come on.

817
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:55,380


818
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:04,627
Dunn, right?
Lloyd Dixon.

819
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:07,629
My daughter Paula went
To Jefferson, Paula Dixon.

820
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,632
You taught history, right?

821
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,635
Paula Dixon?

822
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,378
She's in her first semester
At Georgetown, history major.

823
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:24,375
Paula Dixon.

824
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:29,652
You have a good night.

825
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:40,425
Dave?

826
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:51,436
Dave?

827
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:09,420
In Asia the idea that things
are made of opposites,

828
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:10,692
Ying and Yang,
dates back 3,000 years.

829
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,697
That was them saying change
is the only constant,

830
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,438
But that just died in the west.

831
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:20,441
It just couldn't be both,
couldn't be black and white.

832
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:23,706
It would be right and wrong.
It had to be one or the other.

833
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,447
Who am I to say
that Aristotle is wrong, right,

834
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,710
but that doesn't make any sense.

835
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:30,712
These things need each other.

836
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,719
The idea that all
God's creations are "perfect"--

837
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:44,728
So just to suggest that a tree,
it's crooked and it's straight,

838
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,729
It's strong
and it's weak, is to suggest

839
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:51,472
That god created
something imperfect.

840
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,735
They do however
acknowledge it in people.

841
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:58,479
We are sinners, but we can
strive to be good,

842
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:06,477
Just not in nature itself,
I guess.

843
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:09,752
Oh, I've got to go.

844
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:19,763
You guys write down
what's on the board.

845
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,503
"Broward County Florida
Middle schools mistakenly

846
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:25,768
"failed over 6500 students
In June due to what

847
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,770
"later called a computer error.

848
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:34,777
"a school official called the
total count of students affected

849
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:45,550
An insignificant sum."

850
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:53,535
What goes, Danny boy?
How's history?

851
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,570
I can't do it anymore.

852
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:58,539
Oh, I know the feeling.

853
01:07:58,607 --> 01:07:59,801
Hang in there.
Things will get better.

854
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:10,541
And if not,
There's always summer.

855
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:20,585
Don't you have class right now?

856
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,564
Look, look, look,
that's him over there.

857
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:25,566
That ain't even
your bike, though.

858
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:26,566
That's my bike.

859
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:26,828
Oh, I got you.

860
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:28,864
There he go right there.

861
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:31,572
He a little round one too.

862
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,572
This my bike, nigger.

863
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:32,834
What?

864
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:33,835
I said that's my bike.

865
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:35,837
What the fuck you doing
on my bike?

866
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:36,838
I ain't know it was yours.

867
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:38,578
You ain't know it was mines?

868
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:39,579
What you mean
you ain't know it was mines?

869
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:41,582
You always see me on this bike.

870
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:42,582
Sorry.

871
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:46,587
I just didn't know
it was your bike.

872
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:49,852
You hella sorry, nigger.
I should fuck you up.

873
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:56,859
Get off my bike.

874
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:57,859
So what happened, huh?

875
01:08:58,667 --> 01:08:58,860
What?

876
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:00,862
I thought you
Was going fuck him up?

877
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,864
Didn't have to.

878
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:06,607
Oh, shit, okay,
you didn't have to.

879
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:16,676


880
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:48,708
Hey.

881
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,916
Hey.

882
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,918
It's back.

883
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:02,925
Yeah.

884
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:04,926
Did you know my brother?

885
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:10,694
I knew of him, but I didn't,
you know.

886
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:18,680
He wasn't in any of my classes
or anything.

887
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:24,947
You think I could end up
like him?

888
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:35,720
Do you?

889
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,984
He's got a 7-Up in his
Mother fucking--.

890
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:09,720
Hey, what's up, teach?
how's the Dianetics going?

891
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,993
It's Dialectics.
Can I talk to you?

892
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:13,995
What's up?

893
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:17,738
Okay, look, I hate to be this
guy right now, right?

894
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:21,742
Mm-hmm.

895
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,003
But I need you
To stay away from Drey.

896
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,005
Excuse me?

897
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,007
You heard me, okay,
so just do me this solid.

898
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:27,747
All right, man, please?

899
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:29,010
Do you a solid?

900
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,013
You know what I'm saying.
You understand me.

901
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:33,014
Oh, so this is
like stay away from the girl,

902
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:34,754
She's too precious kind of shit?

903
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:35,755
I'm not kidding.

904
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:36,756
Oh, I know.

905
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:39,760
So you understand?

906
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:42,023
Look, man, Drey is my family.
She's my friend, man.

907
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:45,026
All these cats,
these are my friends.

908
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:47,028
and would you like
to be my friend, man?

909
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:48,768
What the fuck is this,
fucking romper room?

910
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:51,772
What the fuck is a romper room?

911
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,034
Are you fucking
listening to me?

912
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:55,036
Why are you
so fucking angry, man?

913
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:56,037
'Cause you are not
listening to me.

914
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:57,038
Look, I'm right here, baby.

915
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,040
Tell me
what you're talking about.

916
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:00,041
I'm telling you
to do something good.

917
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:01,042
Oh.

918
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,045
Are you capable of that?

919
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:08,050
So now we back to the point of
what is white is right, right?

920
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,051
So--

921
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:11,791
Fuck, this has nothing to do
with that and you know it.

922
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,054
--no, no, it's good for Drey
to have somebody

923
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:17,821
Like you looking out for her
Mr. Model A1 fucking citizen.

924
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:27,866
I don't know, I don't know.

925
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:37,079
Fuck.

926
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:41,083
Because I'm supposed
to do something, right?

927
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:51,856
But what am I supposed to do?

928
01:12:52,901 --> 01:13:00,103
Look, man, you want a drink?

929
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:02,877
What?

930
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,105
Motherfucker,
do you want a drink?

931
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:10,113
I mean, are you thirsty?
How that sound?

932
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,114
Okay.

933
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:20,122
You want some candy?

934
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:23,124
Man, don't touch that cat.

935
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:25,866
Hey, y'all this
is teach Dan, man.

936
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:27,128
These are my boys.

937
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:29,130
That's Mike's
little sister Drey,
that's her teach.

938
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,133
What's happening?

939
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,875
You ain't bringing
that shit in my house, man.

940
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:40,882
Put that cat down.
Get your ass out here.

941
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:50,915


942
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:33,196
Dunn, what's going on?

943
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:43,968
I am not now nor have
I ever been a communist.

944
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:53,954
What's happening?

945
01:14:54,022 --> 01:15:03,988
Just in the neighborhood,
thought maybe I'd surprise you.

946
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:11,962
Yeah, it's a surprise.
That's true.

947
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:14,235
You okay?

948
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:15,975
Yeah, I'm good.

949
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:17,238
How about you?
How are you?

950
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:24,246
I'm good, a little tired,
but I'm good.

951
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:27,988
Oh, is it late?

952
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:33,255
Well, you know, what time is it?
2:30, yeah.

953
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:34,994
Oh.

954
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:35,995
Yeah.

955
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,258
Well, you know,
we got class tomorrow.

956
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:44,995
Oh, I forgot about class.
I'm sorry about last time.

957
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:50,272
Okay.
It's okay.

958
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:58,281
Dunn, not right now, okay?
No.

959
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,282
Dunn--
Okay, you're drunk.

960
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:12,056
What are you doing?
Stop it.

961
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:44,064
Well, that was weird.

962
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:49,069
What the fuck was that?

963
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:55,076
I don't know.

964
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:58,078
Listen, feel free
To whatever, you know?

965
01:16:58,146 --> 01:16:59,340
Whatever.
No hard feelings.

966
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:09,352
I completely understand, okay?

967
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:14,094
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow?

968
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,356
Or not, I don't know.

969
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:16,357
It's hard to say really
where I'm going to be.

970
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:25,368
I'm so fucked up right now.

971
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:32,374
I hope you know
I really liked you.

972
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:38,118
I had fun.

973
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:41,383
Not tonight I didn't have fun,
but other nights I had--

974
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:52,156
We had fun, right?

975
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:57,399
Look, I'm bleeding a bit so I'm
using your couch arm thing.

976
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:08,172
I'm gonna wash it, okay?

977
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:19,183
Sorry.

978
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:36,497
What.

979
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:39,239
How's things.

980
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:45,507
Well, how's it look?

981
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:49,249
What do you want?

982
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:55,256
Nothing.

983
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:58,258
Look, you know,
you don't really see other kids

984
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:03,525
Coming up to my car, Drey,
to talk to me.

985
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:08,530
It's, you know,
I'm your teacher.

986
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:12,534
I'm not your friend.

987
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,536
Why don't you go play
with other kids your own age?

988
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:20,280
I'm just trying to be alone.

989
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:27,277
Then be alone then, asshole.

990
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:33,590
Bitch.

991
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:21,604
Hey, I think Henderson
was looking for you.

992
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:26,369
Must be about
the new curriculum, huh?

993
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:33,354
Yeah, no, I'm sure that's it,
but, hey, Dan,

994
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,355
If there's anything else
going on, you know,

995
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:42,625
If you need any help,
you know, anything,

996
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:53,397
You know
we're here for you, pal.

997
01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:07,446
Close the door.

998
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:21,460
Is there something going on
that I should know about?

999
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:29,432
On September 11, 1973,
The CIA helped overthrow

1000
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:33,413
and murder democratically-
Elected Chilean president
Salvador Allende.

1001
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:34,675
The military coup led
To mass disappearances,

1002
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,678
assassinations and tortures
Of thousands

1003
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:40,420
Of Chilean civilians
under the leadership

1004
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:43,423
Of U.S. backed dictator
Augusto Pinochet.

1005
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:45,686
Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger

1006
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:49,691
Said of Allende's 1970
Election, "these issues
are much

1007
01:22:50,498 --> 01:23:00,430
Too important for
the Chilean voters
to decide for themselves."

1008
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:01,440
Danny?

1009
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:01,702
Hi, Mom.

1010
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,705
What happened to your lip?

1011
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:05,707
That's plenty, thanks.

1012
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:09,448
That's good.

1013
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:09,710
So how's the novel?

1014
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:10,711
Let's eat.

1015
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:12,713
You're writing a novel?

1016
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:14,715
It's a kids book
that I haven't started yet.

1017
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:17,457
I love children's books.
What's it about?

1018
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:18,719
Dialectics.

1019
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:22,724
Dialectics.
What is that?

1020
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:29,731
It's a theory that attempts
to explain how change works.

1021
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:30,731
Sounds interesting.

1022
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:34,474
How does change work, Dan?

1023
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,476
Let's save it for dessert, Dad.

1024
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:36,737
So I hear you guys
went to the march.

1025
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:38,739
Yeah, it was really great.

1026
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:40,741
There were like
400,000 people there.

1027
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:43,517
Oh, that's fantastic.

1028
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:44,745
What did they report it
in the press, 200,000?

1029
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:47,487
Danny Glover was there.

1030
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:48,487
Danny Glover,
oh, I like him.

1031
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:50,490
Mm-hmm.

1032
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:50,751
What was that movie
that he was in, honey?

1033
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:52,491
What was that--

1034
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:52,753
Legal Weapon.

1035
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:54,755
Hey, what was his name?

1036
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:56,757
Charles.

1037
01:23:57,565 --> 01:23:58,532
Charles, get your fat ass
off my bike,

1038
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:00,498
That's what she said,
before I fuck your fat ass up.

1039
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,502
You said that?

1040
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,765
You know she did,
then my man started stressing.

1041
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,768
He start apologizing.
"I'm sorry.

1042
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:08,769
I didn't know it was yours.
I'm sorry."

1043
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:09,770
Then what'd you do,
you knock him out?

1044
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:12,512
Tell her.

1045
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,512
Didn't have to.

1046
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:15,776
Ah, didn't have to.

1047
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:18,779
That's my girl right there,
poking people on the street.

1048
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:23,785


1049
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:26,526
Oh, Danny, you won't believe
what I found this week.

1050
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:29,529
You guys really live it up
around here.

1051
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:33,795
You hear that, the rock star
approved, Cindy Lou Who.

1052
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:35,796
Come on, Jeff,
didn't you tell her

1053
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:39,801
Around here we always party
like it's 1999.

1054
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:42,803
Oh, my god, can you be
any more embarrassing.

1055
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:43,804
Did you know I was in Vietnam?

1056
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:47,547
No.
Check out this scar?

1057
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:49,549
Remember?

1058
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,812
Remember this one?

1059
01:24:52,620 --> 01:25:02,586
Jesus.

1060
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:34,855
Why you got these scary things?

1061
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:39,599
Got them off the internet,
Some dude in Texas.

1062
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,862
I wouldn't want these things
in my house.

1063
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:46,606
Well, they in my house
and my house is your house.

1064
01:25:46,674 --> 01:25:56,640
So deal with it.

1065
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:03,623
You ever sell to Coach?

1066
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:04,885
Why?

1067
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:08,890
Just wondering.

1068
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:10,629
Look, don't you think
you and Teach's relationship

1069
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:11,630
Is a little--

1070
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:11,892
What?

1071
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,635
Inappropriate?

1072
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:15,896
What do you mean?

1073
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:19,639
He your teacher, Drey.

1074
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:19,763
I mean, sometimes
you act like he's--

1075
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,900
He's my friend.

1076
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:27,909
Look, he's a basehead,
all right, and baseheads
don't have friends.

1077
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:33,653
I mean, this motherfucker
was outside my house yesterday

1078
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:36,656
Telling me that we shouldn't
be associated with each other.

1079
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:46,725


1080
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:14,694
I'm gonna take
a freight train,

1081
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:16,957
Down at the station, Lord

1082
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:22,964
I don't care
where it goes

1083
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:29,710
Gonna climb me a mountain,
the highest mountain, Lord

1084
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:31,972
Gonna jump off,
nobody gonna know

1085
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:36,716
Hey, teach me something, Dan.

1086
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:42,984
Teach me some ebonics.

1087
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:48,990
Is that what they got
you teaching in that zoo?

1088
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:50,729
Hey, tell me something.

1089
01:27:50,798 --> 01:28:00,764
How do you say asshole
In ebonics?

1090
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:10,740
Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry
I'm an asshole.

1091
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:15,755
I love you.
you know that, right?

1092
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:20,021
Yeah, I know.

1093
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:24,764
All right.
Good, good.

1094
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:34,798
241, apartment three.

1095
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:45,842
Hello?
What's up?

1096
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:51,791
I bet you are so good
with those kids, Daniel Dunn.

1097
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:52,052
I am really proud of you.

1098
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,794
Thanks, Mom.

1099
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:59,799
Sometimes I think
we're the only thing
keeping them sane.

1100
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:00,799
It's a good thing,
you know, to teach.

1101
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:03,803
Your father and I thought
we were going

1102
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:04,803
To change the world
when we were young, you know.

1103
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:06,066
What did we know?

1104
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,068
Well, you stopped a war so--

1105
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:10,070
You think so?

1106
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:11,810
Yeah.

1107
01:29:11,879 --> 01:29:15,076
That's nice, honey.

1108
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:16,076
I think it was more
About Daniel Ellsberg

1109
01:29:16,884 --> 01:29:19,819
Than anything we did, you know?

1110
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:24,085
One man alone means nothing.

1111
01:29:24,892 --> 01:29:28,828
I guess not.
Do you hear from Rachel anymore?

1112
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:30,090
Not really.

1113
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:32,832
I saw her at the pharmacy
the other day,

1114
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:36,836
Maybe it's her Mom.

1115
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:38,838
You know, she looked great.

1116
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:43,843
You should give her a call,
but, you know, clean up
a little first.

1117
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:46,106
You're killing me
with the tie, okay.

1118
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:51,851
Stop, I'm fine.

1119
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,114
You happy?

1120
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:57,117
I'm so happy.

1121
01:29:57,925 --> 01:30:00,860
That's so great, sweetie.
you're happy, I'm happy.

1122
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:08,858
Watch the basketballs,
Okay, honey?

1123
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:18,902
Hey, Mom.

1124
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:31,915


1125
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,157
How was it?
Easy, right?

1126
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:39,899
I saw you shaking all across
the street and shit.

1127
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:41,161
It sure beats the hell
out of flipping burgers.

1128
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:51,935
Thank you.

1129
01:30:55,983 --> 01:31:04,186


1130
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:10,931
Your Mom said there's
more wine out here.

1131
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:14,195
I found it.

1132
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:17,197
Do you like my brother?

1133
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:20,200
Yeah.

1134
01:31:21,008 --> 01:31:24,205
Why?

1135
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:31,941
He's nice.
He's funny.

1136
01:31:32,019 --> 01:31:32,212
Does he tell any good jokes?

1137
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,215
Sometimes.

1138
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:37,957
Like what?

1139
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:44,954
Like knock, knock.

1140
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:46,226
Who's there?

1141
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:50,231
The interrupting cow.

1142
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:58,240
The interrupting--
Moo.

1143
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:09,012
Yeah?

1144
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:42,045


1145
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:57,036
Where you going?
Come inside, sweetie.

1146
01:32:57,104 --> 01:33:05,034
Ain't nobody going to bite you.

1147
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:15,113


1148
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:52,414
Everything cool?

1149
01:34:53,220 --> 01:35:00,422
I guess we should
get you home then.

1150
01:35:01,228 --> 01:35:08,157


1151
01:35:08,235 --> 01:35:18,236


1152
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,215
I don't think
It's a good idea

1153
01:35:56,283 --> 01:36:00,219
You falling asleep in front
of the TV every night.

1154
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:02,482
What's up, Drey?
You in a funk today?

1155
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:08,227
Want to tell me why?

1156
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:11,230
Just thinking about Mike,
I guess.

1157
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:13,493
I miss your brother, too.

1158
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:20,240
We'll go see him as soon
As I get some time off.

1159
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:22,502
I can't believe they hit me
with another double tomorrow.

1160
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:31,240
Can you believe that?
I can't get a goddamn break.

1161
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:35,254
So what else is happening?

1162
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:36,254
I heard something about
a civil rights thing

1163
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:40,521
With Oprah or something.

1164
01:36:41,328 --> 01:36:51,294
Drey?

1165
01:36:55,342 --> 01:36:57,276
Hi, honey, just calling
to let you know

1166
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:00,279
How much fun
it was for us last night,

1167
01:37:00,347 --> 01:37:02,542
and we should do it more often.

1168
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:12,418
I love you, sweetie.
call us soon, okay?

1169
01:37:34,381 --> 01:37:35,575
Hello, everyone.
I'm Mr. Light.

1170
01:37:36,383 --> 01:37:36,576
I will be filling
In for your teacher--

1171
01:37:37,384 --> 01:37:37,577
Where's Mr. Dunn?

1172
01:37:38,385 --> 01:37:39,579
I really don't know.

1173
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:43,322
When's he coming back?

1174
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:44,584
They're not really telling me
Too much in the office.

1175
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:55,358
Why don't you guys tell me
What you've been learning?

1176
01:38:05,412 --> 01:38:05,605
So what's good, Drey?

1177
01:38:06,413 --> 01:38:07,345
I don't know.

1178
01:38:07,414 --> 01:38:09,348
What's good with you?

1179
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:10,610
Chilling.
Need a ride?

1180
01:38:11,418 --> 01:38:12,612
No, I got my bike.

1181
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:14,352
Well, throw it in the back.

1182
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:16,355
I got to get home.

1183
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:17,617
Well, I'll take you.

1184
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:18,618
Not today.

1185
01:38:19,426 --> 01:38:23,362
Drey?

1186
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:33,396
Look, I'll see you around, huh?

1187
01:39:16,483 --> 01:39:18,417
What happened to your friends?

1188
01:39:18,485 --> 01:39:27,416
They're gone.

1189
01:39:27,494 --> 01:39:29,689
You missed a hell of a party.

1190
01:39:30,497 --> 01:39:40,498
Looks like it.

1191
01:39:55,522 --> 01:40:05,523
Thank you.

1192
01:40:08,535 --> 01:40:18,501
Ouch.

1193
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:24,882
You ready to go?

1194
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:59,542
You missed a spot.

1195
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,795
Knock knock.

1196
01:41:16,603 --> 01:41:17,797
Who's there?

1197
01:41:18,605 --> 01:41:20,539
The interrupting cow.

1198
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:27,547
The interrupting cow who?

1199
01:41:27,614 --> 01:41:32,813
Moo.

1200
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:34,814
That was horrible.

1201
01:41:35,622 --> 01:41:45,588
Yeah.
