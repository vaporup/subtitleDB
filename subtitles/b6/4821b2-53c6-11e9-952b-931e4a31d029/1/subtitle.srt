Daddy, are you ok?

16
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:13,191
Daddy, what's that?

17
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,891
- That's Mars
- Is it friends with earth?

18
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,992
Not yet. But soon they will be

19
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,799
How do you know that?

20
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:31,003
Because I'll soon go there
to do that

21
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:38,176
You're gonna make them become friends?

22
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:44,019
Then how will I see you?

23
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:55,690
Do you remember that water globe
I gave you?

24
00:03:55,768 --> 00:04:06,337
Think of that as Mars,
then I'll always be with you

25
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:32,527
A LETTER FROM MARS

26
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,386
- I won!
- I did...

27
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,085
- Hey I...
- Do again then...

28
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,185
- Again!
- Okay, again

29
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,822
Now, one, two, three!

30
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,500
- I won
- No I did

31
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,627
Then do it again...

32
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,634
- I'll go first
- Ready?

33
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,243
So-hee!

34
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,317
Come play with us!

35
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,280
Seung-jae can probably
open his eyes under water

36
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,188
No, he can't. Why is he doing that?

37
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,284
Can't you just buy another one?

38
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,194
My daddy gave that to me
before he went to Mars

39
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:41,700
Talking about Mars again

40
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,396
Only the president, an astronaut

41
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,702
and rich people can go to Mars, stupid.
Right, Kyung-soo?

42
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,211
Not rich people, you idiot

43
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,714
Mailmen! They can go 'cause
they need to deliver mails

44
00:06:55,782 --> 00:07:00,276
See! Your dad didn't go to Mars.
He's dead

45
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:05,120
We saw the whole funeral ceremony

46
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:15,396
- You made her leave!
- Stop it

47
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,424
Stop kicking up the dust!

48
00:08:55,768 --> 00:09:00,205
- Why d'you hit me for?
- That sounded painful

49
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,106
His head always makes that sound

50
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,110
Whatever.
Stop hitting me so hard

51
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,510
I'm your brother

52
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,776
but you're
only nice to So-hee

53
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,081
His head always makes that sound?
It must be made of rocks

54
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,714
Shut up! Stop it!

55
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:29,198
Why are you so late?
We were waiting for you

56
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,792
Were you cleaning after school?

57
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,307
No I sent a letter to daddy in Mars

58
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:41,210
- Dummy, it's not gonna get there
- Yes, it will

59
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,771
Right, Seung-jae?

60
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,012
- Did you put a stamp on it?
- Yes

61
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:52,422
- And the zip code?
- Huh?

62
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,996
I don't know if it'll get there
without the zip code

63
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:07,234
- Should I send it again?
- Later. If it doesn't get there

64
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,407
You guys go ahead

65
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,814
I left something at school

66
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,217
Let's go

67
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,412
Hello

68
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,333
What are you doing here?

69
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,712
Sir. I'm sorry

70
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,381
- Let me see
- Wait

71
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,425
- Stay still
- Wait please

72
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,526
It hurts... It hurts...

73
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:41,285
- Please... slowly
- You... you...

74
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,887
What are you trying to steal?

75
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,195
Are you trying to get report card out?

76
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,894
If you got bad grades

77
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,496
then you should be grounded

78
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,939
- No, sir. That's not it
- Be quiet!

79
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,310
Go home and

80
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,372
ask your mom for some ointment

81
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,714
I don't ever want to catch you
doing this again

82
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,028
Sir!

83
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,039
What do you want?

84
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,223
Dear Daddy in Mars,

85
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,088
I'll be there next week

86
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,928
Wait for me

87
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,318
- You need help with anything?
- Nope

88
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:24,295
- You want anything to eat?
- No thank you

89
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,730
Don't study too hard

90
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,878
- Is this it?
- Yes

91
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:51,412
So, you want me to
personally deliver this?

92
00:14:55,661 --> 00:15:00,724
- So-hee?
- I don't like her

93
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,001
- Sorry. Can't do it
- Please!

94
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,636
Kid, you gotta put a stamp on!

95
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,237
Ah...

96
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:37,532
- Hello
- Oh you're So-hee

97
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,408
To my dearest So-hee

98
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,208
It's not as lonely

99
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,182
as you may think here

100
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,984
Your mommy is here and
so is your grandpa

101
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,081
You can't see us here in Mars, but

102
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,286
we can always see you

103
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,694
I know you want to come here, but

104
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,291
not yet.
To come here, you need

105
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,304
legal documents and
recommendation

106
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,102
letter from your teacher

107
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,608
Plus, you need to get
permission from

108
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:56,011
the Mars' president
only given to a married person

109
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,175
So, for now, forget about coming

110
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,684
here and just focus on
your study

111
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,586
Lastly, Seung-jae cares
about you

112
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,680
deeply and I believe you guys are

113
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,785
match made in heaven

114
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,489
Match made in heaven?

115
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:17,934
He's just telling us to keep
our good friendship

116
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,116
I'm scared

117
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,022
Do you know the multiplication table?

118
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,290
Then repeat after me 2x2=4

119
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,893
- 2x2=4
- 2x2=4

120
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,905
- 2x3=6
- 2x3=6

121
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:58,431
- 2x4=8
- 2x4=8

122
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,280
Seung-jae! So-hee!

123
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:10,378
- 4x8=32
- 4x8=32

124
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:14,586
- 4x9=36
- 4x9=36

125
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:22,499
Seung-jae! So-hee!

126
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,331
2x2=4

127
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:30,301
- 2x2=4
- 2x2=4!

128
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,708
- 2x3=6
- 2x3=6

129
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:40,685
2x4 Dad! Here!

130
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:45,189
We're here! Dad!!

131
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:48,192
Seung-jae! So-hee!

132
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,629
Dad! Dad!

133
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,335
You bastard!

134
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,506
- Cool down
- Hey, come on

135
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,802
Hey, let me go

136
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,538
- Cool down
- You bastard...

137
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,017
What?

138
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,183
From tomorrow on,
pay more attention to So-hee's Grandma

139
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:53,223
- So-hee's leaving tomorrow?
- Yes

140
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:02,798
- Where is she going?
- To her aunt's place in Seoul

141
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,233
For how long?

142
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:11,507
Well, she's transferring school So I guess it'll be for

143
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:19,677
Lucky! Heard there're 1000 students
100 teachers in one school

144
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,719
We should move there, too

145
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:08,811
Hi

146
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,122
Hi

147
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,219
- Hi
- Hi

148
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:56,627
A magazine and let's see

149
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,432
Sun-mi, it's end of a month and
you also got some tax forms

150
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:13,584
Here, drink this. It's warm.
Instead of soda

151
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,415
you should drink
this with this medicine

152
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,317
That's ok. I'm pretty strong

153
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:28,297
I watched you ride up the hill
and you didn't do so good

154
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,425
I didn't?

155
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,138
Please drink it

156
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,221
- You're very kind. Thank you
- I'll take that

157
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,626
Well...

158
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:03,332
- Why don't you get a bell?
- A bell?

159
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:11,506
Oh, I don't really need it

160
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:15,706
No, you should get one

161
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,874
Then you can ring it and we would

162
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,714
know you're in the neighborhood

163
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,682
Well

164
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,816
- Anyway. Be careful
- Thank you

165
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,714
That feels good

166
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:55,378
Mr Kim. Try to take it slowly

167
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:59,014
What?

168
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:05,089
Just resting
only makes me unhealthier

169
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:10,294
Human bodies are like bicycles.
If you don't work them,

170
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:13,132
they are gonna rust. I bet I'm still in
better condition than you are

171
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:20,401
Anyway I don't know why, but
since the dam construction announcement,

172
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,537
the mail delivery amount has doubled

173
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:27,818
Is there anything good news at the
village will be under water sooner

174
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,015
Have you started packing?

175
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,917
No. The decision is not
even finalized, yet

176
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,626
How's your father?

177
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,208
Why are you smiling like that?

178
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:56,873
He's good still stubborn as always.
And the same of temper

179
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:01,476
Well, that's what keeps him going

180
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:05,421
- I'll stop by sometime. Go home
- Yes, sir

181
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,594
Grandma, it's cold out.
Why didn't you stay in the house?

182
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:23,129
It's cold inside, too

183
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:29,038
Grandma, come here

184
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,528
You got a letter from So-hee

185
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,426
- I'll read it to you
- Yeah

186
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,904
To my dearest grandma

187
00:27:56,975 --> 00:28:00,809
How was your week?

188
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,473
Mine was good

189
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:07,780
Seoul doesn't seem to get too cold
even in the winter

190
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:12,983
Recently, I joined a

191
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:17,893
prestigious company here in Seoul

192
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:21,295
I'm so happy

193
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,891
I'm pretty swamped with work but

194
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:28,803
as soon as I get some time off
I'll come visit you

195
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,205
Meanwhile please don't do any hard work

196
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:35,303
If you need help with
anything please ask Seung-jae

197
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,076
If Seung-jae doesn't listen to you...

198
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,980
Hit him hard

199
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:45,580
I'll keep studying and working here

200
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,888
You don't need to worry

201
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,793
about me dating a boy

202
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:55,697
I trust you to pick a nice boyfriend for me

203
00:28:55,767 --> 00:29:00,795
Anyway, I'll write again next week.
Take care and be well

204
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,033
Love you very much, So-hee

205
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:09,911
- Wow! She's really great
- That's my girl

206
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,912
What's this? Is it good?

207
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:52,522
She's the main character and
that's her sister

208
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,628
But, later she finds out
she's actually her mother

209
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,129
It's always the same storyline

210
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:10,935
But, I still get a kick out of
watching it

211
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,687
You always drool

212
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,786
like a cracked teapot

213
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:38,996
Maybe you need a bib

214
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,800
I'm just kidding

215
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:48,642
- Mr... Kim...
- What, dad?

216
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:04,493
Mr... Kim... stop... by...

217
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,326
He's asking why Mr Kim
never comes by

218
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:17,437
Amazing!
How do you understand him?

219
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,213
- How do you do?
- What's going on?

220
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:32,712
Shut up, will you?

221
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,683
- Hello?
- If he's not home, just hang up

222
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,491
Is this LEE Ho-gul's residence?

223
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,293
I'm very sorry about this

224
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,300
- Take care
- Yes

225
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,735
Hey, Ho-gul, I don't want to
see you here again. Understood?

226
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,802
It's cold out.
Please go inside

227
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,899
Thank you, again

228
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,342
Be careful when you wash your face

229
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:03,609
Blot this on with a cotton ball

230
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,790
You're a pro at this

231
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,126
Years of experience, you know

232
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,498
Thank you.
How much do I owe you?

233
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,904
That's alright

234
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:27,103
No. Really

235
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:30,170
Don't worry about it. I got enough
medicine to last me a lifetime

236
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:34,116
Just take it whenever you need it

237
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,886
Well, then. Thank you

238
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:47,421
Well if you want,
you can buy me a dinner

239
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,329
Right, I'll buy you
something delicious

240
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:57,701
You got lucked out because of me

241
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,936
Ouch! Stop hitting my head!

242
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,013
I'm not a kid!

243
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,611
Mom's not gonna like her

244
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,517
What?

245
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,925
She's too old

246
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,718
Shut up

247
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,727
Anyway, what are you gonna do?

248
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,430
Don't worry. I'll take care of it

249
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,306
I got about 3 millions won saved up

250
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,536
We can use that to settle this

251
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,547
Seung-jae

252
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,610
I'm really sorry. I...

253
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,281
- Actually...
- If you're really sorry

254
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:47,085
Then behave stop acting like a fool

255
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,625
It's not that. How should I put it

256
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:55,121
I kinda spent your money

257
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,795
I said I'm sorry. I really am

258
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,238
I said I'm sorry then...

259
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,806
Come here!

260
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,403
Do you know
what I went through,

261
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,607
to save that money?

262
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,284
One ticket to Jeonju, please

263
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,120
12,900 won, please

264
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,693
Less than a year left till

265
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,923
the dam construction

266
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,888
No point in fighting anymore

267
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,796
I've already

268
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,533
sold most of my tools

269
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,606
And you are with me...

270
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,009
Hey, did your dog have babies?

271
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,046
What?

272
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,808
Yes, she did

273
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,785
Stop distracting me. So anyway

274
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,184
I need your help

275
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,485
You know... The Green whatever
They're getting in our way

276
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,787
If we get our hands on this matter

277
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,384
before others get involved

278
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,190
How many?

279
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,423
Hey!

280
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,300
Three

281
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,030
2 female and 1 male Ok?

282
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,998
So anyway, Seung-jae

283
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,203
It's not only for me

284
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,974
If we get the compensation money,

285
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,607
then it'll be good for your family too

286
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,518
For real

287
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,312
Who's the father?

288
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,519
Seung-jae!

289
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,283
I'm worried

290
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,194
about your dog

291
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,698
She was always pretty weak and

292
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,633
you know how dogs get
even weaker after giving birth

293
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,328
I'm worried

294
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,718
Seung-jae!

295
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,323
Grandma, you scared me!

296
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,710
Seung-jae?

297
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,133
Not married yet?

298
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,399
Married?

299
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,031
You never left this place?

300
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,811
I lived in Seoul for a bit

301
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,278
I was working at my uncle's
restaurant,

302
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,873
but it wasn't for me

303
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,474
No?

304
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,484
No

305
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:19,421
About that time, my father got sick.
So I came home

306
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,089
Here... Everything's the same

307
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,629
Nothing ever changes here

308
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,430
Don't you feel suffocated?

309
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:53,282
Hey, uncle Deuk-sam is
getting married later

310
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,517
Remember him?

311
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,090
Craterface from the melon farm?

312
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,423
Ah~

313
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,193
Remember he used to give us

314
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,699
free melons?

315
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,202
I remember I used to cry 'cause

316
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,999
I was scared of his face

317
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,403
Right

318
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,442
He's getting married now?

319
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,210
You should come with your grandma

320
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,908
Everyone's gonna be there

321
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,118
I will

322
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,698
- Seung-jae!
- Yeah

323
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,601
Seung-jae! Hold it with your
left hand Like this

324
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,399
Like this

325
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,030
Ok

326
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,811
Hold this for a sec

327
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:13,023
Groom bow to the bride

328
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:34,182
Bride bow to the groom, again

329
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,913
Ouch! What?

330
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,228
Seung-jae,

331
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,732
So why did
So-hee come back?

332
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,938
Probably to spend time with her
grandma before she passes away

333
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,105
Hasn't she done something?

334
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,007
Maybe she got pregnant

335
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,308
Shut up

336
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,215
Why? Eun-ja came back pregnant

337
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,879
Eun-ja barely went to school,

338
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,320
but So-hee is a college graduate

339
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,523
What does that got to do with
getting pregnant?

340
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,019
Huh?

341
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,389
The village got smaller

342
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,933
Roads look narrower

343
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,127
What do you do?

344
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:01,902
Oh

345
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,906
You work at the post office?

346
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,236
Yes

347
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,005
Where is the bank?

348
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:14,178
Around the corner,
there's an agricultural cooperative

349
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:15,878
There, you'll find the Livestocks Cooperatives

350
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,717
National Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives

351
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:20,917
Do you have KB Bank?

352
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:28,229
Is there a bathhouse?

353
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:29,793
Out in the town

354
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,334
Does it have a sauna?

355
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,937
I'm assuming there's no library.
How about an internet cafe?

356
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,308
A pharmacy?

357
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:42,538
Yes!

358
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,218
Do you have Tylenol?

359
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:53,923
No

360
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,993
Let's go to a bigger pharmacy

361
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,727
Thank you

362
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,837
I'll just take 2 bottles of health drink

363
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:22,714
600 won!

364
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,131
It'll be here soon

365
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,312
Who are they?

366
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:54,178
Green' something

367
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:57,379
A dam will be built up there

368
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:00,981
And all this will be under water

369
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,889
Under water?

370
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,623
It's not definite yet. Just plans

371
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:08,693
Since there's a strong opposition,

372
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,734
it might not happen

373
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,892
Breakdown of ecosystem!

374
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,801
Must be stopped!

375
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,339
Must be stopped!

376
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,379
It's not easy to come out here

377
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,008
How often do you make this trip?

378
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,387
Me? Everyday

379
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,615
Why?

380
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:34,417
For work

381
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,124
There was a post office overthere

382
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:40,819
That's the main post office and
I work at a branch office

383
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,128
I think I was in 8th grade

384
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,529
when I last received your letter

385
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,840
Was it?

386
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,502
It wasn't your letter. It was

387
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:59,015
daddy's letter from Mars

388
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,916
How can you send a fake letter
to a middle schooler?

389
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,223
Well. I...

390
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:11,985
Writing a fake letter
must be your hobby

391
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,030
Even till now

392
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,271
Look. It's our village Look,

393
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,871
Seung-jae

394
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,679
From Sijung Ri to Sammal...

395
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:39,279
Our river and Songmun bridge

396
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,415
But, what is this about anyway?

397
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:48,895
It's about the areas that
will disappear due to the dam

398
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,102
That dam is making us

399
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,502
pretty famous, huh?

400
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,006
You're happy about that?

401
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:00,009
Don't you watch the news?

402
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:03,103
Our village's gonna be sunk under

403
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,978
water because of that dam

404
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,577
Where are they gonna get all
that water?

405
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,085
They're trying to scare us

406
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:11,780
Oh... my

407
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,018
Trying to scare us? For what?

408
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,324
Mr Park

409
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,120
what do girls like?

410
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:21,828
Who's the girl?

411
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,227
The girl at the pharmacy?

412
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,100
No!

413
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,933
I'm just curious

414
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,008
What do women like?

415
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:33,542
Yes

416
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:38,305
Definitely this... This...

417
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,272
You bastard...

418
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,214
What are you looking at!

419
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,081
From my experience,

420
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,485
women like

421
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,124
You just need to be good at this

422
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:51,890
Stop it, "I don't want to"

423
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,088
that's what they all say

424
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,495
But don't pay too much attention to
what they say

425
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:56,896
Just be manly

426
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,300
and she'll fall for you

427
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,998
If you wait, then she's gone

428
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:05,200
Love is all about winning

429
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,142
Good for you

430
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:13,015
It's wisdom gained from
a painful experience

431
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,117
Not that kind of stuff

432
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:17,786
You mean 'dating'?

433
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,321
Something like that

434
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:20,623
Women like

435
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,617
sexy men!

436
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,297
Are you sure?

437
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,993
Turn to next page

438
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,626
That's what it says

439
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:09,836
So-hee, do you

440
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,343
So-hee, why don't we

441
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,393
So-hee! So-hee!

442
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:40,334
So-hee! So-hee!

443
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,623
God!

444
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,536
My shoe!

445
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:34,514
You need some medicine

446
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,325
That's ok. It'll heal

447
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:43,998
No. It's badly cut

448
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,534
I'm not gonna die

449
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,798
But, anyway,

450
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,032
what will you do about your bike?

451
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,635
That's ok. I was gonna replace it anyway

452
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:56,241
That's good

453
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,213
You should go

454
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:01,710
But

455
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,610
Just go!

456
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,384
What are you looking at?

457
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,121
You want to know why I ran away?

458
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,991
No

459
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,535
Your foot hurts
