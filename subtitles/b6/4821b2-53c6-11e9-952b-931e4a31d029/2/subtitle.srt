1
00:00:43,205 --> 00:00:44,467
Seung-jae

2
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:46,772
come in

3
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:50,269
That's ok

4
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:52,774
Come in

5
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,680
2x1=2,

6
00:02:08,423 --> 00:02:11,085
2x2=4,

7
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:15,787
2x3=6,

8
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:19,894
2x4=8,

9
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:23,971
2x5=10

10
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:28,467
2x6=12

11
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:31,873
2x7=14

12
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:36,880
2x8=16

13
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,186
2x9=18

14
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:56,128
I didn't

15
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:58,570
steal that money

16
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:00,570
Half of it

17
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:03,373
belongs to my dad

18
00:03:03,912 --> 00:03:06,346
He gave it

19
00:03:06,414 --> 00:03:09,076
to my aunt to raise me

20
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:12,587
But now, she says
she has no money for my tuition

21
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,881
She has money

22
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:20,053
for her daughter's private tutor

23
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:23,188
but not for me

24
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:25,893
Does that make sense?

25
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,353
I...

26
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:29,288
I'll never forget today

27
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,490
I'll show everyone that

28
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,364
I can do it on my own

29
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:49,269
Then

30
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:53,071
I can laugh about

31
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:57,881
what happened today

32
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:06,991
Seung-jae,

33
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,995
Are you asleep?

34
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,391
No

35
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:20,465
Come here. It's warmer

36
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:57,073
Your heart is so pure

37
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:03,243
When I'm with you,

38
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:06,287
You make me feel so innocent

39
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:13,292
You're very kind...

40
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,397
Always...

41
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:21,691
Thank you for staying with me

42
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,868
- Where are you going, sir?
- Excuse me?

43
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:39,837
21st floor is cafeteria

44
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:42,246
I don't think a VP would be
eating there

45
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:45,081
No. I eat at the cafeteria

46
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:04,562
So-hee!

47
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:07,768
Sir, is the VP also a member
of the 'Royal Family'?

48
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:11,545
No. He's a self-made man

49
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:14,548
He was sent to America for an
adoption when he was only 6

50
00:09:14,616 --> 00:09:18,143
He received MBA all by himself

51
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:20,084
He's pretty impressive

52
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:25,085
Here are marketing plans
from our new recruits

53
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:27,595
Thank you

54
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,589
May I ask why you've
requested for them?

55
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:33,197
Just to see if there are
any fresh ideas

56
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:48,073
Take yours back

57
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:51,380
Sir, nothing was chosen?

58
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:56,385
I stayed up a week straight working it

59
00:09:57,725 --> 00:09:59,454
You thought it'd be that easy?

60
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:00,357
Read over

61
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:01,759
VP's note

62
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:02,887
on each one

63
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:05,590
It feels like a report card

64
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:30,880
'Would you give me a chance?'

65
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:44,462
I hope you're well

66
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:48,473
I haven't heard from you
in last 2 months

67
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,473
It snowed here

68
00:10:53,014 --> 00:10:55,346
As I watch my neighbors

69
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,852
get busy with clearing
snow off their doorsteps

70
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,684
I felt my heart rush a bit

71
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:05,359
I'm getting ready for the winter

72
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:06,893
as well

73
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:08,056
There isn't much,

74
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:11,690
a small town mailman needs to do

75
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,762
But, if there's something

76
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:16,770
that I must do, then I should do it now

77
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:20,833
In any case, I hope this winter

78
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:22,773
will soon be over

79
00:11:24,012 --> 00:11:27,277
I hope to see you before this

80
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:29,950
winter passes

81
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:33,476
I really would like to see you

82
00:11:36,424 --> 00:11:38,483
Dad. You're making a mistake

83
00:11:40,628 --> 00:11:44,064
Get... out... bastard

84
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:45,292
Ho-gul!

85
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:47,460
I know you don't want to hear me

86
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:50,368
say it but the village will sink

87
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:51,633
We're gonna get kicked out anyway

88
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:54,470
So, what difference does it make?

89
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:56,833
Can't you see I'm doing this for us?

90
00:11:56,911 --> 00:11:59,436
For Dad and his illness?

91
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:01,277
He doesn't even know

92
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:05,649
Let's talk about...

93
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,744
Forget it.

94
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:08,982
Why don't you go
and kiss ass to grandma

95
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:28,070
Hey, Deuk-sam!

96
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,775
Yeah... Yes

97
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:43,690
Hey

98
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:46,486
Hi. Have you eaten?

99
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:51,089
Seung-jae!

100
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,171
Don't worry about it

101
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:07,180
Just let it be

102
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:10,540
But,

103
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:12,586
about So-hee's grandma...

104
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:13,883
What about her?

105
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:15,753
So-hee's aunt

106
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:17,984
sold her land here

107
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:20,357
A realtor came by

108
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:22,555
with paperwork and asked me

109
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,995
to mail it to Seoul

110
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:27,300
Does she know about this?

111
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:30,463
Probably not

112
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:34,832
You'd better tell her, then

113
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:37,673
Let her not plant
on government property

114
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:39,946
And a day after tomorrow, deliver

115
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:42,642
this paperwork to Seoul personally

116
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:43,775
To Seoul?

117
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,682
Your paperwork is in there too

118
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:49,689
The postmaster at Dobong post
office wants to see you

119
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:52,392
He's a friend of mine

120
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,193
Just introduce yourself

121
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,593
It's time to start thinking
about a new job

122
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,696
When I was in America,
I had many older brothers

123
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:12,864
with all different backgrounds

124
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:16,169
One of them taught me this

125
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:20,776
But, now, I can't remember
who it was

126
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:30,982
When I was 7

127
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:34,656
for the first time

128
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:38,995
in my life, I got a gift from my dad

129
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:43,767
And I was so happy

130
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,768
But, 2 days later

131
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:54,176
he passed away

132
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:00,485
And, now

133
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:06,093
I'm so afraid of

134
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:09,196
this feeling of happiness

135
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:15,295
Please promise me

136
00:16:16,604 --> 00:16:18,868
that you won't die without me

137
00:16:25,913 --> 00:16:27,642
Her name is Yoon So-hee

138
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:31,173
I don't know who that is

139
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,452
If you see her,

140
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:34,453
you can't

141
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:36,581
forget her

142
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:40,050
She's about this tall and

143
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:41,651
has beautiful eyes

144
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:43,993
with long straight hair...

145
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:47,565
She's beautiful!

146
00:16:47,635 --> 00:16:50,229
Anyone who shows up here

147
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:51,828
with just a name

148
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:55,137
is always a sales person

149
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:57,871
So, what are you?

150
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:02,172
I'm a mail man!

151
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:38,444
Boy... You're persistent

152
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,451
I have to see her

153
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,851
Excuse me!

154
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,081
He's my client

155
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:44,991
So-hee!

156
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:51,055
Your aunt told me you work here

157
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:54,966
Wow, pretty impressive company!

158
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:58,266
It's been awhile since I moved out

159
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:00,440
Then the letters

160
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:03,534
I've sent you...

161
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:04,669
I never got them

162
00:18:06,414 --> 00:18:08,075
Oh. That's what happened

163
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:12,576
So, what brings you here?

164
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:16,152
Well...

165
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:18,748
I had some business with...

166
00:18:18,826 --> 00:18:21,294
Post office in Seoul... Uhm...

167
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,197
I came to see you

168
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:29,293
You're still sweet

169
00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:33,039
But, I'm really busy

170
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:35,541
right now

171
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,271
I'm sorry but you should go

172
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,240
You heard about

173
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:42,748
big corporate like this

174
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:46,548
We have very tight schedule and
it's not very flexible

175
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,956
That's ok. I'll wait

176
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:55,291
No. I mean...

177
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,460
Words get around here so fast and I can't really say

178
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:00,864
you're my family member and...

179
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:04,166
You know what I mean?

180
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:06,634
Then I'll wait for you at some

181
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:09,471
other place. Take your time

182
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:14,972
No. Really

183
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,681
You should go

184
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:25,289
So-hee

185
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:28,594
Are you angry that
you never got my letters?

186
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,858
I didn't mean for that to happen

187
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:33,695
I really did send them

188
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:36,132
If you tell me your new address

189
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:38,728
I'll send them again

190
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:40,433
No

191
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:42,567
You don't have to

192
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:48,980
I just want to leave the childhood
memories as they are

193
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,842
But,

194
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,446
That day...

195
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:59,653
Seung-jae, we're both adults

196
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:01,194
We were adults at that time

197
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,657
We had good feelings for each other
and things happened

198
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:09,100
But that's that

199
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:14,532
I'm happy with my life right now

200
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:16,166
And...

201
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:19,472
I'm in love with someone

202
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:25,552
And he proposed to me last night.

203
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:28,247
We're thinking about
getting married this spring

204
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:31,485
He's a really good person

205
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:51,842
Just think of it as a gift from a friend

206
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:53,971
Grab something to eat
on your way back home

207
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:02,484
Right. I mean,

208
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:08,188
I'm pretty hungry...

209
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,064
I was waiting for you

210
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:14,157
and...

211
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:17,670
I forgot to eat...

212
00:22:31,412 --> 00:22:33,437
Well...

213
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:35,573
Seung-jae!

214
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:54,600
Where will you move to?

215
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:58,462
I don't know, yet

216
00:22:58,605 --> 00:23:01,631
We're moving to Jinan

217
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:05,236
It has cheap real estate
and also has a hospital

218
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:07,576
and a big post office

219
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:09,447
If you want

220
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:12,485
I can look into a place for you there

221
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,451
Sun-mi, when will you get married?

222
00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:17,581
What?

223
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:21,993
Married? Well...
I have to find a man first

224
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,091
What kind of a man do you like?

225
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:29,466
I don't know

226
00:23:32,406 --> 00:23:34,431
I guess...

227
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:38,342
I like men who have

228
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:41,939
clear eyes

229
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:45,178
and soft lips...

230
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:50,688
I'm so embarrassed

231
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:54,187
Sun-mi, let's get married

232
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,963
You like me, right?

233
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:01,865
I mean, you don't have to like me,

234
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:08,431
but you're interested in me.
So, can't we get married?

235
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:10,170
If you don't want to, then forget it

236
00:24:15,516 --> 00:24:17,177
Bastard!

237
00:24:18,418 --> 00:24:20,784
How can you say that so easy?

238
00:24:21,822 --> 00:24:24,450
You know

239
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:27,050
I've always liked you...

240
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:29,891
I tried to forget you so many times,

241
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:32,762
But I couldn't

242
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:37,634
I ordered all those magazines
just to see you everyday

243
00:24:37,704 --> 00:24:41,470
You know I don't read any of them.

244
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:47,137
You didn't even get a bell
for your bike...

245
00:24:47,214 --> 00:24:49,444
And now, you ask me
to marry you and...

246
00:24:49,516 --> 00:24:51,040
Just like that... Bastard

247
00:24:51,118 --> 00:24:52,676
You're such a bastard...

248
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:23,849
So-hee,

249
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,384
what happened?

250
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:27,646
- What?
- About VP

251
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:29,655
What is he gonna do now?

252
00:25:29,723 --> 00:25:30,747
What are you talking about?

253
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:33,292
The bankruptcy

254
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:38,096
I heard his loss adds up to
a few 1 million wons

255
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,198
I'll call you later

256
00:26:49,436 --> 00:26:53,873
2x3=6... 2x4=8...

257
00:26:56,009 --> 00:27:03,074
2x6=12... 2x7=14...

258
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:13,689
2x8=16... 2x9=... 18...

259
00:27:25,305 --> 00:27:28,069
The reason for our gathering here
today is...

260
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:31,839
Lately we became awkward
with each other

261
00:27:31,912 --> 00:27:34,278
due to the dam construction matter

262
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:37,342
But, we used to be so close

263
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:40,682
Like one big family

264
00:27:41,722 --> 00:27:46,591
So before we all leave, we should

265
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:50,094
take this time to mend our friendships

266
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:55,591
Please enjoy

267
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:04,671
Should I clear the table?

268
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:12,585
You're acting strange today

269
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:17,690
Open the door, will you?

270
00:28:27,134 --> 00:28:29,398
Aren't you cold?
The wind is quite chilly

271
00:29:15,515 --> 00:29:20,145
He snores so loud

272
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,745
Grandma, where are you going?

273
00:29:22,823 --> 00:29:25,291
I'm going to see my son

274
00:29:28,428 --> 00:29:31,261
It's late

275
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:34,061
Wait till morning and I'll go with you

276
00:29:34,134 --> 00:29:37,228
That's ok

277
00:29:37,304 --> 00:29:38,635
Don't go

278
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:42,266
If I go, then So-hee will come

279
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:47,879
So-hee's coming?

280
00:29:49,516 --> 00:29:51,575
You go back to sleep

281
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:57,679
I'll be alright

282
00:29:59,226 --> 00:30:04,960
Wait, don't you want to take this?

283
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:10,333
I got no use for that

284
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:14,965
You can have it if you want

285
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:06,485
How are you?

286
00:31:09,629 --> 00:31:14,896
Grandma...
Did you see her go?

287
00:31:17,003 --> 00:31:21,030
Were you with her?

288
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:26,443
Grandma... Did she go to Mars?

289
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:32,645
Daddy is there...

290
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:36,086
Did she go there?

291
00:31:38,325 --> 00:31:44,753
She doesn't know how to write...

292
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:50,531
How will she send me letters?

293
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:57,533
She was in peace

294
00:31:57,611 --> 00:32:03,447
Good. That's good

295
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:07,145
Seung-jae...

296
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:14,649
Remember that brook
where we used to go play?

297
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:20,667
And catch fish?

298
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:26,639
A bit down from it,
there was a stream...

299
00:32:26,706 --> 00:32:30,142
That's Noruet stream...

300
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,647
And further down, there was a river...

301
00:32:34,714 --> 00:32:43,986
Songnae River. It's a wide river

302
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:51,755
That must be it, then

303
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:55,460
I saw you in my dream and...

304
00:32:55,535 --> 00:32:59,369
You were there... By that river

305
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:08,737
You were fishing there

306
00:33:08,815 --> 00:33:14,549
The sun was warm
and the wind was cool

307
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:17,954
Sitting there by the riverside

308
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:22,461
you looked so happy

309
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:28,161
Sometimes. When I was down

310
00:33:28,234 --> 00:33:35,072
I thought about going there

311
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:41,242
I thought I could see you
if I went there

312
00:33:41,314 --> 00:33:44,841
and sit next to you

313
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:50,049
lean on you... and just rest for a little

314
00:33:50,123 --> 00:33:52,956
there...

315
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:59,590
You can come anytime.
I'm always there

316
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:20,664
You're late! Come on

317
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:24,568
Let's go

318
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:20,584
Seung-jae, were you cold?

319
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:29,766
Seung-jae!

320
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:36,072
Seung-jae!

321
00:38:41,414 --> 00:38:43,882
Seung-jae!

322
00:44:33,132 --> 00:44:37,068
Seung-jae!

323
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:45,937
Sorry

324
00:44:46,012 --> 00:44:50,142
Is this the residence of
Yoon So-hee?

325
00:44:50,216 --> 00:44:52,047
Yes. That's me

326
00:44:52,118 --> 00:44:54,678
You got a mail and a package

327
00:45:00,926 --> 00:45:05,488
From who...

328
00:46:26,512 --> 00:46:29,845
We only have
kimchi soup or miso soup

329
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:34,943
I'll have miso soup.
Do you have a room for a night?

330
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,750
I have one, but it's a bit damp

331
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,154
You want it?

332
00:46:39,225 --> 00:46:42,251
Yes. I'll take it

333
00:46:42,328 --> 00:46:45,058
I'll give you a good price for it

334
00:46:45,131 --> 00:46:48,066
Thank you. And ma'am...

335
00:46:48,134 --> 00:46:53,333
Do you know where I can find post
office workers who worked here?

336
00:46:53,405 --> 00:46:55,464
Post office?

337
00:47:03,315 --> 00:47:06,876
Mr. Kim!

338
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,684
It's me. So-hee

339
00:47:21,934 --> 00:47:26,234
This is Songnae River, right?

340
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:30,173
Nothing has changed

341
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:37,378
Do you know where Seung-jae is?

342
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:46,749
He sent me a package
but I can't make out the postmark

343
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:50,352
He sent it to me on my birthday.
I didn't think he'd still do this

344
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:53,660
But I guess he was thinking back to

345
00:47:53,732 --> 00:47:57,065
when we were kids

346
00:48:00,105 --> 00:48:07,034
This postmark is not from Korea

347
00:48:07,112 --> 00:48:10,980
I've never seen it before

348
00:48:15,621 --> 00:48:17,782
Happy birthday

349
00:48:19,225 --> 00:48:21,090
Happy birthday

350
00:48:22,328 --> 00:48:24,762
Much time have passed

351
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:30,325
since we saw each other

352
00:48:30,402 --> 00:48:36,136
I came here because
I missed you so much

353
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:40,440
Now, I can see you

354
00:48:40,512 --> 00:48:43,345
Whenever I close my eyes

355
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:47,351
and say my wish

356
00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:53,949
This is Mars. This is what
we've been chasing after

357
00:48:54,026 --> 00:48:58,053
What we didn't know was
that the whole time

358
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:01,156
it's been right here right in our hearts

359
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:04,634
So we can meet anytime

360
00:49:04,703 --> 00:49:08,139
And get back whenever we want to

361
00:49:08,207 --> 00:49:12,337
Here, where I thought I would come
when I am dead

362
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:15,938
Was just here in our heart

363
00:49:16,015 --> 00:49:20,452
When you have anything
you wish not to forget

364
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:25,149
When you find your most cherished
moment in your heart...

365
00:49:25,224 --> 00:49:29,854
then, we'll see each other there

366
00:49:29,928 --> 00:49:34,991
Until then, take care of yourself
Seung-jae, from Mars

367
00:50:01,927 --> 00:50:05,863
Today...

368
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:10,265
I realized the planet in his story
is the place that I already knew

369
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:14,730
And for the first time in a long time,

370
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:19,267
I sent a letter to Mars
