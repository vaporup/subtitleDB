1
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:20,917
I've been waiting for you.

2
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,070
I know what's on your mind.

3
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,440
You want to see how good you are.

4
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:34,525
Go find out the answer.

5
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,461
Win and loss are only relative.

6
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:51,626
These Japanese wasted their lives away.

7
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:56,402
What a great pity.

8
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:59,908
The Japanese are always like that.

9
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:04,750
Charge forward despite of all obstacles.

10
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:09,952
Many of us Chinese lack this attitude.

11
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:15,891
You will go ahead with the fight then?

12
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:18,530
I've been training for over ten years.

13
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:21,561
It's time to test myself.

14
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,033
Buddha be praised.

15
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:31,073
All things are relative.

16
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:36,842
A duel is not the only alternative.

17
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:38,883
There are other solutions.

18
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:42,088
You're a scholar
and you think differently.

19
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:46,051
For us, a duel is the only way.

20
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:49,988
The Japanese are keen on winning.

21
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,628
You've been at Shaolin for so long.

22
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,825
Are you still so keen on winning?

23
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,459
I can't agree with you more.

24
00:05:57,804 --> 00:06:01,262
Since the Japanese
are so keen on this fight.

25
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:05,410
If we don't participate.

26
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,647
They'll be very disturbed.

27
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,544
And so will our fellow students.

28
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:58,048
Welcome...

29
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:01,017
After you.

30
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:08,926
The Chinese culture
has spread beyond China.

31
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:13,165
It's an achievement to be envied.

32
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:16,534
That's an overstatement.

33
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:22,514
Shaolin martial arts are well known.

34
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:26,980
But they are too conservative.

35
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:30,715
Our temple, however, is flourishing.

36
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:32,951
That's not true.

37
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:38,420
Our knowledge come from our ancestors.

38
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,959
Shaolin has been
the authority for centuries.

39
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:48,204
Your temple can't even come close.

40
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,939
You have 72 techniques.

41
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:56,180
They must come from your ancestors.

42
00:08:56,349 --> 00:09:01,787
How good are your students today?

43
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:07,023
Martial arts are for self-defense.

44
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:09,523
Not for fame seeking.

45
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:15,700
Are you insisting Shaolin is better?

46
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:23,773
The first residents of Japan.

47
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,674
Were immigrants from China.

48
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:34,684
Why do we have to decide who is stronger?

49
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:36,584
I'm sorry

50
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,585
I don't think like you do.

51
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:46,026
I just want to confirm something.

52
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:51,796
I'm neither good nor the representative.

53
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:56,805
I assume you came for the Fight.

54
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:07,182
Can't anybody in Shaolin fight me?

55
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:17,229
I didn't know Shaolin was that bad.

56
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:20,659
I'm disappointed.

57
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,465
Please teach me.

58
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:52,790
Pardon me.

59
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:04,807
Your techniques are so impressive.

60
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:07,573
You are flattering me.

61
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:12,250
I'm not even ranked in Japan.

62
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:17,614
I'm just lucky this time.

63
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:25,592
One should treat one's guest nicely.

64
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:34,832
Our representative Hashimoto is the best.

65
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:39,778
We'll wait for your representative
on Sept. 2.

66
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:41,870
Goodbye.

67
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:46,648
Buddha be praised.

68
00:11:57,797 --> 00:12:00,561
Your techniques just now.

69
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:04,102
Have really impressed the Japanese.

70
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:06,805
I know you dislike his elegance.

71
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:08,935
You take him as a guest.

72
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:11,542
But we couldn't let him think
we're scared.

73
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:15,637
That's why I taught him a lesson.

74
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:18,911
I appreciate that.

75
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:24,180
I've gotten to know you
through these years.

76
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:29,356
I hope when the day comes.

77
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:31,760
You can beat Hashimoto.

78
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,935
I have to take off at dawn.

79
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:43,107
You should visit with your teacher.

80
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,446
Why did you hit me so hard?

81
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:29,883
I didn't.

82
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,081
Stop lying.

83
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,051
You're just not my match.

84
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,027
I'll make you change your mind.

85
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,328
Uncle.

86
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,933
He'll have to look for heIp.

87
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,839
Are you kidding?

88
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:50,839
Get down quickly.

89
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:52,701
Thanks.

90
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:55,679
Are you kidding? Get down quickly.

91
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:58,041
Come!

92
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:03,081
Hit him, hit...

93
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:13,992
What is useIess...

94
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:21,906
I beat him.

95
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:26,077
Thanks. Goodbye!

96
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,811
Good day, my General.

97
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:11,287
The reputation of Japanese martial arts.

98
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,324
You have on your shoulders.

99
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:16,626
I won't disappoint you, my General.

100
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:21,289
Make good use of this sword.

101
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:22,659
Yes.

102
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:28,772
Thank you, my General.

103
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:04,032
- Are you going dancing?
- Go!

104
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,698
Let go.

105
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:32,759
Cheers.

106
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:35,901
Cheers.

107
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:39,198
Teacher...

108
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:43,433
I hope you'll bring glory to our school.

109
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,502
Yes.

110
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:02,156
Eagle, come here.

111
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,994
Cheers...

112
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,057
- Let's toast again.

113
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:21,509
Don't let EagIe slip away.

114
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:25,412
EagIe, don't go. Cheers.

115
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,147
I want to go home.

116
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:32,156
Don't go home, come in...

117
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:04,616
Who are you?

118
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,677
Teacher!

119
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:44,129
To die in combat is a warrior's honor.

120
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,622
Yes.

121
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:52,936
You've to bring glory to our school.

122
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:57,940
- Recite Chapter One of our Manual.
- Yes.

123
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:04,275
Win every time you fight.

124
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,450
That's our first motto.

125
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:10,487
Be ruthless when you fight.

126
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:14,588
Kill God if God's in your way.

127
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:19,263
Kill Buddha if Buddha is in your way.

128
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:24,430
Have this attitude and sky's the limit.

129
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:28,403
Don't be scared by any obstacIe.

130
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:31,440
Be it God or the devil.

131
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:35,675
Get rid of all obstacles fearlessly.

132
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:10,802
Dragon.

133
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:18,916
- Where's teacher?
- Here he is.

134
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:27,851
Catch me, toes...

135
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:32,392
Serve you right.

136
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:34,462
Damn dragon!

137
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:39,961
Don't be tease him.

138
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:43,803
You just wait and see.

139
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:48,439
Why didn't you catch me?

140
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:50,242
Why shouId I listen to you?

141
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:51,839
You never mean what you say.

142
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:56,076
What do you need me for?

143
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:59,252
I'm coming to see Dragon.

144
00:22:59,358 --> 00:23:01,019
You just happen to be with him.

145
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:02,457
Very funny.

146
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:03,595
Don't climb that high?

147
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:06,560
Are those monks young?

148
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,061
Dragon, come here.

149
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,337
- Am I very oId?
- You're dying.

150
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,971
No dinner for you this month.

151
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,245
Don't you worry.

152
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:25,307
You take care of yourseIf.

153
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:32,948
Don't you make me lose face.

154
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,254
Don't come back if you lose.

155
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:39,558
I wouldn't even be alive then.

156
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:42,692
I would wait for you in hell.

157
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:49,972
I just don't know
how good your tutors are.

158
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:53,276
You're the one who brought me to them.

159
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:56,142
You still hate me for that?

160
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:57,507
I know it's for my own good.

161
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:02,412
I knew you would be that best of China.

162
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:05,053
- I won't let you down.
- He's a Iiar.

163
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,952
He wants you dumb.

164
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,515
That's why you brought me up?

165
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:09,594
Don't you like the glamour?

166
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:11,856
I owe you, so I go to this fight.

167
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:14,363
I didn't bring you up so that you owe me.

168
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:16,934
Why are you so keen on winning?

169
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:19,730
Let's go, Dragon.

170
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,676
Do whatever you like.

171
00:24:25,577 --> 00:24:29,513
I regret having brought you up.

172
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:34,783
The old man can't be irritated.

173
00:24:34,953 --> 00:24:36,545
- Who says so?
- Teacher.

174
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:43,393
Are you all right?

175
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:46,896
- Don't call me teacher.
- Teacher.

176
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:50,196
I'll win the fight for you.

177
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:57,938
You take care of teacher.

178
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,046
Goodbye.

179
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,210
You like him.

180
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:12,115
Shut up!

181
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:41,415
Hashimoto's trip to China

182
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:44,918
is to prove
the Japanese sword is invincibIe.

183
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:48,022
Have respect to the Lord of the Sword.

184
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:07,643
This is what the Chinese use?

185
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:11,045
Put it down or you'll pay for it.

186
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,280
Go away,
I don't do business with Japanese.

187
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:17,881
There's no room
for your elegance in China.

188
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:46,310
- There are tables upstairs.
- OK.

189
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:51,552
Terrific.

190
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:57,853
Paint. Hurry.

191
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:01,462
Is it ready yet?

192
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,530
Let me finish these two words.

193
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:08,236
Don't drag your feet.

194
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:11,437
May I take a look?

195
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:13,511
It's done.

196
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,642
Here is...

197
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:18,713
Does it look like the Lord of the Sword?

198
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,147
Is the Lord like this?

199
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,914
This looks like the Lord of the Lance.

200
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:25,387
That's true.

201
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,618
How do you know?

202
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:34,791
The Lord of the Sword has to be bearded.

203
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,024
You're all ignorant.

204
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:40,899
The King once ordered me
to paint the Lord.

205
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:47,242
What are his chances against Hashimoto?

206
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:48,745
I don't know,

207
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:52,314
that's why I want to be there.

208
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:55,783
That's why this duel is so fascinating.

209
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:58,883
Can I come aIong?

210
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:01,959
They wouldn't reject your guest,
wouId they?

211
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:06,695
They only sent out 30 invitations.

212
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:11,459
The famous martial artists
of the various schooIs.

213
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,030
You'd better not go.

214
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:19,335
Cheers.

215
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:30,121
You still have time to surrender.

216
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,323
A samurai doesn't lose that easily.

217
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:37,554
I'll cut you up like I cut fish.

218
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:41,257
I'll peel you like I peel carrots.

219
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:43,661
- Cut...
- Peel...

220
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:55,178
Hurry.

221
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:12,196
Should I strip his undershirt?

222
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,127
Why not his undershort too?

223
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:16,097
Watch closely.

224
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:22,035
Ok, it is ugly.

225
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,944
Thank you my friends.

226
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:38,989
Old man...

227
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:43,650
Old man.

228
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:48,327
Hold it.

229
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:59,102
An eye for an eye.

230
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:08,145
Don't you regret later.

231
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:13,724
Take this.

232
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:22,228
Why did he kill that innocent old man?

233
00:30:48,627 --> 00:30:50,492
Please help him with the funeral.

234
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,898
Swords usually bring trouble.

235
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,174
Are you Hashimoto?

236
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:14,306
Will you fight me?

237
00:32:14,613 --> 00:32:16,604
I have only one opponent.

238
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:17,875
Who is me.

239
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:50,772
I don't fight with women.

240
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:34,019
Are you Kenji?

241
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,729
The General sent me to accompany you.

242
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:39,989
Thank you.

243
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:48,069
Are you confident about the fight?

244
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:54,875
I'll do my best.

245
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:55,897
How bad is your wound?

246
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:58,227
I'll Iive.

247
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,440
You're so good with the sword.

248
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:12,277
I've made a fool of myseIf.

249
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:15,443
I don't think you have.

250
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:36,839
Can you get some more firewood?

251
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:52,081
I want you to tell me something.

252
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:56,082
Why do you disguise as a man?

253
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:19,903
Why do Chinese pick
the Plum Blossom as symbol?

254
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,275
Chinese have a complex
for their own tiny.

255
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:28,246
You're wrong.

256
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:33,547
The Plum Blossom is elegant
and has great endurance.

257
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:36,559
A perfect symbol
of the Chinese character.

258
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:43,866
What symbolizes your country best?

259
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:51,702
The Cherry Blossom.

260
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:55,802
It's most glamorous moments.

261
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:57,980
Are hard to be forgotten.

262
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,146
Well said.

263
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:15,726
Gentleman.

264
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:19,068
Gentleman.

265
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:28,134
Let me introduce,

266
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,408
this is the Lord's son.

267
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:33,248
We've met.

268
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:43,352
My father's waiting in the garden.

269
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,573
Father, they're here.

270
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,842
Welcome to my house.

271
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:39,305
How are you sir?

272
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:42,547
I'm in the middle of the lake.

273
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:46,449
Why don't you join me?

274
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:11,306
You're a brilliant martial artist.

275
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:12,873
You're flattering me.

276
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:16,581
It's been very quiet around here.

277
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:19,754
I'm so glad you two came today.

278
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:23,551
Let's go to the WieIding Rock.

279
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:24,593
Sure.

280
00:41:51,622 --> 00:41:56,423
All the Sino-Japanese duelists
in the past and left their names here.

281
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,233
Why were all the duels held here?

282
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:09,970
Our grand grandfather
attended the first duel.

283
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:15,635
And this has become the arena ever since.

284
00:42:16,113 --> 00:42:19,879
Few have been able to enter the cave.

285
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:24,049
They're seldom as young as you're.

286
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:33,062
AII swordsman dream of coming here.

287
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:40,097
And leave their names on this stone.

288
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:43,171
That would top any other honor in life.

289
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:46,235
But duels do not have to fatal.

290
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:47,775
They should just be friendly meets.

291
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:52,973
To conquer one's opponent is a glory.

292
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:59,146
I know you're the best in Japan.

293
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:01,951
You may not know our history though.

294
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,396
We're not allowed to attend the duels.

295
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:12,496
But I can assure you two

296
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:15,666
We're stil the best.

297
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,809
My teacher always
taIks about your school.

298
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:25,512
You're contributed tremendously,

299
00:43:25,816 --> 00:43:28,114
towards the perfection of the art.

300
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:31,082
I'm glad he remembers.

301
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:38,187
Reputation survives generations.

302
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:49,272
We'll attend the duel again some day.

303
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:21,654
Buddha be praised.

304
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,428
Actually all duelists know.

305
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,930
That death is the real winner.

306
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:02,232
I wonder who would be
standing here next time.

307
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:05,872
Having the same conversation
we're having.

308
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:08,502
Let's go.

309
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:50,070
Gentleman.

310
00:47:53,384 --> 00:47:56,410
I'm sorry about the explosion.

311
00:47:56,854 --> 00:48:00,153
I wonder how he knew where we were.

312
00:48:00,758 --> 00:48:02,726
My father's looking into this.

313
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:04,593
You're well informed.

314
00:48:04,728 --> 00:48:07,253
We've tightened security.

315
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:10,794
There won't be anymore incidents.

316
00:48:11,835 --> 00:48:16,363
He didn't have any respect
for your school.

317
00:48:16,574 --> 00:48:18,838
He'll regret it.

318
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:21,811
When I first met you.

319
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:24,173
I was curious about you.

320
00:48:24,648 --> 00:48:26,673
Such a nice gentleman.

321
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:30,580
You didn't know I was a woman.

322
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:34,490
Don't you know you fight like a woman?

323
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,152
So you noticed?

324
00:48:39,496 --> 00:48:42,465
I like brave peopIe.

325
00:48:47,504 --> 00:48:52,737
Why do you still dress like that?

326
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:55,102
I've always been like that.

327
00:48:55,479 --> 00:48:58,846
You'd look better with some makeup.

328
00:49:56,573 --> 00:49:58,734
- Father.
- Where have you been?

329
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:00,938
I just took a walk.

330
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:08,311
Our school was number one.

331
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:16,886
Until the time I lost.

332
00:50:18,262 --> 00:50:23,325
The duelists had always
been our ancestors.

333
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:28,704
Defending China against Japan.

334
00:50:30,074 --> 00:50:33,441
You have to do your best.

335
00:50:34,745 --> 00:50:36,679
Can you?

336
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,219
You listen to other peopIe so easily.

337
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:46,953
I'm really disappointed.

338
00:50:50,494 --> 00:50:54,328
I'm sorry, father!

339
00:50:56,633 --> 00:50:59,101
I'm not blaming you.

340
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:04,437
I've put all my hopes in you.

341
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:08,307
We can't let our ancestors down.

342
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:21,812
I'm so glad you two are not injured.

343
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:26,049
Otherwise everyone
would hold me responsible.

344
00:52:27,658 --> 00:52:32,061
PIease accept my gratitude.

345
00:52:37,868 --> 00:52:42,066
PIease don't mention it.

346
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:47,935
You two are visiting.

347
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:51,844
I hope you have a pleasant stay here.

348
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:53,416
Thank you.

349
00:53:07,965 --> 00:53:09,865
China deserves its reputation.

350
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:15,135
We seldom find such good food in Japan.

351
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:19,239
No wonder you're so jealous of us.

352
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:20,568
Sheng Nan.

353
00:53:21,078 --> 00:53:23,706
There are always some bad exceptions.

354
00:53:23,814 --> 00:53:28,547
We despise them just as you do.

355
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:36,823
You're such a man of dignity.

356
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:41,992
Let's drink to our friendship.

357
00:53:50,307 --> 00:53:54,209
Why aren't the guests here yet?

358
00:53:54,978 --> 00:53:56,275
Don't worry.

359
00:53:57,047 --> 00:54:00,744
They won't miss this wonderful duel.

360
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:07,453
You should learn techniques
from our visitors.

361
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:10,117
Not at all.

362
00:54:11,428 --> 00:54:15,262
PIease enlighten me.

363
00:54:15,632 --> 00:54:17,600
Cheers.

364
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:19,163
PIease...

365
00:54:21,305 --> 00:54:22,465
Cheers.

366
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:33,509
Such a waste of good wine.

367
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:36,080
He's gone.

368
00:55:31,842 --> 00:55:33,070
Nice pursuit.

369
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:43,017
Such disgusting conduct from a priest.

370
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,817
One should never forget one's race.

371
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:49,782
You insulted our school.

372
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:52,020
I came on the General's order.

373
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:55,227
The General?

374
00:55:58,268 --> 00:56:00,202
I've been waiting for you to say this.

375
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:06,371
I've been ordered.

376
00:56:06,677 --> 00:56:09,168
To handle the duel.

377
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,375
Whoever's in my way.

378
00:56:11,848 --> 00:56:14,817
Will not be spared.

379
00:56:16,953 --> 00:56:20,286
Let's have a fair duel.

380
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:27,791
We're on the same side.

381
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:30,357
Working for the same General.

382
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:37,132
Why did the General give me a sword?

383
00:56:41,445 --> 00:56:43,640
He's got it all planned.

384
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:50,013
He wants to kidnap the spectators.

385
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:55,520
The Lord would take care of
the young man.

386
00:56:56,026 --> 00:56:57,755
So his daughter will fight you.

387
00:56:58,328 --> 00:56:59,920
But you must lose.

388
00:57:00,263 --> 00:57:04,927
The General wants a grasp of
Chinese martial arts.

389
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:11,230
Why me though?

390
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:21,513
The General has always
befriended your school.

391
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,595
How are you reacting to the tombstones?

392
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,139
Why did they do it?

393
00:59:03,854 --> 00:59:07,051
It's all for glory's sake.

394
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,252
Must a martial artist always win?

395
00:59:14,865 --> 00:59:16,890
Even at the risk of his life?

396
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:19,764
Most people think so.

397
00:59:20,904 --> 00:59:22,929
I hope you're not one of them.

398
00:59:26,977 --> 00:59:29,207
But this duel's important to me.

399
00:59:29,346 --> 00:59:30,813
It's a big test.

400
00:59:32,182 --> 00:59:35,379
WouId you give it up for a man?

401
00:59:44,227 --> 00:59:46,320
I don't want to see casualties.

402
00:59:49,299 --> 00:59:50,823
You're afraid of me losing?

403
00:59:52,602 --> 00:59:54,627
- Can you...?
- Impossible.

404
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,808
Tomorrow we'll be opponents.

405
01:00:40,984 --> 01:00:44,078
I'll do my best no matter what.

406
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:48,317
If I can't bring
your sword to my teacher.

407
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:55,187
I'll die in China.

408
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:03,498
Being a martial artist is sad.

409
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:09,801
You'll be killed if you're no good.

410
01:01:10,246 --> 01:01:13,545
And if you're good.

411
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:17,611
You'll be challenged constantly.

412
01:01:18,088 --> 01:01:18,884
You're regretting?

413
01:01:18,989 --> 01:01:22,720
I'm not. Are you?

414
01:01:22,926 --> 01:01:24,257
No.

415
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:29,596
Do you smell something fishy around here?

416
01:01:31,301 --> 01:01:36,568
This duel will not be a fair one.

417
01:01:38,842 --> 01:01:40,867
I trust you though.

418
01:01:44,948 --> 01:01:46,939
We'll have a fair duel.

419
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:47,742
The Lord.

420
01:02:47,844 --> 01:02:50,142
Go rescue my daughter.

421
01:03:09,899 --> 01:03:10,866
Uncle.

422
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:17,028
Uncle.

423
01:03:32,822 --> 01:03:33,948
Hey!

424
01:03:39,696 --> 01:03:43,928
A real swordsman won't be disillusioned.

425
01:03:44,968 --> 01:03:47,163
You thought my legs were cut off?

426
01:03:48,271 --> 01:03:51,240
I was born a cripple.

427
01:03:51,741 --> 01:03:55,472
That's how you became representative.

428
01:03:55,912 --> 01:04:01,578
A cripple can beat you.

429
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:35,878
Where's the kid?

430
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:43,183
This is such a shameful act.

431
01:04:45,228 --> 01:04:48,026
I'll fight and kill you.

432
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:54,962
My sword kills those
who betray their countries.

433
01:04:55,572 --> 01:04:56,766
What?

434
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:05,509
And the disappearance of the celebrities.

435
01:05:05,682 --> 01:05:07,274
Put every martial artist in shock.

436
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:10,442
We may be the prime suspects.

437
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:16,816
An evacuation of the hostages in 2 days.

438
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:19,594
Yet Hashimoto is so stubborn.

439
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:21,060
Don't worry.

440
01:05:22,398 --> 01:05:25,526
He'll obey the General.

441
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:29,737
Your wish will soon be fulfilled.

442
01:05:32,475 --> 01:05:36,002
How could you do it?

443
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:41,276
My dear.

444
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:45,878
You're a bastard.

445
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,382
What are you doing here?

446
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:50,349
I'll do anything for you.

447
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:54,352
But I can't let China down.

448
01:05:55,565 --> 01:05:59,001
We'll be despised.

449
01:06:01,104 --> 01:06:03,129
Listen to me.

450
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:07,232
I've made my decision already.

451
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:10,677
Then I can't obey you.

452
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:16,980
Have you forgotten
about your responsibility?

453
01:06:19,689 --> 01:06:21,589
We can't be immoral.

454
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:50,184
I'll get the antidote.

455
01:07:16,312 --> 01:07:19,406
You still don't see it.

456
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:24,115
Father.

457
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:27,155
You helped someone to oppose your father.

458
01:07:39,402 --> 01:07:45,136
You thought it would be easy.

459
01:07:51,414 --> 01:07:55,145
The General won't really support you.

460
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:58,418
The Japanese have always
been jealous of us.

461
01:07:58,588 --> 01:08:00,954
You want to be a puppet of theirs?

462
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:05,391
Think again!

463
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:12,000
I'll do anything for you.

464
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:16,934
Except betraying China
and ruining our reputation.

465
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,873
To the point of no return.

466
01:08:20,076 --> 01:08:25,241
But we've been despised
by our own people.

467
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:29,977
Our ancestors did a lot for China.

468
01:08:31,788 --> 01:08:33,881
But nobody said thank you.

469
01:08:34,891 --> 01:08:39,157
We weren't selected to be duelists.

470
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:46,901
Even though our techniques
are better than the Shaolin monks.

471
01:08:49,672 --> 01:08:53,005
My father has always been dreaming.

472
01:08:53,309 --> 01:08:56,039
To regain the No.1 school reputation.

473
01:08:56,746 --> 01:09:00,341
We'll have to fight today.

474
01:09:00,616 --> 01:09:05,349
Can only ruin your reputation.

475
01:09:07,657 --> 01:09:08,681
Be careful.

476
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:46,326
Father.

477
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:57,105
Sheng Nan.

478
01:09:57,273 --> 01:10:02,006
PIease don't kill my father.

479
01:10:07,183 --> 01:10:10,641
Sheng Nan...

480
01:10:11,187 --> 01:10:16,921
Get up, we'll start again.

481
01:10:18,494 --> 01:10:21,793
We'll regain our reputation.

482
01:10:22,798 --> 01:10:30,762
Get up. I'll teach you some techniques.

483
01:10:31,874 --> 01:10:37,642
We'll start all over.

484
01:11:03,105 --> 01:11:04,197
Hold it!

485
01:11:13,082 --> 01:11:14,674
I won't let you do that.

486
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:21,319
Have you forgotten the General's order?

487
01:11:24,293 --> 01:11:29,196
I've to fulfill
the wish of my late teacher.

488
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:32,491
Are you disobeying the General?

489
01:11:32,835 --> 01:11:34,200
I order you to commit suicide.

490
01:11:35,304 --> 01:11:40,469
I'll die after the duel.

491
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:32,906
You can't kill us all.

492
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:23,657
We've still got some unfinished business.

493
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:31,538
Don't you think the whole thing
has turned meaningless?

494
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:37,208
You made me a promise though.

495
01:15:37,713 --> 01:15:39,840
I won't fight you.

496
01:15:43,085 --> 01:15:44,347
You must.

497
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,994
Winning is that important to you?

498
01:15:54,597 --> 01:15:57,088
If someone dear to you will die.

499
01:15:57,299 --> 01:15:58,561
WiII you still go ahead?

500
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:01,461
Too many have died because of this.

501
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:10,506
Uncle...

502
01:19:35,784 --> 01:19:37,274
This one is for you.

503
01:19:42,891 --> 01:19:46,019
Do we need to fight like this?
