1
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,919
As in every stone of this size,
there is a flaw.

2
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:37,474
- A flaw?
- The slightest flaw, Your Excellency.

3
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:39,104
If you look deep into the stone,

4
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,381
you will perceive
the tiniest discoloration.

5
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:43,937
It resembles an animal.

6
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:46,754
- An animal?
- A leaping panther.

7
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:50,912
Yes. A pink panther.

8
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,225
Come here, Dala.

9
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:04,578
A gift for your father
from his grateful people.

10
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:06,536
Someday it will be yours.

11
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,351
The most fabulous diamond
in all the world.

12
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,432
Come closer.

13
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:50,405
Okay. Thanks a lot, fellas.
Don't forget to take the wardrobe back.

14
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,331
How do you want them,
matte or glossy?

15
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:54,251
I want it right away.
I'm in a hurry.

16
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:56,171
You can't rush a genius.

17
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,372
I'll rush.

18
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,257
Don't forget
about the wardrobe.

19
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:10,151
What you doing?

20
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:13,195
Where is everybody?

21
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:20,197
- Come out of there!
- Who is it?

22
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:22,308
Come out,
or we'll bust the door in!

23
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:24,234
Just a minute.

24
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:27,490
- Can I help you?
- Where is he?

25
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:29,484
- Where's who?
- George Litton.

26
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,613
He owes me 40 grand,
and nobody welshes on Big Joe.

27
00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:35,531
Look, Big Joe,
I'm not a bill collector.

28
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:38,182
I'm a photographer.
Just took his picture.

29
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:40,586
- What kind of a picture?
- Graduation picture.

30
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:42,442
- His what?
- Graduation.

31
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,556
Get him!

32
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,892
They're worth half a million.
We'll settle for 300,000.

33
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:29,542
I'll do what I can,
but the merchandise is extremely hot.

34
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:51,303
You stay here.
Come with me.

35
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:06,185
Come on!

36
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:30,603
- Pardon, madame.
- Certainly.

37
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:33,506
She's gone down.
Come on!

38
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:00,548
We must find that woman.

39
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:05,798
What did you say?

40
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:07,756
We don't have
much of a description.

41
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:12,676
About 5'7", black hair,
wearing a light beige coat.

42
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:15,651
The fools let that fence escape.
He might have talked.

43
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:17,481
- We will catch him.
- We must.

44
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:18,956
We must find that woman.

45
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:21,574
She is our first positive link
with the Phantom.

46
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:28,171
<i>- Yes?
- Your wife to see you, Inspector.</i>

47
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,726
Send her in, please.
Henri, that will be all.

48
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:38,924
- Hello, my darling.
- My angel.

49
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:29,676
Amber, how are you?

50
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,580
Hello, Duchess.
So glad you could come.

51
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:47,075
Have fun, children.
How are you?

52
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:48,904
Hello, darling!

53
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:51,373
You know Monica?

54
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:54,023
Of course. You were
simply stunning in your last film.

55
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:59,015
- What's he say?
- He says hello,

56
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,006
and he would like you
to meet his cousin.

57
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:06,602
- His third cousin.
- That does make a difference.

58
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,597
- Who is that?
- Princess Dala.

59
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,481
Excuse me.

60
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,191
Yes?

61
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:36,776
Miss Angela Dunning.

62
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:44,109
- Yes?
- Your Highness?

63
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:45,155
Yes.

64
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:48,207
Here I am again,
Your Highness.

65
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:51,117
I was having a cocktail party,
and I saw you driving by...

66
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,414
I just know you'd enjoy it.
Yes, you'd just love it...

67
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,477
Your Highness.

68
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:13,798
Hello there.

69
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:16,325
I can't tell you
what an honor this is.

70
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:18,798
Everyone's just dying to meet you.

71
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,702
- Good morning, Your Highness.
- Good morning.

72
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:36,196
- You're a wonderful skier.
- Thank you.

73
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:37,231
Help!

74
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:43,275
Somebody's taking my sleigh.
Amber! My dog.

75
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:45,931
Leave this to me, ma'am.

76
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:55,406
- What happened?
- I don't know.

77
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:59,181
There was a man with a gun,
and he took the sleigh and Amber.

78
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:11,244
We'll only be here a few days.

79
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,278
It will be a wonderful chance
for a beautiful vacation.

80
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,949
Excuse me.
My leg is caught.

81
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:20,999
I apologize
for this inconvenience.

82
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:25,831
Do you know who that was?
That was Sir Charles Litton.

83
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:27,791
- Really?
- Yes.

84
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:30,736
I am Inspector Clouseau.
This is Madame Clouseau.

85
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:36,297
All right. Thank you.

86
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:42,158
I'm sorry, my darling.

87
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,873
- It's all right, my darling.
- Excuse me.

88
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:48,239
Do you know that
you're really amazing?

89
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:49,416
So you've said.

90
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:54,217
How you can manage
on a police inspector's salary.

91
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,939
How many women could save
enough out of their housekeeping

92
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,560
to buy such a beautiful
mink coat as this?

93
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:01,290
It's not easy.

94
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,913
You are a constant
and desirable contradiction.

95
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:06,405
I'm simply
a woman in love, my darling.

96
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:07,591
My darling.

97
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:16,778
I'm sorry, my darling.
Please excuse me.

98
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,960
It's all right.

99
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,164
Did I hurt you?
Are you all right?

100
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:22,889
- Yes, I'm fine.
- You sure?

101
00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:25,262
- Yes, I am.
- My darling, I'm so sorry.

102
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:30,794
I have a little business
to conclude with the manager.

103
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:31,976
Yes?

104
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:35,917
After which, I'll return
to you immediately.

105
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:37,928
Bye, darling.

106
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:53,392
It's all right.

107
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:23,052
- How did it go?
- Perfectly.

108
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:32,912
Come in.

109
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:42,122
Princess Dala
is concerned about your injuries.

110
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:43,631
Please thank the princess.

111
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:46,063
Tell her thereâ€™s nothing
to be concerned about.

112
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:47,949
It's really not too serious.

113
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:50,089
In that case, Her Highness
has instructed me

114
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:53,062
to invite you for dinner
this evening, 8:00 at her chalet.

115
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,926
I'd be delighted to come.

116
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:10,218
<i>You know Signor Tucker
from Lloyd's of London.</i>

117
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,598
- Hello.
- Hello, old bean.

118
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:13,421
Your company
insures the Pink Panther.

119
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:14,731
Yes, for half a million.

120
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,459
- Pounds?
- Sterling.

121
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,634
The Phantom could not resist
the Pink Panther.

122
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:20,647
He will most certainly
make an attempt.

123
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:23,339
When he does, I shall
be waiting for him. Excuse me.

124
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:24,782
If I understand your theory,

125
00:18:24,881 --> 00:18:26,605
the Phantom is
one of Miss Dunning's guests.

126
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,778
That is the theory.
I would like to have from you

127
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:31,598
the names of those guests,
also the location of their rooms.

128
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:33,006
Of course!

129
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:35,626
I assume that the Princess Dala
has the jewel with her.

130
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:38,063
She'd only tell me
it was in a safe place.

131
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:40,910
I suppose if it isn't here,
it's at her villa in Rome.

132
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,832
My men are watching that villa.

133
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,712
With such planning,
how can the Phantom succeed?

134
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,711
With such planning,
he's succeeded for 20 years.

135
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:52,046
It's a mistake to underestimate him,
as the inspector can tell you.

136
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:54,927
The shrewdest, most ingenious
criminal in all the world.

137
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:57,775
- And you have never seen him?
- I've seen him once.

138
00:18:57,874 --> 00:19:00,045
Five years ago,
got a fleeting glimpse...

139
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,448
Excuse me.

140
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:04,650
Got a fleeting glimpse of him
as he made his getaway.

141
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:06,794
In a strange way,
I admire that man.

142
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:10,607
He has... how would you say...
a unique flair for the dramatic.

143
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:14,828
- He waved good-bye to me.
- Fascinating.

144
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:19,851
But this time, gentlemen,
I shall be waving good-bye to him...

145
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:21,776
on his way to prison.

146
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:25,513
Good evening.

147
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,660
Make yourself comfortable.
Her Highness will join you in a moment.

148
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:34,445
- May I give you a drink?
- I'd like a brandy, thank you.

149
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,635
Your Highness.

150
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:52,461
Good evening, Sir Charles.

151
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:55,497
Any news from the police
about your dear little dog?

152
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:57,674
They expect I'll receive
a ransom note.

153
00:19:57,778 --> 00:20:00,559
I am deeply grateful
for what you tried to do.

154
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,836
Ma'am, it was nothing.

155
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:04,306
Thank you.

156
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:07,215
- Please sit down.
- Aren't you drinking?

157
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:09,321
- I don't drink.
- Not ever?

158
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:13,574
I'm quite content with reality.
I have no need for escape.

159
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:16,400
I enjoy reality
as much as the next man.

160
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:17,775
In my case, fortunately,

161
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,722
reality includes a good,
stiff belt every now and then.

162
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:24,014
- On the other hand, I don't smoke.
- You're right. It's a nasty habit.

163
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:27,049
Here's to those nasty little habits
that we hold so dear.

164
00:20:27,154 --> 00:20:28,103
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

165
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,065
I beg your pardon?

166
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:33,648
Let's just say
in this case, it means...

167
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:36,397
your health and thank you
for inviting me to dinner.

168
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:40,273
It's not often I have the chance
to dine alone with a beautiful princess.

169
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:44,363
I hate to disappoint you,
but I'm afraid this isn't the night.

170
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:48,939
- But I understood that...
- We're having dinner, but not alone.

171
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:58,481
At last! Hello!

172
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:01,393
We've been through icicles
up to our you-know-whats!

173
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,694
Your Highness!

174
00:21:03,794 --> 00:21:07,919
I think it's too darling of you
to invite me here tonight.

175
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,636
- You've made Cortina for me.
- Hello, lover.

176
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:12,047
Hello, dear boy.

177
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:15,404
Don't you move a muscle, darling.

178
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,776
Isn't he wonderful, Your Highness?

179
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:20,362
Such a magnificent sacrifice.

180
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:25,547
Good evening, sir.

181
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:56,878
May I have a cigarette,
my darling?

182
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:58,156
Yes, of course, my darling.

183
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,937
- There you are, my love.
- Thank you.

184
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:06,734
- Yes, sir?
- Scotch on the rocks.

185
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:13,202
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

186
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:15,019
Thank you very much.

187
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:19,690
I'm looking for my uncle,
Sir Charles Litton.

188
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,339
- Darling.
- May I get you some water?

189
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:28,778
- Hold your hands over your head.
- Yes, my darling. Bend forward.

190
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:31,850
- Darling, I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

191
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:33,384
Are you all right, my darling?

192
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:35,123
What?

193
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,865
- My darling?
- I'll be right back.

194
00:22:37,971 --> 00:22:38,920
Yes, darling.

195
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,162
Please.

196
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,580
She's got a cough
in her throat, you know.

197
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:12,210
And what do you think?
She turned out to be a man!

198
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,346
It's true! It's quite true!

199
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:17,451
Your Highness, you really must
let me give you a party.

200
00:23:17,555 --> 00:23:20,904
I can positively guarantee
it'll be a party to end all parties.

201
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:22,026
I'm sure it will.

202
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:23,888
Perhaps Her Highness
has other plans.

203
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:27,915
On the contrary. Sounds like fun.
Will you include Sir Charles?

204
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:31,561
No. Charles is
having a fling in Capri.

205
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:33,042
He has his own parties.

206
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,506
Yes, I've read about
some of his parties.

207
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:38,091
They're wonderful.
We call him the juggler.

208
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:40,203
I've never really known
a man like him.

209
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:43,853
He can keep ten girls in the air
at once and make each one happy.

210
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,672
Amazing. Sort of
a contemporary Don Juan.

211
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:48,844
- That's it.
- But there's a difference.

212
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:52,525
Sir Charles' predecessor was forced
to climb balconies and fight duels,

213
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:56,043
and, as I understand it,
keep his women separate.

214
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,995
Charles, on the other hand,
drives a Ferrari,

215
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:01,808
enters with a key,
and resorts to collective bargaining.

216
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,072
But they both have
something in common.

217
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:08,750
- What's that, Your Highness?
- Maybe it's best forgotten.

218
00:24:08,851 --> 00:24:10,793
Don't be silly.
Charles doesn't mind.

219
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:13,005
Everyone takes a potshot
at Charles sooner or later.

220
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,352
Go ahead, ma'am, shoot.

221
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:17,713
It seems to me
any middle-aged bachelor

222
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:21,128
who has never desired
the basic rewards of wife and family

223
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:24,531
and finds it necessary to occupy
the major portion of his life

224
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:26,416
making one conquest after another

225
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:29,931
is trying to prove something
he can never possibly prove.

226
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,010
- And what's that?
- That he's a man.

227
00:24:32,116 --> 00:24:34,188
You're joking!

228
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:37,042
It's somewhat complicated,
but basically sound.

229
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,725
- Well, Charles?
- Not very original.

230
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:42,642
That theory has become
rather a tired Freudian clichÃ©.

231
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,872
- But true.
- I've never been on the couch.

232
00:24:45,972 --> 00:24:48,307
Not true.
That's part of your problem.

233
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:53,618
How refreshing to find royalty
possessed of such a perceptive wit.

234
00:24:53,716 --> 00:24:56,366
Charles, you going
to take that lying down?

235
00:24:56,468 --> 00:24:57,646
Yes, as a matter of fact.

236
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,781
My leg is hurting rather badly.
May I be excused?

237
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,034
- I'll be damned.
- I can't believe it.

238
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:09,005
- The leg?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

239
00:25:09,973 --> 00:25:13,201
That goes to prove
there's a first time for everything.

240
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,642
Got a terrific laugh, anyway.

241
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:23,219
Simone!

242
00:26:30,613 --> 00:26:33,428
Jacques, I'm still cold.

243
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,466
Perhaps another blanket,
my darling.

244
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:37,747
All right, darling.

245
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:14,291
There you are, my darling.

246
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:20,786
- Yes, darling?
- The light.

247
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:42,578
- What?
- I'm sorry. It doesn't help.

248
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:47,344
Perhaps a hot glass of milk.

249
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:52,911
But I think the room service
has finished, my love.

250
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:55,184
Yes, of course.
I forgot.

251
00:27:55,285 --> 00:27:56,212
You see?

252
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,385
They're all gone now.

253
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:01,296
Well, no matter.

254
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:06,164
You see...

255
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:11,891
If my little pigeon
wants a glass of milk...

256
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:13,812
she shall have one...

257
00:28:15,637 --> 00:28:19,183
...even if I have to force them
to open the kitchen.

258
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:23,915
She shall have milk
wherever she goes, hot or cold.

259
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:26,225
- Hot.
- I know. That's what I said.

260
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,005
Open the door.

261
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,244
Darling, I need to talk to you.

262
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,623
I've sent Jacques for some milk.
I only have a moment.

263
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:24,370
- Let's make the most of it.
- No! Stop it.

264
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,859
- It was your idea.
- Yes, but you're the wrong...

265
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:30,032
The wrong what? Man?
You think I was...

266
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:33,451
No. I thought you were exactly
who you are, but I'm too impulsive.

267
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:35,151
This is not the right way.

268
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:38,672
Another time.

269
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:17,483
- Here you are, my beloved.
- Thank you.

270
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:20,462
It's all they had.

271
00:30:21,303 --> 00:30:24,783
Can't get a thing in this hotel.
I had to force them to give me that.

272
00:30:24,886 --> 00:30:25,868
Never mind.

273
00:30:36,758 --> 00:30:39,377
My darling, lovely darling.

274
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,357
What's wrong?

275
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:45,619
My darling, your feet
are like two icicles.

276
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,661
Have you been out of bed
or something?

277
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:48,977
No, of course not.

278
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:54,255
Anyway, you warm them on me.

279
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:13,238
This is Princess Dala.
My guests have gone,

280
00:31:13,335 --> 00:31:16,018
and I thought perhaps
you would come back and have a drink.

281
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:17,941
I would feel better
if we're friends.

282
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:20,210
I would, too,
and I'd love to come,

283
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,482
but my leg is rather painful.

284
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,917
I'm sorry. Another time.

285
00:31:25,014 --> 00:31:27,055
Why don't you come up here?

286
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:29,046
My leg is only bad
if I walk too much.

287
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:32,241
Maybe you could do the walking
and I could do the drinking.

288
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:39,248
Unless you think it would be indiscreet
to come to a man's room.

289
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,667
I'll be there in five minutes.
Good-bye, Sir Charles.

290
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,702
Good-bye.

291
00:32:14,775 --> 00:32:19,052
I don't know whatâ€™s wrong.
I'm just a bundle of nerves.

292
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:22,542
Donâ€™t worry. We've solved
that problem before.

293
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:24,109
- You don't mean...
- Of course.

294
00:32:24,215 --> 00:32:26,932
- I don't think you should.
- Donâ€™t worry, my darling.

295
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,380
- I shall do it ever so softly.
- Jacques, are you sure?

296
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:32,942
My darling, of course.
It's always worked before.

297
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:35,185
There's no reason
why it should not work now.

298
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,287
You just relax
and leave everything to me.

299
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:51,958
Jacques?

300
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:55,958
- Yes, my darling?
- I don't think it's such a good idea.

301
00:32:57,655 --> 00:32:59,477
You mean that it's not helping?

302
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:03,187
I'm afraid not.
I think Iâ€™ll just take a sleeping pill.

303
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,094
Very well, my darling.
I'll get it for you.

304
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:11,087
And why don't you take one yourself?
You need the rest, you know?

305
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,508
Yes, I think perhaps I will.

306
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:41,903
Here, my darling.

307
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,079
- Thank you, my angel.
- Thank you, my angel.

308
00:34:11,064 --> 00:34:12,787
My poor Jacques.

309
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:15,120
No matter.

310
00:34:15,224 --> 00:34:18,540
When you've seen one Stradivarius,
you've seen them all.

311
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,485
I hadn't realized it was so late.

312
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:33,617
Come in, sit down, relax.
Have a nice glass of champagne.

313
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,883
- I told you I don't drink.
- Champagne's not drinking.

314
00:34:36,984 --> 00:34:40,149
That's the minimum of alcohol
and the maximum of companionship.

315
00:34:40,248 --> 00:34:42,103
It's still against my principles.

316
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,469
That's too bad.
I thought it might break the ice.

317
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:47,219
- You took me to task rather properly.
- No, thank you.

318
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:49,841
I thought your analysis
was very perceptive.

319
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:52,791
- But not very polite.
- No, it wasnâ€™t.

320
00:34:52,888 --> 00:34:55,223
- What made you do it?
- I resented you.

321
00:34:55,321 --> 00:34:58,387
I find it hard to understand
a man of your reputation.

322
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:00,310
We both have reputations.

323
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:02,864
Perhaps mine is a little more
highly publicized than yours,

324
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:05,718
but you have presented the press
with a rather definite image.

325
00:35:05,816 --> 00:35:06,798
Yes, I know.

326
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,562
- Are you?
- What?

327
00:35:08,664 --> 00:35:11,153
What they call you.
The virgin queen.

328
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:13,427
I'm not the queen.

329
00:35:15,288 --> 00:35:16,662
That's only half an answer.

330
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,241
The strong-willed ruler of ten million
people sitting in her ivory tower,

331
00:35:20,344 --> 00:35:23,792
untouched, unwed,
and unapproachable.

332
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:28,344
If you had known my father,
you would understand me.

333
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:30,448
He was an absolute ruler.

334
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:32,592
He governed his people
with an iron hand,

335
00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:35,632
but he gave me a white pony
for my fifth birthday.

336
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:37,809
He was wrong about many things,

337
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:42,168
but he made his decisions according
to the ways of his predecessors.

338
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:46,127
I learned the way of the West,
so I've become a little of both...

339
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:47,639
a paradox...

340
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:50,867
and it is hard
to reconcile the extremes.

341
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:54,198
Have a glass of champagne.
Does wonders for extremes.

342
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:57,362
It's been known to launch
some lasting friendships.

343
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,437
- Don't you trust me?
- No.

344
00:36:05,145 --> 00:36:07,512
- Are you afraid?
- No.

345
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:10,487
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

346
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:23,759
I was three years old
when I rode my first elephant.

347
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:28,534
I was six when I went
on my first "safrari."

348
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:33,010
"Frasari."

349
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:35,185
Wild-animal hunt.

350
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:38,736
And I was ten
when I bagged my first tiger.

351
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:42,190
But I'll never forget
my lovely little pony.

352
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:43,987
When did you bag him?

353
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:49,647
You're making fun again.
You really don't like animals.

354
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:52,884
Don't trust a man
who doesn't care about animals.

355
00:36:54,617 --> 00:36:58,295
And don't trust an animal
who doesn't care about people.

356
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:02,966
Why you don't like people?

357
00:37:03,064 --> 00:37:04,691
I like people.

358
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:10,515
That's supposed to be me
who doesn't...

359
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:12,919
like people, right?

360
00:37:13,017 --> 00:37:14,773
If you say so.

361
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:19,377
I don't say so.
You say so.

362
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:21,172
- Right?
- I said so.

363
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:24,470
And another thing you did,
you didn't tell me the truth.

364
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:28,950
- About what?
- About champagne. About this.

365
00:37:31,194 --> 00:37:33,266
Boy, did you fib.

366
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:35,445
You said...

367
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:39,663
Something about extremes.

368
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:42,191
It does wonders for them.

369
00:37:42,297 --> 00:37:46,575
It does more than that.
It makes your lips numb.

370
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,390
I can't feel them.
Are they still there?

371
00:37:53,466 --> 00:37:55,320
Let's have a look.

372
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:00,753
You didn't tell me about that part.

373
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:11,766
Won't do you any good.
I can't feel it.

374
00:38:16,346 --> 00:38:19,160
Hoisted on your own petard.

375
00:38:20,793 --> 00:38:23,958
Don't try to say that
when you haven't got any lips.

376
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,570
I'm plastered.

377
00:38:32,986 --> 00:38:36,019
- If that's the right expression.
- That's the right expression.

378
00:38:36,122 --> 00:38:39,471
You're a fraud and a liar.

379
00:38:40,474 --> 00:38:43,124
And you think you are going
to take advantage of me.

380
00:38:43,226 --> 00:38:45,681
No. You think I am.

381
00:38:45,785 --> 00:38:49,364
I know you are.
That's the plan, isn't it?

382
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:53,231
Feed me champagne...

383
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:55,160
break down the inhibitions...

384
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:56,371
and tallyho.

385
00:39:02,617 --> 00:39:04,211
No more virgin queen.

386
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:08,659
We're all out of champagne.

387
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:10,704
- I'll get another bottle.
- No!

388
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:15,096
I prefer to remain conscious

389
00:39:15,194 --> 00:39:18,576
so I may view
the attempted seduction firsthand.

390
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,418
Because you've got
a surprise coming, Charlie.

391
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,749
I got friends in low places.

392
00:39:26,746 --> 00:39:30,063
You make one pass at me,
and I'll sic him on you.

393
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,697
Understand?

394
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,118
If he moves a muscle,
attack without mercy.

395
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,551
You see, Charlie?

396
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,708
You're outnumbered,
two against one.

397
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,567
And I don't care if you can juggle.

398
00:39:57,082 --> 00:39:59,449
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

399
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:02,357
Cat got your tongue?

400
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:07,575
Got his tongue?
My friend says he hasn't got it.

401
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:11,123
Then why don't you
say something?

402
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:13,015
I couldn't think
of anything to say.

403
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,887
Why don't you kiss me again?

404
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:21,106
All right.

405
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:32,082
You know what, Charlie?
I could feel that one.

406
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,153
Again.

407
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:49,394
If I were my father,
I'd have you tortured.

408
00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:52,565
No. If you were your father,

409
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,771
I doubt very much
if I would have kissed you.

410
00:40:56,795 --> 00:40:58,867
Good thinking, Charlie.

411
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,418
Then, now that weâ€™ve
straightened out who I am,

412
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:04,410
what are you
going to do about it?

413
00:41:15,483 --> 00:41:19,706
What kind of a friend are you?
You were supposed to attack.

414
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:25,361
No friends, Charlie.
Now you got me outnumbered.

415
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:26,743
I thought we were friends.

416
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:31,225
You are the juggler.
I am the virgin queen.

417
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,145
Somebody's got to win.

418
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:35,992
Friends don't act like that.

419
00:41:36,091 --> 00:41:40,215
Want to be friends, Charlie,
or want to win?

420
00:41:46,427 --> 00:41:47,889
You really want to know?

421
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,337
What's wrong?

422
00:42:05,115 --> 00:42:08,344
I don't feel...
I think I'm going...

423
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,621
Good-bye, Charlie.

424
00:42:14,107 --> 00:42:15,187
Here...

425
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:24,726
Darling. Dala.

426
00:42:26,395 --> 00:42:29,592
Ma'am? Your Highness!

427
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,050
Thank you. Up.

428
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:07,382
There we are.

429
00:44:10,972 --> 00:44:12,794
Hello, Uncle Charles.

430
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,187
George!

431
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:31,064
Good morning.
Listen, what about this nephew?

432
00:44:31,164 --> 00:44:33,303
- How did you find out?
- I met him in the bar last night.

433
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:35,608
That's what I was trying
to explain at the window.

434
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:36,756
What happened to you?

435
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,616
Jacques dragged me
back to the hotel.

436
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:41,171
- I looked everywhere for you.
- I looked everywhere for you.

437
00:44:41,276 --> 00:44:43,546
I nearly climbed in bed
with your nephew.

438
00:44:43,645 --> 00:44:45,750
- You what?
- Donâ€™t worry. I took care of it.

439
00:44:47,196 --> 00:44:48,406
He had a heavy night.

440
00:44:48,508 --> 00:44:50,298
I almost put the princess
in bed with him.

441
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,665
- Really?
- What you got there?

442
00:44:52,764 --> 00:44:54,455
A note to Uncle Charles.

443
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,842
"Dear Uncle Charles,
donâ€™t worry about a thing.

444
00:44:57,948 --> 00:45:01,298
I've gone to see the princess
to apologize for last night."

445
00:45:01,404 --> 00:45:03,259
Apologize for what?
Nothing happened.

446
00:45:03,357 --> 00:45:05,015
It must have been
rather embarrassing,

447
00:45:05,116 --> 00:45:06,906
expecting to end up
with one man...

448
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,826
She didn't expect
to wind up with anybody.

449
00:45:08,924 --> 00:45:11,957
She had a couple glasses
of champagne and had to rest.

450
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,140
Of course.

451
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:14,870
Think of him
taking over my room.

452
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:17,755
- Didn't you know he was coming?
- No. I haven't seen him for years.

453
00:45:17,853 --> 00:45:19,194
But who is he?
What is he?

454
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:20,786
He is my nephew, really.

455
00:45:20,893 --> 00:45:22,901
He's my late brother's son.

456
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:26,452
I've been responsible for him
since he was ten years old.

457
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:28,628
I sent him to all
the best schools in America.

458
00:45:28,732 --> 00:45:30,707
He did very well,
as a matter of fact.

459
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:33,201
He's just graduated
from college. Look.

460
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,163
Isn't he a bit old for school?

461
00:45:39,261 --> 00:45:40,690
He did two years in the army.

462
00:45:40,797 --> 00:45:44,474
He lost a whole year after that
to some strange tropical disease.

463
00:45:44,572 --> 00:45:46,297
He's certainly attractive.

464
00:45:46,397 --> 00:45:48,153
There's a slight
family resemblance.

465
00:45:48,253 --> 00:45:49,943
Apart from that,
we have nothing in common.

466
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:52,728
He's dedicated to education,
passed at the top of his class.

467
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:54,170
Cares nothing about sports.

468
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:56,952
In his letters, he's never
once mentioned girls.

469
00:45:57,053 --> 00:46:00,282
He may not mention them, but he's got
a pretty good idea what they are.

470
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:02,770
I nearly didn't
get out of here last night.

471
00:46:02,878 --> 00:46:04,154
You're joking.

472
00:46:04,253 --> 00:46:06,740
It was a relief to get back
to Jacques and his fiddle.

473
00:46:06,845 --> 00:46:09,146
If we don't do something soon,
he's gonna ruin everything.

474
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:12,245
- If I don't do something.
- It shouldn't be too difficult.

475
00:46:12,349 --> 00:46:14,804
He's just a young man
who's not been out in the world.

476
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:17,756
That's because he's been
spending his time in the bedroom.

477
00:46:17,852 --> 00:46:20,504
- I'm surprised at you.
- I can handle it.

478
00:46:20,605 --> 00:46:22,493
As a matter of fact,
it might be rather intriguing,

479
00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:26,484
particularly if the family resemblance
goes deeper than you think.

480
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:27,963
I'm envious.

481
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:30,876
It seems that weâ€™re somewhat
in the same spot, my love.

482
00:46:30,973 --> 00:46:33,362
You envy George,
and I envy the princess.

483
00:46:36,605 --> 00:46:38,744
I really don't know
what I'm going to do yet.

484
00:46:38,845 --> 00:46:42,009
I might go back to college
and get my doctorate.

485
00:46:42,108 --> 00:46:43,931
But I'm torn.

486
00:46:44,029 --> 00:46:46,331
I feel there's so many things
to be done in the world,

487
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:49,047
so many backward countries
where I might be useful.

488
00:46:49,149 --> 00:46:51,605
I've even been considering
the Peace Corps.

489
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:54,011
You're certainly not
much like your uncle.

490
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,932
I don't know
too much about my uncle,

491
00:46:56,029 --> 00:46:58,418
except what I've read
in newspapers and magazines.

492
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,078
- One mustn't judge by that.
- No?

493
00:47:01,182 --> 00:47:04,149
After all, whatever I am today,
he made it possible.

494
00:47:04,253 --> 00:47:07,036
I guess everyone has
at least one redeeming quality.

495
00:47:07,134 --> 00:47:08,246
Yes.

496
00:47:15,262 --> 00:47:17,400
Good morning, Your Highness.
Hair of the dog.

497
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:20,088
- May I present Madame Clouseau?
- Good morning.

498
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,978
This is my
Americanized nephew George.

499
00:47:22,077 --> 00:47:23,452
We met at the bar last night.

500
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,721
- How is your cough?
- It's completely gone. Thanks.

501
00:47:25,821 --> 00:47:27,130
Have a glass of this.

502
00:47:27,229 --> 00:47:29,433
It'll put everything
in its right perspective.

503
00:47:29,534 --> 00:47:31,323
My perspective
is excellent this morning.

504
00:47:31,422 --> 00:47:33,593
I see your leg is much better.

505
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,147
It's a vast improvement.
Very much better.

506
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:38,359
George and I had a wonderful
family reunion last night

507
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:39,869
after we carried you home.

508
00:47:39,966 --> 00:47:41,656
- He's quite a lad.
- So I've discovered.

509
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,481
He's thinking of joining
the Peace Corps.

510
00:47:43,582 --> 00:47:45,240
Imagine a Litton
in the Peace Corps.

511
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:47,644
Be careful, or youâ€™ll give
your family a good name.

512
00:47:47,742 --> 00:47:49,564
- Please sit down.
- No, thank you.

513
00:47:49,662 --> 00:47:51,833
I was on my way to ski
when I ran into Sir Charles.

514
00:47:51,933 --> 00:47:55,000
- Do you ski, Mr. Litton?
- Ski?

515
00:47:55,103 --> 00:47:57,655
- No, not very well.
- You should learn, George.

516
00:47:57,758 --> 00:48:00,124
If it wasnâ€™t for this ropy leg,
I'd take you myself.

517
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:01,683
I'm hardly in your uncle's class,

518
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:04,375
but I'd be happy to give you
the benefit of my experience.

519
00:48:04,478 --> 00:48:06,387
I'm sure Madame
is an excellent teacher.

520
00:48:06,494 --> 00:48:08,501
Certainly she could
get you started out right.

521
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:10,460
If it wouldnâ€™t be
too much trouble, yeah.

522
00:48:10,558 --> 00:48:12,381
Not at all.
It would be a pleasure.

523
00:48:12,478 --> 00:48:14,202
Perhaps you'd like
to come along now.

524
00:48:15,677 --> 00:48:17,750
George, you can't pass up
an invitation like that.

525
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,374
I haven't got the proper clothes,
and I don't have any skis.

526
00:48:20,478 --> 00:48:23,227
The shop will fix you up.
Just charge everything to me.

527
00:48:23,326 --> 00:48:26,424
Thanks. Your Highness,
hope to see you again.

528
00:48:26,526 --> 00:48:30,203
If you're back early.
I'm leaving on the afternoon train.

529
00:48:30,302 --> 00:48:31,960
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

530
00:48:32,062 --> 00:48:33,588
- Thanks, Uncle Charles.
- Have fun.

531
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,059
Mind the instructor.
She knows what she's doing.

532
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:40,093
I'm sure she does.

533
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,164
- You're not staying?
- No. We're off to the slopes.

534
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,539
I'll get the door.
So long, Uncle Charles.

535
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:45,980
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

536
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,747
Just in time. Thank you.
You sure you won't join me?

537
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:51,774
Quite sure.

538
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:57,659
Do you have to
leave this afternoon?

539
00:48:57,757 --> 00:48:59,001
Yes.

540
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,012
Isn't this departure
rather sudden?

541
00:49:01,118 --> 00:49:03,257
Not at all.
Why do you think so?

542
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:05,692
I just thought that
after last night...

543
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:08,409
My leaving has nothing
to do with last night.

544
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:11,293
- Hasn't it?
- You don't know me very well.

545
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,692
No, but I thought last night,
I was making some progress.

546
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:16,179
That was champagne,
nothing more.

547
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,134
Whatever it was,
it was very interesting.

548
00:49:19,231 --> 00:49:22,678
- I really don't remember.
- That's an awful old clichÃ©.

549
00:49:22,782 --> 00:49:24,822
- It's true.
- The majority of women,

550
00:49:24,927 --> 00:49:27,774
they have half a glass too much
and let down the barriers a little,

551
00:49:27,871 --> 00:49:29,780
and they wake up in the morning
riddled with guilt

552
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:33,367
and think they can reclaim their virtue
by saying, "I don't remember."

553
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,543
Are you saying my virtue
is not intact?

554
00:49:35,647 --> 00:49:37,686
- You know it is.
- Then why should I feel guilty?

555
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,929
You're not concerned
about what happened.

556
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:42,169
You're worried about
what might have happened.

557
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:45,053
That makes you vulnerable.
That makes you a woman.

558
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:46,973
You're an arrogant fool.

559
00:49:48,383 --> 00:49:50,750
Perhaps I am,
but after what I just said,

560
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,635
a real woman
would have slapped my face.

561
00:50:03,518 --> 00:50:05,820
I'm glad that's over.
Friends again?

562
00:50:05,918 --> 00:50:07,478
Friends.

563
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:10,878
Good. Now the least you can do
is let me take you to the station.

564
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,829
- All right.
- You really have to go?

565
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,814
- Yes, I must go.
- That's too bad.

566
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,628
- Nothing I can say to make you stay?
- Nothing.

567
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,766
- What time do you have to be there?
- 3:00.

568
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:23,034
3:00 on the dot,
I'll be here, Your Highness.

569
00:50:26,462 --> 00:50:27,804
3:00.

570
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:39,515
Do we have to start
the lessons right away?

571
00:50:39,615 --> 00:50:41,720
That's what weâ€™re up here for,
is it not?

572
00:50:41,823 --> 00:50:45,140
I was hoping we could talk
about last night.

573
00:50:45,247 --> 00:50:48,629
- We can talk about that later.
- You were more fun in bed.

574
00:50:48,735 --> 00:50:50,557
Would you do me a favor,
Mr. Litton?

575
00:50:50,654 --> 00:50:52,084
Sure, if you call me George.

576
00:50:52,192 --> 00:50:54,973
Forget about last night.
I was impetuous.

577
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:57,689
I had too much to drink
and I'd just had a fight with my husband.

578
00:50:57,791 --> 00:50:59,165
It might be easier
for you to forget,

579
00:50:59,263 --> 00:51:01,336
but I didn't sleep a wink
after you left.

580
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,578
It was a very frustrating experience.

581
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:06,264
I'm afraid that's your problem,
but I wouldn't make any plans.

582
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,741
I never make any plans.

583
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:11,101
I just sort of follow my instincts.

584
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:14,068
George, it's four miles
down the mountain,

585
00:51:14,175 --> 00:51:15,419
and I'm a very good skier.

586
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,342
You follow your instincts
too closely,

587
00:51:17,439 --> 00:51:19,479
and you're liable
to break your neck.

588
00:51:19,584 --> 00:51:22,845
The first things to learn about
skiing are the fundamentals.

589
00:51:22,943 --> 00:51:24,350
Let's see you turn around.

590
00:51:27,616 --> 00:51:30,932
It's not as easy as it looks.
Let me give you a hand.

591
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,673
Let's try something easier.
It's a lot easier, honest.

592
00:51:35,775 --> 00:51:37,750
You were going
to watch those instincts.

593
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,284
I'm busy. You watch them.

594
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,505
You're abominable.

595
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:43,127
Yeah, that's me,
the Abominable Snowman.

596
00:51:43,232 --> 00:51:44,758
George, stop it!

597
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,574
Imbecile!

598
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:08,950
Perhaps we'll meet again.

599
00:52:09,055 --> 00:52:11,422
- Good-bye, Sir Charles.
- Just a minute.

600
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,357
- That's him. There he goes.
- Who?

601
00:52:15,456 --> 00:52:17,822
The man who stole your dog,
in that little car.

602
00:53:06,688 --> 00:53:08,510
- How's it going?
- Fine. I'm going to miss her.

603
00:53:08,608 --> 00:53:11,096
Let that be a lesson.
Never get involved with your victims.

604
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,916
- Shall we get out in the open?
- No. It's a bit hard here.

605
00:53:16,288 --> 00:53:20,314
That's good. That's okay.
Right, start. Give it to me now.

606
00:53:28,128 --> 00:53:30,266
- How close are they?
- Now.

607
00:53:30,368 --> 00:53:31,578
- Sorry. Ready?
- Right.

608
00:53:34,752 --> 00:53:37,654
Come along, little doggy.
Here we are.

609
00:53:41,632 --> 00:53:42,810
Look out!

610
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,771
She's got the dog.
I will see you later.

611
00:57:19,714 --> 00:57:21,208
You have a wonderful smile.

612
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,702
I have a great deal
to smile about.

613
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:26,493
I have Amber back,
and I'm having a wonderful time.

614
00:57:26,594 --> 00:57:27,543
You missed your train.

615
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,039
There's one at midnight
and one in the morning.

616
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,567
Perhaps I should have
your dog kidnapped again.

617
00:57:32,674 --> 00:57:34,813
Then you'd be bound to stay.

618
00:57:34,914 --> 00:57:37,335
Did you arrange to have her
kidnapped the first time?

619
00:57:38,337 --> 00:57:39,319
Of course.

620
00:57:45,698 --> 00:57:47,672
I am willing
to bet you 10,000 francs

621
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:50,812
that the Phantom is in Cortina
at this very moment,

622
00:57:50,915 --> 00:57:52,856
even perhaps in this very room.

623
00:57:52,962 --> 00:57:55,580
How exciting.
What do you think, Mr. Tucker?

624
00:57:55,682 --> 00:57:56,925
I agree with the inspector.

625
00:57:57,026 --> 00:58:00,223
Ten of his last fifteen victims have been
guests at Angela Dunning's parties.

626
00:58:00,322 --> 00:58:01,816
What are you all talking about?

627
00:58:03,106 --> 00:58:05,855
- The notorious Phantom.
- I've never heard of him.

628
00:58:05,954 --> 00:58:08,988
What little I've read about him,
he seems to be quite a fellow.

629
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:12,123
There are few thieves who are
as clever as the Phantom.

630
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:14,845
Each theft is completely
different and unique,

631
00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:16,921
classic in its conception.

632
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:20,157
I thought you were working on
the theory that he does repeat himself.

633
00:58:20,258 --> 00:58:22,844
Only as far as Angela Dunning's
parties are concerned.

634
00:58:22,947 --> 00:58:25,183
However, there is
one other duplication,

635
00:58:25,282 --> 00:58:29,853
but that is his trademark,
his calling card, so to speak.

636
00:58:30,563 --> 00:58:33,410
He always leaves
a white monogrammed glove.

637
00:58:33,507 --> 00:58:35,067
Sounds terribly theatrical.

638
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:38,684
If I were the Phantom,
I'd have chosen my victim already.

639
00:58:38,787 --> 00:58:40,925
Really? And who would that be?

640
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:44,541
Who has the most
fabulous diamond in the world?

641
00:58:44,642 --> 00:58:47,457
- I suppose I do.
- Exactly. The Pink Panther.

642
00:58:47,555 --> 00:58:50,206
A prize he could never resist.
He would be bound to try for it.

643
00:58:50,306 --> 00:58:51,484
He'd be disappointed.

644
00:58:51,586 --> 00:58:53,691
The Pink Panther
is in my safe at...

645
00:58:53,794 --> 00:58:56,347
Your Highness, please.
Don't say it, not here.

646
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,010
If I'm not being too nosy,
Your Highness,

647
00:58:58,115 --> 00:59:00,002
I read somewhere
there was some dispute

648
00:59:00,098 --> 00:59:01,658
over the ownership
of the Pink Panther.

649
00:59:01,762 --> 00:59:05,079
It belongs to me.
It was a gift from my late father.

650
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:07,358
- I shall never surrender it.
- Why should you?

651
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:09,695
When the present government
seized power,

652
00:59:09,794 --> 00:59:12,445
they claimed the diamond
was the property of the people.

653
00:59:12,547 --> 00:59:14,968
There's even talk
of the International Court

654
00:59:15,074 --> 00:59:16,122
deciding the issue.

655
00:59:16,226 --> 00:59:19,609
Why don't I steal the diamond
and leave that old glove behind?

656
00:59:19,715 --> 00:59:21,405
You and I
could split the insurance.

657
00:59:21,507 --> 00:59:23,132
All right.

658
00:59:23,234 --> 00:59:24,281
I feel like dancing.

659
00:59:24,387 --> 00:59:26,623
- Your Highness?
- I'd love to.

660
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,484
- How about you, Madame?
- Yes, of course.

661
00:59:32,354 --> 00:59:35,257
- Your leg is better, Sir Charles.
- What?

662
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,908
- I say, your leg is better.
- Yes, much better. Thank you.

663
00:59:40,418 --> 00:59:41,912
You know, Mr. Tucker...

664
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:48,000
- It's my beer, old man.
- My hand. It burnt...

665
00:59:48,098 --> 00:59:49,026
I'm sorry.

666
00:59:52,835 --> 00:59:53,763
Sit down.

667
00:59:58,018 --> 01:00:00,539
Seems to be working out
better than we expected.

668
01:00:00,643 --> 01:00:02,715
The only thing we've found out
is that it's not here.

669
01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:05,753
You shouldn't have any trouble
discovering exactly where it is.

670
01:00:05,859 --> 01:00:08,925
Her Highness seems
to be completely captivated.

671
01:00:09,027 --> 01:00:11,231
I'd say that's
a considerable exaggeration.

672
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,217
You're either showing
a touch of senility,

673
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:14,776
Or you need glasses, my love.

674
01:00:14,882 --> 01:00:16,705
When I'm showing
my senility, darling,

675
01:00:16,803 --> 01:00:19,039
you'll be occupying your time
with your grandchildren.

676
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:21,856
One has to have children
before one has grandchildren.

677
01:00:21,954 --> 01:00:23,613
You wouldn't dare.

678
01:00:23,715 --> 01:00:25,657
Jacques would make
a wonderful father.

679
01:00:25,763 --> 01:00:28,348
- He has many redeeming qualities.
- Name one.

680
01:00:28,451 --> 01:00:31,234
He's kind, loyal,
faithful, obedient.

681
01:00:31,332 --> 01:00:34,114
You're either married
to a Boy Scout or a Dachshund.

682
01:00:34,211 --> 01:00:35,356
And he adores me.

683
01:00:35,459 --> 01:00:37,630
That eliminates the Boy Scouts.

684
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,118
- Good night.
- Thank you.

685
01:00:49,027 --> 01:00:50,434
You seem to have
lost something.

686
01:00:51,555 --> 01:00:54,337
- How'd you like to borrow mine?
- Thanks, Uncle Charles, yes.

687
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:55,613
Madame.

688
01:01:03,234 --> 01:01:05,821
- You've been avoiding me.
- That about describes it.

689
01:01:05,923 --> 01:01:07,330
You know what
I've been thinking?

690
01:01:07,427 --> 01:01:09,696
Yes. That's why
I've been avoiding you.

691
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:12,184
I don't think you were really
looking for me that night

692
01:01:12,292 --> 01:01:13,535
in my uncle's bedroom.

693
01:01:13,635 --> 01:01:15,490
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No, I mean it.

694
01:01:15,587 --> 01:01:17,497
Not the way
you treated me today.

695
01:01:17,603 --> 01:01:19,490
- You know what I think?
- What?

696
01:01:23,107 --> 01:01:25,311
What do you think, George?

697
01:01:25,411 --> 01:01:27,800
I think maybe I was wrong.

698
01:01:32,547 --> 01:01:33,889
I'm sorry I have to leave,

699
01:01:33,987 --> 01:01:36,509
but I must make
a very important phone call.

700
01:01:36,612 --> 01:01:39,361
- Can't it wait?
- I'm afraid not.

701
01:01:39,459 --> 01:01:40,441
Good night.

702
01:01:54,276 --> 01:01:55,258
That's better.

703
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,878
Just a quick shower, my love,
and I will be right with you.

704
01:02:26,436 --> 01:02:27,614
One moment, please.

705
01:02:34,276 --> 01:02:35,552
Inspector Clouseau.

706
01:02:35,652 --> 01:02:38,499
Inspector Clouseau,
this is the prefect of police.

707
01:02:38,596 --> 01:02:40,506
I have information
regarding the Phantom.

708
01:02:40,612 --> 01:02:43,132
- The Phantom?
- Yes. You must come at once.

709
01:02:43,236 --> 01:02:44,163
I'm in Brunico.

710
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,609
Brunico? But that's in Brunico.
That's 30 miles from here.

711
01:02:47,715 --> 01:02:49,887
It is here that I have
discovered the information.

712
01:02:49,988 --> 01:02:51,035
Come immediately.

713
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,028
I cannot say more.
I am being watched.

714
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:56,860
Yes. I understand, yes.

715
01:02:59,077 --> 01:03:02,043
I'm sorry, my darling.
Important police business.

716
01:03:02,148 --> 01:03:04,254
I will be back with you
as soon as possible.

717
01:03:04,356 --> 01:03:05,850
I understand, my love.

718
01:03:06,948 --> 01:03:08,410
- My darling.
- Yes?

719
01:03:09,444 --> 01:03:13,219
I am a husband that must be
envied by all other husbands.

720
01:03:13,317 --> 01:03:15,935
I'm sure no one
ever had a husband like you.

721
01:03:16,036 --> 01:03:16,964
My darling.

722
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,424
My darling, don't move.
Don't panic.

723
01:03:23,525 --> 01:03:25,532
All that has happened
is that my hat has caught

724
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:28,953
in one of your naughty
little hairpins.

725
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,108
<i>VoilÃ .</i>

726
01:03:36,196 --> 01:03:41,728
You know, at times like this
I wish I was but a simple peasant.

727
01:03:41,828 --> 01:03:45,822
It's times like this that make me
realize how lucky I really am.

728
01:04:15,908 --> 01:04:18,843
He's gone to Brunico.
Another call about the Phantom.

729
01:04:20,836 --> 01:04:22,975
There's something going on.

730
01:04:23,076 --> 01:04:25,946
I don't quite know what it is,
but there's something wrong.

731
01:04:26,053 --> 01:04:27,711
Do you want to call it off?

732
01:04:27,812 --> 01:04:29,339
I don't know.
I'm considering it.

733
01:04:29,444 --> 01:04:31,005
Have you considered
something else?

734
01:04:31,108 --> 01:04:32,155
What's that?

735
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,562
The possibility that
you're growing a conscience.

736
01:04:34,661 --> 01:04:37,214
- A conscience? About what?
- The princess.

737
01:04:38,149 --> 01:04:41,084
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, I'm just being a woman.

738
01:04:41,189 --> 01:04:44,353
This time you've chosen
a fascinating victim.

739
01:04:44,453 --> 01:04:46,307
I suspect you've broken
the first rule

740
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:48,379
and allowed yourself
to become involved.

741
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:50,590
You're being a woman, all right.

742
01:04:50,693 --> 01:04:53,856
That's obvious. Competition
always makes a woman obvious.

743
01:04:56,068 --> 01:04:57,792
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

744
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:01,925
Wait a minute.

745
01:05:05,093 --> 01:05:06,980
- What is it?
- Flowers.

746
01:05:17,509 --> 01:05:19,265
- George!
- Trick or treat.

747
01:05:19,365 --> 01:05:22,464
- Wait a minute.
- I found these growing in the hall.

748
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,431
You get right out of here.

749
01:05:26,533 --> 01:05:28,769
What kind of hospitality is that?

750
01:05:28,869 --> 01:05:30,724
But my husband
could be back any minute.

751
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:33,919
He must be about
halfway to Brunico by now.

752
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:36,126
"You must come to Brunico
immediately, Inspector.

753
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:38,684
"I have information
regarding the Phantom.

754
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:41,986
While you're in Brunico,
waiting for the prefect of police..."

755
01:05:42,085 --> 01:05:43,491
Thank you very much.

756
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:45,761
"I shall be investigating your wife."

757
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:51,616
One never knows, huh?

758
01:05:51,717 --> 01:05:54,085
Perhaps the Phantom
is hiding under the bed.

759
01:05:55,429 --> 01:05:56,705
That's more like it.

760
01:05:56,805 --> 01:05:59,325
- You should be ashamed.
- I'm planning on it.

761
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:01,437
Suppose Jacques
doesn't go to Brunico?

762
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,451
Suppose he finds out
the prefect never called?

763
01:06:03,557 --> 01:06:04,767
You must get out of here.

764
01:06:04,869 --> 01:06:07,324
You are the damnedest woman.
Are you a sexual yo-yo?

765
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:09,405
You jump in my bed,
you push me off a mountain,

766
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:11,201
then you practically seduce me
on the dance floor.

767
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,432
You're terribly attractive,
and I'm naturally...

768
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:16,355
- But not here.
- Where?

769
01:06:16,453 --> 01:06:18,112
I don't know, but not tonight.

770
01:06:18,213 --> 01:06:20,450
You know what your trouble is?
You can't make up your mind.

771
01:06:20,549 --> 01:06:22,437
- I am married.
- Where's your husband?

772
01:06:22,533 --> 01:06:24,355
Out in 12 feet of snow,
chasing the Phantom.

773
01:06:24,453 --> 01:06:25,948
- That was your idea.
- Sure it was.

774
01:06:26,054 --> 01:06:28,639
If he was any kind of a man,
he wouldn't have gone.

775
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:31,492
- Darling.
- "Darling"?

776
01:06:35,014 --> 01:06:36,355
It's locked.

777
01:06:41,702 --> 01:06:45,247
There you are.
Halfway to Brunico, huh?

778
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:46,429
Angel?

779
01:06:51,494 --> 01:06:53,828
- What do I do?
- Answer the door.

780
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:56,801
- Simone?
- Yes, dear?

781
01:06:59,206 --> 01:07:02,501
- But I thought you were on...
- That phone call was a ruse.

782
01:07:04,741 --> 01:07:06,302
Are you hurt, my darling?

783
01:07:08,742 --> 01:07:10,564
I don't recall that being there.

784
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:13,476
No, it was sent a while ago.
I thought it was from you.

785
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:15,167
No, it certainly was not from me.

786
01:07:17,254 --> 01:07:19,141
Some very strange things
going on here.

787
01:07:21,221 --> 01:07:23,109
I passed the prefect on the road.

788
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:27,325
- He never made that call.
- No?

789
01:07:29,862 --> 01:07:31,749
There was no card with these?

790
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:37,250
Why should anybody want me
to go to Brunico?

791
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:40,768
My darling.

792
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:43,390
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to kiss your foot.

793
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:45,435
- Let me kiss your face.
- It's all right.

794
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:47,550
Darling, I'm sorry.
Come here.

795
01:07:47,654 --> 01:07:50,785
That's nice and comfy.
You belong in bed there.

796
01:07:51,941 --> 01:07:53,982
- My darling.
- Listen, dear.

797
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:57,185
Why donâ€™t we go down to the bar
and have a nightcap?

798
01:07:57,286 --> 01:08:01,693
Darling, listen,
why don't I have a nice bath?

799
01:08:01,798 --> 01:08:04,645
And afterwards,
we have our lovely, warm bed.

800
01:08:04,742 --> 01:08:07,230
Donâ€™t worry about this mess.
We can have it cleaned up later.

801
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:09,123
We donâ€™t want
any more interruptions.

802
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:11,011
Would you mind if I bathed first?

803
01:08:12,102 --> 01:08:14,371
Did you not bathe earlier?

804
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:18,464
Yes, but it would warm me up,
help me to relax.

805
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:22,405
I'll tell you what weâ€™ll do.

806
01:08:22,502 --> 01:08:24,411
Like we did in the old days,
when you're in there,

807
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:26,341
I will come in
and scrub your back for you.

808
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:28,828
You're so romantic,
but I'll only be a moment.

809
01:09:44,006 --> 01:09:45,697
- Darling?
- Yes?

810
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:51,483
- Hello, my darling.
- Hello, my darling.

811
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:54,940
- Why did you draw the curtains?
- Just to keep me warm.

812
01:09:55,047 --> 01:09:58,146
Warm? Warm is one thing.
It must be hell in there.

813
01:09:58,246 --> 01:10:00,417
No, it's wonderful.

814
01:10:00,519 --> 01:10:02,406
Why don't you let me
wash your back for you?

815
01:10:02,503 --> 01:10:03,932
It's already done, my darling.

816
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:06,690
As I told you before,
I just want to relax.

817
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:08,798
We must have no secrets
from one another, my darling.

818
01:10:08,903 --> 01:10:10,048
I know, my darling.

819
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:17,286
I will brush my teeth
and keep you company.

820
01:10:17,383 --> 01:10:19,293
That's sweet of you, my darling.

821
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:39,459
I thought you would like to know
Princess Dala just checked out.

822
01:10:39,559 --> 01:10:40,836
Thank you very much.

823
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,203
Darling, you got rid of all
those naughty little bubbles?

824
01:10:47,304 --> 01:10:49,605
- I beg your pardon?
- You got rid of the little bubbles?

825
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:50,651
Yes, I did.

826
01:10:55,911 --> 01:10:57,405
Hey, come...

827
01:10:58,343 --> 01:10:59,685
Come out quick.

828
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,825
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

829
01:11:09,928 --> 01:11:10,910
One minute.

830
01:11:14,407 --> 01:11:16,447
- Inspector's violin, ma'am.
- Thank you.

831
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:19,552
- Madame, the flowers.
- It's nothing. It doesn't matter.

832
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:21,793
If they found out downstairs,
I'd lose my job.

833
01:11:21,895 --> 01:11:24,165
- Do it in the morning.
- I'll ring for the maid.

834
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:36,933
- Darling?
- Yes, dear?

835
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:38,492
How would you like to
wash my back?

836
01:11:38,599 --> 01:11:40,454
I'd love to, but you see...

837
01:11:40,552 --> 01:11:43,399
I have to... I mean...
I'm cold.

838
01:11:50,184 --> 01:11:51,361
Get the broom.

839
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,397
Come on. Hurry up. Go.

840
01:12:12,616 --> 01:12:15,234
Shan't be a moment, my darling.
Iâ€™ll just put on my pajamas.

841
01:12:15,336 --> 01:12:18,532
Darling, look. I think I've got
something in my right eye.

842
01:12:18,631 --> 01:12:20,737
- Let me put you in the...
- My left one. No, this one.

843
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,523
- If you'd come in the light...
- It hurts!

844
01:12:23,624 --> 01:12:27,071
- Stand still. I can't see it.
- It hurts. I cannot open it.

845
01:12:27,175 --> 01:12:28,551
Stand in the light a moment.

846
01:12:28,648 --> 01:12:30,536
- Where?
- Here.

847
01:12:30,632 --> 01:12:32,771
There's absolutely nothing
in your eye.

848
01:12:32,872 --> 01:12:34,148
Nothing? Are you sure?

849
01:12:34,248 --> 01:12:36,256
Only your eye.
That is all that is there.

850
01:12:46,536 --> 01:12:48,740
- What are you doing?
- It broke off.

851
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,360
Put it back. We have no time.
He's coming back.

852
01:12:51,464 --> 01:12:53,253
Get under the bed.
Come on. Quick.

853
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,287
Come on.

854
01:13:00,104 --> 01:13:01,566
Why aren't you in bed,
my darling?

855
01:13:01,672 --> 01:13:05,316
I was... I mean...

856
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:07,522
I mean, I'm just going to.

857
01:13:10,568 --> 01:13:11,517
I'm cold.

858
01:13:12,712 --> 01:13:16,510
- My Stradivarius.
- The porter just brought it in.

859
01:13:16,616 --> 01:13:20,194
I sent it to the village
to be repaired.

860
01:13:20,297 --> 01:13:22,085
I hope they know how
to fix plastic.

861
01:13:22,184 --> 01:13:23,132
I hope so, too.

862
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:25,983
So far, so good.

863
01:13:27,465 --> 01:13:28,392
We shall see.

864
01:13:33,896 --> 01:13:34,911
Better than ever.

865
01:13:36,424 --> 01:13:38,977
Dear, I doubt if we shall
need it tonight, my love.

866
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,153
I'm sure we won't, darling.

867
01:13:58,089 --> 01:13:59,136
What is it?

868
01:14:00,648 --> 01:14:01,892
It's very strange.

869
01:14:15,273 --> 01:14:16,702
Why don't you come to bed?

870
01:14:18,184 --> 01:14:20,258
You know,
I don't understand this.

871
01:14:21,801 --> 01:14:23,142
You see...

872
01:14:24,328 --> 01:14:26,783
These footprints...

873
01:14:28,073 --> 01:14:31,750
They were made by shoes...

874
01:14:32,808 --> 01:14:36,802
...and they were not
made by feet.

875
01:14:42,632 --> 01:14:45,055
Iâ€™ll just get up
and turn off the lights.

876
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:51,904
At last. At last.

877
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:54,504
Darling, my little...

878
01:14:57,737 --> 01:15:00,071
Darling, what's the matter,
my darling?

879
01:15:00,169 --> 01:15:03,966
It's very strange, my love,
but suddenly I'm freezing cold.

880
01:15:04,073 --> 01:15:07,389
- You're freezing cold?
- The window is open.

881
01:15:07,497 --> 01:15:08,545
The window's open.

882
01:15:08,649 --> 01:15:11,551
Sometimes it's healthy
to have fresh air.

883
01:15:11,657 --> 01:15:15,269
Healthy is one thing,
but it's hell in here, my love.

884
01:15:16,168 --> 01:15:18,373
Ten below zero outside,
my darling.

885
01:15:22,728 --> 01:15:23,939
That's better.

886
01:15:31,465 --> 01:15:33,288
- There, my darling.
- Yes.

887
01:15:37,257 --> 01:15:38,599
At last!

888
01:16:01,545 --> 01:16:03,400
- Yes?
- I just arrived in town.

889
01:16:03,497 --> 01:16:04,927
No trouble with the police yet.

890
01:16:05,034 --> 01:16:08,350
The princess is expecting
important visitors here tomorrow.

891
01:16:08,457 --> 01:16:11,042
- She say anything about leaving?
- Who is this?

892
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:26,718
- Yes?
- Princess Dala, please.

893
01:16:26,825 --> 01:16:29,063
Her Highness checked out
a short while ago.

894
01:17:40,009 --> 01:17:41,766
Uncle Charles.

895
01:18:17,195 --> 01:18:18,788
What did you say?

896
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,712
I said he could come
as one of the Borgias.

897
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:22,666
Then he wouldn't have
to explain his cousin.

898
01:18:22,762 --> 01:18:23,810
What's a Borgia?

899
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:28,479
Good evening.

900
01:18:37,355 --> 01:18:39,210
I mean...

901
01:18:39,307 --> 01:18:42,568
I enjoy champagne in bed
as much as the next man,

902
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:46,561
but from now on, perhaps
a more practical approach?

903
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:50,856
I'm sorry, my darling.
I wanted to surprise you.

904
01:18:50,954 --> 01:18:54,697
- It's been a night of surprises.
- You can say that again.

905
01:18:54,795 --> 01:18:56,136
It's been...

906
01:18:58,123 --> 01:19:00,195
Anyway...

907
01:19:00,298 --> 01:19:02,022
- My love?
- Yes?

908
01:19:04,555 --> 01:19:06,409
Shall I say you're not here?

909
01:19:07,626 --> 01:19:09,798
No, it's all right, darling.
I'll answer it.

910
01:19:18,699 --> 01:19:21,416
- Yes!
- Tucker here, Inspector.

911
01:19:21,515 --> 01:19:24,614
The man who kidnapped
the dog was driving a rented car.

912
01:19:24,714 --> 01:19:27,203
He's been identified
as a man named Artoff.

913
01:19:27,307 --> 01:19:30,307
London informs us
that a man of his description

914
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:32,996
is at present employed
by Sir Charles Litton.

915
01:19:33,098 --> 01:19:35,238
I see. Come up immediately.

916
01:19:35,339 --> 01:19:36,452
Sir Charles!

917
01:19:36,555 --> 01:19:39,489
He's the Phantom!
I've really got him this time.

918
01:19:53,387 --> 01:19:55,721
Sir Charles?
Open that door.

919
01:19:56,395 --> 01:19:57,824
I know youâ€™re in there.

920
01:19:57,932 --> 01:19:59,720
Open up. This is the police.

921
01:20:00,876 --> 01:20:03,461
- Stand back while I fire.
- No, don't do that, old man.

922
01:20:17,196 --> 01:20:19,105
- Jacques knows.
- And somebody else.

923
01:20:19,211 --> 01:20:22,147
George has got
my do-it-yourself Phantom kit.

924
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:23,811
I've got to get out of here.

925
01:20:24,843 --> 01:20:28,258
- His clothes are still here.
- Perhaps he's already escaped.

926
01:20:28,363 --> 01:20:30,819
Most unlikely. He doesn't realize
that I am onto him.

927
01:20:30,924 --> 01:20:32,418
Listen, old man.

928
01:20:32,523 --> 01:20:36,036
We've no proof that Artoff was
the man driving the Innocente.

929
01:20:36,139 --> 01:20:39,042
Sir Charles is our man.
My every instinct tells me so.

930
01:20:39,148 --> 01:20:41,122
Careful, you fool.
You realize this gun is loaded?

931
01:20:41,228 --> 01:20:44,391
What I must do now is get dressed
and search the rest of the hotel.

932
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:53,922
- Did you find him?
- No, but he can't be far.

933
01:20:54,027 --> 01:20:55,916
I must dress quickly and get...

934
01:21:00,203 --> 01:21:01,632
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

935
01:21:01,739 --> 01:21:03,016
My coat!

936
01:21:03,116 --> 01:21:05,701
My SÃ»retÃ©-Scotland-Yard-type
Macintosh! It's gone!

937
01:21:05,804 --> 01:21:07,811
Good evening, Inspector.

938
01:21:44,396 --> 01:21:47,014
- What is it, Saloud?
- Inspector Clouseau.

939
01:21:50,347 --> 01:21:52,617
Your Highness,
please excuse this interruption.

940
01:21:52,716 --> 01:21:54,571
I have news
of great importance.

941
01:21:54,667 --> 01:21:56,904
This is Mr. Tucker
of Lloyd's of London.

942
01:21:57,003 --> 01:21:58,892
And we have met before.

943
01:21:58,988 --> 01:22:01,257
I've met her, too, you know.

944
01:22:01,356 --> 01:22:03,560
Yes, I know, but we are
meeting her again now.

945
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:05,481
What is this news?

946
01:22:05,579 --> 01:22:08,678
I have discovered
the identity of the Phantom.

947
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,689
- You don't say.
- I do say.

948
01:22:10,796 --> 01:22:12,618
- Of course, we're not positive.
- I am positive.

949
01:22:12,716 --> 01:22:14,604
He is, I believe, at this
very moment here in Rome.

950
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:16,555
- Really?
- Yes.

951
01:22:16,652 --> 01:22:18,921
Have you seen or heard
from Sir Charles Litton?

952
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,474
Not since I left Cortina. Why?

953
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:24,101
Sir Charles and the Phantom
are one and the same.

954
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:27,139
- You're not serious.
- I am serious.

955
01:22:27,244 --> 01:22:29,132
I can understand
how difficult it is

956
01:22:29,227 --> 01:22:31,203
for Your Highness
to accept the facts.

957
01:22:31,308 --> 01:22:34,439
Sir Charles is a very persuasive
and attractive man.

958
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:36,100
He is also Sir Charles Litton,

959
01:22:36,204 --> 01:22:38,407
a man of considerable influence
and reputation.

960
01:22:38,508 --> 01:22:40,331
She's got quite a point there.

961
01:22:40,429 --> 01:22:42,436
He is a fraud,
and I shall prove it.

962
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,842
Meanwhile,
I would like your permission

963
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:46,828
to surround the house
with armed guards.

964
01:22:46,925 --> 01:22:49,542
- I take it the gem is in the villa.
- It is.

965
01:22:49,644 --> 01:22:52,229
As you know, I'm having
a rather large party this evening.

966
01:22:52,332 --> 01:22:55,911
Your guests will be caused
no embarrassment whatsoever.

967
01:22:56,012 --> 01:22:59,460
They will not be aware my men
are present in their disguises.

968
01:22:59,564 --> 01:23:01,419
In that case,
you have my permission.

969
01:23:01,516 --> 01:23:02,498
Thank you.

970
01:23:14,285 --> 01:23:17,067
Your Highness, mark my words,

971
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:18,888
if Sir Charles is foolish enough

972
01:23:18,989 --> 01:23:21,411
to attempt to steal
your diamond tonight,

973
01:23:21,517 --> 01:23:24,932
you will be witness to the capture
of the notorious Phantom.

974
01:23:27,277 --> 01:23:28,292
Gentlemen.

975
01:23:44,973 --> 01:23:46,499
The plans will
have to be changed.

976
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:47,684
No.

977
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:52,680
We have to make sure
Sir Charles doesn't steal the jewel.

978
01:24:41,421 --> 01:24:43,243
- Hello.
- Hello, Tucker.

979
01:24:43,341 --> 01:24:44,715
- Like a drink?
- No, thank you.

980
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:47,628
I never drink while on duty.
You should know that. Never.

981
01:24:47,725 --> 01:24:49,994
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

982
01:24:50,093 --> 01:24:52,711
- Warm.
- Yes, it must be hell in there.

983
01:24:54,061 --> 01:24:55,523
Bet it's not so good in there.

984
01:24:56,877 --> 01:24:59,976
- Anything suspicious?
- No, nothing to worry about.

985
01:25:00,973 --> 01:25:03,362
My men are everywhere,
mingling here, mingling there.

986
01:25:03,469 --> 01:25:05,193
Watching all the time, watching.

987
01:25:10,957 --> 01:25:13,030
How dare you drink
whilst you're on duty?

988
01:25:13,133 --> 01:25:14,213
Who is inside there?

989
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:16,139
- Sergeant Walter!
- Sergeant Quinn.

990
01:25:16,237 --> 01:25:18,658
Any more behavior like this,
and I'll have your stripes.

991
01:25:18,765 --> 01:25:20,904
Now get out of here
and start mingling again.

992
01:25:24,941 --> 01:25:27,145
Quite funny that,
zebra and the stripes.

993
01:25:27,245 --> 01:25:31,752
- Yes, very good, very good.
- Not bad, not bad.

994
01:25:31,853 --> 01:25:33,195
I think I'll mingle.

995
01:25:34,189 --> 01:25:35,117
Right.

996
01:25:51,022 --> 01:25:54,186
Didn't I tell you I'd make this
the biggest social success of the year?

997
01:25:54,286 --> 01:25:55,715
Certainly you did.

998
01:25:55,822 --> 01:25:59,269
The only thing that worries me is,
what do we do for your next one?

999
01:25:59,373 --> 01:26:03,367
- How can I possibly top this?
- You'll think of something.

1000
01:26:03,469 --> 01:26:06,055
- Excuse me.
- Of course, love. Have a ball!

1001
01:26:06,157 --> 01:26:07,367
Hello, you!

1002
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:12,328
May I see
your invitation, please?

1003
01:26:14,093 --> 01:26:15,021
All right.

1004
01:26:21,934 --> 01:26:24,323
Wasn't there another gorilla
in a Rolls-Royce?

1005
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:26,502
Yes, probably a rich uncle.

1006
01:26:28,142 --> 01:26:30,662
You see, gentlemen?
Perfectly safe.

1007
01:26:30,765 --> 01:26:32,228
One cannot be too careful.

1008
01:26:32,334 --> 01:26:34,854
This party...
All your guests wearing masks.

1009
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:38,187
It was possible the Phantom
had already done his work.

1010
01:26:38,285 --> 01:26:39,463
Without an invitation,

1011
01:26:39,566 --> 01:26:41,933
how could Sir Charles
get past your guards?

1012
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,681
Where the Phantom
is concerned, Your Highness...

1013
01:26:46,573 --> 01:26:47,501
What's wrong?

1014
01:26:59,406 --> 01:27:00,388
What are you doing?

1015
01:27:00,494 --> 01:27:01,988
The question is,
what are you doing?

1016
01:27:02,094 --> 01:27:04,942
- I protest!
- Remove your head at once!

1017
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:06,348
Tucker, remove his head.

1018
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:13,992
- It's our ambassador.
- Ambassador?

1019
01:27:14,094 --> 01:27:15,948
My apologies,
Lord Cravenwood.

1020
01:27:16,046 --> 01:27:18,315
The inspector was only acting
with the best of motives.

1021
01:27:18,414 --> 01:27:19,428
Your Highness.

1022
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:29,544
Lord Cravenwood,
what would your wife think?

1023
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,934
- What's he got that I haven't got?
- George!

1024
01:27:37,038 --> 01:27:38,980
- In the flesh.
- What are you doing here?

1025
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:42,250
- Tarzan let me use the car.
- I've got to talk to you.

1026
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,844
You've got to get out of here.

1027
01:27:45,582 --> 01:27:46,564
Darling...

1028
01:27:46,671 --> 01:27:49,420
Lord Cravenwood, I'm terribly
sorry about what happened.

1029
01:27:49,518 --> 01:27:51,623
I was discussing important things
with Her Highness.

1030
01:27:51,726 --> 01:27:53,636
When I discovered you
outside the library door,

1031
01:27:53,743 --> 01:27:55,237
I thought...

1032
01:27:58,959 --> 01:28:01,032
- The ambassador.
- Yes, I know.

1033
01:28:01,134 --> 01:28:03,556
Darling, you haven't danced
with me all evening, my angel.

1034
01:28:03,662 --> 01:28:06,662
- I'm sorry, my darling.
- That's all for now.

1035
01:28:12,591 --> 01:28:15,078
Pardon me! I'm lost.

1036
01:28:15,182 --> 01:28:17,768
I must have gotten off
the main road.

1037
01:28:17,871 --> 01:28:19,561
I'm on my way to Frascati.

1038
01:28:19,663 --> 01:28:23,307
Go down the road a half mile.
You'll see a sign.

1039
01:28:23,407 --> 01:28:26,255
Turn right. It'll take you
right to the highway.

1040
01:28:44,783 --> 01:28:46,823
Excuse me, but I've got to
talk to Lord Cravenwood.

1041
01:28:46,926 --> 01:28:48,170
It's extremely important.

1042
01:28:48,271 --> 01:28:50,344
That's okay.
He's making me itch, anyway.

1043
01:28:50,448 --> 01:28:51,375
Fine.

1044
01:28:52,847 --> 01:28:56,163
Listen to me. I know what
you're up to, and it won't work.

1045
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:58,726
- You'll ruin everything.
- Excuse me, Your Excellency.

1046
01:28:58,831 --> 01:29:01,515
May I cut in?
Thank you so much, sir.

1047
01:29:01,614 --> 01:29:03,021
Are you having a good time?

1048
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:04,942
- Yes, extremely good time.
- Good.

1049
01:30:04,143 --> 01:30:06,085
Fine party, Angela darling.

1050
01:30:06,288 --> 01:30:09,157
Wait till you see
the fireworks at midnight.

1051
01:30:38,991 --> 01:30:41,741
Hello, old boy.
May I have this dance?

1052
01:30:43,216 --> 01:30:46,631
I never learned to dance.
I simply got natural rhythm.

1053
01:30:46,735 --> 01:30:48,262
You're quite right.

1054
01:30:51,344 --> 01:30:54,639
By Jove, that looked...
It is! It's Sir Charles!

1055
01:31:01,328 --> 01:31:02,310
Tucker!

1056
01:31:05,071 --> 01:31:06,894
- Inspector!
- Tucker!

1057
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:12,652
Inspector!

1058
01:31:15,696 --> 01:31:17,638
Take your filthy hands
off my asp.

1059
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,393
- Charles?
- Where's the safe?

1060
01:31:24,496 --> 01:31:26,122
In the library.
George is robbing it.

1061
01:31:26,223 --> 01:31:27,750
- Which way?
- Come on.

1062
01:31:27,855 --> 01:31:30,507
- But it's not midnight yet.
- They turned the lights out.

1063
01:31:30,609 --> 01:31:32,463
Her Highness must have
changed her mind.

1064
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,487
All right.

1065
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:36,495
Be careful.
I can't see a thing.

1066
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:39,047
Tucker? Where are you?

1067
01:31:40,944 --> 01:31:42,537
Watch where you're going!

1068
01:31:56,752 --> 01:31:57,996
It's hell in here.

1069
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:05,807
A candle!

1070
01:32:08,368 --> 01:32:10,757
- Hey, got a match?
- Yes, sir.

1071
01:32:10,865 --> 01:32:11,813
Quick, quick.

1072
01:32:31,056 --> 01:32:32,812
What kind of a candle is this?

1073
01:32:39,344 --> 01:32:41,166
In there.
George is in the gorilla suit.

1074
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:42,726
- Gorilla?
- Good luck.

1075
01:32:46,128 --> 01:32:48,038
Rule, Britannia

1076
01:32:48,144 --> 01:32:50,152
Britannia, rule the waves

1077
01:32:50,257 --> 01:32:54,053
Britons never, never, never
shall be slaves

1078
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:56,265
Rule, Britannia

1079
01:32:56,368 --> 01:32:58,824
Britannia, rule the waves...
I say!

1080
01:33:12,273 --> 01:33:13,799
Inspector! Inspector!

1081
01:33:13,904 --> 01:33:15,727
Inspector, Sir Charles is here.

1082
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:00,301
- George?
- Uncle Charles?

1083
01:36:00,402 --> 01:36:02,224
- Have you got it?
- No. Haven't you?

1084
01:36:02,321 --> 01:36:04,329
No. The safe's empty.

1085
01:36:06,897 --> 01:36:07,846
What's that?

1086
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:15,280
Someone's been
highly dishonest.

1087
01:36:15,378 --> 01:36:16,655
Follow me, men.

1088
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:22,097
You idiots!
They're getting away from us!

1089
01:36:22,194 --> 01:36:24,299
Help me to my feet, someone.
Mr. Tucker!

1090
01:36:26,386 --> 01:36:28,110
After them! Come on, Tucker!

1091
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:55,308
Come back! It's me!

1092
01:37:49,331 --> 01:37:51,665
Come on now!
Faster! Faster!

1093
01:37:53,651 --> 01:37:57,197
What's the matter with you?
Can't you drive this thing faster?

1094
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:11,021
Tucker, you're wrong.
Come on! Quick!

1095
01:38:11,122 --> 01:38:13,163
I tell you, this is the road
they've gone up.

1096
01:38:14,803 --> 01:38:17,737
Don't argue with me!
I know where they've gone.

1097
01:38:29,523 --> 01:38:31,084
George, any idea
how we get out of here?

1098
01:38:31,187 --> 01:38:32,747
I don't know.
I've been all over.

1099
01:38:32,851 --> 01:38:34,509
I've been up this street,
that one.

1100
01:38:34,611 --> 01:38:37,928
- How we gonna get out of here?
- Why don't you try the high road?

1101
01:38:38,035 --> 01:38:40,009
I'll take the high road.
You take the low road.

1102
01:38:40,115 --> 01:38:42,002
- So long, Uncle Charles.
- Ciao, George.

1103
01:39:14,003 --> 01:39:15,464
Who taught you
to drive this thing?

1104
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:30,162
- I see them! That's them!
- No, it isn't!

1105
01:40:02,675 --> 01:40:04,815
Then when I was
thrown out of college,

1106
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,126
I made up my mind.

1107
01:40:07,763 --> 01:40:09,836
I decided to live a little.

1108
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:13,359
I knew if I continued
my academic endeavors,

1109
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:15,882
I could depend upon
that check of yours every month.

1110
01:40:15,988 --> 01:40:17,395
You know what I did?

1111
01:40:17,492 --> 01:40:19,499
I took a plush
Hollywood apartment,

1112
01:40:19,603 --> 01:40:24,175
surrounded myself with all of
the advantages of a wealthy bachelor.

1113
01:40:24,276 --> 01:40:27,505
Then I sent you glowing reports
of a brilliant academic career.

1114
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:29,644
I suppose a certain
amount of dishonesty

1115
01:40:29,748 --> 01:40:32,017
is bound to beget
a certain amount of dishonesty.

1116
01:40:37,396 --> 01:40:38,476
But, Inspector...

1117
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:40,467
Come on, please.
I have not much time.

1118
01:41:02,036 --> 01:41:03,563
Better be right this time.

1119
01:41:07,732 --> 01:41:10,122
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Inspector.

1120
01:41:10,228 --> 01:41:11,657
Everything all sharp and shiny?

1121
01:41:13,236 --> 01:41:15,625
The trial is all set
for tomorrow morning.

1122
01:41:15,732 --> 01:41:18,350
- Shouldn't take too long.
- That sounds encouraging.

1123
01:41:18,452 --> 01:41:22,707
Yes, it's encouraging for me,
but bad for you.

1124
01:41:22,804 --> 01:41:24,210
Have some coffee, Inspector.

1125
01:41:24,307 --> 01:41:25,934
You could save yourself
a lot of trouble

1126
01:41:26,036 --> 01:41:27,792
if you would tell me
where the jewel is.

1127
01:41:27,893 --> 01:41:30,762
Tuck into some of that porridge.
Guaranteed good for sleuthing.

1128
01:41:30,868 --> 01:41:33,520
- You refuse to cooperate?
- We've offered porridge and coffee.

1129
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:34,668
It's all that's left.

1130
01:41:34,772 --> 01:41:37,390
I'm glad you're enjoying yourselves

1131
01:41:37,493 --> 01:41:42,130
because you're going to be here
for the next 20 years...

1132
01:41:53,653 --> 01:41:54,994
Madame Clouseau.

1133
01:41:59,413 --> 01:42:01,779
- Your Highness.
- Madame.

1134
01:42:01,876 --> 01:42:02,923
Won't you sit down?

1135
01:42:06,485 --> 01:42:08,307
I'll be brief and to the point.

1136
01:42:08,405 --> 01:42:10,347
My husband feels
he has enough evidence

1137
01:42:10,452 --> 01:42:12,339
to prove that Sir Charles
is the Phantom

1138
01:42:12,436 --> 01:42:14,324
and to convict George
as his accomplice.

1139
01:42:14,421 --> 01:42:17,039
As I see it,
they only have one chance.

1140
01:42:17,141 --> 01:42:18,799
What is that?

1141
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:22,065
If Your Highness were
to testify on their behalf,

1142
01:42:22,164 --> 01:42:26,059
somehow convince the jury
they didn't take the diamond.

1143
01:42:26,164 --> 01:42:28,946
- You surprise me, Madame.
- I expect to.

1144
01:42:29,044 --> 01:42:33,136
I'm taking the chance you will keep
what I tell you in the strictest confidence.

1145
01:42:33,236 --> 01:42:37,427
- I think I can guess.
- It's not too difficult.

1146
01:42:37,525 --> 01:42:39,597
Being the wife
of Inspector Clouseau,

1147
01:42:39,701 --> 01:42:42,548
you could have been
very helpful to Charles.

1148
01:42:43,573 --> 01:42:45,034
I have been.

1149
01:42:45,141 --> 01:42:48,403
Was stealing my dog
all part of the plan?

1150
01:42:48,501 --> 01:42:50,027
That was the plan.

1151
01:42:51,476 --> 01:42:54,673
But I think you should know
that Charles wanted to call it off.

1152
01:43:18,549 --> 01:43:20,109
You've had it all the time.

1153
01:43:20,214 --> 01:43:21,675
You stole the jewel yourself

1154
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:23,722
before the International Court
made its decision.

1155
01:43:23,829 --> 01:43:27,986
I'd sacrifice it to save Charles,
but it's not so simple.

1156
01:43:28,085 --> 01:43:30,638
Couldn't you say you found it
on the grounds or something?

1157
01:43:30,741 --> 01:43:33,905
They'd just claim he dropped it
making his escape.

1158
01:43:34,006 --> 01:43:37,486
No, to save Charles, we must prove
that someone else stole it.

1159
01:43:37,589 --> 01:43:39,444
But weâ€™d never
be able to do that.

1160
01:43:40,788 --> 01:43:41,837
I have an idea.

1161
01:43:45,269 --> 01:43:47,538
The trial is in its third day.

1162
01:43:47,637 --> 01:43:49,546
Seldom in the history
of Italian jurisprudence

1163
01:43:49,653 --> 01:43:52,174
has a trial created
such intense excitement.

1164
01:43:52,277 --> 01:43:53,325
Thousands of people...

1165
01:43:53,429 --> 01:43:55,403
and it is interesting to note,
most of them women...

1166
01:43:55,509 --> 01:43:57,713
have gathered daily
hoping to catch a glimpse

1167
01:43:57,812 --> 01:43:58,958
of Sir Charles Litton,

1168
01:43:59,062 --> 01:44:01,745
the man accused of being
the notorious Phantom.

1169
01:44:01,846 --> 01:44:04,595
The court adjourned yesterday
as the defense requested time

1170
01:44:04,693 --> 01:44:06,995
to investigate certain
new, important evidence.

1171
01:44:07,094 --> 01:44:09,843
And it is rumored that when
the court convenes today,

1172
01:44:09,941 --> 01:44:11,915
the defense will call
a surprise witness.

1173
01:44:12,757 --> 01:44:14,897
The defense has only
one witness, Mr. President.

1174
01:44:14,997 --> 01:44:17,997
Would you call Inspector
Jacques Clouseau to the stand?

1175
01:44:19,925 --> 01:44:21,299
Me, a defense witness?

1176
01:44:22,326 --> 01:44:23,700
Inspector Clouseau?

1177
01:44:23,798 --> 01:44:26,928
Nothing to worry about.
You'll make fools out of them.

1178
01:44:37,109 --> 01:44:39,892
Inspector Clouseau,
you have testified under oath

1179
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:43,601
to certain pertinent facts
concerning this case.

1180
01:44:43,701 --> 01:44:45,523
Your testimony
and your testimony alone

1181
01:44:45,621 --> 01:44:49,266
has been the major factor
in casting suspicion on the defendant.

1182
01:44:49,366 --> 01:44:50,740
Aside from the Phantom himself,

1183
01:44:50,838 --> 01:44:53,871
you are the foremost authority
on the Phantom.

1184
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:58,389
I have made
the Phantom my life's work.

1185
01:44:58,486 --> 01:45:01,420
You've testified the Phantom
has been a frequent guest

1186
01:45:01,525 --> 01:45:03,860
at the numerous parties
given by Miss Angela Dunning.

1187
01:45:03,958 --> 01:45:05,452
That is correct, yes.

1188
01:45:05,558 --> 01:45:09,780
You've testified it was either during
or sometime soon afterwards

1189
01:45:09,877 --> 01:45:12,812
that certain of Miss Dunning's guests
were robbed of their jewels.

1190
01:45:12,918 --> 01:45:13,998
Yes.

1191
01:45:14,998 --> 01:45:18,479
- How many times did this happen?
- Sixteen.

1192
01:45:18,582 --> 01:45:21,648
- Sixteen parties, sixteen thefts?
- Yes.

1193
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:25,011
- Sir Charles attended all sixteen?
- All of them.

1194
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:27,598
And how many of those parties
did you attend, Inspector?

1195
01:45:28,662 --> 01:45:29,839
All of them.

1196
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:32,753
Very interesting.

1197
01:45:34,294 --> 01:45:36,683
You attended the first party
when the jewels were stolen?

1198
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:38,284
Yes.

1199
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:40,757
The jewels were stolen
during or after the party?

1200
01:45:40,854 --> 01:45:42,610
After.

1201
01:45:42,710 --> 01:45:44,881
You knew they were
going to be stolen?

1202
01:45:44,982 --> 01:45:47,087
- Well, yes.
- How did you know?

1203
01:45:47,190 --> 01:45:49,710
That is the modus operandi
of the Phantom.

1204
01:45:49,814 --> 01:45:51,702
He always works that way.

1205
01:45:52,599 --> 01:45:53,842
I see.

1206
01:45:56,054 --> 01:45:59,316
Were the same people
always present at each party?

1207
01:45:59,415 --> 01:46:01,389
No, the guest lists varied.

1208
01:46:02,486 --> 01:46:03,696
Outside of Sir Charles,

1209
01:46:03,798 --> 01:46:06,285
was anybody else always present
at each of these parties?

1210
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:09,717
No.

1211
01:46:09,814 --> 01:46:14,637
Only Sir Charles was present at
each party when there was a robbery?

1212
01:46:14,742 --> 01:46:16,749
- Yes.
- I see.

1213
01:46:18,358 --> 01:46:20,813
- And what about you?
- Me?

1214
01:46:20,918 --> 01:46:23,952
- Yes, you.
- What about me?

1215
01:46:24,054 --> 01:46:25,712
- You were there.
- Yes.

1216
01:46:25,814 --> 01:46:29,556
Then Sir Charles was not
the only one present at each party.

1217
01:46:29,654 --> 01:46:30,931
What are you suggesting?

1218
01:46:31,031 --> 01:46:34,326
I'm not suggesting
anything... yet.

1219
01:46:38,262 --> 01:46:39,954
Inspector Clouseau?

1220
01:46:41,014 --> 01:46:42,705
How much money do you make?

1221
01:46:44,695 --> 01:46:47,346
- What has this got to do with it?
- Your salary...

1222
01:46:47,447 --> 01:46:50,545
How much does
a police inspector get paid?

1223
01:46:50,647 --> 01:46:54,443
Enough to buy a wife
a $10,000 mink coat?

1224
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:56,143
No, of course not.

1225
01:46:56,247 --> 01:46:59,542
You're aware your wife spent $7,000
at Yves St. Laurent only last month?

1226
01:47:00,886 --> 01:47:02,064
What?

1227
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:05,745
- Two months before that, $4,000.
- That's impossible.

1228
01:47:05,847 --> 01:47:10,189
Your wife spent at least $30,000
on clothes during the past year.

1229
01:47:10,294 --> 01:47:12,018
Sir, my wife is very frugal.

1230
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:14,704
She saves out of
the housekeeping money.

1231
01:47:19,607 --> 01:47:22,477
$30,000 out of
the housekeeping money.

1232
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:24,438
We have been
married for ten years.

1233
01:47:26,998 --> 01:47:28,908
About the time that
these robberies began

1234
01:47:29,015 --> 01:47:31,502
and the notorious Phantom
came into existence, correct?

1235
01:47:31,607 --> 01:47:33,908
Yes! No, not correct!

1236
01:47:34,007 --> 01:47:36,855
Of course, not correct.
Of course...

1237
01:47:36,951 --> 01:47:40,431
All right, wait. You see...

1238
01:47:42,391 --> 01:47:45,239
- It's not Sir Charles!
- He must be the Phantom!

1239
01:47:45,335 --> 01:47:47,571
It must be the inspector.

1240
01:47:49,334 --> 01:47:50,316
He's the Phantom!

1241
01:47:51,191 --> 01:47:52,271
Now...

1242
01:48:18,327 --> 01:48:20,748
No, I'm not the Phantom!
No, please! Please!

1243
01:48:29,655 --> 01:48:32,241
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank the princess.

1244
01:48:32,343 --> 01:48:35,507
- Look at that.
- No, no! I'm not the Phantom!

1245
01:48:35,607 --> 01:48:37,363
No, no, no!
I'm not the Phantom!

1246
01:48:38,295 --> 01:48:40,150
We can't just let him
rot in prison.

1247
01:48:40,248 --> 01:48:42,070
It takes years
for people to rot.

1248
01:48:42,168 --> 01:48:44,207
Besides, when the Phantom
strikes again,

1249
01:48:44,311 --> 01:48:46,133
the inspector will be
as free as a bird.

1250
01:48:46,231 --> 01:48:48,533
Want to come to South America,
George? Family rates?

1251
01:48:48,632 --> 01:48:50,770
- I wouldn't miss it, Uncle Charles.
- That's good.

1252
01:48:50,871 --> 01:48:54,351
When I retire, you might
take over the business.

1253
01:49:06,776 --> 01:49:08,685
Go back! Go home!

1254
01:49:10,391 --> 01:49:11,569
Crazy woman.

1255
01:49:11,672 --> 01:49:13,843
She's the one who tried
to tear off all his clothes.

1256
01:49:13,944 --> 01:49:16,813
- My wife.
- Wife?

1257
01:49:16,919 --> 01:49:19,254
You can thank my mother
for the flowers.

1258
01:49:19,351 --> 01:49:22,865
You're a national hero.
I envy you.

1259
01:49:22,967 --> 01:49:24,178
I'm going to prison.

1260
01:49:24,279 --> 01:49:27,279
A few years,
but after you get out...

1261
01:49:33,111 --> 01:49:34,638
Tell me, Inspector...

1262
01:49:34,743 --> 01:49:37,046
Signor Phantom...

1263
01:49:37,143 --> 01:49:39,053
All those robberies...

1264
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:41,232
How did you ever manage it?

1265
01:49:44,024 --> 01:49:45,617
You know...

1266
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:48,847
It wasn't easy.
