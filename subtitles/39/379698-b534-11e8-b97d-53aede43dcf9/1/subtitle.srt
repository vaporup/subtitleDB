1
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:36,159
Good morning, Bastian.

2
00:02:56,283 --> 00:03:00,117
I had another dream, Dad, about Mom.

3
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:06,185
I understand, son.

4
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:10,586
But we have to get on with things, right?

5
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,172
Bastian, we each have responsibilities.

6
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,978
We can't let Mom's death...

7
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:33,986
...be an excuse
for not getting the job done, right?

8
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:36,144
Yes.

9
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:54,696
Son, it's time you and I had a talk.

10
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,939
I got a call from your math teacher
yesterday.

11
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:07,581
She says that you were...

12
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:10,151
...drawing horses in your math book.

13
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:12,948
Unicorns. They were unicorns.

14
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:14,491
What?

15
00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:17,727
Nothing.

16
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:21,231
She also says you don't
do your homework on time.

17
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:28,669
I'm very disappointed you didn't even
try out for the swimming team.

18
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:33,738
As to those riding lessons you wanted...

19
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:38,945
You say you love horses
but you're afraid to get on a real one.

20
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:45,014
You're old enough to get your head down
out of the clouds and...

21
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,291
...and keep both feet on the ground.

22
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:52,624
Okay.

23
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:04,837
Stop daydreaming.
Start facing your problems. Okay?

24
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:13,677
There, I think we've had a nice talk.

25
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:16,546
We should have more.

26
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:19,615
Have a good day, son.
Don't be late for school again.

27
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,451
But, yesterday I wasn't.

28
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,300
Hey, it's the weirdo.

29
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:34,463
Weirdo, you got any cash for us today?

30
00:05:39,813 --> 00:05:41,610
Let's get him!

31
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:52,658
You can't get away.

32
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:54,824
You're dead, chicken!

33
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:56,156
We'll get you!

34
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:01,660
- Where's your money?
- I don't have any!

35
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:04,135
No money? Mamma's boy is holding out.

36
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:08,002
If you ain't got money,
you go in the garbage.

37
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:19,583
Maybe the chicken can lay an egg in there.

38
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,357
Who said you could get out of the garbage?

39
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:31,192
Get back in there.

40
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:32,629
Not again.

41
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:34,658
Not again!

42
00:06:34,734 --> 00:06:36,565
Where are you going, wimp?

43
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:47,946
- He went that way.
- Which way?

44
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:56,078
Get out of here! I don't like kids.

45
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:14,505
Are you still here? Didn't you hear me?

46
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:16,542
You're hiding, aren't you?

47
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:19,642
The video arcade is down the street.

48
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:24,781
Here we just sell small rectangular objects.
They're called books.

49
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:28,387
They require effort and make no beeps.

50
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:29,444
On your way.

51
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:33,390
I know books. I have 186 of them at home.

52
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:34,951
Comic books.

53
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:36,859
No, I've read <i>Treasure Island...</i>

54
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,328
...<i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, <i>Wizard of Oz</i>...

55
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:42,368
...<i>Lord of the Rings</i>,
<i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Tarzan.</i>

56
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:49,098
Who are you running away from?

57
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:55,474
Some kids from school.

58
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:57,247
Why?

59
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:00,450
They threw me in the garbage.

60
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:02,678
Why not punch them in the nose?

61
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:07,482
I don't know.

62
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,491
What's that book about?

63
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:20,199
Oh, this is something special.

64
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:28,504
Well, what is it?

65
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:32,249
Look.

66
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,182
Your books are safe.

67
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:39,355
While you're reading them...

68
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:44,463
...you get to become
Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.

69
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:46,692
But that's what I like about them.

70
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:50,700
But afterwards you get to be
a little boy again.

71
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:53,028
What do you mean?

72
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,700
Listen.

73
00:08:57,377 --> 00:08:58,901
Have you ever been...

74
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:01,378
...Captain Nemo...

75
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:07,175
...trapped inside your submarine
while the giant squid is attacking you?

76
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:10,653
Yes.

77
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,381
Weren't you afraid you couldn't escape?

78
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,652
But it's only a story.

79
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:18,386
That's what I'm talking about.

80
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:20,896
The ones you read...

81
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:22,394
...are safe.

82
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:27,228
And that one isn't?

83
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:31,266
Don't worry about it.

84
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,902
But you just said it was...

85
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,516
Forget about it.

86
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:47,421
This book is not for you.

87
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:58,626
Koreander's.

88
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,731
What can I do for you?

89
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,982
They run maybe 300, 370...

90
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:15,518
It will take me a couple of a weeks.

91
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,674
Math test. Oh, no!

92
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:18,671
<i>"It was midnight in the Howling Forest.</i>

93
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:23,176
<i>"The wind whistled</i>
<i>through the tops of the ancient trees.</i>

94
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:25,848
<i>"Suddenly, something enormous...</i>

95
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:29,886
<i>"...crashed and rumbled</i>
<i>through the eerie woods."</i>

96
00:12:55,782 --> 00:12:56,942
What's that?

97
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:34,678
Excuse me...

98
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:39,114
...but would it be all right
if I joined you this evening?

99
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:45,761
You see, I've been traveling all day.

100
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:15,060
Now I see why you picked this camp.

101
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,131
A delicious looking limestone rock!

102
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:35,713
Nice bouquet.

103
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:40,046
Must be a real vintage year.

104
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,079
Yes, you're right.

105
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:47,584
Those delicious rocks
are the reason we've camped here.

106
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:53,023
- Is he a nutcase?
- No, he's a Rock Biter.

107
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:54,460
A Rock Biter!

108
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,615
- Sorry.
- Poor baby.

109
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,613
Pardon me.

110
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:24,257
That was limestone, with a dash of quartz.

111
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:27,727
Very tasty.

112
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:33,771
Where I come from in the North,
we us to have exquisite gourmet rocks.

113
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,774
Only now...

114
00:15:38,744 --> 00:15:40,075
...now...

115
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:43,307
...they're all gone.

116
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,244
I know how it happened.

117
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,410
I swear it wasn't me.

118
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:53,991
I think I know what it was. Tell us more.

119
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,360
Near my home,
there used to be a beautiful lake...

120
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:00,529
...but then...

121
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,933
...then it was gone.

122
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,235
Did the lake dry up?

123
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:09,637
No. It just wasn't there anymore.

124
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:14,573
Nothing was there anymore.
Not even a dried-up lake.

125
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:16,346
A hole?

126
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:20,579
A hole would be something.
No, it was Nothing.

127
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:24,945
And it got bigger and bigger.

128
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:28,788
First, there was no lake anymore.

129
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:32,592
And then, finally, no rocks.

130
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:43,367
If he keeps stuffing his face like that,
soon there won't be any rocks here either.

131
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,878
Night Hob, this could be serious!

132
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,808
Rock Biter...

133
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:52,044
...what you told us is also happening
where I live in the West.

134
00:16:52,118 --> 00:16:55,212
A strange sort of Nothing
is destroying everything.

135
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:59,725
Yes. We Night Hobs live in the South
and it's there, too.

136
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:05,928
So, it's not just in our part of Fantasia?

137
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:10,925
Maybe, it's already everywhere.

138
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:20,641
Maybe our whole land is in danger.

139
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:23,012
What can we do?

140
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:28,049
My people are sending me to
the Ivory Tower, to the Empress, for help.

141
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,881
We are on the same...

142
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:35,320
We are on the same mission.
After all, if the Empress can't save us...

143
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:36,889
...who could?

144
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:39,487
Then why are we all just sitting here...

145
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:42,764
...instead of taking off for the Ivory Tower?

146
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:45,063
What are we waiting for?

147
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:47,435
Yes. Let's go now.

148
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,973
Wake up!

149
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,607
Come on, old girl.

150
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:52,667
We can't just hang around here.

151
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:55,580
Wake up! Ready for takeoff.

152
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:57,782
Oh, stupid bat!

153
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:02,310
We can't wait for a snail. Can I carry you?

154
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:05,755
Don't worry. It's a racing snail.

155
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:10,655
But we can't even wait for a racing snail.

156
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:16,298
It really is a racing snail.

157
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:19,765
Nobody gives a hoot
about me and my stupid bat.

158
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:35,884
Maybe I'll take a few of these
yummy gourmet rocks, for the road...

159
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,008
The Nothing!

160
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:19,520
Look!

161
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:22,627
There it is!

162
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:26,064
The heart of Fantasia!

163
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:50,718
I never knew it was that beautiful.

164
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:05,970
Stay awake!

165
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:10,238
I told you to stay awake.

166
00:20:57,663 --> 00:20:59,995
The home of the Empress.

167
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:02,658
She's our only hope.

168
00:21:36,468 --> 00:21:39,699
Friends, I know why you are all here.

169
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:42,437
The Nothing...

170
00:21:45,177 --> 00:21:47,338
...is destroying our world.

171
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:52,114
I also know that you...

172
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:54,950
...have come to beseech...

173
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:57,952
...the Empress for help.

174
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:04,319
But I have terrible news.

175
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:09,828
The Empress herself
has become deathly ill.

176
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:17,974
There seems to be a mysterious link
between her illness and the Nothing.

177
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:22,240
She's dying.

178
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:30,650
So, she cannot save us.

179
00:22:33,826 --> 00:22:35,987
But there just might be one chance.

180
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:43,662
The Plains People
who hunt the purple buffalo...

181
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:46,164
...have among them a great warrior.

182
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:50,669
He alone has a chance
to fight the Nothing and save us.

183
00:22:52,378 --> 00:22:54,369
He is our only hope.

184
00:22:57,016 --> 00:23:00,076
His name is Atreyu.

185
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:21,199
Atreyu.

186
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,651
<i>"The Empress had already</i>
<i>sent for the great warrior.</i>

187
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:39,320
<i>"When he finally appeared</i>
<i>on the terrace of the Ivory Tower...</i>

188
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:44,052
<i>"...he carried with him</i>
<i>the hopes of all Fantasia."</i>

189
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:03,307
A little boy!

190
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:08,117
I'm sorry, but this is not
the time nor place for children.

191
00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:10,750
You must leave.

192
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,082
If you don't want me here,
you shouldn't have sent for me.

193
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:18,427
Is he a nutcase?

194
00:24:18,497 --> 00:24:21,193
It was not you we sent for.
We wanted Atreyu.

195
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:23,357
I am Atreyu.

196
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:27,428
Not Atreyu the Child.

197
00:24:27,773 --> 00:24:29,400
Atreyu the Warrior.

198
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:32,137
I am the only Atreyu of the Plains People.

199
00:24:32,478 --> 00:24:35,413
But I'll be happy to go back
to hunting the purple buffalo.

200
00:24:37,383 --> 00:24:38,281
Wait!

201
00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:44,115
Come back, please.

202
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,463
If you really are the Atreyu we sent for...

203
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:01,466
...you would be willing to go on a quest?

204
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:05,473
Yes, of course.

205
00:25:06,612 --> 00:25:08,273
What kind of a quest?

206
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:11,038
To find a cure for the Empress...

207
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:15,309
...and to save our world.

208
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:19,886
No one can give you any advice
except this:

209
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:23,555
You must go alone.

210
00:25:24,797 --> 00:25:27,288
You must leave all your weapons behind.

211
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:32,002
It will be very dangerous.

212
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,466
Any chance of success?

213
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:38,838
I do not know.

214
00:25:39,478 --> 00:25:41,139
But if you fail...

215
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,171
...the Empress will surely die...

216
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:47,483
...and our whole world will be destroyed.

217
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,632
When do I begin?

218
00:26:12,044 --> 00:26:14,877
Now. And you must hurry, Atreyu.

219
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,412
The Nothing grows stronger every day.

220
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:25,216
Take this.

221
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:35,764
The Auryn!

222
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,374
He who wears the Auryn
speaks for the Empress.

223
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:49,971
It will guide and protect you.

224
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:04,154
Wake up.

225
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:05,921
Farewell, Atreyu.

226
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:08,927
Take care.

227
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:48,130

What is it, Artax?

236
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,597
Is it time to go already?

237
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:57,405
I know what you want. It's time to eat.

238
00:29:01,813 --> 00:29:02,905
Good idea.

239
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:05,445
No, it's a great idea!

240
00:29:25,303 --> 00:29:27,737
No, not too much.

241
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:31,599
We still have a long way to go.

242

What's the matter?

258

What's wrong?

00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:17,905
Come on, boy.

What's the matter?

261
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:25,314
I understand.

Artax, you're sinking! Come on!

264
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,528
Turn around! You have to! Now!

265
00:32:46,905 --> 00:32:49,066
Fight against the sadness.

266
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:53,669
Artax, please.

267
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:56,641
Don't let the sadness
of the swamps get to you.

268
00:32:57,148 --> 00:33:00,481
You have to try. You have to care.

269
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:03,052
For me.

270
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:05,681
You're my friend. I love you.

You got to move or you'll die.

273
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:17,601
Move. Please.

I won't give up. Don't quit.

Artax!

00:34:54,766 --> 00:34:56,597
The Shell Mountain.

277
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:05,603
Morla, the Ancient One.

278
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:50,981
Morla.

279
00:36:56,988 --> 00:37:01,482
But that's impossible.
They couldn't have heard me.

280
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,188
Are you Morla, the Ancient One?

281
00:37:10,902 --> 00:37:15,930
Not that it matters, but yes.

282
00:37:16,241 --> 00:37:19,540
Please help me. Do you recognize this?

283
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:21,742
Well...

284
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,012
...we haven't seen...

285
00:37:25,116 --> 00:37:29,109
...the Auryn in a long time.

286
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:30,818
We?

287
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:35,021
Is there someone else here, too?

288
00:37:35,093 --> 00:37:39,860
We haven't spoken to anyone else...

289
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:43,594
...for thousands of years.

290
00:37:44,102 --> 00:37:47,799
So we started talking...

291
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:49,863
...to ourselves.

292
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:04,583
Morla, I bring terrible news.

293
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,990
Did you know the Empress is ill?

294
00:38:07,058 --> 00:38:10,994
Not that it matters, but yes.

295
00:38:11,629 --> 00:38:14,621
Actually, we don't care.

296
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:16,699
If I don't save her, she'll die.

297
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:19,496
There's a terrible Nothing
sweeping over the land.

298
00:38:19,571 --> 00:38:20,902
Don't you care?

299
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:23,471
We don't even care...

300
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:27,469
...whether or not we care.

301
00:38:34,552 --> 00:38:35,883
Do you have a cold?

302
00:38:35,954 --> 00:38:40,288
No. We're allergic...

303
00:38:41,192 --> 00:38:42,750
...to youth.

304
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:49,292
You know how to help the Empress,
don't you?

305
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,892
Not that it matters...

306
00:38:52,737 --> 00:38:54,898
...but yes.

307
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:59,171
If you don't tell me and the Nothing
keeps coming, you'll die too. Both of you.

308
00:38:59,844 --> 00:39:01,505
Die?

309
00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:05,910
That, at least, would be something.

310
00:39:17,428 --> 00:39:20,022
Please help me.
You said you knew the answer.

311
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:24,125
We're tired of sneezing.

312
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:27,968
Go away! Nothing matters.

313
00:39:28,506 --> 00:39:32,408
That's not true.
If it didn't matter to you, you could tell me.

314
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:37,504
Clever boy.

315
00:39:37,682 --> 00:39:39,047
Tell me, please.

316
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:41,708
We don't know.

317
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:45,447
But you can ask...

318
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:47,987
...the Southern Oracle.

319
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:49,491
How can I get there?

320
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,221
You can't.

321
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:57,457
It's 10,000 miles away.

322
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:02,829
But that's so far.

323
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:04,702
That's right.

324
00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:07,807
Forget it.

325
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,172
Give up.

326
00:41:42,173 --> 00:41:43,333
No.

327
00:41:45,276 --> 00:41:47,437
Atreyu wouldn't quit now.

328
00:43:23,908 --> 00:43:25,398
Oh, boy!

- Sneak away?

Yes. I mean, no.

338
00:45:08,779 --> 00:45:10,440
I like children.

339

For breakfast?

340
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:17,586
Never. I'm a luck dragon.

341
00:45:18,222 --> 00:45:20,213
My name is Falkor.

342
00:45:21,225 --> 00:45:25,252
- And my name is...
- Atreyu. And you're on a quest.

343
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:26,760
How did you know that?

344
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:28,492
You were unconscious.

345
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:31,130
You talked in your sleep.

346
00:45:34,105 --> 00:45:36,505
Could you get around...

347
00:45:37,408 --> 00:45:40,775
...and scratch behind my right ear?

348
00:45:41,612 --> 00:45:44,775
I can never quite reach it.

349
00:45:50,888 --> 00:45:51,786
Here?

350
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:05,165
That's so good.

Thank you.

352
00:46:10,207 --> 00:46:15,076
So, little fellow, you're on your way
to the Southern Oracle?

353
00:46:15,413 --> 00:46:17,813
Yes. But it's hopeless.

354
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:22,476
- It's too far away.
- I wouldn't necessarily say that.

355
00:46:23,888 --> 00:46:25,355
You know how to get there?

356
00:46:25,423 --> 00:46:28,950
Sure. It's right around the corner.

357
00:46:29,026 --> 00:46:30,857
How did all this happen?

358
00:46:32,063 --> 00:46:33,724
With luck.

359
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:37,633
You brought me the entire 10,000 miles?

360
00:46:37,902 --> 00:46:43,534
No. Only 9,891...

361
00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:45,808
...as the dragon flies.

362
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,841
You're amazing.

363
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:53,617
Having a luck dragon with you
is the only way to go on a quest.

364
00:46:53,984 --> 00:46:56,145
Things will work out fine.

365
00:46:57,688 --> 00:47:01,522
Never give up and good luck will find you.

366
00:47:04,195 --> 00:47:06,288
It's good to have a friend again.

367
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:12,028
You have more than one.

368
00:47:13,871 --> 00:47:15,202
Look.

369
00:48:12,062 --> 00:48:14,155
Get out of my light, wench.

370
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:16,699
You're disturbing my scientific work.

371
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:19,429
You and your scientific work.

372
00:48:19,937 --> 00:48:23,600
What the boy needs now
is one of my potions.

373
00:48:24,074 --> 00:48:28,067
The boy will need
my scientific advice much more.

374
00:48:29,613 --> 00:48:31,274
But not until he's well.

375
00:48:31,448 --> 00:48:34,747
Get back to your own corner, Engy.

376
00:48:34,985 --> 00:48:37,545
I'm always finding you in my place.

377
00:48:40,224 --> 00:48:42,055
He's well.

378
00:48:43,194 --> 00:48:44,821
Now it's my turn with him.

379
00:48:44,895 --> 00:48:46,658
No, you don't!

380
00:48:47,464 --> 00:48:51,127
I'll decide when he's well.
It's your turn when I say it is.

381
00:48:53,304 --> 00:48:55,636
Well, little man, still in pain?

382
00:48:56,106 --> 00:48:57,198
It's all right.

383
00:48:57,274 --> 00:49:01,608
I like that.
The patient telling the doctor it's all right.

384
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,912
It has to hurt if it's to heal.

385
00:49:08,285 --> 00:49:09,411
Drink that.

386
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:12,521
Good?

387
00:49:13,657 --> 00:49:15,488
That's my bat-wing broth.

388
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,757
There's eye of newt in there,
tree mold, old lizard brains...

389
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:23,163
...scales from a rancid sea serpent.

390
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,334
Just where did you
and your dragon come from?

391
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:29,138
What are you on to?

392
00:49:29,373 --> 00:49:32,536
Anything of interest
to the scientific community?

393
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,602
My name is Atreyu.
I came to find the Southern Oracle.

394
00:49:36,146 --> 00:49:37,477
Here we go again.

395
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:40,445
You've come to the right place, my boy.

396
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:43,877
I am somewhat of an expert
on the Southern Oracle.

397
00:49:44,021 --> 00:49:46,990
"It is my scientific specialty."

398
00:49:47,324 --> 00:49:49,451
It is my scientific specialty.

399
00:49:50,027 --> 00:49:54,760
Why don't you sit down
and be quiet for once?

400
00:49:54,865 --> 00:49:56,799
You keep quiet, wench.

401
00:49:57,201 --> 00:49:58,429
It's my turn.

402
00:50:01,572 --> 00:50:05,804
My name is Engywook.
She's Urgl. Ever heard of me?

403
00:50:06,143 --> 00:50:07,508
I don't think so.

404
00:50:08,145 --> 00:50:10,636
You don't move in scientific circles.

405
00:50:11,115 --> 00:50:13,879
I am the expert on the Southern Oracle.

406
00:50:14,618 --> 00:50:16,813
You've come to the right place.

407
00:50:16,887 --> 00:50:19,048
There's no fool like an old fool.

408
00:50:19,223 --> 00:50:21,555
Wait! Stay here.

409
00:50:22,493 --> 00:50:25,656
The observatory. To the winch, wench.

410
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:34,502
Come on, lazybones!
Can't you go any faster?

411
00:50:37,374 --> 00:50:40,707
I've been studying
the Southern Oracle for years.

412
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:42,902
Some day I'll publish my book:

413
00:50:43,113 --> 00:50:46,776
<i>A Century of Studying the Southern Oracle</i>,
by Professor Engywook.

414
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:49,142
<i>Volume I: The Early Years.</i>

415
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:53,450
Have you ever been
to the Southern Oracle?

416
00:50:54,124 --> 00:50:55,523
What do you think?

417
00:50:55,592 --> 00:50:57,753
I work scientifically.

418
00:51:20,718 --> 00:51:21,707
Look.

419
00:51:30,427 --> 00:51:32,258
Is that the Southern Oracle?

420
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:36,425
No. It's the first of the two gates
you must pass through...

421
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,191
...before you reach the Southern Oracle...

422
00:51:39,303 --> 00:51:42,397
...and get me the final information
for my book.

423
00:51:44,141 --> 00:51:46,974
Of course, most people...

424
00:51:47,978 --> 00:51:49,969
...never get that far.

425
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:52,471
Why?

426
00:51:53,017 --> 00:51:54,348
The Sphinxes' eyes...

427
00:51:54,418 --> 00:51:59,014
...stay closed until someone
who does not feel his own worth...

428
00:51:59,423 --> 00:52:00,913
...tries to pass by.

429
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,992
Here comes one that looks fancy.

430
00:52:18,609 --> 00:52:21,942
Let's see what he really thinks of himself.

431
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:31,717
Go on, scaredy-cat!

432
00:52:35,325 --> 00:52:39,091
It's my turn. Let me see. I'm the scientist.

433
00:52:39,263 --> 00:52:40,855
He's going on.

434
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:43,791
I think he'll make it.

435
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:48,927
The Sphinxes' eyes, are they open or shut?
Let me see.

436
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,071
They're shut.

437
00:52:54,978 --> 00:52:56,468
The eyes are opening!

438
00:53:12,062 --> 00:53:14,496
Did he make it? Did he?

439
00:53:21,238 --> 00:53:23,570
Fancy armor doesn't help.

440
00:53:24,274 --> 00:53:28,574
The Sphinxes can see
straight into your heart.

441
00:53:32,683 --> 00:53:33,672
Listen.

442
00:53:33,884 --> 00:53:37,251
Next time let me see what happens.
It's my telescope.

443
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:43,321
I'm going to try.

444
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:47,727
Don't go yet.
I haven't told you about the next gate.

445
00:53:47,798 --> 00:53:49,925
It's even worse than this one.

446
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,307
He'll never make it.

447
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:10,101
Don't start to doubt yourself. Be confident.

448
00:56:15,612 --> 00:56:17,944
Be confident.

449
00:56:25,455 --> 00:56:26,649
Run, Atreyu!

450
00:56:27,591 --> 00:56:28,922
Run, Atreyu!

451
00:56:33,063 --> 00:56:34,030
Run! Now!

452
00:56:48,445 --> 00:56:49,742
He made it.

453
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,311
He made it.

454
00:56:58,622 --> 00:57:01,614
He made it!

455
00:57:05,962 --> 00:57:08,863
You could use a dose of juicy vitamins, too.

456
00:57:08,932 --> 00:57:13,767
He made it!
Atreyu made it through the Sphinx gate.

457
00:57:14,404 --> 00:57:17,134
- I always said he could do it.
- Good.

458
00:57:19,076 --> 00:57:22,637
But that's no reason
to fall out of the basket again.

459
00:57:23,347 --> 00:57:25,338
I knew he'd be safe.

460
00:57:25,816 --> 00:57:29,343
Nonsense. You don't understand anything.

461
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:35,255
The worst one is coming up.
Next is the Magic Mirror Gate.

462
00:57:36,093 --> 00:57:39,085
Atreyu must face his true self.

463
00:57:39,162 --> 00:57:43,258
So what? That won't be too hard for him.

464
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,824
That's what everyone thinks.

465
00:57:46,336 --> 00:57:49,499
But kind people find that they are cruel.

466
00:57:50,107 --> 00:57:53,873
Brave men discover
they are really cowards.

467
00:57:54,444 --> 00:57:56,912
Confronted with their true selves...

468
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,472
...most men run away screaming.

469
00:59:57,133 --> 00:59:59,465
Now, this is going too far.

470
01:00:18,922 --> 01:00:20,412
What if they...

471
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:24,023
...really do know about me in Fantasia?

472
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:14,900
The Southern Oracle?

473
01:01:34,431 --> 01:01:36,365
<i>Do not be afraid.</i>

474
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,361
<i>We will not harm you.</i>

475
01:01:41,504 --> 01:01:45,998
<i>We have been waiting for you a long time.</i>

476
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,411
Are you the Southern Oracle?

477
01:01:52,882 --> 01:01:55,510
<i>Yes, we are.</i>

478
01:01:55,986 --> 01:01:58,648
Then you must know
what can save Fantasia.

479
01:01:59,055 --> 01:02:01,615
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

480
01:02:02,959 --> 01:02:05,951
Well, what is it? I have to know!

481
01:02:06,429 --> 01:02:07,760
<i>The Empress...</i>

482
01:02:09,165 --> 01:02:10,598
<i>...needs...</i>

483
01:02:11,201 --> 01:02:13,032
<i>...a new name.</i>

484
01:02:14,971 --> 01:02:18,600
A new name? That's all?

485
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:20,369
But that's easy.

486
01:02:21,911 --> 01:02:24,175
I can give her any name she wants.

487
01:02:24,614 --> 01:02:27,242
<i>No one from Fantasia...</i>

488
01:02:28,218 --> 01:02:29,879
<i>...can do it.</i>

489
01:02:30,286 --> 01:02:32,948
<i>Only a human child...</i>

490
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:36,622
<i>...can give her this new name.</i>

491
01:02:42,332 --> 01:02:45,165
A human child? Where can I find one?

492
01:02:45,669 --> 01:02:48,001
<i>You can only find one...</i>

493
01:02:49,506 --> 01:02:53,169
<i>...beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.</i>

494
01:02:59,215 --> 01:03:02,048
<i>If you want to save our world...</i>

495
01:03:02,886 --> 01:03:04,683
<i>...you must hurry.</i>

496
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:09,452
<i>We don't know...</i>

497
01:03:09,626 --> 01:03:13,460
<i>...how much longer</i>
<i>we can withstand the Nothing.</i>

498
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,165
Falkor!

499
01:03:39,522 --> 01:03:42,184
Hurry, Falkor! The Nothing's everywhere.

500
01:03:42,292 --> 01:03:44,089
Don't worry.

501
01:03:44,928 --> 01:03:48,091
We'll reach the boundaries of Fantasia.

502
01:03:48,198 --> 01:03:52,032
- Do you know where they are?
- I have no idea.

503
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:55,301
Then how do we find a human child?

504
01:03:55,638 --> 01:03:57,299
With luck.

505
01:03:58,808 --> 01:04:01,800
Faster, Falkor! We have to hurry.

506
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:04,844
All right, hang on tight.

507
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,982
What a shame they don't ask me.

508
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:22,321
My mother...

509
01:05:23,092 --> 01:05:25,754
...she had such a wonderful name.

510
01:05:41,244 --> 01:05:45,908
"On and on they flew
until they reached the Sea of Possibilities...

511
01:05:46,349 --> 01:05:48,317
"...where they could go no further."

512
01:05:50,653 --> 01:05:52,985
Look, Atreyu. The Nothing.

513
01:06:53,316 --> 01:06:54,647
Atreyu.

514
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:25,240
Falkor!

515
01:07:29,485 --> 01:07:31,646
Where are you?

516
01:07:53,376 --> 01:07:56,573
Atreyu! Where are you?

517
01:08:48,297 --> 01:08:51,198
They look like big...

518
01:08:51,467 --> 01:08:55,597
...good, strong hands, don't they?

519
01:08:57,273 --> 01:09:01,266
I always thought that's what they were.

520
01:09:05,815 --> 01:09:08,283
My little friends.

521
01:09:08,718 --> 01:09:11,380
The little man with his racing snail...

522
01:09:11,687 --> 01:09:13,279
...the Night Hob...

523
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:16,618
...even the stupid bat.

524
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,393
I couldn't hold on to them.

525
01:09:21,697 --> 01:09:23,028
The Nothing...

526
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,633
...pulled them right out of my hands.

527
01:09:29,205 --> 01:09:30,866
I failed.

528
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,332
No, you didn't fail. I'm the one who failed.

529
01:09:34,777 --> 01:09:37,610
I was the one chosen to stop the Nothing.

530
01:09:39,282 --> 01:09:41,113
But I lost the Auryn.

531
01:09:41,617 --> 01:09:43,778
I can't find my luck dragon.

532
01:09:44,087 --> 01:09:47,579
So I won't be able to get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

533
01:09:56,132 --> 01:09:57,463
Listen.

534
01:09:58,034 --> 01:09:59,524
The Nothing...

535
01:10:00,002 --> 01:10:01,902
...will be here any minute.

536
01:10:02,538 --> 01:10:05,029
I will just sit here...

537
01:10:05,741 --> 01:10:08,232
...and let it take me away, too.

538
01:10:09,846 --> 01:10:11,507
They look...

539
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:14,212
...like good...

540
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:16,481
...strong...

541
01:10:16,686 --> 01:10:19,883
...hands, don't they?

542
01:11:22,552 --> 01:11:23,541
Morla?

543
01:11:26,989 --> 01:11:28,479
Artax!

544
01:12:19,775 --> 01:12:21,766
If you come any closer...

545
01:12:22,979 --> 01:12:25,812
...I will rip you to shreds.

546
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:34,022
Who are you?

547
01:12:34,123 --> 01:12:36,455
I am Gmork.

548
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,323
And you, whoever you are...

549
01:12:41,998 --> 01:12:45,729
...can have the honor
of being my last victim.

550
01:12:49,505 --> 01:12:51,200
I will not die easily.

551
01:12:51,941 --> 01:12:53,602
I am a warrior.

552
01:12:55,044 --> 01:12:57,035
Brave warrior.

553
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:59,411
Then fight the Nothing.

554
01:12:59,482 --> 01:13:03,384
I can't. I can't get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

555
01:13:06,055 --> 01:13:07,522
What's so funny?

556
01:13:07,623 --> 01:13:11,457
Fantasia has no boundaries.

557
01:13:17,767 --> 01:13:19,132
That's not true.

558
01:13:19,435 --> 01:13:22,097
- You're lying.
- Foolish boy.

559
01:13:23,906 --> 01:13:27,000
Don't you know anything about Fantasia?

560
01:13:27,877 --> 01:13:30,869
It's the world of human fantasy.

561
01:13:33,382 --> 01:13:35,043
Every part...

562
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:37,443
...every creature...

563
01:13:38,187 --> 01:13:42,521
...is a piece of the dreams
and hopes of mankind.

564
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,521
Therefore...

565
01:13:47,363 --> 01:13:50,332
...it has no boundaries.

566
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,131
Why is Fantasia dying then?

567
01:14:00,376 --> 01:14:04,210
Because people have begun
to lose their hopes...

568
01:14:05,481 --> 01:14:08,143
...and forget their dreams.

569
01:14:09,318 --> 01:14:12,151
So the Nothing grows stronger.

570
01:14:12,655 --> 01:14:14,145
What is the Nothing?

571
01:14:14,423 --> 01:14:17,085
It's the emptiness that's left.

572
01:14:18,494 --> 01:14:20,655
It is like a despair...

573
01:14:21,163 --> 01:14:23,324
...destroying this world.

574
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,194
And I have been trying to help it.

575
01:14:29,138 --> 01:14:30,230
But why?

576
01:14:30,606 --> 01:14:33,598
Because people who have no hopes...

577
01:14:34,343 --> 01:14:36,607
...are easy to control.

578
01:14:38,013 --> 01:14:40,675
And whoever has the control...

579
01:14:42,118 --> 01:14:44,450
...has the power.

580
01:14:59,235 --> 01:15:01,135
Who are you, really?

581
01:15:01,704 --> 01:15:03,695
I am the servant...

582
01:15:05,274 --> 01:15:08,107
...of the power behind the Nothing.

583
01:15:09,345 --> 01:15:12,678
I was sent to kill the only one...

584
01:15:13,315 --> 01:15:15,647
...who could have stopped the Nothing.

585
01:15:16,285 --> 01:15:19,618
I lost him in the Swamps of Sadness.

586
01:15:20,256 --> 01:15:21,587
His name...

587
01:15:22,892 --> 01:15:24,223
...was Atreyu.

588
01:15:28,764 --> 01:15:32,928
If we're about to die anyway,
I'd rather die fighting.

589
01:15:33,669 --> 01:15:37,196
Come for me, Gmork. I am Atreyu!

590
01:17:09,532 --> 01:17:11,022
Falkor!

591
01:17:20,376 --> 01:17:22,037
Atreyu!

592
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,733
<i>"That was the end of Fantasia.</i>

593
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:51,405
<i>"Only a few fragments of this once...</i>

594
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:55,838
<i>"...rich and beautiful world</i>
<i>had been left by the Nothing."</i>

595
01:18:06,322 --> 01:18:08,153
Good old Falkor.

596
01:18:08,691 --> 01:18:13,060
- Can you see anything? Anything at all?
- No.

597
01:18:14,363 --> 01:18:16,854
All the land is gone.

598
01:18:18,033 --> 01:18:21,366
I know. And all because I failed.

599
01:18:22,571 --> 01:18:24,129
You tried.

600
01:18:24,573 --> 01:18:27,064
Could the Ivory Tower still be standing?

601
01:18:27,476 --> 01:18:31,708
Let's hope so, Atreyu. Let's hope so.

602
01:18:36,552 --> 01:18:38,543
Let the Auryn guide you.

603
01:18:40,289 --> 01:18:44,282
If the Ivory Tower still stands,
take us there.

604
01:19:04,113 --> 01:19:05,774
The Ivory Tower!

605
01:20:09,044 --> 01:20:10,534
The Empress.

606
01:20:35,771 --> 01:20:37,102
Go on.

607
01:21:19,047 --> 01:21:21,880
Why do you look so sad?

608
01:21:38,734 --> 01:21:40,531
I have failed you, Empress.

609
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,400
You haven't.

610
01:21:48,143 --> 01:21:49,770
You brought him with you.

611
01:21:51,814 --> 01:21:52,803
Who?

612
01:21:53,448 --> 01:21:55,678
The earthling child.

613
01:21:56,418 --> 01:21:58,010
The one...

614
01:21:58,086 --> 01:22:00,247
...who can save us all.

615
01:22:00,989 --> 01:22:03,150
You knew about the earthling child?

616
01:22:04,226 --> 01:22:08,060
Of course. I knew everything.

617
01:22:09,631 --> 01:22:12,998
My horse died, I nearly drowned.

618
01:22:13,268 --> 01:22:15,668
I just barely got away from the Nothing.

619
01:22:15,804 --> 01:22:18,602
For what? To find out
what you already knew?

620
01:22:18,674 --> 01:22:22,007
It was the only way
to get in touch with an earthling.

621
01:22:22,277 --> 01:22:24,541
But I didn't get in touch with an earthling!

622
01:22:26,315 --> 01:22:27,976
Yes, you did.

623
01:22:29,251 --> 01:22:30,684
He has suffered with you.

624
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,912
<i>He went through everything</i>
<i>you went through.</i>

625
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:38,991
<i>And now, he has come here...</i>

626
01:22:40,028 --> 01:22:41,086
<i>...with you.</i>

627
01:22:42,264 --> 01:22:45,427
He is very close, listening...

628
01:22:46,568 --> 01:22:50,698
...to every word we say.

629
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,229
What?

630
01:23:07,389 --> 01:23:11,120
Where is he?
If he's so close, why doesn't he arrive?

631
01:23:16,465 --> 01:23:21,300
He doesn't realize
he's already part of <i>The Neverending Story</i>.

632
01:23:23,772 --> 01:23:25,569
<i>The Neverending Story</i>?

633
01:23:25,641 --> 01:23:27,233
What's that?

634
01:23:27,309 --> 01:23:30,767
Just as he is sharing all your adventures...

635
01:23:30,879 --> 01:23:33,370
...others are sharing his.

636
01:23:33,916 --> 01:23:35,178
They were with him...

637
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:38,383
<i>...when he hid from the boys</i>
<i>in the bookstore.</i>

638
01:23:40,989 --> 01:23:42,684
But that's impossible!

639
01:23:42,925 --> 01:23:45,416
They were with him
when he took the book...

640
01:23:45,594 --> 01:23:47,653
...with the Auryn symbol on the cover...

641
01:23:48,797 --> 01:23:52,096
<i>...in which he's reading his own story...</i>

642
01:23:52,968 --> 01:23:54,458
...right now.

643
01:23:59,975 --> 01:24:01,966
I can't believe it.

644
01:24:03,445 --> 01:24:05,777
They can't be talking about me.

645
01:24:09,051 --> 01:24:11,076
What if he doesn't appear?

646
01:24:11,153 --> 01:24:13,553
Then our world will disappear.

647
01:24:14,556 --> 01:24:16,217
And so will I.

648
01:24:19,528 --> 01:24:21,325
How could he let that happen?

649
01:24:21,396 --> 01:24:26,197
He doesn't understand that he's the one
with the power to stop it.

650
01:24:26,268 --> 01:24:28,702
He simply can't imagine...

651
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:31,637
...that one little boy
could be that important.

652
01:24:34,443 --> 01:24:35,910
Is it really me?

653
01:24:36,878 --> 01:24:38,505
Maybe he doesn't know what to do.

654
01:24:38,947 --> 01:24:40,414
What do I have to do?

655
01:24:41,183 --> 01:24:44,175
He has to give me a new name.

656
01:24:44,519 --> 01:24:46,680
He's already chosen it.

657
01:24:47,789 --> 01:24:49,780
He just has to call it out.

658
01:24:53,628 --> 01:24:56,153
But it's only a story. It's not real.

659
01:24:56,264 --> 01:24:57,356
It's only a story.

660
01:24:58,867 --> 01:25:00,858
Atreyu, no!

661
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,221
Bastian!

662
01:25:29,297 --> 01:25:32,960
Why don't you do
what you dream, Bastian?

663
01:25:33,301 --> 01:25:36,737
But I can't.
I must keep my feet on the ground.

664
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:38,700
Call my name.

665
01:25:41,309 --> 01:25:44,301
Bastian, please!

666
01:25:46,314 --> 01:25:47,645
Save us!

667
01:25:47,716 --> 01:25:49,809
<i>All right! I'll do it!</i>

668
01:25:50,085 --> 01:25:53,782
I'll save you. I will do what I dream.

669
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:20,971
<i>Why is it so dark?</i>

670
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:25,684
<i>In the beginning, it is always dark.</i>

671
01:26:30,692 --> 01:26:32,182
What is that?

672
01:26:32,761 --> 01:26:34,922
One grain of sand.

673
01:26:35,564 --> 01:26:39,227
It is all that remains of my vast empire.

674
01:26:47,075 --> 01:26:49,839
Fantasia has totally disappeared?

675
01:26:51,346 --> 01:26:52,836
Yes.

676
01:26:55,717 --> 01:26:58,208
Then everything's been in vain.

677
01:26:59,054 --> 01:27:01,215
No, it hasn't.

678
01:27:02,557 --> 01:27:05,185
Fantasia can arise anew...

679
01:27:06,761 --> 01:27:09,423
...from your dreams and wishes.

680
01:27:11,233 --> 01:27:12,393
How?

681
01:27:13,168 --> 01:27:14,999
Open your hand.

682
01:27:29,918 --> 01:27:32,079
What are you going to wish for?

683
01:27:34,322 --> 01:27:35,619
I don't know.

684
01:27:37,459 --> 01:27:41,293
Then there will be no Fantasia anymore.

685
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,529
How many wishes do I get?

686
01:27:49,137 --> 01:27:51,128
As many as you want.

687
01:27:51,973 --> 01:27:54,464
And the more wishes you make...

688
01:27:54,976 --> 01:27:58,605
...the more magnificent
Fantasia will become.

689
01:27:58,914 --> 01:28:00,074
Really?

690
01:28:01,016 --> 01:28:02,506
Try it.

691
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:17,527
Then my first wish is...

692
01:28:26,775 --> 01:28:29,710
Falkor, it's even more beautiful
than I thought!

693
01:28:40,755 --> 01:28:44,247
- Like it?
- Falkor, it's wonderful.

694
01:28:49,231 --> 01:28:52,894
Falkor, it's like the Nothing never was.

695
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,881
Atreyu and Artax!

696
01:29:27,502 --> 01:29:30,494
What would you like to wish for next?

697
01:30:00,402 --> 01:30:02,393
Look, there they are.

698
01:30:03,905 --> 01:30:05,395
It's a monster!

699
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:10,375
Get them, Falkor!
Let's see how you like it, chickens.

700
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:12,010
Down here.

701
01:30:26,628 --> 01:30:29,062
We're going to get you!

702
01:30:54,956 --> 01:30:57,117
<i>Bastian made many other wishes...</i>

703
01:30:57,759 --> 01:31:00,421
<i>...and had many other</i>
<i>amazing adventures...</i>

704
01:31:01,529 --> 01:31:04,521
<i>...before he finally returned</i>
<i>to the ordinary world.</i>

705
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:08,192
<i>But that's another story.</i>
