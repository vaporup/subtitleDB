1
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,318
Lau Man-chai from Shandong,
Moun Chun from Shanxi

2
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,278
Dai Nan-gai from Shensi,
Shun Do Wong-bat from Hunan

3
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,477
and Ga Gung-gung from Beijing
all bought their guns from me.

4
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,916
Everybody makes friends with me.

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,560
What about Fok Lo-dai from Kunming?

6
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,473
We've gone through a lot together.

7
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,949
But my grandfather retired
20 years ago.

8
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,349
Oh, you are Fok Lo-dai's
granddaughter?

9
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,078
Why didn't you say so?

10
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,914
You'll make a fortune
transporting my goods.

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,992
Let's worry about this deal now
and we'll talk later.

12
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,158
Baldy!

13
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,794
I know him really well. I remember
when he had a full head of hair.

14
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,753
They're coming!

15
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,033
Everybody, I'm here again.

16
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,953
How are you all?

17
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,032
Long time no see.

18
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,510
Low Sai, you've put on weight.
Chow Pei, your skin is so smooth.

19
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,717
How Tow, you fought with Dan Nan-ying
and lived to tell the tale.

20
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,153
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

21
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,389
Brother Wang!

22
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,719
How are you, brother Wang?

23
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,429
- I haven't seen you for a long time.
- It's been ages.

24
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,353
I'm glad to see you today, brother.

25
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,793
Are these your goods?

26
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,512
The goods you want. I'd go through
hell's fires to bring you this.

27
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,518
There is a story behind this,
everybody.

28
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,072
The Japanese were able to conquer
Manchuria all because of this weapon.

29
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,357
You can do anything with this gun -
including killing that Dan Nan-ying.

30
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,079
Cut the crap and give us
a demonstration.

31
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,115
OK.

32
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,389
Don't judge it by its size. You can
kill from one hundred feet away.

33
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,230
Stand back.
It makes a really big bang.

34
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,312
Let me try.

35
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,392
What are you laughing at?

36
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,472
I don't know how to use it.

37
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,475
It's really easy-open it, put
in the bullets, close it and lock it.

38
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,675
That's it.

39
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,113
OK.

40
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,519
Stand in front.

41
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,916
Dan Nan-ying is gonna die!

42
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,673
Hey, don't get me wrong,
I don't want revenge.

43
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,548
But you killed him, so how will I
collect the money he owed me?

44
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,231
Of course you'll get your money.

45
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,153
OK, hand over my 20 quid, please.

46
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,556
There's more than a hundred in here.

47
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,359
Come and get it.

48
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,351
You are a pain in the neck.

49
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,634
Get rid of her!

50
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,430
Will you pay me now?

51
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,398
I will.

52
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,709
Fuck you!

53
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,471
I will, I will!

54
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,510
You could have paid me earlier.

55
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,998
Now we're quits.

56
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,958
After her!

57
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,913
Fuck your grandmother, you bitch!

58
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,835
Bitch!

59
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,709
Fuck your ancestors!

60
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,799
"United East Asia!"

61
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,474
The Japanese are serious trouble.

62
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,632
Son of a bitch!

63
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,993
Are you mad?

64
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,988
What about that Chinese guy?

65
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,593
He's gone.

66
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,390
Thank you. Bye.

67
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,434
My Lord.

68
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,480
Turn around! Quickly, turn around!

69
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,028
- Why?
- Do I have to explain my order?

70
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,872
Count to five hundred, quick.

71
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,273
OK.
One, two, three, four, five...

72
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,954
Do you want to get me killed?
You could be recognised coming here.

73
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,508
My identity has been exposed.

74
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,477
What?!
Then I'm finished.

75
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,189
Don't worry,
they don't know you're co-operating.

76
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,599
That's better.

77
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,109
Aren't you going
to a council meeting?

78
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,872
Shit! I almost forgot.

79
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,110
You must postpone it.

80
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,236
- Postpone it?!
- As a favour to me.

81
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,197
Someone's flying over to get you.

82
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,714
What, again?!
I've never seen so much as a fly!

83
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,994
Don't tell anyone you eavesdrop.

84
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,113
...ninety-two, ninety-three,
ninety-four, ninety-five...

85
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,950
So many people!
What should I say today?

86
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,828
Regarding imperial Japan's
development of this city Kaa Yi,

87
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,911
I wonder if you have made a decision.

88
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,752
I'm still thinking about it.

89
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,670
We already agreed to co-operate
with the Japanese.

90
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,113
Did we?

91
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,032
It seems we did.

92
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,473
Yes, yes.

93
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,439
I've talked about the development. We
are going to build a chemical plant.

94
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,318
- Do you mean a poison gas plant?
- Yes.

95
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,239
If you have no objections, I'll start
sending in the raw materials.

96
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,311
There's no need to hurry.

97
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,598
Don't worry, My Lord, everything is
arranged, it shouldn't be a problem.

98
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,755
Well, in that case, the materials
will be shipped here in four days.

99
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,912
Come on!

100
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,754
Are you going to tell
the truth or not?!

101
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,829
I'll chop it off!

102
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,990
- Are you OK, Grandpa?
- I'm fine.

103
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,072
What happened, Grandpa?

104
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,951
Lung, didn't I tell you
there's no need to test her?

105
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,793
Now do you believe how good
my granddaughter is?

106
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,791
Not bad, not bad.

107
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,716
Come and say hello to Uncle Lung.
He is a pillar of our community.

108
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,995
I do look like some Mafia boss.

109
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,760
We're not just playing with you.

110
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,393
It's a matter that concerns
the whole country, all of us.

111
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,392
This here is Puttan.
There's a city there called Kaa Yi.

112
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,755
The ruler of the city is Youda.

113
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,115
He's got some information
on the Japanese,

114
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,270
but he's scared to death of them.

115
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,069
If we fly him to Guangzhou City,
he'll tell us what he knows.

116
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,513
So...

117
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,400
Ming-ming, we're doing this
for our country. Don't get mad.

118
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,072
I should be mad.

119
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,913
You make a simple matter like this
so complicated.

120
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,877
Why don't you just tell me to go?

121
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,954
- When do I leave?
- Tomorrow morning.

122
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,591
Right, when you get to Kaa Yi City,
look for our agent Sky 001.

123
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,638
But I've never met him.

124
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,073
No problem.

125
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,752
Just remember this watch.

126
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,988
OK.

127
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,798
- The pigeon.
- Yes.

128
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,679
Pigeon, pigeon,
what do you need a watch for?

129
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,149
There is a Chinese plane ahead.

130
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,595
- Shoot it down.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,076
Have you seen this man?

132
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,355
Have you seen this man?

133
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,078
Have you seen this guy?

134
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,639
- Have you?
- Have you seen him?

135
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,757
- Well, have you?
- Have you?

136
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,434
Asshole! I bet you everything
you've got!

137
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,192
No problem. Come on.

138
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,719
Yours is heavier.

139
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,518
For telescopic sight.

140
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,109
A wonderful torch.

141
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,793
This is America's newest toy,
the yo-yo.

142
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,233
It's almost there.

143
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,189
Let's play.

144
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,798
Is it loaded?

145
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,388
Use another one.

146
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,750
- Use this.
- No problem.

147
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,355
It's gone.

148
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,678
I'll go and get it.

149
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,672
Why did you throw it away?
I don't trust you.

150
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,672
Stay here, I'll be right back.

151
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,519
Who are you?

152
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,872
You must have the wrong guy.

153
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,838
A lot of people look alike,
don't you agree?

154
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,438
Stop it!

155
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,400
Who dares to make trouble
in Kaa Yi City?

156
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,357
Those three big guys over there.

157
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,313
Mind your own goddam business, bitch!

158
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,797
Come on, fight back.

159
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,271
You stay out of it.

160
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,189
Good... You are really fantastic.
Thanks for helping out.

161
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,714
That should teach you guys a lesson
for cheating.

162
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,837
He cheated us and beat us up.
Our reputations are ruined!

163
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,833
- They're completely unreasonable.
- Who said we're unreasonable?

164
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,150
You started all this trouble!

165
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,515
He cheated us.
We should teach him a lesson.

166
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,068
- Am I right?
- I can't say you're wrong.

167
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,594
I bet with them, I won.
That's not wrong.

168
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,999
You're not wrong either.

169
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,752
But he's a swindler.

170
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,319
Then you're wrong.

171
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,675
We played Numbers.
He threw 2, I threw 6.

172
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,478
- So I win, right?
- Right.

173
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,835
- He threw 5, I threw 6. I win, yes?
- Yes.

174
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,957
- He threw 6, I threw 7. I win, yes?
- No.

175
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,558
The biggest number on a die is 6,
you cheated!

176
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,198
Stop it!

177
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,511
Everybody said you're wrong,
so you must be wrong.

178
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,273
If you're wrong, they must be right.

179
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,271
I helped you, so I must be wrong.

180
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,509
Yes, you are wrong.

181
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,319
If you help a guy to correct
his mistakes...

182
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,719
- Are you right?
- Right.

183
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,349
Cheating is wrong,
but you helping me was right, right?

184
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,714
Right.

185
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,995
Wait, wait, let me think.

186
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,833
You cheated, you're wrong.
I helped you, I'm right.

187
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,230
You are a cheat. You beat him up.
You're wrong. You're right.

188
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,390
You're causing trouble,
you're wrong!

189
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,074
It's too complicated. I quit!

190
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,158
Why don't we have a drink?

191
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,077
Come on, guys, let's talk about this.
No more fighting, OK?

192
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,477
Do you think I will run away
or something?

193
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,031
Help! Help!

194
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,720
If you get a kick out of beating me
then beat me.

195
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,992
Hey, hold it, guys.

196
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,433
Sky 001, I'll help you.

197
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,988
- OK, help me get rid of them.
- OK.

198
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,796
I want that one. Hurry up.

199
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,593
Don't you want this?

200
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,075
Thank you for saving my life, lady.

201
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,639
- Eat something.
- Don't waste your time, Sky 001.

202
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,392
What's this Sky 001?

203
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,634
So you know I'm Sky 001, now what?

204
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,392
Go save Youda.

205
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,869
Excuse me. Why should I save Youda?

206
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,873
I've got my money,
my job is to take Youda away.

207
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,473
Money? Do I get paid?

208
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,597
You two want to save Youda?

209
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,318
What if I say yes?

210
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,879
I certainly hope so.

211
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,632
Why is that?

212
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,432
You are...?

213
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,839
I am Sky 001.

214
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,675
I am 003, he's 004.
We are disguised as Japanese.

215
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,470
No wonder I've never seen you before.
I am your superior.

216
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,915
- We're leaving.
- Where to?

217
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,913
Didn't headquarters tell you? We're
to take Youda's jewellery as well.

218
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,992
Of course they did.

219
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,832
Let's go.

220
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,516
Please, it's just around the corner.

221
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,953
Really?

222
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,792
It's quite near.

223
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,193
We'll be there soon.

224
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,316
Don't move
or I'll blow a hole in you.

225
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,793
Don't move.

226
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,118
You're Japanese?
But you're mistaken. I'm not Sky 001.

227
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,918
We knew that.

228
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,198
What's the problem?
It's none of my business.

229
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,551
What are you doing? Can we talk?

230
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,552
Yes, why don't we talk?

231
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,596
We'll talk inside, move!

232
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,673
Thank you.

233
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,715
Don't move!

234
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,638
Come on...

235
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,677
Back to headquarters with me.

236
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,516
Don't chase him. Let's go.

237
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,998
Why did you save us?

238
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,832
Because I'm Sky 001.

239
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,911
I just found this.

240
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,594
- Where are you taking us now?
- To save Youda.

241
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,470
You two please go ahead. I've got
some urgent matters to attend to.

242
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,753
Leave him.
If the Japanese go into the palace,

243
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,308
Youda's co-operation
will no longer be secret.

244
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,038
It will be difficult to save him.

245
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,714
Why is it difficult?
At worst, we'll have to fight.

246
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,949
Come on.

247
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,238
This way.

248
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,837
Thanks for saving my life.

249
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,559
But you saved me twice,
I still owe you.

250
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,029
But don't worry, I'll pay you back.

251
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,917
I'm beginning to understand
why Headquarters sent a girl.

252
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,831
To quash your chauvinism.

253
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,912
Now we'll do a test.

254
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,230
This is the result
of a joint experiment

255
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,630
between the Japanese Empire
and a neighbouring country.

256
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,359
But General Toga,
he only drives the sheep.

257
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,352
This can of gas is small
but it can kill more than ten men.

258
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,510
His family depends on
this one man here.

259
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,477
It only takes five seconds.

260
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,073
Five seconds?

261
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,796
If you want to test it,
test it on a dog.

262
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,190
- Is it really that powerful?
- Try it if you don't believe me.

263
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,191
I'm going to take a bath.

264
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,553
Come on.

265
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,516
Come with me.

266
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,394
Don't be afraid,
I'll give you another chance.

267
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,517
If you can hold your breath
for five seconds, you're safe.

268
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,115
One... two...

269
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,759
Five!

270
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,911
Damn Japanese!

271
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,956
It's important to save Youda.

272
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,759
OK, you look for him,
I'll watch the Japanese.

273
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,193
OK.

274
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,070
Stay cool, I still owe you one.
If you die, I can't pay you back.

275
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,273
Congratulations, General.

276
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,999
With this gas,
the imperial Army is invincible.

277
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,072
Even without it,
we are still invincible.

278
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,798
I want this war to end quickly.

279
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,269
General, General!

280
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,470
General, there is a Chinese woman
here looking for Youda.

281
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,433
Youda is...

282
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,554
Spread out!

283
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,155
Who are you?

284
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,629
You look so nervous.
You must be Youda.

285
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,870
- What are you?
- Chinese.

286
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,717
You're all right. It's probably
just Sky 001. I'll get it.

287
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,473
You'll get me
in serious trouble, woman. Hide!

288
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,154
Why should I hide?

289
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,153
If you don't hide, I'll...

290
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,433
Youda...

291
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,915
Keep it down.

292
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,638
Are you decent?

293
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,676
Of course! I'm no exhibitionist!

294
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,670
There's a woman here looking for you.

295
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,591
- I know.
- How did you know?

296
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,669
Aren't you a woman?

297
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,115
You finally see me as a woman.

298
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,031
Youda...

299
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,511
Stop fooling around. I think
that woman wants to rescue you.

300
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,068
You're so bad,
you should have told me.

301
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,754
I don't even have enough time
to pack.

302
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,592
What are you talking about?

303
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,148
You fooled me last time
at the temple.

304
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,117
I heard you talking to Sky 001.

305
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,352
You said if I didn't tell my dad,
you would take me with you!

306
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,395
So what!

307
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,119
You're having second thoughts?
I'll tell my dad!

308
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,634
Chin-chin!

309
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,594
It's my dad, what should I do?

310
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,318
Shit!

311
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,910
What took you so long to answer?
I thought you'd been kidnapped.

312
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,355
I was just bathing.
I didn't hear you.

313
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,989
A woman came into this palace.
She may be hiding in here.

314
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,390
I was bathing. I didn't see anyone.

315
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,997
For your safety,
I want this room searched.

316
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,591
Your daughter's in there.

317
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,278
There was a spider.

318
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,517
- Who are you?
- The Chinese woman.

319
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,318
Our city does not welcome Chinese.

320
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,834
You don't? Well, I'll go, then.

321
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,433
Not so fast!

322
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,799
Youda.

323
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,992
You want to kill me.

324
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,393
Shit.

325
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,313
If you want to help me live,
stop your father.

326
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,958
If you go, then what about me?

327
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,837
OK, I'll meet you at the temple.

328
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,035
Help!

329
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,429
Are you all right?

330
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,953
I'll help you, Dad.

331
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,594
Please get Youda out of here.
I'll stop Dad for you.

332
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,635
Fine.

333
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,153
- Murderer!
- Don't stop me!

334
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,639
- Kick me.
- OK.

335
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,558
Hurry up!

336
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,558
Hurry up!

337
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,039
Over here, woman.

338
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,873
I'm just a wanderer.
It's none of my business.

339
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,030
Why did China send you here?

340
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,796
Send me here? What for? China?

341
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,793
General, test your new product.

342
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,108
Please.

343
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,909
I remember,
China sent me on a mission of peace.

344
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,274
No. To do business?

345
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,956
I wasn't sent
to test the poisonous gas!

346
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,390
I was lucky to get away.

347
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,953
Should I save him?

348
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,951
Why should I risk my life?

349
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,436
He seems to be able to handle them.
I'd better go.

350
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,318
But this is too cowardly. No!

351
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,477
- You're just in time to rescue him.
- I'm used to it.

352
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,116
So I don't owe you any more.

353
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,236
- Let's get out of here!
- Go!

354
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,071
What are you trying to say?

355
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,799
I am the ruler of Kaa Yi City.

356
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,838
The Japanese want to build
a poisonous gas plant.

357
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,798
So for everyone's sake,
I should tell him everything.

358
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,871
Since he is a Chinese spy,

359
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,398
he will be grateful and he will send
a plane to take me somewhere safe.

360
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,029
So you are the Chinese pilot,
sent here to fetch me.

361
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,997
And you... you...

362
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,355
This is nothing to do with you?

363
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,399
Why not?

364
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,550
Defeating Japanese imperialism,

365
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,395
uniting the Chinese people for future
generations, establishing peace.

366
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,198
This has nothing to do with me?

367
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,235
- Is that so?!
- You're nuts.

368
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,995
What? Is it wrong to fight for peace?

369
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,556
Since we all have the same goal,
if you leave, I'll support you...

370
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,039
and we'll leave together.

371
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,917
Go? How?

372
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,274
Your plane.

373
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,271
It's out of fuel.

374
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,559
How come?

375
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,950
On my way here, the Japanese hit
my fuel tank. Now it's empty.

376
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,671
Don't worry. I know where we can find
fuel. The Japanese supply station.

377
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,715
Right.

378
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,792
Then hurry. Go and get it.
We'll be home in no time.

379
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,078
Have a nice trip back.

380
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,879
What do you mean?
Aren't you going with us?

381
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,951
I'm staying here to get rid of Toga.

382
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,508
Once he's dead,
there'll be no more plant.

383
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,478
Don't worry, you go back first.
I'll see you in China.

384
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,109
How are you going to get rid of Toga?
He's got so many men.

385
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,031
If necessary, I'll die with him.

386
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,908
He goes to the supply station
every night. I must take this chance.

387
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,436
Why didn't you say?
We can kill two birds with one stone.

388
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,033
Get the fuel and kill Toga.

389
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,270
I want to make sure we can get away.

390
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,794
Since everybody's agreed,
it's a deal.

391
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,633
- You really would help me?
- We'll help each other.

392
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,154
We help you kill Toga,
you help us get the fuel.

393
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,593
It's settled.

394
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,719
Thank you.

395
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,949
Wait!

396
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,235
You two are lovers.

397
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,997
You two are business partners,
but you will become lovers soon.

398
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,915
But I have nothing.
So tell me, will you desert me?

399
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,231
Don't worry. We're in this together.

400
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,830
And we won't leave anyone behind?

401
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,512
No!

402
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,756
- Miss, what is it?
- Dad said to keep a tighter patrol.

403
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,114
I want to look inside.

404
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,873
Miss, no one is allowed
in without a permit.

405
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,316
- Where's the oil?
- The Lieutenant knows. I'll ask him.

406
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,391
Bring him here, let me ask him.

407
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,989
Lieutenant!

408
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,359
They threatened me...

409
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,557
- Where's the oil?
- In the barrels with the red line.

410
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,760
- I'll get Youda.
- Wait, where's Toga?

411
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,795
He didn't come.

412
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,108
No more talking! Move!

413
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,633
Hurry! Where is he?

414
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,559
We said we wouldn't leave
until we killed Toga.

415
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,598
Don't be such an idiot.
We can move the oil first.

416
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,233
No.

417
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,749
Stop!

418
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,389
Stop or I'll shoot.
We're waiting for Toga.

419
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,153
Why are you pointing a gun
at your friend?

420
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,117
I never looked on you as a friend.

421
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,839
- You...
- Don't move, or I'll shoot.

422
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,309
I'm doing this for everyone's good.

423
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,958
What are you doing?

424
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,191
Leave him alone, he's crazy.
Let's move. You watch him.

425
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,396
I hope you're not as crazy as him.

426
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,678
In that case, let's vote.

427
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,830
- Do you want to go?
- Of course.

428
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,717
- And you?
- I'm following Youda.

429
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,359
How about you?

430
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,273
My job is to take Youda away.

431
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,071
Meeting's over. Let's move.

432
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,396
I said they'd come.

433
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,269
Take them away.

434
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,954
Dad, don't shoot! I was kidnapped!

435
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,029
- Don't move!
- Hold your fire!

436
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,314
Move and I kill her.

437
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,239
Chin-chin!

438
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,755
Hold your fire!

439
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,038
The lighter!

440
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,751
Get in the car!

441
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,034
Get out!

442
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,279
Get in! Hurry, get in!

443
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,232
Get in and go!

444
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,799
Bring him with us.

445
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,949
Go!

446
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,510
An imperial Japanese Officer
will never be taken alive.

447
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,279
Leave him! Come on!

448
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,999
No! I must kill him tonight!

449
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,229
You go!

450
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,148
- I will die with him!
- Don't be a fool.

451
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,119
Come on!

452
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,358
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

453
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,113
Lady, save the love song
for later, OK?

454
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,792
Mind your own business.

455
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,034
- I'll distract them.
- Be careful.

456
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,994
Shit!

457
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,118
- Follow me.
- OK.

458
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,034
I'm free!

459
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,272
We're back!

460
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,758
I've come to rescue you!

461
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,598
We didn't desert you!

462
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,435
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

463
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,912
Hop in!

464
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,118
Jump!

465
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,710
We're finished. We can't go home now.

466
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,552
Are you happy now?

467
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:46,271
The Japanese are here
to develop Kaa Yi City.

468
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,471
We are all in favour of Kaa Yi City.

469
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:55,997
For a better quality of life,

470
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,311
we should give our full support
to the lmperial Japanese Army.

471
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,511
So the Japanese...

472
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,117
Woman, I don't even
know your name yet.

473
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,918
Her name is Ming-ming.

474
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,551
Her grandfather defeated
Dai Do Gow Mei Wu single-handedly.

475
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,350
Ten years ago, your dad was betrayed
by General Geung Cheu Lam's man.

476
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,034
Your dad was killed by the guy
who betrayed him.

477
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,633
Is that true? How do you know?

478
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,473
That's none of your business.
Are you family?

479
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,518
If you want to know the whole story
don't interrupt me.

480
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,878
So then you lived with your granddad
and two years ago got your revenge.

481
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,269
- What happened next?
- Well...

482
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,271
Then she broke up with her boyfriend.

483
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:42,310
But she hates men that wear leather
jackets and silk scarves

484
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,311
and who put on the charm.

485
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,038
That's not true.

486
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,473
You've given in so soon?

487
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,438
She's just trying to embarrass you.

488
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,318
Embarrass me?

489
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,595
Let's see who's got the better life.

490
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,433
- I think I do.
- We'll see.

491
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,354
You were an orphan
so you had to rely on yourself.

492
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,591
Then you became a swindler
and lots of people hated you.

493
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,114
In order to avoid them
you became a wanderer.

494
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,838
- Am I right?
- How did you know?

495
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,150
You wanderers are all the same.

496
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,276
So what's special about you, then?

497
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,078
I'm a bit more special than you.

498
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,152
I've been a spy for five years
and they call me Sky 001.

499
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,356
My real name is Wong Siu-fong.

500
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,510
What a girlie name!

501
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,795
It sounds all right to me.

502
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,314
You're giving in again.

503
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,436
He hasn't finished.

504
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,749
I was adopted by a robber, then...

505
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,559
Then you destroyed
your foster father's gang,

506
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,518
but you felt really bad about it
and you let him go.

507
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,878
Now he's a businessman in Hong Kong,
and you really want to be a doctor.

508
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,997
- Then...
- Then you could become a doctor...

509
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,877
once you were reincarnated.

510
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,159
You were in your boss's good books as
you had destroyed your father's gang.

511
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,676
You went from strength to strength
to become Sky 001 in two years.

512
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:06,554
You don't need to ask me how I know,
I got it all from Granddad.

513
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,837
My granddad wouldn't allow me
to work with a stranger.

514
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,233
Your story is very touching
and yours is legendary.

515
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,673
You're a perfect match.

516
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,558
If you don't die now,
and you have a child one day,

517
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,270
call him Touching Wong if it's a boy
and Legendary Wong if it's a girl.

518
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:28,399
If you have a second child,
call it Wanderer Wong.

519
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,870
It seems as if our chat
is disturbing someone.

520
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,472
...so whoever comes between
the imperial Japanese Army

521
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,028
and Kaa Yi City will be executed!

522
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,951
Don't you all agree?

523
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,275
Now I know you're so reasonable,
I've decided to betray them.

524
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,079
I'll let you in on
some secret information.

525
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,274
The secret news is...

526
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,830
Come on.

527
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,239
What secret?

528
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,198
You have foul breath,
did you just eat shit?

529
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,516
I want to find Youda.

530
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,035
Youda!

531
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,749
General Toga.

532
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,910
The execution starts in ten minutes.

533
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,434
Memorise it
and say it at the execution.

534
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:41,753
I, Youda, ruler of Kaa Yi City,
sentence these three people to death

535
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,150
because they sabotaged
the order of United East Asia.

536
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,834
Loyalty to the
Imperial Japanese Empire.

537
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,512
Bullshit!

538
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:03,154
I, Youda, ruler of Kaa Yi City,
sentence these three people to death.

539
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,671
Chin-chin, Chin-chin.

540
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,518
Youda.

541
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,194
Everything's OK.
You will be well soon.

542
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,679
What about the others?

543
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,238
Gone, all gone.

544
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,719
Why?

545
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,599
- I set them free.
- The Japanese agreed?

546
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,159
Of course not, so I gave them hell.

547
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,754
I stood up and said to them...

548
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,230
I am the ruler of Kaa Yi,
I order you to set them free.

549
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,151
If you don't,
I'll kick you all out.

550
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,277
The Japanese were scared shitless,
and set them free.

551
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,554
Really?

552
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,112
I've never lied to you, have I?

553
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,913
They are all good people.
They deserve to be happy.

554
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,038
You'd better rest
and not think about this.

555
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,909
I, Youda, ruler of Kaa Yi City,
sentence these three people to death

556
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,072
because they sabotaged
the order of the United East Asia.

557
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,149
Imperial Japan...

558
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,194
You can't make me do it!

559
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,033
They injured your daughter!
Don't you have feelings?

560
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,749
The Japanese are armed to the teeth,
what can we do?

561
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,990
I don't care! I want to rescue them.

562
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,719
You are risking your own life.

563
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,679
Even if you want to do this, you
still cannot save them, so why do it?

564
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,999
If they were really your friends,
they wouldn't want you to die.

565
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,874
My Lord, you have to do this.

566
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,391
Executioners, get ready!

567
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,717
My Lord, please be ready.

568
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,036
I, Youda, ruler of Kaa Yi City,

569
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,077
sentence these three people...

570
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,793
to be set free.

571
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,795
Release them!

572
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:08,553
Whoever sabotaged relations between
Kaa Yi and the imperial Japanese

573
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,471
is committing a severe crime.

574
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:15,190
Even though Youda is your ruler,
he is as guilty as the others.

575
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,032
Every man should be equal.

576
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,192
So in order to preserve fairness
and justice,

577
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,397
I sentence Youda to death
along with the others.

578
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,916
Am I a friend or what?

579
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,555
One...

580
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,875
Two...

581
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,358
Three...

582
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,152
You cannot kill Youda!

583
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,068
Ready!

584
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,475
One, two...

585
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,154
No! You can't kill Youda!

586
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,392
- No!
- One...

587
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,359
- No! You cannot kill Youda!
- Chin-chin!

588
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,113
You can't kill them, you can't!

589
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,952
You can't kill them!

590
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,195
Stop!

591
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,474
Dad!

592
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,115
Chin-chin!

593
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,472
No more delays.

594
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,316
Ready, take aim...

595
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,274
One...

596
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,874
Fire!

597
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,675
Fire!

598
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,754
Fire!

599
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,914
Rescue our ruler!

600
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,078
Quick! Quick!

601
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,879
Quick!

602
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,994
How can you fight the Japanese
with this?

603
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:26,312
Maybe they won't come back.

604
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,118
I want to avenge my father's death.

605
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:32,398
They'll be back.
If you're afraid, leave now.

606
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,959
I'm not that kind of person.

607
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,679
I'm afraid they might make mincemeat
of you.

608
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,990
Then we can eat mincemeat tomorrow.

609
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,036
Youda, please give the order.

610
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,917
OK, I'll summon everyone to the city.

611
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,428
I...

612
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,636
ruler of Kaa Yi City,

613
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:58,796
Youda, now call for full
force protection of our city.

614
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,189
- This is war!
- War!

615
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,593
War! War! War...

616
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,234
You're dead!

617
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,432
War!

618
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,273
Fire!

619
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,789
Get ready!

620
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,076
- You stay here, I have to go.
- OK.

621
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,353
Forward!

622
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,551
Quick, they're coming!

623
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,755
One, two, three, fire!

624
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,273
Put it there... fire!

625
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,114
Knock the gate down!

626
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,195
Son of a bitch!

627
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,679
Son of a bitch!

628
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,391
They're bombing the gate! Jump!

629
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,112
Find them!

630
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,159
Spread out!

631
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,634
- Forward!
- Forward!

632
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,639
You traitor!

633
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,838
- No sign of them, sir.
- Continue the search!

634
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,909
Yes, sir.

635
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,193
Lieutenant, your orders?

636
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,510
What the hell is going on? Damn it!

637
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,512
You son of a bitch!

638
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,794
Throw them!

639
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,632
Everyone, retreat! Quick, hurry up!

640
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,199
Come on, come on!

641
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,232
Faster!

642
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,079
Not a bad watch.

643
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,154
What are you doing?

644
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,958
Sorry, sir.

645
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,155
If you people have any guts,
come get me!

646
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:31,875
Kill him!

647
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,634
Come and get me!

648
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,910
Everyone stop!

649
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,272
They're all dead!

650
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,476
Move that body out of the way.

651
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,594
Come out.

652
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,951
- Are they all dead?
- Yes.

653
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,837
Retreat.

654
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,675
Move.

655
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,753
Watch out!

656
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,000
General, it's too much,
we can't continue.

657
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,914
As an officer,
you should set a good example.

658
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,558
Follow me.

659
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,513
Take these guns.

660
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,432
- How's it going?
- Fine.

661
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,549
Let me.

662
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,197
Put down your weapons
and your families will be OK.

663
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,638
Mum! Mum!

664
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,679
Siu-bo!

665
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,520
Surrender now
or more people will die.

666
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,796
I surrender, I surrender.
Don't kill my people.

667
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,269
Put down your weapons.

668
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,958
OK?

669
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,520
Youda, don't surrender!

670
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,548
Duck!

671
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,389
I want to kill him!

672
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,669
Don't, don't!
Two wrongs don't make a right.

673
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,918
You can go now, but tell your people
that we're a peaceful race.

674
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:25,798
The invader always loses.

675
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,710
Everyone, I've got something to say.

676
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,830
Reinforcements are on their way.

677
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,308
This time we are going to succeed.

678
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,111
If you continue resisting,
you will lose.

679
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,509
But I have a solution.

680
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,754
Your orders, sir.

681
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,478
What happened?

682
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,316
- We did our best but...
- Nonsense! What really happened?

683
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,518
They made a strong stand and set fire
to the city to try and wipe us out.

684
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,230
Such a fine city going up in smoke.

685
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,039
What a pity.

686
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,588
I'd rather see this
than my people suffer.

687
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,558
As long as there are people,
we can build a new city.

688
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:34,713
Without this city, there's nowhere
for their gas plant. I need a break.

689
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,156
Do you have time for a break?
I'll take you out in my aeroplane.

690
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,198
Are you flying to China?

691
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,871
I really want to go back home.

692
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,873
Sorry, I've only got room for two.

693
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,075
Really?

694
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:54,277
But there's a cargo compartment,
if you don't mind.

695
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,794
I don't mind. I don't mind at all!

696
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,517
I really don't mind.

697
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:04,311
This city is practically useless!
Retreat.

698
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,152
Yes, sir!
