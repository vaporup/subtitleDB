1
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,542
In the early Ching Dynasty,

2
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,741
Emperor "Ti-chao" suddenly fell ill,

3
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:48,443
And would die any time

4
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:51,145
It is believed that there is
a strange flower on Mount "Shin Fung"

5
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:53,222
It blooms every twenty years

6
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:55,951
This flower can bring
a dying man back to life,

7
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:57,321
change white hair into black

8
00:01:57,962 --> 00:02:01,125
The court decided to send people
to the mountain to look for this flower

9
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,632
Mount "Shin Fung"

10
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:12,595
I, Chief Yeh Li Nieh Tang of Ching,
have come specially

11
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:14,962
to visit you Mr. Cho of Wu Tang

12
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:26,413
His majesty is now indisposed

13
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:28,848
They say your flower can bring...

14
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:30,646
a dying man back to life

15
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,586
What time is it now?

16
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:38,824
Still 4 hours before the blossom

17
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:41,326
I mean the year?

18
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:44,899
It's now exactly 10 years
since the foundation of Ching

19
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:52,064
Ten years

20
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:57,345
You may leave!

21
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:04,588
Sir, only if your flower
can revive His Majesty,

22
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:07,249
the Court will reward you handsomely

23
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:12,088
This flower is not for you

24
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:15,161
Cho Yi-hang, hear what our General said?

25
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:49,429
Who ranks higher than His Majesty?

26
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:02,908
A woman, in my eyes

27
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:07,249
I waited for her for a decade

28
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:11,579
I wonder if she knew

29
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:33,233
my master was the Chief
of the 8 clans in Chung Yuan,

30
00:05:33,777 --> 00:05:35,005
and Priest Tzu Yang of Wu Tang

31
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,045
He often told me...

32
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:39,407
about the underworld
love-hate relationship

33
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:43,143
In his words, all the clans are bad

34
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:44,645
except the 8 big clans

35
00:05:46,457 --> 00:05:48,288
Yi-hang, remember

36
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:51,759
there's always controversy
between good and evil

37
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:53,387
Yes, master

38
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:57,198
I answered him the same always

39
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:01,097
Have you mastered Moon-Breaking sword...

40
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:02,472
I taught you?

41
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,536
Yes, completely

42
00:06:14,118 --> 00:06:15,085
Yi-hang

43
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:23,050
Concentrate by combining heart
and sword into one

44
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:24,622
Draw!

45
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:39,876
The sword protects the body
from being soiled by petals

46
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,334
Heart-piercing stab!

47
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:19,475
Master, I've already come up
to such a level

48
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,050
Can I have a few days' rest now?

49
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,784
Learning is unlimited

50
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,123
Continue if you wish to become
the future Chief of the swordplay world

51
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,293
In fact, I've never cherished
such an ambition

52
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,096
But, occasionally...

53
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,325
I resort to chivalrous acts!

54
00:07:54,818 --> 00:07:57,082
I should've let you be captured
by those rascals

55
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:58,350
To save you,

56
00:07:58,622 --> 00:08:00,556
I don't now even know where I am

57
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,725
Oh, no,
Master will reprimand me for sure

58
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:06,424
I've been afraid of 2 things
since childhood

59
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:09,232
Thunderbolt and...

60
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:28,280
Hsiao Yang,
time for you to repay a favor now

61
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:34,823
I'm leaving. Take care!

62
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,329
Help...

63
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:52,935
Master, help, master...

64
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:56,369
Sister, brother, help!

65
00:08:58,215 --> 00:08:59,580
Uncle Pai Yun, help!

66
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:02,443
Desperate!

67
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,756
Help! I don't want to die! Help...

68
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:14,294
Master, help me... master, help me...

69
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:31,404
I can't believe it
There're really miracles in this world

70
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:39,189
At that moment, I really wanted
to get to her and say "thanks"

71
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:43,620
Have a clearer look at her face

72
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:51,164
But...

73
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,928
I was really too tired

74
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,484
When I knew him,

75
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:13,082
he was only an ordinary officer

76
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:15,950
Unexpectedly,
he later became Gen Wu San-kuei

77
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:19,491
who changed the history of Chung Yuan

78
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:25,993
This time you're lucky

79
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:29,738
Next time I'm not sure
if you'd be as lucky

80
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:35,907
I'm sober while the others are all drunk
Come on!

81
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:40,047
Come again if you've the nerve!

82
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:48,182
I enjoy company with him

83
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:51,292
because I can do anything prohibited
by Master

84
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:52,155
Come on!

85
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:02,030
Yi-hang

86
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:09,510
Fear not accusations
from a thousand fingers

87
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,042
if you're innocent

88
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:17,653
A life under others' influence

89
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:21,120
means no life

90
00:11:22,426 --> 00:11:24,587
It's as good as dead!

91
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:32,391
Have you grasped what I said?

92
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,502
Never knew a furious man...

93
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:43,345
could be so kind-hearted

94
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:45,739
Sometimes I doubt if he was nice to me

95
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:47,411
only because...

96
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:48,844
I'm an orphan!

97
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:50,412
Cho Yi-hang

98
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:54,313
You stole a sheep from farmer
Ho Tor-niu's home 1-17

99
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:57,153
Do you plead guilty or not?

100
00:11:57,527 --> 00:11:58,425
He stole my sheep and

101
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:01,196
gave me a swollen face. Look

102
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:04,627
I meant to save it...

103
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,268
from getting butchered

104
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,198
Master told us to be chivalrous

105
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,339
And they wouldn't
even let go a small sheep

106
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:14,339
Do you plead guilty to hurting Tor-niu?

107
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:16,638
He called me beast and creep

108
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:18,712
I should've fed him with dog shit

109
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:23,781
What's so funny?

110
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:28,820
Chief, as a disciple of Wu Tang and

111
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:30,254
an heir to Chief, what Cho Yi-hang did

112
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,791
is a disgrace to the clan and

113
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:35,323
Wu Tang's reputation

114
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:38,899
In fact, Uncle Pai Yun is not bad,

115
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:40,697
but he's overambitious

116
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:42,567
He wants to have his daughter succeed...

117
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:45,435
as the Chief against tradition

118
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:48,335
So I'm his eyesore

119
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:51,171
Calligraphy like swordplay

120
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:53,676
calls for stamina

121
00:12:54,217 --> 00:12:55,912
He's my brother Lu Hsing-cheng

122
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,112
For any clans...

123
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:01,220
stamina comes
from the brush and strength

124
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:03,224
Practice energy with spirit

125
00:13:03,794 --> 00:13:05,455
Practice energy with spirit

126
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:07,026
Move the brush with energy

127
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:08,630
Move the brush with energy

128
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,091
Waist more erect than brush

129
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:11,323
Waist more erect than brush

130
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:12,459
Raise wrist

131
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:13,330
Raise wrist

132
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:14,830
Arm like a dragon

133
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:16,503
Arm like a dragon

134
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:18,374
Sister is late

135
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:19,509
Sorry, dad!

136
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:21,875
Sit down now!

137
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:24,202
Practice calligraphy now

138
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:29,313
Cho Yi-hang, copy 500 times
to atone for your mistake

139
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:30,653
I already knew it

140
00:13:37,194 --> 00:13:39,185
Never be perverted by poverty

141
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:41,329
She's my sister Ho Lu-hua

142
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,395
Didn't you notice she often smiled at me

143
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:49,002
And she passed food for me
to eat to cheer me

144
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:51,001
It means however rich you're,

145
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:54,200
you must restrain yourself

146
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:57,743
Yield not to prowess

147
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:01,842
It means no submission
to powerful influence

148
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:03,449
Understand?

149
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:15,592
Cho Yi-hang, don't abandon yourself

150
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,198
only because the Chief spoils you

151
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:20,463
Look at them, writing without eating

152
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:21,831
You eating buns here?

153
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:26,737
Follow your sister: still as a virgin,
crafty as a rabbit

154
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:30,469
You're carefree and an idle eater

155
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:34,578
I know sister is clever

156
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:38,579
The brothers are all at puberty

157
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:45,083
You, an elder brother,
are naughty yourself

158
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:47,726
You frolicked while learning

159
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:49,087
Do you admit guilty?

160
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,493
And in Feb you came personally down...

161
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:54,530
to kill Kaifeng constable
Fang Tien-cheng

162
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:55,701
Do you plead guilty or not?

163
00:14:58,542 --> 00:14:59,167
No

164
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:05,311
Uncle Pai Yun, I stabbed him once only

165
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:06,675
Why call it "Kill"?

166
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,478
What manner is that?

167
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:09,242
Right

168
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:10,579
What's the penalty
for a Wu Tang disciple?

169
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:11,584
Isn't it agains propriety?

170
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:18,292
You admit everything then?

171
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:21,293
I admitted I killed a lackey, but...

172
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:23,592
With the proof here,
don't argue any more

173
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:25,459
I have nothing to say now

174
00:15:26,303 --> 00:15:28,032
But that lousy mandarin's folks do!

175
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:34,300
Uncle

176
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:36,642
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't misunderstand swordsman Cho

177
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,747
My son was to blame and he deserved it

178
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:40,142
Yes! Yes!
Luckily swordsman Cho helped me

179
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:42,717
Otherwise,
that bastard would've raped me

180
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:44,615
He even tried to kill my daughter!

181
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:46,989
Thank you swordsman Cho for your help
Thanks...

182
00:15:47,157 --> 00:15:47,851
Get up...

183
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:49,487
Silence in the palace

184
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:51,253
Thank you...

185
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:55,761
Pai Yun, what wrong did my pupil do

186
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:58,992
to have troubled the presence
of you 8 elders?

187
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:01,737
In the name of the Chief's adopted pupil

188
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:04,806
Cho ran rougshod and
bullied other clans' pupils

189
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,703
With proof and the witnesses here,
he can't deny it

190
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,179
Yi-hang, what have you to say?

191
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:22,755
Chief, they're the descendants
of the 6 big clans

192
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,727
If I alone could beat them all 6,

193
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:26,726
it means Wu Tang's more powerful
in martial arts

194
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:29,161
On this score I admit!

195
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:30,692
Shut up!

196
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:34,766
Brother has hit the nail on the head!

197
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:35,695
Quiet!

198
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:39,440
Ma Yu of Kung Tung,

199
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:40,665
did Cho injure you?

200
00:16:41,344 --> 00:16:44,279
No, overexercise brought me this

201
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:46,238
And you, Liu Cheng of Tien Chuang?

202
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,539
How did you get your wound?

203
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:50,945
I injured myself while playing!

204
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:52,346
How do you explain your wounds?

205
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:53,520
I dropped into the well
getting water out of it!

206
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,954
I was pursued by a tiger!

207
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:56,853
I was only joking

208
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:59,127
Get down! All stuff and nonsense!

209
00:16:59,329 --> 00:16:59,886
You!

210
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:03,799
I wounded him because he wouldn't pay
at Wan Chun brothel

211
00:17:04,935 --> 00:17:05,663
You

212
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:08,464
You hogged others' farmland in
conspiracy with bureaucracy, didn't you?

213
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:10,564
And you

214
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:12,866
You bullied a scholar
with your martial arts...

215
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:13,634
Cho Yi-hang!

216
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,239
Yes!

217
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:17,209
You came down
without the master's permission

218
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:19,478
Now face the Buddha (in the palace)
and repent

219
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:22,081
without drinking for 3 days

220
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:22,978
Yes!

221
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:13,693
Aren't you tired of this?

222
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,201
Always putting on airs!

223
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:23,077
You see me
whenever you think of me, right?

224
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:27,780
Hungry? Let me get you something to eat

225
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:29,108
Thank you

226
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:34,613
So you don't mind
even such coarse food as buns!

227
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:36,683
They're nice! Eat!

228
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:39,517
Cho...

229
00:18:39,796 --> 00:18:41,093
Cho,

230
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:44,659
we didn't mean to testify
against you this morning

231
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:46,368
Priest Pai Yun forced us to!

232
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:47,696
Yes...

233
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:49,170
Would you bear us grudge?

234
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:52,603
No, I forgot everything already!

235
00:18:52,776 --> 00:18:54,243
Thank you...

236
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:55,806
Next time remember to pay at the brothel

237
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:56,775
Yes...

238
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,379
Cho, try red kaoliang of Shansi

239
00:18:58,615 --> 00:18:59,445
Good

240
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:00,275
Cut it out!

241
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,382
Can't you see...

242
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:04,247
he's carrying sister's 2 big buns?

243
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:06,318
Don't you know
this is the palace of Wu Tang?

244
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:08,116
Wine and meat, you may ruin me! Get out!

245
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,121
Get out quick!

246
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:10,125
What about me?

247
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:10,816
You, too!

248
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:13,962
I'll go back to retire

249
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,697
You stay to sleep with brother

250
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,027
What are you doing?

251
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:23,802
This jade heirloom came from my dad

252
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,467
Keep it and

253
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,173
promise not to break it

254
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:35,446
Stay!

255
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:38,951
What are you doing?

256
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:41,053
I need it

257
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:42,884
Help me to hold on first

258
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:47,655
Brother!

259
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:54,795
Right, it's now time for us to

260
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:56,965
serve our country

261
00:19:57,607 --> 00:19:59,632
Kill rascals and remove evils! Kill!

262
00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:00,465
Yes!

263
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:13,019
Brother!

264
00:20:13,823 --> 00:20:15,518
Stealing military supplies is
a serious crime. You may get beheaded!

265
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,489
People in our tribe get beheaded
for plucking the weed only!

266
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:18,887
Dying of struggle is better than
starving to death

267
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:20,853
Come here. There's something to eat

268
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:26,526
Don't fight! Everybody has a share!

269
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:30,698
Let me do it if you can't

270
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:26,586
How dare you lay hands
on the Ming Court's provisions?

271
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:27,457
Kill!

272
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:30,761
Darling, are you alright?

273
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:34,668
I can't hold on. I must deliver

274
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:38,533
Don't...!

275
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:43,873
Darling, come out quick!

276
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,167
Kill these beggars!

277
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:22,384
I'll kill you, demon

278
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,179
I'll chop you to 8 pieces

279
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:35,563
Exactly 8 pieces

280
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,542
Run quick!

281
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:00,546
Darling, bear with it

282
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:02,055
Darling, it hurts badly!

283
00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:06,185
Darling, bear with it

284
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,165
I must deliver

285
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:15,503
There's light in front
Let's go and seek help. Come quick!

286
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,705
No one is around

287
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:19,599
It hurts badly!

288
00:23:20,376 --> 00:23:23,345
Swordsman, we didn't steal!
Don't kill us!

289
00:23:25,348 --> 00:23:26,144
I didn't steal! Don't kill us!

290
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:28,207
Darling...

291
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,078
Darling, are you alright?

292
00:23:32,755 --> 00:23:34,313
Swordsman, can you deliver?

293
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,514
Please help us

294
00:23:35,692 --> 00:23:36,249
To help you deliver?

295
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,552
To help us deliver, we beg you!

296
00:23:40,396 --> 00:23:41,624
Darling bear with it

297
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:45,124
Darling, what now?

298
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:49,136
Can you deliver? Please do us a favor

299
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:55,670
Darling, we've got help!

300
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,037
Darling, harder!

301
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:01,679
Harder, harder, darling!

302
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:02,749
Darling!

303
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:09,153
Darling...

304
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:37,342
Darling, we have gone
through the most difficult times,

305
00:24:38,221 --> 00:24:41,657
why do you leave us at this moment?

306
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:46,386
Don't be sad!

307
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,960
A son has hope

308
00:24:53,503 --> 00:24:57,439
Keep it to run a small business. Come

309
00:24:57,807 --> 00:24:58,774
Get out of here!

310
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:02,339
Swordsman! Thank you, swordsman!

311
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:41,234
Who are you?

312
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:43,173
Why are you following me?

313
00:26:44,547 --> 00:26:45,172
Miss,

314
00:26:45,882 --> 00:26:47,474
you bring us closer yourself

315
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:59,891
Right! It's better to keep
a distance between us

316
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:02,897
Whoever sees me shall be blinded!

317
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,193
Do I have to perish
having seen your whole body?

318
00:27:16,746 --> 00:27:19,408
Miss, control your temper!

319
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:41,302
Oh, I forgot to tell you I'm Cho Yi-hang

320
00:28:32,088 --> 00:28:41,292
Chief of the cult, killing ensures peace

321
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:02,413
Today

322
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:10,750
Our chief bodyguard sent an Army
to wipe out many lackeys

323
00:29:12,595 --> 00:29:14,324
We want to let them know

324
00:29:14,997 --> 00:29:19,661
that our tribesmen are not ants...
under their soles

325
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:26,938
The chief bodyguard frightens demons
through blood practice

326
00:29:34,183 --> 00:29:36,413
Those old people of Chung Yuan's 8 clans

327
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:39,946
are too old even to hold a sword

328
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,415
All they know is to pay lip service only

329
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,664
They pay lip service
to bewitch the masses

330
00:29:53,936 --> 00:29:55,767
They not only plan to unite Chung Yuan

331
00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:58,633
but to dig out our ancestors' graves

332
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,149
What a nuisance

333
00:30:15,024 --> 00:30:16,184
Only if...

334
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:19,985
we wipe out those old leaders,

335
00:30:21,097 --> 00:30:25,693
the 8 clans of Chung Yuan
will be dissolved

336
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:34,100
Wipe out the beasts!
Increase my longevity

337
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:03,133
Why is it so icy the whole night?

338
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:20,487
We've been hiding 20 years
waiting for this day!

339
00:31:21,223 --> 00:31:24,420
Now is the time to return a favor

340
00:31:24,693 --> 00:31:26,786
Kill them for me!

341
00:32:00,463 --> 00:32:03,728
Your heart's beating hard!

342
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,066
Let me feel it

343
00:32:07,203 --> 00:32:08,261
Have you finished ordering?

344
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:16,706
What's so funny?

345
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,305
Buddy, you look so pitiable!

346
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:25,583
Having hardened her wings,
you've no right to touch them!

347
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:31,615
True love is mutual

348
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,253
I'll wait for you!

349
00:32:34,697 --> 00:32:37,530
Right, compulsory love has no happiness

350
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:40,362
Right, compulsory love has no happiness

351
00:32:48,644 --> 00:32:49,406
Priest Tzu Yang,

352
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:52,144
the cult is getting more powerful
in Manchuria

353
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:54,541
It may menace the safety
of the people of Ming

354
00:32:55,217 --> 00:32:57,412
As the Chief of 8 clans,

355
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:59,415
you should contribute some effort!

356
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:02,856
Chi Wu-shuang appears again

357
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:07,686
The underworld is again rife
with witchcraft

358
00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:11,692
We must wipe out the cult

359
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:13,232
before it come to power

360
00:33:13,636 --> 00:33:14,728
They're not so easy to wipe out!

361
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:17,336
I hear they're quite powerful
in martial arts

362
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,334
Chief,

363
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:21,335
we shouldn't have
let that traitor go that year

364
00:33:22,111 --> 00:33:24,739
No point mentioning the past!

365
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:28,550
We must decide immediately
which clan will lead the expedition

366
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:30,046
What's your opinion?

367
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:33,250
As the Chief of 8 clans,

368
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:35,287
Wu Tang should do!

369
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:36,582
Right

370
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:37,257
Right you are

371
00:33:38,527 --> 00:33:39,050
Hsin Cheng

372
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:40,253
Why, master?

373
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:41,723
Where's Yi-hang?

374
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:46,258
Where have you been?

375
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,836
Master is meeting with the 7 clans
on how to cope with the cult

376
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:51,468
Halt! What about the jade I gave you?

377
00:33:52,308 --> 00:33:53,400
Why ask me about it now?

378
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,002
Where's the jade?

379
00:34:08,157 --> 00:34:09,818
Why did you give it to someone else?

380
00:34:11,694 --> 00:34:13,321
I feel he needs it more than I do

381
00:34:14,296 --> 00:34:16,821
I'll kill him. So you don't need him

382
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:18,858
Brother, master wants you

383
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:36,510
Sorry, Chief, I'm late!

384
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:40,979
Yi-hang, the 8 clans have decided
to send troops to suppress the cult

385
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,757
and you'll be in command

386
00:34:43,926 --> 00:34:47,623
Chief, this is a herculean task

387
00:34:48,697 --> 00:34:49,823
I'm afraid I'm not equal to it

388
00:34:52,201 --> 00:34:53,463
Wu Tang is full of personalities

389
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:56,669
Why have you only him in mind, Chief?

390
00:34:57,673 --> 00:34:58,867
Have you got a better choice?

391
00:34:59,942 --> 00:35:00,840
I venture to suggest

392
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,674
my daughter Lu-hua...

393
00:35:02,878 --> 00:35:04,573
as the best choice

394
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:07,044
Right

395
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:11,109
Sister is brilliant and
a fast swordswoman

396
00:35:12,187 --> 00:35:14,849
None's better suited than her
as the commander

397
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:18,249
Oh, no, it's against the rule

398
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:19,856
Do you agree?

399
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:20,560
Right!

400
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:21,058
What's your opinion?

401
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:21,753
Chief,

402
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,329
how can a female undertake
such a heavy assignment?

403
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:24,527
Yi-hang

404
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,562
A military order is as rigid as a
mountain and you can't go against rules

405
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,167
You command the 8 clans' pupils...

406
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:30,530
with Lu-hua as your side

407
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,832
Set out by night

408
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:34,770
Your order is understood

409
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:50,052
Yi-hang, I've covered you up
in the presence of the 8 clans

410
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:52,923
Why go against me?

411
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:57,062
Master, master!

412
00:35:57,232 --> 00:35:58,199
Listen

413
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:03,368
I spent years' efforts
teaching you kung fu,

414
00:36:04,173 --> 00:36:06,664
hoping you may succeed me...

415
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:09,904
as the Chief of the 8 clans...

416
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,238
after my death

417
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:15,043
I know that as the Chief
to lead the masses

418
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:18,185
I must do many things against my will

419
00:36:18,754 --> 00:36:19,550
Right!

420
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:26,588
So a kind heart is a defect

421
00:36:29,631 --> 00:36:31,895
Kind heart?

422
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:39,666
Listen, if some day

423
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:41,966
Chi Wu-shuang wants to suppress Wu Tang,

424
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:45,439
can you ask her to spare us?

425
00:36:47,616 --> 00:36:50,312
And if some day

426
00:36:50,886 --> 00:36:55,016
we unite Chung Yuan and
must kill all hans,

427
00:36:55,591 --> 00:37:00,119
can you use your heart to move them?

428
00:37:02,297 --> 00:37:04,629
This is the so-called underworld rule

429
00:37:06,468 --> 00:37:09,028
So you have no choice

430
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:13,538
Yes, I do

431
00:37:16,178 --> 00:37:17,440
I may quit the underworld

432
00:37:31,693 --> 00:37:32,955
Quit the underworld?

433
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:37,089
Easily said than done

434
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:38,295
Listen,

435
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:42,763
what else can you do besides kung fu?

436
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:46,066
Returning home to till the land?

437
00:37:50,712 --> 00:37:52,145
The Chief himself has promised to

438
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:54,446
relinquish his post to you

439
00:37:57,386 --> 00:38:00,844
All the 8 clans
have been eyeing this post

440
00:38:02,357 --> 00:38:05,349
You take no interest, but I do

441
00:38:06,628 --> 00:38:07,492
Child,

442
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:10,596
take a longer sight

443
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:14,429
If you really become the Chief,

444
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,233
we can join forces

445
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,675
Quite possibly we may even change
Ming's territory

446
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,677
General, we've again caught
some foreign spies

447
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:30,776
Chop!

448
00:38:31,086 --> 00:38:31,677
Yes! Chop!

449
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:34,379
We're innocent...

450
00:38:35,257 --> 00:38:36,724
Uncle Kuei, why did you...

451
00:38:38,227 --> 00:38:39,125
Given present circumstances,

452
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:41,486
killing 100 wrongly is
better than letting one go

453
00:38:42,497 --> 00:38:44,226
The cult tries to cover
the eyes and ears of the world and

454
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,132
the Manchus are getting
increasingly rampant

455
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,971
Our duty as military men is
to protect the territory

456
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:53,635
and kill them all

457
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:03,540
Yi-hang, remember,
heroes make the times!

458
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:11,515
Why is brother still not here?

459
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,164
Let's not wait for Yi-hang any more

460
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:21,025
Better plan how to deploy...

461
00:39:21,203 --> 00:39:22,067
to cope with the cult

462
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,795
But Chi Wu-shuang's advance
in martial arts

463
00:39:23,972 --> 00:39:25,667
and we're in the dark
about the cult's surroundings

464
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,570
Such a move is too dangerous

465
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:29,940
Let Kung Tung clan back out...

466
00:39:30,112 --> 00:39:31,272
if it prefers

467
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:34,676
I don't think our 7-clan coalition...

468
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,545
can't cope with Wu-shuang

469
00:39:37,152 --> 00:39:38,050
And the wolf girl?

470
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:41,215
And we have Wu Tang's
72 cyclical swords

471
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,152
And Hua Shan clan's...

472
00:39:42,324 --> 00:39:42,915
7 Fatal Arrays

473
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:44,581
Shut up, I know

474
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,988
And O-Mei clan's dragon-tiger
conquering skills

475
00:39:46,161 --> 00:39:48,891
And Kun Lun's fantastic
King Kong swordplay

476
00:39:49,197 --> 00:39:51,859
If we stab her unawares

477
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,626
Let alone a wolf girl,
even a dragon girl

478
00:39:54,803 --> 00:39:57,203
may be chopped by us... into minces

479
00:40:11,853 --> 00:40:13,411
Elders

480
00:40:16,491 --> 00:40:17,822
Let me ask you a question

481
00:40:20,562 --> 00:40:22,154
Foreign tribes bear us on grudge

482
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:25,330
Why kill them?

483
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:41,678
Brother

484
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,009
You want to kill?

485
00:40:48,557 --> 00:40:49,489
Let me ask you

486
00:40:52,461 --> 00:40:54,190
Have you heard of the sounds of a sword

487
00:40:54,363 --> 00:40:57,855
chopped on human body or bones?

488
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:06,371
Cho Yi-hang,
as the commander of the 8 clans

489
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:08,133
you speak baldy to disrupt
the Army morale

490
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:16,874
You were ambitious to spread your name

491
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:20,186
So you're most suited...

492
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:21,883
for the commander post

493
00:41:37,672 --> 00:41:41,733
Patrolling at this late hour?
It's freezing!

494
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:46,879
Something in front must be wrong

495
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:49,806
Nobody!

496
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:51,475
Are you drunk? Only a tree!

497
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:54,522
Brother...

498
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:57,385
Wake up, brother

499
00:41:58,393 --> 00:41:59,951
Sister, isn't it against the rule?

500
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:02,522
He's against the rule

501
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:04,628
He got drunk in defiance of discipline

502
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:06,466
and even forsook his emblem

503
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:09,368
How is he to answer to master
on return to Wu Tang?

504
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:11,597
Men of the cult are here!

505
00:42:12,307 --> 00:42:12,932
Where are they?

506
00:42:13,175 --> 00:42:13,573
Here

507
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:14,231
Be alert!

508
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:27,213
Form an array

509
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,417
Bleeding, I'll die for sure

510
00:42:56,585 --> 00:42:57,381
Only a bruise!

511
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:33,779
Stop!

512
00:43:35,457 --> 00:43:37,391
Are you crazy? I'm not an enemy

513
00:44:15,664 --> 00:44:16,631
Miss

514
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:18,860
Know me?

515
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,629
In the ancient city,

516
00:44:22,437 --> 00:44:24,530
I must kill you, a Chung Yuan native

517
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:31,977
Come on

518
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:56,700
Cho Yi-hang

519
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:08,577
Don't move

520
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:12,217
Don't blame me

521
00:45:12,821 --> 00:45:14,812
It would be too late
if I didn't help you now

522
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:06,596
In my view

523
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:10,403
he may have been bewitched by that witch

524
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:12,073
I don't think it's as simple as that

525
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:15,978
That witch even spared his life

526
00:46:16,484 --> 00:46:17,382
and followed him

527
00:46:19,287 --> 00:46:20,276
They exchanged glances and

528
00:46:20,455 --> 00:46:21,820
might have been intimate

529
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,854
Shut up!

530
00:46:23,858 --> 00:46:26,190
How can one bewitched by a wolf girl

531
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:30,227
command Chung Yuan to fight foreigners?

532
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:34,497
Brother, you'd better reconsider...

533
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:36,569
a more suitable candidate

534
00:46:36,771 --> 00:46:39,535
Shut up! Bring him back quickly

535
00:46:39,741 --> 00:46:41,333
and let him explain to me personally

536
00:47:03,498 --> 00:47:06,331
Brother, don't! Retire now!

537
00:47:10,338 --> 00:47:13,273
Girls? I can give you 100...

538
00:47:13,675 --> 00:47:15,233
much better than she?

539
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,242
No, I want her!

540
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,778
Are you out of your mind?

541
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:25,115
That bitch helped us
kill so many Chung Yuan men

542
00:47:26,254 --> 00:47:27,448
Can she get away?

543
00:47:29,457 --> 00:47:31,516
I must let her know...

544
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,788
she brought me the agony

545
00:47:36,097 --> 00:47:37,291
Any agony can't compare
to our expulsion...

546
00:47:37,532 --> 00:47:40,194
by that old Tzu Yang traitor
20 years ago

547
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:50,277
Chi Wu-shuang

548
00:47:50,779 --> 00:47:52,337
You two got twisted...

549
00:47:52,714 --> 00:47:54,272
by the cult

550
00:47:55,049 --> 00:47:56,710
and brought mess
to the Chung Yuan swordplay world

551
00:47:57,118 --> 00:47:58,346
Expelling your family
without killing you...

552
00:47:58,553 --> 00:47:59,611
you're lucky

553
00:48:00,288 --> 00:48:01,915
Kill them...

554
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,388
Quiet, chiefs!

555
00:48:06,194 --> 00:48:09,561
These 2 rats are much condemned
for their crime

556
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:13,499
But as an orthodox clan,
we mustn't go too far

557
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:17,097
Chi Wu-shuang, we'll give you a chance

558
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:20,703
As of today,
don't ever set foot on Chung Yuan

559
00:48:30,051 --> 00:48:34,351
Brother, we shouldn't cherish
any feeling for anyone

560
00:48:36,024 --> 00:48:40,358
We must hate him, control him

561
00:48:41,996 --> 00:48:43,588
We adopted the wolf girl to

562
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:46,461
utilize her to kill...

563
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:48,534
all Chung Yuan scoundrels only

564
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,838
She's merely our killing instrument

565
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:55,568
Remember that, understand?

566
00:48:55,844 --> 00:48:57,971
Only we've friends
you can't afford to lose

567
00:48:58,146 --> 00:48:59,579
Get out!

568
00:49:00,582 --> 00:49:01,844
You're the most despicable

569
00:49:02,183 --> 00:49:05,482
Why follow me? I don't want you

570
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,688
You don't want me? You must!

571
00:49:07,922 --> 00:49:09,913
I want wolf girl...

572
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:11,023
No one would want you...

573
00:49:11,392 --> 00:49:13,360
the way you look

574
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:42,742
How come there's a word 'Lien' on you?

575
00:51:43,878 --> 00:51:45,641
I only know it's my surname

576
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:47,870
I have no name

577
00:51:50,685 --> 00:51:52,585
Everybody should have a name

578
00:51:54,188 --> 00:51:56,281
I've been living with wolves
from childhood!

579
00:51:57,458 --> 00:52:00,552
Chi Wu-shuang adopted me and
brought me to the cult

580
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:02,928
She taught me kung fu and

581
00:52:04,332 --> 00:52:06,095
made me her killing instrument

582
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:09,934
Let me give you a name

583
00:52:14,942 --> 00:52:16,671
Lien...

584
00:52:17,912 --> 00:52:18,844
Lien Wu-kung (practice martial arts)?

585
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,404
Lien Wu-kung?

586
00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:46,401
I remember now,

587
00:52:47,008 --> 00:52:48,600
when I first saw you,

588
00:52:49,977 --> 00:52:51,808
you were standing...

589
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,375
on the mountain-top

590
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:55,716
and glittered with your dress reflected
by the moonlight

591
00:52:57,785 --> 00:52:58,843
You should be named Lien Ni-chang

592
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,182
Lien Ni-chang?

593
00:53:07,128 --> 00:53:09,187
Let's get out of the underworld together

594
00:53:10,965 --> 00:53:12,899
Don't you begrudge Wu Tang?

595
00:53:13,101 --> 00:53:14,329
Don't you begrudge the post of Chief?

596
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:20,337
The underworld doesn't belong to us
Let them fight for it

597
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:27,112
What would you do if

598
00:53:28,282 --> 00:53:29,146
I should grow old
with silver hair years later?

599
00:53:30,551 --> 00:53:31,540
Don't worry

600
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,421
Have you heard of a fabulous flower

601
00:53:35,656 --> 00:53:36,520
blossoming each 2 decades that,

602
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:37,885
once taken can bring eternal life?

603
00:53:39,127 --> 00:53:41,061
If you should go silver-haired,

604
00:53:41,496 --> 00:53:43,191
I'll bring the elixir to you
by any means

605
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,282
Promise me, promise me

606
00:54:07,455 --> 00:54:08,114
What?

607
00:54:08,656 --> 00:54:09,714
Don't ever distrust me

608
00:54:10,191 --> 00:54:11,249
I hate people who do

609
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:14,625
I swear

610
00:54:22,136 --> 00:54:25,594
I swear under Heaven
I would be condemned

611
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,607
if I should ever let Lien Ni-chang down

612
00:55:34,141 --> 00:55:38,100
Why? Why let me down?

613
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:41,678
Speak up

614
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,244
Don't get excited!

615
00:55:44,752 --> 00:55:46,083
Adopt another wild one...

616
00:55:46,254 --> 00:55:48,688
from a wolf lair

617
00:55:48,856 --> 00:55:51,086
and woo her when she grows up

618
00:55:51,259 --> 00:55:53,454
The only worry is your kung fu
would've been disabled then

619
00:55:56,697 --> 00:55:57,925
Shut up!

620
00:56:00,635 --> 00:56:02,262
I expended so much effort on you

621
00:56:03,037 --> 00:56:04,834
Can this be done away with?

622
00:56:05,439 --> 00:56:06,872
Once I decide on the course to take,

623
00:56:08,609 --> 00:56:09,906
I won't turn back

624
00:56:10,411 --> 00:56:11,571
Is this your excuse...

625
00:56:11,746 --> 00:56:12,804
for leaving the cult?

626
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:14,111
What do you want?

627
00:56:14,582 --> 00:56:17,346
You knew what my brother wants

628
00:56:21,255 --> 00:56:22,654
Only if you let me leave the cult

629
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:25,555
you may do anything you like

630
00:58:25,312 --> 00:58:27,803
Brother, no point licking all over her

631
00:58:28,149 --> 00:58:29,844
Her heart is already somebody else's

632
00:58:30,017 --> 00:58:31,507
You picked a junk

633
00:58:32,586 --> 00:58:33,848
I've been your twin for such a long time

634
00:58:34,021 --> 00:58:36,285
and you don't even know
a female's normal reaction

635
00:58:36,457 --> 00:58:37,856
You're getting out of your mind

636
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:57,206
Have you given it to others?

637
00:59:01,082 --> 00:59:03,812
Did you follow that Wu Tang scoundrel
when you last disappeared?

638
00:59:04,085 --> 00:59:06,781
He's not a scoundrel! He's Cho Yi-hang

639
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:11,223
What has he given you?

640
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,858
A name

641
00:59:14,762 --> 00:59:17,663
I'm now Lien Ni-chang, not a wolf girl

642
00:59:18,532 --> 00:59:21,023
Everybody should've a name on birth

643
00:59:23,971 --> 00:59:26,166
Brother, what a common name

644
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,798
So she wants only to be a common person

645
00:59:41,589 --> 00:59:42,385
Lien Ni-chang

646
00:59:45,226 --> 00:59:47,319
You want to be a common person

647
00:59:47,595 --> 00:59:50,359
Now leave the cult like a commoner

648
01:00:07,748 --> 01:00:08,544
Uncle Kuei then became...

649
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:12,586
a General he dreamt of

650
01:00:14,421 --> 01:00:15,888
Only then did I sense the meaning of

651
01:00:16,056 --> 01:00:18,786
what he said to me in Shanhaikwan

652
01:00:21,795 --> 01:00:24,457
Never expected that a hero that claimed
to wipe out foreign tribesmen

653
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:27,793
would've let the Ching troops in
at this juncture

654
01:00:54,495 --> 01:00:55,291
Undress

655
01:01:06,073 --> 01:01:07,005
Go

656
01:02:00,828 --> 01:02:01,726
Hell with you!

657
01:02:16,677 --> 01:02:17,473
Remember,

658
01:02:18,279 --> 01:02:19,371
don't use your martial arts

659
01:02:38,399 --> 01:02:42,859
Love, thy spell is irresistible

660
01:02:43,037 --> 01:02:43,833
Shut up!

661
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:25,134
Stop!

662
01:03:31,151 --> 01:03:35,520
As I said, none can pass this

663
01:03:50,637 --> 01:03:51,831
Can I leave now?

664
01:03:53,974 --> 01:03:55,100
Yes

665
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,668
Sister, your bridal dress

666
01:04:27,608 --> 01:04:28,267
Cho Yi-hang

667
01:04:36,483 --> 01:04:38,542
Traitor Wu San-kuei led
the Ching troops into the pass

668
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,054
At a time
when the Ming empire is critical

669
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:46,587
and needs men to defend its territory

670
01:04:47,261 --> 01:04:49,525
you're having a tryst...

671
01:04:49,696 --> 01:04:50,685
with a rival

672
01:04:53,801 --> 01:04:55,792
Ni-chang and I have both decided
to quit the underworld

673
01:04:57,104 --> 01:04:59,629
Yi-hang, so you'd rather
let your name stink in history...

674
01:04:59,807 --> 01:05:01,274
because of that witch

675
01:05:03,076 --> 01:05:04,065
You may leave

676
01:05:04,611 --> 01:05:05,339
Goddamn disciple

677
01:05:06,647 --> 01:05:08,137
You betray the one closest to you!

678
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:14,243
Brother, in any case,

679
01:05:15,322 --> 01:05:16,880
considering the master's upbringing,

680
01:05:17,357 --> 01:05:20,019
you should return
to explain everything to him

681
01:05:31,004 --> 01:05:31,766
Hold it!

682
01:05:33,207 --> 01:05:35,767
Since you left, the Chief seldom spoke

683
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:38,234
I think he's really peevish this time

684
01:05:39,213 --> 01:05:42,239
Think carefully how to explain to him

685
01:06:05,272 --> 01:06:06,170
What's wrong?

686
01:06:58,191 --> 01:06:59,180
The master's body...

687
01:07:02,296 --> 01:07:04,287
Where's the master's body?

688
01:07:06,466 --> 01:07:07,831
Find it! Find it now!

689
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:09,559
Yes

690
01:07:20,113 --> 01:07:22,946
Uncle... Uncle

691
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:24,544
Brother

692
01:07:26,987 --> 01:07:29,683
Chief

693
01:08:12,766 --> 01:08:14,563
Hsin Cheng! Hsin Cheng

694
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:30,746
Brother

695
01:08:30,917 --> 01:08:31,542
Hsin Cheng

696
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,245
Hsin Cheng

697
01:08:36,857 --> 01:08:37,687
Brother

698
01:08:37,858 --> 01:08:38,483
It hurts badly

699
01:08:38,659 --> 01:08:39,557
Hsin Cheng, tell me who did it?

700
01:08:41,261 --> 01:08:42,819
Who did it? Tell me!

701
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,834
Tell me now. Hsin Cheng! Who did it?

702
01:08:51,805 --> 01:08:57,675
While you were away,
the wolf girl brought men to kill us

703
01:09:02,482 --> 01:09:04,916
Never thought Wu Tang
would end up this way!

704
01:09:05,852 --> 01:09:06,546
She didn't do it!

705
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,414
What?

706
01:09:07,788 --> 01:09:09,881
She was brought up by a wolf,
she must be brutal

707
01:09:10,424 --> 01:09:11,288
You brought rack and

708
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:12,925
tuin to Wu Tang

709
01:09:14,628 --> 01:09:16,027
Why don't you wake up?

710
01:09:16,897 --> 01:09:19,365
Cho Yi-hang, wake up

711
01:09:54,267 --> 01:09:55,461
I've come to see Cho Yi-chang

712
01:09:58,939 --> 01:10:01,203
Witch, to see him
after resorting to killing?

713
01:10:01,575 --> 01:10:02,007
What?

714
01:10:25,632 --> 01:10:26,257
Lu-hua

715
01:10:28,802 --> 01:10:29,427
Damn witch

716
01:10:37,177 --> 01:10:37,973
Let's go

717
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,274
We only want to ask you one question

718
01:10:47,521 --> 01:10:48,852
Did you do it?

719
01:10:49,289 --> 01:10:51,314
Their death is not linked to me

720
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,921
All I want to know now is

721
01:10:53,794 --> 01:10:54,783
will you follow me?

722
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,398
Why did you do that?

723
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:07,836
Why?

724
01:11:08,074 --> 01:11:09,041
Don't let her get away!

725
01:11:18,385 --> 01:11:19,818
Kill this witch!

726
01:12:05,432 --> 01:12:06,899
Why don't you trust me?

727
01:12:43,503 --> 01:12:44,561
Don't ever distrust me

728
01:12:45,438 --> 01:12:46,496
I hate people who do

729
01:12:47,474 --> 01:12:48,031
I swear

730
01:12:49,876 --> 01:12:53,209
I swear under Heaven
I would be condemned

731
01:12:54,281 --> 01:12:55,145
if I should ever let Lien Ni-chang down

732
01:13:12,532 --> 01:13:14,397
The witch is possessed. Kill her!

733
01:14:35,281 --> 01:14:36,111
Ni-chang

734
01:14:37,417 --> 01:14:38,816
She's dead

735
01:14:42,789 --> 01:14:45,053
Ni-chang

736
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:54,925
Yi-hang

737
01:14:56,870 --> 01:15:01,000
Come here, come here

738
01:15:08,681 --> 01:15:09,670
Master

739
01:15:11,051 --> 01:15:15,215
Yi-hang, why didn't you take...

740
01:15:15,789 --> 01:15:18,257
my advice all these years

741
01:15:21,661 --> 01:15:24,562
but go against me in every way?

742
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:31,534
Yi-hang, you're doing me an injustice

743
01:15:32,505 --> 01:15:35,235
for bringing Wu Tang to such a state

744
01:15:37,143 --> 01:15:39,338
Master, I...

745
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:54,789
Idiot

746
01:16:00,967 --> 01:16:07,099
Congratulations on your match
May you have a long and happy union

747
01:16:14,347 --> 01:16:16,281
You may die tragically

748
01:16:24,257 --> 01:16:25,019
Come out

749
01:16:25,358 --> 01:16:26,188
Come out

750
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:28,288
Come out!

751
01:16:44,544 --> 01:16:49,982
Brother, why take
such an attitude towards me?

752
01:18:31,784 --> 01:18:32,409
Watch out!

753
01:19:05,084 --> 01:19:09,612
What have you got to take away my girl?

754
01:19:11,624 --> 01:19:13,888
You want to know?

755
01:19:57,270 --> 01:20:00,569
Brother, gouge out
that bitch's heart for me

756
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:14,809
Come out

757
01:20:16,556 --> 01:20:20,925
What are you waiting for?
Kill her! Kill her!

758
01:20:22,495 --> 01:20:23,928
Kill her!

759
01:20:25,131 --> 01:20:29,329
Hear me? Kill her!

760
01:20:32,338 --> 01:20:34,169
Come on quick!

761
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:38,633
Why don't you kill her? Kill her!

762
01:21:08,107 --> 01:21:10,575
Brother! Never knew...

763
01:21:11,778 --> 01:21:15,908
you'd be stung by your own conscience

764
01:21:29,429 --> 01:21:36,665
So it's great sleeping this way

765
01:21:40,573 --> 01:21:46,512
Ni-chang
