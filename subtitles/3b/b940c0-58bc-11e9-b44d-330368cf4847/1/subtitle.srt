1
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:13,508
Dixie, it's me.
How are you?

2
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:16,948
I'm on my way.
I'll be there in about five minutes.

3
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:22,247
I'm bringing it.
I've only had it a year and a half.

4
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:24,518
I told you I'd return it.

5
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:26,526
Talk to you later.

6
00:01:26,594 --> 00:01:28,528
All right. Bye.

7
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:43,467
I'm walkin'

8
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:45,307
Yes indeed
And I'm talkin'

9
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,041
'Bout you and me

10
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:48,707
Yeah, I'm hopin'

11
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:54,417
Now I'm forming
words with my tongue

12
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,253
Now I'm stumbling
But I'm okay now

13
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:01,094
Now I'm walkin'
down the steps

14
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,926
'Cause it's easier
than walkin' up the steps

15
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,294
Didn't slide

16
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:09,233
Oh, that's a tough break for me

17
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:13,901
Now I'm having
a small heart attack

18
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,670
But I'm recovering

19
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,444
Now I'm seeing

20
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,879
Two coked-up hopheads comin' at me

21
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:22,677
Could be trouble

22
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:27,053
- Off the sidewalk!
- Other side of the street, scum!

23
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,055
Now!
It's a cop.

24
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:34,322
Wait a minute.
If he's a cop, where's his gun?

25
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:38,490
He's a fireman!

26
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,534
Cut a wide swath, pussy.

27
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:46,868
All right.

28
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:49,933
- Thank you, ass-wipe.
- Christ! That's the biggest no...

29
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:53,776
Don't say it.

30
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:59,316
Quite a hood ornament
you got there, pal.

31
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:03,020
Here it comes!

32
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:05,184
3-D, comin' at ya!

33
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:10,621
I really admire your shoes.

34
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:11,995
What?

35
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,762
- I love your shoes.
- What do you mean?

36
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:17,464
I was just thinking that...

37
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:20,234
as much as I really
admire your shoes...

38
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:22,868
and as much as I'd love
to have a pair just like them...

39
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:26,812
I really wouldn't want
to be in your shoes...

40
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:29,145
at this particular
time and place.

41
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,654
- I don't really know karate.
- I didn't think so.

42
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:52,400
Get up!

43
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:54,100
Son of a...

44
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:56,439
- Get pissed, Rich!
- I am pissed!

45
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:04,014
Fifteen, love.

46
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:06,645
- My nose!
- Okay, come on!

47
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:12,491
- That was close.
- You want trouble?

48
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,653
You're gonna get trouble.

49
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:19,926
Blood!

50
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,866
Fault!
Et la.

51
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:25,268
Okay, that's the way
you wanna play?

52
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,603
You broke my nose!

53
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:32,007
OlÃ©.

54
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,277
Had enough yet?

55
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:38,943
Thirty, love.

56
00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:42,847
Surprise.
Forty, love.

57
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,384
Are we having fun yet?

58
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:56,960
Service!

59
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,632
Game.

60
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,444
Let's play again sometime.

61
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,415
Grover?

62
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,915
Where the hell is she?
Oh, hi.

63
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:43,917
- Here's your racket.
- Thanks.

64
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:48,119
- What's this stuff on it? Vitalis?
- No, it's blood.

65
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:49,816
Where's my tea?

66
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,415
Bernie.

67
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:54,689
- You wanna tell me about it?
- You're too young.

68
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:56,195
Come here, Grover.

69
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:01,897
Come here.

70
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:05,037
Shit!

71
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:08,866
Damn it!

72
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:11,275
There better be
a window open, Grover.

73
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:14,940
I'm going to have you neutered!

74
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,573
Oh, God.

75
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:20,382
Don't go anywhere.
I'm going to the front of the house.

76
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,880
Oh, brother.
I can't believe it.

77
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:58,251
More, more!
Thank you, thank you.

78
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:06,994
Goddamn it!
We're supposed to put them out!

79
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:09,866
- Guys! Guys!
- What now?

80
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,974
I have a dream. It's not a big dream,
it's just a little dream.

81
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:22,072
My dream... and I hope
you don't find this too crazy...

82
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:25,448
is that I would like
the people of this community...

83
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,454
to feel that if,
God forbid, there were a fire...

84
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:33,152
calling the fire department
would actually be a wise thing to do!

85
00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:36,162
You can't have people,
as their houses are burning down...

86
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,495
say, "Whatever you do,
don't call the fire department"!

87
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,398
That would be bad.

88
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:47,841
Please, get it cleaned up.
Don't make me have to explain it.

89
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:50,172
No problem, Chief.
We'II do it.

90
00:07:55,282 --> 00:07:56,874
Hello?

91
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:04,120
I'm locked out of my house.

92
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:07,183
I can get you back in.
Come on inside. I'll get some tools.

93
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:09,320
I don't have any clothes on.

94
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,424
You want a coat?

95
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:18,895
No. I really like to stand naked
in this bush in the freezing cold.

96
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:21,741
I'll get the tools.

97
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:27,680
Hi, Chief.
What is it?

98
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:30,774
- Somebody locked out of their house.
- Need any help, Chief?

99
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:33,684
It looks pretty boring.
I'll take care of it.

100
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:35,221
We're in trouble.

101
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,918
- Nobody had a coat?
- You said you didn't want a coat.

102
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:41,985
- Why would I not want a coat?
- You said you didn't want a coat.

103
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,362
- I was being ironic.
- Oh! Irony!

104
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:47,401
No, we don't get that here.

105
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:49,732
See, people ski topless here
while smoking dope...

106
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:52,637
so irony's not really
a high priority.

107
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:55,698
We haven't had any irony here
since about '83...

108
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:59,735
when I was the only practitioner of it,
and I stopped because I was stared at.

109
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:00,803
Oh, brother.

110
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,117
You shouldn't leave your lights on
when you're locked out.

111
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:06,346
You waste a lot of electricity.

112
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,083
You can hide in that bush over there,
and I won't see your nakedness.

113
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:12,455
I noticed you don't
have any tattoos.

114
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:14,289
I think that's a wise choice.

115
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:16,795
I don't think Jackie Onassis
would have gone as far...

116
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:18,832
if she'd had
an anchor on her arm.

117
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,333
Well, every job
has a perfect tool.

118
00:09:24,071 --> 00:09:26,335
Let's see.

119
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:30,434
This lock doesn't accept MasterCharge.
I'm gonna have to try the old reliable.

120
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:32,843
And when I say...

121
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:36,781
old reliable, I'm lying,
because I've never tried this before.

122
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:40,480
You may not want to watch this.

123
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:51,959
Careful.

124
00:09:57,204 --> 00:09:59,138
God, I hate heights.

125
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,813
What are you doing?
I'm freezing.

126
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:09,145
For God's sake,
put something on.

127
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:25,461
There you go.
I'm averting my eyes, finally.

128
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,340
Look what you got me
into, Grover. Thanks.

129
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:41,872
Do you wanna come in...

130
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:44,645
I sort of already did.

131
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,652
I figured you must be starving...

132
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,553
so I made us some cheese
and some vegetables...

133
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:51,318
au naturel.

134
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:55,086
Maybe you'd like some wine
with your nose.

135
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:58,759
- Cheese.
- Wine will be fine.

136
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:10,068
- Do you have a straw?
- I don't, actually. Why?

137
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,442
No particular reason.

138
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:31,296
Cheers.

139
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:45,705
Party trick.

140
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,680
Well, a nose by any other name.

141
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,683
Would smell as sweet.

142
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,284
My name's C.D. Bales.
I'm the fire chief.

143
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:58,416
You can call me Charlie
if you want.

144
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:02,292
My name's Roxanne.
Thanks for helping me before.

145
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:05,855
- I know the lady who owns this house.
- Dixie? I liked her.

146
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,060
She gave me a real good deal
for the summer.

147
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:10,399
Nice and cheap, I'll bet.

148
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:14,066
It's worth it.
This house has a great spot for that.

149
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:17,076
- I thought you'd never ask.
- I didn't.

150
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:19,078
What is it, a mummy?

151
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:22,980
It's a telescope.
It's beautiful.

152
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,644
- You must know about M-31.
- Yeah.

153
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:28,745
I like it when they give
astronomical objects names...

154
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:32,383
you know, like Andromeda
and Saturn...

155
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,484
and Sea of Tranquility.

156
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:38,122
This whole numbering thing
is just too boring for us civilians.

157
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:42,661
Do you know how many
objects are up there?

158
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:47,400
Well, I know it's over 50.

159
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:51,001
They've done pretty well, considering
how many things they have to name.

160
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:54,445
How about muon? Gluon?

161
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:57,416
Quark?
You know what a quark is?

162
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:01,752
I used to.
I just forgot right now.

163
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,256
Oh, well,
we don't know everything, do we?

164
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:07,585
Sit down. I'll show you.

165
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:12,360
Here it is.

166
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:16,426
No one's actually ever seen a quark,
but we know they exist.

167
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:18,562
There's at least
six different types.

168
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,607
There's up, down...

169
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,609
strange, charmed...

170
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,144
bottom and top.

171
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,271
That's their flavor.

172
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,317
The top and bottom quarks
are the most common kinds...

173
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:32,682
but only an unusually
exotic collision...

174
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:36,086
can produce the strange
and charmed quarks.

175
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:38,954
- It's beautiful, don't you think?
- Yeah.

176
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,358
These are astronomical objects, then?

177
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:43,692
No. Subnuclear particles.

178
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:47,166
I thought so.

179
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:50,934
So what are you looking for?

180
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:53,199
I can't tell you.

181
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:56,003
- Why is that?
- It's a secret.

182
00:13:56,076 --> 00:14:00,012
I got a few secrets myself.
Some pretty important ones, too.

183
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,048
Actually, I have
one pretty impor...

184
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:05,017
Actually, I have one lousy one.

185
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:07,076
Actually, I don't have
any secrets at all.

186
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:10,356
It's just so depressing.

187
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,360
Did you say your name
was Roxanne?

188
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,367
That's unusual.
It's pretty.

189
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,234
There's a name for a galaxy.

190
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:33,340
Sorry. Didn't mean
to wax rhapsodic.

191
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,747
I should go. It's late and I've got
a lot of important things to do.

192
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:40,853
Well, wish me luck.

193
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,389
- On?
- Just luck.

194
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:45,857
No, I don't believe in luck.

195
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,451
Wish for something to happen.

196
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:52,793
I know what you mean.
Good-bye.

197
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,466
So long.

198
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,634
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

199
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,858
It's a party town, maestro.
You'll love it.

200
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,335
Gavanna Samana?

201
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,342
What?

202
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:39,936
Weren't you Playmate of the Month,
June, '85?

203
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,072
- Come on.
- No.

204
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,778
That's really funny, 'cause I thought
I recognized your inner diameter slope.

205
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:48,446
What's that?

206
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:51,650
The part of the back of your leg
that curves into your inner thigh.

207
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:56,629
Works every time, maestro.

208
00:15:56,697 --> 00:16:00,724
I'm calling you maestro because that's
what you are with the chicks, right?

209
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:03,235
Men, let's go.
I'll take the top one.

210
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:08,106
- You ready?
- Okay.

211
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,767
Right.

212
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:12,870
What?

213
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:17,673
What's goin' on here?

214
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,148
Training.

215
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,450
I want something that says
action with style.

216
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,495
- Kind of a GQ firefighter.
- Guys.

217
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:31,656
Guys, this is Chris,
our new pro.

218
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:34,997
- A real firefighter.
- Welcome aboard, Chris.

219
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:37,502
I'm Mayor Deebs.
We didn't expect you till Monday.

220
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:41,029
- I thought I'd get an early start.
- He's a maniac with the chicks, too.

221
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:46,011
Dean, Trent,
my personal tailor, Sam.

222
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,912
- I'll show you to your room.
- What do you think? Cuffs or no cuffs?

223
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:51,416
I think you'd better
get off that hose.

224
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:01,794
I think I'm gonna have trouble
getting my telescope up those stairs.

225
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:05,298
I'll ask C.D. To do it, if I can
tear him away from his encyclopedias.

226
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:08,300
- He reads encyclopedias?
- He is an encyclopedia.

227
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,629
- He's funny.
- He's great.

228
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:13,536
He's my godbrother.

229
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:16,800
This uniform works.
That's why I'm a volunteer.

230
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:18,469
- I can tell.
- Hey, Carol.

231
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:21,241
What about your boyfriend?
What's his name?

232
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:24,113
- Richard.
- When's he comin'?

233
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:26,982
He's not.
He's not coming.

234
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:28,646
What happened?

235
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:31,923
We just ran out of gas.

236
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:34,222
I guess I mistook sex for love.

237
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:36,990
I did that once.
It was great.

238
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,530
Sandy's a very deep person.

239
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:46,631
Oh, my God!
Who is that?

240
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:50,338
She could certainly
make my night.

241
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,344
- Who is she?
- Oh, God.

242
00:17:53,981 --> 00:17:56,245
Sandy, come here.

243
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:59,376
- Who's that?
- That's Roxanne.

244
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,287
- She studies astronomy or astrology.
- There's a difference?

245
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:08,319
Look, look.
Someone is checking you out.

246
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:10,987
He could cheer you up.

247
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,067
If I was you,
I'd do something about that.

248
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,035
Maybe.

249
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:19,436
Maybe later.
Maybe not.

250
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:23,008
You are playing it beautifully.

251
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:25,840
You don't mind
if I give it a shot?

252
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:28,710
- You go right ahead.
- Thanks, maestro.

253
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,652
You know, I'd like to invite you
to a Nelson tradition.

254
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:44,196
- Hot-tubbing.
- Pardon me?

255
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:48,166
It's a tradition we have here
to consume some mulled wine...

256
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:51,033
and enjoy some
outdoor hot-tubbing.

257
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:54,369
Tradition? You mean, when the settlers
came here a hundred years ago...

258
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:56,671
they started hot-tubbing?

259
00:18:56,743 --> 00:18:58,677
Oh, yeah.

260
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:01,213
You are feisty.
I like that.

261
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:05,445
- He's got an ego the size of Brazil.
- I have to stop talking right now.

262
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,182
No problem. Tell you what.
I'll be right over there.

263
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:11,588
You just start
thinkin' about it...

264
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:14,650
and if you change your mind,
just come on over.

265
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:16,719
And I think you might.

266
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:19,823
If I do change my mind,
you'll know because...

267
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,200
my breasts will be heaving
and moist with perspiration.

268
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,205
- So long, foxy.
- So long.

269
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:29,902
Later.

270
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:32,638
Look. He only gave us
enough money for one drink.

271
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,581
- So this is how it'll be being single.
- He's got a great ass.

272
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,551
- Too bad it's on his shoulders.
- Oh, he's cute.

273
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:41,712
- He's a flirt.
- I have nothing against cute.

274
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:45,417
I just wish I could meet someone
with half a brain this time.

275
00:19:45,492 --> 00:19:47,084
Good luck.

276
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,617
He went up there before school,
and he just won't come down.

277
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:23,288
All right, all right.

278
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:25,388
- I'II see what I can do.
- Thanks.

279
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:27,899
Dean, it's Bales, B-A-L-E-S.

280
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:29,731
Right, Bales.

281
00:20:30,737 --> 00:20:33,638
I know that.
You're the chief.

282
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:36,403
He's not moving or anything,
but he did it once before...

283
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:38,740
but he's never
stayed up there this long.

284
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:42,441
It's gonna be all right, honey.
C.D. Will take care of it.

285
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,054
Hey, what's the trouble, Peter?

286
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:54,927
Come on.
What's the matter?

287
00:20:55,862 --> 00:20:58,660
They call me "porky" at school.

288
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:04,429
Why do they have to do that?
Goddamn it.

289
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:09,941
I shouldn't say that
in front of you.

290
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:14,842
- Did you talk to your mother about it?
- Once I tried.

291
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:17,509
But she said I had to
clean up my plate first.

292
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:22,447
Now, see?
That's good.

293
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:24,786
You're way better than
these guys who make fun of you.

294
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:28,817
You're smart and you're funny.
You can make things up.

295
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:31,386
I didn't make it up.
It's true.

296
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,934
Bastards!

297
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:38,266
I shouldn't say that
in front of you.

298
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:43,469
Do I have to get down now?

299
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,081
Let's just stay up here
for a while.

300
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,658
That's our new computer.

301
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,891
We can pinpoint
any fire in town with that.

302
00:22:01,962 --> 00:22:03,589
I can see that.

303
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:07,099
It's perfect for us because, you know,
we're the fire department.

304
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:08,725
Yeah, that is perfect.

305
00:22:08,802 --> 00:22:10,736
- I'm Andy.
- Good to meet you.

306
00:22:10,804 --> 00:22:12,567
- How are you?
- Fine.

307
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:16,131
- I just wanted to welcome you.
- Okay. Thanks a lot.

308
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,801
So, okay.

309
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:21,846
Hey, there is one thing.

310
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:24,349
Have you met the chief?

311
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:28,080
Well, he's kind of funny-Iooking,
so I wouldn't mention it.

312
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:31,419
- I wouldn't do that.
- I figured you wouldn't.

313
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:34,392
But sometimes, you know...

314
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:38,397
things kind of accidentally slip out,
and then, you know...

315
00:22:44,204 --> 00:22:45,796
Watch it on that stair.

316
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:48,102
Who designed these steps?
The Marquis de Sade?

317
00:22:48,174 --> 00:22:50,438
- Watch the mirror.
- Why is this thing so heavy?

318
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,172
- It's mostly air.
- And glass, so be careful.

319
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:57,046
I had an aunt who knitted one of these.
It was much lighter than this.

320
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:01,648
This secret of yours
relates to this thing, right?

321
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:03,245
Sort of, yeah.

322
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:05,484
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Charlie?

323
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:08,618
Charlie, I can't
hold this by myself.

324
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,124
You don't have to tell me.

325
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:16,635
- Okay, I'll tell you.
- All right, all right.

326
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:18,398
Start talking.
There we go.

327
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:21,463
- Wait a second.
- Got it.

328
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,975
I think I discovered a comet.

329
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:31,640
It's no big deal.
There's lots of comets.

330
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:35,176
But I was working on this paper...
watch it...

331
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:37,246
- On the oort cloud.
- The oort cloud.

332
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:39,918
And I discovered
a mathematical irregularity.

333
00:23:40,894 --> 00:23:44,261
I haven't climbed this many steps
since I went to see the maharishi.

334
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:46,265
Let's go. Go on.

335
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:50,628
- I think that a series of ten comets...
- Yeah?

336
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:54,037
- Watch it around this corner.
- I got it.

337
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:57,543
Are actually the forerunner of a
big comet which is due back this summer.

338
00:23:58,178 --> 00:24:00,169
So you're gonna find it
with this thing.

339
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:03,841
This is too small. My uncle's looking
for it in the big scope in Arizona.

340
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:06,317
So I've carried this
up here for nothing.

341
00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:07,819
Not really.

342
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:11,323
Put that counterbalance
on that arm, with the key.

343
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:14,087
So what do you get
if you're right?

344
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,718
Nothing.

345
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:18,593
Well, I graduate.
That's for sure.

346
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,327
- And I get to name it.
- That's pretty good.

347
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:23,335
Sort of historical.

348
00:24:24,804 --> 00:24:26,465
Comet Kowalski.

349
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:30,566
Kowalski? Why? You've got a chance
to give it a beautiful name.

350
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:33,305
- That's my name.
- It is? Roxanne Kowalski?

351
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,042
- Yeah.
- Oh, sorry.

352
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,747
When do you find out
about this thing?

353
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:41,150
July 14th, 2200 hours...

354
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:43,746
eight minutes, 31 seconds.

355
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:45,484
Give or take ten days.

356
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,823
That would really be something.

357
00:24:58,104 --> 00:25:00,834
Don't look now,
but the Viking just came in.

358
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:02,898
- Don't look now.
- God, it's him.

359
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,410
- All right.
- Chris, come over here.

360
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:07,912
Shake hands. I'm the mayor.
It'II make you look important.

361
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:10,176
He should be bronzed.

362
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,912
Everyone tells me you're fast,
efficient and brilliant.

363
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:15,750
Brilliant!
With the ladies.

364
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:17,517
Take care of yourself.

365
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,617
If anything happens to you, C.D. Will be
all over my kizitski or kozalski.

366
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:31,536
Sorry. Sorry.

367
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,941
Get ahold of yourself. God.

368
00:25:45,018 --> 00:25:46,952
It's now or never.

369
00:25:48,354 --> 00:25:51,414
- Do it, Roxanne.
- There's only one way to tell.

370
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,925
What difference does it make?

371
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:58,354
When he comes out,
I'll invite him to...

372
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,865
a Nelson tradition
of hot-tubbing...

373
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,835
and I'll set him up
with some mulled wine...

374
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:05,996
and I'll "babe" him a lot.

375
00:26:06,072 --> 00:26:07,835
I'm shocked.

376
00:26:07,907 --> 00:26:10,102
- We're all shocked.
- I'm not shocked.

377
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:12,303
I need a little confidence.

378
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,344
A little water,
and then you're gonna talk to her.

379
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:20,518
Shit!

380
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:56,455
- Remember me?
- I'm trying to put it behind me.

381
00:26:57,857 --> 00:26:59,984
- Is this your shop?
- Yeah.

382
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,118
It's my shop. All mine.

383
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,597
- It's perfect.
- Thank you.

384
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,133
- Thank you very much.
- It's really you.

385
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:10,192
I appreciate that.

386
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:14,835
Why don't you come in and check out
the new freeze-dried animals?

387
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:17,604
They're incredibly lifelike.

388
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,611
Maybe next time, huh?

389
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:40,422
It came to me last night
in a flash.

390
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,195
- What is that?
- The thing.

391
00:27:42,268 --> 00:27:45,169
The gimmick.
The Nelson promotional cow.

392
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:48,805
We're talkin' to the chief.

393
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,776
You give her a name:
Susie, Esmerelda, Bossy.

394
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:55,075
You put her picture in the corner
of our posters, drinkin' a beer.

395
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:58,447
Teach her to drink a beer!
These things work!

396
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:01,419
- I think it's a fantastic idea.
- Do you like it?

397
00:28:01,487 --> 00:28:04,115
I love it.
I think it's great!

398
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,215
Great idea! Just...

399
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:09,261
I think it's brilliant!
What an idea!

400
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:11,524
And I was there.
I saw it happen.

401
00:28:11,598 --> 00:28:14,192
He took the idea,
he saw it ripe on the tree...

402
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:16,667
he plucked it
and he put it in his pocket.

403
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,796
It's... dare I say... genius?

404
00:28:21,307 --> 00:28:24,071
But maybe...
maybe it is.

405
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:28,477
Maybe I'm in the presence of greatness.
Maybe I just don't know it.

406
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:31,346
- You meet C.D. Yet?
- The chief? Not yet.

407
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:34,147
There's a little something
you should know.

408
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,087
I know.
He's got a big nose, right?

409
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:40,717
Man, whatever you do,
don't stare.

410
00:28:40,793 --> 00:28:42,784
I'm not gonna stare.
Come on.

411
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:45,296
None of us would,
but you get there...

412
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:48,334
and you feel yourself
not staring.

413
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:52,804
Then you think "It's obvious
I'm not staring," so you look.

414
00:28:52,872 --> 00:28:55,602
Then you think, "I'm staring."

415
00:28:55,675 --> 00:29:00,169
So you say, "This is ridiculous."
And you take a good look.

416
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:02,714
And you think...

417
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,774
"I'm looking at a man who,
when he washes his face...

418
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:07,786
Ioses the bar of soap."

419
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:12,982
- Thanks, guys.
- Don't say we didn't warn you.

420
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,300
Did you see that
on his face?

421
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:26,304
You think people go to Sun Valley 'cause
they have a great fire department?

422
00:29:26,372 --> 00:29:29,773
No. Work along with me.
You've got to use promotion.

423
00:29:29,842 --> 00:29:33,869
That way the town grows,
the fire department grows, we all grow.

424
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:37,382
But you can't run a fire department
with the seven Banana Brothers.

425
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,883
You need professionals.

426
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:42,785
This town could be another Aspen. Do you
have any idea how much money they make?

427
00:29:42,855 --> 00:29:46,086
C.D., as soon as this
Oktoberfest promotion is over...

428
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,150
we'll see about getting
those funds back to you.

429
00:29:48,227 --> 00:29:50,889
Ladies, drinks are on Chuck.
Like it?

430
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,659
Pure beaver.

431
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:55,928
I start to have a drink...

432
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,562
then I start to relax,
and then I start to have fun.

433
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:01,835
And it's not something I really
wanna start at this point in my life.

434
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:06,242
Heard you're tough.

435
00:30:06,312 --> 00:30:07,244
I am.

436
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:13,548
But if you used a little tenderizer,
I might cook up pretty good.

437
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,610
Asshole.

438
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,679
Hey, where you goin',
big nose?

439
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:24,028
Pardon me?

440
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:29,063
You heard me, big nose!

441
00:30:30,503 --> 00:30:32,869
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

442
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:35,874
Well, you really got me
on that one, didn't you?

443
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,078
Wait a second.

444
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:45,181
- What a waste of an opportunity.
- What?

445
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:49,153
Well, I mean, you've got someone
standing in front of you with this...

446
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,417
and all you can
think up is "big nose."

447
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:54,619
I suppose you could
think up somethin' better?

448
00:30:54,694 --> 00:30:58,221
Yeah, I think I could think up
somethin' better. Come here.

449
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:04,028
Take this dart. Whatever number you hit,
that's how many I'II think up.

450
00:31:07,874 --> 00:31:09,865
Twenty? Shit!

451
00:31:10,843 --> 00:31:12,777
Two out of three.

452
00:31:17,483 --> 00:31:18,415
Twenty.

453
00:31:18,484 --> 00:31:21,715
Darts champion,
Denver, 1987.

454
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:24,282
Charlie, you can do it.

455
00:31:26,826 --> 00:31:29,260
All right, 20 something betters.
Here goes.

456
00:31:29,328 --> 00:31:32,058
Start with obvious:

457
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:35,100
"Excuse me. Is that your nose,
or did a bus park on your face?"

458
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:38,333
Meteorological:

459
00:31:38,404 --> 00:31:40,929
"Everybody take cover!
She's going to blow!"

460
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:43,741
Fashionable:

461
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,904
"You could de-emphasize your nose
if you wore something larger...

462
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:48,640
like Wyoming."

463
00:31:50,716 --> 00:31:54,652
Personal. "Well, here we are,
just the three of us."

464
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:56,620
Punctual:

465
00:31:56,689 --> 00:32:00,284
"Delman, your nose was on time,
but you were 15 minutes late."

466
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,587
Envious:

467
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:05,062
"Oh, I wish I were you.

468
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,294
Gosh! To be able
to smell your own ear!"

469
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,397
Naughty: "Pardon me, sir,
some of the ladies have asked...

470
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,998
if you wouldn't mind
putting that thing away."

471
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,872
Philosophical:

472
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:21,106
"It's not the size of a nose
that's important.

473
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,307
It's what in it that matters."

474
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:27,451
Humorous: "Laugh,
and the world laughs with you.

475
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,284
Sneeze, and it's
good-bye Seattle."

476
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:31,823
Commercial:

477
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:36,351
"Hi. I'm Earl Scheib,
and I can paint that nose for $39.95."

478
00:32:37,964 --> 00:32:40,398
Polite: "Would you mind
not bobbing your head?

479
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:42,832
The orchestra
keeps changing tempo."

480
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,733
Melodic. Everybody.

481
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:48,797
He's got the whole world

482
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,036
In his nose

483
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:53,467
Sympathetic:

484
00:32:53,546 --> 00:32:57,038
"Oh, what happened?
Did your parents lose a bet with God?"

485
00:32:58,551 --> 00:32:59,984
Complimentary:

486
00:33:00,052 --> 00:33:03,920
"You must love the little birdies
to give them this to perch on."

487
00:33:05,424 --> 00:33:06,550
Scientific:

488
00:33:06,626 --> 00:33:09,789
"Say, does that thing there
influence the tides?"

489
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,661
Obscure:

490
00:33:12,732 --> 00:33:15,394
"Whoa. I'd hate to see
the grindstone."

491
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:17,601
Think about it.

492
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:22,699
Inquiry: "When you stop
and smell the flowers...

493
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:24,709
are they afraid?"

494
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,308
French:

495
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:32,340
"Sir, the pigs have refused
to find any more truffles...

496
00:33:32,418 --> 00:33:34,352
until you leave!"

497
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:36,782
Pornographic:

498
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:40,553
"Finally, a man who can satisfy
two women at once."

499
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,397
- How many is that?
- Fourteen, Chief!

500
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:50,599
Religious:

501
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,604
"The Lord giveth...

502
00:33:52,672 --> 00:33:55,869
and He just kept on giving,
didn't He?"

503
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:57,603
Fifteen!

504
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:01,408
Disgusting:

505
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,142
"Say, who mows your nose hair?"

506
00:34:05,551 --> 00:34:07,576
Sixteen!

507
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:09,382
Uh, paranoid:

508
00:34:09,455 --> 00:34:12,447
"Keep that guy
away from my cocaine!"

509
00:34:12,525 --> 00:34:14,425
Seventeen!

510
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,417
Aromatic:

511
00:34:16,495 --> 00:34:18,793
"It must be wonderful
to wake up in the morning...

512
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:21,162
and smell the coffee
in Brazil."

513
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:22,894
Eighteen!

514
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,903
Appreciative:

515
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:27,769
"How original. Most people
just have their teeth capped."

516
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:30,975
Nineteen!

517
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:33,344
All right.

518
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:36,472
- One more!
- You can do it, C.D.

519
00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:38,278
- Do it.
- Come on.

520
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:40,581
All right.
Dirty:

521
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:45,257
"Your name wouldn't be Dick,
would it?"

522
00:34:47,193 --> 00:34:49,024
You smart ass
son of a bitch!

523
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:53,031
You flat-faced,
flat-nosed flat head.

524
00:35:00,106 --> 00:35:01,801
Has he fallen yet?

525
00:35:07,747 --> 00:35:09,180
How you doin'?

526
00:35:09,248 --> 00:35:12,615
Did that copy of
"Being And Nothingness" by Jean...

527
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:14,516
Jean-Paul Sartre?
Yes, it did.

528
00:35:14,587 --> 00:35:16,851
I got it right here.
It's all paid for.

529
00:35:16,922 --> 00:35:17,889
Great.

530
00:35:17,957 --> 00:35:19,549
Thanks a lot.

531
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:24,895
- All right.
- It ain't nothin', bro.

532
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:32,267
"Therefore my body is a conscious
structure of my consciousness."

533
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,829
Yeah. Thanks, Chris.

534
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:37,967
I was too embarrassed to go in there
and ask for it myself.

535
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:39,978
A little light reading,
huh, Andy?

536
00:35:41,981 --> 00:35:45,246
I got 9,000
for my house this summer.

537
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:47,251
Which one of the five?

538
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:49,116
The one down on Rush Street.

539
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,089
That's the one Roxanne's in.
You're soaking her for $9,000.

540
00:35:52,158 --> 00:35:54,058
I am not.

541
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:56,060
You like her, don't you?

542
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:59,858
What's not to like?

543
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:03,197
- Why don't you ask her out?
- No. Couldn't possibly fit her in.

544
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:05,237
I've got a 3:00,
I've got a 5:00...

545
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:08,501
and the women are just lined up,
mostly because of the old saying.

546
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:12,203
- What old saying?
- The old saying about a man's nose.

547
00:36:12,278 --> 00:36:15,805
- You know, relating to the size of his...
- Of his what?

548
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:18,042
- Everybody knows this.
- Come on.

549
00:36:18,117 --> 00:36:21,985
Hey, Sophie? You know
the old saying about a man's nose?

550
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:25,990
Oh, you mean how the size of a man's
nose relates to the size of his...

551
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:30,121
Oh, my God!

552
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:32,130
I love doing that to them.

553
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:34,291
- Your tea, sir.
- Thank you.

554
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:36,800
And picks.
Thanks, Bernie.

555
00:36:38,137 --> 00:36:40,571
So, why don't you ask her out?

556
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:43,966
Sometimes I walk around
this town at night...

557
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:46,568
and I see couples walking along
holding hands...

558
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:49,876
I look at them and I think,
"Hey, why not me?"

559
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:53,180
And then I catch
my shadow on the wall.

560
00:36:55,187 --> 00:36:57,951
Why don't you just
get that nose job?

561
00:36:58,023 --> 00:37:00,014
- I did.
- Charlie!

562
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,856
No. It's the word,
"rhinoplasty."

563
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:05,522
It's so unpleasant.
It ranks up there with "hemorrhoid."

564
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,227
Those are just two words you
really don't want to get involved in.

565
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:12,634
What about a little cosmetics?
You know, some shading.

566
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:16,903
Along the sides and down the slope,
a little bit on the end.

567
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:19,103
- It really helps.
- It's not me.

568
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:21,544
- I can't wear makeup.
- Hi.

569
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,242
- You should have stayed last night.
- Sorry I pooped out.

570
00:37:24,316 --> 00:37:26,250
- And you were great.
- I was okay.

571
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:28,115
- We were impressed.
- You were terrific.

572
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:30,621
Especially Roxanne.
She went on and on about you.

573
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:32,247
She did?

574
00:37:32,324 --> 00:37:35,851
And I think she's fallen in love,
but she doesn't know it yet.

575
00:37:35,928 --> 00:37:37,520
See ya.

576
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:44,094
What does she mean,
she thinks she's fallen in love?

577
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,695
Well, it has been known to happen.

578
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:05,713
C.D., this is Chris McConnell.

579
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,725
It's a real pleasure
meeting you.

580
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:11,854
Sorry we've been
missing each other.

581
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:13,956
Are you all right?

582
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:18,026
I know you've met the guys.

583
00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:20,799
How's your room?

584
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:38,489
It's hypnotic, isn't it?

585
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:41,720
It's huge.

586
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,721
It's enormous.

587
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:47,595
It's gigantic!

588
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,029
They said it was big,
but I didn't...

589
00:38:51,103 --> 00:38:53,765
expect it to be big!

590
00:38:59,478 --> 00:39:01,412
Wanna shoot some pool?

591
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,074
Come on, rack 'em up.
We'll play a game.

592
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:08,549
Aren't you gonna kill me?
The guys said that...

593
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:10,851
Ordinarily, yeah,
but not today.

594
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:13,086
Why not?

595
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,361
Because yesterday she didn't.

596
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:19,954
But today...

597
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:21,590
she does.

598
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:33,067
Finally got a sense of humor
about your nose, huh?

599
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:40,943
Rack 'em up.

600
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:44,413
Turn on the hose.

601
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,152
The secret to moving a hose
is in the rhythm.

602
00:39:48,227 --> 00:39:50,218
To the left.

603
00:39:50,296 --> 00:39:54,164
One and two and three.

604
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:55,666
To the right.

605
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,033
Now forward.

606
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:05,109
- Now back.
- Back?

607
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:09,040
I can't stand this!

608
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:12,750
He's dancing!

609
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:15,946
- Go.
- Let's show the chief what we got.

610
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:29,090
Turn it off!
What are you doing?

611
00:40:29,168 --> 00:40:30,897
Turn it off!

612
00:40:35,174 --> 00:40:37,301
Go! Come on!

613
00:40:40,779 --> 00:40:42,974
Shut it off!
Shut it off!

614
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:46,882
Get a good stream.
Lean into it now. You gotta trust it.

615
00:40:46,952 --> 00:40:48,977
Remember, water is your friend.

616
00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:50,817
Now!

617
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:53,357
Okay, what's our signal
for charging the hose?

618
00:40:53,425 --> 00:40:56,019
Remember, like Big Bird.
That's right.

619
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:58,029
Just like on Sesame Street.

620
00:41:09,108 --> 00:41:11,303
- Hit it!
- Watch it!

621
00:41:17,316 --> 00:41:21,047
- Roxanne! It's me, Chuck!
- Not again.

622
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:24,612
There he is.

623
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,022
- Back up a second.
- Okay.

624
00:41:28,794 --> 00:41:30,785
Flirtin' with Sophie
and Lydia again.

625
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,696
Hey, Charlie,
can I talk to you?

626
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:35,199
Well...

627
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:40,329
All right.

628
00:41:40,406 --> 00:41:43,204
- Hi, Charlie.
- Have a good time.

629
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:45,570
I got it.

630
00:41:49,348 --> 00:41:51,748
Okay, was I right?

631
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:54,342
Yep, it's ugly.

632
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,354
It really is.

633
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,789
What I'm gonna say
is a little forward.

634
00:42:02,861 --> 00:42:04,590
Good.

635
00:42:06,498 --> 00:42:09,934
There's someone I think
I should get to know better.

636
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:13,369
Someone who I think likes me, too.
Know what I mean?

637
00:42:15,507 --> 00:42:18,271
I think he wants to talk to me.

638
00:42:18,343 --> 00:42:20,743
I can see him trying,
but he won't.

639
00:42:20,813 --> 00:42:22,781
I like him for that.

640
00:42:22,848 --> 00:42:27,217
Maybe this guy needs you
to make the first move.

641
00:42:27,286 --> 00:42:29,379
That's why I'm talking to you.

642
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:35,460
So, what do you know
about this guy?

643
00:42:35,527 --> 00:42:38,087
Well, I know he's interesting.

644
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:41,392
Different.

645
00:42:42,468 --> 00:42:44,663
Intelligent.

646
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:46,328
Handsome.

647
00:42:47,306 --> 00:42:48,933
He's what?

648
00:42:49,007 --> 00:42:50,998
He's handsome.

649
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:54,409
See? Isn't it amazing
if you have feelings for someone...

650
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,914
how you can start
to see them as handsome?

651
00:42:56,982 --> 00:42:59,075
Everyone thinks he is.

652
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:01,813
Not everyone.
Believe me.

653
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:03,821
What are you talking about?

654
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:08,893
Nothing. It's great.
It's great that he's all these things.

655
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:14,897
I've only seen him a few times.
We've never even spoken.

656
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,801
We just exchanged
a couple of goofy looks.

657
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:20,805
Why are you telling me this?

658
00:43:20,873 --> 00:43:23,398
He works for you.
His name's Chris McConnell.

659
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,306
Oh, yeah.

660
00:43:25,377 --> 00:43:28,540
What's he like?
No, don't tell me.

661
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:30,548
I'll let it unfold.

662
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,916
Since you're gonna be working with him,
maybe you could encourage him a little.

663
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,923
He may not say anything all summer,
and then I'll be gone.

664
00:43:40,392 --> 00:43:42,326
If it comes up.

665
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,021
Thanks.

666
00:43:46,098 --> 00:43:48,032
I know I'm forward.

667
00:43:50,235 --> 00:43:52,703
You were really great
the other night.

668
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:55,638
It's the first time I've ever
seen anyone actually be brave.

669
00:43:55,707 --> 00:43:57,698
I've been a lot braver
since then.

670
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:07,351
This time I want you to do it, Dave.
I want you to cut the thing off!

671
00:44:07,419 --> 00:44:10,946
I'm tired of having a magnificent,
fabulous, interesting nose.

672
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,686
I want a cute little pert,
little petite, little button nose!

673
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,853
Give me the American beauty, Dave.

674
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:19,363
C.D., you know I can't.

675
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:22,958
Oh, yes, you can.
Get the knife. Cut me, Dave.

676
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:27,233
I can't. Allergies to anesthetics
are very, very dangerous.

677
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:29,934
You know that.
You've been in comas before.

678
00:44:30,008 --> 00:44:32,169
We'll do it
the old-fashioned way.

679
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:37,342
Don't be stupid.

680
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:39,941
I wanna look like Diana Ross.

681
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:42,543
What you want is psychotherapy.

682
00:44:42,621 --> 00:44:44,748
I can hear it now:
"Get used to it.

683
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:47,087
Eighty-five dollars, please."

684
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:49,923
Look, C.D.,
have you ever thought...

685
00:44:49,995 --> 00:44:52,964
that you were born
with this nose for a reason?

686
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:55,926
Oh, yeah.

687
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:58,231
Like opening Coke bottles.

688
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:00,896
Oh, shit.

689
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,774
Hey, Dave, could I look at
those nose cards one more time?

690
00:45:12,985 --> 00:45:14,577
Yeah, sure.

691
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,182
Thanks, Dave.

692
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,709
Where's that one?

693
00:45:40,445 --> 00:45:43,608
Hello, darling.
Haven't seen you in a while.

694
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:47,645
She's so beautiful.
I saw her in that bar.

695
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:50,210
- She's so pretty I just...
- She's interesting too.

696
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,087
Interesting, yeah.
Did you see her legs?

697
00:45:53,158 --> 00:45:55,183
She's got a sense of humor also.

698
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,661
She wants to meet me? You sure?
I can't believe this.

699
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:01,198
God, my third day here.

700
00:46:01,266 --> 00:46:03,666
Heard she's kind of smart, too.
Astrology or somethin'.

701
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:05,930
- Astronomy.
- Yeah, right.

702
00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:07,938
God, we're gonna meet.
Really?

703
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:09,701
God.

704
00:46:09,775 --> 00:46:12,608
So what do I do?
What do I do?

705
00:46:12,678 --> 00:46:14,873
So what do I do?
How do I meet her?

706
00:46:14,946 --> 00:46:18,541
I don't know. How about if you walk up
to her on the street and say hello?

707
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,720
I'd have to talk to her then.

708
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:25,882
What are you talking about?

709
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:28,687
Look. Around you guys I can...
I don't know.

710
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,991
I can relax. I can be myself.
I'm funny. You know that.

711
00:46:32,064 --> 00:46:35,659
But get around women I get...
God, I get a little...

712
00:46:35,734 --> 00:46:37,759
It's not that
I don't like women, okay?

713
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,270
But I just get a little
nervous, that's all.

714
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,399
Okay, so get her
telephone number and call her.

715
00:46:43,475 --> 00:46:46,933
Pass. I'd have to talk to her
then for sure.

716
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,311
I wanted to talk to her the
other night real bad, but I didn't...

717
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:53,909
'cause that's how
I would've talk to her: Bad.

718
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:56,545
I see. In other words,
every time you meet a woman...

719
00:46:56,621 --> 00:47:01,251
with a little charm
and style and legs...

720
00:47:01,326 --> 00:47:03,453
you're gonna turn around
and run the other direction.

721
00:47:03,528 --> 00:47:06,622
That's a great idea.
In fact, that's brilliant.

722
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:13,863
- Tough game, ladies?
- We're just on our way there.

723
00:47:16,742 --> 00:47:19,176
Chris, you know
what carpe diem is?

724
00:47:19,244 --> 00:47:21,439
It's fish bait?

725
00:47:21,513 --> 00:47:24,914
It's Latin.
It means "seize the day."

726
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:27,417
It means there may not be
a tomorrow, so do it now...

727
00:47:27,486 --> 00:47:30,478
seek life while you're young,
while you've got the chance.

728
00:47:30,555 --> 00:47:32,682
You're tellin' me
to go after Roxanne, huh?

729
00:47:32,758 --> 00:47:34,692
No. I wouldn't.

730
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,251
I'd wait.
Mail her a letter.

731
00:47:39,598 --> 00:47:42,066
Okay, light the thing.
See how you do.

732
00:47:51,343 --> 00:47:54,972
Chief! C.D., come here!
I got it!

733
00:48:04,556 --> 00:48:07,684
- You got it, all right.
- How to talk to Roxanne.

734
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,727
You were right.
I'm gonna take a chance.

735
00:48:09,795 --> 00:48:12,093
Here's a girl who likes me,
so what am I afraid of her for?

736
00:48:12,164 --> 00:48:13,825
She's no rocket scientist.

737
00:48:13,899 --> 00:48:16,629
Actually, she is
a rocket scientist.

738
00:48:16,701 --> 00:48:18,134
Yeah, well.

739
00:48:18,203 --> 00:48:20,967
But out of all the guys
in this town, she likes me.

740
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,373
So who am I afraid of? Nothin'!
I'm gonna do what you said.

741
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,242
I'm gonna write her a letter.
I got a way with words.

742
00:48:28,313 --> 00:48:30,247
Ask these guys.
I'm always crackin' 'em up.

743
00:48:30,315 --> 00:48:33,148
You see, this way
I can plan out what to say.

744
00:48:33,218 --> 00:48:34,981
I can craft it.

745
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:38,819
In a letter I can be...
I can be effer-goddamn-vescent.

746
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,824
- Chief.
- There you go.

747
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:44,286
We can't get it started.

748
00:48:44,362 --> 00:48:46,296
I'II be out in a minute.

749
00:48:48,867 --> 00:48:50,926
Andy, your coat's on fire.

750
00:48:53,572 --> 00:48:55,972
So what do you think?

751
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:59,033
- He's on fire!
- Get his coat off!

752
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,704
- I got it!
- Not the gasoline!

753
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,416
- Hi, C.D.
- Hi, Cindy.

754
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,951
Can I help you?

755
00:49:07,018 --> 00:49:10,351
I have a friend who was
looking for a cosmetic...

756
00:49:10,422 --> 00:49:12,822
or wondering if one exists...

757
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:16,088
that's sort of a shading
type of an arrangement.

758
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,460
Do you have anything like that
that would be in a shading area?

759
00:49:19,531 --> 00:49:23,524
Well, we have lots
of blushes and things.

760
00:49:23,602 --> 00:49:25,763
What specifically is it for?

761
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:29,568
She has this feature
that she would like to...

762
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:32,542
you know, de-emphasize.

763
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:36,513
I see. She's got
this extra large feature...

764
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:39,277
and she wants something
to make it look a little smaller?

765
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,684
- Exactly.
- I think a dark contour would be fine.

766
00:49:42,754 --> 00:49:45,723
Great, great.
Now how would she go about...

767
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:49,226
you know, applying this...

768
00:49:50,395 --> 00:49:51,953
thing?

769
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,964
Well, she would...

770
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:59,159
She would just shade
the area of the feature...

771
00:49:59,237 --> 00:50:02,206
to make it appear that
there were more shadows...

772
00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:05,141
and less actual...

773
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,577
Well, less actual acreage.
I mean, area.

774
00:50:08,647 --> 00:50:10,911
- I'II take it.
- Okay.

775
00:50:10,982 --> 00:50:13,883
- I'll get a fresh one from the back.
- Thanks.

776
00:50:13,952 --> 00:50:15,544
Hi, Charlie.

777
00:50:17,756 --> 00:50:20,190
I talked to Chris for you.

778
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:23,059
Great.

779
00:50:23,995 --> 00:50:25,963
Do you think he's gonna
call me or something?

780
00:50:26,031 --> 00:50:28,295
He wants to
write you a letter.

781
00:50:30,802 --> 00:50:32,633
A letter?

782
00:50:32,704 --> 00:50:35,502
Isn't that usually what you get
at the end of a relationship?

783
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:39,271
No. Actually it's really romantic,
when you think about it.

784
00:50:39,344 --> 00:50:42,142
I'll explain it to you outside
if you want.

785
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:44,147
- Here's your blush.
- Great.

786
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:46,615
Could you gift-wrap that
for me please?

787
00:50:47,786 --> 00:50:50,755
Oh, and these items
I've decided against.

788
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:57,525
Got a girlfriend?

789
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:01,054
- It's for my sister.
- You have a sister?

790
00:51:01,132 --> 00:51:03,965
It's for my sister's girlfriend.

791
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:30,689
Hello?

792
00:51:30,762 --> 00:51:33,959
Hi, Chris.
No, I'm not doing anything.

793
00:51:34,032 --> 00:51:37,900
I was just...
I was just making some eggs.

794
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,870
Sure, come on over.
Okay, bye.

795
00:51:43,842 --> 00:51:46,208
I thought you should read
the letter before I send it.

796
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:47,938
Great.

797
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:50,811
We'II take a look at it.
Just one second.

798
00:51:50,882 --> 00:51:54,079
- Perfect.
- Quite an operation you have here.

799
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,086
Why, thank you.

800
00:51:57,856 --> 00:51:59,448
All right, let's see.

801
00:52:02,694 --> 00:52:05,629
- Let's take a look at that letter.
- I think it's really good.

802
00:52:07,465 --> 00:52:11,401
"Dear Roxanne, how's it going?
Want to have a drink sometime?

803
00:52:11,469 --> 00:52:14,029
If you do, check this box."

804
00:52:15,573 --> 00:52:19,407
- Well?
- How long did you work on this?

805
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:22,412
Well, today, you know,
since noon.

806
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,913
Noon.

807
00:52:25,483 --> 00:52:27,883
That's a very long time.

808
00:52:27,952 --> 00:52:30,853
- You can't send her this.
- What do you mean?

809
00:52:30,922 --> 00:52:34,323
It's a good concept, but I think
for her it's gotta be more interesting.

810
00:52:34,392 --> 00:52:36,690
- I worked hard on that.
- Take a pen.

811
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:39,889
Take a pen and sit down.
Just let me ask you a question.

812
00:52:39,964 --> 00:52:41,693
How do you feel about her?

813
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:43,597
Me? About her?

814
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:45,727
How did you feel
when you first saw her?

815
00:52:47,105 --> 00:52:48,663
Horny.

816
00:52:51,076 --> 00:52:54,375
But you can't say, "I felt horny."
You have to change it a little.

817
00:52:54,446 --> 00:52:58,109
You have to say,
"I felt moved."

818
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,879
"Alive."

819
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,680
"On fire."

820
00:53:03,755 --> 00:53:05,518
That's beautiful.

821
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:08,286
How did you feel
when you first spoke to her?

822
00:53:09,294 --> 00:53:11,489
Like a dickhead.

823
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,293
No, you can't write,
"I felt like a dickhead."

824
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:16,697
You have to say,
"I felt like...

825
00:53:16,768 --> 00:53:21,137
a child standing in the sun
for the first time...

826
00:53:21,206 --> 00:53:23,504
feeling only your radiance."

827
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:26,970
Radiance.
I like that.

828
00:53:27,045 --> 00:53:29,013
I'm gonna underline that.

829
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,640
Now, what did you do
after you saw her?

830
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,447
I puked.

831
00:53:39,557 --> 00:53:41,491
"After seeing you...

832
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,994
my only nourishment was you."

833
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,366
- C.D., you write the letter.
- You're doing good.

834
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:54,064
You know how to say what I feel.
You write it and I'll sign it.

835
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:55,834
- No, that's...
- What?

836
00:53:56,608 --> 00:54:00,009
That's dangerous.
That's lying.

837
00:54:00,078 --> 00:54:02,046
Not if you write what I feel.

838
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,206
Look, I'll just sign my name...

839
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,716
and you write to Roxanne
what you imagine I'm feeling.

840
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:10,516
- It'll work.
- What I would imagine you're feeling?

841
00:54:10,588 --> 00:54:12,647
It's practically
half-written already.

842
00:54:12,724 --> 00:54:16,319
You'd have to change that.
That's just, you know, poetic baloney.

843
00:54:16,394 --> 00:54:19,158
- This is beautiful.
- No, no.

844
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,495
For Roxanne,
you need something startling...

845
00:54:22,567 --> 00:54:25,593
something so strange...

846
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:29,197
that it would make her
incapable of being reasonable.

847
00:54:29,274 --> 00:54:31,799
- Think you can do it?
- It would be an interesting challenge.

848
00:54:31,876 --> 00:54:34,743
- You need a good pen.
- Get your favorite pen.

849
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,873
These are good.
These are good. All right.

850
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:40,179
And some good paper,
a quality...

851
00:54:40,251 --> 00:54:43,152
that really takes the ink.

852
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:45,883
- Oh, the food!
- I'm taking care of that.

853
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:47,891
You just take your time.

854
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:16,479
Come on, boys.
Get in there. Line up.

855
00:55:20,925 --> 00:55:23,393
- Come on.
- I'm here.

856
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:25,793
Come on, Mayor.

857
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,128
Six and a half minutes.
That's not bad.

858
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,928
- Let's get into our gear.
- Fast!

859
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,235
Fast!

860
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,507
Let's go, boys.
It's Operation Snowball!

861
00:55:40,578 --> 00:55:42,409
Snowball!

862
00:55:43,648 --> 00:55:45,946
Snowball!

863
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,449
Take the truck!

864
00:55:58,029 --> 00:55:59,963
Hey, come here!

865
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:08,934
- Snowball!
- Come on!

866
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:12,343
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

867
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,604
Give me a hand!

868
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,817
Oh, God.

869
00:56:28,893 --> 00:56:30,884
Ralston!

870
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,512
He's coming!

871
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:03,650
C. D! Hi, C. D!

872
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:08,461
How're you doin' there, Chief?
All's well that ends well, right?

873
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:15,639
Boys? Boys! The ladder's up.

874
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,039
Wait, boys!
The ladder's up!

875
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:22,875
The ladder is up! Boys!

876
00:57:22,947 --> 00:57:25,575
Wait! Wait! Wait!

877
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,325
Let me show you a double binary.

878
00:57:45,403 --> 00:57:47,496
Focus with that thing there.

879
00:57:48,606 --> 00:57:51,040
You'll see it.
I'm on a schedule.

880
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,804
- Oh, yeah.
- Roxanne, what's a light year?

881
00:57:54,879 --> 00:57:57,814
Same as a regular year,
only it has less calories.

882
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,121
- What is it?
- It's actually two pairs of stars...

883
00:58:05,189 --> 00:58:09,558
revolving around each other, but
they're so far away they look like one.

884
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,352
What keeps them together?

885
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,523
Mutual attraction.

886
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:16,499
That's fairly romantic.

887
00:58:19,137 --> 00:58:23,096
"Strange attractors in my window
of possible movement."

888
00:58:23,174 --> 00:58:24,869
Say again.

889
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:28,139
"Passionate kisses
I hope you'll read with your lips."

890
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:31,641
Sorry.

891
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,116
Just something from a letter I got.

892
00:58:34,185 --> 00:58:35,948
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

893
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,851
An amazing letter.

894
00:58:37,922 --> 00:58:39,480
You liked it?

895
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:42,321
No, I didn't like it.
I loved it.

896
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,496
- Whose letter?
- Chris.

897
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,225
He can write?

898
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:49,891
I'm melting.

899
00:58:51,269 --> 00:58:53,760
Let me show you
that dumbbell nebula.

900
00:58:57,175 --> 00:58:59,405
There's something I don't get.

901
00:58:59,477 --> 00:59:01,911
Here's a guy
who dodges me for days.

902
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:03,913
So I figure
he's not interested...

903
00:59:03,981 --> 00:59:06,779
but C.D. Tells me
he wants to write me a letter.

904
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:10,446
I figure it's gonna be
about why he won't talk to me...

905
00:59:10,521 --> 00:59:12,421
but it's not.

906
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,754
It was strange and...

907
00:59:14,826 --> 00:59:16,851
intelligent...

908
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,520
and sexual.

909
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:23,427
Why is he writing?
He only lives a block and a half away.

910
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,201
What do you want me to do?
Ask him out for you?

911
00:59:34,979 --> 00:59:35,012
She wants a date?

912
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:36,639
She wants a date?

913
00:59:38,282 --> 00:59:41,615
- C.D., it's all because of you!
- Hey, hey, hey! Come on!

914
00:59:51,596 --> 00:59:54,394
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

915
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,524
- She wants to see me tonight?
- Yeah.

916
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:58,728
I can't see her tonight.

917
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:01,499
- I'm dying already. It's only 3:00.
- Just relax.

918
01:00:01,572 --> 01:00:03,267
Relax. You're all right.

919
01:00:03,341 --> 01:00:06,640
You gotta help me.
If I talk to her, I'll die.

920
01:00:08,212 --> 01:00:11,477
I'll give you something to memorize,
then you can just say it.

921
01:00:11,549 --> 01:00:12,982
I can't memorize it.

922
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:15,575
- You can memorize it.
- I can't!

923
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:18,679
Say the "Pledge of Allegiance."
You memorized that, didn't you? Come on.

924
01:00:18,756 --> 01:00:20,553
I got your hand.

925
01:00:21,893 --> 01:00:25,329
"I pledge allegiance to the flag of..."

926
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,698
Which country?
I don't know. I'm nervous.

927
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:32,793
We're gonna think of something now.

928
01:00:40,378 --> 01:00:42,209
Oh, boy.

929
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:48,677
No letter this time.
Just face to face.

930
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,123
You want to sit outside?

931
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:56,683
Do I want to sit outside? Yes.

932
01:00:56,761 --> 01:00:58,661
Here?

933
01:00:58,729 --> 01:01:01,789
Here on the porch?
Yes. Yes.

934
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,357
- Great.
- We can sit right here.

935
01:01:04,435 --> 01:01:05,868
Great.

936
01:01:10,942 --> 01:01:12,876
It's a lovely evening.

937
01:01:14,078 --> 01:01:16,478
Oh, yes.

938
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,811
It is an exquisite evening...

939
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,783
filled with...

940
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:23,547
mysterious portents...

941
01:01:23,621 --> 01:01:25,213
magic...

942
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:27,154
and romance.

943
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,194
Why are you wearing that hat?

944
01:01:31,262 --> 01:01:33,560
Why?

945
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:35,531
Why... Because...

946
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,727
Don't panic. Stay calm.

947
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:45,201
Because tonight I am a hunter.

948
01:01:46,043 --> 01:01:49,274
Because tonight I am a hunter...

949
01:01:49,347 --> 01:01:52,043
hunting for words.

950
01:01:52,116 --> 01:01:53,913
That's good. That's okay.

951
01:01:53,985 --> 01:01:55,953
Am I your prey?

952
01:01:56,921 --> 01:02:00,652
Yes, but not a defenseless one.

953
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:03,350
Yes...

954
01:02:03,427 --> 01:02:05,725
but not a defenseless one...

955
01:02:05,796 --> 01:02:07,354
not a rabbit.

956
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:11,197
You are a lioness.

957
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,468
Alert and sensitive.

958
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:17,131
Alert...

959
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:19,005
and sensitive...

960
01:02:19,076 --> 01:02:20,976
to every misstep.

961
01:02:21,045 --> 01:02:23,240
I see.

962
01:02:23,314 --> 01:02:25,248
Get ready to move closer to her.

963
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,376
Therefore, I must move silently.

964
01:02:30,521 --> 01:02:33,081
Moving in toward you.

965
01:02:33,157 --> 01:02:34,624
Reach out your hand.

966
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:38,925
My hand out reaching to...

967
01:02:38,996 --> 01:02:42,056
Car 3. Car 3.
Proceed to the 279.

968
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,725
What?

969
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:47,396
Car 3, do you confirm?

970
01:02:47,471 --> 01:02:49,268
- Confirm what?
- Confirm...

971
01:02:51,542 --> 01:02:54,170
Confirm my feelings.
Confirm my feelings.

972
01:02:55,246 --> 01:02:57,578
Confirm my feelings.

973
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,240
Yes.

974
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:05,211
Because there is a heart here...

975
01:03:05,289 --> 01:03:07,917
that wants yours to know...

976
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:11,223
- that there's a possible 502 on Main.
- What?

977
01:03:11,295 --> 01:03:14,287
Proceed to Main. Confirm.

978
01:03:24,308 --> 01:03:26,242
You're not a hunter anymore?

979
01:03:27,411 --> 01:03:29,140
Not a hunter?

980
01:03:29,213 --> 01:03:30,771
No.

981
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,611
I mean, yeah.

982
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:37,082
It's really nice out, isn't it?

983
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,020
It's really, really, really...

984
01:03:40,091 --> 01:03:42,150
What's the word I'm lookin' for?

985
01:03:42,226 --> 01:03:44,922
Nice. Nice out.

986
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:46,929
Yeah, nice. That's it.

987
01:03:46,997 --> 01:03:49,022
So now you're the weatherman?

988
01:03:55,272 --> 01:03:57,206
I loved your letter.

989
01:03:57,274 --> 01:03:59,208
It was beautiful.

990
01:03:59,276 --> 01:04:01,608
Where'd you learn to write like that?

991
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:03,806
The usual places.

992
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:06,247
It seemed very extemporaneous.

993
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,520
Thank you.

994
01:04:10,588 --> 01:04:14,149
Say something, something wonderful
like in your letter.

995
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,693
Well, let's see.

996
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:19,559
I know, you can tell me
about the night.

997
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,495
The night...

998
01:04:21,565 --> 01:04:23,931
is very extemporaneous.

999
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:25,263
What?

1000
01:04:25,336 --> 01:04:26,963
This is wild.

1001
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:28,732
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1002
01:04:28,806 --> 01:04:32,606
The night is wild,
like love can be wild.

1003
01:04:32,676 --> 01:04:35,406
Love is wild,
wild and extemporaneous.

1004
01:04:36,514 --> 01:04:38,243
Yes.

1005
01:04:39,316 --> 01:04:41,307
Say something romantic.

1006
01:04:41,385 --> 01:04:43,819
Romantic.

1007
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:47,316
"Why do birds suddenly appear...

1008
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:50,155
every time you are near?"

1009
01:04:50,227 --> 01:04:52,422
Isn't that from a song?

1010
01:04:52,496 --> 01:04:56,762
- Well, they made it into a song.
- You wrote the song?

1011
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,861
No.

1012
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:02,667
But I like that song.
I like it.

1013
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:09,145
You use your own words.

1014
01:05:12,183 --> 01:05:13,810
You...

1015
01:05:13,884 --> 01:05:16,182
You have...

1016
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:18,483
a great body.

1017
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,248
Your knockers...

1018
01:05:21,325 --> 01:05:25,022
No, not your knockers, your breasts.
Your breasts are like melons.

1019
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:28,792
Not melons. Like pillows.

1020
01:05:28,866 --> 01:05:31,027
Can I fluff your pillows?

1021
01:05:32,336 --> 01:05:34,270
- I have to go in now.
- Wait!

1022
01:05:34,338 --> 01:05:35,930
- June '85.
- What?

1023
01:05:36,006 --> 01:05:38,941
Weren't you the Playmate of the Month?
June '85?

1024
01:05:42,112 --> 01:05:43,909
Oh, shit!

1025
01:05:48,052 --> 01:05:50,043
"Can I fluff your pillows"?

1026
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,088
I got flustered.
I panicked.

1027
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:54,989
You gotta help me.
She wanted me. It was working.

1028
01:05:55,059 --> 01:05:57,323
I don't think I could after that.

1029
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:02,094
She wants somebody that looks like me
and talks like you.

1030
01:06:10,941 --> 01:06:12,738
Wait a minute.

1031
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:16,302
- Forget it.
- No. Hey, come here.

1032
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,611
- Come here. Come on.
- Don't make me do it.

1033
01:06:19,683 --> 01:06:23,619
You stand here under the window.
I'll be there out of sight.

1034
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:25,314
I'll whisper to you what to say.

1035
01:06:25,389 --> 01:06:28,085
Wait, wait, wait.
What if she hears you?

1036
01:06:28,158 --> 01:06:29,591
Just go. Go.

1037
01:06:32,429 --> 01:06:34,863
No. Here. Use this.

1038
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:42,364
Can't you go easy for once?

1039
01:06:42,439 --> 01:06:45,567
Goddamn it! What in the hell
do you think you're doing?

1040
01:06:45,643 --> 01:06:47,440
I'm sorry! Hold on!

1041
01:06:47,511 --> 01:06:49,775
Listen to me.
I got a lot to say.

1042
01:06:49,847 --> 01:06:51,838
Go away!

1043
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:54,350
Just wait!
I just want to tell you that...

1044
01:06:54,418 --> 01:06:56,249
Tell me what?
That I'm really built?

1045
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,981
No, nothing like...

1046
01:06:59,256 --> 01:07:02,453
- Tell her you were an idiot.
- I was an idiot.

1047
01:07:02,526 --> 01:07:04,357
You bet you were!

1048
01:07:04,428 --> 01:07:07,158
Come here! Wait. Stop.

1049
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:08,755
C.D., help me.

1050
01:07:08,832 --> 01:07:10,197
I want to say...

1051
01:07:10,267 --> 01:07:14,203
Yeah, I was an idiot.
You're right. I was really...

1052
01:07:14,271 --> 01:07:16,000
Happy? Dizzy?

1053
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,402
Oh, thirsty! Thirsty.

1054
01:07:19,476 --> 01:07:20,773
This is stupid!

1055
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:24,807
Stupid! Stupid!
Yeah, I was stupid...

1056
01:07:24,882 --> 01:07:27,248
and I was also...

1057
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,583
Tripping? Bumbling!

1058
01:07:31,722 --> 01:07:35,954
I was a stupid, bumbling pointer.

1059
01:07:36,894 --> 01:07:38,054
Pointer?

1060
01:07:38,128 --> 01:07:40,096
No, no! Stupid...

1061
01:07:40,164 --> 01:07:43,622
I mean, stupid ass. Yeah.

1062
01:07:43,701 --> 01:07:45,794
So why'd you say those things?

1063
01:07:45,869 --> 01:07:47,803
Why'd I say those things?

1064
01:07:47,871 --> 01:07:51,671
- Tell her you were afraid.
- Because I was afraid.

1065
01:07:51,742 --> 01:07:56,008
Of me? What do you mean you were afraid?
You were afraid of what?

1066
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,310
Tell her you were afraid of words.

1067
01:07:58,382 --> 01:08:01,044
- What, what, what?
- Words.

1068
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:04,485
Because I was afraid
of worms, Roxanne. Worms!

1069
01:08:05,756 --> 01:08:07,849
Worms?

1070
01:08:07,925 --> 01:08:09,825
What are you saying to me?

1071
01:08:09,893 --> 01:08:11,224
Come here.

1072
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:14,457
Worms? Did I say "worms"?

1073
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:17,056
I meant "words," Roxanne.

1074
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:20,661
This is too hard.
Give me your coat. Words!

1075
01:08:20,738 --> 01:08:23,536
They're all used up.
They're hard to say.

1076
01:08:23,607 --> 01:08:27,065
They've all been wasted... give it
to me... on shampoo commercials...

1077
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:30,773
and the ads and the flavorings.

1078
01:08:30,848 --> 01:08:32,679
All those beautiful words.

1079
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,514
I mean, how can you love a floor wax?

1080
01:08:35,586 --> 01:08:38,350
- What?
- How can you love a diaper?

1081
01:08:38,422 --> 01:08:43,382
How can I use the same word about you
that someone else uses about a stuffing?

1082
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,987
I'm exploding with love for you
and I can't use the word.

1083
01:08:47,064 --> 01:08:48,656
I can't hear you.

1084
01:08:48,732 --> 01:08:51,724
It's because my words
have to rise up...

1085
01:08:51,802 --> 01:08:54,703
and they're having trouble
finding you.

1086
01:08:54,772 --> 01:08:57,206
You're not having trouble
hearing me.

1087
01:08:57,274 --> 01:08:59,469
Well, your voice floats down.

1088
01:08:59,543 --> 01:09:01,135
But be careful.

1089
01:09:01,211 --> 01:09:03,907
One hard word from you
at that height kills me.

1090
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:06,006
Give me your hat.

1091
01:09:07,084 --> 01:09:08,346
Shut up.

1092
01:09:09,486 --> 01:09:11,420
Your voice sounds different.

1093
01:09:14,992 --> 01:09:16,789
Of course it's different.

1094
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:19,226
I don't have
to be careful anymore.

1095
01:09:19,296 --> 01:09:22,288
I'm protected by the night.

1096
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:24,960
I can be myself, Roxanne.

1097
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:28,368
Oh, God, your name
is like a knife.

1098
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:31,272
- Shit.
- Stand where I can see you.

1099
01:09:31,341 --> 01:09:33,275
Why?

1100
01:09:33,343 --> 01:09:36,506
My voice. Only my voice.

1101
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,879
You don't need to see me.
Just listen to me.

1102
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:42,885
I know I only have a minute here
to talk to you.

1103
01:09:42,953 --> 01:09:46,150
I was just wondering
if what I wrote to you touched you.

1104
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:47,986
It did.

1105
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:51,856
It was eloquent.

1106
01:09:51,929 --> 01:09:54,864
Oh, no, not eloquent...

1107
01:09:54,932 --> 01:09:56,729
just honest.

1108
01:09:57,835 --> 01:09:59,268
See...

1109
01:10:00,504 --> 01:10:02,665
I am in orbit around you.

1110
01:10:03,907 --> 01:10:06,398
I'm suspended, weightless,
over you...

1111
01:10:06,477 --> 01:10:10,106
like the blue man in the Chagall...

1112
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,774
just hovering...

1113
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:15,546
hanging over you
in a delirious kiss.

1114
01:10:17,621 --> 01:10:20,146
Yesterday on the street...

1115
01:10:20,224 --> 01:10:22,158
I swore I heard your name.

1116
01:10:22,226 --> 01:10:24,319
I swore I heard someone say it...

1117
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:27,795
and I turned
and there was nobody there...

1118
01:10:27,865 --> 01:10:30,629
just five birds
rising off the ground.

1119
01:10:30,701 --> 01:10:33,261
And when their wings hit the air...

1120
01:10:33,337 --> 01:10:35,362
I heard your name again.

1121
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:38,340
Just for that second,
I was one of them...

1122
01:10:38,408 --> 01:10:40,968
pounding out your name... Roxanne.

1123
01:10:42,179 --> 01:10:44,170
Roxanne:

1124
01:10:44,248 --> 01:10:48,981
A word of two syllables
locked inside my head.

1125
01:10:50,921 --> 01:10:53,321
You see...

1126
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:57,121
I am, and I will always be...

1127
01:10:59,196 --> 01:11:02,324
the one who loved you
without limits.

1128
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:06,165
What are you talkin' about?
It's too much.

1129
01:11:06,236 --> 01:11:08,033
Go on.

1130
01:11:08,105 --> 01:11:10,164
It's working. Go on! Go on!

1131
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:17,405
This is my whole life right now...

1132
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:21,383
standing here,
talking to you like this...

1133
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:24,852
saying things I've wanted to say
but couldn't.

1134
01:11:24,922 --> 01:11:27,686
Why couldn't you talk to me?

1135
01:11:27,758 --> 01:11:31,159
Because I was afraid
of having you laugh at me.

1136
01:11:31,228 --> 01:11:32,923
That's so silly.

1137
01:11:32,996 --> 01:11:35,692
No. No, no, not if you knew.

1138
01:11:35,766 --> 01:11:39,167
When you're reaching for a star,
there's a long way to fall.

1139
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:43,330
I almost never let
this moment happen.

1140
01:11:43,407 --> 01:11:47,673
And now I feel sorry for people
for whom it never comes.

1141
01:11:50,314 --> 01:11:52,111
I love you.

1142
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:54,412
I have breathed you in...

1143
01:11:54,484 --> 01:11:57,078
and I am suffocating.

1144
01:11:57,154 --> 01:11:59,019
I am crazy.

1145
01:11:59,089 --> 01:12:02,889
I can't go on.
This is all too much!

1146
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,320
I'm starting to feel
a little dizzy.

1147
01:12:06,396 --> 01:12:09,797
And I'm starting to feel
a little drunk...

1148
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,233
because I have made you tremble
up there.

1149
01:12:12,302 --> 01:12:14,497
And you are trembling, aren't you?

1150
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:18,538
Like a leaf on a tree.

1151
01:12:19,643 --> 01:12:22,077
- I want to make love to you.
- Shut up, Chris!

1152
01:12:22,145 --> 01:12:23,703
What?

1153
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:29,714
I was telling myself to shut up...

1154
01:12:29,786 --> 01:12:32,846
because this time
I've gone too far.

1155
01:12:33,957 --> 01:12:36,221
I'll tell you
when you've gone too far.

1156
01:12:36,293 --> 01:12:38,818
She wants us!

1157
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:41,797
Lookit, C.D., it's okay.

1158
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:44,060
Sooner or later.

1159
01:12:44,134 --> 01:12:45,897
You can do it.

1160
01:12:45,969 --> 01:12:48,028
Come on. Come on.

1161
01:12:48,105 --> 01:12:50,437
Come on, C.D. Do it.

1162
01:12:52,643 --> 01:12:55,612
Don't think I don't know you.

1163
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,307
Don't think I haven't felt you
beneath me.

1164
01:12:58,382 --> 01:13:00,247
I know you've imagined it.

1165
01:13:00,317 --> 01:13:04,276
You have, haven't you,
lying back into your bed with me?

1166
01:13:06,056 --> 01:13:08,286
I have.

1167
01:13:08,358 --> 01:13:12,351
There will never be
another tonight, Roxanne.

1168
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:16,957
Why should we sip from a teacup
when we can drink from the river?

1169
01:13:18,568 --> 01:13:21,537
There's a tiny word.

1170
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,334
It's not a noun.

1171
01:13:23,407 --> 01:13:26,205
It's not a verb.
It's not an adjective.

1172
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:28,335
I don't know what it is...

1173
01:13:28,412 --> 01:13:33,008
but if you said it to me tonight,
all this blackness would go away...

1174
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:37,417
and you and I would be connected
by a tunnel of light.

1175
01:13:39,823 --> 01:13:41,415
What is the word, Chris?

1176
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,652
"Yes."

1177
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:04,371
Great. We did it.
We did it!

1178
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:12,012
We were great.

1179
01:14:14,057 --> 01:14:15,922
I think I'm in love.

1180
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,429
Oh, God, I did it.

1181
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:23,690
Oh, shit, I did it!

1182
01:14:26,236 --> 01:14:28,363
Oh, God.

1183
01:14:30,607 --> 01:14:32,541
It's two minutes to "Dallas."

1184
01:14:35,112 --> 01:14:38,138
Are you all right?

1185
01:14:38,215 --> 01:14:40,706
- Where am I?
- You're in Nelson.

1186
01:14:40,784 --> 01:14:42,274
Nelson?

1187
01:14:42,352 --> 01:14:44,252
Why, I'm home.

1188
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:47,415
They brought me home. Bye.

1189
01:14:47,491 --> 01:14:50,051
- What day is it?
- Friday. "Dallas" is on.

1190
01:14:50,127 --> 01:14:54,359
Friday? Then it took no time.
It didn't exist in time.

1191
01:14:54,431 --> 01:14:56,626
- What?
- The spacecraft.

1192
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,635
I was walking along. A spacecraft
landed right in front of me.

1193
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:03,366
- Tell us.
- I read about this. Did it have lights?

1194
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,965
Lights?
You never saw so many lights.

1195
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:08,944
It was like Broadway.
Then this door opened.

1196
01:15:09,012 --> 01:15:11,606
A creature came out,
had big suckers on his palms.

1197
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:13,512
He walked like this.

1198
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:18,316
Then he took his palms,
put 'em right on my face.

1199
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:21,551
Took me over to Roxanne's house.
He said they wanted to observe me.

1200
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:24,219
- At Roxanne's house?
- That's where they are, right now!

1201
01:15:24,294 --> 01:15:27,559
This is bullshit. We'll miss "Dallas."
Come on. Let's go.

1202
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:32,761
- You think I'm nuts, don't you?
- No!

1203
01:15:32,836 --> 01:15:35,202
They wanted to ask me
about older women.

1204
01:15:35,272 --> 01:15:37,968
- Why?
- They wanted to have sex with them.

1205
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:40,236
- Where?
- Here! Right here in Nelson.

1206
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:42,574
They wanted to start
a colony of supermen...

1207
01:15:42,646 --> 01:15:45,911
who would have sex with older women
because they said, and I quote...

1208
01:15:45,982 --> 01:15:48,507
- "They really know what they're doing."
- We do!

1209
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:50,519
- It's been so long.
- Girls!

1210
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:53,351
Do you actually believe there are
creatures from outer space...

1211
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:56,221
who want to have sex
with older women?

1212
01:15:57,828 --> 01:16:00,763
- Let's go and check it out.
- Oh, dear!

1213
01:16:10,874 --> 01:16:12,307
Testing.

1214
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:14,309
Hello.

1215
01:16:16,746 --> 01:16:19,806
Hello. Testing, testing.

1216
01:16:19,883 --> 01:16:21,817
God, I was nervous last night.

1217
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:24,648
Uncomfortable, I don't know.

1218
01:16:24,721 --> 01:16:27,554
Believe me, I didn't say anything.
I'm too dumb...

1219
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:30,218
I'm too smart for that.

1220
01:16:30,293 --> 01:16:33,854
Yeah. What do you mean, nervous?
How nervous?

1221
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:35,693
I was real nervous.
Yeah, nervous.

1222
01:16:35,765 --> 01:16:37,198
Real nervous?

1223
01:16:37,267 --> 01:16:40,134
Can I ask you
to stop the noise, please?

1224
01:16:40,203 --> 01:16:44,139
You mean, you know,
so nervous that you couldn't...

1225
01:16:46,009 --> 01:16:49,172
God, come on, you know.
It's embarrassing enough.

1226
01:16:51,448 --> 01:16:53,211
Okay, look.

1227
01:16:53,283 --> 01:16:57,049
I couldn't...
I couldn't do it the third time.

1228
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,419
Hello. This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1229
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:03,687
Let Oktoberfest begin!

1230
01:17:07,364 --> 01:17:10,731
This damn town.
You can't get anything going. Shit!

1231
01:17:13,436 --> 01:17:15,233
- Looks nice.
- C.D. In?

1232
01:17:15,305 --> 01:17:16,738
Yeah.

1233
01:17:20,343 --> 01:17:22,607
Yeah. Here.

1234
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:26,342
- I'm catching a plane in 20 minutes.
- Why?

1235
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:30,853
I got a call from the university.
I was right about the comet.

1236
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:33,947
- That's fantastic!
- I wanted to tell you first.

1237
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:36,458
You're the one person
who could appreciate it.

1238
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:38,551
Congratulations.
That's great!

1239
01:17:38,628 --> 01:17:40,562
You're famous.

1240
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:43,895
- Is Chris around?
- No, I haven't seen him.

1241
01:17:43,967 --> 01:17:47,300
Well, maybe you can tell him
where I am.

1242
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:50,305
I'm gonna be gone about a week.
Here's my address.

1243
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:53,636
- Ask him to write me.
- All right.

1244
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:57,339
- And tell him to knock me over.
- Yeah.

1245
01:17:58,615 --> 01:18:00,549
I was walking on air.

1246
01:18:00,617 --> 01:18:05,384
Now I'm walking on feathers
on pillows on air.

1247
01:18:05,455 --> 01:18:07,753
- Bye.
- G'bye.

1248
01:18:11,828 --> 01:18:13,455
- Beer?
- Yeah.

1249
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:15,395
- Draft?
- Yeah, a little bit.

1250
01:18:15,465 --> 01:18:18,559
It's okay.
I can put on my sweater if I get...

1251
01:18:20,971 --> 01:18:22,563
That's really funny.

1252
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:26,473
You can get so many guys in here
with no sense of humor at all.

1253
01:18:28,778 --> 01:18:32,009
I think a sense of humor's
really important, don't you?

1254
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:34,516
Yeah, I think it's real important.

1255
01:18:38,822 --> 01:18:40,756
One hand of lowball for your drink.

1256
01:18:40,824 --> 01:18:43,190
What's lowball?

1257
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,820
You try and get the worst hand.

1258
01:18:48,565 --> 01:18:50,499
A lowball for a highball.

1259
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,862
You're a riot.

1260
01:18:59,442 --> 01:19:01,501
You could be a dealer in Vegas.

1261
01:19:01,578 --> 01:19:04,376
I know, 'cause I went to Tahoe
with a girlfriend of mine.

1262
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:07,075
- We're moving there in three days.
- Yeah?

1263
01:19:08,351 --> 01:19:11,809
See, they like
young cocktail waitresses there...

1264
01:19:11,888 --> 01:19:14,049
and you can make big money.

1265
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:17,651
I heard one girl got a $10,000 tip
from a gambler that got lucky.

1266
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:19,388
- Ten grand?
- Ten grand.

1267
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,454
That'd be nice.

1268
01:19:22,532 --> 01:19:25,296
Then when I'm older,
I'll probably move to Reno...

1269
01:19:25,368 --> 01:19:27,996
where they like
older cocktail waitresses.

1270
01:19:28,071 --> 01:19:30,904
Besides, it's only 60 miles away.

1271
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:32,566
What do ya got?

1272
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:36,806
I got a nine, a seven, a five,
a three and a deuce.

1273
01:19:38,048 --> 01:19:41,381
That's the worst hand I ever saw.

1274
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:43,043
You win.

1275
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:50,592
- Where you from?
- Albuquerque.

1276
01:19:51,728 --> 01:19:54,128
A-L-B-U-Q-U-E-R-Q-U-E.

1277
01:19:55,432 --> 01:19:57,229
It's an old bar bet.

1278
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,427
- Really?
- Yeah.

1279
01:19:59,502 --> 01:20:02,403
- Know where I really wanna go?
- Where?

1280
01:20:02,472 --> 01:20:04,667
- San Francisco.
- I've been there.

1281
01:20:04,741 --> 01:20:06,936
You've been there? Really?
What's it like?

1282
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:09,501
It's great.
I'm really a 49ers fan.

1283
01:20:09,579 --> 01:20:11,740
Not so much the Giants, though.

1284
01:20:11,815 --> 01:20:14,181
And the redwoods,
oh, you should see 'em.

1285
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:17,617
I just like to go there and just be.

1286
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:20,622
I always take a meat sandwich
with me when I go.

1287
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:24,282
I think it's so great
you've traveled.

1288
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:26,955
- You're really interesting.
- I try to be.

1289
01:20:28,698 --> 01:20:31,496
I think when one person finds
another person interesting...

1290
01:20:31,568 --> 01:20:34,366
then they become interesting
to that person.

1291
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:37,969
You see Roxanne, don't you?

1292
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,601
Well, kind of, but not...

1293
01:20:40,677 --> 01:20:43,976
Yeah, I better quit talking to you.
She's kind of a friend of mine.

1294
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:46,811
We can talk.
That's no problem.

1295
01:20:50,553 --> 01:20:53,317
Next, you're going to tell me
you've been to New York.

1296
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:56,985
- I've been to New York.
- I was just kidding. You really have?

1297
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,550
- Yeah.
- God.

1298
01:20:58,628 --> 01:21:00,391
My name's Chris.

1299
01:21:00,463 --> 01:21:01,896
I know.

1300
01:21:02,966 --> 01:21:04,399
I'm Sandy.

1301
01:21:04,467 --> 01:21:07,459
- It's good to meet you.
- Thanks.

1302
01:21:07,537 --> 01:21:09,232
There we go.

1303
01:21:09,305 --> 01:21:11,170
Yeah.

1304
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:12,765
Come on.

1305
01:21:12,842 --> 01:21:14,332
Yeah. Here we go.

1306
01:21:15,478 --> 01:21:16,911
Yeah.

1307
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:21,747
You love the little birdies so much,
you give them this to perch on.

1308
01:21:29,692 --> 01:21:31,319
All right.

1309
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:48,934
- How're you doin'?
- Good. How are you?

1310
01:21:49,012 --> 01:21:50,775
Fine. See ya.

1311
01:21:50,847 --> 01:21:52,439
Bye, C.D.

1312
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,286
Hey, hi! How you doin'?

1313
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,225
Pretty good.

1314
01:22:34,757 --> 01:22:36,190
Hey, Chief!

1315
01:22:56,079 --> 01:22:57,876
Thanks for the help, ladies.

1316
01:23:18,801 --> 01:23:20,393
What's up?

1317
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:22,904
Oh, fine. I mean, nothing.

1318
01:23:22,972 --> 01:23:24,633
Nothing is up.

1319
01:23:25,441 --> 01:23:27,773
Want anything to drink?

1320
01:23:27,844 --> 01:23:31,712
Yeah, but if I ask for another one,
give it to me.

1321
01:23:33,983 --> 01:23:37,749
Ralston, could you bring us
a bottle of wine, please?

1322
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:39,412
Yeah.

1323
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:42,287
All right.

1324
01:23:42,358 --> 01:23:45,623
What can you sit on, sleep on
and brush your teeth with?

1325
01:23:45,695 --> 01:23:47,754
- Huh?
- It's a riddle.

1326
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:51,425
What can you sit on, sleep on
and brush your teeth with?

1327
01:23:53,169 --> 01:23:55,364
I don't know.

1328
01:23:55,438 --> 01:23:59,238
A chair, a bed and a toothbrush.

1329
01:23:59,309 --> 01:24:01,937
Your wine, right here.

1330
01:24:02,011 --> 01:24:04,138
- Chief.
- Thanks.

1331
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:08,240
What's the point?

1332
01:24:08,318 --> 01:24:12,846
The point is that sometimes the answer
is so obvious that you don't see it.

1333
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:16,153
It's as plain
as the nose on your face.

1334
01:24:16,225 --> 01:24:17,920
You should tell her.

1335
01:24:19,329 --> 01:24:21,263
Tell who what?

1336
01:24:22,165 --> 01:24:24,998
Tell Roxanne that you love her.

1337
01:24:32,175 --> 01:24:35,144
- Actually, I already told her.
- You did?

1338
01:24:35,211 --> 01:24:38,612
Last week.
I made love to her.

1339
01:24:38,681 --> 01:24:40,308
Well, great!

1340
01:24:40,383 --> 01:24:42,874
It wasn't actually me.
It was sort of me.

1341
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:45,921
But I was the one who said
all the right things...

1342
01:24:45,989 --> 01:24:49,686
and I made her feel the right way.

1343
01:24:49,759 --> 01:24:51,750
It just wasn't the actual me...

1344
01:24:51,828 --> 01:24:55,491
who did the honors.

1345
01:24:57,433 --> 01:24:58,866
Well...

1346
01:25:00,703 --> 01:25:03,228
This is the deadest place
I've ever seen.

1347
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:06,070
Dixie, have you been serving
that tripe quiche again?

1348
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:08,804
How come you're not wearing your fur?
I thought you were off tonight.

1349
01:25:08,878 --> 01:25:11,108
Chris asked me to stand in for him.

1350
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:13,512
He picked up Roxanne at 6:30.

1351
01:25:15,785 --> 01:25:18,219
I've got tell him about the letter!

1352
01:25:29,632 --> 01:25:32,100
I don't know what that was.

1353
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:35,228
- Hi, guys!
- Hey, Andy. How you doin'?

1354
01:25:35,304 --> 01:25:37,704
- What's with C. D?
- I don't know. He's acting strange.

1355
01:25:37,774 --> 01:25:40,106
Are you hungry?

1356
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:43,202
- Why don't we order some food?
- I just had spaghetti.

1357
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:46,680
- I want a cheeseburger.
- Cheeseburger, spaghetti...

1358
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:02,424
Coming!

1359
01:26:04,267 --> 01:26:06,735
Just a sec.
I'll be right back.

1360
01:26:09,505 --> 01:26:11,496
God, I hate this.

1361
01:26:17,447 --> 01:26:20,416
- Chris, Chris.
- What are you doing here?

1362
01:26:20,483 --> 01:26:23,281
- No one there.
- She's coming. Get out, get out.

1363
01:26:23,352 --> 01:26:26,719
- What?
- There was no one there.

1364
01:26:36,666 --> 01:26:38,759
What is going on?

1365
01:26:38,835 --> 01:26:41,235
No. I'll get it.

1366
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:45,030
All right. All right.

1367
01:27:05,328 --> 01:27:06,761
Probably kids.

1368
01:27:06,829 --> 01:27:08,990
- Oh, God.
- Damn kids nowadays.

1369
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:15,804
You know why I came back early?

1370
01:27:15,872 --> 01:27:18,102
- There goes that doorbell again.
- There's no doorbell.

1371
01:27:18,174 --> 01:27:21,268
I heard it. You should answer it.
There it goes again.

1372
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:24,074
I heard it. Probably kids.

1373
01:27:24,147 --> 01:27:27,241
- Come on, I'll get it.
- There is no doorbell.

1374
01:27:27,316 --> 01:27:29,682
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

1375
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:34,622
Why me?

1376
01:27:39,695 --> 01:27:41,287
There it was again.

1377
01:27:43,232 --> 01:27:45,700
- She might mention some letters.
- What?

1378
01:27:45,768 --> 01:27:48,396
- You wrote her a few letters.
- I did?

1379
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:50,405
- How many?
- Three a day.

1380
01:27:50,473 --> 01:27:53,909
Three a day. We're on six days.
Six times three is 18!

1381
01:27:53,976 --> 01:27:56,103
- Well, 20.
- Twenty?

1382
01:27:56,179 --> 01:27:57,669
Or so. Yeah.

1383
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,953
Nobody there.

1384
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:10,124
- Chris?
- Yes?

1385
01:28:11,127 --> 01:28:13,721
Do you know why I came back early?

1386
01:28:13,796 --> 01:28:17,527
Every day, every hour,
you sent me something new.

1387
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,763
I couldn't stand it anymore.
I had to see you.

1388
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:22,964
It was just letters.

1389
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:24,973
Twenty or so.

1390
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:28,067
- Think of what you wrote.
- I'm trying.

1391
01:28:30,413 --> 01:28:33,871
- Wait. I wanna know the real you.
- No, not the real me.

1392
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:36,316
The one I spoke to that night
at the window.

1393
01:28:36,385 --> 01:28:39,445
This is the real me.
You know, good ol' Chris.

1394
01:28:39,522 --> 01:28:41,615
I like hanging out, mixing it up.

1395
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:44,251
Lifting weights.
I'm into my body.

1396
01:28:44,327 --> 01:28:46,795
You don't have to do that with me.

1397
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:50,094
I know you from your letters.
That's the person I love.

1398
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:52,794
Couldn't I just be cute, huh?

1399
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:55,861
Oh, Chris, don't you see?

1400
01:28:55,938 --> 01:28:59,169
It wouldn't matter if you were ugly.

1401
01:28:59,242 --> 01:29:03,303
- I want you to teach me what you know.
- I play guitar a little.

1402
01:29:03,379 --> 01:29:06,041
- I want to travel with you.
- I hate pasta.

1403
01:29:06,115 --> 01:29:10,381
- I want to go to concerts with you.
- We could boogie or what?

1404
01:29:10,453 --> 01:29:13,718
We can just talk.

1405
01:29:13,789 --> 01:29:16,349
Roxanne, I'm just... I'm...

1406
01:29:18,294 --> 01:29:21,593
I'm not feeling good.
I gotta go.

1407
01:29:57,266 --> 01:30:00,326
So? You coming or not?

1408
01:30:01,604 --> 01:30:03,265
Yeah.

1409
01:30:07,576 --> 01:30:10,306
- Gonna tell her?
- I can't.

1410
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:15,550
You have to tell her.
It isn't nice.

1411
01:30:17,286 --> 01:30:19,220
You got any paper?

1412
01:30:19,288 --> 01:30:21,279
I could write her.

1413
01:30:21,357 --> 01:30:24,121
I've got a lot of experience at that.

1414
01:30:24,193 --> 01:30:27,162
I have paper in the glove compartment.
I'll get it.

1415
01:30:33,569 --> 01:30:35,560
- Hi, Chief.
- Hi, Andy.

1416
01:30:35,638 --> 01:30:38,106
Roxanne called.

1417
01:30:38,174 --> 01:30:41,371
She sounded weird. She wants you
to come over right away.

1418
01:30:43,779 --> 01:30:45,713
Jerry, want your rematch?

1419
01:30:45,781 --> 01:30:49,182
- He owes me 50 bucks.
- You animal.

1420
01:30:57,593 --> 01:30:59,026
Come in.

1421
01:31:06,402 --> 01:31:08,233
What is it?

1422
01:31:08,304 --> 01:31:09,737
Read this.

1423
01:31:13,609 --> 01:31:15,042
"Dear Roxanne.

1424
01:31:15,111 --> 01:31:18,672
I've met somebody else
and she's real cute, too.

1425
01:31:18,748 --> 01:31:22,548
I hope I haven't hurt you,
but I probably did.

1426
01:31:22,618 --> 01:31:24,552
It was really great knowing you...

1427
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:28,147
and now I'm going to be
a dealer in Tahoe.

1428
01:31:28,224 --> 01:31:33,423
Yours 'truley'... T-R-U-L-E-Y.

1429
01:31:33,496 --> 01:31:34,929
Chris."

1430
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:40,434
Then I found this along with it
under the door.

1431
01:31:48,177 --> 01:31:49,610
Read it.

1432
01:31:49,678 --> 01:31:51,771
Read it out loud.

1433
01:31:54,984 --> 01:32:01,355
"All day long I think,
'Where is she?

1434
01:32:01,424 --> 01:32:04,621
What is she doing now? '

1435
01:32:04,693 --> 01:32:09,187
Occasionally I see you
on the street and I feel...

1436
01:32:09,265 --> 01:32:11,859
the nerves in my stomach...

1437
01:32:11,934 --> 01:32:15,062
a wave crashing over me."

1438
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:17,733
It's so him.

1439
01:32:17,807 --> 01:32:19,331
Go on.

1440
01:32:20,876 --> 01:32:24,243
"I remember everything about you.

1441
01:32:24,313 --> 01:32:28,443
Every move, no matter
how insignificant it might seem.

1442
01:32:30,052 --> 01:32:34,045
July 11, 2:30 in the afternoon.

1443
01:32:34,123 --> 01:32:37,149
L... You changed your hair.

1444
01:32:38,627 --> 01:32:42,393
Not that much, but I noticed...

1445
01:32:42,465 --> 01:32:45,263
and it was as though...

1446
01:32:45,334 --> 01:32:47,666
I had looked at the sun too long.

1447
01:32:47,736 --> 01:32:52,639
I could close my eyes
and see it again and again...

1448
01:32:53,876 --> 01:32:55,810
the way your hair moved...

1449
01:32:55,878 --> 01:32:59,370
your walk, your dress...

1450
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:01,507
everywhere I looked."

1451
01:33:06,288 --> 01:33:08,222
It's nice, isn't it?

1452
01:33:09,091 --> 01:33:12,754
It has a... I feel...

1453
01:33:12,828 --> 01:33:14,853
Finish it.

1454
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:17,091
I did. It just runs out.

1455
01:33:17,166 --> 01:33:19,566
You have to turn it over.

1456
01:33:22,338 --> 01:33:25,967
"C.D. Wrote this.
Call me. Dixie."

1457
01:33:29,912 --> 01:33:32,540
I went through all of the other letters.

1458
01:33:32,615 --> 01:33:35,277
They're all in the same hand.

1459
01:33:35,351 --> 01:33:38,149
It was your voice that night
under the balcony.

1460
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:40,279
Chris didn't write those letters,
you did.

1461
01:33:44,393 --> 01:33:46,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1462
01:33:47,796 --> 01:33:51,562
All this time,
right there in front of me...

1463
01:33:51,634 --> 01:33:53,898
and I couldn't even see you.

1464
01:33:55,204 --> 01:33:59,038
You bastard!
How could you trick me like that?

1465
01:33:59,108 --> 01:34:02,703
- I was trying to make you feel good.
- You're playing with my emotions!

1466
01:34:02,778 --> 01:34:04,871
I wasn't playing with you.
You could've figured it out.

1467
01:34:04,947 --> 01:34:06,938
- Now it's my fault?
- As much as mine.

1468
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:09,280
The signatures don't match
the handwriting on the letters.

1469
01:34:09,351 --> 01:34:12,752
When you get love letters,
you don't compare signatures.

1470
01:34:12,821 --> 01:34:15,483
You know why? You wanted to believe it.
You wanted it all.

1471
01:34:15,558 --> 01:34:17,492
All the romance and emotion...

1472
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:20,688
wrapped up in a cute,
little nose and ass!

1473
01:34:20,763 --> 01:34:23,163
You even got me in bed.

1474
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,666
What about that? You went to bed
with him on your first date.

1475
01:34:25,734 --> 01:34:27,895
Only because you seduced me.

1476
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:29,904
You went to bed with him fast!

1477
01:34:29,972 --> 01:34:32,600
A few frilly words,
you're counting ceiling tiles.

1478
01:34:32,675 --> 01:34:35,940
I don't even consider
that I went to bed with him.

1479
01:34:36,011 --> 01:34:40,107
Somebody was up there,
and for goddamn sure it wasn't me!

1480
01:34:40,182 --> 01:34:43,583
If it wasn't you, who was it?
Chris couldn't have seduced me.

1481
01:34:43,652 --> 01:34:46,052
That was the point
I was making to Dixie.

1482
01:34:46,121 --> 01:34:48,555
You told Dixie?

1483
01:34:48,624 --> 01:34:50,057
I just mentioned...

1484
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:53,991
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!

1485
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:56,258
How could you lie
and say those things?

1486
01:34:56,332 --> 01:34:59,529
I wasn't lying. I was trying to tell you
how I felt about you.

1487
01:34:59,602 --> 01:35:02,730
If you felt that way, you have
a lousy way of telling someone!

1488
01:35:02,805 --> 01:35:04,238
Get out!

1489
01:35:05,274 --> 01:35:07,868
- Get out!
- I am out. You get in.

1490
01:35:07,943 --> 01:35:09,911
- No, get out!
- Get in!

1491
01:35:09,979 --> 01:35:12,743
Get in! Get off this porch!

1492
01:35:12,815 --> 01:35:14,874
- Fine!
- Go on!

1493
01:35:17,453 --> 01:35:19,387
And don't throw my hat at me!

1494
01:35:22,324 --> 01:35:26,886
You want to know the rest of the letter?
It said, "P.S. I was only kidding!"

1495
01:35:27,963 --> 01:35:30,989
Ten more seconds and I'm leaving.

1496
01:35:31,066 --> 01:35:33,000
What did you say?

1497
01:35:33,068 --> 01:35:35,764
Ten more seconds and I'm leaving.

1498
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:38,706
What'd you think I said?

1499
01:35:38,774 --> 01:35:41,675
"Earn more sessions by 'sleeving."'

1500
01:35:43,512 --> 01:35:45,446
What does that mean?

1501
01:35:45,514 --> 01:35:48,608
I don't know.
That's why I came out.

1502
01:35:52,521 --> 01:35:54,785
Ten!

1503
01:35:54,857 --> 01:35:57,087
Nine!

1504
01:35:57,159 --> 01:35:59,354
Eight!

1505
01:35:59,428 --> 01:36:01,396
Seven!

1506
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:22,108
What about Gillian?

1507
01:36:22,184 --> 01:36:25,847
I told her about the hot-tubbing...

1508
01:36:33,629 --> 01:36:36,063
Chris came and took his stuff.

1509
01:37:00,456 --> 01:37:02,686
There's a fire somewhere.

1510
01:37:04,093 --> 01:37:06,027
Get into gear.

1511
01:37:56,812 --> 01:37:59,781
- That's where I put Bossy.
- You put Bossy in there?

1512
01:38:03,619 --> 01:38:04,916
We got a burner!

1513
01:38:07,756 --> 01:38:11,123
Here's what I want.
Two lines from the pump to the fire!

1514
01:38:11,193 --> 01:38:14,959
Three lines from the hydrant
to the pump. Let's go!

1515
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:17,555
If it gets to the station,
the whole town could go.

1516
01:38:24,706 --> 01:38:26,640
Hit it!

1517
01:38:29,878 --> 01:38:32,403
I want a water curtain
on both exposures.

1518
01:38:32,481 --> 01:38:33,914
Let's go!

1519
01:38:42,724 --> 01:38:44,055
Go!

1520
01:38:44,126 --> 01:38:46,253
- All right!
- Yeah!

1521
01:38:46,328 --> 01:38:48,853
One, two, three!

1522
01:38:50,499 --> 01:38:52,330
All right! Yeah!

1523
01:38:52,401 --> 01:38:54,801
We're doin' it, C.D.

1524
01:38:59,608 --> 01:39:02,202
Take it easy.
All right, here we go.

1525
01:39:03,712 --> 01:39:06,476
Comin', Bossy.
Let's go, boys.

1526
01:39:12,187 --> 01:39:14,655
You're all real
goddamn firefighters now.

1527
01:39:16,091 --> 01:39:18,992
To all us real
goddamn firefighters.

1528
01:39:19,061 --> 01:39:22,497
Thanks to us, no one got fried.
Am I right?

1529
01:39:22,564 --> 01:39:25,556
We beat this fire by a nose!

1530
01:39:29,738 --> 01:39:31,729
Well said.

1531
01:39:31,807 --> 01:39:33,240
Yes.

1532
01:39:35,978 --> 01:39:37,912
I want to see you.

1533
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:40,380
A toast!

1534
01:39:43,485 --> 01:39:47,945
I would like to say
that I would rather be...

1535
01:39:48,023 --> 01:39:50,218
with the people of this town...

1536
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,022
than with the finest people
in the world.

1537
01:40:23,959 --> 01:40:26,450
What are friends for?

1538
01:40:27,429 --> 01:40:28,862
So long.

1539
01:41:03,865 --> 01:41:07,198
I would close my eyes
and see you again and again.

1540
01:41:08,637 --> 01:41:10,730
Your eyes.

1541
01:41:10,806 --> 01:41:13,036
Your face.

1542
01:41:13,108 --> 01:41:14,939
The way you walk.

1543
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:17,376
Your style.

1544
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:18,879
Your wit.

1545
01:41:20,582 --> 01:41:23,073
And your nose, Charlie.

1546
01:41:24,987 --> 01:41:27,217
It doesn't quite work, does it?

1547
01:41:29,691 --> 01:41:33,491
I went inside and thought what it was
about Chris that attracted me.

1548
01:41:33,562 --> 01:41:36,588
It wasn't the way he looked.

1549
01:41:36,665 --> 01:41:39,634
That's not true.
First it was the way he looked.

1550
01:41:40,669 --> 01:41:42,830
It was how he made me feel.

1551
01:41:42,904 --> 01:41:46,499
He made me feel romantic.

1552
01:41:46,575 --> 01:41:48,338
Intelligent.

1553
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:49,843
Feminine.

1554
01:41:51,346 --> 01:41:53,780
But it wasn't him doing that to me.

1555
01:41:53,849 --> 01:41:55,783
It was you.

1556
01:41:55,851 --> 01:42:00,550
All these other men,
they've got flat, featureless faces.

1557
01:42:00,622 --> 01:42:03,819
No character. No fire.

1558
01:42:03,892 --> 01:42:05,985
No nose.

1559
01:42:06,061 --> 01:42:08,723
Charlie, you have a big nose!

1560
01:42:08,797 --> 01:42:11,891
You have a beautiful, great big...

1561
01:42:11,967 --> 01:42:13,958
flesh-and-bone nose.

1562
01:42:14,036 --> 01:42:16,698
I love your nose.

1563
01:42:18,073 --> 01:42:20,405
I love your nose, Charlie.

1564
01:42:21,843 --> 01:42:24,073
I love you, Charlie.

1565
01:42:28,450 --> 01:42:29,974
Well?

1566
01:42:30,052 --> 01:42:31,986
Are you kidding?

1567
01:43:38,153 --> 01:43:40,383
It's locked! It's locked!

1568
01:43:42,224 --> 01:43:44,158
Thank God I have the key.

1569
01:44:49,691 --> 01:44:51,784
By the way, I named the comet.

1570
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:55,455
Oh, yeah. Good ol' Comet Kowalski.

1571
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:57,657
No, Comet Charlie.

1572
01:44:57,732 --> 01:44:59,757
Hey, that's nice.

1573
01:44:59,835 --> 01:45:01,769
Yeah, it's my dad's name.

1574
01:45:03,638 --> 01:45:06,004
Well, he'll be so happy.
