1
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,939
There are some things that just don't
happen no matter how correct in theory

2
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:47,278
Like the NBA Dream Team getting beaten
by the Korean team,

3
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,442
or Miss Korea marrying a hotdog vendor

4
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,750
We all know too well that things like
that just don't happen in real life

5
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,601
Excuse me, Miss. You failed to practice
safe driving

6
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,765
Am I under arrest?

7
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,370
May I see your license, please?

8
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,309
Well...

9
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,532
Miss, you're headed for some serious
trouble!

10
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,571
What's going on?

11
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:37,241
She's got the nerve to drive like this
without a license

12
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,745
I'm really sorry

13
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:47,950
It's just that my driving test is 2 days away
and I just wanted to get some practice

14
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:17,449
You gotta turn all the way around with your
right arm on top of the passenger seat...

15
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,617
Like this?

16
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:35,199
Do you work this Saturday evening?

17
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,633
Yeah, I think so

18
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,473
Oh well...

19
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:49,377
Take it just in case.
It's a play that I'm in

20
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,287
You're an actress?

21
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,956
Actually a student.
Second year Theater major

22
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:01,857
I live in the dorms
but I'm here on vacation

23
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:16,203
Hey you! You can't do that here

24
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,412
OK, we're leaving!

25
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,674
Hey wait...
I just want to buy some flowers

26
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,451
Thank you

27
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,051
A PROMISE

28
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,010
Run! Run!

29
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,267
I didn't know traffic officers had
so many diverse duties...

30
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,268
Thank you for the flowers...

31
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,280
It was my first time being
invited to a play

32
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,381
I had a great time

33
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,854
Then why did you leave so soon?

34
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,727
You got your license!
Congratulations!

35
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,330
Let's have lunch. My treat

36
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:29,271
I can't leave this area

37
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,034
Really?

38
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,116
Do you like ramen?

39
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,783
Ever meet a soldier who doesn't?

40
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,230
Wow, this is delicious.
What's your recipe?

41
00:08:55,101 --> 00:09:02,166
It's a secret. I'm planning to open
a franchise later

42
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,308
If you're studying drama,
then you must want to be an actress

43
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,715
Not everyone who studied drama
becomes an actor

44
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,557
I don't really have a dream

45
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,125
I'd like to be a good performer,
but I don't know

46
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,200
I'm also thinking about studying abroad

47
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,966
Why, do you have a dream?

48
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,226
When I was a kid, I wanted to be
a baseball player someday

49
00:09:56,662 --> 00:10:00,530
I did play in junior high

50
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:07,471
But I didn't get big enough.
It also didn't seem like I had the talent

51
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,638
So I quit

52
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:16,811
Sometimes you have to readjust dreams

53
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,484
Guess what it is now?

54
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,547
What?

55
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,913
A baseball umpire

56
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,151
A baseball umpire?

57
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,518
Funny, huh?

58
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,935
Now that I think of it,

59
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:43,397
your gestures are like that of an umpire
calling "STRIKE"

60
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:50,114
I promise to come and see your game
when you become one

61
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,473
Is that a promise?

62
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:56,982
Of course.
You came to see my play

63
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,394
A fat lady...

64
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,888
She is eating and suddenly
she gets fuming mad

65
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,826
You know this joke?

66
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,092
No

67
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,295
Well she suddenly gets really mad

68
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,266
Guess why?

69
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,170
Why?

70
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:22,577
The food in her bowl kept disappearing!!

71
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:24,948
Funny, right?

72
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,312
That's really old!

73
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,744
Geez, I just heard it yesterday...

74
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,498
I'm leaving tomorrow

75
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,531
Oh. Back to school already?
Wait a second

76
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,411
New Driver

77
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,294
You have to post this for 6 months

78
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,591
I'll write you!

79
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,228
Hey... Seonghoon!

80
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,560
Officer Lee!

81
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:53,794
Sorry, man

82
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,933
Officer Kim,
what are you still doing up?

83
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,578
You went to a 4-year college, right?

84
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:09,580
Are there two 'L's in "especially"?

85
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:19,951
He spent most of his spare time
writing to her

86
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:27,195
To this day, I call him for a spelling check
when I get stuck writing articles

87
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:33,537
His days of constantly
writing her paid off

88
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:05,861
I was looking for a traffic officer

89
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,744
It's been a long time, Bumsoo

90
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:14,843
Yeah

91
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,307
Why do you keep smiling?

92
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,644
I'm just glad to see you again

93
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,896
So you're staying in Seoul for good?

94
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,824
I have some year-end leave coming up

95
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,692
Maybe we can go see a play together

96
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,266
Do you feel better?
The night air isn't good for you

97
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:08,193
Stop blowing "ping, ping"
and blow hard, go "poong"

98
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,540
Better?

99
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:30,188
I get overnight leave this weekend.
How about a play?

100
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:36,687
And I get year-end leave this month,
if it's OK with you...

101
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,299
What's wrong?

102
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:52,376
I'm going abroad to study...

103
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,807
Going abroad?

104
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,886
So Soon?

105
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:11,523
But you didn't mention anything
in your letters

106
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,068
I wanted to tell you in person

107
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,971
Why didn't tell me sooner...

108
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,239
I mean...

109
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:34,776
You've been so good to me

110
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:44,219
But... I... I... love you!

111
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:06,940
In grade school... you wait for your
first field trip with bated breath

112
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,021
Marking the calendar...
Losing sleep the night before

113
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,759
But once you get there,
it's not what you expected

114
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:34,069
I think happiness is not the field trip
itself but it's in the waiting,

115
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,973
I think love is the same way

116
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:45,446
We feel happiness not
when we achieve love

117
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,091
but when we know there is
a possibility of love

118
00:18:51,663 --> 00:19:00,002
I know that. I don't know much
and I don't have much

119
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:05,641
And I know this sort of
situation is not for you

120
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,678
No. It's not that at all

121
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,007
I like you too

122
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:23,420
But if I acknowledge my feelings now,
it will just confuse me further

123
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,203
Bumsoo, let's just be friends!

124
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:18,211
I'm in love with you and so I cannot
accept your friendship

125
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,925
What's wrong with him?
We're wearing seatbelts, right?

126
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,213
Once he said...

127
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,680
He thought about the number of
people in this world

128
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:10,854
who exchange 47 letters and go on living
as strangers

129
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:56,198
Out on the field, the umpire is the law.
When you make a call, you must mean it

130
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:01,205
And when calling "Strike", the sound of
"k" is most important

131
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,907
It's not just "STRIKE",
it's "ST~~~Rl~~~KKE". Got it?

132
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:07,876
Yes, sir

133
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,938
Well, let's start one at a time

134
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:21,353
Don't make the "kk" sound so obvious

135
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,663
That doesn't mean you do away
with it all together

136
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:39,443
Not bad... Just some more vibration
after "ST"

137
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:49,383
Now, you know you ain't here to sing
the blues

138
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:59,722
Louder, kid. They gotta hear
you out in the outfields

139
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:00,662
Yes, sir

140
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:13,506
The batter's chest, knees and
both sides of the home plate

141
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:17,207
make up the four points of
the invisible rectangle

142
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,213
A strike is when the ball
passes through here

143
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,121
The ball went past the ankles...
I said the knees

144
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:39,570
Strike. It's in the middle

145
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:46,203
All catchers are frauds.
Look at the ball not the mitt

146
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,996
- Strike!
- It was just within the homeplate

147
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,397
You're still not loud enough!

148
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,499
On the record, she was history

149
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,700
But human emotions don't always
go by the record

150
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:58,512
Hyun joo!

151
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:59,271
Hey, you're by first base.
You ain't gonna need to call "STRIKE"

152
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:06,374
I remember being a nervous wreck
my first time on the field

153
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,619
Want some?

154
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,586
Is this OK?

155
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:21,461
Sure.
Nothing like it to calm the nerves

156
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,934
Good, huh...?

157
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:02,139
Hey, first time on first base?

158
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,371
Aren't you the baseball player,
Kim Sunghan?

159
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:08,378
I'm not a player anymore.
I've been coaching for three seasons

160
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,379
I was a big fan of yours way back when

161
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:16,315
Stop it. You're making me feel old.
Just call me Coach Kim

162
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,482
Son, how old are you?

163
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,191
Twenty-seven

164
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,948
What an age to be!

165
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,333
The ball was faster!

166
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,729
Your foot was off the base

167
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,307
Not bad for a rookie

168
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,677
You guys... It's not funny

169
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,814
With over-time,
a game can go well over 5 hours

170
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:07,758
Sometimes holding your piss is more
important than making the right call

171
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,053
Hey, Lee, it's agreed, right?

172
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,094
Come on. Stop meddling

173
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,596
A show has its own rhythm.
I can't do a close-up here!

174
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:49,038
Come on. We're both players here.
You did an extreme close-up on Kim

175
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:53,009
That shot was required.
Why don't you direct?

176
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,307
Ok. I give up.
How about in the last scene?

177
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:01,683
You do a close-up on Harin
and roll the credits, huh?

178
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,182
Ok. I'll think about it

179
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:09,491
Are you ready Harin?
Let's do a set-up with the camera!

180
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,628
What did you think of my interview?

181
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,004
It was fine

182
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:28,705
But you could be a bit less logical.
It can be a work as a turn-off

183
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,682
Is it better to look ditzy?

184
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:38,888
Well you know... A pause here,
a blush there

185
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:43,386
Mr. Byun, how've you been doing?

186
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,521
Mr. Bae. It's been a long time

187
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,427
Harin, this is Mr. Byun Jimin

188
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,832
You're Yoo Harin, right?
Nice to see you

189
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,198
I'm gonna go get the car

190
00:32:54,772 --> 00:33:03,339
I really like your show.
I read the original novel

191
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,415
Well, I'll see you next time

192
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,958
How does "The Truth of Love" end?

193
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,258
You said you read the novel,
didn't you?

194
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,394
Actually, I only got half-way
through the book

195
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,826
Goodbye, now

196
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:55,032
Is that right? Hey Coach Kim,
go and make an appeal!

197
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:04,335
The manager made me come out.
Let's just go through the motions

198
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,482
Hey, you watch that soap opera on T.V.?

199
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:19,788
I don't watch much T.V. these days

200
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,151
You're missing out.
It's called "The Truth of Love"

201
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,590
I skip baseball highlights for it
These days

202
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:31,500
Hey throw me out of the game.
I have a killer hang-over

203
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,267
Really? Ok, Out!

204
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:45,774
What're you talking about?
Why am I out?

205
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,836
Keep an eye out for the ball.
You can get hurt pretty bad

206
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,738
Hey, aren't you going to bed?

207
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,477
Yeah, I'm almost done...

208
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,192
I saw "The Truth of Love" last night

209
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,889
You did! Pretty great, huh?
That Harin, what a babe

210
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:15,337
Believe it or not, I know her

211
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:20,241
Everyone knows Harin. I know her too.
She just doesn't know me

212
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,607
I knew her a long time ago

213
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,777
You guys went out?

214
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,813
You could say that

215
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:35,118
Stop joking.
If so, then I dated Sharon Stone

216
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:41,860
It's true. I even know her real name

217
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,475
Whose side is he on?

218
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:25,803
All right. Let's show our client
over there what we can do. OK?

219
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:44,885
Cut!
Let's set up for the next shot

220
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,440
Merry Christmas, girls

221
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,674
Merry Christmas

222
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:12,841
Bye

223
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,718
Nam Hyunjoo, who's that?

224
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:23,782
May I see that?

225
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,713
That Hochang and his snoring!

226
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:52,187
Stop with the excuses.
There must be a reason

227
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,851
Stop the bullshit and drink!
Hey, Kwangtae

228
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,059
Kwangtae? My wife is here and you're
still treating me like a kid?

229
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,393
Sorry, I'm late

230
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,195
Why are you here alone?

231
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,800
I know you're new and all...

232
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,941
But our KBO Umpire's New Year's
party is for couples only

233
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:20,809
Yeah. I heard.
But give me a break this time

234
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:26,448
What break?
We enforce the law on the field

235
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:36,397
So go out and get yourself a woman.
I said go on. Get on out here!

236
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,612
Thanks for coming

237
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,379
Did you wait long?

238
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,182
No, I'm fine. Let's go in

239
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,457
You got yourself a date?

240
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:13,464
Hey, isn't she the 'bat girl'?

241
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,568
This is really different from
the place we were at before

242
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,766
Don't worry.
This place isn't that expensive

243
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,233
It's nice to hear you say "we"

244
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,509
Fried ramen with seafood

245
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,349
Cold ramen with Vegetables

246
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,233
I told you it wasn't expensive?

247
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,209
This is red pepper ramen?

248
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:41,523
Red pepper ramen's soup is good
but the noodles are even better

249
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,027
This was fried in vegetable oil,
right?

250
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,295
It's called "farm oil"

251
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:51,728
Are you also coming out with ramen
fried in soy oil?

252
00:42:54,405 --> 00:43:01,243
I'm finally reaping the rewards of focusing
on the ramen instead of ice cream

253
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,506
Dessert time

254
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:24,757
Bumsoo, are you alright?
Oh, my god, look out...

255
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,134
Seungyun!

256
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:28,468
Yes?

257
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:29,832
Do you like me?

258
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:35,843
No. I love you. Now, come on

259
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,439
You shouldn't love me

260
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:40,445
Why not?

261
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:49,221
Field trips. Field trip is not good.
It's the waiting that's important

262
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:53,957
What are you talking about?
Come on!

263
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm saying that you shouldn't love me

264
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,632
Do you have someone else?

265
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,901
Yeah. I'm in love with someone

266
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:08,642
I've been in love with her for a long time.
You know her too

267
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,141
Who's she?
Is it Miss Song in the broadcast studio?

268
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,342
Nam Hyunjoo!

269
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,616
Who in heaven is Nam Hyunjoo?

270
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:23,457
Oh yeah, Everyone knows her as
Yoo Harin

271
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,526
Who? Yoo Harin? The actress?

272
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,624
Yes, I'm in love with her

273
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:34,297
Get over it. The male population
of Korea loves her. You're drunk

274
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:44,474
No. I've been in love with her since
she was Nam Hyunjoo

275
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:54,553
We exchanged 47 letters and
I taught her how to drive

276
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,060
I went to see her play

277
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:05,000
This is too much. And you're hurting
my feelings

278
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,869
Stop making excuses

279
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:15,539
Speaking of letters, I sent Brad Pitt
over a hundred

280
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,741
Talk about being in love

281
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:51,571
Yoo Harin is Nam Hyunjoo...

282
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:06,286
Mr. Yoon. An exclusive! Lee Miran
has an illegitimate daughter

283
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:17,001
What? But baseball season starts tomorrow.
Let's sit on it for a few days

284
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:39,252
In a few moments, the 98 Korean
League will officially begin

285
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,824
We are honored to have a very special guest
to throw the first pitch of the season

286
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:49,096
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome actress Yoo Harin!

287
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:58,072
There are some reporters here.
Let's stay until the 3rd inning

288
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,641
Ms. Yoo, could I have your autograph?

289
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,440
Sure!

290
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,409
Thank you

291
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,085
Busy today?

292
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:25,226
The usual.
Hey, I got her autograph

293
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,141
OK, I'm out.
Stop rubbing it in!

294
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,089
Let's get going

295
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,002
Nice going

296
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:42,637
Lee Miran refuses to withdraw her suit

297
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,901
I think you should lay low
in another department

298
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:51,473
Who knew that exact replica of hers
would turn out to be her niece?

299
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:59,215
I heard the baseball division
could use your help

300
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:10,265
I liked number 3 more.
I could rely on number 4 for a hit

301
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:15,998
If you aim for base stealing, you may
reach a 20-20, you ever feel tempted?

302
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,668
Sure. But the question is, am I up to it?

303
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,276
Who's your favorite actress?

304
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,243
huh...?

305
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:41,720
Give my regards to Mr. Bae

306
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:42,756
Sure

307
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:43,925
Bye

308
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,139
That Choi Yoo Ree. Pretty good nose job

309
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:57,213
You two have a alot in common

310
00:51:57,347 --> 00:52:01,784
She was represented by Mr. Bae once and
she also did commercials for "Naumyun"

311
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,718
She was in a "Naumyun" commercial?

312
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,813
Don't you remember?

313
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:12,226
She'd smile seductively and a guy would
say "I'm hungry for 'Naumyun"

314
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,588
She got her first big break with that

315
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:15,920
Oh yeah

316
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,698
What's with your skin...?

317
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:20,601
I'm just tired

318
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:24,133
Did you have dinner?
You want some ramen?

319
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,033
No, I have an interview

320
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,665
Hey, what are you smiling at?

321
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:08,100
The umpire by third base,
he's an old friend

322
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,777
You mean Kim Bumsoo?

323
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,914
How'd you know his name?

324
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,887
Hey, come on,
I'm in the third grade!

325
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:05,801
Excuse me, were you one of the umpires?

326
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:07,100
Yes

327
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,436
Could I ask you something?

328
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:14,501
Oh, yes, go ahead

329
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:26,380
The audience kept yelling out what sounds like
"Pitcher buck", is that "buck" as in F.U.C.K.?

330
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:35,789
No, that's "balk". B.A.L.K.
but people yell out "F.U.C.K."

331
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:41,829
Bumsoo!

332
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,742
Hyunjoo!

333
00:56:11,737 --> 00:56:15,366
So, your dream did come true

334
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,334
So did yours

335
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:33,015
Well, I kept my promise right?
I promised to come and see your game

336
00:56:35,795 --> 00:56:37,763
You'd already fulfilled it before

337
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:46,366
You came to throw the first pitch
at the opening game

338
00:56:48,407 --> 00:56:51,376
You were there?

339
00:56:51,777 --> 00:56:53,335
I was by first base

340
00:56:54,714 --> 00:56:56,341
Why didn't you say anything?

341
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:11,861
I used to think that I'd see you again
when you returned from your studies abroad

342
00:57:13,399 --> 00:57:18,666
But when I saw you on T.V.,
I knew I had no chance

343
00:57:25,711 --> 00:57:34,210
I worked as a guide for
a commercial crew from Korea

344
00:57:37,223 --> 00:57:41,284
That's when I met my current manager

345
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:46,523
My whole life changed after that

346
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:54,030
You once said that dreams
had to be readjusted

347
00:58:03,149 --> 00:58:07,609
Thank you for the Christmas card

348
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,060
How do I look?

349
00:58:25,304 --> 00:58:28,068
Strike... Is that right?

350
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:35,207
Woa! That loud?

351
00:58:36,015 --> 00:58:38,540
They have to hear you in the outfields

352
00:58:38,684 --> 00:58:41,653
Wait, hold on

353
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:51,955
Call out my name!

354
00:59:09,315 --> 00:59:10,782
Hyunjoo...

355
00:59:30,302 --> 00:59:32,770
You OK? You look nice

356
00:59:32,838 --> 00:59:34,066
You look nice too

357
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,334
- You like it?
- Yeah...

358
00:59:36,342 --> 00:59:37,707
Can you walk around like this?

359
00:59:38,611 --> 00:59:39,635
What do you wanna do?

360
00:59:41,413 --> 00:59:43,938
I want to try that

361
00:59:44,784 --> 00:59:45,375
What? A corn dog on a stick?

362
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:46,008
Yes

363
00:59:46,118 --> 00:59:47,551
Wait! I'll get one...

364
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,922
Hey! That's Yoo Harin!

365
01:00:11,911 --> 01:00:16,280
Mr. Yoon, who is the biggest name
in Korea today?

366
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:19,618
President D.J. Kim!

367
01:00:20,186 --> 01:00:22,416
No, I mean in entertainment

368
01:00:23,923 --> 01:00:26,357
Yoo Seungjoon, Han Sukkyu...

369
01:00:26,692 --> 01:00:29,661
Readers are not interested in
the private lives of male stars

370
01:00:31,797 --> 01:00:33,196
Yoo Harin?

371
01:00:34,466 --> 01:00:35,933
June 8th...

372
01:00:36,035 --> 01:00:37,730
That's Yoo Harin?

373
01:00:39,572 --> 01:00:43,941
White SM, License plate 7486.
Chamsil Stadium parking lot. July 3rd

374
01:00:45,244 --> 01:00:47,075
She's dating a baseball player!

375
01:00:48,247 --> 01:00:54,709
LG's Kim Yongsoo, he's hot these days.
Wait, isn't he married?

376
01:00:56,989 --> 01:01:00,220
Even better! That's what I call news!

377
01:01:00,893 --> 01:01:08,459
I focused on popular baseball players
at first. Nice families, good looking

378
01:01:09,735 --> 01:01:15,674
However, Yoo Harin's been caught
on my radar 5 times at baseball games,

379
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:18,939
but each time it was a different team

380
01:01:21,146 --> 01:01:23,239
That means it's not a player

381
01:01:25,217 --> 01:01:27,310
Baseball fanatic,
attorney Kim Hyungon

382
01:01:28,354 --> 01:01:33,690
That's right.
He's got the money and the prestige

383
01:01:34,426 --> 01:01:37,725
But all five times,
he came with his wife and kids

384
01:01:39,899 --> 01:01:42,766
Author Song Yoohee, working
on a novel about baseball

385
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:46,464
You mean Yoo Harin is a lesbian?

386
01:01:47,606 --> 01:01:49,904
But Song Yoohee is not a lesbian

387
01:01:50,743 --> 01:01:52,904
How would you know?

388
01:01:54,146 --> 01:01:55,704
I've got my ways

389
01:01:59,618 --> 01:02:03,076
Millionaire Jeon Jaegwang,
a very likely candidate

390
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:11,157
But I did my research and
found out he's impotent

391
01:02:13,299 --> 01:02:15,494
Then, who the hell is it?

392
01:02:16,101 --> 01:02:19,002
Here's our man!

393
01:02:24,476 --> 01:02:26,341
Actress Yoo Harin and Sportscaster
Ha Ilsung's Secret Rendezvous?

394
01:02:36,288 --> 01:02:37,118
What is it?

395
01:02:39,024 --> 01:02:45,190
Yoo Harin is seeing someone else

396
01:02:48,434 --> 01:02:53,098
Stop poking around.
You're making me out for a fool

397
01:02:56,008 --> 01:02:59,307
I'm sorry, but I thought you should know

398
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:06,674
He's not even worth your time

399
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,255
You have an N.B.A.

400
01:03:12,224 --> 01:03:13,623
That's M.B.A.

401
01:03:18,831 --> 01:03:21,231
He's just a KBS baseball umpire

402
01:03:22,534 --> 01:03:23,330
KBS?

403
01:03:23,402 --> 01:03:24,130
Yep

404
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,435
You mean KBO!

405
01:03:31,543 --> 01:03:33,875
Sorry sir.
I apologize for my ignorance

406
01:03:36,048 --> 01:03:42,783
He's probably punk she knew
before she was famous

407
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:52,021
The bullets have run out,
The bad guys corner Harin

408
01:03:52,231 --> 01:03:56,531
At that moment,
something falls from the sky

409
01:03:56,802 --> 01:03:57,962
Guess what?

410
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:04,166
It's "Naumyun".
And you see the following on screen

411
01:04:04,243 --> 01:04:08,270
"I'm hungry for 'Naumyun"!
May I join you guys?

412
01:04:17,423 --> 01:04:20,551
Yooree, what's your latest project?

413
01:04:21,427 --> 01:04:24,396
A new film called 'Nostalgia'

414
01:04:25,931 --> 01:04:27,626
You're doing that film?

415
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,733
Why not? Am I not suitable?

416
01:04:32,404 --> 01:04:34,565
That's because you only read
half the book...

417
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,431
The main character's personality
changes in the end!

418
01:04:43,482 --> 01:04:46,212
Care for some coffee or ice cream?

419
01:04:46,718 --> 01:04:47,742
Coffee, please

420
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:48,548
Same here...

421
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:49,484
Me too

422
01:04:50,022 --> 01:04:51,011
Ice cream, please

423
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,284
Just a moment, please

424
01:04:52,357 --> 01:04:55,451
Oh, could you sprinkle
some ramen crumbs on top?

425
01:04:55,527 --> 01:04:56,255
Pardon?

426
01:04:57,129 --> 01:04:58,426
Don't you know ramen crumbs?

427
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,207
You don't look too happy

428
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:15,372
Did Yooree get to you about 'Nostalgia'?

429
01:05:18,217 --> 01:05:21,448
Why did Yooree quit doing
commercials for "Naumyun"?

430
01:05:22,855 --> 01:05:25,790
She basically didn't like ramen

431
01:05:29,695 --> 01:05:33,563
That was the only reason

432
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:40,636
I've never mixed business and pleasure
At least until now

433
01:05:43,909 --> 01:05:48,573
But now I find myself jealous of
a baseball umpire...

434
01:05:51,016 --> 01:05:54,179
What, now you're checking up on me?

435
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:59,714
Harin, wake up and smell the coffee

436
01:06:00,192 --> 01:06:07,155
You're playing a cruel game with this guy!

437
01:06:09,101 --> 01:06:10,227
Let me off

438
01:06:10,435 --> 01:06:13,836
- Let's not act like children!
- That's exactly why I want to get off

439
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:51,169
You've been doing this for two years
and you're still alone

440
01:06:52,177 --> 01:06:54,236
You're a disgrace to KBO umpires

441
01:06:54,513 --> 01:06:59,007
Dude, go out and get yourself a date

442
01:07:05,157 --> 01:07:06,419
I'm gonna go make a call

443
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:09,856
Don't even think about coming in alone

444
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:12,994
Hey, drink up

445
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,858
Who's this?

446
01:07:22,074 --> 01:07:23,132
Hyunjoo?

447
01:07:54,206 --> 01:07:55,195
Bumsoo!

448
01:07:55,274 --> 01:07:55,968
Yes?

449
01:07:56,675 --> 01:08:03,274
Isn't that wrong?
Shouldn't it be "No Parking" not "No Park"?

450
01:08:05,984 --> 01:08:08,248
Yeah. That's right

451
01:08:09,554 --> 01:08:16,392
"No Parking" not "No Park"

452
01:08:19,097 --> 01:08:21,190
You haven't changed at all

453
01:08:29,074 --> 01:08:30,701
Shouldn't you be going in?

454
01:08:34,846 --> 01:08:36,939
And leave you here alone?

455
01:08:42,254 --> 01:08:46,850
You think, maybe we were too hard on him?
Maybe he went home

456
01:08:47,225 --> 01:08:50,251
Poor kid, where would he find a girl
at this time?

457
01:08:50,329 --> 01:08:54,993
He's a good-looking kid, what's with him?

458
01:08:56,501 --> 01:08:59,527
Bumsoo, you're back?

459
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:02,135
Sorry if we came down on you too hard

460
01:09:06,745 --> 01:09:12,115
So, that's what took you so long

461
01:09:20,726 --> 01:09:23,559
You've proven yourself
as a genuine KBO umpire

462
01:09:26,531 --> 01:09:28,999
You're very pretty

463
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:37,741
You look like this actress

464
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,874
Aren't you Yoo Harin?

465
01:09:52,023 --> 01:09:58,053
Oh gosh... I'm a big fan of yours

466
01:09:59,231 --> 01:10:04,464
"The Truth of Love"
what are you doing here?

467
01:10:04,536 --> 01:10:07,198
Could I have your autograph?

468
01:10:12,677 --> 01:10:16,943
You guys get to first base yet?

469
01:10:19,351 --> 01:10:24,015
So what are you going to do off season?
Catch up on lost sleep?

470
01:10:25,457 --> 01:10:29,689
That's a long way off.
We still have the Korean Series

471
01:10:29,761 --> 01:10:34,323
Don't mean to brag but our group
has been chosen for the Korean Series

472
01:10:35,033 --> 01:10:39,026
That lucky son-of-a-gun.
Bumsoo's getting a lot of good experience

473
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,266
I'll try to make it to the game

474
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:47,377
Why don't you come and
throw the first pitch?

475
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:55,280
If you agree, I'll turn over
homeplate to Bumsoo!

476
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:01,288
Wow. A second year rookie getting to
referee homeplate in the opening game?

477
01:11:02,994 --> 01:11:06,691
Great.
I'll ask my manager to arrange it!

478
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:11,925
Hey man, how about a song?

479
01:11:12,003 --> 01:11:14,437
Yeah, give it your best shot

480
01:11:16,842 --> 01:11:18,275
I'm pretty tone deaf...

481
01:11:22,948 --> 01:11:24,176
Let's see...

482
01:11:25,116 --> 01:11:26,481
Hurry up!

483
01:13:18,797 --> 01:13:27,227
Sir, could you give us some privacy?

484
01:13:27,739 --> 01:13:28,967
Sure

485
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:57,868
We're here already?

486
01:13:57,969 --> 01:14:00,631
Yeah. Is this the right place?

487
01:14:01,706 --> 01:14:04,800
Why didn't you wake me?

488
01:14:20,659 --> 01:14:26,063
- I had a really good time
- Me too

489
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:29,361
I'll be going now

490
01:14:30,201 --> 01:14:31,099
OK

491
01:15:12,944 --> 01:15:22,444
That night, on the happiest day of his life,
he wrote his 48th letter to her

492
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:29,483
I've had my suspicions about your personal life
but I didn't want to say anything

493
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:32,982
I'm sorry

494
01:16:37,829 --> 01:16:41,526
You're barely ranking tenth

495
01:16:42,233 --> 01:16:46,169
You hold the record for the fastest
entry in the polls

496
01:16:46,237 --> 01:16:50,105
and now it seems you'll hold one
for the fastest exit

497
01:16:53,778 --> 01:16:57,214
It isn't like you to harbor
on popularity polls

498
01:16:58,349 --> 01:17:01,512
I've seen cases like yours

499
01:17:05,056 --> 01:17:11,985
When you've had your fill,
you start whining for the normal life

500
01:17:18,736 --> 01:17:25,403
I remember the first time I met you,
on location for Yooree's commercial

501
01:17:29,714 --> 01:17:35,209
I'd hate to see you have to
go back to your old life

502
01:17:50,635 --> 01:17:52,694
What's this?

503
01:17:53,438 --> 01:17:55,167
You wanted the role

504
01:17:58,309 --> 01:18:00,072
Wasn't it Yooree's?

505
01:18:00,645 --> 01:18:02,840
It wasn't final

506
01:18:04,849 --> 01:18:09,309
Make your mind up quick.
Filming in Paris begins next week

507
01:18:58,403 --> 01:18:59,870
Attn: Nam Hyunjoo

508
01:19:09,314 --> 01:19:13,114
I'm sorry about what happened last time.
I was out of line

509
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,820
I guess I was jealous

510
01:19:20,725 --> 01:19:31,329
I sometimes wonder if we had met in school,
I would've been better at expressing myself to you

511
01:19:38,543 --> 01:19:45,244
Ms. Yoo, I brought up your mail

512
01:19:46,184 --> 01:19:47,481
Thank you, Samshik

513
01:19:49,253 --> 01:19:51,118
I thought that you might crave ramen
on location in Paris

514
01:19:54,325 --> 01:19:55,155
Thank you

515
01:19:57,028 --> 01:19:58,086
Let's go

516
01:20:59,757 --> 01:21:08,187
Where are you going?
The flight to Paris leaves at 8 p.m.

517
01:21:24,649 --> 01:21:28,278
The entry form for the Korean Series.
Please sign it

518
01:21:29,921 --> 01:21:33,379
You're calling the opening game.
Congratulations!

519
01:21:36,961 --> 01:21:37,928
What's with your eyes?

520
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:43,493
Hold on

521
01:21:52,343 --> 01:21:53,275
Here let me see that

522
01:21:57,081 --> 01:21:58,673
This works well on black eyes

523
01:22:25,209 --> 01:22:28,645
Hey, Yoo Harin's lover!

524
01:22:30,114 --> 01:22:34,244
Yoo Harin's Millionaire Beau

525
01:22:35,052 --> 01:22:38,954
Geez. Another millionaire business man

526
01:23:50,595 --> 01:23:55,692
It was yesterday. You knew
we wouldn't be back in time

527
01:24:06,644 --> 01:24:08,942
To the Right!

528
01:24:14,018 --> 01:24:17,010
Miss. Yoo, have you heard the news?

529
01:24:17,488 --> 01:24:21,754
Is it true that you're retiring
after the release of 'Nostalgia'?

530
01:24:21,826 --> 01:24:26,593
Gentlemen, I've informed you of
the location of the press conference

531
01:24:27,465 --> 01:24:29,558
What's going on, Mr. Byun?

532
01:24:30,501 --> 01:24:32,196
What in the world is going on here?

533
01:24:33,871 --> 01:24:38,365
While you were on location,
there were a lot of rumors about us

534
01:24:40,911 --> 01:24:44,176
I think it's time for us to clarify
our relationship...

535
01:24:44,682 --> 01:24:45,171
You Harin's Millionaire Beau

536
01:24:45,249 --> 01:24:47,774
I think this may be good for you too

537
01:24:48,552 --> 01:24:50,645
Harin, am I your manager or what?

538
01:25:01,365 --> 01:25:03,356
The opening game of the Korean series which
was delayed, is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. today

539
01:25:11,609 --> 01:25:14,271
Do I still have to go on today?

540
01:25:15,813 --> 01:25:20,910
It's too late now. Everything's been set.
You'll do fine!

541
01:25:22,019 --> 01:25:23,418
Who's that?

542
01:25:23,821 --> 01:25:27,154
He's going to throw the first pitch.
Head of the Songpa district office

543
01:25:27,224 --> 01:25:30,751
What happened to Yoo Harin?

544
01:25:48,913 --> 01:25:54,909
I've had a hell of a time screening
these questions

545
01:25:57,588 --> 01:26:01,752
It might help you to review them first

546
01:26:02,193 --> 01:26:03,251
Thanks

547
01:26:08,299 --> 01:26:09,266
Samshik!

548
01:26:11,535 --> 01:26:15,494
You've got a spelling error
in every sentence

549
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,765
What can I say, I'm a drop-out

550
01:26:52,042 --> 01:26:53,202
Are you ready?

551
01:26:57,148 --> 01:26:58,376
Harin, what's wrong!

552
01:27:01,619 --> 01:27:03,211
I have a promise to fulfill!

553
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:05,350
What are you talking about?

554
01:27:10,361 --> 01:27:11,521
Harin, what's going on?

555
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:13,992
I'm going to go throw the first pitch

556
01:27:15,266 --> 01:27:16,198
What the hell?

557
01:27:17,968 --> 01:27:18,900
Yoo Harin!

558
01:27:36,454 --> 01:27:41,187
Go ask for Mr. Park from KBO
I'll make the call

559
01:27:51,902 --> 01:28:00,674
Hey, Bae! What the hell is she doing?
Hey, what'd you say to her?

560
01:28:01,812 --> 01:28:04,303
You ever talk to me like that again,
I'll kill you

561
01:28:08,919 --> 01:28:16,416
I'm sorry for the confusion

562
01:28:16,961 --> 01:28:23,161
Due to unforeseen circumstances,
the press conference has been moved

563
01:29:45,883 --> 01:29:47,248
All right, let's do it!

564
01:29:51,789 --> 01:29:54,019
Thank you for coming

565
01:29:57,628 --> 01:30:02,224
OK, Ms. Yoo, have a seat. When I send
you the signal, just come on out!

566
01:30:02,466 --> 01:30:03,023
OK

567
01:31:03,894 --> 01:31:07,921
Ladies and Gentlemen,

568
01:31:08,966 --> 01:31:13,835
Despite the unexpected rain, the 1998
Korean Series will now begin

569
01:31:15,139 --> 01:31:18,404
We have a very special person here today
to throw the first pitch

570
01:31:19,143 --> 01:31:25,981
Please give a warm welcome
to Ms. Yoo Harin!

571
01:32:07,291 --> 01:32:13,526
More good news! Joining us today
is Ms. Yoo's fiance

572
01:32:19,937 --> 01:32:22,235
This is even better than
the press conference, huh?

573
01:32:22,539 --> 01:32:25,007
Just as expected,
a marriage announcement!

574
01:32:25,075 --> 01:32:28,169
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss. Yoo Harin
will now throw the first pitch

575
01:32:31,081 --> 01:32:32,673
You know what to do

576
01:32:49,266 --> 01:32:52,702
Mr. Yoon, front page news, Yoo Harin's...

577
01:32:54,905 --> 01:32:55,837
What are you doing Kang?

578
01:32:56,006 --> 01:32:57,200
Just wait

579
01:33:02,012 --> 01:33:04,446
Go ahead, Ms. Yoo

580
01:33:28,372 --> 01:33:29,566
Go ahead

581
01:34:20,023 --> 01:34:22,890
Thanks for the 48th letter

582
01:34:24,595 --> 01:34:29,362
I've gotta hurry! This is an exclusive!

583
01:34:31,468 --> 01:34:43,403
Yes. Yoo Harin and Byun Jimin
have announced their marriage...

584
01:34:44,514 --> 01:34:57,518
Mr. Yoon? This is Kang, will you
just trust me one more time?

585
01:35:06,203 --> 01:35:10,936
'It's over between us'
'I wish you the best'

586
01:35:17,981 --> 01:35:20,074
Aren't you going to yell "Play Ball"?!

587
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:53,939
Hyun joo!

588
01:36:07,331 --> 01:36:09,697
Get out to my way!

589
01:36:10,267 --> 01:36:12,064
I warned you!

590
01:36:53,844 --> 01:36:54,811
Oh my lord!

591
01:37:46,963 --> 01:37:54,927
This is all I know of their story.
Some say it's like a fairy tale

592
01:37:55,572 --> 01:38:00,339
But it doesn't seem too educational
to pass it on to our children

593
01:38:02,546 --> 01:38:06,448
Who knows how many times the sun rose
in the west without our knowing?

594
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:12,119
Who knows?
