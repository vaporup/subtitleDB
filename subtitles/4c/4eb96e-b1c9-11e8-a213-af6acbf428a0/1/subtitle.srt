<i>HOPE</i>

00:01:38,913 --> 00:01:41,689
<i>HOPE'S VARIETY</i>

3
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,760
When's the meeting?

4
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:50,129
What?

5
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,430
You're ready already?

6
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:54,263
Okay, okay.

7
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:56,704
Hold on.

8
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:57,809
Man...

9
00:01:58,332 --> 00:02:02,576
You never came to
the PTA meetings last year.

10
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:05,047
If you're late,
you'll get on their bad side.

11
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:08,052
I'm almost ready.

12
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,213
I didn't even do
the breakfast dishes.

13
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:14,087
Do that later
and come out now!

14
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:15,760
Okay, okay.

15
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:18,058
I'm ready!

16
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:19,460
I'm leaving!

17
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,931
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

18
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:24,860
Where do I go?

19
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,564
Dog meat?

20
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,434
I can't eat that.

21
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:33,209
<i>SAFETY FIRST</i>

22
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:53,955
Ding, dong, dang, dong!

23
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:58,903
It's time for our lunch break!

24
00:02:59,026 --> 00:03:04,271
Today's menu is chicken soup!

25
00:03:04,398 --> 00:03:08,278
I, the factory manager,
will eat last as always.

26
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:11,110
Please only take one piece

27
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,420
for those behind you.

28
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:16,447
Hey! you!

29
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:18,624
Don't eat two pieces
like last time!

30
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:20,454
Or I'll kill ya!

31
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:22,422
Dong-hoon?

32
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:23,955
Let's eat together.

33
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:25,052
Okay!

34
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:30,165
Cheers everyone!

35
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:36,430
Summer break is coming up.

36
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:39,204
What should we get the teacher?

37
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:40,837
How about a dress?

38
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:42,777
- Good idea.
- Great.

39
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,972
What do you think, Mi-hee?

40
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:46,712
Huh?

41
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:50,948
How about a flowerpot...

42
00:03:51,345 --> 00:03:52,221
Forget it!

43
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,426
These days, we give gift cards.

44
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:59,697
How much should we give?

45
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:03,002
You decide, Vice-President.

46
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:04,832
- Of course.
- Yeah.

47
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:05,835
Let's go.

48
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:08,703
Then, I'll text you
on how much we'll pitch in.

49
00:04:08,796 --> 00:04:11,037
- It was good.
- Yeah.

50
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:13,908
- I'm full.
- Did we collect fees today?

51
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:14,910
How much do we pay?

52
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:17,074
- We ate a lot.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:20,285
Hope's Mom? You'll pay?

54
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,885
- Me?
- Why not.

55
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:27,521
How about you and I
split the bill this time?

56
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,958
I didn't even eat!

57
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:33,898
She's too busy at the store
and never came out much.

58
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:37,962
She always said
she should treat you ladies.

59
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:41,472
Should we give
Hope's Mom a chance then?

60
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:43,235
Why not?

61
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:47,438
- Thanks, Mrs. IM.
- Thanks.

62
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:49,946
How much you got?

63
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:55,078
I have $20.

64
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:57,414
Take credit cards?

65
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:04,219
$198? That's insane!

66
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:07,361
Damn women ate a whole dog!

67
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:09,535
It's to get on their good side.

68
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,060
Or else your kid will get left out.

69
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:13,860
<i>WATERMELON $20</i>

70
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:14,994
<i>WATERMELON $20
Why's it so dang expensive?</i>

71
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:16,235
Why's it so dang expensive?

72
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:22,145
Tell your husband
to give Hope's Dad a raise.

73
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:25,340
He's only the manager,
not the boss.

74
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:30,216
By the way,
aren't you going to tell him?

75
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:32,682
How can he not tell?

76
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:33,883
Looks like it's a boy.

77
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:36,393
He has no interest in me.

78
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:40,190
Then, how'd you end up
getting pregnant?

79
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:46,096
Honestly, we did it once
in 3 years and it happened.

80
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:48,604
3 Years?

81
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,036
My husband is always all over me.

82
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,443
He can't get enough of me.

83
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:57,812
How can I raise two
when one is so hard?

84
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,212
Why you!

85
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,315
Have the baby.
It'll grow on its own.

86
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:07,391
Really none left?

87
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:09,352
Nope.

88
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:13,364
No sense of loyalty!

89
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,001
IM Dong-hoon?
Is it good?

90
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,443
Yup!

91
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:31,881
I only ate one, honest.

92
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,484
The bones can't be from one!

93
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:38,382
Like it?

94
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,583
It's good.

95
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,754
Don't you get food at home?

96
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,830
Yeah, I do. Just rice, though.

97
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:50,399
I'm so skinny,
but my wife's getting fat.

98
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:52,001
Good for you, pal.

99
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,865
I can't eat at home or here.

100
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,672
I only get rice at home and here, too.

101
00:06:57,865 --> 00:06:59,867
And my three sons say I stink

102
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:02,444
and won't ever come to me.

103
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:06,313
Want it?

104
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,585
- Forget it, man!
- Fine.

105
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:22,757
Give it to me.
You got three of the same.

106
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:25,699
But this is a rare card.

107
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:27,667
Yours isn't.

108
00:07:27,862 --> 00:07:29,000
Want it?

109
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:32,037
Let's trade with this.

110
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:34,972
This one for five of those.

111
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:38,207
Young-seek! You cheapskate!

112
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,320
- No deal! Cheapskate!
- Let's go.

113
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:01,869
What?

114
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,470
What?

115
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,214
Wait for me!

116
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:33,296
Dang!

117
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:36,541
I died again! This sucks!

118
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,572
Hey!

119
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:38,938
HAN Young-seek!

120
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,141
What?

121
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:42,874
That's not yours!
Don't hit it!

122
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,044
I paid to play on this!
What's it to you!

123
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,913
Why you little!

124
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,923
Little?

125
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:03,863
Fine. Your face is way bigger.
So there!

126
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:05,595
Wanna die!

127
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,703
Mommy! I'm home!

128
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,938
Hi, Hope.

129
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:21,653
Young-seek is the problem.

130
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,377
What are you grumbling?

131
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,788
Try this.

132
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:37,326
I don't get this at all.

133
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,801
Get what?

134
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,065
It's a math question.

135
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:45,608
I can solve most questions.

136
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,047
But I have no clue with this.

137
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:52,184
How can a Grade 2 math question
be so hard?

138
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:53,774
Read it again.

139
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:55,544
Should I ask Daddy?

140
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:56,949
Daddy?

141
00:09:57,111 --> 00:09:59,523
He probably won't know
more than me.

142
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:02,555
Come eat!

143
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:05,287
'Young-su has 9 pencils

144
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:08,731
and Jin-hee has 3.'

145
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:13,302
'How can they have the same
number of pencils?'

146
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,963
'Write your answer.'

147
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:18,736
So? What did you write?

148
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:20,345
Nothing.

149
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:21,802
Why?

150
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:26,676
Just add 9 and 3 together,

151
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,616
then divide by 2.

152
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:32,121
It's not that easy!

153
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:36,555
Think Young-su is Young-seek.

154
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:39,460
And Jin-hee is me.

155
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,994
Young-seek?

156
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:46,503
There's no way
Young-seek would give the pencils.

157
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:49,166
For us to have the same,

158
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:52,937
he'd have to give me 3 pencils.

159
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:56,238
There's no way

160
00:10:56,403 --> 00:10:58,474
he'd ever give me anything!

161
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,950
That's not the answer!

162
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,814
Dong-hoon, say something.

163
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:09,227
Listen to your mom.

164
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:11,420
Don't start fighting with her.

165
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:21,132
Spicy noodles give me ulcers.

166
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:23,708
- Don't eat it, then!
- I didn't say I won't.

167
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:26,535
Forget it.
Go watch baseball!

168
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,302
I'll raise Hope by myself.

169
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:30,808
Really?

170
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:35,314
Listen good to your mom.

171
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:40,649
Stupid!

172
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:49,367
Let's get you to bed.

Kokomong, the sausage

174
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:59,273
Silly, playful Kokomong

175

A whiz inventor, Kokomong

176

Leader of the kids, Kokomong!

177
00:12:07,474 --> 00:12:09,920
Young-seek?
You waiting for Hope?

178
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:14,386
No way.
I'm not waiting for her.

179
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:16,151
Then, what are you doing here?

180
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:18,592
I'm waiting for the boys.

181
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:20,590

' Okay! Let's go!</i>

Know how to tie hair?

184

Of course I do.

I'm on my way out.

189
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:52,258
Your second son's sick?

190
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:56,700
The flu? Oh no.

191
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,992
I can get there in 20 minutes.

192
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:06,143
Sign for the goods,
then open the factory?

193
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,402
Okay. Bye.

194
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:11,946
Ouch! Forget it!

195
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:13,847
Why?

196
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:16,318
I'll tie it up pretty.

197
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,716
Forget it!

198
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:21,255
I always just pin my hair!

199
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:25,092
Mommy's always busy!

200
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:29,224
You look prettier
with your hair pinned.

201
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:39,677
Hope went to school, right?

202
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:40,870
She's still home.

203
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:43,073
- Oh no! She's late!
- Got it.

204
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:45,114
The other kids already went!

205
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:47,878
I gotta go check on stuff coming in.

206
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,551
Where's the umbrella?

207
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,156

Want Mommy to walk you to school?

I can run there in 3 minutes.

But...

237
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:34,678
I'm late for school...

238
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:55,993
They're coming in now.
I'll count everything.

Oh my, my. my!

What? Something happened?

00:19:05,892 --> 00:19:10,068
There are cops everywhere
outside the school.

00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:12,340
The school?

247
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:16,912
I came by to give Young-seek
his umbrella.

But you know
the construction site near here?

249
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:24,549
One girl was found

Yes, I am.

How was she
when you first found her?

00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:19,877
She had severe facial injuries
and was bleeding all over.

264
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:21,502
And barely conscious.

265
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:23,375
Then, who made the report?

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,576
- We got a call from 911.
- Really?

267
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:29,286
She called us directly.

Please calm down, ma'am.

lacerations from the rectum to colon.

Which road was she on?

285
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:15,151
Was it the big road?

What do you mean?

287
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:20,190
I told her to go that way...

288
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:25,197

She called me!
Said a girl was dying by the school.

An artificial anus?

309
00:23:45,438 --> 00:23:47,440
Colostomy to put
the small intestine outside.

I thought Mommy and you

328
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:31,339

331
00:27:37,804 --> 00:27:40,751
He was wearing beige pants.

333
00:27:45,445 --> 00:27:47,015

Okay?

337

It's okay.

00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:17,948
The police say they almost caught him

341
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:20,983
<i>" Really?
' Yes!</i>

342
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:23,551
When you get a good rest...

343
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:31,658
Daddy and the cops
will have caught him.

344
00:28:32,158 --> 00:28:34,138
So go to sleep, Sweetie.

345
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:38,201
Okay, Daddy.

346
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:42,845
My throat feels dry.

347
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:47,408
And I feel like I'll go poo.

348
00:29:30,183 --> 00:29:31,423
Yes, sir.

349
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:34,829
Yes, Chief.

350
00:29:42,662 --> 00:29:45,541
Results came for the fingerprints
found at the scene.

351
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:48,938
Did they find him?
Arrest him?

352
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:51,643
We found a match out of ex-cons

353
00:29:51,737 --> 00:29:53,876
and located his whereabouts.

354
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:00,586
Why aren't you arresting him!

355
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:02,782
Constable LEE!

356
00:30:02,915 --> 00:30:05,191
Why'd you bring him here?

357
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:10,627
Have a seat, sir.

358
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,267
Who's the bastard?

359
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:13,835
Where does he live?

360
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:17,431
I'm not allowed
to give you any details.

361
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,873
You got his prints!

362
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:20,501
You know who he is!

363
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:24,942
But we can't arrest him
with just his fingerprints.

364
00:30:28,474 --> 00:30:30,511
He's here? Who is it?

365
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:34,950
There's not enough evidence.

366
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:37,459
I can't arrest him without a warrant.

367
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,587
Why can't you get a warrant!

368
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:40,857
Sir?

369
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:45,295
The fingerprints could be
from anyone passing through.

370
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:48,265
We need more definite
evidence for a warrant.

371
00:30:48,394 --> 00:30:50,305
What more evidence do you need!

372
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:54,275
Like surveillance cam footages or DNA.

373
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:58,313
There were no cams at the scene
and no DNA yet.

374
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:04,354
If the victim testifies

375
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,447
and identifies him...

376
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:09,024
we won't need a warrant.

377
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:11,461
Testify?

378
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:16,597
Then, can you arrest him now?

379
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:21,865
She can't get investigated like that.

380
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:23,868
It's just testifying.

381
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:27,569
Whatever! She's your child!

382
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:30,905
You want her to recall
that horrific day?

383
00:31:31,304 --> 00:31:33,716
You call yourself a father?

384
00:31:34,674 --> 00:31:37,712
Don't you have any feelings?

385
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:39,920
Feelings?

386
00:31:43,182 --> 00:31:46,356
Fine. Let's say I don't.

387
00:31:48,054 --> 00:31:49,294
Ma
hm?

388

Sunflower Center helps
sexually abused children.

They help children
deal with the trauma.

390
00:31:59,198 --> 00:32:01,371
Why did this happen
to our little girl?

391
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:06,341
If only cops watched
the bastards better...

392
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,644
why would this happen!

393
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:10,344
Sit down.

394
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:13,484
We have to get that bastard!

395
00:32:13,746 --> 00:32:15,521
Please calm down.

396
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:18,152
How can we!

397
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,097
Please go home and bring

398
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:33,368
her toys and journals.

399
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:35,771
What?

400
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:38,879
That's what the therapist asked for.

401
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:41,140
I'll try to convince your wife.

Must you do this now?

404
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:14,408
We have to catch the culprit.

405
00:34:16,435 --> 00:34:19,075
It's only been three days.

406
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:21,648
She's psychologically unstable.

407
00:34:23,142 --> 00:34:24,815
Are you sure?

408
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:27,654
It'll be the same no matter when.

409
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:30,718
It's not easy for her.

410
00:34:32,852 --> 00:34:35,662
I won't do it
without the parents' consent.

411

Hope...

412
00:34:50,236 --> 00:34:52,216
asked to catch the culprit.

413
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,051
Are you sure about this?

414
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:02,790
Yes...

00:35:17,496 --> 00:35:19,476
You don't want to?

418
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:27,951
Then, you can just nod.

419
00:35:29,975 --> 00:35:31,886
Can you see me?

420
00:35:38,217 --> 00:35:41,357
Kokomong, the sausage

As you see...

424
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:04,454
IM Hope can state opinions

425
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,317
and is clearly conscious.

426
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:11,125
Sweetie?

427
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:14,023
It rained a lot that day, right?

428
00:36:21,594 --> 00:36:23,904
You met a bad man on the way

429
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:26,669
to school and had a close call?

430
00:36:31,604 --> 00:36:33,584
About the bad man...

431
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,086
Think you can tell me?

Is this the man?

What makes you think
this is him?

435
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:43,680
The face...

436
00:37:44,076 --> 00:37:45,783
Eyes...

437
00:37:47,146 --> 00:37:48,625
Mouth...

438
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:50,956
Really?

Hope?

442
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:10,613
Can you point him out again?

443
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:18,381
Hope? Can we give it another try?

444
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,989
Good girl.

445
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,913
As time goes,
she could behave differently.

446
00:38:45,904 --> 00:38:48,282
She could suddenly start screaming...

447
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:50,812
Or not talk at all.

448
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:55,018
What do you mean?

449
00:38:59,218 --> 00:39:02,131
She needs both physical
and emotional healing.

450
00:39:02,421 --> 00:39:05,095
It may be hard
with just the family's help.

451
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:11,406
The whole family
may all need treatment, too.

The victim's identification

He was recently released

Hear about the child rape case?

517
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:11,742
The girl was just 8 years-old.

I heard she's in this hospital.

619
00:52:50,348 --> 00:52:51,725
You should talk.

620
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,187
Threatening me

that I knew everything

That if I told even one person...

00:53:48,206 --> 00:53:50,345
you'd rip my mouth off?

632

I guess word travels fast.

633
00:53:56,314 --> 00:53:57,987
I didn't say I'd rip it off.

634
00:53:58,683 --> 00:54:00,594
I said I could rip it off.

635
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:14,173
Trying to act strong...

636
00:54:14,832 --> 00:54:16,743

They were outside my house
on the day of the arrest.

679
00:56:59,664 --> 00:57:00,540
Objection!

680
00:57:00,698 --> 00:57:04,077
The defendant just claims to have
lost and found them.

681
00:57:04,302 --> 00:57:06,509
There is no evidence to support that.

682
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:08,478
Is there evidence to prove it?

683
00:57:08,739 --> 00:57:09,945
We're searching, Your Honor.

684
00:57:10,374 --> 00:57:13,753
We'll ask the construction workers

685
00:57:14,545 --> 00:57:15,683
and find proof.

686
00:57:15,913 --> 00:57:17,586
Then, present it when you find it.

687
00:57:18,483 --> 00:57:21,430
The next hearing will be
at 3:00 PM on September 25th.

688
00:57:21,586 --> 00:57:23,122
Court is adjourned.

689
00:57:27,658 --> 00:57:29,262
You bastard!

690
00:57:29,961 --> 00:57:33,238
You call yourself human!

691
00:57:33,531 --> 00:57:36,102
After what you did to her!
You bastard!

692
00:57:37,902 --> 00:57:39,677
You don't remember?

693
00:57:39,904 --> 00:57:43,215
You son of a bitch!

694
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:48,613
Memorized your moves?

695
00:57:48,913 --> 00:57:50,586
Yes, I did!

696
00:57:50,982 --> 00:57:51,892
Me, too!

697
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:53,926
But I can't.

698
00:57:54,552 --> 00:57:55,496
Don't worry.

699
00:57:55,553 --> 00:57:58,397
If you miss anything,
I'll jump right in.

700
00:57:58,990 --> 00:57:59,798
Ready?

701
00:58:00,157 --> 00:58:03,434
It's okay if you make mistakes.
Just make big moves.

702
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:04,971
One at a time.

703
00:58:28,219 --> 00:58:29,698
Hello, everyone!

704
00:58:29,954 --> 00:58:31,763
I'm Kokomong!

705
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:35,464
Let's invent something
great today, too!

706
00:58:36,427 --> 00:58:39,897
Hello? I'm pretty Aromi!

707
00:58:40,064 --> 00:58:42,772
Why am I so beautiful?

708
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:47,148
Tada!

709
00:58:47,305 --> 00:58:49,148
I'm Kero!

710
00:58:49,307 --> 00:58:52,254
Want to see the new dance I made?

711
00:58:56,113 --> 00:59:00,926
All our friends are here.
What will happen today?

712
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:03,858
Let's go to Refrigerator Land!

713
00:59:10,461 --> 00:59:13,704
Let's roll together!

714
00:59:14,031 --> 00:59:19,031
Let's gather together!
Kokomong is calling!

715
00:59:20,571 --> 00:59:22,175
It's time for fun!

716
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,044
- It'll be fun!
- It'll be fun!

717
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:27,887
Let's roll together!
Hurray!

718
00:59:28,012 --> 00:59:31,425
Let's gather together!
Hurray! Hurrah!

719
00:59:31,482 --> 00:59:37,922
Hold Kokomong's hand
and run like the wind!

720
00:59:38,322 --> 00:59:41,633
Kokomong! Kokomong!

721
00:59:41,826 --> 00:59:45,273
I love Kokomong!

722
00:59:45,396 --> 00:59:48,377
Today and tomorrow

723
00:59:48,866 --> 00:59:52,211
Let's play together every day!

724
00:59:52,269 --> 00:59:55,546
Let's roll together!
Hurray!

725
00:59:55,706 --> 00:59:59,051
Let's gather together!
Hurray! Hurrah!

726
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:05,493
Hold Kokomong's hand
and run like the wind!

727
01:00:13,157 --> 01:00:14,033
Hey!

728
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:15,829
How did the trial go?

729
01:00:17,061 --> 01:00:19,098
There's no result
on the first day.

730
01:00:19,363 --> 01:00:21,274
- When's the next trial?
- A month later.

731
01:00:22,066 --> 01:00:24,137
What are you doing with this on?

732
01:00:24,702 --> 01:00:25,976
Can't you tell?

733
01:00:27,304 --> 01:00:28,783
Thought you hated that therapist.

734
01:00:30,174 --> 01:00:32,814
Who cares?
When she'll help my child...

735
01:00:38,849 --> 01:00:39,793
Young-seok's Mom!

736
01:00:40,184 --> 01:00:41,390
- You came?
- Yes.

737
01:00:42,353 --> 01:00:45,766
When you're done drinking,
go trade with the egg.

738
01:00:46,023 --> 01:00:46,763
Okay.

739
01:00:55,399 --> 01:00:56,707
Water, please.

740
01:00:57,435 --> 01:00:59,676
- You came?
- Yes.

741
01:01:00,905 --> 01:01:02,111
You, too?

742
01:01:02,406 --> 01:01:04,010
Ah, yes...

743
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:07,285
I spent the whole day
with the sisters.

744
01:01:08,045 --> 01:01:08,921
Sisters?

745
01:01:10,247 --> 01:01:11,954
Yes! Sisters!

746
01:01:12,683 --> 01:01:17,428
Women fight easily
and get close easily.

747
01:01:17,788 --> 01:01:18,664
I see...

748
01:01:19,323 --> 01:01:22,702
My role is kind of important.
I'd better go back in.

749
01:01:22,793 --> 01:01:24,272
- Of course.
- Bye.

750
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:43,588
Aromi!

751
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:46,327
Kokomong!

752
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:48,658
Eat lots.

753
01:01:51,722 --> 01:01:55,636
Drawing pictures and compliments

754
01:01:55,826 --> 01:01:57,134
won't open up her heart.

755
01:01:57,828 --> 01:02:01,037
Kids relieve stress my laughing

756
01:02:01,132 --> 01:02:03,271
and playing till they sweat.

757
01:02:04,802 --> 01:02:10,013
It's $19 an hour per costume
for 2 hours.

758
01:02:10,174 --> 01:02:13,212
You borrowed 4 costumes.

759
01:02:13,377 --> 01:02:14,981
So, it comes to $152.

760
01:02:15,446 --> 01:02:18,325
One helper costs $10 per hour.

761
01:02:18,516 --> 01:02:20,962
So for two hours that's $80.

762
01:02:21,018 --> 01:02:24,227
But since the ladies helped.
It comes to $172.

763
01:02:24,855 --> 01:02:26,459
Just give us $150.

764
01:02:27,158 --> 01:02:29,263
Why does it cost so much?

765
01:02:29,493 --> 01:02:31,666
It's all for a good cause.

766
01:02:37,101 --> 01:02:38,512
- It's $150.
- Right...

767
01:02:46,043 --> 01:02:47,488
Do you take Visa?

768
01:02:48,012 --> 01:02:49,514
- Visa?
- Yes.

769
01:02:51,448 --> 01:02:52,392
Sure.

770
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,324
Here you are.

771
01:02:57,488 --> 01:03:04,064
How much is it to borrow this
for the day?

772
01:03:05,396 --> 01:03:08,070
It's $70 for the day.

773
01:03:08,165 --> 01:03:11,738
For a week it's $350.

774
01:03:12,703 --> 01:03:13,875
- Well...
- Yes?

775
01:03:14,104 --> 01:03:17,881
Can you give a discount?

776
01:03:18,075 --> 01:03:20,077
Or accept installments?

777
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:22,481
- Installments?
- Yes.

778
01:03:24,348 --> 01:03:25,622
Hold on!

779
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:34,267
This is kind of old.

780
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:38,201
We don't use it much.

781
01:03:39,964 --> 01:03:41,068
So?

782
01:03:46,904 --> 01:03:49,510
Just use it and give it back later.

783
01:03:50,608 --> 01:03:52,144
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

784
01:03:54,678 --> 01:03:55,918
Cheer up, sir.

785
01:03:56,881 --> 01:03:58,121
- Thank you!
- Sure!

786
01:04:02,386 --> 01:04:03,490
Thank you!

787
01:04:12,796 --> 01:04:13,934
My daughter...

788
01:04:14,765 --> 01:04:16,972
experienced the same thing as Hope.

789
01:04:19,103 --> 01:04:22,710
When she was sixteen,
she committed suicide.

790
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:27,889
That same year...

791
01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:33,558
I drove my car into the river to die.

792
01:04:35,586 --> 01:04:36,997
As you can see...

793
01:04:39,356 --> 01:04:40,835
I just lost my legs.

794
01:04:41,992 --> 01:04:43,630
And I'm still alive like this.

795
01:04:47,231 --> 01:04:49,177
The man who did that
to my daughter...

796
01:04:52,536 --> 01:04:54,812
is still alive and roaming free.

797
01:05:01,812 --> 01:05:03,189
Can you sleep well?

798
01:05:04,114 --> 01:05:05,491
You don't look good.

799
01:05:09,153 --> 01:05:10,530
I can't sleep much.

800
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:14,868
5 months?

801
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,161
6 months?

802
01:05:19,129 --> 01:05:22,736
It's due in November.

803
01:06:36,673 --> 01:06:38,653
<i>MY FRIENDS WENT HOME</i>

804
01:07:11,742 --> 01:07:13,517
<i>REFRIGERATOR LAND?</i>

805
01:07:37,201 --> 01:07:39,181
<i>YOU GO HOME, TOO</i>

806
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:59,662
<i>YOUR FRIENDS ARE WAITING</i>

807
01:08:32,089 --> 01:08:34,899
Now that Hope is eating,

808
01:09:07,257 --> 01:09:10,238
<i>YOUR FRIENDS ARE WAITING</i>

809
01:09:37,821 --> 01:09:38,765
Now.

810
01:09:40,524 --> 01:09:43,095
I'm going to ask some questions.

811
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,906
And you answer, okay Hope?

812
01:09:47,898 --> 01:09:49,138
Good!

813
01:09:49,299 --> 01:09:52,906
Let's put one on
since you answered.

814
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:00,855
Want me to put one first?

815
01:10:05,782 --> 01:10:08,922
You're not talking much these days?

816
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:16,130
Hope?

817
01:10:17,661 --> 01:10:19,436
Can you talk today?

818
01:10:25,269 --> 01:10:28,307
Would you like to put one on?

819
01:10:34,645 --> 01:10:38,491
This is the night sky.

820
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:42,655
When the night sky
gets filled with butterflies...

821
01:10:43,687 --> 01:10:47,100
Hope will be able to speak again.

822
01:10:47,758 --> 01:10:50,204
And sleep well again.

823
01:10:50,994 --> 01:10:53,975
And also be able
to solve hard math problems.

824
01:10:54,765 --> 01:10:57,302
Isn't that amazing?

825
01:11:02,506 --> 01:11:03,678
Hope?

826
01:11:05,709 --> 01:11:07,347
Then, can you write?

827
01:11:17,187 --> 01:11:18,996
<i>YES</i>

828
01:11:24,261 --> 01:11:27,140
Hope? What's today's date?

829
01:11:29,566 --> 01:11:31,546
<i>AUGUST 24TH</i>

830
01:11:32,836 --> 01:11:34,713
That's right!

831
01:11:35,038 --> 01:11:37,416
So, you must be on summer break.

832
01:11:44,147 --> 01:11:46,320
How many days till school starts?

833
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,134
3 days?

834
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,532
What do you want to do most
when school starts?

835
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:03,773
Can I go to school?

836
01:12:03,867 --> 01:12:04,743
Of course!

837
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:15,285
<i>THAT'S A LIE</i>

838
01:12:16,947 --> 01:12:19,052
Why do you think it's a lie?

839
01:12:19,282 --> 01:12:21,387
Why do you think you can't go?

840
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,265
I'm embarrassed.

841
01:12:28,692 --> 01:12:30,194
What are you embarrassed of?

842
01:12:37,601 --> 01:12:40,275
<i>WHAT HAPPENED</i>

843
01:12:43,206 --> 01:12:44,082
That day?

844
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:49,782
I'm not going to tell my friends.

845
01:12:54,484 --> 01:12:57,465
You think they know or don't know?

846
01:12:57,521 --> 01:12:59,660
I think they know.

847
01:13:11,535 --> 01:13:12,309
Give me one.

848
01:13:16,907 --> 01:13:18,079
I can have it all?

849
01:13:19,209 --> 01:13:20,711
No changing minds!

850
01:13:21,445 --> 01:13:22,185
Let's go.

851
01:13:22,879 --> 01:13:23,755
See ya.

852
01:13:27,818 --> 01:13:31,960
Where will you say you went
when you were away?

853
01:13:33,623 --> 01:13:35,364
I thought...

854
01:13:35,425 --> 01:13:39,373
I'll say I went to my cousin's
with my parents.

855
01:13:39,529 --> 01:13:41,907
Or went on a trip.

856
01:13:43,834 --> 01:13:49,375
If I don't explain well,
bad rumors could start.

857
01:14:06,122 --> 01:14:09,103
<i>CLASSROOM RULES</i>

858
01:14:09,326 --> 01:14:14,969
What didn't you like most
about being sick?

859
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:18,370
Missing school...

860
01:14:19,936 --> 01:14:24,043
And my parent being unable
to go to work.

861
01:14:25,509 --> 01:14:27,182
Spending lots of money...

862
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:41,029
<i>HOW TO TALK WITH
YOUR DAUGHTER</i>

863
01:14:44,528 --> 01:14:48,704
The man asked me
to share my umbrella.

864
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:54,444
I thought of just leaving.

865
01:14:56,907 --> 01:15:02,255
But he was all wet in the rain
and I should share.

866
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,984
So, I did.

867
01:15:06,049 --> 01:15:11,192
People say it's my fault
and don't say I did right.

868
01:15:16,626 --> 01:15:17,866
Oh my!

869
01:15:18,895 --> 01:15:20,135
Good job!

870
01:15:20,897 --> 01:15:22,069
I'm beat!

871
01:15:22,632 --> 01:15:23,975
Give it to me.

872
01:15:33,043 --> 01:15:39,483
What do you want to do most
when you leave the hospital?

873
01:15:41,751 --> 01:15:45,028
Go to school
and meet my friends.

874
01:15:46,056 --> 01:15:47,797
And see the baby being born.

875
01:15:49,793 --> 01:15:53,832
But I won't be able
to go to school...

876
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:59,472
and I'm worried
my homework isn't done.

877
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:07,315
When the baby's born,
I want to hold it...

878
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:11,425
But with this on...

879
01:16:12,382 --> 01:16:18,765
I'm worried I'll get
dirty stuff all over the baby.

880
01:16:21,491 --> 01:16:26,167
And what if my parents

881
01:16:26,262 --> 01:16:30,711
only love the pretty baby?

882
01:16:31,501 --> 01:16:33,606
<i>PM SLEEPING.
COME AGAIN</i>

883
01:16:55,592 --> 01:16:58,596
It's Kokomong!

884
01:17:06,736 --> 01:17:11,310
Ever have a thought like this?

885
01:17:12,909 --> 01:17:18,985
Hoping things will be like before
when you wake up...

886
01:17:20,884 --> 01:17:23,956
Yesterday, I thought that.

887
01:17:24,254 --> 01:17:29,727
I felt like things will go back
to normal, when I wake up.

888
01:17:32,862 --> 01:17:35,866
So, I took all my pills.

889
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,540
And prayed before going to bed.

890
01:17:42,472 --> 01:17:46,318
But when I woke up,
nothing changed.

891
01:17:55,852 --> 01:17:58,298
How do you feel then, Hope?

892
01:18:01,357 --> 01:18:07,569
Granny used to say
when she's frustrated...

893
01:18:08,331 --> 01:18:13,747
'I'm gonna die!'

894
01:18:15,772 --> 01:18:21,279
But now I think
I know what she meant.

895
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:30,261
'I'm gonna die'...
What do you think it means?

896
01:18:36,259 --> 01:18:38,296
Why was I born?

897
01:19:11,227 --> 01:19:13,639
Look, Hope! Isn't it pretty?

898
01:19:13,797 --> 01:19:14,969
Blow it out!

899
01:19:20,069 --> 01:19:23,482
- Congratulations, Hope!
- Thank you!

900
01:19:27,143 --> 01:19:32,616
We haven't been home so long,
I'm nervous.

901
01:19:33,249 --> 01:19:34,193
Are you?

902
01:19:38,288 --> 01:19:41,462
Can't we stay here?

903
01:19:41,991 --> 01:19:42,901
Why?

904
01:19:44,427 --> 01:19:47,670
Worried about going home?

905
01:19:54,971 --> 01:19:55,813
Ready?

906
01:19:56,539 --> 01:19:57,779
Finished paying?

907
01:20:00,276 --> 01:20:02,882
Gwang-sik lent me his car.
Let's go.

908
01:20:04,414 --> 01:20:05,518
Hope?

909
01:20:06,182 --> 01:20:09,288
Wanna go down with Daddy?

910
01:20:18,895 --> 01:20:19,896
I'll go first.

911
01:20:58,167 --> 01:20:59,111
What's wrong?

912
01:20:59,636 --> 01:21:00,706
Are you carsick?

913
01:21:01,804 --> 01:21:05,149
- We're almost home.
- Okay.

914
01:21:06,576 --> 01:21:09,022
It's okay, Hope.

915
01:21:18,121 --> 01:21:19,156
We're here.

916
01:21:22,225 --> 01:21:23,431
Take her in! Hurry!

917
01:21:24,227 --> 01:21:25,900
Hope, let's go in.

918
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:28,140
That's good.

919
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:33,376
It's okay, Hope.

920
01:21:35,104 --> 01:21:36,447
It's all right, Hope.

921
01:21:39,175 --> 01:21:39,880
Hurry in!

922
01:21:40,009 --> 01:21:43,718
Let's go.
We're home.

923
01:21:44,781 --> 01:21:47,387
It's okay.
We're home.

924
01:22:49,345 --> 01:22:51,291
Young-seek?
Came to see Hope?

925
01:22:52,248 --> 01:22:54,956
Did Hope come home?

926
01:22:55,151 --> 01:22:56,152
Sure.

927
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:58,192
Wanna see her?

928
01:22:58,454 --> 01:23:03,699
No, I was just passing by
and wondered...

929
01:23:04,027 --> 01:23:08,271
I heard you won't play with her

930
01:23:08,331 --> 01:23:10,504
cuz she said your face is too big.

931
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,035
Aw, man!

932
01:23:12,168 --> 01:23:15,115
Who says rumors like that?

933
01:23:16,739 --> 01:23:18,082
Hope's Mom told me.

934
01:23:19,542 --> 01:23:21,954
I'm going crazy...

935
01:23:22,678 --> 01:23:23,486
Why?

936
01:23:26,849 --> 01:23:28,760
What's the matter?

937
01:23:30,253 --> 01:23:35,999
I came to walk to school
with her that day.

938
01:23:37,326 --> 01:23:39,363
If we went together...

939
01:23:40,797 --> 01:23:43,505
nothing would've happened.

940
01:23:51,074 --> 01:23:53,350
What's with you, boy.

941
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:57,687
It's okay. Don't cry.

942
01:23:59,248 --> 01:24:00,852
It's all right.

943
01:24:02,085 --> 01:24:03,587
Want some candy?

944
01:24:05,955 --> 01:24:08,458
Let's go inside!

945
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:13,169
Greet teachers respectfully.

946
01:24:13,729 --> 01:24:16,107
Don't run in the hallways.

947
01:24:19,735 --> 01:24:23,706
Book report due tomorrow.

948
01:24:25,007 --> 01:24:28,079
Bring consent forms
for extra-curricular activities.

949
01:24:29,879 --> 01:24:31,984
I can take her there.

950
01:24:32,248 --> 01:24:35,491
The baby's about to pop out.
I'll take her.

951
01:24:35,551 --> 01:24:36,894
Let's put this on.

952
01:24:37,854 --> 01:24:38,924
Good.

953
01:24:39,122 --> 01:24:40,795
It's not that far.

954
01:24:40,857 --> 01:24:43,269
Mom, I wanna go with Hope.

955
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,530
Hear that?

956
01:24:46,562 --> 01:24:47,734
Heard that?

957
01:24:50,633 --> 01:24:51,634
Okay, then.

958
01:24:51,734 --> 01:24:53,907
We're all dressed and ready.

959
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:57,276
That's a good girl.

960
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:00,250
We're all set!

961
01:25:00,376 --> 01:25:04,017
Mommy?
The crackling sound is too loud.

962
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:06,826
Are you worried about that?

963
01:26:25,528 --> 01:26:29,670
If the colostomy bag ever
falls off or leaks...

964
01:26:29,732 --> 01:26:31,109
please call me.

965
01:26:31,534 --> 01:26:32,410
Of course.

966
01:26:32,602 --> 01:26:34,582
And can she avoid

967
01:26:34,637 --> 01:26:38,585
direct contact with male teachers?

968
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:42,018
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

969
01:26:42,111 --> 01:26:43,988
The teachers will take caution.

970
01:26:44,046 --> 01:26:47,619
Don't worry.

971
01:26:48,117 --> 01:26:52,827
Do you think the children
will make fun?

972
01:26:53,322 --> 01:26:58,294
With you doing all this,
they'll all be good, too.

973
01:26:59,095 --> 01:27:02,008
I'll come dressed

974
01:27:02,732 --> 01:27:04,575
more suitably next time.

975
01:27:07,503 --> 01:27:08,675
So sorry.

976
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:12,415
Take care.

977
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:14,920
I'll be going.

978
01:27:52,515 --> 01:27:54,495
<i>WHAT IF THE BAD MAN
COMES AGAIN?</i>

979
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:56,493
<i>PM SCARED.
I HOPE HE GETS PUNISHED.</i>

980
01:28:17,673 --> 01:28:20,415
Isn't today your day off?

981
01:28:20,576 --> 01:28:21,554
Oh no...

982
01:28:23,379 --> 01:28:24,824
Hope didn't go to school?

983
01:28:25,748 --> 01:28:27,091
Didn't I tell you?

984
01:28:27,383 --> 01:28:29,158
We're seeing
the therapist today.

985
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:31,764
Oh, right...

986
01:28:47,236 --> 01:28:48,681
Hang in there.

987
01:28:49,505 --> 01:28:52,918
She says Hope is getting
a lot better.

988
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:55,348
I'm okay...

989
01:28:59,548 --> 01:29:01,494
How is Hope's father doing?

990
01:29:02,818 --> 01:29:05,890
He leaves before Hope gets up.

991
01:29:07,757 --> 01:29:11,899
I feel so sorry to him.

992
01:29:12,461 --> 01:29:14,372
Worrying about him...

993
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:16,901
You've gotten a lot better.

994
01:29:22,772 --> 01:29:24,718
Of all the kids in the world...

995
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:28,856
Why'd this happen
to our little girl?

996
01:29:32,047 --> 01:29:35,927
I wish the same thing happens
to all the kids in the world.

997
01:29:38,354 --> 01:29:43,269
Then, Hope wouldn't stand out
and be in pain more.

998
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,763
And?

999
01:29:48,964 --> 01:29:55,609
But after thinking like that...
I'd feel sorry to the baby.

1000
01:30:00,176 --> 01:30:05,285
This happened to Hope
because I'm so evil to the bone.

1001
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:10,326
I think.

1002
01:30:15,724 --> 01:30:17,863
Whenever I clean
her colostomy bag...

1003
01:30:23,265 --> 01:30:25,939
I'd wonder when it'll be over.

1004
01:30:31,941 --> 01:30:33,648
Did her grandmother live with you?

1005
01:30:37,046 --> 01:30:38,218
Yes.

1006
01:30:38,881 --> 01:30:42,886
My mom lived with us
till she died last year.

1007
01:30:43,853 --> 01:30:48,461
She used to say,
'I'm gonna die' all the time?

1008
01:30:50,459 --> 01:30:51,904
How did you know?

1009
01:30:52,628 --> 01:30:57,134
She said that when she moved
because of her arthritis.

1010
01:30:57,633 --> 01:31:01,171
When I asked Hope
what she thought that meant...

1011
01:31:01,871 --> 01:31:03,544
she thought for a while...

1012
01:31:05,174 --> 01:31:10,624
and said it meant,
'Why was I born?'

1013
01:31:25,294 --> 01:31:26,705
Hi, Young-seek.

1014
01:31:29,832 --> 01:31:35,373
Hope can't walk fast,
so you go a step behind her, okay?

1015
01:31:35,437 --> 01:31:37,314
- Okay.
- Good.

1016
01:31:38,207 --> 01:31:40,744
I can go by myself...

1017
01:31:41,076 --> 01:31:44,717
I'll walk behind you.

1018
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:47,861
Don't come near me.

1019
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:50,853
Fine. Go first.

1020
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:52,958
See you later.

1021
01:31:54,256 --> 01:31:55,826
Thanks, Young-seek.

1022
01:32:04,867 --> 01:32:07,939
Where are you off to again?
You should eat lunch!

1023
01:32:08,003 --> 01:32:09,038
I'll be back!

1024
01:32:09,238 --> 01:32:10,182
Where are you going?

1025
01:32:10,339 --> 01:32:11,374
Somewhere!

1026
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:08,039
Hope?

1027
01:33:09,131 --> 01:33:11,338
What's inside that bag?

1028
01:33:11,533 --> 01:33:13,274
Why do you want to know?

1029
01:33:18,607 --> 01:33:20,780
Want some candy?

1030
01:33:20,876 --> 01:33:22,253
- Yes!
- Me, too!

1031
01:33:27,216 --> 01:33:30,425
I gotta go home. Bye!

1032
01:33:30,552 --> 01:33:32,498
- See you tomorrow!
- See you tomorrow!

1033
01:34:04,286 --> 01:34:05,492
Hope!

1034
01:34:08,991 --> 01:34:12,666
The Kokomong over there...

1035
01:34:12,828 --> 01:34:15,240
Is that your new friend?

1036
01:34:20,102 --> 01:34:23,276
Is it a boy or a girl?

1037
01:34:37,986 --> 01:34:41,832
I have no idea.

1038
01:34:42,157 --> 01:34:44,603
Kokomong is just Kokomong.

1039
01:34:47,029 --> 01:34:48,337
Hope?

1040
01:34:49,865 --> 01:34:53,608
I just want to say,
don't be sick.

1041
01:34:56,472 --> 01:35:01,148
Sorry about before.

1042
01:35:05,347 --> 01:35:07,054
We're still friends, right?

1043
01:35:09,284 --> 01:35:10,160
Yup.

1044
01:35:10,385 --> 01:35:11,557
See you tomorrow.

1045
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:20,735
Kokomong!

1046
01:35:39,081 --> 01:35:40,253
You...

1047
01:35:50,592 --> 01:35:52,003
Are you...

1048
01:35:55,764 --> 01:35:57,368
Daddy?

1049
01:36:00,569 --> 01:36:02,207
You're Daddy, right?

1050
01:36:07,309 --> 01:36:08,720
Answer me!

1051
01:36:19,488 --> 01:36:28,932
Is it because
I keep avoiding you, Daddy?

1052
01:36:37,673 --> 01:36:38,777
Aren't you hot?

1053
01:36:49,017 --> 01:36:50,155
Let's go home.

1054
01:37:10,405 --> 01:37:11,509
I'm home.

1055
01:37:11,607 --> 01:37:13,211
Hi. Hope!

1056
01:37:13,308 --> 01:37:15,219
Oh my!

1057
01:37:17,479 --> 01:37:18,457
What's this?

1058
01:37:19,281 --> 01:37:20,089
It's Daddy.

1059
01:37:26,488 --> 01:37:29,526
Why you!
What are you doing in there?

1060
01:38:08,463 --> 01:38:11,603
Mr. IM Dong-hoon?

1061
01:38:12,401 --> 01:38:13,903
Registered mail!

1062
01:38:23,045 --> 01:38:25,855
<i>SUBPOENA FOR IM HOPE</i>

1063
01:38:26,148 --> 01:38:30,426
Why does Hope have to
go to court to testify?

1064
01:38:30,585 --> 01:38:33,862
The Defense submitted Hope's

1065
01:38:33,922 --> 01:38:35,629
psychological records as evidence.

1066
01:38:36,758 --> 01:38:40,103
The judge said her testimony

1067
01:38:40,195 --> 01:38:42,106
video is not reliable.

1068
01:38:42,497 --> 01:38:46,309
It's going to kill her.

1069
01:38:46,501 --> 01:38:51,541
Still... If she doesn't testify now,
things could get worse.

1070
01:38:53,809 --> 01:38:56,653
The sly bastard is claiming

1071
01:38:57,012 --> 01:38:59,583
physical and mental weakness.

1072
01:38:59,815 --> 01:39:01,089
What?

1073
01:39:01,416 --> 01:39:03,191
He wrote petitions saying

1074
01:39:03,318 --> 01:39:05,730
he can't remember when he's drunk.

1075
01:39:06,755 --> 01:39:08,735
If that gets recognized...

1076
01:39:09,124 --> 01:39:13,266
he'll get 15 years maximum
or get off in just 8 or 9 years.

1077
01:39:16,198 --> 01:39:17,404
Think it over, sir.

1078
01:39:17,966 --> 01:39:21,607
If Hope testifies before the judge,

1079
01:39:22,137 --> 01:39:23,980
he'll be cornered.

1080
01:39:31,313 --> 01:39:34,192
<i>CORRECTIONAL CENTER</i>

1081
01:39:40,355 --> 01:39:41,425
You sent...

1082
01:39:42,524 --> 01:39:44,231
three petitions?

1083
01:39:45,994 --> 01:39:46,802
Yes.

1084
01:39:47,729 --> 01:39:49,936
I don't remember it.

1085
01:39:51,166 --> 01:39:52,440
I'm frustrated, too.

1086
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:54,112
After what you did...

1087
01:39:55,504 --> 01:39:58,007
how can you not remember?

1088
01:39:58,974 --> 01:40:02,922
Whenever I drink,
I can't remember.

1089
01:40:04,112 --> 01:40:08,652
They force me to remember,
so my head hurts.

1090
01:40:09,351 --> 01:40:10,659
Your head hurts?

1091
01:40:13,722 --> 01:40:17,192
If I really did that, I deserve to die.

1092
01:40:18,994 --> 01:40:24,000
Doing that to a kid
can't be human, but a damn pig.

1093
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:34,780
Did you come to settle?

1094
01:40:43,452 --> 01:40:44,396
Settle?

1095
01:40:45,954 --> 01:40:49,094
I would love to be able to settle.

1096
01:40:50,258 --> 01:40:52,795
But I don't have anything.

1097
01:40:54,396 --> 01:40:57,934
If I get out soon,
maybe I can make money.

1098
01:40:59,801 --> 01:41:02,611
You know what I mean?

1099
01:41:06,575 --> 01:41:07,986
You went there!

1100
01:41:08,944 --> 01:41:10,252
You remember!

1101
01:41:10,946 --> 01:41:12,289
You know my daughter!

1102
01:41:13,482 --> 01:41:15,723
Think I'd let you walk, bastard?

1103
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:20,322
Don't swear to me.

1104
01:41:23,225 --> 01:41:25,796
Wondered why she was so cheeky...

1105
01:41:26,661 --> 01:41:28,368
Guess she takes after Daddy.

1106
01:41:30,098 --> 01:41:32,476
Think wisely.

1107
01:41:34,402 --> 01:41:36,848
How long do you think
I'd be in here?

1108
01:41:39,207 --> 01:41:40,686
I'll get out someday.

1109
01:41:43,612 --> 01:41:44,454
So what!

1110
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:46,553
What will you do!

1111
01:41:50,085 --> 01:41:51,655
Come out! You bastard!

1112
01:41:52,087 --> 01:41:53,293
Come here!

1113
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:23,859
My wife said...

1114
01:42:24,753 --> 01:42:29,930
she wished the same thing
happened to all the kids.

1115
01:42:31,927 --> 01:42:36,205
I thought that was
really bad of her.

1116
01:42:39,067 --> 01:42:40,444
But now, I think that.

1117
01:42:43,838 --> 01:42:45,112
I know how you feel.

1118
01:42:46,675 --> 01:42:49,622
You can't.
You didn't go through it.

1119
01:42:50,312 --> 01:42:51,154
Dong-hoon?

1120
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:53,882
Can you think differently?

1121
01:42:55,650 --> 01:42:57,027
That it was an accident?

1122
01:42:58,887 --> 01:43:01,834
Like she was walking one day

1123
01:43:01,957 --> 01:43:04,904
and got hit by a car.

1124
01:43:04,993 --> 01:43:06,028
An accident.

1125
01:43:06,528 --> 01:43:07,404
What?

1126
01:43:08,496 --> 01:43:09,406
An accident?

1127
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:14,544
Think of it that way
so your family can move on.

1128
01:43:17,339 --> 01:43:18,511
Stop the car.

1129
01:43:19,407 --> 01:43:20,351
Dong-hoon?

1130
01:43:20,475 --> 01:43:21,613
Stop the car!

1131
01:43:22,711 --> 01:43:23,621
Man...

1132
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:33,925
If it was your kid,
can you call it an accident?

1133
01:43:36,758 --> 01:43:37,964
I need to walk...

1134
01:43:53,675 --> 01:43:55,279
By chance...

1135
01:43:57,279 --> 01:43:59,054
Did you take insurance on me?

1136
01:43:59,514 --> 01:44:00,652
What insurance?

1137
01:44:01,583 --> 01:44:02,789
Life insurance?

1138
01:44:03,885 --> 01:44:05,228
Something like that...

1139
01:44:06,755 --> 01:44:08,928
I have no intention
and no money.

1140
01:44:10,025 --> 01:44:11,834
I'll work you like a dog forever!

1141
01:44:13,028 --> 01:44:15,634
In 10 years,
how old will Hope be?

1142
01:44:18,033 --> 01:44:19,137
Why?

1143
01:44:24,739 --> 01:44:26,878
The bastard could get out
in 8 or 9 years.

1144
01:44:28,343 --> 01:44:29,754
That's insane!

1145
01:44:30,312 --> 01:44:33,259
Hope won't even be 20.

1146
01:44:37,185 --> 01:44:41,065
If the trial goes wrong...

1147
01:44:42,957 --> 01:44:44,800
I'll deal with him on my own.

1148
01:44:46,928 --> 01:44:49,807
You'll kill him or something?

1149
01:44:50,265 --> 01:44:52,973
Why not! I could!

1150
01:45:03,244 --> 01:45:06,623
Since the Defense motioned against

1151
01:45:06,881 --> 01:45:08,690
the victim's video testimony...

1152
01:45:09,017 --> 01:45:10,655
I call IM Hope to the stand.

1153
01:45:23,598 --> 01:45:24,576
Hope?

1154
01:45:25,467 --> 01:45:26,878
Do you know why you're here?

1155
01:45:30,071 --> 01:45:31,345
Why did you come?

1156
01:45:33,274 --> 01:45:36,721
To punish the bad man.

1157
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:40,826
Do you remember taking the video

1158
01:45:40,882 --> 01:45:42,589
with the police in the hospital?

1159
01:45:45,353 --> 01:45:46,297
Yes.

1160
01:45:46,688 --> 01:45:48,565
You must've been in
a lot of pain then.

1161
01:45:49,357 --> 01:45:50,131
Yes.

1162
01:45:50,692 --> 01:45:52,137
But you still remembered?

1163
01:45:52,727 --> 01:45:53,569
Yes.

1164
01:45:54,863 --> 01:45:56,706
You saw pictures and

1165
01:45:56,765 --> 01:45:59,075
pointed out the bad man.

1166
01:46:03,204 --> 01:46:04,808
Could you do that again?

1167
01:46:08,109 --> 01:46:11,147
Hold your hand up
when his picture comes up.

1168
01:46:12,046 --> 01:46:12,922
Yes.

1169
01:46:43,478 --> 01:46:44,388
Hope?

1170
01:46:47,081 --> 01:46:48,526
Is this the man?

1171
01:46:53,822 --> 01:46:54,823
No more questions.

1172
01:47:00,929 --> 01:47:02,033
Hope?

1173
01:47:04,599 --> 01:47:06,078
On that day...

1174
01:47:06,701 --> 01:47:09,841
can you tell me
what the man smelled like?

1175
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:13,781
Did he smell like cigarettes?

1176
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:18,851
How about alcohol?

1177
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:23,128
Yes.

1178
01:47:23,985 --> 01:47:24,895
How much?

1179
01:47:31,759 --> 01:47:32,931
Did it smell a lot?

1180
01:47:42,637 --> 01:47:43,445
No more questions.

1181
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:18,617
The defendant could not prove

1182
01:48:18,873 --> 01:48:20,511
losing the shoes and vest.

1183
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:23,754
The victim's blood marked shoes

1184
01:48:23,811 --> 01:48:26,121
and vest belong to the defendant.

1185
01:48:26,648 --> 01:48:30,494
The defendant's fingerprints
were also found at the scene.

1186
01:48:31,319 --> 01:48:33,196
I never went there...

1187
01:48:34,722 --> 01:48:36,861
All the evidence points to you.

1188
01:48:37,425 --> 01:48:40,133
Although painful to recall,

1189
01:48:40,828 --> 01:48:42,501
the victim came and identified you.

1190
01:48:42,564 --> 01:48:43,599
Hope?

1191
01:48:45,133 --> 01:48:45,941
Are you okay?

1192
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,240
I ask you one last time.

1193
01:48:48,202 --> 01:48:49,545
You really can't remember?

1194
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,847
Did I really go there?

1195
01:48:55,243 --> 01:48:56,551
Do you accept the charges?

1196
01:48:57,145 --> 01:48:58,283
Did I do it?

1197
01:48:59,314 --> 01:49:02,352
If I did, I deserve to die.

1198
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:04,655
I'll take due punishment.

1199
01:49:05,086 --> 01:49:08,465
But I really don't remember anything.

1200
01:49:10,558 --> 01:49:14,267
I submit evidence of

1201
01:49:14,429 --> 01:49:17,342
the defendant's alcohol addiction.

1202
01:49:26,975 --> 01:49:29,888
Defendant?
Make your final statement.

1203
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:35,684
I really don't remember anything.

1204
01:49:36,317 --> 01:49:37,591
I'm innocent.

1205
01:49:40,488 --> 01:49:42,024
Are you finished?

1206
01:49:42,824 --> 01:49:43,928
No, sir!

1207
01:49:44,192 --> 01:49:45,296
Your Honor!

1208
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:49,574
I didn't do it.
I was too drunk.

1209
01:49:50,064 --> 01:49:51,907
I don't remember anything.

1210
01:49:52,133 --> 01:49:54,340
It's possible I didn't do it!

1211
01:49:55,336 --> 01:49:56,508
I'm innocent.

1212
01:49:57,205 --> 01:49:59,981
I'm wrongfully charged!

1213
01:50:03,911 --> 01:50:10,328
Sexual assault case 2012-211.
I've reached a verdict.

1214
01:50:16,924 --> 01:50:18,665
Defendant CHOI Jong-sool...

1215
01:50:20,795 --> 01:50:24,265
brutally assaulted
an 9 year-old.

1216
01:50:25,266 --> 01:50:27,576
Then, choked her and raped her.

1217
01:50:28,136 --> 01:50:31,640
The assault is ruthless
to the point of torturing.

1218
01:50:33,007 --> 01:50:34,350
Resulting from this...

1219
01:50:35,209 --> 01:50:37,189
the victim has been wounded

1220
01:50:37,412 --> 01:50:40,621
with a permanent disability.

1221
01:50:41,649 --> 01:50:45,187
He is responsible for scaring
the victim and family for life.

1222
01:50:46,487 --> 01:50:47,989
Also having a past record of abuse,

1223
01:50:48,723 --> 01:50:52,796
he must be punished severely.

1224
01:50:54,562 --> 01:50:55,472
However...

1225
01:50:56,431 --> 01:50:58,604
the defendant was intoxicated...

1226
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:02,304
and his impaired state is recognized.

1227
01:51:05,807 --> 01:51:07,514
Under the Act on Special Cases

1228
01:51:08,476 --> 01:51:13,255
concerning sexual assault, Article 9...

1229
01:51:14,682 --> 01:51:15,820
Article 7...

1230
01:51:17,418 --> 01:51:19,056
and Article 14...

1231
01:51:21,022 --> 01:51:22,763
He is sentenced to 12 years.

1232
01:51:22,824 --> 01:51:24,303
Just 12 years!

1233
01:51:28,162 --> 01:51:30,142
Information on the defendant

1234
01:51:31,099 --> 01:51:34,205
will be made public for 5 years.

1235
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:40,250
And the request for the victim's
compensation is overruled.

1236
01:51:44,512 --> 01:51:45,582
Wait!

1237
01:51:48,015 --> 01:51:49,688
Why go easy on him
because he's drunk?

1238
01:51:50,885 --> 01:51:52,592
Then, drunk driving
shouldn't be charged!

1239
01:51:53,254 --> 01:51:54,733
Drunk driving is wrong...

1240
01:51:54,889 --> 01:51:57,961
But you go easy on
almost killing a kid!

1241
01:52:01,429 --> 01:52:03,534
You call this a trial!

1242
01:52:04,766 --> 01:52:07,007
A child almost died.

1243
01:52:08,402 --> 01:52:09,904
And she's our child.

1244
01:52:11,606 --> 01:52:14,610
I'm here and her dad's here.

1245
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:17,685
And the one responsible is here.

1246
01:52:17,945 --> 01:52:20,118
There's evidence, too!

1247
01:52:21,983 --> 01:52:23,758
But just 12 years?

1248
01:52:24,318 --> 01:52:25,319
Order!

1249
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,228
Know how old she'll be
in just 12 years!

1250
01:52:28,756 --> 01:52:32,829
Not even 20 years-old!

1251
01:52:52,213 --> 01:52:53,283
Daddy!

1252
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:02,999
Daddy, let's go home.

1253
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:22,687
Let's go home, please?

1254
01:53:43,631 --> 01:53:44,609
Let's go home.

1255
01:53:45,733 --> 01:53:46,803
Let's go home...

1256
01:53:48,135 --> 01:53:49,239
Let's go home...

1257
01:53:51,172 --> 01:53:52,150
Get up.

1258
01:55:49,824 --> 01:55:50,894
Here he comes.

1259
01:55:52,259 --> 01:55:53,237
Oh my!

1260
01:55:53,427 --> 01:55:56,636
What a big boy!

1261
01:55:57,198 --> 01:55:58,541
- Dad?
- Hmm?

1262
01:55:59,066 --> 01:56:00,670
His face is big, too.

1263
01:56:00,835 --> 01:56:03,645
Men should have big heads!

1264
01:56:06,307 --> 01:56:08,787
But not as big as yours.

1265
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:13,283
Looks like
it's going to be big.

1266
01:56:14,248 --> 01:56:15,591
Who named him?

1267
01:56:16,250 --> 01:56:20,096
I named Hope.
Mi-hee named him.

1268
01:56:20,855 --> 01:56:22,562
What is it?

1269
01:56:22,957 --> 01:56:23,935
Happy-

1270
01:56:25,893 --> 01:56:26,928
IM Happy?

1271
01:56:27,461 --> 01:56:29,441
Yup. IM Happy.

1272
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:31,671
Happy? Look here!

1273
01:56:31,932 --> 01:56:34,208
He's looking at us.

1274
01:56:34,335 --> 01:56:36,372
- Isn't he smart?
- Why you.

1275
01:56:45,479 --> 01:56:47,220
<i>The Loneliest person
is the kindest</i>

1276
01:56:47,448 --> 01:56:49,086
<i>The Saddest person
smiles the Brightest</i>

1277
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:50,854
<i>because They don't want others
to feel the same pain</i>

1278
01:56:50,985 --> 01:56:52,521
<i>- Anonymous -</i>

1279
01:56:53,621 --> 01:56:56,830
I felt like I needed to go home

1280
01:56:57,858 --> 01:57:01,704
and left after second period.

1281
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:07,275
My friends may think
it was weird.

1282
01:57:08,803 --> 01:57:11,613
What should I say on Monday?

1283
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:16,051
I'm worried about that.

1284
01:57:17,411 --> 01:57:20,881
I wish I wasn't sick.

1285
01:57:23,084 --> 01:57:26,156
Throw it to third!

1286
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:27,663
Get him!

1287
01:57:27,721 --> 01:57:31,168
You worked all night?
Aren't you sleeping?

1288
01:57:32,126 --> 01:57:33,696
I'll watch this, then sleep.

1289
01:57:35,162 --> 01:57:38,575
Yelling at a re-run!

1290
01:57:39,133 --> 01:57:40,840
They're making me tired.

1291
01:57:49,176 --> 01:57:52,123
I made an airplane today.

1292
01:57:52,813 --> 01:57:57,558
I made it for my brother.
It looks great.

1293
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:04,965
I'm good at making
and fixing things like Daddy.

1294
01:58:07,895 --> 01:58:11,069
If that fool didn't make
an error, it'd be over!

1295
01:58:12,266 --> 01:58:15,213
Go Lotte!

1296
01:58:16,971 --> 01:58:19,508
Give up on Lotte.

1297
01:58:20,274 --> 01:58:22,220
What! They're winning!

1298
01:58:23,110 --> 01:58:26,091
But they lost 7 to 8.

1299
01:58:26,947 --> 01:58:29,450
Don't tell me that!

1300
01:58:30,384 --> 01:58:32,625
Do you have to tell me now!

1301
01:58:34,321 --> 01:58:35,766
Man! I can't sleep now!

1302
01:58:57,545 --> 01:59:00,719
You being born is a blessing.

1303
01:59:14,028 --> 01:59:17,532
<i>It's all right</i>

1304
01:59:19,567 --> 01:59:23,071
<i>You can stand again.</i>

1305
01:59:24,972 --> 01:59:28,545
<i>More than the past</i>

1306
01:59:30,344 --> 01:59:34,793
<i>The future is more important</i>

1307
01:59:35,816 --> 01:59:39,491
<i>I swallowed my tears</i>

1308
01:59:41,288 --> 01:59:44,758
<i>Because I'm not alone</i>

1309
01:59:46,860 --> 01:59:50,273
<i>I know that well</i>

1310
01:59:52,233 --> 01:59:55,339
<i>I'm so thankful</i>

1311
01:59:57,538 --> 02:00:02,920
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

1312
02:00:03,043 --> 02:00:07,890
<i>Never be sad again</i>

1313
02:00:08,515 --> 02:00:16,696
<i>Trust in love that abounds</i>

1314
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:24,842
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

1315
02:00:24,898 --> 02:00:30,371
<i>Never be in pain again</i>

1316
02:00:30,471 --> 02:00:38,151
<i>Now, be happy again</i>

1317
02:00:53,394 --> 02:00:55,874
I'm scared

1318
02:00:56,030 --> 02:00:58,670
<i>I'm afraid</i>

1319
02:00:58,766 --> 02:01:05,615
<i>But I'll live on</i>

1320
02:01:08,475 --> 02:01:13,948
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

1321
02:01:14,114 --> 02:01:18,494
<i>Never be sad again</i>

1322
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:27,237
<i>Trust in love that abounds</i>

02:01:30,364 --> 02:01:35,712
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

02:01:35,836 --> 02:01:41,184
<i>Never be in pain again</i>

1325
02:01:41,375 --> 02:01:46,375
<i>Now, be happy again</i>

02:01:52,152 --> 02:01:57,534
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

1327
02:01:57,725 --> 02:02:02,196
<i>Never be sad again</i>

02:02:03,097 --> 02:02:12,415
<i>Trust in love that abounds</i>

02:02:14,041 --> 02:02:19,354
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

1330
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:24,461
<i>Never be in pain again</i>

1331
02:02:24,985 --> 02:02:32,460
<i>Now, be happy again</i>

1332
02:02:35,629 --> 02:02:38,132
<i>Happy</i>
