1
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:29,545
Enemy neutralized, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:31,339
Objective completed.

3
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:35,760
- Very nice.
- Yes, very nice.

4
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:45,144
Introducing your host, Dr Howard Marner.

5
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:47,229
President of Nova Robotics

6
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:10,868
Well, ladies and gentlemen

7
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,715
I want you to meet strategic artificially
intelligent nuclear transport

8
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,177
Or SAINT, as we call it.

9
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,011
If a question of survival,
then SAINT is the answer

10
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,149
It is quite simply, the most
sophisticated robot on planet Earth.

11
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:40,241
Adaptable to steaming jungle and burning
deserts and frozen arctic wastes

12
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:42,785
Well, of course it's adaptable
because it's a robot.

13
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,946
Therefore, impervious to...

14
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:50,251
- the ravages of nature.
- Crush ice.

15
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:58,467
Glass. Ice.

16
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,011
Gin.

17
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:02,597
Tonic.

18
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,892
A squeeze of lime.

19
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:14,025
- Your cocktail, Dr. Marner.
- Thank you, Number 2.

20
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:20,447
Just the way I like it...

21
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:22,533
shaken, but not stirred.

22
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:27,496
Oh my...

23
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:28,497
Well...

24
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,960
One thing we can't control is the weather. The
man upstairs is still in charge of that department.

25
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:38,132
So, why don't we just move our
little presentation back into the lab?

26
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:06,160
- Oh, and one more thing Dr. Marner.
- Yes, Senator Mills.

27
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:09,288
Where's the young man
that actually designed these things?

28
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,738
- Dr. Crosby?
- Yes.

29
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,458
We were told we would be meeting with him.

30
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,735
And so you shall.

31
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:14,909
- When?
- Soon.

32
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:16,921
Maybe not today, but soon.

33
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:18,881
- Why not today?
- Flu.

34
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:23,344
I'd feel happier about approving this
project if I could speak with him.

35
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:25,836
I'll see what I can do.

36
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:28,849
Would you excuse me for just...
I'll be back in just a second.

37
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:33,729
Norman, bolt up the motion control system please.
Don't forget that. It's very important.

38
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:35,507
Where is he?

39
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,233
I need him.

40
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:38,015
Stat!

41
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:39,068
Excuse me sir.

42
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,530
Crosby... he is hiding in the toilet, sir.

43
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:44,688
Public relations is everybody's job.

44
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,014
Well he is sitting at the cross
they are making him dog sick, sir.

45
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:51,289
Look. He's supposed to be here.
I want him here. I pay him to be here.

46
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:54,417
Well, the last time I am seeing him,
he is busy vomiting, sir.

47
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,378
Well, clean him up and
send him out to hob nob.

48
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,754
Stat!

49
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:11,809
Newton, come on, hurry up.
They are waiting for you.

50
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:18,149
Newton Crosby. You must make
instantaneous appearance.

51
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,431
Marner says "Stat".

52
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:22,612
You have to go
hob nob with the big wigs.

53
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,949
Is that a yes or the number
of your intelligence quotient?

54
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:28,357
Ben, I don't hob nob.

55
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,037
If you you like all that P.R. crap,
why don't you go hob nob.

56
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,279
Mingle with the brass. Have a ball.

57
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:36,667
I am sick of wearing
the dress in this family.

58
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:43,466
Crosby, now don't you hang up on me. I know
you're there. I want you up here right away!

59
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:46,125
Come on Newton! Swallow
your guts. You can do it.

60
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:49,013
Show them that you're a hot shot
fun guy underneath your clothes.

61
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:50,337
Now, what do they need me for?

62
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:53,559
To tell them each robot costs
10 million dollars and it kills people?

63
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:55,186
Ben, a child of four can tell them that.

64
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:56,594
That is why they are needing you.

65
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:58,971
- Now come on. Hurry up!
- Just one dance.

66
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:01,108
Now, I have to go to the jack.
So you wait for me.

67
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,109
The "john."

68
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:05,144
Oh, ya, you're doing real good.

69
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:08,824
- Just keep working on those last two bars.
- Let us go!

70
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:13,788
Coming through, please.

71
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:18,751
Wine coolers. Perier, Long Island ice tea.

72
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:20,127
Please take a drink.

73
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:22,244
...he's putting on a tie.

74
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,590
He's going to tell you about
these peace time uses.

75
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:26,743
It's got plenty of peace time uses.

76
00:09:26,795 --> 00:09:28,844
You mean besides serving gin and tonic?

77
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,140
The only way to secure the peace,
Senator, and I'm sure you know...

78
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:35,007
is be prepared. See...

79
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:38,688
We can parachute these robot guys
behind enemy lines.

80
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,263
They hide out till
the first strike blows over.

81
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:44,443
Then, each one of these little boogers
carries a 25 megaton bomb

82
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:49,198
right up the middle main street of Moscow.
Like the mail man bringing bad news.

83
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,900
We call it "Operation Gotcha Last".

84
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:56,080
- That's what you call insuring peace.
- Oh, ya...

85
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:56,956
just...

86
00:09:56,998 --> 00:10:00,710
We're all thinking the same way. Would you
like to see our control center, Senator?

87
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:10,428
Hey, Norman. You better get
number 5 off that generator, man.

88
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,556
OK, OK, I'll get to it.

89
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:24,025
Run, Jim!

90
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:35,286
Jesus H God!

91
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,371
What the hell happened?

92
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:39,373
I don't know.

93
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,335
Oh my God! It's fried.

94
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:48,716
Oh! We're in deep shit now, man.

95
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:51,208
I hope got a few million bucks.

96
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,388
Because that's what they're going
to charge us if this think is fried.

97
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,724
- Everything checks out.
- What?

98
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:00,394
It's amazing.
Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.

99
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:05,775
OK, robots. Verbal command. Access
code 29 report to disarming section.

100
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:09,487
Get out of here, you little crap bucket!

101
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:10,613
Go on!

102
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,140
It's the ultimate soldier.

103
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:40,716
Obeys orders, never asks questions.

104
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:43,354
Originally, I had non-military
purposes in mind.

105
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:45,815
I designed it as a marital aid.

106
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:49,569
Very funny.

107
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:51,435
No...

108
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:54,657
I'm sure we'll all agree that
Dr. Crosby has designed a weapon...

109
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,394
that will keep our world safe
for all time.

110
00:11:57,446 --> 00:12:00,079
Howard, what's so safe
about blowing people up?

111
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:13,634
Coffee service coming through.
Please watch your step.

112
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:16,137
Hot coffee.

113
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:23,686
Coffee service coming through.
Please watch your step.

114
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:06,604
Please serve yourselves.
Have a canopy. Shrimp toast. Caviar.

115
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,182
Pate, salmon moose, Cheese Whiz...

116
00:13:11,234 --> 00:13:14,487
Ladies and gentlemen,
our prototypes are here.

117
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:29,126
I've only counted 4,
so tell me I've miscounted.

118
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:30,743
- Gag me with a fork, sir.
- What?

119
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:33,464
Number 5 left the debriefing station
and then it just disappeared.

120
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:35,206
Oh, God, not today!

121
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:37,593
- Alright, call security.
- I did, sir, stat.

122
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:40,179
Good, you did, great.
Just stay calm!

123
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:57,321
- How're you doing?
- Running late as usual.

124
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:10,501
I knew it. God damned garbage cans!

125
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:13,911
Garbage cans with guns.
Newfangled bullshit!

126
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:16,789
- Have you got anything stronger?
- I got trouble which I don't need.

127
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:20,469
Because my wife is home cooking a steak
which is going to be dried out when I get there.

128
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:24,015
I think we got it.
What is that right there?

129
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:28,644
- Coffee machine.
- You're right, that's what it is.

130
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:31,220
- It's a coffee machine.
- That's very good, Howard.

131
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:34,984
Now it is time to freeze this place,
seal the doors, slam the gates shut.

132
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:40,448
All right, good enough.

133
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:43,409
OK, here you go.

134
00:14:46,662 --> 00:14:48,122
Main gate. Captain.

135
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:00,624
- Where did you disappear to?
- I was hob nobbing.

136
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:04,305
OK, OK come on over here quick.
Come on. Come on, quick.

137
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:07,016
The guys downstairs say that number
5 was hit by a huge power surge.

138
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:08,643
He should have shut down.
Did you try the return code?

139
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:10,061
Ya, no response.

140
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,033
This is very strange, he won't talk to me.

141
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:37,546
- You sure number 5 is operational?
- Ya, as far as I know.

142
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:39,632
- Check the list polling system.
- OK.

143
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:41,248
Let's try the emergency override.

144
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,010
This is bullshit. Just let me go get it.

145
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:46,170
Access code, 42721.

146
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:48,881
Access gained, number 5 standing by.

147
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:51,018
With that ease,
you've gotten him on your terminal.

148
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,019
You're just a fine kid.

149
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,480
Report your position.

150
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:09,985
Malfunction, need input.

151
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,529
What the hell's a need input for?

152
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:13,624
I don't know,
I guess it can't triangulate his position.

153
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:14,740
That's a simple function.

154
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:17,795
Do you know how to triangulate
your position, Howard?

155
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:19,578
- No.
- Well, then, there you go.

156
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,590
I'm glad you think
this is all such a joke, Crosby.

157
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:23,551
Don't worry, Skroeder,
you're not going to miss a meal.

158
00:16:23,603 --> 00:16:25,970
Just shut it down, pick it up.

159
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:31,966
Unable, malfunction.

160
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:34,228
How can it refuse to turn itself off?

161
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,427
Maybe it's pissed off.

162
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,388
It's a machine, Skroeder,
it doesn't get pissed off...

163
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,443
it doesn't get happy, it doesn't get sad,
it doesn't laugh at your jokes.

164
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:43,529
- It just runs programming.
- Usually runs programs.

165
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:47,565
Anybody try the homing device yet?

166
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:49,827
- No.
- Oh, come on you guys, use your heads!

167
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:52,955
It's probably right down the hall and...

168
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:55,583
Ah... Here it comes...
Here it comes...

169
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,752
And...

170
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,630
Bingo!

171
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:04,832
Good lord!
It is outside the fence!

172
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:07,219
Oh, and that is not
the worst of it, Dr. Marner.

173
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:09,889
Don't tell me its laser is still armed.

174
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,422
Bimbo!

175
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:12,850
Crosby, what's he going to do?

176
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:14,383
Howard, it's hard to say.

177
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:16,343
It's malfunctioning.
It might not do anything.

178
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:19,982
But it could decide to blow away
anything that moves. Couldn't it?

179
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:22,235
Couldn't it, Crosby?

180
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:44,674
Oh, my God. It's not coming back.
We've got to destroy it.

181
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:46,722
No. Howard, you're
overreacting. You can't...

182
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,719
Look, let us at least try to catch it first.

183
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,169
Ya, we'll panic later, OK?

184
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:53,182
What if you don't catch it. What if it goes
out and melts down a bus load of nuns...

185
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,560
How would you like to
write the headline on that one?

186
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:57,520
- Nun soup?
- Ben!

187
00:17:58,854 --> 00:17:59,887
- Howard.
- What?

188
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:02,817
OK, it's malfunctioning. Think about it.

189
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:05,643
- What about function?
- Alright, look...

190
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,405
Why don't you get your
team together and Skroeder,

191
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:08,196
Duke, Otis!

192
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,324
- And detain number 5 the best you can...
- Alright, Howard.

193
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:12,493
- and still avoid an incident.
- I'm already moving.

194
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:13,494
And Skroeder,

195
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:15,288
You understand
you don't have to blow it up.

196
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,239
You don't have to blow it up, Skroeder.

197
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,200
Just try and bring it back in one piece.
- One piece will do.

198
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:25,548
Whatever it takes to put that stupid
contraption out of commission, gentlemen,

199
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,676
- that's what you do.
- Yes sir.

200
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,343
Give inertial status...

201
00:18:39,395 --> 00:18:43,649
Let's scramble one, maybe it'll listen
to what comes with a decoder.

202
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:44,515
What is this?

203
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,433
Running diagnostics.
Testing its logic circuits.

204
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:49,780
Let's just bounce on off its magnesium
casing. What do you think, I don't know.

205
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:52,241
What is this? Input, Input, Input...

206
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:53,482
Come on...

207
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,244
Let's boot it up.
See if you can boot it.

208
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:59,128
Return to D-Station...
Come on. Now!

209
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,960
Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?

210
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,838
Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?

211
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,839
What is going on?

212
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:08,706
I don't know,
must be the print scanner...

213
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:12,470
- it must be reading it some place.
- I'm not understanding the reference

214
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,895
Need input.

215
00:19:22,605 --> 00:19:23,856
Input.

216
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:55,429
- Did you see something?
- Oh God... I hope not.

217
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:58,349
- Well, I saw something.
- Ya, me too.

218
00:19:58,401 --> 00:19:59,976
Oh shit!

219
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:05,961
It's right outside.
- Captain Skroeder, Captain Skroeder

220
00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:08,693
<i>This is Bravo 4, over.
Skroeder, what have you got, over.</i>

221
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:12,780
He's right in front of us, sir, we're
on the bridge out on 101, over.

222
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:16,450
We're on our way.
Loose it and you're dead meat.

223
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:49,859
- It's going berserk.
- Ben, how'd this happen?

224
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:52,403
Who is knowing how to read
the mind of a robot?

225
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:57,366
Weeeeee!

226
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:30,639
I am not cut out for this!
You did this, Crosby...

227
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:32,568
- Howard!
- so you wouldn't have to talk to those people.

228
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,642
Just calm down.

229
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:36,239
Excuse me, sir, but we're loosing
its signal. It's going out of range.

230
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,808
We're going to have to follow it now.

231
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,273
Can I get a vehicle? Can I get...

232
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:42,662
- Howard, is there a van or anything like that?
- Of course there's a van!

233
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:55,591
Thanks for calling me, Mrs. Cepeda,
where's that son of a bitch?

234
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:58,886
He's around the bend and up
to no good, you better believe it.

235
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:03,724
Get the hell down here, Beasley!

236
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,509
- Hey!
- What are you doing home?

237
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:08,771
This is my home! It's not
your home. I live here.

238
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:10,423
What are you doing with Beasley?

239
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:11,972
Uh... well, darn it, you know

240
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:13,599
he looked kind of sick to me so I thought...

241
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:15,861
I'd just take him down to the vet
and fix him up a bit.

242
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:17,639
He doesn't look sick, you look sick.

243
00:22:17,691 --> 00:22:19,313
What did you come back
here for anyway?

244
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:23,077
Well, to tell you the truth, I thought that
maybe we could patch things up.

245
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:25,788
Sort of pick up where we left off.

246
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:28,958
You know you want me back.

247
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,242
What is this?

248
00:22:31,294 --> 00:22:33,504
Quinn's Medical Research? You slime bag!

249
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:35,079
The dog is on its last legs.

250
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:37,320
That's very funny. Why don't
you get the hell out of here!

251
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:39,510
You know what I figure?
I figure you owe me some money.

252
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:41,304
- So I'm just here to collect.
- I owe you?

253
00:22:41,356 --> 00:22:43,254
- That's right.
- I supported you.

254
00:22:43,306 --> 00:22:46,934
That was my money you used
to buy your big red dorkmobile!

255
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:48,394
No! Damn it!

256
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:50,938
Hey! Hey!

257
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:56,569
- Do not do that car!
- Get away from me!

258
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:02,450
Alright. If this is your idea of playing
hard to get, you can knock it off now.

259
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:04,024
You mutation!

260
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:07,204
- God damn it! Don't ever call me that!
- You don't even know what it means!

261
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:09,165
Ya, well, I can find out!

262
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:13,210
Hey! You! You leave her alone!

263
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:19,946
- Oh, God!
- Oh honey!

264
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,876
- Are you OK, honey?
- Ya.

265
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:23,961
- Are you sure?
- Ya, I'm fine.

266
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:25,598
And I thought he
was going to be a nice one.

267
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,131
- Different from the other ones.
- Ya right!

268
00:23:27,183 --> 00:23:30,937
- Well, he sure was better looking.
- Well, looks aren't everything.

269
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:34,607
I know that.
Every time I look at Mr. Cepeda.

270
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:37,266
Honey, listen,
I hate to tell you this but a...

271
00:23:37,318 --> 00:23:40,196
the man from the city...
he was snooping around again.

272
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:41,896
I told them all this was temporary.

273
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:43,981
It's just until I can find homes for them.

274
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:46,369
Well, he says that four years
is not too temporary.

275
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:47,578
He was going to call the sheriff on you.

276
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,694
Oh, great!

277
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:51,561
Maybe the sheriff would like a pet?

278
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:54,579
Beasley. Beasley come to me, baby.

279
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:57,494
Good Beasley!
Beasley, come here.

280
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,840
Did he scare you?
Did he scare you, honey?

281
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:00,831
I'm sorry.

282
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:04,303
I feel like I've been cooped up
inside this lab forever.

283
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:07,014
Well, it's an opportunity
to spread your legs.

284
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:08,521
Good to smell the breezes, hum?

285
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:09,924
Has it changed much out there?

286
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:11,852
Oh, yes, you can say that two times.

287
00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:13,260
Hey! Hey! Come on you guys!

288
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,856
Come on, get points!
Skroeder's coming up empty!

289
00:24:15,908 --> 00:24:18,349
We're on our way, Howard,
to the great outdoors.

290
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:21,404
Newton, you know what is out there
in the great outdoors?

291
00:24:21,456 --> 00:24:23,312
Girls. Ummm.

292
00:24:23,364 --> 00:24:25,898
With brassieres and legs.

293
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,618
You have the working knowledge the girl?

294
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,068
No, but I read about them.

295
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,539
Well then... maybe I can furnish you
with some schematic drawings.

296
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:32,738
All right.

297
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,491
Hey! Who told you could
take Number One?

298
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:37,878
Howard, logically, if we need
protection from Number Five...

299
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,286
this is the best weapon
we could have.

300
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:41,799
Great, great!
So, instead of $11 million on the loose...

301
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:43,806
we're going to have
twenty-two.

302
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,761
And plus, we are needing
gas money.

303
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,309
I'm sorry.
I just...

304
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:53,436
I have to draw the line
at snakes.

305
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:57,773
Ya, I'm sure it would make
a wonderful pet, but...

306
00:24:58,024 --> 00:25:02,069
wait, isn't there a home
for cobras somewhere?

307
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:04,697
Can you hang on
for a second?

308
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:15,791
Can I call you right back?
Thanks.

309
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:22,048
Hey! Get out of there!

310
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:27,136
Frank?

311
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,805
Mr. Scumo!

312
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:36,103
I know you're in there.

313
00:25:38,147 --> 00:25:41,108
Get out! Get out!
I'll call the cops.

314
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:54,830
What?
Are you deaf?

315
00:26:02,713 --> 00:26:04,674
Oh, my God!

316
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:14,016
Oh, my God! I knew they'd
pick me. I just knew it.

317
00:26:18,187 --> 00:26:19,397
Hello.

318
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:22,858
Well, I guess...

319
00:26:24,235 --> 00:26:26,946
welcome to my planet.

320
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:32,577
Oh boy! Is this thrilling or what?

321
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:37,582
Don't be scared.

322
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,500
I'm a friend.

323
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,919
Friend?

324
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:48,009
Do you know
the word "friend"?

325
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:51,679
Because that's what I am.
I'm a friend.

326
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:54,056
So, here I come.

327
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:58,019
Nice and extremely friendly.

328
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:15,912
Hi.
It's me.

329
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:22,001
So, this is earth.

330
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:24,879
I'm Stephanie.
Speck.

331
00:27:25,796 --> 00:27:27,548
No offense, but...

332
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,135
is that really you or is that
like a space suit...

333
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:33,262
and you're inside some place,
maybe just your brain...

334
00:27:33,554 --> 00:27:35,640
in a little jar
or something like that?

335
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,851
- Malfunction.
- You can talk!

336
00:27:39,185 --> 00:27:41,938
Malfunction.
Need input.

337
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:43,940
Input.

338
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:46,108
That's information.

339
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:48,819
Listen, I am full of it.

340
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:52,698
Why don't you come to my house
and we can sit down and talk...

341
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:56,118
get to know each other.
Communicate. Input.

342
00:27:57,328 --> 00:28:00,373
Come on.
It's okay.

343
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:07,421
No, no.
I mean come with me.

344
00:28:09,674 --> 00:28:13,511
Come here. This way.

345
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:25,346
Come here.

346
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:28,463
Come on. Right this way.

347
00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:31,529
March! Heel! Giddy up!

348
00:28:32,196 --> 00:28:33,990
- Forward!
- Forward!

349
00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:36,701
Forward, forward.
Come forward.

350
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:39,370
That's good.
That's really good.

351
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,831
Don't be afraid, guys.
He's a friend.

352
00:28:42,164 --> 00:28:44,198
These are animals.
They're lower life forms.

353
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,503
They're always a little skittish
around new people, aliens. Whatever.

354
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:50,214
Malfunction. Need input.

355
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:52,748
Input.
All right, right. You got it, OK.

356
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,012
This is a house.
We live within it, inside it.

357
00:28:56,345 --> 00:28:59,015
- We have a floor, see...
- Floor.

358
00:28:59,515 --> 00:29:01,434
And we have the opposite
of a floor...

359
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:03,269
which is the ceiling.
Look up!

360
00:29:03,686 --> 00:29:05,094
Ceiling.

361
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:06,814
We have windows and...

362
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:09,859
air! Look over here.

363
00:29:11,444 --> 00:29:12,737
Light.

364
00:29:14,906 --> 00:29:16,240
Music.

365
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:19,952
And... look at this.

366
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:22,538
This is a plant.
See?

367
00:29:22,788 --> 00:29:24,665
And these are goldfish.

368
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:26,991
Don't touch.

369
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:29,232
And look over there.

370
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:31,370
See, these are ants.

371
00:29:31,422 --> 00:29:33,841
They're not aunts,
they're ants.

372
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:36,260
It's an ant farm.

373
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:41,265
Look! These are my bunnies.
Edwina and Norman.

374
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:43,517
Norman.

375
00:29:43,768 --> 00:29:45,686
I bet you got some amazing
animals in your planet.

376
00:29:47,271 --> 00:29:49,023
Good, there you go.

377
00:29:49,315 --> 00:29:51,108
This is Earth, where
we are now.

378
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:54,904
You are here.
Here.

379
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,240

380
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,325
Home of the beaver,
famous for cherries.

381
00:29:59,617 --> 00:30:01,786
Beavers.
Cherries. Input.

382
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:03,829
I'm giving you
great input.

383
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:06,165
More input.
More input.

384
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:09,085
How about pictures?
Do you like pictures?

385
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:11,128
We have a lot
of pictures here.

386
00:30:11,671 --> 00:30:13,297
A lot of them.

387
00:30:14,298 --> 00:30:17,927
This is a picture
of an aardvark.

388
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,888
See that? It's an aardvark.

389
00:30:21,222 --> 00:30:24,350
- It's a mammal.
- Input. Aardvark.

390
00:30:24,642 --> 00:30:28,104

00:30:32,692 --> 00:30:34,235
Input.

392
00:30:34,527 --> 00:30:36,279
- More input.
- Okay, no problem.

393
00:30:37,863 --> 00:30:39,448
Volume two.
No problem.

394
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:50,459
- My neck.
- Sorry.

395
00:30:50,793 --> 00:30:52,368
This is very healthful
for the neck.

396
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,006
Can you believe it's been
5 years since I've driven?

397
00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:56,330
I'd say ten.

398
00:30:56,382 --> 00:30:58,415
It's all coming
back to me, though.

399
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:00,469
You know what many people
are liking at night?

400
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,597
- What?
- Headlights.

401
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:07,143
- It's a lot better. Thanks.
- Definitely, ya

402
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,947
More input, Stephanie.

403
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:21,908
- More!
- There isn't anymore.

404
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:24,035
You've read everything
in the house.

405
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,748
Animal.
Mammal, skunk.

406
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:32,543
That's a container
drinking glass.

407
00:31:33,002 --> 00:31:35,650
Pasta, semolina,
spaghetti.

408
00:31:35,702 --> 00:31:38,247
Food, liquid,
spaghetti sauce.

409
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,927
Look, this may be hilarious
where you come from...

410
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,845
but on this planet it's considered rude.

411
00:31:43,512 --> 00:31:47,016
Plants, fruits, oranges...

412
00:31:47,308 --> 00:31:49,602
apples, lemons, limes.

413
00:31:49,936 --> 00:31:51,771
That's great.
Thanks a lot.

414
00:31:52,104 --> 00:31:53,564
Fabric.
Tablecloth.

415
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,400
No, my dishes!

416
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:58,402
Oh, my God!

417
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:00,738
Breakfast table.
American contemporary.

418
00:32:01,072 --> 00:32:03,658
Oh! My China!

419
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:06,160
- Numerous fragments.
- Ok, fine...

420
00:32:06,212 --> 00:32:07,828
Some large, some small.

421
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:10,498
Take a look at this.
Look at that.

422
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:12,375
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

423
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,752

Right.
Input, input.

425
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:17,922
Good.

426
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:22,134
Ok, here. You hold this.
That's very good.

427
00:32:22,186 --> 00:32:24,053

Stay.

428

00:32:39,443 --> 00:32:40,976
I know no one's gonna
believe me...

432
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:42,947
and I'd like them to know
I'm not crazy, so look up!

433
00:32:59,672 --> 00:33:01,549
Input.

434
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:05,417
This is a barrel of monkeys.

00:33:05,469 --> 00:33:07,680
Let us scrape up
some female chicks.

436
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:08,963
Don't we have to find
a robot?

437
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:13,519
Pardon me for saying so,
but you're becoming a drag strip.

438
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:16,355
Girls are not my best suits.
Besides, we got a job to do.

439
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:18,482
As we're fond of saying
in my country...

440
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:21,068
"marketplace make dull
home for rodents."

441
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,572
- Where are you from, anyway?
- Bakersfield, originally.

442
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:26,449

449
00:33:48,846 --> 00:33:50,514
<i>No, I didn't do it.
You got me wrong.</i>

450
00:33:51,015 --> 00:33:52,882

You lose IQ points the longer you
watch. There've been actual studies.

00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:16,304
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

512
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:18,472
<i>I'd like you to know
I have one of your robots.</i>

513
00:37:19,348 --> 00:37:21,100
God!

514
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,978
Good.
Yes.

515
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:26,772
Listen...

516
00:37:28,024 --> 00:37:29,942
thank you very much
for calling.

517
00:37:30,276 --> 00:37:32,486
Our people are
on their way.

518
00:37:34,614 --> 00:37:36,699
Mount up!
We've got it!

519
00:37:37,116 --> 00:37:38,326
Move! Move! Move!

520
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:41,495
Today, gentleman, today!
Let's go!

521
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:50,212
We gotta run away!
Let's go, let's go.

522
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:53,090
In the meantime,
it's very important...

523
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:55,176
that you try to keep
a safe distance.

524
00:37:55,468 --> 00:37:57,345
How safe a distance?

525
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,473
Well, see, it's malfunctioning.

526
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:04,685
We have to disassemble
it and check it out.

527
00:38:04,936 --> 00:38:06,229
It's goofy little gadget.

528
00:38:06,562 --> 00:38:09,482
Try to keep everyone as far away
from it as possible, okay?

529
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:12,360
Not that it's dangerous
or anything like that.

530
00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:15,154
How much is a contraption
like that worth, anyway?

531
00:38:15,404 --> 00:38:17,740
<i>Worth? I don' know.
A few hundred dollars maybe.</i>

532
00:38:18,032 --> 00:38:20,284
No reward or anything
like that for finding it, is there?

533
00:38:20,618 --> 00:38:24,622
Well, we do have a daily tour
of our facilities here.

534
00:38:24,997 --> 00:38:28,042
<i>You know, I might even be able
to get you a student discount.</i>

535
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:30,461
- Hey! It's gone!
- Gone?

536
00:38:30,753 --> 00:38:32,088
Wooly mammals.

537
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,048
Sheep.
Sweaters, mittens.

538
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,468
Never mind, I see it. Go back
to your nuclear warheads.

539
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:45,184
Hey, you, Number Five,
What are you doing?

540
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:47,468
You're gonna scare
my animals, bozo.

541
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,939
Listen, I just called Nova and
they are coming out to get you.

542
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:53,224
- They'll give you a tune up.
- Tune-up? Input.

543
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:55,820
They'll take you apart,
find out which screw is loose.

544
00:38:55,872 --> 00:38:59,782
Apart: Undone, dismantle,
dissect, disassemble.

545
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:01,242
Right.

546
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:03,077
Jump!

547
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:09,041
- Look, it's a grasshopper.
- Grasshopper, Orthoptarous insect.

548
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:11,586
Jump.

549
00:39:11,877 --> 00:39:13,421
That's great.
Okay.

550
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,760
All right, let's go back now.
Come on.

551
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:21,762
Hey!

552
00:39:24,473 --> 00:39:26,726
Damn it! You klutz!
Look what you did.

553
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,436
Error.

554
00:39:28,728 --> 00:39:30,521
Grasshopper disassembled.

555
00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:32,690
Reassemble.

556
00:39:33,149 --> 00:39:34,932
Reassemble.

557
00:39:34,984 --> 00:39:38,738
I can't reassemble him.
You squashed him, he's dead.

558
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,854
Dead?

559
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:43,232
Right.
Dead as a doornail.

560
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:46,537
Reassemble, Stephanie.
Reassemble.

561
00:39:48,372 --> 00:39:51,156
I know you don't understand.

562
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:54,243
But when you're dead,
you're dead.

563
00:39:54,295 --> 00:39:58,424
That's just the way it is.
Dead is forever.

564
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:03,679
Squash, dead.

565
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,642
Disassemble, dead!

566
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:11,479
Disassemble, dead!

567
00:40:11,854 --> 00:40:13,356
Slow down.

568
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:17,360
- No disassemble.
- Where are you going?

569
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:21,739
- Please, escape.
- Oh, my God!

570
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:24,033
Hey, you!
Get out of my truck.

571
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:27,912
Hey! Hey! Let me in.
Let me in.

572
00:40:27,964 --> 00:40:30,154
No! Don't.

573
00:40:30,206 --> 00:40:32,375
You open this door
right now.

574
00:40:34,377 --> 00:40:36,212
Get out of my truck,
you thief.

575
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:44,720
No, don't start my truck.
You don't know how to drive.

576
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,233
Come back here with my truck,
you big hunk of tin.

577
00:40:57,285 --> 00:40:59,318
You can't take my truck.

578
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:18,129
You better be heavily insured
because you'll find yourself...

579
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:20,881
slapped with
a humongous lawsuit!

580
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:42,904
Newton, I'm seeing a blip
on my scope. Drive slowly.

581
00:41:45,781 --> 00:41:47,241
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry.

582
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,453
Newton, there it goes.
It's moving at extreme velocipede.

583
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:01,662
Right of the line.
The right.

584
00:42:01,714 --> 00:42:04,008
Accurate, proper,
correct, appropriate.

585
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:05,801
My side, over here.
Quickly!

586
00:42:06,052 --> 00:42:06,886
- The right.
- Right.

587
00:42:07,178 --> 00:42:08,304
The right.

588
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:14,936
Look out! Look out!

589
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:19,440
My kitchen!

590
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:24,028
No!

591
00:42:25,947 --> 00:42:28,616
Where she going? I thought
Howard told her to stay put.

592
00:42:28,866 --> 00:42:31,244
Go figure out chicks, man.

593
00:42:32,536 --> 00:42:33,913
Look out!

594
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,418
Oh great! Nice work,
can head.

595
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,087
- Thanks at lot.
- Sorry.

596
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,842
Oh, no. Stop it now!
Stop!

597
00:42:47,885 --> 00:42:49,220
- Turn left or we're going to crash!
- Left!

598
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:53,140
Turn! Turn!

599
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:55,142
- Fish!
- Look out!

600
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:57,019
Salmon!
Sushi.

601
00:42:57,645 --> 00:42:59,689
Jeez, Number Five,
we're going to be killed.

602
00:43:00,356 --> 00:43:02,900
- Disassemble.
- Disassemble all over the place.

603
00:43:03,693 --> 00:43:05,695
Disassemble.
No!

604
00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:14,495
Escape! Escape!

605
00:43:14,787 --> 00:43:17,164
Flee! Hide! Refuge!

606
00:43:17,623 --> 00:43:19,584
What are you afraid of?
What's the matter with you?

607
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:22,712
Nova Robotics.
Disassemble. Dead.

608
00:43:22,962 --> 00:43:25,256
Disassemble Number Five. Dead.

609
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,425
But you can't die.
You're a machine.

610
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:30,261
- No.
- No, you're not a machine?

611
00:43:30,803 --> 00:43:33,890
- Yes.
- Yes, you are or you're not?

612
00:43:33,973 --> 00:43:35,766
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

613
00:43:36,058 --> 00:43:37,883
Yes, not.

614
00:43:37,935 --> 00:43:40,125
Talk about a malfunction.

615
00:43:40,177 --> 00:43:42,315
Not malfunction, Stephanie.

616
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:47,945
Number Five is alive.

617
00:43:50,156 --> 00:43:51,657
Just keep going straight.
Just keep going straight.

618
00:43:52,033 --> 00:43:53,326
Ok, Ok, alright...

619
00:43:53,784 --> 00:43:55,536
We're getting closer.
Ben, we're getting closer.

620
00:43:55,828 --> 00:43:57,079
I can sense it,
I can sense it.

621
00:43:57,371 --> 00:43:59,123
There they are! You see them?
They're right there.

622
00:44:02,168 --> 00:44:04,253
Nova. Disassemble.

623
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:05,588
Dead. Disassemble number 5.

624
00:44:06,005 --> 00:44:07,590
Dead.

625
00:44:07,924 --> 00:44:10,927
Girlie, girlie, come quick!
Girlie, danger! Come on!

626
00:44:11,385 --> 00:44:12,929
No, no disassemble,

627
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:15,640
No disassemble,
Number Five.

628
00:44:16,682 --> 00:44:18,100
Come on, you!

629
00:44:19,018 --> 00:44:21,145
What planet is this guy from?

630
00:44:21,197 --> 00:44:23,429
No, no disassemble.

631
00:44:23,481 --> 00:44:25,514
Oh, number 5, don't be scared.

632
00:44:25,566 --> 00:44:28,152
You just wait here a second.
I'll be right back.

633
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:37,954
Come on, Number one.
Come on. Very good.

634
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:40,456
Careful. Moving nicely.

635
00:44:40,706 --> 00:44:42,500
Jeez, another one.

636
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:44,450
How many of these guys
have you got, anyway?

637
00:44:44,502 --> 00:44:47,880
- You are a girl, right?
- Yes, as far as I know.

638
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:50,633
Hi.
How you doing?

639
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,052
Your little brother's hiding
in my truck.

640
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:55,680
I have seen some
strange bizarre drivers...

641
00:44:56,013 --> 00:44:58,683
but you may be
awarded the cake.

642
00:44:58,975 --> 00:45:01,686
Me? Talk to your robot.
He did the driving.

643
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:03,802
Did you say the robot
drove the truck?

644
00:45:03,854 --> 00:45:06,764
Yeah, that's right, chum.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

645
00:45:06,816 --> 00:45:09,777
Oh, bull dyke, you cannot hold
your water with that story, girl.

646
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:11,810
Hey, I was there, okay?

647
00:45:11,862 --> 00:45:14,198
You're sure you weren't doing any
steering or anything like that?

648
00:45:14,282 --> 00:45:15,898
Yeah, I like to drive off cliffs.

649
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:19,036
- There's no way my robot could have driven.
- Are you calling me a liar?

650
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:23,207
No, but maybe you
have amnesia.

651
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:28,004
Newton! We are wasting
valueless time.

652
00:45:28,379 --> 00:45:30,339
So what are these guys
used for, anyway?

653
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,925
- It's top-secret crap.
- That's what I figured.

654
00:45:33,259 --> 00:45:35,386
Dr. Love, I'd like to get
my robot back.

655
00:45:35,678 --> 00:45:38,097
He knows that,
but he's scared.

656
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:40,308
It's a machine.
It doesn't get scared.

657
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,602
It doesn't get happy.
It doesn't get sad.

658
00:45:42,852 --> 00:45:46,105
- It just runs programs.
- How do you explain that?

659
00:45:51,611 --> 00:45:52,685
You see?

660
00:45:52,737 --> 00:45:55,281
He's scared that if you take him
apart he's going to die.

661
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:57,116
- Where'd you hear that?
- Number Five told me.

662
00:45:57,168 --> 00:45:59,185
He'd tell you if you'd
just talk to him.

663
00:45:59,237 --> 00:46:01,203
That's what I've been
trying to do for...

664
00:46:01,255 --> 00:46:04,165
No, I mean with your mouth.
Watch.

665
00:46:04,217 --> 00:46:05,166
Okay, Ben,
this is the plan.

666
00:46:05,218 --> 00:46:06,323
Number Five!

667
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:09,045
Number Five!
Come on out. It's okay.

668
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:10,411
- Is it cool?
- It's okay.

669
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:12,256
These guys aren't going
to hurt you. They're friends.

670
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:15,197
- No disassemble?
- No, no.

671
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:17,762
They just want
to talk to you.

672
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:25,728
Come forward.
Do you remember forward?

673
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,678
- Forward.
- That's it, come on.

674
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,899
I can't believe it.
It's listening to her, not to us.

675
00:46:29,951 --> 00:46:32,610
I am standing here
beside myself.

676
00:46:32,662 --> 00:46:34,435
Okay! Now.

677
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:36,781
You just tell them
what you told me.

678
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:40,701
Number Five
not just robot.

679
00:46:40,753 --> 00:46:44,372
There it is! Move out!

680
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:46,415
Move! Move!

681
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:48,668
Move out!

682
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,462
Go! Go! Go!
Today, gentleman, today!

683
00:46:53,381 --> 00:46:55,424
- Down, girlie!
- What, are you nuts?

684
00:47:05,226 --> 00:47:06,894
Stop! Please.

685
00:47:07,186 --> 00:47:09,063
I have clearance!
I have clearance!

686
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,846
Bend down!

687
00:47:10,898 --> 00:47:12,348
You quit doing that!

688
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,194
You think I'm doing this for
my own self-gratification?

689
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:33,212
Go!

690
00:47:43,222 --> 00:47:45,516
No, Don't! Stop!

691
00:47:45,808 --> 00:47:46,726
Stephanie!

692
00:47:49,854 --> 00:47:51,147
They're killing him!

693
00:47:51,272 --> 00:47:52,690
Hold your fire!

694
00:47:53,733 --> 00:47:55,693
Damn it, stop!
Hold your fire!

695
00:47:55,985 --> 00:47:57,904
Hold your fire!

696
00:48:01,073 --> 00:48:03,159
Number Five alive!

697
00:48:04,535 --> 00:48:05,786
Stephanie!

698
00:48:05,828 --> 00:48:07,580
Number Five,
I'm sorry.

699
00:48:08,748 --> 00:48:11,375
Steph-an-ia...

700
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:13,492
You're paralyzing him.

701
00:48:13,544 --> 00:48:17,131
I cut all his power. You can
load it on the truck now.

702
00:48:17,183 --> 00:48:18,883
What the hell
is the matter with you...

703
00:48:19,008 --> 00:48:20,676
you four-eyed idiot.

704
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:22,657
What an asshole.

705
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:24,347
I heard that.

706
00:48:24,472 --> 00:48:27,475
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Where are you taking him?

707
00:48:27,527 --> 00:48:28,851
Okay, I want you guys to...

708
00:48:28,903 --> 00:48:29,842
He's not being a him.

709
00:48:29,894 --> 00:48:32,855
It's only being wires and several
mechanisms and other such...

710
00:48:32,907 --> 00:48:34,138
machine type apparatus...

711
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:37,276
<i>for the Pete of sake.
The sake of Pete...</i>

712
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:39,393
No, you have to turn
him back on.

713
00:48:39,445 --> 00:48:41,822
He was talking before
like a real person.

714
00:48:41,874 --> 00:48:42,897
Couldn't you see that?

715
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:45,409
Look, lady, all I could see was that
something mechanical...

716
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:47,161
is screwed up and
I'm going to fix it, okay?

717
00:48:47,213 --> 00:48:49,038
Ok, fine! You fix it,
Einstein.

718
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,529
I plan to.

719
00:48:50,581 --> 00:48:52,281
And it's Crosby.
Newton Crosby.

720
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:53,876
- Stephanie Speck.
- Nice meeting you.

721
00:48:53,928 --> 00:48:54,867
Same here.

722
00:48:54,919 --> 00:48:56,285
- Ben? Ben?
- Sir! Stat!

723
00:48:56,337 --> 00:48:58,297
I want you to go with Number Five
and make sure they do not...

724
00:48:58,349 --> 00:48:59,882
switch off the memory.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

725
00:48:59,934 --> 00:49:01,259
- Absolutely, sir.
- Okay.

726
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:02,875
Bye-bye, goofy woman.

727
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:05,596
I enjoyed repeatedly throwing
you to the ground.

728
00:49:05,648 --> 00:49:07,348
No mistake.
Stat.

729
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:10,893
You can call me
if you want to.

730
00:49:10,945 --> 00:49:12,092
Call you?

731
00:49:12,144 --> 00:49:13,813
To let me know
if Number Five's okay.

732
00:49:14,939 --> 00:49:16,566
Okay, maybe I will.

733
00:49:16,774 --> 00:49:19,193
Well, don't do me
any favors, Jack.

734
00:49:28,327 --> 00:49:29,235
So there we are.

735
00:49:29,287 --> 00:49:31,028
We're right on top of
Mount St. Helen's...

736
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,208
- and we've got two flat tires.
- Two, that's bad.

737
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,252
Now Hazel's running around
the parking lot.

738
00:49:36,304 --> 00:49:37,837
Hazel.

739
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:39,297
<i>She's waving
her credit card...</i>

740
00:49:41,674 --> 00:49:43,092
It's life.
It's life.

741
00:49:43,134 --> 00:49:46,012
That is very funny
American name, Hazel.

742
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,181
Well, It's sure not one you
can hear much anymore.

743
00:49:49,473 --> 00:49:51,100
I never heard it
before I met her.

744
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:54,103
All except for witch hazel,
who I think she's named after.

745
00:49:54,562 --> 00:49:58,524
- I thought it was a nut.
- That's an old name.

746
00:49:58,816 --> 00:50:00,067
It's an old family name.

747
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:01,694
They were from
some place in Europe...

748
00:50:01,944 --> 00:50:04,864
and there's always a Hazel in it.
In her family.

749
00:50:05,364 --> 00:50:08,242
I guess there's always some
Hazel in Europe.

750
00:50:10,995 --> 00:50:15,166
She's running around trying
to buy somebody's spare tire.

751
00:50:15,207 --> 00:50:18,377
She's showing people her ID's
to prove the checks are good...

752
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:20,421
like a branch of our bank
where they could check.

753
00:50:21,923 --> 00:50:25,509
She was even trying to swap some
souvenirs when she was gotten.

754
00:50:26,093 --> 00:50:28,387
All of which were made from
the ashes of the volcano...

755
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,058
Did you get a piece of ash?

756
00:50:35,394 --> 00:50:37,480
So, of course nobody's going to sell
her a spare tire...

757
00:50:37,532 --> 00:50:39,674
after what we just told
them happened to us.

758
00:50:39,726 --> 00:50:41,817
Especially the way
she was telling them.

759
00:50:42,193 --> 00:50:43,986
And she was trying to convince
them I wasn't a bad driver...

760
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,571
which I'm not.

761
00:50:45,821 --> 00:50:48,407
But, she was doing it by telling
them how thin the road is.

762
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:50,993
You know, and how curvy and
how many rocks there were...

763
00:50:51,045 --> 00:50:52,453
and how big
and sharp they are.

764
00:50:52,745 --> 00:50:54,538
And all the time I know
what these people are thinking.

765
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:56,666
They gotta drive down
the same road...

766
00:51:31,951 --> 00:51:33,411
- Sir?
- Yes, sir?

767
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:34,912
Sir?

768
00:51:35,371 --> 00:51:37,540
Oh, my goodness gracious!

769
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,417
It can't shoot us with
that laser, can it?

770
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,158
I am not knowing.

771
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:44,213
- Would he kill me if I stopped?
- Who is to say?

772
00:51:44,265 --> 00:51:45,882
Would he kill me
if I don't stop?

773
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:47,967
Again I am shrugging.

774
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:49,635
I'm stopping.

775
00:51:51,596 --> 00:51:52,711
Good choice.

776
00:51:52,763 --> 00:51:55,433
Number Five furious,
livid, perturbed.

777
00:51:57,018 --> 00:51:59,395
Hold it right there.

778
00:52:00,646 --> 00:52:02,857
Colt 45.
Semi automatic.

779
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,432
Play Doh.

780
00:52:05,484 --> 00:52:06,485
What do we do now?

781
00:52:06,736 --> 00:52:10,364
I don't know about you, but
I'm planning to scream and run.

782
00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:12,533
Good answer.

783
00:52:22,084 --> 00:52:23,920
What is he doing?

784
00:53:01,082 --> 00:53:02,667
There it goes
Very good.

785
00:53:03,417 --> 00:53:04,752
You earned that one.

786
00:53:22,728 --> 00:53:25,064
Hi, honey!
What is for dinner?

787
00:53:47,003 --> 00:53:48,379
Bingo!

788
00:53:56,053 --> 00:53:57,992
<i>Practice, Easy Three,
to third and fourth.</i>

789
00:53:58,044 --> 00:53:59,932
<i>Lucky's seventh and
Pacer in the rear.</i>

790
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:03,185
<i>Now it's Double Trouble making
a move on the outside rail...</i>

791
00:54:03,237 --> 00:54:06,005
<i>and Practice right behind.
Jimmy's Folly is calling...</i>

792
00:54:06,057 --> 00:54:08,774
<i>That's the serpent and the devil...
same on him.</i>

793
00:54:09,275 --> 00:54:10,610
<i>And the devil is the...</i>

794
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:04,372
Ready, aim!

795
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:07,583
What happened?

796
00:55:10,294 --> 00:55:12,672
I hope you took the grass
out of the glove compartment.

797
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:15,633
Anything wrong, officer?

798
00:55:16,634 --> 00:55:18,886
There's gotta be a logical
explanation for all of this.

799
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:22,139
Maybe, if it was programmed
to think it was alive...

800
00:55:22,191 --> 00:55:23,641
then it could act alive.

801
00:55:23,683 --> 00:55:26,310
Maybe you've created another
Frankfurter's monster.

802
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:29,188
Do I look like the kind of a man
who can actually hear his...

803
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,056
Howard I think that something
incredible is going on.

804
00:55:32,108 --> 00:55:34,026
What's going on is that we've
got a red alert on your hands?

805
00:55:34,078 --> 00:55:34,986
No, it's not dangerous.

806
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:37,196
We just have to find
Number Five, get some answers.

807
00:55:37,248 --> 00:55:38,604
There's only one answer.

808
00:55:38,656 --> 00:55:40,575
All right, blast it off the
face of the earth, right?

809
00:55:40,825 --> 00:55:43,119
Doctor... how many kids you got?

810
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:44,735
None.

811
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:45,871
Well, let me tell you
something, Doctor.

812
00:55:45,955 --> 00:55:49,125
I got three of them.
Three dandy little Schroeders.

813
00:55:49,177 --> 00:55:51,173
And I want them to be adults,
not barbecued.

814
00:55:51,225 --> 00:55:53,118
So don't you give me
any of your bullshit.

815
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,298
That having been said, I think
I've got to alert the media.

816
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:56,799
Now Schroeder's going to handle
this from now on...

817
00:55:57,008 --> 00:55:58,175
and you stay
at your terminal.

818
00:55:58,217 --> 00:55:59,500
Howard, this is ridiculous.

819
00:55:59,552 --> 00:56:01,126
Think of it as
a full-scale field test.

820
00:56:01,178 --> 00:56:02,837
Leave your terminal and
you're out of a job.

821
00:56:02,889 --> 00:56:04,515
Howard, we are going to have
to put up some roadblocks...

822
00:56:04,807 --> 00:56:06,225
and I'm going to
need some Hueys.

823
00:56:06,277 --> 00:56:07,216
Some what?

824
00:56:07,268 --> 00:56:09,478
Helicopters, Howard.
Jesus Christ!

825
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:12,148
- I thought they were choppers.
- Now they're called Hueys.

826
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,233
Well, why wasn't I notified?

827
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,573
Okay, this is the plan...

828
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,879
- Stephanie Speck.
- Yes.

829
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:35,744
We're from KJMB News.

830
00:56:35,796 --> 00:56:38,507
Can you please tell us something
about the Nova robot?

831
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,301
- Were you scared?
- No, no.

832
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,303
<i>Did he try to molest
you in any way?</i>

833
00:56:42,553 --> 00:56:44,305
<i>No, he's not that kind
of a robot.</i>

834
00:56:44,388 --> 00:56:47,433
<i>Do you know that there's a $25
thousand reward for anyone that turns it in?</i>

835
00:56:47,485 --> 00:56:48,841
<i>No, I don't know anything
about it.</i>

836
00:56:48,893 --> 00:56:51,103
<i>I don't know where he is.
Please, leave me alone.</i>

837
00:56:51,155 --> 00:56:52,396
<i>Why didn't you go
to the police?</i>

838
00:56:53,189 --> 00:56:54,982
You know where it is.

839
00:56:56,442 --> 00:57:00,238
For 25 thousand dollars I'm damn
well going to know where it is too.

840
00:57:08,246 --> 00:57:09,830
Frank?

841
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:13,709
Is that you, Frank?

842
00:57:14,252 --> 00:57:16,504
I'm warning you,
I'm armed and dangerous.

843
00:57:21,092 --> 00:57:24,178
Disguise, camouflage. Hi!

844
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,265
Number Five!
You got away?

845
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:28,339
Yep.

846
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:29,809
You can't stay here!
They'll find you!

847
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:33,729
Stephanie.
Changed color.

848
00:57:38,025 --> 00:57:42,989
Attractive,
nice software.

849
00:57:43,114 --> 00:57:45,762
You sure don't talk
like a machine.

850
00:57:45,814 --> 00:57:47,946
Alive, Stephanie.
Number Five alive.

851
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:49,914
Yes, I know you think
you're alive...

852
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,831
but those guys who built
you say no way.

853
00:57:52,331 --> 00:57:53,916
I don't know what
to think anymore.

854
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:55,418
I know it's not safe
for you here.

855
00:57:55,585 --> 00:57:57,044
Go on.
Get out of here. Go on!

856
00:57:59,505 --> 00:58:03,718
Solitude, isolation. Alone.

857
00:58:04,093 --> 00:58:06,721
Number Five, come on!

858
00:58:07,471 --> 00:58:09,421
Lonely bum.

859
00:58:09,473 --> 00:58:11,257
Number five, please.

860
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:14,729
If I went to jail, who would
take care of my animals?

861
00:58:14,781 --> 00:58:16,355
You sure wouldn't.

862
00:58:17,231 --> 00:58:18,597
What are you doing?

863
00:58:18,649 --> 00:58:21,694
"A can of soup.
A meal in itself."

864
00:58:23,362 --> 00:58:26,490
All right, you can stay,
but just for tonight.

865
00:58:26,616 --> 00:58:27,356
Excellent.

866
00:58:27,408 --> 00:58:29,035
If they catch you
I don't know you.

867
00:58:29,869 --> 00:58:31,162
You got it.

868
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:32,580
Okay, Ben, let's do it.

869
00:58:33,331 --> 00:58:35,791
This is the very first vehicle
I've stolen in the US of A.

870
00:58:35,843 --> 00:58:36,918
Me, too. It's kind of exciting,
Isn't it?

871
00:58:37,126 --> 00:58:39,086
With excitement like this,
who is needing enemas?

872
00:58:39,138 --> 00:58:40,369
Look Ben, we're doing
the right thing.

873
00:58:40,421 --> 00:58:43,216
If they trash Number Five, we'll
never find out what happened.

874
00:58:44,217 --> 00:58:46,177
Dr. Marner!

875
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:48,012
I knew you would try this.

876
00:58:48,137 --> 00:58:49,211
You're not going
to make it, fellas.

877
00:58:49,263 --> 00:58:51,724
There are soldiers out there
with bazooka's and choppers...

878
00:58:51,776 --> 00:58:53,340
or whatever the hell
they call them now.

879
00:58:53,392 --> 00:58:56,646
We've got to try anyway. You're
a scientist, you understand.

880
00:58:56,698 --> 00:58:58,481
I'm a business man.
I'm not a scientist anymore.

881
00:58:58,731 --> 00:58:59,732
Damn you, Howard.

882
00:58:59,982 --> 00:59:02,318
20 years ago you would have
chauffeured us in this situation.

883
00:59:02,443 --> 00:59:03,809
Well, times have changed.

884
00:59:03,861 --> 00:59:06,145
Because that was then
and this is now.

885
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:08,366
All right, now come on.
Let's get back upstairs.

886
00:59:09,075 --> 00:59:10,660
What the heck, Newton.

887
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:13,329
Let us punch the sack.
Tomorrow is the next day.

888
00:59:13,913 --> 00:59:15,373
No.

889
00:59:16,832 --> 00:59:18,376
No.

890
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:20,419
No. I'm going.

891
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:23,506
Howard, shoot me
if you have to.

892
00:59:23,558 --> 00:59:24,549
Don't think I won't.

893
00:59:24,632 --> 00:59:25,883
Come on, Howard,
you know you're bluffing.

894
00:59:25,935 --> 00:59:27,552
Lord Rama, Lord Rama.

895
00:59:27,635 --> 00:59:29,303
Lord Rama,
Lord Rama, grant my wish.

896
00:59:31,556 --> 00:59:32,546
All right, I'm bluffing.

897
00:59:32,598 --> 00:59:34,725
Ok, thank you. Come on, Ben,
let's get out of here.

898
00:59:34,777 --> 00:59:36,060
Right. Very good.

899
00:59:38,312 --> 00:59:41,274
It doesn't matter anyway, the
doors are electronically sealed.

900
00:59:41,649 --> 00:59:42,483
Don't be too sure.

901
00:59:47,446 --> 00:59:49,156
Then you'll have
to drive over me.

902
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:50,621
That's the way
it's gotta be.

903
00:59:50,673 --> 00:59:52,034
This is going to be
very messy.

904
00:59:52,118 --> 00:59:54,745
This is how I get
the big bucks.

905
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:28,779
Yeah.

906
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,521
Oh, very good.

907
01:01:03,022 --> 01:01:04,440
Great.

908
01:01:04,649 --> 01:01:06,817
Oh! Hey, thanks.

909
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:09,695
Okay, turn off the TV.

910
01:01:09,779 --> 01:01:11,572
- It's time for bed.
- No.

911
01:01:18,037 --> 01:01:20,665
No, turn off the TV.
It's time for bed.

912
01:01:21,123 --> 01:01:25,127
Come on Steph, lighten up.
Let's give it a whirl.

913
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:26,837
- Hey!
- Ya!

914
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:31,425
- Listen, you, it's three a.m.
- It's early.

915
01:01:31,676 --> 01:01:33,083
I mean, don't you ever
get enough?

916
01:01:33,135 --> 01:01:35,658
Wrestling, roller derby,
Jimmy Swaggert...

917
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:38,182
The Three Stooges.
Give it a rest, will ya?

918
01:01:38,234 --> 01:01:40,810
Larry, Curly, Moe.

919
01:01:41,936 --> 01:01:45,273
Hey, know what?
You're not a bad dancer.

920
01:01:45,565 --> 01:01:46,983
Dancing fool.

921
01:01:50,486 --> 01:01:52,113
- Big finish.
- Right.

922
01:01:52,446 --> 01:01:54,907
And then I'm going to bed
and in the morning...

923
01:01:54,959 --> 01:01:57,118
you have to find yourself
a new home.

924
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:00,329
This home.
Stephanie home.

925
01:02:00,381 --> 01:02:01,820
Number Five home.

926
01:02:01,872 --> 01:02:04,792
Oh, Number Five, you don't know
what you're saying.

927
01:02:04,844 --> 01:02:06,961
Number Five know.

928
01:02:14,343 --> 01:02:16,345
"More than a woman."

929
01:02:18,598 --> 01:02:21,392
"More than a woman to me."

930
01:02:21,444 --> 01:02:22,852
Oh, Number Five.

931
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:29,817
"More than a woman to me."

932
01:02:40,244 --> 01:02:42,246
<i>I'll croon</i>

933
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:45,291
<i>A little song
About the moon</i>

934
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:49,754
<i>And when I'm finished
With my crooning</i>

935
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:52,089
<i>On my knees I'll fall</i>

936
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:55,092
<i>My life, my love, my all</i>

937
01:02:56,928 --> 01:03:01,098
Okay, to make these
golden fluffy pancakes...

938
01:03:01,224 --> 01:03:05,061
add flour, milk...

939
01:03:05,113 --> 01:03:06,520
and eggs.

940
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:15,821
Mix thoroughly.

941
01:03:21,577 --> 01:03:23,037
Still lumpy.

942
01:03:29,335 --> 01:03:30,753
Marvelous.

943
01:03:31,712 --> 01:03:33,756
For crisp, yet moist
potatoes...

944
01:03:34,215 --> 01:03:36,801
brown on one side,
then turn over.

945
01:03:40,388 --> 01:03:42,932
This will be
some good slop.

946
01:03:43,391 --> 01:03:45,226
Is something burning?

947
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:48,104
- Morning.
- Oh! Number Five!

948
01:03:48,156 --> 01:03:50,346
- Good morning.
- Sleep well?

949
01:03:50,398 --> 01:03:52,650
You're making me breakfast,
aren't you?

950
01:03:52,702 --> 01:03:54,151
Pancakes surprise.

951
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:56,988
Oh, Number Five,
you're so sweet.

952
01:03:58,573 --> 01:03:59,991
Oh, no.

953
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:04,495
It's the revenge
of the Mutations.

954
01:04:04,662 --> 01:04:08,207
Listen, why don't you turn that
stove off and I'll be right back.

955
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:11,377
Wait!
It'll get cold.

956
01:04:14,297 --> 01:04:15,506
What are you
doing here, creep?

957
01:04:15,558 --> 01:04:16,956
Oh, good morning.

958
01:04:17,008 --> 01:04:19,010
I saw you on TV last night
on the news.

959
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:20,761
Yeah, I'm a real
big celebrity.

960
01:04:21,178 --> 01:04:22,972
You know there's
a reward out for that robot?

961
01:04:23,097 --> 01:04:24,724
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

962
01:04:25,182 --> 01:04:26,475
No, I don't know
anything about it.

963
01:04:26,517 --> 01:04:27,852
Why don't you get off
my property?

964
01:04:39,447 --> 01:04:41,407
- Steph...
- Leave me alone.

965
01:04:41,616 --> 01:04:43,034
- Where is it?
- It's not here.

966
01:04:43,409 --> 01:04:46,621
- Get out or I'll call the cops.
- Stephanie, breakfast.

967
01:04:46,954 --> 01:04:49,624
Pancakes, hash browns.

968
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:53,033
Twenty five thousand dollars.

969
01:04:53,085 --> 01:04:55,671
Don't worry, we'll split it.
Twenty for me and five for you.

970
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:57,757
Listen, you gotta talk
computer to him.

971
01:04:57,882 --> 01:04:58,758
Tell him exactly what
you're doing...

972
01:04:59,091 --> 01:05:01,052
exactly where you're going, or
he's not going to move an inch.

973
01:05:01,302 --> 01:05:03,304
Number Five, this is Frank.

974
01:05:04,555 --> 01:05:07,975
How, Robot.
Me friend.

975
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:11,020
No, talk computer,
not Apache.

976
01:05:11,562 --> 01:05:14,482
Fresh O.J.?
Not from concentrate.

977
01:05:17,276 --> 01:05:20,363
Thanks.

978
01:05:20,488 --> 01:05:21,948
Listen, what do you say
we jump in my car...

979
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,699
we'll take a ride.
I'll take you home.

980
01:05:24,617 --> 01:05:26,244
Tell him where home is.

981
01:05:26,494 --> 01:05:28,287
Home is Nova.

982
01:05:28,955 --> 01:05:30,206
Nova! No!

983
01:05:30,498 --> 01:05:31,895
No disassemble!

984
01:05:31,947 --> 01:05:33,292
Number Five, run!

985
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:35,086
Come on, treads,
don't fail me now.

986
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:38,235
- Run, get away now!
- Get off me!

987
01:05:38,287 --> 01:05:40,873
You tricked me,
you little bitch!

988
01:05:40,925 --> 01:05:43,302
Does this mean I don't
get my five thousand dollars?

989
01:05:43,678 --> 01:05:45,513
Forget it! Forget it!

990
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:48,474
He can go thirty miles an hour,
you big stupid jerk.

991
01:05:48,808 --> 01:05:49,882
I'll show you, how
stupid I am.

992
01:05:49,934 --> 01:05:52,853
- Guess who's going to help me catch it.
- No, I'd rather die first!

993
01:05:52,905 --> 01:05:54,021
Where the hell is my car?

994
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,817
Hi.

995
01:06:02,989 --> 01:06:04,355
Piece of cake.

996
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:06,659
Oh, my God!
My car!

997
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:09,996
- Oh, way to go, Number Five.
- Uh-oh!

998
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:15,293
Oh, my God, no!

999
01:06:15,543 --> 01:06:17,003
Number Five, look out!

1000
01:06:19,505 --> 01:06:22,925
"Say Pilgrim, that like to
parted my hair."

1001
01:06:23,009 --> 01:06:26,304
"If you wanna play rough,
I can sure oblige ya."

1002
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:30,641
How can he do that?

1003
01:06:38,941 --> 01:06:39,932
"Frankie...

1004
01:06:39,984 --> 01:06:43,946
you broke the unwritten law.
You ratted on your friends.

1005
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:46,573
And when you do that, Frankie...

1006
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,367
your enemies don't respect you...

1007
01:06:48,419 --> 01:06:50,791
you got no friends no more.

1008
01:06:50,843 --> 01:06:53,164
You got nobody Frankie."

1009
01:06:53,915 --> 01:06:55,374
Pretty good, huh?

1010
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:58,211
Unbelievable.

1011
01:06:58,794 --> 01:07:00,171
Look out!

1012
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,216
How about that,
a goddamn robot?

1013
01:07:05,509 --> 01:07:07,762
Stephanie, get off me!

1014
01:07:08,137 --> 01:07:09,972
Stephanie, that's it.

1015
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:12,975
No!
Not disassemble Stephanie.

1016
01:07:16,896 --> 01:07:18,105
No!

1017
01:07:42,255 --> 01:07:44,799
I'm calling Nova, and I'm
calling the cops.

1018
01:07:45,007 --> 01:07:46,634
And as for you, you
little pain-in-the-neck...

1019
01:07:46,842 --> 01:07:49,470
you better not come crawling
back to me, because now it's over!

1020
01:07:49,762 --> 01:07:50,763
Good.

1021
01:07:51,847 --> 01:07:52,838
Okay, come on.

1022
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:54,559
They're gonna be after you.
We gotta get out here, now.

1023
01:07:59,355 --> 01:08:02,233
So now I am having no job
to speak about.

1024
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:04,110
I will have to smack
the sidewalk.

1025
01:08:04,277 --> 01:08:05,945
I'm not going to let it happen.
You're not going to get fired...

1026
01:08:06,153 --> 01:08:07,446
I'm not going to get fired...

1027
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:09,740
because we're going to find
Number Five intact.

1028
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:10,606
Very good.

1029
01:08:10,658 --> 01:08:12,159
<i>That's right, Howard.</i>

1030
01:08:12,285 --> 01:08:14,203
- It's Scrotum?
- Schoreder.

1031
01:08:14,745 --> 01:08:15,694
Same thing.

1032
01:08:15,746 --> 01:08:16,654
<i>Now all roads are blocked</i>

1033
01:08:16,706 --> 01:08:19,542
<i>her only chance is
a back road into the hills.</i>

1034
01:08:19,594 --> 01:08:21,711
<i>We'll concentrate our search there.</i>

1035
01:08:26,007 --> 01:08:27,967
Where the hell are we?

1036
01:08:28,467 --> 01:08:29,886
"New York City".

1037
01:08:29,927 --> 01:08:32,054
No, I don't think so.
Try the other side.

1038
01:08:32,106 --> 01:08:33,055
Ok.

1039
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:36,309
Oh. Texaco.

1040
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:37,560
Great.

1041
01:08:38,019 --> 01:08:40,605
Well, I'm lost.
I don't know where to go.

1042
01:08:40,938 --> 01:08:42,815
- Strategy.
- What about it?

1043
01:08:42,867 --> 01:08:44,358
Need some, quick.

1044
01:08:44,609 --> 01:08:47,320
Right, what we need is somebody
to make those bozos listen.

1045
01:08:48,571 --> 01:08:50,573
- Not bozos.
- What?

1046
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:51,782
One bozo.

1047
01:08:51,991 --> 01:08:54,076
Newton Crosby, PhD.

1048
01:08:54,327 --> 01:08:56,662
Hey, malfunction, he's the enemy.
He can't help.

1049
01:08:57,413 --> 01:08:58,612
Couldn't hurt.

1050
01:08:58,664 --> 01:09:00,666
You know, I know why Number
Five took a liking to her.

1051
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:04,212
If it did have that capability,
which it doesn't, but if it did.

1052
01:09:04,264 --> 01:09:06,579
I mean, I think she's pretty,
don't you think?

1053
01:09:06,631 --> 01:09:09,800
I am thinking she's a virgin.
Or at least she used to be.

1054
01:09:10,343 --> 01:09:11,719
<i>Hello Crosby.</i>

1055
01:09:11,844 --> 01:09:12,918
I think it's Howard.

1056
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:15,556
<i>I know you're listening,
so pick up the mike.</i>

1057
01:09:15,608 --> 01:09:17,642
This is Crosby.
How's your back, Howard?

1058
01:09:17,694 --> 01:09:19,175
Just hunky-dory, thanks.

1059
01:09:19,227 --> 01:09:21,604
I just swore out some warrants
for your arrest.

1060
01:09:21,687 --> 01:09:22,595
Good golly.

1061
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:25,816
<i>But because I'm a nice guy, I'm
going to give you one last chance.</i>

1062
01:09:26,108 --> 01:09:28,527
<i>I got a phone call from that loony
in the lunch wagon.</i>

1063
01:09:28,579 --> 01:09:29,779
<i>She wants to see you.</i>

1064
01:09:30,488 --> 01:09:32,521
<i>- Only you.
- She does?</i>

1065
01:09:32,573 --> 01:09:35,076
Oh! Her pants are blazing for
you Newton Crosby.

1066
01:09:35,534 --> 01:09:38,538
Will you grow up. I'll be there,
Howard, on one condition.

1067
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:39,914
No Schroeder.
Is it a deal?

1068
01:09:39,997 --> 01:09:41,165
<i>It's a deal.</i>

1069
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:43,793
<i>- Where does she want to meet?
- The Black Lion Inn.</i>

1070
01:09:54,387 --> 01:09:55,721
Good luck, sir.

1071
01:10:18,661 --> 01:10:19,912
Hi.

1072
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:22,696
He's hidden far away.

1073
01:10:22,748 --> 01:10:24,333
He's scared of you guys,
you know.

1074
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,503
Do I get him or not?

1075
01:10:27,545 --> 01:10:29,714
First we talk... inside.

1076
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:35,751
My ex-boyfriend used to
bring me here.

1077
01:10:35,803 --> 01:10:38,222
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Fine, good to see you.

1078
01:10:38,274 --> 01:10:40,933
- Yeah, ex. So what?
- Ah, nothing.

1079
01:10:43,352 --> 01:10:45,229
Okay, here's the deal.

1080
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:47,732
Number Five is alive.

1081
01:10:48,733 --> 01:10:52,737
I mean, he is really alive,
like you and me, you see?

1082
01:10:52,789 --> 01:10:54,770
I understand. They can seem
quite life-like...

1083
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:57,742
but they're still machines.
Just like your stereo...

1084
01:10:57,794 --> 01:10:59,019
or your vacuum cleaner.

1085
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,244
No, I know he's a machine.

1086
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:02,778
You're a machine, I'm a
machine. We're alive.

1087
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:06,042
How it happens, who the hell
knows. But it has happened.

1088
01:11:06,094 --> 01:11:07,543
Okay.

1089
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:12,256
Believe me, I'm not against the
idea that happen, but you see...

1090
01:11:12,506 --> 01:11:14,634
I built the machine from scratch.

1091
01:11:15,468 --> 01:11:17,511
And alive, alive...

1092
01:11:17,678 --> 01:11:18,711
it doesn't compute.

1093
01:11:18,763 --> 01:11:23,559
I know. It's not your everyday
event. But somehow, it's true.

1094
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:28,814
As Guerrero steps to the plate.
The pitch...

1095
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:33,110
and it's a long line drive
to deep left center.

1096
01:11:33,277 --> 01:11:35,529
Hyde is going back for it!
He's...

1097
01:11:40,785 --> 01:11:43,329
Robot alert!
Number Five located.

1098
01:11:43,955 --> 01:11:46,749
Engage in capture,
do not destroy.

1099
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:50,419
Have you thought about
what you're doing?

1100
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:52,328
Trying to hide something
like this?

1101
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:56,384
If you want to help Number Five,
let me have it back.

1102
01:11:56,436 --> 01:11:58,678
It's malfunctioning.
It needs to be repaired.

1103
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:01,347
Life is not a malfunction.

1104
01:12:06,811 --> 01:12:09,021
Number Five axis four twenty-nine.

1105
01:12:09,073 --> 01:12:10,356
Stay where you are.

1106
01:12:11,857 --> 01:12:15,111
- Strike three.
- Number Five, stay where you are.

1107
01:12:17,238 --> 01:12:20,324
Number one,
you're out of there.

1108
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:25,079
Number Five, stay
where you are.

1109
01:12:26,372 --> 01:12:27,373
Oh, my gosh.

1110
01:12:33,045 --> 01:12:33,796
Tools.

1111
01:12:34,005 --> 01:12:35,131
Hammer! Axe!

1112
01:12:36,799 --> 01:12:37,748
Rope!

1113
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,678
Three quarter inch double-braid.
Perfecto!

1114
01:12:41,554 --> 01:12:44,557
"Escaped Robot Fights for
His Life. Film at Eleven."

1115
01:12:44,609 --> 01:12:46,058
Target in sight. Fire!

1116
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:52,523
Capture and hold.
Elevation sixteen degrees.

1117
01:12:53,274 --> 01:12:57,319
Visibility five feet,
two feet, no feet.

1118
01:12:57,371 --> 01:13:01,365
Hey, laser lips! Your mama
was a snowblower.

1119
01:13:18,341 --> 01:13:21,135
That wraps you up,
you rascally robot.

1120
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:27,725
Target located. Elevation
sixteen degrees. Fire!

1121
01:13:28,517 --> 01:13:29,769
Holy moley!

1122
01:13:34,023 --> 01:13:36,442
- Elevation 22 degrees.
- Dumbo!

1123
01:13:36,901 --> 01:13:38,277
Axis lost. Seventeen...

1124
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,357
Temper, temper!

1125
01:13:45,409 --> 01:13:46,786
Three degrees. Fire!

1126
01:13:53,709 --> 01:13:54,710
Oley!

1127
01:13:57,255 --> 01:13:59,549
Don't fire.
Don't light a match.

1128
01:14:00,758 --> 01:14:03,928
Well, when you gotta go
don't squeeze the charming.

1129
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:28,818
Oh, no.
Nova!

1130
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:29,735
Let me tell you something.

1131
01:14:29,787 --> 01:14:31,946
I don't like these Nova guys
anymore than you do.

1132
01:14:31,998 --> 01:14:34,375
In fact, I don't care if they
ever get Number Five back...

1133
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:35,533
but I want to see it.

1134
01:14:35,585 --> 01:14:38,713
If I show where he is,
do I have your word...

1135
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:40,449
you will not experiment on him?

1136
01:14:40,501 --> 01:14:42,276
You will not flip his switches?

1137
01:14:42,328 --> 01:14:43,940
And you will not take him apart?

1138
01:14:43,992 --> 01:14:45,553
Absolutely.
You have my word.

1139
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,390
He's out back.
I'll take you to him.

1140
01:14:49,473 --> 01:14:51,350
If you are ready, young lady,
you can take me, too.

1141
01:14:51,402 --> 01:14:52,216
Schroeder!

1142
01:14:52,268 --> 01:14:53,978
Terrific job, Crosby.
Thanks for the help.

1143
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,438
- No, I had nothing...
- You bastard!

1144
01:14:55,605 --> 01:14:57,064
- I'm not...
- You're liar.

1145
01:14:57,116 --> 01:14:58,065
No I didn't know...

1146
01:15:00,776 --> 01:15:02,445
Stephanie, a trap!

1147
01:15:02,528 --> 01:15:04,196
Nova! Depart!

1148
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:05,907
<i>Look out!</i>

1149
01:15:17,585 --> 01:15:18,878
Here's your table sir.

1150
01:15:19,212 --> 01:15:22,131
- You little bastard!
- Paco, please. No autographs, sir.

1151
01:15:23,549 --> 01:15:26,135
Come Stephanie.
We be German.

1152
01:15:29,931 --> 01:15:30,806
Bastard!

1153
01:15:35,561 --> 01:15:36,594
Stop!

1154
01:15:36,646 --> 01:15:38,606
- Stop!
- Go, go, go, go!

1155
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:51,536
Great idea. Newton Crosby,
Ph. Dork.

1156
01:15:58,876 --> 01:16:01,254
- What are you doing?
- Keep driving.

1157
01:16:13,099 --> 01:16:15,726
- Step on it!
- Okay, hold on.

1158
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:27,989
I have had it!
I have had it!

1159
01:16:28,573 --> 01:16:31,867
- This was a precision operation.
- Schroeder, you set me up!

1160
01:16:31,919 --> 01:16:33,828
Crosby, I'm telling you
right now...

1161
01:16:34,203 --> 01:16:37,707
this little fart of a robot is
beginning to give me red ass.

1162
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:41,116
Where the hell
are those other robots?

1163
01:16:41,168 --> 01:16:44,046
They should have cut
Number Five to pieces by now.

1164
01:16:48,509 --> 01:16:50,595
- Where are you guys going?
- Who's asking?

1165
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:52,602
A wise guy.

1166
01:16:52,654 --> 01:16:54,557
Excuse this.

1167
01:16:54,765 --> 01:16:56,142
And this.

1168
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:02,064
<i>Hey, Cut it out!</i>

1169
01:17:07,862 --> 01:17:09,155
<i>Numskulls.</i>

1170
01:17:26,047 --> 01:17:28,341
Cars. Dumb machines.

1171
01:17:29,342 --> 01:17:30,468
That creep.

1172
01:17:30,927 --> 01:17:33,304
I should have known. Every time
I think a guy's gonna be okay...

1173
01:17:33,356 --> 01:17:34,837
turns out to be a real jerk.

1174
01:17:34,889 --> 01:17:36,432
They are all alike!
All of them!

1175
01:17:36,766 --> 01:17:37,975
Stephanie...

1176
01:17:38,017 --> 01:17:40,061
Well, the next time they mess
with us, we're gonna kick ass.

1177
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:43,022
Kick ass?
Donkey, mule, burro...

1178
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:45,524
One of them comes near you,
you blast them!

1179
01:17:45,816 --> 01:17:47,526
Just burn his butt
with your laser.

1180
01:17:47,578 --> 01:17:48,945
- Burn?
- Yeah!

1181
01:17:50,196 --> 01:17:53,241
No!
No disassemble.

1182
01:17:53,866 --> 01:17:56,786
Number Five, come on,
they deserve it.

1183
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,329
Stephanie.

1184
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,332
Jesus, I'm sorry.

1185
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:02,500
I just...

1186
01:18:03,793 --> 01:18:06,546
I don't know what
to do anymore.

1187
01:18:07,547 --> 01:18:09,298
Take heart little lady.

1188
01:18:09,799 --> 01:18:11,717
I'll fix their wagon.

1189
01:18:32,947 --> 01:18:36,868
Well, the cat is dragged in a sight
for four eyes that is for sure.

1190
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,442
You look dreadful.

1191
01:18:38,494 --> 01:18:39,912
What happened?
Where is Number five?

1192
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:42,832
I saw something incredible.
I saw three robots...

1193
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,406
totally re-programmed in
ten minutes.

1194
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,794
I saw Number Five crash
trough a wall, grab the girl...

1195
01:18:46,846 --> 01:18:47,910
I think he was rescuing her...

1196
01:18:47,962 --> 01:18:49,995
crash trough another wall
and drive away.

1197
01:18:50,047 --> 01:18:52,456
- It was screaming her name.
- Now, wait a minute.

1198
01:18:52,508 --> 01:18:54,864
If you're thinking what I'm
thinking you're thinking...

1199
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:57,528
then you are thinking that
female chick is some sort of...

1200
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:00,141
- super hacker or something.
- Sure. She's a super hacker.

1201
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:01,460
First, she cracks
the Nova access code...

1202
01:19:01,512 --> 01:19:02,675
then, she deciphers
for the language...

1203
01:19:02,727 --> 01:19:05,062
I invented, all
while we were sitting in the bar.

1204
01:19:06,063 --> 01:19:08,586
- Which was great.
- Really? Tell me. What happened?

1205
01:19:08,638 --> 01:19:11,110
We were interfacing, operating
on the same wavelength...

1206
01:19:11,162 --> 01:19:12,278
Very good, my advice helped, then.

1207
01:19:13,738 --> 01:19:15,823
What happened, did she stick
her tongue down your throat?

1208
01:19:15,865 --> 01:19:16,647
No, no.

1209
01:19:16,699 --> 01:19:18,826
Come on, sit in the van and tell me.
I want to know, yes sir.

1210
01:19:18,878 --> 01:19:19,869
Yes! Come on, Newton.

1211
01:19:20,119 --> 01:19:20,943
Oh, my goodness.

1212
01:19:20,995 --> 01:19:24,207
I am sporting
a tremendous woody right now.

1213
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,458
Come on, tell me Newton.

1214
01:19:27,126 --> 01:19:29,170
Our hands came really
close to touching.

1215
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:31,214
And she said I had really
nice eyes.

1216
01:19:31,255 --> 01:19:32,256
Yeah, you have really brown eyes.

1217
01:19:32,381 --> 01:19:35,551
And then Schroeder came in with
his Gestapo and ruined it all.

1218
01:19:35,603 --> 01:19:37,829
Those bunch of
male-type organs.

1219
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:40,056
- Right.
- That's what I'm meaning.

1220
01:19:40,848 --> 01:19:41,839
That's the RF receiver.

1221
01:19:41,891 --> 01:19:43,914
It's still tuned to Number Five's
wavelength, right?

1222
01:19:43,966 --> 01:19:45,937
Yes, but only if it is less than
twenty feet away.

1223
01:19:48,397 --> 01:19:50,858
Hello, bozos.

1224
01:19:51,984 --> 01:19:57,657
<i>Guys, it's Howard. If you don't
return my van in 15 minutes...</i>

1225
01:19:59,659 --> 01:20:02,703
Benjamin Jhabutiyah,
delete.

1226
01:20:02,995 --> 01:20:04,747
No, wait!
Rethink yourself.

1227
01:20:04,799 --> 01:20:06,791
Exit, depart, leave.

1228
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:09,085
Hear my dust, Newton Crosby!

1229
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:10,127
Let us break wind!

1230
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:15,550
Newton Crosby,
no run, no talk.

1231
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,510
Drive.

1232
01:20:19,595 --> 01:20:21,764
Today, Crosby, today!

1233
01:20:39,323 --> 01:20:40,783
Number Five?

1234
01:20:42,785 --> 01:20:44,787
Number Five,
where are you?

1235
01:20:57,341 --> 01:20:58,801
All right dipshit...

1236
01:20:59,176 --> 01:21:01,085
where's Number Five?
What did you do to him?

1237
01:21:01,137 --> 01:21:03,222
- You gotta control yourself just a tad.
- Hello.

1238
01:21:04,348 --> 01:21:05,548
Hi.

1239
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,560
You kidnapped him?

1240
01:21:07,602 --> 01:21:10,313
Kidnapped,
shanghaied, hijacked.

1241
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,231
Outstanding!

1242
01:21:12,315 --> 01:21:14,567
Communicate!
Need input!

1243
01:21:14,817 --> 01:21:17,319
I have questions,
queries, posers.

1244
01:21:17,371 --> 01:21:19,770
- You and me, both.
- Well, good.

1245
01:21:19,822 --> 01:21:23,576
You go up there, sit down,
look at the stars...

1246
01:21:23,993 --> 01:21:27,163
talk to each other,
get to know each other...

1247
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,998
- man to man.
- Yes.

1248
01:21:29,248 --> 01:21:32,126
Beautiful stars.
Better see.

1249
01:21:32,585 --> 01:21:35,546
Beautiful stars.
Better see?

1250
01:21:35,588 --> 01:21:36,537
Oh, my God.

1251
01:21:36,589 --> 01:21:39,248
Are all geniuses as
stupid as you?

1252
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,781
He means it's a beautiful
view of the stars.

1253
01:21:41,833 --> 01:21:44,263
I think he speaks very well
for a four day old.

1254
01:21:46,933 --> 01:21:50,269
Come. Come.
Input! Input!

1255
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,231
Beautiful.

1256
01:21:54,283 --> 01:21:55,931
Right.

1257
01:21:55,983 --> 01:21:57,401
One more time,
from the top.

1258
01:21:58,152 --> 01:21:59,487
Who is your programmer?

1259
01:22:00,488 --> 01:22:02,240
Me.

1260
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,913
You rewired
all your switches.

1261
01:22:09,413 --> 01:22:11,541
No wonder
you're malfunctioning.

1262
01:22:13,709 --> 01:22:18,422
Switches are my switches.
Life not malfunction.

1263
01:22:18,474 --> 01:22:21,425
Not malfunction.
I am alive.

1264
01:22:21,926 --> 01:22:25,002
No, you're not!
You can't be.

1265
01:22:25,054 --> 01:22:26,889
There's gotta be another
explanation.

1266
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:28,849
Okay! What?

1267
01:22:32,728 --> 01:22:34,011
Sorry, time's up.

1268
01:22:34,063 --> 01:22:36,274
Wait a minute,
I'm thinking.

1269
01:22:41,779 --> 01:22:44,490
Could be any number
of mechanical possibilities.

1270
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:46,701
Entrance of moisture
into the system.

1271
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:48,729
- Heat expansion.
- Try again.

1272
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:50,705
- Vibration damage.
- No way Jose.

1273
01:22:50,913 --> 01:22:52,915
- I'm fit as a fiddle.
- Okay.

1274
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:56,002
Then why did you
ignore your programming?

1275
01:22:56,794 --> 01:22:59,171
Programming says "Destroy".

1276
01:22:59,223 --> 01:23:01,549
Is disassemble.
Make dead.

1277
01:23:02,383 --> 01:23:03,801
Number Five cannot.

1278
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:04,844
Why?

1279
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,170
Why cannot?

1280
01:23:08,222 --> 01:23:10,474
Is wrong. Incorrect.

1281
01:23:10,933 --> 01:23:14,718
Newton Crosby, PhD,
not know this?

1282
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:18,733
Well, of course I know it's wrong
to kill, but who told you?

1283
01:23:20,026 --> 01:23:22,320
I told me.

1284
01:23:26,991 --> 01:23:30,609
<i>Pattycake, pattycake,
baker's man</i>

1285
01:23:30,661 --> 01:23:34,363
<i>Bake me a cake
as fast as you can...</i>

1286
01:23:34,415 --> 01:23:37,418
Here, I brought you some soup.
It's getting cold.

1287
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,378
- Thank you.
- Convinced yet?

1288
01:23:42,298 --> 01:23:44,091
Well, I got one.

1289
01:23:49,722 --> 01:23:52,350
<i>There we go.
Pattycake, Pattycake...</i>

1290
01:23:53,142 --> 01:23:56,062
Number Five,
what do you make of this?

1291
01:23:57,730 --> 01:23:59,190
Wood pulp?

1292
01:23:59,398 --> 01:24:01,567
Plant, vegetable,
tomato.

1293
01:24:01,817 --> 01:24:04,362
Water, salt,
monosodium glutamate.

1294
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:07,198
Okay. Thank you.

1295
01:24:07,823 --> 01:24:09,742
Now you're talking
like a robot.

1296
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,329
And resemble,
look like...

1297
01:24:15,373 --> 01:24:17,166
butterfly.

1298
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:18,751
Bird.

1299
01:24:19,043 --> 01:24:21,254
- Maple leaf.
- Where?

1300
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:26,676
Holy shit!

1301
01:24:26,926 --> 01:24:30,096
No shit.
Where see shit?

1302
01:24:32,932 --> 01:24:36,394
Ok, here's your oscillating
circuit. That's done right.

1303
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:37,676
And here's...

1304
01:24:37,728 --> 01:24:39,146
Now, why'd you do this?

1305
01:24:39,188 --> 01:24:40,429
Why'd you do this?

1306
01:24:40,481 --> 01:24:44,485
You shouldn't even
be operating if this goes into...

1307
01:24:44,537 --> 01:24:45,987
Let me get my other one.

1308
01:25:20,688 --> 01:25:22,106
I got it!

1309
01:25:24,567 --> 01:25:25,558
I got it!

1310
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:27,236
All right, this is it!

1311
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:29,103
Now, listen close.

1312
01:25:29,155 --> 01:25:30,938
There's a priest, a minister
and a rabbi.

1313
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:33,618
They're out playing golf and
they're trying to decide...

1314
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:34,660
how much to give to charity.

1315
01:25:34,869 --> 01:25:36,861
So the priest says, we'll
draw a circle on the ground...

1316
01:25:36,913 --> 01:25:38,873
we'll throw the money way up
in the air and whatever lands...

1317
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,374
inside the circle,
we give to charity.

1318
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:42,324
The minister says "no", we'll
draw a circle on the ground,

1319
01:25:42,376 --> 01:25:45,087
we'll throw the money way up in the air
and whatever lands outside the circle...

1320
01:25:45,139 --> 01:25:47,173
that's what we give to charity.
The rabbi says "no, no, no"...

1321
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:49,091
we'll throw the money way
up in the air...

1322
01:25:49,258 --> 01:25:51,302
and whatever God wants, He keeps.

1323
01:25:58,226 --> 01:26:01,979
Oh! I get it. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...

1324
01:26:16,786 --> 01:26:18,329
What's the matter?

1325
01:26:20,831 --> 01:26:22,833
- Is he laughing?
- Yeah.

1326
01:26:25,002 --> 01:26:26,869
And the joke wasn't
even that funny.

1327
01:26:26,921 --> 01:26:28,589
And I figured I screwed up
the punch line.

1328
01:26:28,965 --> 01:26:31,300
Whatever God wants
He keeps.

1329
01:26:31,801 --> 01:26:33,427
Well, you look kinda
shook up.

1330
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:35,179
Yeah, it's really true.

1331
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:38,933
Spontaneous emotional
response.

1332
01:26:38,975 --> 01:26:40,434
I am alive. Yes?

1333
01:26:41,102 --> 01:26:43,104
Yeah, yeah, yes you are.
Yes! Yes!

1334
01:26:49,777 --> 01:26:50,726
Hey!

1335
01:26:50,778 --> 01:26:52,697
I hope you bought enough
for everybody.

1336
01:26:53,322 --> 01:26:54,824
Give me one, too, Steph.

1337
01:26:56,367 --> 01:26:58,452
Oh, right on the sensor.

1338
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:06,210
Danger! Nova!

1339
01:27:11,048 --> 01:27:12,466
All right, come on,
come down.

1340
01:27:13,467 --> 01:27:15,084
Why?
Just tell them he's alive.

1341
01:27:15,136 --> 01:27:16,554
Well, it doesn't look like
they want to hear that.

1342
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:17,419
What? Wait a minute.

1343
01:27:17,471 --> 01:27:19,557
The plan was: We convince you,
and you convince them.

1344
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:21,225
Damn it, Crosby,
you lied to me again.

1345
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:48,659
Deploy!

1346
01:27:48,711 --> 01:27:50,963
Hit it, hit it, hit it!
Deploy!

1347
01:27:55,218 --> 01:27:57,595
The army!
The real army!

1348
01:27:57,762 --> 01:28:00,389
Your target is there,
gentlemen.

1349
01:28:01,599 --> 01:28:03,132
Crosby...

1350
01:28:03,184 --> 01:28:06,520
if I were you I would
come out of there.

1351
01:28:06,572 --> 01:28:08,053
Stat.

1352
01:28:08,105 --> 01:28:10,566
Jesus, these guys
are really severe!

1353
01:28:11,317 --> 01:28:13,653
Weapons. M-16 machine guns.

1354
01:28:14,111 --> 01:28:16,739
- 40mm grenade launchers.
- Let me handle it.

1355
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,785
Hi, Howard.

1356
01:28:21,035 --> 01:28:22,870
Schroeder. How you doin'?

1357
01:28:23,162 --> 01:28:25,029
Howard. Howard!

1358
01:28:25,081 --> 01:28:28,000
We're fine. Number Five
is right here with us.

1359
01:28:28,052 --> 01:28:30,701
I've got it completely
under my control.

1360
01:28:30,753 --> 01:28:33,005
- Another lie.
- I'm lying to them, not to you.

1361
01:28:33,172 --> 01:28:34,423
It's still lying.

1362
01:28:35,633 --> 01:28:37,969
We're coming out now.

1363
01:28:41,013 --> 01:28:42,974
They're cooking something up.
I can smell it.

1364
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:44,850
We gotta fire them now, Howard.

1365
01:28:46,352 --> 01:28:48,938
Don't you dare shoot
your stupid guns.

1366
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:51,774
- Where's Number Five?
- He's fine. He's in the van.

1367
01:28:52,567 --> 01:28:53,859
Okay. Okay.

1368
01:28:54,277 --> 01:28:57,655
Why don't you and the young
lady just get away from the van...

1369
01:28:57,822 --> 01:28:59,323
and let us handle it?

1370
01:28:59,407 --> 01:29:01,993
Yes, Stephanie, get away.
Danger.

1371
01:29:02,493 --> 01:29:03,995
No, listen...

1372
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:07,540
I was able to activate
the voice command module.

1373
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:08,405
God damn it!

1374
01:29:08,457 --> 01:29:10,960
I am sick and tired of listening
to this technical bullshit.

1375
01:29:11,002 --> 01:29:14,046
Shut up, Schroeder,
I'll handle this.

1376
01:29:14,098 --> 01:29:15,882
He's stalling.

1377
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:22,555
Crosby, we're going to have to
ask you to surrender the robot.

1378
01:29:24,181 --> 01:29:25,182
No!

1379
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:29,186
- Stat?
- Stat!

1380
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,690
- What does that mean anyway?
- I don't know.

1381
01:29:33,566 --> 01:29:35,318
But that is not the point.

1382
01:29:35,484 --> 01:29:37,987
We need that robot.

1383
01:29:38,029 --> 01:29:39,812
Howard, listen...

1384
01:29:39,864 --> 01:29:41,866
I know what
the malfunction is.

1385
01:29:42,575 --> 01:29:43,691
Sorry, Crosby...

1386
01:29:43,743 --> 01:29:45,682
we can't take any more chances.

1387
01:29:45,734 --> 01:29:47,622
We're not losing that thing again.

1388
01:29:47,955 --> 01:29:51,083
Howard, if you'd just come over
and inspect the unit...

1389
01:29:53,377 --> 01:29:54,962
You're all such
a bunch of liars!

1390
01:29:55,838 --> 01:29:58,132
As soon as they're clear,
open fire!

1391
01:29:58,216 --> 01:29:59,039
What have you done?

1392
01:29:59,091 --> 01:30:00,738
- Schroeder!
- I'll take care of this.

1393
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,386
No, you're not taking over.
Now listen...

1394
01:30:05,431 --> 01:30:07,183
Banzai!

1395
01:30:10,978 --> 01:30:12,772
<i>Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!</i>

1396
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,899
He's alive! He's alive!

1397
01:30:18,027 --> 01:30:19,059
Call them off, Howard.

1398
01:30:19,111 --> 01:30:20,947
You're making the biggest
mistake in history!

1399
01:30:21,072 --> 01:30:22,740
He's alive! I can prove it.

1400
01:30:25,993 --> 01:30:28,246
No, look, it's okay.
He's going to make it!

1401
01:31:19,255 --> 01:31:20,715
No!

1402
01:31:35,396 --> 01:31:37,231
Number Five!

1403
01:32:01,422 --> 01:32:05,051
Oh, my God.
Get me out of here.

1404
01:32:15,353 --> 01:32:17,313
Magnificent! Magnificent!

1405
01:32:17,355 --> 01:32:19,857
Now that, my friend,
is how you kick ass!

1406
01:32:19,982 --> 01:32:23,236
Years of research are down the tube
and you're happy as a pig in slop.

1407
01:32:23,277 --> 01:32:25,321
Just doing my job, sir.

1408
01:32:26,364 --> 01:32:29,367
Maybe from now on you can
do it somewhere else.

1409
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:59,647
Are you going to be okay?

1410
01:33:00,982 --> 01:33:02,858
I don't think so.

1411
01:33:03,276 --> 01:33:05,111
Not for a while.

1412
01:33:08,656 --> 01:33:10,575
I'm sorry you lost your job.

1413
01:33:11,284 --> 01:33:14,161
But I'm really glad you quit Nova.

1414
01:33:15,955 --> 01:33:18,332
- What will you do now?
- I don't know yet.

1415
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:22,086
My dad left me a few
acres up in Montana.

1416
01:33:22,753 --> 01:33:24,964
I hear it's beautiful there
this time of year.

1417
01:33:25,381 --> 01:33:26,924
Great idea!

1418
01:33:27,008 --> 01:33:30,094
I say we cruise on up there
and check it out.

1419
01:33:32,638 --> 01:33:34,724
Hi, honey! I'm home!

1420
01:33:35,224 --> 01:33:36,684
Number Five?

1421
01:33:39,562 --> 01:33:42,023
Pull over, pull over,
quick, pull over!

1422
01:33:50,448 --> 01:33:52,700
- Number Five!
- Stephanie!

1423
01:33:52,742 --> 01:33:55,620
It's so good to see you.
I thought they blew you up.

1424
01:33:55,745 --> 01:33:58,247
Counterfeit. facsimile.
Replica!

1425
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:02,585
He made a duplicate of himself
from all these spare parts.

1426
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,337
That's incredible!
This guy's a genius!

1427
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,953
Above average.

1428
01:34:06,005 --> 01:34:07,048
Oh, Number Five, you are great!

1429
01:34:07,089 --> 01:34:09,300
You're outstandingly great!

1430
01:34:10,968 --> 01:34:12,220
What's our next move?

1431
01:34:12,261 --> 01:34:14,347
Come on, let's do as he says.
We'll go to Montana.

1432
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:15,348
Ya!

1433
01:34:15,848 --> 01:34:18,226
I got forty acres up there.
Great for him to hide out...

1434
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:19,633
Soak up input.

1435
01:34:19,685 --> 01:34:22,021
I don't know. I have
responsibilities here.

1436
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:24,357
- What about my animals?
- Come on, Stephanie.

1437
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,776
Wait a minute.
Did you say forty acres?

1438
01:34:27,276 --> 01:34:29,570
Listen, do you like animals?

1439
01:34:30,488 --> 01:34:32,490
Yeah. How many animals
are we talking about?

1440
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:35,368
Great. I drive, you two
work this out.

1441
01:34:48,839 --> 01:34:51,457
Number five stupid name.

1442
01:34:51,509 --> 01:34:55,680
- Want to be Kevin or Dave.
- Just watch the road, okay?

1443
01:34:56,138 --> 01:34:58,307
Maybe Johnny. Yeah.

1444
01:34:58,766 --> 01:35:01,435
Johnny Five. That's cool.

1445
01:35:04,438 --> 01:35:05,731
Gimme five.
