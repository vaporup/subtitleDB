00:28:44,995 --> 00:28:45,928
YES, SIR.

524
00:28:45,996 --> 00:28:47,429
THANK YOU.

525
00:28:47,497 --> 00:28:49,432
SORRY. I DIDN'T
CATCH YOUR NAME.

526
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,934
ME? UH, BARRY.

527
00:28:51,002 --> 00:28:52,435
BARRY THOMAS.

528
00:28:52,503 --> 00:28:55,438
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE
LUNCH WITH ME TODAY?

529
00:28:55,506 --> 00:28:58,575
I'M SURE YOU'RE NICE,
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

530
00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:00,611
I'LL MAKE IT
WORTH YOUR WHILE.

531
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,980
HOW'S THAT?

532
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:03,581
I'LL PAY FOR
YOUR LUNCH.

533
00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:05,950
I WON'T SPIT FOOD
IN YOUR FACE

534
00:29:06,018 --> 00:29:08,452
OR MAKE SILLY NOISES
WITH MY LIPS.

535
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,921
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

536
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:11,790
O.K.

537
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:13,392
THANK YOU.

538
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:14,760
Help!

539
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,665
I'M STRICTLY INTO THEORY.
NO GREASE STAINS.

540
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:22,301
THE PHYSICAL WORLD
IS JUST TOO DISAPPOINTING.

541
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:26,306
BUT TO USE YOUR MIND AND CREATE
THE THING-- THAT'S EXCITING.

542
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:29,776
THINGS DON'T ALWAYS
WORK OUT THE WAY YOU WANT.

543
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:32,512
YOU SHOULDN'T PICK UP MEN
AT LUNCH.

544
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,547
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY'VE BEEN.

545
00:29:34,615 --> 00:29:37,518
JOAN, BARRY. PLEASE EAT
SOMETHING. YOU'RE GETTING MEAN.

546
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:39,653
HE'S NOT WEARING
ANY RINGS.

547
00:29:39,722 --> 00:29:40,755
YOU ARE.

548
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:43,758
RELAX. HER SISTER
GAVE IT TO HER.

549
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:45,226
SHE'S AVAILABLE.

550
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:47,862
ASIDE FROM DINNER WITH ME
TONIGHT, HER SCHEDULE'S OPEN.

551
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,531
ON THAT SUBTLE,
PRIVATE NOTE...

552
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,034
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT DINNER.

553
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:55,537
JOAN WILL MURDER ME
IF I FLAKE OUT ON HER.

554
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:56,538
AGAIN.

555
00:29:56,606 --> 00:29:57,672
ONLY TWICE.

556
00:29:57,741 --> 00:30:00,443
NO. I MEAN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE

557
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,345
THAT DINNER TONIGHT.

558
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:03,747
WHY NOT?

559
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:04,814
[SIGHS]

560
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:08,952
THIS DAY IS REPEATING.

561
00:30:10,487 --> 00:30:12,957
THE TIME BOUNCE
HAS HAPPENED.

562
00:30:13,024 --> 00:30:14,892
RIGHT AFTER WORK
AT 6:15

563
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,862
YOU GO ACROSS THE STREET TO BUY FLOWERS,

564
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:19,363
AND YOU'RE...SHOT.

565
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,831
I'VE ALREADY
SEEN IT.

566
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:24,302
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE SAME
THINGS THEY SAID YESTERDAY.

567
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,304
THEY'RE <i>DOING</i>
THE SAME THINGS.

568
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:28,406
THE <i>NEWS</i> HAS
THE SAME STORY.

569
00:30:28,474 --> 00:30:31,409
IT'S <i>ALL</i> HAPPENING AGAIN THE SAME WAY.

570
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:33,311
PROVE IT.
POINT SOMETHING OUT.

571
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:34,679
O.K.

572
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:38,684
OH.
OH.

573
00:30:44,491 --> 00:30:45,658
AH-CHOO!

574
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:49,629
I HAVEN'T BEEN
PAYING ATTENTION.

575
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:53,667
I'LL MAKE IT EASIER.
WHAT DO I DO NEXT?

576
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:54,835
[BEEPER SOUNDS]

577
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:57,104
YOUR BEEPER GOES OFF, AND YOU LEAVE.

578
00:30:57,172 --> 00:30:58,738
I HOPE YOU'VE HAD FUN.

579
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:00,741
CALL ME WHEN YOU GROW UP.

580
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,743
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

581
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:04,813
YOU GET SHOT TWO TIMES.

582
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:28,905
UH, CAN I HELP YOU?

583
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:31,908
UH, PERSONNEL. GOING TO SEE DR. MOXLEY.

584
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:33,476
HE'S EXPECTING ME.

585
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:37,448
O.K. FINE.
GO AHEAD.

586
00:31:56,903 --> 00:32:01,040
[LISA] LOOKS LIKE IT'S
CONTAINED. JUST IN THAT ONE SEAL.

587
00:32:01,108 --> 00:32:03,542
[DR. MOXLEY]
JUST ONE SEAL...

588
00:32:07,014 --> 00:32:10,950
[LISA] THIS MEANS WE CAN'T
SHUT THE ACCELERATOR DOWN TODAY.

589
00:32:11,018 --> 00:32:12,386
[DENK]
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

590
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,889
THE ACCELERATOR HAS
TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL

591
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:16,390
UNTIL THIS IS
UNDER CONTROL.

592
00:32:16,457 --> 00:32:18,392
IF ONE MORE SEAL
HAD BROKEN,

593
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,895
WE WOULD HAVE IRRADIATED
THE ENTIRE LAB.

594
00:32:20,962 --> 00:32:22,829
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED.

595
00:32:22,898 --> 00:32:24,332
IT'S A TERRIBLE
EMBARRASSMENT.

596
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,901
WE TELL HIM IT'S SAFE,

597
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:29,004
AND NOW WE CAN'T DISMANTLE
THE CORE FOR TWO WEEKS.

598
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:30,571
I' GET
A CLEANUP CREW.

599
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:33,741
I'M SORRY, THADIUS.

600
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:36,745
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
LISA.

601
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:39,048
FOR 40 YEARS
SOMETHING'S GONE WRONG

602
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:41,517
WITH EVERY PROJECT
I'VE WORKED ON.

603
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,287
WELL, YOU'RE BOUND
FOR A CHANGE, THEN.

604
00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:46,255
MAYBE THE NEXT PROJECT
WILL HIT.

605
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:48,758
THIS IS THE LAST PROJECT I'LL SUPERVISE.

606
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:51,761
THE WAY THE PRESS
IS HANDLING THIS...

607
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:54,264
I CAN'T TAKE ANY
FURTHER DISAPPOINTMENTS.

608
00:32:54,332 --> 00:32:56,400
YOU CHECK
THE OTHER SEALS.

609
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:58,835
NO CLEANUP
UNTIL 10 A.M. TOMORROW.

610
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:01,306
I'LL CHECK THOSE OTHER
SEALS AND STRUCTURES.

611
00:33:01,373 --> 00:33:03,808
I'LL EXAMINE THEM. I'LL
DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENED.

612
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:04,809
SHE'LL DO IT.

613
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:06,311
THADIUS,
IT'S MY JOB.

614
00:33:06,378 --> 00:33:07,812
ONE MORE SEAL BREAKS,

615
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:10,815
WE'LL BE READING AT NIGHT
BY OUR OWN GLOW.

616
00:33:10,882 --> 00:33:12,283
THIS IS MY DEPARTMENT.

617
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:14,753
I WANT HER
TO DO IT!

618
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:17,256
I'VE BEEN WITH THIS PROJECT
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

619
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,258
YOU'VE CAUSED
ENOUGH PROBLEMS.

620
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:21,760
HOW DID YOU
GET IN HERE?

621
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:24,296
I WANT SECURITY
DOWN HERE IMMEDIATELY.

622
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:29,602
TAKE THOSE FILES
TO LEVEL THREE.

623
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,106
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO MR. STEVENS BY 4:00.

624
00:33:33,174 --> 00:33:35,842
GET ME SOME COFFEE,
SOME FRESH...COFFEE.

625
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:37,078
SURPRISE.

626
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:38,879
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH.

627
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:43,050
YOU TRESPASS INTO THE
HIGHEST LEVEL SECURITY AREA.

628
00:33:43,118 --> 00:33:46,053
YOU ACCOST THREE
HEADS OF THE PROJECT,

629
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:48,556
AND I'M SUPPOSED
TO EXPLAIN IT.

630
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:51,559
I LIKE YOU, BARRY.
I REALLY DO.

631
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:52,861
YOU'RE FIRED.

632
00:33:52,928 --> 00:33:56,264
GIVE ME YOUR I.D. AND
CLEAN OUT YOUR OFFICE

633
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:58,266
BY THE END OF TODAY.

634
00:33:58,334 --> 00:33:59,767
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

635
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:01,770
IF TODAY
WAS REALLY TODAY,

636
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:04,207
I WOULD HAVE QUIT
BY NOW.

637
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,044
HEY, SORRY, MAN.

638
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,046
YEAH, WELL,
STUFF HAPPENS.

639
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,981
WHAT'S UP?
THEY FIRE YOU?

640
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:15,486
WILL YOU BELIEVE ME
IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING

641
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,987
THAT SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE?

642
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,222
WELL, YEAH.

643
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,957
LISA FREDERICKS WILL
BE MURDERED AT 6:15.

644
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,959
THIS WHOLE DAY
IS REPEATING.

645
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,962
WE'RE IN A TIME BOUNCE.

646
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:26,398
DID YOU TELL ANYONE?

647
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:27,432
YES.

648
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,634
THAT'S WHY
THEY FIRED YOU.

649
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:33,138
YOU'RE STRESSED OUT. YOU
HAVE DEJA VU OR VERTIGO.

650
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:36,642
THERE HAVE LAWS AGAINST
THIS. THEY CAN'T FIRE YOU.

651
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,244
HOWARD...UP YOURS.

652
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,151
SORRY, MAN.

653
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:52,292
DR. FREDERICKS, PLEASE.

654
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,929
WILL YOU HAVE HER CALL
BARRY THOMAS, EXTENSION 322?

655
00:34:55,996 --> 00:34:57,531
IT'S URGENT.

656
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,573
LISA!

657
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
LISA!

658
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:09,677
YOUR I.D., SIR.

659
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:11,212
I...

660
00:35:13,749 --> 00:35:17,652
SIR, I CAN'T LET YOU
IN THERE WITHOUT I.D.

661
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:25,061
HI, REYNALDO.

662
00:35:25,129 --> 00:35:26,496
AH, SEÑORITA.

663
00:35:26,564 --> 00:35:27,497
<i>¿COMO ESTA?</i>

664
00:35:27,565 --> 00:35:29,899
GOOD.
DO YOU HAVE MY ROSES?

665
00:35:32,636 --> 00:35:35,771
HOLD IT. WHAT'S UP?
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

666
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:39,243
TALK TO ME.

667
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:40,444
LISA!

668
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,447
GET DOWN!

669
00:35:50,256 --> 00:35:52,690
OH, THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

670
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:56,194
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

671
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:01,501
UH...I GUESS I...

672
00:36:01,568 --> 00:36:04,504
I CAME OUT BEFORE BARRY
WHEN I HEARD THE SHOOTING--

673
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:06,506
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
BARRY THOMAS?

674
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:08,007
DO YOU
BELIEVE ME NOW?

675
00:36:08,074 --> 00:36:11,010
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME ALONG
TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.

676
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:12,946
HE ALREADY
GAVE A STATEMENT.

677
00:36:13,014 --> 00:36:15,449
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

678
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:16,950
HE CALLED ME
THIS MORNING

679
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:18,952
TO TELL ME
ABOUT HER MURDER.

680
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,421
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO JAIL, TOO?

681
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:10,007
[THUNDER]

682
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:18,950
THIS DAY'S
ABOUT TO REPEAT.

683
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:21,953
NO KIDDING. THEY'RE ALL
ABOUT THE SAME AROUND HERE.

684
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:25,958
OH, MY GOD.
BUT WHAT IF IT DOESN'T?

685
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:27,460
I WANT ANOTHER CHANCE!

686
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:30,796
NO MORE CHANCES, MAN.
YOU'RE DOING TIME NOW.

687
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:50,985
<i>THE TIME IS 7:35.</i>

688
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,424
O.K.

689
00:37:56,492 --> 00:37:58,493
TODAY I SAVE HER.

690
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,098
WELL, LOOK WHO DECIDED
TO SHOW UP.

691
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:07,035
YOU'RE RIGHT. IF I WANTED
TO BE ON TIME, I WOULD.

692
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:10,038
I'LL FINISH THE PERSONNEL REPORTS,
COMPLETE THE MONTHLY BILLING,

693
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:12,308
AND CLEAN OFF MY DESK
BY QUITTING TIME.

694
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:15,812
YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT
<i>OR</i> BE MY FRIEND.

695
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,750
SO WHY KICK ME OUT
WHEN I'M SO DAMN CUTE?

696

ISN'T IT BETTER TO DISCUSS
HOW WONDERFUL THEORY IS
