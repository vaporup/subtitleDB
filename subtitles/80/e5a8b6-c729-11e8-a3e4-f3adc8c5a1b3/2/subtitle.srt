we can hope they were
thoughts of penitence.

to forgive
the self-indulgence...

that aggravated her illness
and caused her death...

to reexamine our own lives.

We can resist those...

447
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,307
who would lead us
into temptation.

First thing in the morning.

Is it because of Armande?

00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,499
That was not your fault.

I could be better?

I have to pack now.

470

If you leave,
everything will go back...

to the way it always was.

472
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,462
It is the way it always was.

473
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,050
Not for me.

REYNAUD: Beg your pardon?

476
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:32,023
I suppose it can't be easy...

477
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,817
having her gone.

478
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,823
Can't seem to get used to it,
no matter how much time.

479
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:49,332
Ahem. But I...
look forward to her return.

480
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:57,006

would think less of you...

she was never coming back.

Monsieur le Comte.

490
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,761
It's all right.

491
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:49,225
Sorry to bother you,
Monsieur le Comte.

492
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,143
REYNAUD: All right.

493
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,149
It was the right thing to do,
wasn't it?

494
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,278
SERGE: Of course it was.
I know it was.

495

497
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,910
What are you talking about?

498
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,119
SERGE: The fire,
Monsieur le Comte.

499
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,121
I know it was
the right thing to do...

500
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:15,627
but I can't get rid of
the faces and the screams.

501
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,086
The fire...

502
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,424
The fire was an act of God.

503
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,053
It was me, Monsieur le Comte.

504

[Sighs] What?

505
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:34,145
You told me. Remember?

506
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,941
SERGE: "Something
has to be done, Serge."

507
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,320
You did, didn't you?

508
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,373
People could have died.

509
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,959
REYNAUD: You want
their blood on your hands?

510
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,670
On--on my hands?

511
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:03,007
Should I go to Pere Henri
and ask for forgiveness?

512
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,844
Listen to me, Serge.

513
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,889
Listen very carefully.

514
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,935
REYNAUD: You must leave
this village at once...

515
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,981
and never return.

516
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:21,234
Why would I leave
my home and my cafe?

517
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,361
Because I'm evicting you,
that's why!

518
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,948
What you have done
puts you beyond anyone's help...

beyond my help, anybody's help!

520
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,327
Now get out!

521
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,037
Unless you will tell the police
what you've done!

522
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,540
REYNAUD:
Get out! Get out! Get out!

523
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,628
Oh.

524
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,714
Oh.

Hmm?

529
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,273
Oh, no.

530
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:01,232
I'm not going.

531
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,067
Well, it's hard for me, too.

532
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,360
Pantoufle hates this.

533
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,278
VIANNE: Stop that.

534
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,404
Please put it on.

535
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,947
I hate you.

536
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,535
You're entitled.
I said put it on.

537
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,165
Ouch!

538
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,458
Well, then, do it your self!

539
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,459
I can't!

540
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,210
Get up.

541
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,379
I have a bad leg like Pantoufle.

542
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,631
Stop that. Get up.

543
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,884
ANOUK: Pantoufle can't walk.
I can't walk.

544
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,093
Walk. Walk!

545
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,969
You're hurting me.

546
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,471
