1
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,312
Soon it will be spring again.

2
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,669
Grass sprouting.

3
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,435
Then comes summer,

4
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,430
tall grass,

5
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,629
sun.

6
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,558
Then comes autumn,

7
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,191
leaves falling.

8
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,118
And then...

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,639
winter.

10
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,871
Spring.

11
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,595
Summer.

12
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,195
Autumn.

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,194
Winter!

14
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,872
There are situations, of course,

15
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,230
that leave you utterly speechless.

16
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,519
All you can do is hint at things.

17
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,957
Words, too, can't do more

18
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,588
than just evoke things.

19
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,189
That's where dance comes in again.

20
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,874
Pina was a painter.

21
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,391
She consistently questioned us.

22
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,917
That's how we became the paint,

23
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,632
to colour her images.

24
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,830
For example she'd ask for

25
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,757
"the moon"?

26
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,995
I depicted the word with my body

27
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,669
so that she could see and feel it.

28
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,078
I danced in Café Müller myself.

29
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,749
We all have our eyes closed.

30
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,678
When we did a reprise,

31
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,518
I couldn't get the feeling back,

32
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,553
a feeling that mattered so much to me.

33
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,194
All of a sudden I noticed

34
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,071
that it makes a big difference,

35
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,279
behind closed eyelids,

36
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,875
whether I look down, or like this.

37
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,480
That made all the difference!

38
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,796
The right feeling
was there immediately.

39
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,351
Unbelievable how crucial that is.

40
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,155
The tiniest detail matters.

41
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,997
It's all a language

42
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,031
that you can learn to read.

43
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,157
We developed the piece

44
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,758
in two weeks, Dominique!

45
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,234
The speed was unbelievable!

46
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,033
Amazing how the idea materialised

47
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,631
from just a table and four chairs.

48
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,875
Typical Pina! I remember.

49
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,389
- Then, bang, chairs!
- Exactly.

50
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,638
Then, bang!
Rolf played with the chairs,

51
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,638
and they became integral to the piece.

52
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,035
So beautiful!

53
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,951
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I'm coming!

54
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,835
Kazuo Ohno also left us

55
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,279
not too long ago.

56
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,550
I imagine him and Pina up there

57
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,556
dancing together...

58
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,989
leaping from one cloud to another.

59
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,515
Pina had the most penetrating eyes!

60
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,878
No one has ever read me that way.

61
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,513
Everything I tried or pretended to be

62
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,313
disappeared under her gaze.

63
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,669
Instead, she saw something

64
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,711
I was afraid of

65
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,399
because I didn't know it yet.

66
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,998
Who was Pina?

67
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,677
She combined
fragility and strength.

68
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,276
She was also capable of

69
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,595
endlessly listening and watching,

70
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,791
and overcoming all her limits.

71
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,990
So I imagine her like a house

72
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,635
with a huge attic full of treasures.

73
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,148
Pina wasn't going to dance.

74
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,509
You always forgot your moves.

75
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,199
We refused to do it without her!

76
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,358
She got involved because you insisted...

77
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,789
That she showed me the moves?
Come off it!

78
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,512
But it's true!

79
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,920
I insisted that she danced.

80
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,758
That was the only way for people
to see her on stage!

81
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,880
I never wanted
to dance Cafe Müller.

82
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,508
When Pina asked me to dance her part

83
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,798
I said yes.

84
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,876
But I never really learned it.

85
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,274
I wanted her to dance forever.

86
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,560
I saw her do Cafe Müller so often.

87
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,439
I wanted to sense what she was feeling.

88
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,356
She moved as if she had
a hole in her tummy,

89
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,997
as if she'd risen from the dead.

90
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,112
When I'm on stage today,

91
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,991
I try to imagine Pina

92
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,996
in her pain,

93
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,031
but also in her strength

94
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,991
and her loneliness.

95
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,239
How often

96
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,556
did I dance
Café Müller with Pina,

97
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,559
and see her hair, back, arms,

98
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,111
knew, with my eyes shut,

99
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,277
that she was aware of us all!

100
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,912
She saw everything,

101
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,871
even with closed eyes!

102
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,669
We danced and laughed all the time.

103
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,073
We were always together

104
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,190
until four in the morning

105
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,073
to devise something for the next day.

106
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,429
That was at the beginning of the company.

107
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,917
We'd meet at Barmen station

108
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,393
every morning

109
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,078
for coffee and a roll

110
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,076
and go over the day's work.

111
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,274
You always felt more than just human

112
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,311
working with Pina.

113
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,759
It was good

114
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,553
being an older dancer with Pina!

115
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,910
Well, the younger years were good, too.

116
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,439
I was 24 when I came to Wuppertal.

117
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,472
But at 40, more and more,

118
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,752
I thought, "All this space,
all these opportunities!"

119
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,598
Pina's eyes turn everything we do

120
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,235
into something even more beautiful.

121
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,792
To be old and a child at the same time.

122
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,759
After an awful rehearsal of Iphigenia

123
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,951
Pina didn't say a word to me.

124
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,719
Before the performance,

125
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,150
she came and said as usual,
"Lützchen, be good!"

126
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,191
And I replied as always,

127
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,071
"Pinchen, enjoy it!"

128
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,317
She left, turned at the door, and said,

129
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,397
"Don't forget,
you have to scare me!"

130
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,396
Right away my head started to spin.

131
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,671
That was more to the point
than talking for hours.

132
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,839
New in the company, I didn't yet grasp

133
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,393
how Pina worked.

134
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,873
And she didn't explain it.

135
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,679
I was lost.

136
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,992
Until I realised

137
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,918
I had to pull myself up by my own hair.

138
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,915
This is veal!

139
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,478
What is honesty?

140
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,317
What's our responsibility

141
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,874
even when we dance?

142
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,916
Pina taught us to stand for what we do,

143
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,996
for every gesture,

144
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,235
every step and every move.

145
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,399
Pina always wanted to bring out

146
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,908
the best in all her dancers.

147
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,713
Once she told me,

148
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,036
"Your fragility is also your strength!"

149
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,275
For Full Moon

150
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,233
she requested a gesture related to "joy"

151
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,037
or to the pleasure of moving.

152
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,433
The question really inspired me.

153
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,598
From the movement I presented,

154
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,154
she created an entire scene.

155
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,592
I was always in a corner

156
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,949
or hiding behind someone,

157
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,911
when she was giving corrections.

158
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,316
Perhaps because
I respected her so much.

159
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,396
Once she caught me.

160
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,795
She asked me with a sad voice,

161
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,513
"Ditta, why are you so afraid of me?"

162
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,357
"I didn't do anything."

163
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,958
She was right.

164
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,470
And I gradually lost my shyness.

165
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,075
Sometimes she said things like,

166
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,872
"Go on searching!"

167
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,956
But that was all she said.

168
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,309
It meant you had to keep searching

169
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,078
without knowing where to look,

170
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,271
nor whether you were on the right track.

171
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,270
Pina, I still haven't
dreamed about you!

172
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,350
Please visit me in my dreams.

173
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,913
I got news from Daphnis,

174
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,678
who dreams of you all the time.

175
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,438
It's not the same.

176
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:50,153
It would be nice if you showed up!

177
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,191
I'm waiting for you, Pina.

178
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,711
Pina left us so quickly,

179
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,318
so surprisingly.

180
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,515
I think that in the end

181
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,994
she left everything behind

182
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,518
and was free.

183
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,709
That's why I wanted to give her

184
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,958
this moment of lightness,

185
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,797
this feeling of weightlessness.

186
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,275
As the daughter of
Dominique and Malou

187
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,118
I was the first child in the company.

188
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,958
I grew up inside the Tanztheater.

189
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,757
Life without Pina?

190
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,677
I just don't know what it is.

191
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:31,551
When I was new in Wuppertal

192
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,512
and confused about a few things,

193
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,516
she simply said...

194
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,279
For Pina,

195
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,470
the elements were very important.

196
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,159
Whether sand or soil,

197
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,395
stones or water...

198
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,955
Somehow, even icebergs
and rocks appeared on stage.

199
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,639
When we dance, they become...

200
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,033
obstacles.

201
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,834
You have to go
against or through them,

202
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,871
or climb over them...

203
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:28,360
Pina was a radical explorer.

204
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,039
She looked deep into our souls.

205
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:34,629
There was one particular subject
she kept asking us about:

206
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:37,035
What are we longing for?

207
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:40,356
Where does all this
yearning come from?
