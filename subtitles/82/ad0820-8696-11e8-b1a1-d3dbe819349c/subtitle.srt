Motherfucker!

12
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,000
Chop him up
and feed him to the pigs.

13
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,639
How will you pull it off?

14
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,481
I've got an idea.

15
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,982
What if you get busted?

16
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:12,087
I'm counting on you, Tae-ho.

17
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,228
If you screw up...

18
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,561
Got it?

19
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,230
His name is Park Tae-ho.

20
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,142
A right-hand man of Gang Yong-gu,
one of Kunsa's drug distributors.

21
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:29,579
He's moving abroad soon.

22
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:35,152
He never runs the light.

23
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,954
He participates
in all the civil defense drills.

24
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:49,164
He never misses
the residents meetings.

25
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,969
Who are you?

26
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,844
I'm D.A. Choi Doo-chil.

27
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,784
Put me on the case.

28
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,591
At 03:30 in April 28th, 1980

29
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,392
A drug cartel called 'Dinosaurs'
was exposed to the world.

30
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,872
So was Gang Yong-gu.

31
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:58,969
An officer got killed on the job.

32
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,767
He was my father.

33
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,171
He made me an orphan,
and he's got to pay for it.

34
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:15,454
Give me the case
and I'll bring his ass down.

35
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,763
You sure?

36
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:32,799
It's my dad's memorial day today,
and he's going down.

37
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,937
We've got to bust him
before he gets on the plane.

38
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,605
Move out!
The operation name is 2424!

39
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,914
Give me some ideas.

40
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:33,555
I heard the mafia puts them
in the asshole.

41
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,200
Yeah, I heard that, too.

42
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:43,103
They carry grenades in the asshole
for an unexpected war.

43
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:48,237
- Wow, grenades!
- They take them out, and...

44
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,312
Put it in your asshole.

45
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,482
Go ahead.

46
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,583
You're joking, aren't you?

47
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:11,366
Come on, put it in your asshole!

48
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,504
- Hold him down!
- Okay.

49
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,673
No!

50
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,306
Watch it!

51
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,045
Jerk it in!

52
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,845
Don't squeeze it!

53
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:38,129
You should feel honored, man.

54
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,684
It's a lot smaller than a grenade.

55
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,685
I guess they've got bigger assholes.

56
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,590
They ain't the Mob for nothing.

57
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,849
What about eating it?

58
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,827
Hide them in the stomach?
That's good!

59
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,398
- Anybody can do that.
- Right!

60
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,236
You eat it.

61
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,442
What?

62
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,405
Try this one first.

63
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:38,354
- Come on!
- Hold his neck.

64
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:55,030
Hide them
in the jar of pepper paste?

65
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,934
I've never thought of that!

66
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:04,781
And your head is a lot bigger, huh?

67
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,335
- What time are movers coming?
- Should be here in no time.

68
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,531
I should get ready then.

69
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,104
- Tae-ho.
- Yes?

70
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,873
- Can I have some tea?
- Sure.

71
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,945
Come on.

72
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,482
Not you.

73
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,192
It tastes better when you make it.

74
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,047
Tae-ho.

75
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,011
We're really moving
abroad together?

76
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:20,387
Of course!
I'm a man of my words, girl.

77
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,455
No kidding!

78
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,824
I've already reserved plane tickets.

79
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,266
What do you want to do there?

80
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,136
Let's have a baby first.

81
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:46,084
You're my prince charming, Tae-ho.

82
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:53,390
- You're like a sex machine.
- Yeah, baby!

83
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,271
Good evening, boss.

84
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,473
Who's that bitch?
She's hot.

85
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,611
Is she yours?

86
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,581
No, I've never seen her before.

87
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:21,749
I can tell by looking into her eyes.

88
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,323
She's a horny girl.

89
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:33,223
That's right!
I called her in for you, boss.

90
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,430
You did?

91
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,594
You always look after me.

92
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,569
That's why I like you.

93
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,180
Pour me a shot.

94
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,374
Tae-ho!

95
00:10:55,988 --> 00:11:00,152
Do I know you?
How did you know my name?

96
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,095
She must be high or something.

97
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:09,268
I'll leave you two alone, sir.

98
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,236
Okay.

99
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,209
Your skin is as soft as silk.

100
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,326
- Oh, you're here.
- Hi.

101
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,730
You've got a lot of stuff.

102
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:55,906
Our first motto, we carry the
hearts of our customers.

103
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,945
We do!

104
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:04,289
Another motto, we protect boxes
like we do our bodies.

105
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,118
We surely do!

106
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:13,355
And our last motto, we carry
dreams and hopes of our customers.

107
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,492
- We do!
- Let's get started.

108
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:26,136
This is it, boys.
Let's go!

109
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,835
Are you the one I talked to?

110
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,276
Oh, I am...

111
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,682
Let me carry that for you.

112
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,653
What a great place!

113
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:16,189
That was just an assessor.
This is our manager.

114
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,627
I'll make sure nothing goes wrong.

115
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,363
- Hurry, please.
- Sure.

116
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,871
- One more thing.
- Yes?

117
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,774
Uninstalling air-conditioner is free,
right?

118
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,038
Yes, of course!

119
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:48,551
- You know how to do it?
- Well...

120
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,786
Cut the chitchat, will you?

121
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:59,762
I think it would be wise of you to
call an expert for that.

122
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:16,043
Why don't you do it yourself?
I'll double your pay.

123
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,548
Yes, sir.

124
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,734
It's over there.

125
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,604
It hurts like hell, man.

126
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:19,543
I almost threw up.
He's fucking out of his mind.

127
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:16,572
We always separate paintings
from the frames.

128
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:47,333
Mom? Yeah, I'm kind of busy.

129
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,042
Yeah, I did. How about you?

130
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,474
Fuck!

131
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:55,128
Dectec... Dokgo!

132
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,901
Give me a hand here.

133
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:11,642
I'm doing this for the country.
So, help me out.

134
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,198
What are you doing?

135
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:45,706
Principle 1 of movers,
Never take what's not yours!

136
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,114
You think it's funny?

137
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:57,224
Don't forget you're on probation.
You don't want to mess up.

138
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:04,796
- I'll buy you some later.
- Okay.

139
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,470
Come on, back to work.

140
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,828
What have you found?

141
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:33,890
Nothing.

142
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,491
What are you doing?

143
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:46,168
Got a pair of socks to spare?

144
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,892
Is this the last one?

145
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,137
What's this?

146
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,809
We've got a ladder truck coming.
Have them move their cars.

147
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:24,845
- They want you to move the car.
- Tell them to wait.

148
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:36,091
- Why should I?
- I'm trying to study here!

149
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,523
What's the problem?

150
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,267
What are you doing down there?

151
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,873
What?

152
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,509
Don't you have a job to do?

153
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,612
What? I can't hear you!

154
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,582
Did you hear what he said?

155
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:17,526
Are we moving anytime today?

156
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:24,108
We've got a parking problem here.

157
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,436
I see.

158
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:36,677
Boys, help them move the cars.

159
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,049
Let's go.

160
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,555
Who is it?

161
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,720
- Move the car, please.
- I can't now.

162
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,361
- Come on, move it.
- No way!

163
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,933
Why the hell not?

164
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:05,075
Hey, get over here.
She says she won't move the car.

165
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,379
What a bitch!

166
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,820
Honey, move the car now!

167
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:26,262
I'm a Sunday driver.
Can you do it for me?

168
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,973
You bet.

169
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,330
Park Tae-ho is on the phone.

170
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,233
Trace the call.

171
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:06,236
Don't worry about a thing, boss.
I'll be over within the hour.

172
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,369
- Let me tell you...
- Hello?

173
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,282
What's up with the phone?

174
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,386
I told the phone company
to disconnect it.

175
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,999
We've got nothing so far.
Okay, sir.

176
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,902
He didn't stay on the phone

177
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,137
for more than 10 seconds.

178
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,849
We can't afford to let him walk!

179
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:52,549
10 minutes of a chicken torture
will make him talk.

180
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:58,661
Put electric wires on his ears,
fingers, toes, and his dick.

181
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:03,158
Give him a little electric shock,
and he'll talk.

182
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,061
No way.
We've got nothing on him.

183
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,173
We can't find anything here.

184
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,535
Let's finish up here and move
to the 2nd post.

185
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,542
- You don't trust my instincts?
- No.

186
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,581
We're running out of time.

187
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,387
Okay, let's hurry packing up
and move to the 2nd post.

188
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,951
God!

189
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,138
Aren't they from Hanjin Express?

190
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,406
What the...!

191
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,043
Hey, Hanjin!

192
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:04,255
You threw milk earlier, didn't you?
Move the truck, fuckface.

193
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,358
Never seen him before.

194
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,960
What milk?
Who the fuck are you?

195
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:17,902
Can't you see?
We're movers like yourself!

196
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:24,880
What is this?
And watch your mouth!

197
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,052
Beat it, kids.

198
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,381
Or what?

199
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,695
Should I arrest them?

200
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:43,666
We don't have time for this.
Move the boxes.

201
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,771
What are you, clowns?

202
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,103
You don't listen, do you?

203
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,512
Some beatings will make you
get out of here?

204
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,609
My name is Han Ik-soo.
Don't mess with me.

205
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,251
Tell your manager!

206
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:10,484
- Did you just hit me?
- Are you out of your minds?!

207
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:14,054
You want it, too?

208
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,330
Move your truck.

209
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,560
- What do you think you're doing?
- Who the fuck are you?

210
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,435
We were working our asses off,
and they started beating us.

211
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,407
What'd to do to them?

212
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,180
Sons of bitches!

213
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,848
What a bunch of losers!

214
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,096
You're dead meat, fuckers.

215
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,856
- Let's rock and roll!
- Yeah!

216
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:35,146
I'm in a great mood today.
So, don't make me hurt you boys.

217
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,677
Fuck!

218
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,451
Let's go.

219
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,082
Are you okay?

220
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,690
He's bluffing, you know.

221
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,824
He's nothing but a suit.
No match for you.

222
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,459
It's our 1st day in the business.
Don't mind them.

223
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,822
Fuckers!

224
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,564
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

225
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:07,266
Get me a carton of cigarettes.

226
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:08,971
Huh?

227
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,840
Don't tell me you don't know
what cigarettes are.

228
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,989
- It's okay. Keep the change.
- Okay.

229
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,296
What's up with his eyebrow?

230
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,386
You wait here,
I have something to do

231
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:03,466
Jars are made by the most famous
potter in Korea.

232
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:08,403
If you buy our soybean paste,
you get the jar for free.

233
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,286
Who are you?

234
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,735
It's so upsetting!

235
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,673
What?

236
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:48,276
I leave the company, and they
hire a beautiful girl like you?

237
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,248
Give it here.

238
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:25,310
These expensive goods require
a special packaging...

239
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,178
I see.

240
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,618
Hold on.

241
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:53,370
You don't only box up things,
but also the customers' hearts.

242
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:43,350
Honey, isn't that our truck?
What are they doing?

243
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,555
Stop the car.

244
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,972
Don't you have a job to do?

245
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,839
God!

246
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:07,347
- No place to park the truck.
- What?

247
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,149
They give out jars for free.

248
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,155
That old man...

249
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,621
He died in our neighborhood
last week.

250
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,666
Hey, you're here.

251
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,467
Why aren't you working?

252
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:30,535
They haven't moved out yet.

253
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,976
Go ahead. We'll be right up.

254
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,307
Ik-soo Express, hello?

255
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,313
Where the hell are you?

256
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:45,249
We're waiting for the ladder truck.

257
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,723
What?

258
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,528
Hello?

259
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,993
Yes?

260
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,065
You... Gwang-ja?

261
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,810
Young-joo?

262
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,712
Young-joo!

263
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,675
- It's been 10 years.
- Right.

264
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,918
You got your nose job done?

265
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,526
I didn't recognize you at first.

266
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,456
- You're married.
- How did you know?

267
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:32,692
Your ass is kind of saggy.

268
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:40,134
Raising kids fucked up my body.
You look so great.

269
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,969
I'm moving abroad today.

270
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,350
- Really?
- Yeah.

271
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,209
Good for you!
Your dream has come true!

272
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:54,848
Where? USA?
Australia?

273
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,187
Brazil.

274
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,225
Brazil?

275
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,326
Isn't it too hot there?

276
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,138
A little bit, I hear.

277
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,872
Yu-mi!

278
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:27,351
Your husband?

279
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,057
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

280
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:41,470
I hear you're moving to Brazil.
Take a good care of her.

281
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,699
What?

282
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,734
Is that your real name, Gwang-ja?

283
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,440
Who the hell is that?

284
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,341
Excuse me.

285
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,353
Give me a buzz.

286
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,459
Here's your change.

287
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,689
Who is it?

288
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,653
Cigarettes.

289
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,419
I got your cigarettes.

290
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,356
Here you go.

291
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,491
He only smokes Salem.

292
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,299
Can't you smoke these?

293
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:04,151
These are too strong for him.
And smell yucky.

294
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:08,449
Salem...!

295
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,256
Dig it?

296
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:18,264
Go trade them in for Salem.

297
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,530
Okay. I'll get you Salem.

298
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,445
dad!

299
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:02,375
I can't believe I'm moving into
the apartment you lived in!

300
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,538
Tell me about it.

301
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,417
- Send me a postcard.
- You bet.

302
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,291
Take care, girl.

303
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,921
- Where's your husband?
- At the airport.

304
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,388
Bye.

305
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,926
Be well!

306
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,174
Wait! Wait!

307
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,910
What a fool.

308
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:52,492
Are we moving anytime today?

309
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,962
They're already gone!

310
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,259
We're right on it, Ma'am!

311
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,598
You guys go ahead.

312
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,613
It's you again!

313
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,192
Is this a karma or what?

314
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,757
We keep running into each other.

315
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,971
- Leaving now?
- Right.

316
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,366
How sad!

317
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,578
Hey, hang on a second.

318
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,321
Give me a call!

319
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:03,928
Criminal psychology comes in handy
in understanding criminals.

320
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,869
I didn't just run an errand
for nothing.

321
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,837
I found out that Park Tae-ho
only smokes Salem.

322
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,837
...which is a great discovery.

323
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,843
- Let us use your ladder truck.
- Get up now!

324
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,875
- We've got no business with you.
- We need a ladder truck!

325
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,454
What a nutcase!

326
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:25,884
- Nutcase?
- Out of the way!

327
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,151
Hell no!

328
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,952
I'm not fucking moving!

329
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:36,926
Let me give you some advice
as your superior.

330
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,834
Stay away from that asshole.

331
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,565
Why?

332
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,905
He's a criminal type.

333
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,803
You don't think you are?

334
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:55,213
This is why you're so green.
Didn't you see what he did?

335
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:58,116
Nobody does this any more.

336
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,648
Funny, huh?

337
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,089
What happened?

338
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:03,356
What?

339
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,426
Your eyebrow.

340
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,029
This is just...

341
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,567
You look like a criminal.

342
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,604
You have a crunch on me?

343
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,976
He only smokes Salem!

344
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,679
Wagon 1, where are you?

345
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,453
Shut the fuck up!

346
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:49,136
Okay, here we go.
This is our game plan.

347
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:54,133
They'll turn left at the intersection.

348
00:41:56,947 --> 00:42:01,111
Our agent will change the light

349
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,742
after they turn left.

350
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,216
Where is he?

351
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,695
Wagon 5, where the hell are you?

352
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,594
Fuck!

353
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,680
Come on!

354
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:45,425
Why aren't you going?
What are you, sightseeing?

355
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,357
Roll it down!

356
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,126
Open it!

357
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,674
Wagon 5!

358
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,677
What's going on here?

359
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:10,013
Follow his car. Stay close.

360
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:18,658
Just as we planned!
Get the forensic guys ready.

361
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,534
Stop!

362
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:44,177
Let's get started.

363
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,328
Hello?

364
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,133
Moving in today?

365
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,663
Hi, there.

366
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,769
May I help you?

367
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,042
I'm from Seoul Newspaper.

368
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,817
Welcome to this town

369
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,083
I've brought some trash bags
to help you clean the place.

370
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,888
Let me help you with the trash.

371
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:21,250
It's so beautiful house!

372
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,618
This pepper paste has gone bad.

373
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,588
- Pepper paste?
- Let me throw this out.

374
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:38,199
Hi, I'm from daehan Newspaper.

375
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:42,311
I've brought a broom and dustpan
to help clean the place.

376
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,312
Hello?
I'm from Donghae Newspaper.

377
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,441
What's wrong with you people?

378
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,014
I got here first, so get out!

379
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:57,356
Nonsense!
Our paper is better than yours.

380
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:10,369
Is this the attitude of journalists?

381
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,144
Journalists my ass!

382
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:17,641
Stop the nonsense,
and get your hand off me!

383
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:24,084
Jesus Christ!

384
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:31,420
- Look who's here!
- Wait, wait!

385
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,624
Get over here!

386
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,603
I told you I didn't want
your paper, didn't I?

387
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,872
You haven't paid the bill, sir.

388
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,924
Doo-chill, what did he take
from the den?

389
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,898
From the den...

390
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,667
Shotgun and
a Japanese sword, sir.

391
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,642
From the master bedroom?

392
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:25,471
Some personal belongings
of Cho Gwang-ja.

393
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,607
Right.

394
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:27,843
What about the living room?

395
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,283
Living room?

396
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:33,284
What the hell were you doing?

397
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,615
You don't know shit!

398
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:41,559
I think that jar...

399
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,099
What about it?

400
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,362
- This big and...
- Shut up!

401
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,900
Once he gets on the plane,
that's it!

402
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,268
Call the airport security
to hold him up.

403
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:07,749
- What took you so long?
- Sorry, boss.

404
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,953
- Did you bring it?
- Sure.

405
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:13,826
Let me see.

406
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,464
What is this?

407
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,474
Get down!

408
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,542
You hear this?

409
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:03,131
Tae-ho...

410
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:08,578
Remember what I said I'd do
if you mess up?

411
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,677
You'll be seeing the pig farm.

412
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:24,323
What is this?
Nothing but soybean paste?

413
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,421
That's right, sir...
It's 100% % Korean soybean paste.

414
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:32,390
Shit!
Thought it was too easy.

415
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,170
Park Tae-ho fucked us up.

416
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:53,248
Gang Yong-gu,
Park Tae-ho...

417
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,054
You guys are fucked.

418
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,692
Do you have any idea
how badly I waited
for this moment?

419
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:08,899
Worthless scumbags!

420
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:17,676
The ghost of my late father
will see the arrest
warrant for you.

421
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:25,043
You wanted to
smoke, didn't you?
Smoke them all!

422
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,397
You think it's funny?

423
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:41,730
Let go!

424
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,803
- Let's go.
- Off of me!

425
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,207
You'll never see the sunlight again!

426
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,775
What happened to his eyebrow?

427
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:01,957
What do you think You're doing?
We've got nothing on them.

428
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:04,755
Sorry, sir.

429
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,331
Sir!

430
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,925
Put electric wires on
their armpits, fingers,
toes, and dicks

431
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,630
They'll start talking.

432
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:18,231
What the hell's
wrong with you?

433
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,238
I should've seen this coming
when you mentioned the jar.

434
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,811
How did you even
become a D.A.?

435
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:31,112
You sure about that?
Nothing but soybean paste?

436
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:32,583
See it for yourself!

437
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,155
Why did they run
with this then?

438
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,761
We've been playing into
the hands of Park Tae-ho.

439
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,525
Let them go and
put men on them.

440
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,798
And you're off the case.

441
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:46,897
Sir!

442
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,770
You're no good on the field.

443
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:54,306
Get it out of here.
It smells!

444
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:36,985
You messed with
the wrong guy.
Do you know who I am?

445
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,316
No way!

446
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,327
You can't run from me!

447
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,922
I don't want much from you.

448
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:55,635
Let me hear you say you're sorry.
Apologize!

449
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,349
Apologize for what?

450
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:17,120
Who the fuck are you?!

451
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,463
hey! Fake eyebrow!

452
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,809
Kings have knights.

453
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:43,817
Generals have soldiers.

454
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:48,456
And singers have fans.

455
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:53,458
Then, whom do I have?

456
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:55,362
I have you!

457
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,831
You knew it, didn't you?

458
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:07,339
You were so brilliant.
You knew they were on us.

459
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:12,571
That's why you used
the jar as a decoy.

460
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,179
Of course!

461
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,847
Where are diamonds then?

462
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:29,931
Go to Incheon port, boss.

463
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,936
We're taking a boat?

464
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:38,302
I've never seen anyone smarter!

465
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:44,570
Okay, I'll meet you there.
Bring the stuff.

466
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,944
What about me?

467
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,083
What?

468
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,351
You're not taking me?

469
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:58,489
Of course not.
We never meant to take you.

470
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:02,095
She's completely lost, man.

471
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:12,772
I've lived for this moment.
No way I'm off the case.

472
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:27,118
Your eyebrow is running.

473
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:35,490
- Thanks for earlier.
- Huh?

474
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,125
That crazy bastard.

475
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:43,063
Oh, that four-eyed freak.

476
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,198
How do I open it?

477
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,775
Use this.

478
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:01,190
Now I know how you
feel about me.

479
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:06,186
What are you talking about?
I was just...

480
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,293
I know it's hard but
don't let your personal
feelings get in the way.

481
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,265
You're so unbelievable.

482
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,702
- Are you always like this?
- Enough.

483
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,748
We'll talk later.

484
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,215
Sir!

485
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:30,450
By the way,
do you like eclairs?

486
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:47,834
What?!

487
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:57,168
You knew all along, didn't you?

488
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,706
He meant to ditch me,
didn't he?

489
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,276
Tell me, jerk!

490
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,912
Keep it down.

491
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,891
Dirty bastards!

492
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:17,257
Gwang-ja... where's the jar?

493
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:24,832
You intercepted it, didn't you?
You worthless junkie!

494
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:33,907
Back to the apartment.

495
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,980
- Got all the stuff up?
- Right.

496
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:42,223
You want some eclairs?

497
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:44,418
Right now?

498
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:48,788
- You had lunch earlier.
- I'm still hungry.

499
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,768
How's it going?

500
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:02,440
Who's this?
It's the same asshole!

501
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,379
Stop it!

502
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,647
How many jobs do
you have, man?

503
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:14,314
Obstruction of justice is
a serious criminal offense.

504
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,220
Is he nuts or what?

505
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,426
Pay up and leave.

506
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:30,767
There's nothing you do right.

507
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:35,542
Not only are you a bad mover,
but also a terrible baker!

508
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,040
It's all burnt!

509
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,975
I'll give you a different one.

510
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:49,786
I'm sure I'm a lot older.
So, show some respect.

511
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,859
Is that right?
How old are you?

512
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:58,826
I've had it with you people.
Get out of here!

513
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:04,198
You're asking for it, man.

514
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:11,069
Do you have any
idea who I am?

515
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:16,277
Of course we do.
A peddler without eyebrow!

516
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,417
Look.

517
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,790
Now beat it.

518
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:34,169
Sorry. We didn't know.

519
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:36,395
Did you expect this?

520
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:42,171
You thought we would fall
for a fake badge?

521
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,973
He's stupider than I thought.

522
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,747
Get out of here
before I take you downtown.

523
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:54,016
He never listens, does he?
Let's rock and roll!

524
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:56,848
Stop it!

525
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:15,042
We've got bad news for you.
The master of pottery...

526
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:18,709
who was helping us...

527
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:24,083
passed away a moment ago
at the age of 95.

528
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:29,453
We've got only 100 jars left.

529
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,455
Get the last famous work of...

530
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,242
Isn't that Doo-chil?

531
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,606
What's he doing out here?

532
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:55,944
He's really good at poking
his nose where
it doesn't belong!

533
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:19,037
Dokgo, where are you?

534
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:26,678
- At the scene, sir.
- Get your ass over here!

535
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,913
- Master bedroom?
- Done!

536
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,923
- Other bedrooms?
- Done!

537
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,960
- Kitchen?
- All done!

538
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:42,725
Very good!

539
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,692
You guys did a great job.

540
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,332
- Where's the lady?
- At the janitor's office.

541
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,640
We have to get this signed.

542
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:00,844
Had it not been for
those bastards, we
could've finished it earlier.

543
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,784
What the...!

544
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:14,893
What are they doing?

545
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,947
- Eclairs, please.
- Sure.

546
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,661
Dokgo, my hunch was right.
They're back.

547
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:59,364
I know.

548
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,809
How did you know?

549
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:06,804
Go back to the office.
The director is here.

550
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,744
I don't care.
I'm not going anywhere!

551
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:21,452
You take a walk.
It's getting too dangerous.

552
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,692
You're too young to die.

553
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,308
Noodles aren't good for you!

554
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:09,776
I won't give up
until you apologize!

555
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,684
I guess you're a man, too.

556
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:30,195
You want to do it?

557
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,937
Dream on, moron!

558
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:03,725
Don't even think about it.

559
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:17,369
- Let's call the cops.
- We should.

560
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,245
I can't believe this!

561
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,274
One, two, one, two...

562
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,778
On the spot!

563
01:05:57,486 --> 01:05:59,818
- Attention! Salute!
- Taekwon!

564
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,022
Okay.

565
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:34,253
You're moving in, right?

566
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:37,421
Right.

567
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:42,525
I run a Taekwondo gym
across the street.

568
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,157
Send your kids to me.

569
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:52,333
The first month is free.
And Jazz dance, ballet...

570
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:53,906
Get out!

571
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:57,045
Sure.

572
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:01,244
Move out!

573
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,819
Who are you?

574
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:11,688
Want milk delivered?

575
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:40,653
Did it hurt?

576
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:47,963
Sorry. I wasn't myself.

577
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:58,433
Don't get me wrong.
I gave up on you for your safety.

578
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:08,445
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have done that.

579
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:24,060
As a matter of fact,
I've been waiting for today.

580
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:30,235
You trust me, don't you?

581
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:36,170
You think I'd be his pawn
for the rest of my life?

582
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:40,947
I don't like Brazil.
I don't know a word
of Portuguese.

583
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:48,119
If you take me back, we can...

584
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:54,260
What is it?

585
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,310
What was that for?!

586
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,875
Where is it?

587
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:23,683
I don't know
anything about a jar.

588
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:38,001
Get out.

589
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:40,635
Out!

590
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:51,718
Where did you hide it?
Where is it?

591
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,516
I don't know.

592
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,948
You don't know?

593
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:06,295
Gwang-ja...!

594
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:16,006
We picked a wrong
day to move.

595
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:19,671
Think of it as
a blessing in disguise.

596
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:28,322
When will you guys be done?

597
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:34,590
Give us 30 more minutes.

598
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:37,162
Shake a leg, boys!

599
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,600
Let's go get something to eat.

600
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:41,067
Too upset to eat!

601
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,936
We'll be back soon.

602
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,558
What's he doing here?

603
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:16,368
Lock the door!

604
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:22,810
Sir, from my experience...

605
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:24,743
What do you think you're doing?
Close it!

606
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,286
Judging from my experience...

607
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:46,258
- What experience?
- It must be inside the apartment.

608
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:51,602
But you've checked all the boxes.
And look at yourself!

609
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:53,768
Go back to the office.

610
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:56,310
Judging from my experience...

611
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:59,313
What experience?
This is your first field operation!

612
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:02,412
The evidence must be hidden
either in the wall or ceiling.

613
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,856
- What do you want from me?
- Put me back on the case.

614
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:10,323
No way!

615
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,462
I'm going in!

616
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,436
What the...

617
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,974
Go after him.

618
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:42,647
Tae-ho, isn't he that D.A.?

619
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,730
You want me to do him?

620
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:52,792
No, don't mind him.

621
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:07,649
Nothing can break our spirit.

622
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:12,311
Cheer up, guys.
Let's get back to work.

623
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,028
What are you doing here?

624
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:30,161
I'm a D.A. on a case.

625
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,502
Keep them out here.
Out of my way.

626
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:35,571
Get out!

627
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,549
I guess he's the real D.A.

628
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,932
- Don't go in!
- They're destroying everything!

629
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,527
What do you think
you're doing?

630
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:33,156
Who told you to come in?
Get out!

631
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:49,316
Get out of my sight
before I have you all arrested!

632
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,142
What did we do wrong?

633
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:54,522
Obstruction of justice,
blackmailing...

634
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:57,254
and assault!
You ruined my eyebrow.

635
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,295
You've trashed the place!

636
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:01,522
The damage will be paid for.

637
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:02,188
- The damage?!
- Out of my way.

638
01:15:02,264 --> 01:15:04,129
damage my ass!

639
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,598
- God, you hit me again!
- Get up!

640
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:09,901
Knock it off!

641
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,673
Stop!!

642
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:24,750
So glad that you're here.
Arrest them!

643
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,725
What are you doing?
Cuff them!

644
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:33,058
Sir, that's enough.

645
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:40,494
Park Tae-ho was at #1001.
There's nothing here.

646
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:44,267
Nothing?

647
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:58,642
I see.

648
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:02,247
The damage will be paid for.

649
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,690
No matter how important it is,
you can't do this.

650
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:14,063
They moved here with dreams.

651
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:24,741
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

652
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:34,856
No words will fix it,
but I know it's not your fault.

653
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:42,692
I've got to go in to wrap it up.

654
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:45,098
Okay.

655
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,499
Wait!

656
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,500
Huh?

657
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:56,204
- Ik-soo, right?
- Right.

658
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:59,544
My name is Dokgo Jin.

659
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:11,091
- The cops are on our tail.
- What?!

660
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:16,496
- We can't take the boat.
- Then what?

661
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:20,866
'Jeju Island'

662
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:24,566
Why don't you go to Jeju Island?

663
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:26,504
Jeju?

664
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:30,034
And cruise over to Japan?

665
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:36,281
That's an idea.
Japan is better than Brazil.

666
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:41,123
Hello? What did you say?

667
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:43,785
- Can't you hear me? Hello?
- I'm losing you, boss.

668
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:03,534
Gosh, look at these!

669
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:05,670
Leave them on.

670
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:16,949
Everybody out!

671
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:29,501
Apt # 1205!

672
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:43,280
Gwang-ja, the sun will rise
tomorrow, too.

673
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:48,787
Park Tae-ho...

674
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:53,061
Will there be
tomorrow for you?

675
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:07,341
Push it again.

676
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:13,809
- Who's holding it!
- No fucking manners!

677
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:16,912
I hate stairs!

678
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,728
I won't let either cops or
gangsters get in our way.

679
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,556
They have no right to ruin
the lives of our customers!

680
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:38,061
I don't mind going back to prison.
What do you say?

681
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,303
What did you say?

682
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,579
How can you say that?

683
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,114
They messed with
the wrong girl.

684
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:54,315
Let's rock and roll.
Fuck!

685
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,425
motherfucker!

686
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:05,197
Buy the chest!

687
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,035
- Come on!
- My legs are shaky.

688
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,706
Who the fuck are you?

689
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:18,710
We're going to Apt # 1205.

690
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:29,582
- Hi there.
- You're already here?

691
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:36,392
Your friends look
very familiar.

692
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,495
Do I know you?

693
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:50,237
Hey, it's me from high school.
My nickname was 'Tin Can'

694
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:51,441
Tin Can?

695
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,580
Congratulations on
your marriage!

696
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:02,387
Where does your father-in-law
keep the jar of pepper paste?

697
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,220
- The jar of pepper paste?
- You fucking asshole!

698
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:10,159
You hired goons to take
the chest from us so
you can save money?!

699
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:18,998
Is your fiance
really a teacher?

700
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:20,423
Okay, sir.

701
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:23,466
Park Tae-ho has
retrieved the stuff.

702
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:25,863
- Where is he?
- 12th floor.

703
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:27,867
Let's go!

704
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,152
Park Tae-ho!

705
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,352
- They're here!
- Get them!

706
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:06,336
Hurry!
Come on, this way!

707
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:43,028
Dokgo, where are you?
We've lost Park Tae-ho!

708
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:45,198
We're fucked!

709
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:53,870
Where's Ik-soo?

710
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:40,029
Freeze!

711
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:56,043
- I'm an agent on the case.
- And I'm a mover.

712
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,860
Park Tae-ho!

713
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:34,918
Like father, like son!
I knew you'd nail him!

714
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:49,102
Get him out of here!

715
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:07,613
- I don't get it.
- What?

716
01:32:10,157 --> 01:32:12,625
You should've
been a detective.

717
01:32:14,962 --> 01:32:16,725
Aren't you cold?

718
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:19,757
- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.

719
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,408
Come on, let me see.

720
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:41,612
Apologize!

721
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:52,263
I'm sorry.
You have my apology.

722
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:54,564
So sorry!

723
01:33:03,844 --> 01:33:06,574
Father!

724
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:19,583
Refreshment, ma'am?

725
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:25,663
Juice, please.
How long does it take to Brazil?

726
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:28,735
27 hours with
a stopover in LA.

727
01:33:53,995 --> 01:33:58,193
Ready?
Come on, over here.

728
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:01,830
Come here, guys.

729
01:34:03,237 --> 01:34:05,205
Don't take it yet.

730
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:06,704
Let me hold you.

731
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:08,666
Everybody, squeeze in.

732
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:10,469
Here we go.

733
01:34:11,078 --> 01:34:13,205
One, two, three... Cheese!

734
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:19,409
I don't just carry boxes,
but the hopes of our customers.

735
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:24,914
And we've added a new
member to our family.

736
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:53,886
Ik-soo Express
