00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,404
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

2
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,490
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,285
His office is the first door
on the left.

4
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:21,661
Thank you.

5
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:39,849
Mr. Ullman?

6
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:41,352
I'm Jack Torrance.

7
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:43,562
Come on in, Jack.

8
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:47,150
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

9
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,945
This is my secretary, Susie.

10
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,822
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?

11
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:54,825
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

12
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,995
That's very good time.

13
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,914
Sit down a minute, Jack.

14
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:00,916
Just make yourself at home.

15
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,334
Like some coffee?

16
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:05,088
lf you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

17
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:06,215
- Susie.
- Sure.

18
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,175
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

19
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:09,927
Yes, I will.

20
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:21,899
Mom?

21
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:23,901
Yeah?

22
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:27,906
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

23
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:29,867
Sure I do.

24
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:32,036
lt'll be lots of fun.

25
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:36,041
Yeah. I guess so.

26
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,421
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

27
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:44,759
I know. lt always takes
a little time to make new friends.

28
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:48,598
Yeah, I guess so.

29
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,349
What about Tony?

30
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:52,894
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

31
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:55,939
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

32
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:58,651
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

33
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:01,070
I don't want to go there.

34
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:03,615
How come you don't want to go?

35
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:05,648
I just don't.

36
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:08,413
Let's just wait and see.

37
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:11,382
We're all going to have
a real good time.

38
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:15,226
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

39
00:05:15,427 --> 00:05:16,860
How do you do, Bill?

40
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:19,030
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

41
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,165
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

42
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:25,497
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.

43
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:28,707
I'd like you to take him around
soon as we're through.

44
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:29,842
Fine.

45
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,379
Jack is a schoolteacher.

46
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:34,615
Formerly a schoolteacher.

47
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:36,511
What line of work are you in now?

48
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:38,311
I'm a writer.

49
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:42,183
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

50
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:44,359
This ought to be
quite a change for you.

51
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:47,092
I'm looking for a change.

52
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:50,893
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once ...

53
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,694
...I agree with them.

54
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,136
Let's see, where were we?

55
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:57,935
I was about to explain ...

56
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:02,342
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

57
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:06,007
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

58
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:09,018
Do you mind if I ask
why you do that?

59
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:12,682
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

60
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:15,489
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost ...

61
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:18,258
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

62
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,631
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

63
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:23,203
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

64
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:26,638
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible ...

65
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,778
...to keep it clear.

66
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,346
When the place was built in 1907...

67
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,111
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

68
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,189
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

69
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:41,951
It's certainly got
plenty of that.

70
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,356
That's right.

71
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:46,390
Did they give you
any idea in Denver. . .

72
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,267
. . .about what the job entails?

73
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,604
Only in a very general way.

74
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:55,485
The winters can be
fantastically cruel.

75
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:59,072
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage. . .

76
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:01,282
. . .and depreciation
which can occur.

77
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,953
This consists mainly
of running the boiler. . .

78
00:07:04,203 --> 00:07:08,124
. . .heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis. . .

79
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:11,003
. . .repairing damage as it occurs. . .

80
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:14,090
. . .and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

81
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:17,427
That sounds fine to me.

82
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:20,723
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

83
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:24,059
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter. . .

84
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:26,938
. . .is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

85
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:32,694
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

86
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,199
I'm outlining a new
writing project.

87
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:39,870
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

88
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:42,415
That's very good, Jack.

89
00:07:42,707 --> 00:07:45,835
Because, for some people. . .

90
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:47,795
. . .solitude. . .

91
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:49,589
. . .and isolation. . .

92
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:52,719
. . .can, of itself, become a problem.

93
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:55,221
Not for me.

94
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:58,893
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

95
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:01,812
They'll love it.

96
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:03,314
Great.

97
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:09,404
Before I turn you over to Bill. . .

98
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:13,075
. . .there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

99
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,787
Not to sound melodramatic. . .

100
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,539
. . .but it's been known to
give a few people. . .

101
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,958
. . .second thoughts about the job.

102
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,295
I'm intrigued.

103
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:24,839
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver. . .

104
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:29,011
. . .about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

105
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:31,597
I don't believe they did.

106
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:35,894
My predecessor in this job. . .

107
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:39,899
. . .hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

108
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:43,569
He came up with his wife and
2 little girls of about 8 and 10.

109
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,824
He had a good employment record,
good references.

110
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:49,284
And from what I've been told,
he seemed. . .

111
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:52,162
. . .like a completely
normal individual.

112
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:54,750
But at some point
during the winter. . .

113
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,629
. . .he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

114
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,174
He ran amuck. . .

115
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,763
. . .and killed his family
with an ax.

116
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:12,687
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then. . .

117
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:17,193
. . .he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

118
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:20,238
The police thought. . .

119
00:09:20,488 --> 00:09:24,493
. . .that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

120
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:27,747
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur. . .

121
00:09:27,997 --> 00:09:32,127
. . .when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

122
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:38,551
That is. . .

123
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,304
. . .quite a story.

124
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:43,098
Yeah, it is.

125
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,562
lt's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

126
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,522
But it did.

127
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:55,321
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

128
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:58,367
I certainly can.

129
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:01,453
I also understand
why your people in Denver. . .

130
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:03,915
. . .left it for you to tell me.

131
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:07,794
Obviously, some people
can be put off. . .

132
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:12,091
. . .from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

133
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:17,179
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

134
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,060
And as far as my wife
is concerned. . .

135
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,147
. . .I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

136
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:28,151
She's a confirmed ghost story. . .

137
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,779
. . .and horror film addict.

138
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:40,373
Tony, do you think
Dad'll get the job?

139
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:44,003
He already did.

140
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,132
He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

141
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:05,528
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, hon. How's it going?

142
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:09,282
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to do.

143
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:12,619
I don't think I can get home
before 9 or 10.

144
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,329
Sounds like you got the job.

145
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:17,250
Right. lt's a beautiful place.

146
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,586
You and Danny are going to love it.

147
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:24,008
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

148
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:25,968
I don't know.

149
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:30,599
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

150
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:33,268
I don't want to.

151
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,228
Please.

152
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:37,566
No.

153
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,985
Now, Tony, tell me.

154
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:12,277
Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.

155
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:18,986
That's good. Now the other one.

156
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:21,860
Good boy.

157
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:30,569
Now, Danny...

158
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,064
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

159
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:36,267
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

160
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:41,247
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

161
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:45,248
No.

162
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:48,815
Do you remember when you were
brushing your teeth?

163
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,691
Yes.

164
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,460
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

165
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:02,302
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

166
00:13:06,514 --> 00:13:08,744
Can you remember
what you were doing...

167
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,886
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

168
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,153
Talking to Tony.

169
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:19,192
Is Tony one of your animals?

170
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:22,999
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

171
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,701
Tony's his imaginary friend.

172
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,041
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

173
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:35,942
Why not?

174
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,047
Because he hides.

175
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:41,449
Where does he go?

176
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:44,354
To my stomach.

177
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:49,296
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

178
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:56,031
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

179
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:00,109
That's fine.

180
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:02,675
All right, Danny.

181
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:06,280
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

182
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:09,852
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

183
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:11,181
Do I have to?

184
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,655
Yes. I'd like you to.

185
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,624
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

186
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,957
I'll come back and check on you.

187
00:14:27,477 --> 00:14:29,877
- Shall we go into the living room?
- Yes.

188
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,449
- Please.
- Thank you.

189
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:43,694
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

190
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:47,923
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

191
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:55,800
He seems absolutely fine now.

192
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:56,998
But you should've seen him.

193
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:58,702
I know.

194
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:00,608
Kids can scare you to death.

195
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,683
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

196
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,447
And they look much worse
than they are.

197
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,652
But what was the matter with him?

198
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:13,955
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

199
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:19,034
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

200
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,807
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

201
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:25,978
...a kind of self-induced trance.

202
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:28,170
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

203
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:32,143
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

204
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:37,019
I'm sure you're right.

205
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,356
Have you been in Boulder long?

206
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:43,461
Only about three months.

207
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:47,034
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

208
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,839
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

209
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:54,107
Tony.

210
00:15:54,312 --> 00:15:58,271
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

211
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:02,718
Let's see....

212
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,983
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

213
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,889
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

214
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:11,594
Did he adjust well to school?

215
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,735
He didn't like it too much
at first.

216
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:19,236
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

217
00:16:20,642 --> 00:16:24,545
I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

218
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:27,949
What sort of injury did he have?

219
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:30,780
He dislocated his shoulder.

220
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:33,520
How did he manage to do that?

221
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:40,022
It was just one of
those things, you know.

222
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,223
Purely an accident.

223
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:46,001
My husband had been drinking...

224
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:49,540
...and he came home
about three hours late.

225
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:54,406
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

226
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,917
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

227
00:17:00,122 --> 00:17:04,423
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

228
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:07,688
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

229
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:09,923
...you know, in a park
or in the street.

230
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:13,664
But on this particular occasion...

231
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:16,500
...my husband just used
too much strength...

232
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,303
...and he injured Danny's arm.

233
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:26,877
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said...

234
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:29,681
..."Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

235
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:31,825
And if I do, you can leave me."

236
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:33,357
And he didn't.

237
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:38,056
He hasn't had any
alcohol in 5 months.

238
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,282
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

239
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:16,123
Dad?

240
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,669
I'm hungry.

241
00:18:22,464 --> 00:18:25,217
You should've eaten your breakfast.

242
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:28,930
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

243
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:30,808
Okay, Mom.

244
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:36,396
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

245
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:41,653
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

246
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,533
What was the Donner party?

247
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,706
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

248
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:55,169
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

249
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:59,632
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

250
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:03,637
You mean they ate each other up?

251
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:06,932
They had to, in order to survive.

252
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:08,394
Jack.

253
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:09,687
Don't worry, Mom.

254
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:14,150
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

255
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,070
See, it's okay.

256
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,698
He saw it on the television.

257
00:19:50,443 --> 00:19:52,236
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8:30.

258
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:55,199
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

259
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:57,367
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.

260
00:19:57,618 --> 00:20:00,704
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

261
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:03,541
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

262
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:06,628
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

263
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:08,547
ls your family
having a look around?

264
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,135
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

265
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:15,430
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.

266
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,933
ln view of all we have
to cover today. . .

267
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,813
. . .I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

268
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:24,816
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

269
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:27,778
I'd better collect my family first.

270
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:38,249
This is our Colorado Lounge.

271
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:40,876
lt's beautiful.

272
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:43,130
My God!

273
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,882
This place is fantastic,
isn't it, hon?

274
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:47,467
lt sure is.

275
00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:50,288
I've never seen anything
like this before.

276
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,897
Are all these
lndian designs authentic?

277
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:55,530
I believe they're based...

278
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:58,930
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

279
00:20:59,137 --> 00:21:01,105
They're really gorgeous.

280
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:02,330
As a matter of fact...

281
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,635
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

282
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:09,014
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

283
00:21:09,215 --> 00:21:12,309
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

284
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,489
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

285
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,750
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

286
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:20,288
Lots of movie stars.

287
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:22,053
Royalty?

288
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:23,830
All the best people.

289
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:20,207
This is the staff wing
of the hotel.

290
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:24,504
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

291
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:27,632
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.

292
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:29,801
And here are your quarters.

293
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:32,847
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

294
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:35,642
And a small bedroom for your son.

295
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:41,232
Perfect for a child.

296
00:22:47,764 --> 00:22:51,222
Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

297
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,994
Easy to keep.

298
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,832
Cozy.

299
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,306
Yes, very cozy for a family.

300
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,206
If you feel like spreading out...

301
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,076
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

302
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,210
Well, it's very...

303
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,053
...homey.

304
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:15,225
This is our famous hedge maze.

305
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,731
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

306
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:22,234
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

307
00:23:22,438 --> 00:23:25,066
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

308
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:28,267
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

309
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,773
When was the Overlook built?

310
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:35,015
Construction started in 1907.

311
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:37,189
It was finished in 1909.

312
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:40,051
The site's supposed to be
on an lndian burial ground.

313
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,887
They actually had to repel...

314
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:44,996
...a few lndian attacks as they
were building it.

315
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,499
That's our Snowcat.

316
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:50,227
Can you both drive a car?

317
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:54,333
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.

318
00:23:54,543 --> 00:23:57,104
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

319
00:23:58,314 --> 00:24:01,681
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

320
00:24:01,885 --> 00:24:05,014
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

321
00:24:05,222 --> 00:24:07,190
He sure did a beautiful job.

322
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:09,723
Pink and gold
are my favorite colors.

323
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:12,895
This is our Gold Ballroom.

324
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:15,729
I'll say!

325
00:24:15,935 --> 00:24:19,701
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

326
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,107
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

327
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:27,110
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

328
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:30,375
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

329
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:33,645
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

330
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:34,823
We don't drink.

331
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:36,458
Then you're in luck.

332
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,892
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

333
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:43,225
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

334
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:46,164
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

335
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,564
Glad to meet you.

336
00:24:47,772 --> 00:24:50,639
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

337
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:54,574
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

338
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:56,646
It's just wonderful.

339
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,374
Hi, Danny!

340
00:24:59,286 --> 00:25:01,982
I found him outside
looking for you.

341
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,057
Did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

342
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:08,952
Come on over here.

343
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:10,324
Thank you, Susie.

344
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:14,526
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

345
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:16,603
...while I continue on with Jack.

346
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,241
It would be a pleasure.
Right this way.

347
00:25:19,443 --> 00:25:21,001
Great. See you later, hon.

348
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:22,577
Bye, darling.

349
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:28,282
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

350
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:31,012
Now, are you a "Winnie",
or a "Freddie"?

351
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:32,485
I'm a Wendy.

352
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:35,888
Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

353
00:25:36,096 --> 00:25:37,723
This is the kitchen, huh?

354
00:25:37,932 --> 00:25:39,524
This is it.

355
00:25:39,734 --> 00:25:42,669
How do you like it, Danny?
ls it big enough for you?

356
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:45,700
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

357
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:48,273
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

358
00:25:48,477 --> 00:25:52,038
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

359
00:25:52,948 --> 00:25:54,814
Don't let it get you down.

360
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,510
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

361
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,916
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

362
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:02,355
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

363
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,688
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

364
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:10,562
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

365
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,864
Right here is
our walk-in freezer.

366
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:18,068
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

367
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,270
You got 15 rib roasts...

368
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:22,608
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

369
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:25,878
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

370
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:29,182
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

371
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:32,361
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

372
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:35,962
You don't?
What's your favorite food, then?

373
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:38,032
French fries and ketchup.

374
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,761
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

375
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,702
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

376
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:51,007
How'd you know we call him Doc?

377
00:26:51,217 --> 00:26:55,244
- Beg your pardon?
- Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

378
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:56,855
I did?

379
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,787
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

380
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:02,258
But how did you know?

381
00:27:02,464 --> 00:27:04,990
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

382
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:07,465
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

383
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,865
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

384
00:27:10,072 --> 00:27:12,268
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

385
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,143
What's up, Doc?

386
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:19,177
Now, this is the storeroom.

387
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:22,750
In here is where we keep...

388
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:25,753
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

389
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:28,393
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

390
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:32,395
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

391
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,797
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

392
00:27:36,003 --> 00:27:40,030
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

393
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:42,710
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

394
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:46,109
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

395
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:56,225
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

396
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:00,622
Sociables, finger rolls...

397
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,357
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

398
00:28:02,568 --> 00:28:06,096
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

399
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:09,400
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

400
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:13,910
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

401
00:28:16,818 --> 00:28:18,445
- How're you getting on?
- Fine.

402
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:22,216
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

403
00:28:22,425 --> 00:28:24,359
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

404
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:27,758
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

405
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:29,830
You like ice cream, Doc?

406
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:31,668
I thought you did.

407
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:34,929
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

408
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:36,970
- Not at all.
- We don't mind.

409
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:39,370
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?

410
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:41,638
Okay, you behave yourself.

411
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,516
What kind of ice cream
do you like?

412
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,618
Chocolate.

413
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:50,790
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

414
00:28:55,363 --> 00:28:57,354
It's amazing, all this
activity today.

415
00:28:57,565 --> 00:29:00,363
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

416
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,003
...last day's always hectic.

417
00:29:02,205 --> 00:29:05,265
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

418
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:09,503
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

419
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,773
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

420
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:20,425
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

421
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:29,401
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

422
00:29:36,378 --> 00:29:39,871
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

423
00:29:40,284 --> 00:29:42,809
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

424
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,854
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

425
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:50,224
She called it "shining."

426
00:29:51,729 --> 00:29:54,459
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

427
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:57,295
...that had "the shine" to us.

428
00:29:57,903 --> 00:30:00,895
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

429
00:30:01,575 --> 00:30:03,441
But there are other folks...

430
00:30:03,644 --> 00:30:07,375
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

431
00:30:12,054 --> 00:30:14,488
How long have you
been able to do it?

432
00:30:19,696 --> 00:30:22,096
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

433
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:29,398
I'm not supposed to.

434
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:33,501
Who says you ain't supposed to?

435
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:38,348
Tony.

436
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,981
Who's Tony?

437
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:47,860
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

438
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:51,823
Is Tony the one
that...

439
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:53,592
...tells you things?

440
00:30:58,141 --> 00:31:00,507
How does he tell you things?

441
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:06,647
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

442
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:10,948
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

443
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:16,489
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

444
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,360
Do they know he tells you things?

445
00:31:23,238 --> 00:31:26,173
Tony told me never to tell them.

446
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,678
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

447
00:31:31,881 --> 00:31:34,441
About the Overlook Hotel?

448
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:39,279
I don't know.

449
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,988
Now think real hard, Doc.

450
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,219
Think.

451
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:50,063
Maybe he showed me something.

452
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:53,632
Try to think of what it was.

453
00:31:56,643 --> 00:31:59,943
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

454
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,280
Scared of nothing here.

455
00:32:05,754 --> 00:32:07,244
It's just that...

456
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,823
...you know, some places
are like people.

457
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:13,356
Some shine...

458
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:14,962
...and some don't.

459
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,327
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...

460
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:21,834
...has something about it
that's like shining.

461
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:27,277
Is there something bad here?

462
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:41,327
You know, Doc,
when something happens...

463
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:45,158
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

464
00:32:45,934 --> 00:32:47,493
Say, like...

465
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:50,764
...if someone burns toast.

466
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:57,541
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

467
00:32:58,716 --> 00:33:02,153
Not things that anyone
can notice.

468
00:33:02,354 --> 00:33:07,155
But things that people
who shine can see.

469
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:11,561
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

470
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:17,999
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

471
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:22,408
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

472
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,308
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

473
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,250
And not all of them
was good.

474
00:33:32,556 --> 00:33:35,185
What about room 237?

475
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:40,724
Room 237?

476
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:45,128
You're scared of room 237,
ain't you?

477
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:48,373
No, I ain't.

478
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:53,711
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

479
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:56,414
Nothing.

480
00:33:56,852 --> 00:34:00,083
There ain't nothing in room 237.

481
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,519
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

482
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:05,853
So stay out.

483
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:08,553
You understand? Stay out!

484
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:49,677
Good morning, hon.

485
00:35:51,686 --> 00:35:53,449
Your breakfast is ready.

486
00:35:54,223 --> 00:35:55,850
What time is it?

487
00:35:56,058 --> 00:35:57,923
It's about 11:30.

488
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:01,422
Jesus.

489
00:36:02,366 --> 00:36:04,800
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

490
00:36:05,102 --> 00:36:06,535
I know it.

491
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:10,706
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

492
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,568
Nice.

493
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:16,644
It's really pretty outside.

494
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:20,081
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

495
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:25,022
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

496
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,121
Any ideas yet?

497
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,791
Lots of ideas.

498
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:32,523
No good ones.

499
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:35,470
Something will come.

500
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:39,908
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

501
00:36:41,478 --> 00:36:43,173
That's all it is.

502
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:47,580
It's really nice up here,
isn't it?

503
00:36:47,985 --> 00:36:49,419
I love it.

504
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:51,513
I really do.

505
00:36:52,425 --> 00:36:55,451
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

506
00:36:55,661 --> 00:36:59,428
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.

507
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:02,534
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

508
00:37:02,736 --> 00:37:04,796
...I thought it was kind of scary.

509
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,799
I fell in love with it right away.

510
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,274
When I came up here
for my interview...

511
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:15,482
...it was as though
I'd been here before.

512
00:37:15,685 --> 00:37:18,313
I mean, we all have moments
of deja vu...

513
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:20,717
...but this was ridiculous.

514
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:23,324
It was almost as though I knew...

515
00:37:23,527 --> 00:37:27,259
...what was going to be
around every corner.

516
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:03,601
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?

517
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:06,369
- All right.
- And you're going to lose.

518
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:09,706
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

519
00:38:14,722 --> 00:38:15,848
Look out!

520
00:38:16,056 --> 00:38:17,921
I'm coming in close.

521
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,616
Loser has to keep America clean.

522
00:38:20,861 --> 00:38:22,489
Keep America clean.

523
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:24,965
Danny, you win.

524
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,632
Let's take the rest
of this walking.

525
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:31,572
Give me your hand.

526
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,008
Isn't it beautiful?

527
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:55,133
Dead end.

528
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:54,229
We made it.

529
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:55,968
Isn't it beautiful?

530
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,498
It's so pretty.

531
00:40:24,073 --> 00:40:27,043
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

532
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:40,724
Rutherford was serving
a life sentence...

533
00:40:40,926 --> 00:40:42,690
...for a 1968 shooting.

534
00:40:42,896 --> 00:40:46,764
And the search continues
for that missing Aspen woman.

535
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:50,335
24-year-old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.

536
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:53,268
She disappeared on a hunting
trip with her husband.

537
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:56,272
They may have to
call off the search...

538
00:40:56,478 --> 00:40:59,004
...if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow.

539
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:01,080
It's so beautiful
in Denver today...

540
00:41:01,284 --> 00:41:03,411
...it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close.

541
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:05,850
I want to go outside
and lie in the sun...

542
00:41:06,056 --> 00:41:10,186
...yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.

543
00:41:10,394 --> 00:41:11,588
And it's moving...

544
00:41:11,795 --> 00:41:14,959
...right here towards Colorado
as we talk. It's incredible.

545
00:43:43,608 --> 00:43:45,041
Hi, hon.

546
00:43:48,647 --> 00:43:50,047
How's it going?

547
00:43:52,618 --> 00:43:53,778
Fine.

548
00:43:55,888 --> 00:43:57,447
Get a lot written today?

549
00:44:04,499 --> 00:44:07,060
The weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

550
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,607
What do you want me
to do about it?

551
00:44:16,746 --> 00:44:18,907
Come on, hon.

552
00:44:19,249 --> 00:44:21,275
Don't be so grouchy.

553
00:44:21,687 --> 00:44:23,018
I'm not...

554
00:44:23,388 --> 00:44:24,582
...being grouchy.

555
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,588
I just want to finish my work.

556
00:44:31,097 --> 00:44:33,497
Okay. I understand.

557
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:36,328
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

558
00:44:36,537 --> 00:44:39,005
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

559
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,302
Wendy...

560
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:46,106
...let me explain something to you.

561
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:50,884
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

562
00:44:51,087 --> 00:44:52,521
You're distracting me...

563
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:56,159
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

564
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,793
Understand?

565
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:02,426
Fine.

566
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:05,331
We're going to make a new rule:

567
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:06,970
Whenever I'm in here...

568
00:45:07,173 --> 00:45:09,437
...and you hear me typing...

569
00:45:11,244 --> 00:45:14,179
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

570
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,680
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

571
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,114
That means don't come in.

572
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,584
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

573
00:45:26,229 --> 00:45:27,355
Fine.

574
00:45:28,398 --> 00:45:31,698
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

575
00:46:07,644 --> 00:46:09,009
All right, you!

576
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:12,245
I know you've got more.

577
00:46:14,352 --> 00:46:15,410
Missed!

578
00:46:20,992 --> 00:46:21,822
Don't have!

579
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,789
No fair anymore.

580
00:47:32,476 --> 00:47:33,773
I knew it.

581
00:48:04,046 --> 00:48:07,539
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.

582
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:13,751
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

583
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,087
This is KDK 1.
We're receiving you. Over.

584
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:20,590
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

585
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:23,965
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

586
00:48:24,237 --> 00:48:25,568
We're just fine.

587
00:48:25,771 --> 00:48:28,239
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

588
00:48:28,442 --> 00:48:31,469
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

589
00:48:32,113 --> 00:48:35,913
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

590
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:39,415
Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.

591
00:48:39,622 --> 00:48:40,782
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

592
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:44,426
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

593
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:48,329
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

594
00:48:48,799 --> 00:48:51,700
Yes. It's one of the worst we've
had for years.

595
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,468
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

596
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:58,102
I suppose not. Over.

597
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,010
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

598
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:03,512
And, Mrs. Torrance?

599
00:49:03,716 --> 00:49:07,914
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.

600
00:49:08,757 --> 00:49:10,247
Okay. We'll do that.

601
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:12,517
It was real nice talking to you.

602
00:49:12,727 --> 00:49:15,355
Bye. Over and out.

603
00:49:50,272 --> 00:49:52,467
Hello, Danny.

604
00:49:57,747 --> 00:50:00,181
Come and play with us.

605
00:50:05,055 --> 00:50:07,819
Come and play with us, Danny.

606
00:50:09,661 --> 00:50:11,527
Forever...

607
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:15,062
...and ever...

608
00:50:16,002 --> 00:50:18,027
...and ever.

609
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:51,135
Tony...

610
00:50:52,145 --> 00:50:54,170
...I'm scared.

611
00:50:59,653 --> 00:51:03,214
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

612
00:51:04,825 --> 00:51:08,728
It's just like
pictures in a book, Danny.

613
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:11,091
It isn't real.

614
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:23,593
Please let me give you
some money.

615
00:51:23,797 --> 00:51:25,822
I wouldn't think of it.

616
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:27,328
Well, how can I repay you?

617
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:30,203
It's okay. Really.

618
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,933
Well, I'm going to have
some coffee.

619
00:51:33,142 --> 00:51:34,666
Would you like some?

620
00:51:36,412 --> 00:51:37,471
Sure.

621
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:39,546
Great. Sit down.

622
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,088
Marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.

623
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:56,167
Coffee will be ready
in a few minutes.

624
00:51:59,939 --> 00:52:03,273
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?

625
00:52:04,712 --> 00:52:07,442
Not right now.
Daddy's asleep.

626
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:10,578
I won't make any noise.

627
00:52:11,988 --> 00:52:13,888
Now come on, Doc.

628
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,785
He only went to bed
a few hours ago.

629
00:52:15,993 --> 00:52:17,790
Can't you wait till later?

630
00:52:17,995 --> 00:52:21,123
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.

631
00:52:24,335 --> 00:52:25,632
All right.

632
00:52:25,837 --> 00:52:28,237
But really don't make a sound.

633
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,930
I won't, Mom.

634
00:52:30,742 --> 00:52:32,472
Make sure you
come right back...

635
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:34,670
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.

636
00:52:36,817 --> 00:52:38,307
Okay, Mom.

637
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:30,739
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

638
00:53:34,485 --> 00:53:36,680
Come here for a minute first.

639
00:54:13,697 --> 00:54:15,494
How's it going, Doc?

640
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:21,869
Having a good time?

641
00:54:23,943 --> 00:54:25,410
Yes, Dad.

642
00:54:28,314 --> 00:54:29,543
Good.

643
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:33,912
I want you to
have a good time.

644
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:36,249
I am, Dad.

645
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:48,500
Do you feel bad?

646
00:54:54,445 --> 00:54:56,743
I'm just a little bit tired.

647
00:54:58,316 --> 00:55:00,877
Then why don't you
go to sleep?

648
00:55:04,457 --> 00:55:06,015
I can't.

649
00:55:07,494 --> 00:55:09,792
I got too much to do.

650
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:21,372
Do you like this hotel?

651
00:55:27,384 --> 00:55:28,783
I do.

652
00:55:29,753 --> 00:55:31,085
I love it.

653
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:34,622
Don't you?

654
00:55:36,995 --> 00:55:38,485
I guess so.

655
00:55:41,134 --> 00:55:42,328
Good.

656
00:55:45,538 --> 00:55:47,871
I want you to like it here.

657
00:55:51,845 --> 00:55:55,247
I wish we could stay here
forever...

658
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,247
...and ever...

659
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,251
...and ever.

660
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:05,719
What?

661
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:10,092
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

662
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:17,063
What do you mean?

663
00:56:22,182 --> 00:56:24,776
Did your mother ever
say that to you?

664
00:56:25,453 --> 00:56:27,250
That I would hurt you?

665
00:56:28,022 --> 00:56:29,387
No, Dad.

666
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:33,118
You sure?

667
00:56:33,662 --> 00:56:35,220
Yes, Dad.

668
00:56:40,036 --> 00:56:42,062
I love you, Danny.

669
00:56:43,273 --> 00:56:45,867
I love you
more than anything else...

670
00:56:46,076 --> 00:56:48,636
...in the whole world...

671
00:56:49,414 --> 00:56:52,474
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

672
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,012
...never.

673
00:56:54,886 --> 00:56:56,946
You know that, don't you?

674
00:56:57,423 --> 00:56:58,981
Yes, Dad.

675
00:56:59,926 --> 00:57:01,018
Good.

676
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:30,728
Mom, are you in there?

677
00:59:49,993 --> 00:59:51,051
What happened?

678
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:52,489
Honey...

679
00:59:53,363 --> 00:59:54,762
...what's wrong?

680
01:00:02,941 --> 01:00:04,341
I had the most...

681
01:00:04,544 --> 01:00:07,138
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

682
01:00:09,082 --> 01:00:12,018
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It's okay, it's okay now.

683
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,585
Really.

684
01:00:18,859 --> 01:00:20,452
I dreamed that l...

685
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:23,096
...that I killed
you and Danny.

686
01:00:25,835 --> 01:00:28,066
But I didn't just kill you.

687
01:00:29,373 --> 01:00:32,137
I cut you up
into little pieces.

688
01:00:34,812 --> 01:00:36,336
My God.

689
01:00:37,048 --> 01:00:39,608
I must be losing my mind.

690
01:00:41,886 --> 01:00:44,515
Everything's going to be
all right.

691
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:49,322
Come on. Let's get up
off the floor.

692
01:00:57,171 --> 01:00:59,470
There. Now sit up.

693
01:01:00,108 --> 01:01:01,405
It's okay.

694
01:01:02,511 --> 01:01:03,944
It's okay.

695
01:01:08,018 --> 01:01:09,212
Danny!

696
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,454
Everything's okay!

697
01:01:11,655 --> 01:01:14,819
Just go play in your room
for a while.

698
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,219
Your dad's just got
a headache.

699
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,557
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

700
01:01:23,536 --> 01:01:26,471
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

701
01:01:26,673 --> 01:01:28,197
I'll be right back.

702
01:01:30,111 --> 01:01:32,170
Why don't you mind me?

703
01:01:38,787 --> 01:01:40,618
Oh, my God.

704
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:44,224
What happened to your neck?

705
01:01:46,163 --> 01:01:48,290
What happened to your neck?

706
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,234
You did this to him...

707
01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:21,101
...didn't you?!

708
01:02:22,938 --> 01:02:24,998
You son of a bitch!

709
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,073
You did this to him!

710
01:02:27,278 --> 01:02:28,711
Didn't you?!

711
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:31,709
How could you?!

712
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,679
How could you?!

713
01:04:03,557 --> 01:04:06,652
God! I'd give anything
for a drink.

714
01:04:09,298 --> 01:04:12,199
I'd give my goddamn soul...

715
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:14,893
...for just a glass of beer.

716
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:31,379
Hi, Lloyd.

717
01:04:34,928 --> 01:04:37,329
A little slow tonight,
isn't it?

718
01:04:42,202 --> 01:04:44,467
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

719
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:48,008
What will it be?

720
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:52,649
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

721
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:56,182
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

722
01:04:56,386 --> 01:04:59,287
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

723
01:04:59,489 --> 01:05:02,755
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.

724
01:05:03,461 --> 01:05:05,292
So here's what:

725
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:07,896
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

726
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,898
...a little glass and some ice.

727
01:05:11,104 --> 01:05:13,129
You can do that,
can't you, Lloyd?

728
01:05:13,573 --> 01:05:15,940
You're not too busy, are you?

729
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:19,001
No, sir.
I'm not busy at all.

730
01:05:19,513 --> 01:05:21,071
Good man.

731
01:05:21,382 --> 01:05:22,474
You set them up...

732
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,618
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

733
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:29,690
White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.

734
01:05:29,891 --> 01:05:32,053
White man's burden.

735
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:39,262
Say, Lloyd...

736
01:05:39,471 --> 01:05:42,235
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

737
01:05:42,574 --> 01:05:45,008
How's my credit
in this joint, anyway?

738
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:47,643
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

739
01:05:48,347 --> 01:05:49,974
That's swell.

740
01:05:50,182 --> 01:05:51,877
I like you, Lloyd.

741
01:05:52,085 --> 01:05:53,746
I always liked you.

742
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:56,287
You were always the best of them.

743
01:05:56,491 --> 01:05:58,857
Best goddamned bartender...

744
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,995
...from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine.

745
01:06:02,197 --> 01:06:04,427
Or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.

746
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,497
Thank you for saying so.

747
01:06:08,804 --> 01:06:13,333
Here's to 5 miserable months
on the wagon...

748
01:06:13,544 --> 01:06:17,605
...and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.

749
01:06:35,837 --> 01:06:38,305
How are things going,
Mr. Torrance?

750
01:06:39,641 --> 01:06:42,236
Things could be better.

751
01:06:43,746 --> 01:06:46,510
Things could be
a whole lot better.

752
01:06:47,383 --> 01:06:49,716
I hope it's nothing serious.

753
01:06:52,724 --> 01:06:54,715
Nothing serious.

754
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,921
Just a little problem with...

755
01:06:59,131 --> 01:07:02,259
...the old sperm bank
upstairs.

756
01:07:02,468 --> 01:07:04,835
Nothing I can't handle,
though.

757
01:07:05,038 --> 01:07:06,733
Thanks.

758
01:07:07,207 --> 01:07:08,196
Women.

759
01:07:08,408 --> 01:07:09,932
Can't live with them...

760
01:07:10,143 --> 01:07:11,974
...can't live without them.

761
01:07:15,183 --> 01:07:16,741
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

762
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:18,419
Words of...

763
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,145
...wisdom.

764
01:07:31,668 --> 01:07:34,899
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

765
01:07:35,106 --> 01:07:36,734
I didn't.

766
01:07:38,778 --> 01:07:43,374
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

767
01:07:43,984 --> 01:07:47,112
I love the little
son of a bitch.

768
01:07:48,722 --> 01:07:51,556
I'd do anything for him.

769
01:07:51,759 --> 01:07:54,557
Any fucking thing for him.

770
01:07:58,634 --> 01:08:01,195
But that bitch!

771
01:08:02,205 --> 01:08:03,900
As long as I live...

772
01:08:04,174 --> 01:08:07,576
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

773
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:20,023
I did hurt him once, okay?

774
01:08:20,393 --> 01:08:22,453
It was an accident.

775
01:08:22,763 --> 01:08:25,357
Completely unintentional.

776
01:08:26,633 --> 01:08:28,863
It could have happened
to anybody.

777
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:34,063
And it was three goddamn
years ago!

778
01:08:34,275 --> 01:08:37,108
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

779
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,782
All I tried to do was pull him up.

780
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:47,252
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

781
01:08:47,558 --> 01:08:48,786
I mean...

782
01:08:49,327 --> 01:08:52,854
...a few extra foot-pounds
of energy...

783
01:08:53,064 --> 01:08:55,898
...per second, per second.

784
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,920
Thank God you're here.

785
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,355
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

786
01:09:19,563 --> 01:09:22,088
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

787
01:09:22,299 --> 01:09:24,860
She tried to strangle Danny.

788
01:09:27,405 --> 01:09:29,805
Are you out of your fucking mind?

789
01:09:31,743 --> 01:09:33,769
It's the truth! Really.

790
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:35,970
I swear it.
Danny told me.

791
01:09:36,316 --> 01:09:38,181
He went up into
one of the bedrooms.

792
01:09:38,385 --> 01:09:41,844
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

793
01:09:42,056 --> 01:09:44,388
She tried to strangle him!

794
01:09:48,095 --> 01:09:49,859
Which room was it?

795
01:09:57,508 --> 01:09:59,635
From Channel 10 in Miami...

796
01:09:59,843 --> 01:10:02,209
...this is Newswatch
with Glen Rinker...

797
01:10:02,413 --> 01:10:06,612
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.

798
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:09,386
Good evening. I'm Glen Rinker,
Newswatch Ten.

799
01:10:09,587 --> 01:10:12,716
As Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...

800
01:10:12,925 --> 01:10:15,052
...bringing temperatures
to the 90s...

801
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:18,389
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.

802
01:10:18,598 --> 01:10:22,592
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell injust a few hours tonight.

803
01:10:22,804 --> 01:10:25,034
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.

804
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:28,209
Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.

805
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:30,310
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.

806
01:10:30,512 --> 01:10:32,275
Railroad tracks are frozen.

807
01:10:32,481 --> 01:10:34,506
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...

808
01:10:34,717 --> 01:10:38,279
...at least 3 have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.

809
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:40,787
The governor of Colorado
is expected...

810
01:10:40,992 --> 01:10:42,721
...to declare
a weather emergency.

811
01:10:42,928 --> 01:10:44,759
The National Guard
might be called out...

812
01:10:44,963 --> 01:10:46,157
...to clear streets and roads.

813
01:10:46,365 --> 01:10:48,595
Weather forecasters
predict more snow...

814
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,792
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...

815
01:10:51,004 --> 01:10:53,632
...with temperatures dropping
well below zero.

816
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,832
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.

817
01:10:57,043 --> 01:10:59,274
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.

818
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:01,449
Local beaches
should bejammed.

819
01:11:01,649 --> 01:11:03,674
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...

820
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:07,151
...will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.

821
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:43,476
We're sorry. Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

822
01:16:43,818 --> 01:16:46,946
If you need assistance,
please call the operator.

823
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:06,040
Yes, it's me.

824
01:17:06,244 --> 01:17:07,677
Thank God.

825
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:14,115
Did you find anything?

826
01:17:14,321 --> 01:17:17,051
No. Nothing at all.

827
01:17:17,658 --> 01:17:20,822
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

828
01:17:23,565 --> 01:17:27,057
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

829
01:17:27,269 --> 01:17:28,828
Yes, I did.

830
01:17:29,306 --> 01:17:31,103
And you didn't see anything at all?

831
01:17:31,308 --> 01:17:33,299
Absolutely nothing.

832
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:34,772
How is he?

833
01:17:34,978 --> 01:17:36,776
He's still asleep.

834
01:17:37,181 --> 01:17:38,307
Good.

835
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:47,216
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

836
01:17:51,699 --> 01:17:54,190
Are you sure it was the right room?

837
01:17:54,401 --> 01:17:57,564
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

838
01:17:57,771 --> 01:18:00,138
He must have gone in that room.

839
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,004
The door was open,
the lights were on.

840
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:07,980
I just don't understand it.

841
01:18:12,322 --> 01:18:15,349
What about those bruises
on his neck?

842
01:18:17,529 --> 01:18:19,861
Somebody did that to him.

843
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,573
I think...

844
01:18:31,245 --> 01:18:33,805
...he did it to himself.

845
01:18:39,821 --> 01:18:41,049
No.

846
01:18:41,723 --> 01:18:43,748
That's not possible.

847
01:18:49,066 --> 01:18:52,729
Once you rule out his version
of what happened...

848
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:55,565
...there is no other explanation.

849
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:57,372
Is there?

850
01:18:59,744 --> 01:19:02,646
It wouldn't be that different
from the episode...

851
01:19:02,848 --> 01:19:06,215
...that he had before
we came up here.

852
01:19:06,419 --> 01:19:07,647
Would it?

853
01:19:15,563 --> 01:19:18,556
Whatever the explanation is...

854
01:19:22,004 --> 01:19:23,403
...I think we...

855
01:19:23,606 --> 01:19:26,337
...have to get Danny out of here.

856
01:19:31,115 --> 01:19:32,947
Get him out of here?

857
01:19:37,122 --> 01:19:38,851
You mean...

858
01:19:39,891 --> 01:19:41,860
...just leave the hotel?

859
01:19:50,839 --> 01:19:52,306
It is so...

860
01:19:52,507 --> 01:19:54,941
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...

861
01:19:55,143 --> 01:19:57,669
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

862
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,440
When I'm really into my work!

863
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:04,610
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't I?

864
01:20:04,821 --> 01:20:08,552
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash.

865
01:20:08,759 --> 01:20:10,852
Any of that appeal to you?

866
01:20:12,064 --> 01:20:14,760
I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

867
01:20:14,967 --> 01:20:18,596
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.

868
01:21:36,529 --> 01:21:38,828
Good evening. Forest Service.

869
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:40,832
My name is Dick Hallorann.

870
01:21:41,034 --> 01:21:43,468
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.

871
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:45,798
Good evening.
What can I do for you?

872
01:21:46,007 --> 01:21:49,568
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

873
01:21:49,778 --> 01:21:53,077
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

874
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:56,878
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

875
01:21:57,087 --> 01:21:59,749
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

876
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:03,188
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

877
01:22:03,394 --> 01:22:05,055
And with this storm
and everything...

878
01:22:05,263 --> 01:22:08,164
...I'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

879
01:22:08,366 --> 01:22:10,358
...just to see if
everything's okay.

880
01:22:10,869 --> 01:22:12,166
I'll be glad to do that.

881
01:22:12,371 --> 01:22:15,169
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

882
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:17,401
Thank you very much.
I'll do that.

883
01:22:17,611 --> 01:22:19,044
All right, sir.

884
01:22:39,369 --> 01:22:41,338
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

885
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:43,006
Good evening.

886
01:23:07,569 --> 01:23:09,036
Hi, Lloyd.

887
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:11,103
Been away, but now I'm back.

888
01:23:11,374 --> 01:23:13,103
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

889
01:23:13,776 --> 01:23:14,765
It's good to see you.

890
01:23:14,978 --> 01:23:17,640
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

891
01:23:18,282 --> 01:23:20,012
What'll it be, sir?

892
01:23:20,819 --> 01:23:23,083
Hair of the dog that bit me.

893
01:23:24,489 --> 01:23:26,150
Bourbon on the rocks.

894
01:23:26,993 --> 01:23:28,392
That'll do her.

895
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:44,175
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

896
01:23:45,614 --> 01:23:47,582
No charge?

897
01:23:48,217 --> 01:23:50,209
Your money's no good here.

898
01:23:55,859 --> 01:23:57,588
Orders from the house.

899
01:24:00,799 --> 01:24:03,290
Orders from the house.

900
01:24:06,539 --> 01:24:08,530
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

901
01:24:10,743 --> 01:24:15,272
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

902
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:20,520
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

903
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,657
At least, not at this point.

904
01:24:27,463 --> 01:24:29,864
Anything you say, Lloyd.

905
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,291
Anything you say.

906
01:24:45,285 --> 01:24:47,753
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

907
01:24:48,855 --> 01:24:50,322
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

908
01:24:50,523 --> 01:24:53,084
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

909
01:24:54,328 --> 01:24:57,957
That's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

910
01:24:58,166 --> 01:25:00,965
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

911
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:02,296
Advocaat, is it?

912
01:25:02,505 --> 01:25:04,666
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...

913
01:25:04,874 --> 01:25:07,069
...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...

914
01:25:07,276 --> 01:25:09,802
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

915
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,946
Looks like you might have got a
spot of it on yourself...

916
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:15,140
...Jeevesy old boy.

917
01:25:15,352 --> 01:25:18,516
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

918
01:25:18,824 --> 01:25:21,224
Awfully nice of you to say.

919
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:24,528
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

920
01:25:24,731 --> 01:25:26,995
...before the fish and
goose soiree.

921
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,225
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

922
01:25:29,436 --> 01:25:30,767
Here. I'll just...

923
01:25:31,572 --> 01:25:33,836
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

924
01:25:34,042 --> 01:25:35,839
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

925
01:25:36,878 --> 01:25:40,508
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.

926
01:25:40,717 --> 01:25:41,979
All right. I'll just...

927
01:25:42,185 --> 01:25:46,383
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

928
01:25:46,956 --> 01:25:48,390
Won't keep you a moment.

929
01:25:48,592 --> 01:25:49,991
Fine.

930
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:54,725
What do they call you,
Jeevesy?

931
01:25:54,933 --> 01:25:57,493
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

932
01:26:02,275 --> 01:26:03,106
Grady?

933
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:04,641
Yes, sir.

934
01:26:05,813 --> 01:26:07,144
Delbert Grady.

935
01:26:07,347 --> 01:26:08,871
That's right, sir.

936
01:26:17,592 --> 01:26:19,026
Mr. Grady...

937
01:26:19,796 --> 01:26:21,889
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

938
01:26:22,099 --> 01:26:24,795
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

939
01:26:31,843 --> 01:26:33,674
It's coming off now, sir.

940
01:26:38,617 --> 01:26:40,175
Mr. Grady...

941
01:26:41,689 --> 01:26:44,157
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?

942
01:26:44,358 --> 01:26:47,156
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

943
01:26:50,198 --> 01:26:53,531
You a married man, are you,
Mr. Grady?

944
01:26:53,735 --> 01:26:54,565
Yes, sir.

945
01:26:54,769 --> 01:26:58,035
I have a wife and
two daughters, sir.

946
01:26:59,075 --> 01:27:00,599
And...

947
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:03,541
...where are they now?

948
01:27:03,747 --> 01:27:07,809
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

949
01:27:18,497 --> 01:27:20,898
You were the caretaker here.

950
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,361
I recognize you.

951
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,801
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

952
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,007
You...

953
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,007
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

954
01:27:35,517 --> 01:27:36,917
And...

955
01:27:37,554 --> 01:27:39,488
...then you blew your brains out.

956
01:27:49,401 --> 01:27:51,164
That's strange, sir.

957
01:27:52,171 --> 01:27:54,901
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

958
01:27:58,578 --> 01:28:00,444
Mr. Grady...

959
01:28:00,881 --> 01:28:04,214
...you were the caretaker here.

960
01:28:12,027 --> 01:28:14,791
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

961
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,395
But you...

962
01:28:19,135 --> 01:28:20,966
...are the caretaker.

963
01:28:23,242 --> 01:28:26,143
You've always been the caretaker.

964
01:28:29,047 --> 01:28:30,879
I should know, sir.

965
01:28:32,318 --> 01:28:34,912
I've always been here.

966
01:28:53,142 --> 01:28:55,338
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

967
01:28:55,579 --> 01:28:57,342
...that your son...

968
01:28:57,748 --> 01:29:00,444
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...

969
01:29:00,651 --> 01:29:02,847
...into this situation?

970
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:07,119
Did you know that?

971
01:29:13,366 --> 01:29:15,459
He is, Mr. Torrance.

972
01:29:17,805 --> 01:29:18,965
Who?

973
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,835
A nigger.

974
01:29:26,916 --> 01:29:28,315
A nigger?

975
01:29:31,054 --> 01:29:32,487
A nigger...

976
01:29:32,689 --> 01:29:33,782
...cook.

977
01:29:40,297 --> 01:29:41,560
How?

978
01:29:43,835 --> 01:29:45,598
Your son...

979
01:29:46,038 --> 01:29:48,837
...has a very great talent.

980
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:53,302
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

981
01:29:54,047 --> 01:29:57,279
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...

982
01:29:57,485 --> 01:29:59,453
...against your will.

983
01:30:07,997 --> 01:30:09,259
Well...

984
01:30:12,035 --> 01:30:15,096
...he is a very willful boy.

985
01:30:17,508 --> 01:30:19,909
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

986
01:30:20,112 --> 01:30:23,013
A very willful boy.

987
01:30:23,215 --> 01:30:24,546
A rather...

988
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,274
...naughty boy...

989
01:30:26,486 --> 01:30:29,684
...if I may be so bold, sir.

990
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:38,694
It's his mother.

991
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:42,302
She...

992
01:30:42,504 --> 01:30:44,496
...interferes.

993
01:30:47,611 --> 01:30:50,705
Perhaps they need a good...

994
01:30:50,914 --> 01:30:52,507
...talking-to.

995
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:53,780
If...

996
01:30:53,985 --> 01:30:56,749
...you don't mind my saying so.

997
01:30:57,555 --> 01:30:59,183
Perhaps...

998
01:30:59,725 --> 01:31:01,420
...a bit more.

999
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:05,858
My girls, sir...

1000
01:31:06,064 --> 01:31:09,865
...they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

1001
01:31:10,538 --> 01:31:14,441
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

1002
01:31:14,643 --> 01:31:17,305
...and tried to burn it down.

1003
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:20,041
But I...

1004
01:31:20,248 --> 01:31:22,216
...corrected them, sir.

1005
01:31:23,553 --> 01:31:27,683
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

1006
01:31:27,891 --> 01:31:29,153
...I...

1007
01:31:30,161 --> 01:31:32,254
...corrected her.

1008
01:31:46,513 --> 01:31:48,447
We have the Snowcat.

1009
01:31:51,853 --> 01:31:53,617
If the weather breaks...

1010
01:31:53,822 --> 01:31:55,585
...we might just be able...

1011
01:31:55,791 --> 01:31:57,656
...to get down the mountain.

1012
01:32:00,529 --> 01:32:03,499
I could call
the forest rangers first...

1013
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:04,997
...and...

1014
01:32:05,335 --> 01:32:07,200
...tell them that we're coming...

1015
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:08,731
....so that...

1016
01:32:08,939 --> 01:32:13,036
...they could start searching
for us in case we didn't make it.

1017
01:32:16,816 --> 01:32:18,977
And if Jack won't come with us...

1018
01:32:21,454 --> 01:32:25,186
...I'll just have to tell him that
we're going by ourselves.

1019
01:32:25,392 --> 01:32:27,360
That's all there is to it.

1020
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:30,220
Redrum.

1021
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,861
Redrum.

1022
01:32:44,114 --> 01:32:45,274
What's the matter, hon?

1023
01:32:45,482 --> 01:32:46,380
Redrum!

1024
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:48,643
Are you having a bad dream?

1025
01:32:54,593 --> 01:32:55,822
Hon?

1026
01:33:01,634 --> 01:33:05,537
Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.

1027
01:33:10,545 --> 01:33:12,070
Come on, hon.

1028
01:33:13,049 --> 01:33:14,482
Wake up.

1029
01:33:15,418 --> 01:33:17,682
You just had a bad dream.

1030
01:33:19,088 --> 01:33:21,216
Everything's okay.

1031
01:33:25,295 --> 01:33:29,164
Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.

1032
01:33:38,645 --> 01:33:40,442
Wake up!

1033
01:33:41,615 --> 01:33:42,947
Come on.

1034
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,674
Right now.

1035
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:46,517
Wake up!

1036
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,587
Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.

1037
01:34:04,708 --> 01:34:07,576
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1038
01:34:07,779 --> 01:34:10,714
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1039
01:34:11,017 --> 01:34:12,780
Are you receiving me?

1040
01:34:15,989 --> 01:34:19,447
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1041
01:34:19,793 --> 01:34:22,592
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1042
01:34:22,797 --> 01:34:24,458
Do you read me?

1043
01:34:28,836 --> 01:34:31,863
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1044
01:34:32,075 --> 01:34:34,635
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1045
01:34:34,844 --> 01:34:36,607
Are you receiving me?

1046
01:35:13,056 --> 01:35:14,921
Good evening. Forest service.

1047
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:17,356
This is Dick Hallorann again.

1048
01:35:17,562 --> 01:35:20,656
I called a while ago about
the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

1049
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:25,700
We tried to contact them several
times but they didn't answer.

1050
01:35:25,904 --> 01:35:29,499
Maybe they got their radio
turned off or they can't hear it.

1051
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:32,610
If you'd like, I'd be glad
to try again later on.

1052
01:35:33,114 --> 01:35:35,241
That's very nice of you.

1053
01:35:35,449 --> 01:35:37,212
I'll call you back later.

1054
01:35:37,418 --> 01:35:38,442
Bye.

1055
01:36:25,541 --> 01:36:28,568
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?

1056
01:36:28,778 --> 01:36:30,939
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.

1057
01:36:31,147 --> 01:36:32,739
Thank you very much.

1058
01:37:36,659 --> 01:37:37,591
Durkin's Garage.

1059
01:37:37,793 --> 01:37:38,919
Can I speak to Larry?

1060
01:37:39,128 --> 01:37:40,095
Speaking.

1061
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:42,887
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.

1062
01:37:43,165 --> 01:37:44,827
Dick! How you doing?

1063
01:37:45,035 --> 01:37:46,400
How's the weather down there?

1064
01:37:46,603 --> 01:37:49,766
I'm not in Florida.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.

1065
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:51,732
What are you doing there?

1066
01:37:52,176 --> 01:37:55,612
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.

1067
01:37:55,814 --> 01:37:57,441
What's the weather like there?

1068
01:37:58,083 --> 01:38:00,951
The snowplows are keeping things
moving in town...

1069
01:38:01,154 --> 01:38:03,088
...but the mountain roads
are blocked.

1070
01:38:03,623 --> 01:38:06,319
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat
to get up there.

1071
01:38:06,526 --> 01:38:08,358
Can you fix me up with one?

1072
01:38:08,562 --> 01:38:10,655
What's the big deal
about getting there today...

1073
01:38:10,865 --> 01:38:12,423
...especially in this weather?

1074
01:38:13,301 --> 01:38:16,760
Larry, just between you and me,
we got a very serious problem...

1075
01:38:16,973 --> 01:38:19,203
...with the people taking care
of the place.

1076
01:38:19,409 --> 01:38:23,278
They turned out to be
completely unreliable assholes.

1077
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,277
Ullman phoned me last night.

1078
01:38:25,482 --> 01:38:28,849
And I'm supposed to find out
if they have to be replaced.

1079
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:32,347
How long will it take you
to get here?

1080
01:38:32,691 --> 01:38:34,352
About five hours.

1081
01:38:34,559 --> 01:38:36,789
I'm going to rent a car
here at the airport.

1082
01:38:37,296 --> 01:38:39,026
Okay, I'll take care of it.

1083
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:42,065
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.

1084
01:38:42,269 --> 01:38:44,829
That's all right. Drive carefully.

1085
01:38:50,578 --> 01:38:53,843
You're with Hal and Charlie
on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.

1086
01:38:54,048 --> 01:38:56,609
And we have a bad day out there.

1087
01:38:56,819 --> 01:39:00,186
Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.

1088
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:01,880
Many mountain passes...

1089
01:39:02,092 --> 01:39:04,960
... Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...

1090
01:39:05,162 --> 01:39:08,461
...and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.

1091
01:39:08,666 --> 01:39:10,328
We hear from the news department...

1092
01:39:10,535 --> 01:39:13,732
...only a few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...

1093
01:39:13,939 --> 01:39:15,531
...and with storms like this...

1094
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:19,872
...I guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.

1095
01:39:20,047 --> 01:39:22,914
The storm will continue through
the day and the Weather Service...

1096
01:39:23,117 --> 01:39:25,586
...has declared a stockman's
and traveler's advisory...

1097
01:39:25,787 --> 01:39:28,585
...for all areas outlying
the Denver metro region.

1098
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:30,155
Get the cows in the barn.

1099
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:52,708
Hon?

1100
01:39:57,690 --> 01:40:00,124
Listen to me
for a minute, will you?

1101
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:07,629
I'm just going to go and
talk to Daddy for a few minutes...

1102
01:40:07,836 --> 01:40:09,861
...and I'll be right back.

1103
01:40:10,839 --> 01:40:13,365
I want you to just stay here...

1104
01:40:13,576 --> 01:40:16,067
...and watch your cartoons, okay?

1105
01:40:19,183 --> 01:40:20,651
Okay, hon?

1106
01:40:23,955 --> 01:40:26,822
Yes, Mrs. Torrance.

1107
01:40:35,601 --> 01:40:36,796
All right.

1108
01:40:38,872 --> 01:40:41,773
I'll be back
in just about five minutes.

1109
01:40:42,577 --> 01:40:44,910
I'm going to lock the door
behind me.

1110
01:44:11,289 --> 01:44:12,984
How do you like it?

1111
01:44:19,598 --> 01:44:21,122
How do you like it?

1112
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:33,741
What are you doing down here?

1113
01:44:38,121 --> 01:44:40,453
I just...

1114
01:44:40,923 --> 01:44:41,947
...wanted...

1115
01:44:42,392 --> 01:44:44,121
...to talk to you.

1116
01:44:46,498 --> 01:44:47,760
Okay.

1117
01:44:48,366 --> 01:44:49,833
Let's talk.

1118
01:44:59,645 --> 01:45:01,637
What do you want to talk about?

1119
01:45:09,558 --> 01:45:12,721
I can't really remember.

1120
01:45:13,529 --> 01:45:15,656
You can't remember.

1121
01:45:16,466 --> 01:45:17,797
No...

1122
01:45:18,168 --> 01:45:19,567
...I can't.

1123
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:28,140
Maybe it was about Danny?

1124
01:45:30,515 --> 01:45:33,212
Maybe it was about him.

1125
01:45:36,856 --> 01:45:40,156
I think we should discuss Danny.

1126
01:45:42,963 --> 01:45:44,760
I think...

1127
01:45:45,165 --> 01:45:48,932
...we should discuss
what should be done with him.

1128
01:45:53,642 --> 01:45:56,237
What should be done with him?

1129
01:46:01,218 --> 01:46:03,015
I don't know.

1130
01:46:03,521 --> 01:46:05,512
I don't think that's true.

1131
01:46:05,723 --> 01:46:08,317
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

1132
01:46:08,527 --> 01:46:10,222
...about what should be done
with Danny.

1133
01:46:10,429 --> 01:46:13,024
And I'd like to know
what they are.

1134
01:46:14,934 --> 01:46:16,731
Well, l...

1135
01:46:17,036 --> 01:46:21,440
...I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

1136
01:46:21,642 --> 01:46:24,941
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1137
01:46:27,182 --> 01:46:30,515
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1138
01:46:31,153 --> 01:46:32,518
As soon as possible?

1139
01:46:33,122 --> 01:46:35,455
"As soon as possible?"

1140
01:46:38,128 --> 01:46:39,561
Please.

1141
01:46:40,964 --> 01:46:44,230
You believe his health
might be at stake.

1142
01:46:45,803 --> 01:46:47,327
Yes.

1143
01:46:48,674 --> 01:46:51,303
And you are concerned about him.

1144
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,110
And are you concerned about me?

1145
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:58,111
Of course I am.

1146
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:00,549
Of course you are!

1147
01:47:00,755 --> 01:47:03,883
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

1148
01:47:04,091 --> 01:47:05,582
What are you talking about?

1149
01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:08,627
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

1150
01:47:08,831 --> 01:47:10,890
...thought about
my responsibilities?

1151
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,365
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

1152
01:47:13,571 --> 01:47:16,369
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

1153
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:18,471
Has is ever occurred to you...

1154
01:47:18,676 --> 01:47:22,169
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1st?

1155
01:47:22,414 --> 01:47:24,439
Does it matter to you at all...

1156
01:47:24,649 --> 01:47:27,743
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

1157
01:47:27,953 --> 01:47:31,082
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

1158
01:47:31,291 --> 01:47:33,885
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

1159
01:47:34,361 --> 01:47:36,386
Do you have the slightest idea...

1160
01:47:36,597 --> 01:47:39,829
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!

1161
01:47:40,201 --> 01:47:43,295
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

1162
01:47:43,504 --> 01:47:45,905
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

1163
01:47:46,108 --> 01:47:48,406
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!

1164
01:47:48,611 --> 01:47:50,135
Stay away from me!

1165
01:47:51,014 --> 01:47:52,072
Why?

1166
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:55,352
I just want to go back to my room.

1167
01:47:55,553 --> 01:47:56,815
Why?

1168
01:47:57,455 --> 01:47:58,319
Well...

1169
01:47:59,457 --> 01:48:01,483
...I'm very confused.

1170
01:48:02,628 --> 01:48:06,291
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

1171
01:48:07,332 --> 01:48:11,269
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

1172
01:48:11,472 --> 01:48:14,236
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

1173
01:48:15,209 --> 01:48:16,700
Stay away from me!

1174
01:48:17,045 --> 01:48:18,342
Please!

1175
01:48:19,114 --> 01:48:20,172
Don't hurt me.

1176
01:48:20,382 --> 01:48:21,713
I'm not going to hurt you.

1177
01:48:21,916 --> 01:48:23,110
Stay away from me!

1178
01:48:23,318 --> 01:48:24,183
Stay away!

1179
01:48:24,387 --> 01:48:25,376
Darling.

1180
01:48:25,588 --> 01:48:27,146
Light of my life.

1181
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:28,921
I'm not going to hurt you.

1182
01:48:29,125 --> 01:48:31,116
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

1183
01:48:31,329 --> 01:48:33,524
I said,
"I'm not going to hurt you."

1184
01:48:33,731 --> 01:48:36,495
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

1185
01:48:36,768 --> 01:48:39,738
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

1186
01:48:40,806 --> 01:48:42,364
Stay away from me!

1187
01:48:42,875 --> 01:48:43,899
Stay away from me!

1188
01:48:44,109 --> 01:48:46,509
I'm not going to hurt you.

1189
01:48:46,779 --> 01:48:48,304
Stay away from me!

1190
01:48:48,548 --> 01:48:49,606
Stay away!

1191
01:48:50,483 --> 01:48:51,711
Please!

1192
01:48:52,753 --> 01:48:54,516
Stop swinging the bat.

1193
01:48:54,723 --> 01:48:55,985
Stay away from me.

1194
01:48:56,758 --> 01:48:58,055
Put that bat down, Wendy.

1195
01:48:58,260 --> 01:48:59,750
Stop it!

1196
01:49:01,229 --> 01:49:02,355
Give me the bat.

1197
01:49:02,565 --> 01:49:03,691
Please!

1198
01:49:03,933 --> 01:49:06,128
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

1199
01:49:06,335 --> 01:49:07,393
Stop it!

1200
01:49:07,637 --> 01:49:09,070
Give me the bat.

1201
01:49:09,405 --> 01:49:11,033
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.

1202
01:49:11,241 --> 01:49:12,606
Please stop!

1203
01:49:12,811 --> 01:49:14,005
Give me the bat.

1204
01:49:14,212 --> 01:49:15,440
Stay away from me.

1205
01:49:15,714 --> 01:49:18,081
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.

1206
01:49:19,485 --> 01:49:20,509
Goddamn--!

1207
01:50:35,808 --> 01:50:37,504
What are you doing?

1208
01:50:40,313 --> 01:50:41,780
Wait a minute.

1209
01:50:43,183 --> 01:50:45,175
What are you doing?

1210
01:50:48,022 --> 01:50:49,250
What are you doing?

1211
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:04,630
Wait a minute!

1212
01:51:07,010 --> 01:51:08,603
What are you doing?

1213
01:51:08,847 --> 01:51:10,576
Open the door!

1214
01:51:11,883 --> 01:51:12,907
Goddamn it!

1215
01:51:13,117 --> 01:51:16,679
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

1216
01:51:20,393 --> 01:51:21,621
Wendy, listen.

1217
01:51:22,062 --> 01:51:24,998
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

1218
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:27,667
It'll be just like
nothing ever happened.

1219
01:51:42,353 --> 01:51:43,718
Baby.

1220
01:51:44,922 --> 01:51:48,222
I think you hurt my head
real bad.

1221
01:51:49,828 --> 01:51:51,489
I'm dizzy.

1222
01:51:52,497 --> 01:51:54,693
I need a doctor.

1223
01:52:01,575 --> 01:52:02,770
Honey.

1224
01:52:05,446 --> 01:52:07,778
Don't leave me in here.

1225
01:52:16,393 --> 01:52:18,294
I'm going to go now.

1226
01:52:21,365 --> 01:52:23,196
I'm going to try...

1227
01:52:23,401 --> 01:52:26,394
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

1228
01:52:27,105 --> 01:52:29,471
...in the Snowcat today.

1229
01:52:31,710 --> 01:52:33,542
I'll bring back a doctor.

1230
01:52:38,919 --> 01:52:40,785
I'm going to go now.

1231
01:52:48,229 --> 01:52:52,030
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

1232
01:52:53,502 --> 01:52:56,096
You're not going anywhere.

1233
01:52:57,775 --> 01:53:01,905
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

1234
01:53:06,518 --> 01:53:08,213
Go check it out.

1235
01:53:10,356 --> 01:53:12,552
Go check it out!

1236
01:53:15,929 --> 01:53:17,863
Go check it out.

1237
01:55:05,725 --> 01:55:08,125
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

1238
01:55:08,863 --> 01:55:10,831
Delbert Grady.

1239
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:13,991
Grady?

1240
01:55:34,359 --> 01:55:36,190
Hello, Grady.

1241
01:55:40,867 --> 01:55:42,664
Mr. Torrance...

1242
01:55:44,604 --> 01:55:48,336
...I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

1243
01:55:49,076 --> 01:55:51,567
...business we discussed.

1244
01:55:58,287 --> 01:56:01,222
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

1245
01:56:02,091 --> 01:56:06,153
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

1246
01:56:07,031 --> 01:56:09,761
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

1247
01:56:10,267 --> 01:56:12,099
I wonder.

1248
01:56:13,271 --> 01:56:15,364
I have my doubts.

1249
01:56:16,575 --> 01:56:20,808
I, and others, have come
to believe...

1250
01:56:21,013 --> 01:56:24,005
...that your heart is not in this.

1251
01:56:24,651 --> 01:56:27,177
That you haven't the belly for it.

1252
01:56:33,361 --> 01:56:37,662
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

1253
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:40,434
That's all I ask.

1254
01:56:41,972 --> 01:56:46,239
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

1255
01:56:46,444 --> 01:56:47,911
Somewhat more...

1256
01:56:48,112 --> 01:56:50,080
...resourceful.

1257
01:56:50,349 --> 01:56:53,113
She seems to have got
the better of you.

1258
01:56:56,355 --> 01:56:59,018
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

1259
01:56:59,759 --> 01:57:01,920
Only for the moment.

1260
01:57:03,831 --> 01:57:07,996
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

1261
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:11,933
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

1262
01:57:12,507 --> 01:57:14,066
I fear...

1263
01:57:14,343 --> 01:57:16,903
...that is the only thing to do.

1264
01:57:20,383 --> 01:57:22,477
There's nothing
I look forward to...

1265
01:57:22,686 --> 01:57:26,588
...with greater pleasure,
Mr. Grady.

1266
01:57:27,992 --> 01:57:30,723
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

1267
01:57:32,197 --> 01:57:34,222
I give you my word.

1268
01:58:46,351 --> 01:58:48,912
Redrum.

1269
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:52,416
Redrum.

1270
02:01:00,409 --> 02:01:01,967
Danny, stop it!

1271
02:01:58,777 --> 02:02:00,244
I'm home.

1272
02:02:37,590 --> 02:02:40,457
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1273
02:03:06,023 --> 02:03:07,888
I can't get out.

1274
02:03:08,693 --> 02:03:09,819
Run!

1275
02:03:10,661 --> 02:03:12,094
Run and hide!

1276
02:03:12,632 --> 02:03:13,758
Run!

1277
02:03:13,966 --> 02:03:15,194
Quick!

1278
02:03:16,903 --> 02:03:21,432
Little pigs, little pigs,
let me come in.

1279
02:03:27,181 --> 02:03:30,583
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

1280
02:03:32,121 --> 02:03:34,180
Then I'll huff...

1281
02:03:34,390 --> 02:03:36,291
...and I'll puff...

1282
02:03:36,493 --> 02:03:38,552
...and I'll blow your house in!

1283
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:54,845
Please!

1284
02:03:55,582 --> 02:03:57,345
Don't!

1285
02:03:58,017 --> 02:03:59,542
Don't!

1286
02:04:18,142 --> 02:04:19,370
Stop it!

1287
02:04:23,615 --> 02:04:25,173
Here's Johnny!

1288
02:07:07,140 --> 02:07:08,368
Hello?

1289
02:07:13,815 --> 02:07:15,578
Anybody here?

1290
02:07:37,677 --> 02:07:39,235
Hello?

1291
02:07:51,558 --> 02:07:53,390
Anybody here?

1292
02:08:23,363 --> 02:08:25,298
Anybody here?

1293
02:09:06,314 --> 02:09:08,009
Danny-boy!

1294
02:11:48,872 --> 02:11:50,806
I'm coming!

1295
02:11:53,310 --> 02:11:55,245
I'm coming, Dan!

1296
02:12:56,050 --> 02:12:58,451
Great party, isn't it?

1297
02:13:16,107 --> 02:13:18,337
I'm coming!!

1298
02:13:20,913 --> 02:13:23,211
You can't get away!

1299
02:13:27,087 --> 02:13:29,579
I'm right behind you!

1300
02:17:27,969 --> 02:17:29,995
- Mommy!
- Danny, come here!

1301
02:17:31,208 --> 02:17:32,937
Mommy.

1302
02:17:41,286 --> 02:17:42,685
Where...?

1303
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:08,000
