1
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:08,240
Welcome to "Sunset Boulevard".
I'm Ed Sikov,

2
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:12,605
the author of "On Sunset Boulevard:
The Life and Times of Billy Wilder".

3
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:17,841
This is the cut of the film seen by most
audiences on its release in 1950.

4
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:22,478
But this is not the way that
"Sunset Boulevard" originally began.

5
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:27,846
Paramount Pictures previewed Wilder's
original cut in Evanston, Illinois.

6
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:31,124
Audiences there saw
a very different opening sequence,

7
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:33,926
and they rejected it, violently.

8
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:38,000
The credits began in a similar way
with this moving camera shot,

9
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:42,683
but then Wilder took us
to the LA County morgue,

10
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:46,203
which is where we meet Joe Gillis,
played by William Holden.

11
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:51,202
He's got an identification tag
on his toe because he's dead.

12
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:54,245
From an early draft
of the script, quote:

13
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:59,125
"For a moment,
the room is semi-dark."

14
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:04,805
"As the music becomes 'astral',
a glow emanates from the corpses."

15
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:09,757
"The long row of tags sways in the
breeze from the ventilator system."

16
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:14,443
"A man's voice says, 'Don't be
scared, there's a lot of us here."'

17
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,360
"Gillis says, 'I'm not scared."'

18
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:21,315
"His head doesn't move, but his
eyes wander to a nearby slab."

19
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:26,720
"There, under a transparent sheet,
lies a fat man aged 60 or so."

20
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:30,960
"His eyes are open too,
and directed at Gillis."

21
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:34,324
"The fat man says,
'How did you die?"'

22
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:37,763
"Gillis: 'What difference does it make?"'

23
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:40,077
"They discuss how the fat man died,"

24
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:44,206
"then Gillis says, 'Me, I drowned."'

25
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:49,043
Then Wilder got even
more morbid and risky, quote:

26
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:52,916
"On a slab against the wall
lies a blond boy of eleven."

27
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:57,160
"His swollen child's face also peering
through a transparent sheet."

28
00:01:57,327 --> 00:02:02,560
"The boy says, 'So did I. I drowned,
right off the pier at Ocean Park."'

29
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:05,366
"'lt's only bad
when you try not to swallow."'

30
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:08,564
"'lf you let it in your mouth,
it doesn't hurt."'

31
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:11,480
"'I wish my folks
would come and get me."'

32
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,320
"Fat man asks Gillis,
'Where did you drown? The ocean?"'

33
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:17,047
"Gillis says, 'No, a swimming pool."'

34
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:19,675
"Fat man says,
'A husky fellow like you?"'

35
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:26,639
"Gillis: 'I had a few extra holes in me.
Two in the chest, one in the stomach."'

36
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:33,203
When, in Evanston, Illinois, the corpses
started talking, the audience laughed.

37
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:38,202
Derisively. Wilder was shocked, and later
said, "I sat there a few minutes,"

38
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:40,280
"then left the theatre."

39
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:44,839
"I sat on one of the steps leading
down to the toilet."

40
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:47,077
"That was a black moment in my life."

41
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:51,525
"A lady came down who had
also left the theatre and said,"

42
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:56,602
"'Have you ever seen such shit? '
I said, 'Never."'

43
00:02:56,767 --> 00:03:00,726
So Wilder reshot
the opening sequence.

44
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:07,235
Wilder and his collaborators, Charles
Bracket and D M Marshman Jr,

45
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:10,319
wanted their film to be
an "Inside Hollywood" thing,

46
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:13,285
the sights and sounds
of Greater Tinseltown,

47
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:16,837
so they used many real locations
to get across the flavour.

48
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:20,761
Gillis's apartment is above
Franklin and lvar Streets,

49
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:24,203
it's still there,
it's called the "Alto Nido".

50
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:27,359
Wilder had been living
in Hollywood since 1934.

51
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:30,439
He was born in Poland,
grew up in Vienna,

52
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:35,880
worked in Berlin as a screenwriter,
then went to Paris and Hollywood.

53
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:39,676
He loved Hollywood,
it was his kind of town:

54
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:46,116
a little bit hard, a little bit mean, where
you could make it big or die trying,

55
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:50,439
a place where dreams
can both come true and die.

56
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:53,679
That's the case with Joe Gillis,
as we'll see.

57
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:57,999
Gillis's lack of success
was familiar, even to Billy Wilder.

58
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:01,842
When Billy made "Sunset
Boulevard" he was a hot director,

59
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:08,321
but back in Berlin in the '20s he was
a nobody, unable to sell his scripts.

60
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:11,081
He had to start again
in Hollywood too,

61
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:14,319
hustling ideas to people
who didn't want them.

62
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,162
This scene with Gillis
also sets him up as an operator,

63
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:21,285
a tough-talking, sarcastic,
would-be hotshot.

64
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:24,405
"You say the cutest things,"
he snarls to the repo guy.

65
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:27,923
That's something Wilder himself
would have said.

66
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:32,763
Wilder arrived in the US speaking
little English, but he learnt quickly.

67
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:35,077
He loved the rhythms
of American speech.

68
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:40,116
Gillis's line, "Hear about Rudy, the
shoeshine man?" is a great example.

69
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:45,998
"Rudy never asked about your finances.
He'd look at your heels and know."

70
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:48,920
It's a kind of street poetry.

71
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:55,165
Paramount pervades this film, quite
a daring thing for Wilder and the studio,

72
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:58,285
given this movie's bleak
vision of life in Hollywood.

73
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:02,963
When Gillis goes to Paramount begging
work, he enters not by the main gate,

74
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:07,803
but by the smaller, more beautiful gate
at the corner of Melrose and Bronson.

75
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,795
Paramount is where Wilder
made his last six pictures:

76
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:16,245
"The Major and the Minor", "Five
Graves to Cairo", "Double Indemnity",

77
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:20,719
"The Lost Weekend", "The Emperor
Waltz" and "A Foreign Affair".

78
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:25,403
It shows Wilder's clout that Paramount
allowed "Sunset Boulevard" at all.

79
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:29,242
It was the most bitter film
about Hollywood then made,

80
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:31,443
and it remains so still.

81
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:35,759
Paramount could have made Wilder
create a fictional studio, but they didn't.

82
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:38,805
We really do see Paramount
here and elsewhere.

83
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:44,439
That's how confident they were of
Wilder in 1949, when the film was shot.

84
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:49,203
Now, Gillis calls Sheldrake "a smart
producer with the ulcers to prove it".

85
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:56,079
Wilder battled with executives, but he
knew the difficulties in making a film.

86
00:05:56,247 --> 00:06:03,119
It's stressful, which is why Sheldrake
is burping and guzzling antacid here.

87
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:07,361
Enter Betty Schaefer,
played by Nancy Olson.

88
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:11,884
This was only her second picture,
but she was nominated for an Oscar,

89
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:14,481
in the category of
"Best Supporting Actress".

90
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:17,798
She was paired with William Holden
in three other films:

91
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:22,916
"Union Station", "Submarine
Command" and "Force of Arms".

92
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:28,525
Holden made a splash in 1939 with
"Golden Boy" as a boxing violinist,

93
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:32,885
but after that he was stuck in
forgettable, nice-guy roles.

94
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:36,357
He'd made almost 25 pictures
before "Sunset Boulevard",

95
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:39,837
but audiences still didn't
really know William Holden,

96
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:44,922
so they could accept him easily as an
unknown, unsuccessful screenwriter.

97
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:51,003
Now, here we have to question Gillis's
description of Sheldrake as "smart".

98
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:58,244
"We always look for a Betty Hutton,"
he says. "Is this a Betty Hutton?"

99
00:06:58,407 --> 00:07:02,195
The idea of Betty Hutton
playing a rookie shortstop

100
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:05,757
is a joke of Wilder's
requiring some explanation.

101
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:10,045
Gillis's script, "Bases Loaded",
is obviously not a "Betty Hutton".

102
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:15,565
Hutton was the bright and winning star
of "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"

103
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,003
and the great musical
"Annie, Get Your Gun".

104
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:26,759
Gillis gets the joke. Such lines
show the comic side of this film.

105
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:32,679
After Sheldrake proposes
"Bases Loaded" as a "Betty Hutton",

106
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:37,682
Gillis asks him, "Are you trying to be
funny, because I'm all out of laughs."

107
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:41,317
Gillis may be out of laughs,
but Wilder never was,

108
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:44,081
especially not in "Sunset Boulevard".

109
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:15,117
Here we are at Schwab's Drugstore.

110
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,757
This "combination office,
Kaffeeklatsch and waiting room"

111
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:22,283
is another one of Wilder's
"Inside Hollywood" locations.

112
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:27,760
Hollywood lore has it that Lana Turner
was discovered there drinking a soda.

113
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:33,047
Originally, the Schwab's scene came
with a notable Hollywood personality.

114
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:37,997
Wilder filmed this scene with the
gossip-columnist Sidney Skolsky,

115
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:41,364
but it ended up
on the cutting-room floor.

116
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:09,395
In a way, this golf course is still
another central Hollywood locale.

117
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:14,846
It is a place where film industry
relationships are nurtured.

118
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,966
Gillis doesn't get that at all,
calling his agent a "big faker".

119
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:23,325
He says, "He was hard at work in
Bel Air, making with the golf sticks."

120
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:27,366
"Making with the golf sticks"
is not how Gillis would talk.

121
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:31,679
It's pure Billy Wilder. It's the syntax
of an Eastern European Jew,

122
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:37,001
not a Mid-Westerner like Gillis
or the Pasadena-bred William Holden.

123
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:40,876
As for the agent's reference to the
"Mocambo-Romanov's rut",

124
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,766
these were two well-known
nightspots in Hollywood.

125
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:47,681
They were frequented by big-name
people with big-budget wallets.

126
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:51,920
Wilder himself loved these places
and the power scene they represented.

127
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:58,002
Something about the title of this film:

128
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:01,796
Sunset Boulevard is a famous
avenue in Los Angeles.

129
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:07,246
It goes from Silverlake to the Pacific
Ocean, over which the sun does set.

130
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:11,241
But Sunset Boulevard also refers
to the characters in this film,

131
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:13,682
particularly the one
we're about to meet.

132
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:17,157
She's been nearing the end
of her day for some time.

133
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:20,000
Gillis also seems
near his end in Hollywood.

134
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:25,799
He dreads returning home in disgrace,
having failed in his dreams.

135
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:32,077
Now, you'd never call Billy Wilder
a great action-film director,

136
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:35,000
but this is pretty effective
as a chase sequence,

137
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,682
and it's made all the more tense
by Franz Waxman's score.

138
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:42,317
Waxman had known Billy
since Berlin in the early '30s.

139
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:45,800
Like Wilder, he left Germany
to escape the Nazis.

140
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,765
Some thugs beat him up on the street,

141
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:54,763
which provided physical incentive
to leave for Paris as soon as possible.

142
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:16,566
Now, is it an element
of chance, or fate, or both,

143
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:19,195
that leads Joe Gillis
into this driveway?

144
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:24,725
His tyre blow-out appears a blessing,
causing him to out-fox the repo men.

145
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:28,675
But then... I don't want
to get ahead of myself.

146
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:36,964
The house that Wilder found
for this location shooting

147
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:40,403
was not located in the 10000
block of Sunset Boulevard

148
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,478
as the script has it,

149
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:47,118
but at the corner of Wilshire and
Irving Boulevards, six miles away.

150
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:52,566
It was owned by J Paul Getty's ex-wife,
but she hadn't lived there for years.

151
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:58,677
It was the kind of house "crazy movie
people built in the crazy '20s".

152
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,716
Unfortunately this one, like most
of them, was later torn down.

153
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:29,485
Coming up is another example
of Wilder's street-poetic writing style.

154
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:31,717
"Miss Havisham,
taking it out on the world"

155
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:34,276
"because she'd been given the go-by."

156
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:38,599
It's not exactly how English professors
describe Charles Dickens's character,

157
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:42,316
but it works really well,
and it sounds terrific.

158
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:47,998
Notice the oblique way
Wilder introduces,

159
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:52,718
or, rather, re-introduces Gloria
Swanson to movie audiences in 1950.

160
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:11,077
Here she is, in long shot,
through the blinds,

161
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:16,162
with sunglasses covering her eyes,
but a beam of light on her face.

162
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:19,401
He's drawing out this introduction,
teasing us with it.

163
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:22,798
"Who is this woman?"
we find ourselves asking.

164
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:27,959
As I see it, this is when
the film starts to turn comical.

165
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:30,960
It's weird comedy,
but comedy nonetheless.

166
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:34,005
Gillis is entering a demented
fun-house world here,

167
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:38,319
and the nightmare is that,
once he enters, he can't escape.

168
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:41,843
Max, the butler, is played by
the extraordinary Erich von Stroheim,

169
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:47,001
who directed such classic films as
"Blind Husbands", "Foolish Wives",

170
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:52,082
and his masterpiece "Greed",
originally filmed as a seven-hour film.

171
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:57,446
It was cut to a quarter of that length,
helping to ruin Stroheim's career.

172
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:03,606
By the 1940s, Stroheim was reduced
to playing in B-pictures such as

173
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:09,842
"The Mask of Diijon", at the end
of which he beheads himself.

174
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:14,046
Look at Holden's gesture here.
That is a comic double-take.

175
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:35,440
And here she is: Norma Desmond.
Just look at her.

176
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:40,078
Look at her clothes,
look at her room...

177
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:46,400
Look at the dead body on the
massage table in front of the fire.

178
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:50,162
"He always liked fires,
and poking at them with a stick."

179
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:56,118
Who is this corpse? This is black
comedy, pure and not-so-simple.

180
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:06,606
Oh...

181
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:12,126
In real life, Gloria Swanson
was not like Norma Desmond,

182
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:15,279
though she later wrote that
she knew who she was playing,

183
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,166
and her character clearly
had much to do with herself.

184
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:23,401
It's a fantastic performance by Swanson,
who wasn't the crazy diva she plays,

185
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:28,197
but a hard-working woman who kept
busy after her screen career ended.

186
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:31,279
She ran a company
and had a radio show in New York.

187
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:35,440
She was by no means
the reclusive lunatic we see here.

188
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:40,723
This is one of the most quoted lines
from "Sunset Boulevard".

189
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:46,357
"You used to be big," Gillis says,

190
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:49,758
and Norma is not pleased
to hear that.

191
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:06,761
"I am big," she corrects him.
"It's the pictures that got small."

192
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:11,364
But what's usually missing when
people quote it is the punchline:

193
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:14,758
"Uh-huh. I knew there was
something wrong with them."

194
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:16,997
In any case, Norma Desmond is big.

195
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:20,682
Her gestures are oversized,
her emotions even more so.

196
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:25,875
She's grandiose and unnatural-looking,
given her excessive make-up.

197
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:30,723
By 1950, acting was more naturalistic
than it was in the silent era,

198
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:35,836
when actors relied on big gestures to
get their characters' emotions across.

199
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:41,445
In fact, Holden had been playing
guy-next-door types for the last ten years.

200
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:46,476
Both his characters and pictures were
small compared to Norma Desmond.

201
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:51,482
It doesn't take much for Norma
to start railing against the film industry.

202
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:55,117
She's obviously quite mad here,
but she has a point.

203
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:59,963
Gillis has another Wilderesque smart
remark to make, this time about talk.

204
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:04,006
"That's where the popcorn comes in.
You buy a bag and plug up your ears."

205
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:09,036
He follows up with another crack
like Wilder would make:

206
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:11,721
"Sh. You'll wake the monkey."

207
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,837
But, as we're about to see,
Joe Gillis is essentially a sell-out.

208
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:18,805
He's going to be working
for this nutcase.

209
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:23,961
She offers him a job and he takes it.
And he hates himself for it.

210
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,039
This is a recurrent theme
in Wilder's work:

211
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:30,005
people who sell out
in some form or another.

212
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:33,603
There's a sense of self-contempt
that pervades Wilder's films.

213
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:37,521
Two of his best films to come,
"Ace in the Hole" in 1951

214
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:43,239
and "Stalag 17" in 1953, are about
men who'd do anything to get ahead,

215
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:47,241
even, or especially,
if it's completely immoral.

216
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,559
And there, of course,
is her screenplay. A lot of it.

217
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:18,285
Norma's reaction to the word
"comeback" is also justifiably famous.

218
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,402
"I hate that word," she cries.
"It's a return."

219
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,922
Oh, that's what it is.

220
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:35,276
In this scene, Wilder's camera dwells
on the creepiness of the mansion.

221
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:41,477
The overblown and antiquated quality,
the sheer absurd excess it represents.

222
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:45,481
The house is just an architectural
extension of Norma herself.

223
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:48,559
It's an expression of her character.

224
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:55,075
Notice what the script is about.
As she says, "Salome. What a woman."

225
00:18:55,247 --> 00:19:01,004
Now that's hilarious. Salome gets
John the Baptist's head served to her

226
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:06,036
which is also what Norma Desmond...
but I'm getting ahead of myself again.

227
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:09,636
Watch how these two people interact:

228
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:14,198
Norma Desmond, from another era,
and Joe Gillis, Hollywood 1950.

229
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:19,725
A lot of the tension comes from
the interplay of two styles of acting,

230
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:21,798
competing performance styles:

231
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:25,164
Norma's, the colossal expressivity
of the silent era;

232
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:29,286
Joe's, the muted, underplayed
style of postwar Hollywood.

233
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:55,006
This is an amazing posture
Norma assumes here.

234
00:19:55,167 --> 00:20:01,197
That cigarette holder, that claw.
It seems to suggest a vampire.

235
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:06,043
It's also worth mentioning Edith Head's
costuming, which is spectacular.

236
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:09,802
Head's problem was to dress
a character who is out of time,

237
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,242
but also rich enough to buy anything,

238
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:15,399
including the most expensive
clothes in Beverly Hills.

239
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:20,846
So Norma's clothing had to be in style
and out-of-date at the same time.

240
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:24,204
Edith Head solved this
by mixing glamorous postwar styles

241
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,801
with the odd throwback
element here and there.

242
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:30,164
A beautiful hat trimmed
in outrageous feathers, for example,

243
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:32,522
and, certainly, a lot of leopard skin.

244
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:38,560
The doorbell rings and it's time for,
as Gillis says, "comedy relief".

245
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:43,676
The monkey mortician has shown up,
so we don't forget the corpse upstairs.

246
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:58,636
As Gillis reads his script, he's saying
he's concocting a plot of his own.

247
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:03,801
But in fact, he hasn't. Norma Desmond
has beaten him to the punch.

248
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:07,596
He's been trapped in Norma's world
since coming in the door.

249
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:14,002
In other words, he's taken the place
of the old chimp, or "chump".

250
00:21:15,247 --> 00:21:17,681
While Norma is busy
trapping poor Joe,

251
00:21:17,847 --> 00:21:23,365
I'd like to mention that when Wilder had
no money in Berlin in the late 1920s,

252
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:26,485
he worked as a dancing
gigolo at the Hotel Eden,

253
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:30,037
waltzing ladies around
the dance floor for pay.

254
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:34,803
He found it demeaning.
Many of his films are about sell-outs,

255
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:40,087
men and women who sell themselves,
both literally and figuratively.

256
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:43,284
Joe Gillis ends up doing both.

257
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:49,682
As demented as Norma may be,
she has the authority, the power.

258
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:48,486
Here again, she's setting that trap
and he's walking right into it.

259
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:08,843
What Max is about to tell Joe
in the scene above the garage

260
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:13,125
is also true of Gloria Swanson
in the 1920s.

261
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:17,041
She was a huge star
who was treated like royalty.

262
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:19,277
As Wilder himself once said,

263
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:25,044
"This was a star who was carried from
her dressing room to the sound stage."

264
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:34,759
Gillis's remark about Max is also true
about Erich von Stroheim:

265
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:37,680
"I pegged him as slightly cuckoo too."

266
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:40,441
Stroheim was slightly cuckoo.

267
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:46,000
He had a thing for sexual kinkiness
in the films he directed himself.

268
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:18,805
Wilder and his co-writers,
Bracket and Marshman,

269
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:21,925
created a classical
screenplay in three acts,

270
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:27,207
and Wilder will now show that
the end of act one has arrived.

271
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:13,200
After we see the rats
in the empty pool...

272
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:20,237
After Wilder shows us
the monkey's burial...

273
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:34,036
Since Gillis has taken the monkey's
place, we can safely bid bye-bye to it.

274
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:41,205
Gillis says, "It was all very queer,
but queerer things were yet to come."

275
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:49,202
With that, the curtain falls, and the
first act of "Sunset Boulevard" is over.

276
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:53,679
The second act also begins
with voice-over narration,

277
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:57,522
as Gillis explains
his situation to us.

278
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:51,125
The shot of hands playing the organ
is unusual for Billy Wilder.

279
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:55,326
It calls attention to itself
as arty and stylistic.

280
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:58,160
Wilder favoured less
showy shots than this,

281
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:01,160
but he obviously wanted
to show the baroque,

282
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:05,161
even Grand Guignol nature
of Norma Desmond's warped world.

283
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:10,879
It's an extreme world, expressed here
by those hands in extreme close-up.

284
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:18,356
Look at the <i>mise en scène</i> in general:
the setting and props, in particular.

285
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:23,282
Norma has surrounded herself
with hundreds of pictures of herself.

286
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:26,325
She literally lives in her own world.

287
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:31,003
Narcissistic, unable to distinguish
between the images of herself

288
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:34,159
and what she has actually become.

289
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:47,519
And what is she wearing
around her neck?

290
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:10,524
As Gillis blue-pencils
Norma's awful script,

291
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:13,281
and as she reacts badly
to the changes,

292
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:19,761
it's worth mentioning that Wilder rarely
let his actors change his dialogue,

293
00:28:19,927 --> 00:28:25,479
and, in fact, he sometimes timed
their line deliveries with a stopwatch.

294
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:29,358
Later, during the production
of "Some Like It Hot",

295
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:33,645
Wilder held up filming deciding
whether to allow Jack Lemmon

296
00:28:33,807 --> 00:28:37,163
to repeat the simple line:
"Now you're talking."

297
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:41,718
Despite the fact Wilder was a great
screenwriter and Desmond is not,

298
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:45,516
maybe Billy is identifying
with her a bit here.

299
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:55,279
Again, watch this incredible
performance by Gloria Swanson.

300
00:28:55,447 --> 00:29:01,283
Drag queens cannot get this across
when impersonating Norma Desmond.

301
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:06,441
She's hilarious, even ridiculous,
but she's not a total caricature.

302
00:29:06,607 --> 00:29:09,724
Swanson's Norma Desmond
is still a great actress.

303
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:14,756
Larger than life and able to sustain
that gigantic quality very well.

304
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:17,122
Norma was correct earlier on:

305
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:20,882
it is the pictures that got small
after the silent era.

306
00:29:21,047 --> 00:29:25,757
But that doesn't mean her
silent screen-style acting is a joke.

307
00:29:51,927 --> 00:29:55,476
The film they are about
to watch is called "Queen Kelly",

308
00:29:55,647 --> 00:30:01,085
which starred Gloria Swanson and
was directed by Erich von Stroheim.

309
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:09,401
According to Wilder, it was Stroheim's
idea to use this footage.

310
00:30:44,687 --> 00:30:49,477
You can see here how gorgeous
Swanson was in her youth.

311
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,842
And how photogenic.

312
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:57,565
"We had faces," she says,
and she's right.

313
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:02,283
It's worth noting that "Queen Kelly"
was a disaster commercially,

314
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:04,756
in fact, it was never completed.

315
00:31:04,927 --> 00:31:08,363
It was another nail
in the coffin of Swanson's career

316
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:12,315
and it basically ended
Stroheim's career as a director.

317
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:20,921
Just to mention, some critics have
called "Sunset Boulevard" a film noir...

318
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:27,840
...but as you'll see, the lighting alone
makes it a monster movie at times.

319
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:52,640
And here we meet the waxworks,
Norma's friends.

320
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:15,599
First, Anna Q Nilsson, a Swedish
actress, a precursor to Greta Garbo,

321
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,759
H B Warner, a fine dramatic actor,

322
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:21,077
and then, the great Buster Keaton,

323
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:26,560
one of the two great comedians of the
silent screen, the other being Chaplin.

324
00:32:41,687 --> 00:32:44,804
Wilder had approached another
silent star, William Haines,

325
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:48,357
who became a renowned
interior designer in Hollywood,

326
00:32:48,527 --> 00:32:52,202
but Haines turned him down.
"No mascara," he told Billy.

327
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:57,717
Aside from the spectacle of three huge
stars now reduced to "waxworks",

328
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:01,641
look how dreadfully Norma
belittles Joe in this scene.

329
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:07,279
She's emasculating him just as the
repo men come to take away his car.

330
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:13,522
He calls it a matter of life and death,
as the loss of a car in LA could be.

331
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:18,966
This scene marks the end of whatever
sense of independence Gillis has left.

332
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:23,917
He's forced to realise here just how
much of a kept boy he has become.

333
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:25,842
And here it is: Norma's fabulous
1932 Isotta Fraschini.

334
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:30,402
"The whole thing was upholstered
in leopard skin," Gillis comments.

335
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:33,206
It's gaudy, almost like a bordello,

336
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:38,964
and I think Wilder presents Gillis here
as a kept boy in a male harem of one.

337
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:58,797
And, of course, she starts in on
his clothes. She's picking on him.

338
00:34:59,527 --> 00:35:02,166
He's humiliated.

339
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:12,997
He can't even chew gum.

340
00:35:17,687 --> 00:35:19,723
So off we go to the haberdashers,

341
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:24,517
where Gillis gets some new duds
and a lot more humiliation.

342
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:36,196
The salespeople here obviously know
what's going on in this relationship.

343
00:35:40,887 --> 00:35:43,924
Apparently, they've seen
this sort of thing before.

344
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:49,726
This guy tells Joe to "take the vicuña
coat as long as the lady is paying",

345
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:54,165
and Wilder tracks forward on that
vicuña line, very far forward.

346
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:58,559
It's funny, and the smirk
on the salesman's face is priceless.

347
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:03,118
But look at Holden's face.
He's really, really humiliated.

348
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,517
It's funny but also very sad.

349
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:09,202
Billy Wilder's essential tone
in three words: funny and sad.

350
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:14,240
If you look for symbols in movies,

351
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:19,322
screenwriters and directors use water
as a way of cleaning up some mess.

352
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:22,877
In "Psycho", Janet Leigh
decides to give the money back

353
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:26,517
and immediately takes a shower
to wash her crime away.

354
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:31,807
But here, this downpour only serves
to force Gillis into the mansion.

355
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:36,677
There's something corrupting about
this rain, it's dirty and depressing.

356
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:57,644
Now Gillis has become
quite the hunky whore.

357
00:36:57,807 --> 00:37:00,640
Like the leopard skin
upholstery of Norma's car,

358
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:05,676
this creepy house, so overdecorated,
really starts to look like a bordello.

359
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:10,801
As Max says, "It was
the room of the husband."

360
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,686
"The husbands, I should say."

361
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:18,443
In other words, this is where Norma
Desmond keeps her sexual toys.

362
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:44,404
But Wilder adds a new revelation:
"What's this with the doors?"

363
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:47,798
As Max tells him, they've had
to remove the locks because

364
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:51,243
"Madame has moments
of melancholy."

365
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:53,682
In fact, so did Billy Wilder.

366
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:57,317
Like a lot of comedians,
Wilder was often morose,

367
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:59,921
hyper but morose, and moody.

368
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:03,204
The difference is that Wilder
only had moments of despair,

369
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:07,406
whereas Norma Desmond is suicidal
and more or less insane.

370
00:39:22,647 --> 00:39:27,767
And look at her room. Again,
an extension of her personality.

371
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:31,807
Norma's New Year's party
is a pivotal moment.

372
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:35,685
It's a series of scenes,
beginning with this one.

373
00:39:35,847 --> 00:39:39,999
It marks a major transition for Gillis's
character, and for Norma's too.

374
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:43,523
And this transition takes
a little while to play out.

375
00:39:43,687 --> 00:39:47,362
On the stairs, Gillis says,
"It was at the party"

376
00:39:47,527 --> 00:39:51,440
"that he discovered what Norma
Desmond really felt about him."

377
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:54,041
My question is, where has he been?

378
00:39:54,207 --> 00:39:58,405
Hasn't he been watching this movie?
I guess not, he's in it.

379
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:03,402
The point is, he's been narrating
but he's understood nothing.

380
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:07,765
He's been a dope, a sentiment
to which I'm sure he'd agree.

381
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:11,761
In fact, he does call
himself an idiot here.

382
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:22,441
Notice Norma's outfit here.

383
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,160
She's got that drape over her arm.

384
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:28,761
Looks rather like a veil, doesn't it?

385
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,043
Yes, I think it's symbolic:

386
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:35,917
Edith Head's update of Salome's
famous Dance of the Seven Veils.

387
00:40:36,087 --> 00:40:39,124
For Wilder, the dance we'll soon see

388
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:43,917
also serves as a prelude
to the last scene of the film.

389
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:51,603
As creepy as this is,
it's also quite dazzling.

390
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:55,726
Unlimited champagne, that enormous
cake, your own band playing,

391
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:58,321
Valentino's tile floor...

392
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:03,641
Gillis's situation may be sordid, but he
has good reason to go through with it.

393
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:08,835
We're meant to understand Gillis's
self-prostitution very clearly here.

394
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:14,604
He's living the good life. So what if he
has to hold his nose sometimes?

395
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:22,485
But the film is more
balanced than that.

396
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:27,084
Look how happy Norma Desmond is
when she's dancing with Joe Gillis.

397
00:41:27,247 --> 00:41:32,719
When she stops being the lunatic
and dances with the man she loves,

398
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:37,199
Norma Desmond becomes
almost appealing, even beautiful.

399
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:40,237
Well, a little bit anyway.

400
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:28,285
Wouldn't it be great to pull off wearing
that cigarette holder like her?

401
00:42:28,447 --> 00:42:34,283
How many people can do such a thing?
In a way, she's truly magnificent.

402
00:42:34,447 --> 00:42:37,166
The gift she gives
Joe is another matter.

403
00:42:37,327 --> 00:42:42,003
Why? Because it pushes Gillis
over the edge, it's the last straw.

404
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:52,517
Norma is now drunk and jealous,
an unpleasant mix given her dementia.

405
00:42:52,687 --> 00:42:59,604
Still, as melodramatic as Norma is,
one can't help feeling sorry for her.

406
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:02,486
Leave aside the fact
that she's a gargoyle.

407
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:06,959
From her perspective, and maybe
from ours if we have any sympathy,

408
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:10,676
she's also an attractive,
wealthy woman in her early fifties,

409
00:43:10,847 --> 00:43:17,116
who has fallen in love with a very
handsome and virile younger man.

410
00:43:17,287 --> 00:43:19,801
Holden himself was 31 at the time.

411
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:24,483
It's painful for Norma to realise,
to her huge humiliation,

412
00:43:24,647 --> 00:43:27,957
that she's just not desirable to him.

413
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,436
It's painful for us as well,

414
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:35,237
and I think Wilder is asking
us to feel sympathy for her.

415
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:15,282
Notice the focus pull from Gillis in the
foreground to Max in the background.

416
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:18,325
Wilder shifts the camera's
focus to Max

417
00:44:18,487 --> 00:44:20,842
because what Max
is doing as a servant

418
00:44:21,007 --> 00:44:26,320
is what Gillis would be doing,
figuratively, if he stayed at the house.

419
00:44:26,487 --> 00:44:29,524
At the same time,
Wilder sympathises with Gillis.

420
00:44:29,687 --> 00:44:35,444
It makes perfect sense for him
to leave. It's the right thing to do.

421
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:40,886
But his self-extraction from that house
isn't as smooth as he'd like.

422
00:44:41,047 --> 00:44:43,959
His watch chain
catches on the doorknob.

423
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:53,321
And right away, we see the life
to which Joe Gillis is returning.

424
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:04,200
He's alone, and hitchhiking
in a downpour.

425
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:09,522
Quite a come-down from that mansion,
and all that champagne and caviar.

426
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:24,881
I must confess, Artie Green's party
is one of my least favourite scenes.

427
00:45:25,047 --> 00:45:27,607
It seems a little too carefree to me.

428
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:31,680
I'm sure that hungry young people
in Hollywood can have great parties,

429
00:45:31,847 --> 00:45:33,519
but this one seems forced.

430
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:37,202
They're singing the Oscar-winning
song "Buttons and Bows",

431
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:40,484
with the song's composers,
Jay Livingstone and Ray Evans,

432
00:45:40,647 --> 00:45:42,205
sitting at the piano.

433
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:44,756
Another "Inside Hollywood" reference.

434
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:49,364
And we meet Artie Green finally,
recognisable to vintage TV buffs

435
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:52,837
as Jack Webb, Detective
Joe Friday from "Dragnet".

436
00:45:53,007 --> 00:45:56,556
Webb wasn't just the star,
he had conceived the series,

437
00:45:56,727 --> 00:46:02,836
first for the radio in 1949, the year
"Sunset Boulevard" was in production.

438
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,317
Adolphe Menjou is the same
vintage as Gloria Swanson,

439
00:46:06,487 --> 00:46:09,365
the star of such films as
Chaplin's "A Woman of Paris",

440
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:11,438
and Joseph von
Sternberg's "Morocco",

441
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:15,919
almost always playing a dapper
and expensively-dressed fellow.

442
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:19,284
That's why Artie Green
compares Joe Gillis to him.

443
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:46,555
And here's Betty Shaefer again,
now revealed to be Green's girlfriend.

444
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:52,318
But notice how Wilder sets
poor Artie up for a fall.

445
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:56,116
He's no match for Gillis
in the stud department.

446
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:59,324
First Artie comments on
Gillis's gorgeous face,

447
00:46:59,487 --> 00:47:02,877
then he compares himself
to the society queen Elsa Maxwell.

448
00:47:03,047 --> 00:47:08,599
Maybe Wilder wants us to see Artie as
less interested in Betty than he claims.

449
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:11,440
But we'll soon see,
even before Betty does,

450
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:16,920
that Betty finds herself drawn far more
to Joe Gillis than to Artie Green.

451
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:23,319
While Betty and Joe set up
their working relationship,

452
00:47:23,487 --> 00:47:25,842
here's more about Nancy Olson.

453
00:47:26,007 --> 00:47:29,556
Despite her Oscar nomination,
she lost to Josephine Hull,

454
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:32,195
who was in the Jimmy Stewart
comedy, "Harvey".

455
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:36,155
She had roles in nine other films
over the next five years.

456
00:47:36,327 --> 00:47:42,482
She retired from the movies in 1955,
though she made more films later.

457
00:47:42,647 --> 00:47:45,445
She was married to the
composer Alan J Lerner,

458
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:48,804
and later to the president of Capitol
Records, Alan Livingstone.

459
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:54,080
Holden went on to star in
three more films for Wilder:

460
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:57,523
"Stalag 17", "Sabrina"
and "Fedora".

461
00:47:57,687 --> 00:48:00,724
He became one
of Wilder's closest friends.

462
00:48:00,887 --> 00:48:03,924
He also appeared in other films,
from Joshua Logan's "Picnic"

463
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:06,920
to Sam Peckinpah's
"The Wild Bunch".

464
00:48:15,207 --> 00:48:19,166
Gillis has a fairly dirty line here:
"Maybe there's some paper around."

465
00:48:19,327 --> 00:48:22,637
I'll spell it out: he means toilet paper,

466
00:48:22,807 --> 00:48:26,561
something the Production Code would
have banned as a direct reference.

467
00:48:26,727 --> 00:48:30,322
Wilder clearly thinks
toilet paper is a funny medium

468
00:48:30,487 --> 00:48:33,843
on which to write notes
for a Hollywood screenplay.

469
00:49:15,247 --> 00:49:18,205
Just when Joe thinks he'll
be respectable again,

470
00:49:18,367 --> 00:49:22,406
his past comes to haunt him,
as it often does in film noir.

471
00:49:22,567 --> 00:49:25,604
He has broken
Norma Desmond's heart...

472
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:39,526
...and she has responded
by slashing her wrists

473
00:49:39,687 --> 00:49:44,442
with his razor blade.
So much for his new independence.

474
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,962
Now, in addition to self-contempt,

475
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:51,757
he can add tremendous guilt
to his list of emotional problems.

476
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:18,322
And back he goes.

477
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:43,767
Even in the face of Norma's
suicide attempt,

478
00:50:43,927 --> 00:50:46,487
Max is protective
of her public image.

479
00:50:46,647 --> 00:50:49,036
The musicians mustn't
know what happened.

480
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:51,402
Yep, it's another Hollywood cover-up.

481
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:54,001
Wilder knows how that place operates.

482
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:57,523
He'd lived and worked there
long enough to know.

483
00:51:00,887 --> 00:51:06,280
This is a subtle and nuanced tone
Wilder achieves in this scene.

484
00:51:06,447 --> 00:51:09,280
Gillis pities Norma,
but he still despises her,

485
00:51:09,447 --> 00:51:11,483
and what she's done to him.

486
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:46,482
Norma is humiliated,
but she still maintains her pride.

487
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:51,762
When she delivers the line,
"Great stars have great pride"...

488
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,563
...I think we believe her.

489
00:52:19,447 --> 00:52:22,245
The slightly high angle
here is important.

490
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:25,365
Gillis is narrating this morbid story,

491
00:52:25,527 --> 00:52:30,362
he's effectively looking down on
himself as he makes his fatal move.

492
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:33,997
Namely, back into
Norma Desmond's arms.

493
00:53:43,607 --> 00:53:47,486
And then this sad,
hideous, desolate gesture.

494
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:03,245
The third and final act
opens with Betty Schaefer

495
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,557
trying frantically to reach Joe.

496
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:10,164
Max says he's not there, but we
know he must be living with her,

497
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:12,557
and romancing her once more.

498
00:54:48,407 --> 00:54:52,116
Here's the "stray dog" as Max calls
him, showing some beefcake.

499
00:54:52,287 --> 00:54:55,324
We can see exactly why
Norma keeps him around.

500
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,762
Joe is back to being a kept boy,

501
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:00,964
and Wilder displays
the goods for us to see.

502
00:55:01,127 --> 00:55:04,597
Notice how Joe plays the role,
even more than before,

503
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:08,726
as his relaxed physical manner
in front of Norma indicates.

504
00:55:09,207 --> 00:55:13,678
This is a Production Code-approved
way of saying they've slept together.

505
00:55:41,807 --> 00:55:45,038
If there's any doubt
what's going on here,

506
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:49,086
Franz Waxman gives us a lurid
saxophone interlude in the score,

507
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,523
when Norma hands Joe the money.

508
00:55:55,087 --> 00:55:58,966
She's obviously paying for
something other than cigarettes.

509
00:56:20,087 --> 00:56:22,601
And back to Schwab's Pharmacy.

510
00:56:37,447 --> 00:56:41,201
A bit of dialogue here
drives the point home again.

511
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:43,961
"Where have you been
keeping yourself?" says Betty.

512
00:56:44,127 --> 00:56:47,642
"I haven't been keeping
myself at all," he replies.

513
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:51,364
It's funny to watch
Betty develop a hard edge

514
00:57:51,527 --> 00:57:55,156
the minute Gillis threatens
her career aspirations.

515
00:57:55,327 --> 00:57:59,764
"I don't want to be a reader
all my life. I want to write!"

516
00:57:59,927 --> 00:58:02,999
Despite her fresh face
and winning demeanour,

517
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:08,116
Betty is just as hungry as everyone
else in Hollywood, including Wilder.

518
00:58:39,727 --> 00:58:44,164
Here's what seems to be another
overt symbol: the circling umbrella.

519
00:58:44,327 --> 00:58:46,966
It's the vortex
into which Joe has fallen.

520
00:58:47,127 --> 00:58:50,881
The world of mad Norma Desmond,
re-enacting her glory days.

521
00:58:51,047 --> 00:58:53,242
The Mack Sennett Bathing Beauties,

522
00:58:53,407 --> 00:58:57,195
Sennett being a successful comedy
producer during the silent era.

523
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,245
He's most famous for the
"Keystone Cops" films.

524
00:59:00,407 --> 00:59:04,036
Here, Norma also recalls Mabel
Normand and Marie Prevost,

525
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,597
two more important figures
of early cinema.

526
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:10,327
What we're seeing here
is pretty absurd,

527
00:59:10,487 --> 00:59:13,081
yet Gloria Swanson
invests this whole scene,

528
00:59:13,247 --> 00:59:17,320
and its aftermath, with a genuine
joy at performing again.

529
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:42,285
Norma Desmond and Gloria Swanson
are both great performers,

530
00:59:42,447 --> 00:59:44,244
and they know it.

531
00:59:46,767 --> 00:59:50,646
As they prove,
with what we're about to see.

532
01:00:02,287 --> 01:00:04,243
Charlie Chaplin as the Tramp,

533
01:00:04,407 --> 01:00:08,605
one of the most frequently imitated
characters in all cinema.

534
01:00:08,767 --> 01:00:12,521
But, like most of the imitators
of Norma Desmond herself,

535
01:00:12,687 --> 01:00:16,441
these imitations usually
come off as superficial.

536
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:19,963
Swanson's, though,
strikes me as very, very good.

537
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:23,563
There's an effortlessness to it,
just like Chaplin had.

538
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:26,799
The comedy equivalent
of great dancing.

539
01:00:40,127 --> 01:00:43,403
Amazingly enough,
Paramount has called.

540
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:47,917
And this is when
the scene turns grotesque.

541
01:00:48,087 --> 01:00:51,762
Norma, still in her Chaplin outfit,
turns back into Norma.

542
01:00:51,927 --> 01:00:53,963
It's one of Swanson's best scenes,

543
01:00:54,127 --> 01:00:58,439
because she's forced to deliver
this speech with that moustache,

544
01:00:58,607 --> 01:01:00,757
and she still makes it work.

545
01:01:00,927 --> 01:01:05,364
Norma has talent,
charm, fame, fortune,

546
01:01:05,527 --> 01:01:09,520
and it seems her dream of
returning to films will come true.

547
01:01:09,687 --> 01:01:13,202
And yet, she's obviously
quite out of her mind.

548
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:31,959
Max, in this scene, notices
her make-up is a bit off.

549
01:01:32,127 --> 01:01:35,119
He notices this through
the rear-view mirror,

550
01:01:35,287 --> 01:01:39,166
because Max has had experience
with this sort of thing before.

551
01:01:39,327 --> 01:01:42,080
But we don't know that yet.

552
01:02:01,207 --> 01:02:04,119
According to Billy Wilder,
while filming this scene,

553
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:09,122
Erich von Stroheim crashed into the
Bronson Gate because he couldn't drive,

554
01:02:09,287 --> 01:02:14,964
but that story is, like some of Billy's
best stories, probably fabricated.

555
01:02:22,007 --> 01:02:27,286
It's lucky for Norma that Jonesy
the guard recognises her.

556
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:32,237
Only the old-timers recognise her,
as we'll soon see in greater detail.

557
01:02:46,727 --> 01:02:49,400
For me, and for many people,

558
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:54,960
getting inside a studio is pretty
exciting, and Wilder knows that.

559
01:03:16,727 --> 01:03:21,562
In the sound stage, we have a great high-
angle shot encompassing everything;

560
01:03:21,727 --> 01:03:26,960
the set, the camera, the boom,
the crew, the lighting superstructure,

561
01:03:27,127 --> 01:03:30,802
and he punctuates the shot
with that flashing light bulb,

562
01:03:30,967 --> 01:03:33,606
just to pump up
the energy a little more.

563
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:38,238
Despite its bitterness toward Hollywood,
this is a movie for movie lovers,

564
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:41,604
and this whole sequence
is about loving movies.

565
01:03:45,247 --> 01:03:46,805
It's a Cecil B DeMille epic,

566
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:50,846
so we've got these glamorous
Biblical creatures running around,

567
01:03:51,007 --> 01:03:54,158
in inane and overblown costumes.

568
01:03:54,327 --> 01:03:57,922
Notice the chain of command
leading up to Mr DeMille:

569
01:03:58,087 --> 01:04:00,237
the second assistant goes
to the first assistant,

570
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:05,003
and it is only he who dares
to approach the mastermind himself.

571
01:04:05,167 --> 01:04:07,442
Despite Wilder's attempt
to soften DeMille

572
01:04:07,607 --> 01:04:12,965
by handing him that line about how
millions of fans gave Norma the brush,

573
01:04:13,127 --> 01:04:16,085
DeMille comes off
as a fairly sour figure,

574
01:04:16,247 --> 01:04:20,638
a manipulative autocrat making
one of his risible extravaganzas.

575
01:04:20,807 --> 01:04:26,200
DeMille agreed to the role for
a healthy salary and a new Cadillac.

576
01:04:27,287 --> 01:04:31,997
Wilder's original idea was to have
Hedy Lamarr sitting at her chair.

577
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:35,921
DeMille is filming his 1949 epic,
"Samson and Delilah",

578
01:04:36,087 --> 01:04:38,362
starring Hedy Lamarr
and Victor Mature.

579
01:04:38,527 --> 01:04:41,246
According to Wilder,
Lamarr asked Paramount

580
01:04:43,367 --> 01:04:46,325
for $25,000 for a cameo,
so they dropped the idea.

581
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:28,764
Again, this is exciting for those of us
who haven't been inside a sound stage.

582
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:10,805
Notice the contempt with which
she brushes this boom away.

583
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:26,757
There really was
a Hog-eye at Paramount,

584
01:06:26,927 --> 01:06:30,283
an old-timer electrician
named John Hetman.

585
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:36,639
Here Wilder makes it clear Norma
Desmond isn't entirely forgotten,

586
01:06:36,807 --> 01:06:41,517
as all the other old-timers respond
to her with awe and admiration.

587
01:06:42,487 --> 01:06:45,047
Billy himself remembered
the old silent stars.

588
01:06:45,207 --> 01:06:49,405
In fact, one of the articles he wrote
as a young journalist in Vienna

589
01:06:49,567 --> 01:06:54,038
was an interview with the great
Danish movie star Asta Nielsen.

590
01:06:57,927 --> 01:07:00,885
But Paramount doesn't
want Norma at all.

591
01:07:01,047 --> 01:07:04,801
The studio only wants her car
for a Bing Crosby picture.

592
01:07:04,967 --> 01:07:08,243
Billy had worked with Crosby
on "The Emperor Waltz",

593
01:07:08,407 --> 01:07:11,365
and he found the experience
less than satisfying.

594
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:14,758
Crosby was the only star
Wilder worked with

595
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:17,646
who got away not only with
changing Wilder's dialogue,

596
01:07:17,807 --> 01:07:23,962
but with hiring his own hack writers
to rewrite parts of Billy's screenplay.

597
01:07:25,287 --> 01:07:30,600
Look at how Wilder has DeMille spoil
Norma's brief return to the limelight.

598
01:07:35,367 --> 01:07:37,642
He orders Hog-eye
to turn off the light,

599
01:07:37,807 --> 01:07:41,516
and her few true fans disperse.

600
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:44,360
Billy makes DeMille seem even worse.

601
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:48,759
DeMille doesn't even have the guts
to tell Norma the truth.

602
01:09:31,727 --> 01:09:36,198
Here's where Joe meets Betty again
in her office in the writers' building.

603
01:09:36,367 --> 01:09:40,724
The idea of collaborating on
a screenplay was dear to Wilder.

604
01:09:40,887 --> 01:09:44,163
He always worked
with a writing partner.

605
01:10:13,207 --> 01:10:16,165
She's glad to see him,
maybe too glad.

606
01:10:16,327 --> 01:10:20,366
She is, after all, still engaged
to marry Artie Green.

607
01:10:47,567 --> 01:10:52,243
Joe's not a bad ideas man,
as far as screenwriting is concerned.

608
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:55,558
He delivers the idea of the two
characters meeting flippantly,

609
01:10:55,727 --> 01:10:59,686
but it's what Wilder used
to call a classic "meet cute".

610
01:10:59,847 --> 01:11:02,361
For instance, a couple
meet in a department store,

611
01:11:02,527 --> 01:11:06,645
when the man only wants to buy
the bottom half of some pyjamas,

612
01:11:06,807 --> 01:11:09,241
and the woman only wants the top.

613
01:11:09,407 --> 01:11:13,366
That was the "meet cute" in
Lubitsch's "Bluebeard's Eighth Wife",

614
01:11:13,527 --> 01:11:16,564
which was co-written by Billy Wilder.

615
01:12:48,567 --> 01:12:52,355
Norma's make-over is made to look
exaggerated and ridiculous,

616
01:12:52,527 --> 01:12:57,237
but these days plastic surgery is so
common among ageing Hollywood stars

617
01:12:57,407 --> 01:13:00,240
that nobody bothers to hide
the surgery any more.

618
01:13:00,407 --> 01:13:03,604
They still think they must look
young to be successful,

619
01:13:03,767 --> 01:13:05,678
and maybe they do.

620
01:13:06,407 --> 01:13:10,446
Remember that Norma Desmond
is really only in her fifties,

621
01:13:10,607 --> 01:13:14,759
which makes her desire to look
younger all the more pathetic.

622
01:13:44,127 --> 01:13:45,958
In this scene in Joe's bedroom,

623
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:50,678
Norma is acting the role of the
great silent actress she once was.

624
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:55,762
She performs most effectively
using her face and her hands.

625
01:13:55,927 --> 01:13:59,920
She may seem exaggerated to
audiences unused to such gestures,

626
01:14:00,087 --> 01:14:04,000
but it's great in terms
of silent screen performance.

627
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:08,203
"If only there weren't words, words..."

628
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:12,406
Given the already excessive
gestures she employs,

629
01:14:12,567 --> 01:14:15,240
Norma herself creates
a rope of words.

630
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:20,561
The rope she referred to earlier,
and she's strangling herself with them.

631
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:37,837
Norma's melodrama only pushes Joe
to work at night with Betty.

632
01:14:38,967 --> 01:14:41,276
Billy always worked
with a collaborator.

633
01:14:41,447 --> 01:14:43,324
He liked the interplay.

634
01:14:43,487 --> 01:14:47,275
But his collaborations with Bracket,
who co-wrote "Sunset Boulevard",

635
01:14:47,447 --> 01:14:52,567
weren't always as happy as the one
Joe and Betty are about to enjoy.

636
01:14:52,727 --> 01:14:56,242
They argued so much they
threw phone books at each other.

637
01:14:56,407 --> 01:15:01,356
Their secretaries simply got used
to hearing the shouting and thudding.

638
01:16:56,407 --> 01:17:01,606
"Mad about the boy,"
signed Norma. Well, she is.

639
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:03,166
They take a walk around
the studio late at night.

640
01:18:03,327 --> 01:18:07,081
Betty's speech about being born
and growing up in Hollywood

641
01:18:07,247 --> 01:18:12,401
was based on someone real: Mrs Billy
Wilder, the lovely Audrey Young,

642
01:18:12,567 --> 01:18:17,243
whose mother had worked in the
Paramount wardrobe department.

643
01:18:17,407 --> 01:18:20,717
Audrey wanted to be in the movies,
but because of her terrific voice,

644
01:18:20,887 --> 01:18:24,243
she became a successful
big band singer before marrying Billy

645
01:18:24,407 --> 01:18:26,523
and became Audrey Wilder.

646
01:20:23,287 --> 01:20:26,324
They've come close
to a big clinch here,

647
01:20:26,487 --> 01:20:30,400
but Joe cuts it short.
He's saving it for later.

648
01:21:02,207 --> 01:21:07,759
Max's revelation here is a very
biting comment on Billy's part.

649
01:21:07,927 --> 01:21:12,159
It's another harsh remark on what
happens to Hollywood has-beens.

650
01:21:16,287 --> 01:21:21,645
But it's also a strikingly bitter reference
to Erich von Stroheim himself.

651
01:21:22,487 --> 01:21:26,400
Stroheim never became
a star's masochistic slave,

652
01:21:26,567 --> 01:21:28,683
but he let his career go to hell

653
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:32,681
after Gloria Swanson stopped working
with him after "Queen Kelly".

654
01:21:57,087 --> 01:22:02,286
Notice how very dark this scene is,
there's barely any light at all.

655
01:23:10,647 --> 01:23:15,880
As almost always, Norma plays
this scene, this time with Joe asleep,

656
01:23:16,047 --> 01:23:18,481
as silent film melodrama.

657
01:23:22,807 --> 01:23:27,244
Big gestures, big facial expressions...

658
01:23:27,407 --> 01:23:31,286
This is really the only mode
of expression she knows.

659
01:24:00,887 --> 01:24:04,721
"Untitled Love Story":
that's what she's afraid of.

660
01:24:05,647 --> 01:24:09,879
We're back at the office working,
but Betty is preoccupied.

661
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:27,163
It's true, she's not romantically
impressed by Artie Green at all,

662
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:31,445
and instead has fallen
for the studly Joe Gillis.

663
01:24:40,727 --> 01:24:44,720
In a way, we see this
even before she does.

664
01:25:33,487 --> 01:25:36,001
When they finally kiss
on the balcony,

665
01:25:36,167 --> 01:25:38,761
Wilder got what he wanted
on the first take,

666
01:25:38,927 --> 01:25:42,966
but he called for a second
take just to make sure.

667
01:25:47,887 --> 01:25:51,084
The second time, he let them kiss

668
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:52,999
and kiss

669
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:54,919
and kiss

670
01:25:55,087 --> 01:25:56,725
and kiss.

671
01:25:56,887 --> 01:25:58,957
All without calling "Cut".

672
01:26:02,327 --> 01:26:05,046
Finally, the crew started snickering,

673
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:09,405
then, one of the spectators watching
the filming yelled "Cut" herself.

674
01:26:09,567 --> 01:26:14,322
It was Mrs William Holden,
who wasn't amused at Billy's joke.

675
01:27:12,567 --> 01:27:18,278
Here's something younger audience
members may not recognise:

676
01:27:18,447 --> 01:27:23,396
Norma is using the phone,
that's the sound of the dial turning.

677
01:27:27,287 --> 01:27:30,597
This turns into one
of the creepiest scenes:

678
01:27:30,767 --> 01:27:34,282
poor Norma, inflamed
and made mean by jealousy,

679
01:27:34,447 --> 01:27:39,726
with those patches on her face,
whispering dirt into the mouthpiece.

680
01:27:40,807 --> 01:27:45,597
She reveals through this dialogue,
which is directed at Betty Schaefer,

681
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:49,123
that she holds Joe
in contempt for what he is.

682
01:27:49,287 --> 01:27:52,245
As she puts it,
men of his sort are,

683
01:27:52,407 --> 01:27:56,161
in her view,
really worthy of derision.

684
01:27:59,967 --> 01:28:02,435
She still plays everything
as silent melodrama,

685
01:28:02,607 --> 01:28:06,043
but it turns to genuine emotion
when she's caught.

686
01:28:39,567 --> 01:28:41,922
She's so flustered she
stops the performance

687
01:28:42,087 --> 01:28:45,523
she thinks has been
to her own advantage.

688
01:29:27,527 --> 01:29:31,202
When she says that line about
"Don't hate me, Joe",

689
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:35,121
it's neither funny nor grotesque.

690
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:40,236
It's quite real-sounding,
and as such, all the more touching.

691
01:30:49,367 --> 01:30:51,323
When Betty arrives at the mansion,

692
01:30:51,487 --> 01:30:55,526
Joe remains flippant as he
shows her around the house,

693
01:30:55,687 --> 01:31:00,807
even, or perhaps because,
he's at the depth of his self-contempt.

694
01:31:02,887 --> 01:31:08,280
After all, he's showing his young
girlfriend his old girlfriend's palace.

695
01:31:09,367 --> 01:31:14,521
He goes on and on about the house
to explain why he lives there.

696
01:31:14,687 --> 01:31:17,759
"A very simple set-up," he says.

697
01:31:18,247 --> 01:31:21,523
Then Wilder gives him
a wonderful turn of phrase:

698
01:31:21,687 --> 01:31:27,603
"An older woman who's well-to-do, a
younger man who's not doing too well."

699
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:34,315
All that stuff here appears
to mean something to him.

700
01:31:34,487 --> 01:31:37,797
He's describing the decor
seemingly admiringly,

701
01:31:37,967 --> 01:31:42,518
but his tough-talking manner only
makes us doubt him all the more.

702
01:31:42,887 --> 01:31:47,961
His harshness shows he's getting rid
of Betty because he cares for her.

703
01:31:48,127 --> 01:31:51,722
Does he love her?
That's another matter.

704
01:31:51,887 --> 01:31:57,484
Real love may not be part
of Joe Gillis's emotional repertoire.

705
01:34:11,007 --> 01:34:12,918
And so Betty leaves.

706
01:34:22,207 --> 01:34:26,997
Wilder tilts his camera up to Norma.
As in her introductory scene,

707
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:31,240
she's got a very precise,
very intense light on her face.

708
01:34:31,407 --> 01:34:34,763
She's still on top of him,
still controlling him.

709
01:35:06,487 --> 01:35:10,878
As anyone before playing an important
scene, she checks her make-up.

710
01:35:45,487 --> 01:35:49,878
This close-up of Norma on the line
"You're leaving me" is crucial.

711
01:35:50,047 --> 01:35:53,596
It's sudden and scary
because it brings us close

712
01:35:53,767 --> 01:35:56,156
to someone having
a nervous breakdown.

713
01:35:56,327 --> 01:36:01,526
The intensity signals the end
of whatever rationality Norma has left.

714
01:36:22,847 --> 01:36:27,921
At this point she's purely mad,
and she'll stay that way till the end.

715
01:36:28,087 --> 01:36:32,160
Wilder has finally turned poor Norma
Desmond into a pure grotesque.

716
01:36:32,327 --> 01:36:34,238
Not that she doesn't deserve it,

717
01:36:34,407 --> 01:36:38,400
and not that Hollywood
isn't to blame in the end.

718
01:38:10,727 --> 01:38:12,479
That's an inspired line:

719
01:38:12,647 --> 01:38:16,560
"No one ever leaves a star.
That's what makes one a star."

720
01:38:16,727 --> 01:38:18,240
Well, not exactly, Norma,

721
01:38:18,407 --> 01:38:22,320
maybe it has to do with sustaining a
connection with an unseen audience,

722
01:38:22,487 --> 01:38:25,524
something Norma
hasn't done for 20 years.

723
01:38:25,687 --> 01:38:27,803
Note that she shoots
him in the back.

724
01:38:27,967 --> 01:38:31,084
Wilder hated Westerns,
but even he would admit

725
01:38:31,247 --> 01:38:33,636
that this violation
of the "Code of the West"

726
01:38:33,807 --> 01:38:36,560
indicates cowardice
on the part of the bad guy,

727
01:38:36,727 --> 01:38:38,479
in this case Norma.

728
01:38:38,647 --> 01:38:41,115
So Wilder returns to the beginning,

729
01:38:41,287 --> 01:38:44,199
and shows us who that
guy was in the pool.

730
01:38:44,367 --> 01:38:47,200
Maybe some audience
members knew it all along.

731
01:38:47,367 --> 01:38:52,202
Speaking for myself, I was shocked
when I saw this for the first time.

732
01:38:52,367 --> 01:38:57,043
It seems like a tragedy, but Wilder
doesn't want to sustain that mood.

733
01:38:57,207 --> 01:39:00,404
He needs a bizarre punchline,
so he cuts to Norma saying,

734
01:39:00,567 --> 01:39:02,797
"The stars are ageless, aren't they?"

735
01:39:06,487 --> 01:39:11,038
Yes they are, especially when they
turn into celebrity murderers.

736
01:39:13,847 --> 01:39:16,884
Cut to Gillis in the pool surrounded
by policemen and photographers.

737
01:39:17,047 --> 01:39:19,925
"Well," he says,
"this is where you came in."

738
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:22,885
He's grown comfortable
with being dead by now,

739
01:39:23,047 --> 01:39:25,686
he's had the whole film
to get used to it.

740
01:39:25,847 --> 01:39:29,044
And death hasn't diminished
his tough-talking sense of irony.

741
01:39:29,207 --> 01:39:34,076
He says, "Funny how gentle people
get with you when you're dead."

742
01:39:58,327 --> 01:40:01,205
Here come the newsreel
guys, from Paramount.

743
01:40:01,367 --> 01:40:04,564
"Here's an item everybody
could have some fun with," he says.

744
01:40:04,727 --> 01:40:09,562
He's cynical, but he's right. As the OJ
Simpson and Robert Blake trials prove,

745
01:40:09,727 --> 01:40:11,922
Hollywood is still pretty heartless.

746
01:40:12,087 --> 01:40:15,159
All those entertainment shows
focusing on human misery,

747
01:40:15,327 --> 01:40:17,602
as long as it's about
somebody famous.

748
01:40:17,767 --> 01:40:21,282
The rest of us are heartless too
in regard to famous people.

749
01:40:21,447 --> 01:40:23,915
We're glued to our TV sets, after all.

750
01:40:24,087 --> 01:40:28,524
They called Wilder cynical, but I think
he was just ahead of the curve.

751
01:40:28,687 --> 01:40:31,838
Watch the cop try
to use the telephone.

752
01:40:37,007 --> 01:40:40,716
Wilder cuts to Hedda Hopper
taking over the narration,

753
01:40:40,887 --> 01:40:46,007
only her mode of expression is
classic, overblown gossip-speak.

754
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:51,201
Wilder and Bracket were friendlier
with the other major gossip-columnist,

755
01:40:51,367 --> 01:40:55,076
Luella Parsons, but Hedda Hopper
had been an actress first,

756
01:40:55,247 --> 01:40:58,762
and they knew she'd be
much better on screen.

757
01:41:14,567 --> 01:41:17,127
There's another key
close-up of Norma coming,

758
01:41:17,287 --> 01:41:21,246
to capture the moment when she
hears the word "cameras".

759
01:41:32,167 --> 01:41:36,763
As I said, Wilder doesn't overuse
close-ups, here or in other films.

760
01:41:36,927 --> 01:41:39,566
He saves them for key
expressive moments like this,

761
01:41:39,727 --> 01:41:43,197
when Norma realises her dream
of appearing in pictures again.

762
01:41:43,367 --> 01:41:46,643
In "Sunset Boulevard", Gillis
gets his swimming pool in the end,

763
01:41:46,807 --> 01:41:51,164
Norma gets her big scene,
not a comeback, but a return.

764
01:41:51,327 --> 01:41:54,000
Even Max gets to direct again.

765
01:41:54,167 --> 01:41:55,885
It's perverse but true:

766
01:41:56,047 --> 01:41:59,676
the three main characters
all get what they want.

767
01:41:59,847 --> 01:42:03,681
Only Betty Schaefer gets
left out of the big payout.

768
01:42:25,367 --> 01:42:27,642
Max is particularly lucky.

769
01:42:27,807 --> 01:42:32,483
He directs one of the greatest scenes
ever recorded on celluloid,

770
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:37,675
Norma Desmond, descending the stairs,
at the end of "Sunset Boulevard".

771
01:42:39,287 --> 01:42:42,006
Even with her ghastly make-up
and outrageous outfit,

772
01:42:42,167 --> 01:42:45,204
one can't help feel sympathy
with Norma here,

773
01:42:45,367 --> 01:42:49,076
when she doesn't know what scene
she's expected to perform.

774
01:42:49,247 --> 01:42:53,240
It's like a nightmare,
when you can't remember your lines,

775
01:42:53,407 --> 01:42:56,877
and despite the hideousness
and humour of it all,

776
01:42:57,047 --> 01:42:59,356
it's also rather touching.

777
01:43:35,847 --> 01:43:38,077
Gillis's lines here are telling.

778
01:43:38,247 --> 01:43:42,035
He describes Norma's dream
as having "enfolded" her.

779
01:43:42,207 --> 01:43:46,644
Even though she's killed him,
Joe still shows her a little mercy.

780
01:43:46,807 --> 01:43:50,516
"Enfolding." It suggests that
Norma Desmond's dementia

781
01:43:50,687 --> 01:43:53,201
is actually one of self-protection.

782
01:43:53,367 --> 01:43:56,245
Maybe you need that in Hollywood.

783
01:44:14,287 --> 01:44:18,439
More comedy here, when Norma
asks DeMille, really Max,

784
01:44:18,607 --> 01:44:21,679
if she can speak,
and not waiting for an answer,

785
01:44:21,847 --> 01:44:24,759
she just plunges on ahead
into her speech.

786
01:44:26,567 --> 01:44:28,842
Even though she's
completely mad now,

787
01:44:29,007 --> 01:44:33,797
she still finds a beautiful description
of the love of making movies,

788
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:38,961
a love Billy Wilder maintained
until his death, in Spring 2002.

789
01:44:52,927 --> 01:44:54,997
"There's nothing else, just us"

790
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:59,399
"and the cameras and those
wonderful people out there in the dark."

791
01:44:59,567 --> 01:45:01,717
Of course, Wilder can't help himself,

792
01:45:01,887 --> 01:45:05,004
he has her gesture to us
with that creepy claw,

793
01:45:05,167 --> 01:45:07,556
as she says that lovely line:

794
01:45:07,727 --> 01:45:10,002
"All right, Mr DeMille,
I'm ready for my close-up."

795
01:45:10,167 --> 01:45:13,045
An often misquoted line,
but as the film ends,

796
01:45:13,207 --> 01:45:16,040
Norma doesn't really get
the close-up she craves.

797
01:45:16,207 --> 01:45:19,119
Wilder pulls out of focus
before she achieves it.

798
01:45:19,287 --> 01:45:22,085
He's right, she is out
of focus, thoroughly,

799
01:45:22,247 --> 01:45:25,444
and so is the industry
that made her what she became.

800
01:45:25,607 --> 01:45:29,998
This is Ed Sikov, and I certainly
hope you enjoyed the picture.
