1
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:22,048
Miss, your dog is very pretty.

2
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:24,248
Yeah, it's like our dog Lucky!

3
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,189
Bring your dog to our home
if you've time, we live in 9/F.

4
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,038
What are you doing in my house?

5
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:24,482
I love cleaning my body before...

6
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:25,449
doing my job!

7
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:06,715
This is the 5th homicide case
in these 2 months.

8
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:12,257
It's such a cruel murdering,
but there is any clue left!

9
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:14,732
It must be done by
the professional killer.

10
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,895
Damn it! The murderer is cold-blooded!

11
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:20,302
The murderer even broke the man's dick!

12
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:22,700
Isn't it the music?

13
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:23,865
Yes.

14
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:25,238
How do you remember it?

15
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,906
He loved watching Japanese blue tapes
which made much noise.

16
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:30,276
Say, the women yelled loudly!

17
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,941
But on last night,
he changed to classical music.

18
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,383
So, I remembered very well about that!

19
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,779
How do you know
he loved watching blue tapes?

20
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:38,618
I saw once in my classmate's home,
the girls made the same noise.

21
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:39,784
What's on?

22
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:41,893
He is the 3rd witness
who heard classical music...

23
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:43,427
during the period the man was killed.

24
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:47,694
I guess, the murderer used to listen
Mozart's music when killing.

25
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,393
Are you the one who loved
listening Mozart's music only?

26
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:51,595
Officer Lee, we found 2 more corpses
at the staircase of the 9th floor.

27
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:53,297
They are believed to be an aged couple.

28
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:54,896
PC369, make a statement for that.

29
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:56,498
Yes Sir, kid, come with me.

30
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:01,012
The murderer might have seen them,
so they were killed.

31
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:03,043
Shave if you have time,

32
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:04,741
stop pretending to be great detective.

33
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:08,619
Officer Lee, I suspected that
there was only one single killer.

34
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:10,212
The murderer may be a woman.

35
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,124
I regret to ask you here!

36
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:18,823
How could a woman throw a man,
who was over 200 lbs from here to there?

37
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:20,865
From the way he was killed,
how can you say it's done by woman?

38
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:22,531
Say the last 2 cases,

39
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,762
legs and arms of the naked victims
were broken.

40
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:27,202
Even the reproductive organs
were teared off.

41
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,399
And this victim,

42
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,840
legs and arms were broken,
the skull was cracked.

43
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:35,270
The reproductive organ
was busted by bullet.

44
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:36,712
So, I suspected it was done by woman.

45
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,251
About the last 2 cases,
that was caused by sex dispute.

46
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:44,689
And this one,
must be a punishment by the triads.

47
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:47,754
Tinam, please! Forget the illusion.

48
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:50,192
Officer Lee, I suspected
the last 2 victims were killed in bed...

49
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,594
the murderer killed them
when making love with them.

50
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,090
Were they making love
with a female gorilla?

51
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,634
How can a woman have such force?

52
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,929
This must be done by couples of men.

53
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:01,330
Tinam, take more rest!

54
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,633
But now I am normal!

55
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:04,232
You killed your own brother 2 months ago

56
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:05,333
How can you become normal
in such a short time?

57
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,275
What are you talking about?
I wanna kill you if you don't shut up!

58
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:11,006
Officer Lee,
it's an accident, you know it!

59
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:15,520
Yes, for this case,
the ordinary people will never forget!

60
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:19,216
I make you resume duty soon,
is giving face to your passed brother.

61
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,088
Shit!

62
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:22,286
In fact, you should take
6 months more psychotherapy.

63
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:24,259
But I am normal now!

64
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,031
You claim yourself normal?

65
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,498
You don't even know how to hold a gun!
Are you normal?

66
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,760
Not any nuts will admit they are nuts!

67
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,203
You are transferred to
the Anti-vice Dept. from next week.

68
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,842
You should not follow this case!

69
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,978
Have you hair cut and shave,

70
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,380
you will look better.

71
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,018
Stay where you are! Don't go!

72
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:54,018
A colleague is hurt, call the ambulance!

73
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:56,988
Brother, how will you get hurt?

74
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:01,763
Brother!

75
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:10,098
Buy some napkins in times of period.

76
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,939
To shut his mouth and his ass.

77
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:24,713
This is my treat!

78
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:26,621
I won't give it to another.

79
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,488
What do you want to hint?

80
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,619
Do you want me to give you
something in return?

81
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:32,959
Don't you think I am that practical?

82
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:36,763
You are like a... wolf!

83
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:37,892
Wait!

84
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,336
This girl is so bitchy!
You can sleep with her this time!

85
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:43,238
I will be the next!

86
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:47,143
Lower your voice! Don't let her
hear that! Or we won't have chance!

87
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:51,807
Hold your scissors well!

88
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,418
Woman is made by fire,
you may easily get hurt, be careful!

89
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:57,115
Never mind, I have a big hose!

90
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,488
If you cut my ear, I will cut your hose!

91
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:01,423
You are fooling me!

92
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,126
What a shit this time!

93
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:07,756
Tommy!
Why don't you call me these days?

94
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:09,095
Don't you see me working hard?

95
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:10,566
I will call you later.

96
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,265
Do you want to brush me off
because I am pregnant?

97
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:15,399
What? You mean it's my baby?

98
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:17,203
How can you prove it?

99
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:18,767
You always fool around,

100
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:21,173
I wonder it's the baby of the rascal!

101
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:22,916
Are you framing me?

102
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,613
Girl, take the abortion in Shunzhen,
that's easy!

103
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:29,584
Why bothering us?

104
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:32,953
She is my girlfriend only.

105
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:36,751
How dare she frame me!

106
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:39,490
I have lived with you for half year!

107
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,599
You are the only man in my life!

108
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:42,895
He wants to brush you off!

109
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,062
He is fond of me, why don't you leave?

110
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:46,465
I am sorry!

111
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,503
Don't tell me of bearing my baby!

112
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:52,167
I am sponsoring you some money!

113
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,173
Take few hundred and leave now!

114
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:57,840
Damn you, how dare you frame me!

115
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,009
I will help you to get rid of your baby!

116
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:01,176
You are great!

117
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:04,253
Go to hell!

118
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,115
How dare you bully my friend!

119
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:09,925
Do you trust me now?

120
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:11,688
Stop crying!

121
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:13,662
He shampooed my hair twice,
then he dumped you!

122
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,995
You should forget this man!
Let me take the revenge for you.

123
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,559
I will cut his dick off!

124
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:18,693
Cop, stop!

125
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:20,032
- Help!
- Stop!

126
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:24,973
Let's go!

127
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,071
Call the ambulance!

128
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,713
It seems that one ball is missing.

129
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:37,278
You'd better leave first.

130
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:40,522
Don't move!

131
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,491
I warn you, I will shoot if you move!

132
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,120
Shoot then! Why don't you shoot?

133
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,664
Are you afraid of writing report?

134
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,397
Why did you hit him?

135
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:50,024
The scumbag deserves it!

136
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:52,000
Only Ah Si trusts that bastard!

137
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:53,800
He is called Tommy, not Scumbag!

138
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:58,310
You are too old, man!
Scumbag means bastard!

139
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:06,412
I will shout for help.

140
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,185
Rape! Indecent assault!

141
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:10,182
Don't move!

142
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:30,298
Do you mean it?

143
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:33,541
I am just playing with you!

144
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:37,508
Take the gun back!
You must be scared to throw up.

145
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:39,578
What's your name?

146
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:42,143
Tinam!

147
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:44,188
That's smart!

148
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:48,858
I will let you go now, because that...

149
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:49,860
Scumbag!

150
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,190
That Scumbag deserves it.

151
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:52,896
You shouldn't put it in that way.

152
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:55,057
It's me, Kitty, who let you go,

153
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,601
I won't sue you!

154
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:04,132
What are you doing? Why don't you leave?

155
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,873
I would have cut your dick
if you stayed a little bit longer.

156
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:14,742
Poor man! He forgets the pager!

157
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,291
Chinese pager?

158
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:22,292
Hello, Chinese pager!

159
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:25,520
Mr. Tinam, did you drop your pager?

160
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,155
Did you vomit again?

161
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,198
Did you pick my pager?

162
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:31,531
Yes, I did!
It's lucky for me to pick it up.

163
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,070
I was working there.

164
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,128
How can I take it back?

165
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:37,367
At least candle light dinner.

166
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:39,069
I won't waste any time on you.

167
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:40,577
I work in the Anti-triad Dept.
of Kowloon City,

168
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:42,044
you bring it back tomorrow.

169
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,250
Shit-head,
did anyone bring me the pager?

170
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:52,187
I don't think so, but a girl comes,

171
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:55,657
saying that she was raped
by one of our colleague.

172
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:59,957
A girl? Where is that girl?

173
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,328
She is inside, Officer Lee
is taking the statement for her.

174
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:04,495
What?

175
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,175
Fuck!

176
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,352
Tinam, come to see me later.

177
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,594
You look pale!

178
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:33,721
Bull shit!

179
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,389
Are you nervous?

180
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,593
I am not!

181
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:39,136
But you are drinking other's milk.

182
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:43,972
- Alright.
- Thank you.

183
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,739
Tinam, follow me!

184
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:47,711
The girl...

185
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:49,111
Come in right now!

186
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:50,607
You may go.

187
00:12:58,257 --> 00:12:59,451
Do you want any coffee?

188
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:00,786
I have drunk milk!

189
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:06,822
The girl told me the story
which she was indecent assault.

190
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:08,856
You are great!

191
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:11,795
After you've resumed duty,

192
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:14,236
this is the 1st day you're praised.

193
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:20,537
She praised me? What is it about?

194
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,978
Brave in catching thief, strong enough.

195
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:24,982
You could stand such a long time!

196
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:29,782
She said you chased
after the wolf for 15 minutes.

197
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:32,151
He escaped after a long time running.

198
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:34,484
You are fit, I guess!

199
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,158
I run every morning.

200
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:43,091
You recognise the guy
who pretended to be cop?

201
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,796
Go with the girl and
picture out that rapist.

202
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,240
- You mean me?
- Yes.

203
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:54,107
The girl wrote a letter
to the radio station to praise you too.

204
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,040
She is flattering me!

205
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:01,878
Stop...

206
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:07,448
Stop!

207
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:09,755
Kitty...

208
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:12,763
Just pretend to be my boyfriend
if you are kind enough.

209
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:14,197
Kitty.

210
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,392
Dad!

211
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:16,994
What a coincidence?

212
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,628
He is...

213
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,332
He is my new friend.

214
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,170
I understand that...

215
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:27,178
He is called Tinam, a cop.

216
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:30,739
I have to go now,
I am hurrying to the flood stall.

217
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:32,506
Fine!

218
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,880
Take care of Kitty.

219
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:38,513
Sure! I will take good care of her.

220
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:40,453
- Don't worry...
- That's very kind of you.

221
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,526
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

222
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:44,094
Bye bye.

223
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,122
Take care.

224
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:52,131
You are skilled at using others.

225
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:54,972
Give me back the pager.

226
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:57,539
Why not accompany me
to the department store?

227
00:14:58,344 --> 00:14:59,436
Catch the pager.

228
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:02,906
This is not mine.

229
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:08,550
Quite sexy.

230
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:11,188
What do you want? Want a peep?

231
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:14,322
Pay first.

232
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:16,992
Are you pretending to be cool?

233
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:18,586
I think we have some generation gap.

234
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:20,893
You think it's the common way
to court a boy like this?

235
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:25,235
What? Should I court you?

236
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:27,168
If you don't intend to court me,
you needn't fool me for 1 whole day.

237
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,138
You gave me trouble!

238
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:32,767
I just want to teach you how to behave.

239
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:37,410
Will you cut the line
in such impolite way in future?

240
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,177
If there is no body around,
won't you afraid I would rape you?

241
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:44,078
I have seen something of you.

242
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:45,212
What is it?

243
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:47,586
Your mole.

244
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:53,562
Should you point at me
with your hot gun?

245
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:56,790
It's not funny!

246
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,302
What are you doing?

247
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,305
I should have met you earlier.

248
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:15,147
You needn't knock so hard!

249
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:17,449
I didn't!

250
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:21,721
Hey boy, why not stop here?
We should move now.

251
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:25,887
They are laughing at you! You wolf!

252
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,063
I haven't had sex impulse for long!

253
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,394
Go and get him.

254
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:31,365
Kidding? If so, I will change you.

255
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,266
It's your word!

256
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,396
Hey, guy! Are you crazy?

257
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:38,008
Actually I should thank you.

258
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,908
To thank me?
I haven't agreed to give you advantage.

259
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:42,412
You will know it later.

260
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:43,874
I am leaving.

261
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,942
Let me send you home.

262
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:49,146
You know there is mini-bus
in this world?

263
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:50,954
What number is your pager?

264
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:52,547
Lucky number for you.

265
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:58,893
1647

266
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:09,904
Lan, what are you doing?

267
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:12,073
You are bad tempered!

268
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:14,044
We buy the bowls with money.

269
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,239
I'd work all day!

270
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:18,315
Why don't you close it? I am tired!

271
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:22,079
I told you in Mainland
that I am working in a food stall.

272
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:23,813
But I didn't know I'd be so tired!

273
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:25,584
If I knew it,
I wouldn't have left Shunzhen!

274
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:29,286
OK...

275
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:33,797
It's my fault, OK?

276
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:36,697
Poor business tonight,
you'd better do it yourself!

277
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:38,359
I want to sleep!

278
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,075
Dad, what's the matter?

279
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:47,673
- Nothing...
- Did she bully you again?

280
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,344
Kitty! Forget it.

281
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:52,416
I don't understand!
What are you scare of?

282
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:55,483
She is your step-mother anyway.

283
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:58,686
We shouldn't quarrel for such nonsense.

284
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:02,217
Have you eaten?

285
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:03,384
Not yet.

286
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:08,159
Your boyfriend is so mean
to treat you any meal.

287
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:11,201
Poor business tonight.

288
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:14,636
Why not eat the remained wantons?

289
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:16,797
Let's eat together.

290
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:17,807
That's good!

291
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:21,779
Kitty, don't be that mean to the boys!

292
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:23,473
You should treat your boyfriend better.

293
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:25,675
I have got it, don't worry dad!

294
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:32,218
Dad, you'd better go up first,
I want to make a call.

295
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:33,655
Can you make a call at home?

296
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:36,887
I don't want that bitch to hear me.

297
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,896
Be good, go up first.

298
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:41,089
OK, I am going home.

299
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,464
Come back earlier.

300
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:43,693
OK.

301
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,852
You bastard! You bitch!

302
00:19:01,954 --> 00:19:04,047
Since you come back,
let's settle it among ourselves now.

303
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:05,453
Your wife wants to live with me.

304
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:08,152
Just give me few thousand,
that's settled.

305
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:09,886
You son of a bitch!

306
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,324
I want to kill you...

307
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:18,592
Don't!

308
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:20,728
Don't stop me from killing
that son of a bitch!

309
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,032
Go!

310
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,108
I want to kill you...

311
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:26,138
Go to hell!

312
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:35,745
Dad! Dad!

313
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:38,756
- Bee, go now...
- Go.

314
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,323
Don't go!

315
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,354
I wanna kill you bastard!
How dare you kill my dad!

316
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:46,463
- Bee, leave now!
- Don't go!

317
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:47,530
Go to hell!

318
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:51,096
Don't go!

319
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:10,546
Can you get the girl of that old bag?

320
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,589
Not yet, we don't know
where she is hiding!

321
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,157
Kill her once you get her.

322
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:15,191
Got you!

323
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:16,486
Why don't you leave now?

324
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:33,605
Excuse me...

325
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:45,357
Where is Bee?

326
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:46,119
I don't know!

327
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:47,056
There.

328
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,556
Go to hell!

329
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:52,593
Do you still want to escape?

330
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:54,860
You killed my dad?

331
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,662
Don't get mad, stay calm first!

332
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:58,566
I didn't mean to kill your dad!

333
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:02,138
I want to kill you bastard! Go to hell!

334
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:03,931
I will break your head!

335
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,001
Damn it! Do you want to kill me?

336
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:08,306
Damn it!

337
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:09,436
Get lost!

338
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:10,674
Fight back?

339
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:13,647
Bitch!

340
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:20,683
Damn it!

341
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:24,194
You are useless, she is coming alone,
how can you let her hurt me?

342
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:25,352
Drag her in.

343
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:26,863
Do you want to kill me?

344
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,657
Rape her! One by one.

345
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:33,301
Go out first.

346
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:35,637
Bitch! Damn it!

347
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:38,072
Let me do it first.

348
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:41,211
Go to hell!

349
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:44,507
Let's die together.

350
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:00,831
What happened?

351
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:02,332
Don't come over.

352
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:04,399
Don't come over!

353
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:07,402
Where is the car?

354
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,440
Not here! It's in the next floor.

355
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:11,407
Go down!

356
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,079
Don't kill me!

357
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,651
OK, but you should help me.

358
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:24,080
Why don't you tell me earlier?
I think you are great!

359
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:36,764
Hold it!

360
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:04,121
Where are they?

361
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,821
Come on, check over there,
and the rest follow me.

362
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:11,187
Smile!

363
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,758
- Who are you?
- Smile!

364
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,789
I am Sister Cindy.

365
00:24:34,787 --> 00:24:37,585
Have you waken up?
Why don't you sleep a bit longer?

366
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,584
What are you doing?

367
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:40,783
Eating noodle.

368
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:42,917
I will do your next finger after eating.

369
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:48,389
Are you crazy? You nuts!

370
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:53,999
You put me in deep shit!

371
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:55,198
Where are my fingers?

372
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:56,706
Where have you put them?

373
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,673
Why only 9 fingers are left?

374
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:02,543
I am so hungry...

375
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:05,446
I will finish your fingers right
after eating the noodle.

376
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:08,079
You want to chop this too?

377
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:11,447
I don't mean to chop it! I want to
change the finger prints for you.

378
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:13,218
What?

379
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:15,587
You are crazy!

380
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:17,293
But you are crazy!

381
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:20,425
Look at this.

382
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:24,234
A thief broke in a finance company
to rob and kill.

383
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:27,634
They lost a million cash
and some bank notes.

384
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:29,138
Now, the criminal is wanted
by the police with $100,000 award.

385
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:32,106
You are famous now!

386
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:35,710
How can you shoot in such a foolish way?

387
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:37,304
You left your finger prints
all over the scene!

388
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:39,847
You know, they have TV.

389
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:45,384
Now, other than changing your identity
and finger prints,

390
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:46,821
you still have a choice.

391
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:48,286
To be put behind bars.

392
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,553
And to be raped by the lesbians
once per day.

393
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:52,059
Bullied by those powerful women.

394
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:54,028
When you are released at 40.

395
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:56,433
Your look will be as old as
a 60 years' old granny.

396
00:25:57,236 --> 00:25:58,931
Nothing else you can do.

397
00:25:59,137 --> 00:26:00,434
But work in the nightclub.

398
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:03,540
Not to be club girl, or be the manger.

399
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:04,872
But to be the toilet maid.

400
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:05,941
Stop!

401
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:08,909
You recognise my face too.

402
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:13,143
We killers can't let any one
who recognise us to be alive!

403
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:14,307
Do you want to kill me?

404
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:16,183
I won't kill you!

405
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:17,222
Why do you help me?

406
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:18,621
It's your luck!

407
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:22,149
I have found that
you are born to be a killer.

408
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:23,386
What are you?

409
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:24,291
A killer!

410
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:25,455
Killer?

411
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,392
Professional killer.

412
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,124
Not common killer.

413
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:32,431
We clean the society too.

414
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:34,401
To clean away the rubbish of the world.

415
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:36,973
Like the scumbag Bee.

416
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:38,734
He deserved to be killed.

417
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:41,705
We killed those bad eggs only.

418
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:43,544
Do you want me to help you?

419
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:45,777
Not helping me, but help yourself.

420
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:48,409
You know, you are wanted.

421
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:54,219
Why to be killer?

422
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:55,453
To make big money.

423
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:57,923
After that,
you can control the things yourself.

424
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:01,930
You know, who is powerful,
who can give order.

425
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,762
Who is powerful, who can give order?

426
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:07,270
I don't think you will choose
to be put in prison.

427
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:10,504
This is your new information.

428
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:17,980
Shang Hill-qun?

429
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:20,107
Your job is air-hostess.

430
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:22,378
You are coming from Singapore,
23 years old.

431
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:24,785
You've no parents, but just one sister.

432
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,630
I am sleepy.

433
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:35,026
Come on!

434
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:37,164
What are you doing?

435
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:57,914
Who is he?

436
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,759
He is the wolf...

437
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:06,989
who raped many girls in Lamtin District.

438
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:08,462
I have watched him for a long time.

439
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,500
I just want to teach him a lesson.

440
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:12,001
Bitch, do you want me to rape you?

441
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,262
Let me do it!

442
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:14,635
Damn you bastard!

443
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:17,166
- Scumbag!
- Why did you beat me?

444
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:19,437
It's your bad luck to meet Miss Kitty!

445
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:22,605
Come on, why do you stop?

446
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:27,541
Where are you, Sister Cindy?

447
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:30,119
Are you taking weapon?
Give me the knife to cut his balls out!

448
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:33,383
I want you to try the taste of danger!

449
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:36,318
I won't open the door for you.

450
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:38,027
Open up! You bitch!

451
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:40,256
The key is put round the man's waist.

452
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,491
Either he rape you,

453
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:42,963
or you kill him!

454
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:44,195
Bitch! Open the door,

455
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:45,358
or I will break your tits!

456
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:47,904
I will count 3, One, two...

457
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:53,266
Go to hell!

458
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:12,855
You bitch, I want to burst your tits!

459
00:29:16,368 --> 00:29:18,461
You bitch! I want to burst your tits.

460
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:24,240
3 minutes and 7 seconds.

461
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,707
That's too slow.

462
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:28,809
I have put 10 pieces of glasses,

463
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,371
4 screwdrivers, 2 bricks and a wire.

464
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,847
And I put a gun down below the wall.

465
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:34,576
You still needed 3 minutes to kill him!

466
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:36,784
You have poor judgement.

467
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:38,822
What if I was raped by that nuts?

468
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:41,686
Then, you should blame yourself
of being shit!

469
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,352
Remember,

470
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:46,022
when you have no choice but to kill.

471
00:29:46,131 --> 00:29:48,326
You should find any weapon
which could kill.

472
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,392
But how about having no weapons?

473
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:53,500
Use your brain.

474
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:59,275
We women, our body is weapon too!

475
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:01,935
How about if we have no tits?

476
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:03,604
Can you let me touch a bit longer?

477
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:08,678
Men, just to please them.

478
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:16,758
No matter you have big tits
or small tits, it doesn't matter.

479
00:30:17,496 --> 00:30:19,191
Just to make them happy.

480
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:24,500
Can you explain it?

481
00:30:24,603 --> 00:30:27,197
I am a killer, but not a hooker.

482
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,598
It's just the same!

483
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,701
Big tits, small tits, even no tits...

484
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:35,039
No big deal!

485
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:39,882
Come on, beat me!

486
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:41,851
I have knife, I have advantage!

487
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:47,621
Help!

488
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:49,788
You are useless,
why do you still cry for help?

489
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:51,294
Just think how to defeat me!

490
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:54,523
You are twisting my leg!
How can I rebel?

491
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,396
OK, now twist my leg.

492
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:58,229
You would be in deep shit!

493
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:02,004
I am hurt! Stop...

494
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:03,971
The principle of killing,

495
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:06,734
anything you get in hand,

496
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,512
will become the killing weapon.

497
00:31:10,582 --> 00:31:12,982
Besides knife or sword,

498
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:18,379
high heel shoes, socks,
and teeth brush...

499
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:20,020
Teeth brush?

500
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:24,387
I used a teeth brush
to stab into a man's nose.

501
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,831
It reached the brain, and he was killed.

502
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:34,370
But, the most powerful weapon is...

503
00:31:35,974 --> 00:31:37,874
Our bodies.

504
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:44,338
No matter men or women.

505
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:52,314
Just to make them impulse,
that is his weakest time.

506
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,460
No one can resist from that!

507
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:01,929
At that time,

508
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:11,572
that's the most perfect moment to kill.

509
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:19,544
To kill with full confidence,

510
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:22,442
you should study
the target's information first.

511
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:25,252
So, you can pose him to be your enemy.

512
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:28,658
To make a file for him.

513
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:34,558
You should know his living habit,
the place he often goes.

514
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:38,658
His hobby, his merits
and his shortcomings,

515
00:32:39,304 --> 00:32:40,703
and his temper too.

516
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:43,868
Even his sex habit.

517
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:47,975
Sex, is the wonder weapon of us.

518
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:52,041
No matter men or women,

519
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:56,781
they will be attracted by sex.

520
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:03,086
One of your senior, she is a lesbian.

521
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:05,726
Senior?

522
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:09,160
Stop mentioning about her.

523
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:14,700
Anyway, you should know pretty well
about your enemy.

524
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:16,670
Let me teach you how to make that file.

525
00:33:18,276 --> 00:33:19,675
Isn't it so?

526
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,079
How do you have my file?

527
00:33:23,214 --> 00:33:27,344
I searched your stuffs
when you went out.

528
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:29,883
Don't you afraid I would discover that?

529
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:32,615
You went to Mainland 4 years ago.

530
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,691
I think you have forgot that thing.

531
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:37,019
You are named Shaw Bing.

532
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:39,756
You are 35 years old, Scorpio.

533
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:42,298
You wear 36D bra.

534
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:43,924
You have the habit of drinking red wine.

535
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:47,196
You don't have sex life
for quite a long time.

536
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:48,769
How do you know that?

537
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:53,674
You masturbated twice in these 5 nights.

538
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:56,007
How dare you peep me!

539
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:01,946
I peep you every night.

540
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:04,453
Don't shout so loud next time.

541
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:05,783
Our neighbors can hear it.

542
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,052
You are bad enough!

543
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:12,993
Remember? We are killers!

544
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,098
But I tell you.

545
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:19,829
Those I killed were all bad eggs
who deserved being killed.

546
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:22,564
Only your senior,

547
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:27,076
She loves money only.

548
00:34:27,345 --> 00:34:29,336
She will kill her own dad too.

549
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:31,109
You don't want to mention her!

550
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,844
She is the most famous killer
in our circle.

551
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,718
You will meet her sooner or later,

552
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:39,946
but be careful.

553
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:41,786
I know she is powerful!

554
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,191
How do you know that?

555
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:48,090
If not so, you won't make her file!

556
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:51,759
You are really smart!

557
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:54,329
But we should be careful!

558
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:04,781
Have you asked your fellow
to buy you breakfast?

559
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:06,577
They are buying.

560
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:09,812
What are you wondering?
Are you still thinking of the girl?

561
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:11,318
She killed many people,

562
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:12,979
it's troublesome for you
to meet her again!

563
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:15,615
The buddies of Bee
are searching for her.

564
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:21,189
Don't you think Kitty is poor?

565
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:22,526
You should show mercy to yourself first.

566
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:26,566
It's too cruel for you
to take my only cigarette.

567
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:28,270
The murderer is more cruel than that!

568
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,140
This case is more horrible.

569
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:33,870
The victim lost the penis!

570
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:35,940
What?

571
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:38,407
Our buddy is questioning
the Philippine maid.

572
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:39,710
I don't know.

573
00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:42,644
Sir, your breakfast, sausage with eggs.

574
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:44,477
What did you hear last night?

575
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:45,748
I don't know.

576
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:47,721
I don't know.

577
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:50,523
Did your master sleep with you?

578
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:51,720
I don't know.

579
00:35:51,863 --> 00:35:53,057
Who touched your ass?

580
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:54,290
You wolf!

581
00:35:56,301 --> 00:35:57,199
What's happened?

582
00:35:57,402 --> 00:35:59,199
Sir, they can not find...

583
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:02,836
They can't find the...

584
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:04,533
What?

585
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:06,704
The stick?

586
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:08,775
What's stick?

587
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:11,247
Bird, bird!

588
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:13,373
Bird? What's bird?

589
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:15,814
You don't know bird?

590
00:36:15,854 --> 00:36:17,151
I don't know bird.

591
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:23,419
I don't know what are you talking about.

592
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:24,550
What's the matter?

593
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:27,060
I don't know how to tell him
that his penis was missing.

594
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:31,626
Just tell me penis!

595
00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:32,725
You shit-head!

596
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:37,230
Bastard!

597
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:48,877
Why don't they heat the sausage first?
It's cold.

598
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:51,982
There is some flesh up there.

599
00:36:53,825 --> 00:36:54,917
What is it?

600
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:56,984
- It seems to be the balls.
- What?

601
00:36:57,095 --> 00:36:58,289
Scrotum!

602
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:00,660
The color is smiliar to the one
which you are holding.

603
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:03,232
Don't you want me to lose my appetite?
Never!

604
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:10,198
Are there a girl bathing?
What are you staring?

605
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:12,603
There is a woman standing
and watching here for a long time.

606
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:14,371
What does that mean?

607
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,336
There is a precedent in the study
of criminal psychology.

608
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:19,575
The murderer loves to
come back to the scene.

609
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:22,342
You mean the girl is the murderer?

610
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,517
I suspected that it is related to
a female killer group.

611
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:27,954
Like the last case,
and the case of Kitty.

612
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:29,718
She was staying with a woman.

613
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:34,823
I suspected that
it's related to the last case.

614
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:37,126
The head won't trust you.

615
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:38,529
I do.

616
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,461
I have listened your opinion.

617
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:46,474
I think there are more than
one female killers who worked nearby.

618
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:49,808
They use different ways of killing,
some are brutal and some are not.

619
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:53,042
I will inform your boss to send you
join the investigation.

620
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:54,047
Thank you Sir.

621
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:55,277
OK!

622
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:56,984
You will have chance now.

623
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:59,079
If you let me choose,
I prefer seeing Kitty again.

624
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:02,758
Look at you,
it seems you have eaten the penis.

625
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:06,924
Have you eaten the lost penis?

626
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:11,563
What?
Don't you think I have eaten the penis?

627
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:24,406
Kitty...

628
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,691
Sister Cindy,
I have put the key on their bodies.

629
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,661
And I have removed all the weapons.

630
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,225
The wolves will burst your tits
this time!

631
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,436
Come on!

632
00:39:43,027 --> 00:39:45,325
I admire you so much!

633
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:50,599
Kitty, you will carry
your first mission tomorrow.

634
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:52,034
I will take you to kill a Japanese.

635
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,070
He is called Taki.

636
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:03,744
To kill someone in Japan?

637
00:41:36,908 --> 00:41:38,705
Should I wait you at the entrance?

638
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:41,536
Are you nuts?

639
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:43,040
Sure!

640
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:45,044
If someone tricks me,

641
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:46,480
I will sell you to be gigolo
for one year.

642
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:52,415
I... I...I...
I was born in Beijing!

643
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,182
You sing very well!

644
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:56,650
Damn you! It's the password!

645
00:41:57,995 --> 00:41:59,189
Where is my aphrodisiac?

646
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:02,388
Boss, here it is!

647
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,699
Why did you spray it to your mouth?

648
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,004
To make the tongue harder, I guess!

649
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:18,375
What is your name?

650
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:19,877
My name is Baby.

651
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:21,311
Baby?

652
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,721
Do you dare
playing some exciting sex game?

653
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:29,225
I won't mind exciting sex game!

654
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,156
OK!

655
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:23,532
After this job,
should we go to Hawaii for vacation?

656
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:26,165
No.

657
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:30,777
We have a big deal left.

658
00:44:32,116 --> 00:44:33,413
What is it?

659
00:44:34,752 --> 00:44:39,587
I am ordered by the Japs
to kill one person.

660
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:43,555
A person who is difficult to be killed.

661
00:44:44,495 --> 00:44:46,087
Who is it?

662
00:44:46,464 --> 00:44:47,761
It is...

663
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:49,998
Sister Cindy.

664
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:53,432
Isn't she your master?

665
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:57,034
My master is difficult to deal with.

666
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:00,942
I have heard that she has a new student.

667
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:08,916
I wonder... are we sufficient
to kill them together?

668
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,182
We should kill them one by one.

669
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,852
First,
we should kill her genius student!

670
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:23,358
Do you agree?

671
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:25,534
Sure!

672
00:45:36,414 --> 00:45:39,508
You have tried every means
to join my dept.

673
00:45:39,617 --> 00:45:42,711
I can't reject anymore since
you have applied for so many times.

674
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,818
Thank you Sir.

675
00:45:43,988 --> 00:45:45,979
About the chained homicide cases
happened recently,

676
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:51,127
the way of murdering is like
those happened half year's before.

677
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:56,890
Our head considered your presumption
of a killer's group,

678
00:45:57,034 --> 00:45:59,025
and a branch leader of a triad society
died last night,

679
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:04,198
the way he died
was similar to those cases.

680
00:46:04,241 --> 00:46:07,870
His limbs,
including his penis were all broken.

681
00:46:08,012 --> 00:46:11,106
It's like to be teared off
at the same time.

682
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:12,543
Are there any clue?

683
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:15,677
Yes, few hours before
the murderer was killed.

684
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:18,253
Someone saw that he was staying
with an air-hostess.

685
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:19,583
Is she the suspect?

686
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:22,217
I do want you to tell me.

687
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:49,111
An air-hostess lives in
such a big house!

688
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:50,447
She must be a mistress of a rich man!

689
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:51,715
The house may belong to her dad!

690
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:52,949
I think it's the house
of her sugar daddy.

691
00:46:57,495 --> 00:46:58,689
Who are you looking for?

692
00:46:58,829 --> 00:46:59,921
We are cops.

693
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:02,264
We'd like to meet Miss Shang Hill-qun.

694
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:07,663
Miss, there are 2 cops looking for you!

695
00:47:14,645 --> 00:47:16,237
Are you cops?

696
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:17,302
Kitty?

697
00:47:20,484 --> 00:47:21,576
Kitty!

698
00:47:26,056 --> 00:47:27,455
I haven't raised any kitty.

699
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:30,983
I am Tinam, Kitty!

700
00:47:32,163 --> 00:47:34,961
I am sorry, I am called Shang Hill-qun.

701
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:37,096
I think you have mistaken me.

702
00:47:37,168 --> 00:47:40,763
By the way, you can call me Vivian.

703
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:44,430
Sorry,
I mistake you as one of my old friends.

704
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:46,100
May I know what you are looking me for?

705
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,703
I want you to assist us
to investigate a homicide case.

706
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:52,939
It's related to Mr. Kan Tin San.

707
00:47:55,586 --> 00:47:57,076
I don't know this guy.

708
00:47:57,154 --> 00:47:58,849
At 10 p.m., October 2,

709
00:47:58,956 --> 00:48:01,356
someone saw you staying with the victim.

710
00:48:03,027 --> 00:48:04,927
I met him in the cocktail party.

711
00:48:05,062 --> 00:48:07,360
He just wanted to send me home.

712
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:09,398
So you are the last one
who saw him before his death.

713
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,092
Hope you can give me a statement.

714
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:14,369
No problem, I have to get changed first.

715
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:20,004
Shit head!

716
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,099
What is it?

717
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:22,970
Don't you think she is like Kitty?

718
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,274
Who is Kitty?

719
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:26,073
Kitty is the girl who came to look for
Officer Lee some times ago.

720
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,548
You have so many girlfriends,
how can I remember all?

721
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,717
I am sure Officer Lee
will recognise her!

722
00:48:30,988 --> 00:48:32,979
It's a serious case,

723
00:48:33,257 --> 00:48:35,350
tell the buddies not to spread
any news to press.

724
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:36,188
What's the matter?

725
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,554
There is an accident of Officer Lee.

726
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:43,097
Detective Ti!

727
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,270
Why did Officer Lee suicide?

728
00:48:49,406 --> 00:48:50,202
I don't know,

729
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:52,807
5 minutes ago, I heard a gun shot.

730
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:55,343
I rushed in, and saw him in the blood!

731
00:49:02,853 --> 00:49:04,753
Few hours before he died,

732
00:49:04,888 --> 00:49:07,482
Someone saw him staying
with an air-hostess.

733
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:18,264
Shit-head, take a statement.

734
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:20,097
Are there anything happened?

735
00:49:20,371 --> 00:49:22,066
When did you reach the cocktail party?

736
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:23,333
8:30 p.m.

737
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:24,973
What kind of cocktail party?

738
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:26,904
A film's premier gala.

739
00:49:26,977 --> 00:49:28,569
I was invited by my girlfriend,

740
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:30,271
but she didn't come.

741
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:32,178
What is the victim called?

742
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:36,347
Isn't it Mr. Kan?

743
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:38,380
Yes, it's him.

744
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:42,354
He came and chatted with me.

745
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:45,553
The cocktail party was so boring,
so was the film!

746
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:47,219
He promised to send me home,
so I went with him.

747
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:48,523
Where do you live?

748
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,094
No. 99, Old Peak Road.

749
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,867
Are you used to look at the man
like this?

750
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:56,199
Am I handsome?

751
00:49:58,008 --> 00:50:03,241
Among the men in Hongkong,
you are quite handsome.

752
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:07,273
Forget this line.

753
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:18,622
Are you free for dinner tonight?

754
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:22,897
Let's eat beef set?

755
00:50:36,213 --> 00:50:37,510
Isn't it delicious?

756
00:50:40,818 --> 00:50:42,718
Are you alright, sir?

757
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:45,413
I am fine.

758
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:51,753
You do want to prove me
to be your ex-girlfriend.

759
00:50:51,862 --> 00:50:54,353
Yes, you are my ex-girlfriend.

760
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:56,556
I have told you many times, I am not!

761
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,192
But,
I am glad to be a substitute of love.

762
00:51:04,074 --> 00:51:05,564
- David.
- Tinam.

763
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:06,768
I don't think you can't recognise her.

764
00:51:06,877 --> 00:51:09,368
She is Kitty
who taught Tommy a great lesson!

765
00:51:09,446 --> 00:51:11,744
I am sure I can recognise Kitty.

766
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:16,111
I have witness, Kitty.

767
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:22,016
Detective Ti,
where is Kitty whom you mentioned?

768
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:23,751
Are you crazy? She is sitting here.

769
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:25,851
Do you mean it?

770
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:28,327
She doesn't seem to be Kitty.

771
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:31,261
Don't fool me!

772
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:32,665
I dare not!

773
00:51:32,836 --> 00:51:34,428
If you want me to say yes,

774
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:35,835
I will return you the money.

775
00:51:36,573 --> 00:51:39,872
Detective Ti, I think you miss
your ex-girlfriend very much.

776
00:51:39,943 --> 00:51:42,537
If not, you won't mistake me as her.

777
00:51:42,646 --> 00:51:46,548
You are right, I am fond of that girl.

778
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:49,012
Not long ago,
she got involved in a homicide case,

779
00:51:49,253 --> 00:51:51,744
I wanted to find her out and help her.

780
00:51:51,889 --> 00:51:53,584
But I could never get in touch with her.

781
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:57,259
She seems to be disappeared
in this world!

782
00:51:57,361 --> 00:51:58,658
If the girl knows that,

783
00:51:58,796 --> 00:52:00,593
I think she will be touched.

784
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:01,891
Really?

785
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:03,899
Detective Ti, I want to leave now.

786
00:52:06,403 --> 00:52:07,495
OK

787
00:52:24,888 --> 00:52:26,879
David...

788
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:29,915
Fuck!

789
00:52:32,262 --> 00:52:34,753
Call the ambulance!

790
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:36,793
David...

791
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,197
I am Tinam!

792
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:47,537
I am Shit-head,
the air-hostess has been shot.

793
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:49,306
She is now in the hospital,
she wants to see you.

794
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,672
Oh shit!

795
00:52:54,618 --> 00:52:57,610
Kitty...

796
00:52:58,856 --> 00:53:00,050
Tinam!

797
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:01,384
This is for you!

798
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:04,323
The flowers are pretty!

799
00:53:04,495 --> 00:53:05,792
Are you Kitty?

800
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:25,738
Do you know you are in great danger?

801
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:42,328
Are you still thinking of that girl?

802
00:53:42,432 --> 00:53:43,729
She must be Kitty.

803
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:46,792
Her eyes!
I can tell she is Kitty from her eyes!

804
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:49,065
She doesn't admit,
you can't prove she is.

805
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:51,833
But, the witness died one after one.

806
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:55,040
The girl is dangerous,
it's not wise of you to go with her.

807
00:53:55,112 --> 00:53:58,309
That's why I want to find the truth.

808
00:53:58,515 --> 00:54:01,109
Do you think you are superman?
You are a cop only.

809
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:04,016
We have a gun more.

810
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:06,054
My instinct tells me that,

811
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:09,181
something you can't do it by force.

812
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,759
Just do what you're instructed,
or you would be in deep shit.

813
00:54:11,862 --> 00:54:14,626
I just want to tell you a secret.

814
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:16,756
After killing my brother.

815
00:54:16,934 --> 00:54:18,333
I have become impotent.

816
00:54:19,102 --> 00:54:20,899
What? That's shit!

817
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:22,666
I have never impulse.

818
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,941
After seeing Kitty, on the next day,
I woke up...

819
00:54:26,043 --> 00:54:27,533
I had erected.

820
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:30,176
Congratulations.

821
00:54:30,347 --> 00:54:31,939
Until seeing her by the pool side,

822
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:34,015
I have the sense of impulse.

823
00:54:34,484 --> 00:54:38,580
Don't you want to tell me
only she can cure your impotence?

824
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:02,136
Kitty!

825
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:05,575
Who are you looking for?

826
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:07,139
I am sorry, I am looking for Miss Shang.

827
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:09,250
She hasn't returned yet.

828
00:55:09,286 --> 00:55:10,275
Well, I'd better leave first.

829
00:55:10,387 --> 00:55:11,376
Wait!

830
00:55:13,523 --> 00:55:15,013
Just come in to take a seat.

831
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:25,093
Take it.

832
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:27,730
Thank you.

833
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:29,895
How do you know I love drinking Vodka?

834
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:34,643
For men,

835
00:55:35,178 --> 00:55:37,169
it's of no reason for them
to reject Vodka.

836
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,741
I am the sister of Hill-qun.

837
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:46,585
They called me Sister Cindy.

838
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:52,460
Is she called Shang Hill-qun?

839
00:55:52,663 --> 00:55:53,960
From my lawyer,

840
00:55:54,665 --> 00:55:58,465
I know that my sister is no relation
with the case.

841
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:03,195
It mustn't be business for you
to come to her again.

842
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:13,642
My sister, she has many boyfriends.

843
00:56:18,655 --> 00:56:20,145
Do you have confidence?

844
00:56:20,457 --> 00:56:22,755
Sure I do!

845
00:56:25,162 --> 00:56:29,758
I love this kind of man!

846
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:31,823
I am sorry, I want to add some ice.

847
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:38,668
I have heard that...

848
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:43,513
You mistaken my sister as another person.

849
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:46,004
I am sure she is one of my friends!

850
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:48,945
Sorry, I am leaving.

851
00:56:50,053 --> 00:56:50,951
Who do you think she is?

852
00:56:50,987 --> 00:56:52,147
A person whom I would never forget.

853
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:53,178
Sister Cindy.

854
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:56,753
Kitty!

855
00:56:56,893 --> 00:56:59,487
What are you doing?
Do you want to court me?

856
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:04,227
Just give him a chance!

857
00:57:05,001 --> 00:57:06,195
Have dinner here tonight, OK?

858
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:07,961
He is busy.

859
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,939
Sorry, I want to get changed first.

860
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:15,739
My boyfriend will
come to pick me up later.

861
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:19,075
I know you are not Kitty.

862
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:21,542
But in case you are Kitty,

863
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:23,117
I do want to help you.

864
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:28,582
May I be excused.

865
00:57:30,927 --> 00:57:32,121
See you!

866
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:37,431
Why do you stop me from killing him?

867
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:40,161
He is a cop,
it'd be troublesome for him to die here.

868
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:42,432
I can make his corpse disappear!

869
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:44,336
But someone would know
he has visited here.

870
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:45,738
Say the one inside the police station,

871
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:48,840
I could kill them
without any clues left.

872
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:50,640
No one will suspect us.

873
00:57:51,148 --> 00:57:53,946
I think, you don't want him to die.

874
00:57:54,084 --> 00:57:56,075
He is not worth dying!

875
00:57:57,521 --> 00:58:01,321
He knows to much!

876
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:05,360
And he is suspecting you too.

877
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,726
If I don't kill him,
you will be killed one day.

878
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:15,699
Remember our principle.

879
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:17,706
Don't be controlled by your emotion.

880
00:58:17,874 --> 00:58:19,171
I can do it myself.

881
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:21,201
Can you?

882
00:58:22,479 --> 00:58:23,776
Are you that hard-hearted?

883
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,472
There is always the first time.

884
00:58:26,616 --> 00:58:31,110
This house is exposed,

885
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:33,318
I want to sell it.

886
00:58:34,057 --> 00:58:36,150
I will arrange you to some place else.

887
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:40,790
Enjoy your first time.

888
00:58:41,832 --> 00:58:42,924
Don't disappoint me.

889
00:59:32,883 --> 00:59:33,975
Are you searching for your pager?

890
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,244
When did you come in?

891
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:39,754
I have come in for a long time.

892
00:59:40,523 --> 00:59:42,218
But I don't want to bother you.

893
00:59:42,993 --> 00:59:45,587
Lower your voice next time.

894
00:59:45,729 --> 00:59:48,027
Don't bother our neighbors.

895
00:59:49,232 --> 00:59:50,631
Give me back the pager.

896
00:59:53,236 --> 00:59:54,931
He does love you!

897
00:59:55,338 --> 00:59:57,329
No wonder you miss him that much!

898
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:01,442
Why do you change the battery so often?

899
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:03,010
I haven't thought of him.

900
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,581
I want to tell you.

901
01:00:08,018 --> 01:00:11,215
The Japs want to take revenge,
they hired Princess to kill us.

902
01:00:11,388 --> 01:00:12,377
Princess?

903
01:00:15,926 --> 01:00:17,518
She is your senior.

904
01:00:18,295 --> 01:00:21,196
You should be careful!
Don't let her see you.

905
01:00:21,331 --> 01:00:24,425
May be, she will kill after raping you.

906
01:00:27,671 --> 01:00:29,662
The men are all heartless.

907
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:32,602
Don't fall in love with men.

908
01:00:33,043 --> 01:00:35,841
Otherwise, you will be the loser.

909
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:40,581
Shit.

910
01:01:19,022 --> 01:01:20,421
Have you waited long?

911
01:01:31,368 --> 01:01:32,960
Do you miss me?

912
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:37,102
I miss you so much!

913
01:02:12,742 --> 01:02:13,834
Kitty!

914
01:02:16,813 --> 01:02:19,509
I am Hill-qun, don't come to me again.

915
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:24,152
What are you going?
You are totally different!

916
01:02:24,387 --> 01:02:27,185
Yes, I was forced to do so.

917
01:02:27,457 --> 01:02:28,947
I don't even know you.

918
01:02:30,827 --> 01:02:31,816
Kitty.

919
01:02:33,129 --> 01:02:35,620
I am Shang Hill-qun,
I come from Singapore.

920
01:02:35,765 --> 01:02:37,960
All the documents can prove my identity.

921
01:02:41,137 --> 01:02:42,229
Take it back.

922
01:02:42,272 --> 01:02:43,364
You are lying.

923
01:02:44,574 --> 01:02:46,974
You are Kitty, don't deny it.

924
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:49,603
No!

925
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:36,255
Are you Kitty?

926
01:06:50,586 --> 01:06:54,488
Princess,
you didn't seem to make love with me.

927
01:06:56,192 --> 01:06:57,989
You enjoyed so much,

928
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:00,852
how can you say that?

929
01:07:02,065 --> 01:07:04,465
Although you are holding me,

930
01:07:05,068 --> 01:07:08,560
you are thinking of her.

931
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:13,400
What are you doing?

932
01:07:15,845 --> 01:07:19,246
When did you start jealousing?

933
01:07:22,018 --> 01:07:24,316
If you don't, why didn't you kill her?

934
01:07:27,824 --> 01:07:30,019
You are not listening to me.

935
01:07:31,994 --> 01:07:35,987
You know the result of not obeying me?

936
01:07:48,411 --> 01:07:49,605
I want her by all means.

937
01:07:57,587 --> 01:07:59,885
Why didn't you admit yourself
to be Kitty?

938
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:02,323
Because I am a professional killer now.

939
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,153
We have conflicts in our jobs.

940
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,455
My master afraid my identity
would be disclosed by you.

941
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:08,086
She would kill you.

942
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:11,861
Sister Cindy is your master, isn't she?

943
01:08:14,103 --> 01:08:16,094
If not were me to save you
in the carpark,

944
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:17,934
you would have been killed.

945
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:22,338
About those homicide cases
which left no clues behind,

946
01:08:22,712 --> 01:08:24,202
are they all done by you?

947
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,680
We killed those who deserved dying.

948
01:08:26,849 --> 01:08:29,841
Only my senior,
she kills with no reason.

949
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,210
What do you have in mind?

950
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:34,681
Either you give up your job,

951
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,255
or I give up mine.

952
01:08:41,664 --> 01:08:43,564
Or, forget each other.

953
01:08:44,734 --> 01:08:46,429
Does your master want to kill me?

954
01:08:48,604 --> 01:08:49,901
I will talk to her.

955
01:08:51,808 --> 01:08:53,605
It's not the good timing
to talk such thing.

956
01:09:11,527 --> 01:09:13,825
I will talk to Sister Cindy later.

957
01:09:13,963 --> 01:09:16,363
If anything happens,
you'd better leave first.

958
01:09:16,466 --> 01:09:18,263
She is a woman only.

959
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:21,199
How can you help me?
Show me how you hold a gun!

960
01:09:42,391 --> 01:09:43,585
Sister Cindy.

961
01:09:44,227 --> 01:09:46,218
You haven't visited me for a long time!

962
01:09:47,296 --> 01:09:48,695
You are heartless!

963
01:09:56,706 --> 01:09:58,105
Is she my junior?

964
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:01,833
She is pretty.

965
01:10:02,144 --> 01:10:04,442
She is the one whom I always mention,
Princess!

966
01:10:04,647 --> 01:10:05,944
Princess.

967
01:10:17,226 --> 01:10:18,523
She is Baby!

968
01:10:18,928 --> 01:10:20,725
Greet them!

969
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:23,690
Baby.

970
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:26,690
He is Tinam!

971
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:28,464
I have met him before!

972
01:10:28,571 --> 01:10:30,163
When did you see me?

973
01:10:34,243 --> 01:10:35,835
I have seen you completely!

974
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:43,646
Sister Cindy said,
you are even better than me!

975
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,912
She is just kidding!

976
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:48,188
Having 2 wonderful students,

977
01:10:48,758 --> 01:10:49,952
I think I have to retire!

978
01:10:50,059 --> 01:10:51,651
You can't put it that way.

979
01:10:51,894 --> 01:10:54,385
Can you retire?

980
01:10:55,898 --> 01:10:58,696
You should appreciate that...

981
01:10:58,834 --> 01:11:01,632
I visit you once
I come back to Hong Kong.

982
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:05,165
But, after I leave your house,

983
01:11:06,509 --> 01:11:08,602
we may be enemies.

984
01:11:09,378 --> 01:11:10,572
I know!

985
01:11:10,713 --> 01:11:11,805
My lovely junior,

986
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:14,775
I think,
you and I will be the best partners.

987
01:11:16,686 --> 01:11:20,952
Only we kill, but not to be killed.

988
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,719
But I am not interested.

989
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:27,022
You'd better try!

990
01:11:27,964 --> 01:11:33,459
What man can do,
I can do better than them.

991
01:11:35,171 --> 01:11:36,468
Are you alright?

992
01:11:37,607 --> 01:11:39,598
I'm fine, she is a killer.

993
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:43,608
You have small one,
how can you compare with me?

994
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:48,010
Sister Cindy, we are leaving!

995
01:11:49,218 --> 01:11:51,812
But before leaving,
may I give you a kiss?

996
01:11:51,954 --> 01:11:52,750
Sister Cindy

997
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:56,356
Sure!

998
01:12:33,162 --> 01:12:34,254
Let's go, Baby!

999
01:12:45,608 --> 01:12:46,905
Stop searching!

1000
01:12:47,843 --> 01:12:49,538
She is taught by me.

1001
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:52,944
I know what she wants.

1002
01:12:55,051 --> 01:12:57,952
From now on, she will be back any time.

1003
01:12:58,421 --> 01:12:59,513
You'd better leave.

1004
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:02,386
Sister Cindy, Tinam and I...

1005
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:05,289
I can't even protect myself,
why should I kill him?

1006
01:13:05,428 --> 01:13:06,520
I want to stay and help you.

1007
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:07,789
Look at yourself in the mirror!

1008
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:09,830
Your eyes are no longer fierce looking!

1009
01:13:10,032 --> 01:13:11,829
You are no longer a good killer.

1010
01:13:12,034 --> 01:13:13,524
- I...
- Shut up!

1011
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:16,161
Killer can't fall in love!

1012
01:13:16,505 --> 01:13:18,097
Once she has love,

1013
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:20,006
she won't kill with barbarity!

1014
01:13:20,176 --> 01:13:22,269
Otherwise,
you will be easily killed by your enemy.

1015
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:24,037
Go now.

1016
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,281
Why don't find the cops?

1017
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:26,578
Cops?

1018
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:31,512
I killed many people!

1019
01:13:31,654 --> 01:13:35,249
Should the cops arrest me,
or arrest her?

1020
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:41,462
I put your dowry inside the pillar.

1021
01:13:42,231 --> 01:13:44,631
Come and take it back when it's safe.

1022
01:13:44,734 --> 01:13:45,928
Sister Cindy!

1023
01:13:56,879 --> 01:13:58,073
OK, let's go!

1024
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,855
Why are you driving that fast?

1025
01:14:12,928 --> 01:14:15,123
I want to drop you in a safe place.

1026
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:16,959
Now, it's safe!

1027
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:36,215
I am sorry!

1028
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:52,459
Come out!

1029
01:14:52,668 --> 01:14:54,158
I am long waiting for you.

1030
01:14:56,605 --> 01:14:58,698
Sister Cindy, you are really great!

1031
01:14:58,908 --> 01:15:01,900
I can't stop keeping fit once
you are alive.

1032
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:29,269
Do you feel painful?

1033
01:15:29,371 --> 01:15:30,360
Why?

1034
01:15:30,472 --> 01:15:31,666
It's you who taught me.

1035
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:34,140
A killer should never fall in love,

1036
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:36,508
and should not let others know
about his living habit.

1037
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:42,078
It's no reason,
this wine is newly opened.

1038
01:15:42,151 --> 01:15:43,345
There is no problem with the wine.

1039
01:15:43,452 --> 01:15:44,749
But, do you remember?

1040
01:15:44,854 --> 01:15:46,754
I kissed you before I left.

1041
01:15:47,022 --> 01:15:49,513
My lip-stick, plus your wine,

1042
01:15:49,692 --> 01:15:50,989
has become severe poison!

1043
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,658
So, you are poisoned, but I am not.

1044
01:15:57,299 --> 01:15:58,596
You are heartless!

1045
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,913
You can't even shoot the cripple!
Go and eat shit, men!

1046
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,864
Sister Cindy, I have found that...

1047
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,534
Your legs are more and more pretty.

1048
01:16:42,177 --> 01:16:44,077
I don't want to leave it!

1049
01:16:46,415 --> 01:16:48,315
What do you want? You want to suicide?

1050
01:16:48,484 --> 01:16:49,678
Not that easy!

1051
01:16:55,591 --> 01:16:58,082
I have found that...

1052
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:02,162
You are a perfect wonderful killer!

1053
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:04,495
Don't you know that...

1054
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,100
You can live for 10 more minutes,

1055
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:13,731
Have you tried the greatest killer
in the world?

1056
01:17:13,876 --> 01:17:15,070
Not yet!

1057
01:17:15,177 --> 01:17:17,975
You shit-heads! Go to hell!

1058
01:17:20,683 --> 01:17:22,378
If you are fast,

1059
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:24,384
you can have her for 5 to 6 times.

1060
01:17:25,621 --> 01:17:27,612
Sister Cindy, enjoy yourself!

1061
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:30,087
Baby, let's go!

1062
01:17:44,006 --> 01:17:46,099
Sister Cindy...

1063
01:17:48,177 --> 01:17:52,580
Sister Cindy...

1064
01:17:52,681 --> 01:17:53,978
What happened?

1065
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:56,779
Tell me, who did that?

1066
01:17:57,886 --> 01:17:59,877
Sister Cindy...

1067
01:18:03,325 --> 01:18:04,417
What's the matter?

1068
01:18:05,461 --> 01:18:09,864
Don't! Sister Cindy!

1069
01:18:17,139 --> 01:18:20,131
Kitty, when you see this tape,

1070
01:18:20,275 --> 01:18:21,970
I would no longer be in this world.

1071
01:18:22,211 --> 01:18:24,111
Don't feel sad for me.

1072
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:26,146
It's the fate of all killers!

1073
01:18:26,281 --> 01:18:28,772
I am glad to see you getting your love.

1074
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:31,909
Forget the revenge,
you can't defeat Princess.

1075
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:35,855
Because you have love in your heart,
but Princess haven't!

1076
01:18:36,025 --> 01:18:39,722
Here are some pictures for your memory,
leave as fast as you can.

1077
01:18:39,895 --> 01:18:41,192
Sister Cindy!

1078
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:46,259
Princess?

1079
01:18:49,138 --> 01:18:50,628
You haven't locked the door.

1080
01:18:53,575 --> 01:18:55,873
It doesn't matter.

1081
01:18:56,945 --> 01:18:59,140
Can you wake up?

1082
01:18:59,782 --> 01:19:03,274
The girl is mysterious!
She appears and vanishs any time.

1083
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:05,814
She killed many lives too.

1084
01:19:06,088 --> 01:19:08,579
If you keep on like this, you will die!

1085
01:19:10,225 --> 01:19:12,216
Don't you think I am happy now?

1086
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:14,352
You look poor! Shit-head!

1087
01:19:20,536 --> 01:19:22,936
I prefer to be killed by her.
At least, I would be happier!

1088
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:25,029
Stop it! You nuts!

1089
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:30,310
Take some food first,
I have bought you some chicken.

1090
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:34,307
Shit-head, are you my friend?

1091
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:35,680
You should help me!

1092
01:19:37,553 --> 01:19:40,647
Your gun is collected by the gun room,
you are on vacation!

1093
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:42,723
It would be dangerous
if you get involved!

1094
01:19:42,825 --> 01:19:46,022
I don't mind the guns,
I can't even hold it.

1095
01:19:48,197 --> 01:19:49,289
Where are you going to?

1096
01:19:50,466 --> 01:19:54,163
I want to get an informant for Kitty.

1097
01:19:58,407 --> 01:19:59,499
Come here.

1098
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,172
Boss, what's the matter?

1099
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:05,305
Boss, I am making money!

1100
01:20:05,414 --> 01:20:07,405
You will lose, shit-head!

1101
01:20:08,584 --> 01:20:10,074
Have you seen this girl?

1102
01:20:11,053 --> 01:20:12,350
This girl?

1103
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:16,153
Why are there so many people
looking for her?

1104
01:20:16,258 --> 01:20:17,657
Who else?

1105
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:19,823
A lesbian is looking for her,

1106
01:20:19,928 --> 01:20:21,225
she pays much!

1107
01:20:21,396 --> 01:20:22,988
How can we find her?

1108
01:20:23,132 --> 01:20:24,929
I know she always goes to gymnasium.

1109
01:20:30,772 --> 01:20:31,966
Useless!

1110
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:33,738
Man, go and eat shit!

1111
01:20:33,775 --> 01:20:36,573
Yes, I eat shit...

1112
01:20:40,349 --> 01:20:41,338
What's the matter?

1113
01:20:41,416 --> 01:20:42,610
Somebody wants to see Princess.

1114
01:20:43,252 --> 01:20:44,549
Baby, check who wants to see me.

1115
01:20:47,856 --> 01:20:48,754
Who is it?

1116
01:20:48,857 --> 01:20:50,449
Kitty wants to see Princess.

1117
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:52,056
Bring her up.

1118
01:20:52,094 --> 01:20:53,584
Yes, Princess.

1119
01:21:07,976 --> 01:21:09,375
You are coming eventually!

1120
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:10,705
Find me?

1121
01:21:11,313 --> 01:21:12,905
Stop pretending!

1122
01:21:12,981 --> 01:21:14,881
Don't you think you can escape from me?

1123
01:21:19,388 --> 01:21:21,185
Don't you want me?

1124
01:21:23,825 --> 01:21:28,057
Look, you are dressing like a hooker.

1125
01:21:29,231 --> 01:21:30,528
Poor taste!

1126
01:21:43,478 --> 01:21:44,672
Don't you like it?

1127
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:54,822
I love it!
I love the way you look bitchy!

1128
01:21:56,491 --> 01:21:57,480
Princess...

1129
01:22:03,332 --> 01:22:06,529
Be obedient!

1130
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:10,134
Otherwise, I will dig your eyeballs out.

1131
01:22:20,816 --> 01:22:22,010
Wait me downstairs.

1132
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:23,449
I will wait for you.

1133
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:30,447
This is for you.

1134
01:22:34,663 --> 01:22:36,358
How do you know I will come today.

1135
01:22:36,832 --> 01:22:40,427
I ask them to buy a bunch of
fresh flowers in every 12 hours.

1136
01:22:41,136 --> 01:22:43,934
I know you will come sooner or later.

1137
01:22:58,754 --> 01:22:59,846
Love it or not?

1138
01:23:01,623 --> 01:23:05,024
It's pretty! It costs much!

1139
01:23:06,795 --> 01:23:10,287
So many people in this world,
and there is so much money too.

1140
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,400
Money's no big deal!

1141
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:18,169
If anything looks pretty in your body,

1142
01:23:18,807 --> 01:23:21,298
I will buy it to you by all means.

1143
01:23:23,345 --> 01:23:25,836
I just come to be your partner.

1144
01:23:25,981 --> 01:23:29,974
I haven't promised anything, and...

1145
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:32,819
What?

1146
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:37,119
You have a close girlfriend.

1147
01:23:37,926 --> 01:23:39,223
How can she compete with you.

1148
01:24:12,494 --> 01:24:14,485
Don't you afraid
I am coming to kill you?

1149
01:24:16,832 --> 01:24:18,231
I have searched you!

1150
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,798
Besides the lip-stick, nothing else.

1151
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:32,331
Don't move, who are you looking for?

1152
01:25:36,378 --> 01:25:37,367
Go now!

1153
01:25:43,752 --> 01:25:44,946
Let her go!

1154
01:25:48,557 --> 01:25:50,149
Do you need to throw up
when holding the gun?

1155
01:25:55,096 --> 01:25:56,495
Are you feeling painful?

1156
01:26:00,135 --> 01:26:01,432
Don't push me to shoot!

1157
01:26:01,503 --> 01:26:05,303
Come on, throw up!
You will feel comfortable!

1158
01:26:09,744 --> 01:26:10,642
Tinam!

1159
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:13,278
Baby!

1160
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,412
Follow me.

1161
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:48,815
Princess can find us no matter
where we are going.

1162
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:49,848
What'll we do then?

1163
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:50,907
Back to Sister Cindy's home.

1164
01:26:53,655 --> 01:26:54,553
OK!

1165
01:27:13,742 --> 01:27:16,734
Tinam, we have no chance,
you'd better leave me.

1166
01:27:17,078 --> 01:27:19,672
I tried so hard to find you,
I won't give up.

1167
01:27:19,814 --> 01:27:21,304
Let's die together.

1168
01:27:21,449 --> 01:27:23,246
Princess will come soon,
wait me here.

1169
01:27:23,351 --> 01:27:24,340
Be careful!

1170
01:28:48,737 --> 01:28:50,534
Have you ever dreamt
the ring was a bomb?

1171
01:28:51,573 --> 01:28:55,065
You are too junior!

1172
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:57,310
You should learn more from me of
how to be cruel and cunning!

1173
01:28:58,513 --> 01:29:02,711
I remember! You are like Sister Cindy.

1174
01:29:03,385 --> 01:29:06,183
You want to die in the same place
as she did.

1175
01:29:06,888 --> 01:29:09,880
But, I won't let you die...

1176
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:12,883
before I making love with you!

1177
01:29:23,605 --> 01:29:27,701
Isn't it delicious?
It is learnt from you.

1178
01:29:28,877 --> 01:29:32,574
My lip-stick is poisoned!

1179
01:29:36,051 --> 01:29:38,645
Can't you guess it? Let me tell you!

1180
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:42,117
I am poisoned too, but I can stand it!

1181
01:29:42,524 --> 01:29:45,118
Because my stomach is filled with milk.

1182
01:29:45,226 --> 01:29:47,717
It will take 3 hours for the poison
to enter my blood.

1183
01:29:48,029 --> 01:29:49,724
But you are poisoned at once!

1184
01:29:49,998 --> 01:29:51,898
I still have time
to take gastric lavage.

1185
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,591
But you, will die soon!

1186
01:30:01,543 --> 01:30:03,943
Kitty!

1187
01:30:04,379 --> 01:30:05,778
Let me send you to the hospital!

1188
01:30:06,381 --> 01:30:08,076
I am handicapped and poisoned,

1189
01:30:08,616 --> 01:30:11,915
don't waste any effort to save me.

1190
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:16,690
Kitty, surrender yourself!

1191
01:30:17,759 --> 01:30:20,057
You want a cripple go to jail?

1192
01:30:24,933 --> 01:30:27,424
Listen, you are all surrounded.

1193
01:30:27,502 --> 01:30:28,400
Surrender now!

1194
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:29,764
Sir, Tinam is inside.

1195
01:30:31,206 --> 01:30:32,798
Here is filled with gas,

1196
01:30:33,675 --> 01:30:35,973
once they shoot, it will explode.

1197
01:30:36,111 --> 01:30:37,408
Leave as quick as you can.

1198
01:30:39,748 --> 01:30:41,340
It's hard for me to find you,

1199
01:30:41,883 --> 01:30:44,477
I'd never let you leave me.
