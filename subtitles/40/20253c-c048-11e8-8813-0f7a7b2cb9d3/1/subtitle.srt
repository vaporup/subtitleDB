1
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,636
With spring,

2
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,638
Flowers,

3
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,640
Colors,

4
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,633
Questions arise

5
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,649
Peaceful

6
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,651
$20, next?

7
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,652
Life

8
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,655
Peaceful, $20

9
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,657
Next?

10
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,658
Marriage

11
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,661
Marriage, the real question

12
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,662
Not so loud

13
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,664
Everyone can hear

14
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,665
You have

15
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,667
A classic rich look

16
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,669
Girls need love

17
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,670
Don't be shy

18
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,663
Your hand

19
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,677
Parents are apart

20
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,679
You only have Mother

21
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,681
It's right or it's free

22
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,682
No, only Father

23
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,684
Mom died

24
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,687
So I'm right: single parent

25
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,688
And 2 sisters

26
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,690
It's right or it's free

27
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,693
No, only child

28
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,697
So I'm right, no boys

29
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,698
Forget it

30
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,700
No, I'm getting to the

31
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,703
Good part

32
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,706
A forked love line

33
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,708
Excuse me?

34
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,710
It means you'll

35
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,712
Marry a rich man

36
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
You're joking

37
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,714
Me, marry rich?

38
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,716
Why not?

39
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,719
If I say you will

40
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,722
You will marry rich

41
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,725
I hope so; how much?

42
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,728
Up to you, $200 or more

43
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,732
$200 for that?

44
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,734
Here's $60

45
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,738
$61 total

46
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,741
Wait

47
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,742
Free advice:

48
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,744
You're too thin

49
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,747
Exercise more

50
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,748
Exercise?

51
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,752
With my job?

52
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,755
Yes, I deliver propane

53
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,756
But I'm the Boss's daughter

54
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,749
So it's part-time

55
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,764
I grew up in Harmony Village

56
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,766
It's old

57
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,768
And so are its people

58
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,761
But to me it's the best

59
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,775
Our Head of Security

60
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,778
Told me he killed a lion with

61
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,780
His bare hands

62
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
But I didn't know

63
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,784
There were lions in Hong Kong

64
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,787
Our Head of Agriculture

65
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,789
Has the best fruit

66
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,782
But bad hygiene

67
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,797
Our Head of Culture

68
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,800
Only reads English books

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,803
But only the pictures

70
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,805
His daughter MT, my best friend

71
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,808
She reads the papers

72
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,810
And magazines she sells

73
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,812
So she knows it all

74
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,813
Except whether

75
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,816
She prefers men or women

76
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,819
It's a mystery to all of us

77
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,821
Dad is Head of Energy

78
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,823
They call him Uncle D

79
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,825
Hobbies: Popsicles and comics

80
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,818
Everyone respects him

81
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,827
Dad, I quit

82
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,843
I'm your bookkeeper

83
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,844
All right

84
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,848
Modem youth are so spoiled

85
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,851
They give up too easily

86
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,853
It's too heavy

87
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,855
You expect this

88
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,857
On my salary?

89
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,859
All right

90
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,862
You cost more than my maid

91
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,865
And she works all day

92
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,868
But I'm a girl

93
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,869
This work

94
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,871
Scares off the boys

95
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,872
I'll never marry

96
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,876
You are my daughter

97
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,879
In olden days, a princess

98
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,883
You must marry a celebrity

99
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,887
I refuse to make deliveries

100
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,880
I'll do it myself

101
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,904
Stop acting

102
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,897
Last time it was the other hand

103
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,902
Both of my hands are trembling

104
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,920
Where is Monam now?

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
Level 73

106
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,924
Great!

107
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,925
Will he continue?

108
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,927
Yes

109
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,930
Surely he'll go for Level 74

110
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,933
And when he succeeds

111
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,934
Of course he'll try Level 75

112
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,927
Of course he'll try Level 75

113
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,945
I must wear a glove

114
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,938
On my left hand, too

115
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,955
Marry rich?

116
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,948
No

117
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,953
It would be nice

118
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,988
Fry 10 more eggs, we need more food

119
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,991
Uncle D!

120
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
Very punctual

121
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,994
All alone?

122
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,995
I couldn't sell these

123
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,997
It's my gift to you

124
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,998
Thanks

125
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,000
Stay for dinner

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,003
I'll go now

127
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:28,007
Stop acting

128
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,009
You came when you smelled food

129
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,011
I couldn't sell these

130
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,013
It's my gift to you

131
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,016
What do I do with them?

132
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,019
And you brought...?

133
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,020
Uncle D...

134
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,022
Bring it out

135
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,024
Then I will

136
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
Come out!

137
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
Uncle D!

138
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,029
So many?

139
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,031
Fine

140
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,034
Sit

141
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,035
Good girl

142
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,037
Eat

143
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,039
Eat

144
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,040
Here

145
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,043
Mi!

146
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,045
Great fried eggs

147
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,047
She cooks well

148
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,049
Open another can of fish

149
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,051
I'm glad you came

150
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,053
Together

151
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,056
How great to have a good daughter

152
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,059
He has MT

153
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,061
But is it a boy or a girl?

154
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,062
Whoever marries Mi

155
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,064
Is so lucky

156
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,067
Don't even think about it

157
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,069
Uncle D's daughter

158
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,071
Must marry a rich man

159
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,074
The richest!

160
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,076
Rich men may not be good

161
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,079
That's true

162
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,081
But poor men are no good at all

163
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,084
Uncle D is so wise

164
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,085
Sure

165
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,088
So how is the land deal?

166
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,091
It's almost done

167
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,093
No one wants to buy

168
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,096
Relax

169
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:01,089
Uncle D is king!

170
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,108
They were really hungry!

171
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,111
They came for free dinner again?

172
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,114
You look like a prisoner

173
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,115
I want dessert

174
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,119
Prisoner?

175
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,120
- So!
- What?

176
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,122
A fortune-teller

177
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,125
Said I'll marry a rich man

178
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,127
You're going crazy

179
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,129
Thinking of marriage

180
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,130
I want to marry

181
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,132
I over 20

182
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,133
It would be nice

183
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,135
Let him take

184
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,136
Care of me

185
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,139
Since you'll be marrying a rich man

186
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,142
Focus on that

187
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,144
Where would I

188
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,146
Find one?

189
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,148
I don't know

190
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,150
What is a rich man?

191
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,151
A millionaire?

192
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,154
How is that different from a rich man?

193
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,155
And...

194
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,156
What?

195
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,158
Don't touch me!

196
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,160
Tell me you don't like it

197
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,161
Or how would I know?

198
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,162
Just say so

199
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,164
I don't like it!

200
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,166
Try this

201
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,167
Disgusting!

202
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,168
I'll try

203
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,161
This way

204
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,218
Rich Man!

205
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,236
Is this 2 Shek O Road?

206
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,237
Where is the kitchen?

207
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,239
It's not for the kitchen

208
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,242
It's for the garden barbecue

209
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,244
Hurry, they're waiting

210
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
I'm busy, don't bother me

211
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,248
No time

212
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,251
I'm not so ugly

213
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:36,255
The rich are so rude

214
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:40,248
Is this a church?

215
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,262
No wonder people want to marry rich

216
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,267
Mi!

217
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,285
Cici Chan?

218
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,286
Yes, how are you?

219
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,288
It's been so long

220
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,290
Fine, and you?

221
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,291
Okay

222
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,295
You're delivering pr

223
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,297
Family business

224
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,299
Come, see who's here

225
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,301
Mi brought the propane!

226
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,302
Come see!

227
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,304
Mi?

228
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,307
Hurry!

229
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,310
Mi!

230
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,311
Teresa?

231
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,312
Loomi?

232
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,313
I've changed my name

233
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,316
I'm Sonreysia now

234
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,318
Son...

235
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,320
Why are you here?

236
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,323
Cici's wedding is in 2 days

237
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,325
We're having a party for her

238
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,328
This is her husband's home

239
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,331
Mi...

240
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,334
Remember when we were kids

241
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,336
We sat together in school

242
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,340
You were the smartest

243
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,342
And I, the dumbest

244
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,344
Cici, what is 1+1?

245
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,345
Mi?

246
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,346
2!

247
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,348
Name some famous people

248
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,351
Einstein, Beethoven, Sun Yat Sen,
Picasso...

249
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,352
And Cici?

250
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,353
Wilson

251
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,354
Who?

252
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,355
We are the same age

253
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,357
He has short hair, wears glasses

254
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,359
Best of all, he's a banker's son

255
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,361
I will marry him

256
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,364
I wasn't stupid

257
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,367
I knew my priorities

258
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:32,371
Marrying rich is a must

259
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,373
You're marrying Wilson?

260
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,375
I'm not so lucky

261
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,377
You're doing well

262
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,381
She's marrying the son of a famous lawyer

263
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,382
And you

264
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,386
She married the 2nd richest doctor

265
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,389
Dr. Chan, the heart specialist

266
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,390
Of course

267
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,383
Sunreysia married the grandson of the Kwoks

268
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,399
I'm heir to the family propane empire

269
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,400
So, Mi

270
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,404
Are you married yet?

271
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,405
It's late

272
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,407
I must go

273
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,408
Stay

274
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,409
Talk to us

275
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,410
I must go

276
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,412
I'm too ashamed

277
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,414
Mi

278
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,417
Everyone said you were smarter

279
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,420
Don't you feel I'm smarter now?

280
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,423
That's smart?

281
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,416
Of course

282
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,430
I must go

283
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,432
Bye, then

284
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,434
She delivered the propane

285
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,437
And I forgot the tip

286
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,438
No need

287
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,439
I must

288
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,442
It's hard labor

289
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,444
Thanks

290
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,447
We'll visit you soon

291
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,440
It's killing me!

292
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,463
I'm so unlucky

293
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,467
What's so great about marrying rich?

294
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,470
I've been told I will

295
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,472
I won't marry anyone

296
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,465
But the richest man!

297
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,483
I will marry a rich man!

298
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,486
I will marry a rich man!

299
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,479
I will marry a rich man!

300
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,485
I will marry a rich man!

301
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,503
I will marry a rich man!

302
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,520
I will marry a rich man!

303
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,522
Sir, Satellite 2 must shift

304
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,524
Mr. Law booked it for a teleconference

305
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,527
Tell him to delay the meeting

306
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,529
She's interesting

307
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,533
But he booked this slot

308
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,537
We'll make less money, I don't care

309
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,541
This makes me happy

310
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,545
I will marry a rich man!

311
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,538
Lock Satellite 2 to the target

312
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,544
"Marry A Rich Man" ready?

313
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,549
Yes

314
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,564
I will marry a rich man!

315
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,580
What's the use?

316
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,573
Can't wish without a shooting star

317
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,589
I can't be that lucky

318
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,582
Make a wish

319
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,629
"The Glass Slipper"?

320
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,656
Welcome to "The Glass Slipper"

321
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,659
This story appeals to all

322
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,663
Because of the exciting villains

323
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,665
And the star, Cinderella

324
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,658
Marries a rich prince

325
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,665
Oh, come here, please

326
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,685
If the evil stepmother

327
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,689
Or stepsisters married well

328
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,691
We may feel cheated

329
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,693
But for kind Cinderella

330
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,695
Not only is it fine

331
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,697
That she marries a rich tale

332
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,700
It's a beautiful fairy tale

333
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,703
Not only is it okay to marry rich

334
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,705
If you are kind

335
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,709
It is an enterprising idea

336
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,713
Glass slippers don't pinch

337
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,714
What a good book

338
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,716
What a good book

339
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,719
I've never seen anything like it

340
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,721
It tells the truth simply

341
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,723
Every point hits the spot

342
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,724
It's great

343
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,727
I'm getting excited

344
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,728
It says

345
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,731
Marrying a rich man is like a job

346
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,734
It takes effort, resources, and money

347
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,736
That's the same as a CEO

348
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,738
Right

349
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,740
If you're fated to marry rich

350
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,743
Where is he?

351
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,744
Help me find him

352
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,747
I don't know what sex I want

353
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,749
I can't help

354
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,750
But I'll sponsor you

355
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,751
With all my savings

356
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,754
No need, thanks

357
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,756
Stop it

358
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,759
It's my investment on you

359
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,762
When you do marry a rich man

360
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,764
Repay me, with interest

361
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,765
And if I fail?

362
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,758
Pay with your flesh

363
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,763
Relax, Hong Kong girl

364
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,778
All right

365
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,781
Relax

366
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,774
- Like this?
- Right

367
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,790
Don't fear crudeness

368
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,792
It's the same old moves

369
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,794
First, a smile

370
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,796
Don't worry about beauty

371
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,797
A beautiful smile

372
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,790
Is all you need

373
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,806
Let's practice

374
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,809
This is most elegant

375
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,802
Most kind

376
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,807
Most innocent

377
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,823
Most sexy

378
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,826
How's this?

379
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,829
Most toad-like

380
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,833
Grooming and self-confidence

381
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,837
Go to the most expensive shops

382
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,839
Don't worry about money

383
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,842
Be gracious

384
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,844
There's nothing they can do

385
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,847
May I help you?

386
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,848
I want to try this

387
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,852
Establish self-confidence

388
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,854
Pose outside the fitting room

389
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,857
As flamboyantly as possible

390
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,859
Keep going

391
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,861
Until you feel beautiful

392
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,863
Confidence rules in fashion

393
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,856
Let your clothes know who's boss

394
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,886
I don't like them

395
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,888
Buy something

396
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,892
Don't make it hard on the sales staff

397
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,894
Actually, there is something

398
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,898
Yes

399
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,901
Here

400
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,903
$12, right?

401
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,906
Next, practical experience

402
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,908
Go where the rich gather

403
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,911
Some private hospitals

404
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,913
Are good choices

405
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,916
Dress sexier

406
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,918
Little girl

407
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,920
What's your name?

408
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,922
I'm HG

409
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,925
For Horny Goat!

410
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,927
I'm rich

411
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,930
And dying

412
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,923
When? It's up to you

413
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,936
Interested?

414
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,929
Let's do it here

415
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,942
Marry me!

416
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,945
We'll go to my villa in A-nus

417
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,948
We'll enter A-nus in the morning

418
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,951
Have fun in A-nus

419
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,955
And come out from the back at night

420
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,958
Come with me

421
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,960
Marry me

422
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,963
In 3 months

423
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,965
We'll trap my stepmother

424
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,968
And put my brother in prison

425
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,971
Then we'll split the fortune

426
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,974
I'll run for president

427
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,977
Then rule the world!

428
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,979
You think you're Ultraman?

429
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,982
Even if I were

430
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,975
I'd be Ultraman in furs!

431
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,991
Where did she go?

432
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,993
Crazy!

433
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,996
I'm too busy for a press conference

434
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,999
I'll go back to the office

435
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,992
I hate cameras in my face

436
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,007
Welcome, friends of the press

437
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,009
Today, I...

438
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,011
Are you all right?

439
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,013
I'll help you up

440
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,014
No need

441
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,015
Were you molested? I'll call the police

442
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,016
Leave me alone

443
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,017
I'll call the police

444
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,018
- Leave me alone
- I'll call the police

445
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:24,011
Stop it with the police!

446
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,027
Relax! Relax!

447
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,029
Wait outside

448
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,032
You think I'm a thief?

449
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,034
Sorry, Miss

450
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,036
Wilson?

451
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,037
You know me?

452
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,038
You're so famous

453
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,041
All my classmates want to marry you

454
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,042
Really?

455
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:48,035
Yes

456
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,049
Will you give me the film?

457
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,052
Which paper are you with?

458
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,054
Do I look like the paparazzi?

459
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,056
I am a CEO!

460
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,059
Mimi Cheng... propane?

461
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,060
Hello!

462
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,061
I'm Wilson, a pleasure

463
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,063
What happened just now

464
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,066
Can it remain between us?

465
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,067
Please?

466
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,069
No need to look all pale

467
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,070
I'm pale?

468
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,071
- Very
- Really?

469
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,073
Fix your makeup for your meeting

470
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,075
This part is grey

471
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,077
Okay

472
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,078
Oh, no!

473
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,079
I don't have powder

474
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,082
I wonder who does?

475
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,083
I have a compact

476
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,084
Yes

477
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,086
I don't know how to apply makeup

478
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,089
I wonder who does?

479
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:35,093
Let me help you

480
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,094
Just a bit

481
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,096
Thick brows make you

482
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,098
Look heroic

483
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:44,091
Blot off the oil

484
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:49,096
Go on

485
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,111
We're done!

486
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,112
So soon?

487
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:58,116
TV lighting is harsh

488
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,119
I look fat on screen

489
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,121
- A slimmer look?
- Yes

490
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,124
Deeper shadows here

491
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,126
Straighten your nose?

492
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:12,119
- Straighter
- Yes

493
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,146
What's taking Boss so long?

494
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,147
Lip balm?

495
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:33,151
Sure

496
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,154
Thanks

497
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,156
Smooth as fresh tofu

498
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:42,160
I want to lick it

499
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,161
Am I okay?

500
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,163
For camera, yes!

501
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,164
Really?

502
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,165
Thank you

503
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,166
Any time

504
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,167
The lip balm?

505
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,169
Keep it

506
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,172
- Thanks
- Bye

507
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,173
Mimi?

508
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,175
Just "Mi"

509
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,178
Mi, may we discuss

510
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,180
Propane digitalization?

511
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,183
I don't understand that stuff

512
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,186
It's very commercial

513
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,187
Mi...

514
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,190
Or may we discuss other topics

515
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,191
Like

516
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,194
Propane-lip balm-digitalization?

517
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,195
3 in 1

518
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,197
Call me, bye

519
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:23,190
Bye

520
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,205
This Wilson?

521
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,206
Yes

522
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,208
Really?

523
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,210
- You don't believe me
- No

524
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,213
He gave me his number

525
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,215
It's going through!

526
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:41,208
This is a Planned Parenthood

527
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,222
Survey, what safety

528
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:48,215
Precautions do you take during sex?

529
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,229
All right, thanks

530
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,231
It's him!

531
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,233
No sparks, though

532
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,235
You're joking!

533
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,238
All this work to find a rich man

534
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,241
You found Wilson, but "no sparks"?

535
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,244
No, we don't have that...

536
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,245
Magic

537
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,246
Magic?

538
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,249
The goal is a rich man

539
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,250
What magic?

540
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,253
What's wrong with you?

541
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,255
It's that

542
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,256
Feeling you get

543
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,259
When you spin and lose

544
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,261
Balance and direction

545
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,263
Understand?

546
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,266
Drink tequila

547
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,267
Touch an electrical outlet

548
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,269
It's the same feeling

549
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,271
Don't set a bad example

550
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,272
Okay, sorry

551
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,274
Deep truths simply

552
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,275
Let's use the deepest one

553
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,277
I may meet someone

554
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,279
I like, who is rich and handsome

555
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,280
How deep?

556
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,283
The book says, many qualified ones

557
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,286
Are in first-class cabins on planes

558
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,288
Plus after a long flight

559
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,292
Boredom breeds romance

560
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,294
Where do you want to fly to?

561
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,296
Somewhere

562
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,297
Romantic, artistic

563
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,299
With lots of cute guys

564
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,301
And that is

565
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:07,305
Milan!

566
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:11,309
First Class is this way

567
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,302
Coach is over there

568
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,317
Would you like a drink?

569
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,320
No. Thank you

570
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,313
Sir, this is your seat

571
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,322
Incredible!

572
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,375
Will you marry me?

573
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,395
Are you all right?

574
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,388
Fine

575
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,415
You're the one

576
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,417
- Hi!
- Hi!

577
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,418
- Hi!
- Hi!

578
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,419
- Hi!
- Hi!

579
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,422
Damn you! Stop that!

580
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,424
Where is your seat?

581
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,425
Here

582
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,427
This is my wife's seat

583
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,429
She's been standing one minute!

584
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,431
Let's see your ticket!

585
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,433
It's up front

586
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,436
Look before you sit! Get up!

587
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,438
She's still standing

588
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,440
Must she wait?

589
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,443
Ridiculous!

590
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,436
Sitting by me!

591
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,452
Wrong seat again?

592
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,445
No, it's right

593
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,460
How rude

594
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,463
Yes, boors are everywhere

595
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:49,467
You alone?

596
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,469
Going to Milan?

597
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,470
You, too?

598
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,473
Yes

599
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,476
Something to drink?

600
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,479
Would you like a drink?

601
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,482
A drink.

602
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,484
Iced Ovaltine, please

603
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,486
We don't have that

604
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,489
A Grape Fruit Juice

605
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,491
It's canned, how about

606
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,493
Some freshornjuice?

607
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,496
Oh, my God!

608
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,498
This is ridiculous!

609
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,500
I can't stand it!

610
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,502
It's "fresh orange juice"

611
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,503
Not much difference

612
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,504
It's a huge difference

613
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,507
What horrible service

614
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,510
It hurts my ears!

615
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,513
For example, say

616
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,514
Beef jerky

617
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,515
Beefjerky

618
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,516
No...

619
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,518
Can't make jerky with bees

620
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,520
It's "beef...

621
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,524
...Sherky

622
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,526
For example, again

623
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,527
Dried Mangoes

624
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,530
Dy...

625
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,523
I'll get your drink

626
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,539
Sorry, was I too insistent?

627
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,540
But I...

628
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,541
No, I don't like

629
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,543
Slurred words, either

630
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:09,536
Your accent is interesting

631
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,549
I'm from Hubei

632
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,553
But educated at Oxford

633
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,556
So my accent is... different

634
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,558
And you?

635
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,561
Stanford

636
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,562
- Really?
- Yes

637
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,565
Oxford, Stanford, both "ford"s!

638
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,567
What coincidence!

639
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,569
I'm Chris

640
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,572
Christopher?

641
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,573
No

642
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,575
It's Christmas

643
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,579
I want every day to be happy
as Christmas

644
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,580
So I changed my name

645
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,583
Or you can call me Mas

646
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,585
Not Mars, Mas

647
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,586
Mi

648
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,588
Hello

649
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,581
What a sweet smile

650
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,595
Excuse me, Mi

651
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,588
I want to go the toilet.

652
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,605
Bingo!

653
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,598
Rich and cute

654
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,615
And sleeping together already

655
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,617
What?

656
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,620
I said, why are you going to Milan?

657
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,622
On business?

658
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:28,626
I don't have to work for a living

659
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:32,630
I enjoy my life

660
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,633
I travel all over to visit churches

661
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:39,637
Europe's 3rd biggest church is in Milan

662
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,639
Called Duomo

663
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,641
You know it, I'm sure

664
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,643
Yes, the Duomo

665
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,636
Why do you visit churches?

666
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,665
It's beautiful!

667
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,666
Mi!

668
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,659
Why do you visit churches?

669
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,677
Because I want to choose

670
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,679
The perfect one for

671
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,681
My wedding

672
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,683
You're engaged?

673
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,684
No

674
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,685
Girlfriend?

675
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,686
No

676
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,687
How strange

677
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,690
Don't men fear marriage?

678
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,692
I can't wait

679
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,694
But I want it to be

680
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,696
Alaise and forever

681
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,698
That's "always"

682
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,700
Always!

683
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,702
I want to go shopping

684
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,703
Good idea

685
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,707
Then a great meal

686
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,709
Where's my wallet?

687
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,710
Stolen

688
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,714
Can't be!

689
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,715
Mine's gone, too

690
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,717
That man bumped into us

691
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,719
Should we report this?

692
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,721
Yes, let's call Hong Kong

693
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,723
My assistant will handle it

694
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,726
Let's go

695
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,728
Hi, Dad?

696
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,731
Yes, I'm in Italy

697
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,734
It's beautiful but cold

698
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,736
This is a collect call

699
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:22,740
So talk for at least 3 minutes

700
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,741
All right

701
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,743
Before I left

702
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,736
I put some veggies in the fridge

703
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,754
CEO? Yes, those stocks...

704
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,756
Hold 2 lots, sell 2 lots

705
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,758
What?

706
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,761
What do you talking about?

707
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,764
Keep the cash flow at

708
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,767
At $246 million

709
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,769
Are you all right?

710
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,772
You were talking about veggies

711
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,774
Right!

712
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,776
Fire them all, tomorrow

713
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,777
Just do as I say

714
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,780
That's all, then

715
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,781
Done

716
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,783
Should we get replacement cards?

717
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,785
What's the rush?

718
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,787
Let's play a game

719
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,788
What game?

720
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,792
A penniless life

721
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,794
That's not fun

722
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,797
We're both rich

723
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,801
We've been here many times

724
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,802
Yes, but...

725
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,805
And everywhere nearby

726
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,806
Yes

727
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,799
So

728
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,813
All right

729
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,814
If I hadn't met you on the plane

730
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,816
I wouldn't have known where to go

731
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,817
Let's play

732
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,810
Let's go

733
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,880
Stand there

734
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,883
Gorgeous!

735
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,885
Let me see

736
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,888
Here

737
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,881
A kaleidoscope!

738
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,895
Use this

739
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,897
This?

740
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,900
Too bad our wallets are gone

741
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,893
Never mind

742
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,910
This is the fam ous

743
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,911
Panino

744
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,914
With ham, cheese, lettuce...

745
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:17,915
Delicious!

746
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,916
You sound like a documentary

747
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,917
Of course

748
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,918
I'm hungry

749
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,920
Let's get the replacement card

750
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,921
No

751
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,924
We're having so much fun!

752
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,927
But I'll starve

753
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,928
In an alien land

754
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,929
You won't

755
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,922
Look!

756
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,937
Don't tell me

757
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,939
You're using that old movie device

758
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,942
You play guitar?

759
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,944
So crude?

760
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,937
Watch me!

761
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,960
How crude!

762
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,962
Let's go to have a coffee

763
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:05,963
Over there? Okay

764
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:06,964
I'll be here, okay?

765
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,966
Okay

766
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,967
Mi

767
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,970
I'll play, you dance

768
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,972
We'll make a fortune

769
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,974
You go ahead

770
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,975
Me?

771
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:18,976
No one wants to watch me

772
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:19,977
You do it

773
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:20,978
I can't

774
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,980
Flamenco is easy

775
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,982
Like this

776
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:25,983
Try it

777
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,976
1, 2, 3, 4!

778
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,981
Like this?

779
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,004
Be serious

780
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,005
No one is paying

781
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,007
I said I can't dance

782
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,009
Try again

783
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:56,002
1, 2, 3, 4!

784
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,016
Someone paid?

785
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,018
Forget it

786
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,020
You must be desperate

787
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,022
I'll help a fellow Chinese

788
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,023
Thank you

789
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,026
That's not enough for a panino

790
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:13,030
Miss Designer Clothes wants a panino?

791
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,031
Sorry

792
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,032
Quiet

793
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,033
It's not enough for 2

794
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,035
You're worse!

795
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,037
This is all I have

796
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,038
Thank you

797
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:25,031
We'll take it

798
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:40,057
Food!

799
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,059
Well?

800
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,062
Great!

801
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,065
We had enough for 2

802
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,067
Where's yours?

803
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,069
For you!

804
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,072
You bought a gift instead?

805
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,073
I never said I like it

806
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,075
I like it

807
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,078
I want to give you what I like

808
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:05,071
How cute of you

809
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:10,087
It's a happier world through this

810
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:14,080
Even I look better

811
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:19,096
Handsome!

812
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,098
Aren't you hungry?

813
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,101
I'm full from watching you

814
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,102
Here

815
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,103
Thanks

816
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,095
Thanks

817
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,262
You okay?

818
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,263
Fine

819
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,265
Let's sit on the bench

820
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,267
Okay

821
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,269
I'll massage you

822
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:16,273
Thanks

823
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,275
I've observed that

824
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,278
Your spine is maligned

825
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,280
With the lifting I do

826
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,282
What?

827
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:29,286
Weights, at the gym

828
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,288
Right here!

829
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,289
Hard enough?

830
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,290
Harder

831
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,291
Okay!

832
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,294
Use your elbow

833
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:41,287
You're tough

834
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,310
Cry out if you like

835
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,303
It excites me

836
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,328
It feels great!

837
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,330
Do my head, too

838
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,333
Sure

839
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,335
Relax

840
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,337
Clear you mind

841
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,339
I wish I could

842
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,340
Do me a favor

843
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,342
Think for me from now on

844
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,345
I must think about that

845
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,347
I don't want to be casual

846
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,349
It's fine, we're not that close

847
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,351
Then...

848
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,352
Okay!

849
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:39,345
I'll think for you

850
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,359
I feel so loved

851
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,361
Like a princess

852
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,362
If so, am I your...

853
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:49,366
Imperial Eunuch?

854
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:53,359
What do you think?

855
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,374
Do you like this?

856
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:01,367
It's great!

857
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,397
Good morning

858
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:24,390
Good morning

859
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,398
Let's go

860
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,416
What's wrong?

861
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,420
My legs are asleep

862
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,422
Let's go

863
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,425
I'll pound them for you

864
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,426
Better?

865
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,428
Great

866
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,429
I'll help you

867
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,430
Okay

868
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,431
Let's go

869
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,432
Slow down

870
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,425
Okay

871
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:15,441
It's beautiful!

872
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,458
Glass slippers are impractical

873
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,460
You can't use or eat them

874
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,463
But everyone wants them

875
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,465
Just like love

876
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,467
You feel that way, too?

877
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:34,471
You like them? They're yours

878
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,475
They're very expensive

879
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,478
How beautiful they will be

880
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:45,482
On you at your wedding

881
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:49,486
The most important part of a wedding

882
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:53,479
Is who stands next to you

883
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,493
You are disgusting

884
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,486
Yes, I am

885
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,515
No kissing allowed?

886
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,517
So conservative?

887
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,510
What's up?

888
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:30,516
Sorry...

889
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,531
Me... mine...

890
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,532
Thank you!

891
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,534
Thank you!

892
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,537
Is anything missing?

893
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,539
No

894
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,540
You?

895
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,542
No

896
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,543
Let's celebrate

897
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,544
My treat

898
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,545
No, mine

899
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,546
No, mine

900
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,547
Let's go

901
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,540
- Yes
- My treat

902
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,584
I'm so full!

903
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,586
It was great!

904
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:33,590
Now we need a place to sleep

905
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:37,583
Let's go

906
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,601
Hundred, thousand...

907
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,603
The bill is over 20 million

908
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,606
That's over HK$70,000

909
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,608
You can't get that in Hong Kong

910
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,601
Of course

911
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,632
What?

912
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,635
I only have small change

913
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,636
The rest must be stolen

914
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,629
Mi, can you?

915
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,642
I don't have the cash

916
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,644
Use your credit card

917
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,637
I just reported the loss

918
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,661
I need to talk

919
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,664
Yes?

920
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,667
I'm not rich

921
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,669
I read this book

922
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:56,662
On how to catch a rich man

923
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,678
You may be angry

924
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,681
But no matter what

925
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:08,674
I really like you

926
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,690
It's okay

927
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:17,694
I'm glad you're so honest

928
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,695
I like you, too

929
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:22,688
And hope to be with you

930
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,703
But I don't understand

931
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,707
Why I have the same book?

932
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,710
The men's version?

933
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,712
What do you do?

934
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,715
I'm a mechanic

935
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:42,708
I deliver propane

936
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,738
At this point

937
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:05,742
We must resolve this bill

938
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,746
I promised I would think for you

939
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,747
Wait here

940
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,750
No matter how

941
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,753
I'll be back with the money

942
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,755
You won't abandon me?

943
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,758
Leave the thinking to me

944
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,760
Okay

945
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,762
Come back soon

946
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,755
Wait here

947
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,800
He won't be back

948
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,793
Telephone?

949
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,820
Hello, credit card center?

950
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,822
I need your help

951
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,824
Sorry, Miss

952
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,826
You're over your limit

953
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,829
But I'm alone in Italy

954
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,831
Can't you help?

955
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,833
But our company policy...

956
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,835
In your ads you say

957
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,838
You'd help in accidents abroad

958
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,839
In accidents

959
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,841
We will, but

960
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,844
Our ads say

961
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,846
Accidents are skiing mishaps,

962
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,848
Emergency illness,

963
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,849
Lost luggage, but not

964
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,852
Inability to pay a restaurant bill

965
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:56,853
And such a high one

966
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,857
You don't know what happened!

967
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,860
I met a man I liked on a plane

968
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,864
We're happy together

969
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,867
I thought he was rich

970
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,869
But he isn't

971
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,871
But it doesn't matter

972
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,874
I lied to him, too

973
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,867
Just as I felt like a princess, he left

974
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,881
I'm deeply sorry about that

975
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,884
But our company policy...

976
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:31,877
I'll loan it to you personally

977
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,891
Thank you

978
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,884
Pay me back at 2% over prime

979
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,891
Make sure you do!

980
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,899
It's quite fair.

981
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:59,905
He brings me joy

982
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,921
He makes me cry

983
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,914
Love's live a fairy tale

984
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,923
Moves me and fills me

985
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,944
I'd die for love

986
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,946
Give it all I have

987
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:32,949
I'll play my part

988
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,951
Reality's sad

989
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,953
The poor princess

990
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:40,946
Deluded by the glass slippers

991
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,951
She never meets the prince

992
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,956
The slippers don't exist

993
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,971
Love's an illusion

994
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,975
For fairy tale chasers

995
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:02,979
Fresh orange juice?

996
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,972
I've just been shorn

997
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,021
I had to run!

998
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,024
How cruel!

999
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,027
We were poor and poorer

1000
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,028
What else could I do?

1001
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,030
True

1002
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,032
We put our money together

1003
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,034
To help you find a rich woman

1004
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,037
But you found her instead

1005
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,040
Good thing you left in time

1006
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,042
You must not have used

1007
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,043
The English I taught you

1008
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:11,047
I did, almost choked to death

1009
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,049
Forget it

1010
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,051
Such bad luck

1011
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,053
Mas

1012
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,056
You're desirable

1013
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,058
Why go abroad?

1014
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,059
You can get it here

1015
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,061
I can't do that

1016
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,063
Stick to your goal

1017
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,066
In this economy

1018
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,067
You need a rich backer

1019
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,068
Since I've been with Jenny

1020
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,070
My life is better

1021
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,072
Since I've been with Jane

1022
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,075
I have a new home

1023
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,077
Fatty took me shopping

1024
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:44,080
Look, a Praha wallet

1025
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,084
I have a Perraer, look

1026
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,086
It's Cartier

1027
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,088
Right

1028
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,089
With diamonds

1029
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,091
Forget it

1030
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,093
You can think for yourself

1031
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,095
Youth fades

1032
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:03,099
Find someone rich

1033
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,101
To care for you

1034
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:09,105
It's good

1035
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:12,108
There's a "Dancing Queen" at Club 258

1036
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,111
Incredible face and body

1037
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:19,115
And she's rich, and fussy

1038
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:22,118
We'll go with you soon

1039
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,120
But you must be smart

1040
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,113
Think of us, too

1041
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:33,118
You must repay our loan

1042
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,131
We have more cars to test

1043
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,132
Hurry

1044
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:40,125
Coming!

1045
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,144
I miss Mi

1046
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:52,137
She must hate me

1047
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,153
Explaining would be useless

1048
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:01,146
I'm not rich

1049
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:06,151
Even dogs ignore me

1050
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,173
Riding the wind purposely

1051
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:20,176
Found a landing spot

1052
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:24,180
There you are waiting

1053
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,184
Waiting for me

1054
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,187
I dash downward

1055
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,190
Either toilsomely

1056
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,193
Or lazily

1057
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:41,197
Same target

1058
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:44,200
From the air

1059
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,204
Things look like poker cards

1060
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:51,207
Should you vanish

1061
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,210
I'd fall to pieces

1062
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,212
Call her if you want

1063
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,215
Go on

1064
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:03,219
And kiss you dearly

1065
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,222
Then I'd have lived

1066
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:09,225
Forever

1067
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:13,229
Should accidents prevail

1068
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:17,222
And I'm ocean-bound

1069
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:22,238
Your passionate eyes

1070
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,240
Sleepless

1071
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,243
Sceptical

1072
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,245
Disturbed

1073
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:32,248
I must buy her a "Strong Wife"

1074
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,249
Does it work?

1075
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,251
I don't know

1076
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,252
But the ad says

1077
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,254
"Face it quietly...

1078
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,256
...and bravely"

1079
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,259
You're like the sky

1080
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,262
And I'm the wind

1081
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:50,266
Drifting and drifting

1082
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:53,269
Out of balance

1083
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,272
I'm neither confident

1084
01:02:56,272 --> 01:03:00,276
Nor special

1085
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,279
But with your love

1086
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,282
I'm brave

1087
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:09,285
From the air

1088
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:13,278
Things look like poker cards

1089
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:18,294
So much junk food

1090
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,296
Mi has been jilted

1091
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:23,299
She'll only eat these

1092
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:27,292
- Really?
- Yes

1093
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,307
You're big

1094
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:35,311
You're not small

1095
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,312
I head Mi has been jilted

1096
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,314
And is like a junkie!

1097
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,316
No

1098
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,317
Hold the phone

1099
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,318
Sure

1100
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,321
You're dressed too warmly

1101
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,323
Uncle D

1102
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,324
What is it?

1103
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,326
I hear Mi is a junkie, and suicidal

1104
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:54,319
I'll suicide you!

1105
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,338
You okay?

1106
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,339
Daughter

1107
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,340
What happened?

1108
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,344
Mi!

1109
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:11,347
Mi!

1110
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,350
I'm glad you're here

1111
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,352
I'm out of propane at home

1112
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,353
So I'll buy some

1113
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,356
I might as well give

1114
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:23,359
My business to my friend

1115
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,360
Thanks

1116
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:28,353
You look terrible

1117
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,368
Where is your car?

1118
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:36,372
I'll take it there

1119
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,375
Are you all right?

1120
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,376
Your boyfriend?

1121
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:43,379
Your girlfriend?

1122
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,380
Just friends

1123
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,382
I'm carrying it for her, okay?

1124
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,384
We're in no hurry

1125
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,387
Haven't been to a village in a while

1126
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,389
I want to walk around

1127
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,391
Be careful in your

1128
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,394
High heels

1129
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,395
True

1130
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,398
We'll just sit and chat

1131
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:06,391
Hey, anything to drink?

1132
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:13,409
They're so rude

1133
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,411
I know!

1134
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:18,414
Let's beat them up

1135
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,417
We can't

1136
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,419
They are guests

1137
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:27,412
Get someone else to do it

1138
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,430
Soda?

1139
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:38,434
Help yourselves

1140
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,437
I don't let her have soda

1141
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:45,441
- Go ahead
- Thanks

1142
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,443
Drink up

1143
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,446
So you can go

1144
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,449
No, my home has just been sprayed

1145
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,451
You know, it takes the smell

1146
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,454
A long time to go away

1147
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,456
In a 4,000 square-foot home

1148
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,458
4 of up, perfect for mah-jong

1149
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,459
Great!

1150
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,461
I don't know how

1151
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:09,454
Just play

1152
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:16,461
So slow

1153
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:21,477
8 Bamboos

1154
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:22,478
9 Coins?

1155
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,480
I have 3 triples!

1156
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,483
Be careful

1157
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,485
Mi...

1158
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:30,486
1 Coin? Mine!

1159
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,489
3 triples, last tile!

1160
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,490
I just dropped it

1161
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,492
That's Taiwan rules

1162
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,494
No going back

1163
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:41,497
But we're playing Cantonese rules

1164
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,498
It's the same

1165
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:45,501
You must be quick

1166
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:49,494
To claim your tiles

1167
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:55,511
You must pay our losses

1168
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,514
What were you doing?

1169
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,516
You did this to yourself

1170
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,519
You forced me to play

1171
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,521
I'm paying your losses

1172
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,522
So shut up

1173
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,524
- You are stupid
- So dumb

1174
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,525
I was waiting for a Character tile

1175
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,527
Why did you discard a One Coin?

1176
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:12,528
I almost won

1177
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,530
Too dumb to play

1178
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,532
Let's beat them up now

1179
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,534
Calm down

1180
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,536
Give them more soda

1181
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:21,537
Yes

1182
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:24,529
How's your phlegm?

1183
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,561
Wilson?

1184
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:49,554
Wilson? Wilson?

1185
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:58,563
Wilson?

1186
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,577
Wilson...

1187
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,579
Are you Uncle?

1188
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,581
He called me Uncle!

1189
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,583
I want...

1190
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,585
To buy propane?

1191
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,586
- We have fresh cans
- Thanks

1192
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,589
I came to see Mi

1193
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:17,582
Mi

1194
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,595
Please

1195
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,597
Sit

1196
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:22,598
My dad

1197
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:23,599
Hello, Uncle

1198
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,601
Wilson...

1199
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:26,602
My old classmates

1200
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,604
Hi!

1201
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,606
You must be MT

1202
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:34,610
Call me M

1203
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,611
Playing mah-jong?

1204
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,613
Yes

1205
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:38,614
Join us

1206
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:39,615
I don't play

1207
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,617
Come on

1208
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,619
- I don't play
- Come on

1209
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:47,612
I don't play mah-jong

1210
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:52,617
What's the bet?

1211
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:54,630
3 Bamboo

1212
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,632
I don't think so

1213
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:59,635
Quiet, let Mi play

1214
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,638
Leave this, or this

1215
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,640
Or claim that

1216
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,643
Mi has 3 triples, she's winning

1217
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:11,636
Careful

1218
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:21,657
Two Bamboos Open Kong

1219
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,660
I picked a 3 Bamboos

1220
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,661
Amazing

1221
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,663
That's the wrong call

1222
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,664
You're crazy

1223
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:31,667
I need 2 Bamboos and you called
Open Kong

1224
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,669
Don't you know how to play?

1225
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,671
You just discarded 3 Bamboos

1226
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,674
She's crazy!

1227
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,677
She doesn't know how to play!

1228
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:44,680
I quit!

1229
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,683
Great

1230
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,685
Uncle, I'm Wilson

1231
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,687
Stay for dinner

1232
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,689
Just a shitty little meal

1233
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,690
Thanks

1234
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,693
You should eat out

1235
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:58,694
Come

1236
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,696
Okay?

1237
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,698
Sure

1238
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:06,702
Let's go

1239
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:10,695
Are you all right?

1240
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,740
I didn't think Mi

1241
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,742
Was so capable

1242
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,745
Why brag about minor things?

1243
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:50,746
Then, our land deal

1244
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:51,747
Don't worry

1245
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:55,740
We can have the whole city

1246
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:57,753
Bye!

1247
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,745
Bye!

1248
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:12,768
When did you get a nose ring?

1249
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,770
Just now, in the bathroom

1250
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,773
It hurts

1251
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,775
Don't be shy

1252
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:23,768
Go hunting, shopping

1253
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,787
"Dancing Queen" will be here soon

1254
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,789
At that time

1255
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,792
Don't think of dignity

1256
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:40,796
But of yourself, and our money

1257
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:44,789
We'll watch out for you

1258
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:52,808
Sorry, it's too crowded

1259
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,811
Are you alone?

1260
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:59,804
Nice legs

1261
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:13,818
He's on his way

1262
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:36,841
"Dancing Queen" is here

1263
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:02,878
Not bad

1264
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,880
Make your move

1265
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,873
Hurry, before anyone else

1266
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:32,897
Hurry

1267
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:43,908
Help!

1268
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:12,948
Let's go

1269
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:16,941
So soon?

1270
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,957
Mi!

1271
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:22,958
Are you all right?

1272
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:23,959
Fine

1273
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,961
Don't go! Mi!

1274
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:26,962
You know him?

1275
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:27,963
No

1276
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:31,956
No?

1277
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,994
We'll eat these wings

1278
01:14:58,994 --> 01:14:59,995
Close up shop

1279
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,998
And sleep

1280
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:05,000
You're a good buddy

1281
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,993
With me when I'm sad

1282
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:14,009
Good thing I didn't explain

1283
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:18,013
Mi's with Wilson now

1284
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:20,015
He suits her

1285
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,018
I'm old and poor

1286
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:26,021
We'd make her life hard

1287
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:30,025
She must be so happy

1288
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:34,018
That's good

1289
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:53,048
You said you don't like men dancing

1290
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,050
What happened in Italy?

1291
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:59,043
Why did you abandon me?

1292
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:03,058
So what if I did?

1293
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:07,051
Nothing wrong with that

1294
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:11,066
What?

1295
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:14,069
We like rich people

1296
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,071
It's good you're with Wilson

1297
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:19,074
Congratulations

1298
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:22,077
In the mood for barbecue?

1299
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,079
Why not?

1300
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:27,082
Hungry? Have one

1301
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:31,086
Yes, I did it to myself

1302
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,088
Fine!

1303
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:36,091
Your kaleidoscope; you liked it

1304
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:40,084
Fine

1305
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:24,139
Don't misunderstand

1306
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:28,143
I didn't

1307
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,144
Will you ask me in?

1308
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:32,147
Why?

1309
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,148
Very direct!

1310
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:36,151
When my friend saw you

1311
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:38,153
She was very unhappy

1312
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,154
What the hell?

1313
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,156
Very direct!

1314
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,157
I like direct people

1315
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:46,161
I don't want her to be unhappy

1316
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:49,164
Take this cheque

1317
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:53,157
Don't make her unhappy

1318
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:58,173
I'm not buying love

1319
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:02,166
When she's happy, I'm happy

1320
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,181
Bye

1321
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:08,183
Wait!

1322
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:10,185
Yes?

1323
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:13,188
Can you put my name on it?

1324
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:16,191
My forgetful secretary

1325
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,193
To the company, or to you?

1326
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,194
My name

1327
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,195
Which is?

1328
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,196
Christmas Yan

1329
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,198
Christmas Yan?

1330
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,199
Mr. Yan, you're from...

1331
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,200
Hubei

1332
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,201
- Hubei?
- Yes

1333
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:29,204
Hello. I'm Wilson

1334
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,205
Mr.?

1335
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,206
Yan

1336
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,207
From?

1337
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:35,199
Hubei!

1338
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:24,259
Mi

1339
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:28,252
Marry me

1340
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,277
What are you doing?

1341
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,279
Putting on the ring

1342
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,281
Stand up

1343
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:49,284
Asking for her hand in daylight?

1344
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,286
How can she agree

1345
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:55,290
In front of everyone?

1346
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:59,283
Seal it with a kiss

1347
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,305
Out village is peaceful

1348
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:14,298
Blessed and beautiful

1349
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,313
Does Wilson suit me?

1350
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:22,317
He's not bad

1351
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:25,320
But no sparks

1352
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,323
Be patient

1353
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:31,326
Overcome it

1354
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,327
When's the banquet?

1355
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,329
How many tables?

1356
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:38,333
1st, I hope to fix my own company

1357
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,336
4th, I'm concerned about our youth

1358
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:43,338
About our village

1359
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:44,339
- Yes
- Like this?

1360
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:46,341
- Yes!
- Speak!

1361
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,343
I hope we improve

1362
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:50,345
Ourselves

1363
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,348
Play badminton

1364
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:57,341
- He's drunk
- Get the pen!

1365
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,356
Can I have your

1366
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:02,357
Autograph?

1367
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:03,358
Sure

1368
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:05,360
Here

1369
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,362
Uncle

1370
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:11,366
I can't sign a land sales contract

1371
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,367
He's not drunk

1372
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:13,368
Intoxicate him!

1373
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:16,371
Drink!

1374
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,373
Quiet!

1375
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:19,374
Where's your car?

1376
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:22,377
I need a life line

1377
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:24,379
Tell me, you be quiet

1378
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:28,372
Our youth should raise their competitiveness

1379
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,388
Set their sights far

1380
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:37,381
To compete in China

1381
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:30,445
Come out!

1382
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:34,438
Come out!

1383
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:40,444
Out of the way!

1384
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,465
Hi!

1385
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:54,469
What are you doing?

1386
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:55,470
How dare you!

1387
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,472
I fed you wings and you betrayed me?

1388
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:59,474
You...

1389
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:03,467
Why did you give me glass slippers?

1390
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:08,483
You asked why

1391
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:10,485
I gave you what I like

1392
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:14,478
So I'm giving you what you like

1393
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:20,484
Where did you get the money?

1394
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:23,498
Your friend

1395
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,500
Forced a cheque on me

1396
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,504
I had to take it

1397
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:33,508
But I'll repay him in installments

1398
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:35,510
What does this mean?

1399
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,512
Mi

1400
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,514
Mi

1401
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,516
Don't go

1402
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:44,519
Listen to me

1403
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:47,522
I've thought it out

1404
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,524
I don't want you to be unhappy

1405
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:51,526
There is a reason why

1406
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:54,529
I didn't return for you

1407
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:58,522
I was going to rob someone

1408
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:02,537
But they're bigger than I

1409
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,539
And I was afraid

1410
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:07,542
So I decided to beg

1411
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:10,545
But couldn't evoke pity

1412
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,548
So I took off my clothes

1413
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,550
To look more pathetic

1414
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:19,543
But the police came

1415
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:27,551
It's hot! It's hot!

1416
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:34,569
And took me away

1417
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:38,562
So I couldn't go back

1418
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:42,577
Really?

1419
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:43,578
Yes

1420
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,580
Why didn't you tell me?

1421
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,582
I don't want you to regret anything

1422
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:50,585
I can't even afford

1423
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:54,589
To fix my washing machine

1424
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,591
If you're with me

1425
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,593
You'd have to do laundry by hand

1426
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:00,595
And I can't afford lotions

1427
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:04,588
Soon you'll have "Housewife Hands"

1428
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,602
Mi

1429
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:10,605
You can't be a princess with me

1430
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:14,609
I can't make you happy

1431
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:18,602
Princesses can have "Housewife Hands"

1432
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:23,618
Then can we be together

1433
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,620
Alaise and forever?

1434
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,623
It's "always"

1435
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:32,616
Always and forever

1436
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:41,636
Did you get naked?

1437
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:45,629
Down to my underpants

1438
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:53,648
How did you get to the police station?

1439
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:55,650
Walked

1440
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,651
How long?

1441
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,644
15 minutes, I was freezing

1442
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:07,651
Why didn't you pull up your pants?

1443
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,666
I was handcuffed

1444
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,669
I couldn't understand the policeman

1445
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:15,670
So I didn't dare move

1446
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,672
In case he shot me

1447
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:21,665
In case he shot me

1448
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:36,680
Where's Mi?

1449
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:40,695
What is it?

1450
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,697
Nothing

1451
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:43,698
It looks like her

1452
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,701
Nothing

1453
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:48,703
It is her!

1454
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:49,704
You're wrong!

1455
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:53,697
- Let's drink
- It's really Mi!

1456
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:05,709
Excuse me

1457
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:13,728
- They're shooting TV
- What is it?

1458
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,730
- Congratulations!
- Say something

1459
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:18,733
Everyone wants to know about you

1460
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:22,726
What's going on?

1461
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:26,741
Looks good! Congratulations

1462
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:27,742
To us?

1463
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:28,743
Yes!

1464
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:31,746
You had been selected by our company

1465
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:34,749
We've filmed the whole process

1466
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:37,752
Others have received this book

1467
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:40,755
But never has anyone

1468
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:44,759
Given up money for love

1469
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,761
I admire you!

1470
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:49,764
He means you

1471
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,766
We've filmed your story

1472
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,768
for a reality show

1473
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:57,761
But I need to buy your rights

1474
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:02,777
For $10 million

1475
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:04,779
$10 million?

1476
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,781
$10 million?

1477
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:10,785
Excuse me

1478
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:13,788
I'm Uncle D, their manager

1479
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,790
Let's talk about this

1480
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,793
$10 million is not enough

1481
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:20,795
How much do you want?

1482
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,797
Start with $500 million

1483
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:23,798
Let's talk

1484
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:26,801
We'll follow

1485
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:29,804
I will marry a rich man!

1486
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,806
And I, a rich woman!

1487
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:34,809
We're both rich

1488
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:36,811
Why don't we...

1489
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:40,804
We should

1490
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:31,866
Wife

1491
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:34,869
How many kids do you want?

1492
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,871
None

1493
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:40,875
But you love kids

1494
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:41,876
I do

1495
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:44,879
I didn't say I'd have any

1496
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:45,880
No

1497
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,882
Then I'll force you to!

1498
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:49,884
- No
- Will you have children?

1499
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,886
- No
- How many?

1500
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:54,889
Welcome to "Marry a Rich Man"

1501
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:56,891
Before we introduce Mas and Mi

1502
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:57,892
It's starting

1503
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:01,896
We spoke to some of their friends

1504
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:03,898
My daughter married a rich man

1505
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:05,900
Because she lives in Harmony Village

1506
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,903
Temperate climate, great feng-shui

1507
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:12,907
Suitable for all major developers

1508
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:14,909
Even if you don't buy land

1509
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:18,913
Take home some propane as a souvenir

1510
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:19,914
My fortune was right

1511
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:20,915
Do you want kids?

1512
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:22,917
Let's watch the show

1513
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:24,919
She did marry a rich man

1514
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:27,922
If she can marry rich

1515
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:28,923
So can I

1516
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:32,927
I'm so excited

1517
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:34,929
Do you want kids?

1518
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:35,930
In a moment

1519
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:36,931
Who are you?

1520
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:37,932
Why are you here?

1521
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:38,933
From which paper?

1522
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:39,934
Are you paparazzi?

1523
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,936
Turn it off!

1524
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:44,939
It's not me, I love my wife

1525
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:45,940
I love mine

1526
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:46,941
I didn't...

1527
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:49,944
I only visit proper massage parlors

1528
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:53,937
Turn it off

1529
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:01,956
Do you want kids?

1530
01:31:01,956 --> 01:31:02,957
Are you safe?

1531
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,959
Yes

1532
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:05,960
Boy or girl?

1533
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,963
Whichever

1534
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:09,964
How many times?

1535
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:11,966
Up to you

1536
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,969
You have a huge stomach!

1537
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:17,972
No, this is muscle!

1538
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:21,965
It's ugly.
