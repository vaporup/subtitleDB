1
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,283
Hello, stranger.

2
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:13,695
Sorry. Looking for a cigarette.

3
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:15,947
I've given up.

4
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:19,993
Thank you.

5
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,581
- Got to be somewhere?
- Work.

6
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,084
You didn't fancy my sandwiches?

7
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,837
- Don't eat fish.
- Why not?

8
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,423
Fish piss in the sea.

9
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:36,760
- So do children.
- Don't eat children, either.

10
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:39,554
What's your work?

11
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:41,806
I'm sort of a journalist.

12
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,976
- What sort?
- I write obituaries.

13
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:59,115
Are we in for a long wait?

14
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,328
She was 21 when she came in.

15
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,207
Does it hurt?

16
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,251
I'll live.

17
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:12,837
Do you want me to put your leg up?

18
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,464
Yes, please.

19
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:31,273
Who cut off your crusts?

20
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:32,691
Me.

21
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:35,694
Did your mother cut off your crusts
when you were a little boy?

22
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:39,155
- Yes, I believe she did.
- You should eat your crusts.

23
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:41,408
You should stop smoking.

24
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,452
How long was I out?

25
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:47,080
- About 10 seconds.
- Then what?

26
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:50,333
You came to. You focused on me.

27
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:53,128
You said, "Hello, stranger."

28
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,754
What a floozy.

29
00:04:54,838 --> 00:04:58,675
The cabbie crossed himself, he went,
"Thank fuck. I thought I'd killed her."

30
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,094
I said, "Let's get her to a hospital."
He hesitated.

31
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:04,472
I think he thought there'd be paperwork
and he'd be held responsible.

32
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:08,018
So I said with a slight sneer,
"Please just drop us at the hospital."

33
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,686
Show me the sneer.

34
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:12,564
Very good, buster.

35
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:15,150
Thank you.

36
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,202
- I told you, I've given up.
- Try harder.

37
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:27,829
You live here?

38
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,415
Just arrived from New York.

39
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:33,084
Taking a vacation?

40
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,045
I'm on an expedition.

41
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,464
Where's your baggage?

42
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:41,343
- Where are you staying?
- I'm a waif.

43
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,472
A red bus.

44
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:51,561
Policeman or "bobby."
Observe the distinctive helmet.

45
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:55,732
Saint Paul's Cathedral.
Please note the famous dome.

46
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:59,611
- This is a truly magnificent tour.
- It's the London tourists never get to see.

47
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:02,530
- What's this?
- I've no idea.

48
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:27,055
They're all people
who died saving the lives of others.

49
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:30,642
I've been here before.

50
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:43,071
Twenty years ago, we came here.

51
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:48,285
My mother's dead. My father and I came here
the afternoon she died.

52
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:53,748
She was a smoker.
She died in the hospital, actually.

53
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:56,543
- Is your father still alive?
- Hanging on.

54
00:06:57,002 --> 00:06:58,295
He's in a home.

55
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,173
- You're late for work.
- You saying you want me to go?

56
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:04,175
I'm saying you're late for work.

57
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:07,429
How did you end up writing obituaries?

58
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:11,850
Well, I had dreams of being a writer,
but I had no voice.

59
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,853
What am I saying? I had no talent.

60
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:19,190
So I ended up in obituaries,
which is the Siberia of journalism.

61
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:23,153
Tell me what you do.
I want to imagine you in Siberia.

62
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,529
Really?

63
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:30,285
We call it "the obits page."

64
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:34,164
There's three of us: me, Graham, and Harry.

65
00:07:34,748 --> 00:07:38,877
When I get to work, without fail...
Are you sure you want to know?

66
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,049
Well, if someone important died,
we go to the "deep freeze"...

67
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,014
which is a computer file...

68
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:54,392
with all the obituaries,
and we find the dead person's life.

69
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:57,103
People's obituaries are written
while they're still alive?

70
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:58,772
Some people's.

71
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:02,400
Then Harry, he's the editor,
decides who we'll lead with.

72
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:04,694
Then we make calls, check facts.

73
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:09,324
At 6:00, we stand around the computer
and look at the next day's page...

74
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:12,410
and make final changes.

75
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:15,580
Add a few euphemisms
for our own amusement.

76
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:16,957
Such as?

77
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:23,421
"He was a convivial fellow."
Meaning he was an alcoholic.

78
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:27,592
"He valued his privacy." Gay.

79
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,845
"He enjoyed his privacy." Raging queen.

80
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:34,099
What would my euphemism be?

81
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,061
- "She was disarming."
- That's not a euphemism.

82
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,438
Yes, it is.

83
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:52,367
- What were you doing in New York?
- You know.

84
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:59,916
Well, no, I don't. What, were you studying?

85
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,376
Stripping.

86
00:09:02,836 --> 00:09:05,088
Look at your little eyes.

87
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,049
I can't see my little eyes.

88
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,973
Why did you leave?

89
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:17,601
Problems with a male.

90
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:19,519
- Boyfriend?
- Kind of.

91
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,939
And you left him, just like that?

92
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:27,027
It's the only way to leave.
"I don't love you anymore. Goodbye."

93
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,322
- Supposing you do still love them?
- You don't leave.

94
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:34,326
- You've never left somebody you still love?
- No.

95
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,789
This is me.

96
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:47,839
Enjoy your stay.

97
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:52,344
Please remember
our traffic tends to come from the right.

98
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:55,221
Bye.

99
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:09,945
Do you have a girlfriend?

100
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,655
Yeah. Ruth.

101
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:15,200
She's called Ruth. She's a linguist.

102
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:18,745
- What's your name?
- Alice.

103
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:22,332
My name is Alice Ayres.

104
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:30,507
Good.

105
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,760
I'm just gonna change the film.
Are you okay for time?

106
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:40,558
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- lf you must.

107
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:44,271
- I don't have to.
- Then don't.

108
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:58,076
I liked your book.

109
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:00,161
Thanks.

110
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,958
- When's it published?
- Next year. How come you've read it?

111
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,253
Your publisher sent me a manuscript.
I read it last night.

112
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,797
You kept me up till 4:00.

113
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,091
I'm flattered.

114
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,927
Is your heroine
based on someone you know?

115
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,680
Yes. She's someone called Alice.

116
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,683
How does she feel
about you stealing her life?

117
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:23,226
Borrowing her life.

118
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:25,937
I'm dedicating the book to her.
She's pleased.

119
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:36,239
Do you exhibit?

120
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:39,200
Sometimes. I have a thing next year.

121
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:46,541
Portraits?

122
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:51,212
- Of who?
- Strangers.

123
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:57,677
How do your strangers feel
about you stealing their lives?

124
00:11:57,844 --> 00:11:59,262
Borrowing.

125
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,182
Am I a stranger?

126
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:04,809
No. You're a job.

127
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:08,772
And you're a sloucher. Sit up.

128
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:16,905
You didn't find it obscene?

129
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:18,573
- What?
- The book.

130
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:22,035
I thought it was accurate.

131
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:24,162
About what?

132
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,748
About sex. About love.

133
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:28,500
In what way?

134
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,170
- You wrote it.
- You read it till 4:00.

135
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:35,590
Don't raise your eyebrows.
It makes you look smug.

136
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,185
- But you did like it?
- Yes, but I could go off it.

137
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:54,943
Stand up.

138
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,034
Any criticisms?

139
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:06,204
I'm not sure about the title.

140
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:07,831
Got a better one?

141
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,250
<i>The Aquarium.</i>

142
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:13,003
So you liked the filth.

143
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:16,047
- You like aquariums.
- Fish are therapeutic.

144
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:18,508
- Hang out in aquariums, do you?
- When I can.

145
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,385
Good for picking up strangers?

146
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:22,804
Photographing strangers.

147
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:33,773
Come here.

148
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:52,751
You're beautiful.

149
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:02,761
I don't kiss strange men.

150
00:14:03,136 --> 00:14:04,638
Neither do I.

151
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:18,670
Do you and this Alice live together?

152
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:24,801
Yes.

153
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:37,731
Are you married?

154
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:39,149
Yes.

155
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:41,985
- No. Yes.
- Which?

156
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,987
Separated.

157
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:46,239
- Do you have any children?
- No.

158
00:15:46,323 --> 00:15:49,326
- Would you like some?
- Yes, but not today.

159
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:52,370
Would Alice like children?

160
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:54,956
She's too young.

161
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:59,669
She works in a café near here.
She's coming to meet me.

162
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,838
Quite soon.

163
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:06,843
Why are you wasting her time?

164
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:10,805
- You're judgmental.
- You're devious.

165
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:14,559
I'm not wasting her time.
She's completely lovable.

166
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:16,478
And completely unleavable.

167
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:20,565
And you don't want someone else
getting their dirty hands on her.

168
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,692
- Men are crap.
- But all the same...

169
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:24,402
They're still crap.

170
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:27,364
Your muse.

171
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:32,702
- You've ruined my life.
- You'll get over it.

172
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:42,420
Dan.

173
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:46,049
Your shirt.

174
00:16:57,477 --> 00:16:59,187
You all done?

175
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:02,357
- How's the photographer?
- Good. Professional.

176
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:05,735
Rigorous. Beady. One of your lot.

177
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:08,029
<i>- What, female?
- Americano.</i>

178
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:13,618
Come on.

179
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:24,421
Anna?

180
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:30,802
- Alice.
- Hi.

181
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:33,888
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, we've just finished.

182
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:36,516
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thanks.

183
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,394
I've been serving it all day.
Can I use your loo?

184
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,396
Sure. Just through there.

185
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:50,280
She is beautiful.

186
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:52,407
- I've got to see you.
- No.

187
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:54,451
What's this? Patriotism?

188
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:56,328
- I don't want trouble.
- I'm not trouble.

189
00:17:56,411 --> 00:17:57,829
You're taken.

190
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:01,666
- I've got to see you.
- Tough.

191
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,419
- You kissed me.
- What are you, 12?

192
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:10,091
I'm a block of ice.

193
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:15,221
Will you take my photo?

194
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:18,016
I've never been photographed
by a professional before.

195
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:20,644
I'd really appreciate it. I can pay you.

196
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:22,479
No, I'd like to.

197
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:24,731
Only if you don't mind.

198
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:26,524
Why should I?

199
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:28,610
Because you'll have to go away.

200
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:31,529
We don't want him here
while we're working, do we?

201
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:33,156
No, we don't.

202
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:38,370
Right. I'll be in the pub on the corner.

203
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:39,704
Have fun.

204
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,251
Thank you.

205
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:47,879
- Good luck with your exhibition.
- Good luck with your book.

206
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,563
So you've got an exhibition?

207
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:07,691
Yeah.

208
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:14,072
I read Dan's book.

209
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:17,951
You've had quite a life.

210
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:20,745
Thanks.

211
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,962
He said you work in a café?

212
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:30,922
I am a waitress.

213
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:33,008
That's a temporary thing?

214
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:34,968
No.

215
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:41,558
Why don't you come over here and sit?

216
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,870
- You live here?
- I do now.

217
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,955
Because you're single?

218
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,791
Who was your last boyfriend?

219
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,627
My husband.

220
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,295
Was he English?

221
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:13,340
- Very.
- What happened to him?

222
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:16,551
Someone younger.

223
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:21,765
You've got a great face.

224
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:24,643
Doesn't everyone?

225
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:27,520
I suppose so.

226
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:28,939
I just...

227
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:31,983
From the book,
somehow I thought you'd be less...

228
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:33,610
What?

229
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:38,782
I don't know what, exactly.

230
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,298
How do you feel about him using your life?

231
00:20:55,966 --> 00:20:58,426
It's really none of your business.

232
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:06,142
When he let me in downstairs...

233
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:08,687
he had this look.

234
00:21:11,106 --> 00:21:13,525
I just listened to your conversation.

235
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,198
I don't know what to say.

236
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:25,870
I'm not a thief, Alice.

237
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:34,004
Do you want a drink?

238
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:36,590
I have some vodka in the fridge.
We could have a drink.

239
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:38,508
Just take my picture.

240
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:00,697
Good.

241
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:00,734
Shit.

242
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:34,893
What's the histology?

243
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:42,150
Progressive?

244
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:45,028
No. Sounds like an atrophy.

245
00:24:45,236 --> 00:24:46,905
Okay. Bye.

246
00:25:02,254 --> 00:25:03,588
Bollocks.

247
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:38,516
Jesus.

248
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:19,394
Anna?

249
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:25,192
I got the coat.

250
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:27,528
The white coat.

251
00:29:29,696 --> 00:29:31,031
So I see.

252
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:34,409
I'm Larry. The doctor.

253
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:36,036
Hello, Dr. Larry.

254
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:39,039
Feel free to call me "The Sultan."

255
00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:47,840
I can't believe these things actually happen.

256
00:29:48,215 --> 00:29:50,676
I thought if you showed up,
you'd be an old trout.

257
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,637
But you are bloody gorgeous.

258
00:29:54,596 --> 00:29:56,223
Well, thank you.

259
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,145
Fish. You gotta respect them.

260
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:04,314
- Have you?
- Of course.

261
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,526
We were fish. Long ago.

262
00:30:07,943 --> 00:30:09,820
Before we were apes.

263
00:30:13,532 --> 00:30:15,450
You mentioned a hotel.

264
00:30:15,951 --> 00:30:17,452
No rush.

265
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:22,583
Actually, there is.
I've got to be in surgery by 3:00.

266
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:26,920
- Are you having an operation?
- No, I'm doing one.

267
00:30:27,754 --> 00:30:30,424
- Are you really a doctor?
- I said I was.

268
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:33,260
You are Anna?

269
00:30:35,596 --> 00:30:39,057
I'm sorry. Did I photograph you?

270
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:41,018
Did we meet somewhere?

271
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:44,771
Come on. Don't play games,
you nymph of the Net.

272
00:30:45,189 --> 00:30:47,733
- Excuse me?
- You were up for it yesterday.

273
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:51,111
- Was I?
- Yeah. "Wear my wet knickers.

274
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,906
"Sit on my face.

275
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:57,618
- "Cum-hungry bitch."
- Okay.

276
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,289
Why do I feel like a pervert?

277
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:07,711
I think you're the victim of a practical joke.

278
00:31:11,507 --> 00:31:14,134
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

279
00:31:18,263 --> 00:31:19,431
No.

280
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:23,477
We spoke on the Net last night.
Now you've seen me...

281
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,895
I wasn't on the Net last night.

282
00:31:24,978 --> 00:31:27,064
Where were you
between 6:45 and 7:00 p.m.?

283
00:31:27,147 --> 00:31:28,732
That's really none of your business.

284
00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:31,777
- Where were you?
- On the Net, talking to you.

285
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:36,156
- Well, I was talking to someone.
- Someone pretending to be me.

286
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:42,329
I think you were talking to Daniel Woolf.

287
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:45,457
- Who?
- This guy I know. It's him.

288
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,960
- No, I was talking to a woman.
- How do you know?

289
00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:50,671
Believe me, she was a woman.
I got a huge...

290
00:31:50,754 --> 00:31:53,549
She was a... She wasn't, was she?

291
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:55,092
No.

292
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:57,344
What a bastard.

293
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:04,518
How do you know him?

294
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,689
I don't really know him.
I took his photograph for a book he wrote.

295
00:32:08,772 --> 00:32:11,567
- I hope it sank without a trace.
- It's on its way.

296
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,861
There is justice in the world.

297
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:16,029
What's it called?

298
00:32:25,414 --> 00:32:26,874
<i>The Aquarium.</i>

299
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:30,252
What a prick! He's advertising.

300
00:32:32,296 --> 00:32:34,882
But why would he pretend to be you?

301
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,301
I think he likes me.

302
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:40,053
Funny way of showing it.
Can't he send you flowers?

303
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:42,723
Extraordinary thing, the Internet.

304
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:45,726
Possibility of genuine
global communication.

305
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:48,228
The first great democratic medium.

306
00:32:48,312 --> 00:32:51,023
Absolutely. It's the future.

307
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,775
Two guys wanking in cyberspace.

308
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:55,944
He was the wanker.

309
00:32:57,362 --> 00:32:59,698
I'll say this for him, he can write.

310
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:02,659
Is he in love with you?

311
00:33:02,743 --> 00:33:04,953
I don't know. No.

312
00:33:05,537 --> 00:33:08,373
- Are you in love with him?
- I hardly know him.

313
00:33:08,457 --> 00:33:10,584
But you're sort of interested.

314
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:13,086
I think he's interesting.

315
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:15,839
No, don't. I look like a criminal in photos.

316
00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:17,799
Please. It's my birthday.

317
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,176
Really?

318
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:21,261
Really.

319
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:36,944
Happy birthday.

320
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:41,156
Thank you.

321
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:44,660
This man comes into the café today
and he says:

322
00:33:44,743 --> 00:33:47,830
"Hey, waitress, what are you waiting for?"

323
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,665
Funny guy.

324
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:53,585
So I go,
"I'm waiting for a man to come in here...

325
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:57,548
"and fuck me sideways
with a beautiful line like that."

326
00:33:57,965 --> 00:33:59,466
What did he do?

327
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:02,094
Asked for a cup of tea with two sugars.

328
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:16,066
- I'm waiting for you.
- To do what?

329
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:19,611
Leave me.

330
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:24,449
I'm not going to leave you.
I totally love you. Why is this?

331
00:34:25,534 --> 00:34:28,662
Please let me come.
I want to be there for you.

332
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:32,207
- Are you ashamed of me?
- Of course not. I told you...

333
00:34:32,249 --> 00:34:34,668
- I want to be alone.
- Why?

334
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:38,338
To grieve.

335
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:40,591
To think.

336
00:34:43,177 --> 00:34:46,346
- I love you. Why won't you let me?
- It's only a weekend.

337
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:48,891
Why won't you let me love you?

338
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:53,770
Buster.

339
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:01,570
Let's go to this thing...

340
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:04,531
then I'll get my train. I'll be away one night.

341
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:07,534
I'll be back before you know it, okay?

342
00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:39,566
Do these people pay you?
Or do you pay them?

343
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:07,177
Like it?

344
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:11,306
No.

345
00:36:13,392 --> 00:36:15,435
What were you so sad about?

346
00:36:16,395 --> 00:36:18,772
- Life.
- What's that, then?

347
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:24,987
So what do you reckon, in general?

348
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,156
You want to talk about art?

349
00:36:27,197 --> 00:36:30,617
I know it's vulgar to discuss The Work
at an opening of The Work...

350
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:32,786
but someone's got to do it.

351
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,291
I'm serious. What do you think?

352
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,960
It's a lie.

353
00:36:40,669 --> 00:36:44,298
It's a bunch of sad strangers
photographed beautifully...

354
00:36:44,756 --> 00:36:49,094
and all the glittering assholes
who appreciate art...

355
00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:52,890
say it's beautiful
because that's what they want to see.

356
00:36:52,973 --> 00:36:55,476
But the people in the photos are sad...

357
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:57,686
and alone.

358
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:01,440
But the pictures
make the world seem beautiful...

359
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:05,903
so the exhibition's reassuring,
which makes it a lie.

360
00:37:06,445 --> 00:37:09,114
And everyone loves a big, fat lie.

361
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:13,118
- I'm the big, fat liar's boyfriend.
- Bastard.

362
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:15,162
- Larry.
- Alice.

363
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:19,917
So you're Anna's boyfriend.

364
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,877
A princess can kiss a toad.

365
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:23,003
- Frog.
- Toad.

366
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:26,256
- Frog.
- Toad, frog, lobster. They're all the same.

367
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:30,135
So how long have you been seeing her?

368
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:32,930
Four months. We're in the first flush.

369
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:37,309
It's paradise. All my nasty habits amuse her.

370
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:39,853
- You shouldn't smoke.
- Fuck off.

371
00:37:39,895 --> 00:37:42,481
I'm a doctor.
I'm supposed to say things like that.

372
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:44,441
- You want one?
- No.

373
00:37:45,234 --> 00:37:46,902
Yes. No.

374
00:37:47,277 --> 00:37:48,987
Fuck it, yes.

375
00:37:49,738 --> 00:37:51,073
No.

376
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:54,076
I've given up.

377
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:59,331
Anna tells me your bloke wrote a book.

378
00:37:59,414 --> 00:38:02,084
- Any good?
- Of course.

379
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:04,711
It's about you, isn't it?

380
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:08,382
- Some of me.
- Oh? What did he leave out?

381
00:38:09,675 --> 00:38:11,343
The truth.

382
00:38:12,261 --> 00:38:13,971
Is he here, your bloke?

383
00:38:14,054 --> 00:38:17,141
Yeah, he's over there talking to your bird.

384
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:22,604
My boyfriend's here.

385
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,232
He's here? Where?

386
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:28,235
There.

387
00:38:29,278 --> 00:38:30,612
With Alice?

388
00:38:31,071 --> 00:38:33,240
I believe you're acquainted.

389
00:38:37,536 --> 00:38:40,330
- I've never seen him before.
- No.

390
00:38:41,498 --> 00:38:42,916
But you've spoken.

391
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,252
Well, conversed.

392
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:48,672
- Corresponded.
- I wrote to him?

393
00:38:49,464 --> 00:38:53,510
On the Net. You sent him to the aquarium.
I happened to be there.

394
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:56,054
Nice work, Cupid.

395
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:02,811
- We need to talk about this.
- No, we don't.

396
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:04,480
He's very pretty.

397
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:08,192
She is very tall.

398
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:15,157
So you're a stripper?

399
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:17,117
Yeah.

400
00:39:17,868 --> 00:39:19,036
And?

401
00:39:41,934 --> 00:39:43,602
You take care, now.

402
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:45,270
I will.

403
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:47,105
You, too.

404
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:57,991
That's the way it should be.

405
00:40:01,662 --> 00:40:03,163
He's very funny.

406
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,170
Excuse me. Nice to meet you.

407
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:19,721
- Pleased with the success?
- Yes, absolutely.

408
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:22,516
Yours was the best.

409
00:40:23,016 --> 00:40:25,018
You were the belle of the bullshit.

410
00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:26,812
Who were those awful people?

411
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:29,982
- Where do they come from?
- Why should we care?

412
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:37,573
- You get this one. You'll miss your train.
- I'll be fine.

413
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:39,575
Come on, it's cold.

414
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:47,916
I'll see you on Sunday.

415
00:40:53,255 --> 00:40:54,756
Where to, love?

416
00:40:58,927 --> 00:41:00,095
Taxi!

417
00:41:11,273 --> 00:41:12,399
Sorry.

418
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:15,402
Why don't you make up
your bleeding mind?

419
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:23,869
Thank you so much.
I appreciate your coming.

420
00:41:23,952 --> 00:41:26,205
I'll call you tomorrow. See you next week.

421
00:41:26,288 --> 00:41:28,207
- Thanks.
- Thanks very much.

422
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:33,962
- I thought you'd gone.
- I forgot this.

423
00:41:36,131 --> 00:41:40,052
So he's a dermatologist.
Can you get more boring than that?

424
00:41:40,135 --> 00:41:43,096
- Obituarist?
- Failed novelist, please.

425
00:41:43,931 --> 00:41:45,682
I was sorry about your book.

426
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:47,935
Thanks. I blame the title.

427
00:41:48,227 --> 00:41:51,438
So we pull out our Christmas crackers
with those appalling jokes.

428
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,191
My guy says,
"Hang on. These are second-rate jokes.

429
00:41:54,274 --> 00:41:57,778
"I've got a first-rate joke.
Sit back and take notice."

430
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,656
So we go, "Okay, what's the joke?"
And he says:

431
00:42:00,906 --> 00:42:02,658
<i>"It's based on A Christmas Carol...</i>

432
00:42:02,741 --> 00:42:05,118
"which is why it seems
so relevant on Christmas Day."

433
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,538
I haven't even seen you for a year.

434
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:08,747
Yes, you have.

435
00:42:08,831 --> 00:42:11,208
Only because you stalk me
outside my studio.

436
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:13,335
I don't stalk. I lurk.

437
00:42:13,418 --> 00:42:15,629
And when I'm not there you look for me.

438
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:19,174
- How do you know if you're not there?
- Because I am there...

439
00:42:19,842 --> 00:42:21,552
lurking from a distance.

440
00:42:30,227 --> 00:42:31,562
Look at me.

441
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:34,481
Tell me you're not in love with me.

442
00:42:35,232 --> 00:42:37,401
I'm not in love with you.

443
00:42:40,028 --> 00:42:41,697
You just lied.

444
00:42:48,078 --> 00:42:50,664
I'm your stranger. Jump.

445
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:21,820
- Hello, stranger.
- Hello.

446
00:43:22,488 --> 00:43:24,490
Intense conversation?

447
00:43:26,867 --> 00:43:28,702
His father died.

448
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:31,288
Were you spying?

449
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:33,248
Lovingly observing...

450
00:43:33,499 --> 00:43:35,042
with a telescope.

451
00:43:37,377 --> 00:43:39,421
He's taller than in his photo.

452
00:43:40,047 --> 00:43:41,882
His photo's a headshot.

453
00:43:41,924 --> 00:43:43,550
Yeah, I know.

454
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:47,554
But his head implied a short body,
when, in fact, his head is deceptive.

455
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:48,764
Deceptive?

456
00:43:48,847 --> 00:43:52,267
He's actually got a long body.
He's a stringy fucker.

457
00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:54,937
I could have him.

458
00:43:55,938 --> 00:43:59,399
- What?
- lf it came to it, in a scrap, I could have him.

459
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:03,278
Did you tell him we call him Cupid?

460
00:44:03,987 --> 00:44:06,782
No, that's our joke.

461
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,953
I had a chat with young Alice.

462
00:44:11,036 --> 00:44:12,788
- Fancy her?
- Of course.

463
00:44:12,871 --> 00:44:14,581
- Not as much as you.
- Why not?

464
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:16,625
You're a woman. She's a girl.

465
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:20,212
She has the moronic beauty of youth,
but she's sly.

466
00:44:20,462 --> 00:44:23,924
- She seems open to me.
- That's how she wants to seem.

467
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:27,553
You forget you're dealing with
a clinical observer of the human carnival.

468
00:44:27,636 --> 00:44:29,471
- Am I, now?
- Yes.

469
00:44:29,513 --> 00:44:33,475
You seem more like the cat
that got the cream. Stop licking yourself.

470
00:44:39,106 --> 00:44:42,276
That's the nastiest thing
you've ever said to me.

471
00:44:45,779 --> 00:44:47,364
That's horrible.

472
00:44:47,614 --> 00:44:49,074
I'm sorry.

473
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,119
I'm so sorry.

474
00:45:40,334 --> 00:45:43,212
- Where have you been?
- Work thing.

475
00:45:44,254 --> 00:45:47,257
Had a drink with Harry.
You never have one drink with Harry.

476
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:50,302
- You know he's in love with you.
- No, he's not.

477
00:45:51,303 --> 00:45:52,596
Is he?

478
00:45:54,473 --> 00:45:56,183
Did you eat?

479
00:45:56,433 --> 00:45:58,685
I'll make you something.

480
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:01,188
I'm not hungry.

481
00:46:23,252 --> 00:46:24,336
What?

482
00:46:28,048 --> 00:46:29,550
This will hurt.

483
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:32,261
I've been with Anna.

484
00:46:33,095 --> 00:46:34,805
I'm in love with her.

485
00:46:35,848 --> 00:46:38,475
We've been seeing each other for a year.

486
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:40,769
It began at her opening.

487
00:46:56,952 --> 00:46:59,079
- Have a nice one.
- Cheers, guvnor.

488
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,145
Don't move.

489
00:47:24,146 --> 00:47:26,231
I want to remember this moment forever.

490
00:47:26,315 --> 00:47:29,651
First time I walked through the door,
returning from a business trip...

491
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:32,488
to be greeted by my wife.

492
00:47:32,988 --> 00:47:35,657
I have, in this moment, become an adult.

493
00:47:35,949 --> 00:47:38,494
Thanks for waiting up, you darling.

494
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,955
You goddess.

495
00:47:46,168 --> 00:47:47,794
I missed you.

496
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,880
How about some tea?

497
00:47:50,255 --> 00:47:52,257
Jesus, I'm knackered!

498
00:47:52,341 --> 00:47:54,343
- Didn't you sleep on the plane?
- No...

499
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:58,472
because the permed German next to me
was snoring like a Messerschmitt.

500
00:47:58,555 --> 00:48:00,974
- What's the time?
- About midnight.

501
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:03,519
Time. What a tricky little fucker.

502
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:07,606
My head's in two places.
My brain actually hurts.

503
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:10,651
- Do you want some food?
- No, I need a bath.

504
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:14,238
- I'll run it for you.
- No, I'll have a shower.

505
00:48:14,613 --> 00:48:15,948
You okay?

506
00:48:16,698 --> 00:48:18,075
How was the thing?

507
00:48:18,158 --> 00:48:21,328
As dermatological conferences go,
it was a riot.

508
00:48:22,204 --> 00:48:23,831
How was the hotel?

509
00:48:24,164 --> 00:48:27,793
Someone told me that
the beautiful people of the Paranoid Hotel...

510
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:31,797
the concierge, the bellboys and girls...
Did you know this?

511
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:34,883
- They're all whores.
- Everybody knows that.

512
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:36,718
I didn't.

513
00:48:39,346 --> 00:48:42,349
I don't suppose you'd fancy a friendly poke.

514
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:44,434
I just had a bath.

515
00:48:45,978 --> 00:48:47,312
Right.

516
00:48:47,938 --> 00:48:50,899
I'll see to myself, then,
in the Elle Decoration bathroom.

517
00:48:50,941 --> 00:48:54,486
- You chose that bathroom.
- And every time I wash in it I feel dirty.

518
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,989
It's cleaner than I am. It's got attitude.

519
00:48:57,072 --> 00:48:59,032
The mirror says, "Who the fuck are you?"

520
00:48:59,074 --> 00:49:01,743
- You chose it.
- Doesn't mean I like it.

521
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,787
We shouldn't have this.

522
00:49:03,871 --> 00:49:05,706
I hear middle-class guilt.

523
00:49:05,747 --> 00:49:09,710
Working-class guilt.
Why are you dressed if you just had a bath?

524
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:12,963
We needed some milk.

525
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:15,299
You okay?

526
00:49:16,341 --> 00:49:18,051
- You?
- Yeah.

527
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:23,640
I'm going.

528
00:49:23,974 --> 00:49:26,310
- I'm sorry.
- Irrelevant.

529
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:29,354
What are you sorry for?

530
00:49:29,646 --> 00:49:31,148
Everything.

531
00:49:31,356 --> 00:49:34,359
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- Cowardice.

532
00:49:36,236 --> 00:49:38,030
Is it because she's successful?

533
00:49:38,113 --> 00:49:41,241
No, it's because she doesn't need me.

534
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,371
Did you bring her here?

535
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:49,750
Yes.

536
00:49:53,712 --> 00:49:56,798
- Didn't she get married?
- She stopped seeing me.

537
00:49:57,382 --> 00:49:59,468
Is that when we went to the country?

538
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,221
To celebrate our third anniversary?

539
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:07,059
Did you phone her? Beg her to come back?

540
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:10,270
- When you went for your long, lonely walks?
- Yes.

541
00:50:10,354 --> 00:50:11,730
You're a piece of shit.

542
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:14,817
Deception is brutal.
I'm not pretending otherwise.

543
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,068
How?

544
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,861
How does it work?

545
00:50:19,363 --> 00:50:21,532
How do you do this to someone?

546
00:50:23,325 --> 00:50:24,952
Not good enough.

547
00:50:26,286 --> 00:50:29,665
- I fell in love with her, Alice.
- As if you had no choice?

548
00:50:29,706 --> 00:50:31,667
There's a moment. There's always a moment.

549
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:34,878
"I can do this, I can give in to this,
or I can resist it."

550
00:50:34,962 --> 00:50:38,966
And I don't know when your moment was,
but I bet you there was one.

551
00:50:39,007 --> 00:50:40,467
I'm going.

552
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,681
- It's not safe out there.
- And it's safe in here?

553
00:50:45,722 --> 00:50:47,599
What about your things?

554
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:50,602
- I don't need things.
- Where will you go?

555
00:50:50,853 --> 00:50:52,187
Disappear.

556
00:50:55,023 --> 00:50:57,860
The Sultan has returned bearing gifts.

557
00:51:00,863 --> 00:51:02,197
Thank you.

558
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:08,912
They're beautiful.

559
00:51:08,996 --> 00:51:11,874
Here's a thing. Alice was at the hotel.

560
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:13,667
What?

561
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:16,587
They sell these arty postcards in the lobby.

562
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:19,298
I bought one to boost your sales.

563
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:24,178
"Young Woman, London."

564
00:51:25,637 --> 00:51:30,434
And I checked for your book
in The Museum of Modern Art. It was there.

565
00:51:31,393 --> 00:51:33,103
Someone bought one.

566
00:51:33,312 --> 00:51:35,981
This guy with a ridiculous little beard.

567
00:51:36,064 --> 00:51:40,694
He was drooling over your photo on
the inside cover. He fancied you, the geek.

568
00:51:40,903 --> 00:51:44,072
I was so proud of you.
You've broken New York.

569
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,241
You're wonderful.

570
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:49,244
Don't ever forget it.

571
00:51:53,123 --> 00:51:54,958
Can I still see you?

572
00:51:59,463 --> 00:52:02,424
Dan, can I still see you? Answer me.

573
00:52:02,508 --> 00:52:05,219
I can't see you.
If I see you, I'll never leave you.

574
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:08,722
- What will you do if I find someone else?
- Be jealous.

575
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:12,559
You still fancy me?

576
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:14,812
Of course.

577
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:17,064
You're lying.

578
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:19,900
I've been you.

579
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:24,655
Will you hold me?

580
00:52:30,536 --> 00:52:34,081
- I amuse you, but I bore you.
- No.

581
00:52:35,457 --> 00:52:37,334
You did love me?

582
00:52:38,252 --> 00:52:40,921
I'll always love you. I hate hurting you.

583
00:52:41,129 --> 00:52:42,673
Then why are you?

584
00:52:43,924 --> 00:52:45,843
'Cause I'm selfish.

585
00:52:46,301 --> 00:52:49,555
- And I think I'll be happier with her.
- You won't.

586
00:52:50,222 --> 00:52:52,057
You'll miss me.

587
00:52:53,058 --> 00:52:55,811
No one will ever love you as much as I do.

588
00:52:57,146 --> 00:52:59,273
Why isn't love enough?

589
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:04,361
I'm the one who leaves.
I'm supposed to leave you.

590
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:21,461
Make some tea, buster.

591
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:14,181
Why are you dressed?

592
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:19,978
Because I think
you might be about to leave me...

593
00:54:20,062 --> 00:54:23,106
and I didn't want to be wearing
a dressing gown.

594
00:54:26,026 --> 00:54:28,362
I slept with someone in New York.

595
00:54:29,571 --> 00:54:30,906
A whore.

596
00:54:32,241 --> 00:54:33,575
I'm sorry.

597
00:54:37,913 --> 00:54:39,748
Why did you tell me?

598
00:54:40,707 --> 00:54:43,502
- I couldn't lie to you.
- Why not?

599
00:54:44,837 --> 00:54:46,505
Because I love you.

600
00:55:02,271 --> 00:55:03,605
It's fine.

601
00:55:04,439 --> 00:55:06,441
Really? Why?

602
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:13,240
Something's wrong.

603
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:18,996
Tell me.

604
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:24,334
Are you leaving me?

605
00:55:28,755 --> 00:55:30,424
Because of this?

606
00:55:33,093 --> 00:55:34,261
Why?

607
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:37,681
Dan.

608
00:55:39,766 --> 00:55:41,059
Cupid?

609
00:55:42,895 --> 00:55:44,480
He's our joke.

610
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:46,815
I love him.

611
00:55:48,192 --> 00:55:50,152
You're seeing him now?

612
00:55:52,488 --> 00:55:54,114
Since when?

613
00:55:59,661 --> 00:56:02,498
Since my opening last year.

614
00:56:03,832 --> 00:56:05,417
I'm disgusting.

615
00:56:08,086 --> 00:56:09,671
You're phenomenal.

616
00:56:11,298 --> 00:56:12,966
You're so clever.

617
00:56:15,344 --> 00:56:17,137
Why did you marry me?

618
00:56:18,847 --> 00:56:21,308
I stopped seeing him. I wanted us to work.

619
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:24,394
- Why did you tell me you wanted children?
- Because I did.

620
00:56:24,478 --> 00:56:27,314
- And now you want children with him?
- Yes.

621
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:30,984
I don't know.

622
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:36,031
But we're happy...

623
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:38,575
aren't we?

624
00:56:43,872 --> 00:56:46,500
- You're gonna go live with him?
- You stay here if you want.

625
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:49,169
I don't give a fuck about the spoils.

626
00:56:50,587 --> 00:56:54,299
You did this to me the day we met.
You let me hang myself for your amusement.

627
00:56:54,383 --> 00:56:56,844
Why didn't you just tell me
when I walked in the door?

628
00:56:56,927 --> 00:57:00,097
- I was scared.
- You're a coward, you spoilt bitch.

629
00:57:02,224 --> 00:57:05,435
Are you dressed
because you thought I might hit you?

630
00:57:08,063 --> 00:57:09,648
What do you think I am?

631
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:12,109
- I've been hit before.
- Not by me.

632
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,530
Is he a good fuck?

633
00:57:18,073 --> 00:57:19,575
Don't do this.

634
00:57:20,075 --> 00:57:22,035
Just answer the question.

635
00:57:22,286 --> 00:57:23,954
Is he good?

636
00:57:24,288 --> 00:57:25,622
Yes.

637
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:29,710
Better than me?

638
00:57:30,085 --> 00:57:32,129
- Different.
- Better?

639
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,176
- Gentler.
- What does that mean?

640
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:40,137
- You know what it means.
- Tell me.

641
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,763
- No.
- I treat you like a whore?

642
00:57:41,847 --> 00:57:44,057
- Sometimes.
- Why would that be?

643
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,519
- I'm sorry, you're...
- Don't say it.

644
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:49,396
Don't you fucking say:

645
00:57:49,438 --> 00:57:52,232
"You're too good for me."
I am, but don't say it.

646
00:57:52,316 --> 00:57:54,985
You're making the mistake of your life.

647
00:57:56,778 --> 00:58:00,282
You're leaving me because you believe
that you don't deserve happiness...

648
00:58:00,365 --> 00:58:01,950
but you do, Anna.

649
00:58:04,912 --> 00:58:07,915
Did you have a bath
because you had sex with him?

650
00:58:08,665 --> 00:58:10,792
So you wouldn't smell of him?

651
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:14,379
So you'd feel less guilty?

652
00:58:15,547 --> 00:58:17,132
How do you feel?

653
00:58:17,799 --> 00:58:19,301
Guilty.

654
00:58:20,803 --> 00:58:22,638
Did you ever love me?

655
00:58:23,472 --> 00:58:24,640
Yes.

656
00:58:57,256 --> 00:58:59,091
Did you do it here?

657
00:59:01,385 --> 00:59:02,553
No.

658
00:59:03,011 --> 00:59:04,346
Why not?

659
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:08,559
Do you wish we did?

660
00:59:08,642 --> 00:59:10,435
Just tell me the truth.

661
00:59:12,354 --> 00:59:14,189
Yes, we did it here.

662
00:59:17,192 --> 00:59:18,318
Where?

663
00:59:23,365 --> 00:59:24,533
There.

664
00:59:27,077 --> 00:59:28,412
On this?

665
00:59:32,624 --> 00:59:34,918
We had our first fuck on this.

666
00:59:35,711 --> 00:59:37,421
Did you think of me?

667
00:59:40,257 --> 00:59:41,592
When?

668
00:59:44,678 --> 00:59:46,555
When did you do it here?

669
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:49,433
- Answer the question!
- This evening.

670
00:59:54,229 --> 00:59:55,689
Did you come?

671
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,944
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I want to know.

672
01:00:02,112 --> 01:00:04,364
- Yes, I came.
- How many times?

673
01:00:04,406 --> 01:00:06,283
- Twice.
- How?

674
01:00:06,825 --> 01:00:10,412
- First he went down on me, then we fucked.
- Who was where?

675
01:00:10,496 --> 01:00:13,415
I was on top,
then he fucked me from behind.

676
01:00:13,499 --> 01:00:16,376
- That's when you came the second time?
- God.

677
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:20,923
- Why is the sex so important?
- Because I'm a fucking caveman!

678
01:00:21,465 --> 01:00:23,550
Did you touch yourself
while he fucked you?

679
01:00:23,926 --> 01:00:25,469
- You wank for him?
- Sometimes.

680
01:00:25,552 --> 01:00:27,429
- And he does?
- We do everything...

681
01:00:27,471 --> 01:00:30,224
- that people who have sex do.
- You enjoy sucking him off?

682
01:00:30,265 --> 01:00:31,517
- You like his cock?
- I love it.

683
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,101
- Like him coming in your face?
- Yes!

684
01:00:33,185 --> 01:00:35,646
- What does it taste like?
- Like you, but sweeter.

685
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:39,191
That's the spirit. Thank you.
Thank you for your honesty.

686
01:00:39,274 --> 01:00:41,235
Now fuck off and die...

687
01:00:42,194 --> 01:00:44,071
you fucked-up slag.

688
01:02:07,446 --> 01:02:09,031
I love you.

689
01:02:10,866 --> 01:02:12,367
Thank you.

690
01:02:14,703 --> 01:02:18,207
- What's this room called?
- The Paradise Suite.

691
01:02:18,499 --> 01:02:21,418
- How many Paradise Suites are there?
- Eight.

692
01:02:27,216 --> 01:02:28,884
Do I have to pay you to talk to me?

693
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:31,887
No. But if you want to tip me,
you're welcome.

694
01:02:37,059 --> 01:02:38,352
Thank you.

695
01:02:39,478 --> 01:02:43,148
I used to come here a million years ago.
It was a punk club.

696
01:02:43,357 --> 01:02:45,234
The stage was...

697
01:02:48,529 --> 01:02:51,198
Everything is a version of something else.

698
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:53,116
Twenty years ago.

699
01:02:53,492 --> 01:02:54,868
How old were you?

700
01:02:54,952 --> 01:02:56,787
- Four.
- Christ.

701
01:02:56,995 --> 01:03:01,083
- When I was in flares, you were in nappies.
- My nappies were flared.

702
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:03,752
- You have the face of an angel.
- Thank you.

703
01:03:03,836 --> 01:03:06,046
What does your cunt taste like?

704
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,714
Heaven.

705
01:03:11,802 --> 01:03:13,387
How long have you been doing this?

706
01:03:13,428 --> 01:03:16,140
- Three months.
- Straight after he left you?

707
01:03:16,682 --> 01:03:18,392
No one left me.

708
01:03:20,144 --> 01:03:22,437
- Nice wig.
- Thank you.

709
01:03:23,397 --> 01:03:25,440
Does all this turn you on?

710
01:03:25,566 --> 01:03:26,859
- Sometimes.
- Liar.

711
01:03:26,942 --> 01:03:29,945
You're telling me that
'cause you think it's what I want to hear.

712
01:03:30,028 --> 01:03:31,947
You think I'm turned on
by it turning you on.

713
01:03:31,989 --> 01:03:36,285
The thought of me creaming myself when
I strip for strangers doesn't turn you on?

714
01:03:36,368 --> 01:03:38,370
Put like that, yes.

715
01:03:41,623 --> 01:03:44,251
- Are you flirting with me?
- Maybe.

716
01:03:45,294 --> 01:03:47,421
- Are you allowed to flirt with me?
- Sure.

717
01:03:47,504 --> 01:03:50,090
- Really?
- No, I'm not. I'm breaking all the rules.

718
01:03:50,132 --> 01:03:52,759
- You're mocking me.
- Yes, I'm allowed to flirt.

719
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:54,136
To prize my money from me.

720
01:03:54,178 --> 01:03:57,347
To prize your money from you,
I may do or say as I please.

721
01:03:57,431 --> 01:03:59,308
- Except touch.
- We're not allowed to touch.

722
01:03:59,349 --> 01:04:00,684
Open your legs.

723
01:04:01,477 --> 01:04:02,686
Wider.

724
01:04:13,113 --> 01:04:14,448
Show me.

725
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:21,914
So what would happen
if I touched you now?

726
01:04:21,997 --> 01:04:24,124
- I'd call security.
- What would they do?

727
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:26,752
They would ask you to leave
and not to come back.

728
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:29,296
- And if I refused to leave?
- They would remove you.

729
01:04:29,338 --> 01:04:32,090
Those are security cameras in the ceiling.

730
01:04:35,385 --> 01:04:38,138
I think it's best I don't attempt to touch you.

731
01:04:38,347 --> 01:04:41,600
I'd like to touch you. Later.

732
01:04:41,725 --> 01:04:44,144
- I'm not a whore.
- I wouldn't pay.

733
01:04:45,896 --> 01:04:48,190
Why the fuck did he leave you?

734
01:04:48,357 --> 01:04:51,068
- What's your job?
- A question. You asked me a question.

735
01:04:51,151 --> 01:04:52,861
- So?
- It's a chink in your armor.

736
01:04:52,945 --> 01:04:55,364
- I'm not wearing armor.
- Yes, you are.

737
01:04:55,447 --> 01:04:58,283
- Why are you calling yourself Jane?
- Because it's my name.

738
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,202
We both know it isn't.

739
01:05:01,537 --> 01:05:03,497
You're all protecting your identities.

740
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:07,209
There's a girl out there who calls
herself Venus. What's her real name?

741
01:05:07,292 --> 01:05:09,753
- Pluto.
- You're cheeky.

742
01:05:09,878 --> 01:05:12,756
- Would you like me to stop being cheeky?
- No.

743
01:05:13,674 --> 01:05:15,175
What's your name?

744
01:05:16,677 --> 01:05:17,803
Daniel.

745
01:05:19,096 --> 01:05:20,764
Daniel the dermatologist.

746
01:05:20,848 --> 01:05:23,183
- I never told you my job.
- I guessed.

747
01:05:23,517 --> 01:05:25,060
You're strong.

748
01:05:25,644 --> 01:05:29,231
There's another one out there.
Judging by the scars, a patient of Dr. Tit.

749
01:05:29,314 --> 01:05:32,025
Calls herself Cupid.
Who's gonna tell her he was a bloke?

750
01:05:32,067 --> 01:05:36,363
- He wasn't a bloke. He was a little boy.
- I want you to tell me your name.

751
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:42,870
Please.

752
01:05:44,204 --> 01:05:46,999
Thank you. My name is Jane.

753
01:05:47,749 --> 01:05:49,126
Your real name.

754
01:05:50,836 --> 01:05:52,171
Thank you.

755
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:55,549
- My real name is Jane.
- Careful.

756
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:01,889
Thank you. Still Jane.

757
01:06:02,097 --> 01:06:04,183
I've got about another £500 here.

758
01:06:04,266 --> 01:06:09,188
Why don't I just give you all this money
and you tell me what your real name is...

759
01:06:10,022 --> 01:06:11,231
Alice?

760
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,400
I promise.

761
01:06:14,818 --> 01:06:16,153
Thank you.

762
01:06:17,404 --> 01:06:18,989
My real name...

763
01:06:19,156 --> 01:06:21,867
is plain Jane Jones.

764
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,744
I may be rich, but I'm not stupid.

765
01:06:23,785 --> 01:06:26,079
What a shame, Doc.
I love them rich and stupid.

766
01:06:26,121 --> 01:06:28,290
Don't you fuck around with me.

767
01:06:28,373 --> 01:06:30,918
- I apologize.
- Accepted.

768
01:06:31,502 --> 01:06:34,963
All the girls in this hellhole,
the pneumatic robots...

769
01:06:35,005 --> 01:06:37,508
the coked-up baby dolls,
and you're no different.

770
01:06:37,633 --> 01:06:40,677
You all use stage names
to con yourselves you're someone else...

771
01:06:40,761 --> 01:06:44,223
so you don't feel ashamed showing
your cunts and assholes to strangers.

772
01:06:44,306 --> 01:06:45,766
I'm trying to have a conversation.

773
01:06:45,808 --> 01:06:47,684
- You're out of cash.
- I paid for this room.

774
01:06:47,768 --> 01:06:48,811
This is extra.

775
01:06:48,894 --> 01:06:50,437
- We met last year.
- Wrong girl.

776
01:06:50,521 --> 01:06:51,855
Talk to me!

777
01:06:52,481 --> 01:06:55,067
- I am.
- Talk to me in real life.

778
01:06:55,234 --> 01:06:58,654
I didn't know you'd be here.
I know who you are.

779
01:06:59,947 --> 01:07:01,323
I love you.

780
01:07:02,825 --> 01:07:05,369
I love everything about you that hurts.

781
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,342
She won't even see me.

782
01:07:21,677 --> 01:07:25,430
- You feel the same. I know it.
- You can't cry in here.

783
01:07:26,348 --> 01:07:29,768
- Hold me. Let me hold you.
- We're not allowed to touch.

784
01:07:30,853 --> 01:07:33,689
Come home with me. It's safe.
Let me look after you.

785
01:07:33,772 --> 01:07:36,483
- I don't need looking after.
- Everyone needs looking after.

786
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:38,527
I'm not your revenge fuck.

787
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:41,321
- I'll pay you.
- I don't need your money.

788
01:07:41,363 --> 01:07:42,656
- You have my money.
- Thank you.

789
01:07:42,698 --> 01:07:46,243
- "Thank you." Is that some kind of rule?
- Just being polite.

790
01:07:49,163 --> 01:07:51,999
Do you get a lot of grown men
crying their guts out here?

791
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,042
Occupational hazard.

792
01:07:54,126 --> 01:07:56,545
Have you ever desired a customer?

793
01:07:58,005 --> 01:07:59,256
Yes.

794
01:07:59,339 --> 01:08:01,508
Then put me out of my misery.
Do you desire me?

795
01:08:01,592 --> 01:08:04,178
Because I'm being pretty honest
about my feelings for you.

796
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:06,513
- Your feelings?
- Whatever.

797
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:08,724
No, I don't desire you.

798
01:08:10,017 --> 01:08:11,393
Thank you.

799
01:08:12,311 --> 01:08:15,063
Thank you sincerely for your honesty.

800
01:08:23,155 --> 01:08:25,699
You think you haven't give us
anything of yourselves?

801
01:08:25,782 --> 01:08:28,535
Do you think because you don't love us
or desire us...

802
01:08:28,577 --> 01:08:31,205
or even like us, you think you've won?

803
01:08:31,246 --> 01:08:32,748
It's not a war.

804
01:08:39,004 --> 01:08:41,298
If I asked you to strip right now, would you?

805
01:08:41,381 --> 01:08:44,051
- Of course. Do you want me to?
- No.

806
01:08:45,677 --> 01:08:48,722
Alice, tell me something true.

807
01:08:49,681 --> 01:08:53,769
Lying is the most fun a girl can have
without taking her clothes off...

808
01:08:54,353 --> 01:08:56,522
but it's better if you do.

809
01:08:58,273 --> 01:08:59,691
You're cold.

810
01:09:00,317 --> 01:09:02,361
You're all cold at heart.

811
01:09:04,154 --> 01:09:07,241
What do you have to do
to get a bit of intimacy around here?

812
01:09:07,282 --> 01:09:10,369
Maybe next time
I'll have worked on my intimacy.

813
01:09:10,786 --> 01:09:14,915
No, I'll tell you what's gonna work.
You're gonna take your gear off right now.

814
01:09:14,998 --> 01:09:19,461
You're gonna turn around very slowly,
and you're gonna bend over...

815
01:09:20,045 --> 01:09:24,299
and you're gonna touch the fucking floor
for my viewing pleasure.

816
01:09:25,175 --> 01:09:27,136
Is that what you want?

817
01:09:28,512 --> 01:09:30,430
What else could I want?

818
01:10:37,498 --> 01:10:38,832
I'm sorry.

819
01:10:41,168 --> 01:10:43,170
- What happened?
- Traffic.

820
01:10:45,255 --> 01:10:48,634
- Do you want to go stand in the back?
- No, let's have a drink.

821
01:10:52,596 --> 01:10:54,389
You look flushed.

822
01:10:55,516 --> 01:10:57,476
You have no need to run.

823
01:10:57,559 --> 01:10:59,061
- Vodka tonic?
- Yes.

824
01:10:59,144 --> 01:11:02,356
- Vodka tonic and a Guinness, please.
- Sure.

825
01:11:03,565 --> 01:11:05,025
How was it?

826
01:11:06,235 --> 01:11:07,361
Fine.

827
01:11:07,945 --> 01:11:09,404
You had lunch?

828
01:11:10,113 --> 01:11:11,406
Then what?

829
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,702
- And then we left.
- And?

830
01:11:16,578 --> 01:11:18,163
There's no "and."

831
01:11:20,666 --> 01:11:24,378
You haven't seen him in four months.
There must be an "and."

832
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:27,089
- How is he?
- Terrible.

833
01:11:35,848 --> 01:11:38,100
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

834
01:11:42,187 --> 01:11:44,189
How is his dermatology?

835
01:11:44,398 --> 01:11:48,152
- He's in private practice now.
- Is he?

836
01:11:50,737 --> 01:11:53,115
Was he weeping all over the place?

837
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,451
- Some of the time.
- Poor bastard.

838
01:11:57,119 --> 01:11:59,705
Was he difficult?

839
01:12:02,249 --> 01:12:04,418
Are you angry that I saw him?

840
01:12:04,543 --> 01:12:06,211
No. It's just...

841
01:12:07,588 --> 01:12:09,173
I haven't seen Alice.

842
01:12:09,256 --> 01:12:11,884
You can't see Alice.
You don't know where she is.

843
01:12:11,967 --> 01:12:14,094
I haven't tried to find her.

844
01:12:15,471 --> 01:12:16,847
You know why I saw him.

845
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:19,683
He's been begging me for months.
I saw him so he'd sign.

846
01:12:19,766 --> 01:12:21,977
- So has he signed?
- Yes.

847
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,983
Congratulations.

848
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:30,694
You're a divorcée.

849
01:12:32,196 --> 01:12:33,947
Double divorcée.

850
01:12:35,949 --> 01:12:37,242
Sorry.

851
01:12:38,285 --> 01:12:39,786
How do you feel?

852
01:12:40,996 --> 01:12:42,164
Tired.

853
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,711
I love you.

854
01:12:48,462 --> 01:12:50,172
And I need a piss.

855
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,669
I hate this place.

856
01:13:29,711 --> 01:13:31,088
At least it's central.

857
01:13:31,171 --> 01:13:34,216
I hate central.
Central London's a theme park.

858
01:13:35,217 --> 01:13:39,555
I hate retro. I hate the future.
Where does that leave me?

859
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:41,932
Come back.

860
01:13:42,724 --> 01:13:45,561
- You promised you wouldn't.
- Come back.

861
01:13:49,898 --> 01:13:52,943
- How's work?
- Jesus. Work's shit, okay?

862
01:14:01,618 --> 01:14:05,497
Do they have waiters here?
I love you. Please come back.

863
01:14:06,415 --> 01:14:08,125
I'm not coming back.

864
01:14:14,047 --> 01:14:15,132
Sign.

865
01:14:16,341 --> 01:14:17,593
No pen.

866
01:14:23,098 --> 01:14:24,183
Pen.

867
01:14:27,186 --> 01:14:28,979
Give me back my hand.

868
01:14:38,614 --> 01:14:39,698
Sign.

869
01:14:46,288 --> 01:14:48,373
I'll sign on one condition.

870
01:14:50,209 --> 01:14:53,420
We skip this.
We go to my sleek new surgery...

871
01:14:53,504 --> 01:14:56,673
and we christen the patients' bed
with our final fuck.

872
01:14:56,757 --> 01:14:58,634
I know you don't want to...

873
01:14:59,092 --> 01:15:03,096
and I know you think I'm sick for asking,
but that's what I'm asking.

874
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,890
For old times' sake.

875
01:15:05,682 --> 01:15:07,810
Because I'm obsessed with you.

876
01:15:08,519 --> 01:15:11,230
Because I can't get over you unless...

877
01:15:12,022 --> 01:15:13,857
Because I think, on some small level...

878
01:15:13,941 --> 01:15:17,236
you owe me something
for deceiving me so exquisitely.

879
01:15:18,153 --> 01:15:22,533
For all these reasons,
I am begging you to give me your body.

880
01:15:24,451 --> 01:15:26,203
You'd be my whore.

881
01:15:26,745 --> 01:15:29,623
And in return,
I will pay you with your liberty.

882
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:34,837
You do this,
I swear I will not contact you again.

883
01:15:40,008 --> 01:15:41,844
I'm going to the bar.

884
01:15:42,511 --> 01:15:44,972
I assume you still drink vodka tonic?

885
01:16:07,369 --> 01:16:09,580
You slept with him, didn't you?

886
01:16:36,064 --> 01:16:38,859
- What do you expect me to do?
- Understand.

887
01:16:40,152 --> 01:16:41,612
Why didn't you lie to me?

888
01:16:41,695 --> 01:16:44,281
Because we said
we'd always tell each other the truth.

889
01:16:44,364 --> 01:16:45,949
What's so great about the truth?

890
01:16:46,033 --> 01:16:49,328
Try lying for a change.
It's the currency of the world.

891
01:16:51,538 --> 01:16:56,210
I did what he wanted,
and now he will leave us alone.

892
01:16:59,296 --> 01:17:00,672
I love you.

893
01:17:01,882 --> 01:17:04,760
- I didn't give him anything.
- Your body?

894
01:17:06,553 --> 01:17:10,057
If Alice came to you, desperate...

895
01:17:10,516 --> 01:17:12,601
with all that love still between you...

896
01:17:12,684 --> 01:17:14,728
and she said she needed you to want her...

897
01:17:14,812 --> 01:17:16,897
so she could get over you, you'd do it.

898
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:19,983
I wouldn't like it either, but I'd forgive you.

899
01:17:20,275 --> 01:17:23,403
- It's kindness.
- No, cowardice.

900
01:17:23,612 --> 01:17:25,823
You haven't got the guts to let him hate you.

901
01:17:37,918 --> 01:17:41,630
I'm doing this because I feel guilty,
and because I pity you.

902
01:17:41,713 --> 01:17:44,633
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

903
01:17:45,467 --> 01:17:48,303
- Feel good about yourself?
- No.

904
01:17:58,689 --> 01:18:00,065
It's gone.

905
01:18:01,108 --> 01:18:05,237
- We're not innocent anymore.
- Don't stop loving me.

906
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,782
I can see it draining out of you.
It's me, remember?

907
01:18:09,575 --> 01:18:12,661
It was a stupid thing to do,
and it meant nothing.

908
01:18:13,078 --> 01:18:15,330
If you love me enough, you'll forgive me.

909
01:18:15,414 --> 01:18:17,833
- Are you testing me?
- No.

910
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:22,337
- I do understand.
- No. He understands.

911
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:27,759
All I can see is him all over you.

912
01:18:28,427 --> 01:18:31,847
He's clever, your ex-husband.

913
01:18:33,348 --> 01:18:34,850
I almost admire him.

914
01:18:38,812 --> 01:18:40,814
You going to tell him?

915
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:43,901
I don't know.

916
01:18:56,163 --> 01:18:59,291
Better to be truthful about this kind of thing.

917
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:07,799
Sign.

918
01:19:16,391 --> 01:19:17,851
I forgive you.

919
01:19:21,313 --> 01:19:22,648
Sign.

920
01:19:26,443 --> 01:19:28,362
<i>I think you enjoyed it.</i>

921
01:19:29,404 --> 01:19:32,908
He wheedles you into bed. The old jokes...

922
01:19:32,991 --> 01:19:36,954
the strange familiarity.
I think you had a whale of a time.

923
01:19:37,037 --> 01:19:39,373
And the truth is I'll never know
unless I ask him.

924
01:19:39,414 --> 01:19:40,958
Why don't you?

925
01:20:29,506 --> 01:20:30,591
Yes?

926
01:20:32,301 --> 01:20:34,094
You can go in now.

927
01:20:41,685 --> 01:20:44,605
- I want Anna back.
- She's made her choice.

928
01:20:44,646 --> 01:20:49,276
I owe you an apology. I fell in love with her.
My intention was not to make you suffer.

929
01:20:49,318 --> 01:20:52,404
So where's the apology? You cunt.

930
01:20:53,322 --> 01:20:56,325
I apologize.
If you love her, you'll let her go...

931
01:20:56,408 --> 01:20:58,035
so she can be happy.

932
01:20:58,118 --> 01:21:00,913
- She doesn't want to be happy.
- Everybody wants to be happy.

933
01:21:00,996 --> 01:21:04,374
Depressives don't. They want to be unhappy
to confirm they're depressed.

934
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:06,627
If they were happy,
they couldn't be depressed.

935
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:10,172
They'd have to go out into the world
and live, which can be depressing.

936
01:21:10,255 --> 01:21:12,716
- Anna's not a depressive.
- Isn't she?

937
01:21:12,799 --> 01:21:15,844
- I love her.
- Boo-hoo. So do I.

938
01:21:16,261 --> 01:21:19,056
She's gone back to you
because she can't bear your suffering.

939
01:21:19,139 --> 01:21:20,849
You don't know who she is.

940
01:21:20,933 --> 01:21:25,521
- You love her like a dog loves its owner.
- And the owner loves the dog for so doing.

941
01:21:25,604 --> 01:21:27,648
You'll hurt her. You'll never forgive her.

942
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:29,817
Of course I forgive her. I have forgiven her.

943
01:21:29,858 --> 01:21:33,153
Without forgiveness we're savages.
You're drowning.

944
01:21:33,195 --> 01:21:36,323
- You only met her because of me.
- Yeah. Thanks.

945
01:21:36,365 --> 01:21:38,534
It's a joke. Your marriage is a joke.

946
01:21:38,617 --> 01:21:42,120
Here's a good one. She never sent
the divorce papers to her lawyer.

947
01:21:42,204 --> 01:21:47,084
Now, to a towering romantic hero like you,
I don't doubt I am somewhat common.

948
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:49,461
But I am, nevertheless,
what she has chosen...

949
01:21:49,545 --> 01:21:52,297
and we must respect what the woman wants.

950
01:21:53,382 --> 01:21:56,760
If you go near her again, I swear...

951
01:21:57,719 --> 01:21:59,471
I will kill you.

952
01:22:03,809 --> 01:22:06,937
Okay. I have patients to see.

953
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,189
When she came here,
do you think she enjoyed it?

954
01:22:09,273 --> 01:22:11,900
I didn't do it to give her a nice time.

955
01:22:11,984 --> 01:22:14,153
I fucked her to fuck you up.

956
01:22:14,653 --> 01:22:18,240
A good fight is never clean.
And of course she enjoyed it.

957
01:22:18,323 --> 01:22:20,909
As you know, she loves a guilty fuck.

958
01:22:20,993 --> 01:22:23,662
- You're an animal.
- Yeah? What are you?

959
01:22:23,745 --> 01:22:26,832
You think love is simple.
You think the heart is like a diagram.

960
01:22:26,915 --> 01:22:30,544
Have you ever seen a human heart?
It looks like a fist wrapped in blood!

961
01:22:30,586 --> 01:22:33,630
Go fuck yourself. You writer!

962
01:22:34,047 --> 01:22:35,424
You liar!

963
01:22:35,465 --> 01:22:37,926
You go check a few facts
while I get my hands dirty.

964
01:22:37,968 --> 01:22:40,554
She hates your hands.
She hates your simplicity.

965
01:22:40,637 --> 01:22:43,015
I spent the whole of last week
talking about you.

966
01:22:43,098 --> 01:22:46,477
I know all your ways. Anna says
you fucked her with your eyes closed.

967
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,772
She tells me you wake in the night
crying for your mother, you mommy's boy.

968
01:22:50,856 --> 01:22:52,399
I could go on.

969
01:22:54,526 --> 01:22:56,236
Shall we stop this?

970
01:23:01,909 --> 01:23:04,912
It's over. Accept it.

971
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:12,961
You don't know the first thing about love...

972
01:23:13,378 --> 01:23:16,006
because you don't understand compromise.

973
01:23:24,723 --> 01:23:27,476
- Don't cry on me.
- I'm sorry.

974
01:23:30,312 --> 01:23:32,356
I don't know what to do.

975
01:23:33,023 --> 01:23:36,193
You want my advice? You go back to Alice.

976
01:23:39,238 --> 01:23:40,948
She'd never have me.

977
01:23:42,825 --> 01:23:45,410
- She's vanished.
- No, she hasn't.

978
01:23:45,661 --> 01:23:47,663
I found her, by accident.

979
01:23:48,121 --> 01:23:50,290
She's working in a club.

980
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,794
Yes, I saw her naked.

981
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:56,630
No, I did not fuck her.

982
01:23:57,631 --> 01:23:59,299
You spoke to her?

983
01:24:04,138 --> 01:24:06,348
Yes, I know. One minute.

984
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:09,309
How is she?

985
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:11,478
She loves you...

986
01:24:12,187 --> 01:24:14,189
beyond comprehension.

987
01:24:15,524 --> 01:24:17,234
Your prescription.

988
01:24:18,402 --> 01:24:20,279
It's where she works.

989
01:24:22,823 --> 01:24:24,199
Go to her.

990
01:24:25,576 --> 01:24:26,910
Thank you.

991
01:24:30,706 --> 01:24:33,167
You still pissing about on the Net?

992
01:24:34,501 --> 01:24:35,961
Not recently.

993
01:24:36,378 --> 01:24:39,882
- I wanted to kill you.
- I thought you wanted to fuck me.

994
01:24:40,132 --> 01:24:41,717
Don't get lippy.

995
01:24:43,635 --> 01:24:45,846
I liked your book, by the way.

996
01:24:46,138 --> 01:24:49,224
Thanks. You stand alone.

997
01:24:49,433 --> 01:24:50,934
With Anna.

998
01:24:52,144 --> 01:24:56,899
- You still writing obituaries? Busy?
- I was made editor.

999
01:24:57,149 --> 01:25:00,068
- Yeah? How come?
- Previous editor died.

1000
01:25:03,739 --> 01:25:07,618
Alcohol poisoning.
I sat with him for a week in the hospital.

1001
01:25:09,912 --> 01:25:12,372
I really do have patients to see.

1002
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:16,919
- Thank you.
- For what?

1003
01:25:18,253 --> 01:25:20,714
- Being kind.
- I am kind.

1004
01:25:21,173 --> 01:25:23,300
Your invoice is in the post.

1005
01:25:37,105 --> 01:25:38,607
I lied to you.

1006
01:25:39,983 --> 01:25:41,652
I did fuck Alice.

1007
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:48,283
Sorry for telling you.
I'm just not big enough to forgive you.

1008
01:25:50,702 --> 01:25:52,037
Buster.

1009
01:26:23,068 --> 01:26:24,862
Show me the sneer.

1010
01:26:27,906 --> 01:26:29,533
Beautiful.

1011
01:26:29,616 --> 01:26:31,451
You'll wake up the hotel.

1012
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:39,501
Fuck me.

1013
01:26:40,752 --> 01:26:43,046
Again? We have to get up at 6:00.

1014
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:46,466
How can one man
be so endlessly disappointing?

1015
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:48,010
That's my charm.

1016
01:26:49,219 --> 01:26:51,930
So where are we going?

1017
01:26:52,681 --> 01:26:54,099
- My treat.
- Where are we going?

1018
01:26:54,183 --> 01:26:56,768
My holiday surprise. My rules.

1019
01:26:56,977 --> 01:26:59,146
Where are we going?

1020
01:27:00,397 --> 01:27:02,816
New York.

1021
01:27:05,027 --> 01:27:06,570
You angel.

1022
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:12,201
- You did remember to pack my passport?
- Of course. It's with my passport.

1023
01:27:12,242 --> 01:27:13,494
And where's that?

1024
01:27:13,577 --> 01:27:17,539
In a place where you can't look.
No one sees my passport picture.

1025
01:27:22,669 --> 01:27:26,465
When we get on the plane,
we'll have been together four years.

1026
01:27:27,216 --> 01:27:28,801
What about the gap?

1027
01:27:28,884 --> 01:27:32,054
You mean trial separation? Didn't work out.

1028
01:27:32,387 --> 01:27:34,097
Happy anniversary.

1029
01:27:39,645 --> 01:27:41,814
I'm going to take my eyes out.

1030
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:47,194
- What was in my sandwiches?
- Tuna.

1031
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:51,031
- How many stitches did I get?
- Two.

1032
01:27:51,073 --> 01:27:53,200
But you should have had three.

1033
01:27:54,493 --> 01:27:57,246
- What was your euphemism?
- Disarming.

1034
01:27:57,746 --> 01:28:00,290
Too easy, buster. Next?

1035
01:28:00,749 --> 01:28:03,627
That park. Who'd I go there with?

1036
01:28:05,087 --> 01:28:06,588
Your father.

1037
01:28:07,798 --> 01:28:10,759
Were the chairs in the hospital gray or blue?

1038
01:28:11,385 --> 01:28:13,846
- No idea.
- Trick question. They were green.

1039
01:28:13,929 --> 01:28:16,223
You are a trick question.

1040
01:28:22,354 --> 01:28:24,815
How come we never took a vacation?

1041
01:28:25,607 --> 01:28:27,067
We went to the country.

1042
01:28:27,109 --> 01:28:31,071
Doesn't count. You were off
making sneaky phone calls...

1043
01:28:31,446 --> 01:28:33,740
to that witch we do not mention.

1044
01:28:38,871 --> 01:28:40,247
Come to bed.

1045
01:28:40,289 --> 01:28:41,832
I need a smoke.

1046
01:28:44,168 --> 01:28:47,462
- How'd you manage to give up?
- Deep inner strength.

1047
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,475
Why me?

1048
01:29:01,059 --> 01:29:03,770
You could have chosen anyone. Why me?

1049
01:29:04,897 --> 01:29:07,107
Because you cut off your crusts.

1050
01:29:10,402 --> 01:29:11,653
And this.

1051
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:18,202
- When are you going to stop stripping?
- Soon.

1052
01:29:18,494 --> 01:29:21,246
- You're addicted to it.
- No, I'm not.

1053
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,956
It paid for this.

1054
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:26,960
Tell me what happened.

1055
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:32,007
- Nothing happened.
- But he came to the club.

1056
01:29:32,591 --> 01:29:35,677
Lots of men come to the club.
You came to the club.

1057
01:29:49,441 --> 01:29:52,569
<i>- The look on your face.
- The look on your face.</i>

1058
01:29:54,321 --> 01:29:56,865
<i>What a face. What a wig.</i>

1059
01:30:02,621 --> 01:30:04,748
I saw this face...

1060
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:09,002
this vision...

1061
01:30:09,878 --> 01:30:13,799
when you stepped into the road.
It was the moment of my life.

1062
01:30:15,217 --> 01:30:18,512
- This is the moment of your life.
- You were perfect.

1063
01:30:18,804 --> 01:30:20,305
I still am.

1064
01:30:21,515 --> 01:30:23,475
On the way to the hospital...

1065
01:30:23,809 --> 01:30:25,686
<i>I kissed your forehead.</i>

1066
01:30:26,228 --> 01:30:27,521
<i>You brute.</i>

1067
01:30:27,604 --> 01:30:30,691
<i>The cabbie saw me kissing you.
He said, "Is she yours?"</i>

1068
01:30:30,732 --> 01:30:32,734
<i>I said, "Yes, she's mine."</i>

1069
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:36,071
She's mine.

1070
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:49,042
So he came to the club, watched you strip,
you had a little chat, and that was it?

1071
01:30:51,336 --> 01:30:52,504
Yes.

1072
01:30:57,176 --> 01:30:59,052
You're not trusting me.

1073
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:02,556
I'm in love with you. You're safe.

1074
01:31:03,432 --> 01:31:05,809
You had every right. I just want to know.

1075
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:08,645
- Why?
- Because I want to know everything.

1076
01:31:10,147 --> 01:31:11,982
Because I'm a lunatic.

1077
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:14,818
Tell me.

1078
01:31:16,945 --> 01:31:18,780
Nothing happened.

1079
01:31:20,282 --> 01:31:23,243
- You were living with someone else.
- What are you justifying?

1080
01:31:23,285 --> 01:31:25,120
I'm not justifying anything. Just saying.

1081
01:31:25,204 --> 01:31:27,331
- What are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

1082
01:31:27,414 --> 01:31:29,291
I just want the truth.

1083
01:31:30,667 --> 01:31:33,253
- Where are you going?
- Cigarettes.

1084
01:31:34,796 --> 01:31:36,131
Everywhere's closed.

1085
01:31:36,215 --> 01:31:38,884
I'll go to the terminal.

1086
01:31:39,676 --> 01:31:41,428
When I get back...

1087
01:31:41,637 --> 01:31:43,597
please tell me the truth.

1088
01:31:45,808 --> 01:31:48,727
- Why?
- Because I'm addicted to it.

1089
01:31:49,144 --> 01:31:52,815
Because without it we're animals.

1090
01:31:54,149 --> 01:31:55,526
Trust me.

1091
01:33:02,092 --> 01:33:04,136
I don't love you anymore.

1092
01:33:04,928 --> 01:33:06,221
Since when?

1093
01:33:06,305 --> 01:33:07,473
Now.

1094
01:33:08,265 --> 01:33:09,558
Just now.

1095
01:33:10,642 --> 01:33:12,561
I don't want to lie...

1096
01:33:13,228 --> 01:33:15,522
and I can't tell the truth...

1097
01:33:15,981 --> 01:33:17,399
so it's over.

1098
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:19,526
It doesn't matter.

1099
01:33:19,776 --> 01:33:23,572
- I love you. None of it matters.
- Too late.

1100
01:33:26,074 --> 01:33:28,076
I don't love you anymore.

1101
01:33:29,661 --> 01:33:30,871
Goodbye.

1102
01:33:36,084 --> 01:33:37,878
Here's the truth...

1103
01:33:38,754 --> 01:33:40,839
so now you can hate me.

1104
01:33:43,258 --> 01:33:45,552
Larry fucked me all night.

1105
01:33:47,095 --> 01:33:48,722
I enjoyed it.

1106
01:33:49,765 --> 01:33:51,058
I came.

1107
01:33:54,436 --> 01:33:55,896
I prefer you.

1108
01:33:58,440 --> 01:33:59,733
Now go.

1109
01:34:02,611 --> 01:34:04,029
I knew that.

1110
01:34:04,947 --> 01:34:06,448
He told me.

1111
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:10,202
- You knew?
- I needed to hear it from you.

1112
01:34:10,619 --> 01:34:13,413
- Why?
- Because he might have been lying.

1113
01:34:13,789 --> 01:34:15,165
I had to hear it from you.

1114
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:18,418
I would never have told you,
because I know you'd never forgive me.

1115
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,087
I would. I have.

1116
01:34:20,963 --> 01:34:23,423
- Why did he tell you?
- Because he's a bastard.

1117
01:34:23,507 --> 01:34:25,926
- How could he?
- Because he wanted this to happen.

1118
01:34:25,968 --> 01:34:28,637
- But why test me?
- Because I'm an idiot.

1119
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,847
Yes.

1120
01:34:30,806 --> 01:34:32,808
I would have loved you...

1121
01:34:33,809 --> 01:34:35,227
forever.

1122
01:34:37,062 --> 01:34:39,690
- Now please go.
- Don't do this. Talk to me.

1123
01:34:39,773 --> 01:34:41,650
I am talking. Fuck off.

1124
01:34:41,733 --> 01:34:44,236
No, I'm sorry. You misunderstand.
I didn't mean to...

1125
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:45,279
Yes, you did.

1126
01:34:45,362 --> 01:34:46,905
- I love you.
- Where?

1127
01:34:46,989 --> 01:34:48,699
- What?
- Show me.

1128
01:34:49,408 --> 01:34:51,118
Where is this love?

1129
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:56,331
I can't see it. I can't touch it. I can't feel it.

1130
01:34:57,207 --> 01:35:00,294
I can hear it. I can hear some words...

1131
01:35:00,377 --> 01:35:03,380
but I can't do anything
with your easy words.

1132
01:35:03,881 --> 01:35:06,341
Whatever you say, it's too late.

1133
01:35:06,383 --> 01:35:09,470
- Please don't do this.
- It's done.

1134
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:14,057
Now please go, or I'll call security.

1135
01:35:14,558 --> 01:35:17,311
You're not in a strip club.
There is no security.

1136
01:35:20,814 --> 01:35:22,566
- Why did you fuck him?
- I wanted to.

1137
01:35:22,649 --> 01:35:24,109
- Why?
- I desired him.

1138
01:35:24,193 --> 01:35:26,195
- Why?
- You weren't there.

1139
01:35:26,361 --> 01:35:28,989
- Why him?
- He asked me nicely.

1140
01:35:29,072 --> 01:35:30,365
- You're a liar.
- So?

1141
01:35:30,449 --> 01:35:32,868
- Who are you?
- I'm no one.

1142
01:35:35,621 --> 01:35:38,957
Go on, hit me. That's what you want.
Hit me, fucker.

1143
01:37:00,164 --> 01:37:02,749
- Welcome back, Miss Jones.
- Thank you.
