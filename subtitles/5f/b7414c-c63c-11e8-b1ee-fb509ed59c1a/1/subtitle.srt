1
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:14,533
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

2
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,617
You did it. You did it!

3
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:27,253
To continue, you've listened to a long and
complex case, murder in the first degree.

4
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:32,384
Premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

5
00:01:32,473 --> 00:01:37,181
You've listened to the testimony, had the
law interpreted as it applies in this case.

6
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:41,978
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

7
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:46,312
One man is dead.
Another man's life is at stake.

8
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:50,447
If there's a reasonable doubt in your
minds as to the guilt of the accused -

9
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:55,359
a reasonable doubt-then you must
bring me a verdict of not guilty.

10
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:59,498
If there's no reasonable doubt,
then you must, in good conscience,

11
00:01:59,582 --> 00:02:02,499
find the accused guilty.

12
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:06,452
However you decide,
your verdict must be unanimous.

13
00:02:06,547 --> 00:02:09,998
In the event that
you find the accused guilty,

14
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:13,377
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

15
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,721
The death sentence is mandatory
in this case.

16
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,345
You are faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

17
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:25,931
The alternate jurors are excused.

18
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:32,936
The jury will now retire.

19
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,166
- Wanna piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

20
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,073
This thing isn't movin'.

21
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,503
- I'll give you a hand.
- That's it.

22
00:05:10,264 --> 00:05:13,632
You know somethin'? I called
the Weather Bureau this morning.

23
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:16,726
This is gonna be
the hottest day of the year.

24
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:19,480
You'd think they'd air-condition this place.

25
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:22,813
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's... that one. Yeah.

26
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,064
Thank you very much.
OK, gentlemen. Everybody's here.

27
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:32,314
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door. Just knock.

28
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:47,672
Good morning.
I never knew they locked the door.

29
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:50,793
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

30
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,005
I don't know. It just never occurred to me.

31
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:58,797
- What's that for?
- I thought we might wanna vote by ballot.

32
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:03,056
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

33
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:12,734
- How'd you like it?
- I don't know. It was pretty interesting.

34
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:17,568
- Yeah? I almost fell asleep.
- I mean, I've never been on a jury before.

35
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,234
No? I've sat on many juries.

36
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:26,747
Those lawyers talk and talk, even when
it's an open-and-shut case like this one.

37
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:30,419
- Ever hear so much talk about nothin'?
- I guess they're entitled.

38
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:33,755
They're entitled. It's the system, but...

39
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:38,469
if you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids
down before they start any trouble.

40
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:42,090
It saves a lot of time and money.
Let's get started.

41
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:44,854
Yeah. We've probably all
got things to do here.

42
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,885
We can start with a five-minute break.
One gentleman is in the bathroom.

43
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:51,058
Are... we gonna sit in order?

44
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:53,855
Gee, I don't know. I guess so.

45
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:01,149
- Buddy, you're in my seat.
- Oh, excuse me.

46
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:03,319
That's all right.

47
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,284
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

48
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:14,664
What did you think of the case?
I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.

49
00:07:14,756 --> 00:07:18,588
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

50
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:23,303
We were lucky to get a murder case.
I figured us for an assault or burglary.

51
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,095
Boy, they can be the dullest!

52
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:32,427
- Hey, is that the Woolworth Building?
- That's right.

53
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:36,473
Isn't that funny? I've lived here all my life.
I've never been inside it.

54
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:40,613
If you had to sort out all that junk,
like that thing with the movies.

55
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:43,699
Yeah. What about
that business with the knife?

56
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:46,820
Asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz.

57
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:49,664
You expect that.
You know what we're dealing with.

58
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:51,408
Yeah, I guess so.

59
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,001
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.

60
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:59,085
- You got a cold?
- And how. Hot-weather colds can kill you.

61
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,629
I can hardly touch my nose.
Know what I mean?

62
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:04,422
Sure do. I just got over one.

63
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:09,841
- Oh, come on! Mr Foreman, let's go.
- The guy's still in the bathroom.

64
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:13,766
What's new? I didn't get a chance
to see a paper this morning.

65
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:16,262
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

66
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:20,852
- You got a seat on the exchange?
- I'm a broker.

67
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:23,021
I run a messenger service.

68
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:25,439
The Beck and Call Company.

69
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:27,774
The name is my wife's idea.

70
00:08:27,868 --> 00:08:31,402
Got 37 men workin'. Started with nothin'.

71
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:34,201
OK, men. Let's take our seats, huh?

72
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:43,078
We can all get out of here pretty quick.
I have tickets to that ball game tonight.

73
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:46,957
Yanks and Cleveland. We've got
this kid Modjelewski in there.

74
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:49,341
He's a real bull, this kid. You know...

75
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,762
Real jug-handled. You know?

76
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:59,427
You're a real baseball fan, aren't ya?
Where do we sit here?

77
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:02,558
I thought we'd sit in order,
by jury numbers.

78
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,351
One, two, three and so on around the
table, if that's OK with you gentlemen.

79
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,530
- What's the difference?
- It's reasonable to sit in order.

80
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:16,282
- Let it be.
- That's twelve. We go around one, two...

81
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:20,451
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

82
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:23,330
- I beg pardon?
- I thought he was really sharp,

83
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:27,288
the way he handled all those points
one by one, in logical sequence.

84
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:32,258
- I was very impressed.
- I think he... he did an expert job.

85
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:35,548
A lot of drive, too. You know? Real drive.

86
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,092
OK, fellas. Can we
hold it down a minute? Fellas?

87
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:41,344
Say, we'd like to get started.

88
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:44,308
Gentleman at the window.

89
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,565
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

90
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:52,693
- The kid kills his father, just like that.
- Listen, it happens all the time.

91
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:55,071
They let those kids run wild up there.

92
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,113
Well, maybe it serves him right.
You know what I mean?

93
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:01,157
- Is everyone here?
- The old man is inside.

94
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:04,000
- Would you knock on the door for him?
- Yeah.

95
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:08,288
- Are you a Yankee fan?
- No, Baltimore.

96
00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:10,748
Baltimore?

97
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:15,510
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.

98
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:19,378
Who have they got? Who have they got
besides good groundkeepers?

99
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:22,677
- Say, we'd like to get started.
- Forgive me, gentlemen.

100
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:26,469
- I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
- Baltimore?

101
00:10:26,814 --> 00:10:32,603
OK, if I can have your attention. You fellas
can handle this thing any way you want.

102
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:35,446
I'm... you know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.

103
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:41,485
We can, well, discuss it first, then vote
on it. That's, of course... that's one way.

104
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:44,329
And, well, we can vote on it right now.

105
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:47,166
I think it's customary
to take a preliminary vote.

106
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,082
Yeah, let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we can all get outta here.

107
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:58,799
OK. Then I think that you know that we
have a first-degree murder charge here,

108
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:04,011
and if we vote the accused guilty,
we've got to send him to the chair.

109
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:06,721
Um... That's mandatory.

110
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,846
- I think we know that.
- Yeah, let's see who's where.

111
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:13,639
- OK. Anyone doesn't wanna vote?
- It's fine with me.

112
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:20,234
OK, then, just remember that this
has to be twelve to nothing, either way.

113
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:23,359
That's the law. OK, are we ready?

114
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:26,987
All those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

115
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:34,246
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

116
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,578
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

117
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:40,164
OK, that's eleven guilty.

118
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:42,794
Those voting not guilty?

119
00:11:43,262 --> 00:11:45,468
One. Right.

120
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:50,347
Eleven guilty, one not guilty.
Well, now we know where we are.

121
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:53,602
Boy, oh boy! There's always one.

122
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,644
So, what do we do now?

123
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:00,818
- I guess we talk.
- Boy, oh boy!

124
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:03,821
You really think he's innocent?

125
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,701
- I don't know.
- You sat in court with the rest of us.

126
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:12,954
You heard what we did.
The kid's a dangerous killer.

127
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,490
- He's 18 years old.
- Well, that's old enough.

128
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:19,456
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

129
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:22,215
They proved it
a dozen different ways in court.

130
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:25,834
- Would you like me to list 'em for you?
- No.

131
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:29,136
- Then what do you want?
- I just want to talk.

132
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:32,388
What's there to talk about?
Eleven of us think he's guilty.

133
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:34,801
No one had to think about it twice
except you.

134
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:38,061
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

135
00:12:38,147 --> 00:12:42,442
- I don't know. Maybe I don't.
- So how come you voted not guilty?

136
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:44,400
There were eleven votes for guilty.

137
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:49,563
It's not easy to raise my hand and send a
boy off to die without talking about it first.

138
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:53,193
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

139
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:58,079
What? Just because I voted fast?
I honestly think the guy is guilty.

140
00:12:58,165 --> 00:13:00,835
Couldn't change my mind
if you talked for 100 years.

141
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,623
I'm not trying to change your mind.
It's just that...

142
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:06,832
This is somebody's life.
We can't decide in five minutes.

143
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:11,337
- Supposing we're wrong?
- Supposing this building fell on my head?

144
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:14,299
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

145
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:19,431
What's the difference how long it takes?
Supposin' we take five minutes? So what?

146
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,431
Let's take an hour. The ball game
doesn't start till eight o'clock.

147
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:32,612
- Who's got something to say?
- /'m willing to sit for an hour.

148
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:38,037
- Great. I heard a good story last night...
- That's not why we're sitting here.

149
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:42,285
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

150
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,745
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

151
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:49,288
Look, this kid's been
kicked around all of his life.

152
00:13:49,382 --> 00:13:53,166
You know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

153
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,632
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage

154
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:58,675
when his father was serving
a jail term for forgery.

155
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:01,090
That's not a very happy beginning.

156
00:14:01,184 --> 00:14:04,849
He's a wild, angry kid. That's all
he's ever been. And you know why?

157
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:08,806
Cos he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day, every day.

158
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:14,191
He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.
I think we owe him a few words, that's all.

159
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,025
I don't mind telling you this, mister. We
don't owe him a thing. He got a fair trial.

160
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:23,662
What do you think that trial cost?
He's lucky he got it. Know what I mean?

161
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:28,041
Look, we're all grown-ups in here.
We heard the facts, didn't we?

162
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:32,456
You're not gonna tell me we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

163
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:34,789
I've lived among them all my life.

164
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:40,174
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that. I mean, they're born liars.

165
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:43,513
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now, listen...

166
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,470
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

167
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,348
Certain things should be
pointed out to this man.

168
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:54,515
- It's not Sunday. We don't need a sermon.
- We have a job to do. Now let's do it.

169
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,394
Rice Pops. It's a product
I work on at the agency.

170
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:01,026
"The breakfast with the built-in bounce."

171
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:03,488
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

172
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:08,239
- Say, do you mind?
- I'm sorry. I have this habit of doodling.

173
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:11,286
- It keeps me thinking clearly.
- We have work to do.

174
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:14,460
There's no point
staying here for ever. OK.

175
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:21,174
Perhaps if the gentleman down there who
is disagreeing with us could tell us why.

176
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:25,305
Tell us what you're thinking. We might be
able to show you where you're mixed up.

177
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:32,103
Maybe this is an idea. It seems to me that
it's up to us to convince this gentleman

178
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:37,811
that he's wrong and we're right. Maybe if
we each took a couple of minutes just to...

179
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:41,768
- Well, it was just a quick idea.
- No, no, no. That's a good one.

180
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:43,902
Supposing we go once around the table?

181
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:46,108
I guess you're first.

182
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:52,528
It's hard to put into words.

183
00:15:53,374 --> 00:15:55,664
I just think he's guilty.

184
00:15:55,753 --> 00:15:59,535
I thought it was obvious from the word go.
Nobody proved otherwise.

185
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,628
Nobody has to prove otherwise.
The burden of proof's on the prosecution.

186
00:16:03,718 --> 00:16:07,965
The defendant doesn't even have to open
his mouth. That's in the Constitution.

187
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:12,302
Sure, I know that. What I meant was...

188
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,760
Well... I just think he's guilty.
I mean, somebody saw him do it.

189
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:22,098
OK. Here's what I think. And I have
no personal feelings about this.

190
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:25,230
I just wanna talk about facts.

191
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:27,729
Number one.

192
00:16:27,824 --> 00:16:32,035
The old man lived downstairs under
the room where the killing took place.

193
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,820
At 10 minutes after 12 on the night
of the killing, he heard loud noises.

194
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:37,991
Said it sounded like a fight.

195
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:40,871
And he heard the kid yell out
"I'm gonna kill ya."

196
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:43,286
A second later,
he heard a body hit the floor.

197
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,793
Ran to the door, opened it up, saw the kid
run down the stairs and out of the house.

198
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:51,799
Called the police. They found the old man
with the knife in his chest.

199
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:55,139
The coroner fixed the time of death
around midnight.

200
00:16:55,226 --> 00:17:00,563
Now, these are facts.
You can't refute facts. The kid is guilty.

201
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,932
I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.
I know he's only 18.

202
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:08,188
- But he's still gotta pay for what he did.
- I'm with you.

203
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,146
- OK. Are you finished?
- Yeah.

204
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,740
It is obvious to me that
the boy's entire story was flimsy.

205
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,736
He claimed he was at the movies,

206
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,780
yet he couldn't remember the names
of the films he saw or who played in them.

207
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:24,662
- That's right.
- And no one saw him at the theatre.

208
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:29,130
And the woman across the street-if her
testimony don't prove it, nothing does.

209
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:33,676
- That's right. She actually saw the killing.
- Fellas, please. Let's go in order.

210
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,838
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

211
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:41,759
Here's a woman who's lying in bed.
She can't sleep. She's dyin' with the heat.

212
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,937
She looks out the window,
and right across the street

213
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,640
she sees the kid stick the knife
into his father.

214
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,855
The time is 12.10 on the nose.
Everything fits.

215
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,235
She's known the kid all his life.

216
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:58,189
His window is opposite hers across the
el tracks. She swore she saw him do it.

217
00:17:58,284 --> 00:18:00,858
Through the windows
of a passing el train.

218
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:05,201
This el train had no passengers on it.
It was just being moved downtown.

219
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,626
The lights were out,
and they proved in court that at night

220
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,543
you can look through the windows and
see what's happening on the other side.

221
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:15,798
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

222
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:18,803
You don't believe the boy.
How come you believe the woman?

223
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:22,138
She's one of "them" too, isn't she?

224
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:27,181
- You're a pretty smart fella, aren't ya?
- OK, gentlemen. Now, gentlemen.

225
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:31,564
- Come on, sit down. Sit down.
- What's he so wise about? I'm telling ya...

226
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,936
Come on. Now we're not gonna
get anywhere fighting.

227
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:39,275
- Whose turn is it next?
- Oh, his. Number five.

228
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:45,109
May I... Can I pass?

229
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:48,075
Well... That's your privilege.

230
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:50,408
How about the next gentleman?

231
00:18:50,502 --> 00:18:53,075
Oh. Well... I don't know.

232
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:57,831
I started to be convinced,
you know, very early in the case.

233
00:18:57,924 --> 00:19:01,128
You see, I was looking for a motive.

234
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,760
That's very important because if you don't
have a motive, where's your case, right?

235
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:12,603
Anyway, that testimony from those people
across the hall from the kid's apartment,

236
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:18,110
that was very powerful. Didn't they say
something about a fight, an argument,

237
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:22,488
between the old man and his son
around about seven o'clock that night?

238
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:25,907
- I could be wrong but...
- It was eight o'clock, not seven.

239
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:31,783
They heard an argument. Then
they heard the father hit the boy twice.

240
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:36,121
Finally they saw the boy run, angry,
out of the house. What does that prove?

241
00:19:36,212 --> 00:19:39,212
It don't prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

242
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:42,464
You said it provided a motive.
So did the prosecution.

243
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:44,673
That wasn't a very strong motive.

244
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:48,676
This boy has been hit so many times
that violence is practically...

245
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:51,091
It's a normal state of affairs with him.

246
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:55,430
I just can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

247
00:19:55,521 --> 00:20:00,064
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

248
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,649
Anything else?

249
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:07,107
- No.
- OK. How about you?

250
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:13,117
I don't know. It's all been said.

251
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:16,656
You can talk here for ever.
It's still the same thing.

252
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:21,918
This kid is five for 0.
Well, look at his record.

253
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:26,298
When he was 10, he was in children's
court: He threw a rock at a teacher.

254
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:30,464
When he was 15, he was
in reform school: He stole a car.

255
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:35,382
He's been arrested for muggin'.
He was picked up twice for knife fightin'.

256
00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:40,185
They say he's real handy with a knife.
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

257
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:44,815
Ever since he was five, his father
beat him up regularly. He used his fists.

258
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:47,393
So would I. A kid like that?

259
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:50,821
It's these kids -
the way they are nowadays.

260
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:56,777
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "sir".

261
00:20:56,871 --> 00:21:00,038
That's right. Ever hear a kid
call his father that any more?

262
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:03,493
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important any more.

263
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:05,994
- You got any kids?
- Three.

264
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:09,123
I got one.

265
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,127
He's 22 years old.

266
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:22,269
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

267
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:27,145
I saw it. I was so embarrassed,
I almost threw up.

268
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:32,690
I said "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two tryin'."

269
00:21:34,282 --> 00:21:36,987
Well, I made a man out of him.

270
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:39,781
When he was 16, we had a fight.

271
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,158
Hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.

272
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:49,665
I haven't seen him for two years.

273
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:54,167
Kids.

274
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:56,669
You work your heart out...

275
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,716
- Well, let's get goin'.
- I think we're missing the point.

276
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:06,474
This boy's the product of a broken home
and a filthy neighbourhood.

277
00:22:06,563 --> 00:22:10,061
We can't help that. We're here
to decide his innocence or guilt,

278
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:13,103
not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

279
00:22:13,194 --> 00:22:17,737
He was born in a slum.
Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.

280
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:23,279
It's no secret that children from slums
are potential menaces to society. I think...

281
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,582
You can say that again. The kids who
crawl out of these places are real trash.

282
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:33,087
- I don't want any part of them.
- Listen, I... I've lived in a slum all my life.

283
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:34,998
- Wait a minute.
- Please. I...

284
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,043
I've played in back yards
that were filled with garbage.

285
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:40,921
- Maybe you can still smell it on me.
- Listen, sonny...

286
00:22:41,012 --> 00:22:43,384
Come on, now. There's nothing personal.

287
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:47,056
Come on, fella. He didn't mean you.
Let's not be so sensitive.

288
00:22:47,143 --> 00:22:49,848
This sensitivity I can understand.

289
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:54,765
OK, look. Let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time.

290
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:57,349
Your turn down there. Let's go.

291
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:02,360
I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna to try to convince me.

292
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,656
- That was the idea.
- I forgot. He's right.

293
00:23:04,743 --> 00:23:08,075
He's the one keeping us in here.
Let's hear what he's got to say.

294
00:23:08,162 --> 00:23:12,030
Wait. We decided to do this a certain way.
I think we ought to stick to it.

295
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,413
Oh, stop being a kid, will ya?

296
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:19,165
- What do you mean, a kid?
- What do you think I mean? K-I-D: Kid.

297
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,385
Just because I'm trying
to keep this organised?

298
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:28,681
Here, you take on the responsibility.
I'll just keep my mouth shut.

299
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:32,135
- Why are you gettin' so hot? Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

300
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:34,600
You want to take the chair?
Take the chair.

301
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:37,061
Did you ever see such a thing?

302
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,482
- You think it's funny?
- Forget it, fella. It's unimportant.

303
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:42,477
Unimportant? Here, you try it.

304
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,690
Nobody wants to change.
You're doing a beautiful job.

305
00:23:45,782 --> 00:23:51,406
Yeah, you're doin' great. Just great, fella.
You stay in there and pitch.

306
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:55,113
All right, let's hear from somebody.

307
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:59,371
Well, if you want me to tell you
how I feel about it, it's all right with me.

308
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:04,420
- Boy, I don't care what you do.
- All right. I don't have anything brilliant.

309
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:06,667
I only know as much as you do.

310
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,425
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

311
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:15,222
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

312
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,387
Everybody sounded so positive.

313
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:22,389
I began to get a peculiar feeling about
this trial. I mean, nothing is that positive.

314
00:24:22,483 --> 00:24:26,896
There are questions I'd have liked to ask.
Maybe they wouldn't mean anything but...

315
00:24:26,988 --> 00:24:31,780
I felt that the defence wasn't conducting
a thorough enough cross-examination.

316
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:34,785
He let too many things go by-little things.

317
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:37,705
What little things?
When they don't ask questions,

318
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:40,706
it's because they know
the answers already.

319
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:45,704
It's also possible for a lawyer to be just
plain stupid, isn't it? I mean, it's possible.

320
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:48,881
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

321
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:57,255
I kept putting myself in the kid's place.
I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.

322
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:59,758
I mean, if I was on trial for my life,

323
00:24:59,853 --> 00:25:04,847
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

324
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:09,187
Look, there was one alleged
eyewitness to this killing.

325
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,812
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out after,

326
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:15,113
and there was circumstantial evidence.

327
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:19,150
But those two witnesses
were the entire case for the prosecution.

328
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:20,705
Supposing they're wrong?

329
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:24,122
What do you mean? What's the point
of having witnesses at all?

330
00:25:24,209 --> 00:25:28,586
- Could they be wrong?
- Those people were under oath.

331
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:32,670
They're only people. People
make mistakes. Could they be wrong?

332
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:35,843
- Well, no. I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

333
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:39,379
Nobody can know a thing like that.
This isn't an exact science.

334
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:41,964
That's right, it isn't.

335
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:48,471
OK, let's get to the point.

336
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:51,685
What about the switch knife
they found in the old man's chest?

337
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:54,979
Some people haven't talked yet.
Shouldn't we go in order?

338
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:58,654
They'll get a chance to talk.
Be quiet a second, will ya?

339
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:03,403
What about the knife this fine, upright boy
admitted buying the night of the killing?

340
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:07,114
- Let's talk about it.
- All right. Let's get it in here and look at it.

341
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:12,249
- I'd like to see it again. Mr Foreman?
- Why do we have to see it again?

342
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:15,956
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

343
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:20,009
- Say, could you bring us the knife?
- The knife? Sure.

344
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,964
The knife and the way it was bought
is strong evidence, don't you think?

345
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:28,890
- I do.
- Good. Let's take the facts one at a time.

346
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:32,395
One: The boy admitted leaving the house
at eight o'clock at night

347
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:34,689
after being slapped by his father.

348
00:26:34,776 --> 00:26:39,652
No, he didn't say "slapped".
He said "punched". There's a difference.

349
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:42,277
After being hit several times by his father.

350
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:46,364
Two: He went directly to a local junk shop
where he bought one of those...

351
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:48,862
- Switch knives.
- Switchblade knives.

352
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:53,664
This wasn't an ordinary knife. It had
a very unusual carved handle and blade.

353
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:58,295
The storekeeper said it was the only one
of its kind he had ever had in stock.

354
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:03,625
Three: He met some friends of his in front
of a tavern about 8.45. Am I right so far?

355
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,759
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

356
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:09,298
He talked with his friends
for an hour, leaving them at 9.45.

357
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:12,180
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

358
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:19,151
Four: They identified the death weapon
in court as that very same knife.

359
00:27:19,235 --> 00:27:22,070
Five: He arrived home
at about ten o'clock.

360
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:26,448
This is where the stories offered
by the State and the boy diverge slightly.

361
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:29,025
He claims that he went to a movie
at about 11.30,

362
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,413
returning home at 3.10 to find
his father dead and himself arrested.

363
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:37,578
He also claims that the two detectives
threw him down a half a flight of stairs.

364
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:41,536
What happened to the knife? He claims
it fell through a hole in his pocket

365
00:27:41,631 --> 00:27:45,380
on the way to the movies,
sometime between 11.30 and 3.10,

366
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:49,134
and that he never saw it again.
Now, there is a tale, gentlemen.

367
00:27:49,222 --> 00:27:52,506
I think it's clear the boy
never went to the movies that night.

368
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:56,384
No one in the house saw him go out.
No one at the theatre identified him.

369
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:59,764
He couldn't even remember
the names of the pictures he saw.

370
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:03,477
What actually happened is this.

371
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:06,854
The boy stayed home,
had another fight with his father,

372
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:10,446
stabbed him to death and left the house
at 10 minutes after 12.

373
00:28:10,534 --> 00:28:13,321
He even wiped the knife
clean of fingerprints.

374
00:28:13,412 --> 00:28:17,824
Are you trying to tell me that this knife
fell through a hole in the boy's pocket,

375
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:20,288
someone picked it up,
went to the boy's house

376
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:23,330
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

377
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:25,662
No, but it's possib/e the boy lost his knife

378
00:28:25,756 --> 00:28:28,841
and somebody else stabbed his father
with a similar knife.

379
00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:31,417
Take a look at this knife.

380
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,636
It's a very unusual knife.

381
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:38,970
I've never seen one like it. Neither had
the storekeeper who sold it to the boy.

382
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:42,310
Aren't you asking us to accept
an incredible coincidence?

383
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:47,190
- I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.
- And I say it's not possible.

384
00:28:52,991 --> 00:28:54,948
Where did that come from?

385
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,821
- It's the same knife!
- What do you think you're doin'?

386
00:28:57,912 --> 00:29:01,613
- Where did you get it?
- I went out walking last night.

387
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,784
Through the boy's neighbourhood.

388
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:09,167
I bought that at a pawn shop two blocks
from the boy's house. It cost six dollars.

389
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:12,008
It's against the law
to buy or sell switchblade knives.

390
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:15,295
- That's right. I broke the law.
- You pulled a real bright trick.

391
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,879
Now supposing you tell me what it proves.

392
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:21,222
- Maybe there are ten knives like that.
- Maybe there are!

393
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:26,304
What does it mean? You found a knife like
it. What's that? The discovery of the age?

394
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,609
You think somebody else did the stabbing
with exactly the same kind of knife?

395
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:33,694
- The odds are a million to one.
- It's possible!

396
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,943
- But not very probable.
- OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.

397
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:41,568
There's no point standing around
all over the place.

398
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:45,363
It's interesting that he'd find a knife
exactly like the boy's.

399
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:50,035
- What's interesting about it? Interesting!
- I just thought it was interesting.

400
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:52,454
Eleven of us still think he's guilty.

401
00:29:52,547 --> 00:29:56,379
Right. You're not gonna
change anybody's mind.

402
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:58,756
If you wanna hang this jury, go ahead.

403
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:03,009
The kid'll be tried again
and found guilty, as sure as he's born.

404
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,471
You're probably right.

405
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:08,395
So, what are you gonna do?
We can be here all night.

406
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:11,765
It's only one night. A boy may die.

407
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:14,609
Well, why don't we just
set up house here?

408
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:17,019
Someone send for a pinochle deck

409
00:30:17,113 --> 00:30:20,777
and we'll just sweat
the whole thing out right here.

410
00:30:20,865 --> 00:30:24,698
- I don't think he oughta joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

411
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:27,906
I don't see what the knife
has got to do with anything.

412
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:30,915
Somebody saw the kid stab his father.
What more do we need?

413
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:33,836
You guys can talk the ears
right off my head.

414
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,462
I got three garages going to pot.
So let's get done and get outta here.

415
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:42,132
The knife was important to the
district attorney. He spent a day...

416
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,055
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know?

417
00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:49,433
Let's hold it down. These side arguments
are only slowin' us up.

418
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,638
- Well, what about it?
- You're the only one.

419
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:08,199
I have a proposition to make to all of you.
I'm going to call for another vote.

420
00:31:08,286 --> 00:31:11,073
I want you eleven men to...

421
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:13,571
vote by secret written ballot.

422
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:18,667
I'll abstain. If there are eleven votes
for guilty, I won't stand alone.

423
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:23,665
We'll take in a guilty verdict
to the judge right now.

424
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,966
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we'll stay here and talk it out.

425
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:35,676
- That's it. If you want to try it, I'm ready.
- All right. Let's do it the hard way.

426
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,603
That sounds fair. Everyone agreed?
Anyone doesn't agree?

427
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,767
OK, pass these along.

428
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,675
Guilty.

429
00:32:18,477 --> 00:32:20,137
Guilty.

430
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,558
Guilty.

431
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,852
Guilty.

432
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,731
Guilty.

433
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,775
Guilty.

434
00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:36,069
Guilty.

435
00:32:36,578 --> 00:32:38,239
Guilty.

436
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,908
Guilty.

437
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:46,996
Not guilty.

438
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:48,630
Guilty.

439
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:52,878
- Boy, how do you like that?
- And another chap flips his wings!

440
00:32:52,968 --> 00:32:55,804
All right. Who was it?
Come on, I wanna know.

441
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:59,554
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.
We all agreed on that, no?

442
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:02,097
If the gentleman
wants it to remain secret...

443
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:07,772
Secret? What do you mean? There are no
secrets in a jury room. I know who it was.

444
00:33:07,858 --> 00:33:12,105
Brother, you really are somethin'.
You vote guilty like the rest of us,

445
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:15,399
then some golden-voiced preacher
tears your heart out -

446
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:18,775
some underprivileged kid
couldn't help becoming a murderer -

447
00:33:18,868 --> 00:33:22,617
and you change your vote.
If that isn't the most sickening...

448
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:26,157
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

449
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:30,913
Oh, now just wait a... Listen, you can't talk
to me like that. Who do you think you are?

450
00:33:31,006 --> 00:33:33,792
Calm down, calm down. It doesn't matter.

451
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:37,501
- He's very excitable. Sit down.
- Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!

452
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:40,928
We're tryin' to put a guilty man
in the chair, where he belongs.

453
00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:44,715
Someone starts tellin' us
fairy tales and we're listenin'!

454
00:33:45,395 --> 00:33:50,304
- What made you change your vote?
- He didn't change his vote. I did.

455
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:52,390
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.

456
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:56,351
- Would you like me to tell you why?
- No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.

457
00:33:56,446 --> 00:34:00,526
- I'd like to anyway, if you don't mind.
- Do we have to listen to this?

458
00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:04,116
- The man wants to talk.
- Thank you.

459
00:34:04,203 --> 00:34:07,572
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

460
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:09,906
He doesn't say the boy is not guilty.

461
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:14,912
He just isn't sure. It's not easy to stand
alone against the ridicule of others.

462
00:34:15,006 --> 00:34:19,750
So he gambled for support and I gave it
to him. I respect his motives.

463
00:34:19,843 --> 00:34:24,505
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but... I want to hear more.

464
00:34:24,597 --> 00:34:28,263
The vote is ten to two. I'm talking!
You have no right to leave this room!

465
00:34:28,352 --> 00:34:31,637
He can't hear you. He never will.
Let's sit down.

466
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:40,862
- Shall we continue?
- Well, I think we ought to take a break.

467
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:45,574
You know, one man's inside and
I think we ought to wait for him.

468
00:34:48,328 --> 00:34:51,163
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

469
00:34:51,247 --> 00:34:55,744
I mean, that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

470
00:34:55,836 --> 00:34:59,454
Wish I could figure out some way
we could break it up.

471
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,877
You know, in advertising...
I told you I worked in an agency?

472
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,803
Some pretty strange people work there.
Well, not strange, really.

473
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:14,185
I guess it's just they have peculiar ways
of expressing themselves.

474
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,271
I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

475
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:19,894
- What do you do?
- I'm a watchmaker.

476
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:24,111
Really? I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe.

477
00:35:24,196 --> 00:35:27,197
Anyway, in an agency,
when we reach a point like this...

478
00:35:27,283 --> 00:35:31,114
I'm telling him, in an ad agency when
a point like this is reached in a meeting,

479
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:34,322
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

480
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:36,822
It kills me. It's the weirdest thing,

481
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,953
the way they sometimes precede
their idea with a phrase.

482
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:43,745
Like, some account exec
will get up and he'll say:

483
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:50,173
"OK, here's an idea. Let's... run it up
the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it."

484
00:35:50,262 --> 00:35:52,800
I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny.

485
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,508
I... got a little excited back there.

486
00:35:56,602 --> 00:35:59,556
I... didn't mean to get nasty.

487
00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:06,235
Glad you're not one of those who lets
these emotional appeals influence him.

488
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:24,039
I don't know what's the matter
with that fan.

489
00:36:33,804 --> 00:36:37,054
- Are you a salesman?
- I'm an architect.

490
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:42,603
You know what the soft sell is?

491
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:48,017
Well, you've got it, believe me.

492
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:51,064
I've got a different technique.

493
00:36:51,154 --> 00:36:55,103
Laughs, drinks, jokes, tricks. You know?

494
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:58,193
Yeah.

495
00:36:58,828 --> 00:37:02,243
Hit 'em where they live-that's my motto.

496
00:37:02,331 --> 00:37:06,032
I made 27 grand last year
sellin' marmalade.

497
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:09,709
That's not bad. I mean, you know,
considerin' marmalade.

498
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,546
What are you gettin' out of this? Kicks?

499
00:37:15,303 --> 00:37:19,002
Or did somebody bump you on the head
once and you haven't gotten over it?

500
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:23,426
- Maybe.
- You know, you do-gooders are all alike.

501
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:28,144
You're always blowin' your stacks
over some guy that fanned.

502
00:37:29,357 --> 00:37:32,061
But what are you wastin' our time for?

503
00:37:32,151 --> 00:37:37,655
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause? Maybe it'll make you feel better.

504
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:41,483
This kid is guilty, pal.

505
00:37:41,577 --> 00:37:46,368
It's as plain as the nose on your face. So
why don't we stop wastin' our time here?

506
00:37:46,455 --> 00:37:49,327
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up.

507
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:53,249
What difference does it make
if you get it here or at the ball game?

508
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:55,746
No difference, pal.

509
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:57,917
No difference at all.

510
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:14,562
- Nice bunch of guys, huh?
- They're about the same as anyone else.

511
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,140
Boy, what a murderous day.

512
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:21,318
- Do you think we'll be much longer?
- I don't know.

513
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:25,107
He's guilty for sure.
Not a doubt in the whole world.

514
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:28,950
We should've...
We should've been done already.

515
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:32,280
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

516
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:34,451
Beats workin'.

517
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,295
- You think he's not guilty, huh?
- I don't know. It's possible.

518
00:38:45,386 --> 00:38:49,432
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you've never been wronger in your life.

519
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:51,924
You're wastin' your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

520
00:38:52,018 --> 00:38:54,890
Supposing you were the one
who was on trial?

521
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,230
Well, I'm not used to supposin'.
I'm just a workin' man.

522
00:38:58,317 --> 00:39:01,269
My boss does the supposin'. But...

523
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,437
I'll try one.

524
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,690
Supposin' you talk us all out of this and...

525
00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:11,616
the kid really did knife his father, huh?

526
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:20,917
Are you ready?

527
00:39:22,381 --> 00:39:24,457
Sorry, blue eyes.

528
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:28,296
- Well, where else?
- OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.

529
00:39:28,387 --> 00:39:33,048
- Looks like we'll be here for dinner.
- OK, now let's get down to business.

530
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:34,967
- Who wants to start?
- I will.

531
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:37,930
- OK, go.
- You, down there.

532
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:42,065
The old man who lived downstairs says
he heard the kid yell "I'm gonna kill ya."

533
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,641
A second later,
he heard the body hit the floor.

534
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:49,860
He ran to the door and saw the kid run out
of the house. What's that mean to you?

535
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:53,532
I wonder how clearly he heard
the boy's voice through the ceiling.

536
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:57,699
He didn't. The window was open. So was
the one upstairs. It was a hot night.

537
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,372
It was another apartment.
It's not easy to identify a shouting voice.

538
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,286
He identified it in court.

539
00:40:03,378 --> 00:40:07,838
The lady across the street looked right in
the open window and saw the stabbing.

540
00:40:07,924 --> 00:40:10,416
- Isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

541
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:14,258
Boy, how do you like this guy?
It's like talkin' into a dead phone.

542
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:17,430
She said she saw it through
the windows of a moving el train.

543
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:21,051
There were six cars on the train.
She saw it through the last two.

544
00:40:21,145 --> 00:40:25,142
She remembered insignificant details.
How can you argue with that?

545
00:40:25,232 --> 00:40:30,570
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...

546
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,571
This isn't a game.

547
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:48,077
Did you see him?

548
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,457
The nerve! The absolute nerve!

549
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:55,381
- Forget it. It's not important.
- This isn't a game?

550
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,884
- Who does he think he is?
- Forget it now.

551
00:40:58,972 --> 00:41:04,263
Any idea how long it takes an el train
at medium speed to pass a given point?

552
00:41:04,353 --> 00:41:06,226
- What has that to do with it?
- Guess.

553
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:08,686
- I wouldn't have any idea.
- What do you think?

554
00:41:08,774 --> 00:41:13,482
- I don't know. Ten, twelve seconds?
- A pretty good guess. Anyone else?

555
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:16,238
- Sounds right to me.
- What's the guessing game for?

556
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:18,196
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds.

557
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:21,568
- All right. What are you getting at?
- This.

558
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:25,327
It takes a six-car el train
ten seconds to pass a given point.

559
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:29,874
Say the given point is the open window
of the room where the killing took place.

560
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,961
You can reach out
and almost touch the el tracks, right?

561
00:41:33,046 --> 00:41:36,914
Now let me ask you this. Has anyone
here ever lived near the el tracks?

562
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:41,802
I just finished painting an apartment that
overlooked an el line. It took three days.

563
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:46,265
- What was it like? Noisy?
- Oh, brother! No matter. We were punchy.

564
00:41:46,351 --> 00:41:49,055
I lived in an apartment
near the el line once.

565
00:41:49,145 --> 00:41:52,265
When the window's open,
the train noise is almost unbearable.

566
00:41:52,357 --> 00:41:56,057
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
- Will you get to the point?

567
00:41:56,152 --> 00:42:01,229
I will. Now, let's take two pieces of
testimony and try to put them together.

568
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:05,535
First: The old man
in the apartment downstairs.

569
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:08,158
He says he heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you",

570
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:10,916
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

571
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,742
- One second later.
- Right.

572
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,539
Second: The woman across the street

573
00:42:15,629 --> 00:42:19,673
swore positively she looked
out of the window and saw the killing

574
00:42:19,758 --> 00:42:23,173
through the last two cars
of a passing el train-the last two cars.

575
00:42:23,261 --> 00:42:26,013
- What are you givin' us here?
- Now, just a minute.

576
00:42:26,098 --> 00:42:31,257
We've agreed that it takes ten seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

577
00:42:31,351 --> 00:42:34,555
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars,

578
00:42:34,647 --> 00:42:40,068
we can assume that the body hit
the floor just as the train went by.

579
00:42:40,153 --> 00:42:44,445
Therefore, the train had been
roaring by the old man's window

580
00:42:44,531 --> 00:42:47,947
a full ten seconds
before the body hit the floor.

581
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:53,242
The old man - "I'm gonna kill you",
body hitting the floor a second later -

582
00:42:53,332 --> 00:42:57,495
would have had to hear the boy's words
with the el roaring past his nose!

583
00:42:57,585 --> 00:43:00,503
- It's not possible he heard it.
- Of course he heard it.

584
00:43:00,588 --> 00:43:03,921
- Do you think so?
- He said he yelled at the top of his voice.

585
00:43:04,008 --> 00:43:07,259
He couldn't have identified the voice
with the el roaring by.

586
00:43:07,345 --> 00:43:10,180
It was a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

587
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:15,471
Testimony that could put a boy into the
electric chair shou/d be that accurate.

588
00:43:17,021 --> 00:43:21,433
- I don't think he could have heard it.
- Maybe he didn't, with all that el noise.

589
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:25,439
- What are you people talkin' about?
- It stands to reason he couldn't have.

590
00:43:25,529 --> 00:43:29,608
- Why lie? What's he got to gain?
- Attention, maybe.

591
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:34,906
You keep comin' in with bright sayings.
Send 'em to a paper! They pay $3 apiece!

592
00:43:34,996 --> 00:43:37,783
What are you talkin' to him like that for?

593
00:43:37,874 --> 00:43:41,409
A guy who talks like that to an old man
really oughta get stepped on.

594
00:43:41,503 --> 00:43:44,538
You oughta have more respect, mister.

595
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,707
You say stuff like that to him again...
I'm gonna lay you out.

596
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:02,014
You go ahead. You say anything you like.

597
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:06,226
Why do you think the old man might lie?

598
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:10,362
It was just that I looked at him
for a very long time.

599
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:13,696
The seam of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

600
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:18,160
Did you notice that?
I mean, to come into court like that.

601
00:44:20,665 --> 00:44:24,034
He was a very old man in a torn jacket.

602
00:44:24,544 --> 00:44:28,041
And he walked very slowly to the stand.

603
00:44:28,129 --> 00:44:32,424
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it,

604
00:44:32,509 --> 00:44:35,047
because he was ashamed.

605
00:44:35,136 --> 00:44:39,348
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

606
00:44:39,433 --> 00:44:42,267
This is a quiet, frightened,

607
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:44,807
insignificant old man who...

608
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:47,648
who has been nothing all his life.

609
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:52,643
Who has never had recognition
or his name in the newspapers.

610
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:56,948
Nobody knows him. Nobody quotes him.

611
00:44:57,032 --> 00:45:00,780
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

612
00:45:01,745 --> 00:45:06,372
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing -
to mean nothing.

613
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:11,285
A man like this needs to be quoted,
to be listened to.

614
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:15,501
To be quoted just once -
very important to him.

615
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:18,627
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background.

616
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,800
Wait a minute. Are you tellin' us he'd lie
just so he could be important once?

617
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:25,725
No. He wouldn't really lie.

618
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,179
But perhaps he made himself believe
he heard those words

619
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:31,596
and recognised the boy's face.

620
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,098
That's the most fantastic story ever.

621
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:38,107
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

622
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:50,412
- Does anybody want a cough drop?
- I'll take one.

623
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,083
I still don't see how anybody
can think he's not guilty.

624
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:58,333
There's something else I'd like
to talk about for a minute. Thanks.

625
00:45:58,424 --> 00:46:02,469
We've proved the old man couldn't have
heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."

626
00:46:02,553 --> 00:46:06,467
- You didn't prove it at all!
- Wait. Supposing he really did hear it?

627
00:46:06,557 --> 00:46:10,425
This phrase, how many times have
all of us used it? Probably thousands.

628
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:15,513
"I could kill you for that." "Junior, do that
again and I'll kill you." "Rocky, kill him."

629
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:20,814
- It doesn't mean we'd really kill anybody.
- The phrase was: "I'm gonna kill you."

630
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:23,193
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

631
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,899
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.
Anybody says it like that, they mean it!

632
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,902
Gee, I don't know.

633
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:32,743
I was arguing with the guy I work next to
at the bank a few weeks ago.

634
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,288
He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.

635
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:38,163
This guy is trying to make you
believe what isn't so!

636
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,330
The kid said he'd kill him and he did!

637
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:45,084
Do you really think the boy'd shout it out
so the whole neighbourhood could hear?

638
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:50,088
- He's much too bright for that.
- Bright? He's a common, ignorant slob.

639
00:46:50,181 --> 00:46:52,258
He don't even speak good English.

640
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,801
He doesn't even speak good English.

641
00:46:57,313 --> 00:47:01,181
Mr Foreman, I'd like to
change my vote to not guilty.

642
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,941
- You what?
- You heard me.

643
00:47:04,028 --> 00:47:07,479
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

644
00:47:07,573 --> 00:47:10,242
The vote is nine to three
in favour of guilty.

645
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:12,816
Well, if this isn't the livin' end!

646
00:47:16,957 --> 00:47:20,540
What are you basin' it on?
Stories this guy made up?

647
00:47:20,627 --> 00:47:24,708
You oughta write for one of those kooky
detective magazines, make a fortune.

648
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:28,463
For cryin' out loud, the kid's own lawyer
knew he didn't stand a chance.

649
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:32,086
Right from the beginning, his own
lawyer knew, and you could see it.

650
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:36,392
Boy, oh boy, I'm telling ya.
This guy here is really somethin'.

651
00:47:36,476 --> 00:47:39,844
The kid had a lawyer, didn't he?
He presented his case, not you.

652
00:47:39,936 --> 00:47:42,808
- How come you say so much?
- Lawyers aren't infallible.

653
00:47:42,898 --> 00:47:45,934
- Baltimore, please.
- He was court-appointed.

654
00:47:46,026 --> 00:47:48,232
- What's that supposed to mean?
- A lot.

655
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,571
He didn't want the case
or he resented being appointed.

656
00:47:51,657 --> 00:47:56,117
It's the kind of case that brings no money,
no glory, not much chance of winning.

657
00:47:56,202 --> 00:47:59,322
That's not a very promising
situation for a young lawyer.

658
00:47:59,414 --> 00:48:04,325
He'd really have to believe in his client to
put up a good case. Obviously he didn't.

659
00:48:04,419 --> 00:48:06,496
Of course he didn't.

660
00:48:07,381 --> 00:48:09,705
Who the heck could?

661
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:12,752
Except maybe some guy's mother
or somebody.

662
00:48:12,843 --> 00:48:15,761
Oh, look.
Will you look at the time? Come on.

663
00:48:15,847 --> 00:48:19,381
Pardon me. I have made some notes here,

664
00:48:19,475 --> 00:48:22,890
and I would like, please,
to say something.

665
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:25,765
I have been listening very carefully and...

666
00:48:25,856 --> 00:48:29,723
it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

667
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:34,480
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty, on the surface.

668
00:48:34,573 --> 00:48:38,404
- But maybe if we go deeper...
- Come on, will ya?

669
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:40,735
There is a question I would like to ask.

670
00:48:40,828 --> 00:48:44,279
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

671
00:48:44,373 --> 00:48:47,742
Now, this happened
at 10 minutes after 12.

672
00:48:47,835 --> 00:48:50,373
Now, how was he caught by the police?

673
00:48:50,463 --> 00:48:54,590
He came back home...
at three o'clock or so,

674
00:48:54,674 --> 00:48:58,459
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

675
00:48:58,554 --> 00:49:03,180
Now, my question is:
If he really had killed his father,

676
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:06,718
why would he come back home
three hours later?

677
00:49:06,812 --> 00:49:09,681
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

678
00:49:09,772 --> 00:49:13,853
He came home for his knife. It's not nice
to leave knives in people's chests.

679
00:49:13,944 --> 00:49:16,778
Yeah, especially relatives'.

680
00:49:16,863 --> 00:49:19,484
I don't see anything funny about it.

681
00:49:19,574 --> 00:49:22,777
The boy knew the knife
could be identified.

682
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:27,364
- He had to get it before the police did.
- If he knew the knife could be identified,

683
00:49:27,456 --> 00:49:30,078
why did he leave it there in the first place?

684
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:35,623
I think we can assume the boy ran out in a
state of panic, having just killed his father.

685
00:49:35,714 --> 00:49:38,716
He calmed down and realised
he'd left his knife there.

686
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,717
This, then, depends
on your definition of panic.

687
00:49:41,803 --> 00:49:46,761
He would have had to be calm enough to
wipe off any fingerprints left on the knife.

688
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,717
Now, where did this panic start
and where did it end?

689
00:49:50,812 --> 00:49:53,599
You voted guilty. What side are you on?

690
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:56,856
I don't believe I have to be loyal
to one side or the other.

691
00:49:56,942 --> 00:50:02,185
- I'm simply asking questions.
- This is just off the top of my head but...

692
00:50:02,281 --> 00:50:06,493
If /'d done the stabbing, I'd take a chance
and go back for the knife.

693
00:50:06,577 --> 00:50:09,149
I'll bet he figured
nobody'd seen him running out

694
00:50:09,245 --> 00:50:12,033
and the body wouldn't be discovered
till the next day.

695
00:50:12,124 --> 00:50:16,335
After all, it was the middle of the night.
He figured it'd be found the next day.

696
00:50:16,419 --> 00:50:18,459
Pardon. This is my whole point.

697
00:50:18,546 --> 00:50:22,545
The woman across the street testified
that the moment after she saw the killing,

698
00:50:22,634 --> 00:50:24,875
that is, a moment after the train went by,

699
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:28,135
she screamed, and then went
to telephone the police.

700
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:31,757
Now, the boy certainly
must have heard the scream.

701
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:35,101
So he knew that
somebody saw something.

702
00:50:35,187 --> 00:50:38,058
I just don't think
that he would have gone back.

703
00:50:38,149 --> 00:50:42,774
Two things. One: He may not have heard
the scream. Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

704
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:46,195
Two: If he did, he may not
have connected it with his own acts.

705
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:49,318
He lived in a neighbourhood
where screams were commonplace.

706
00:50:49,409 --> 00:50:53,786
- There's your answer.
- Maybe. Maybe the boy did kill his father.

707
00:50:53,872 --> 00:50:56,279
Didn't hear the scream,
did run out in a panic,

708
00:50:56,374 --> 00:51:01,249
calmed down later and came back for the
knife, risking being caught by the police.

709
00:51:01,337 --> 00:51:04,291
Maybe those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

710
00:51:04,382 --> 00:51:08,628
There's enough doubt to wonder if he was
there at all at the time of the killing.

711
00:51:08,718 --> 00:51:12,170
What do you mean? Didn't the old man
see him running out of the house?

712
00:51:12,264 --> 00:51:14,091
He's twisting the facts.

713
00:51:14,183 --> 00:51:17,765
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12.10?

714
00:51:17,853 --> 00:51:20,523
- Well, did or didn't he?
- He says he did.

715
00:51:20,606 --> 00:51:23,060
Says he did? Boy, how do you like that?

716
00:51:23,149 --> 00:51:26,268
- Witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to!

717
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,066
- Or when he wants them to!
- Keep the yelling down.

718
00:51:29,155 --> 00:51:33,983
Maybe we need a little yelling. These
guys keep going off every which way.

719
00:51:34,076 --> 00:51:37,363
Did hear the scream, didn't hear it -
what difference does it make?

720
00:51:37,455 --> 00:51:41,321
You're talking about little details
and forgetting the important stuff.

721
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:44,086
- I call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

722
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,246
Another vote called for.

723
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:48,829
Now let's take our seats.

724
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:54,382
I never saw so much time
spent on nothin'.

725
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:56,759
It only takes a second.

726
00:51:57,432 --> 00:52:00,848
OK, I guess the fastest way is
to find out who's voting not guilty.

727
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:04,720
All those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

728
00:52:04,814 --> 00:52:08,431
Still the same. One, two, three
not guilty. Nine guilty.

729
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:13,484
So now where are we? We can yakety-yak
till next Tuesday. Where's it getting us?

730
00:52:13,572 --> 00:52:16,608
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

731
00:52:18,661 --> 00:52:23,037
What are you talkin' about? I mean,
we're all goin' crazy in here or somethin'.

732
00:52:23,123 --> 00:52:26,539
The kid is guilty.
Why don't you listen to the facts?

733
00:52:26,627 --> 00:52:29,200
Tell them, will ya?
This is gettin' to be a joke.

734
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:32,664
The vote is eight to four in favour of guilty.

735
00:52:32,757 --> 00:52:36,506
What is this?
Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week?

736
00:52:36,595 --> 00:52:40,259
I want you to tell me why
you changed your vote. Give me reasons.

737
00:52:40,347 --> 00:52:44,926
I don't have to defend my decision to you.
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.

738
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:47,973
Reasonable doubt?
Nothing but words. Look at this.

739
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:53,058
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father!

740
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:58,027
- What about this, Mr Reasonable Doubt?
- That's not the knife, remember?

741
00:52:58,114 --> 00:53:02,693
- Oh, brilliant!
- I'm tellin' you, this is the craziest.

742
00:53:02,786 --> 00:53:07,744
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?
You're pullin' stories out of thin air.

743
00:53:07,832 --> 00:53:11,664
A guy like this, if he's sittin' ringside
at the Dempsey-Firpo fight,

744
00:53:11,753 --> 00:53:13,579
he'd be trying to tell you that...

745
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,419
Look. Now what about the old man?

746
00:53:16,508 --> 00:53:20,208
Are we supposed to believe he didn't
see the kid tearin' down the steps

747
00:53:20,303 --> 00:53:22,259
15 seconds after the killing?

748
00:53:22,387 --> 00:53:25,009
He's just sayin' so to be important, right?

749
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:27,222
- What's the point of it all?
- Hold it.

750
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:29,598
The Baltimore rooter is heard from again.

751
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:33,222
- And pop-ups are fallin' for base hits.
- Hold on a second. Look.

752
00:53:33,316 --> 00:53:36,849
- Did the old man say he ran to the door?
- What's the difference?

753
00:53:36,943 --> 00:53:41,024
- He got there, didn't he?
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

754
00:53:41,114 --> 00:53:44,317
I don't remember, but I don't see
how he could have run.

755
00:53:44,409 --> 00:53:47,991
He said he went from his bedroom
to the front door. Isn't that enough?

756
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,535
- Where was the bedroom?
- Down the hall.

757
00:53:50,624 --> 00:53:53,374
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

758
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:58,536
- I want to see a diagram of the apartment.
- Why don't we have him on trial again?

759
00:53:58,631 --> 00:54:00,919
You're the only one
wants to see exhibits.

760
00:54:01,008 --> 00:54:04,341
- I want to see this one, too.
- I'd like to stop wastin' time.

761
00:54:04,428 --> 00:54:07,678
If we're gonna wade through
that nonsense about the body...

762
00:54:07,764 --> 00:54:13,220
No, but I'd like to know if an old man
who drags one foot cos he had a stroke

763
00:54:13,311 --> 00:54:16,099
can get from his bedroom
to his front door in 15 seconds.

764
00:54:16,189 --> 00:54:17,933
- He said 20.
- He said 15.

765
00:54:18,024 --> 00:54:21,688
- 20. What are you tryin' to distort?
- He said 15.

766
00:54:21,777 --> 00:54:24,944
How does he know how long
15 seconds is? You can't judge that.

767
00:54:25,031 --> 00:54:27,568
He said 15. He was positive about it.

768
00:54:27,658 --> 00:54:29,900
He was an old man! He was confused!

769
00:54:29,993 --> 00:54:33,612
How could he be positive about anything?

770
00:54:40,212 --> 00:54:44,340
I don't see what you're going to prove.
The man said he saw the boy running out.

771
00:54:44,424 --> 00:54:47,709
Let's see if the details bear him out.
As the body hit the floor,

772
00:54:47,803 --> 00:54:51,218
he said he heard footsteps upstairs,
running to the front door.

773
00:54:51,305 --> 00:54:54,508
Heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down.

774
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:00,354
He said he got to his own door in, at most,
15 seconds. If the killer ran immediately...

775
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,013
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

776
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:06,442
You oughta be at
that hair-splitters' convention.

777
00:55:06,528 --> 00:55:08,853
Why don't you stop
making smart remarks?

778
00:55:08,947 --> 00:55:13,526
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything.

779
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:19,538
Here's the apartment. The old man's was
directly beneath and exactly the same.

780
00:55:19,624 --> 00:55:24,867
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom, living
room, kitchen, bathroom, hall, stairs.

781
00:55:24,963 --> 00:55:27,204
The old man was in this bedroom here.

782
00:55:27,298 --> 00:55:30,668
He says he crossed to the door,
walked down the hall, opened the door

783
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,046
just in time to see the boy
running down the stairs. Am I right?

784
00:55:34,138 --> 00:55:36,462
That's the story, for the 19th time.

785
00:55:36,556 --> 00:55:40,056
- 15 seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.

786
00:55:40,144 --> 00:55:42,220
Now, let's see. It was...

787
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:46,096
It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.
The hall is 43 feet.

788
00:55:46,191 --> 00:55:49,643
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door,

789
00:55:49,737 --> 00:55:53,318
walk 43 feet down and open
the front door, all in 15 seconds.

790
00:55:53,406 --> 00:55:55,483
- Could he have done it?
- Sure.

791
00:55:55,575 --> 00:55:58,576
He walks slowly. He needed help
into the witness chair.

792
00:55:58,661 --> 00:56:04,001
- You make it sound like a long walk.
- For an old man who had a stroke, it is.

793
00:56:04,084 --> 00:56:06,656
- What are you doin'?
- I'm gonna try it.

794
00:56:06,752 --> 00:56:09,753
What do you mean?
Why didn't his lawyer bring it up?

795
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:13,967
- Maybe he just didn't think of it.
- Do you think he's an idiot? It's obvious.

796
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:17,087
- Did you think of it?
- It don't matter. He didn't bring it up

797
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:19,172
because he knew it'd hurt his case.

798
00:56:19,264 --> 00:56:23,309
Or because it would have meant bullying
and badgering a helpless old man.

799
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:26,726
That doesn't sit well with a jury.
Most lawyers avoid it.

800
00:56:26,813 --> 00:56:29,483
- What kind of a bum is he?
- That's what I'm asking.

801
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:32,602
Pass me that chair.
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

802
00:56:32,694 --> 00:56:35,480
I just paced off 12 feet.
This is the bedroom door.

803
00:56:35,571 --> 00:56:38,442
That's crazy.
You can't re-create a thing like that.

804
00:56:38,533 --> 00:56:43,989
The hall was 43 feet.
I'll pace from that wall and back again.

805
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,615
This is insane. What are you
wasting everybody's time for?

806
00:56:47,709 --> 00:56:50,993
According to you, it'll only take
15 seconds. We can spare that.

807
00:56:54,381 --> 00:56:56,457
Come on. Knock it off.

808
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,467
OK. OK, OK, killer.

809
00:57:00,262 --> 00:57:02,338
Yeah.

810
00:57:04,141 --> 00:57:08,469
Will you stand there and mark the front
door? It was chain-locked, remember.

811
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:10,934
- Who's got a watch with a second hand?
- I have.

812
00:57:11,022 --> 00:57:15,434
Stamp your foot. That'll be the body
falling. You can time me from there.

813
00:57:15,526 --> 00:57:19,571
- What are we gonna do, play charades?
- What are we waiting for?

814
00:57:19,656 --> 00:57:22,062
I wanna wait till
the second hand reaches 60.

815
00:57:22,157 --> 00:57:24,233
Aw, come on!

816
00:57:30,499 --> 00:57:34,827
Come on, speed it up.
He can walk twice as fast as that.

817
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:38,668
If you want me to walk
faster than that, I will.

818
00:57:54,313 --> 00:57:57,516
- Lock. Door. Stop.
- Right.

819
00:57:57,608 --> 00:57:59,600
What's the time?

820
00:57:59,693 --> 00:58:02,897
Exactly... 41 seconds.

821
00:58:02,989 --> 00:58:07,483
This is what I think happened. The old
man heard the fight a few hours earlier.

822
00:58:07,575 --> 00:58:10,245
When he's in bed,
he heard the body hit the floor,

823
00:58:10,328 --> 00:58:13,863
heard the woman scream, got to
his front door as fast as he could,

824
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,530
heard somebody running
and assumed it was the boy.

825
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:19,745
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?

826
00:58:21,213 --> 00:58:24,167
Brother, I've seen all kinds
of dishonesty in my day,

827
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:27,212
but this little display takes the cake.

828
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:32,214
You all come in here with your hearts
bleedin' about slum kids and injustice.

829
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:36,601
You listen to some fairy tales. You start
getting through to these old ladies.

830
00:58:36,686 --> 00:58:39,557
You're not getting through to me.
I've had enough.

831
00:58:39,647 --> 00:58:43,860
What's the matter with you guys?
You all know he's guilty! He's got to burn!

832
00:58:43,944 --> 00:58:47,360
- He'll slip through our fingers.
- Slip through our fingers?

833
00:58:47,447 --> 00:58:51,361
- Are you his executioner?
- I'm one of 'em.

834
00:58:51,451 --> 00:58:55,400
- Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.
- For this kid, you bet I would.

835
00:58:55,496 --> 00:58:59,364
I feel sorry for you. What it must
feel like to wanna pull the switch!

836
00:58:59,459 --> 00:59:03,456
Ever since you walked in, you've acted
like a self-appointed public avenger.

837
00:59:03,546 --> 00:59:07,590
You want to see this boy die because
you want it, not because of the facts.

838
00:59:07,675 --> 00:59:10,212
- You're a sadist.
- You...

839
00:59:10,302 --> 00:59:14,050
Let me go! I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

840
00:59:14,139 --> 00:59:17,425
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

841
00:59:23,857 --> 00:59:27,640
- Anything wrong? I heard some noise.
- No, everything's all right.

842
00:59:27,735 --> 00:59:30,487
We're just... Friendly little argument.

843
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:35,778
We're through with that diagram.
You can take it if you want. Here you are.

844
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:44,865
What are you lookin' at?

845
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:08,016
- Somebody has to start off again.
- I beg pardon...

846
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:11,024
"I beg pardon."
What are you so polite about?

847
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:16,270
For the same reason you're not.
It's the way I was brought up.

848
01:00:17,283 --> 01:00:21,231
This fighting... That's not
why we are here, to fight.

849
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:23,819
We have a responsibility.

850
01:00:24,956 --> 01:00:29,369
This, I have always thought,
is a remarkable thing about democracy.

851
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,750
That we are...

852
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:35,248
What is the word?

853
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:39,671
Notified. That we are notified by mail
to come down to this place

854
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:47,057
to decide on the guilt or innocence of a
man we... we have never heard of before.

855
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:52,351
We have nothing to gain or lose
by... by our verdict.

856
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,653
This is one of the reasons
why we are strong.

857
01:00:56,737 --> 01:01:00,686
We should not make it a... personal thing.

858
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:07,862
If nobody else has an idea,
I might have a cutie here.

859
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,493
Let's throw it out
and see if the cat licks it up.

860
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,039
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. The boy...

861
01:01:17,672 --> 01:01:23,094
Look how dark it's gettin' out there.
I bet we're gonna have a storm now.

862
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:27,423
Boy, oh boy. It's really hot, huh?

863
01:01:28,141 --> 01:01:33,383
- Pardon me, but... don't you ever sweat?
- No, I don't.

864
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:38,017
Listen. I... I was wonderin' if...

865
01:01:39,444 --> 01:01:42,314
Maybe... maybe we should
take another vote.

866
01:01:42,405 --> 01:01:47,695
Great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments!

867
01:01:47,785 --> 01:01:50,904
- Mr Foreman?
- Well, that's OK with me.

868
01:01:50,996 --> 01:01:54,745
Anyone doesn't wanna vote?
Hey, come on.

869
01:01:55,626 --> 01:01:58,580
- Sorry.
- I think we ought to have an open ballot.

870
01:01:58,671 --> 01:02:01,956
Call out our votes, you know?
Let's see who stands where.

871
01:02:02,049 --> 01:02:05,583
Well, that sounds fair to me.
Anyone object?

872
01:02:07,387 --> 01:02:10,921
OK. I'll call off your jury numbers. One?

873
01:02:11,015 --> 01:02:14,266
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty. Two?

874
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:17,678
Not guilty.

875
01:02:17,771 --> 01:02:19,515
Number three?

876
01:02:19,607 --> 01:02:21,516
Guilty.

877
01:02:21,609 --> 01:02:23,685
Number four?

878
01:02:24,904 --> 01:02:26,563
Guilty.

879
01:02:26,655 --> 01:02:28,198
Number five?

880
01:02:28,283 --> 01:02:30,358
Not guilty.

881
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:32,573
Number six?

882
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,617
Not guilty.

883
01:02:34,704 --> 01:02:36,413
Number seven?

884
01:02:36,498 --> 01:02:38,289
Guilty.

885
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:40,249
Number eight?

886
01:02:40,335 --> 01:02:42,411
Not guilty.

887
01:02:43,546 --> 01:02:46,501
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.

888
01:02:46,592 --> 01:02:49,544
- Number ten?
- Guilty.

889
01:02:50,427 --> 01:02:52,420
Number eleven?

890
01:02:52,513 --> 01:02:54,340
Not guilty.

891
01:02:54,432 --> 01:02:56,508
Number twelve?

892
01:02:56,893 --> 01:02:59,134
Number twelve!

893
01:02:59,228 --> 01:03:01,518
Guilty.

894
01:03:06,818 --> 01:03:09,487
The vote is now six to six.

895
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:12,489
And we go into extra innings here, eh?

896
01:03:13,909 --> 01:03:19,151
Six to six! I'm telling you, some of you
people in here must be out of your minds.

897
01:03:19,247 --> 01:03:20,824
A kid like that!

898
01:03:20,915 --> 01:03:24,366
I don't think the kind of boy he is
has anything to do with it.

899
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:27,212
- Facts determine the case.
- Don't give me that!

900
01:03:27,297 --> 01:03:30,500
I'm sick and tired of facts.
You can twist 'em any way you like.

901
01:03:30,592 --> 01:03:33,876
That's exactly the point
this gentleman has been making.

902
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:36,756
You keep shouting
at the top of your lungs...

903
01:03:38,057 --> 01:03:42,184
I'd like to be a few years younger.
That man gets on my...

904
01:03:45,564 --> 01:03:48,054
- My, it's hot in here.
- Want a drink of water?

905
01:03:48,149 --> 01:03:50,225
No, no. Thanks. Thanks.

906
01:03:59,828 --> 01:04:04,323
- It's gonna rain.
- Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?

907
01:04:05,332 --> 01:04:09,876
- How come you changed your vote?
- It just seemed there was room for doubt.

908
01:04:09,962 --> 01:04:12,998
- You haven't got a leg to stand on.
- I don't feel that way.

909
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:16,292
- A lot of details never came out.
- Yeah, well, good luck.

910
01:04:16,384 --> 01:04:22,138
Come on. You're like everybody else.
You think too much, you get mixed up.

911
01:04:22,223 --> 01:04:26,222
- You know what I mean?
- I don't think you have any right to...

912
01:04:26,311 --> 01:04:28,387
Loudmouth.

913
01:05:21,655 --> 01:05:24,692
Look at that come down, will ya?

914
01:05:25,284 --> 01:05:29,910
You know, this reminds me
of a storm we had last...

915
01:05:31,288 --> 01:05:34,907
Was it November?
I don't know. Something.

916
01:05:35,001 --> 01:05:38,868
It was quite a storm we had.
It was right in the middle of a game.

917
01:05:38,963 --> 01:05:44,005
We were behind-seven to six. We'd just
started to move the ball, made a tackle.

918
01:05:44,093 --> 01:05:48,885
It was gonna cut right in, slash through,
slashed right in, cut right through...

919
01:05:48,973 --> 01:05:51,049
And...

920
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:54,049
We had this kid - Slattery.

921
01:05:55,103 --> 01:05:57,595
He was an ox. A real ox.

922
01:05:58,441 --> 01:06:00,847
I wish I had another one just like him.

923
01:06:00,942 --> 01:06:05,403
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at Andrew J McCorkle High School.

924
01:06:05,489 --> 01:06:07,730
That's out in Queens.

925
01:06:07,824 --> 01:06:12,486
And anyway... we're starting
to move along real nice.

926
01:06:12,578 --> 01:06:17,287
You know, their whole line is just...
just comin' apart.

927
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:20,992
And it starts to come down,
cats and dogs, just like this.

928
01:06:21,086 --> 01:06:24,871
Just... whoosh! You know, right down.

929
01:06:24,966 --> 01:06:28,417
Well, it was murder, you know?

930
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:33,717
I swear, I... I nearly bawled.
Just... We couldn't go nowhere.

931
01:06:51,782 --> 01:06:55,365
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...

932
01:07:05,212 --> 01:07:08,129
Must have been
on the same switch with the lights.

933
01:07:08,215 --> 01:07:11,215
Well, things are lookin' up here, huh?

934
01:07:11,926 --> 01:07:14,003
Yeah.

935
01:07:18,224 --> 01:07:20,300
Boy, that's better.

936
01:07:26,983 --> 01:07:29,473
Hey! Two points.

937
01:07:34,323 --> 01:07:37,157
You guys ever go to the Garden?

938
01:07:38,577 --> 01:07:41,448
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

939
01:07:41,538 --> 01:07:43,614
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

940
01:07:44,749 --> 01:07:46,825
You know?

941
01:07:47,919 --> 01:07:50,291
Pardon me.

942
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:55,208
Well, how do you like it? Even-steven.
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

943
01:07:55,302 --> 01:07:57,378
Yes.

944
01:07:58,596 --> 01:08:03,637
That... business before, when that tall guy,
whatshisname, was tryin' to bait me?

945
01:08:03,726 --> 01:08:07,558
That doesn't prove anything.
I'm a... pretty excitable person.

946
01:08:07,646 --> 01:08:11,431
Where does he come off
calling me a public avenger, a sadist?

947
01:08:11,526 --> 01:08:15,189
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack.

948
01:08:15,278 --> 01:08:17,520
He was just tryin' to bait me.

949
01:08:17,613 --> 01:08:20,105
He did an excellent job.

950
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,283
I think we're going nowhere here.

951
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:26,944
I'm ready to walk into court
and declare a hung jury.

952
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,289
- There's no point in this thing going on.
- I go for that, too.

953
01:08:30,376 --> 01:08:33,080
Let the kid take his chance
with 12 other guys.

954
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:36,421
The judge won't accept a hung jury.
We haven't been here long.

955
01:08:36,507 --> 01:08:39,543
- Well, let's find out.
- I am not in favour of that.

956
01:08:39,635 --> 01:08:43,170
This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

957
01:08:43,263 --> 01:08:46,181
Come on, we're hung.
Nobody's gonna change his vote.

958
01:08:46,266 --> 01:08:49,635
- Still no room for reasonable doubt?
- No.

959
01:08:49,728 --> 01:08:54,935
Pardon. Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt".

960
01:08:55,025 --> 01:08:58,145
What do you mean, I don't understand?

961
01:08:58,236 --> 01:09:01,569
How do you like this guy?
I'm tellin' you, they're all alike.

962
01:09:01,656 --> 01:09:04,407
They come over here
and before they can take a breath,

963
01:09:04,492 --> 01:09:07,196
they're telling us how to run the show.

964
01:09:07,286 --> 01:09:10,371
- Boy, the arrogance of this guy!
- All right.

965
01:09:10,457 --> 01:09:13,658
Let's stop the arguing
for about two minutes in here.

966
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,288
Now, who's got
something constructive to say?

967
01:09:16,378 --> 01:09:19,794
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

968
01:09:19,882 --> 01:09:22,337
An important point
for the prosecution was

969
01:09:22,426 --> 01:09:27,503
the fact that after the boy claimed he was
at the movies when the killing took place,

970
01:09:27,598 --> 01:09:31,677
he couldn't remember the names
of the movies or who starred in them.

971
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:35,718
- This gentleman has made that point.
- That's correct.

972
01:09:35,814 --> 01:09:40,274
It's the only alibi the boy offered, and
he couldn't back it up with any details.

973
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:43,479
In the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details

974
01:09:43,571 --> 01:09:47,070
after an upsetting experience
such as being slapped by your father?

975
01:09:47,157 --> 01:09:50,442
I think so, if there were
any special details to remember.

976
01:09:50,535 --> 01:09:53,869
The boy couldn't remember the movies
because he wasn't there.

977
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:58,913
According to the police testimony,
the boy was questioned in the kitchen,

978
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:01,919
while the body of his father
was lying in the bedroom.

979
01:10:02,005 --> 01:10:04,460
Do you think
you could remember details?

980
01:10:04,549 --> 01:10:06,672
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

981
01:10:06,759 --> 01:10:10,923
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

982
01:10:11,014 --> 01:10:14,678
Yes. His lawyer took great pains
to bring that out.

983
01:10:14,766 --> 01:10:18,812
He had three months to the day of the trial
in which to memorise them.

984
01:10:18,896 --> 01:10:23,439
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played on a particular night.

985
01:10:23,525 --> 01:10:27,144
I'll take the testimony
from right after the murder,

986
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:31,566
when he couldn't remember a thing about
the movies, great emotional stress or not.

987
01:10:31,908 --> 01:10:35,194
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

988
01:10:35,287 --> 01:10:38,490
- Where were you last night?
- I was home all night.

989
01:10:38,581 --> 01:10:41,072
- How about the night before that?
- What is this?

990
01:10:41,167 --> 01:10:45,034
It's all right. I left the office at 8.30
and went straight home and to bed.

991
01:10:45,129 --> 01:10:49,422
- And the night before that?
- That was... Tuesday night.

992
01:10:49,508 --> 01:10:52,463
- The bridge tournament. I played bridge.
- Monday night?

993
01:10:52,553 --> 01:10:56,004
When you get to
New Year's Eve 1954, let me know.

994
01:10:57,849 --> 01:11:04,219
Monday night? Monday night...
my wife and I went to the movies.

995
01:11:04,314 --> 01:11:07,269
- What did you see?
- The Scar/et Circ/e. A whodunit.

996
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:10,230
- What was the second feature?
- The...

997
01:11:12,072 --> 01:11:14,776
I'll tell you in a minute. The...

998
01:11:14,866 --> 01:11:16,942
Remarkab/e Mrs...

999
01:11:18,327 --> 01:11:20,403
Something.

1000
01:11:21,622 --> 01:11:24,196
Mrs Bainbridge.
The Remarkab/e Mrs Bainbridge.

1001
01:11:24,292 --> 01:11:28,039
I saw that. It's called
The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.

1002
01:11:28,128 --> 01:11:30,701
Yes. The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.

1003
01:11:30,797 --> 01:11:33,336
Who was in
The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge?

1004
01:11:33,425 --> 01:11:37,257
Barbara... Long, I think it was.

1005
01:11:37,346 --> 01:11:39,717
A dark, very pretty girl.

1006
01:11:40,641 --> 01:11:44,009
- Ling or... Long. Something like that.
- Who else?

1007
01:11:44,102 --> 01:11:46,260
I'd never heard of them before.

1008
01:11:46,354 --> 01:11:50,981
It was a very inexpensive
second feature, with unknown...

1009
01:11:51,067 --> 01:11:55,230
And you weren't under
an emotional stress, were you?

1010
01:11:56,948 --> 01:11:59,023
No.

1011
01:11:59,116 --> 01:12:01,192
I wasn't.

1012
01:12:02,744 --> 01:12:05,746
- I think the point is made.
- Big point.

1013
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:11,330
You can talk till your tongue is
draggin' on the floor. The boy is guilty.

1014
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,661
Know what I mean, my friend?

1015
01:12:13,755 --> 01:12:17,918
- You got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1016
01:12:19,219 --> 01:12:23,264
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.
There goes your ball game.

1017
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:26,215
It's only a shower.

1018
01:12:26,309 --> 01:12:29,013
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1019
01:12:29,102 --> 01:12:32,602
Say, could I see that knife
a second, please?

1020
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,027
Well, we're still tied up six to six.
Who's got a suggestion?

1021
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:43,275
- It's 5 after 6. Let's get some dinner.
- Why don't we wait till 7 o'clock?

1022
01:12:43,366 --> 01:12:44,232
OK with me.

1023
01:12:45,785 --> 01:12:49,368
There's something I'd like to say.
It's been bothering me a little,

1024
01:12:49,456 --> 01:12:51,745
and as long as we're stuck...

1025
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:55,701
There was this whole business about
the stab wound and how it was made.

1026
01:12:55,796 --> 01:12:59,329
- The downward angle of it, you know?
- Don't start with that again.

1027
01:12:59,423 --> 01:13:03,337
- They've been over it and over it.
- I know, but I don't go along with it.

1028
01:13:03,427 --> 01:13:07,508
The boy was five feet seven inches tall.
His father was six two.

1029
01:13:07,598 --> 01:13:09,923
That's a difference of seven inches.

1030
01:13:10,017 --> 01:13:14,311
It's very awkward to stab down into the
chest of someone over half a foot taller.

1031
01:13:14,396 --> 01:13:16,851
Give me that.

1032
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:20,689
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1033
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:30,156
Watch this - I don't wanna
have to do it again.

1034
01:13:30,245 --> 01:13:33,115
I'll make myself about
six or seven inches shorter.

1035
01:13:33,206 --> 01:13:36,870
- That's about right. Maybe a little more.
- OK, a little more.

1036
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:50,878
Now... nobody's hurt.

1037
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:54,257
- Right?
- Right. Nobody hurt.

1038
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:03,224
Now, this is the way I'd stab a man
who was... taller than I was.

1039
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:05,809
Look at the angle. Down and in.

1040
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:09,652
And this is the way it was done.
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1041
01:14:12,451 --> 01:14:15,701
- Down and in. There's no argument.
- Hold on a minute.

1042
01:14:15,788 --> 01:14:17,863
Will you give me that?

1043
01:14:18,582 --> 01:14:20,659
Boy, I hate these things.

1044
01:14:20,751 --> 01:14:23,918
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1045
01:14:24,004 --> 01:14:27,039
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?

1046
01:14:27,132 --> 01:14:32,256
Well, I have. You know, on my back stoop,
the lot across the street, back yard.

1047
01:14:32,345 --> 01:14:34,717
Switchblades came
with the neighbourhood.

1048
01:14:34,806 --> 01:14:37,891
Funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget.

1049
01:14:37,976 --> 01:14:43,135
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1050
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:46,682
See, you'd lose too much time
switching hands.

1051
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,850
Here's how. Underhand.

1052
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:55,656
Anyone who's ever used one
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1053
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:58,150
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1054
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:02,907
- It's why they're made to open like that.
- The boy was pretty handy with a knife?

1055
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,084
You think he could have made
the wound that killed his father?

1056
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:10,214
No. Not with the experience he got
all his life handling these things.

1057
01:15:10,299 --> 01:15:13,464
- I feel he'd have gone for him underhand.
- How do you know?

1058
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:17,501
- Were you there when he was killed?
- No. Neither was anybody else.

1059
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:20,847
What are you giving us this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1060
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:24,183
I don't think you can tell
what wound he might have made

1061
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,725
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1062
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:29,933
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

1063
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:33,441
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

1064
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:40,485
- How about you?
- I don't know about the rest of 'em,

1065
01:15:40,576 --> 01:15:44,657
but I'm gettin' tired of this
yakety-yakkin'. It's gettin' us nowhere.

1066
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:49,623
So I guess /'// have to break it up.
I'm changin' my vote to not guilty.

1067
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:52,747
- You're what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1068
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:58,212
- You've had enough? That's no answer.
- Listen, you just take care of yourself.

1069
01:15:58,301 --> 01:16:00,758
- You know?
- He's right.

1070
01:16:01,138 --> 01:16:03,594
That's not an answer.

1071
01:16:03,682 --> 01:16:06,599
What kind of a man are you?

1072
01:16:06,685 --> 01:16:09,851
You have sat here and voted
guilty with everyone else

1073
01:16:09,938 --> 01:16:14,231
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1074
01:16:14,317 --> 01:16:19,228
Now you have changed your vote because
you say you're sick of all the talking?

1075
01:16:19,322 --> 01:16:23,106
- Now, listen, buddy...
- Who tells you that you have the right

1076
01:16:23,201 --> 01:16:26,201
to play like this with a man's life?
Don't you care...

1077
01:16:26,287 --> 01:16:29,572
Now, wait a minute.
You can't talk like that to me.

1078
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:34,162
I can talk like that to you.
If you want to vote not guilty,

1079
01:16:34,253 --> 01:16:38,714
do it because you are convinced he is not
guilty, not because you've had enough.

1080
01:16:38,799 --> 01:16:41,586
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1081
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:44,594
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1082
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:47,633
- Now, listen...
- Guilty or not guilty?

1083
01:16:47,724 --> 01:16:51,343
- I told you. Not guilty.
- Why?

1084
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:57,975
- Look, I don't have to...
- You do have to. Say it. Why?

1085
01:16:58,067 --> 01:17:00,392
I... I don't think he's guilty.

1086
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:14,081
- I want another vote.
- OK, that's another vote called for.

1087
01:17:14,165 --> 01:17:17,202
I guess the quickest way
is a show of hands. Anyone object?

1088
01:17:17,294 --> 01:17:20,129
OK, all those voting not guilty,
raise your hands.

1089
01:17:20,505 --> 01:17:22,628
One, two, three,

1090
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:26,169
four, five, six, seven...

1091
01:17:28,804 --> 01:17:30,880
eight.

1092
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:37,846
Nine.

1093
01:17:39,523 --> 01:17:42,773
All those voting guilty, raise your hands.

1094
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:45,148
One, two, three.

1095
01:17:45,237 --> 01:17:48,689
Well, the vote's nine to three
in favour of acquittal.

1096
01:17:48,866 --> 01:17:50,657
I don't understand you people!

1097
01:17:50,743 --> 01:17:54,739
All these picky little points you keep
bringing up, they don't mean nothing!

1098
01:17:54,829 --> 01:17:56,537
You saw this kid just like I did.

1099
01:17:56,623 --> 01:18:00,122
Don't tell me you believe that
phoney story about losing the knife

1100
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:02,285
and about being at the movies.

1101
01:18:02,378 --> 01:18:05,415
Look, you know how these people lie.
It's born in them.

1102
01:18:05,507 --> 01:18:09,550
What the heck? I don't have to tell you.
They don't know what the truth is!

1103
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:13,254
And they don't need any real big reason
to kill someone, either.

1104
01:18:13,347 --> 01:18:18,258
No, sir. They get drunk.
They're real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1105
01:18:18,352 --> 01:18:21,437
You know that. And bang!
Someone's lying in the gutter.

1106
01:18:21,522 --> 01:18:24,605
Nobody's blaming 'em.
That's the way they are by nature.

1107
01:18:24,691 --> 01:18:28,190
You know what I mean? Violent.
Where are you going?

1108
01:18:28,277 --> 01:18:32,442
Human life don't mean
as much to them as it does to us.

1109
01:18:32,532 --> 01:18:35,153
They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time,

1110
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:38,908
and if somebody gets killed,
somebody gets killed! They don't care!

1111
01:18:38,996 --> 01:18:43,041
Sure, there's some good things about 'em,
too. I'm the first one to say that.

1112
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:46,708
I've known a couple who were OK,
but that's the exception.

1113
01:18:46,796 --> 01:18:50,461
Most of 'em, it's like they have
no feelings! They can do anything!

1114
01:18:50,549 --> 01:18:52,625
What's going on here?

1115
01:18:53,344 --> 01:18:57,388
I'm trying to tell you.
You're making a big mistake, you people.

1116
01:18:57,472 --> 01:19:01,220
This kid is a liar. I know it.
I know all about them.

1117
01:19:02,185 --> 01:19:04,262
Listen to me. They're no good.

1118
01:19:04,355 --> 01:19:07,059
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.

1119
01:19:08,816 --> 01:19:11,307
I mean, what's happening in here?

1120
01:19:11,402 --> 01:19:13,976
I speak my piece, and you...

1121
01:19:14,781 --> 01:19:16,856
Listen to me.

1122
01:19:17,616 --> 01:19:20,108
I... We're... we're...

1123
01:19:20,203 --> 01:19:24,780
This kid on trial here. His type.
Well, don't you know about them?

1124
01:19:25,624 --> 01:19:28,114
There's a... There's a danger here.

1125
01:19:29,169 --> 01:19:31,328
These people are dangerous.

1126
01:19:31,421 --> 01:19:33,710
They're... wild.

1127
01:19:34,633 --> 01:19:37,124
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1128
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:41,716
I have. Now, sit down
and don't open your mouth again.

1129
01:19:45,644 --> 01:19:48,478
Some of the time... I tell you.

1130
01:20:24,888 --> 01:20:30,393
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1131
01:20:30,478 --> 01:20:35,982
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1132
01:20:36,067 --> 01:20:38,438
I don't really know what the truth is.

1133
01:20:38,526 --> 01:20:42,738
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1134
01:20:42,822 --> 01:20:46,607
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1135
01:20:46,701 --> 01:20:51,826
But we're just gambling on
probabilities. We may be wrong.

1136
01:20:51,915 --> 01:20:57,869
We may be trying to let a guilty man
go free. I don't know. Nobody really can.

1137
01:20:57,962 --> 01:21:00,251
But we have a reasonable doubt.

1138
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:04,088
And that's something
that's very valuable in our system.

1139
01:21:04,177 --> 01:21:08,803
No jury can declare a man guilty
unless it's sure.

1140
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:15,305
We nine can't understand
how you three are still so sure.

1141
01:21:16,312 --> 01:21:18,804
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1142
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:23,313
You've made some excellent points,
but I still believe the boy is guilty.

1143
01:21:23,402 --> 01:21:27,863
I have two reasons. One: The evidence
given by the woman across the street,

1144
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:30,784
who actually saw the murder committed.

1145
01:21:30,868 --> 01:21:33,573
That's the most important testimony.

1146
01:21:33,663 --> 01:21:36,284
And two: The fact that
she described the stabbing

1147
01:21:36,374 --> 01:21:39,493
by saying she saw the boy
raise his arm over his head

1148
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:42,503
and stab down into the father's chest.

1149
01:21:42,588 --> 01:21:46,585
- She saw him do it, the wrong way.
- That's absolutely right.

1150
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:49,458
Let's talk about this woman for a moment.

1151
01:21:49,553 --> 01:21:52,719
She said she went to bed
about eleven o'clock that night.

1152
01:21:52,806 --> 01:21:56,139
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out

1153
01:21:56,225 --> 01:22:00,354
and see directly into
the boy's room across the street.

1154
01:22:00,438 --> 01:22:02,976
She tossed and turned for over an hour.

1155
01:22:03,066 --> 01:22:07,229
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12,

1156
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:12,658
and as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

1157
01:22:12,741 --> 01:22:15,148
She said the lights went out
after the killing,

1158
01:22:15,243 --> 01:22:21,033
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1159
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:25,667
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakeable testimony.

1160
01:22:25,754 --> 01:22:29,288
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1161
01:22:33,971 --> 01:22:36,046
How about you?

1162
01:22:37,348 --> 01:22:43,635
I don't know. So much evidence to sift.
This is a pretty complicated business.

1163
01:22:43,729 --> 01:22:47,679
Frankly, I don't see how
you can vote for acquittal.

1164
01:22:47,775 --> 01:22:51,938
- It's not so easy to arrange the evidence.
- Throw out all the other evidence!

1165
01:22:52,028 --> 01:22:55,646
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1166
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:57,899
- Well, maybe...
- Let's vote on it.

1167
01:22:57,993 --> 01:23:01,860
OK, there's another vote called for.
Anyone object?

1168
01:23:01,955 --> 01:23:04,197
All right. I'm changing my vote.

1169
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:07,493
- He's guilty.
- Anybody else? The vote is eight to four.

1170
01:23:07,585 --> 01:23:11,119
Why is this such a personal triumph
for you, this one vote?

1171
01:23:11,213 --> 01:23:14,665
OK. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1172
01:23:14,759 --> 01:23:17,676
How about it? I wanna hear arguments.

1173
01:23:17,762 --> 01:23:21,509
You, you're the leader of the cause.
What about it?

1174
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:26,175
- Let's go over it again.
- We've been over it again.

1175
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:31,062
The boy in the grey flannel suit is
bouncin' back and forth like a tennis ball.

1176
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:36,605
There's no point in getting nasty.
You keep trying to turn this into a contest.

1177
01:23:37,238 --> 01:23:38,317
OK.

1178
01:23:38,405 --> 01:23:41,490
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.

1179
01:23:41,576 --> 01:23:44,493
Yeah. Once around for the deal, huh?

1180
01:23:44,579 --> 01:23:50,415
It's... a quarter after six. Someone
before mentioned seven o'clock.

1181
01:23:50,502 --> 01:23:56,207
That's a point at which we might begin to
discuss whether we're a hung jury or not.

1182
01:23:56,298 --> 01:24:01,174
- Don't you feel well?
- I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1183
01:24:01,261 --> 01:24:04,216
I was saying seven o'clock
would be a reasonable time...

1184
01:24:04,307 --> 01:24:08,552
The reason I asked that was because
you were rubbing your nose like...

1185
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:11,312
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting.

1186
01:24:11,395 --> 01:24:14,812
But you made a gesture
that reminded me of something.

1187
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:19,810
- I'm trying to settle something here.
- Well, I think this is important.

1188
01:24:20,029 --> 01:24:24,406
Thank you. Now, then.
I'm sure you'll pardon me for this,

1189
01:24:24,491 --> 01:24:27,528
but I was wondering why
you rub your nose like that.

1190
01:24:27,619 --> 01:24:28,900
Come on, will you?

1191
01:24:28,996 --> 01:24:33,457
At this point I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you.

1192
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:36,957
Now, why were you
rubbing your nose like that?

1193
01:24:37,044 --> 01:24:40,959
If it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1194
01:24:41,049 --> 01:24:45,046
Oh, I'm sorry. Is it...
Is it because of your eyeglasses?

1195
01:24:45,136 --> 01:24:48,671
It is. Now could we get on
to something else?

1196
01:24:48,765 --> 01:24:53,307
Your eyeglasses made those two deep
impressions on the sides of your nose.

1197
01:24:53,393 --> 01:24:56,977
I hadn't noticed that before.
That must be annoying.

1198
01:24:57,064 --> 01:24:59,140
It is very annoying.

1199
01:24:59,233 --> 01:25:04,655
I wouldn't know about that.
I've never worn eyeglasses. 20/20.

1200
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:08,949
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1201
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:12,699
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing

1202
01:25:12,788 --> 01:25:16,999
had those same marks
on the sides of her nose.

1203
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:19,159
Holy smoke! He's right.

1204
01:25:19,252 --> 01:25:24,957
Please. Just give me a minute...
and I'll be finished.

1205
01:25:25,049 --> 01:25:28,004
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1206
01:25:28,094 --> 01:25:35,009
I didn't think of it then, but I've been
going over her face... in my mind.

1207
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:39,347
She had those same marks.
She kept rubbing them in court.

1208
01:25:39,771 --> 01:25:43,187
He's right. She did do that a lot.

1209
01:25:43,275 --> 01:25:47,059
This woman was about 45 years old.

1210
01:25:48,072 --> 01:25:52,068
She was making
a tremendous effort to look 35.

1211
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:57,698
For her first public appearance.
Heavy make-up. Dyed hair.

1212
01:25:57,789 --> 01:26:01,621
Brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1213
01:26:01,710 --> 01:26:07,663
No glasses. Well, women do that.
See if you can get a mental picture of her.

1214
01:26:07,756 --> 01:26:11,291
What do you mean, no glasses? How do
you know whether she wore glasses?

1215
01:26:11,385 --> 01:26:14,754
- Just cos she was rubbin' her nose?
- She had those marks. I saw 'em.

1216
01:26:14,847 --> 01:26:18,216
- So? What do you think that means?
- I'm sick of your yellin'...

1217
01:26:18,309 --> 01:26:19,802
Come on. Forget it.

1218
01:26:19,893 --> 01:26:24,471
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right. I saw
them too. I was the closest one to her.

1219
01:26:24,564 --> 01:26:27,649
She had these things
on the side of her nose.

1220
01:26:27,943 --> 01:26:29,651
What point are you makin'?

1221
01:26:29,736 --> 01:26:33,354
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
What does that mean?

1222
01:26:33,448 --> 01:26:38,026
Could those marks be made
by anything other than eyeglasses?

1223
01:26:41,455 --> 01:26:43,579
No. They couldn't.

1224
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:46,157
I didn't see any marks!

1225
01:26:47,628 --> 01:26:51,756
I did. Strange,
but I didn't think about it before.

1226
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,082
Why didn't the lawyer say something?

1227
01:26:54,176 --> 01:26:57,129
There are twelve people in here
concentrating on this case.

1228
01:26:57,220 --> 01:27:00,921
- Eleven of us didn't think of it either.
- What about the district attorney?

1229
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:04,550
You think he'd pull that?
Have her testify without her glasses?

1230
01:27:04,643 --> 01:27:08,891
Ever see a woman who didn't want to
wear them because they spoil her looks?

1231
01:27:08,982 --> 01:27:13,773
OK. She had marks on her nose.
I'm givin' you that.

1232
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:17,195
From glasses, right? She didn't
wanna wear 'em out of the house

1233
01:27:17,282 --> 01:27:20,317
so people'd think she's gorgeous.

1234
01:27:20,409 --> 01:27:24,737
But when she saw this kid killin'
his father, she was in the house alone.

1235
01:27:24,829 --> 01:27:26,906
That's all.

1236
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,496
Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?

1237
01:27:29,584 --> 01:27:31,660
No. I don't.

1238
01:27:32,712 --> 01:27:34,752
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1239
01:27:34,839 --> 01:27:39,417
It's logical to assume
that she wasn't wearing them in bed.

1240
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:41,966
- How do you know?
- I don't know. I'm guessing.

1241
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:46,716
I'm also guessing that she didn't put them
on when she looked out of the window.

1242
01:27:46,809 --> 01:27:49,928
She testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1243
01:27:50,019 --> 01:27:53,021
The lights went off.
She didn't have time to put them on.

1244
01:27:53,107 --> 01:27:56,974
Here's another guess. She honestly
thought she saw the boy kill his father.

1245
01:27:57,068 --> 01:28:00,568
- I say she only saw a blur.
- How do you know what she saw?

1246
01:28:00,656 --> 01:28:04,154
How does he know all that? How
do you know what glasses she wore?

1247
01:28:04,242 --> 01:28:08,157
Maybe they were sunglasses! Maybe
she was far-sighted! What do you know?

1248
01:28:08,246 --> 01:28:11,247
I only know the woman's eyesight
is in question now.

1249
01:28:11,332 --> 01:28:17,371
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1250
01:28:17,464 --> 01:28:20,463
You can't send someone off
to die on evidence like that.

1251
01:28:20,549 --> 01:28:22,043
Aw, don't give me that.

1252
01:28:22,134 --> 01:28:25,135
- Might she not have made a mistake?
- No.

1253
01:28:25,346 --> 01:28:28,382
- It's not possible?
- No, it's not possible.

1254
01:28:31,643 --> 01:28:33,719
Is it possible?

1255
01:28:34,604 --> 01:28:36,680
Not guilty.

1256
01:28:40,402 --> 01:28:43,023
Do you think he's guilty?

1257
01:28:43,113 --> 01:28:45,401
I think he's guilty.

1258
01:28:47,909 --> 01:28:49,985
Do you?

1259
01:28:52,246 --> 01:28:53,740
No.

1260
01:28:53,831 --> 01:28:56,867
I'm convinced. Not guilty.

1261
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,909
- What's the matter with you?
- I have a reasonable doubt now.

1262
01:29:01,005 --> 01:29:04,088
- It's eleven to one.
- What about all the other evidence?

1263
01:29:04,173 --> 01:29:07,757
What about all that stuff? The...
The knife? The whole business?

1264
01:29:07,844 --> 01:29:11,924
Well, you said we could
throw out all the other evidence.

1265
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,010
Well, what do we do now?

1266
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,732
You're alone.

1267
01:29:23,818 --> 01:29:28,112
I don't care whether I'm alone or not.
It's my right.

1268
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:32,442
It's your right.

1269
01:29:41,919 --> 01:29:44,872
Well, what do you want? I say he's guilty.

1270
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:49,925
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1271
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:54,091
We're not convinced.
We want to hear them again.

1272
01:29:55,222 --> 01:29:58,010
We have as much time as it takes.

1273
01:30:02,979 --> 01:30:09,314
Everything-every single thing that took
place in that courtroom says he's guilty.

1274
01:30:09,403 --> 01:30:12,523
What do you think?
I'm an idiot or somethin'?

1275
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:19,278
Take that stuff about the old man,
who lived there and heard everything!

1276
01:30:20,538 --> 01:30:24,203
Or this business about the knife.
They found another one exactly like it?

1277
01:30:24,292 --> 01:30:27,791
The old man saw him!
Right there, on the stairs.

1278
01:30:27,879 --> 01:30:31,497
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?

1279
01:30:32,008 --> 01:30:38,260
Every single thing. The knife
fallin' through a hole in his pocket.

1280
01:30:38,347 --> 01:30:42,012
You can't prove he didn't get to the door!

1281
01:30:42,101 --> 01:30:46,847
Sure, you can take all the time, hobble
around the room, but you can't prove it!

1282
01:30:49,399 --> 01:30:52,435
And what about this business of the el?
And the movies?

1283
01:30:52,527 --> 01:30:55,813
There's a phoney deal if I ever heard one.

1284
01:30:55,906 --> 01:30:59,903
I'll bet you $5,000
/'d remember the movies I saw.

1285
01:30:59,993 --> 01:31:06,196
I'm tellin' you, everything that's gone on
has been twisted and turned!

1286
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:09,990
This business with the glasses?
How do you know she didn't have 'em on?

1287
01:31:10,085 --> 01:31:13,455
This woman testified in open court!

1288
01:31:14,215 --> 01:31:18,081
And what about
hearin' the kid yell? Huh?

1289
01:31:18,176 --> 01:31:22,340
I'm tellin' ya, I've got all the facts here.

1290
01:31:22,764 --> 01:31:24,840
Here...

1291
01:31:26,893 --> 01:31:30,227
Well, that's it. That's the whole case.

1292
01:31:36,694 --> 01:31:38,770
Well?

1293
01:31:40,531 --> 01:31:42,607
Say something!

1294
01:31:47,621 --> 01:31:50,990
You lousy bunch of bleedin' hearts.

1295
01:31:51,791 --> 01:31:57,035
You're not gonna intimidate me.
I'm entitled to my opinion.

1296
01:31:59,591 --> 01:32:03,339
Rotten kids... You work your life out!

1297
01:32:15,231 --> 01:32:17,306
No...

1298
01:32:20,861 --> 01:32:22,937
Not guilty.

1299
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:28,234
Not guilty.

1300
01:32:43,675 --> 01:32:45,751
We're ready now.

1301
01:34:38,659 --> 01:34:40,735
Hey!

1302
01:34:44,957 --> 01:34:47,957
- What's your name?
- Davis.

1303
01:34:48,042 --> 01:34:50,119
My name's McCardle.

1304
01:34:52,422 --> 01:34:55,127
- Well, so long.
- So long.
