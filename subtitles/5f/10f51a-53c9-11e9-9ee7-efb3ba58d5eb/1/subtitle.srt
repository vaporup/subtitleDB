1
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,701
What is the meaning of this check?

2
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:52,532
Do you want me to cheat?

3
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,003
No...

4
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,107
I'm just the middleman.

5
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,300
Do you play fast and loose with me,
or cause me trouble?

6
00:01:57,444 --> 00:01:59,935
Don't you think you'll be ahead of me...

7
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,377
...if I fall?

8
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:03,641
Look at this!

9
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:06,616
I'm the only Golden Leg!

10
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:08,516
You can't daydream about that.

11
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:10,520
No... I don't.

12
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:12,852
I just want to have some tick-back.
Please don't tell anybody.

13
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:15,017
You're trash!

14
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:18,028
I'm sorry. Catch you later.

15
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:48,188
Golden Leg! Golden Leg...

16
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:53,595
Golden Leg...

17
00:02:53,733 --> 00:03:01,333
Golden Leg...

18
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:53,618
Hung, you've been a star player
for twenty years.

19
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,320
Since Fung missed the penalty kick
and lost his golden leg,

20
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:58,259
you ever have any rivals.
Now your feeling is...

21
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:00,093
Oh, no! Don't talk about this!

22
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,222
Hung, your Evil Team

23
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,834
has already won the gold for five years.

24
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:04,129
What's the secret?

25
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,966
Secret? The secret is having
the great soccer coach.

26
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:08,801
So you should have confidence
to get the gold again.

27
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:12,036
Are you first time to be a reporter?
I don't think you should ask this question.

28
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:16,240
Excuse me...

29
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,946
Good morning, Hung!

30
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:21,847
Golden Leg!

31
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:25,915
Good morning, Hung!

32
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,287
Good morning!

33
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:29,691
Hung, your shoe is dirty.

34
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,126
I help you to clean it up.

35
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:33,425
It's fine. I can manage.

36
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,401
Hung, I'll take your car over.

37
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:45,875
Hung, you promise to offer
a coaching job to me.

38
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:47,946
I'm ready.

39
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:51,141
I've confidence to train a team
as good as the Evil Team.

40
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:53,278
Do you think you still can be a coach?

41
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,545
Forget it.

42
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:55,984
But you said...

43
00:04:56,122 --> 00:05:00,422
Get real.

44
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,324
You see. You're a cripple now.

45
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:06,998
Don't you think you still
can depend on this tattoo?

46
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,464
Hung...

47
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,727
I've served you for twenty years.

48
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:11,336
How can you say such thing?

49
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:14,804
Today, I'm not in the mood.
Things change.

50
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,670
You looked great when you were young.

51
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:19,937
You see, you just look like a dog right.

52
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:21,603
Forget it. Got lost.

53
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:23,716
I've already taken care
of you for twenty years.

54
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,444
You know, it is a great deal of money.

55
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:28,144
Hung!

56
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:30,322
You're so vain!

57
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,651
If you didn't give me...

58
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,090
...the dishonour check twenty years ago,

59
00:05:35,228 --> 00:05:37,128
I wouldn't be crippled now.

60
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:39,595
What? Are you loosing your temper?
Why don't you shout loudly!

61
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:41,393
Hey! Did all you guys hear that?

62
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:44,628
There're thousands of reporters outside.
Would you like me to let them come in?

63
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:47,228
You know,

64
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:49,273
I keep you here to shut your mouth.

65
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,899
Do you think anyone would trust...

66
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:52,136
...a handicapped beggar as you now?

67
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:54,269
- You!
- Don't be angry.

68
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:56,974
If you want to blame anyone,
that one should be you.

69
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:59,342
You should blame your greediness.

70
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,214
Forget it

71
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,791
Tell you one more thing.

72
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:09,793
I was the one who arranged
the accident to your leg.

73
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:45,264
Damn it!

74
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,807
It's no way to kick like that.

75
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:18,193
Pardon?

76
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:22,692
I said...

77
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:25,596
...it was no way to kick like that.

78
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,366
So what's your opinion?

79
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:35,948
There has to be a fusion of
the strength from the waist and foot.

80
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,177
What's that?

81
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:58,066
My idol, Bruce Lee,

82
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:02,300
had already elaborated about it.

83
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:03,875
If you want to learn more,

84
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,240
you can take two kung fu lessons from me.

85
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,438
Learning kung fu?

86
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:11,573
You just look like a cleaner.

87
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:14,278
Cleaner is just my job.

88
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,253
My real identity
is a post-graduate student.

89
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,017
Post-graduate student?

90
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:21,183
Focusing on how to

91
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:24,990
effectively develop Shaolin kung fu.

92
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:26,961
This's my name card.

93
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:33,535
Shaolin Orthodox School Mighty Stal Leg.

94
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:35,265
Look! It's really strong.

95
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:40,044
Fighting is not my style.

96
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:41,805
I'm an well-educated man.

97
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:43,609
You're wrong.

98
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:48,151
Look at that girl.

99
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,757
I know she's sexy, so what?

100
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,860
- But I'm an educated...
- No...

101
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,758
Look at this!

102
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:13,605
If she had learned Shaolin kung fu,
Weight Vest,

103
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:15,373
she would not have fallen like this.

104
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:16,675
You see!

105
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:27,392
So Shaolin kung fu is great!

106
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:30,759
Hey! Do you want to learn kung fu?

107
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:32,728
You're crazy!

108
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:36,365
Look at the woman over there.

109
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:39,329
If she had studied Shaolin kung fu,
Iron Hand,

110
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:41,531
parking would be much easier.

111
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:48,771
So kung fu is wonderful!

112
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:50,280
Excuse me! Do you want to learn...

113
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,475
Okay... Get lost me!

114
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:55,848
This coin is not just yours.
I should have a share.

115
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:57,819
Don't do that to ruin our relationship!

116
00:09:57,957 --> 00:09:59,424
Look at that!

117
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,459
What's wrong?

118
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:03,221
You've already spent a whole year
to trim the tree.

119
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,761
You're fired. Get away!

120
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,024
- I'm sorry...
- Get away!

121
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,930
If he had studied Shaolin kung fu,
Nine Fence of the Recluse,

122
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,502
he would not be in trouble!

123
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:17,070
Nine Fence of the Recluse
seems came from Hua Shan.

124
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:20,610
Don't you know all kinds of kung fu
originated from Shaolin?

125
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,166
Kung fu is absolutely good
for different ages.

126
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:45,862
Brutality is just the wrong
impression of kung fu.

127
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:47,836
Kung fu is an art,

128
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,771
one kind of indomitable spirit.

129
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,536
I'm looking for a good method...

130
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:53,941
...to package Shaolin kung fu...

131
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,547
...and then let people understand...

132
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:58,081
...the true meaning of it.

133
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,241
Enough, already!

134
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:00,647
I've not finished yet.

135
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,310
Almost finished.

136
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:03,786
I still have some appointments
with my clients.

137
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:05,390
It's done.

138
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:07,219
Please seize your opportunity!

139
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,123
The lame can also learn kung fu.

140
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:12,526
What are you talking about?
Who's the lame?

141
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:14,792
You're not qualified
to talk soccer with me.

142
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:15,730
I'm sorry!

143
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:16,732
Yes, I'm the lame.

144
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:19,963
It's none of your business.

145
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,334
The lame?

146
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:24,073
Bullshit!

147
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:35,210
What?

148
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:36,548
Do you think that would scare me?

149
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:40,125
Do you still want the garbage?
If you don't, I'll call the other one.

150
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:41,157
I'm coming over.

151
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:42,590
Hurry up!

152
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:46,755
Do you think that would scare me?

153
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:17,853
Get out of here...

154
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:42,484
Excuse me! Would you help me
to pick it over there?

155
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:44,020
No problem!

156
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,491
Your leg is so great!

157
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:58,025
- Twenty cents!
- Oh, no! Just twenty cents?

158
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,637
There are some cups and plates inside.
Would you give me ten more cents?

159
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:02,070
No more!

160
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,197
Wah, move it over there.

161
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:31,129
Mui, please give me ten steamed bread!

162
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:08,522
Using Tai Chi kung fu to make
steamed bread is a startling idea.

163
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:14,128
The steamed bread looks sweet and tasty.

164
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:17,174
I'm so impressed...

165
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:24,511
...by her strong arms.

166
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:26,245
You...

167
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,017
What are you doing?

168
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:30,246
Singing is the exceptional way...

169
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:34,223
for me to express
my true feeling of esteem.

170
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:37,619
So beautiful!

171
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:42,434
I'm not beautiful. Don't laugh at me!

172
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,763
You see! The steamed bread is so great!

173
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:50,769
Taste wonderful!

174
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,743
Your Tai Chi kung fu, Shifting Bodies
and Transposing Shadows...

175
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,144
It's a firm but gentle kung fu,
Shove a Thousand Cattle with Four Tales.

176
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,112
Well!

177
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:02,821
That's why the steamed bread
is so tender and tough.

178
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:06,916
Fifty cents per each.
Two-steamed bread is one dollar.

179
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,887
- So expensive!
- Really

180
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:12,122
Even though it's so expensive,
it's worth.

181
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:14,762
I just have fifty cents right now.

182
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,527
Would you mind
I'll pay you back two days later?

183
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:17,533
Nope.

184
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,867
Well! You're a typical kung fu master
speaking with grace and ease.

185
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,871
You know, we get something in common.
I'm also a Shaolin master.

186
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:24,302
Would you give me
a face-saving permission?

187
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,205
No.

188
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,504
Okay!

189
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:32,275
This's a pair of precious sneakers.
The original price is two dollars.

190
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:34,477
Now, I give you a discount price,

191
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:40,423
Is my steamed bread ready?

192
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,322
Coming! Wait a minute!

193
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,361
Did the guy pay for the steamed bread?

194
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,699
He did.

195
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:53,300
What's this dirty stuff? Throw it away!

196
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:06,882
First Big Brother!

197
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:16,621
First Big Brother!

198
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:17,660
It's okay!

199
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,459
Keep working. Clean it up, please!

200
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:25,628
Are you sick, First Big Brother?

201
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:28,501
I've a headache. I got drunk last night.

202
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,607
Anyway, what do you want?

203
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:32,336
I want to let you know
I awakened already.

204
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:34,537
- Truly? You awakened.
- I awakened.

205
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,647
I finally understood.

206
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:38,147
If I want to develop
Shaolin kung fu to the world,

207
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:39,272
I should package it
into a new and modern form.

208
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:40,476
What's kind of packaging?

209
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:44,113
Singing!

210
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:47,254
You won't believe what I see today.

211
00:17:47,393 --> 00:17:49,384
- I see a steamed bread shop...
- Stop bothering me!

212
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:52,292
But, what do you think
if I combine Shaolin kung fu...

213
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:53,363
...with singing and dancing?

214
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:54,329
Don't think about that!

215
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,558
How can you give anything up
if you never try it?

216
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:56,998
Stop thinking about that!

217
00:17:57,136 --> 00:17:59,468
I've already advised you to live
in a down-to-earth manner.

218
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:01,971
There's a vacancy for cleaning toilet.
It should be good for you...

219
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:03,836
...to take it rather than
to dream anything.

220
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:07,139
If we don't have any dream in life,
we'll look like a salt fish.

221
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,112
You see, you're a real salt fish
without a pair of shoes!

222
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:12,114
How can you talk about dream?

223
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:13,548
Oh, no!

224
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:16,916
My firing-hearted
is not easy to blow out!

225
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:19,680
Why not? Just blow it out!

226
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:21,122
But I can light it up again!

227
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,693
Enough, already!

228
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:25,125
We both have our own lives.

229
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:26,788
Please don't bother me!

230
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:28,991
I should work to support my family.

231
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:31,830
You mean you are willing
to give your Iron Head up.

232
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,530
Did you forget how much effort
you made for it?

233
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:35,970
You're wrong!

234
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,408
I don't give it up...

235
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,842
...even one day!

236
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,174
Fei!

237
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:44,373
Boss!

238
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:45,984
Damn it!

239
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:47,710
The dancers quitted the show already.

240
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:49,548
How can you stick to here
and do nothing for that?

241
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:52,418
No! I have a great idea.

242
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:53,456
What's that?

243
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,686
Combining Shaolin kung fu
with singing and dancing.

244
00:18:56,829 --> 00:18:57,955
What's kind of Shaolin kung fu?

245
00:18:58,097 --> 00:18:59,223
Look at this!

246
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:05,234
It's no way for sole.

247
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,428
He's good enough.

248
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:08,472
No! How about you?

249
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:09,869
Me?

250
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:12,604
Shit!

251
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:14,473
How about your Iron Head?

252
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,447
If you don't do it well,
I'll kill you tomorrow.

253
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:19,744
Yes.

254
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:22,182
First Big Brother, thank you!

255
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:36,097
Shaolin kung fu is great!

256
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:38,203
Really great!

257
00:19:38,337 --> 00:19:40,498
Shaolin kung fu is wonderful!

258
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,698
Wonderful!

259
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:44,934
I'm Iron Head.

260
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:47,102
Iron Head.

261
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:49,339
You're Mighty Stal Leg.

262
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,642
I'm Mighty Stal Leg.

263
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:57,882
Be serious!

264
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,989
Shaolin kung fu is great!

265
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:03,390
Really great!

266
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,428
Shaolin kung fu is great!

267
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:12,332
Really great!

268
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:14,996
Shaolin kung fu is wonderful!

269
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,005
Wonderful!

270
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:19,303
I'm Mighty Stal Leg!

271
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:21,173
Mighty Stal Leg!

272
00:20:21,313 --> 00:20:24,009
He's Iron Head!

273
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:28,816
Damn it!

274
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,620
What are you singing about?
Your voice seems howling.

275
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:05,120
The lyric is disgusting.

276
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:06,849
I even can't understand
one sentence of this.

277
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:08,391
Yes, of course. Who wrote this lyric?

278
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:10,757
- Who did?
- Who did?

279
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,034
Creative work is highly subjective,

280
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:20,104
but I must follow up your criticism.

281
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,537
Singing is just
the beginning of the show,

282
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:26,269
the climax is the performance of
Mighty Stal Leg and Iron Head!

283
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,708
Iron Head?

284
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:29,675
I had already told you
that you wrote the bad lyric.

285
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:31,715
I'm not Iron Head. He's...

286
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,976
Iron Head?

287
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:34,847
- I said...
- Iron Head?

288
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:36,045
Mighty Stal Leg!

289
00:21:37,189 --> 00:21:38,247
He's Mighty Stal Leg!

290
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,984
You still say Mighty Stal Leg?

291
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,450
Killing you!

292
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:43,754
Mighty Stal Leg!

293
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,561
I'm the real Mighty Stal Leg!

294
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:49,800
Iron Head?

295
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:51,492
Don't you know Chinese? He's the real...

296
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:52,729
Iron Head?

297
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,133
You're so stubborn!

298
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:55,297
Iron...

299
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,932
Do you want to fight back against me?

300
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,644
Thank you so much!

301
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,215
Happy hour is going fast.

302
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,750
It's time for us
to say goodbye right now.

303
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:10,684
Let's listen to music!

304
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:13,086
You crazy guys!

305
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:17,895
Let's see if you can take more!

306
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,223
Thank you!

307
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:22,683
Bullshit!

308
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,225
What?

309
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,748
Go! Nothing interested!

310
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:33,261
Do you still want to fight with us?

311
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,667
I promised my Shaolin master I wouldn't
use kung fu to fight with anyone.

312
00:24:38,804 --> 00:24:41,898
This guy is crazy.

313
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,201
But all you guys should apologize!

314
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:45,640
Apologize?

315
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:48,473
I don't think it's my problem.
It's all yours guy's fault!

316
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:09,656
Don't move! You said you would not
use kung fu to hit anyone.

317
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:23,178
I'm not coming for fighting.
I'm coming for playing soccer.

318
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:32,420
Shit!

319
00:25:37,295 --> 00:25:39,126
You don't need to be so exaggerated!

320
00:25:39,431 --> 00:25:40,659
What?

321
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,562
I'm so sorry!

322
00:26:36,087 --> 00:26:37,748
Do you have some coins right now?

323
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:39,815
Yes.

324
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:44,222
Thirty cents.

325
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:46,085
Are you grabbing my money?

326
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,358
Yes, I am. Did you learn Tong Long Fist?

327
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,398
I did.

328
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:51,593
Don't insult Shaolin kung fu anymore!

329
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:22,095
Would you let me

330
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:23,996
take a look of your leg?

331
00:27:24,536 --> 00:27:28,165
I'm not in the mood. Go ahead!

332
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:41,477
Cool! It's the real, original kung fu.

333
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:51,159
A great killer silm leg.

334
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:54,390
It's Shaolin Mighty Stal Leg!

335
00:27:56,568 --> 00:27:59,401
Is it possible
using kung fu to play soccer?

336
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:02,531
Truly?

337
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:04,073
Yes, of course!

338
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,010
Yeah!

339
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:09,806
It's a great idea
of using kung fu to play soccer.

340
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:11,609
Why did I ever think about that?

341
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,241
Are you the lame?

342
00:28:14,386 --> 00:28:16,183
I'm not just the lame,

343
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,222
I'm the ex-soccer player, Golden Leg.

344
00:28:19,357 --> 00:28:20,790
Today, I'm a soccer coach.

345
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:22,654
It's great!
You should teach me playing soccer.

346
00:28:22,794 --> 00:28:24,091
Hold on.

347
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:25,890
No! You told me I could use
kung fu to play soccer.

348
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:28,294
But I need time to consider!

349
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:30,196
I've no time to think anymore!

350
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:33,765
It's sunset already!

351
00:28:34,072 --> 00:28:36,802
Time doesn't wait for anyone!

352
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,211
But we still need to prepare!

353
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:46,414
I'm ready! What do I need?

354
00:28:47,118 --> 00:28:49,643
At least a pair of shoes!

355
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,020
Do you have money
to get your sneakers back?

356
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:58,595
No. But...

357
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,822
I threw them away.

358
00:28:59,964 --> 00:29:01,090
Oh, my god!

359
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:04,827
Your sneakers were broken.
They're well worn.

360
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:07,563
- Yes, they were broken. But I...
- Go home!

361
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:11,340
My boss will shout at you
when she comes back and sees you.

362
00:29:20,118 --> 00:29:21,278
It's impossible
to get the broken one back.

363
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,410
There is a repaired one.
Do you want to have it?

364
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:50,242
First Big Brother, what are you doing?

365
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:52,008
First Big Brother, are you okay?

366
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:55,677
I'm fine.

367
00:29:57,722 --> 00:29:58,848
What do you want?

368
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,048
I finally got a good idea

369
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:02,785
to develop Shaolin kung fu.

370
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:06,596
This's playing soccer!

371
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,766
Please let me go!

372
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:12,597
You had already got me into trouble.
I was fired.

373
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:15,399
Now, I work at rest room
to pay for my boss's loss.

374
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,871
So I come here to help you.

375
00:30:17,008 --> 00:30:19,568
No! Absolutely not!

376
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:20,939
If you force me anymore,

377
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,206
my whole family will commit suicide
in front of you.

378
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:25,873
Committing suicide is not a good way
to solve any problems.

379
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:26,949
Be brave!

380
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:28,313
Don't be so silly!

381
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,717
I'm a loser!

382
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:31,981
Please don't come here anymore!

383
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,114
If you still want to form a soccer team,
you can call the other Brothers.

384
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:38,127
Please, don't bother me!

385
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:39,387
I beg you!

386
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:41,658
Iron Head.

387
00:30:47,405 --> 00:30:48,736
Good morning, Fourth Big Brother!

388
00:30:49,107 --> 00:30:50,005
Good morning, Sing!

389
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,665
How are you?

390
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,744
Let me introduce
a great guy to you! He's...

391
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,280
Nice to meet you!

392
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,718
This is Fung.

393
00:31:02,854 --> 00:31:05,618
I know, Fung is so famous
in the stock exchange market.

394
00:31:05,757 --> 00:31:07,054
You see! He has a great I.T. look.

395
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:08,216
Fung is a soccer coach.

396
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,690
Soccer coach!

397
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,352
Everyone knows that Fung is the most...

398
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:12,986
...famous figure in the soccer field.

399
00:31:13,131 --> 00:31:14,928
Do you use your legs to play soccer?

400
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:17,466
You see! I'm right.
Actually, do you have any job?

401
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:18,933
I want you to join into my soccer team.

402
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,367
Playing soccer?

403
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,496
I've no job for six months.
How can you ask me to play soccer?

404
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,437
If you can use your Empty Hand...

405
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:25,600
...to be the goalkeeper...

406
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:28,769
What's Empty Hand? It's many years ago.

407
00:31:28,913 --> 00:31:30,540
You know,
I even forgot when our Master died.

408
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:31,910
Please listen to me!

409
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,211
We're going to sign up
the National Soccer Tournament.

410
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,320
The prize is one million dollars.

411
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:39,651
Really? So I say you're the smartest one.

412
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,453
You see! You're dressed up.

413
00:31:42,594 --> 00:31:45,495
Many years ago, our Master
ordered us to develop Shaolin kung fu.

414
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,860
Now, you guys get this great idea
of using Shaolin kung fu...

415
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,057
...to play soccer.

416
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,497
You see!

417
00:31:50,635 --> 00:31:52,262
This's the group picture
of our Master and Brothers.

418
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:53,529
I always keep it under my pillow.

419
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:54,660
You should know what I mean.

420
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:56,865
Great! Let's sit down
to talk about what you mean.

421
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:02,143
I'll call you if I've time.
Remember, please leave a room for me.

422
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:05,873
I really don't have time to talk to you.

423
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:07,917
Some clients waiting for me, I should
keep my eyes on the stock exchange market.

424
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,576
You know, my trading is more than
hundreds thousand dollars each.

425
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,052
Hello! What's the price right now?

426
00:32:11,189 --> 00:32:12,918
Today, my driver is on leave.

427
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,116
I just lend my car to my friend,

428
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,285
and left my wallet in my office.

429
00:32:17,428 --> 00:32:18,656
I'm sorry! I don't have time
to have lunch with you guys.

430
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:19,888
I'm really busy!

431
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:22,431
Get away!

432
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:23,693
Third Big Brother, think about it!

433
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:25,325
If you can use Iron Shirt...

434
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,767
...to be the back...

435
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,738
What's Iron Shirt?

436
00:32:29,874 --> 00:32:32,399
You see! There are
full of planes in the sky.

437
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,168
There are full of computer on the street.

438
00:32:34,312 --> 00:32:36,439
It's the 21 st century.
Please don't live in your daydream!

439
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:39,573
So I think it's a good idea
of combining kung fu with soccer together.

440
00:32:39,717 --> 00:32:41,309
It's true!
The prize is a great deal of money

441
00:32:41,452 --> 00:32:43,181
For Christ sake! You think I'm...

442
00:32:43,388 --> 00:32:44,787
My trading is
hundreds thousand dollars each.

443
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,084
It's absolutely no way to give my trading
up and to play soccer with you guys.

444
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:49,591
I'm sorry. You know, I'm so direct...

445
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:52,821
It's impossible to give my trading up and
to sign up any soccer games with you lame.

446
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:54,693
Forgive me. I'm a honest guy.

447
00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:57,596
Finally, it's also impossible for me
to win the fucking soccer game.

448
00:32:57,735 --> 00:33:00,067
Truly, the probability of winning is 0%.

449
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:01,228
Probabi...

450
00:33:01,372 --> 00:33:03,932
Probability!

451
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:06,066
Okay...

452
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:09,072
It should be head or tail.

453
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:11,112
We'll never get the middle.

454
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:14,115
So the probability is 0%.

455
00:33:14,252 --> 00:33:14,911
Let me try!

456
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:16,850
Get away!

457
00:33:17,422 --> 00:33:18,889
I've an appointment
with my client at coffee shop.

458
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:20,251
I'm very busy!

459
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:22,791
We can serve you to have noodle
at stalling store.

460
00:33:23,194 --> 00:33:25,458
Bullshit! My trading is
hundreds thousands dollars each.

461
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,564
How can I go to have noodle
with you guys?

462
00:33:46,117 --> 00:33:48,745
He's my Sixth Small Brother, Weight Vest.

463
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:51,252
This is the famous soccer coach, Fung.

464
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,721
Fung, how are you?

465
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:56,154
What's Vest?

466
00:33:56,294 --> 00:33:57,591
Weight Vest.

467
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:59,128
Nice to meet you! Mr. Vest.

468
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:02,489
Fifth Big Brother, are you thinking
about playing soccer?

469
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:03,327
Yes.

470
00:34:03,468 --> 00:34:06,164
If you can use Shaolin kung fu,
Weight Vest to be the forward with me.

471
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:08,932
Our attack should be flawless.

472
00:34:09,073 --> 00:34:10,301
- Do you have confidence of this?
- Of course.

473
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:13,535
Great! Is there any pills for diet?

474
00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:15,644
It's useless.

475
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,216
Since the virus get into the cerebellum,
it's no way for me to loose any bounds.

476
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:23,218
After I became like this, I'm not
only unable to use Shaolin kung fu,

477
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:26,846
Weight Vest, but to walk quickly.

478
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:30,755
Yes, you're a little bit fat,
but it's not so important.

479
00:34:30,895 --> 00:34:32,226
Forget it!

480
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:35,791
You see, it was my picture!

481
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:39,232
Since I've become like this,

482
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,860
I even can't date a girl.

483
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:42,800
You don't understand that.

484
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,840
I do. I also can't date a girl!

485
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:46,204
Really?

486
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:48,141
There has been much gossip about
your girls on newspaper and magazine?

487
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:49,405
What's kind of newspaper and magazine?

488
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,708
Oh! I'm sorry!

489
00:34:52,283 --> 00:34:55,275
Since I've this disease,
I can't control myself.

490
00:34:56,854 --> 00:34:58,446
I'm sorry. Please leave me alone!

491
00:34:59,924 --> 00:35:01,084
Small Brother!

492
00:35:02,493 --> 00:35:05,587
You should have confidence!
You can do it!

493
00:35:06,097 --> 00:35:07,689
Now, everyone calls me Lazy Pig...

494
00:35:07,832 --> 00:35:09,732
You know, you're the only one
who call me Small Brother.

495
00:35:13,504 --> 00:35:14,562
Thank you!

496
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:17,538
Lazy Pig, please help me
to pick the red loaf of tissue.

497
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:23,312
The red one!

498
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,794
Playing soccer?

499
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:47,962
Yes, Second Big Brother!

500
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:51,303
If you can use
Hooking Leg to be the back,

501
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:52,431
I believe...

502
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,941
The defense is none of flaw!

503
00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:54,840
Absolutely!

504
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:58,176
Don't you think
I still can use Hooking Leg?

505
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,645
Just need some practice.

506
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:03,583
If you trust yourself,
you will get your Hooking Leg back.

507
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:05,052
Really?

508
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:08,247
I just saw you collecting
excrement and urine recently.

509
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:10,724
Why did you change
your job to wash dishes?

510
00:36:10,862 --> 00:36:12,124
Why?

511
00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:14,956
Why is this your question?
I don't understand, too.

512
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:17,693
Why isn't my dad the richest guy,
Lee Ka Sing?

513
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:21,266
Why am I going blad,
even though I'm so handsome?

514
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:24,306
You guys are not going blad,
but you're so ugly.

515
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:26,273
Why could the other guys
go to school when they were young?

516
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,934
But I was forced
to study the Shaolin kung fu,

517
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,410
and then became a cleaner to wash dishes,

518
00:36:29,547 --> 00:36:33,210
to collect excrement and urine?

519
00:36:33,684 --> 00:36:35,174
Calm down! Second Big Brother.

520
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,787
If you're brave enough,
you can control your fate.

521
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:40,015
Calm down? If I didn't calm down,

522
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:42,592
I would kill you guys!

523
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:45,252
Calm down?

524
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,598
Why have you just sat here?

525
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:50,098
Didn't you smell anything disgusting?

526
00:36:50,234 --> 00:36:52,725
If there's disgusting smell when I come
back, you will clean it with your tongue!

527
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:35,378
Your apartment is great!

528
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:37,806
It's well furnished.

529
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:40,113
I can't imagine you work
as the cleaner at downstairs,

530
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:44,481
but live in the Penthouse
on the 59th floor.

531
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:47,182
You've good taste!

532
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:50,590
This kind of apartment is so popular

533
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:52,992
I can't even get one.

534
00:37:53,264 --> 00:37:56,256
The trough is okay.

535
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,027
Just little bit noisy.

536
00:37:58,169 --> 00:38:01,366
Would you mind if I move here?

537
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:16,485
Forget it!

538
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:19,021
Your Brothers are not good.

539
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:22,057
We can find the others to join our team.

540
00:38:22,193 --> 00:38:25,026
It was all my fault.
I couldn't persuade them.

541
00:38:25,263 --> 00:38:26,890
It's okay.

542
00:38:27,131 --> 00:38:29,622
You know, I'm so glad that you trust me.

543
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:31,394
Thank you.

544
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:35,323
I'll use the shortest period of time
to train all you guys

545
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:37,491
...to be the professional soccer players.

546
00:39:37,635 --> 00:39:41,002
So you should be serious
and mutually support each other.

547
00:39:41,138 --> 00:39:42,298
I understand!

548
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,800
Let's go!

549
00:39:50,915 --> 00:39:52,815
Please listen to me!

550
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,475
What would you do
if you stand on my position?

551
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:57,712
Yes, of course.

552
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,413
I've a call. Hold on a second.

553
00:39:59,557 --> 00:40:01,821
The soccer is coming back!

554
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:09,892
Oh! Are you willing
to come back finally?

555
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:13,197
You let us wait for an hour,
wait for an hour!

556
00:40:15,606 --> 00:40:17,164
What are you doing?

557
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:18,468
Playing soccer!

558
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,770
The soccer is over there!

559
00:40:26,817 --> 00:40:28,580
You, come here!

560
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:31,646
Let me see you kick the soccer here.

561
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:32,817
The soccer is over there.

562
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:34,754
Yes. The soccer is over there!

563
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:38,089
You can't even get the soccer.
How can you kick it from here?

564
00:40:39,363 --> 00:40:41,627
Actually, there are four
basic skills of playing soccer:

565
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:43,563
Pass, stop, hold and kick.

566
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:45,225
- I understand!
- Don't move!

567
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,201
Okay. Start from the beginning.

568
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:50,640
Yours.

569
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,607
Hold it!

570
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:55,837
Watch out!

571
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:01,782
Concentrate!

572
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,045
Come on! Move!

573
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:04,484
Yes... you can do more dummies.

574
00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:06,613
Almost fine. It seems a great dummy.

575
00:41:07,525 --> 00:41:10,289
Do more dummies.

576
00:41:10,895 --> 00:41:12,988
Fung, why can't I take
a part of training?

577
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:14,559
Even though your leg is so strong,

578
00:41:14,698 --> 00:41:17,394
you can't control it freely.

579
00:41:17,535 --> 00:41:19,196
How about if you
kick the soccer into the sky...

580
00:41:19,336 --> 00:41:21,395
and then hit a plane?
Can you pay for it?

581
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:23,404
- No.
- So...

582
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:25,941
Sixth Small Brother! I borrow your eggs!

583
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:27,008
What?

584
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:30,543
If you can control the egg freely
in the air, you can play soccer.

585
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:32,410
- No problem!
- Okay!

586
00:41:34,351 --> 00:41:36,148
Go ahead. It's not easy.

587
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,730
Sixth Small Brother, forget it!

588
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,739
Oh, my god! My egg!

589
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:57,636
I must return it to you in the future!

590
00:41:57,775 --> 00:41:59,333
No way!

591
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:00,944
Give it back to me!

592
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:03,069
Concentrate...

593
00:42:07,351 --> 00:42:09,285
My egg!

594
00:42:24,735 --> 00:42:26,532
Yes! Yes!

595
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,695
Yes! Yes!

596
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:32,671
Yours!

597
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:06,169
Right...

598
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,076
Good...

599
00:43:17,855 --> 00:43:22,451
Yes! Go!

600
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:41,374
Mark that one! Watch out!

601
00:43:41,512 --> 00:43:43,673
How can you let him to kick the soccer?

602
00:43:44,081 --> 00:43:45,639
Kick it!

603
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:47,683
Come on!

604
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:30,291
It's great!

605
00:44:30,494 --> 00:44:33,327
He can just play it by himself.

606
00:44:34,365 --> 00:44:38,267
No! It's teamwork.
It's no way just for one to play soccer.

607
00:44:48,212 --> 00:44:51,807
The game is 30 minutes.
There is no break.

608
00:44:51,949 --> 00:44:53,940
We'll follow the international rules.

609
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:56,382
I'm the referee.
Do you have any questions?

610
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,045
Don't be silly? You know,
how great you Golden Leg plays as referee

611
00:44:59,189 --> 00:45:01,487
and leads a young soccer team
to play with us.

612
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:04,560
We should be glad about that!

613
00:45:04,762 --> 00:45:05,751
This's Fung!

614
00:45:05,896 --> 00:45:06,828
Fung!

615
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:08,090
Okay...

616
00:45:08,232 --> 00:45:11,531
This guy has some struggles
with your team players.

617
00:45:11,669 --> 00:45:14,661
Now, this game is an exchange
of our skills of playing soccer.

618
00:45:14,805 --> 00:45:16,602
It is used to solve this conflict.

619
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,230
You see! They play sincerely.

620
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:21,037
From their tidy uniform
and friendly face,

621
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:24,511
I can deeply fal their sincerity
and the spirit of physical culture.

622
00:45:24,648 --> 00:45:25,842
Thank you!

623
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:29,745
Calm down.

624
00:45:29,887 --> 00:45:31,821
I'm a car repairer.

625
00:45:31,955 --> 00:45:34,924
This crescent wrench
is used to hold for screwing.

626
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:36,048
Does it make sense?

627
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:37,820
Yes, of course.

628
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:41,729
I explained it already.

629
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:43,765
Because I'm a car repairer,

630
00:45:43,901 --> 00:45:45,892
it's all right for me to have a hammer.

631
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,061
Okay. Your team's style...

632
00:45:48,205 --> 00:45:49,866
...is very famous
in the amateur soccer field.

633
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:51,440
I understand.

634
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:53,709
It's just the undeserved reputation.

635
00:45:53,844 --> 00:45:55,038
Seems the cloud in the sky...

636
00:45:55,179 --> 00:45:58,114
Okay. Anyway, take care of yourselves.

637
00:45:58,248 --> 00:45:59,476
Shake hand, please!

638
00:46:28,112 --> 00:46:29,101
Great!

639
00:47:16,326 --> 00:47:18,317
Help!

640
00:48:26,396 --> 00:48:27,829
Third Big Brother!

641
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:57,960
Calling the military base,
we were just suffered the fierce attack.

642
00:48:58,095 --> 00:48:59,119
Ask for reinforcement!

643
00:48:59,263 --> 00:49:00,855
Ask for reinforcement!

644
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,843
Stand up.

645
00:49:16,513 --> 00:49:17,707
Stand up!

646
00:49:17,848 --> 00:49:19,179
Stand up quickly!

647
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,608
Stand up quickly!

648
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,419
What are you doing?

649
00:49:24,855 --> 00:49:25,480
Coach, they are lawless.

650
00:49:25,622 --> 00:49:26,680
Why didn't you stop them?

651
00:49:26,823 --> 00:49:28,723
I'm the referee. I don't stop them.

652
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:31,885
What's the meaning of this?
Do you want us to sacrifice?

653
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:34,326
You! Out!

654
00:49:35,732 --> 00:49:37,324
Are you nuts?

655
00:49:40,404 --> 00:49:41,962
This is a test.

656
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,732
If you guys can't pass it,

657
00:49:43,874 --> 00:49:45,535
it's no way to play soccer anymore!

658
00:49:45,676 --> 00:49:48,509
We're just playing soccer.
We're not fighting in a battle.

659
00:49:49,212 --> 00:49:53,012
The real soccer game is a battle.

660
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:03,984
Surrender!

661
00:50:04,761 --> 00:50:09,994
I surrender!
