1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I surrender!

2
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:17,697
I surrender!

3
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:19,303
If you were brave enough
to ask me playing soccer,

4
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:21,269
why did you surrender?

5
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:22,896
Do you play and loose with me?

6
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:29,911
I can't stand for it anymore.
My bone seems broken.

7
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:32,107
I'm the pitiful creature!

8
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:35,019
Please let me go to see a doctor!

9
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:43,053
Put it onto your head!

10
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:47,660
You see. You look like a dog.

11
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:49,800
Do you have any self-respect?

12
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:51,365
I don't want to see you.

13
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:53,869
Put it onto your head quickly
and go to see a doctor.

14
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:11,522
Yes, I'm a dog.
I don't have any self-respect.

15
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:47,586
First Big Brother is coming back.

16
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:50,217
What?

17
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:54,126
I've a feeling that they are back.

18
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:08,327
- Do we still have any weapons?
- No more!

19
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:09,558
The final attack!

20
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,092
Oh, my God! I couldn't get it.

21
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,929
Help!

22
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:51,440
Thank you! You make us
to get our kung fu back.

23
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:54,534
Thanks for coming back!

24
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,010
Thank you!

25
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:01,142
Don't be like this.

26
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:03,914
I'm the real one who needs
to thank for all you guys.

27
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:09,751
Oh, my God!
I'm going to be rich! Thank you!

28
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,294
We're failed.
Please give us an opportunity...

29
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,454
...to join into your team!

30
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,498
Please!

31
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:22,369
Please, give us a chance.

32
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:32,743
It's a pretty big exploration.

33
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:36,074
The Evil Team'll be
the champion in the world.

34
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:43,880
Who?

35
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:46,187
The lame?

36
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:48,383
- Why not?
- I'm sorry.

37
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:50,494
I've already played
soccer for many years,

38
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:52,892
- You want to stop me?
- The person in charge is not here now.

39
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,123
Golden Leg!

40
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:55,391
What are you doing?

41
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:56,966
- Hung!
- Hung, he...

42
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:57,966
Okay...

43
00:06:58,103 --> 00:07:00,333
Hung, my team wants to sign it up
for the soccer game!

44
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:02,997
It's an open competition,
everyone has the right to sign up.

45
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:04,438
You're wrong.

46
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:05,907
I'm the chairman.

47
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:08,511
I've the right to decide
who can sign it up.

48
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,375
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

49
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:12,005
What's the name of your team?

50
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,580
Come on!

51
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:15,947
This is Hung.

52
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:19,481
Hung!

53
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,029
This is a rare soccer team!

54
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,834
I really want to watch them
playing soccer.

55
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,505
What's the name again?

56
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:40,372
This is Shaolin...

57
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:42,036
OK...

58
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,512
Go and sign it up quickly.
I really want to watch them.

59
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,116
If you need, I can pay
for your application fee.

60
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,650
Thank you!

61
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:52,186
It's okay! You guy, the lame,
is my friendly brother.

62
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:55,723
My shoe is dirty again.

63
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:58,928
White color is easy to get dirty.

64
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,724
So...

65
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:02,930
I help you to clean it up!

66
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,001
I'm good at cleaning. Let me try!

67
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:06,629
This is my duty!

68
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:08,602
Hey! Let me try!

69
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:34,424
Hi!

70
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:40,803
What are you doing?

71
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:42,133
Who are you?

72
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:48,676
Where do we go?

73
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:54,015
Why are you so quiet? I need to go home.

74
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:01,888
I'm waiting for a long time.

75
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:05,223
I'm sorry. Please, wait a moment.

76
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:37,826
Try this.

77
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:40,453
No. I just want to see the quality of it.

78
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:41,997
Touch it.

79
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,463
I'll make it dirty.

80
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,296
- No problem. Go ahead.
- No...

81
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:48,030
- Touch it.
- No.

82
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:53,710
- How about that?
- So smooth.

83
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:57,508
- I promise I'll buy one for you.
- I touched it already. It's enough.

84
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:02,084
Tomorrow, I'll go to play soccer.

85
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,380
Really?

86
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:06,183
I must become a famous star player.

87
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,249
But if you didn't
help me to repair them...

88
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:12,386
I would never play soccer.

89
00:10:12,764 --> 00:10:15,597
You know, you're so important to me.

90
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:18,697
Tell me what you want.

91
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:20,667
I can pay for you very soon.

92
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:28,235
If you become rich and famous,
please buy me sneakers.

93
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,044
No problem!

94
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:34,242
But you should have confidence.

95
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:37,316
Actually, you're a beautiful girl
good at kung fu.

96
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:38,922
You know, you are perfect.

97
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:42,652
You can't let your hair down
and cover your face like this.

98
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:44,620
Come on.

99
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:47,896
- Come on. Look at me.
- No...

100
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:50,023
Look at me!

101
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:53,498
So beautiful!

102
00:10:54,372 --> 00:10:55,669
Really?

103
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,297
Yes, of course.

104
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,778
Is it fly?

105
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:05,974
Yes. But I didn't catch it.

106
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:07,080
Did you catch it already?

107
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:08,685
I did.

108
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,444
I'm sorry. I make your hand dirty.

109
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:11,816
No problem.

110
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:14,891
You know, you're the most beautiful girl.

111
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:18,121
Do you know that?

112
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:19,286
Yes. I do.

113
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,660
Thank you! Thanks so much!

114
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,562
Do you know?

115
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:26,627
Where you go?

116
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:29,831
I let you bring a girl here because
you promised me to clean the store.

117
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:32,408
Hurry up! If you haven't finished
the work on time, I'll be in trouble.

118
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:34,977
Go home. I'll call you later.

119
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,473
Okay?

120
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:45,415
Remember! You should have confidence.
You're the best.

121
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:51,095
I like your shirt.

122
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:52,127
I like your socks, too.

123
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:53,560
- Let's exchange to wear.
- Good...

124
00:11:53,698 --> 00:11:55,256
Hey, guys! Didn't you
ever see this occasion?

125
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,459
Just play as usual as training.

126
00:11:57,602 --> 00:11:59,593
There'll be hundreds of reporters
and audiences outside.

127
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:00,931
You guys should keep smile...

128
00:12:01,072 --> 00:12:02,198
...and let the reporters
take pictures with us.

129
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,605
You also need to say hi and
thank for the audience's support.

130
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:10,476
Thank you!

131
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:11,582
Thank you!

132
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:13,616
Thanks for your support!

133
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:14,547
Thank you!

134
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:15,617
They're just cleaners.

135
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:17,243
Cleaner is also the audience.

136
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,878
Thank you!

137
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:21,651
Shut up!

138
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:24,454
This auditorium is so small and empty.
You said...

139
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:26,085
This is just the first round.

140
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,858
So we should play well
and get into the finals.

141
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,063
- Great! Get into the finals!
- Shut up!

142
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:42,873
Shaolin Team?

143
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,651
Look at this guy!

144
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:54,181
Look at that guy!

145
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:58,559
What happened?

146
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:00,425
No smoking here?

147
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:16,279
What happened?

148
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,611
It's impossible! Just an illusion!

149
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:30,284
What are you doing?

150
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,091
It's okay, just an illusion.

151
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,463
I think we should
show off our real power.

152
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:38,660
Great!

153
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,870
What's wrong?

154
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:55,408
Please don't play like this!
I really want to play soccer!

155
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,414
Hung, it's your call.

156
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:08,457
I'm not scared. It's just an illusion.

157
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,294
What? Forty versus zero?

158
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:56,771
Yeah!

159
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:16,198
Got a goal! Iron Head!

160
00:15:51,102 --> 00:15:53,036
Yes, we use Shaolin kung fu
to play soccer.

161
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,661
So kung fu is great, wonderful!

162
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:56,898
- We lie low...
- And...

163
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,599
I want to thanks for my parents
and my Shaolin master.

164
00:15:58,743 --> 00:15:59,903
Even though they passed away already.

165
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:02,535
I want to thanks for my good friend, Mui.

166
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,511
Mui... How are you?

167
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:07,546
Did you have your dinner already?

168
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:20,021
Hi! Can I help?

169
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:20,960
I want...

170
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:24,329
I understand. Let me take care of you!

171
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:34,144
Would you mind show us your kung fu?

172
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:35,711
Yes, of course, Sixth Small Brother.

173
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:38,114
1, 2, 3!

174
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:40,647
Great!

175
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:42,878
Can you show us one more?

176
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:47,013
- Sure!
- Big Brother, one more please.

177
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:03,405
Take it easy!

178
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,170
My Brothers,

179
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:12,476
today we say bye with our old sneakers.

180
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:18,315
Don't throw anything here!

181
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:20,651
Sorry...

182
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:29,430
Mui?

183
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:30,932
What's up?

184
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:33,337
I can't believe
you are this kind of preson.

185
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:35,902
What is it?

186
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,770
I know what you are doing.

187
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:39,569
What? You are bad.

188
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:41,638
You can't frighten me.

189
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:43,703
I'm not afraid of ghost.

190
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:46,179
What do you mean?

191
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:48,478
Nothing. It's for you.

192
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:58,288
I think...

193
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:00,623
I think I've a little bit difference.

194
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:01,823
Truly.

195
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:05,925
You've confidence right now.

196
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:14,305
I want to tell you something.

197
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:15,742
What's up?

198
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,639
I like you!

199
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:20,580
I like you, too!

200
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:25,921
Is this love?

201
00:18:29,393 --> 00:18:30,792
You...

202
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:33,260
You're kidding.

203
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:37,793
No. I'm serious.

204
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:40,767
Absolutely not. This is not love.

205
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:48,072
We're friends forever...

206
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:50,443
Don't you think it's good for us?

207
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:52,745
Okay! It's fine.

208
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:05,524
So you'll come to see me often?

209
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:08,794
If your shoes are broken,
I'll help you to repair them again.

210
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:12,733
No, thanks. If my shoes are broken,
I must throw them away.

211
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,361
We should look forward to our future.

212
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:18,599
I'll never wear any broken shoes.

213
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:28,776
Don't be like this.

214
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,911
What's wrong? You're crying?

215
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,486
Don't do this.

216
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:49,129
I understand.

217
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,308
Thank you!

218
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:57,276
Come here!

219
00:19:57,414 --> 00:20:01,009
- Mui, you are very nice today.
- Cheers!

220
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:10,689
After winning this,
we'll go to the finals.

221
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:11,692
Go to the finals!

222
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:13,091
But we can't look down our opponent!

223
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,697
Look down our opponent!

224
00:20:18,402 --> 00:20:21,599
We're the real powerful team.

225
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:24,036
I won't let you get into the finals.

226
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,449
Oh, my God! How come?

227
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:36,450
It's the special effects?

228
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:56,991
Good morning, Hung!

229
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:58,432
Good morning!

230
00:21:58,569 --> 00:21:59,763
Come here!

231
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:02,497
You're a lucky guy.

232
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,403
You're so lucky to get this great team.

233
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,405
Thank you.

234
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:09,000
Actually, Iron Head and Iron Shirt
are sorts of performance on the street.

235
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:11,137
It's amusing for your guys
to use kung fu to play soccer

236
00:22:11,315 --> 00:22:12,805
and then to get into the finals.

237
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,009
You did a good job.

238
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:16,811
Don't waste our time!

239
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:22,054
Give up the finals
and join into my Evil Team!

240
00:22:23,227 --> 00:22:26,128
It's not a dishonour check.

241
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:28,857
You can get the money
before sign up with me.

242
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,325
It's lots of money.

243
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:33,527
Probably, I can break my left leg
and then get retired.

244
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:36,572
Sure! We're brothers.

245
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:38,368
Thank you.

246
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,507
But I think I can't take it.

247
00:22:40,844 --> 00:22:44,280
What? Don't you think I'm afraid of you?

248
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:48,875
I think your team has great potential.
So maybe we can join together.

249
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:51,886
Don't be so easily upset.
Think about your future.

250
00:22:52,056 --> 00:22:54,081
Forget the hostility. Okay?

251
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:57,885
Hung, I didn't keep
the hostility in mind.

252
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:02,522
I know, they were all my faults.
I couldn't blame anyone.

253
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:05,498
You're lying!

254
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:09,503
I know you much. You're so greedy!

255
00:23:11,341 --> 00:23:13,332
You're right!

256
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:16,974
I'm so greedy. My team is greedy, too.

257
00:23:17,114 --> 00:23:19,173
But we've not
an insatiable greed for money.

258
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:21,978
We've an insatiable greed
for the champion.

259
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:24,686
See you on the soccer field.

260
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:00,817
Wait! Wait for a moment! Thank you!

261
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,625
Mui!

262
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:09,060
She died already!

263
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:10,593
How come?

264
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,101
I killed her!

265
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:14,033
Oh, no!

266
00:24:14,171 --> 00:24:16,071
Mui is the master-hand of Tai Chi.

267
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,299
She must be treated unjustly!

268
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,342
What do you want?

269
00:24:20,477 --> 00:24:22,308
Revenge!

270
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,010
Don't be silly! It's just a joke!

271
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:27,883
She's still alive.
She just doesn't work here.

272
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:30,285
Why?

273
00:24:30,754 --> 00:24:33,552
You know, my stalling store
is well-known of sweet steamed bread.

274
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,918
But now the steamed bread...

275
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,548
she made becomes salty and bitter.

276
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:38,490
She really ruins my business.

277
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:40,961
I don't have another choice.

278
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:42,326
Salty and bitter?

279
00:24:42,466 --> 00:24:43,990
Yes.

280
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:46,898
What's your name? Can I help?

281
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,673
No, thanks.

282
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,611
It's time to go!

283
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,617
Boss, how many goals
do you expect to get today?

284
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:45,024
Getting goal is not the only way to win.

285
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:48,321
I've a great idea to get win.

286
00:30:26,388 --> 00:30:27,821
Impossible.

287
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:35,327
I can't imagine how wonderful
of the American medication!

288
00:30:56,351 --> 00:30:58,319
Actually the referee, linesman,

289
00:30:58,453 --> 00:31:01,911
soccer association, soccer federation
and soccer committee...

290
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:04,251
all stand on my side.

291
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:06,258
How can they fight with me?

292
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:42,057
No problem!

293
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,929
- Great!
- Fit!

294
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:47,793
Wonderful!

295
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:48,257
Throw-in?

296
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:50,490
He did it on purpose.

297
00:32:50,632 --> 00:32:53,465
How could you judge to be throw-in?

298
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:56,694
Hung, you're fighting or playing soccer?

299
00:32:56,838 --> 00:32:58,965
Yes, we are. So what?

300
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:02,270
I should break all you guys' legs
and let you become cripples.

301
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:04,641
Cripples! Cripples! Cripples!

302
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,042
How dare you fight with me?

303
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,341
I'm sorry. I should take a break.

304
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:13,647
It's okay. You just physically leave us,

305
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:15,780
but your spirit
will keep in our mind forever.

306
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:36,443
Bend over! It's my turn.

307
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,122
Sixth Small Brother!

308
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:36,265
What's wrong? Why don't you stop it?

309
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:45,242
All you guys are badly injured
after the first half match.

310
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,472
How can you play the second one?

311
00:34:46,615 --> 00:34:49,209
Go home! It's no way for you guys
to play the second half!

312
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:50,511
Nothing interested!

313
00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:53,212
Maybe I can go down to dance for a show.

314
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:56,449
No! It's not your turn. It's mine!

315
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,129
Bullshit!

316
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:22,978
Get out!

317
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:24,913
You guys don't want to play anymore!

318
00:35:26,087 --> 00:35:27,782
Who did it?

319
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:29,078
Anyone saw it?

320
00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:32,459
Hit my face, if you're brave enough!

321
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:35,058
Rub gently.

322
00:35:35,196 --> 00:35:37,790
I can't imagine
they're much lawless than me.

323
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,332
I can't believe that...

324
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:41,628
my reputation was ruined.

325
00:35:42,504 --> 00:35:45,667
I've already known that
they must do something for us,

326
00:35:45,807 --> 00:35:47,468
but I can't imagine they are so cruel.

327
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:49,133
Evil Team is not so terrific.

328
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:51,609
They must take pills or have injection.

329
00:35:51,746 --> 00:35:53,475
Call police!

330
00:35:53,615 --> 00:35:54,547
Anyway,

331
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:55,944
we should try our best to keep going.

332
00:35:56,084 --> 00:35:57,483
We'll get the final win!

333
00:35:57,619 --> 00:35:59,678
My house is on fire, I need to run!

334
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:01,049
I'm sorry. My mom is
per mature birth right now.

335
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:02,747
I should go home to take care of her.

336
00:36:03,191 --> 00:36:04,180
Can you ask her to wait
until the end of the game?

337
00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:05,884
You can't give it up!

338
00:36:06,027 --> 00:36:07,824
They're not playing soccer.
They're killing us!

339
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:09,931
I beg you. Please don't leave us!

340
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:11,555
I beg you back.

341
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:12,722
Please let me go!

342
00:36:15,503 --> 00:36:18,438
Calm down!

343
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:20,507
Calm down!

344
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:24,642
Yes, he's right!

345
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:28,647
We should keep going.

346
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:30,410
Now, we just have eight players.

347
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:32,383
If there is one more injured,

348
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,647
we'll fail.

349
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:37,689
We must try our best
to fight for the killer kick.

350
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:40,488
How come? If you fight for
one killer kick, I'll fight for three.

351
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:42,153
What are you talking about?

352
00:36:43,865 --> 00:36:46,800
Calm down!

353
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:48,061
Calm down!

354
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:49,534
Shut up!

355
00:36:56,177 --> 00:36:58,168
I'm not sure if I can fight for it.

356
00:37:15,296 --> 00:37:17,025
Shaolin Lou Han Array!

357
00:37:19,968 --> 00:37:21,526
Array?

358
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:27,031
Can't stand for a shot!

359
00:37:28,243 --> 00:37:30,336
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

360
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:10,850
Chun!

361
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:12,850
- Tin?
- Yes.

362
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:14,982
I've kept a secret
in my mind for many years,

363
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:17,717
but I really want
to tell you at this moment.

364
00:38:17,926 --> 00:38:20,918
Chun, I love you!

365
00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:08,705
Do you think if we're so cruel?

366
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,877
- I don't think so!
- Really?

367
00:39:12,013 --> 00:39:14,140
So we can be harsher.

368
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:48,506
Brothers! Go!

369
00:39:49,384 --> 00:39:50,783
What?

370
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:56,480
Be careful!

371
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,947
Watch out!

372
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:28,145
Shit!

373
00:40:53,648 --> 00:40:56,708
Hurry up! Don't act injured!

374
00:40:56,851 --> 00:40:59,877
You're so smart! I'm fine.

375
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:07,926
Time is almost out! Use the final attack!

376
00:41:08,129 --> 00:41:09,460
Final attack?

377
00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:43,288
It's useless for you guys...

378
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,762
...to stall for time.

379
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,358
Win!

380
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:53,231
Shaolin Team.

381
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,775
Now, you just leave seven players.

382
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,741
If you don't have any substitute players,

383
00:41:57,879 --> 00:41:59,437
I'll stop the game...

384
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,979
and announce that the game's over.

385
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:07,914
Any substitute players?

386
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:12,759
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

387
00:42:15,129 --> 00:42:16,255
My turn!

388
00:42:17,565 --> 00:42:19,328
I'm the substitute player.

389
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,760
I'm the goalkeeper.

390
00:42:27,575 --> 00:42:29,941
Why did you make up as E.T.?

391
00:42:30,478 --> 00:42:33,379
I don't know how to cut my hair,
so it will be good for me to shave it.

392
00:42:33,514 --> 00:42:34,879
For what?

393
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:36,539
I want to help you.

394
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:37,742
How can you do that?

395
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:39,318
Go back to the Mars,

396
00:42:39,454 --> 00:42:41,012
the Earth is so dangerous.

397
00:42:41,155 --> 00:42:42,087
I really want to help you.

398
00:42:42,223 --> 00:42:43,451
Trust me! Let me try!

399
00:42:43,591 --> 00:42:47,186
- No way!
- You see,

400
00:42:47,328 --> 00:42:48,693
your shoes were broken.

401
00:42:50,898 --> 00:42:52,024
Put these on.

402
00:43:38,012 --> 00:43:38,944
The opposite side.

403
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:52,755
Go!

404
00:43:53,494 --> 00:43:54,290
Great!

405
00:44:09,844 --> 00:44:11,004
Watch out!

406
00:46:19,974 --> 00:46:22,704
What happened?

407
00:46:22,843 --> 00:46:24,140
What happened?

408
00:46:24,278 --> 00:46:25,745
Boss, watch out?

409
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,575
Damn it!

410
00:46:30,785 --> 00:46:33,845
Boss!

411
00:46:34,488 --> 00:46:36,820
Boss!

412
00:48:01,475 --> 00:48:06,003
Shaolin win the champion.

413
00:48:08,182 --> 00:48:10,241
Evil team use drug permenant suspension.

414
00:48:10,384 --> 00:48:13,581
Leader Hung was sent 5 years in jail.

415
00:49:30,831 --> 00:49:36,201
Wait! Stop it!
