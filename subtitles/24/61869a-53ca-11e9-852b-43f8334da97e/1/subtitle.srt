1
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:38,228
Five hundred dollars
for the death of Chen kuo-wei

2
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,052
Friend

3
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:06,493
Please stop, you're wasting your energy

4
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:15,497
Are you Chen kuo-wei of Quadruple Door?

5
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,110
Yes, who are you?

6
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,276
I'm Yen Tieh-hsin

7
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,045
So you're the Hades Kick

8
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:32,557
The kick which has never been beaten?

9
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,287
You're right

10
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:41,256
Someone pays me to kill you

11
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,096
You and I haven't met before
Who wanna kill me?

12
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,333
I can pay you double to kill him

13
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:52,402
You can, but killing is my profession

14
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,312
I've to keep my words

15
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,678
So I must kill you first

16
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,380
You're too arrogant

17
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,478
I've never lost before

18
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,352
You may not win

19
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,320
I don't care who you are

20
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,155
I'll break your hands first

21
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,439
Hsien

22
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,476
What's the matter, master?

23
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,983
I'm going out, keep an eye on them

24
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,451
Sure

25
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,994
Stop it

26
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,390
We won't practise this today

27
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:58,760
Let's practise the Fist of Five Styles
which I taught you few days ago

28
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,531
Dozing again

29
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,471
Cheeky

30
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,405
Pointless

31
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,298
Start now

32
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,406
Appearance of Dragon & Tiger

33
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,709
Two Tigers, White Snake

34
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,984
Panther & Fire, White Crane

35
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,454
Hold it

36
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,587
Your wrists are too weak

37
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,497
You can't learn it well, understand?

38
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:08,336
How dare you fool me?

39
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:12,476
Fooling me... Not me!

40
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,012
Who's he?

41
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,570
Say it

42
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,411
Naughty Panther

43
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,984
Naughty Panther

44
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,293
Though Mentor Wong is your father

45
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,489
you should never cause trouble here

46
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,533
All because your kung-fu is too vague

47
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,399
You mean that my kung-fu is very bad?

48
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,663
Not too bad but useless

49
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,407
How useless is it?

50
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,546
Your Panther & Fire

51
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,373
It isn't bad

52
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,143
You've exposed your body
easy to be attacked

53
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:58,084
Your foot-work is too loose
Just a kick

54
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,662
and you'll fall

55
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,763
Naughty Panther
you've taught Hsien a lesson

56
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,474
We all feel very happy about it

57
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,443
He's too arrogant, I can't stand it

58
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,415
You've vented our anger

59
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,117
That's great...

60
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,094
Eat more then

61
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,526
No, I'm talking about that girl

62
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:42,057
What a charming face
very pretty indeed

63
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,663
How much? 30 cents

64
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,762
Not bad

65
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,634
Too good if I can kiss her

66
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,202
That's easy

67
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,405
I'll make her hug and kiss me

68
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,141
Liar I won't believe you

69
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,608
Let's take a dinner to bet then

70
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,379
Deal

71
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:04,685
Be careful!
You'll be sent to jail if she sues you

72
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,717
Just watch out Don't worry

73
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:14,995
Just watch

74
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,627
He's dead man

75
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:24,573
This flower is beautiful
Trust me, try it on

76
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,112
I'm sorry, sir

77
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,204
My eyes hurt

78
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,406
What can I do?

79
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,641
Something got into my eyes

80
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:33,617
Help me get rid of it, miss. Please, hurry

81
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,620
Not yet

82
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,550
Yes good

83
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:41,990
Thanks

84
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,762
Snake

85
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,687
Snake?

86
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,625
Don't be afraid...
I'll kill it. Don't be afraid

87
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,266
It's great
I'll do the same thing on your sister

88
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,574
My sister?

89
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,740
How dare you flirt my daughter!

90
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:10,587
I didn't, she hugged me first, bitch

91
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,281
Mother

92
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,225
Save it, I saw everything over there

93
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,185
Who'll flirt an ugly duck like her!

94
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,726
Time to teach you a lesson

95
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,174
Good, not bad

96
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,077
You're good fighter

97
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,106
Watch out

98
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,698
What a fierce woman

99
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,696
Come on

100
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,205
You're all ruthless bastards!

101
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,780
Man won't argue with bitch, excuse me

102
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,122
Give me back my jade

103
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,661
You broke my jade! Pay me back!

104
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,569
Pay? No way

105
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,673
Father...

106
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,408
You must pay me

107
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,615
What happened?

108
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,186
He's broken my jade
but refused to pay me

109
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,321
Beast, go away

110
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,027
Who're you talking to?

111
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,085
You

112
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,201
Pay him immediately

113
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,794
Pay? I don't know how to pay

114
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,804
Good, I'm just looking for someone
to vent my anger

115
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:15,309
Let me teach you how to pay

116
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,291
Get up

117
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,079
Wanna kill me?

118
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,786
I'm doomed, I'm dead

119
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,020
Don't be afraid, it's just the back

120
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,226
I won't kill you, don't move

121
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,707
Please spare me...

122
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,004
Not yet...

123
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,708
Got you now

124
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,449
Fainted that easy?

125
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:19,003
Sometimes my attacks
aren't very accurate

126
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,303
Watch out

127
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,134
I chop... I chop meat

128
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,410
I hit... I hit a cucumber

129
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,448
I twine... I twine a garlic paste

130
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,710
I wouldn't know how good I'm
if we didn't fight today

131
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:44,759
It's been ages, bro
You still look great

132
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:50,194
Your bro is old now
What a beautiful niece I've got

133
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,262
She's still a kid

134
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,066
Where's Hung?

135
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,437
This naughty guy always goes to play

136
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,481
He's a young man now

137
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,748
I think you may not recognize him now

138
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,415
This time, stay longer

139
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,179
Hung, don't go away

140
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,148
Come to greet your auntie and cousin

141
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,496
Come here, now

142
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,222
Coming...

143
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,788
Shit!

144
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,501
Come to greet your auntie

145
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,241
Auntie, cousin

146
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:35,579
Cousin

147
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,047
Hung

148
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,208
What happened to your neck?

149
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,783
I... I slept without a pillow

150
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,347
Without a pillow? Let me help you

151
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,284
No thanks, auntie

152
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,156
Come on, relax

153
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,292
Auntie

154
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,361
Auntie

155
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,131
Feel better now?

156
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,230
Yes

157
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,540
Brother, Hung really looks smart

158
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,138
He's quite tactful and clever

159
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,609
Brother, you're really a good father

160
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,513
Yes, I'm very strict to him

161
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:21,587
No wonder I heard people praising him
as soon as I came here

162
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,426
Really? What did they say?

163
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:28,557
The son of Huang Chi-ying is very smart

164
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,397
He's also a man of justice

165
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,138
I'm very proud of him

166
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,104
Come here my son, come here

167
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,601
Sit down

168
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:47,241
But there're many sex maniacs
in this village

169
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:53,420
A bad guy harassed your niece

170
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,627
on the street just now

171
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,355
he beat me too

172
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:03,225
Who dare do this to my relatives?

173
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,360
Can you recognize him
if you see him again?

174
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,540
Sure I can

175
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,109
Good, let's find him now

176
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,370
I'll teach him a real good lesson
Hung, come with me

177
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,148
Uncle

178
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,315
You don't have to go out

179
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,181
Why?

180
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,311
That guy is here

181
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,353
Who?

182
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,649
He's your son Huang Fei Hung

183
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,661
You...

184
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,229
You...

185
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,595
Son-of-bitch...

186
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,228
Kneel down

187
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,572
Father

188
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,639
You bastard, I'm so angry

189
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,244
Huang Chi-ying

190
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,309
I'm doomed

191
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,322
Huang Chi-ying

192
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,196
Mentor Li, is someone looking for cure?

193
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,135
I'm looking for your son

194
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,267
Why?

195
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,105
Your son beat my son irrationally

196
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,310
You see the bandages? He hurts so badly

197
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,580
It's just a waste to heal him

198
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,226
Huang Chi-ying, we want your son?

199
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,458
You beast, I must kill you

200
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,193
No, Dad... no...

201
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,466
Brother, you'll kill him

202
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:49,405
Yes, because I'm too angry

203
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:55,240
But they'll think that
you won't have your son tortured

204
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,150
Mentor Li doesn't come to witness
how you punish your son

205
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,543
but to punish him with his own hands

206
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,389
Don't move...

207
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,285
It's all me
I'll let your son beat me back

208
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,197
Take this

209
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,326
I've given you a chance
It's you who let it go

210
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,338
You dare say this at this time

211
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,197
Huang Chi-ying, you indulge your son

212
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,538
I'll just abandon him

213
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,645
Just do anything you want

214
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,547
Mentor Li, how about let Hung

215
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,321
stand this mentor's 10 strikes
without any resistance?

216
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,793
He deserves it if he dies

217
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,294
If not, just put it into an end

218
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,399
I don't need 10 strikes to kill him

219
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,598
Young Master
I'll take the revenge for you

220
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:01,436
Mentor Chao
beat him to be as badly as I'm

221
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,734
How many strikes in total?

222
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,806
You want to cut off my posterity?

223
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,522
Stop it

224
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,063
It's already 10 strikes

225
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,092
You said you'll kill me within 3 strikes

226
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,701
A Crane & a Snake

227
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,436
A Secret Attack

228
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,480
I'll fight back if you don't stop

229
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,509
My clothes get dirty, take it

230
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,559
You comes for the revenge?

231
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:06,654
It's me

232
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,165
You hit your master

233
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,105
Young Master, are you alright?

234
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,071
Young master, are you ok?

235
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,506
My baby, are you alright?

236
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,634
Young Master Go to hell

237
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:34,082
Young Master
I hurt as badly as you now

238
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,061
Huang Chi-ying, you're somebody

239
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,861
but I ain't ordinary person
just wait and see

240
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,725
Let's go!

241
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,158
You watch out!

242
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,798
Take Young Master home, hurry

243
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,809
Do come back

244
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,674
Be careful

245
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,811
Now two of them are badly hurt

246
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:03,711
Are you very proud of yourself?
I'll kill you now

247
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,620
Brother

248
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,725
It's useless
to beat this naughty panther

249
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,560
Let's punish him by practising kung-fu

250
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,461
You really piss me off

251
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,691
From today, you can't go out

252
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,097
and do 6-hour foot-work everyday

253
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:10,653
Don't move

254
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,884
Be careful, this water is hot

255
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:25,295
So, feeling good now?

256
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:34,678
You're trembling, I feel very happy now

257
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,839
So happy...

258
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:48,190
You feel itchy? Let me help you

259
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,796
Stop, don't go too far!

260
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,734
I don't, your father asked me
to keep an eye on you

261
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:06,335
You'll have to stand 2 more hours
if you break one single bowl

262
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:07,742
You deserve it

263
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,761
Master, you come back

264
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,736
Your foot-work is fine

265
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,637
Did he slack off?

266
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,900
No, I've been watching him

267
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,111
Really? Yes

268
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,407
Show progress finally

269
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,882
Yes, I'm very tired

270
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,379
Are you really tired?

271
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,884
But you got a chair Yes

272
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,859
What? A chair, let me see

273
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,362
Damn it, a chair

274
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,824
You dare cheat me
when I'm punishing you

275
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,801
I really can't do anything about you

276
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,875
I'll ask your uncle to come tomorrow
and fix you

277
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,909
Who's he?

278
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,169
Beggar Su

279
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,751
It hurts!

280
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,269
Eat

281
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,304
Master's asked Beggar Su to fix you

282
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,271
Yes

283
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,744
You're miserable then

284
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,708
Why?

285
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,339
Do you know anything about Beggar Su?

286
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,243
He's very cunning

287
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:04,783
All his students have become cripples

288
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,288
Really?

289
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,350
Well, you can try

290
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:13,759
Nau was his student
and you know what happened to him?

291
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,224
What?

292
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,800
He lost all his teeth and hair

293
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,271
His nose is twisted
even his father can't recognize him

294
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,333
That monster likes torturing people
Sick guy

295
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,181
What should I do then?

296
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,374
You think about it yourself

297
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,913
Shit! You got to help me

298
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,898
The 36th Method

299
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,298
Run

300
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,833
You're clumsy

301
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:55,463

Eat buns...

306
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,828
Can I sit here?

307
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,462
Yes...

308
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,804
Are you Chaochowese? Me too

309
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,105
Friends... please Please...

310
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,510
The food is very good

311
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,511
They all look good and taste good

312
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,908
Really good

313
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,385
Good

314
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,388
Sir...

315
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,626
Why you're alone? Where's Old Shang?

316
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,590
You eat first, eat

317
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,796
What would you like to eat?

318
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,257
A bowl of shark's fin as appetizer

319
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:59,132
Sorry, we got no shark's fin

320
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,136
It's too bad

321
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:00,534
Then I want a roasted left goose leg

322
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:01,537
Left leg...

A chicken and a steamed grouper

324
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,171
Sorry, we got no grouper

325
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,644

332
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,214

Excuse me, goodbye... Enjoy

352
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:11,728
Sir, 1.99 dollars please

353
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,290
Someone will pay the bill

354
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,594
Who?

355
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,662
The old man who's eating with me

356
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,243
You know him?

357
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,371
He's my father

358
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,679
Your father?

359
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,545
How many fathers do you have?

360
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,686
He's the boss of this inn
and I'm his son

361
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,347
So you're his illegitimate son?

362
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:46,219
So you don't want to pay now?
Look there

363
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,534
No
I've just forgotten to bring the money

364
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:02,238
I'll come tomorrow and I'll pay you then

365
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,519
Kingkong, beat him

366
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:44,777
Tiger's Claw

367
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,822
Stop it, let's talk

368
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,552
Stop it

369
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,456
Don't fight, we're friend, don't fight

370
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:30,558
It's okay to beat friends

371
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,468
I'll get back what you've eaten
Get him!

372
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,574
Roasted goose's leg

373
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,579

374
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,650
Soyed pork

375
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,846
Damn it

376
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,781
Also half a catty of Shaoshing wine

377
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:01,154
No... I'm dying

378
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,837
Stop it. That's enough
I've thrown all up

379
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:19,513
Enough
Enough? He's to do the toilet cleaning for us

380
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,482
I can't stand it anymore

381
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,495
Thanks

382
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,368
You dare interfere with our affairs

383
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,564
Just watch, I can jump

384
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,409
Take it

385
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,608
It's hot, isn't it?

386
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,279
Stop eating

387
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,482
We're friends Who's your friend?

388
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:20,770
You're nimble but stupid

389
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,242
Go away, kid

390
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:28,608
I must beat you

391
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,485
Go...

392
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:55,965
Old guy, you're really tough

393
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:01,645
Certainly, or how can I survive?

394
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:05,682
Just look at you
you're weak and useless

395
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,212
It's just an accident

396
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,326
If I hadn't fallen into the trap

397
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,185
I'd have beaten them

398
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,697
It's just an excuse

399
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,861
How come you're so miserable?

400
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,898
couldn't pay the bill?

401
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,237
That's a long story

402
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,903
May I know your name?

403
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:35,245
I'm Su

404
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,284
I feel very angry
when I hear the name Su

405
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,354
It's all his fault

406
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:45,786
Who're you talking about?

407
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,688
It's that Beggar Su

408
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,193
My father asked him to come
and fix me up

409
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,556
So you're afraid of him

410
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,730
Afraid? Of course not

411
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,737
It's heard that
he's vicious and cunning

412
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,272
That old bastard...

413
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,167
I'll teach him a lesson someday

414
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:08,905
You'll have the chance

415
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,374
Well, where do you work?

416
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,179
Me? I have no work

417
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,224
So you're beggar?

418
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:23,557
Yes, I'm Beggar Su

419
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,954
I see...

420
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,358
Beggar Su

421
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,764
Exactly

422
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,691
Better go now

423
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,764
You can't go now

424
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,833
I've received your father's money
I've to do my job

425
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:12,841
You can't go away

426
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:20,779
How long do I need to learn from you?

427
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:23,785
A day?

428
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:24,852
A year

429
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:26,311
I'm doomed then

430
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,334
I quit and you've got the money
Profits are all yours

431
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,996
You wanna quit? I wanna teach you

432
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:42,303
You old bastard

433
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,824
Do you dare release me?

434
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:17,468
You old bastard
don't ever underestimate me

435
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,902
Let me show you Tiger-conquering Fist

436
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,185
This is Tiger-conquering Fist?

437
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,687
Tiger-like Fist

438
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,844
It's great, isn't it?

439
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,432
Tiger-conquering Fist?
I think it's Conquered Fist

440
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:17,524
Crane Fist

441
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,527
Crane's Beak

442
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:22,904
Fed-up Crane

443
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:24,539
Crane Waiting for Shrimps...

444
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,941
Shrimps... Flying Crane

445
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:48,695
I'm coming

446
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,201
You scare me

447
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,562
You're scared to climb up a tree

448
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:59,265
What? I'm just using the Monkey's Fist

449
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:29,773
Wanna follow me?

450
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,570
Answer me. Answer me

451
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,803
Please stop

452
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,435
Answer me, now!

453
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:40,480
Okay...
Nobody will find a student by force

454
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,421
Wanna escape?

455
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,429
I wanna piss

456
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:02,827
Do it there There

457
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,382
From right to left

458
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,850
Then back to right

459
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:34,658
Back to the front

460
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,305
Left to the right

461
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,577
Right to the front

462
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,616
Left to right, right to left

463
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,747
I can never finish it

464
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,861
Just go on

465
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,593
So harsh to me? Fine

466
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,563
Hung...

467
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:56,041
Old guy, wash yourself

468
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,408
Go away, kid

469
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:35,781
Do you hear me? Go away

470
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,245
Can't you see I'm busy

471
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,684
What a stubborn bastard

472
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,629
Is this your place?

473
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:48,989
How about if I don't leave?

474
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,463
You're so cheeky

475
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:56,495
and so naive about the world

476
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,273
Comfortable?

477
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,551
No, you're a wicked person

478
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,451
I'm good at fixing wicked people

479
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:23,766
Come on...

480
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:45,878
You shouldn't be too arrogant
with such bad kung-fu

481
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,717
Who's your master?

482
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,619
My father teaches me

483
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:09,736
Then
your father mustn't be a good fighter

484
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:12,509
Maybe I'll let him be my follower

485
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,716
I think you'd better call me father

486
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:21,789
Go to hell

487
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:30,958
Sit down

488
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:32,835
Get up

489
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,770
Sit down again

490
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,741
Good boy

491
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,682
Go to hell

492
00:49:58,061 --> 00:49:59,619
Take my shoes

493
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,257
Oh...

494
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:32,693
Don't come here

495
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:37,766
You've become a turtle now

496
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,377
I'll surely beat you now

497
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:59,314
You can never beat me
with this bad kung-fu

498
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,272
Killing a nobody like you...

499
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,806
would only defame my reputation

500
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,071
Crawl between my legs

501
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,972
and never return

502
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,909
Crawl

503
00:51:56,513 --> 00:52:00,916
Wait, is this your trousers?

504
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,393
You shouldn't be too arrogant
with such bad kung-fu

505
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,801
Then
your father mustn't be a good fighter

506
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,974
Take my shoes

507
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,915
I'll surely beat you now

508
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:12,749
You can never beat me
with this bad kung-fu

509
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,739
Killing a nobody like you...

510
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,433
would only defame my reputation

511
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,545
Crawl between my legs

512
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,575
and never return

513
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,405
Crawl

514
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:02,623
You idiot, this wine is very expensive

515
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:05,826
It smells good

516
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:08,637
Master, I'll dry your clothes

517
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,854
Why are you so sexy?

518
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,639
The clothes got fire...

519
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,536
On fire...

520
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:52,912
It's my only suit

521
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,677
My backbone

522
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:54,835
My wrist

523
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,673
You're not strong enough

524
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:09,849
There's no good dish
and the tea's too cold

525
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:11,616
Cold...

526
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,823
My head hurts, master

527
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,522
Have your meal

528
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:29,335
You're so tired
that can't even use your chopsticks?

529
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,425
Master, all the stuff is done

530
00:58:58,401 --> 00:58:59,425
So quick?

531
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:03,738
Take it back from upstairs

532
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,735
Hurry

533
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:11,413
I shouldn't have made it so full

534
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:19,947
Oh my god

535
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:30,822
Hung, help me to break walnuts

536
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:38,898
You break it like this

537
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,008
Like this

538
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:46,131
Master, it's too hard even for a monkey

539
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,510
Let's go for a walk outside

540
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:51,707
Good...

541
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:55,383
Stack...

542
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,921
Master, you're smart Of course

543
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:14,868
Don't miss it... I'll take this

544
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,072
Old guy, you should leave now

545
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:22,504
Leave?
How can I buy good wine with so little money

546
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:28,443
I have to win more, I stake on this

547
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:34,012
Come on, stake... believe me, stake

548
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:42,329
Open it... What?

549
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:43,526
Don't dare

550
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,857
Open it...

551
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:48,028
Scared? Shut up

552
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:52,839
Open it

553
01:01:54,043 --> 01:02:01,609
You're amazing, master Sure

554
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:03,042
That's great

555
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,113
Put down your bets...

556
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,083
We're getting rich. It's easy

557
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,549
Lucky you

558
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:10,917
I'll play with you

559
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:13,357
in one go

560
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,828
Alright, we'll make a good fortune today

561
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,967
Come on

562
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:43,949
Stake

563
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:45,084
Good

564
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,465
Open

565
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:05,437
I'm sorry

566
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:08,017
What's it?

567
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:11,475
You're nimble
but I got good eye-sight too

568
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,484
So you're a swindler

569
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:25,026
Police is here, run!

570
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:38,045
You filthy thief, give me back the money

571
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:41,344
You can never get back your money
from a swindler

572
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:43,017
Do you know who I'm?

573
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,551
Do I have to?

574
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,686
You'll be surprised if I tell you

575
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,685
I'm the Iron-head Rat

576
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,051
Really like indeed

577
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,363
Very hard indeed

578
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:57,691
Scared?

579
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,397
Don't go

580
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:04,604
Give me back the money
no matter who you're

581
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:05,663
I'm not afraid of you

582
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:11,477
No one dare say this to me

583
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,114
You don't want to live, do you?

584
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,677
I'll let you try my iron head

585
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,687
Your heart

586
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,363
Your lung

587
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:37,929
Master, his head is too strong

588
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,573
Don't give up

589
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:41,637
Now you know how good I'm

590
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:51,544
It's fun

591
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,369
Good, very good

592
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:37,760
You've knocked into my trousers

593
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,441
Watch out...

594
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:12,629
A hammer for an iron head, alright?

595
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,422
How can you bear?

596
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,823
It's unbearable!

597
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,506
Master, I can't bear...

598
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,067
Lazy No...

599
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:31,072
My hands' gonna break

600
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:38,517
Let's stop now, buy me some wine

601
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:40,612
Buy some wine?

602
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,060
Waiter Coming

603
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:55,398
What do you want?

604
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:58,634
Give me three...
Three catties of wine?

605
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:02,572
No, 3 taels of Shaoshing wine, hurry

606
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:03,942
3 taels?

607
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,778
Hurry up, don't just stand here

608
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:13,882
Right

609
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,681
What takes that kid so long
to buy some wine?

610
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,158
Idiot

611
01:08:58,534 --> 01:08:59,694
That's him

612
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:09,166
Old guy, who are you?

613
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:11,812
Who are you then?

614
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,917
I'm King of Stick Hsu Ching-tien
Do you know me?

615
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:25,020
Yes, I have
You ever heard of Beggar Su then?

616
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,518
Beggar Su?

617
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:28,888
It's me

618
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:31,855
Go

619
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,497
Don't go, he doesn't look like Beggar Su

620
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:36,003
What?

621
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:37,496
Look

622
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:44,805
He's trembling
he isn't the real Beggar Su

623
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:53,681
Well, how dare you cheat me

624
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,984
What's for? I'm the real Beggar Su

625
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,957
Still so stubborn?

626
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:53,648
Master

627
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:54,875
Give me the wine

628
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:05,794
It's water

629
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,737
Idiot, you harm yourself

630
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:48,568
Master

631
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:25,699
If I meet you again

632
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:27,765
I must kill you, go

633
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:55,801
What? You're beaten too seriously?

634
01:12:56,839 --> 01:13:00,775
Master, it's all my fault

635
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,141
It's all because of you

636
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:08,710
You've made me lose my face

637
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,842
I've never had such humiliation before

638
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:12,850
It's not because you couldn't beat him

639
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:15,582
just you didn't drink enough

640
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,783
Now you know

641
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:21,229
But I'm so useless

642
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:24,824
or I'll surely
kick the King of Stick out

643
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:28,962
Then you're blaming me
for not teaching you?!

644
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:34,166
You've taught me minor things only

645
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:35,974
and how to stand beating

646
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:46,748
Your father Huang Chi-ying is an expert

647
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:49,916
of all kinds of kung-fu

648
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:53,653
How can I teach his son?

649
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,625
He wants you to torture me

650
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,161
Your father's given you to me

651
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:03,733
because he knows
I have good kung-fu skills

652
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,168
What skills?

653
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,734
The 8 Drunken Gods

654
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:13,408
It's nothing special

655
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:15,717
You won't understand how great it is

656
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:18,978
Many people asked me
to teach them in the last decades

657
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:20,885
but I turned them all down

658
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:59,658
Don't ever think that
I can't stand still

659
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:04,891
In fact
I'm trying to beat my opponent with surprises

660
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:26,944
How?

661
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,790
Why don't you teach me then?

662
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:33,157
Didn't your father tell you that...

663
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,930
foundation is very important

664
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,967
I do this because I want you to have

665
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:42,865
a good foundation

666
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,465
It's really the right time now

667
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:47,742
Really?

668
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:52,006
You should be a bit drunk
to learn the Drunken Fist

669
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:56,781
Have a drink first

670
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:05,449
One more

671
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,434
Hung, have you ever been to school?

672
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,071
I've spent a few years
in a private school

673
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,735
In with the wine

674
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,737
May our cups never rest

675
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,047
For I'll sing you a song

676
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:29,008
Please listen with your ears open

677
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:33,779
Power and wealth are no avail to us

678
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,789
Eternally drunk may prevail

679
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:39,216
Enough

680
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:47,230
Sober men and sages are lost
through the ages

681
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:50,504
But great drinkers never die

682
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,603
But great drinkers never die

683
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,935
Shing Fung produces fine wine by the ton

684
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:02,915
The best solders of Shien Yang
are always so young

685
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:08,249
Though the king calls
I wouldn't alter one sip

686
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:11,950
For I belong to the drunken immortals
your lordship

687
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:15,490
With uplifted cup
I invited the full moon

688
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:21,502
Bring forth my shadow
may three of us swoon

689
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,031
Fine wine in a radiant cup is necessity

690
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:29,007
Put down that cup
the horses are awaiting there

691
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:33,238
Fallen on the battlefield
who will remember me

692
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:35,549
Remember me?

693
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,876
Remember me?

694
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:52,962
Lu, the sober drunkard

695
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:34,871
Li, the cripple with a powerful leg

696
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:05,906
Han, holding a pot in his arms

697
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:36,731
Lan, a sudden attack at the waist

698
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:07,526
Chan, the superior double kick

699
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:39,132
Tso, the desperate throat lock

700
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:08,094
Han, blowing his flute

701
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:31,549
Auntie Ho, swinging her body around

702
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:43,252
Be more serious

703
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,261
This style is so sissy

704
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:50,868
Miss Ho is a woman

705
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:56,737
Watch me

706
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:12,258
Do it yourself

707
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,494
Okay, I'll

708
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:15,823
Practise hard

709
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:23,227
Only women practise this, not me

710
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:32,571
Huang Chi-ying

711
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:35,980
Why do you stop the natives

712
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:38,178
from selling me the Bull Head Hill

713
01:22:39,687 --> 01:22:42,700
You can't hide anything from me

714
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:45,216
What do you mean?

715
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:50,122
Li Wan-hao, I think you just want
the thing hidden on the hill

716
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:51,825
What are you bullshitting?

717
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,464
Coal

718
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:58,170
You secretly deal with the Coal Company

719
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:01,470
to make profit from selling of coal

720
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:05,477
You can hide your guilt
before the villagers but not me

721
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:14,282
Since you know it, I won't deny

722
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:16,183
If you don't interrupt my work

723
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:19,283
I'll give you 20% of the profit

724
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:22,758
20%? You spend so much on me?

725
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:27,197
Listen, the hill belongs to the natives

726
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:30,169
No one can take it away, get out of here

727
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,907
Huang Chi-ying
you're trying to go against me

728
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:37,240
I'll find someone to handle you

729
01:23:56,598 --> 01:24:01,262
A 1000-dollar warrant
to kill Huang Chi-ying of Fushan

730
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:04,464
Huang Chi-ying?

731
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:18,918
Master

732
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:20,653
Is the food for tonight ready? Yes

733
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:28,293
Hurry up
there'll be many guests tonight

734
01:24:36,538 --> 01:24:36,867
Master Hsu

735
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:40,772
Funeral?

736
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,706
You want me to beat you

737
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:49,011
Haven't you suffered enough last time?

738
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,985
I just wanna have something to eat
and someone to beat

739
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:58,818
Alright
I'll make you an extra dish tonight

740
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:00,485
Master, what's it?

741
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:03,631
Bamboo shoot and pork, give me a rod
Yes

742
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:05,590
Pork?

743
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:08,933
I'll have a piece first

744
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,232
Good, it tastes good

745
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:13,739
Master

746
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:18,000
One bowl

747
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:57,010
Your teeth are so strong to break a bowl

748
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:19,037
Well?

749
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:33,949
Watch out for the teeth

750
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,760
Well? He's considerate

751
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,010
Sit still

752
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:09,716
I knock

753
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:14,822
Ass against the stick

754
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:25,798
This is 'Hungry Dogs Snatching for Food'

755
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:27,830
Not accurate enough

756
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:35,249
Got it

757
01:28:58,766 --> 01:28:59,733
Are you drunk?

758
01:29:37,238 --> 01:29:39,206
Master, there's wine

759
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:49,277
Master, the King of Sticks gave us wine

760
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:50,647
It's free of charge

761
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:55,845
Master

762
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:58,651
Master

763
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:02,286
Master

764
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:04,120
Master

765
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:19,109
We've been together for a whole year
It's time for us to separate apart

766
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:23,182
Master can only teach

767
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:29,148
You've to work it out
practice makes perfect

768
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:32,158
and make the Drunken Fist
becomes part of your body

769
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:37,059
I live nowhere, don't miss me, go home

770
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:42,226
I'll come when you need me
Beggar Su

771
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:56,175
Master

772
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,892

773
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,008

774
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:22,334
Mentor Huang

775
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:26,943
Mentor Huang... what's it?

776
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:30,175
Li and his men
are digging Bull Head Hill

777
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:31,013
Really?

778
01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:35,317
Tell them I'm going there. Quick

779
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:40,286
It's just at the front

780
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:19,598
You really deserve
the name of Founder of Hung's Fist

781
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:24,065
Who are you? I don't know you

782
01:32:24,138 --> 01:32:26,003
Why did you ambush me?

783
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:31,044
I kill for money. I'm Yen Tieh-hsin

784
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:36,115
I'll do my best
when having a good opponent like you

785
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:42,682
So you're the cold blood killer
Yan Tieh-hsin

786
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:45,316
Yes

787
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:50,030
But I'm no ordinary person too

788
01:32:50,598 --> 01:32:53,294
Then you must show me your best today

789
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:17,589
The hands are just the doors
but the legs to fight

790
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:29,063
30% for the hands
and the rest for the legs

791
01:34:11,379 --> 01:34:15,179
Huang Chi-ying, I must kill you today

792
01:34:27,762 --> 01:34:28,694
Master

793
01:34:28,796 --> 01:34:30,764
Father, how are you? Are you alright?

794
01:34:31,098 --> 01:34:33,191
Idiot, you're back

795
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:36,269
It's alright. I'm here

796
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:39,197
You dare attack my father?
I'll give you a good lesson

797
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:43,266
You again?

798
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:49,682
So you come to bury your father

799
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,175
You...

800
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:56,682
Mentor Huang
it's too bad you've such disgraceful son

801
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:00,727
You can't live in peace
for the rest of your life

802
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:06,129
Good guy

803
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,225
or I'll kill you too

804
01:35:08,335 --> 01:35:11,065
No way, I'll kill you

805
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:16,140
Okay, you both have to die today
You first

806
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:27,247
Wait... wait for me

807
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:29,186
Master, why you're here?

808
01:35:29,256 --> 01:35:33,818
How can I miss a great fighting?

809
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:38,730
It's none of your business, Su, go away

810
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:44,695
No, I'm bossy

811
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:49,299
but don't worry
I don't need to fight you with my own hands

812
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:52,202
He's good enough

813
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:56,576
Drink first

814
01:36:37,658 --> 01:36:40,627
This wine is strong
Which kind of wine is it?

815
01:36:40,861 --> 01:36:42,226
San Pien Wine

816
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:44,154
It's good

817
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:42,915
Lu, the sober drunkard

818
01:37:53,834 --> 01:37:55,358
Li...

819
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:26,594
the cripple with a powerful leg

820
01:38:28,168 --> 01:38:29,192
Lan...

821
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,952
a sudden attack at the waist

822
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:50,951
Han...

823
01:38:52,626 --> 01:38:54,958
holding a pot in his arms

824
01:39:10,911 --> 01:39:13,641
That's great... the 8 Drunken Gods...

01:39:14,381 --> 01:39:17,976
Thanks... there's more

826
01:39:19,053 --> 01:39:20,315
Han Hsiang-chi...

827
01:39:24,258 --> 01:39:26,988
blowing his flute

828
01:39:55,055 --> 01:39:56,352
It's amazing

829
01:39:57,958 --> 01:39:59,755
Even the flute would twist

830
01:40:00,761 --> 01:40:04,663
Tso, drinking wine lock...

831
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:06,632

833
01:40:09,703 --> 01:40:13,036

01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:17,336
Lock...

835
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:23,843
Bow...

836
01:40:28,622 --> 01:40:29,919
I'll make you bow

837
01:40:44,638 --> 01:40:46,128
Shadowless Hand

838
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:48,874
Yes, you're very smart

839
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:52,803

840
01:40:59,353 --> 01:41:00,718

843
01:41:30,818 --> 01:41:31,716
Wait

844
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:33,079
Master, I can't stand it anymore

845
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:34,879
Why?

846
01:41:34,955 --> 01:41:36,149
I haven't learnt it yet

847
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:39,921
Can you teach me now?

848
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,388
Of course not

849
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:08,614
Hung

850
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:13,583
It seems invisible but it's visible

851
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:20,133
Combine the other 7 styles, and relax

852
01:42:21,869 --> 01:42:24,838
Well, I'll create another Miss Ho

853
01:42:37,784 --> 01:42:39,752

854
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:49,625
Twisting the ass

855
01:42:56,904 --> 01:42:58,633
You don't sit right

856
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:07,874
Putting on cheek blush

857
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:12,909
and facing the mirror

858
01:43:14,655 --> 01:43:15,644
Is it the 8 Drunken Gods?

859
01:43:16,723 --> 01:43:21,820
Everyone has different styles

860
01:43:21,895 --> 01:43:24,762
Even they learn from the same master

861
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:56,914
The goddess wants a drink
Come on
