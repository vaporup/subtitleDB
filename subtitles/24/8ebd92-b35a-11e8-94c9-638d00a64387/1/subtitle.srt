1
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:11,182
Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter … and Spring

2
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,519
Spring

3
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,853
Wake up.

4
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,538
- Master!
- Yes, my boy?

5
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,741
Where do you want to go?

6
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,414
- I want to pick herbs for medicine.
- Then let us go.

7
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,560
Come along.

8
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,380
I'm going to pick herbs now, Master.

9
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,649
Watch out for snakes.

10
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,072
- Wait for me, Master.
- Yes.

11
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,123
I've picked a lot of herbs, Master.

12
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,685
- Really? You've picked a lot?
- Yes.

13
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,696
Careful!

14
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,047
Stop! Throw this away, my child.

15
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,723
Why? It looks the same.

16
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,462
Even though it looks the same,
this is a deadly plant.

17
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,621
The other one can save lives.

18
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,797
It still looks the same. How can I know?

19
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,967
Look closely.

20
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,338
Here at the tip you can see a white line.

21
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,077
If you ate this plant, you'd die.

22
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,048
You mustn't pick this sort of plant next time.

23
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,515
- Is this one all right to eat?
- Yes, this one is good.

24
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:06,808
Master, there is a stone on my back.
Please take it off.

25
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,418
Does it torment you?

26
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,120
Yes, Master.

27
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,424
Didn't you also do it to the fish?

28
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,359
Yes, Master.

29
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,228
- Didn't you also do it to the frog?
- Yes, Master.

30
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,499
Didn't you also do it to the snake?

31
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,094
Yes, Master.

32
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,698
Stand up!

33
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,807
Walk around!

34
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,418
I can't walk. It's too heavy.

35
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:50,523
How do you think the fish,
the frog and the snake endured it?

36
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,364
It was wrong to do it.

37
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,567
Go and find all the animals
and release them from the stones.

38
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,565
Then I will release you too.

39
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:06,866
But if any of the animals, the fish,
the frog or the snake is dead …

40
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:12,248
you will carry the stone in your heart …

41
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,814
for the rest of your life.

42
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,078
Summer

43
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,172
My daughter is sick.

44
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,914
This tree is over 300 years old.

45
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,721
You will become as healthy as this tree.

46
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,657
Greetings.

47
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,786
Come in.

48
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,946
Will she recover, Wise One?

49
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,379
I believe that her soul is suffering.

50
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:26,417
When she finds peace in her soul,
her body will return to health.

51
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,825
Please take care of her.

52
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,926
Excuse me.

53
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,690
You are not allowed to sit on that.

54
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,968
The master will be angry with you.

55
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:48,350
Why are you praying all of a sudden?
You usually never pray at this hour.

56
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,713
Would you like to come along?

57
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,081
Softly!

58
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,846
It must be prepared with a true heart.

59
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,107
Drink!

60
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,169
It will clear your head.

61
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:29,959
The boat is floating away!

62
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,821
Stop it!

63
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,878
Have you recovered now?

64
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,216
Yes, I have completely recovered.

65
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:07,584
Strange.

66
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:10,583
When I can't see you, I go insane.

67
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,426
What is wrong with me?

68
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,727
Cold! It's cold!

69
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:03,491
What shall I do?

70
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,899
I did wrong, Master. Forgive me.

71
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,642
That happens by itself. It is just nature.

72
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,613
Are you still sick?

73
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:23,585
No.

74
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,484
Then it was the right medicine.

75
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,064
Now that you have recovered,
you can leave this place.

76
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,463
No, Master! She can't!

77
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,226
Lust awakens the desire to possess.

78
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:44,665
And that awakens the intent to murder.

79
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,603
Get in.

80
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,523
Fall
