1
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,472
That was tiring, huh?

2
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:43,557
Man, 30, Flees After Murdering Wife

3
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,051
You have grown a lot!

4
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,424
Get in!

5
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:02,114
So?

6
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:06,492
Have you led a happy life up till now?

7
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,090
Tell me something interesting
about your life.

8
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:15,392
The world of men has grown agonizing
for you, hasn't it?

9
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:18,969
Leave me alone, Master.
Can you not see that I am suffering?

10
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,099
What causes you to suffer?

11
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:25,470
My only sin was to love.
I wanted nothing except her.

12
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:27,541
So?

13
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,847
She went with another man.

14
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:32,244
Ah, that was it.

15
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:35,655
How can that be?
She said that she'd love only me.

16
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:39,448
- And then?
- I couldn't bear it anymore.

17
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:42,524
Didn't you know beforehand
how the world of men is?

18
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:45,423
Sometimes we have to let go
of things we like.

19
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:48,634
What you like, others will also like!

20
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:50,967
But still, how could she do that?

21
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:53,607
The bitch!

22
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:58,010
- Is it so unbearable for you?
- Yes!

23
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:38,824
Shut

24
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,760
Young fool!

25
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,486
Young fool!

26
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,900
Though you can so easily kill …

27
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:03,169
you yourself cannot be easily killed.

28
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:07,432
Carve out all of these characters
with the knife.

29
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:10,574
And while you cut out each one …

30
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,608
drive out the anger from your heart.

31
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:20,803
Holy one!

32
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:25,145
Holy one!

33
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,911
We've come to investigate something.

34
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:25,334
- Drop the knife!
- Otherwise I'll shoot!

35
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:31,210
What are you doing? Continue cutting!

36
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:44,197
Prajñāpāramitā Sutra.
It helps restore inner peace.

37
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,466
Please let him finish.

38
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:48,831
How long will it take?

39
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:51,536
Until tomorrow morning.

40
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:12,383
No connection.

41
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:15,552
- No?
- It's quite a deep valley, isn't it?

42
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,075
What?

43
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:28,812
They make white paint from these mussels.

44
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,871
I know.

45
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:38,945
Stand up.

46
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,488
It's time to go.

47
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:58,093
Detective Choi …

48
00:22:58,153 --> 00:22:59,655
let's go as we are.

49
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:36,763
Detective Chi, the boat won't go forwards.

50
00:23:43,665 --> 00:23:44,803
Ah, now it's moving.

51
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:02,748
Shut

52
00:27:07,469 --> 00:27:09,915
Winter

53
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:52,289
…and Spring
