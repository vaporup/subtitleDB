1
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,711
How many times last night?

2
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,812
Seven...

3
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,414
Is that possible?

4
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,991
If you read that book
you could do it even ten times

5
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,626
Oh OK!
Jerk-off king

6
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,992
What if we stop growing
because of this?

7
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,795
I guess we shouldn't
over do it

8
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,659
But I keep getting hard-ons

9
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,002
I know, me too

10
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,331
How was this morning?

11
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,743
It's been three days.

12
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,775
Must be nice!
I haven't done it even once yet

13
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,912
How could someone who jerks off
seven times a day do it?

14
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,716
Maybe your right...

15
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,316
Was Candy
in your dreams last night?

16
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,154
Yesterday, finally

17
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,524
I grabbed

18
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,061
- Her hands
- Then?

19
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,333
I came

20
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,435
Did you see
Candy's in your dream?

21
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,502
No, it was too dark
in the water!

22
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,171
Have you seen a woman's?

23
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,441
No, you?

24
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,882
Not yet!
But I suppose Sang Min has...

25
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,188
What's wrong?

26
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:44,286
I get a hard-on whenever I hear
words that sounds like "pussy"

27
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,362
That must be tough

28
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,871
Gosh!

29
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,140
Are you okay?

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,614
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

31
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,808
Be careful.

32
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,745
Sang Min!

33
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,481
Your acting is getting better

34
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,822
How was she?

35
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,218
Of all the women
I have touched so far

36
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,028
She was the firmest

37
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,965
Sang Min
have you seen a women's?

38
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,437
- You haven't seen it, yet?
- No. Have you?

39
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,537
Of course, I haven't

40
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:35,646
Young Jae has
a porn tape at his place

41
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,450
Let's go borrow it
from him

42
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,879
Sure!

43
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,964
1988 Yong Chun Middle School

44
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,975
Attention! Greetings
Good morning

45
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,183
What is it?
No greetings?

46
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,457
Young Jae was
on duty last week

47
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,894
Who is it this week?

48
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,129
It's Chun Soo
but he isn't here yet

49
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,324
Then the class captain can
do it instead

50
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,467
Attention!

51
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,602
- Greetings!
- Good morning

52
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,607
I always say this
but students should

53
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:45,784
fulfill their duty and
teachers likewise

54
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:51,985
By doing so, the peace of
this society is maintained

55
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,349
And being late for school

56
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,461
is against student's duties

57
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,862
Always remember this.
Understood?

58
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,057
Yes, sir.

59
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:05,299
Class captain, you tell Chun Soo to see
me in my office when he comes

60
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,403
Yes, sir

61
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,209
Okay!
That's it for today

62
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,205
Attention!

63
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,008
- Greetings!
- Thank you, sir!

64
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:29,122
Young Jae!
Should I buy you a drink?

65
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,919
No, I'm fine!

66
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,222
Shame on you!
I refuse to watch it!

67
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,835
Good thinking!
Let's eat instead.

68
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,836
What does
a woman's look like?

69
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,553
You sure
you don't want a drink?

70
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,589
No, it's okay!
I'll just tell you.

71
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,963
It looks something like this.

72
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,292
It's strange looking.

73
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,234
Does it taste
like that too?

74
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,667
Do you think
it needs seasoning?

75
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,439
Can we go watch your tape
when your parents are out?

76
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:28,376
Only if you take us
to the warehouse

77
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,956
with the porn magazines

78
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,685
My dad will kill me. I've only seen
it through the window

79
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,928
I'll get kicked out too
if my parents find out

80
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,264
Hey!

81
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,262
your eating your lunch
after the second class?

82
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,796
Are you sure
you're students?

83
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,838
Good!
I was hungry.

84
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,475
Teacher wants to see you

85
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,945
Damn, if he has something to say
why doesn't he come to see me

86
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,451
Yesterday I rooted a girl
I met at the roller skating ring

87
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,791
What is rooting?

88
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,092
You know, humping.

89
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,692
Why were you humping at
the roller skating ring?

90
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,634
No stupid!

91
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,843
Don't you know fucking?

92
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,242
How did you do it?

93
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:29,307
First we went to the park and
started drinking

94
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,346
Then I asked her!

95
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,984
What did you say?

96
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,950
Hey, they call me stallion
are you gonna give it to me?

97
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:38,991
Give you what?

98
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,020
Damn! Shut up.

99
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,488
Then what happened?

100
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,930
She said
her nickname was Candy

101
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,134
and she said okay.

102
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,703
Okay for rooting?

103
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,637
So I started humping away

104
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:57,899
Then she screamed like a cat
and scratched my back

105
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,006
- Want to see the marks?
- Yeah!

106
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,641
Okay!

107
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:16,390
Loneliness or sadness
can't make Candy cry.

108
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,623
But when she bangs
does it really work?

109
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,532
Can you feel it?

110
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,345
Yeah, I think I need to do
it just a bit more

111
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,505
What about you?

112
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,978
Don't disturb me!
I'm gonna come!

113
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,253
Let's do it too!

114
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,562
Do what?

115
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,198
Rooting!

116
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,860
How can we do it
without a girl?

117
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,534
No problems, we'll hook up on
Sunday at the roller skate arena

118
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:06,266
I'm not interested
in animal sex

119
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,674
Does that look
human to you?

120
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,453
Did you come?

121
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,457
Look at Dong Hyun
studying hard

122
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,464
Yes, mom!

123
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,301
The melons are really sweet.
Eat some?

124
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,671
Okay!

125
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,744
"Fantastic Adolescences"

126
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:53,119
She moaned softly
and she brought

127
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,692
her lips
close to my chest

128
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,361
Then she tickled me
with her tongue

129
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,762
She licked my ears

130
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,300
and she kept going
lower past my neck

131
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:14,036
to the angry
part of my body

132
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:19,177
then started petting

133
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:25,715
My fingers are
being sucked into

134
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,055
her tidy cave

135
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:34,529
Her cave was
flowing with sweet juices

136
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:40,869
Strong aromas of fruit...
aromas...

137
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,106
I realised whilst eating a melon
that there are many ways to eat it

138
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,375
Of course, if the melon was to be
in platonic love with me

139
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,312
I would never have rooted it

140
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,353
Listen to that.
Kids are doing drugs

141
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,616
and sleeping around...

142
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,984
even middle school
students are doing it!

143
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,958
But thank God
our Dong Hyun is not like that

144
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,000
That's right!

145
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,252
What?

146
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,365
No, no.
Keep shaking!

147
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,682
What about her?

148
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,551
Kinda flat

149
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,120
Sang Min
what about them?

150
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,230
Oh!
I'll try to hook them up.

151
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,772
Hey, I don't want to.

152
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,543
Wanna ride with us?

153
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,788
Cheers!

154
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:23,293
What are your names?

155
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,869
My name is Hoon, Park Hoon
and my nickname is 'Big Unit'

156
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:33,635
I'm Min, Oh Min
and they call me 'Stallion'

157
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,641
My name is Hyun, Min Hyun
My nickname is 'Crazy Train'

158
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,514
I'm Seok Gu!
Ji Seok Gu, and my

159
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,046
nickname is Casanova.

160
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,051
Are you gonna
give it to me?

161
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,622
Give you what?

162
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,365
Hey, give him yours

163
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,772
This?

164
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:30,168
Hey, did you guys come
here to have sex with us?

165
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,133
No, of course not

166
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,335
Bullshit!

167
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,412
If we wanted to
would you?

168
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,845
You know, I mean...

169
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,087
- Give it to you?
- Yes!

170
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,190
Do you even know
how to root?

171
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,793
She said root!

172
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,238
I think we should go.

173
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,011
Yes, I think we should.

174
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,589
See ya next time.

175
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:30,456
Stay right there
you little piece of shit! Sit!

176
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,463
Undress

177
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:43,139
Take off your clothes fuck wits

178
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,613
Didn't you hear me, assholes?

179
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,586
Hurry up and kneel!

180
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,089
Close your eyes.

181
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,998
Now I want to hear sounds
of your nicknames

182
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,864
Crazy train goes chi-chi

183
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,399
and the stallion goes hee-hee
Got that?

184
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:19,278
Big unit is...
you are...

185
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,446
squirt-squirt!

186
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,937
I like that.
You go squirt-squirt, understand?

187
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,110
If you don't do it properly

188
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,082
I'll cut your faces

189
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,687
- Got it? Understand?
- Yes!

190
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,018
Start

191
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,231
Open your eyes
and it's a shaving day.

192
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,105
Excuse me.

193
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,375
Do I know you?

194
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,878
I'm Yoo Ri!
Kim Yoo Ri

195
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,819
From
Gwang Chun high school.

196
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,319
Ah, Kim Yoo Ri

197
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,893
What are you doing here?

198
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,568
- I am the new trainee teacher.
- Is that right?

199
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,435
It's time for
the staff meeting

200
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,469
Your swift
attention is requested

201
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,075
Okay, see you around.

202
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,313
Hey, is that him?

203
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:15,216
Your high school crush?
Your handsome prince?

204
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:20,032
Are you nuts?
How can he be a prince?

205
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:24,298
Hey, you just saw him.
How can you say that?

206
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,338
But I think
he's a dull looking dork

207
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:30,035
Can't you tell the difference
between dull and natural?

208
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:39,250
New trainee teachers
shall look after

209
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:44,820
your students according to your subjects
until the Sports carnival next month

210
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,155
That's it for today.

211
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,727
- Hey, Mr. Gong!
- Yes.

212
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:04,270
Your class for the second straight
month finished last in test scores

213
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,940
Any thoughts on this?

214
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,307
Nothing huh?

215
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,946
No, sir.

216
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,885
Well, then keep up
the good work.

217
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,534
Good morning?

218
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,773
I am Hwang Gap Tae
the P.E. teacher.

219
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:41,742
You must be the P.E trainee teacher?
I knew it at first sight

220
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,640
because you were so tall

221
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,121
I am the P.E trainee

222
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,852
Good morning. I am Yoon So Jung.
Nice to meet you!

223
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,655
I am the math trainee.

224
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,396
Calm down!

225
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,767
Calm down!

226
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,906
Let's say hello

227
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,036
Dong Hyun
what are you doing?

228
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,014
Attention!

229
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,107
At ease!

230
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,151
- Greetings!
- Good morning!

231
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:58,883
Why aren't they bowing?

232
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,686
We are at ease, dork.

233
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,622
- Attention!
- Enough!

234
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:13,962
This is our new trainee
Kim Yoo Ri.

235
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,538
No, I mean trainee teacher
Ms. Kim Yoo Ri.

236
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,435
Say hello and
please cooperate with her

237
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,606
Good morning!

238
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,545
Nice to meet you all?
I just want to

239
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,392
say that everyone
should study hard

240
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:40,296
Because your teacher is
having a very tough time

241
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,959
as a result of
everyone's test scores.

242
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,569
If your grade falls by one for
this month's exam

243
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,270
you run one around
school playground with me

244
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:59,710
If it falls by 2, then it's twice around
and if you fall by 3, you get the idea?

245
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,819
- You know...
- Wait!

246
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,913
If it falls by
more than 10 grades

247
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,585
You'll run 10 rounds
carrying me on your back

248
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,722
Well, that's enough

249
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,667
I expect extra attention

250
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,966
and preparation for
this month's test

251
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,971
Miss Kim
we'll study hard,

252
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,340
if you sing us a song.

253
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,842
Enough!
Stop being foolish

254
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,544
Please just one song.

255
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,487
Please...

256
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:46,430
Do you promise to study hard
if I sing you a song?

257
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,031
Yes!

258
00:22:54,106 --> 00:23:01,478
Whether I am sad or
filled with worries

259
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:09,249
I don't cry
Why should I cry? I'll never cry

260
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:13,655
Let's go run out
to the field smiling

261
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,353
Let's sing a song looking
up the bright blue sky

262
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:24,635
My name is, my name is
my name is Candy

263
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:32,139
When I'm alone
I get lonely

264
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:40,378
Then talk to
myself in the mirror

265
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:47,787
Smile, smile
smile Candy!

266
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:55,158
Don't cry Candy!

267
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,030
Trainee teachers are
still teachers

268
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:04,474
You start giving in to everything
they ask you to do, there is no end to it

269
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,804
Think of yourself as a
real teacher from now on

270
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,709
Okay.

271
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:17,044
And I'm sorry
about my behaviour.

272
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,284
After all these years
I didn't even greet you properly.

273
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,417
Good morning Mr. Gong.

274
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,352
Morning!

275
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,165
Are you okay?

276
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,766
I did all that for him.

277
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,434
Do you really love him?

278
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:41,970
Of course!

279
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:44,907
Why?

280
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:51,313
You are really
going to kiss Mr. Toilet?

281
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,720
Of course, I will

282
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:00,362
He will fall in love with me.
Just you wait

283
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,862
Hey, what did you call him?

284
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,129
Nothing

285
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:13,505
I didn't know there were
such dirty princes

286
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,205
He should at least shave.

287
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:17,808
Why?

288
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,920
You don't know how much it
hurts to kiss an unshaved man

289
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,688
Lips are not the only place

290
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,587
you get to kiss, y'know.

291
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,828
I have only ten behind me
how can I fall ten grades?

292
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:38,092
You should be happy you
get to run with Candy!

293
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:43,339
I can't run since I don't
have anyone behind me

294
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:47,601
You two are lucky. You guys can
fall more than 10 places

295
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:53,073
I'll fall more than 20 places
and carry Candy for 20 laps

296
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,514
I'm gonna fall
more than 30 places

297
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,920
I may not carry her but I wish
I get to hold her hand at least

298
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,223
Hey, you wanna make a bet who
gets to hold Candy's hand first?

299
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,727
What's the bet?

300
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,996
I say, you do

301
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,694
- Okay!
- I'm on!

302
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,429
But can we not call our
trainee teacher 'Candy'?

303
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,540
It keeps reminding me
of Chun Soo's Candy

304
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,471
Then what?

305
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:23,407
How about mermaid?
Mermaid will hold my hand first

306
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,048
I suppose you are confident?

307
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,247
What's up with him?

308
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,981
He gets hard on whenever he hears
a word that sounds like "pussy"

309
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,057
Must be tough

310
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:43,295
Do you have a boyfriend?

311
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,028
Not yet!

312
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,400
Don't ask or
think about irrelevant things

313
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,303
Your exam is tomorrow

314
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,641
Tell us about your first love.

315
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,043
If you study now and I'll tell you

316
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,850
during the lunch break

317
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:10,157
Teacher
what is 'freedom' in English?

318
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,226
Freedom?

319
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:17,463
Isn't freedom
something else?

320
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,008
What is freedom?

321
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,539
The tampons, you dork!

322
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,107
Freedom is
the most important thing.

323
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,320
Hmm, what day is it today?
Yes, the 16th

324
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,352
You translate, number 16

325
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,356
Okay!

326
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:51,268
Can't you translate
even a short sentence?

327
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,168
Oh right!

328
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,410
Tampons...

329
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,813
What?
Tampons? You idiot!

330
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,280
You idiot
why did you say tampon?

331
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,420
You stupid!

332
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,718
Is that all you think about??

333
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,816
You pervert!!

334
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,869
Isn't that a good sight?

335
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,774
Yes. I couldn't wait for lunch time
when I was a student

336
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,469
No, I mean the trainee

337
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:41,548
She's pretty, has a hot body
and even sings well

338
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,986
She is just a child

339
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,355
Please watch your tongue

340
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,026
That teacher was my first love.

341
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,735
What's he doing now?

342
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,471
That's a secret

343
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,937
Then what about the first kiss?

344
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,435
Not yet...

345
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,148
but I think I will soon

346
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,145
With who?

347
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,678
Hm well...

348
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,723
How do you make babies?

349
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,350
Do I have to answer that?

350
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,394
Don't worry, we will teach him

351
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,730
Thanks, Dong Hyun

352
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,525
Teacher!

353
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,761
Just call me Hyun

354
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,538
Min Hyun?

355
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:39,204
It's a real pleasure
to meet you

356
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,568
It's an honor

357
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:41,879
Me too!

358
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,881
Can I have your autograph?

359
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,211
Oh, sure. Why not

360
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,017
- Me too
- Me too

361
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,861
I can't write with this

362
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,797
It's ran out

363
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,535
Why don't we have lunch, okay?

364
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:29,123
- What's with them?
- Try some of this!

365
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,425
I love hot peppers

366
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,401
Oh, it's hot?

367
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,305
I suppose you
should try some too

368
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,808
What did you just say?

369
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,058
How's been
the last couple of days?

370
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,732
Tough?

371
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,438
No, it's fun?

372
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,742
You made it so easy for me

373
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,409
That's good

374
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,650
By the way, what made you decide
to become a teacher?

375
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,124
It's doesn't pay well and this job
requires commitment and duty

376
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,625
What is wrong with
being a teacher?

377
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:42,066
I think teachers are the best

378
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,700
I am even going to
marry a teacher

379
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:50,498
You still
sound like a student

380
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,934
There are lots of differences
between love and reality

381
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,571
Always think twice

382
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,086
No matter what
I am going to

383
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,953
marry a teacher

384
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,219
I wonder

385
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,357
who you will marry

386
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,400
I really wonder

387
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,803
- Teacher!
- Yes?

388
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,170
You don't have a girlfriend
do you?

389
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,482
Why?
Does it show?

390
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,378
Yes!

391
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,925
Who would like
an old teacher like me?

392
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,757
They say, where there is

393
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:52,027
a will there is a way.

394
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,906
Someone will
surely come your way

395
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,171
It felt like silk

396
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:10,178
I felt electric shocks all over my body
when the pen and her hand

397
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,382
You win! Seok Gu
your wish is our command

398
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:22,161
Lets go to your parent's motel and
peep at people have sex

399
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:35,175
Are you going to rest?

400
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,803
Give me a room

401
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,408
That'll be 5000 won and

402
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,284
your room is 308

403
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,580
Sit down

404
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,276
Let go

405
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,222
Is that rooting?

406
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,831
Let's...

407
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,429
do it one more time

408
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:09,733
Do what?

409
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,299
This time
it's her underwear

410
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,406
What?
You want to touch her pussy?

411
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,276
No, you have to tell the color

412
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,745
of her panties

413
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,817
Okay, let's do it

414
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,455
No, you can't do that

415
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,454
Why not?

416
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,551
That's something you
shouldn't do

417
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,526
But if I win I am going to go
to Seok Gu's warehouse

418
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,131
Me, too

419
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:41,699
You shouldn't.
I am warning you

420
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,557
Miss

421
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,984
Hey, it's you
Dong Hyun

422
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:08,031
What are you doing here?

423
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,798
Oh. Well Nothing
What are you doing here?

424
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,399
I live over there

425
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,638
Oh, I see

426
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,707
Did you come to see
the Mr. Gong?

427
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:31,082
No, why would I?
I was just passing by.

428
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,852
Oh, do you like melons?

429
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:38,291
Yes, I eat it almost everyday

430
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,498
Good, why don't you take these.

431
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:42,656
Thank you!

432
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,697
- Enjoy them
- Oh, no!

433
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,320
Miss

434
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,185
I'm okay. Thank you

435
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,690
Just wait here, okay?

436
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,197
Are you okay?

437
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,733
Sure are you okay?

438
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,602
Just wait here.

439
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,373
Where are you going?

440
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,284
Go on? Take this

441
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,064
Thank you Dong Hyun

442
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,008
Are you all right?

443
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:07,139
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay. It just grazed

444
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,719
Are you sure?
Let me take a look

445
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:15,148
Can you stop looking?

446
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,057
Sure

447
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,426
Thanks for the jacket

448
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:27,061
Study hard for the test
and enjoy the melons

449
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,798
I'm going now

450
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,134
Okay!

451
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,018
What are you doing?

452
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,830
Hey, come on

453
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:10,577
Okay.
I am not gonna do it

454
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:14,512
What is this?
Is this rape?

455
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,177
I will be your fiance soon?

456
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,823
It took me 100 days to kiss

457
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:25,358
Fine! Suit yourself!
Keep it till the end

458
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,396
We'll do it on our honeymoon then.
I'm gonna sleep. Damn!

459
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:29,660
Honey!

460
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,694
What?
I am busy. I have to go

461
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,531
Okay!
I'll undress

462
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:42,638
Wasn't it hot?
I'll turn around

463
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,086
Honey

464
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,701
Yoo Ri

465
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:20,879
I'm sorry!
I come back later

466
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,055
Yoo Ri, if you could come back
in 40 minutes

467
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:30,091
No
we were about to leave

468
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:42,171
Yoo Ri, you look very sexy with
your clothes all wet and stuff

469
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,499
You want to look sexy?

470
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,405
Thirsty. Yes thirsty. You don't know that
because you are thirsty

471
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:48,705
Right, I heard

472
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:52,038
from So Jeong
this morning

473
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,508
Listen carefully
all men are the same

474
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,688
If a woman comes in with
her clothes all wet

475
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,121
All men are seduced

476
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,624
Everybody is seduced

477
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,252
Mr. Toilet
that teacher is a man too

478
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,725
Let's go

479
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,696
It's raining.
Where are you going

480
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,892
holding your underwear.
Are you crazy?

481
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:15,372
One more thing about prince

482
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,863
Wait!
The important thing is to make him

483
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,139
forget the fact that
you were once his student

484
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,403
Then it's up to
your sex appeal

485
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,140
Aren't you gonna go?

486
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:30,521
Yes! Hey, don't give up.
You can do it

487
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,579
Let's go!

488
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,925
You top is a bit too wet

489
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,449
Hurry up.

490
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,550
Dear DJ Bae

491
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,526
Hey, hey!
Did you hear!

492
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,926
Big News!!!

493
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,659
Listen!
Shhhhh!

494
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:19,026
Tea Sik from
another class looked up

495
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,363
the Ms. Kim's
skirts with a mirror

496
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,637
And she wasn't
wearing an underwear!

497
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,336
Let's go look.
Let's go!

498
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:31,039
Wait!

499
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,009
This will do

500
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,823
I'm so so... Sorry

501
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,667
It does hurt.

502
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,480
Having a conscience is
a virtue

503
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:48,684
and it takes courage to keep it

504
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,293
If you're gonna cheat don't
get caught. Understood?

505
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,324
Yes!

506
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:58,400
Ms. Kim!
I can't read the question 14 properly

507
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,801
It says
"who is the historical figure?"

508
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,033
Ms. Kim!

509
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:06,543
Why?

510
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:10,877
I can't read question 15.
Can you please write it on the board?

511
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,109
Sure!

512
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,851
I'll kill after the test

513
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,951
I guess we have to come up
with a better idea

514
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,795
I'll say!

515
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,961
I'm gonna look in directly

516
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,022
How?

517
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,034
I am going to stick
my face under her skirt

518
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,894
No way!

519
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,064
Are you daring me?

520
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:50,845
Watch this

521
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,196
You little pervert!
You idiot

522
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:10,500
always thinking
about dirty things

523
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,875
You little pervert!
You idiot

524
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,021
Good thing
I have changed today

525
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,950
That crazy idiot

526
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,285
Mr. Gong!

527
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,562
Would you like to
have dinner together?

528
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,630
Or you can starve
if you want

529
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,837
Okay!

530
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,443
let's go

531
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,558
Seok Gu, no!

532
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:51,305
My God!
What are you doing there?

533
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,505
- You are really crude, man
- Why am I?

534
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,944
You're the one
who stopped us from looking

535
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,149
and now you're
the first to see her underwear

536
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,016
Really no panties?

537
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,525
I can't tell

538
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:15,128
She really wasn't
wearing any

539
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:19,500
Anyway, you won.
so make a wish

540
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,332
Let's go to
Seok Gu's warehouse

541
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:29,202
Are you sure
she wasn't wearing any?

542
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:36,016
Beijing shark's fin
Woo Long sea-slug

543
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:40,782
Order something delicious.
It's my treat

544
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:47,522
Chinese food is all the same.
I'll just have noodles

545
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:51,090
Try something
more expensive

546
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,438
Okay, Then can I have noodles
with extra noodles?

547
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:59,740
Sure.
Then I'll have noodles too

548
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,941
Fried dumpling
will be on the house, right?

549
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:15,552
Why did you
bring the cup noodle?

550
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,123
I'm gonna eat it
when I'm hungry

551
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,759
Did you bring the keys?

552
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:40,343
It's raining

553
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:45,983
It's pretty heavy.
Do you have an umbrella?

554
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:48,422
Of course not

555
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,891
I do!

556
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:01,428
By the way, you know who will be charge
of class from tomorrow?

557
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,164
- Yoo Ri!
- Yes?

558
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,970
The class.
Have you prepared?

559
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:09,235
Yes, don't worry

560
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,789
What's this?

561
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,794
Shaver, an electric shaver

562
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:30,224
Thank you
but I wouldn't need it

563
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,559
I like the natural look

564
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,103
I like it natural too

565
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,367
but it hurts

566
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:43,146
No, it doesn't

567
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,546
Of course
it doesn't hurt you

568
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:51,552
What if two of us get to...

569
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,616
Two of us do what?

570
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:04,066
Do you know
what the kids call you?

571
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:09,463
I appreciate it.
Thank you!

572
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,250
There must be pictures of it

573
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:26,816
You never know, we might get to see
women from all around the world

574
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:42,529
- What is it? Aren't you going in?
- Let's have one more bet

575
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,335
What this time?
Her tits?

576
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:50,043
Rooting, why?
Chicken?

577
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,051
You're on.
I always wanted to do it with

578
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,350
a Brook Shields
look-a-like

579
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:58,655
Okay?

580
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:03,183
I always thought Ms. Kim would
be my first anyway

581
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:06,694
C'mon, can you guys stop it?

582
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,695
You're the only one
who saw her underwear

583
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,165
Right, selfish pig

584
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,965
If you give up on the sex magazines
I'll give up too

585
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:20,700
Okay, rooting it is

586
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:33,017
Why don't we go out?
I'll buy you a drink

587
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:37,550
Aren't you
too young to drink?

588
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,860
Do I still look like
a student to you?

589
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:47,765
Once a students
always a student

590
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,201
I'll buy the drink

591
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:59,077
But it's going to be
soft drinks for you

592
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:02,615
Yes

593
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,856
- The rain has stopped
- Yes!

594
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,728
I really enjoyed dinner

595
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,366
Don't mention it?

596
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,965
You are going to buy
the drinks anyway

597
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:25,006
You are going
have soft drinks anyway

598
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,747
Mr. Gong
do you remember this?
