1
00:00:01,148 --> 00:00:04,584
Mr. Gong
do you remember this?

2
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:05,652
What is it?

3
00:00:06,387 --> 00:00:11,188
It was a present from you.
Take a closer look

4
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:19,463
This was
your graduation present

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,568
Amazing
you still have this key ring?

6
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:25,400
Of course I do!

7
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:28,567
Do you know
how important this is to me?

8
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:33,913
C'mon, let's go!

9
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:35,080
OK!

10
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:59,570
You were right!
It looks like a mussel

11
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:07,078
These mussels have hair

12
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:24,294
This is where you put it in

13
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:26,124
The holes are all wet

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,134
Hey, this woman
got two men on her

15
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:30,565
I got two women doing it

16
00:01:34,742 --> 00:01:37,336
I've never seen tits
this big before

17
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,217
What are you doing?

18
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:47,912
I can't take it anymore.
I'm gonna do it with this

19
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:54,984
Hey, Seok Gu
you are a genius.

20
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:58,257
I never knew I would ever
enjoy noodles this way

21
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:01,592
The wrapping keeps
getting in the way

22
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:20,181
Well, we're here

23
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:22,650
Mr. Gong
since the dinner was a bit oily

24
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:25,850
why don't you come over to my place
and have something like kimchee?

25
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,324
It's late.
Good night

26
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:29,962
Yes

27
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:34,793
I like getting wet
in the rain

28
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,041
Mr. Gong!

29
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:54,548
You look sexier
when you smile.

30
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:56,974
Young Je
can I borrow this first?

31
00:04:57,478 --> 00:04:59,503
No, can I read it first?

32
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:01,137
Let's read together

33
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:06,043
They are huge

34
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:12,754
Give it here

35
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:16,261
Wait!

36
00:05:16,697 --> 00:05:19,291
If we keep passing it around
we'll lose track whose is whose

37
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,867
So we'll put
our names on it

38
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:24,501
What if we get caught
because of the names?

39
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:27,705
- Then just write our nicknames.
- Yeah!

40
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:39,446
What?

41
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,819
The P.E teacher is here.

42
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,092
You're stallion?

43
00:05:57,304 --> 00:06:01,240
I am crazy train

44
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:03,605
Are you stallion?

45
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:07,010
I'm the big unit

46
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,910
Damn it!
You read this kind of stuff

47
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:17,923
and all of you will
commit sex crimes

48
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:19,852
Get down!

49
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:26,357
You make noise according to your
nickname on each hit, understand?

50
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,892
Yes, sir

51
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:30,030
What were you again?

52
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:32,903
I am the big unit

53
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:36,102
Then...

54
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,834
It's squirt-squirt

55
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:39,808
What the!

56
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:47,512
Hurry up and get down now!

57
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:51,981
What's going on here?

58
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,354
I am having
a sexual education class

59
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:56,756
If they need to be punished
I'll do it!

60
00:06:57,297 --> 00:07:00,892
Look after them Mr. Gong

61
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:06,899
Your class came
last for the third straight month

62
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,534
It's a first ever
in this school's 75 years history

63
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:15,477
Three straight months!?

64
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,215
I have a favorite to ask

65
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,089
If we come in first
on the Sports Carnival

66
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,195
I think Mr. Gong will feel better

67
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:31,528
We can do it, right?

68
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,393
Yes, Miss

69
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:37,567
I have a question

70
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:42,136
My grades went up 10 spots

71
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,041
then do you
carry me for 10 rounds?

72
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:56,845
DongHyun will carry me first
since you fell by 32 spots

73
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:02,922
Miss...

74
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:07,834
I heard you did it on purpose
because you wanted to carry me

75
00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:09,762
So hurry up

76
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:22,605
I'm worried Dong Hyun will
win the bet again

77
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:25,775
Is it possible to
root in that position?

78
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,715
Didn't you see
the couple at the motel?

79
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:33,620
Dong Hyun on her back
makes it possible

80
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:41,625
Anything is possible.
Better watch out

81
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:11,926
That hurts...

82
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:17,761
Anything good today?

83
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:20,338
Check this out

84
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:27,079
High school kids...

85
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:33,053
Good evening

86
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:36,113
this is DJ Bea

87
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,058
It rained hard tonight

88
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:43,489
On a night like this
the pain of love deepens

89
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:49,299
Loving an older woman is
much more painful

90
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:54,805
This is the story of Dong Hyun
from Yong Chun Dong

91
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:58,569
19 days ago I fell in love

92
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:01,907
She is 7 years
older than me

93
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:05,677
I wanted to
keep her for eternity

94
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:10,516
But the thought of not being able to
own her forever rips my heart in two

95
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:16,628
Did you really write
a love letter to him?

96
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,264
Yes, and I am going to put it
in her lunch box

97
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:28,905
I think
you should reconsider

98
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:32,234
I thought about it enough

99
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:36,248
It's a pity that I can't
see this tomorrow

100
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:39,745
I am sorry, I can't go to
your engagement party

101
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:43,156
Tell your fiance Min Su
that I am really sorry

102
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:47,718
Love has no limits.
Go for it Dong Hyun

103
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:50,991
Buy a bunch of roses
then go to her

104
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:54,759
house and confess your love

105
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:59,271
Confess your love

106
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:04,700
Where are you going
at this hour?

107
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:06,675
Going to buy roses

108
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:10,449
Roses?

109
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:13,115
- Does he smoke?
- What?

110
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:14,278
"ROSES"

111
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:52,257
Come look at this

112
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:00,764
My... he's all grown up.

113
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:23,715
There is something
I must say to her

114
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:31,421
but I could not meet her

115
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:47,571
Hey, hold it tight.
You're making it spill all over

116
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:52,280
Can't you see
it's all foaming up?

117
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:03,825
Do you know what happens when
you mix soda and this powder?

118
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:07,560
You can get woman high.

119
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:10,102
I used it on my girl
last night and

120
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:12,865
she got so high
we rooted twice

121
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:14,530
What's a squeeze?

122
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,233
The Candy
I told you about before

123
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:19,112
This trainee's
nickname is Candy too

124
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:22,548
so she's as good
as my squeeze anyway

125
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:25,377
You are going to
give this to her?

126
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:30,716
Give this to her first
then wait for my chance

127
00:13:34,294 --> 00:13:35,659
Ms Kim!

128
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,689
You must be thirsty.
Why don't you have some of this

129
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:41,426
I just opened it

130
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:43,029
Thanks

131
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,606
Don't drink it

132
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:53,341
There is a bug in it.

133
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:55,777
Really?

134
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:07,384
- What the...
- You prick

135
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:16,902
Mr. Gong
I made this lunch

136
00:14:19,673 --> 00:14:22,369
Really? Thanks
I'll enjoy it

137
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:30,542
There is a caf called "Lovers"
only about 5 minutes walk from here

138
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:34,778
Would you like to go later?

139
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:40,954
Well, I don't know. All the teachers
may have dinner together

140
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:43,120
I'll tell you later, okay?

141
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:56,610
Didn't I beat you up
enough yet?

142
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,478
I'm not gonna
let you hurt her.

143
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:05,646
Dong Hyun, you saying you're gonna
go one on one with him?

144
00:15:07,888 --> 00:15:10,152
You're dead meat

145
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:13,792
Hey, you're gonna get high
if you drink that

146
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:16,689
You can't fight them
clear-headed

147
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:42,013
- What the?
- You're all dead!

148
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,975
Hey, isn't that a letter in
Mr. Gong's lunch?

149
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:16,945
- Try this rice cake!
- You do!

150
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:22,360
Wait!

151
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,930
This is between Chun Soo and me.
Leave us alone!

152
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:42,143
Wait!

153
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:51,219
All right, all right.
You can have Ms. Kim

154
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,893
Okay?

155
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,062
- Are you okay?
- Doesn't it hurt?

156
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:08,898
It hurts like hell

157
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:15,708
Dong Hyun. Miss Kim is
your squeeze forever

158
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:19,880
Looks like no more
rooting bets anymore

159
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:27,123
Don't stray and
go straight home

160
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:30,321
Don't go anyway!

161
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:32,931
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

162
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:46,913
Are you really
going to confess today?

163
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:50,212
Yes!
I even prepared the roses

164
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:55,482
Mr Gong!

165
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:04,791
Can we go to
"Lovers" later?

166
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:08,760
I think I have to attend
the teacher's dinner

167
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,494
I see!

168
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:20,774
I hope you
meet somebody nice

169
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:31,813
Can't you give it to her now?

170
00:19:32,018 --> 00:19:34,287
Why is your squeeze
drinking alone?

171
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,755
Stop calling her my squeeze

172
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,126
Okay!

173
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:44,192
go tell her
straight up like you

174
00:19:44,297 --> 00:19:49,530
stood up against Chun Soo.

175
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:55,138
It's been three hours already

176
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,540
Okay!

177
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:18,393
Hey
it's you Dong Hyun

178
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:26,296
Miss, I have something
I must say

179
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,468
- When I first...
- You!

180
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:37,711
Do you know
who my first love was?

181
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,545
No!

182
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:46,925
But, I am willing to
accept your past

183
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:55,762
Before I met you
Miss, miss

184
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,076
I think
she completely passed out

185
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,948
Won't she wake up
if we touch her?

186
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,021
Let's touch her
and see what happens

187
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:20,889
Don't start imagining
stupid things

188
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:25,124
We have to protect her
until she wakes up

189
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:27,390
Okay!

190
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:32,694
I'll go watch
if my mom's coming back

191
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:38,966
I'll turned out the light, so my mom
won't know we are here

192
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:40,804
I'll go with you

193
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:42,805
- Follow me!
- Me too?

194
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:49,321
Do you think
Dong Hyun will do it with Miss Kim?

195
00:21:50,223 --> 00:21:55,593
I don't know.
Shall we make Dong Hyun drink

196
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:57,492
the love potion
and see what happens?

197
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,394
I didn't feel anything
when I drank it

198
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:03,959
Me too, nothing

199
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:07,862
Will Miss Kim want to do it
with Dong Hyun?

200
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:13,177
Remember last time
when we were peeping?

201
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:14,969
Woman was screaming
when they're enjoying sex.

202
00:22:15,248 --> 00:22:19,912
I still get a hard-on
whenever I think about them

203
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:22,281
Have you got cup noodles here?

204
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:26,213
No, let's go buy some
at supermarket

205
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:31,821
Sure, then let's do it here

206
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,646
I was going to explode
If I reached out,

207
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,816
I could have touch her breasts

208
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:05,054
The thought of me being inside her
made me shiver all over

209
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:44,664
Hello... hello?

210
00:23:45,238 --> 00:23:49,538
Teacher Yoon
this is Dong Hyun

211
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,811
Yoo Ri
we're almost there

212
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:03,651
- Thank you!
- Please, be careful

213
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:18,832
Mr, Gong!

214
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:24,172
Five years ago the start of
a new semester. Do you remember?

215
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:31,281
A sudden burst of rain
left me stuck at the bus stop

216
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:35,749
Then you appeared and said:
"Are you a Gwang Chun high student?"

217
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:39,358
"Then lets share
this umbrella" and we left.

218
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:45,362
When your hand
touched mine, I knew

219
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:51,530
you were the prince
I had been waiting for

220
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,371
Then beyond
my wildest dreams

221
00:24:55,608 --> 00:24:59,635
the prince became
my teacher

222
00:25:00,513 --> 00:25:06,645
Since that day all the time we spent
together has been like a dream

223
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:15,623
You'll never know how much effort
I put in trying to meet you again

224
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:25,537
I was so afraid you would
think my emotions were childish

225
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:30,809
My feeling got stronger as
we spent more time together.

226
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:33,673
I must confess to you

227
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:37,148
as I cannot hide
my feelings anymore

228
00:25:38,284 --> 00:25:40,650
Mr. Gong

229
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:43,246
I love you

230
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,795
Seok Gu
lets do the rooting bet again

231
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:04,408
See who is first to hump
Miss Kim

232
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:23,047
Dong Hyun!

233
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,482
Dong Hyun!

234
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:32,696
Mom.

235
00:27:38,771 --> 00:27:46,337
You know that your mother
has always trusted you?

236
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:10,859
First class
First class

237
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:15,398
Second class
Second class

238
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:36,926
Write one wish on
that piece of paper

239
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:38,860
What do we do with this?

240
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:41,198
This is this school tradition?

241
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:45,268
One person from the class
that wins the Sports carnival will be

242
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:48,306
picked to read wish

243
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,343
Last year
one trainee teacher wished

244
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:56,337
for a women's bathroom

245
00:28:56,782 --> 00:29:00,115
Is that why boy's school
has women's bathroom?

246
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:01,944
Yes!

247
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:08,090
This tradition has
been going on for 30 years

248
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,625
Please write a good one

249
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:17,965
Mr. Gong, please find someone
wonderful to marry

250
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,104
Your class isn't too bad

251
00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:30,979
But we are going to win, though

252
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:34,311
You never know
what will happen

253
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:52,762
Have some.
You know, if we win this final,

254
00:29:52,972 --> 00:29:56,635
that we win everything?

255
00:29:57,276 --> 00:29:59,073
Didn't you see?
Because of Gu Tae Shik

256
00:29:59,612 --> 00:30:02,672
Because of Gu Tae Shik from Class 1
we are half a lap behind

257
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:06,447
He's the captain of
the track team.

258
00:30:06,552 --> 00:30:11,512
Don't worry!
I am going to run in the finals

259
00:30:11,657 --> 00:30:14,558
And when we win
Mr. Gong will be overjoyed

260
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:17,860
We will now

261
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:25,492
have the 1000 meter relay as the final
event of this year's Sports carnival

262
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:32,074
The runner and teachers
please proceed to the starting line

263
00:30:32,545 --> 00:30:35,275
I will escort Mr. Gong

264
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:42,947
Are you trying to win
you piece of shit

265
00:30:52,665 --> 00:30:56,123
We still did a good job
coming on the second

266
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:58,170
We must win

267
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:02,273
Hey, isn't that the wish memo
the trainee teachers wrote?

268
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,555
Something things are more
important than rooting.

269
00:31:17,723 --> 00:31:19,088
Let's win this one

270
00:31:19,525 --> 00:31:23,188
- Okay, this one is for Dong Hyun
- Lets go!

271
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:27,862
You piece of shit, are you
gonna stand in our way?

272
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,898
Go, go class 6!

273
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,570
Lets give it all we have!

274
00:31:45,985 --> 00:31:49,284
Why aren't you saying
anything Miss Kim?

275
00:31:53,325 --> 00:32:00,822
Whether we win or lose, I'll never forget
the time we spent together

276
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,161
Lets try our best

277
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,077
Let's go class 6.
Go Go Go

278
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:17,046
Class 6 is the best

279
00:32:28,027 --> 00:32:29,517
Ready!

280
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:00,012
Seok Gu!

281
00:36:07,646 --> 00:36:10,206
This is our final day

282
00:36:13,152 --> 00:36:14,881
So it is

283
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:18,386
Will we see
each other again?

284
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:24,189
Of course.
It's not like we are going abroad

285
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:32,598
According to school tradition

286
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:39,734
Dong Hyun
from class 6 will pick a wish

287
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:47,752
Go ahead

288
00:36:59,164 --> 00:37:01,291
Mr. Gong

289
00:37:09,408 --> 00:37:15,210
Tell Miss Kim
how you really feel

290
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:48,073
Once a student
always a student

291
00:37:56,021 --> 00:37:57,648
Yoo Ri

292
00:38:04,596 --> 00:38:07,292
will you marry me?

293
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:42,260
At the age of 15
my wet dreams ended like that

294
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:00,318
Did you watch
'Entertainment Weekly' last night?

295
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,077
Yeah, I was shocked

296
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,383
How is it possible that Namil and
Hyo Jin are going out?

297
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:08,788
It's Namil this time?
It was Jong Kook last time

298
00:39:09,061 --> 00:39:10,494
What a whore!

299
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:15,259
That bitch! Doesn't she have
a scandal with Hiddink yet?

300
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:17,267
Anybody got any pads?
Why the hell does

301
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:20,264
it have to start now?

302
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:26,341
- Got one?
- Kyoung Lim, will this do?

303
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:30,507
You use that?
Looks creepy.

304
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:34,019
I was chatting
on the net last night

305
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:36,749
and one dude asked me
out saying he was a full-on stud

306
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:39,584
He wanted to meet
at Dae Huk Lor.

307
00:39:40,025 --> 00:39:41,856
So did you meet him?

308
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,187
So I bolted out because he said
he was drop dead good looking

309
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:46,457
And Uni students are
full of cash these days

310
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:49,290
So what was he like?

311
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:52,826
What a friggin let down!

312
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:57,466
He looks were so insulting
I kicked him in the balls right there

313
00:39:57,609 --> 00:39:59,975
in the middle of the street

314
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:02,908
Hey, here comes
the trainee teacher

315
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:23,434
Settle down
and let's greet our guest

316
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:30,305
- Attention, Greetings!
- Good morning

317
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,514
This is Mr. Ji SeokGu our new
trainee teacher for our class

318
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:43,744
No, I mean trainee teacher
Mr. Ji Seok Gu

319
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:48,416
- Please give him your utmost attention.
- Yes, ma'am!

320
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,958
It's so nice to meet you all.
I want to say

321
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:56,967
Is that everybody should

322
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:01,272
study hard...

323
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:05,099
That's it.
Thank you.

324
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:09,476
- Mr. Ji
- Yes?

325
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:14,909
What do you call
'that' in English?

326
00:41:22,561 --> 00:41:25,257
An English teacher
should know basic words.

327
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:26,723
It's THAT. THAT

328
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:40,301
Any way, I hope we can have
a pleasant time

329
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:44,706
for the next couple of weeks

330
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:47,853
Can I drink this?

331
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:49,013
Sure

332
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:55,756
We squeezed some for you

333
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:00,998
It tastes good

334
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:07,437
Okay, enough of that.
Let's start class

335
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,976
We'll study harder
if you sing us a song.

336
00:42:17,816 --> 00:42:21,274
Sing them a song.
I am sure they'll study harder

337
00:42:26,224 --> 00:42:31,184
You promise
you'll study harder

338
00:42:31,463 --> 00:42:33,899
if I sing you a song?

339
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:34,923
Yes!

340
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,652
Who are you?

341
00:43:04,496 --> 00:43:07,021
I suppose you are
the new trainee teacher?

342
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:13,368
Why?
What's wrong?

343
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:17,099
I suppose
you danced too hard?
