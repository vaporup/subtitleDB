1
00:00:00,947 --> 00:00:02,141
You...

2
00:00:07,788 --> 00:00:09,152
Where the hell
did you come from?

3
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:12,389
I work for Scorpio.

4
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:13,551
Scorpio?

5
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:17,932
I thought he was out.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,390
Stay still...

7
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:22,633
or else I'll slash you.

8
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:26,662
- Then, you're dead, too.
- I'm serious. Motherfucker.

9
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:31,542
Give me the knife.

10
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:36,378
Get him.

11
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,384
Whan.

12
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:48,393
Hey.

13
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:50,222
Hey!

14
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:53,133
Hey, aren't you
going to the market?

15
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:57,131
God,
I miss Sunny.

16
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:00,469
Let's go see her.

17
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,070
She's so sexy.

18
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:05,572
God, wake up.

19
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:08,408
- Hey...
- Hey, what the hell is this?

20
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:11,885
You there. Staying here
isn't going to solve anything.

21
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,617
Get out.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,691
When did you start operating?

23
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:29,462
A month ago.

24
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,635
We didn't know the building
was condemned.

25
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:33,468
We signed a lease.
What do we do?

26
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:37,335
Look, fellas, you should
have checked before signing.

27
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:55,325
Who are you?

28
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:58,623
I told you to get the hell out!

29
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:08,275
I'm sorry about your
situation but...

30
00:02:15,014 --> 00:02:15,878
Whan!

31
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:25,788
Any fucker can come
and try to mess with me.

32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,790
Lay your hands on me,
I'll cut you up!

33
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:30,656
What are you doing?
You insane?

34
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:32,364
Yeah,
I'm crazy.

35
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:34,056
You'd be crazy too
if you were in my shoes.

36
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,895
Just because your share in this is
small you may not be so desperate.

37
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:39,871
If I lose this place,
my life is over.

38
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,132
Where do you think you're going?

39
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,476
- Throw the knife away.
- Get out.

40
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,402
Don't do this.
Throw it away.

41
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:49,708
I'll kill you, too.
Son of a bitch.

42
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:11,058
This is not going to be
an easy case.

43
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:21,166
Don't come near me.

44
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:23,706
Don't come near me!

45
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:29,774
Hurry, just bring the money,
fuckers.

46
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:55,376
Your friend is
in for a serious crime.

47
00:04:56,343 --> 00:05:00,541
However, the prosecutors and
the investigators are friends of mine.

48
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:02,874
If we reach an agreement first,

49
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:07,218
we can pull some strings.
It's going to cost him.

50
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:42,419
You little rat.

51
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:44,983
I don't need this.

52
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:51,059
Crazy son of a bitch
who can't see anything.

53
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,691
Go ahead, stab me!
Stab me, you lousy son of a bitch.

54
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:55,061
Please,
don't do this.

55
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:57,896
How are we gonna make a living?

56
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,838
Cocksuckers. You're not
the only ones who are mad.

57
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:09,140
Did you bring it?

58
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:17,017
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:22,318
What? You think this
is enough for a settlement?

60
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,791
Please, we have to reach an
agreement before prosecution...

61
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:30,867
I promise to bring the rest.

62
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:34,267
- $3,000 more and I'll settle.
- Listen...

63
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:37,571
He's giving you a good deal 'cause you
kids seem to be in a difficult situation.

64
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:40,646
Ask around.

65
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:43,606
No one takes $6,000
for a case like this.

66
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:47,914
Damn,
there's nothing left to sell.

67
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:53,055
We hit Woojin first so we got
no reason for turning down duel.

68
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:56,660
He can't get involved directly.

69
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,731
'Cause he's got his arm injured.

70
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:03,394
Lots of first-class knuckleheads
working under Woojin.

71
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:08,532
So even though they're
outnumbered, they can survive.

72
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,945
- What?
- I'm looking for Taesoo. I'm Min.

73
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,419
My friend.
Tell him to wait.

74
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:22,512
Who's he?

75
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:27,620
I think I told you about him.
He's my best friend, Min.

76
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,932
Why haven't you been talking?

77
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:37,628
- What's up?
- Thought you were busy.

78
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:40,600
Busy? Make time for you.
Let's roll.

79
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:51,008
Whan!

80
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:57,682
Why did they release me?

81
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:03,325
I've been here since 9 o'clock.
Eat this.

82
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:09,102
You can't afford a lawyer.

83
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:11,635
Forget about it.

84
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:15,867
Let's get something to eat.
What do you want?

85
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:20,740
Does Sunny know about this?

86
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:22,715
How can she?

87
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,180
Tell Sunny that...

88
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:31,392
I had a little trouble with the mob
so I had to lay low for a while.

89
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:33,889
You crazy fuck!

90
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,793
- You fool...
- Hey...

91
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:40,893
Hey,
I've been to the slammer.

92
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:44,663
Oh, yeah?
Come on.

93
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:46,235
Mom!

94
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:48,929
Hold it!

95
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:56,435
Keep your word.

96
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:58,498
It's difficult to find men
who keep their word.

97
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:01,663
You win this one,
but...

98
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:07,069
- if you invade our territory again...
- it's war! Let's go.

99
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,090
They may attack anytime.

100
00:11:20,427 --> 00:11:21,985
Get ready in 24 hours.

101
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:24,152
Come here.

102
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:27,862
Yo, Won... Check the club first,
and then get your boys together.

103
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:30,828
Have them stationed in each
district within 24 hours. - Yes, sir.

104
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:43,382
This mob thing is
a real shitty business.

105
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:47,416
You can't trust anyone.

106
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:51,717
Boss likes you.

107
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:58,226
So,
your name is Min.

108
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,967
Let's get a drink?

109
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:03,427
Later.

110
00:12:11,877 --> 00:12:13,505
You're such a dumb ass.

111
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:17,875
Take it.
It's a bonus.

112
00:12:21,353 --> 00:12:23,480
This is it.
No more fighting.

113
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:01,418
You know I lied to you?

114
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:08,199
Romy was never in New York.

115
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:15,297
She told me that she had spent
over a year in a sanitarium.

116
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:20,476
She also told me about
Kyung's suicide,

117
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:28,913
But I was too tired to listen.

118
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:43,465
Everyone looks happy.

119
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:47,270
Except me...

120
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:52,444
How many do you think
are really happy?

121
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,509
Ever since I was little,
I thought I could do anything.

122
00:14:02,322 --> 00:14:04,152
Then I screwed up.

123
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,719
You know what my dad said?

124
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:14,994
He said I fell in the early
part of the race in my life.

125
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:18,701
So,
if I stand up and run again,

126
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:22,739
I can be faster
than anyone else.

127
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:27,741
Do you feel the same way?

128
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:34,681
You still don't know me.

129
00:14:36,723 --> 00:14:39,953
I'm trying to stand up.

130
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,089
It's pathetic.

131
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:55,206
Do you want to know
how I really feel?

132
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,478
In the end,
you'll go to college.

133
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:04,078
And when you graduate,

134
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:08,179
you'll meet a man from
a good family and get married.

135
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:15,188
You're just out for a walk now.

136
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:18,020
You know?

137
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,132
Let go.

138
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:55,223
Romy was living in her own hell.

139
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:57,795
My past two years...

140
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:02,272
weren't exactly spent
in heaven either.

141
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,645
Everything was trembling.

142
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:17,313
Everything before my eyes...

143
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,697
We need to have a serious talk,
Romy.

144
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:31,270
Do you remember what
Richard Bach said?

145
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,900
About the bird that flies
higher seeing further?

146
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:41,176
You can broaden your
view overseas.

147
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:44,348
I don't want to fly high.
Or see far.

148
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:47,643
If you fly low,
you can see things up close.

149
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:48,645
Romy!

150
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,685
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Sit down.

151
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:54,887
I told you I'm not
going to college!

152
00:16:57,362 --> 00:16:59,262
Then you can study overseas.

153
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,130
I thought I was abroad studying.

154
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,301
That's what you told everyone.

155
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:07,036
Fine,
you don't have to go.

156
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:09,737
But being who you are, do you really
think you can stand your friends...

157
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:11,574
looking down on you?

158
00:17:16,116 --> 00:17:19,415
Romy! You're just temporarily
out of the race...

159
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,418
- If you just pick yourself up...
- Not that story again, Dad.

160
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:27,724
I'm going to stay down,
for the rest of my life!

161
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:47,636
Whan,
you have to...

162
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:51,377
open a big restaurant someday.

163
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,485
Thanks.

164
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:01,758
Min!

165
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:06,190
Do you know how hard it was
to find this place?

166
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:09,496
These are so heavy.
My arms are killing me.

167
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:10,762
How are you?

168
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,871
Hey, come in a little later.
The room is a fucking pigsty.

169
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:30,453
I...
ran away from home.

170
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,321
Let's go in.

171
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,892
Romy had things
her way all the time.

172
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:46,369
There she was right in front of me,
confusing me all over again.

173
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:51,004
Still...
I was glad to see her.

174
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,405
Eat dinner?

175
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,514
Can you tell him
to go somewhere?

176
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:05,356
I want to be alone with you.

177
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:11,763
Romy,
this is Whan's place.

178
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,125
He's letting me crash here.

179
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:29,972
I asked Taesoo for help.

180
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:34,110
Come in.

181
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:45,329
Taesoo found a place
for us to stay.

182
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:47,696
He even lent me some money.

183
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:50,836
It didn't feel good but...

184
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:55,074
I was glad
I could do something

185
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:58,236
for Romy.

186
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:03,914
Wait a second.

187
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:09,616
Like it?

188
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:13,548
No?

189
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:16,289
It's not that.

190
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:19,825
Are you close to Taesoo?

191
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,328
Yeah,
like brothers. Why?

192
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:24,701
I don't like him.

193
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:29,338
He scares me.
Puts me in a funk.

194
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:35,646
God,
having a pad is a pain.

195
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:38,039
Why?

196
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,245
Don't you think it's weird?

197
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:47,020
There's not a single piece
of furniture in this place.

198
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:06,031
Wake up!

199
00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:14,302
Is breakfast ready?

200
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:21,248
- Hey... Get up.
- Okay, I will! I'm up.

201
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:25,619
Fuck,
I'm a first time offender.

202
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,754
But that's not a big deal.

203
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:31,924
What matters is how you live.

204
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,795
That's not a big deal.
...fuck.

205
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:38,632
I'm really going to pay back Min.
Everything.

206
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:50,840
Hey, hey.

207
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:53,380
Have you done it?

208
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:55,852
What?

209
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,250
You know. Men.
Women. Sex!

210
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:04,187
Did you?

211
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:08,365
C'mon, tell me.

212
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:11,232
Don't you want do it with me?

213
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:14,069
Can't you see I'm reading?

214
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:19,945
I told you.
We're not right for each other.

215
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:27,513
You don't want me
when you look at me?

216
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:30,351
How does it feel like?

217
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:33,719
- Say something. - Hey, give it back.
- Say something.

218
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:37,785
It happens naturally
if you both want each other.

219
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:40,865
You don't want me?

220
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:45,895
- Don't answer it. - I have to.
- C'mon, leave it.

221
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:48,137
Tell me about it...

222
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:49,834
Where you going?

223
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,567
- Come here, come here.
- Hello.

224
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:54,508
- Don't answer it. Just hang up.
- Yeah, it's me.

225
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:56,544
Tell me about it...

226
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,445
Sure. Later.

227
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:00,743
Where you going?

228
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:04,352
Taesoo wants to see me.

229
00:24:07,692 --> 00:24:08,522
Back soon.

230
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:37,013
For some reason,
I felt uneasy.

231
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,014
Think I loved her too much.

232
00:24:42,428 --> 00:24:45,261
Hurry up, guys.
Listen up while you put them on.

233
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:48,431
We're from Dong-A Wrecking Co. no
matter what, understand? - Yes, sir!

234
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:58,435
She could walk out on me
anytime.

235
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:05,139
I felt pathetic.
Insecure...

236
00:25:59,338 --> 00:25:59,770
Let's go.

237
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,272
We can't control the situation.

238
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:05,473
They won't evacuate
from the condemned buildings.

239
00:26:05,678 --> 00:26:08,942
I got it.
Listen up!

240
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:10,914
No smashing heads.

241
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:13,579
- Go for the shoulders and thighs, Ok?
- Yeah!

242
00:26:13,718 --> 00:26:14,241
Now, go on.

243
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:15,820
Take this.

244
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:20,281
- I'm going home.
- Asshole...

245
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,587
we need you for a head count.

246
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,254
This is what you meant by "gifts"
and "success"?

247
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:28,929
Been worse shit than this.

248
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:32,562
You know we can't choose things.

249
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,838
- You've let me down, Taesoo.
- Min.

250
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:47,544
Hey, Min.

251
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,588
I'm out of here.

252
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:55,825
Taesoo, we're in.
What should we do?

253
00:26:56,027 --> 00:26:57,495
- Shut the fuck up!
- Sir...

254
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:21,811
You're in this together.
Aren't you, dickhead?

255
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:24,745
Hey, he's a gang member,
too.

256
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,621
You can't force us out of here.

257
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:31,228
Don't you have your parent?
Son of a bitch!

258
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:33,125
Min!

259
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:20,106
You're awake. Sorry,
I wanted to come sooner but...

260
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,713
You do what you want,
and I'll do what I want.

261
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:24,313
Romy,
what's wrong?

262
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:26,013
Can't you see?

263
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:29,112
I want someone
who can be with me.

264
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,285
Do you know how I feel
when you do this?

265
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,151
Did you ever care about me?

266
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:40,529
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.

267
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,894
I saw Kyung tonight.

268
00:28:47,673 --> 00:28:48,764
She was staring at me.

269
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:51,942
I was scared.
I couldn't even breathe.

270
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,741
I waited for you...

271
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:57,513
'cause you're the only one
who can protect me. - Sorry

272
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,708
Where were you?

273
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:01,880
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you still had those nightmares.

274
00:29:02,353 --> 00:29:04,686
It wasn't a nightmare.
She was here.

275
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,288
Hey, it's just an illusion.
Your own guilt.

276
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,865
Get it together.

277
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:16,192
Don't treat me
like a sick person.

278
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,937
- Romy.
- Let go. No more arguing with you.

279
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,603
- Romy.
- Let go! Let go!

280
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,605
You don't know
anything about me!

281
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:29,673
What-don't you think
about anyone else?

282
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:34,685
Look at me. Shit goes down.
I'm fucking wrecked.

283
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:39,049
Why does it have to be
your feelings first, huh?

284
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:44,026
Hey, did you ever
stop to think about me?

285
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:49,526
I don't pretend to be
a good person like you.

286
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:52,299
Everyone thinks about
their own selves first.

287
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:56,938
Let go.

288
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:11,246
I wanted to make her stay.

289
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:17,961
But,
Romy was too much.

290
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:24,199
When she was with me,
I felt nervous...

291
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,306
and when she left,
I felt deserted.

292
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:30,204
Thank you for coming.

293
00:30:39,418 --> 00:30:42,750
You dance so hot.
Keep going...

294
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:47,450
Sunny.
Sunny.

295
00:30:48,026 --> 00:30:50,655
- Wait!
- Why? - Just wait!

296
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,392
I got you something.
Put it on.

297
00:30:56,602 --> 00:31:00,060
Hey,
now that you have my back,

298
00:31:00,271 --> 00:31:02,365
it'll be cool.

299
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:08,004
They say I made it too fast.

300
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:11,442
But that's bullshit.

301
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:13,977
You know what my dream is?

302
00:31:14,954 --> 00:31:16,147
I'm going to be a boss.

303
00:31:16,923 --> 00:31:21,086
Someone everyone knows
and respects.

304
00:31:22,594 --> 00:31:26,155
Min.
I'm going to do it.

305
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:30,700
When you've got it,
no one fucks around with you.

306
00:31:34,138 --> 00:31:35,071
You'll see.

307
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:38,407
Taesoo is going to be somebody.

308
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:40,003
Good for you.

309
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:44,745
I'm a fuck up.

310
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:50,013
Hey,
you're the only one I respect.

311
00:31:56,027 --> 00:32:00,328
Today, we're gonna drink 'til
we pass out, all right?

312
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:07,366
I'm already gone.

313
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,275
Just one more bottle.

314
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:12,942
I don't want it.

315
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:17,544
- I don't like gifts for no reason.
- Hey, but it's for you.

316
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:21,548
- Min.
- Hey, man. Are you okay?

317
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:24,678
I'm fine.
Let me go.

318
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:27,852
Hey... c'mon...

319
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:41,302
Taesoo controlled
his life like a man.

320
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:50,013
As for me,
I had none.

321
00:32:56,487 --> 00:33:00,514
Min! Hey,
get up.

322
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,170
How long did I sleep?
Don't get up. It's still dark.

323
00:33:24,717 --> 00:33:26,081
Want some water?

324
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:30,945
You know what my dream is?

325
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,923
I want to be a singer.

326
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,750
What's yours?

327
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:39,889
Nothing.

328
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:46,560
I wish you could be my man.

329
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,365
You like me?

330
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:50,132
Yeah.

331
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:53,611
I can't make you happy...

332
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,612
- and I don't have nothing.
- Still I like you.

333
00:37:21,353 --> 00:37:22,753
Min.
Hey-wake up.

334
00:37:30,195 --> 00:37:32,187
Don't you think
you're way over your head?

335
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:33,688
Get out.

336
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:36,332
Fuck this.

337
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:41,104
Leave me alone.

338
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:43,432
Something I said?

339
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:46,410
You look like shit,
you know.

340
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,009
Asshole!

341
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:49,875
Hey!

342
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:52,548
Get it together.

343
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:57,014
- Stay out of it.
- No, you get out and don't bother him.

344
00:37:57,189 --> 00:38:01,091
Min doesn't take orders
from nobody.

345
00:38:03,862 --> 00:38:05,021
Did you fuck her?

346
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:09,724
Hey, Whan.
What did you say?

347
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:11,700
Just say yes or no.

348
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:13,338
Shut the fuck up.

349
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:16,030
So gang members can
screw everyone, is that it?

350
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:19,110
What? You son of a bitch!
Who the fuck do you think you are?

351
00:38:19,245 --> 00:38:22,009
Fuck you.

352
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,740
You fucked her. And you call
yourself a friend? Asshole.

353
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:52,834
Taesoo.
Do something.

354
00:38:58,682 --> 00:39:01,414
Hey, back off. He's your friend.
Don't make a fool of yourself.

355
00:39:01,554 --> 00:39:02,577
Let go.

356
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:05,990
I know you can fight.
So, go ahead, hit me.

357
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:07,490
Whan,
you fuck ass...

358
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:24,898
Hey,
you're asking for it.

359
00:39:25,745 --> 00:39:29,942
Oh yeah, take your best shot,
come on.

360
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:35,054
I know it's Romy.

361
00:39:35,387 --> 00:39:37,184
But she's not the only pussy
in the world.

362
00:39:39,325 --> 00:39:40,416
Shit...

363
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:52,067
Fuck,
you cocksucker.

364
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:55,362
Get the fuck out.

365
00:39:59,045 --> 00:40:01,478
Somebody help.
Stop them.

366
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:15,259
Stop it, man.
Please. Stop!

367
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:31,637
Hey, I'm leaving
this fucking dump...

368
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:34,969
Sunny.

369
00:40:36,014 --> 00:40:38,106
Whan,
you listen good.

370
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:39,945
I'm not a whore.

371
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:42,451
I slept with Min
'cause I like him.

372
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:44,447
So what?

373
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:54,530
Boss. Let me take
over Sang's night clubs.

374
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:56,264
Don't rush it.

375
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:57,594
I can handle it.

376
00:40:58,804 --> 00:41:01,670
I'd give my life to
make the business.

377
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:13,847
Boss.
Don't you trust me?

378
00:41:17,689 --> 00:41:20,920
If you make it too fast,
you'll be a target.

379
00:41:21,326 --> 00:41:23,295
That doesn't scare me.

380
00:41:23,695 --> 00:41:24,753
I am.

381
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:28,661
Take it slow.
Work it easy.

382
00:41:31,603 --> 00:41:32,831
Those are my rules.

383
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:48,611
It's me,
Taesoo.

384
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:51,451
Hope you're feelin' better.

385
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,584
Call me up,
okay?

386
00:42:06,438 --> 00:42:10,170
This is Whan.
Pick up the phone if you're there.

387
00:42:13,612 --> 00:42:15,341
- Whan.
- Look out the window.

388
00:42:15,747 --> 00:42:17,738
- Whan, the other day, I was...
- Come to the window.

389
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,983
Now I don't owe you anything.

390
00:43:03,396 --> 00:43:04,454
Strange...

391
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,557
I can't picture Romy's face.

392
00:43:14,072 --> 00:43:17,371
But I can still smell her.
Feel her.

393
00:43:21,713 --> 00:43:23,180
Miss her crazy bad.

394
00:43:36,795 --> 00:43:38,764
It's better than pork ribs.

395
00:43:39,097 --> 00:43:41,327
Help yourself.
Welcome!

396
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:56,304
- Some more soup, please.
- Sure.

397
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:00,384
Careful,
it's hot.

398
00:44:04,823 --> 00:44:08,987
Whan,
get me a bottle of Soju.

399
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,867
How's business?

400
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:24,539
Do I still owe you something?

401
00:44:24,977 --> 00:44:27,706
Whan.
I'm sorry.

402
00:44:29,581 --> 00:44:31,447
About Sunny,
I made a mistake.

403
00:44:33,052 --> 00:44:34,178
I'm really sorry.

404
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,548
How would you feel
if I slept with Romy?

405
00:44:41,192 --> 00:44:42,490
Let's not see
each other anymore.

406
00:44:43,396 --> 00:44:45,454
I don't want to make trouble.

407
00:44:47,265 --> 00:44:48,527
I'm going to change.

408
00:44:48,768 --> 00:44:50,826
I can make it by myself.

409
00:44:51,437 --> 00:44:54,463
Forget about me.
Do your own thing.

410
00:45:02,247 --> 00:45:03,442
Let me tell you something.

411
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:06,780
You're not a bum.

412
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:09,813
Don't fuck your life
'cause of Taesoo.

413
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:15,719
You're smart,
you'll be okay.

414
00:45:23,936 --> 00:45:25,369
Got to go.

415
00:46:14,186 --> 00:46:15,914
The boss here?

416
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:26,227
There you are.

417
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:29,960
Congratulations.
It's a great place.

418
00:46:30,134 --> 00:46:31,795
You'll soon be a conglomerate.

419
00:46:35,472 --> 00:46:36,441
Sit down.

420
00:46:39,678 --> 00:46:40,974
You kids wait outside.

421
00:46:47,152 --> 00:46:49,052
This wasn't a clean job.

422
00:46:49,722 --> 00:46:52,213
If the press gets on our back,
we're in deep.

423
00:46:53,091 --> 00:46:55,026
If we get a good deal with
the prosecutor,

424
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:57,356
it'll be less than two years.

425
00:46:58,863 --> 00:47:02,923
During your absence, Woojin
here will look after your business.

426
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:06,829
You've met before,
right?

427
00:47:10,576 --> 00:47:11,941
I need time.

428
00:47:36,902 --> 00:47:39,530
Are you there?
Min. It's Taesoo.

429
00:47:39,905 --> 00:47:42,499
Scorpio betrayed me.
It's a war.

430
00:47:43,474 --> 00:47:45,305
Get down here fast,
I got no time.

431
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:51,072
Boss,
there's no answer from Kee.

432
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,179
Think word is out?

433
00:47:55,621 --> 00:47:57,612
Think Scorpio is stupid?
Asshole.

434
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,423
He starts by cutting our hands
and legs.

435
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:01,115
We strike first.

436
00:48:03,695 --> 00:48:06,095
- If not tonight, we're dead.
- Okay.

437
00:50:19,831 --> 00:50:23,289
Promise you'll only love me.

438
00:50:26,905 --> 00:50:28,338
What are you going to do now?

439
00:50:31,777 --> 00:50:35,041
I don't know.
Maybe go to the army.

440
00:50:36,646 --> 00:50:41,642
Go to college. If you start now,
you'll get in next year.

441
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:45,421
Don't count on it.

442
00:50:47,492 --> 00:50:48,789
I can't.

443
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:50,454
You haven't tried.

444
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:52,553
You can do it.

445
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:55,655
I'll study,
too.

446
00:50:57,001 --> 00:50:58,936
As soon as we go to college,
let's get married.

447
00:50:59,737 --> 00:51:01,204
A year after,

448
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:02,567
we can go abroad
to France or the US.

449
00:51:05,844 --> 00:51:07,835
I'll help you until
you take the exam.

450
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,280
I can't be at home anyway.

451
00:51:24,262 --> 00:51:27,527
You motherfuckers,
where the fuck are you?

452
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,625
Come out like a man!

453
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:33,894
Boss,
over there!

454
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:42,140
Shit...

455
00:52:15,012 --> 00:52:16,947
- Hello?
- Min!

456
00:52:17,115 --> 00:52:19,673
Taesoo's in deep.
We're at the night club...

457
00:52:21,152 --> 00:52:23,586
Hello? Hello?

458
00:52:28,927 --> 00:52:30,018
Where to?

459
00:52:30,862 --> 00:52:34,822
To the store for
some cigarettes.

460
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,666
What about me?

461
00:52:37,035 --> 00:52:39,365
Stay.
I'll be back soon.

462
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:51,403
Get some sleep.

463
00:53:44,702 --> 00:53:46,432
Just returning your knife.

464
00:54:02,387 --> 00:54:04,651
I'll kill you motherfucker.

465
00:54:05,624 --> 00:54:08,854
I'll cut you up good...
so you stay there.

466
00:54:26,745 --> 00:54:29,009
You dug your own grave with
your greed.

467
00:54:42,027 --> 00:54:43,494
You little prick.
You come for the corpse?

468
00:54:43,661 --> 00:54:44,628
Stop.

469
00:54:46,298 --> 00:54:48,128
He's gone.

470
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:50,227
Why not let him go?

471
00:54:56,841 --> 00:54:57,899
Hand him over.

472
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,524
Get the hell out.

473
00:55:19,697 --> 00:55:23,566
If I see either one of you...
you're dead!

474
00:55:23,735 --> 00:55:27,000
Heavy to carry home,
ain't it?

475
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:36,568
Taesoo.

476
00:55:37,883 --> 00:55:40,407
I always thought I had nothing
to lose in this world.

477
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,285
I never had anything.

478
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:47,655
But I had you.

479
00:55:50,262 --> 00:55:54,027
I'm so fucking angry.

480
00:55:54,298 --> 00:55:55,595
It's all nothing.

481
00:55:58,536 --> 00:56:02,530
It's too late.
You're killing me.

482
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:05,134
Taesoo,
wake up.

483
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:07,134
Taesoo...

484
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:11,939
Taesoo, please.
Damn it.

485
00:56:14,052 --> 00:56:15,039
Taesoo...

486
00:56:17,822 --> 00:56:18,847
Taesoo...

487
00:56:24,996 --> 00:56:26,019
Taesoo...

488
00:58:45,536 --> 00:58:46,561
Kill the bastard!

489
01:00:22,733 --> 01:00:24,701
Where are you?

490
01:00:24,835 --> 01:00:28,134
Hurry back.
I don't want to be here alone.

491
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:32,740
Get some ice cream and bread
on your way back. Bye!

492
01:00:54,198 --> 01:00:55,826
I had no dreams.

493
01:00:58,670 --> 01:00:59,829
Romy...

494
01:01:01,872 --> 01:01:06,776
But now I have so many dreams.

495
01:01:09,713 --> 01:01:10,942
Whan and Taesoo,

496
01:01:13,651 --> 01:01:16,278
and all those times together
with you...

497
01:01:21,459 --> 01:01:26,521
Everything feels like
a beautiful dream.

498
01:01:29,768 --> 01:01:34,137
Romy,
I miss you.

499
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:43,045
But I can't come to you.
