1
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:08,837
I had no dreams.

2
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:14,979
When I was nineteen,

3
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:17,408
I didn't do anything.

4
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:20,777
Every night,

5
00:01:21,486 --> 00:01:23,010
all I did was hang
out with Taesoo

6
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:25,983
and fight with the gangs
in the neighborhood.

7
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:30,662
That was my life back then.

8
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,045
This goes 300km.

9
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:06,783
This baby is mine.

10
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,617
I'm serious.

11
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:12,048
And you're going to be
the only to ride it.

12
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,819
Remember the guys
we met earlier?

13
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:20,021
They want us to work for them.

14
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:26,302
I got us hired.

15
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:31,067
We can't be doing
this low life shit.

16
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,276
We both like the fast life.

17
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:41,745
I'm switching schools.
My old lady wants it.

18
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,989
For better grades,
I guess.

19
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:50,659
Going to college?

20
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:17,045
I never thought about college.

21
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,488
I had to get away.

22
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:26,492
Of course,
moving to another school

23
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:29,024
wasn't going to change

24
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:31,935
anything...

25
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:36,670
You.
You're late the first day.

26
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:46,117
I'm talking to you.
Hey!

27
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:47,415
Look at me.

28
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:54,355
If you cause any problems, I'll personally
take care of you. Is that clear?

29
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:57,456
Say something.

30
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:01,360
Yes.

31
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,630
I don't like your face.

32
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:08,401
Mr. Kim.

33
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,639
Our new student.
Get out.

34
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:12,040
This way.

35
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:14,771
Welcome.

36
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:17,737
So, you're Min?

37
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,646
I'm your home room teacher.

38
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:23,384
Hope you like it here.

39
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:26,821
Whan was the first guy
I met at school.

40
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:31,923
Whan was the kind of guy
who bragged about the fact...

41
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:35,526
that he started sniffing glue
in 5th grade.

42
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:58,319
I don't give a shit about
where you hung out, asshole.

43
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:00,459
Know who you're fucking with,
huh?

44
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:09,560
He was full of shit.
But he was O.K.

45
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:18,336
- Anything else?
- Up yours.

46
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,276
I went easy on you. Don't fucking
walk out on me. I'll kill you.

47
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:26,173
Come back here.

48
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:54,012
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

49
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:55,310
Go ahead.

50
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:03,786
I got you a pager.

51
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:06,882
My mom got me one this morning.

52
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:10,321
I can get you something else.

53
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:14,627
Hmm... a boyfriend
with a face like Brad Pitt.

54
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:17,367
Can't get into college
with a boyfriend.

55
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:24,002
Whan, hey, Whan!
What's up?

56
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:27,410
Come on.
Stop sniffing glue.

57
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:31,009
Hey,
get your ass out here.

58
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:40,548
Fuck.
Man has no peace...

59
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:45,889
Consider yourself lucky.

60
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:51,930
I screwed my back up.
In one fight I took on 17 suckers.

61
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:55,136
If it wasn't for that,
you would've been fucked.

62
00:08:57,976 --> 00:08:58,841
Another round?

63
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:02,644
Just kidding.

64
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,043
Let's go check out
the rich girls.

65
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:48,284
Introducing today's high light.
...Min!

66
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:09,538
$100

67
00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:12,745
$100?

68
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:14,985
Hey,
that's not fair!

69
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,389
Congratulations,
he's yours.

70
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,695
Over here.

71
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:44,309
How are your grades?

72
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:48,817
- What?
- How are your grades?

73
00:10:52,091 --> 00:10:55,025
- You can't go to college with that.
- Are you good in school?

74
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,592
Straight A's since first grade.

75
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:13,677
I like the Beatles.
Just do.

76
00:11:13,846 --> 00:11:15,938
To tell you the truth,
I like you.

77
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,714
But remember,
you're still my slave.

78
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:24,150
Don't give this
number to anyone.

79
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:30,052
When I call, you have to come
no matter what.

80
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:35,958
Gotta go to study.
Bye!

81
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:24,208
My baby.

82
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,118
You've been studying.

83
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,567
Drunk again?

84
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:51,836
Watch who you hang out with.

85
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:56,410
I've been breaking my back

86
00:12:57,216 --> 00:13:00,879
selling insurance
to save for your college.

87
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:08,393
This is Romy.

88
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,958
The third playoff between LG
and Lotte is at Chamshil tomorrow.

89
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,028
Go see the game and
write down everything.

90
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:21,105
If you screw up...

91
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:23,633
you're no longer my slave.

92
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:26,134
Got it,
Min? Bye!

93
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:29,174
Those LG cheerleaders...

94
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:31,611
had these thin hard bodies,
and could really move.

95
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:34,178
Bottom of the 9th with 2 out,
LG took out the 4th hitter

96
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:36,248
and sent in a pinch hitter.

97
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,381
They go on ahead and bam!

98
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:43,061
Get a hit.

99
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:44,489
Cool.

100
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:47,597
With exams next week,
how can you go off and watch a game?

101
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:51,260
They're still a week away.

102
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:55,032
Nerds really gross me out.

103
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:57,101
So you go to college,
and then what?

104
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:59,072
I can't believe you.

105
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:05,845
There you are.

106
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:10,186
Later.

107
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,331
If I knew you were such a baseball fan,
I would have taken you with me.

108
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:25,928
I'm not into baseball.

109
00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:29,797
Sex, screen, and sports...
are for losers.

110
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:33,534
You think kids who watch baseball
do anything with their lives?

111
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:35,344
I'm going to college and
I'm going places.

112
00:14:45,323 --> 00:14:47,188
All my friends are in the top

113
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:53,159
And 12 of them go to my school.

114
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:59,160
I may not make it.

115
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:03,399
Does that scare you?

116
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:07,245
No, but I don't
want to be a loser.

117
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:09,575
My pride won't let me.

118
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:12,910
Everything is about survival.

119
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:16,113
You do what it takes.

120
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:19,788
Does that turn you off?

121
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:23,484
No,
I respect people...

122
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:27,792
like you
with clear goals in life.

123
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:31,634
Of course,
a slave must respect his master.

124
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,643
Romy wasn't like
any girl I ever met.

125
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:51,922
She always smelled good.

126
00:15:55,594 --> 00:16:01,225
She was confident.

127
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:04,931
Cut it out.

128
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:08,634
I can get off track like this.

129
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:19,775
I really like you.

130
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:23,178
So you've got to
go to college, too.

131
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:49,076
Min!

132
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:51,941
Hey,
someone's calling you.

133
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:53,581
Min!

134
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:57,383
Min!

135
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:00,381
It had been 4 months.

136
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:03,620
But...

137
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:07,655
Taesoo didn't say much.

138
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:15,000
I dropped out...

139
00:17:19,644 --> 00:17:20,737
two months ago.

140
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:27,775
Hey, Min.
Check this out.

141
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:31,017
I asked the cook for
some extra noodles.

142
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,882
What's up?
Get me a drink.

143
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:36,182
And wait.

144
00:17:36,494 --> 00:17:38,519
I just paged this
hot college chick.

145
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:45,296
Drinks are fucking on tonight.

146
00:17:46,305 --> 00:17:48,000
- Whan.
- Huh?

147
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,205
Sorry man,
could you leave us alone?

148
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:54,742
Call me for the dough.

149
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:12,790
- So?
- Nothing...

150
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,588
just wanted to see you.

151
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:24,469
I'm going.

152
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:28,508
You're wasted.
You can't ride the bike.

153
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,298
Don't get off.

154
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,334
I got it today...

155
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:00,608
and I thought about
who should ride it if I don't.

156
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:09,846
You.

157
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,290
Got some business.
Stay out.

158
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,330
I watched Taesoo get
the shit kicked out of him.

159
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:06,596
Felt like shit

160
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:10,199
'cause I didn't do anything.

161
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:30,088
Yours?

162
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:15,064
Don't let this bike
get to your head.

163
00:22:15,606 --> 00:22:16,664
You look like a degenerate.

164
00:22:20,178 --> 00:22:21,166
Mom, it's me.

165
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:23,340
How come you're late?

166
00:22:23,647 --> 00:22:26,013
Your English tutor's been
waiting over a half an hour.

167
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:31,253
Let go.

168
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:34,554
Don't you feel anything for me?

169
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:38,357
Before college,
I'm a studying machine.

170
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:41,327
A machine has no time for
any feelings.

171
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:46,559
Romy.

172
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:30,310
I started to like that girl.

173
00:23:34,818 --> 00:23:37,616
The college exam was coming up.

174
00:23:38,557 --> 00:23:40,457
All I could think about was
Taesoo and Romy.

175
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:44,828
Class was meaningless.

176
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,930
All I could do was to wait for
Romy to page me.

177
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:15,121
You messed up your exams?

178
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:20,489
I met some guys...
and I sort of got distracted.

179
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:23,757
Kyung,
how did you do?

180
00:24:26,037 --> 00:24:27,834
Worse than me.

181
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:32,173
I don't know what you do.

182
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:34,207
You party all the time
and still ace everything.

183
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:38,842
Cheer up. What's important is
the college score, anyway.

184
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:43,443
In the worst case,
you can try next year.

185
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:45,186
Another year of this shit?

186
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,083
I'm afraid to look at my mom.

187
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:52,228
If I can't get into Seoul National
University, she told me to drop dead.

188
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,025
That's low.

189
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:58,330
But everyone in your family
went to that school.

190
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:32,060
He doesn't realize
what I put up with.

191
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:34,328
Mrs. Kim,
please calm down.

192
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:37,766
If he tries harder,
we'll see some good results.

193
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:41,534
These bad grades.

194
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:44,111
Least now you know.
I just want a diploma.

195
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:46,442
You can quit school
and take the college exam.

196
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,050
- You're smart enough.
- Don't be so tough on him.

197
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:54,086
And you should understand
your mother.

198
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,657
Are you going to
live with my mom?

199
00:25:57,996 --> 00:25:59,019
What are you saying?

200
00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:03,160
Don't be so rude!

201
00:26:03,968 --> 00:26:05,026
Please,
be good to her.

202
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:13,436
Min, Min!
Where are you going?

203
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:50,440
I'm not going home.

204
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:11,826
Want a drink?

205
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:15,663
I'm going to call a friend.

206
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,006
Whan. It's me.

207
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,712
Sorry but I can't
make it tonight.

208
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:32,873
You know.

209
00:28:37,387 --> 00:28:38,445
No,
it's not that.

210
00:28:40,057 --> 00:28:41,525
No... you shithead!
Okay, sorry.

211
00:29:13,191 --> 00:29:13,713
Romy!

212
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:15,750
Romy!

213
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:18,088
Romy! Open up!

214
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,657
Romy!

215
00:29:27,638 --> 00:29:28,298
Romy!

216
00:29:35,747 --> 00:29:37,681
That...
was the last time I saw Romy.

217
00:29:40,884 --> 00:29:43,410
What did I tell you?

218
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:47,824
Graduation is soon, so I go easy on
you, and all you do is make trouble.

219
00:29:49,027 --> 00:29:52,053
- Wise up.
- I'm sorry.

220
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,288
Straighten up!

221
00:29:54,632 --> 00:29:56,599
With these grades,

222
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:59,730
you can't even make it to
a junior college.

223
00:30:01,506 --> 00:30:03,565
You'll never be anybody.

224
00:30:04,608 --> 00:30:06,634
Straighten up!
You little prick!

225
00:30:06,844 --> 00:30:08,573
What about trade school?

226
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:13,747
Hm...?

227
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,681
Kid, what do you
think you're doing?

228
00:30:17,955 --> 00:30:18,683
Stop it.

229
00:30:19,423 --> 00:30:20,891
Hey,
isn't corporal punishment illegal?

230
00:30:22,192 --> 00:30:22,852
Whan, stand up.

231
00:30:59,497 --> 00:31:01,055
At full speed,

232
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:03,260
the world becomes silent...

233
00:31:04,568 --> 00:31:06,161
and I'm sucked into a point.

234
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:10,904
But I can never go through it.

235
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:13,535
The closer I get,
the farther it becomes.

236
00:31:15,212 --> 00:31:18,114
Romy,
where are you?

237
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:33,657
Imagine a fucking big restaurant,
all mine!

238
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:37,425
I'll be cruising in a nice car,
in a black three-piece suit...

239
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:40,498
with a blond chick like
Meg Ryan next to me.

240
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:41,971
What do you think?

241
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:48,142
How about you?

242
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:50,073
What can I do?

243
00:31:58,056 --> 00:31:59,785
I guess anything's
better than now.

244
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:12,596
Fuck, anything
but getting kicked out is O.K.

245
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:17,195
My old man's wish is
my high school diploma.

246
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,384
- Whan...
- Huh?

247
00:32:30,621 --> 00:32:32,087
can I stay with you?

248
00:32:34,592 --> 00:32:36,025
What's with this running
away from home shit?

249
00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:40,057
If you don't want me...

250
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,232
What?
Are you out?

251
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:49,467
Half the rent.

252
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:07,648
Min!
Taesoo here.

253
00:33:09,693 --> 00:33:11,320
Life ain't that bad here.

254
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:14,763
You know,
I work it.

255
00:33:16,534 --> 00:33:18,626
I've been adding 10 more
push-ups every week,

256
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:22,605
and now,
200 push-ups are no problem.

257
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:26,031
Didn't take the college
entrance exam?

258
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:29,003
What did I say?

259
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:33,147
We're not cut out for that shit.

260
00:33:34,786 --> 00:33:37,413
It's already been a year.

261
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:40,983
I miss you.

262
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:50,258
Hi, Min.
This is Romy.

263
00:33:51,836 --> 00:33:55,795
Just because your master's not around,
doesn't mean you're not a slave.

264
00:33:57,942 --> 00:34:00,968
It's very quiet
and comfortable here.

265
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:03,905
Sometimes boring...

266
00:34:04,949 --> 00:34:08,009
But it's okay.

267
00:34:13,123 --> 00:34:16,787
Sometimes,
I really want to see you.

268
00:34:17,994 --> 00:34:19,586
I wrote you a lot of letters.

269
00:34:21,032 --> 00:34:22,556
I've been meaning to send them...
but...

270
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:25,157
I guess I'm lazy.

271
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:30,806
I probably won't send this one.

272
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:36,444
Two years have passed.

273
00:34:37,414 --> 00:34:41,476
As usual,
my life was nothing.

274
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:46,882
- The figures don't add up. Look at this.
- I don't know about it.

275
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,126
Hey, come here.

276
00:34:50,594 --> 00:34:51,391
Why?

277
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:53,356
- Did you take the cash?
- Says who?

278
00:34:53,597 --> 00:34:54,860
Who saw me steal?

279
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:55,961
Who else but you!

280
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:57,599
Books are off after your shift.

281
00:34:57,934 --> 00:35:00,096
Hey, fuck you!
I ain't taking this shit from you

282
00:35:00,304 --> 00:35:01,293
just because you own the place.

283
00:35:01,905 --> 00:35:04,534
Fuck,
I'll quit!

284
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:09,942
What did you say?

285
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:12,706
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. He treated me like a thief.

286
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:14,213
So everything's my fault?

287
00:35:14,418 --> 00:35:18,047
- You lame ass.
- What?

288
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:19,219
Sorry...

289
00:35:19,422 --> 00:35:21,253
Fuck you!
You son of a bitch.

290
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,153
You're in this together,
aren't you?

291
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:24,858
You're both going
to jail tonight.

292
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:27,356
Motherfuckers!
I'll teach you.

293
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:31,356
You didn't steal?

294
00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:33,764
Shit.
Did I ever lie?

295
00:35:34,204 --> 00:35:37,333
I can't fucking believe this.

296
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:38,472
Did you see him steal?

297
00:35:39,643 --> 00:35:41,577
Well, did you fucking
see him steal, huh?

298
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:47,081
You're accusing him
without any proof? Huh?

299
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:49,315
Is this how you treat
your employees?

300
00:35:51,922 --> 00:35:52,947
That's it.

301
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:58,219
Call the police and...
we'll burn the place.

302
00:36:01,965 --> 00:36:03,797
Good day,
motherfucker!

303
00:36:08,972 --> 00:36:10,963
Hey, I'm sick and tired of
looking for work.

304
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:12,402
Let's get some steak.

305
00:36:15,646 --> 00:36:18,307
Okay, I took some dough. You think the
motherfucker's going to pay us pension?

306
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:23,452
- You crazy mother!
- Okay, okay. Take it easy. Chill.

307
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:41,135
Why are you fucking around
with a pager that never beeps?

308
00:36:41,605 --> 00:36:43,072
Trash it.

309
00:36:45,275 --> 00:36:46,402
Did you look for a job?

310
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:53,713
Don't be giving me the eye.

311
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:55,782
My old man sent me
his pension money.

312
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:59,617
It's time I went into business
for myself. Be my own boss.

313
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:02,525
Not everyone can run a business.

314
00:37:03,494 --> 00:37:04,518
You're too young.

315
00:37:07,297 --> 00:37:08,286
21 is not a kid.

316
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,927
My old man says I'm the only one
who can build the family fortune.

317
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:19,806
All my folks did was have kids. I've
got 4 younger brothers and sisters.

318
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:38,351
Take it.
It's about $3,000.

319
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:46,967
You little thief.
How the fuck did you get it?

320
00:37:50,373 --> 00:37:51,534
Hey, Min. Get your ass out
and take a look.

321
00:38:00,351 --> 00:38:01,112
Isn't this cool?

322
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:04,885
Spelling off?

323
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:46,920
It's been a long time.

324
00:38:47,764 --> 00:38:49,289
Yeah, I guess.

325
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:51,659
Taesoo came back.

326
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:56,362
I don't know why but seeing him
made me feel good.

327
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,273
He was my brother.

328
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,577
Look at this place.

329
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,442
I'll open up my own place soon.

330
00:39:10,054 --> 00:39:10,610
You're here,
sir.

331
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:14,650
Go to Madam Shin,
like I told you.

332
00:39:15,192 --> 00:39:16,056
Yes, sir

333
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,351
- Don't want any trouble.
- Sure.

334
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:25,592
Hey, let's get a
drink at Paradise.

335
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:30,963
About fucking time
I went to that club.

336
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,606
- How's business?
- We only let two tables in.

337
00:39:35,813 --> 00:39:37,110
- Madam Shin in?
- Yes!

338
00:39:40,184 --> 00:39:41,673
Hey,
who are you?

339
00:39:43,286 --> 00:39:45,777
Assholes, they're my friends.
Let them in.

340
00:39:47,757 --> 00:39:50,056
Wow, it's cool.
Fucking interior is fly.

341
00:39:50,293 --> 00:39:51,920
Hey,
go on in...

342
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,130
- and I'll join you.
- Okay.

343
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:05,340
He wanted to be a partner
and now he wants me to quit.

344
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:09,306
I'm sick of this
business anyway.

345
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:14,306
Go tell him to give me
my money back, now!

346
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:17,746
You fucked up.

347
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:20,150
So pay for the damages.

348
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:22,782
What?
Are you threatening me?

349
00:40:23,193 --> 00:40:25,253
Your true self comes through.

350
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:27,327
Fuck...

351
00:40:32,302 --> 00:40:33,860
- Hey sis.
- Why, son of a bitch!

352
00:40:34,038 --> 00:40:38,065
I never knocked
off a broad before.

353
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:41,777
Maybe it's time.

354
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,775
Hey, Taesoo!

355
00:40:49,286 --> 00:40:53,552
Where have you been hiding?
I missed you!

356
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,755
Let's not complicate things.

357
00:41:18,782 --> 00:41:21,181
Now,
this one is extremely cute.

358
00:41:21,652 --> 00:41:23,278
You don't stand a chance.

359
00:41:24,554 --> 00:41:28,047
- Hey you, come on out.
- Go, go.

360
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:31,021
Lucky him.

361
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:54,715
- Thanks for the drinks, Taesoo.
- It ain't nothing...

362
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,918
Take your bike.

363
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:01,351
It's yours.

364
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:04,456
I like the ones
with four wheels!

365
00:42:16,072 --> 00:42:17,061
New gig.

366
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:19,039
Come see me.

367
00:42:23,514 --> 00:42:24,673
I've got a lot to do,

368
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:27,009
but...

369
00:42:30,054 --> 00:42:32,385
no one I can trust.

370
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,786
Our place will
be open in 2 days.

371
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:40,425
That's not what you're
cut out for.

372
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:44,460
Why waste your gift?

373
00:42:47,737 --> 00:42:49,432
Is fighting a gift?

374
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:51,572
Maybe.

375
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:55,675
I'll make that gift rot forever.

376
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:01,481
If you become a CEO
or make it on the street;

377
00:43:03,387 --> 00:43:05,411
it don't matter
when you're successful.

378
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:09,759
No,
that's not for me.

379
00:43:11,994 --> 00:43:14,190
I want a simple life and...

380
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,896
don't think I'll make it big.

381
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,231
A long life.

382
00:43:25,242 --> 00:43:30,235
That's my dream,
Taesoo.

383
00:43:35,753 --> 00:43:37,219
A long simple life.
That's my dream, baby.

384
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:41,356
You haven't changed one bit.

385
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:46,925
You, neither!

386
00:43:58,474 --> 00:43:59,065
You!

387
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:05,572
Hey!
Are you crazy?

388
00:44:05,815 --> 00:44:07,612
Kissing me with that fucking
dirty mouth of yours!

389
00:44:11,155 --> 00:44:12,918
- Whan...
- Hey, go away!

390
00:44:13,123 --> 00:44:15,818
Whan. Let's go!

391
00:44:17,661 --> 00:44:18,628
Sorry, Sunny.

392
00:44:21,465 --> 00:44:23,364
We've got some stuff to
buy tomorrow.

393
00:44:23,634 --> 00:44:25,568
Yeah, right...

394
00:44:25,735 --> 00:44:28,398
Next time, you come alone,
okay?

395
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:30,262
Hey, Sunny.

396
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:36,610
Taesoo,
it's good to have you back.

397
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:39,844
Next time,
I'm buying.

398
00:44:41,918 --> 00:44:42,543
Let's go!

399
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,184
- See you.
- Yeah, come see us again.

400
00:44:48,324 --> 00:44:50,657
Our high school days were good.

401
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:52,755
Nothing to worry about.

402
00:44:53,197 --> 00:44:54,561
Would you like to go back?

403
00:44:55,364 --> 00:44:58,960
Fuck you! I still want to kill
that fucking student counselor.

404
00:44:59,836 --> 00:45:00,360
Red pepper.

405
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:13,744
- Hey, what a fucking place!
- Business must be okay.

406
00:45:15,818 --> 00:45:17,251
Yo,
what are you doing?

407
00:45:17,987 --> 00:45:20,114
Asshole!
Don't tell me you don't know.

408
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:23,257
Motherfuckers.
You didn't inform us about shit.

409
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:27,327
Sorry.
We messed up.

410
00:45:28,398 --> 00:45:34,097
Cut the bullshit
Get us some noodles, lame ass.

411
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:35,065
Sure.

412
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:40,639
Cool it.

413
00:45:43,713 --> 00:45:44,702
Please,
I beg you.

414
00:45:51,722 --> 00:45:54,315
There are sleazy motherfuckers
who take monthly protection money.

415
00:45:54,992 --> 00:45:56,253
But we're not like that.

416
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:01,987
Once for the opening is enough.

417
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:06,927
Just bring $3,000 to the
pool tables cross the street.

418
00:46:08,605 --> 00:46:09,469
$3,000?

419
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:14,469
Why?
Should I raise it?

420
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,807
You know what to do.

421
00:46:18,614 --> 00:46:19,512
By Saturday.

422
00:46:32,996 --> 00:46:34,054
You're not gonna pay them,
are you?

423
00:46:36,065 --> 00:46:38,034
I ain't afraid of those fuckers.

424
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:42,099
- Whan.
- My life depends on this place.

425
00:46:42,706 --> 00:46:45,231
Fuck, we pay them.
It's not even monthly.

426
00:46:46,143 --> 00:46:48,634
We pay the cocksuckers and
do our business. Losers.

427
00:46:49,947 --> 00:46:51,106
Fuck...

428
00:47:04,327 --> 00:47:06,818
Romy was there waiting for me.

429
00:47:08,331 --> 00:47:12,166
She was never out of my heart,
not once.

430
00:47:13,536 --> 00:47:16,972
And there she was.

431
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,931
I've been in
Manhattan for 2 years.

432
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:22,637
I lived near the Central Park.

433
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:24,806
Know what I like about New York?

434
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:28,016
No one cares about
other people lives.

435
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:29,708
Nobody cares!

436
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:33,416
No matter what you do,
no one judges you.

437
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:35,585
Only in New York!

438
00:47:36,726 --> 00:47:38,284
Only in New York!

439
00:47:40,597 --> 00:47:42,588
I didn't think you'd
keep the beeper.

440
00:47:46,637 --> 00:47:49,833
I thought it would beep someday.

441
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:57,278
Got a surprise for you.

442
00:48:04,253 --> 00:48:05,686
I recorded this for you.

443
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:09,550
Listen.

444
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:29,505
Are you back for good?

445
00:48:30,746 --> 00:48:33,909
Sh...
This is the best part.

446
00:49:12,456 --> 00:49:15,219
Min! It's me.
Sunny.

447
00:49:17,126 --> 00:49:18,115
What are you doing here?

448
00:49:20,496 --> 00:49:23,159
Wow.
Is this motorcycle yours?

449
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:25,300
It's so cool.

450
00:49:25,936 --> 00:49:28,268
I've always wanted to ride
one of these things.

451
00:49:28,538 --> 00:49:30,061
C'mon, give me a ride.
Please...

452
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:32,670
- Sorry but I'm busy.
- Hey, Sunny.

453
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,440
What are you doing here?
You live around here?

454
00:49:37,246 --> 00:49:40,114
Bye, Min!
Come see me next time.

455
00:49:40,483 --> 00:49:41,041
Sure thing.

456
00:49:42,885 --> 00:49:43,750
Sunny, wait.

457
00:49:45,088 --> 00:49:46,987
Let me go.
I'm busy.

458
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:51,389
- Sunny. When is your day off?
- Why? I've got no day off!

459
00:49:51,628 --> 00:49:54,096
- No, wait!
- What do you want?

460
00:49:54,697 --> 00:49:57,360
- Don't be angry.
- Why are you doing this?

461
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:05,530
I didn't see Taesoo much.

462
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:08,902
All we did was talk
over the phone.

463
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:12,704
Every time he asked me
to work with him,

464
00:50:13,115 --> 00:50:14,514
I turned him down.

465
00:50:16,786 --> 00:50:17,514
Something wasn't right.

466
00:50:18,487 --> 00:50:20,148
That confidence in
Taesoo's voice...

467
00:50:22,259 --> 00:50:24,250
But I wanted to believe that
he was doing fine.

468
00:50:25,695 --> 00:50:27,925
There aren't good jobs
or bad jobs.

469
00:50:28,798 --> 00:50:32,132
There are just jobs you do.

470
00:50:49,552 --> 00:50:51,646
There are different parts
to a human body.

471
00:50:52,389 --> 00:50:54,914
It takes different lengths of time for
different parts to be severed.

472
00:50:58,195 --> 00:50:59,092
Sign over the right
of night club.

473
00:51:06,068 --> 00:51:07,661
You've got some balls,
you dick!
