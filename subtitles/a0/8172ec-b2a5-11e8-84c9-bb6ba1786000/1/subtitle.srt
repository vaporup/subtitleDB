1248
01:01:08,855 --> 01:01:11,361
WHATEVER MAN TOUCHES HER

1259
01:01:41,191 --> 01:01:42,696
12:30, ISN'T IT?
KIND OF LATE.

1260
01:01:42,696 --> 01:01:46,200
I WAS DREAMING I WAS BACK
IN FRANCE ON FURLOUGH.

1261
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,203

1265
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:56,217
WELL, IF IT
WAS AN AMBULANCE,

1266
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:57,719
YOU GOT A CHANCE.

1267
01:01:57,719 --> 01:01:58,721
IF IT'S IN A HEARSE,
GOT TO BE WORSE.

1268
01:02:01,225 --> 01:02:04,229
OK. WELL, THIS
IS A UNION CARD, HUH?

1269
01:02:04,229 --> 01:02:05,733

01:02:18,253 --> 01:02:19,755
YES, SIR. I DID.

1279
01:02:19,755 --> 01:02:21,257

01:04:01,887 --> 01:04:02,888
OK.

1322
01:04:02,888 --> 01:04:05,892

SUSPEND ALL SENTENCES.
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,192
HEY. HOLD THE HARVEST.

1392
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,695
THERE IS ANOTHER MATTER

1393
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,197
BEFORE THE SHIRE COURT
THIS EVENING.

1394
01:07:13,699 --> 01:07:14,700

1395
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,704
WELL, YOUSE ALL

01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,583
OH, SHE WENT HOME.

1398
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,585
I GOT SOMETHING
BETTER FOR YOU.

1399
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:28,588
FIRST YOU OUGHTA
KNOW SOMETHING.

1400
01:07:29,089 --> 01:07:30,092
IN MANY CASES HERE,

1401
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:31,094
I DO OFTEN CHOOSE

1402
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:33,096
TO INVEIGH
THE MAXIMUM LEVY.

1403
01:07:33,096 --> 01:07:36,102
FREQUENTLY, UNDESIRABLES
ARE PUT TO DEATH.

1404
01:07:36,102 --> 01:07:37,603
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

1405
01:07:37,603 --> 01:07:40,107
COME ON. BUT DEATH
FOR RUNNING A STOP SIGN?

1406
01:07:40,107 --> 01:07:42,112
AND FOR BEING
A BANKER.

1407
01:07:42,112 --> 01:07:43,613
THAT'S
THE DOUBLE DEATH.

1408
01:07:43,613 --> 01:07:45,116
HOWEVER,

1409
01:07:45,116 --> 01:07:46,117
I'D BE WILLING

1410
01:07:46,117 --> 01:07:48,621

ALL FINDINGS,

1411
01:07:48,621 --> 01:07:50,623
BE BLIND TO
YOUR BANKER'S BLOOD,

1412
01:07:50,623 --> 01:07:53,630
LET YOU LIVE OUT
YOUR DAYS HERE

1413
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:55,632
AS HUSBAND
TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER,

1414
01:07:55,632 --> 01:07:57,135
FATHER TO HER CHILD,

1415
01:07:57,135 --> 01:07:59,639
AND HEIR TO MY SEAT.

1416
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:04,148
WHA-WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING?

1417
01:08:05,149 --> 01:08:06,650
IT'S DEATH OR ELDONA?

1418
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,153
OH, COME ON, LAD.

1419
01:08:08,153 --> 01:08:09,655
TAKE HER HAND.

1420
01:08:09,655 --> 01:08:11,658
WARM MY TIRED
OLD HEART.
