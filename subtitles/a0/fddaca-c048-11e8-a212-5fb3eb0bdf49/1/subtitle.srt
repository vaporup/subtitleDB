1
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,567
Keep away!

2
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,069
Keep away...!

3
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,271
Letting loose a dog to bite so early!

4
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,211
Keep away...

5
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:26,547
Master Pin

6
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,276
How's it, Master Pin!

7
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:28,716
You look swell walking the dog

8
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,549
Sure! I bought it from the USA

9
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:36,587
Keep away!

10
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:38,360
Keep away!

11
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,516
Bloody dog!

12
00:01:59,352 --> 00:01:59,818
Go to hell!

13
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,684
Tsai!

14
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,618
Pin, what now?

15
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,189
Go and chase it!

16
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,053
What's it?

17
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,460
Are you alright?

18
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:12,557
Yes

19
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,622
I'm not alright!

20
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,166
What is it, Master Pin?

21
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,963
You scared away my dog!

22
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,705
At worst I'll make good to you the loss

23
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:20,669
Make good?

24
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:22,667
Master Pin, we couldn't catch it

25
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:23,467
Right, Master Pin!

26
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,166
You couldn't catch it?

27
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,134
Make way! Out of the way!

28
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,105
I'm a marine officer's son,
I won't bully you

29
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,915
Magistrate Hu, please come here!

30
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,010
What's it, Master Pin?

31
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,645
Let Magistrate Hu arbitrate...

32
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,311
to reconcile you

33
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:37,317
I'm reconciled now!

34
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,513
Good! Why not come to my home to

35
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,885
pick your favorite dog?

36
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,492
I've got over a dozen

37
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,458
What? My dad bought Tsai...

38
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,722
for 100 taels from the USA and

39
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:45,922
it's the only one...

40
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:46,961
in Canton

41
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:51,126
Cost 100 taels plus 2 years' feeding...

42
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,232
200 taels

43
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,337
The minimum compensation is 200 taels

44
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,630
200 taels?

45
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,601
My whole family...

46
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,870
can't spend it all in 10 years!

47
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,081
Magistrate Hu,
our Tsai eats beef every meal

48
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,678
He must pay a penalty of 300 taels!

49
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:06,351
300 taels!

50
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,110
No!

51
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,016
Too little...

52
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:11,885
Just imagine

53
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,082
It's not simple...

54
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,056
to import a dog

55
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,354
from the United States

56
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,825
The expenses are innumerous!

57
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,158
You must pay at least 500 taels!

58
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,191
Secretary Sung's right, 500 taels!

59
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,564
Fu!

60
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:34,741
Don't!

61
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,114
Fu! Fu!

62
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,215
How are your buttocks?

63
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,251
It bleeds and hurts with toothmarks

64
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,182
You've beaten away my Fu!

65
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,256
He bit my buttocks!

66
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,721
You asked for 500 taels
after your dog bit

67
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,328
Now our Fu bit your buttocks

68
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,427
Our Tsai is a dog!

69
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:52,765
You asked for 500 for beating away a dog

70
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,365
The penalty for beating away
a man should be at least 1000

71
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,523
Tsai is a dog king bought from the USA

72
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,668
My Fu is "dregs king" bought from France

73
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,134
He's the only one in town

74
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,067
I've supported him for 20 years

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,798
It's reasonable to ask for 1000 taels

76
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:02,965
Your Honor,

77
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,168
what do you think?

78
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:04,910
The way you figure it...

79
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:05,635
You're right!

80
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,441
Your Honor is sagacious!

81
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,614
King Dregs of France!

82
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:14,919
Now your Fu's back!

83
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,655
That's why I'm asking
for 1000 taels only

84
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,118
If he never returns,

85
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,022
10,000 taels is not enough!

86
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:22,953
You're OK

87
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,528
You frame me

88
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,076
What's wrong?

89
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,460
Trying to kill! Damn it!

90
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,359
Something exciting!

91
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,366
Someone got into the ox manure pit!

92
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:03,992
Let me make the introduction

93
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:04,636
This is Master Pin!

94
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,771
How do you do, Master Pin?

95
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:06,494
My wife

96
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,101
Madam

97
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,640
Master Pin's courteous

98
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,374
Master Pin, it's alright for my wife...

99
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:12,738
to have saved your life

100
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:13,810
It's alright!

101
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,009
We must visit the grave

102
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:15,646
Yes!

103
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,745
Your Honor, you know the case?

104
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,382
Yes

105
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,017
Please

106
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,243
Go away!

107
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:23,911
Pay him 1000 taels

108
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,491
Right, Master Pin

109
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,022
If your dog returns...

110
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,753
like Fu did,

111
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,295
repay him several hundred taels

112
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,532
O. K...

113
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,980
Be nice, Chieh, kowtow to your brother

114
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,823
We've lost a dozen sons altogether

115
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,352
Don't say it!

116
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,060
You make me sad

117
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,289
It was all your fault!

118
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,496
You've chosen to be a shyster

119
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,461
You stick at nothing for money!

120
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,101
You're too unethical

121
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,970
You knew it yourself

122
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,832
You cried your heart out after each case

123
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,206
It's fair to help others
after getting paid for it

124
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,368
When did I cry?

125
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,171
You didn't?

126
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:21,937
No

127
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,514
Darling, seal your brush!

128
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,487
If I do, no more gold bracelets, chains,

129
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,853
jade rings, gems, earrings for you

130
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:35,918
Look,

131
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,120
they're too heavy to carry

132
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,958
I don't care, I'd rather forsake them...

133
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,057
Maybe...

134
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,497
I won't ask for so much!

135
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,368
I only want my child safe and sound

136
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,776
Will you do me a favor?

137
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,536
One must adapt to circumstances

138
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,437
It's easier said than done

139
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,640
Switch to business, darling

140
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,544
Tom made a fortune last year-end

141
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,279
but Dick hung himself to death

142
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,748
You two, stop quarreling!

143
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,721
Mind I hit you!

144
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,353
Be nice and sleep

145
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,227
That master inside has been waiting

146
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,266
Who are you, please?

147
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,094
Ta Pao-ho!

148
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:16,994
Yes!

149
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,132
What a memory you have!

150
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,733
Nonsense! You've hired so many men here

151
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:20,895
How can I remember them all?

152
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,615
Oh, how big!

153
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,684
Our master is Chen Chiang-fu

154
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,690
He's the owner
of the largest exchange shop in Canton

155
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,028
He wants you to write a memorial for him

156
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,959
Here's the deposit

157
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,762
Once you fix it,

158
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,403
the sky can be the limit

159
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,093
Fu

160
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:52,862
Yes!

161
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,170
Do you agree or not?

162
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,285
What do you mean by that?

163
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:06,952
That's right

164
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,711
Good, a stick facing a stick

165
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,054
That's not the way to talk to me

166
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:12,819
Of course

167
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,223
How could a man talk to a stick?

168
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:22,127
Mr Sung is indeed out of the ordinary

169
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,565
You're unreservedly
a No. 1 counsel in town

170
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,395
Am I okay?

171
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,499
Fit as a fiddle

172
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,803
What can I do for you please?

173
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:30,872
The fact of the case is

174
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,274
My son's been learning kung fu

175
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,971
He had a fight yesterday

176
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,048
His opponent is opium
owner Chang Piao's son

177
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,215
He's fragile after two light blows only

178
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,719
he got knocked down

179
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,253
And he died this morning

180
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,153
I know Chang Piao has reported it
to the magistracy

181
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,462
Please try...

182
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,688
to get him off the hook

183
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,155
My husband has decided to seal his brush

184
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:56,360
Here is...

185
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,261
Sorry

186
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,400
Just have a look!

187
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,576
Retired?

188
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:06,234
I'll reconsider the retirement

189
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,140
Darling

190
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,209
See him out

191
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,980
This case of gold...

192
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,121
Sorry, please

193
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,570
It's all yours if you win

194
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,271
No!

195
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,192
Whose son was killed...

196
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,351
by whose son?

197
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:57,854
Your Honor!

198
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,098
My son was killed by his son

199
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,602
So you're the plaintiff

200
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,997
Your Honor! In fact, we're plaintiffs

201
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,467
Our memorial was here

202
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,605
before dawn

203
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,605
At that time

204
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,539
His son didn't die yet

205
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,804
What's your charge against him?

206
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,412
Chang Piao's son Chang Hsiao Szu

207
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,016
broke the nail of the small finger

208
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,050
of the left hand of Chen Chiang-fu's son

209
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,710
Chen Ta-wen

210
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,355
He's seriously hurt!

211
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,785
But my son's dead!

212
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,285
Right, his son's dead!

213
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,190
Your Honor,

214
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,428
everybody dies!

215
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:33,489
Right

216
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,959
He seriously wounded and

217
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,796
killed my son

218
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,164
Why didn't you say your son was no good?

219
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,100
I just rushed over to give him 2 punches

220
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,769
Several, punches?

221
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,672
Two punches! I got over to...

222
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,376
So hard?

223
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,677
You...

224
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,523
Should be so hard!

225
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:02,656
Secretary Sung...

226
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,726
You're not smart enough

227
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:04,588
May I ask

228
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,092
when was your son hit by his son?

229
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,056
Yesterday afternoon

230
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:07,699
When did he die?

231
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,697
This afternoon

232
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,096
What does it concern him then?

233
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,734
Just now I punched him more than twice

234
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:13,870
Your Honor,

235
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,802
can he sue me for murder

236
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,204
if he should die in 8-10 years?

237
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,836
No, no

238
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,607
Your Honor's brilliant! Long long live!

239
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,187
My son was well and

240
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,150
and he caused his death

241
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,394
Secretary Sung, do me a favor!

242
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,128
Your son died because he was short-lived

243
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,122
He didn't look short-lived!

244
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,766
May I ask what's the span of my life!

245
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,559
I can't tell

246
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:46,835
Since you can't,

247
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,031
how could you tell that
your son was not short-lived?

248
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,039
Let's come to the point
Any result, Your Honor?

249
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:52,836
Yes!

250
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,537
Would you give me some hint?

251
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,173
Yes!

252
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,815
Plaintiff Chen Ta-wen was wounded

253
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,215
but the defendant died, cause unknown

254
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,082
He should've asked
for a penalty of 50 taels

255
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,823
We won't pursue any more!

256
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,348
You're smart!

257
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,221
Your Honor, any result?

258
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,185
Yes!

259
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,193
Give the verdict now!

260
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:13,428
Okay!

261
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,625
Chang Piao allowed
his son to commit crime

262
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,494
No prosecution,
considering it a first offence

263
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,264
Tell your son not to commit again!

264
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,465
Well...

265
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,500
Is this right?

266
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,206
His son won't commit again

267
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:36,377
Chieh!

268
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:37,378
Darling

269
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,360
Darling,
take the son to the rocking horse

270
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,586
I've newly bought

271
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:50,625
Chieh!

272
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,705
He got a crash and dropped into the well

273
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,315
He couldn't pass one year

274
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,192
It's tit for tat

275
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,252
It really is tit for tat

276
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,003
The brush-sealing ceremony begins!

277
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,541
Is today really a good day, sir?

278
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,841
Today's the best day in a year

279
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,283
Look at the calendar

280
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,324
It says offerings are unsuitable

281
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,617
except for the wei hour

282
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,291
It faces your horoscope and is best

283
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,129
You mustn't go too far

284
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,825
Hurry up!
After the hour it would be trouble!

285
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,005
Convulsion, take me home quick!

286
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:11,774
Are you alright?

287
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,249
Hurry up!

288
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,652
What's wrong, darling?

289
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,149
Put...

290
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,718
Better now?

291
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:21,921
Let me see

292
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,056
What a miracle!

293
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,621
It gets well suddenly!

294
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:25,953
Yes! Go over then!

295
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:26,597
Good!

296
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:28,499
Come

297
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:29,395
Come...!

298
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,100
You first

299
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:30,792
You first!

300
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,164
You please. Help yourself

301
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,565
Well...

302
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:34,563
Okay! Let me

303
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,274
Fu

304
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,817
Don't tarry, go now!

305
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:53,986
Go up!

306
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,956
Go up!

307
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,370
Go up, not yet there!

308
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,145
I've brought something horrible
to help you

309
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,225
What's so horrible with a frog?

310
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,406
Keep away! Let me

311
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,042
OK now

312
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,003
How could you...

313
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,005
How could you've sawed the highest part?

314
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,477
To make it look real!

315
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,884
It's broken! What now?

316
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,076
Buy a new one

317
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,216
A new one?

318
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,913
An order for such a long ladder...

319
00:15:59,091 --> 00:15:59,921
takes 9 days

320
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,590
It can only be arranged in 2 days then

321
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,053
There's no other way out

322
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:05,559
Go home, buy food and cook

323
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,732
Don't you want to get cursed?

324
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,467
No, but I must wait some time

325
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,364
I'll kill you!

326
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,047
Just the right hour!

327
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,956
Go now

328
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:37,252
Darling!

329
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,054
What's it again?

330
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,061
To show your will,

331
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,256
swear that

332
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,901
if you go against it

333
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,093
the child I'm now bearing

334
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,396
will come out without a chick

335
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:47,834
Are you pregnant again?

336
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:48,896
Are you sure?

337
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:49,972
Don't touch me!

338
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,134
What?

339
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:52,933
A mammy...

340
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,443
cursing her own child

341
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,205
Has she to be so wicked?

342
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,349
No

343
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:58,546
Yes! Yes!

344
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:01,978
OK, you win!

345
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,178
If I should write memorials again,

346
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:05,623
may your child come out without a chick

347
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:06,683
A child!

348
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,224
A child without chick, okay?

349
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,387
Why didn't you say so?

350
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:11,930
So just one touch and you got pregnant?

351
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,093
You're evil!

352
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,707
Congratulations...!

353
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,339
Thank you...!

354
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,537
I must sue Chang Piao's son Hsiao Szu

355
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,472
for breaking the nail
of the small finger

356
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,079
of Chen Chiang-fu's son Ta-wen

357
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,781
Badly hurt!

358
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,012
Your Honor, my son's dead!

359
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,184
Yes, his son is dead!

360
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,283
Everybody dies, Your Honor!

361
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,431
Still thinking of the lawsuit?
You're incorrigible!

362
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,076
I really don't understand you women

363
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,104
What do you mean...

364
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,077
by having stripes planted on your head?

365
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,340
That's a bun

366
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,614
Like sea-slugs, how silly?

367
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,745
Are they beautiful?

368
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,521
You call that beautiful?

369
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,817
Does it look okay now?

370
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,594
Damn ugly

371
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,326
You're right

372
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,589
Better...

373
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,400
This way!

374
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,401
What does this look like?

375
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,103
Don't like it? Change it...

376
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:03,670
Don't move!

377
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,176
What're you doing from behind?

378
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,800
Don't you like this?

379
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,307
Where?

380
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,777
Over here!

381
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,382
You creep!

382
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,414
Even now I'm still taller than you!

383
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:15,711
Did you ever study?

384
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,320
For two days

385
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,183
Can't you be a bit euphemistic?

386
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,185
That's hypocrisy!

387
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:19,651
You?

388
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,055
What a busybody!

389
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,598
Am I busy?

390
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:36,999
It's so boring!

391
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,040
This is it

392
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,438
I'm middle-aged now

393
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,909
People will laugh
if I stay idle all day long

394
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,006
Even my brush is sealed! What a pity!

395
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,742
You're now a boss!

396
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,244
Isn't it nice for you to move around?

397
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,752
I've moved around a lot

398
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:50,752
Stand here!

399
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:51,814
Stand!

400
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,846
Don't try to act busy!

401
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,139
I know you're free

402
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,608
Get the writing equipment for me

403
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:26,883
Fu, are you writing?

404
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,258
Keep away!

405
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,071
That's no way to write!

406
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,338
Let me show you

407
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,575
Cursed with a son with no chick

408
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,915
Shui, let me use it

409
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,490
Pass the bucket of water!

410
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,022
Put it over here!

411
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,604
The one writing is Sung Shih-chieh

412
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,533
You each...

413
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,899
take off one rib from him

414
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,404
Don't worry

415
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,003
That's the way to do it!

416
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,909
No way, it can't be hung

417
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,247
I've to rewrite it

418
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,881
I give you a chance to learn

419
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,547
Let me demonstrate to you once again

420
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,118
Why have you moistened my head?

421
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,663
Why have you torn off my dress?

422
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,295
When did I tear off your dress?

423
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,728
Don't deny!

424
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:46,893
It's now even!

425
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,031
What now?

426
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,333
Hit him

427
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,693
What's so funny?

428
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,299
What's wrong, Fu?

429
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,332
Master got beaten!

430
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,034
Help!

431
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,310
Are you alright?

432
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,517
Let go...! How ugly!

433
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,864
I kill you

434
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,161
Let me hit you once

435
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:51,934
Again?

436
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,429
Help!

437
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,470
What a shame being in a girl's arms!

438
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,134
He would've fallen to death!

439
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,540
Sonny, your sister's fantastic!

440
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,117
Get dressed now

441
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:41,448
Luckily, not many are around

442
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,170
It's hard but ventilated, not bad

443
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,272
Believe me

444
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,473
Good...

445
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,337
Make a pair like before then

446
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:10,644
Excellent! The sole's a bit hard

447
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,211
Put a cushion

448
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:13,075
Put a cushion?

449
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,086
What do you think of this?

450
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,617
Not bad

451
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,586
Excellent...

452
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:20,986
Make it like that

453
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,260
This cushion may get flat after long use

454
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,655
Use a wooden one, okay?

455
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,961
That's too hard

456
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:29,826
Never mind

457
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:31,062
Too heavy

458
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:31,793
Don't worry,

459
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,938
put 2 cushions above it

460
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,595
2 cushions above the wood?

461
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,134
Wait

462
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,243
Okay, I can manage!

463
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,845
2 layers of leather under the sole

464
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,174
make it more durable!

465
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,778
How about this?

466
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,316
At least 5-6 inches taller in them!

467
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,110
Right...

468
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,387
Well...

469
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,089
Why not this?

470
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,782
Take this

471
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:57,992
You're in the mood today

472
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,994
Have a good time

473
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:01,858
Okay?

474
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,102
Why not this way then?

475
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:07,833
Excuse me!

476
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,784
What's wrong with you now?

477
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,049
Are you scared?

478
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,759
You know the pain
of not being tall enough?

479
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,496
Darling

480
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,959
Being tall doesn't count

481
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:39,997
It's a tall ambition that counts

482
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,733
Do you know

483
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,501
you rate high to me?

484
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:48,741
Darling

485
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,384
I...

486
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,911
Say it!

487
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,220
In my eyes...

488
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,919
you're the biggest

489
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:02,952
Please excuse me!

490
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:26,651
Please have tea!

491
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:28,978
Thank you

492
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,251
It's true, madam

493
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,289
Fu often pawed over me

494
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,322
I'm serious

495
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,255
What a gossiper!

496
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,153
It's true!

497
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,661
Creep, what a waste!

498
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:43,262
I feel great!

499
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,834
Madam, he's smart,

500
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:45,935
tea can remove odor

501
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:46,729
Shut up!

502
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:52,601
What a lousy man...

503
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,267
for such a beauty

504
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,244
Your husband died a mysterious death

505
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,606
Your brother-in-law may suspect you

506
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,181
if you go away now

507
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,813
What a wicked woman murdering
her own husband!

508
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,154
My husband was murdered
by my brother-in-law

509
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,988
An internecine war!

510
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,559
Your sister-in-law's brother
is Chief Secretary, Shansi

511
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:11,554
Right!

512
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:12,525
Will she sue you?

513
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,562
No,

514
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:15,825
she's guilty herself

515
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,196
What she said makes sense

516
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:22,138
You're pregnant, you may get cheated

517
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,104
exposing yourself

518
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,975
I won't be pregnant any more

519
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,205
I didn't mean you

520
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,342
I'm her brother

521
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,672
Brother, what about the money I gave you

522
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,476
I want to have a bet...

523
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,415
Have you lost everything?

524
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,445
Shut up!

525
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,388
What am I to do now?

526
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,795
Don't worry...!
The one in front is my fellow clansman

527
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,556
Let me borrow some money from him

528
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:49,927
to meet the emergency

529
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,800
Wait for me here,
I'll be back right away

530
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,167
Yang Ching, what a coincidence

531
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,598
I'm out for buying
It's been a long time

532
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:58,901
Yes, how's your wife?

533
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,412
She died two years ago

534
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,044
What about your two sons then?

535
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,340
An elderly maid's taking care of them

536
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,179
Your brother must've fooled

537
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,342
that upright man

538
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,814
Yes, I'm sure he has

539
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,915
Your pregnant niece wants to get married

540
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,022
Yes, she's desperate

541
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,253
because her husband's dead

542
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,961
If you marry her,

543
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,292
she'll serve you well

544
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,991
and your two sons

545
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,831
A fair lady is the most ideal

546
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,938
She's a fair lady

547
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,232
Your niece? Of the same family name?

548
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,576
No, I won't give you one

549
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,679
with the same family name as yours
Is that right?

550
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,907
They're staring at us

551
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,012
Why's he staring at me?

552
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,720
Why's he staring at me?

553
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,357
I'm sure he's staring at me

554
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,061
Don't you feel ashamed?

555
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,624
Chen, come here

556
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,894
Clear up everything!

557
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,270
Would your niece regret...

558
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,573
50 taels only?

559
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,675
No...

560
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,742
Chen, this is Mr Yang

561
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,709
Excuse me

562
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,908
I need the manure pit

563
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:16,750
Yang...

564
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,861
Miss Chou, is your Uncle alright?

565
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,629
He's my 2nd brother, not Uncle

566
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,501
He took 50 taels from me
to arrange for your marriage

567
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,100
Then he sold you
after your husband got killed

568
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,538
Damn him

569
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:41,741
I'll try to get him back

570
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,251
Master,
it's town after this mountain top

571
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,055
See if you can get away!

572
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:55,715
Go down and have a look!

573
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:56,383
Yes!

574
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:01,429
Keep away!

575
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,930
Kid, how could you have done that?

576
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,524
You're a beast!

577
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,360
Keep away!

578
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:06,893
At worst I'll refund you the money

579
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,270
Get hold of my hand!

580
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,773
Yang, I'm sorry

581
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,449
Take care of my sister!

582
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,788
Yang

583
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,191
Yang

584
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,162
Go up first!

585
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,074
Master, one of them fell to death

586
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,642
You witnessed it, sir

587
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,913
Please testify at the nearby magistracy

588
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,614
He's too busy to testify

589
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,543
You...

590
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,215
Keep this fan from me

591
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,824
If someone accuses you at the Magistracy

592
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,615
show it to him, and he'll understand

593
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:05,528
Sir...

594
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,329
Why are they still not back?

595
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:19,165
It seems he couldn't keep up
with your brother

596
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,274
and wouldn't return...

597
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,106
to embarrass you

598
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,680
So he left without saying goodbye

599
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:35,021
I really am miserable
How am I going to live?

600
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,991
Don't cry!

601
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,957
Why not put up at my home?

602
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,026
Your brother will return
after getting away

603
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:41,927
Go...!

604
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,093
Go!

605
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:48,765
Have you broken away
from that pregnant woman?

606
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,597
Nonsense!

607
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,339
Next time don't talk so much nonsense!

608
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,672
Go now!

609
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,606
Madam's cruel

610
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,941
She hurts my vital part

611
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:00,743
Take care

612
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,151
It hurts!

613
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,451
This woman's husband was killed by...

614
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,148
this woman's husband's brother

615
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,691
and his wife

616
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,418
This woman's husband's brother
and his wife

617
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,824
then framed this woman...

618
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:13,986
for the murder

619
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,860
of this woman's husband

620
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:16,825
Luckily...

621
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,491
this woman's maid told her of it

622
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,534
This woman then rushed...

623
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:20,830
to see her brother at night

624
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,438
This woman's brother,

625
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,164
an addicted gambler,

626
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,205
gambled away all her money

627
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:24,932
and sold her to his fellow clansman

628
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,509
as his wife

629
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,772
Then this woman's brother ran away
from her

630
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:30,937
So this woman came back...

631
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,138
with me

632
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,979
Fantastic...

633
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,622
Talk faster and I say you're fantastic

634
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,950
She has a heartrending background

635
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,683
There're too many others...

636
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,690
like her

637
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:44,850
And she's pregnant!

638
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,994
There're many other pregnant women too

639
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,065
Let her stay till her brother comes
to pick her up

640
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,995
Master...

641
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:52,894
Madam...

642
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,129
That woman's brother...

643
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,795
won't return to take her away!

644
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:56,664
Why?

645
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,772
He fell to death down a cliff

646
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:07,881
Her brother is now dead too

647
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:11,078
She's pregnant with no kin

648
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,449
You can't take care of her...

649
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,022
all your life

650
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,817
Let her give delivery first

651
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,152
Master, madam...

652
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,659
That woman's given birth

653
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:19,488
So soon?

654
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:20,388
The arrival of a child...

655
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,465
will be a burden

656
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,100
She can't work and
is hard to find a husband

657
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,394
She's finished!

658
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:26,227
Master, madam

659
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:26,961
What's up again?

660
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,537
That woman is hanging herself

661
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:29,639
Hanging herself!

662
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,469
It's the more horrible. She should...

663
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,114
She is hanging herself!

664
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,287
Finished!

665
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,226
Don't!

666
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,026
Look, she's hanging herself!

667
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,324
Do something!

668
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,303
After what she's suffered...

669
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,904
she has no other recourse!

670
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:03,937
Have you no feelings?

671
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:06,937
Have you any feelings?

672
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,240
I'm asking you!

673
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,744
Are you tired after holding her so long?

674
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,071
Logically...

675
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:12,978
should be

676
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,015
Let her go then!

677
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,116
Okay. Why are you shouting?

678
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:22,556
Mrs Sung, let me die!

679
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,419
You still want to die?

680
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,360
You're resourceful. Do something for her

681
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,533
Didn't you make it clearly?

682
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,496
She's finished

683
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,865
Mrs Sung, I put my son in your custody

684
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,641
Take him as your own

685
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,672
I was the mother of a dozen sons

686
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,338
I know how you feel

687
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,874
I'll be a mother to your child

688
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,282
How did you get into this trouble?

689
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,553
Death is the only way out for me now

690
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,715
Death? I'll bring you back to life

691
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:56,952
Don't talk big!

692
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:57,525
Who on earth...

693
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,856
can bring a life back?

694
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,197
Halt!

695
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,837
Close the door!

696
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,506
What are you doing?

697
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:10,572
Violence!

698
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:40,736
Come on!

699
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,668
Hit me in my parents' presence
if you dare

700
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,674
Come down and see if I'll beat you

701
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:45,705
Be smart and don't come down!

702
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,403
You're a no-good scholar

703
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,109
You told me to seal my brush!

704
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,975
Now you want me
to write a memorial again

705
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,543
I vowed to Heaven under curse

706
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,610
This time it's for justice

707
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,981
God will forgive you!

708
00:35:58,623 --> 00:35:59,715
What if he doesn't?

709
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,384
Would you make good the "chicks" to me?

710
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:02,348
Don't turn me down any more!

711
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,188
If you stand by, you're not a man!

712
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,490
Say that again and I'll slap you

713
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,359
You're not a man

714
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:10,991
I forgive you only
because you're pregnant

715
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,594
Say that again if you dare!

716
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,634
You're not a man...

717
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:15,395
Okay!

718
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,440
I'm a female! Outrageous!

719
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,239
Don't come to my room to sleep tonight!

720
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,815
I'll sleep with you tonight, mom, dad!

721
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,933
Master

722
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,885
Why laugh? Are you mad?

723
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,448
Rinse, master

724
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,321
Crazy!

725
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,194
Who's this perfect fright?

726
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,018
It's you!

727
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,151
Me?

728
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,366
Oh, God,

729
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,661
who brought me this?

730
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,928
Madam!

731
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,799
She said you're mean and cowardly

732
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,567
It's better to be female than man

733
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,036
But when you're posed as a female...

734
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,872
You look more beautiful than madam

735
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,572
Keep your mouth shit!

736
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:31,806
Where's madam?

737
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,648
She went to the magistracy early
in the morning

738
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,014
because you refused to defend
for Miss Yang

739
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,612
Who does she think she is?

740
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,649
Master

741
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:42,815
Change! I know

742
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,292
The wet nurse wants rock candy
to decoct papayas

743
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,229
Go and do it then. Why bother me?

744
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,456
You must return them to me

745
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,163
Madam put the papayas with you

746
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:52,793
Give it to me!

747
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,330
Give it to me!

748
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,667
Give it to me!

749
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,235
No, I don't owe you anything!

750
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:58,864
Don't go away!

751
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:09,848
You watch me go in

752
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,286
I watch you go in

753
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:17,727
Secretary

754
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,194
What a relief!

755
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,065
What does the memorial say?

756
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,304
Your Honor, many XX and OO

757
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:32,674
Read to me as much as possible

758
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:34,902
I, Mrs Sung and Yang Hsiu-chen...

759
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,512
XX Your Honor

760
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,046
Yang Hsiu-chen OO was XX

761
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,204
What?

762
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:42,845
Mrs Sung, what does OO mean?

763
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,252
Her husband!

764
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,115
Go on!

765
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,985
Yang Hsiu-chen OO was XX

766
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,561
Yang Hsiu-chen is seeking XX

767
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:53,422
Hold it!

768
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,265
Seeking what?

769
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,565
Seeking redress, Your Honor!

770
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,359
I forgot how to write that

771
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:02,338
What do you want?

772
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:02,995
I'm looking for my wife!

773
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,865
Return home to find her

774
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,310
Brazen!

775
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:07,766
I Counsellor Sung Shih-chieh

776
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:09,037
used to move around here freely

777
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,145
Who dares to stand in my way?

778
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,444
You had a memorial then

779
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,844
What've you got now?

780
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,349
Please be considerate, brothers

781
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:19,646
I'll buy you snacks

782
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,123
Outsiders are not admitted

783
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,161
under the new rules
of the new magistrate

784
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,231
Wait here, if you prefer

785
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,040
Finally, XX Your Honor
and your family's OO

786
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,175
Outrageous...

787
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,739
Unintelligible...

788
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,643
Mrs Sung, can any of your family write?

789
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,041
Why not? Within a perimeter of 500 li

790
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,618
who doesn't know my husband

791
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,620
the famous counselor Sung Shih-chieh?

792
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,526
No wonder you're so cocky

793
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,658
So you're Sung Shih-chieh's wife!

794
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,592
Precisely!

795
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,161
Good!

796
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,796
Come on, serve her with Torture A!

797
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:05,765
Yes!

798
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,037
What is Torture A?

799
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,173
It means 30 slaps on your face!

800
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,064
Hold it!

801
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,101
I'm here to prosecute. Why slap me?

802
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,901
Your husband Sung Shih-chieh talks
black into white

803
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,546
You're his wife, a termagant

804
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:17,840
30 slaps only...

805
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,039
are a favor to your husband!

806
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:19,841
Execute!

807
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,912
Terrible!

808
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,245
Go out... Wait outside if you prefer

809
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,314
What do you want?

810
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:33,886
Move, and it will be all over your face!

811
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:43,764
Halt!

812
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,548
Do I look like...

813
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,687
Yes!

814
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,222
Like Monk Chi

815
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,659
Cry your heart out

816
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,802
Let me be cursed with sterility or

817
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:15,600
anything worse,

818
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,270
I must take the revenge

819
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,567
Revenge!

820
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:24,845
That won't work!

821
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:25,845
Absolutely not

822
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,983
Absolutely impossible!

823
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:27,708
It won't work!

824
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:29,908
Make an exception!

825
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:31,578
You made a vow!

826
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,748
I often make vows

827
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,989
Right, I made the vow
What has it to do with you?

828
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,022
But now you're moving the scrolls

829
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:39,890
written by Emp. Chien Lung

830
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,258
That's absolutely intolerable

831
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,989
The scrolls affect

832
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,101
the feng shui of our clan

833
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:45,701
Yes!

834
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,802
It's been peaceful

835
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,268
since it was hung nearly a century ago

836
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,269
Right!

837
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,001
It was moved when it was hung

838
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,199
and any effect would've been felt

839
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,610
Anyway, you must absolutely not

840
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:55,767
move this feng shui scroll

841
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,138
Right, right!

842
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,343
Don't...

843
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,039
Darling!

844
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:01,479
Shut up!

845
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,683
Darling, you go up!

846
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,179
You sealed it, you must get it yourself!

847
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,321
Come down...

848
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:11,051
Fu!

849
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:12,820
Come down quick!

850
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,031
Take care of me!

851
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:45,392
Go get it quick!

852
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,321
It's got!

853
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,055
Go down

854
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:55,466
Yes,

855
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,904
the people can seek redress
with the comeback of a good counsel

856
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,103
I said it myself! Why rush to say it?

857
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:05,678
Hold it!

858
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,515
Ladies and gentlemen, please listen to

859
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,381
my husband for my sake

860
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,280
Look over there!

861
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,559
Don't move it!

862
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,249
It's enough for you

863
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,259
to build dozens of arches

864
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,324
Otherwise, split it

865
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:22,663
Yes, let's split it!

866
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,307
Mr Sung

867
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:39,713
Lord Ho

868
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,652
Thank you

869
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:44,410
Have you eaten?

870
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,078
Yes, thank you

871
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:47,381
Mr Sung...

872
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:49,090
Thank you...

873
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,720
Lord Ho

874
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,589
Thank you...

875
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,030
Please!

876
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,323
Sung Shih-chieh

877
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:57,933
Come on!

878
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,597
I've long heard...

879
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,861
of your eloquent defence

880
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,266
Is that true?

881
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,770
You're that paunchy Lord Ho Yu-ta

882
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:04,908
that gases...

883
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,167
from top to bottom?

884
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:06,900
You're insulting me!

885
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:07,668
I didn't mean to

886
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:08,675
I've heard of it only

887
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,574
Heard of it only? You're illiterate

888
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:11,180
Yes,

889
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,248
as illiterate as you are

890
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:13,974
I'm entirely different

891
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:14,742
What difference?

892
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,146
We both speak according to hearsay only

893
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,309
We're in the same trade

894
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,045
How dare you?

895
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,018
Sometimes we may get it wrong

896
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,486
They say you're a nut...

897
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,457
but I don't...

898
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:25,419
Think so

899
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,261
She's a native of Shansi

900
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,664
Why prosecute in Canton?

901
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,230
Your Honor, you're a native of Hunan

902
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,101
Why have you become
a magistrate in Canton?

903
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,977
You claim that her brother-in-law
and his wife killer her husband

904
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,636
and framed her for the murder. Any proof

905
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:46,647
No

906
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:47,749
That's a false accusation then

907
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:48,441
Hold it!

908
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:49,017
What?

909
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:49,618
May I ask Your Honor

910
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:50,685
Am I male or female?

911
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:51,479
Male of course

912
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,213
Any concrete proof?

913
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,082
The fact is...

914
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,521
You took a wife

915
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,524
and have children

916
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,787
This is logic

917
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,357
You're smart

918
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:02,222
Thank you

919
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,400
Her brother-in-law and his wife

920
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:06,763
Lost a brother followed by her departure

921
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:09,770
Yet they don't care a damn

922
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,471
Aren't they logically under suspicion,
Your Honor?

923
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:16,874
Did you see them put the poison?

924
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,079
Yes!

925
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:19,072
No!

926
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:22,685
My maid Mei saw it

927
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,846
She saw them put the poison
into the soup

928
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:34,462
After taking it, my husband died
of bleeding from his nostrils

929
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,493
This idiot ran away...

930
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,259
only after Mei reminded her of it

931
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,396
You're garrulous!

932
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,365
It shows the heart,
and the heart shows concern

933
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,200
That's why Kuan (Mandarin) has 2 mouths

934
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,134
My husband told me that

935
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,117
How coquettish!

936
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,359
Any result, Your Honor?

937
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:09,655
Good, I'll handle it for the time being

938
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,063
Thin Hu, Fat Lung

939
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,633
Your Honor, any mandate?

940
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,528
You set out for Shansi and escort

941
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,298
her brother and

942
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,908
sister-in-law back for trial

943
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,735
together with their maid Mei

944
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,437
Your order is understood!

945
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,343
Adjourned!

946
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:31,786
Hold it!

947
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,457
Your Honor, please stay!

948
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,161
May I ask you another question,

949
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,298
Your Honor?

950
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,761
What is it?

951
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,499
What's the charge...

952
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,034
for one framing a goodie?

953
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:50,537
It depends on the one framed?

954
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:51,670
A gentleman

955
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:53,235
Almost as good-looking as you are

956
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,308
Is that so?

957
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,202
Libel for a serious case,

958
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,508
insult for a light one

959
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,877
What would be your verdict?

960
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:05,749
Not premeditated

961
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,080
It depends on
whether it is premeditated or not

962
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,519
Even for that
he must pay scores of taels

963
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,752
Your Honor is enlightened

964
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:13,621
Bravo...

965
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:14,559
Thank you

966
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,355
What is it?

967
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:16,760
Pay me

968
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,427
Do I owe you any money?

969
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:22,969
You called me
an eloquent defence counsel

970
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,199
As you're in charge of this case,

971
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,865
it shows I'm speaking the truth

972
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,072
and you're guilty of "insult"

973
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:29,769
No...

974
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,177
Either you can't tell right from wrong
or are muddle-headed

975
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:34,105
Admit to either of these charges

976
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,945
Sorry

977
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,012
Pay Mr Sung 50 taels

978
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,281
Hush! If this circulates,

979
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,927
it may affect your prestige

980
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,688
How exciting!

981
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,098
You again?

982
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,306
Please

983
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,342
What a magistrate!

984
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,273
What a magistrate!

985
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,675
What a magistrate!

986
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:30,999
Your Excellency!

987
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,105
Yang, why do you insist...

988
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:34,209
on seeing me tonight?

989
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:34,935
It's urgent!

990
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,841
Those 2 constables

991
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,675
1 tall, 1 thin

992
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:39,679
said they rushed 3 months

993
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,648
all the way from Canton with a writ

994
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,378
to summon your sister Mrs Yao...

995
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:48,854
and her husband to Canton for trial

996
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:51,619
Miss, master

997
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:52,284
What's it?

998
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,589
Two constables from Canton are

999
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,255
here to arrest you

1000
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,531
You're sued for murder and seizure

1001
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,634
Mother...

1002
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,631
Murdering who?

1003
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:04,898
My brother-in-law

1004
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,037
My sister has really gone too far

1005
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:08,842
Your Honor, please have some mercy

1006
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:09,842
What mercy?

1007
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,978
Please calm down, Your Honor

1008
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,273
She's your sister

1009
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,417
Do something

1010
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,610
No way, life for life

1011
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:17,819
I'm your only daughter,

1012
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:20,013
do help me

1013
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:24,860
But how am I to help you?

1014
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,296
Mother, he's most filial to you

1015
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,191
He never disobeys you

1016
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,493
Help me, flute

1017
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,402
Yes

1018
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:34,696
Let me try

1019
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:46,941
Oh, finished!

1020
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:47,549
Hold it!

1021
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:48,779
My mammy calls me

1022
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,311
Why's he so obedient?

1023
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:53,050
Mother...

1024
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,157
Mother, are you alright?

1025
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:55,982
Brother

1026
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,458
You two are heartless

1027
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,223
So you really did it!

1028
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,655
Brother, help us

1029
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,731
You asked for it, why come to me?

1030
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,066
Mother, brother's right

1031
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,794
I deserve penalty

1032
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:10,172
Forget your daughter

1033
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:11,439
Darling,

1034
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:15,203
you're breaking my heart

1035
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,411
Mother!

1036
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,509
Blood!

1037
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,610
Mother's emitting blood! Alas!

1038
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:23,684
No!

1039
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,383
Mother's emitting much blood!

1040
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:26,453
Don't get mad!

1041
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:28,748
You broke her heart because you stood by

1042
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:32,725
seeing your sister taken away for trial

1043
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:35,860
Why give me this?

1044
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:37,722
Let me die of cold!

1045
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,129
Lychee honey!

1046
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:40,792
No!

1047
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:41,897
Mother!

1048
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,068
Break it!

1049
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:45,035
Mother!

1050
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,609
The one ruling is Canton magistrate

1051
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,711
Can't you a Chief Secretary...

1052
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,612
fix it?

1053
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:56,447
Let me die!

1054
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,215
I die! I die! I...

1055
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:03,320
Okay...

1056
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,222
Let me try!

1057
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:08,020
Yuan, Chuan

1058
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,198
Coming...

1059
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,797
Yes, madam?

1060
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:15,527
Keep the constables from Canton...

1061
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:18,435
by every means

1062
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:19,369
Hurry up...

1063
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,271
Yes!

1064
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,643
Have Yuan and Chuan rush to Canton

1065
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:25,975
Spend as much as...

1066
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,309
you can on bribery

1067
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:30,942
before your sister and
brother-in-law arrive

1068
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:35,317
Want to borrow my wet nurse?

1069
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:37,553
Yes! My grandson's got whooping cough

1070
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,319
No medication has proved effective

1071
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,258
They say human milk
is the most effective

1072
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:43,397
Wet nurse, come here!

1073
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:44,261
Yes, madam

1074
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:45,859
Come with her...

1075
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,465
to breast-feed her grandson

1076
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,533
Oh, no, my grandson's over 20

1077
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:50,673
Damn!

1078
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,468
Breast-feeding an adult?

1079
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,040
Well,

1080
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,475
milk some for him when you can

1081
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,440
Madam, you're taking me

1082
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,947
for a milk cow

1083
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,583
Mrs Sung, what now?

1084
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,001
Darling, not so hard!

1085
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,729
Okay!

1086
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:23,630
Alas!

1087
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,841
Darling, come on!

1088
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:30,604
What?

1089
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,178
No!

1090
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:32,246
Come on, hurry up!

1091
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,607
No, it's too big!

1092
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,645
This time it's getting big too soon!

1093
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,883
You shouldn't have cried so sexily

1094
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,425
to have turned me on!

1095
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,157
Go out...

1096
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,302
I really can't hold on

1097
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:55,933
I've boiled almond puree

1098
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:58,969
Mrs Sung

1099
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,576
I've fixed the human milk
maid Chang wants

1100
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,171
We're both female. Don't be shy

1101
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,082
Put it over there
I'll have the wet nurse bring it

1102
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,148
Okay

1103
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:15,283
Darling

1104
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,018
Mr Sung

1105
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:18,689
Mrs Sung will be back right away

1106
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,521
Will she?

1107
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,390
The almond puree is ready so soon

1108
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:27,926
You want it? Take it first

1109
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,398
No smell of almond

1110
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,839
It has a strong smell of milk

1111
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:42,181
Is this yours?

1112
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:43,517
Yes

1113
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:44,176
What is it?

1114
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:44,752
Milk

1115
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,515
Goat milk or cow milk?

1116
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,989
Human milk, from me

1117
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,894
Don't ever let anybody know of it

1118
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:03,904
I'll go out first

1119
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,813
There must be something between you two

1120
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:14,379
No

1121
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:16,450
You deny?

1122
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,487
Even with snake-bite?

1123
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,197
What a sexfriend
You tomcat while I'm pregnant

1124
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:31,062
Yueh Lai Inn?
Seems to be Sung Shih-chieh's

1125
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,230
Don't you know

1126
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,097
it's Sung Shih-chieh's?

1127
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,699
Sung Shih-chieh? He is dead

1128
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:39,138
Bitch!

1129
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,105
Sung Shih-chieh doesn't die
at right time

1130
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,713
What do you mean, gentlemen?

1131
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:51,016
Who are you?

1132
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,446
I'm the manager here

1133
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,915
If he died earlier, we wouldn't have to

1134
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,990
travel from Shansi to Canton in vain

1135
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:59,224
You came from Shansi?

1136
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,191
Only Shansi could have such elite

1137
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,293
Are you on an official mission?

1138
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,267
Yes, the Chief Secretary of Shansi

1139
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:08,929
is our boss

1140
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,605
We're to bring an important letter...

1141
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,141
to the magistrate here

1142
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,006
Why talk so much to this nobody?

1143
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,670
Okay

1144
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,546
You two really are...

1145
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,916
smart

1146
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,815
Did your Lord send you here to...

1147
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,857
Shut up! Is the Inn full?

1148
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,087
No, it was a mistake

1149
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:35,123
Please be seated, gentlemen

1150
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:36,263
Don't touch him

1151
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:37,900
I'll come right away
after fixing the room

1152
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:46,136
Madam...

1153
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,408
What is it, Mr Sung?

1154
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:50,737
Madam, don't cry

1155
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,247
2 men on a mission...

1156
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,111
from your brother-in-law

1157
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,507
I suspect they're up to something

1158
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,316
Madam... let me finish first

1159
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:01,885
Vacate your room for me to

1160
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,423
let it to them

1161
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,890
So we may have a chance to test them out

1162
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,221
OK, you're doing it for my own good!

1163
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,770
Mr Sung, you want to drink?

1164
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,064
No... it's for your son

1165
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:19,375
Take it if you like

1166
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,009
No, thanks, you milked it so hard

1167
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,136
Ground!

1168
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:24,608
Ground?

1169
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:26,280
It's almond puree!

1170
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,541
You can grind almond puree?

1171
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,484
Madam

1172
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,826
Don't crease my dress

1173
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,944
It's late. Don't yell!

1174
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,974
What a creep! He really entered her room

1175
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:07,670
You creep!

1176
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:11,337
Who's calling my name?

1177
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,681
Did you?

1178
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,879
You, a family woman, sneak into

1179
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,918
a men's room at this late hour

1180
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,852
You're acting like a whore

1181
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:22,753
What do you want?

1182
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:24,456
Give me a logical explanation

1183
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,293
Speak up!

1184
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,429
Come on!

1185
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,470
I've come to borrow a urinal,

1186
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,172
OK?

1187
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:44,278
Is it a logical explanation?

1188
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:46,906
No!

1189
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:51,180
Darling! In fact, I didn't come for this

1190
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:53,952
I know. You went to see Yang Hsiu-chen

1191
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,784
because you thought she was there

1192
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,626
Yes, how smart you are, darling!

1193
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,554
Of course,

1194
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,126
would I suspect you of anything?

1195
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:01,820
Would I be so unethical
as to suspect you?

1196
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:02,929
Would you suspect me of anything?

1197
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,961
No, of course not

1198
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,667
Outrageous! He's stolen a march!

1199
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,202
So what? I enjoy doing it

1200
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:11,062
I was only joking!

1201
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:13,868
Are you resenting?

1202
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:15,271
No

1203
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:16,743
What does this letter say?

1204
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,577
Judging from its contents,
Yang indeed...

1205
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,081
is innocent

1206
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:22,473
It's a letter...

1207
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,210
from the couple to

1208
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:25,513
Ho Yu-ta,
using the pull of the Chief Sec

1209
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,383
They offer a bribe to him...

1210
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:28,683
to frame Yang

1211
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:29,951
So cocky? Let's hit him!

1212
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,058
Don't act on impulse!

1213
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,323
This letter can be a strong evidence

1214
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,257
Let's put it back

1215
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:36,489
after copying it

1216
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,734
Right, you indeed are resourceful

1217
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,098
You didn't know before now

1218
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,963
I did, but I didn't say it

1219
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,534
Now I want you to say it thrice daily

1220
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,073
And don't dress a bun

1221
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,671
And don't raise hell and hit me

1222
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,339
Always take my advice

1223
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:54,016
Only on important issues

1224
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,650
Oh, no, you're too stupid to distinguish

1225
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,050
between important or not

1226
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,051
Alternatively,

1227
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,556
you must follow my advice

1228
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,418
whenever I say "maltose"

1229
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,731
I'm the handsomest in the world!

1230
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,958
Say "yes"

1231
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:13,895
Don't!

1232
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,401
Maltose

1233
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,200
You're the handsomest

1234
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:21,000
whether you want me to say it or not

1235
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:23,306
Do I have to do it?

1236
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:24,577
Maltose

1237
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:26,448
Couldn't care less!

1238
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,918
So it's like this

1239
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:41,320
Even the Shansi magistrate...

1240
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:43,556
didn't try it

1241
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:44,562
No, but our Lord wants

1242
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,668
Your Excellency...

1243
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:47,894
to cover it up

1244
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:49,866
You've said it all

1245
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:51,564
Your Excellency!

1246
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:53,106
Our mistress and husband...

1247
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,141
are rushing in

1248
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:57,779
with the constables. Please be lenient

1249
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,214
Please take these 5,000 taels

1250
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:01,814
I've been an honest mandarin,

1251
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:08,553
open and aboveboard

1252
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,791
Please convey the message
to the Chief Sec

1253
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,621
I'll do my best...

1254
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:14,888
in this case

1255
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,895
But I can't accept the money

1256
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:17,657
That's it

1257
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:18,425
Please return...!

1258
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,773
Please stay, gentlemen
Put the money here!

1259
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:28,206
Yes, Mrs Ho?

1260
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:29,569
Please convey my husband's...

1261
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,680
thanks to H.E.

1262
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,312
Didn't Magistrate Ho say
he's honest and righteous

1263
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,843
We have heavy expenses

1264
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:36,810
And righteous?

1265
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:39,250
It's not right to turn down a gift

1266
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:44,857
She's terrific...

1267
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:46,056
Let's go

1268
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:55,170
Mr and Mrs Yao greeting Your Honor

1269
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,536
Do you know...

1270
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:00,005
that woman holding a baby?

1271
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,706
Your Honor,
she's my sister-in-law Mrs Yao nee Yang

1272
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,403
Yes...

1273
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,571
Yang Hsiu-chen,
you murdered your husband

1274
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,377
and framed Mr and Mrs Yao for it

1275
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:10,711
Your Honor, I...

1276
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,044
Shut up! Keep quiet now!

1277
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,925
Your Honor,
is it the first time you see Mrs Yao?

1278
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:17,852
What if it is?

1279
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,263
You really are stupid then

1280
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:23,360
Why?

1281
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,066
Since it is the first time,

1282
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,594
you should have acted more tactfully

1283
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:28,669
Did I do it not brilliantly enough?

1284
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:29,395
No!

1285
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,566
You should've feigned
to take everyone's statements

1286
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:34,773
You arbitrated...

1287
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:36,309
even before Mr and Mrs Tien
said anything

1288
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,242
It shows there was a tacit agreement

1289
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,810
That's unworthy of you...

1290
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,350
as a magistrate

1291
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,447
You... I...

1292
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:48,882
Without teaching you a lesson,

1293
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:51,019
I will never be a mandarin again!

1294
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,089
Come on, use torture!

1295
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:52,851
Your Honor,

1296
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,963
which torture? A, B or C?

1297
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,166
C

1298
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,467
Hold it! What is Torture C?

1299
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:00,791
C is C

1300
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:01,829
No torture!

1301
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:03,062
You female have no right to speak

1302
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,768
My husband is still a bachelor

1303
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:06,806
You can't do anything

1304
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,238
you please to him

1305
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,905
Lord Ho knows better

1306
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:11,738
You don't have to remind him

1307
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:16,783
If you try tricks, I'll oblige

1308
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:19,046
If you go too far, you can't hold on

1309
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:20,216
Adjourned!

1310
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,252
I play along on anything serious,
Your Honor!

1311
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:24,723
You three think it over

1312
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:26,793
Uncle, you haven't defecated for 10 days

1313
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:28,487
And you haven't slept well for a month

1314
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:30,791
Your sow aborted and

1315
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:31,831
died last night

1316
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:34,126
All this happened

1317
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,634
because Sung Shih-chieh

1318
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:38,999
spoiled the feng shui of the arch

1319
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,176
You two are his elder
Sung Shih-chieh...

1320
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:44,775
is not giving you any face

1321
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:45,945
In my view...

1322
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:47,274
Uncle...

1323
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,078
Just say what you've in mind!

1324
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:51,780
Come on!

1325
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,917
Isn't it right to punish him?

1326
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,288
Just go on

1327
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,297
Okay...

1328
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,767
Uncle and neighbors

1329
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:06,833
They're so rude

1330
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,364
They left without saying goodbye

1331
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:11,673
To strip him of his bachelorhood?

1332
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,232
Why've you got downstairs so soon?

1333
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:14,633
Hit him!

1334
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:19,738
Didn't I say you can't beat a bachelor?

1335
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,910
You're a mere magistrate

1336
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,548
If I became a master,
I might be your superior

1337
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:25,749
Change the subject!

1338
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:29,822
You're no longer a bachelor!

1339
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:30,855
Royal tutor

1340
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:35,061
Why're you here? Teacher

1341
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,324
Sung Shih-chieh, I disqualified you

1342
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,728
as a bachelor
because you spoiled the feng shui

1343
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:41,002
Sorry for the trouble, sir

1344
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,329
Don't mention it

1345
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:43,663
Please...

1346
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:53,710
They've conspired against me

1347
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:55,544
That's no way to cope with me

1348
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:56,741
Darling

1349
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:58,976
Show me that letter

1350
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:01,515
It's with you!

1351
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:05,860
It's not with me. It's with you!

1352
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:06,952
With me?

1353
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:08,059
Wait, Your Honor

1354
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:14,996
They can't testify without that letter

1355
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,168
Excuse me...

1356
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,239
Help! Keep away! Don't be in the way

1357
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,333
What're you two up to?

1358
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:22,641
Well, Your Honor!

1359
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,405
I forgot to bring an important document

1360
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,343
Would you give me two hours?

1361
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:27,777
Outrageous! Come on!

1362
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:28,279
Yes!

1363
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:29,008
Slap him!

1364
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:29,682
Hold it!

1365
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:30,511
What?

1366
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:33,416
Let me warn you first

1367
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:35,489
I know all about your scandal

1368
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,454
You'll regret lifting one hair from me

1369
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:38,088
Slap him!

1370
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:38,919
Hold it!

1371
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:40,859
Scared now?

1372
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:43,031
Now I'll strip you and slap you naked

1373
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:43,995
Slap!

1374
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:45,024
What?

1375
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,897
Hit me harder if you have the nerve

1376
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:51,028
The harder you hit, the harder I sue you

1377
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,968
What have you got against me?

1378
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:54,767
40 heavy slaps!

1379
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:55,672
Hold it!

1380
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:59,113
40 slaps? Too few!

1381
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:00,807
Double it if you dare!

1382
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:03,008
Good, I'll round it up to 100

1383
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:04,052
Hold it!

1384
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,710
What is it now?

1385
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:08,252
Nothing. I'm yelling. Damn it!

1386
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,190
Swear words! Slap!

1387
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:12,760
Hold it!

1388
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:13,585
Hold it!

1389
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:14,854
What do you want now?

1390
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,756
Fu, the letter is here

1391
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,262
Secretary, read it loudly for me!

1392
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:21,130
Yes!

1393
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:24,600
Darling,

1394
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:28,869
I XX with you till dawn last night

1395
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,609
So I know your XX is powerful

1396
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,078
Why?

1397
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,646
Darling, I XX you

1398
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:37,881
Oh, God, the wrong letter!

1399
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:42,517
What letter is this, Sung Shih-chieh?

1400
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,093
A love letter from my wife

1401
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,091
It's unintelligible

1402
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:50,323
XX till dawn

1403
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,526
A letter!

1404
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,731
What do you mean "XX is powerful"?

1405
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:57,903
My brush

1406
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:00,233
You didn't write it...

1407
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,273
properly

1408
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:02,903
Let me teach you again at home

1409
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:04,605
Halt!

1410
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:05,771
What's going on?

1411
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:07,607
Have you had enough fun?

1412
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,009
Come on, slap!

1413
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:10,612
Don't! Who dares to slap my husband?

1414
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:11,877
Slap!

1415
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:17,555
Oh, no!

1416
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:22,922
Brazen!

1417
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,034
Brazen! There's order in Court

1418
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:27,159
Go away!

1419
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:27,926
Let him go

1420
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:29,635
Maltose

1421
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:31,536
You promised to obey me!

1422
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,439
Take care of the baby you carry,
if not yourself

1423
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:36,444
Maltose! Go now!

1424
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:37,271
Good

1425
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,576
Wait for me!

1426
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:42,077
Fu, go home and get the letter

1427
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:44,716
I'd be a beast

1428
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:47,088
if I didn't take revenge!

1429
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,814
Good, I'll give you a chance

1430
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,957
After the torture, you'll be paraded

1431
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,788
to arouse public attention

1432
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:56,154
Wake me up when it comes to 100!

1433
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,157
Yes, Your Honor!

1434
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:02,764
Ho Yu-ta

1435
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:04,901
Mind you may not live
to spend the 5000 taels

1436
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:06,597
Crazy! When have I got the money?

1437
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,338
If I had taken it, I'd have retired!

1438
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:10,911
You've to go on if you did take it!

1439
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,745
I don't have it, so I'm here

1440
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:13,404
I took it

1441
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:14,673
You did?

1442
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,817
Darling, you took the money?

1443
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:19,247
The money from the Chief Secretary?

1444
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,250
How could you have taken it?

1445
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:24,518
Hold it...!

1446
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,388
How did he know about this?

1447
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,496
Never mind, just let him go

1448
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:29,789
No...

1449
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,259
If I do, I'd be under more suspicion!

1450
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:35,795
We must persist to the end!

1451
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:36,995
Have you found that letter?

1452
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,140
No, madam

1453
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:39,797
I've searched the whole room
without finding it

1454
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,114
Oh, bad, Madam!

1455
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,618
Master's being put on parade!

1456
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:00,319
Mrs Sung... forget it...

1457
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:01,360
I'd better give up

1458
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,360
Just say yes or no!

1459
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:03,320
I...

1460
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:04,124
Get going!

1461
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:20,640
Master!

1462
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:27,345
Why're you here? Run quick!

1463
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,923
Wait for me!

1464
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:38,859
And you've brought a group!

1465
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:50,944
Withstand for me

1466
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,315
Open attacks are resistible,

1467
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:58,544
but not sniping

1468
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:11,959
O-Mei swordplay?

1469
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:18,363
Hell with you!

1470
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:27,038
Hell with you, bastard!

1471
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:29,181
You've broken the bag
I've kept for years!

1472
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:00,306
Are you alright?

1473
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:09,652
Darling!

1474
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,114
Darling!

1475
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,637
Darling, is it coming?

1476
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:32,842
Hell...

1477
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,450
Help!

1478
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,583
Take Sung Shih-chieh away!

1479
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:45,487
Yang!

1480
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:50,657
We can't win, run!

1481
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,005
Darling, don't scare me

1482
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:01,909
You're...?

1483
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:02,566
Here

1484
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:03,302
Delivering?

1485
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:04,240
Yes!

1486
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,076
Terrible!

1487
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:10,079
Go over, quick!

1488
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:18,791
Protect the prisoner

1489
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,360
If he dies, you'll all suffer

1490
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:25,362
Stand back...

1491
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:30,298
Harder! Will be over soon...

1492
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:33,599
Retreat!

1493
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,404
Darling!

1494
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:38,935
Darling

1495
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,384
Out? Is it out?

1496
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:49,416
Master, madam has given birth!

1497
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,081
Wet nurse, has it got a bird?

1498
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,959
No

1499
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:01,628
Why're you here?

1500
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,032
For a celebration drink

1501
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,771
What? You visit prisoners or

1502
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,135
get jailed here

1503
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:09,340
Never mind him. He can't try tricks

1504
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:14,048
Secretary Sung,
you've sacrificed too much

1505
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:15,714
Sure

1506
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:19,377
Now my only wish is...

1507
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:22,081
for a child with a bird

1508
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,989
A bird for a girl?

1509
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,665
What? Say that again

1510
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,203
My wife have given birth to a daughter?

1511
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:37,063
Yes!

1512
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:41,368
So God has given me a little favor

1513
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:42,675
What can I do for you, please?

1514
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:44,170
Break jail

1515
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,138
I won't do anything against the law

1516
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:47,312
Creep!

1517
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,946
How did Yang Hsiu-chen's brother die?

1518
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,450
An accident

1519
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:55,081
The fan owner can prove it

1520
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,017
Don't deceive yourself
as it's against Heaven

1521
01:14:58,193 --> 01:14:59,956
Don't fail the people
as it's failing yourself

1522
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:02,527
There's hope for us now!

1523
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:03,596
Who's he?

1524
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,460
Also a creep

1525
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:08,966
A mandarin's a creep, but he's honest

1526
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,502
His wife left him

1527
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:11,604
because he accepts no bribes

1528
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:13,104
His dedication won him...

1529
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:14,264
quick promotions

1530
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:15,273
and he's now...

1531
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,468
An Inspector General

1532
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:19,372
A saviour! What are we to do now?

1533
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:20,704
You, not we!

1534
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,414
Intercept him and
petition to him on the way

1535
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:25,853
It's alright for you...

1536
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,682
to sacrifice for justice

1537
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,513
Absolutely alright

1538
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:30,622
Good

1539
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:38,393
Thank you!

1540
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,100
Hand it over to him in person

1541
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,168
Take care!

1542
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:43,995
You're now in a dangerous situation

1543
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,732
No, it's closely guarded here

1544
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:49,605
Outsiders can't enter freely

1545
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:52,312
You must've braved many difficulties...

1546
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:53,470
getting here

1547
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:54,445
But...

1548
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,311
I got in only
after saying something casual

1549
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:58,146
Good! I know you're okay!

1550
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,379
Don't be mushy!
Let's get down to important business

1551
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:01,485
Go now!

1552
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:02,747
Good, I'll take my leave

1553
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:10,328
What's there to see?

1554
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:11,856
To see somebody

1555
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,178
See if you can stay alive!

1556
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:32,648
Just his luck

1557
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:34,118
He got pursued even in a parade

1558
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,554
It will be disastrous if he dies

1559
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:39,284
If he dies, you can't bear it,
Your Honor

1560
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:40,392
I know

1561
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:48,000
What are you doing?

1562
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:50,529
What is it, Lord?

1563
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:51,195
Go and give chase

1564
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:53,273
No point in chasing now

1565
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,704
It won't get us anywhere

1566
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:55,736
Give chase!

1567
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,443
He's passed out! Wake him up quick!

1568
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:14,588
Sung Shih-chieh, are you alright?

1569
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,525
Walk 2 steps to show me

1570
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:22,602
What on earth are you up to?

1571
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,236
You told me to do that!

1572
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,236
Clap your hands now!

1573
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:34,843
Clap your hands now

1574
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,010
Why're you clapping? What's so exciting?

1575
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,351
Your mom's pregnant?

1576
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:43,022
Is he really mad?

1577
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,789
Sung Shih-chieh is mad...

1578
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:51,023
Sung Shih-chieh is mad in jail!

1579
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,061
Really? Why has he suddenly got mad?

1580
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:57,761
Halt!

1581
01:17:57,939 --> 01:17:58,667
Sit down!

1582
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,040
What are you up to?

1583
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:04,377
Do you recognize...

1584
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:05,945
that woman holding a baby

1585
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:09,745
No

1586
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:11,742
Are you sure?

1587
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:13,479
Hold it!

1588
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:14,246
Good!

1589
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:15,179
Idiot...!

1590
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:19,420
Darling, they say you're mad

1591
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:20,856
Is it true?

1592
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:22,361
Are you up to something again?

1593
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:23,395
Who are you speaking...

1594
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:25,226
upside down?

1595
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,424
Come on, take him out for torture

1596
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,366
See how long you can hold on

1597
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:35,471
So you can still hold on

1598
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:37,110
Good! Let me give you another kick!

1599
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:38,337
Give it back to me!

1600
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:39,104
Why have you taken away my daughter?

1601
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:41,575
Quiet! I know what to do

1602
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,542
Sung, both women claim...

1603
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,050
to be mother to the daughter?

1604
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,687
How would you handle it?

1605
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:48,622
Why ask me? Making fun of me?

1606
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:49,414
I'm soliciting...

1607
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:51,559
your personal view only

1608
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,126
for my reference

1609
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:53,918
Don't make fun...

1610
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:55,085
of your own daughter

1611
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,389
Chop it into two and

1612
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:58,328
each gets a share

1613
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:00,127
Are you mad?

1614
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:01,132
She's your daughter too!

1615
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:01,892
You've a share too

1616
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:04,138
Have I? Cut it into three pieces

1617
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,204
I'll take the middle portion

1618
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:06,469
Moustachio, have you got a share?

1619
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:07,369
Yes!

1620
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,009
Secretary

1621
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:12,605
Sung, split it into four portions

1622
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:13,839
Be fair to make them equal

1623
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:14,906
Good!

1624
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,185
I'll chop...

1625
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:21,618
Chop...

1626
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:30,256
Darling, are you crazy?

1627
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,497
It's your daughter!

1628
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:38,062
What're you two up to?

1629
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:38,929
You're mad!

1630
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:42,167
Sung Shih-chieh, a wise man like you

1631
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:44,676
has ended up this way

1632
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:47,815
No point in jailing you any more

1633
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:51,877
I order that
you and your family be expelled

1634
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:53,413
and all your assets confiscated

1635
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,585
Keep away...!

1636
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:02,886
You'll get mad if you stay alive!

1637
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:05,191
See if you can sue me any more!

1638
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:09,836
Out of the way! Don't look!

1639
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:31,856
Madam

1640
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,193
Leave everything behind except

1641
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:40,197
what you're wearing

1642
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:41,532
You're cocky

1643
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:42,731
Dropped!

1644
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:46,032
We'll seize everything...

1645
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:47,140
you drop

1646
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:58,414
How come he's come to such a state?

1647
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:03,320
Anyway, he's still my husband

1648
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:10,556
Darling!

1649
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:11,357
Quiet!

1650
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:14,394
Let's go

1651
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:15,399
Yes!

1652
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:22,300
Madam, are you alright?

1653
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:25,377
Yes

1654
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:29,216
I was thinking
he never said "I love you"

1655
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:32,409
since I married him over 10 years ago

1656
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,218
Sorry!

1657
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:36,750
I love you!

1658
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:37,920
A relapse!

1659
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:38,559
Let me knock him unconscious

1660
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:39,591
Maniac!

1661
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:41,422
He's only acting mad. Give a hand

1662
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:42,727
Come on quick!

1663
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:47,793
Where's my daughter?

1664
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:48,594
Master

1665
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:49,600
Show me my daughter

1666
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:50,499
Come...

1667
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:56,406
Look, she's plumper than her wet nurse

1668
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:03,611
One nest for one bird

1669
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,248
Look how cute she is

1670
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:10,821
Master, you acted brilliantly

1671
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:12,653
Even I got taken in!

1672
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:14,553
If I couldn't even fool you,
I'd jump to the sea!

1673
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,421
If I didn't act mad,
I couldn't stay alive

1674
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:20,633
But now they've to die instead of me

1675
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:21,527
Darling,

1676
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:23,902
Look!

1677
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:24,933
The letter!

1678
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:26,305
How come it's with you?

1679
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:27,699
It has been with me

1680
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,605
Why didn't you hand it to the magistrate

1681
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,902
He accepts bribes to pervert justice

1682
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,138
He would've destroyed any evidence

1683
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:34,873
I presented to him

1684
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:38,510
In fact, I'm waiting for a chance

1685
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,617
for the appearance
of the Inspector General

1686
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,623
to punish all the corrupt officials

1687
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:02,572
Innocence, Your Honor!

1688
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:06,076
How dare you block the Lord?

1689
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:08,343
Whatever your grievance, 30 slaps first

1690
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:10,817
30 slaps for that?

1691
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,875
So it's you!

1692
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:42,615
Bureaucratic conspiracy!

1693
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:46,049
He's notorious...

1694
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:48,052
for his sharp practice

1695
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,257
He even acted mad to deceive me

1696
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,922
How could you a magistrate...

1697
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:55,990
spoil a bachelor?

1698
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:58,232
He won't take me...

1699
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,662
a magistrate seriously

1700
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:01,961
He even claimed that
even Your Excellency

1701
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:05,463
I'll be straight, Your Excellency!

1702
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:08,605
Combined with us,

1703
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:10,039
are not his match

1704
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:10,836
Bastard!

1705
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:13,510
How can a bachelor outsmart us?

1706
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:14,874
My Lord,

1707
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,176
many bet heavily that

1708
01:24:16,351 --> 01:24:19,013
Sung Shih-chieh will win this case

1709
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:23,155
Good!

1710
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:26,552
Let me see how capable Sung is

1711
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:36,302
Court!

1712
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:49,307
Summon Sung Shih-chieh and
party concerned!

1713
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:56,417
Make an autograph...

1714
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,694
We must win by every means

1715
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,361
Thank you

1716
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:12,867
Make an autograph!

1717
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:14,642
Thanks for your support

1718
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,209
Thank you

1719
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:30,857
Inspector General!

1720
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,151
Listen,

1721
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:34,989
you're no longer a bachelor

1722
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:37,790
Kneel down before the Inspector General

1723
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:40,363
It shows your contempt to Court

1724
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:43,734
Since you Lords insist on superficiality

1725
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:46,066
I don't mind kneeling down

1726
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:48,300
Nonsense! It befits propriety

1727
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:49,908
to respect Court officers

1728
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,438
The respect comes...

1729
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:54,980
from the heart only

1730
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,311
Don't you agree, Lord?

1731
01:25:57,585 --> 01:25:58,415
Sung Shih-chieh!

1732
01:25:58,653 --> 01:25:59,347
Sung Shih-chieh!

1733
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:01,719
You've my permission not to kneel

1734
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:04,089
Thank you, My Lord!

1735
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:09,129
How did the couple...

1736
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:10,889
murder Yang's husband?

1737
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:14,700
Lord Ho, how did her husband die?

1738
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:15,800
Yang...

1739
01:26:16,538 --> 01:26:18,631
She made her husband die...

1740
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:21,468
bleeding from nostrils

1741
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:23,434
Inspector General, you hear that

1742
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:25,773
Summon Chen Erh

1743
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:26,845
Summon Chen Erh

1744
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,582
Announce your occupation to the Lords

1745
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:35,387
An undertaker of Shansi, My Lord!

1746
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:38,851
The cause
of Hsiu-chen's husband's death, please?

1747
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:42,187
Deadly poison, as the autopsy shows it

1748
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:46,194
What? Say that again loudly!

1749
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:49,494
Deadly poison

1750
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,838
You're wicked, you murdered my husband!

1751
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,645
Don't cry, don't just cry!

1752
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:00,537
You could be the one doing it!

1753
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:01,804
Yes!

1754
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:02,881
You could've put the poison!

1755
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:04,482
Yes...

1756
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,714
If it's true, you'll suffer

1757
01:27:06,955 --> 01:27:07,512
Me?

1758
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:08,255
Make way!

1759
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:09,082
You!

1760
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:12,088
Someone died tragically...

1761
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:12,885
in your area of jurisdiction,

1762
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:14,289
but you didn't care

1763
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:16,453
Isn't that your responsibility?

1764
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:19,422
Blast...!

1765
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:20,827
Why're you scared like that?

1766
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:21,627
You aren't the murderer, are you?

1767
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:24,436
No, Mr and Mrs Yao

1768
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,601
Innocence, Your Honor! Innocence!

1769
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:27,741
No,

1770
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:30,471
it's been proved Yao Erh died
of deadly poison

1771
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:32,972
and you claimed his wife
caused his death

1772
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:35,047
Why did you lie
if you were free from suspicion?

1773
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:36,682
He died of blood-emitting

1774
01:27:36,851 --> 01:27:37,840
It could be poison or

1775
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:38,610
mental stimulation

1776
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:39,783
No more subterfuge

1777
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:41,981
Please arbitrate, Your Honor

1778
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:46,490
Even if Yao Erh did die of poisoning,

1779
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:48,728
there's no proof...

1780
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:49,988
the Yao couple did it

1781
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:50,892
Right!

1782
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:52,927
Right he is!

1783
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:54,731
Summon Hsiao Mei!

1784
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,931
Summon Hsiao Mei!

1785
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:58,700
Come on!

1786
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:02,610
Hsiao Mei greeting the Lords!

1787
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:04,035
Hsiao Mei

1788
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:05,510
Are you Hsiao Mei?

1789
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:08,909
Where were you when the murder occurred?

1790
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:11,978
Since madam disappeared,

1791
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:13,552
I returned to the country

1792
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:17,053
You were on the spot. Tell the truth

1793
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:20,058
No, I was not on the spot!

1794
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:22,358
How could you go back on your words now?

1795
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:23,926
You told me

1796
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:26,362
they poisoned my husband to death

1797
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:27,898
and to run away

1798
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:30,033
Why're you backing out on your remark?

1799
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:31,805
I didn't

1800
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:37,801
Besides...

1801
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:38,843
Enough!

1802
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:41,376
You may go home and retire. Thank you

1803
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:42,474
Your Honor!

1804
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:43,511
Sung Shih-chieh

1805
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,119
Not yet your turn

1806
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:47,981
Hsiao Mei, you go on

1807
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:51,257
I'm madam's personal maid

1808
01:28:51,592 --> 01:28:54,857
Normally she was tough...

1809
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:56,894
to her husband

1810
01:28:57,298 --> 01:28:58,492
You...

1811
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:02,461
Sometimes she brought in some hooligans

1812
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:06,096
I wasn't on the spot
on the day of the accident

1813
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:07,773
But the previous night I heard her

1814
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:11,603
quarreling fiercely with master

1815
01:29:11,879 --> 01:29:14,575
The following day master died

1816
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:17,509
What've you to say, Sung Shih-chieh?

1817
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,278
Bad!

1818
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:23,357
Your Honor, now the truth is out

1819
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,549
Yang Hsiu-chen murdered her husband

1820
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:27,456
Sung framed others for it

1821
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:31,491
Counsel Sung, you've got more than that

1822
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:33,894
Your Honor is superb!

1823
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:36,431
Here's a letter

1824
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:37,600
It was written...

1825
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:40,866
by Shansi Chief Sec to Ho Yu-ta

1826
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:43,937
I got it perchance and copied it

1827
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:47,846
The contents?

1828
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:50,984
Really exciting

1829
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:53,076
To cover up...

1830
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:53,777
his sister's murder,

1831
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:56,389
he bribed Ho Yu-ta with 5000 taels

1832
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:59,088
to turn a blind eye to it

1833
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:01,925
Your Honor, the letter only illustrated

1834
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:03,961
to me the case with the request

1835
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:06,896
that I judged it fairly

1836
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:10,801
Where's it now?

1837
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:12,434
Already burnt up

1838
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:13,503
Read this letter then

1839
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:14,367
Hold it!

1840
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:16,975
You claimed to have copied it

1841
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:18,007
It could be false

1842
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:22,177
The one I copied has been sent
to Lord Ho

1843
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:24,745
The one I'm now holding is the original

1844
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:27,786
There's no proof

1845
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:30,584
whether it's true or false

1846
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:31,587
Check the handwriting. Your Honor!

1847
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:32,785
Right!

1848
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:33,619
Hold it!

1849
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:34,923
What do you want?

1850
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:36,661
Peepers of an official document...

1851
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:38,799
will have their eyes gouged out

1852
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:39,829
Is that right, Your Honor?

1853
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:43,535
Yes, there's such a clause

1854
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:46,639
If you did peep at it,

1855
01:30:46,808 --> 01:30:48,036
have your eyes gouged out

1856
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:50,672
If you do it yourself,

1857
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:52,335
we'll believe you

1858
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:55,514
Don't you agree,

1859
01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:56,650
Inspector General?

1860
01:30:56,818 --> 01:30:57,614
Yes

1861
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:58,774
Gouge your eyes out!

1862
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:04,489
Can this be done
to any other part of the body?

1863
01:31:04,725 --> 01:31:07,125
Brazen! Observe order in Court

1864
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:08,558
Use the torture!

1865
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,232
Are you going to do it or not?

1866
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:29,078
No!

1867
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:33,009
You're guilty of false accusation and

1868
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:34,619
insult to Court officers then

1869
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,583
What punishment according to law,
Your Honor?

1870
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:39,524
Hook his tongue

1871
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:40,861
Have the torture ready!

1872
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:46,199
Sung, either you gouge your eyes or

1873
01:31:46,367 --> 01:31:47,163
hook your tongue

1874
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:48,800
There's no other choice

1875
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:58,175
Darling

1876
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:01,912
Use torture!

1877
01:32:04,752 --> 01:32:05,514
Hold it!

1878
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:06,277
Who said that?

1879
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:07,210
Me!

1880
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:08,044
What is it?

1881
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:09,081
Someone defecates

1882
01:32:09,423 --> 01:32:09,889
Who?

1883
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:10,890
Me!

1884
01:32:11,058 --> 01:32:12,685
My daughter defecates

1885
01:32:13,327 --> 01:32:15,352
Your Honor, please allow us
to change her diaper

1886
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:18,758
Nonsense, how can this be done in Court?

1887
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,591
You...

1888
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:24,998
Lord Ho has been gassing

1889
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:27,671
Why're officers allowed to gas

1890
01:32:27,842 --> 01:32:29,605
but the people banned from defecating?

1891
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:31,940
What justice is that? Please comment

1892
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:32,772
What justice is that?

1893
01:32:33,114 --> 01:32:34,103
And he gassed loudly

1894
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:35,540
What justice is that?

1895
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:38,478
You may change

1896
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:39,649
Thank you, Your Honor!

1897
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:41,317
What now?

1898
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:42,046
Be nice...

1899
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:42,985
A daughter's a nuisance

1900
01:32:43,157 --> 01:32:45,091
She defecates more

1901
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:47,894
Do more good then

1902
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:49,359
All your sons are dead

1903
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:50,826
Haven't I done any good?

1904
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:52,766
Bitch, it was all your fault

1905
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:53,263
No!

1906
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:54,526
What? I haven't finished

1907
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:56,234
You know nothing but crying

1908
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:57,196
I've endured you long

1909
01:32:57,538 --> 01:32:58,835
You made my wife...

1910
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,198
take up your case

1911
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:01,840
and we're in a hell lot of trouble
Listen...

1912
01:33:02,143 --> 01:33:02,507
I really didn't...

1913
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:04,611
Quiet! Now I'm the most innocent

1914
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:05,569
Please...

1915
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:06,474
which of you would care
to fling this for me?

1916
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:07,170
I get no good return. Look, how pitiable

1917
01:33:07,348 --> 01:33:07,973
Please do me a favor by flinging it?

1918
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:11,150
Anybody care to give a hand?

1919
01:33:13,788 --> 01:33:14,880
Observe order in Court!

1920
01:33:17,858 --> 01:33:19,018
Who is it now?

1921
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:21,126
Who else could it be?

1922
01:33:23,297 --> 01:33:23,820
Me?

1923
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:26,298
Lord Ho, you're a scholar

1924
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,024
Behave in court

1925
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:31,629
Forget it!

1926
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:38,371
Be careful!

1927
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:39,444
Be nice, don't cry!

1928
01:34:00,735 --> 01:34:01,963
Darling, come here!

1929
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:05,667
How come there's one ingot of silver?

1930
01:34:05,873 --> 01:34:06,862
It's Lord Ho's

1931
01:34:07,908 --> 01:34:08,966
Why is my silver with you?

1932
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,944
Why's Lord Ho's silver with you?

1933
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:15,148
There's a reason. Don't ask me!

1934
01:34:15,449 --> 01:34:16,507
Tell us

1935
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:17,612
I can't

1936
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:19,017
Why not?

1937
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:21,014
No, it's only between you and me

1938
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:22,222
You...

1939
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:23,485
You seduced my wife

1940
01:34:23,858 --> 01:34:24,415
Me?

1941
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:25,781
You old dog,

1942
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,688
you seduced his wife

1943
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:27,259
I didn't

1944
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:27,689
Don't deny!

1945
01:34:27,862 --> 01:34:28,954
Tramp, confess or

1946
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:30,062
I'll drown you

1947
01:34:30,231 --> 01:34:31,823
OK. Ho bought a house and

1948
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:33,261
I earned a commission as the middleman

1949
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:34,329
When did I buy a house?

1950
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,136
Why not?
Remember the female impersonator Huang

1951
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,702
Female impersonator Huang, a womaniser?

1952
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:38,770
How did Lord Ho know him?

1953
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:40,530
No, it was Mrs Ho who bought it

1954
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:42,507
When did you buy it from him?

1955
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:43,609
I didn't, master

1956
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:45,075
You women are heartless

1957
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:47,043
Lord Ho works so hard
and doesn't earn much

1958
01:34:47,214 --> 01:34:49,341
But you spent his money on a man...

1959
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:50,340
How much did you pay for it?

1960
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:51,246
5,000 taels

1961
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:53,617
You spent 5,000 taels on a man?

1962
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:55,688
Don't listen to them
Where've I got 5,000 taels?

1963
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:56,584
You don't have the money?

1964
01:34:58,292 --> 01:34:59,350
I dared not take it,

1965
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:00,721
but you spent it on a man

1966
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:02,528
I didn't spend any cent of it

1967
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:03,129
You didn't?

1968
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:05,697
You lie!
You didn't spend Chief Sec's money

1969
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:06,560
How could it be with my wife?

1970
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:07,063
Crazy!

1971
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:09,031
The Chief Sec's money is still inside

1972
01:35:09,503 --> 01:35:12,768
His money is inside!

1973
01:35:20,881 --> 01:35:22,246
Mrs Ho, sorry for the trouble

1974
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:23,644
You may go home and retire

1975
01:35:26,787 --> 01:35:30,086
Your Excellency must've heard it clearly

1976
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:32,822
Sung, even if I did
give Magistrate Ho 5000 taels

1977
01:35:32,993 --> 01:35:34,585
you can't sue me for bribery

1978
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:36,453
Isn't it OK for me to send him a gift?

1979
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:39,424
The letter can show
whether it was a bribery

1980
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,726
Dare you still mention that letter?

1981
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:43,595
Just now you deliberately
changed the subject

1982
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:45,363
I forgot to accuse you
of unauthorized reading

1983
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:46,562
and the penalty
of eye-gouging and tongue-hooking

1984
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:47,901
Come on, execute!

1985
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:49,440
Bullshit!

1986
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:53,277
It was not a document,

1987
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:55,773
When did I read the document?

1988
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:57,949
only a piece of white paper

1989
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,480
He lies, Your Honor!

1990
01:36:04,325 --> 01:36:04,984
Brazen!

1991
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:06,385
You lie in Court

1992
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,221
For lying in Court, the penalty is

1993
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:10,555
50 slaps according to the law of Ching

1994
01:36:10,865 --> 01:36:12,594
I'd be delighted to get the penalty

1995
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:15,167
Even 2 more blows are OK with me

1996
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:16,262
But...

1997
01:36:16,837 --> 01:36:19,670
here's the genuine document
I brought here

1998
01:36:20,007 --> 01:36:21,668
I didn't read it and deserve no penalty

1999
01:36:22,076 --> 01:36:25,102
And you're guilty of...

2000
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:26,803
Keep cool...

2001
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:28,243
Stealing the document?

2002
01:36:28,682 --> 01:36:29,546
100 spanks plus 5 years in exile,

2003
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:31,708
according to law

2004
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:33,414
Sung Shih-chieh!

2005
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:35,680
I expected that and couldn't care less!

2006
01:36:35,923 --> 01:36:37,049
If you hadn't read that letter,

2007
01:36:37,224 --> 01:36:40,751
how could you have accused me of bribery

2008
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:45,858
Come on, what have you to say?

2009
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:47,761
We're winning...

2010
01:36:52,173 --> 01:36:55,267
Frankly, it was my hypothesis only

2011
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:58,877
Your Honor, what is the penalty for

2012
01:36:59,113 --> 01:37:01,377
hypothesis in Court according to law?

2013
01:37:04,285 --> 01:37:05,115
Nil

2014
01:37:06,253 --> 01:37:07,845
Luck's with me

2015
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:10,146
But I'm ready to bear the other crime

2016
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:11,749
Isn't it appropriate for Lord Tien...

2017
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,691
to clarify himself now?

2018
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:17,596
Why not read out loudly
the contents of this letter?

2019
01:37:17,865 --> 01:37:19,093
If my hypothesis is wrong and

2020
01:37:19,266 --> 01:37:20,858
damaging to the Lords,

2021
01:37:21,202 --> 01:37:22,499
I'll be condemned and

2022
01:37:22,903 --> 01:37:25,064
my whole family and I are ready...

2023
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:26,399
to be beheaded

2024
01:37:26,874 --> 01:37:27,306
Yes!

2025
01:37:27,474 --> 01:37:29,999
Lord Tien, please read it

2026
01:37:30,878 --> 01:37:33,711
Are you shy? Let me

2027
01:37:34,315 --> 01:37:35,373
Lord Ho, better you read it

2028
01:37:35,616 --> 01:37:36,810
I dropped something
Let me pick it up first

2029
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:37,473
I'll wait

2030
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:39,380
It takes some time. It dropped again...

2031
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:42,445
Sit down
I shouldn't have made you read it

2032
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,714
You must be illiterate

2033
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:45,187
Since no one would read it,

2034
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,487
please read it, Your Honor
You're justice

2035
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:51,088
Don't pick any more! Time off!

2036
01:37:51,265 --> 01:37:52,129
Pick it once again

2037
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:04,606
Shall I read it or not?

2038
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:11,946
Read it later

2039
01:38:12,453 --> 01:38:14,512
OK, read it later, Your Honor!

2040
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:16,652
Better not read it, okay?

2041
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:17,549
Yes

2042
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:20,887
Sung Shih-chieh, what do you want?

2043
01:38:21,262 --> 01:38:22,661
Spitting and prosecution

2044
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,258
First, you Shansi Magistrate
for negligence

2045
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:29,231
Someone died a tragic death...

2046
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:30,165
in the area of your jurisdiction and

2047
01:38:30,337 --> 01:38:30,803
you ignored it

2048
01:38:31,839 --> 01:38:34,774
And you Chief Sec for covering up
your sister's murder

2049
01:38:34,942 --> 01:38:36,842
And you Canton Magistrate Ho Yu-ta

2050
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:38,638
for accepting bribes to pervert justice

2051
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:39,909
and for gassing wantonly

2052
01:38:42,149 --> 01:38:43,013
And you too

2053
01:38:43,851 --> 01:38:44,442
Me?

2054
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:47,019
No? You as Inspector General are

2055
01:38:47,187 --> 01:38:48,711
muddle-headed and indulgent
to your subordinates

2056
01:38:48,889 --> 01:38:52,017
Though you're famous for your honesty,

2057
01:38:52,226 --> 01:38:54,194
you've aroused much complaint

2058
01:38:54,828 --> 01:38:57,353
If this is brought to the Court,

2059
01:38:57,965 --> 01:38:59,796
your whole family will be involved

2060
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:03,035
Counsel Sung is superb!

2061
01:39:14,181 --> 01:39:16,012
Adjourned!

2062
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:19,879
Mrs Sung, feeling good?

2063
01:39:20,054 --> 01:39:20,713
Okay

2064
01:39:21,889 --> 01:39:22,821
Here

2065
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:26,192
Mr Sung, feeling good?

2066
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:28,128
Let me...

2067
01:39:28,429 --> 01:39:29,487
Any other complaint, Mr Sung?

2068
01:39:30,664 --> 01:39:32,291
Your sister is a killer

2069
01:39:32,933 --> 01:39:34,730
She's no good to live

2070
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:35,766
Chop her dead

2071
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:36,728
Are you serious?

2072
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:37,733
Yes

2073
01:39:38,472 --> 01:39:40,531
Mr Sung, what about us?

2074
01:39:40,774 --> 01:39:41,468
What about us?

2075
01:39:43,377 --> 01:39:45,038
Mr Sung, what about us?

2076
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:46,641
Chop you all!

2077
01:39:48,048 --> 01:39:48,537
Mr Sung!

2078
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:50,445
You stand so high

2079
01:39:50,617 --> 01:39:52,847
How can I hear you?

2080
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:57,052
Mr Sung, you've been reinstated

2081
01:39:57,224 --> 01:39:59,556
And we don't deserve death, do we?

2082
01:39:59,727 --> 01:40:00,022
Right...

2083
01:40:00,194 --> 01:40:01,559
Why ask me? I don't know

2084
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:03,856
Ask His Honor!

2085
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:05,798
Your Honor!

2086
01:40:07,101 --> 01:40:08,432
Discharged pending investigation?

2087
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:09,226
Yes...

2088
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:10,766
Please

2089
01:40:11,105 --> 01:40:13,039
Thank you

2090
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,138
As to myself...

2091
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:15,839
Go on

2092
01:40:16,377 --> 01:40:17,503
Everything must proceed
according to rule

2093
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:20,913
Here's an ideal position. Come...

2094
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:26,118
What do you think I should do, Mr Sung?

2095
01:40:27,955 --> 01:40:29,115
You've fully observed the rules

2096
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:30,051
So nice!

2097
01:40:30,224 --> 01:40:30,588
Yes!

2098
01:40:30,758 --> 01:40:31,656
I won't sue you

2099
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:40,191
Let's go

2100
01:40:49,343 --> 01:40:50,742
Darling, who are they?

2101
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:52,834
Mandarins!

2102
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:55,140
Oh, mandarins!

2103
01:40:57,918 --> 01:40:59,215
Superb!

2104
01:41:11,331 --> 01:41:13,856
Darling,

2105
01:41:14,034 --> 01:41:16,662
you helped Yang solve the case

2106
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:19,398
Now you needn't worry
about children without birds

2107
01:41:20,374 --> 01:41:22,808
Now I resent too many kids with birds

2108
01:41:25,946 --> 01:41:26,970
Come...

2109
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:29,172
Come over...

2110
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:30,580
Bow to the brothers!

2111
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:31,612
Come!

2112
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:32,911
Hurry up!

2113
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:33,644
Be nice!

2114
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:36,546
Hold it!

2115
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:39,350
What's wrong?

2116
01:41:39,526 --> 01:41:41,118
The feng shui seems to have moved

2117
01:41:42,529 --> 01:41:43,325
Where?

2118
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:44,628
Over there

2119
01:41:45,299 --> 01:41:46,129
Better...

2120
01:41:46,867 --> 01:41:47,424
Okay

2121
01:41:50,504 --> 01:41:51,198
Are you ready?

2122
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:52,333
Yes

2123
01:41:52,606 --> 01:41:53,334
Turn!

2124
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:55,335
Turn!
