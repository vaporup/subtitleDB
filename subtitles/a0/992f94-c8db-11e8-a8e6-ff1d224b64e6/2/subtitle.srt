1
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,870
Let's go and catch some dragonflies
and butterflies!

2
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,770
Tomorrow...

3
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,571
take him to the fields...

4
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,040
to work, will be good.

5
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,600
Ah Niu.

6
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:20,111
Ah Niu, Ah Niu, Ah Niu...

7
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:22,241
Follow me, follow me.

8
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:24,660
C'mon! Follow me.

9
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,520
The work you did was for nothing.

10
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:32,511
Aunt Yue Ci won't let us say anything,
but she's helping you redo it.

11
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,900
Seedlings have life too.

12
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:56,051
They can't stay too close...

13
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,770
or it will hinder growth.

14
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:00,410
Just like people.

15
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,560
In life, we must respect each other...

16
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,421
that way we can live peacefully and happily.

17
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:09,651
I'll remember that.

18
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:04,870
Grandma, let's eat!

19
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:06,031
Ok.

20
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:14,160
Grandma!

21
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,941
Yue Ci.

22
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,631
Grandma.

23
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,430
In a couple of days,
it will be time to go to the cemetery.

24
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:22,281
Go to the gravesite...

25
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,051
to visit your parents.

26
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,941
Ok

27
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,071
Grandma said, in a couple of days
I should go and visit my parent's graves.

28
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:20,261
Drink some water.

29
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,111
I would like to discuss something with you.

30
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,480
You're leaving.

31
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,171
I would like to go back...

32
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,520
to visit my parent's graves.

33
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:46,191
Filial piety is important, you should go.

34
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,491
I will come back.

35
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:35,171
You're been here for many years now.

36
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:39,600
I've always known
that you would leave this place one day.

37
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,941
Actually I...

38
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,961
This is a change of clothes for your journey.
Please take them.

39
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:02,971
I haven't told you my name yet.

40
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:07,100
You don't have to tell me...

41
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,100
where you came from, or where you're going

42
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,761
I don't have to know either.

43
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,620
I just need to know you as Ah Niu.

44
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,421
My name is Huo Yuan Jia.

45
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:06,540
I'll remember it.

46
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:57,480
"1907, Tian Jin"

47
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:27,461
- Here's something good to eat!
- Here's something good to eat!

48
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,691
Money. Money

49
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,560
The Word of God is truth!

50
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:35,961
Believe in God and get eternal life!

51
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,671
Really, it's true!

52
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:39,841
Trust in the Lord and get eternal life!

53
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,430
All his words are in here!

54
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:44,631
God's words are here!

55
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,980
Huo Yuan Jia!

56
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:15,071
No. 1 in Tian Jin!

57
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,631
Huo Yuan Jia!

58
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,691
No. 1 in Tian Jin!

59
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,671
Huo Yuan Jia!

60
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,730
Huo Yuan Jia!

61
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,700
He came back!

62
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:30,640
Huo Yuan Jia has come back
to fight in the arenas again!

63
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:17,591
- Master...
- Uncle Lai Fu

64
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:19,031
You're back!

65
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,241
Good! Let me carry this.

66
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:56,671
Sorry, I failed in my duties
in taking care of your family assets.

67
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,961
Master, I'm so sorry.

68
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,140
I was always looking to the day
when you would return.

69
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:29,631
Nothing has changed in this room.

70
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,591
It's been hard for you.

71
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,810
It's my duty.

72
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,211
Master!

73
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:41,950
After you left,
the creditors came here everyday to collect.

74
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,000
All the things in the house,
were taken by them, one by one.

75
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,980
In the end,
they even wanted the house to pay off the debt.

76
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,211
All of the things in this room were kept intact...

77
00:14:57,841 --> 00:15:01,790
only because someone
sent a package of money to us.

78
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,241
After much thought,

79
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:08,750
I believe the person who did that was Master Nong.

80
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,571
I don't need them any more.

81
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:30,180
I don't think my parents
want to see them again either.

82
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:34,910
Honourable Father...

83
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:40,761
Only now do I realize, that year on the stage...

84
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:45,160
why you didn't deliver the final blow.

85
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:49,930
You, are the real number one in Tian Jin.

86
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,401
Honourable Mother...

87
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:56,271
You taught me moral values,

88
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,841
but your son was too foolish to understand.

89
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't worry...

90
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,021
I will not disappoint you again.

91
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,961
My child...

92
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,500
I didn't take good care of you
while you were alive,

93
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:24,660
but instead brought great misfortune upon you.

94
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:28,540
I wasn't a good father.

95
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:55,311
Madam, in the past I wronged Master Qin.

96
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:59,131
Today I've come to pay my respects to him.

97
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,940
Mummy, mummy...

98
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,530
Extra! Extra!

99
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,551
A strong foreigner, O'Brien,
has swept the fighting scene in Asia...

100
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,650
with thirty two consecutive wins!

101
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,261
Twenty five challengers were seriously injured!

102
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,900
He scorns the Chinese calling them
"Sick Men of Asia!"

103
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,761
No one dares challenge him!

104
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,221
Jing Sun.

105
00:17:58,551 --> 00:18:00,250
I've done you wrong.

106
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,221
There are many things that, only after the fact,

107
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,900
does one realize that they were wrong.

108
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,490
The wrong pains my heart.

109
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,280
I don't want to mention the past again.

110
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,551
It's all over.

111
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:23,250
Jing Sun...

112
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,650
It's hard for me to ask...

113
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,591
but you're my only hope.

114
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,530
I need to borrow some money.

115
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:32,290
Still going to fight in the arena?

116
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,561
Yes.

117
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:37,761
We are no longer friends...

118
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:40,190
why should I lend you money?

119
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,211
Master.

120
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:31,971
Mr. Huo,

121
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:34,641
this is a gift from my master.

122
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,021
Who is your master?

123
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,860
He's Nong Jing Sun.

The person appearing before you today...

127
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,830
can single-handedly move a train,

128
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,360
with a single blow,
can punch a hole through the Great Wall of China

129
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,950
What baloney!

130
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:23,120
With his little finger,
he can squeeze to death any Chinese fighter!

131
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,731
Introducing, the strongest man you've ever seen...

132
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:31,101
O'Brien!

133
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,150
The challenger today...

134
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:01,671
Huo Yuan Jia from Tian Jin!

135
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:08,641
Good!

136
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:25,870
Sign the agreement first.

137
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,521
Tell him...

138
00:21:29,431 --> 00:21:31,391
fighting to the death...

139
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,580
has been China's bad practice.

140
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,820
But we have another tradition...

141
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:37,950
it is making friends through competition.

142
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,931
Good!

143
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:58,440
Let the competition begin!

144
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:04,040

00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,311
Master, an invitation.

150
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,620
Jing Sun, I didn't expect it would be you.

151
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,870
You still treat me as friend?

152
00:26:33,131 --> 00:26:35,301
There's no way I can forget you, my friend.

153
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:37,580
No way!

154
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,921
Come, have a seat, Yuan Jia.

155
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:46,360
I've ordered your favourite wine.

156
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:49,740
Come!

157
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,280
What's the matter?

158
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:52,641
I've quit drinking.

159
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:53,940
It's been many years now.

160
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:56,240
You liked to drink in the past.

161
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,990
I've quit to right some of the wrongs I've done.

162
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,681
Good!

163
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:05,820
Then, we'll use tea instead of wine.

164
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,851
Yuan Jia...

165
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:19,660
your fight has regained the self-esteem
of our countrymen.

166
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,421
The Westerners have forced us into this position.

167
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,250
And there should be a Chinese person
that will stand for us!

168
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,961
As a friend...

169
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,311
I'm really happy for you!

170
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,181
Please try some.

171
00:27:38,931 --> 00:27:39,891
Jing Sun...

172
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:42,101
When are you leaving?

173
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,790
Since I've come, I'm not leaving.

174
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,690
What about your restaurant?

175
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:50,330
I sold it.

176
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,950
Sold it!

177
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:54,040
Business was good, wasn't it?

178
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:56,410
You want to start the Jing Wu School.

179
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,190
Without money how are you going to do it?

180
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,820
But the restaurant was your life!

181
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,940
Compared to what you are doing...

182
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,461
my little restaurant business isn't much.

183
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,110
Yuan Jia...

184
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:12,771
I'm not a martial artist.

185
00:28:13,731 --> 00:28:18,120
I can only contribute a little...

186
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,500
to help you succeed.

187
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,521
As per our discussion, here are the regulations.

188
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:32,551
Please see if it is okay.

189
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,181
Jing Wu School has three ideals:

190
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:41,721
Educate the body, the mind and morals.

191
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,540
Martial arts is a method to become stronger.

192
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,700
No matter what style or school...

193
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,660
by interacting with one another
to understand the essence.

194
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,131
With a strong body and a clear mind...

195
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,040
people can renew and strengthen themselves.

196
00:28:57,551 --> 00:29:00,921
Never harm your fellow man.

197
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,471
Do not abuse martial arts.

198
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:05,690
Virtue and morality are the core ideals.

199
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,021
Constantly strive to become stronger!

200
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,091
"1910, Founding of the Jing Wu School"

201
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:18,700
"Shanghai Foreign Traders Association"

202
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:42,250
Yuan Jia.

203
00:30:43,881 --> 00:30:44,990
Among the competitors,

204
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,811
there is a Japanese man, Tanaka Yasuno.

205
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,660
He would like to meet you.

206
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:54,000
I heard that he is the best of the best.

207
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,780
We can only learn if we spar with the best.

208
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:02,021
Yuan Jia,
this competition organized by the foreigners...

209
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:04,021
I smell a rat.

210
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:06,931
Why are they making you fight
four people consecutively?

211
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,101
I think they're trying to use this
to humiliate us.

212
00:31:11,851 --> 00:31:15,481
And to make the Jing Wu School
lose standing in Shanghai.

213
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:18,881
Yes

214
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,870
I have to fight all four
and I have to win every single match.

215
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,080
It isn't fair at all.

216
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:27,961
But in life...

217
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:31,711
who can guarantee that everything will be fair?

218
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,471
For Jing Wu School...

219
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:39,450
I have no other option.

220
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,981
But if...

221
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,171
Jing Sun.

222
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:45,881
I need to discuss something with you...

223
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:47,700
What is it?

224
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,690
After this match,

225
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:51,721
I want you to be the next president.

226
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:53,540
Why?

227
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,700
I want to go back and visit Yue Chi
and her Grandma.

228
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:00,311
I promised them.

229
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:14,811
So, you really don't know anything
about the art of tea?

230
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:19,431
It's not that I don't understand,
I'm just unwilling to understand.

231
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,211
I don't want to categorize tea.

232
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:24,790
As long as it's tea it's fine with me.

233
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,221
But tea also has different levels
of quality and grade.

234
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:34,171
What is good? What is bad?

235
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,101
They all grow in nature.

236
00:32:38,631 --> 00:32:40,000
There is no good and bad.

237
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,801
It seems you still don't understand.

238
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:44,690
Otherwise, you would realize
which one is good and which is bad.

239
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,631
You're right.

240
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,780
My belief is that...

241
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,690
the quality of the tea...

242
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:53,301
is not determined by the tea itself.

243
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,381
It's decided by man.

244
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:58,000
Different people have different tastes.

245
00:32:58,421 --> 00:33:00,200
I'm unwilling to make this choice.

246
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:03,141
Oh, why?

247
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:05,320
Enjoying tea or not depends on your mood.

248
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:07,591
If you're happy...

249
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:10,481
is the quality of the tea that important?

250
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:13,311
I've never thought of it this way.

251
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:17,061
In your opinion,
there are many schools and styles of martial arts.

252
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:21,040
None are of themselves superior or inferior?

253
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:23,421
That is my belief, yes.

254
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,950
Then, I would like to ask you,

255
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:31,801
since there are no
superior or inferior martial arts.

256
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,120
Why do we still seek
improvement through competition?

257
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:38,870
I believe that there really is no
superior or inferior martial arts.

258
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:42,311
The difference lies
in the ability of the practitioner.

259
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:45,011
Through competition we can discover...

260
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,240
and get to know, our true self.

261
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:49,360
Because our real opponent...

262
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,450
may still be ourselves.

263
00:33:51,841 --> 00:33:55,761
Only through competition,
can we recognize our true self.

264
00:33:56,511 --> 00:34:01,490
You mean the worst battle
is the fight within oneself?

265
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:16,490
Your words have gained my sincere respect.

266
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:20,820
We're here to make friends and appreciate the tea.

267
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:23,950
Let's skip all the talk about the tea...

268
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,080
and taste the tea.

269
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,610
Let's taste.

270
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:37,091
"1910, Shanghai"

271
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:44,330
"Theatre Biarya, France Constitution"

272
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:48,591
"Match Venue"

273
00:34:56,271 --> 00:34:57,290
Ladies and gentlemen...

274
00:34:57,601 --> 00:34:59,061
the last fight of the day...

275
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,631
Tanaka Yasuno of Japan vs...

276
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,860
Huo Yuan Jia from the Jing Wu School!

277
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:07,881
What's this all about?

278
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,221
Four against one?

279
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,080
Why didn't you tell me before?

280
00:35:14,591 --> 00:35:17,870
This is what the Trader's Association
and the Jing Wu School agreed upon.

281
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:19,961
You need not be surprised.

282
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,950
You call this a competition?

283
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,231
This is murder.

284
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,690
You worry too much!

285
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:29,620
Huo Yuan Jia has defeated...

286
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,461
the fighting elites from different countries.

287
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,761
This arrangement was his wish.

288
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:36,311
Mita-san.

289
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:39,160
What are you up to?

290
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,610
Is this for the honour of Japan?

291
00:35:42,021 --> 00:35:43,771
Or simply for yourself?

292
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,190
To me, what's really important
is the spirit of martial arts.

293
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:54,490
We compete to win.

294
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,101
Let's begin...

295
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,221
Yuan Jia, my friend.

296
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,131
This competition is unfair to you.

297
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,431
If you choose another day for the fight
I have no objections.

298
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,660
I understand your good intentions.

299
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:27,250
But I am already standing in this arena...

300
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,400
there must be a conclusion.

301
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:30,950
Please!

302
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:49,561
Start!

303
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,091
Great, Master!

304
00:38:47,631 --> 00:38:49,301
This round ends in a draw.

305
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:51,981
Next round will be barehanded.

306
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,461
Both sides please prepare!

307
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,950
Mita! Where have you been?

308
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:01,400
We're going to lose!

309
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:04,381
Don't worry gentlemen. I have it under control.

310
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,981
Yuen Jia!

311
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,981
Stop!

312
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:18,620
- What happened?
- What are you doing Tanaka!?

313
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:23,490
Yuan Jia!

314
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,070
- Tanaka!
- Go now, go!

315
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,721
Yuan Jia, what happened?

316
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:35,261
How are you?

317
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,820
- I've been poisoned.
- Poisoned!?

318
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,521
How?

319
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,830
What happened?

320
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:44,021
- What are you doing?
- Water!

321
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:45,500
Water?

322
00:40:45,721 --> 00:40:47,301
What happened to the water?

323
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:49,500
The water must've been poisoned!

324
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,870
The proof has been taken way!

325
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,551
Yuan Jia, let's go to a hospital!

326
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,641
Master, we'll take you to a hospital!

327
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:56,921
I've used too much strength.

328
00:40:57,301 --> 00:40:59,110
The poison has already spread. It's too late.

329
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:02,080
Master, I will avenge you!

330
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:06,280
Zhen Sheng!

331
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,891
You shouldn't talk of revenge.

332
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,620
Hatred will beget more hatred.

333
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:22,771
I don't want to see any enmity.

334
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:27,801
The most important thing
is to strengthen yourself.

335
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,351
- Yuan Jia!
- Master

336
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,211
Yuan Jia, let's stop the fight!

337
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,780
- I'll take you to a hospital, let's go
- Jing Sun!

338
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,320
Jing Sun!

339
00:41:39,971 --> 00:41:42,341
I'm just a fighter...

340
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:48,221
It took me many years to understand
what martial arts really is.

341
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:52,091
And what I can accomplish with it.

342
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,761
This competition isn't finished.

343
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:59,891
People can't choose how their lives begin.

344
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:05,540
But they must have the courage
to walk till their last step.

345
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,580
Master...

346
00:42:13,471 --> 00:42:15,610
Tanaka! What's wrong with you?
Hurry up and finish him!

347
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,610
What do you mean?

348
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,141
You need not ask.

349
00:42:19,511 --> 00:42:22,171
I must win this fight! Regardless of the means!

350
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,021
Constantly strive to become stronger!

351
00:42:33,391 --> 00:42:35,061
Constantly strive to become stronger!

352
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,351
Constantly strive to become stronger!

353
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:42,271
Constantly strive to become stronger...

354
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,040
Just watch...

355
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:06,891
Don't fight!

356
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,610
Living on is more important than anything else!

357
00:43:12,471 --> 00:43:16,750
Listen,
living is never a single person's own affair.

358
00:43:23,011 --> 00:43:27,431
If we must fight, I will not hold back.

359
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,940
That would be my honour.

360
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,211
Master...

361
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,070
You lose! Huo Yuan Jia lost!

362
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:39,910
Go! Go! Faster!

363
00:45:40,311 --> 00:45:42,860
Go, go, make the announcement!

364
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,351
Wait a minute!

365
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:15,410
Huo!

366
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,740
Yuan!

367
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,080
Jia!

368
00:46:19,221 --> 00:46:22,181
- Huo Yuan Jia...
- Huo Yuan Jia...

369
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,721
Tanaka! You useless trash!

370
00:46:43,141 --> 00:46:43,900
Look what you've done!

371
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:44,981
I lost!

372
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,030
Who says that? Who?

373
00:46:47,481 --> 00:46:49,410
I understood deep within me.

374
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,040
I was beaten convincingly.

375
00:46:51,381 --> 00:46:53,051
Who do you think you are?

376
00:46:53,351 --> 00:46:56,601
How can you decide on your own?
Are you fit to be Japanese!?

377
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,631
You!

378
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:09,171
You shame the Japanese!

379
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:21,450
"Huo Yuan Jia passed away after he reached
the hospital. He was 42"

380
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,490
"After he died,
his spirit in martial arts continued"

381
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,761
"Even today,
the Jing Wu School has opened various branches...

382
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,740
in over fifty countries
and territories all over the world"
