1
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:24,410
At the end of the Qing dynasty, the lands of China
were dominated by foreign powers.

2
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:28,960
Unable to fight back,
the Chinese were branded as "Sick Men of Asia"

3
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,980
It seemed that no one could stand against it.

4
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,020
To further trample the pride of the Chinese...

5
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,590
The Shanghai Foreign Business Association
organized a fight,

6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,020
pitting four experts from different countries
to challenge the Chinese people.

7
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,690
This time, one man
stood up against the challenge...

8
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,879
and he was Huo Yuan Jia.

9
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,579
"1910, Shanghai"

10
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,200
"Theatre Biarya, French Constitution"

11
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,730
"Match Venue"

12
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,600
Ladies and gentlemen...

13
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:50,840
Our four challengers are from
the Shanghai Business Association

14
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:55,269
They will challenge Huo Yuan Jia
from the Jing Wu school.

15
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,049
The outcome of the fight...

16
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:08,880
will be determined by knockout or surrender.

17
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,250
"Boxing Champion, Peter Smith England"

18
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,419
Begin!!

19
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,220
"Royal Knight Instructor, Hans"

20
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,639
"European Fencing Champion, Anthony"

21
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:09,579
And for our final round,
the brilliant Japanese fighter...

22
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,130
Tanaka Yasuno will take on...

23
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,700
Huo Yuan Jia of the Jing Wu School.

24
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,000
"30 years ago, Tian Jin, Huo household"

25
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,700
Young Master!

26
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,940
Come on now, let's go!

27
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:03,510
Stop!

28
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:08,019
How dare you!? Who let you in here?

29
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,269
I came to bring you some tea, Dad.

30
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,190
I've told you many times not to come in here!

31
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,920
Go back to your room and study.

32
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,880
Continue.

33
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,139
You always get me to do your work!

34
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:50,219
Someday, your Dad will find out
and you'll be in trouble!

35
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:57,639
If we don't tell, who's gonna know?

36
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,139
Hey, I want to show you something.

37
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,469
Hurry up, Nong Jing Sun!

38
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,589
I'm coming...

39
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:26,889
Today, Huo En Di from the Huo family...

40
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,260
and Zhao Zhong Qiang from the Zhao family...

41
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:36,619
will fight on this stage
to determine who's the best!

42
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:44,739
What are you two doing? You want to die?

43
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,869
Your dad will lose today.

44
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:48,950
Your dad will taste the Huo Fist.

45
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:50,800
Just wait and see.

46
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,270
The life and death agreement has been signed!

47
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,940
Victory or defeat is decided by men.

48
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,640
Life or death is up to Heaven.

49
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,920
Masters! Begin the competition!

50
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:30,020
Zhao Jian, now your Dad will understand
the power of the Huo Fist!

51
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,790
And the winner is...

52
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,940
Zhao Zhong Qiang!

53
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,099
Thank you! Thanks so much!

54
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:19,670
Yuan Jia!

55
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:21,040
Yuan Jia!

56
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,829
Let's go, Yuan Jia. Yuan Jia!

57
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:36,249
You were so arrogant before.

58
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,759
Look at you now. Got any guts?
Don't just cower like a rat...

59
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,690
Get up!

60
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,719
Zhao Jian, you better not go too far!

61
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,700
Shut up!

62
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,170
You're just stupid. You and your Huo fist!

63
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,390
Spar with me if you dare.

64
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,219
I'll show you the power of our Zhao fist!

65
00:10:57,749 --> 00:10:59,209
On stage, now!

66
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,190
Yuan Jia! Stop fighting!

67
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,160
Now that you've had a taste of the Zhao fist...

68
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:38,609
I don't want to hear about the Huo Fist again!

69
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,030
I won! I won!

70
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,479
Yuan Jia!

71
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,420
Let's go.

72
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,729
I swear...

73
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,109
I will not be beaten here again!

74
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,300
Young Master...

75
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,209
let me apply some medicine...

76
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,489
Lai Fu... You can go now.

77
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:06,770
Yes.

78
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,579
What happened? Why are you angry?

79
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,200
Mum, why won't Dad let me learn martial arts?

80
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,570
Because your dad loves you.

81
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,450
You were born with asthma,
and you have a weak constitution.

82
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,609
You can't stand the strain.

83
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:31,339
Doesn't martial arts make your body stronger?

84
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,430
Are you so keen to learn martial arts...

85
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,089
simply to strengthen your body?

86
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:38,469
No, I want revenge.

87
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,479
I want Zhao Jian to acknowledge
the power of the Huo Fist.

88
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:50,719
My son, the most powerful aspect of martial arts...

89
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,009
is not to defeat others.

90
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,770
It is to curb your thirst for victory.

91
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,040
No matter what,
virtue and morality must not be lost.

92
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:04,680
Martial arts is to strengthen one's body
and to help others.

93
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:08,579
It's not for you to cause trouble
and it's certainly not for revenge.

94
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,200
To get along well with others...

95
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,570
you must respect and treat them nicely.

96
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:18,329
Then others will respect you in return.

97
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,410
If you are good in martial arts,
who dares not to respect you!?

98
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,099
Fear and respect are two different things.

99
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:31,150
Come on, finish it all right?

100
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:34,349
Otherwise, your Father will punish you again.

101
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,410
"Death Fist"

102
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:14,780
I'm the winner!

103
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:18,369
We're flying! We're flying!

104
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:19,780
We're falling! We're falling!

105
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,339
I won't fall down, I won't fall down

106
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,270
Then I'll knock you down...

107
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:33,440
I won't fall down!

108
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:35,780
Come on, again come on!

109
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,290
I won't fall down!

110
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:41,910
Move faster!

111
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,369
Be careful!

112
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:49,540
Good morning, Mum.

113
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,200
Yuen Jia, you forgot
to take your medicine again this morning

114
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,759
Ever since I trained at West Lake...

115
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:59,900
my asthma hasn't relapsed.

116
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,550
Just look at your child...

117
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,790
without a mother since an early age,
you have doted on her too much!

118
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,790
You should marry again,

119
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:12,030
so that someone can help you take good care of her

120
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,709
I have been busy building up our family name.

121
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:20,969
I want everyone here in Tian Jin
to know and respect us!

122
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:23,209
How will I find the time to remarry?

123
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:26,829
You can't get me, I want to go out with you, Dad!

124
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,829
Even though you have remained undefeated
all these years...

125
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:33,479
your biggest obstacle is yourself.

126
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:36,030
And what you really must conquer...

127
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,959
Is also yourself.

128
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,479
I understand.

129
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,570
"Issue of Challenge"

130
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:47,690
Master...

131
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,440
All right.

132
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:56,579
You have a good rest first, Mum.

133
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,940
Dad...

134
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,509
Your fist wasn't fast nor ruthless enough.

135
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,530
But don't you worry with me around.

136
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,249
The Huo's family name won't be defeated again!

137
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,950
"Live and death agreement"

138
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:29,050
I'll definitely become number one in Tian Jin!

139
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,119
Dad!

140
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,140
My little Chui!

141
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,089
For me?

142
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,160
- No, I won't!
- Give it to me, come on.

143
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,450
No, I won't!

144
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,650
Then, what can I do for you
so you'll give it to me?

145
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,890
I will give it to you after you win.

146
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:46,759
Really?

147
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,190
Promise?

148
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,390
"1900, Tian Jin"

149
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,590
Master Huo...

150
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,130
When will you become No. 1 in Tian Jin?

151
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,430
I don't know... What do you think?

152
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,850
Just today! Today!

153
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:38,330
Hey, Zhao Jian!

154
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:40,059
Where have you been hiding all these years?

155
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,350
I've travelled Jiang Nan's 17 provinces
and 38 prefectures.

156
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,769
I've mastered a great deal of Kung Fu.

157
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:47,809
I'm invincible in Jiang Nan now!

158
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:49,959
Bullshit!

159
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,739
You're the bullshitter!

160
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,650
The life and death agreement has been signed!

161
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,840
Let the competition begin!

162
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,779
Come on! Come up!

163
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,289
What? Afraid?

164
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,120
Come up. Come up and fall to your death!

165
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,190
Just you wait!

166
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,100
Well done, Master!

167
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:44,620
My horse-stance is as stable as a mountain
and rooted to the ground!

168
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,840
Today, I will defeat your Huo Fist!

169
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,400
Okay, I'll give you a chance...

170
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,200
...to lose!

171
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,819
Well done, Master!

172
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:24,420
- Pussy claw?
- Tiger Claw!!

173
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,080
Down you go!

174
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:48,830
Well done, Master!

175
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,440
I won't go down just because you say so!

176
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:54,489
- Pussy claw.
- It's Tiger Claw!!!!

177
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:15,559
You've lost!

178
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:36,279
Master!

179
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,430
- You all right?
- I'm fine

180
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,100
What a tough guy!

181
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,729
Don't touch me!

182
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,100
And our winner is...

183
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,569
Huo Yuan Jia!

184
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,170
Well done! You're great, Master!

185
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,400
Thank you! Thank you!

186
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,650
Congratulations, this way.

187
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:08,130
- Good Job, Master Huo!
- Thank you!

188
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,690
We reserved a table for you upstairs Master Huo.

189
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:14,370
Yuan Jia!

190
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,860
Hey, Jing Sun!

191
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:18,870
Why so late?

192
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:20,759
Same old place, come on.

193
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,840
Congratulations, Master Huo!

194
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:27,170
Congratulations, Master Huo!

195
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,209
Hello, everybody!

196
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,239
Come on, now.

197
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:37,969
Jing Sun...

198
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,719
Your business is booming!

199
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:43,120
This is all because of everyone's support!

200
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:45,860
Still remember when we were kids?

201
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,670
You were just a bookworm.

202
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,459
I never expected you to do so well in business!

203
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,219
The economy is bad!

204
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,459
A bookworm like me can only run a business.

205
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,860
I don't have a choice!

206
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,219
Eat up, Yuan Jia!

207
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,160
It took me some effort
to get famous chefs from all over.

208
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,660
Try and see if the local cuisine suits your taste

209
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,840
All right!

210
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:08,009
You first, Master Huo!

211
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:12,160
Who the heck are they?

212
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,420
- My name is Xia Xiang!
- My name is Xu Da Shan!

213
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,380
We sincerely hope
Master Huo will take us on as disciples!

214
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,150
We are willing to do anything for Master!

215
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,410
All right... you look upright enough!

216
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:23,430
Serve the wine!

217
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:27,549
After drinking this cup of wine,
we will be brothers!

218
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,009
Drink it!

219
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,539
Congratulations, Master Huo!

220
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,269
Thank you, Master!

221
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,559
Since today is a joyous occasion,
everything is on me!

222
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,660
All right!

223
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,489
Come on, let's eat up!

224
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,219
Little Chui, don't wait any longer.
It's time to sleep.

225
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,989
Take her to her room.

226
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:56,900
Qing Qing, go back to your room and sleep.

227
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:00,700
My good child, listen to me.
It's time to sleep now!

228
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,390
Come on...

229
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:17,269
What is this!?

230
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:20,269
This is called coffee. It's from the west.

231
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:22,019
Not used to this?

232
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,759
For commoners to improve themselves...

233
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:29,170
they will have to learn modern things from others

234
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:32,580
Just like me, even though I am a scholar
I can't just think about earning money.

235
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,259
And those that study martial arts...

236
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:37,029
shouldn't just keep to the fighting arena.

237
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:38,840
National affairs are important too.

238
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,059
I'm just a fighter.
I just want to be No. 1 in Tian Jin.

239
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:48,549
Is it really that important to be number 1?

240
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:52,209
Hey, come with me...

241
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,660
Jing Sun, you were always
a spectator below the stage.

242
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,660
Now that you're up on the stage...

243
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:00,420
do you feel any different?

244
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,390
What's the difference?

245
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:06,630
Below the stage...

246
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,479
the life and death struggle on stage
has nothing to do with you.

247
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,569
You're just watching for fun.

248
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,469
But once you stand here...

249
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,890
you must win at all costs and never lose.

250
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,370
Well then, you can choose not to go on the stage.

251
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:24,420
Jing Sun, listen...

252
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,069
Listen to what?

253
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:30,979
I can't hear anything.

254
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:37,479
I can hear it...

255
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:40,080
You're a hero, Master Huo!

256
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,539
Good job! Well done!

257
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:47,969
Master Huo, greatest in the world!

258
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,420
Iron head technique!

259
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:38,509
Thank you!

260
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,739
You're great, Master!

261
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,330
Let's save all the trouble...

262
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,940
whoever signed the agreement can come all at once!

263
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:50,959
All of the challengers, up on stage! Now!

264
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,819
Huo Yuan Jia...

265
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,519
When will you become No. 1 in Tian Jin?

266
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:43,160
And what do you think?

267
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,319
Well, today! It's gonna be today!

268
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,880
What the heck are you all doing?

269
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:06,819
We want to be Master Huo's disciples,
and will do anything for Master Huo!

270
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,840
All right, all right! You are all good men!

271
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,930
Serve the wine!

272
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,729
After this cup of wine, we will all be brothers!

273
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,380
Come on, drink it!

274
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,160
Come on now!

275
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,700
Congratulations, Master Huo!

276
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:30,880
Thank you, welcome!

277
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:37,989
Boss, all of these bills are for Master Huo.

278
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:42,090
All right...

279
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:44,840
Come on, drink up!

280
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,729
Come on! Drink!

281
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,959
Get a bigger jar! Why didn't you drink it?

282
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,080
You have yet to defeat my step-father,
Master Qin!

283
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,680
Come on, drink it!

284
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,729
Yuen Jia,
you have already won 38 rounds consecutively...

285
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:07,729
You have no more opponents in Tian Jin!

286
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,080
That's not right. There's still one left.

287
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:18,019
Do you still have to fight?

288
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:23,869
In order to be
the undisputed champion in Tian Jin...

289
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:25,018
I have to keep fighting.

290
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,709
What about areas beyond Tian Jin?

291
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,499
The capital, Liang Guang, Shan Xi and Hunan.

292
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,180
How long will you keep fighting?

293
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,719
Do you think I don't understand
what you've just said?

294
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:40,870
But I can't stop! I have to keep on fighting!

295
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:43,709
Through fighting I can prove
that I'm stronger than them!

296
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:45,709
So what?

297
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,489
Yuan Jia...

298
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,489
You should stop for a moment,
and think things through carefully.

299
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,450
What is this?

300
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,019
These are the bills your disciples and friends
have spent this month!

301
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,489
I'll cover that.

302
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:05,809
They are just a bunch of useless thugs!

303
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:08,749
How many of them
really treat you as their brother?

304
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,620
This is the way things are in this circle.
It is what we call righteousness.

305
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,630
And this righteousness...

306
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:15,640
Fine.

307
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,249
I'll get someone to send you the money tomorrow.

308
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:20,249
Yuan Jia...

309
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,424
I didn't come here for money.

310
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,150
While accepting disciples and friends...

311
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,400
You should look at their moral qualities.

312
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:29,799
Not just how well they can drink!

313
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:41,600
Watch your step, Master Huo.

314
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:45,969
Good morning, Master Huo!

315
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,519
Good morning, Master Huo!

316
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:50,559
Good morning, Master Qin!

317
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,749
Aren't you Master Huo,
the self-proclaimed No. 1 in Tian Jin?

318
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,049
What a coincidence...

319
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,969
Master Qin. Long time, no see!

320
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:12,630
I thought you had aged and gone back to
your hometown to spend your last years.

321
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,299
The fact that so many people
are coming to me to be my disciple...

322
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:19,549
is something I can't help.

323
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,049
Oh, really?

324
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,959
And you prepared such a large gift for yourself!

325
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,779
Congratulations!

326
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,719
Thank you!

327
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,690
This large present was actually bought for you.

328
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,559
Go help your Master!

329
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,340
Welcome, Master Qin!

330
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:47,309
Master!

331
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,209
Never mind that your income is not enough
even for the family...

332
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,769
the bills from your disciples have been mounting.

333
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,759
What about our family assets?

334
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,630
They were used up three months ago.

335
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:05,620
Nothing left?

336
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:07,620
Nothing left?

337
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,850
Master!

338
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:17,269
Fine, Fine. I told everyone to train properly...

339
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,170
but no one listens to me.

340
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,600
Who's responsible?

341
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,420
Master Qin!

342
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,860
Master!

343
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:39,209
Master!

344
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:47,999
Today is Master Qin's birthday!

345
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:53,019
We wish Master Qin a long life!

346
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:54,870
Well done!

347
00:32:56,469 --> 00:32:57,729
Father!

348
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,870
I sincerely wish you a long life!

349
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:03,150
Good!

350
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:25,660
Master Huo, today is my step-father's birthday.

351
00:33:26,229 --> 00:33:27,719
He has booked the whole restaurant.

352
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:31,410
If you came for a drink
could you kindly go somewhere else?

353
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,309
Please, Master Huo.

354
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,340
You aren't qualified to speak here!

355
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:42,170
Hey!

356
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,350
Today is my birthday.

357
00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:49,029
I don't want to fight, if there's a problem,
let's discuss it another day.

358
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,729
As an elder...

359
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,249
You have no shame hurting my disciple!

360
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:00,930
I'm coming for justice today!

361
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,309
And what do you want?

362
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:07,549
I've already signed, if you have any guts,
put your name down!

363
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,569
Otherwise, bow down and apologize to me!

364
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:14,600
Excuse me! Yuan Jia!

365
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,710
You're too much!

366
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,629
Master Qin's guests are present.
Can't you discuss this some other day?

367
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,870
I can't stand by, while my disciple is insulted!

368
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,870
No matter what...

369
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,939
I won't allow you to cause trouble,
when people are celebrating a birthday here!

370
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,649
- I'm causing trouble?
- Yuan Jia!

371
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:36,779
You're just afraid
that I might destroy your restaurant!

372
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,009
I, Huo Yuan Jia will pay for all the damage!

373
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:47,160
I can't believe what you just said!

374
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:49,689
Leave now!

375
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,980
Consider our friendship for all these years over!

376
00:34:55,319 --> 00:35:00,359
We've been friends for years,

377
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:04,700
and you're throwing it away?

378
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,430
The blade is blind...

379
00:35:08,669 --> 00:35:10,219
All of you, get out!

380
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,989
To avoid hurting the innocent!

381
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,450
Come on, let's get out!

382
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:15,700
Master!

383
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,500
Master won again!

384
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,140
Let's go and have a drink!

385
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,520
Drink till we drop!

386
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:41,379
Careful!

387
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,910
Let me toast to you!

388
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,460
Come on, another one!

389
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:12,609
Master is invincible!

390
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,410
He's invincible! Just look at him!

391
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,589
Master Huo!

392
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:50,319
Congratulations!

393
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,750
You've achieved your dream
of becoming the number one in Tian Jin!

394
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:56,930
But let me tell you...

395
00:41:57,339 --> 00:41:58,569
Four hours ago...

396
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,489
Master Qin died.

397
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,060
Huo Yuan Jia!

398
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:23,419
When will you become number one in Tian Jin?

399
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:28,419
Well, it's today!

400
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,730
It's today!

401
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:32,779
Huo Yuan Jia!

402
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,259
Well, it's today!

403
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:37,779
Well, it's today!

404
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:39,299
Huo Yuan Jia!

405
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,540
Number one in Tian Jin!

406
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,020
It's today!

407
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,520
I'm the one that killed your family!

408
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:03,460
I'll take full responsibility for my actions!

409
00:45:04,689 --> 00:45:06,390
Take care of yourself, Mother.

410
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,210
Tell the master what you've done!

411
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,379
- Tell him!
- Master!

412
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,160
I'm so sorry... It's all my fault!

413
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:09,770
I had an affair with Master Qin's daughter.

414
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,029
That's why Master Qin punished me.

415
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:15,230
Master!

416
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:19,899
All the others knew about it...

417
00:46:20,439 --> 00:46:23,509
I thought they would have told you about it!

418
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,160
Master!

419
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:28,569
Master!

420
00:46:29,379 --> 00:46:32,399
Master!

421
00:48:02,669 --> 00:48:04,750
He's got a fever!

422
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,730
I'll go and make some medicine.

423
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,980
After he takes it and sweats it out,
he will be fine.

424
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:10,989
He will be fine. He will be fine.

425
00:48:14,379 --> 00:48:16,129
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go!

426
00:48:16,919 --> 00:48:18,790
He needs to rest, go, go!

427
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:34,140
When I was 13 years old...

428
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:36,480
my vision started to deteriorate.

429
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,710
In my eyes,
there seemed to be a fog that could not be lifted

430
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:43,560
I cried every day.

431
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:46,140
Grandma told me...

432
00:49:46,509 --> 00:49:48,910
when you're feeling unhappy you should cry.

433
00:49:49,379 --> 00:49:53,040
After that, you need to move on.

434
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:56,120
But in my heart, I can see things clearly.

435
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,859
Do you believe that?

436
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:18,839
I'll help you wash your hair.

437
00:51:01,279 --> 00:51:03,710
After some time, your hair gets tangled easily.

438
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,950
Wash it often and it will stay smooth and clean.

439
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:09,899
Grandma always says,

440
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,950
people should always keep clean

441
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,890
only then can you walk with ease in this world.

442
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:19,620
There aren't many knots that can't be undone.

443
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,730
Ah Niu!

444
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,430
Ah Niu, you can sleep a lot!
You sleep as much as our cow!

445
00:52:12,089 --> 00:52:13,489
So I called you Ah Niu. (Niu=Cow)

446
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,950
Come, come, come, follow me!

447
00:52:21,759 --> 00:52:23,069
Ah Niu, are you awake?
