1
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:24,012
Here you go,my friend.

2
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:26,812
Make sure you go
as close as you can,

3
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:29,807
Ill get you something extra
if you make it a good trip.

4
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:32,298
Im going to get you close,
my friend.

5
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,755
But not too close.
You know what I mean?

6
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:38,026
Are you ready?

7
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:39,365
- Ready!
- Ready!

8
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:46,402
1, 2, 3!

9
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:11,542
Are you scared?

10
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:13,077
This is great!

11
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:26,207
You see anything yet?

12
00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:28,960
No... Not yet.

13
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:58,145
what was that?

14
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,203
I dont know.

15
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:05,167
- Hold on.
- whats happening?

16
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:06,361
Hold on.

17
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,722
Make it stop.

18
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,047
what happen to them?

19
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:16,639
I dont know.

20
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,527
- were gonna crash.
- No, we are not.

21
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:23,085
were gonna crash.

22
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:24,812
Im going to take this tools.

23
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:27,361
Let go the rope.
Let go the rope!

24
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,122
Move your hands.

25
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:33,281
Come on. Keep...

26
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:36,401
Let go!

27
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:48,001
Its gonna be okay.

28
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:08,972
Actually Charlie that doesnt hurt.

29
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,927
They wont really be fighting each other.

30
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:12,812
But these one here are Corythosaurus.

31
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:14,412
They really like fighting
with each other.

32
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:18,565
They use their teeth and their claws
to rip each others jaws out.

33
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,919
Alan, hes three.
Let`ss wait until he is five.

34
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:24,240
Right. Sorry, Charlie.

35
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:26,027
- Ellie.
- Yes.

36
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:27,012
Its Tom again.

37
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:28,932
He says he has to talk
to you about the last chapter.

38
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,276
Just tell him I am not gonna to
lose the Jack Corner Club.

39
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:38,320
Hey, look whos here?

40
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:40,916
This is Alan.

41
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:43,287
Nice to meet you, Alan.

42
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:44,012
Daddy.

43
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:47,607
This is Hylaeosaurus.
Thats the dinosaur man.

44
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:49,165
Dinosaur man?

45
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:52,727
Jack, say my name.
Is my name Alan?

46
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:55,002
Is my name Alan?

47
00:04:58,087 --> 00:04:59,566
He used to know me.

48
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,405
Here you go.

49
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:05,118
Thanks.

50
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:07,567
So you know Mark is going to
work with the State Department now.

51
00:05:07,602 --> 00:05:08,932
what do you do, Mark?

52
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:11,247
Its international relation most.

53
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:12,760
Somethings like that.

54
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:17,639
Ill get her.

55
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,717
You guys...
You guys have a little chat.

56
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:24,796
Hes a great guy.

57
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:27,927
So what are you working on now?

58
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:29,702
Raptors mostly.

59
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:31,443
My favourite.

60
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:33,798
Do you remember the sounds
they made?

61
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:36,036
I try not.

62
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:37,092
Ellie,

63
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:38,967
all the theories are about
raptors intelligence,

64
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,567
what are they capable of?

65
00:05:40,602 --> 00:05:42,167
we work even close.

66
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:42,652
Tell me.

67
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,852
we did plenty of scan
on the raptors skeleton.

68
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:48,367
we find out it looks like a very
sophisticated resonating chamber.

69
00:05:48,402 --> 00:05:50,084
wait a second.
So we were right?

70
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,732
I mean they had even living vocalise.

71
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,867
Im convince they had the
key of social intelligence.

72
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:55,967
which explains why they work
together as a team.

73
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:57,132
And co-ordinate they attacks.

74
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,927
And they probably know
what is going on.

75
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:00,684
They could talk to each other.

76
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,407
To agree, we could never imagine.

77
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:04,892
Ellie, they were smart.

78
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,607
They were smarter than
dolphins or whales.

79
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:10,405
They were smarter than primates.

80
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,527
I just want to say Ill be ready
to help with anything.

81
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:23,287
Someday if you want to ask,
you can call me.

82
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:25,207
Anything. Anytime.

83
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:26,799
Sure.

84
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:32,807
Youre still the best.

85
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:34,684
I mean it.

86
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:38,159
The last in my breed.

87
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:48,367
So the basic study about the
interior chamber,

88
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:50,252
and most of these specimens.

89
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,607
They begin to determine
the exciting color relation

90
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:55,007
between the upper-pales
and the leerings.

91
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:59,172
This lead us theorise the raptors.

92
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:01,892
which are capable of
sophisticated vocalizations

93
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:05,247
which were had been
tremendous evolutionary advantange.

94
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:06,692
Raptors were fierce,

95
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,612
intelligent and
socially sophisticated.

96
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:13,167
They were able to hunt in numbers
and co-ordinate their efforts.

97
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:16,724
with the catadysmic advance
which overtook them

98
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,212
its entirely possible
that raptors or humans

99
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:24,160
whether to become a dominant
species on this planet.

100
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,812
I hope this has been interest.

101
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:29,367
It certainly excites us
as its intelligence.

102
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:32,852
There is much more to discover.

103
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:37,039
That is why we continue to
need and ask for your support.

104
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:42,686
Thank you.

105
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:53,962
Thank you very much,
Dr Grant.

106
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:56,476
Now,
does anyone have a question?

107
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:00,212
Fine.

108
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:04,081
Does anyone have a question that
is not related to Jurrasic Park?

109
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:11,320
All the incident in San Diego
which I did not witness.

110
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:15,206
Yes, sir.

111
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:19,840
Your theory on raptors is good.
But isnt it a conjecture kind of mood?

112
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:22,687
I mean once the UN in Costa Rica
and everyone decides

113
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:24,292
how to handle that second island,

114
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:26,795
scientists will just go in
and look for themselves.

115
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:30,812
Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.

116
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:34,647
what is left of them is
fossilise in the rocks.

117
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,892
And this in the rock,

118
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:38,812
that real scientists make
real discovery.

119
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:42,527
Now what John Hammand and
Ingen in the Jurassic Park

120
00:08:42,562 --> 00:08:46,207
is created genetically engineered
theme park monsters.

121
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:48,572
Nothing more and nothing less.

122
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:53,247
Are you saying that you dont want
to get to Isla Sorna and study them

123
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,212
if you have the chance?

124
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:57,045
No force on earth or heaven.

125
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:59,158
Forget beyond that island.

126
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,286
So what we got here?

127
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:15,647
20 million gas operator
sending out in a minute.

128
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:16,852
Gunship, magazine, third routine

129
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:18,878
and both our clothes cope with
reducing muscles...

130
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:29,366
Here, Udesky.

131
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,207
Yes, sir.
we are going to get here.

132
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:36,567
The matter of fact is
you knock things down

133
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:38,797
as soon as you bought me
that thing.

134
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:42,732
well, thats right.

135
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:46,282
There are two of the best
man that I would find.

136
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,807
No, sir.
Ive not worked with them personally.

137
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:51,692
But believe me, sir.

138
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:55,037
These men come very
highly recommended.

139
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,641
Nothing to worry about, sir.

140
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:07,516
Its going to be walk in park.

141
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:17,812
Billy,

142
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:19,838
I dont think that
I`mm doing this right.

143
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:28,921
Lets try to do first.

144
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,519
You got to do this slowly.

145
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:36,998
Itll just take a little bit of time.

146
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:40,119
I can never tell whats rock
and what`ss bone.

147
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,692
Technically its all rock.

148
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:44,927
But calcium in the bones
replace during fossilisation.

149
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:47,999
You can feel the difference, see.

150
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:54,686
Rough... smooth...

151
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:02,675
Dr Grant!

152
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,201
Mr Brennan.

153
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:07,437
So how did it go?

154
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:10,844
Its not too late to change
your major, Billy!

155
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:15,640
worse,
we gonna have backup in four weeks.

156
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,245
I have to run some equipment.

157
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:20,160
I got to show you something.

158
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,383
You like computers, right

159
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:23,999
I like the abacus, Billy.

160
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:26,487
Meet the future of paleontology.

161
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:28,652
Its a rapid photo type.

162
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,692
I scanned them from
the raptor skeleton.

163
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:35,023
If the computer breaks down
a thousand of slices.

164
00:11:35,058 --> 00:11:38,319
And this thing scoops it.
One layer at a time.

165
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:40,162
Its done.

166
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:53,199
I give you the resonating
chamber of velociraptor.

167
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:55,200
Listen to this.

168
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,559
This is brilliant, Billy.

169
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:12,918
All I have to say,
its just a little bit too late.

170
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:16,922
Grant, Paul Kirby.
Kirby Enteprise.

171
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:19,922
My card.
How are you doing, Billy.?

172
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:23,292
what can I do for you,
Mr Kirby?

173
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:27,452
well, the first thing,
Im a great admirer of yours.

174
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:30,407
And I have a proposition and
I would like to discuss with you.

175
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:33,087
would you have dinner with me
and my wife this evening?

176
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:34,236
Itll be our treat.

177
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:35,727
That will be great, but...

178
00:12:35,762 --> 00:12:36,532
Im tired,

179
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,887
I have been travelling.
Maybe some other time.

180
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:41,207
Believe me.
This will be worth you a while.

181
00:12:41,242 --> 00:12:42,572
we love to.

182
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:44,767
Terrific.
Thats the spirit. Good.

183
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:46,519
See you this evening then.

184
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:57,239
- Billy.
- How are you?

185
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,075
So what are you boys drinking?

186
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:07,317
- Ice peak cap.
- Two please.

187
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:09,647
we admire your work for years.

188
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:11,252
Really truly inspiring.

189
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:13,532
Amanda
and I just love the outdoors.

190
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:16,687
we have been on just every adventure
that can come up with.

191
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:20,839
The Neil and everything.

192
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:21,812
we even have two seats reserved

193
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:23,827
on the first commercial flight
to the moon.

194
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:25,854
And for the wedding anniversary
this year,

195
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,847
we like to do something
really special...

196
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:29,360
- Something...
- Once in a lifetime.

197
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:33,607
Ive charged an airplane
to fly us Isla Sorna.

198
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:35,438
And we like you to be our guide.

199
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:39,439
There you go, guys.

200
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,127
This is a very kind offer,
Mr Kirby.

201
00:13:43,162 --> 00:13:44,812
Im a very very busy man.

202
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:47,687
I can recommend a couple
of guys who is highly qualified that...

203
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:51,077
No. No.
You are the best.

204
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:52,942
Youd seen these animals
in the flash.

205
00:13:52,977 --> 00:13:54,557
There is even one comes close
to you.

206
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:56,572
You wont be able to fly
enough low

207
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,807
to see anything
that is really interesting.

208
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,012
Thats the interesting part.

209
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:03,367
Because
we have the permission to fly low.

210
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:04,372
How low?

211
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:06,652
Havent issue yet.

212
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:09,042
But I can fly lower than anybody else.
I can tell you.

213
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,567
From what I understand,
I understand...

214
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,478
This is what we want.

215
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:15,572
You see,

216
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:17,567
through my business dealing,
import and export.

217
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:18,412
Emerging market.

218
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:20,887
I have
a lot of friends in high level.

219
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:23,327
In that case,
Costa Rica we can go in.

220
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,732
Dr Grant,

221
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,052
you have no idea

222
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:28,487
how this important to us
that you come along.

223
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:29,927
This will be all the difference.

224
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:30,772
Mrs Kirby, I...

225
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:34,163
And of course we love to make
a contribution to your research here.

226
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:41,604
I can write all kind of numbers
on this check, Dr Grant.

227
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:43,966
Tell me.

228
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:47,115
whats this gonna take?

229
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,245
No way.
This one is lucky.

230
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:08,692
A couples years ago,

231
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:12,652
some parties in Island hand
gladding these cleaves in museum.

232
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:17,127
And its big up draught come in
and swipe me right across the sign.

233
00:15:17,162 --> 00:15:17,972
wham!

234
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:20,641
well, it does sound like.

235
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:23,275
This strap saved my life.

236
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:25,567
I got hook on the rock
when I was falling.

237
00:15:25,602 --> 00:15:29,003
Survivor are the most idiotic.

238
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:34,997
Alan,
thank you for bringing me along.

239
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,084
The bones will still be
there when you get back.

240
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:39,716
This is the great thing about
bones that they dont run away.

241
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:44,279
The truth is,
you got me into this.

242
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,798
Ive no intention of being
on my own with these people.

243
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:53,879
Dont get too excited, Billy.

244
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:56,127
Chances are once here think.

245
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:58,357
Good time to be nice.

246
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,400
Awake me when we get there.

247
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:09,085
So how do you know the Kirbys?

248
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:12,239
Through our church.

249
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:33,505
Ellie...

250
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,884
Ellie!

251
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:38,043
Here we go,
were almost there.

252
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:55,438
Youre approaching Isla Sorna.
Do you want to approach...

253
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:49,719
My God. Ive forgotten.

254
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:04,123
we did it, honey.
we are here.

255
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,027
If you see anything,
yell up.

256
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:09,127
I thought of keep it to myself.

257
00:18:09,162 --> 00:18:10,092
Im sorry.

258
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:12,527
Everyone, if you could
look out the left of the plane.

259
00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:14,852
You can see a whole curf
of Brachiosaurus.

260
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:18,367
In fact you could see the front of
the group alpha male grazing there.

261
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:20,647
Udesky, Nash.
How about the front?

262
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,763
You guys see anything?

263
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:22,845
Nothing yet,
Mr Kirby.

264
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:24,692
Mrs Kirby, look.

265
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:26,607
Out here youll see a group
of Triceratops...

266
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:28,487
Mr. Kirby, we have to land
in strip down ahead.

267
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:29,807
You want me to put it down?

268
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:30,492
No. No.

269
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,667
I told you on a circle
to see the whole island.

270
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:34,807
You have been set down.
we cant land here.

271
00:18:34,842 --> 00:18:35,532
what are you talking about?

272
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:37,487
- Hold on, I can explain.
- You cannot land on this island.

273
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:39,398
Its gonna be fine.

274
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,757
Everybody sit down.

275
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:46,079
would you please sit down...

276
00:18:57,447 --> 00:18:59,278
Tell me we didnt land.

277
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:06,684
I think they are looking for someone.

278
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:19,927
Dr Grant, are you alright?
Im sorry we have to be so...

279
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:22,361
who hit me?

280
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:24,883
That will be cooper.

281
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:26,572
what are they doing?

282
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:28,687
They are setting up a parameter.
Then we could play safe.

283
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:29,572
These guys are good.

284
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,887
Trust me. In this island,
there is no such thing as safe.

285
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,332
we must get back to that plane.

286
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,407
Could you ask your wife
stop making up that noise?

287
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,287
That is a very, very bad idea.

288
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:38,564
Amanda!

289
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,772
Ben!

290
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:43,167
Amanda, honey, Dr Grant says
that is a bad idea.

291
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:44,652
what?

292
00:19:44,687 --> 00:19:47,007
He says its a bad idea!

293
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:50,397
whats about idea?

294
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,676
what was that?

295
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:54,876
Its a tyrannosaurus.

296
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,765
I dont think so.

297
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,204
It sounds bigger.

298
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:03,036
we have to leave.

299
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,476
we have to leave now!

300
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:06,484
whats going on?

301
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:16,120
where is the professional who
can handle this?

302
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,919
Its alright.
we`rre just circled the island.

303
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:54,125
Stop!

304
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:57,006
what is he doing?

305
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,085
Thats Cooper.

306
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:02,082
Stop...

307
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,004
No one can stop this plane.

308
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:38,717
Are you okay?

309
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:41,081
were okay up here.

310
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:43,998
Everyone just stay put.

311
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:46,892
Mayday! Mayday!

312
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:47,727
who has a satellite phone?

313
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:49,285
I do.

314
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:51,082
I got it right here.

315
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,245
Come and get it.
The radio is gone.

316
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:03,565
we havent landed yet.

317
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:07,596
Damn it.

318
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:10,003
"The number you call is busy".

319
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:12,796
what was that?

320
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:18,921
what is it?

321
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,640
what?

322
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,962
- what...
- Hold it!

323
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:26,686
Hang on, everyone.

324
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:41,076
Help me!

325
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:47,166
Mrs Kirby, come back!

326
00:23:50,047 --> 00:23:51,116
Amanda!

327
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:36,002
Follow me!

328
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:45,683
In here!

329
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:20,555
I think we lost him.

330
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:27,081
Its okay. It`ss dead.

331
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:32,359
Nobody move a muscle.

332
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:33,124
No... No... No... Please dont. Stop.

333
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:34,317
Please.

334
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,522
Its time you do some explain,
Mr Kirby.

335
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:41,004
we called everyone.
we did verything we could.

336
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:41,892
No one would help us.

337
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:44,447
The Costa Rica goverment
said this is no fly zone.

338
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:45,812
The US embassy...

339
00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:50,407
Thats our US embassy told
we should accept the fact.

340
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,252
Can you believe that?

341
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:53,247
You left a 12 year-old
go para-sailing alone?

342
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:54,052
No!

343
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:55,767
He wasnt alone.
He was with a friend.

344
00:26:55,802 --> 00:26:57,052
Ben Hilderban.

345
00:26:57,087 --> 00:26:59,807
Paul and I divorced over a year ago.

346
00:26:59,842 --> 00:27:01,692
So why me?

347
00:27:01,727 --> 00:27:04,367
He said we needed someone who
had been on island before?

348
00:27:04,402 --> 00:27:07,647
Yes. But I did not tell
you to kidnap somebody.

349
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:10,144
I have never been on this island.

350
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:12,572
Sure you have.
You wrote that book.

351
00:27:12,607 --> 00:27:15,892
That is Isla Nublar.
This is Isla Sorna.

352
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:18,647
You mean there are two islands
with dinosaurs?

353
00:27:18,682 --> 00:27:20,332
You stay out of this.

354
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:21,807
So how long have he been missing?

355
00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:24,526
- 8 weeks.
- Almost 8 weeks.

356
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:30,487
Billy, now go back to plane
and set a camp.

357
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:31,840
And we make for the coast.

358
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:33,052
Dr Grant,

359
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:35,007
we are not leaving
this island without our son.

360
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:37,492
You can go on and look for him.

361
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:40,607
Or you can stick with us
as long as you dont hold us up.

362
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:41,332
Either way,

363
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:45,360
you probably wont
get out of this island alive.

364
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:58,482
So? what do we do?

365
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:01,603
Go and search for your son.

366
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,278
Thats the direction they are going.

367
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:08,359
Thats the one. Excellent.

368
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:35,039
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

369
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,283
Its nothing you haven`tt seen before.

370
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:41,772
How much weight did you lose?

371
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:44,879
About 25 pounds!
Ive been swimming.

372
00:28:45,327 --> 00:28:48,567
I hate to swim.
And I dont even know how to swim.

373
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,319
I learned.

374
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,198
- You look good.
- So are you.

375
00:28:57,927 --> 00:28:59,407
How would you classify, Billy?

376
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:02,205
Its a super predator.

377
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,885
Suchominus.

378
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:08,965
I think bigger.

379
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:10,676
Baryonyx?

380
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:12,155
Not on that cell.

381
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:15,317
Spinosaurus stick up with this.

382
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:20,438
I dont remember that
on Ingen`ss list.

383
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:21,892
Because it wasnt on there,

384
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,077
unless it makes them wonder
what they are up to.

385
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:37,647
So, Mr Kirby, tell me.

386
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:39,132
when you climbed K2,

387
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:42,239
did you based camp at
25,000 or 30,000 feet?

388
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:47,118
30,000 feet.
we were pretty close to the top.

389
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,636
It is above 30,000 feet,
actually.

390
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:52,767
No. No.
Thats a common mistake.

391
00:29:52,802 --> 00:29:53,732
Mr Kirby,

392
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:56,884
there is no such thing
as Kirby Enterprise, isnt?

393
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:00,239
Theres Kirby Painting Tile and Plus.

394
00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:02,405
The Plus stands for bathroom fixtures.

395
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:04,366
were in the
west Case Shopping Centre...

396
00:30:04,647 --> 00:30:07,400
I suppose we dont check
you out or anything...

397
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:09,607
Now, listen to me.
Ill pay you the money...

398
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,563
- This is good.
- No matter what.

399
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:15,759
we are in worst place on
the world, we are not being pay.

400
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,238
Alright, now wait.
Fellows, hold on.

401
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,920
Ill make this up to you.

402
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:22,522
If you ever do a bathroom
or a kitchen...

403
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,487
You are not really a mercenary,
are you?

404
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:26,772
I never said I was.

405
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:29,027
Thats true.
what are you?

406
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:31,212
Im like a booking agent.

407
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:34,159
Guys who got sick count on me.

408
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:38,366
Here. See we are now
in a hardware store.

409
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:39,762
Pay in title, yeah.

410
00:30:40,527 --> 00:30:42,327
You never can tell about people,
do you?

411
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:43,601
You get the truth.

412
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:45,727
Eric!

413
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:46,612
Quiet.

414
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:47,692
would you stop that?

415
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:50,007
Dr Grant said this is a
very dangerous territory.

416
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:50,492
Look.

417
00:30:50,527 --> 00:30:52,207
Maybe we should split up
or something, you know?

418
00:30:52,242 --> 00:30:53,727
we could cover twice as much
of the island.

419
00:30:53,762 --> 00:30:55,124
Dr Grant says that is a bad idea.

420
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:56,452
Dr Grant...
Dr Grant says this...

421
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,167
whats the good of hiring an expert
if we are not going to use his advice.

422
00:30:59,202 --> 00:31:01,847
Yeah. Except Dr Grant
isnt looking for Eric.

423
00:31:01,882 --> 00:31:02,972
He is looking for the coast.

424
00:31:03,007 --> 00:31:04,252
Okay, fine.
Go ahead and scream.

425
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:06,327
And when cry sake plot comes
and attacks.

426
00:31:06,362 --> 00:31:07,521
Dont come crying to me.

427
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:09,684
- Not that bad.
- what?

428
00:31:09,887 --> 00:31:11,243
- Nothing.
- what did you say?

429
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:12,599
- Nevermind.
- what did you say?

430
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:16,721
If we split up,
Im going along with you guys.

431
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:29,687
- Eric!
- Eric!

432
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,407
- Mrs Kirby.
- Eric!

433
00:31:31,442 --> 00:31:33,079
Mrs Kirby!

434
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:35,303
Mrs Kirby,
the chance is our remote.

435
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:37,000
There are still in our resonance.

436
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:44,481
An adult.

437
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:48,046
Hey, guys.

438
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:55,156
Thats my camera.

439
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:01,043
The battery is dead.

440
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:02,556
I got an idea.

441
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,520
Let me have the camera.

442
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:23,202
I shot this in the morning
he disappeared.

443
00:32:58,127 --> 00:32:59,162
He is alive.

444
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:02,359
I know hes alive.
we got to find him.

445
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:06,481
will we find one of those?

446
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:08,156
Maybe.

447
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:10,525
Only if cell is not doing.

448
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:12,241
Lets take it.

449
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:15,567
If we spot a plane,
it might be the good way to get attention.

450
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:29,886
I got it. Okay. Okay!

451
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:34,121
Mrs Kirby, please!

452
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:39,079
Okay, you are free.

453
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,405
Come back, Mrs Kirby.

454
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:49,080
Amanda, wait. Amanda.

455
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,046
Amanda?

456
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:06,805
Amanda... Amanda!

457
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,078
Amanda, stop...

458
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:13,279
Im sorry.
I`mm sorry about Ben.

459
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:20,599
Its not Ben,Paul.

460
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:23,082
Hes out there all by himself.

461
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:25,480
I know, I know.

462
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:29,003
Our kid is out there all by himself.

463
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,842
Listen to me.

464
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:42,523
Paul..

465
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:49,679
Dr Grant!
You should come and look at this!

466
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:20,760
Raptor.

467
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:33,802
we are going to find him.

468
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,884
Are you listening to me?
we are going to find him.

469
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:37,801
This kid got resources.

470
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:40,004
Remember last time
we tried to ground him?

471
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,842
wheres Billy?

472
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:51,282
what are you doing?

473
00:35:52,087 --> 00:35:53,759
I was trying to go to the nest.

474
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:55,845
Dont do that again.

475
00:35:56,607 --> 00:35:57,722
Im sorry.

476
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,799
If I lose you,
that means you are a damn tourist.

477
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:12,957
I bet they are in there,
dont you think?

478
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,964
I bet my bottom dollar.

479
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:17,646
what you think it is?

480
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:21,556
Thats ancient.
Four seasons.

481
00:36:56,287 --> 00:36:57,692
Eric!

482
00:36:57,727 --> 00:37:00,446
Paul,dont do that...

483
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:09,161
what the hell?

484
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,007
whos got some change?
Let me take some quarters.

485
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:30,124
I got a buck ten...

486
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:25,167
This is how you make dinosaurs.

487
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,885
No.

488
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:29,844
This is how you play God.

489
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:26,196
- That way!
- Look out.

490
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,195
Its locked.

491
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,445
- This way!
- Go! Go!

492
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:44,925
Hey! Over here!

493
00:40:02,007 --> 00:40:05,920
Push! Push!

494
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:14,166
My God.

495
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:17,006
Its calling the other half.

496
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:18,596
Come on!

497
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:42,446
Its in a hurry.

498
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:10,561
Out from the trace.

499
00:41:37,647 --> 00:41:38,716
Udesky.

500
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:58,606
Mr Kirby!

501
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:01,076
Billy!

502
00:42:01,287 --> 00:42:02,640
Is Alan with you?

503
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:10,802
Oh my God...

504
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:12,406
Mr Udesky!

505
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:14,685
Mr Udesky!

506
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,166
Hes dead.

507
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:20,132
Oh my God. No,hes not.

508
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:21,247
- No, hes not!
- No... wait!

509
00:42:21,282 --> 00:42:22,077
Something is not right.

510
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:25,156
Amanda!

511
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:33,399
Hold on! Hold on!

512
00:42:38,927 --> 00:42:39,803
They set a trap.

513
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,359
Yeah, they set a trap.

514
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:49,560
what do you say?

515
00:42:50,807 --> 00:42:52,160
what do you looking for?

516
00:44:17,927 --> 00:44:20,566
Thanks. Thanks a lot, Eric.

517
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:25,252
You know who I am?

518
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,423
Yeah, your parents are here.

519
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,560
They are looking for you.

520
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:33,476
- Together?
- Together.

521
00:44:34,807 --> 00:44:36,399
Thats not good.

522
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:38,605
They dont take so well
to get together.

523
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:40,924
I think its big surprise
when people could do in it.

524
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:42,882
when I have to.

525
00:44:58,287 --> 00:44:59,481
You are Alan Grant.

526
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:02,275
what are you doing here?

527
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:08,878
Your parents...
invited me along.

528
00:45:31,847 --> 00:45:33,326
I read all of your books.

529
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:36,518
I like the portion more.

530
00:45:36,887 --> 00:45:38,320
Before you are on the island.

531
00:45:39,647 --> 00:45:41,365
You like dinosaurs back then.

532
00:45:41,847 --> 00:45:44,315
well back then they hadnt try
to eat me then.

533
00:45:47,967 --> 00:45:50,481
when I jumped in here,
they left a lot of stuff behind.

534
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:51,557
Any weapons?

535
00:45:51,807 --> 00:45:54,162
No. I just use the gas...

536
00:45:54,727 --> 00:45:56,206
And I appreciate that.

537
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:02,082
Be careful with that T-rexas.

538
00:46:02,647 --> 00:46:03,852
Scare some of the small ones away,

539
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:06,321
but attacks the really big one
with defend.

540
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:09,159
This is T-rexas?

541
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:13,721
How do you get it?

542
00:46:14,127 --> 00:46:15,606
You dont want to know.

543
00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:21,744
Dessert?

544
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:22,802
Sure.

545
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:27,972
Eric,

546
00:46:28,007 --> 00:46:31,716
I have to tell you lost for
eight weeks in this island.

547
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:34,966
Is that all has been?

548
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,562
You are alive.
Thats the important thing.

549
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:41,526
And thanks to you is one thing
we have in common.

550
00:46:44,047 --> 00:46:46,641
Did you read Malcoms book?

551
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:48,825
Yeah.

552
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,643
So?

553
00:46:51,407 --> 00:46:52,652
I dont know. I mean...

554
00:46:52,687 --> 00:46:54,917
It was kind of preaching...

555
00:46:55,527 --> 00:46:58,087
And too much chaos.
Everthing is chaos.

556
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,757
It seem like the guy
was hiding himself.

557
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:05,726
well thats two things
we have in common.

558
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:13,043
what is it?

559
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:15,002
Coelophysis.

560
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:34,599
Alan! Alan!

561
00:47:38,847 --> 00:47:40,485
Alan!

562
00:47:55,527 --> 00:47:58,678
No matter how this turns out
it wasnt your fault.

563
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:03,363
Eric is always a sorry little kid.
AIways.

564
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:06,525
And he threw someone like
Ben Hilderban into the mess...

565
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:11,800
- well...
- well what?

566
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:14,838
All Im saying it`ss not your fault.

567
00:48:19,487 --> 00:48:23,605
No... If hed been with you,
he`lll be completely safe.

568
00:48:24,247 --> 00:48:27,045
You drive 5 miles in
every speed limit, Paul.

569
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,245
And Id thrown three cars
in three years.

570
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:34,759
well, not three.
The Buek wasnt really total.

571
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:39,360
I just said I was,
cause I wanted get a "Yes, you do".

572
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,721
Im so sorry that you
have to be here.

573
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,080
Im not.

574
00:50:04,887 --> 00:50:07,560
Theres a boat lie along side
the bank.

575
00:50:07,807 --> 00:50:08,876
Looks in good shape.

576
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,196
Rescue boat?

577
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:13,564
No. Someone left behind.

578
00:50:14,407 --> 00:50:15,601
Lets move.

579
00:50:27,087 --> 00:50:30,443
Stick to the plan.
Head for the coast.

580
00:50:30,847 --> 00:50:32,280
You are not going to look
for Dr Grant.

581
00:50:32,727 --> 00:50:34,212
Heading the coast is Alans idea.

582
00:50:34,247 --> 00:50:35,885
If hes alive,
there is where he`ss heading.

583
00:50:36,127 --> 00:50:36,923
I agree.

584
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,606
what about Eric?

585
00:50:38,641 --> 00:50:39,846
Eric is a smart kid.

586
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:42,637
He probably know he stands
a best chance by the coast.

587
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:45,487
He figures all the big dinosaurus
are in the centre of the island.

588
00:50:45,522 --> 00:50:46,556
Right?

589
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:49,722
Sure.

590
00:50:56,247 --> 00:50:57,475
You know what this is?

591
00:50:58,287 --> 00:50:59,436
Thats a raptor claw.

592
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:02,205
I have one. A fossil.

593
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:04,760
Mine is new.

594
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:07,520
How much do you explore?

595
00:51:08,887 --> 00:51:10,767
I stick pretty close
to the compound.

596
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:12,647
I think if anyone is looking for me...

597
00:51:12,682 --> 00:51:14,239
Theres where they started.

598
00:51:15,247 --> 00:51:16,441
we need to get to the coast.

599
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:17,677
That was a plan.

600
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,532
Are you sure?

601
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:20,532
The closer you get to the water,
the bigger the things get.

602
00:51:20,567 --> 00:51:25,277
we have to find a way to the canyon
to find a river out to the coast.

603
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:28,960
After we find your parents.

604
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:30,772
And then what?

605
00:51:30,807 --> 00:51:32,206
One step to the time.

606
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:33,722
Listen.

607
00:51:34,487 --> 00:51:35,681
what?

608
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:38,326
Thats my dad satellite phone.

609
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:43,652
How do you know?

610
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:46,360
Kirby Painting Tile and Plus.

611
00:51:46,847 --> 00:51:49,281
Dad!

612
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:13,426
- Eric!
- Eric!

613
00:52:13,461 --> 00:52:15,006
Eric! This way!

614
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:16,402
Eric!

615
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,643
Mom! Dad!

616
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,519
Eric!

617
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:29,040
Mom! Dad!

618
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:38,122
I know it. Oh my God.

619
00:52:39,007 --> 00:52:41,805
I know it. Oh my God.

620
00:52:42,687 --> 00:52:45,201
Oh, Im glad to see you.

621
00:52:45,687 --> 00:52:46,836
Hey, you got my beg.

622
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:50,041
Yeah, lucky strap.

623
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:52,716
want me to carry it?

624
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:55,875
Need to find a gap here.

625
00:52:58,007 --> 00:52:59,759
How did you know we were here?

626
00:53:00,127 --> 00:53:00,732
The phone.

627
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:02,567
The stupid jingle from the store.
I heard it.

628
00:53:02,602 --> 00:53:03,812
My phone?

629
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:04,967
Yeah, your satellite phone.

630
00:53:05,002 --> 00:53:05,764
where is it?

631
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:06,492
I dont have it.

632
00:53:06,527 --> 00:53:07,652
when did you use it last night?

633
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:11,647
On the plane.
I got a call on the place and...

634
00:53:11,682 --> 00:53:14,115
what?

635
00:53:15,407 --> 00:53:16,760
I loaned it to Nash.

636
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:20,877
He must have had it when he...

637
00:53:29,367 --> 00:53:30,436
Run.

638
00:54:32,487 --> 00:54:34,205
Alan,
you wanna give me the bag back.

639
00:54:35,087 --> 00:54:36,406
Its okay, Billy. I got it.

640
00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:38,919
Please give me the bag.

641
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:44,485
Its not safe.

642
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:56,799
Raptors eggs?

643
00:54:58,447 --> 00:55:01,644
Did you steal raptors eggs?

644
00:55:07,927 --> 00:55:09,599
Now it all make sense.

645
00:55:09,767 --> 00:55:13,587
I swear if I know youre
gonna end up with them.

646
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:17,372
I took them on an impose.
I thought that the door

647
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:20,046
with the fortune are enough for the
things I obtain 10 more years.

648
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:23,327
But you have to believe me
this was a stupid decision.

649
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,167
But I did it with the best intentions.

650
00:55:25,202 --> 00:55:27,892
with the best intentions...

651
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:34,639
Some other worst things imaginable
have been done with the best intentions.

652
00:55:35,607 --> 00:55:38,723
Come on, Billy.
As far as I concern, you are

653
00:55:38,758 --> 00:55:41,839
not better than the people
who built this place.

654
00:55:58,607 --> 00:55:59,612
what are you doing?

655
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,399
Those things are after us
because of those.

656
00:56:01,647 --> 00:56:05,196
Those things know we have the eggs.

657
00:56:05,447 --> 00:56:06,960
I drop them into the river.

658
00:56:08,007 --> 00:56:09,725
They will still be after us.

659
00:56:09,927 --> 00:56:11,201
what if they catch us with them?

660
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:13,564
what if they catch us without them?

661
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,407
There is a boat at the bottom,
just down the river.

662
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,762
we try to make to
the coast, at least.

663
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:16,164
- Youre okay?
- Yeah.

664
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:28,838
Lets do this one
other time, shall we?

665
00:58:05,687 --> 00:58:07,405
Okay, come on over.

666
00:58:08,407 --> 00:58:09,965
One other time.

667
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,044
Okay, Eric. Im gonna
leave you just for a minute.

668
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:15,602
And then you are going to
be right behind me, okay?

669
00:58:15,807 --> 00:58:19,197
Mom, Ive been alone in
the water truck for eight weeks.

670
00:58:19,927 --> 00:58:22,282
I think I can manage the next
few minutes without you.

671
00:58:25,927 --> 00:58:27,918
Right.
we are all together now.

672
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:54,406
Okay, Eric.

673
00:58:54,607 --> 00:58:56,882
- Come on, honey
- You go.

674
00:59:29,847 --> 00:59:30,723
Mom?

675
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:33,996
Oh my God.

676
00:59:34,767 --> 00:59:35,722
what is it?

677
00:59:36,647 --> 00:59:38,127
Its a bird cage.

678
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:39,765
For what?

679
00:59:47,527 --> 00:59:50,438
Eric!

680
00:59:51,007 --> 00:59:52,725
Eric!

681
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:07,285
I cant stay without my kid.

682
01:00:11,087 --> 01:00:12,236
Eric!

683
01:00:24,607 --> 01:00:25,483
This way!

684
01:00:37,487 --> 01:00:38,363
Billy!

685
01:00:38,687 --> 01:00:41,599
Billy, stop.

686
01:00:42,327 --> 01:00:43,396
Billy, stop!

687
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,682
Stop, Billy!

688
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:47,839
Billy!

689
01:01:04,367 --> 01:01:05,641
Eric, hold on!

690
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:11,076
Eric!

691
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:24,766
Jump!

692
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:52,406
Billy!

693
01:02:04,207 --> 01:02:05,162
Look out now!

694
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:50,796
Eric!

695
01:02:58,727 --> 01:02:59,398
Eric!

696
01:03:02,687 --> 01:03:04,166
There he is!

697
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,846
with the pteranodous.

698
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:07,446
Get him out of there.

699
01:03:10,247 --> 01:03:11,839
Go! Go!

700
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:13,282
what about Billy?

701
01:03:27,927 --> 01:03:29,042
Hang on, Billy!

702
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:44,836
Go away! Go away!

703
01:04:34,007 --> 01:04:34,837
Come on!

704
01:05:05,087 --> 01:05:06,281
Its playing the gasoline.

705
01:05:06,847 --> 01:05:09,680
Now just got to get out
to the coast.

706
01:05:09,967 --> 01:05:12,322
we got some sort of...
some sort of signal.

707
01:05:13,007 --> 01:05:14,326
Build the fire or something.

708
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:16,119
Something that can see
from the air.

709
01:05:22,447 --> 01:05:23,482
Dr. Grant?

710
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,679
Hey, Eric.
How are you doing?

711
01:05:36,447 --> 01:05:37,926
Im sorry about Billy.

712
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:44,162
You know whats the last thing
I said to him was?

713
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:48,795
Its... he`s as bad as the people
who built this place.

714
01:05:49,607 --> 01:05:51,165
It wasn't true.

715
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:54,837
Billy is just young... thats all.

716
01:05:56,727 --> 01:05:59,241
I have a theory there
is two kind of boys.

717
01:05:59,487 --> 01:06:01,478
Those who want to be astronomers.

718
01:06:01,727 --> 01:06:03,683
And those who want
to be astronauts.

719
01:06:04,647 --> 01:06:07,412
The astronomers,
the paying intelligence.

720
01:06:07,447 --> 01:06:12,601
Get to study this amazing things
from a place with complete safety.

721
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:15,403
But he never got to go into space.

722
01:06:15,687 --> 01:06:16,961
Exactly.

723
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:20,080
Its the difference between
imagining and seeing.

724
01:06:20,327 --> 01:06:22,522
Be able to touch them.

725
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:27,406
And... thats all Billy wanted.

726
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:37,284
Dr Grant...

727
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:05,005
It is open, Dr Grant.

728
01:07:06,847 --> 01:07:08,075
Billy was right.

729
01:07:33,287 --> 01:07:34,436
Listen.

730
01:07:54,367 --> 01:07:55,720
Find the phone before
it stops ringing.

731
01:07:56,007 --> 01:07:57,326
Eric,stand there.

732
01:08:01,007 --> 01:08:02,884

734
01:08:21,087 --> 01:08:22,918
Hello? Hello?

735
01:08:23,127 --> 01:08:28,724
"Enjoy your meal in one of
our four star restaurant... "

736
01:08:28,887 --> 01:08:29,876
Look out!

737
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,486
Turn off the power.

738
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:52,963
You got to choose for making one call.

739
01:08:53,127 --> 01:08:53,852
what do you do?

740
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,166
Dont call the US embassy.

741
01:08:55,201 --> 01:08:56,446
They wont do a damn thing.

742
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:59,727
Hey, guys.
Come here. Look at this!

743
01:09:06,007 --> 01:09:06,803

744
01:09:07,647 --> 01:09:09,239
Something must have spook them.

745
01:09:09,727 --> 01:09:11,604
Get the edge of calling, Mr Kirby.

746
01:09:18,807 --> 01:09:19,557
Open the plot.

747
01:09:32,767 --> 01:09:34,087
Hello?

748
01:09:34,122 --> 01:09:35,324

749
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,823
Hello?

750
01:09:36,858 --> 01:09:40,172

751
01:09:40,207 --> 01:09:46,806
Charlie,

752
01:09:47,367 --> 01:09:49,005
Its the dinosaur man.

753
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:50,443
Okay.

754
01:09:51,407 --> 01:09:56,435
Charlie,

755
01:09:57,127 --> 01:09:58,003

756
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:05,107

757
01:11:05,142 --> 01:11:06,047
The dinosaur man.

758
01:11:06,082 --> 01:11:07,241
He is?

759
01:11:07,407 --> 01:11:08,396

760
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,007

761
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,122
Get the phone.

762
01:11:30,567 --> 01:11:32,000
Ellie, listen to me!

763
01:11:32,407 --> 01:11:34,363
Alan, are you on a cell phone?
I cant hear you.

764
01:11:34,647 --> 01:11:37,400
The raptor chases me...

765
01:11:40,207 --> 01:11:41,356
Hello?

766
01:13:43,687 --> 01:13:47,919
Dad! Dad!

767
01:14:02,807 --> 01:14:06,800
Dad!

768
01:14:08,687 --> 01:14:10,484
Paul, you cant...

769
01:14:12,687 --> 01:14:14,837
You cant leave me like this.

770
01:14:17,127 --> 01:14:19,163
Im not going anywhere.

771
01:14:19,967 --> 01:14:21,036
Dad!

772
01:14:34,527 --> 01:14:37,360
Remember when we went fishing
a couple summers ago?

773
01:14:38,327 --> 01:14:41,000
we putted the boat in the water
and the trailer sank.

774
01:14:42,327 --> 01:14:45,797
The toll truck tried to pull us out
and they got drag in too.

775
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:49,042
The truck driver wanted to
knock my lights out.

776
01:14:54,647 --> 01:14:55,796
I miss fishing.

777
01:15:01,727 --> 01:15:03,319
Mr Kirby.

778
01:15:07,527 --> 01:15:08,562
That lady you called.

779
01:15:09,567 --> 01:15:10,477
who is she?

780
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:12,805
How do you know that
she can help us?

781
01:15:13,007 --> 01:15:14,847
She is the person
I can always count on.

782
01:15:14,882 --> 01:15:15,962
I owe her a lot.

783
01:15:17,247 --> 01:15:19,044
I dont think
I have ever told her that.

784
01:15:19,287 --> 01:15:20,606
You should.

785
01:15:21,247 --> 01:15:23,442
You hear that?

786
01:15:25,887 --> 01:15:26,603
The ocean.

787
01:15:43,047 --> 01:15:44,116
Pick up your eggs.

788
01:15:52,727 --> 01:15:53,955
Everybody get down.

789
01:15:54,407 --> 01:15:56,079
She is challenging us.

790
01:16:14,687 --> 01:16:16,279
She thinks she stole the eggs.

791
01:16:16,567 --> 01:16:17,443
Get behind me.

792
01:16:38,047 --> 01:16:40,242
Give me the eggs.

793
01:16:59,127 --> 01:17:00,480
Do it, mom.

794
01:17:18,927 --> 01:17:20,804
No... No... Call for help.

795
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:06,602
Thats a helicopter.

796
01:18:16,487 --> 01:18:19,399
Dr Grant?
Dr Alan Grant?

797
01:18:20,007 --> 01:18:23,158
No!
Thats a very bad idea!

798
01:18:32,847 --> 01:18:35,407
You have to thank her now.

799
01:18:35,807 --> 01:18:36,717
Shes in the NAVY.

800
01:18:39,447 --> 01:18:40,846
God bless you, Ellie.

801
01:18:52,447 --> 01:18:55,007
- Is this man with you?
- what?

802
01:19:04,847 --> 01:19:06,200
we made it...

803
01:19:06,447 --> 01:19:08,722
Yeah.

804
01:19:09,607 --> 01:19:11,438
I rescue your hat.

805
01:19:13,967 --> 01:19:14,717
Give me that.

806
01:19:17,527 --> 01:19:18,721
Thats the important thing.

807
01:19:20,247 --> 01:19:21,282
Dr Grant!

808
01:19:44,607 --> 01:19:45,642
what the hell is that?

809
01:19:47,167 --> 01:19:48,441
Dr Grant, look!

810
01:19:58,127 --> 01:19:59,567
where do you think
they are going?

811
01:19:59,602 --> 01:20:01,046
I dont know.

812
01:20:01,247 --> 01:20:03,397
Maybe just looking
for a new nesting ground.

813
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:05,639
Its all in the world for them.

814
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:08,117
How dare them to nest in
Olakhoma?

815
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:16,160
Lets go home.

816
01:20:54,087 --> 01:20:58,842
- THE END-
