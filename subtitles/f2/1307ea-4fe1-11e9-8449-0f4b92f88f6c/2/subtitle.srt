1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,242
Get out!

2
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:36,305
Block the north side!
I'll cover the south!

3
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:02,931
Go! Go!

4
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:47,735
Will this be a problem?

5
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:50,897
With a billion of them,
do you think they'll miss one or two?

6
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:54,773
The embassy's asking for the release
of his personal effects.

7
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:05,349
Send them a big wreath of flowers...
with my condolences.

8
00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:07,855
How much should I spend?

9
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:10,517
This much.

10
00:03:12,962 --> 00:03:16,489
Here are your assistant's
personal effects, and here...

11
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,160
are some photos of your hero
killing another Chinese citizen...

12
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,567
on the French soil.

13
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:25,266
There's a time for diplomacy
and a time for action.

14
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:29,877
Diplomacy is dead.

15
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:45,959
- You should go to the hospital.
- Do you have a needle and thread?

16
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:07,311
You know, since I began my work...

17
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:10,546
I have received five of you young men.

18
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:13,816
Fast, proud... like you.

19
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:17,986
Four have died...

20
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,461
the last one right in my arms.

21
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:27,330
Before my time is up here,
I would like to send one home alive.

22
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:34,474
I'll go for some bandages
and disinfectant for you.

23
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,254
Hi.

24
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:03,004
- Need any help?
- No.

25
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:06,064
I have some experience.

26
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,474
You know, the longer that
that thing stays open,

27
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:13,845
the more risk there is of infection
setting in, and then you are in for it.

28
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,317
I once had a scrape that I ignored.
I let it go for a couple days.

29
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,684
- It turned into staph infection.
- All right!

30
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:24,789
But only to sew it.

31
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,091
- Then you must leave. Okay?
- Yeah.

32
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,863
Doesn't like me standing outside, huh?
Your uncle.

33
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:37,171
Well, I don't blame him.
If I were him,

34
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:39,605
I wouldn't like me
standing out there either.

35
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:42,143
Now, this is gonna sting.

36
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:48,181
Believe me, if I had any other
place to stand, I would.

37
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,980
It's just all the good spots
get taken by the others and...

38
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:55,490
You would not believe how much business
some of these girls do.

39
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:58,026
- Guess how much some of them do in a day.
- I don't know.

40
00:05:58,093 --> 00:06:00,891
- Well, guess.
- I can't.

41
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:03,557
- Sure you can. Pick a number.
- Five.

42
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,692
Five? How about 25?

43
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:09,327
- 25?
- Mm-hmm.

44
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:12,430
That's the record.
But at least 15.

45
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,600
- Can you believe that?
- No.

46
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:19,580
Yeah. Me? I'm lucky
if I can do five in a week.

47
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:23,243
- You ever been with a hooker?
- No.

48
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,516
- Not even once?
- No.

49
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:29,888
- Are you gay?
- No.

50
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,894
That'd be okay if you are. I think
everyone should be who they want to be...

51
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:35,396
- And do it with who they want to do it with.
- I'm not gay!

52
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:38,433
All I'm saying is, I don't hold
nothin' against nobody that way.

53
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:41,061
- Are you finished?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,104
There.

55
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:47,399
Mmm. Here you go.
Good as new.

56
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:51,873
Oh, my God. Look at that scar.
Let me see.

57
00:06:51,947 --> 00:06:55,815
I'm fine. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

58
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:02,014
You did a very good job.

59
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:04,082
I used to sew up pigs.
That was my specialty.

60
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:09,392
Used to have this big, fat mama sow,
and she tore herself along the barbwire when...

61
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:12,025
she was trying to get to the other side
of the fence to get at these apples.

62
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:17,231
- You gonna be around long?
- No. I go home as soon as my business is over.

63
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,307
Hmm. And so, what is your business,

64
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:22,343
- If you don't mind me asking?
- Shrimp.

65
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:25,073
Oh, yeah.
Pretty aggressive shrimp.

66
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:28,207
You should probably be more careful.

67
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:31,685
- No wife?
- No.

68
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:33,688
Haven't met the right girl, I bet.

69
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:36,691
- Right?
- My work... It's hard to meet any girls.

70
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,354
Any interest in an ex-junkie hooker...

71
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:44,593
who can cook, clean, sew
and who likes Chinese food?

72
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,600
No, thank you.

73
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:49,103
I'm just kidding.

74
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:51,105
Hey, look.

75
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:57,771
See? My daughter.

76
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:04,785
- My angel. Sweet, huh?
- Yes.

77
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:10,951
Why do you do this kind of... job?

78
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:13,824
Well...

79
00:08:17,232 --> 00:08:19,700
There was this guy, and, uh,

80
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:23,169
I met him after I had my baby.

81
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:26,639
And where I come from, girls without
husbands just do not have babies.

82
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,643
And if they do, well,
it's kinda hard on 'em.

83
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:31,737
So, anyway, this guy I met...
He's this French guy.

84
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:34,612
He's really cool
with this great accent...

85
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:37,252
and always talking about art and books
and movies and everything.

86
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:41,482
And, boy, when you're, you know...

87
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:44,492
When you're young and really desperate,
you know, this...

88
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,759
And this guy could really...
I mean, he could talk. You know?

89
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,960
And so... I don't know.

90
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:57,800
The next thing you know,
you're on the street.

91
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:02,409
Why don't you just... quit?

92
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:06,239
It's a little more complicated than that.

93
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:09,580
What do you mean?

94
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:22,953
I should probably get back.
See you later.

95
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,295
Nice talking to you.

96
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:34,570
- Lupo!
- Practicing embroidey on the clients?

97
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:37,669
No, no, he's not...

98
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:40,874
Lupo, he was just...
He had a cut on his arm.

99
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:44,077
I though the was gonna call the medics,
and they'd be blocking off the street,

100
00:09:44,153 --> 00:09:46,644
and then the clients couldn't come,
and I couldn't be standing on my spot,

101
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:50,453
and I couldn't make any money for you,
so I thought if I just took five minutes, then...

102
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:55,463
Shh.
Get back to work.

103
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:59,092
Lupo, he had nothing to do with...

104
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:02,295
I said, get back to work!

105
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:06,638
Excuse me.

106
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:14,705
I'm really sorry to interfere
in your business.

107
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:19,379
But I would really appreciate it...

108
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:22,788
if you...

109
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:26,294
don't do that again.

110
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,930
The little statue speaks.

111
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:33,968
You know, I don't care
if you fuck her, bleed on her.

112
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:37,766
You're still using her time,
and her time is my money.

113
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,808
You've kept her busy
for 20 minutes.

114
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:44,437
- Do you know the going rate for 20 minutes?
- No.

115
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:48,009
Five hundred francs.

116
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:09,268
Ah! Five for her time, now five for mine.

117
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,685
My kind of client.

118
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:29,117
Lupo, we should get back...

119
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:32,620
Hello, Max?

120
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,854
Fuck!

121
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,267
What happened?

122
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,178
Down!

123
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:02,376
Fuck!

124
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:29,203
Ah! Damn... F... Oh!

125
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:35,974
Oh, God!

126
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:43,318
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

127
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:44,307
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

128
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,480
Oh, God. Oh, God.

129
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:50,353
What're we gonna do?
What're we gonna do?

130
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:53,360
Respect his wishes.

131
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:06,124
Listen.

132
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:09,500
The longer you keep information from me
about this psychopath you sent over,

133
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:12,131
the longer my city will bleed
innocent blood.

134
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:14,471
I assure you, Inspector,
we have kept no information from you.

135
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:17,569
Good.

136
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:27,488
- What're we gonna do now?
- I don't know.

137
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:30,457
- I can't walk the streets all night.
- Walking helps me think.

138
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:33,392
- Walking hurts my feet.
- Then go home.

139
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:35,726
Oh, just like that.
First you put me in this mess,

140
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:38,061
and then you think
you can just get rid of me.

141
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:40,067
I put you in this mess?

142
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:42,433
You were the one
who came to the shop to pee.

143
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:44,870
You were the one
who offered to sew me up.

144
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,238
I didn't ask you for anything!

145
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:50,472
I only asked to be left alone.

146
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:53,673
Oh, yeah, that's you...
don't need anything, don't need anybody.

147
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:56,410
Just have yourself and your stupid job
selling shrimp chips.

148
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,853
I don't sell shrimp chips.

149
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:02,856
Yeah, I figured that out. I mean,
I'm stupid, but I'm not that stupid.

150
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:05,449
- I'm a cop.
- I'm Santa Claus.

151
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:07,495
Who is Santa Claus?

152
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:10,224
A big fat guy, red suit,
flying reindeer?

153
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:12,960
Jesus, God,
don't you know anything?

154
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:18,272
Take me here.

155
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,273
Why do you want to go there?

156
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:27,179
The best thing to do. When you lose
your way, you go back to the beginning.

157
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:29,546
Beginning?
Beginning of what?

158
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:31,983
My work. Last night.

159
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,258
You... You were there last night?

160
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:41,659
Working with the French cop.

161
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,324
- Richard?
- You know him?

162
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:47,630
Yeah. I was there too.

163
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:50,068
The redhead.

164
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,074
Yeah. No, it was a wig.
It was...

165
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:57,600
- Come on.
- Wait a minute!

166
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,171
- A second ago you couldn't wait to get rid of me.
- You're my proof.

167
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:04,184
I will take you to the embassy,
and you will tell them everything.

168
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:07,744
No, no. I'm in deep enough.
I'm not gonna be your witness.

169
00:18:07,856 --> 00:18:10,017
You're the only one who can save me.

170
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:12,059
Don't you listen?

171
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:14,425
Richard has my daughter.

172
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:16,396
But you don't think about that, do you?
No!

173
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:19,160
You don't think what's gonna happen to her,
you don't think what's gonna happen to me.

174
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:21,600
Of course not!
You only think of your job.

175
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,037
Because that's all that matters to you,
because that's all you've got in your crummy cop's life.

176
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:28,200
You take Richard down, and it's
gonna leave a space for another bastard,

177
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:30,676
one who we pray will be less of
a bastard than the one before him.

178
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:32,679
And that's reality!

179
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:38,344
Maybe it's not your reality,
but it's my reality every day, 24-7.

180
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:43,049
And there's nothing you or anybody else
can do to change that.

181
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:45,058
Wait.

182
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:48,323
If I get your daughter back,
will you help me?

183
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:52,628
I'm... I'm...
I'm really screwed this time.

184
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:56,432
My government will protect you.
They will give you safely away.

185
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:59,473
Away where?
To China?

186
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:03,204
I mean, I like the chips,
but no, thank you.

187
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:06,372
Listen to me.

188
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:11,317
I know you've had some bad experiences
trusting people.

189
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:14,378
But if I gave you my word,

190
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,684
you will be safe.

191
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:22,026
Yes, Minister.

192
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:24,565
We're doing all we can, Minister.

193
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:28,660
But we are not magicians who can pull
killers out of hats like they're rabbits,

194
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:32,138
especially one who is trained like this.

195
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:35,108
I'm just a cop trying
to do his job. Yes.

196
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:39,441
I'll call you back.

197
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:43,075
Richard! My God, Richard!
You're not gonna believe this.

198
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:47,521
Try me.

199
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,056
I... This crazy little Chinese...

200
00:19:53,128 --> 00:19:57,224
Lupo picked the perfect spot,
except it smelled like shrimps.

201
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,597
And how can I get any clients
when I smell like a shrimp?

202
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:04,162
So anyway, I was trying to work,
and Max and Lupo come along.

203
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:07,333
They went into the shop,
and the next thing I know,

204
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:11,311
the little fucker goes nuts,
you know, and-and... I mean...

205
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:14,974
Max tried to protect me,
and the Chinese guy killed both of them.

206
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,608
I believe you.

207
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,314
And then?

208
00:20:21,423 --> 00:20:23,653
And then he takes me as a hostage.

209
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:27,718
And he made me carry this stuff, and he dragged me
all the way up to that church...

210
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:29,957
You know, the big church
on the top of the hill?

211
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:32,022
And then... You know...
And he made me...

212
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,797
help him do these things... these weird
things with incense and pajamas.

213
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,704
- And every time I tried to run...
- He stopped you?

214
00:20:42,377 --> 00:20:44,612
Yeah.

215
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:47,146
You know...
You know those movies...

216
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:50,308
with that Chinese guy who's always
kicking and screaming all the time and...

217
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:53,182
- He used kung fu on you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

218
00:20:53,254 --> 00:20:56,553
He did. Look.

219
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,794
Wow.

220
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:07,157
And then he made me go to this
restaurant while he ate this goop...

221
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:11,672
with weird things in it, you know,
like snails and frogs' legs and...

222
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,402
That is when you escaped
out of the bathroom window?

223
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:18,071
- When he fell asleep.
- In the restaurant?

224
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:21,138
He... Yeah.

225
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:24,618
Richard.

226
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:27,678
Please, don't... don't do that.

227
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:38,723
Do you think he is still there
in the restaurant?

228
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:46,336
Well, he drank a whole lot of beers.
That's why I came here.

229
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:49,502
- 'Cause I thought if I helped you...
- What?

230
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:52,068
I could show you where he is.

231
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:57,813
- You're not too tired?
- Oh, yeah, for sure. I could probably sleep for a week.

232
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,150
But, I don't know. I...

233
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:05,058
You want me to come?

234
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:07,458
I don't know.
What do you think?

235
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:12,228
I think... I should come.

236
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,598
I think you should stay.

237
00:22:16,337 --> 00:22:20,501
Okay. He's... He's at
the Mandarin in Belville.

238
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:23,066
But... But I'll do what ever you want,
though. I mean, I just...

239
00:22:23,144 --> 00:22:25,476
I want you to trust me.

240
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:29,782
I trust you.

241
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:32,251
Ow! Wait. Wait.

242
00:22:35,123 --> 00:22:39,116
And if I discover I can't,
I know where to find you.

243
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,168
What about my daughter?

244
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:52,999
She's safe, just like her mother.

245
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:55,008
Watch her.

246
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:30,944
So, what's a girl gotta do
to get fed around here?

247
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:37,343
Okay. Okay.

248
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:43,721
Wait a minute. What do you think I am,
the village idiot?

249
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,487
No. First you go get my sandwich,

250
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:49,325
and then I give you your dessert.

251
00:24:53,394 --> 00:24:56,090
Hello?

252
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:58,064
Hello?

253
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:01,431
- Don't do that!
- You get it?

254
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:04,733
No, I always walk around handcuffed to
a steam pipe with a turtle for company.

255
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:06,740
So you didn't get it.

256
00:25:06,808 --> 00:25:10,335
Is it just you, or do all cops
lack a basic sense of humor?

257
00:25:10,411 --> 00:25:12,641
Now will you help?

258
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:14,841
Relax your arm.

259
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:18,510
I can't relax it anymore.
Come on, you know about handcuffs.

260
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,317
- You sure you got all of them?
- The deal was I get you all the tapes in his office.

261
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,587
Are you gonna live up to your end
of the bargain or what?

262
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,527
Are you listening?
Hello!

263
00:25:29,664 --> 00:25:32,428
- No, no. No needles.
- No needles. No.

264
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,730
Ow!

265
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:39,398
- How did you do that?
- Chinese magic.

266
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:41,738
- Let's go to the embassy.
- No.

267
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:44,835
- First we get my daughter.
- No, first the embassy, then I get your daughter.

268
00:25:44,912 --> 00:25:48,507
Bullshit. I'm not gonna sit someplace
safe while my kid's life's in danger,

269
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:50,550
so forget it!

270
00:25:57,091 --> 00:25:59,025
Which way?

271
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:06,692
She escaped?

272
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:09,202
What do you mean she escaped?

273
00:26:11,172 --> 00:26:13,106
How could she escape?

274
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:18,812
It's here.

275
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:35,495
See you around.

276
00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:40,023
What is this place?

277
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:42,126
It's an orphanage.

278
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:44,739
- Do you mind?
- What?

279
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:46,036
- Do you mind?
- What?

280
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:07,019
Oh, no.

281
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:09,188
Shit.

282
00:27:11,065 --> 00:27:12,999
Oh, come on.

283
00:27:17,205 --> 00:27:19,696
There it is.
Section "B", bed 13.

284
00:27:19,774 --> 00:27:21,708
Okay.

285
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:40,121
What's wrong?

286
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:43,527
I don't know.
I guess I'm kinda nervous.

287
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:46,761
I mean, I haven't seen her
in almost a year.

288
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,927
Then don't make her wait.

289
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:50,732
Go.

290
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,941
Ow!

291
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:05,732
- Are you okay?
- I don't think so.

292
00:30:37,672 --> 00:30:39,503
Somebody help me!

293
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:25,585
Here, sweetie.

294
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:29,111
That's for boys.
Don't you have any Barbies?

295
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,919
All my Barbies are working.

296
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:38,331
I had a turtle,
but your mother took it.

297
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:43,599
When am I going to see my mommy?

298
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:45,605
Soon, darling.

299
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:49,574
Very soon.

300
00:31:51,712 --> 00:31:54,442
My daughter?

301
00:31:54,548 --> 00:31:57,381
Calm down.
Everything's gonna be okay.

302
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:59,476
But he has my daughter.

303
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:01,885
And we have them.

304
00:32:01,956 --> 00:32:04,652
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

305
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:09,788
No. You don't understand.

306
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:12,128
My life is not some fairy tale.

307
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,633
My life is hell.

308
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:16,761
Richard is the devil,

309
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:19,670
and he has my daughter,
and he's gonna kill her,

310
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,708
and then he's gonna kill me.

311
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:25,610
And then he's gonna find a way
to get out of it clean.

312
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:29,149
You're wrong.
They will arrest him,

313
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,617
and they'll take care of you
and your daughter.

314
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:35,348
"They"? "They"?

315
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:39,257
I don't give a shit about them.

316
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:42,454
I don't trust them.

317
00:32:44,765 --> 00:32:47,101
I trusted you.

318
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:54,266
For the first time in...
God, I don't know, forever...

319
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:57,139
I don't know why I trust someone.

320
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:02,311
You promised you'd take care of her.

321
00:33:02,383 --> 00:33:05,546
Yes.

322
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:11,987
You're tired.
I think you should sleep.

323
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,722
- Hello?
- I want the child.

324
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:58,063
- I want the cassette.
- I gave the cassette to my government.

325
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:02,735
- They will know what to do with it.
- Bad move, Johnny Boy.

326
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:05,437
Now that the kid has no value,

327
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:08,140
what am I going to do with her?

328
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:10,717
She's too young to work.

329
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:13,252
Maybe not.

330
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,654
- What do you think?
- I think you should come to the window.

331
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:31,703
Now I know where you are.
I'm coming up.

332
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:40,440
He's coming up.

333
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:48,988
Hey, monsieur...

334
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:56,228
Sound the alert!

335
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:50,174
Fight!

336
00:36:57,785 --> 00:37:00,948
Come on! Come on!
Get those out!

337
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:03,649
Move it! Move it!
This is not a drill!

338
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,624
Go now!

339
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,172
Ah, Johnny, Johnny,
I'm disappointed in you.

340
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:50,512
Coming to Paris for the first time,
and instead of enjoying yourself,

341
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:52,814
you're doing all this useless
running around.

342
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:56,913
- I don't like to get bored.
- Me either.

343
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:00,187
And right now I'm finding you very boring!

344
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:01,852
Wait!

345
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:06,699
You're making a big mistake.

346
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,928
- Ah, really?
- In the second...

347
00:41:09,002 --> 00:41:11,129
it takes for you to kill her,

348
00:41:11,204 --> 00:41:14,264
I will have all the time I need to kill you.

349
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:23,174
I got you.

350
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,343
Yes, you did,

351
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:27,853
but I also got you.

352
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,661
Isabel?

353
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,028
I'm a friend of your mom.

354
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:42,466
Can you wait outside?

355
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:44,731
Okay.

356
00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:54,346
Good-bye, mister.

357
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:06,983
What did you do to me?

358
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:09,858
I put a needle in your neck.

359
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:15,527
- That's it?
- In a certain point, very forbidden.

360
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:18,662
It's called
"The Kiss of the Dragon."

361
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:22,004
Kiss my ass!

362
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:25,169
The blood from your whole body
goes to your head.

363
00:42:25,245 --> 00:42:28,840
It stops there, never comes down.

364
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,847
But soon it will come out from your nose,

365
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,948
your ears, even from your eyes.

366
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:44,224
And then...
you will die, painfully.

367
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:49,335
You're really a smart guy, Johnny Boy.

368
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:53,133
My name is not Johnny.

369
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:58,297
- I slept long?
- Only a minute.

370
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
My daughter...
