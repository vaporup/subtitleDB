00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:45,861
- First time to France?
- Yes.

2
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,806
Purpose of your visit?

3
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:55,242
- Business or pleasure?
- Pleasure.

4
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:13,819
Don't you blame it on I

5
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,829
Don't you blame it on I and I

6
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:26,438
Don't you blame it on I, I tell ya

7
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:34,075
Don't you blame it on Rastafari

8
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:36,914
Do you like this music? No?

9
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,751
Yeah, yeah.

10
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:45,420
They blame it on I and I

11
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:47,429
No

12
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:57,667
They blame it on Rastafari

13
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,648
Je peux vous aider?

14
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:07,943
You can put your things over there.

15
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:34,765
How long are you planning on staying?

16
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,374
Not very long.

17
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,943
Message for Mr. Smith.

18
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,912
- Smith?
- Yes.

19
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:24,582
Smith.

20
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:27,521
Ah.

21
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:40,169
He's here.

22
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,100
Monsieur, good evening.
Anything to drink?

23
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,103
- Water.
- Sparkling or flat?

24
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:17,706
Flat.

25
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,851
- Last one for the road.
- A beer?

26
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,013
Oh, yes.

27
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:34,022
So, how are you, pal?

28
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:38,356
Just a little pre-take off take off.

29
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:41,864
Gives new meaning to
"flying the friendly skies."

30
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:45,800
- Can I buy you a drink? A serious drink?
- No, thank you.

31
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:48,838
- Where are you from? Ah, China.
- Beijing.

32
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:50,998
My favorite. I love China.

33
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:53,167
I love the food... Chinese food.
It's the best.

34
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:55,939
Yeah, the way they cut things
in little pieces...

35
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:59,948
so that you don't have to
use all that heavy silverware.

36
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:03,315
Brilliant invention, the chopstick.
Not like us barbarians.

37
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:06,378
I mean, there we are,
sticking our forks into the food...

38
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:10,017
and hacking it up
with our knives.

39
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:12,152
- First time in Paris?
- Yes.

40
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:15,663
Mmm. Great.

41
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:21,270
Men's toilet, now.

42
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,238
You're gonna have
the time of your life.

43
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:10,945
Hands up, please.

44
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:07,266
My boss is dying to meet you.

45
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:27,024
Ahh.

46
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,011
Gun, please.

47
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:53,988
You won't need it.
You're safe with us.

48
00:09:57,727 --> 00:10:02,687
So, you came all the way from China
to keep an eye on us.

49
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,200
- To help you.
- Yes, of course.

50
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:09,329
To help us,
since we are so incompetent.

51
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:11,601
'Cause after all,
what is our miserable history...

52
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:14,007
compared to yours?

53
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,415
Since we have to work together, I don't want
to spend half the day killing your name.

54
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:23,111
- You got a nickname?
- No.

55
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:26,155
Why don't we give you one.
How about John?

56
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:28,156
I like that.

57
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,693
Richard.

58
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:34,525
Inspector Richard.

59
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,031
Welcome to Paris, Johnny.

60
00:10:57,153 --> 00:11:00,554
So, what's on the menu tonight?

61
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,121
They're talking about
the stock market.

62
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:14,896
What fuckin' time do you call this?
Don't ever keep me waiting.

63
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:18,134
You got me?
Come on. Let's go.

64
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:31,119
Ah, there you are.

65
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:33,246
Smile. Smile.

66
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,820
Welcome to gay Paris.

67
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:41,022
This is a few friends of mine.
This is Veronica, Susan.

68
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:43,224
Say hello.

69
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,333
Yeah, sit, sit.

70
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,237
Hey, cool it.
Hey, fuckin' cool it, all right?

71
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,437
I think we have a situation.

72
00:11:56,513 --> 00:11:58,413
One man, two girls.

73
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:00,472
- You see them?
- Yes, I do.

74
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:08,525
Want to go to Heaven?

75
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:09,514
Want to go to Heaven?

76
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:18,967
Let's go.

77
00:12:21,237 --> 00:12:23,228
- I'm going up.
- But, boss, the meeting.

78
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:28,437
I flew 12,000 miles for a cocksucker
of a contact. He can wait for me!

79
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,741
I don't know if I can do this.

80
00:12:30,814 --> 00:12:34,250
Don't wory.
Let Mama run the show.

81
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,581
- Hmm?
- Okay, let's go to Heaven.

82
00:12:38,354 --> 00:12:42,688
He's leaving with the two hookers.
What should I do?

83
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:46,422
Come up... and enjoy the show.

84
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:48,327
Wow!

85
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:02,841
- Boss, we didn't check the room.
- One minute.

86
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:09,508
Let's party, big boy.

87
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:17,752
Come on, baby. Let's have some fun.

88
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:22,225
- I don't feel so good.
- Want a fix?

89
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:25,631
- No! I told you, I quit.
- More for me.

90
00:13:55,598 --> 00:13:57,532
Your meeting's up, guys!
Everybody, out!

91
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
But, boss, we didn't
finish searching.

92
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:03,197
- Get out!
- Okay, guys, let's get out of here.

93
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,910
I have to go to the bathroom, okay?

94
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:46,745
- Yes, yes. Come back soon.
- Sure.

95
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:55,457
Oh, hey, Johnny.
Just in time.

96
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:58,026
- This wasn't part of the plan.
- It is now. Don't worry.

97
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:01,995
It's all under control.
He'll do his thing, then we'll do ours.

98
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:05,501
- Where's the other girl?
- Prettying up in the bathroom.

99
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,454
- You want to go to Heaven?
- Take me to Heaven!

100
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:36,024
I'm going! Yes! Yes!

101
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,591
I'm going!

102
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:43,370
No!

103
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:05,727
You motherfucker!
Let me up!

104
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:16,162
She stabbed me!
The dumb bitch stabbed me!

105
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:19,037
Stay calm.

106
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,372
Stay calm. Stay calm.

107
00:16:25,782 --> 00:16:28,649
I'm dying.

108
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:37,886
Stop recording.

109
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:40,485
- Fuck!
- We need to get him to the hospital.

110
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:43,326
He doesn't wanna go to a hospital.

111
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,993
He wants to go to Heaven.

112
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:55,269
- Why did you kill him?
- The question is, why did you kill him?

113
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:58,074
Richard, look what he did to me!
Help me!

114
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:03,047
Thanks for the help, Johnny.

115
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:23,802
I was just in here.

116
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:27,070
I felt a little sick, and then there was
all this screaming and shooting and...

117
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:29,577
Shut up!

118
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:31,272
There!

119
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,218
He's on the fifth floor.
Everyone, down.

120
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:20,929
He's on the eighth floor.
Everybody, back up!

121
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:55,359
I want him dead!

122
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:29,497
He's in the laundry room!
Everyone, down!

123
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:32,398
- He's down in the laundry room!
Everybody, down!
- You, down!

124
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:34,561
Boss I think...

125
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:38,736
You! And don't think!

126
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,850
You and you, go to the next level!

127
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:58,917
You know, the Chinese have the best
roasting methods in the world.

128
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:01,987
But I prefer the French one.

129
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:04,362
Give me your lighter.

130
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:08,067
What do they say, Johnny?

131
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:11,868
Out of the frying pan,
into the fire.

132
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:22,050
- Get 'em out of here!
- Go!

133
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:29,220
Down, you piece of shit!

134
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:35,263
- You're still with us, Johnny?
- Yes.

135
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:43,233
All right, Johnny.
You wanna play?

136
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:45,240
Give me a green one.

137
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:58,218
No!

138
00:20:58,287 --> 00:21:01,381
Oh, shit! It's in my sweeter!
Help me with this!

139
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:10,664
Go!

140
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:21,971
You're dead.

141
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,670
Shit!

142
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,372
- He's gone.
- I can see that.

143
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,584
He... He got the cassette.

144
00:23:43,652 --> 00:23:45,711
So what?

145
00:23:45,788 --> 00:23:49,383
They show nothing but a fat degenerate
with some hooker killing him.

146
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:53,622
- Except that...
- What?

147
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:56,130
One... One machine was still running.

148
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:58,257
Fuck!

149
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:02,901
Turn the city inside out.
Look at the cardinal's ass.

150
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:06,032
I don't care!
Find it!

151
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:08,701
- Get the cassette!
- And kill him?

152
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:11,075
No, bring him to me.
I want him alive.

153
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:13,114
I'll kill him myself.
Go!

154
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:25,920
Nothing's on one.
We're still looking. Shit.

155
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:13,469
Gare de l'Est.
It's a train station.

156
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:18,980
Take the direction Bibliotheque
until Chatelet. You change.

157
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:23,348
And you take line number four and...
Yes, yes.

158
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:26,888
Direction Porte de Clignancourt,
and you're right there.

159
00:25:26,956 --> 00:25:29,356
Okay? Yes.

160
00:26:16,505 --> 00:26:18,769
Excuse me.

161
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:25,971
Thank you for coming.

162
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:30,944
In the name of the president, I want
to personally apologize for this mess.

163
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:34,073
I want to stress that we would
not want anything like this...

164
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:38,313
to jeopardize the warm relation
and successful economic ties...

165
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,354
shared by our two countries.

166
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:45,023
So...

167
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:48,427
we have assigned our best man
to supervise this case.

168
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:54,060
He handled the Tehran incident
for us masterfully. And Teneriffe too.

169
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:57,128
There is no one more qualified
to bring this...

170
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:59,504
to a mutually
beneficial conclusion.

171
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:02,703
- Inspector Richard. Bonjour.
- Sir Minister.

172
00:28:02,778 --> 00:28:07,681
This is Minister Tang, our liaison
from the People's Republic of China.

173
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,446
- It's an honor to meet you, sir.
- The honor is ours.

174
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:14,017
The minister tells us
you are the best of the best.

175
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:16,523
Well, the minister is too kind.
If that were true,

176
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:18,992
I might have been able
to avoid this tragedy.

177
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:22,053
I'm hoping that you might help us
understand what went wrong...

178
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:24,065
so that we can avoid
further bloodshed.

179
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:27,500
And hopefully, bring this matter to
a quick and satisfactory conclusion.

180
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:29,662
If we could be showed the facts.

181
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:32,002
Yes, of course.
Please.

182
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:36,403
Uh, as you know,
as soon as you informed us...

183
00:28:36,478 --> 00:28:41,074
of the criminal activities of the gangster Sung,
we set our operation in motion.

184
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,675
We identified his heroin
smuggling routes into France.

185
00:28:43,786 --> 00:28:47,244
And in the spirit of cooperation,
we graciously accepted your offer...

186
00:28:47,356 --> 00:28:53,056
to have one of your people,
Liu Jian, come over...

187
00:28:53,128 --> 00:28:56,791
to assist us in Sung's arrest as he
was meeting with his French contact,

188
00:28:56,865 --> 00:29:00,164
who unfortunately
we haven't yet identified.

189
00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:02,430
Here...

190
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:07,305
he is surveilling Sung as we were
waiting for the contact to arrive.

191
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:11,335
And here, he's observing
along with us.

192
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:15,577
And then, for some reason we still can't
understand, he went completely insane.

193
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:17,585
Left the room to pee,
and next thing we know...

194
00:29:17,686 --> 00:29:21,713
he's knocked out the bodyguards,
killed Sung and the prostitute.

195
00:29:24,193 --> 00:29:26,991
This is the gun
he used to murder Sung.

196
00:29:27,062 --> 00:29:29,622
Chinese police issue.
Do you recognize it?

197
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:32,064
- Yes.
- Good.

198
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:35,001
Oh, we have also verified
his fingerprints on the weapon.

199
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:42,170
Well, please, feel free to verify
our findings with your own people.

200
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:45,213
We assume that your man was
part of the conspiracy...

201
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,215
that he murdered Sung to
keep him from being captured...

202
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:50,751
and testifying in your courts,
as you had requested.

203
00:29:50,853 --> 00:29:52,980
But that is only an assumption.

204
00:29:53,088 --> 00:29:55,056
We are hoping you could give us
some background on him...

205
00:29:55,157 --> 00:29:57,455
which would help us in his capture.

206
00:29:57,526 --> 00:30:01,053
Inspector Liu Jian was top in
all his classes at the academy.

207
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:04,963
He received the highest training
in martial arts, weapons and police tactics.

208
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:08,298
He's been decorated for bravery
in the line of duty six times,

209
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:12,204
been promoted five times,
and has never lost a case.

210
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:14,208
He has no wife, no children.

211
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:16,540
His only dedication
is to his work.

212
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:19,103
He's our best,

213
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:22,582
which is why
this is all so confusing.

214
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:26,313
Well, you know, sometimes
the best are also the worst.

215
00:30:26,421 --> 00:30:28,355
It's really sad.

216
00:30:29,925 --> 00:30:32,951
Any surveillance cassettes?

217
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:35,552
Destroyed as he made his escape.

218
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:38,794
Do you know if he has any relatives
in Paris? Any friends or...

219
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:41,392
He has no one.

220
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,404
Well, then we should be able
to wrap this up very soon.

221
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,607
Excuse me.

222
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,644
I found the emergency phone.

223
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:54,849
Oh, that's good news.

224
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:57,112
Stay by the phone.
I'll call you back later.

225
00:31:00,856 --> 00:31:04,019
Inspector Richard,
we are very sorry that the...

226
00:31:04,092 --> 00:31:06,686
...operation was sabotaged.

227
00:31:06,762 --> 00:31:10,960
I will report back to my superiors
and get you any help I can.

228
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:13,762
- Thank you.
- Let me show you out.

229
00:31:18,307 --> 00:31:21,276
I want them followed.
I want their phones tapped.

230
00:31:21,343 --> 00:31:25,245
I want to know every move they make,
every word they speak.

231
00:31:25,314 --> 00:31:29,842
There must be a sleeper he's
staying with in Paris. Find him.

232
00:31:31,186 --> 00:31:33,120
So, I guess you will be staying...

233
00:31:33,188 --> 00:31:35,156
longer than you expected.

234
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:37,817
A little longer.

235
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:40,794
Paris is a nice city
once you get used to it.

236
00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:47,967
And the French are nice people
once you get used to them.

237
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:57,078
- Are you hungry?
- No.

238
00:32:01,116 --> 00:32:03,516
Family recipe.
Very tasty.

239
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,993
Fifty men on the street,
and you can't find this son of a bitch?

240
00:32:22,104 --> 00:32:25,073
- Did you try his hotel?
- The fuck never checked in.

241
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,301
"The fuck never checked in."

242
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:30,311
That means he has a friend in Paris,
or family. Even better.

243
00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:33,837
- Who tried Chinatown?
- Here. But it's hard to be discreet.

244
00:32:33,915 --> 00:32:37,681
So put on a wig and a kimono. I don't care
how you do it. Now, get out. Get out!

245
00:32:37,753 --> 00:32:41,689
Get out! I want that little prick
in my office by tonight!

246
00:32:46,261 --> 00:32:48,661
Oh, Jessica, my love.

247
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:50,698
Come to Papa. Come.

248
00:32:53,602 --> 00:32:55,832
Richard, I tried.

249
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:58,737
I really tried.
I was only in the bathroom for a minute.

250
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:02,174
You know, I was getting
ready to do my part...

251
00:33:02,244 --> 00:33:04,405
Getting ready to do what it was
that I said that I would...

252
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:07,073
What you wanted... I really... I really...

253
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:09,879
I really was ready to do what it was...
what you wanted...

254
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:11,885
Jessica. Jessica.

255
00:33:11,953 --> 00:33:14,888
I know you were. I know, I know.

256
00:33:14,956 --> 00:33:17,584
Coming from such a quiet place
as North Dakota,

257
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:19,923
you must have been so scared.

258
00:33:19,995 --> 00:33:22,555
- Richard, I tried. I...
- I know.

259
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:24,632
- I tried. I really did.
- I know you did.

260
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:29,363
All that noise.
My poor little farmer's daughter.

261
00:33:31,273 --> 00:33:33,332
Don't be scared.

262
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:35,342
You're the best girl I have.

263
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:39,077
And you know how
I treat my best girl.

264
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:42,082
I know.

265
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:46,487
So you'll keep your promise?

266
00:33:48,557 --> 00:33:50,548
Promise?

267
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:53,185
Did I make a promise?

268
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:56,196
Yes... Yes. You said that
if I did it one more time,

269
00:33:56,298 --> 00:33:58,766
that you would let me...
let me have my daughter back.

270
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:02,303
- You said that you'd help me
get the papers to get her out.
- Did I say that?

271
00:34:03,705 --> 00:34:07,471
- Yes.
- Did I say that, Max?

272
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:09,476
Oh, yes, you did.

273
00:34:10,946 --> 00:34:13,540
Well, there you go.
Two to one.

274
00:34:15,717 --> 00:34:20,450
I guess you're right. So I'll have
to let you go, you and your precious.

275
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:27,724
Do you realize how much I must trust you
to let you go just like that?

276
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:31,562
With everything you know?
Everything you've seen?

277
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:35,102
One phone call from you, one word,
and I'd be locked up for the rest of my life!

278
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:38,537
I'd never do that!
I'd never give you up, ever!

279
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:42,065
I know that. If I didn't
trust you, would I let you go?

280
00:34:42,144 --> 00:34:46,808
- What is he doing?
- I don't know. What are you doing, Max?

281
00:34:46,882 --> 00:34:50,045
- I'm preparing a fix.
- He's preparing a fix. Do you want a taste?

282
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:52,746
Richard, I told you I quit.
You know I quit.

283
00:34:55,957 --> 00:34:57,891
I don't want it anymore!
I quit!

284
00:34:57,959 --> 00:35:00,928
You don't tell me when
you're gonna quit! I tell you!

285
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:04,557
You don't tell me what you want!
I tell you!

286
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:08,602
How long will it take for a fucking junkie
like you to betray me for a lousy fix?

287
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,934
I won't betray you!
Please, don't!

288
00:35:11,006 --> 00:35:14,806
"I won't betray you! Please, don't!"

289
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:39,666
Put her back to work.

290
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:41,861
Come on. Come on.

291
00:35:49,377 --> 00:35:53,541
Get the fuck out. Come on.
Move your fuckin' ass.

292
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:04,421
Get to work, you fuckin' animals!
You cocksucking pigs.

293
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,085
You play mah-jongg?

294
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:35,213
A little.

295
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,315
I love mah-jongg.

296
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:39,451
Keeps the mind sharp.

297
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:42,758
It's hard to find
good players around here.

298
00:36:42,864 --> 00:36:45,731
That's why I play by myself.

299
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,570
This way, I always win.

300
00:36:50,538 --> 00:36:51,903
Bitch!

301
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,567
I'm gone for five minutes,

302
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:58,874
and you think you can park
your skinny ass in my spot?

303
00:36:58,947 --> 00:37:03,247
Fuck off.
You want some more?

304
00:37:06,821 --> 00:37:09,449
She...

305
00:37:09,524 --> 00:37:12,322
She broke my nose!

306
00:37:12,394 --> 00:37:14,362
Come on! Look at you!

307
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:16,363
- Ow!
- Eh?

308
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,499
I haven't been home for 15 years.

309
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:23,594
- Ow!
- That's a long time.

310
00:37:23,672 --> 00:37:26,698
- You stupid piece of shit.
- I have seven grandchildren I have never seen.

311
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,498
One 1 year...

312
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:32,770
- You are a fucking dog.
- Two twins 3...

313
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:34,815
- All right?
- Three boys 5, 7 and 9.

314
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:37,317
Get back to work.

315
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:39,117
Oh, almost 9 and 1/2 now.

316
00:37:41,356 --> 00:37:44,018
And one big girl 14 years of age.

317
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:46,959
Almost a woman now.

318
00:37:47,028 --> 00:37:49,963
She wants to come to Paris.

319
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:53,023
She goes to university.

320
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:55,228
Hey! Go away! Go away!

321
00:37:55,303 --> 00:37:58,739
- Please.
- You don't know these women.

322
00:37:58,807 --> 00:38:01,708
They say they want to use the bathroom to pee,
and next thing they're shooting up.

323
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,541
She only hurts herself.
Please, don't draw attention.

324
00:38:17,258 --> 00:38:19,818
Huh.

325
00:38:55,262 --> 00:38:56,000
Excuse me.

326
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,056
- Can I use your toilet?
- No.

327
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:03,400
Oh, please. I just...
I only have to pee. I won't be long.

328
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:04,000
No!

329
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,672
Okay.

330
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:14,000
Wait!

331
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,800
What are you doing?

332
00:39:16,985 --> 00:39:19,351
Well, if you're gonna treat me
like a dog, I'm gonna act like a dog.

333
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:22,254
- I'm gonna pee right here.
- Stop!

334
00:39:22,323 --> 00:39:24,883
Okay.

335
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:28,053
There.

336
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:31,298
Thank you. Thank you.

337
00:39:31,366 --> 00:39:33,596
Thank you so much.

338
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:40,706
- But nothing else.
- I'm not gonna do anything else, I promise.

339
00:39:40,775 --> 00:39:42,766
- Do you wanna check?
- No.

340
00:39:44,045 --> 00:39:46,479
- Just hurry.
- I'm sorry to have to force you to.

341
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:49,449
It's just I have got to go so bad.
I really...

342
00:39:49,517 --> 00:39:51,917
- I'm only... I'm only gonna be a minute.
- Okay.

343
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,759
I'm Lo, the chef.
I came for my order.

344
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:03,992
Oh! That feels so good.

345
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:10,037
- How many?
- Uh, one, two,

346
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:14,473
uh, three, four...

347
00:40:14,576 --> 00:40:18,068
- I owe...
- Don't wory about paying. Come back later, okay?

348
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:21,376
Come back later. Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.

349
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:30,219
Miss, you have to finish now.

350
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:33,158
Minute's up.

351
00:40:33,228 --> 00:40:35,890
You have to leave!

352
00:40:35,964 --> 00:40:37,898
Miss?

353
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:43,028
Miss? Please.

354
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,884
Miss?

355
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:06,988
- I slept long?
- Only a minute.

356
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:09,052
Oh, that's good.

357
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,155
I've gotta get back to work.

358
00:41:11,232 --> 00:41:14,463
Every 15 minutes they come by in a
fuckin' car, and if I'm not out there...

359
00:41:14,536 --> 00:41:17,937
It's just that I'm so tired.
They gave me this shot and...

360
00:41:18,006 --> 00:41:21,066
Oh, my God.
Are you gonna finish this?

361
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,711
- This is pretty good. Did you make this yourself?
- Yes.

362
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,874
- Is that what you do, then? You cook, huh?
- No.

363
00:41:28,983 --> 00:41:31,451
- But you make these chips, right?
- My uncle does.

364
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,352
I love those chips. Do you mind?
I love the pink ones.

365
00:41:34,422 --> 00:41:37,755
My daughter loves the blue ones.
That's her favorite color.

366
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:40,089
Miss, you really have to go now.

367
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:42,493
Mmm!

368
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:44,532
Delicious. I'm sorry.

369
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:46,794
- It's not every day I get to eat in a Chinese restaurant.
- Here.

370
00:41:46,868 --> 00:41:49,132
One for you, one for your daughter.

371
00:41:49,203 --> 00:41:52,900
Oh, my God.
This is so nice.

372
00:41:52,974 --> 00:41:57,536
You're the first person that's been
kind to me since I've been in Paris.

373
00:41:57,645 --> 00:42:00,614
Look, I-I... I don't like
to take things from people.

374
00:42:00,715 --> 00:42:03,377
Usually I like
to pay my own way, so...

375
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:06,887
maybe later on,
if you wanna, you know...

376
00:42:08,356 --> 00:42:11,655
- No charge?
- No. Thank you.

377
00:42:11,726 --> 00:42:13,660
I don't have any other way
to repay you.

378
00:42:13,728 --> 00:42:17,425
- Don't worry.
- I'm not your type. Is that it?

379
00:42:17,498 --> 00:42:19,591
I don't have type.

380
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:25,664
Miss?

381
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,334
I'm sorry for hitting you.

382
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:31,777
That's okay.
I'm used to it.

383
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:15,000
Quai de l´Alma. In one hour.

384
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,800
Follow me.

385
00:44:13,114 --> 00:44:15,139
He's on board.

386
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:18,151
Let's go.

387
00:44:35,336 --> 00:44:37,497
Tell me everything.

388
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:41,934
Richard, the cop in charge,
set up the whole thing.

389
00:44:43,644 --> 00:44:47,410
- He is the connection.
- Do you have proof?

390
00:44:48,816 --> 00:44:50,750
They recorded everything.

391
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:54,754
They said that, uh,
you destroyed all the cassettes.

392
00:44:54,822 --> 00:44:57,416
Except one.

393
00:45:00,261 --> 00:45:02,286
Hand it to me, carefully.

394
00:45:16,177 --> 00:45:19,772
The main thing now is to get you
out of the country. I have a car.

395
00:45:19,847 --> 00:45:22,077
We can go to the airport,
and from there we can...

396
00:45:23,892 --> 00:45:27,842
Poussez-vous! Police!
Poussez-vous devant! Police!

397
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:31,515
Dégage! A la vite, dégage!
- Bouge pas toi! Bouge pas!

398
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:35,481
Mets tes mains sur la tete, connard!
- Pose ta tete sur la table!

399
00:45:35,529 --> 00:45:39,064
Pose ta tete!
- Pose ta tete! Bouge plus!

400
00:45:47,082 --> 00:45:50,202
A la cuisine!

401
00:48:04,378 --> 00:48:07,905
Shit!
He's under the bridge!
