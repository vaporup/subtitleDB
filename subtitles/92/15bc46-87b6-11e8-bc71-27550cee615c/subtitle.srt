1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,700
Okay, game point. 15-14.
This team serves.

2
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,700
Let's go. Service!

3
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,300
Come on! Come on!

4
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,900
Keep it up! Let's go!
Teamwork! Keep playing!

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,000
- Hit it to Carrie! She'll blow it!
- Don't blow it, Carrie! Hit it!

6
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,800
- Carrie...!
- She blew it again!

7
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,600
- We almost had the game!
- We can't win with her on the team.

8
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,200
Look at her! Just standing there!

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,600
You eat shit!

10
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,700
Help me! Help me!

11
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
Help me!

12
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Aah!

13
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,600
Help me! Help me!

14
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,700
Have a Tampax!

15
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,900
Help me!

16
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,200
Help me! Help me!

17
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
Help me!

18
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,700
Gross! Gross!

19
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,500
Carrie! Here! Plug it up! Plug it up!

20
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,300
Plug it up! Plug it up!

21
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,800
Plug it up! Plug it up!

22
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,300
Plug it up! Plug it up!

23
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Plug it up! Plug it up!

24
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Plug it up! Plug it up!

25
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,700
What's happening?

26
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,100
Plug it up! Plug it up!

27
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,500
Plug it up! Plug it up!

28
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,200
Plug it up! Plug it up!

29
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,800
- Sue! What are you doing?!
- Carrie... she just got her period!

30
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,900
- Who's got her period?
- Carrie.

31
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,300
What are you doing?!

32
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,300
Plug it up! Plug it up!

33
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,200
Plug it up! Plug it up!

34
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,900
Plug it up! Plug it up!

35
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,700
Carrie! Come on, Carrie!

36
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Carrie, quit it! Come on!

37
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,100
Stop it! Now relax! Calm down.
Listen to me.

38
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,200
It's okay. It's okay. Just stand up
and take care of yourself. Come on.

39
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,400
Grow up. Stand up and take care
of yourself. Come on, do it. Do it.

40
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,300
- Do it!
- Aah!

41
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,200
Did you see that?

42
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,600
No...!

43
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,700
Get out of here. Go on. Right now. Move!

44
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,100
Carrie...

45
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Carrie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't know, okay? I'm sorry.

46
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,600
Baby, come on, now. Don't you know?

47
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,700
I'm gonna talk to you about it.
Now just calm down. Just relax.

48
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,800
See? They're all gone. They're all gone.

49
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,000
It's gonna be okay.

50
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,200
- Isn't she a bit old for her, uh...
- Her first period.

51
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,000
Um... yes.

52
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,400
Morty, until a half-hour ago, I don't even
think she knew there was such a thing.

53
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,200
It's really... hard to believe

54
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,100
a girl in high school
wouldn't know something.

55
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Uh, facts...

56
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,700
Well, she didn't.

57
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,300
But I don't know why that should
surprise us, knowing that mother of hers.

58
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,800
- We can't interfere with people's beliefs.
- I know, I know.

59
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,600
- As for the girls...
- Carrie's always been their scapegoat.

60
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,700
- You've got to do something.
- I will.

61
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,000
But see, the thing is, Morty, that, um...

62
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I knew how they felt.

63
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,500
The whole thing just made me
wanna take her and shake her, too.

64
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,200
- It was just her period, for God sake!
- Well, we'll send her home.

65
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,300
Miss Finch,
will you send in Cassie Wright?

66
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
It's Carrie White.

67
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,100
Come in, Cassie.

68
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,900
Carrie.

69
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Miss Finch, would you
bring in a dismissal slip?

70
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
I thought you might take
the rest of the day

71
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,800
and go home,
take care of yourself, Cassie.

72
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,800
We're all very sorry about this incident.

73
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,200
It's Carrie.

74
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,900
Thank you.

75
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,900
- Would you like to go to the infirmary?
- I think Carrie can go home.

76
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,100
Would you like a ride?
We could call you a cab.

77
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm sure she can walk home.

78
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,500
And, Carrie, you're dismissed from gym
for a week. Just take study hall instead.

79
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,500
We're all sorry about this, Cassie.

80
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
It's Carrie!

81
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie! Ha-ha!

82
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,300
Ohh!

83
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,800
Ohh! Ohh...

84
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,800
Were you in Chicago two years ago?

85
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,100
Chicago?

86
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes, Bill. Chicago.

87
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,500
Why, yes, I was living in Chicago.

88
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,100
- You knew that. I told you that, didn't l?
- No, you didn't. I found out.

89
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
You're looking at me so, uh, strangely...

90
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,400
Oh, Mrs White.

91
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,800
- How have you been, Mrs Snell?
- Fine.

92
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,200
- And the doctor?
- Fine.

93
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,900
- And your daughter?
- Sue is fine.

94
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,200
- Won't you come in, Mrs White?
- Oh, how kind of you.

95
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,900
- Carrie is in some of Sue's classes.
- Yes.

96
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,300
- Perhaps sometime she might like to visit.
- I'm here on the Lord's work, Mrs Snell.

97
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,500
Spreadin' the gospel of God's salvation
through Christ's blood.

98
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,600
Yes, of course.

99
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,700
I have something here I know is gonna
interest the doctor and you.

100
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,600
The teenager's path to salvation
through the cross of Jesus.

101
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,200
I don't think Sue would be very interested.

102
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,200
The children are wandering through the
wilderness of sin these days, Mrs Snell.

103
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,400
My Sue is a good girl.

104
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,500
These are godless times, Mrs Snell.

105
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I'll drink to that!

106
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,500
We'll... all read these.

107
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,300
Excuse me. Please sit down, Mrs White.

108
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,400
Hello?

109
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,700
Betty, can I call you back?
Margaret White is here.

110
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Are you accusing me...

111
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,500
White.

112
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,000
Just let me get rid of her
and I'll call you back.

113
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,100
And now... I'm going to kill you!

114
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,400
I have something here, Mrs Snell,
that I think you might profit from.

115
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,500
- Look, Mrs White, I'd like to contribute 5...
- Exodus.

116
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,200
$10.

117
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,900
I see.

118
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,200
I pray you find Jesus.

119
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,800
- Wasn't that Carrie White's mother?
- Hey, I didn't hear you come in.

120
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,400
What did she want?

121
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
Yes?

122
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,700
Yes?

123
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,300
Thank you.

124
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
I know you're listening.

125
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,300
Come on downstairs.

126
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Mama?

127
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,500
Who was that? Who called?

128
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
You're a woman now.

129
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,500
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

130
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Aah!

131
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,800
And God made Eve
from the rib of Adam

132
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,000
and Eve was weak and
loosed the raven on the world.

133
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
And the raven was called sin. Say it.

134
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,600
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

135
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,400
- Say it.
- No.

136
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,700
The raven was called sin.

137
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,400
No, Mama... And the raven was called sin!

138
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,700
And the first sin was intercourse.

139
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,300
First sin was intercourse.

140
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,700
I didn't sin, Mama.

141
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,300
- Say it!
- I didn't sin, Mama!

142
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,400
The first sin was intercourse.

143
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,600
First sin was intercourse.

144
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
First sin was intercourse.

145
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,400
And the first sin was intercourse!

146
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,400
I was so scared, I thought I was dyin'.
The girls, they all laughed at me, Mama.

147
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,200
- And Eve was weak. Say it.
- No, Mama!

148
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,800
- Eve was weak.
- No!

149
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,400
- Eve was weak.
- No!

150
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,700
- Eve was weak. Say it, woman.
- No, Mama!

151
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,600
Say it!

152
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,800
Eve was weak!

153
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,300
Eve was weak!

154
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,700
And the Lord visited Eve with a curse.

155
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,500
And the curse was the curse of blood!

156
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,300
You should have told me, Mama!
You should have told me!

157
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,400
O Lord!

158
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,700
Help the sinning woman
see the sin of her days and ways.

159
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,600
Show her that if she had remained sinless
the curse of blood would not be on her.

160
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,000
She may be tempted by the Antichrist.
She may have had lustful thoughts...

161
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,900
No, Mama!

162
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,200
Don't lie, Carrietta!
Don't you know I can see inside you?

163
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
I can see the sin as surely as God can!

164
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,300
- Let me go, Mama.
- We'll pray!

165
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,100
- We'll pray, woman!
- No!

166
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,900
Pray to Jesus for all the lustful,
sinning souls.

167
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,700
No!

168
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,300
God visited Eve with the curse.
And the curse was the curse of blood.

169
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,100
No, Mama!

170
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,500
And he visited Eve with the second curse.
And this was the curse of childbearing.

171
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,300
And Eve brought forth Cain
in sweat and blood.

172
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,800
Genesis 3:16!

173
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,100
Mama! Let me out!

174
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,400
Mama, please! Let me out!

175
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,100
Mama, please!

176
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,000
Let me out, Mama! God...!

177
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,800
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

178
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,100
Thy kingdom...

179
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
Thank you, Mama.

180
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,200
You can go to bed now.

181
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,600
There is power, power,
wonder-working power in the blood

182
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,300
of the lamb...

183
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Carrie?

184
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Carrie?

185
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,100
Carrie?

186
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,200
Carrie?

187
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,700
Carrie?

188
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,700
Open the door.

189
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,800
It's open, Mama.

190
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
What was that noise?

191
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,800
What noise?

192
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,000
Go to bed.

193
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,200
Yes, ma'am. Saying my prayers...

194
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,300
"What are you going to leave
for us, you people in your big cars,

195
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,100
spewing pollution into the air?"

196
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,100
"You people with heavy feet,

197
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,700
trampling down the wilderness."

198
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,600
"You people who peer into
the back seats of our cars,

199
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,600
hours after you come out
of the back doors of your motels."

200
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,200
"Soon all we will have is each other."

201
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
"And that could be enough."

202
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,800
"If you will let us have room enough

203
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,000
and air enough

204
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,300
and peace enough

205
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,100
to love each other

206
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,300
as you never could."

207
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Hm.

208
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,900
I... I really must say... I must confess

209
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,800
this poem displays
the most extraordinary talent.

210
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,500
Talent extraordinary for you,
Tommy Ross.

211
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,400
You know, Tommy,

212
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,600
this is slightly different from running
touchdowns and hitting home runs.

213
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,800
Class,

214
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
any criticisms?

215
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,800
Anyone?

216
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,100
It's beautiful.

217
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,900
Carrie White!

218
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,000
Beautiful.

219
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,100
Beautiful.

220
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,500
Beautiful!

221
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,800
"Oh, beautiful for spacious skies,

222
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,700
for amber waves of grain" !

223
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,200
Is that the beautiful you mean?
Is it, Carrie, hmm?

224
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,500
Well, Carrie, this is hardly a criticism.

225
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,200
You suck.

226
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,900
Tommy, did you say something, Tommy?

227
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,500
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

228
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,300
I said "Aw, shucks."

229
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,500
Roll call: Blake.

230
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,200
Present.

231
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,100
- Borne.

232
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200

- Hargenson.

235
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,700
- Litton.

236
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,100
- MacDermit.
- Present.

237
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,900

238
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,300

239
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,800
- Shires.

240
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,100

241
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,400
- Watson.
- Present.

242
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,500
- And the Wilsons.
- We're here.

243
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,500
Okay, line up.

244
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,300
Line up!

245
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,900
Move it!

246
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,500
On your feet right now! Two lines!

247
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,300
Alice and Mary, eyes front.

248
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,900
Katie...

249
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,200
You, too, Chris.

250
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,700
And spit out that gum.

251
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,400
- Where'll I put it, Miss Collins?
- You can choke on it for all I care.

252
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,700
Just get it out of your mouth.

253
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,700
Wipe that smirk off your face, Norma.

254
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,600
Okay. Now I want you all to know that
you did a really shitty thing yesterday,

255
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,000
a really shitty thing.

256
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,800
Did any of you ever stop to think
that Carrie White has feelings?

257
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Do any of you ever stop to think?

258
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,100
No, I guess you're too busy
thinking about your dates

259
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and the prom.

260
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,400
I guess you can take your pick, Chris.
Who's the lucky guy?

261
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,900
Billy Nolan.

262
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,800
- Who?
- Billy Nolan.

263
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,300
- I'm sorry, could you speak up?
- Billy Nolan.

264
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,500
Well, isn't he the lucky one!

265
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
What about you, Sue?

266
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,000
Who's taking you?

267
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,600
Tommy Ross.

268
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,900
Right.

269
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:59,000
Now, my idea for this little trick you pulled
was three days' suspension

270
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,500
and refusal of your prom tickets.

271
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,400
Oh!

272
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,700
What...?

273
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,400
God!

274
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,000
That'd get you where you live, wouldn't it?

275
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
And you deserve it.

276
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,100
I don't think any of you have any idea
of just how nasty what you did really was.

277
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But the office has decided
you're to have one week's detention.

278
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,400
Still, there's one little catch.

279
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,600
It's to be my detention.

280
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,900
That's 50 minutes

281
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,300
every day

282
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,100
starting today

283
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,900
on the athletic field.

284
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,400
Get the picture?

285
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,800
I'm not coming.

286
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
That's up to you, Chris.

287
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,100
That's up to all of you.

288
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,400
Punishment for skipping detention

289
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,100
is three days' suspension

290
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,200
and refusal of your prom tickets.

291
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Any other thoughts?

292
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,400
Good. Now change up.

293
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,000
Where are you going?

294
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,400
- Where you going?
- Gotta go.

295
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,400
- I'm not coming.
- You're really not gonna come?

296
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,600
- I'm not coming.
- You're gonna miss the prom.

297
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,500
Fuck!

298
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,500
And... 1 , 2, 3, 4.

299
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,500
2, 2, 3, 4.

300
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
3, 2, 3, 4.

301
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,500
4, 2, 3, 4.

302
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,400
5, 2...

303
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,400
Energy, Norma! Come on!

304
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
8, 2, 3, 4.

305
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,200
1 , 2, 3, 4.

306
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
2, 2, 3, 4.

307
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,000
3, 2, 3, 4.

308
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

309
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,800
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

310
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Stretch, Norma, stretch!

311
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,700
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

312
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,300
1 , 2,

313
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,600
bend, up.

314
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,900
Bend, up.

315
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,300
1 , 2.

316
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,500
1 , 2.

317
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,900
1 , 2.

318
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,000
Faster.

319
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
And 1 , 2.

320
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,100
1 , 2.

321
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,700
1 , 2, 1 ,

322
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,200
and 2

323
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,300
and 3

324
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,200
Uhh!

325
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,200
..and 4

326
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,900

1, 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2,

338
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,900
1, 2, 1 , 2,

339
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,300
1, 2, 1 , 2.

340
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,600
Get your knees up!

341
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,000
1, 2, 1 , 2,

342
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,300
1, 2, 1 , 2.

343
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,400
Come on, you hotshots!

344
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,500
She can't get away with this.

345
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
I'm gonna get her.

346
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,100
Let it go, Chris.

347
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Like hell I will.

348
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,400
1 , 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2.

349
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,500
The period's not up, Hargenson.

350
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,200
- It is for me.
- Keep running!

351
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,600
There are 10 minutes left.

352
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,700
Stick 'em up your...

353
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,400
You can't hit us!
You'll get canned for this,

354
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,500
you bitch!

355
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,300
One more word and I'll knock you down!

356
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,400
She can't get away with this
if we all stick together, Norma!

357
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,400
Helen?

358
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Sue?!

359
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,300
Shut up, Chris.

360
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,900
Just shut up.

361
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,400
This isn't over.

362
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,700
This isn't over by a long shot!

363
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,500
You're out of the prom, Hargenson.

364
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Okay, the show's over.

365
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,600
In place, run!

366
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,700
1 , 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2.

367
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,600
Hang 'em high! Hang 'em low!
Come on, Bates, let's go!

368
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,100
Hang 'em high! Hang 'em low!
Come on, Bates, let's go!

369
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,500
- Give me a B!
- B!

370
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,700
- Give me an A!
- A!

371
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,100
- Give me a T!
- T!

372
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,400
- Give me an E!
- E!

373
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,600
- Give me an S!
- S!

374
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Bates! Bates! Yeah!

375
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,500
- Guess who's entering the nationals?
- Are you kidding?

376
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Hey, terrific!

377
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
What's up?

378
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,900
Can I talk to you?

379
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,200
- Right now?
- It's real important.

380
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,200
All right.

381
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,100
Tommy, if I asked you to do something
very special for me,

382
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,000
would you do it?

383
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,900
Yeah.

384
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,300
I want you to take Carrie White
to the prom.

385
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
How's it looking there?

386
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,000
Ha ha ha!

387
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,100
Freddy!

388
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,500
Wanna go over to Minsky's
for some hard stuff?

389
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,900
No.

390
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,100
- Huh?
- Some other time, huh?

391
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,900
- You pussy!
- Gimme one of them beers!

392
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,200
- Suck on this, huh?
- All right!

393
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
Yee-hoo!

394
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,100
- Hey, man!
- Oh, man, those stripes!

395
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,000
Ooh!

396
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,100
Aah!

397
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,700
Yes!

398
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,500
Oh, shit.

399
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,700
Watch it, you stupid shit!

400
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,100
Don't call me that, huh?

401
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,000
Well, look what you did!

402
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,100
Stupid shit.

403
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,800
- I told you not to call me that.
- Look out!

404
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,500
Dumb punk!

405
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,300
- What, are you scared?
- What, do you want to get us killed?

406
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,700
Dumb shit.

407
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,100
You fuck!

408
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,000
Okay, I'll do it.

409
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,800
Take the streets!

410
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,200
Hi, friend! What's up?

411
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Don't be in such a hurry.

412
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,600
Oh.

413
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,700
Come on...

414
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,700
"Don't be in such a hurry."

415
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,900
- I'm hurrying away from you.
- No, you're not.

416
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,000
- Pain right in the ass.
- You don't mean that.

417
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,800
I don't mean that.

418
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,800
You're crazier than a son of a bitch.

419
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,200
Give me everything

420
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,600
Oh,

421
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
sweet sigh

422
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,100
Come here.

423
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,000
Oh, shit.

424
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,200
Ooh!

425
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,500
Mmm...

426
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,400
Mm!

427
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,300
Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you!

428
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,000
- Can't you wait a minute?
- Well, what for? We do this all the time.

429
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
You're so ignorant.

430
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,200
Yeah, but... that's what
you like about me, right?

431
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,500
I know that.

432
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,900
Shit.

433
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,800
No?

434
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,800
No?

435
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,200
I know what you like about me.

436
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,100
This.

437
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,500
Touch it.

438
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,700
No!

439
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,000
Dumb shit!

440
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:17,600
I told you never to call me that!
You are totally fucked up! You really are.

441
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,300
I'm convinced.

442
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,300
Billy...

443
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Come here.

444
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Billy... Come on.

445
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Come on.

446
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,800
I want you to do something...

447
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Something important.

448
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,200
Mm-hm?

449
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,800
Billy...

450
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,500
Billy...

451
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,900
Oh, Billy...

452
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,200
Billy...

453
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,100
Oh, Billy...

454
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Oh, Billy... Billy... Oh, Billy...

455
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Oh, Billy, I hate Carrie White.

456
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,700
Who?

457
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
Hi, Carrie.

458
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,700
Hi.

459
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,300
- How are you?
- Okay.

460
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,500
Good. Uh...

461
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
What are you doing?

462
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,800
Reading.

463
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,300
Yeah? What are you reading?

464
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
It's about, uh

465
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,800
sewing.

466
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Sewing. That's good.

467
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,100
Um...

468
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,900
If you don't have a date for the prom
next Friday,

469
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,800
would you like to go with me?

470
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:21,000
To the prom? It's next Friday. I know
this is late notice, but, uh... Carrie?

471
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Carrie, let...

472
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,600
You guys go on. Practise those drills
from yesterday. I'll be right there.

473
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Carrie?

474
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,700
Carrie.

475
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,100
Carrie, what's the matter?

476
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,900
- What happened?
- Nothin'.

477
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,800
Was it one of the girls?

478
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,700
Did one of the girls do something to you?

479
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,400
No.

480
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Well, what is it, then?

481
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,800
You can trust me. You know that?

482
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
Would you tell me?

483
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,500
I got invited to the prom.

484
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,400
That's great! That's fantastic!

485
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,400
So what are you moping around for?

486
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Tommy Ross asked me.

487
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,900
That's even better.

488
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,400
- He's really cute, huh?
- I know who he goes around with.

489
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,700
They're just trying
to trick me again, I know.

490
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,800
Maybe not.

491
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,700
I mean... maybe he really meant it.

492
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,400
Let's think about this, now.

493
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,800
It might be terrific.
You might have a really good time.

494
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Carrie?

495
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,500
Carrie, I wanna talk about this attitude
you have about yourself.

496
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,000
You're always walking around
with your hair down, all moping around.

497
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,600
Carrie?

498
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,700
Come here, you big silly.

499
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,900
I want you to look at yourself.

500
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,700
Would you look at that?

501
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,800
Come on.

502
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
Now that's a pretty girl.

503
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
Look at your eyes!

504
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,700
Little mascara to bring it out? Little?

505
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,000
Your lips. Try some lipstick.
You have nice, pretty lips.

506
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,700
And your cheekbones.

507
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,100
Look at your hair. It's beautiful hair. You
could just put it up a little, add a little curl.

508
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,900
What do you think?

509
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,900
Yeah!

510
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,300
Well?

511
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Well, what do you wanna know?

512
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,800
Why Tommy asked her to the prom.

513
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,400
Well?

514
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
I asked him to.

515
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,200
Why?

516
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,400
What for?

517
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,700
What could you possibly
have had in mind?

518
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,700
I thought it would be a good thing for
Carrie, to join in and be with people...

519
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,300
- Make her a part of things?
- Right.

520
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Come on, Sue.

521
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
We're not that stupid.

522
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,700
- Neither is Carrie.
- That means... I don't know.

523
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,600
You mean you're not gonna go.
Stay home and miss your own prom?

524
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,000
Come in.

525
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,800
- What is it?
- The attendance sheets, Miss Collins.

526
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,000
You know you can't go without a date.

527
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,700
Is there anything else, Norma?

528
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,100
- No, Miss Collins.
- Thank you, Norma.

529
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,300
Which brings us to you.

530
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,500
- I have to get to practice.
- Well, that's too bad.

531
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,300
- If you don't mind, it's between Sue and l.
- But I do mind... unless, of course,

532
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,300
you'd like to continue this little
discussion in Mr Morton's office.

533
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
What is the big deal?!

534
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,800
Because it is a very big deal
for Carrie White, and you know it.

535
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
She already said no, anyway.

536
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,200
- Yeah, well, you can change that.
- Don't count your chickens.

537
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,200
- Just don't try...
- Fine. I won't try.

538
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,700
Wait a second! It's not fine!

539
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,800
You can't order someone
not to take someone to the prom!

540
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,200
I can make sure you don't hurt
Carrie White any more.

541
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,200
We're not trying to hurt her, Miss Collins.
We're trying to help her!

542
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
How?!

543
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,900
Hey, Tommy, um... Don't you think
you'll look a little ridiculous

544
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,400
when you walk in the prom
with Carrie White?

545
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,000
We don't care how we look.

546
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Do we?

547
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,700
What?

548
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,200
I...

549
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,700
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hi.

550
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,200
So this is where you live, huh?

551
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,100
- What are you doing here?
- You gonna ask me in?

552
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,200
Why not?

553
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Mama's resting.

554
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,600
- What do you want?
- God, right to the point. Um...

555
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,400
- About the prom...
- I already told you.

556
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,600
- But you can change your mind.
- Why are you doing this?

557
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
- Cos I want to.
- No, you're not.

558
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,700
I don't do anything I don't want.

559
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,700
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

560
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,800
Carrie!

561
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,300
- You'd better go.
- Not till you say yes.

562
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,800
- No. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

563
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
I said I can't.

564
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Carrie!

565
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
Yes, you can.

566
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,900
- Will you please go?
- Not till you say yes.

567
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,200
Why is this so important to you?

568
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,000
I don't know.

569
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,900
Maybe because, um... you liked my poem.

570
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
Carrie!

571
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,800
- Okay, okay, I'll go.
- Good. I'll pick you up at 8 o'clock.

572
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,000
Okay.

573
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,100
What's the matter, Willie?

574
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,200
We gonna wake up the little piggies?
Oink, oink!

575
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,600
You know, this is a hell of a risk for a joke.

576
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,900
- You want out?
- No, no. It's a good joke. It's a good joke.

577
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Look at this!

578
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,100
- What?
- All these pigs!

579
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,100
What are you talking about?

580
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,200
These painted pigs!

581
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,400
Lauren Hanky's nitwit cousin
painted them.

582
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,600
Shh!

583
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,900
I went out with the girl that posed for 'em.
She was a real pig!

584
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,500
- Will you shut up?!
- Will you let me up there?

585
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,200
You're gonna kill that pig, right?

586
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,300
Piggy!

587
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
Here, piggy!

588
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,200
I'm gonna bash your little heads in,

589
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,800
and you don't have to worry
about the bomb no more.

590
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,000
Come here, little piggy!
Come here, you little sucker!

591
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,100
- Will you shut up and do it!
- We gotta give it a chance to burn!

592
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,500
- Oh, yeah?
- Come here, piggy!

593
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,600
You can't do it standin' out here.
Get 'er done, man, get 'er done.

594
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,400
- I can't. I can't. You.
- Oh, I knew this would happen!

595
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,200
- Just... hold it there, you pig. You fuck-up!
- Do it, Billy!

596
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
- And you shut up!
- Just do it!

597
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,200
All right, move it out, move it out!
That's it! Come on! Move it out!

598
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,700
Yeah, that's my baby! Yeah!

599
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,300
Do it!

600
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,300
Do it!

601
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,500
Do it!

602
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,100
Carrie, you haven't touched
your apple cake.

603
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Gives me pimples, Mama.

604
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,300
Pimples are the Lord's way
of chastising you.

605
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,100
- Mama?
- Yeah?

606
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:40,500
Mama, please see that I've gotta
try and get along with people.

607
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,000
What are you going on about, Carrie?

608
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,900
I've been invited to the prom.

609
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,000
The prom?

610
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,500
Yeah, the senior prom. Everybody's goin'.

611
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,700
It's that teacher that called... wasn't it?

612
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,100
Please say I'm not like you, Mama.

613
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,100
I'm funny. All the kids think I'm funny.

614
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,500
I wanna be normal.

615
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,900
I wanna try and be a whole person
before it's too late for...

616
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,700
His name is Tommy Ross.

617
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,400
- He's a very nice boy.
- No.

618
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,600
- He promised to stop in and meet you.
- I said no.

619
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,200
- Mama, I've accepted. I've accepted.
- I said no. No, no, no!

620
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
I've accepted!

621
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,500
- Come to your closet.
- No.

622
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,400
- After all you've been taught...
- Everyone isn't bad!

623
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
Everything isn't a sin!

624
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,500
Come to your closet and pray.
Ask to be forgiven.

625
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,300
He's a nice boy, Mama. You'll like him.
You'll really like him, Mama.

626
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,100
"Boy."

627
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,800
The boys! The boys! Yes, the boys...

628
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,700
After the blood come the boys....

629
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,300
- Mama...
- Like sniffing dogs,

630
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,800
grinning and slobbering and trying
to find out where that smell comes from.

631
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,800
I know where they take them
cos I've seen it all!

632
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,900
- Well, you're not going.
- Already said I would.

633
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,400
Tell that boy you're not going,
or we're gonna move from here!

634
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
No.

635
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,200
We'll move and never see that boy again!

636
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,600
- Mama, please say that Tommy and me...
- I'm gonna close the window.

637
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,900
Mama, please sit and talk to me!

638
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
I'm goin', Mama.

639
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,800
And things are gonna change
around here.

640
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,900
Witch.

641
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
Got Satan's power.

642
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,500
It's nothin' to do with Satan, Mama.

643
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,900
It's me. Me.

644
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,300
If I concentrate hard enough,
I can move things.

645
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,700
- Satan is clever.
- No, Mama.

646
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
I'm not the only one.

647
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,400
Other people can do it. I read about it.

648
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:00,200
You poor child. He doesn't let you know
he's working through you.

649
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,900
Mama... I know.

650
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,500
He entered your father
and carried him off!

651
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,900
- He ran away, Mama.
- The devil tempted him!

652
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,300
He ran away with a woman, Mama.

653
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,300
Everybody knows that.

654
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,200
You must renounce this power.
You must give it up. Never use it.

655
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,700
I'm goin', Mama.

656
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,900
You can't stop me.

657
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,800
And I don't wanna talk about it any more.

658
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,700
- Keep that damn light straight.
- Hurry up!

659
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:52,600
Watch it, you stupid shit!
You're getting blood all over the place!

660
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,500
Who you calling a stupid shit?

661
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,400
I mean, you can't even keep
that fuckin' light straight.

662
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,300
Just hurry up.

663
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,900
Yes, ma'am! We's doin' the bes' we can!
We really are, boss!

664
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,000
Hurry up. I wanna go home.

665
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,400
Just... ..keep your tits, huh?

666
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,300
And I'll let you pull the rope
when the time comes.

667
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,700
I plan to.

668
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,800
I know.

669
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,300
Ernest, tonight's prom night.
Everything all right?

670
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,800
- I didn't know you were interested.
- I'm a student here, amn't I?

671
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,300
- I don't know. Are you?
- Sure I am.

672
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,700
I wanna be on the committee.

673
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:57,000
You're a little late.
I could've used you a week ago.

674
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,800
I'm not late. I'm right on time.
I wanna collect the ballots

675
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,200
for the king and queen and the voting.

676
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,600
- Think we could arrange that?
- Okay. Can you be here at 6.30?

677
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,900
No. No, I can't be here at 6.30.

678
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,300
I'll be here at 8. How's 8?

679
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,400
- Yeah, that'll do.
- See you then.

680
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,800
- Take it easy.
- I'll take it any way I can get it, pal.

681
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,200
Hey, Helen.

682
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,500
Helen!

683
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,400
Helen!

684
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,100
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?

685
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,000
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?

686
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,300
- What?
- He's taking Carrie White to the prom.

687
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,200
- No!
- Yeah!

688
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,700
- He can't do that! Where's Sue?
- Yes, he can. He asked her.

689
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,100
- What's she gonna wear?
- Who, Carrie?

690
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,600
A sackcloth?!

691
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
- Sweetie, keep those stars coming faster.
- They're coming.

692
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,600
What's this I hear about Tommy
taking Carrie to the prom?

693
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,300
Whatever you've heard, it's true.

694
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,900
Why is he doing it?
Everybody is talking about it.

695
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,900
I asked him to
cos I thought I owed it to Carrie.

696
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,600
- Where's that put everybody else?
- They gotta deal with it in their own way.

697
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,100
- What do you mean?
- Oh... just something.

698
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,700
- Well, you're not going to the prom.
- Oh, I'll be here.

699
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,600
You'll be here?
What, you're going to the prom?

700
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,900
I will tell you later.
You're gonna be in on it.

701
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,900
I'm gonna be in on it? What?

702
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,000
I'm telling you later!

703
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,900
- I want to know now, Chris.
- Just wait.

704
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:33,000
I won't tell anybody, I promise. I won't say
a word. I'm your best friend. Come on.

705
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,400
Okay.

706
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,300
- You gotta rent a tuxedo for the prom.
- I only got 10 bucks, though.

707
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,200
You can rent a tuxedo!
You don't have to look great!

708
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,100
Hey.

709
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,900
Does this look nice?

710
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,400
He looks beautiful. Make a good
impression for once in your life.

711
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,800
- Would you go out with me?
- Not with ruffles.

712
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,000
You don't have to get ruffles for yourself.

713
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,900
- I don't like ruffles...
- You don't have to get ruffles!

714
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,700
Don't I look sharp?

715
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,100
It looks good on you,
but I don't look right in a tuxedo.

716
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,800
- Have you ever put on a tuxedo?
- I don't have a tuxedo body.

717
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,200
- I know they have tuxedos here for you.
- But I wouldn't look right.

718
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,200
I know just the tuxedo for him.

719
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,600
- Well, what do you think?
- I like it. I think it's terrific.

720
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,700
Look at that. No ruffles at all!

721
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,200
Red. I might've known it would be red.

722
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,200
It's pink, Mama.

723
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,000
Look what Tommy gave me, Mama.

724
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Aren't they beautiful?

725
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,200
I can see your dirty pillows.

726
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,600
Everyone will.

727
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,200
Breasts, Mama.

728
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,300
They're called breasts.

729
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,300
And every woman has them.

730
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,600
Take off that dress.

731
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,700
No.

732
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:42,600
- We'll burn it and pray for forgiveness.
- No, Mama.

733
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,100
Well, he's not coming.

734
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,700
He is coming, Mama.
Now stop it. I'm nervous enough.

735
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,800
No, he's not coming.

736
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,500
He's not gonna come.

737
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,500
Go away!

738
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,400
Stop it, Mama!

739
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,800
- Stop hurting yourself, Mama!
- I'm not!

740
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,300
He's gonna laugh at you!
They're all gonna laugh at you!

741
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,400
- They're not gonna laugh at me!
- Stay here with me.

742
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
I don't wanna stay with you, Mama!

743
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,700
I'll tell him you're sick!

744
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,400
- I'll say you changed your mind!
- Be quiet.

745
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,800
Sit down! Be quiet!

746
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,700
I'll tell him you changed your mind!

747
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,500
Sit down!

748
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:01,000
Just sit there, Mama,
and don't say a word until I'm gone.

749
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,300
I'll be home early.

750
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,600
I love you, Mama.

751
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,000
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

752
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,400
Tommy,

753
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,900
could we wait here just a minute?

754
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Are you scared?

755
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,900
Mm-hm.

756
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,900
Maybe this was a mistake.

757
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,800
Oh, no. It's not gonna be that bad.

758
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,700
They're a good crowd. Really.

759
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,600
Really.

760
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,100
Don't be so nervous.

761
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,500
Besides, I'd look awfully stupid
dancing by myself, wouldn't l?

762
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,000
Now come on.

763
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,700
When I look back on my younger days

764
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,500
I really was a maniac,

765
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,000
blowing up the john

766
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,400
with a cherry bomb,

767
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,900
giving the janitor a cardiac.

768
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,400
Well, the teacher could say

769
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,000
they should lock you away

770
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,400
and throw away all the keys
if you please.

771
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,500
He's outta control.

772
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,700
The devil's got a hold of his soul.

773
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,700
Oh!

774
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,200
Man, you wanted the time

775
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,600
so my buddies and I

776
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,900
choked upon a cigarette.

777
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,400
Too tired to jog

778
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,900
and you could barely walk,

779
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
swearin' for the hell of it.

780
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,700
Then when it's your right to see

781
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,900
the president's daughter,

782
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,900
the daughter's been so outta sight.

783
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,900
Right.

784
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,200
Dancin' till dawn,

785
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,400
my parents were clear uptown.

786
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,400
Yeah!

787
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,900
High school.

788
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,800
Pre-school.

789
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,900
No, 12 long years

790
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,300
of the education blues.

791
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,600
Teachers.

792
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,000
Preachers.

793
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,400
Don't know how

794
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,000
I ever made it through.

795
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,500
Oh, yeah!

796
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,800
Come on.

797
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,800
Ross, if I knew you'd look this sharp,
I would've taken you instead of, uh...

798
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,600
What's her name?

799
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,800
Don't bother about them.
If they self-destruct,

800
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,700
I'll dance with you.

801
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,800
Hey, where did you buy that dress?
I love it!

802
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,100
- Oh, I made it.
- Made it?!

803
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,200
- The decorations... don't they look great?
- Yeah...

804
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,600
- I'm so nervous.
- It's okay. You can sit with us.

805
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,400
- Hey, what time is it?
- 8 o'clock.

806
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,500
Gotta go.

807
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,200
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

808
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,900
See you later.

809
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,500
Sue!

810
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,800
- Would you like to dance?
- Could we just sit here for a minute?

811
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,900
Sure.

812
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,000
Sure. Anything you want.

813
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,900
Carrie.

814
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,700
Hi, Miss Collins.

815
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
You look so pretty!

816
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,800
You, too. You look beautiful.

817
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:57,000
Thank you! I know I don't, not really,
but thank you, anyway.

818
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,500
May I sit down?

819
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,200
- Yeah. Chair...
- Thank you.

820
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,300
I'm gonna go and talk to some people.

821
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,300
I remember my prom.
I had a date with the, uh

822
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,000
the captain of the basketball team.

823
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,800
And he was 6ft 7in tall, so

824
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:39,400
I bought a pair of 3-inch spike heels
so that our kiss goodnight would be, um

825
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,200
Less awkward.
Anyway, we went in his pick-up truck,

826
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:48,000
which of course broke down, and we
had to walk the last half-mile to the prom.

827
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,100
By the time I got there, my feet were
so blistered that all I could do was

828
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,100
just sit there. I couldn't dance.
So we just sat there and, uh... just talked.

829
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,600
And, uh

830
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,600
it was... magic. Is it like that for you?

831
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,500
It's, um...

832
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,900
it's nice.

833
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,900
- Just nice?
- No...! It's...

834
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,800
It's like, uh...

835
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,700
- It's like being on Mars.
- You'll never forget it.

836
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,000
I don't think I will.

837
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,400
Thank you.

838
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,700
Hey, what's goin' on here?

839
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,000
What are you doing with my date?

840
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,300
- Oh, we're just talking.
- Yeah?

841
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,100
Have a lovely time, okay?

842
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,100
And you, too!

843
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,100
Bye.

844
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,900
Don't let me catch you
hugging any guys like that.

845
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,700
I won't.

846
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,000
Better not.

847
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,400
I won't.

848
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,400
Do you really have to be home so early?

849
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,400
Yeah, I promised.

850
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,600
Okay.

851
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,100
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

852
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,800
Some of the kids are going
over to Nolston's after the prom.

853
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,400
That's okay.

854
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,000
What?

855
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,300
If you wanna go with your friends,
I don't wanna spoil anything.

856
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,900
Would you let me finish?

857
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,800
What I was gonna say is that,
if you'd like to,

858
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,300
we could stop in at The Beehive.

859
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,600
I've never been there.

860
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,600
No?

861
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,300
Good! Well, then, let's go!

862
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,700
- Okay.
- Okay?

863
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,000
For sure. Great.

864
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Are you ready to dance?

865
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,400
Tommy, l...

866
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,600
Come on.

867
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,600
I don't know how. I can't, Tommy. I can't.

868
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,100
Sure you can.

869
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,400
I'm not sure

870
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,300
but the more that it's real

871
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,100
the more it's right.

872
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,800
Ooh, one night...

873
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,900
It's as though we've been lovers

874
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:17,400
all of our lives.

875
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,900
There must be a God.

876
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,900
Could it be that he's heard me at last?

877
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,700
Because you look at me

878
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,500
as the one beautiful...

879
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:36,500
Yeah, you can. Come on.
Give me your hand. Just put it there.

880
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,600
- Like that?
- Yeah. Put this on your shoulder.

881
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,800
That's right.

882
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,800
Okay, just relax. All right?

883
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,400
Okay. Just listen to the music.

884
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,600
That's right.

885
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,900
See, you got it? That's good.

886
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,000
You're as good as anyone else out here.

887
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,000
Got it?

888
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,600
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

889
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,800
- It's just...
- That's all right.

890
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,200
No harm...

891
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,700
No foul.

892
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,300
- I can't do anything.
- Yeah, you can.

893
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,700
I can't dance. I can't even... I don't know.

894
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,500
- Tommy?
- Yeah?

895
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,600
Why...

896
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:45,100
- Why what?
- Why am I here?

897
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,500
Because it's the prom.

898
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,800
Why am I here with you?

899
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,100
Because I asked you.

900
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,400
Why'd you ask me?

901
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,400
Because I wanted to.

902
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,100
Why'd you want to?

903
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,900
Because you liked my poem.

904
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,600
Only, I didn't write it. Somebody else did.

905
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,100
Oh.

906
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,000
Carrie, we're here

907
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,600
and we're together

908
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,400
and I like it.

909
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,500
I do, I like it!

910
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,400
Where there are other girls

911
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,600
but tonight there's only me.

912
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:35,000
I never dreamed someone like you

913
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,500
could love someone like me.

914
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,200
All right, ladies and gentlemen!

915
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,600
Ladies and gentlemen...

916
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,800
And you two behave yourselves, okay?

917
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:15,200
Take your seats, please. We've gotta vote
for the king and the queen.

918
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,200
Tommy,

919
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,200
we are here.

920
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,000
I know.

921
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,200
Do you wanna decline?

922
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,700
Do you?

923
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:39,100
Hell, no. If you win, all they do is put you
up there for a school song and a dance.

924
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,400
Then they take your picture
for the yearbook,

925
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,600
so everyone can see
we look like a couple of idiots.

926
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,900
Anyway, it's the last year. Why not?

927
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,600
It's so beautiful!

928
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,100
Hey...

929
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,300
You're beautiful.

930
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:08,000
Well, who should we vote for?
They're more your crowd than mine.

931
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I don't even have a crowd.

932
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,400
Let's vote for ourselves.

933
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,000
No.

934
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:17,500
Why not?

935
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,600
Please don't vote for ourselves.

936
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,200
Carrie...

937
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:36,000
Come on. To the devil with false modesty.

938
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,000
The devil!

939
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,600
Billy! Shh!

940
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,100
Will you close that a little bit?

941
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,500
Jesus, you wanna get caught?

942
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,300
- That Carrie White, she sure is cute.
- Shut up.

943
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:29,100
- Thought you said they were gonna win.
- They will. Won't even be close.

944
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,400
I called in a few favours.

945
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,600
Can I have your ballot, please?

946
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,400
Hello, guys. Thank you.

947
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,100
Can I have your ballots, please?

948
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,400
- Thank you.
- Thanks, there.

949
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,300
Thank you.

950
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,400
Thank you, there.

951
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,400
Ballots, please. Thank you.

952
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,400
Thank you.

953
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,300
Freddy, hurry up, please.

954
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,700
Ballots...

955
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,700
Good, good. Thanks a lot there, Vic.

956
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,600
Get all of them?

957
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,700
They're right in back of you,
so start kicking.

958
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,400
- See you.
- Good luck.

959
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,100
More ballots? Thank you.

960
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,600
I have some more ballots for you.

961
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,400
Thank you.

962
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've got the winners.

963
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,200
All right!

964
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,200
I give you Tommy Ross and Carrie White!

965
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:39,700
They're all gonna laugh at you!

966
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,400
They're all gonna laugh at you!

967
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,400
They're all gonna laugh at you!

968
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,100
- Plug it up! Plug it up!
- They're all gonna laugh at you!

969
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,700
- Plug it up! Plug it up!
- They're all gonna laugh at you!

970
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,600
We're all sorry, Cassie.

971
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,500
- They're all gonna laugh at you!
- We're all sorry, Cassie.

972
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,000
Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

973
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,200
Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

974
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,500
Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

975
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,100
Come on, let's go, Billy!

976
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,900
- They're all gonna laugh at you!
- We're sorry, Cassie.

977
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,600
They're all gonna laugh at you!

978
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,700
We're sorry, Cassie.

979
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,900
- Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.
- They're all gonna laugh at you!

980
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,800
We're sorry, Cassie.

981
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,700
They're all gonna laugh at you!

982
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,700
We're sorry, Cassie.

983
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:22,700
Trust me, Carrie.

984
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,100
Somebody open this door!

985
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,500
Open this door now!

986
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,200
Help! Help!

987
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,400
Look at him!

988
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,300
Have these students calm down!

989
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,900
Mr Fromm! Mr Fromm!

990
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:18,900
Carrie!

991
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,600
Carrie...!

992
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,800
Mama?

993
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,400
Mama?

994
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,700
Mama? Mama, it was bad, Mama.

995
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,900
They laughed at me.

996
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,500
Mama, hold me.

997
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,500
Mama, please, hold me.

998
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,500
Hold me, Mama.

999
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,000
Please, hold me!

1000
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:12,700
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

1001
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,100
After the first time,
before we were married.

1002
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,500
Ralph promised never again.

1003
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,700
He promised, and I believed him.

1004
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,800
But sin never dies.

1005
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,500
Sin never dies.

1006
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:36,100
At first it was all right.

1007
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,400
We lived sinlessly.

1008
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:42,000
We slept in the same bed,
but we never did it.

1009
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:47,600
And then, that night,

1010
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:52,200
I saw him looking down at me that way.

1011
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,600
We got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

1012
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I smelled the whisky on his breath.

1013
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:10,400
And he took me... He took me.

1014
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:16,300
With the stink of the filthy
roadhouse whisky on his breath.

1015
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:18,400
And I liked it.

1016
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,600
I liked it!

1017
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:27,800
Well, all that dirty touching in his hands
and coming all over me...

1018
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,600
I should have given you to God
when you were born.

1019
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,100
But I was weak and backsliding.

1020
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,800
But now the devil has come home.

1021
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,200
Oh!

1022
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,600
We'll pray.

1023
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,500
Yes.

1024
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,500
We'll pray.

1025
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,700
We'll pray.

1026
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
We'll pray.

1027
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,500
For the last time,

1028
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:59,800
we'll pray.

1029
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,600
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1030
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,200
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

1031
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,500
Aghh!

1032
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,100
Ohh!

1033
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,100
Aghh!

1034
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,200
Aaghhh...!

1035
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,800
Hello?

1036
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,600
Oh, Betty, thank God it's you.

1037
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:28,900
I don't think I could have handled
one more reporter.

1038
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,200
Yeah, well, we're all a little edgy.

1039
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:38,700
She's better. Well, uh,
sleeping too much, I guess,

1040
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:44,800
but Dr Schnieder said that's to be
expected after all she's been through.

1041
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:50,300
Well, he said that she's young enough,
so that she'll forget about it in time.

1042
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:56,100
No. I wouldn't let her go to the funerals,
with Tommy and all the others gone.

1043
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,100
It's best we just go away for a while.

1044
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:29,200
It's all right!

1045
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:39,000
It's all right. I know. It's all right.

1046
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,900
It's all right. I'm here.
