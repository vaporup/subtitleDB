1
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:36,808
We are going so fast.
Aren't you scared?

2
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,141
I'm enjoying it all the more now.
When you are with me...

3
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,810
I'm not scared at all,
In fact, this is great fun!

4
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:45,420
Watch it. You're going
to be really scared now

5
00:00:56,603 --> 00:00:58,161
what are you looking at?

6
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:01,172
I feel like giving you a kiss.
- So give me a kiss

7
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:03,833
Close your eyes first

8
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:07,177
whenever you give me a kiss,
you make me close my eyes

9
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:10,175
How will I know how good
you are at kissing?

10
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,183
If you want a good kiss,
you got to close your eyes

11
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,790
Hey! You've woken up!

12
00:02:35,335 --> 00:02:39,772
You speak as if this is the
first time I've ever woken up

13
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:44,505
Because that truck keeps honking away,
I got to wake up early every morning

14
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:47,880
why don't you keep that alarm clock
close to your own ears?

15
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:51,273
You ought to thank that clock which
at least wakes you up on time

16
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,743
Else, the whole world wants to fulfill
its dreams in the world of dreams itself

17
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,420
Hey Maninder...
- Yes sir?

18
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:39,128
Is everything okay?
- We've got to replace the carburetor

19
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:42,664
Take the carburetor from the new car
and fit it in this one...

20
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:47,033
and fit the old carburetor in the new car.
- Could you please explain in detail?

21
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,003
Sure, I will. If you put
the carburetor of that car in this one...

22
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:55,007
this one will work fine. And the car
that's here for wheel-alignment...

23
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:59,341
will soon be back for a replacement
of the carburetor. You get that?

24
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,017
Sure, I do.
- You've understood...

25
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,152
but make sure you don't
tell Arav about it

26
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,055
That's wonderful, Mr Vasvani.
What a con job!

27
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,626
We're here to fix cars
and make money

28
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:14,795
So get on with your work.
Don't waste my time. Go on

29
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:19,363
Go! Time is money

30
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:25,374
Hey Ali-bhai...
welcome to my garage!

31
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:31,442
Skip the crap! What silly jobs you do!
The cars get screwed in just two days

32
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:34,044
Not again?
Here's what I'll do

33
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:37,982
I'll entrust your car
to the real expert this time

34
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:41,383
He has only to touch it
and it'll be fine. Okay?

35
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:42,823
Arav...

36
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:48,991
Have you fixed the car?
- This one can't be repaired

37
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:51,870
It has a manufacturing defect.
Sue the manufacturers...

38
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,400
you'll get a new car.
- But how do I know that you're right?

39
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:57,073
What if I get stuck
in a legal battle?

40
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,072
I've never made a false claim
where cars are concerned

41
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:02,074
Okay? So don't you worry

42
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:17,586
I have faith in my abilities

43
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:20,422
Just wait and watch. There will
come a day...

44
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,427
when cars designed by me will
zoom across every street of the world

45
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:27,437
That's tops, I say!
God bless you!

46
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:29,238
"Sat Sri Akal, Papa-ji..."

47
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:33,105
You've wasted so many pages
to write just a single line?

48
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:37,439
Wasted pages? I'm writing a letter
to my folks, not wasting pages

49
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:40,250
And, by the way, how do you
write a letter in just a single line?

50
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:42,921
I'll show you.
- Go ahead. Let's see

51
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:45,447
Here's the pen. I wanna see

52
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,987
"I am fine here..."

53
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:57,259
"and hope the same for you.
Your son, Arav"

54
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:00,470
Is that a letter or a telegram?

55
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:04,867
You won't understand.
Just mail it to my address

56
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:08,075
You and I just don't think alike.
- Right!

57
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:12,474
You've come to America so that
you can earn money...

58
00:06:12,852 --> 00:06:15,218
go back to India and settle down.
- Oh sure, that's spot on

59
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:20,156
But that's not what I want to do.
Why should I leave the country...

60
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:23,621
that's giving me everything?
Name, fame, progress... why?

61
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:26,955
Don't leave it, sir!
Who's asking you to leave it?

62
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:30,301
But do tell me something. What happens
of your folks back home?

63
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:33,506
They'll be fine. My elder brother
is around to take care of them

64
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:37,507
And once I get settled here,
they can come here and live with me

65
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:59,023
Sir, my designs are truly innovative
and distinctively a class apart

66
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:02,262
I seek your support to gain access to
the research and development...

67
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:05,336
department of your principals.
- Mr Kapoor, you will have to find...

68
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:07,529
alternative modes to access
the authorities

69
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:10,207
I suggest you send in
your proposal directly

70
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:12,233
Thank you

71
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:20,212
Fab job Arav! You have turned
my car into a new one. What did you do?

72
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:22,544
Nothing much, just a few
changes here and there

73
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:27,557
You're so talented, why don't
you start a workshop of your own?

74
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:30,260
If you say, I'm willing to invest.
- Mr. Patel...

75
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:34,556
you want to throw me out of business?
- Mr Patel...

76
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:38,227
my aim is not the opening of a workshop.
Basically I'm a car-designer...

77
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:41,165
waiting for the right opportunity.
- And this is the land of opportunity!

78
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:43,565
You don't know Mr Patel, Arav

79
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,939
He's opening a new discotheque
very soon...

80
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:57,190
to coincide with his nephew's marriage.
- I hope you guys will attend

81
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,582
By the way, Arav, give me
a demo CD of your designs

82
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,591
I know a lot of people
in the car industry

83
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:04,593
All right, sir.
- I have a piece of advise

84
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,666
You ought to visit the gypsy temple once
and try your luck

85
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,280
Look at them rocking!
Shake a leg!

86
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:30,622
It takes little to make a Sardar
break into ajig!

87
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:33,757
You get on with your luck!
I'm going to have a blast!

88
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,076
You can keep this.
I'll take out another one

89
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:56,638
Excuse me. It's not just
another piece of paper

90
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:58,974
we both made a wish
and picked it up

91
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:02,651
who knows? Maybe God wants both of us
to know the same thing

92
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,987
"You'll meet with your destiny today"

93
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:13,659
I can't believe this!
Are we each other's destiny?

94
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,658
I don't believe in things
like destiny

95
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:20,670
we reached the temple at the same time,
make a wish and pick up a chit...

96
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:25,000
if all this can happen,
why can't we be each other's destiny?

97
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:28,178
Because this is just a coincidence
and nothing more

98
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:32,676
It's all about perception.
What if we meet again?

99
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,282
We'll see

100
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:39,015
Hi, I'm Anna.
- I'm Arav. Take care. Bye

101
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:43,493
Anna! He's so handsome!

102
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:46,958
Straight out of a romantic novel!

103
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:07,648
"Girl you got me shocked
from the rhythm of your body"

104
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:09,616
"Burn coz its hot
like wassabe"

105
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:12,518
"Go low till you knock knees,
shaking that ass..."

106
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:14,989
"till we crash kamikaze"

107
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:31,733
"Take my hand,
make me turn around..."

108
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,343
"put that flower-band
in my hair-bun"

109
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:36,638
"Sway with me, lover-boy..."

110
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:40,410
"you have married me,
now put up with my airs"

111
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:16,583
"Love is real,
love takes time"

112
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,157
"Love is sinful
and divine"

113
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,491
"Look up at me, my love.
Raise your eyes"

114
00:11:56,896 --> 00:12:01,265
"I'm a rare beauty, my love"

115
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,961
"Take me in your arms,
hold me to your bosom..."

116
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,502
"don't make me pine like this"

117
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,830
"On my moon-like face,
apply a dot..."

118
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:11,440
"embellish my beauty
with pearls and diamonds"

119
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:13,675
"Drape me in a sari
that glitters"

120
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,509
"You have married me...
now put up with my airs"

121
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:26,051
"watch me,
undercover cops can't stop me"

122
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,518
"Gonna lock you down
with my lock and key"

123
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:33,298
"Cause you could be Punjabi,
Gujarati, Parsi or a banging Bengali"

124
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:52,311
"Youth is but shortlived, my love"

125
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:57,288
"I just can't wait anymore"

126
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,681
"My heart is pounding,
I'm beyond reasoning..."

127
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,553
"fall in love with me"

128
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:07,389
"Lay a bed in the room,
give me all the joy in the world"

129
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,701
"Let your lips feed mine
the wine of love..."

130
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:13,497
"you have married me,
now put up with my tantrums"

131
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,074
"Your tight-fitting blouse"

132
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,716
"Your flowing scarf"

133
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,012
"Your skirt pulled up"

134
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:33,584
"They drive me crazy"

135
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:38,363
"They're others who dance
to your tunes, O pretty one"

136
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:43,334
"They're others who do up
your hair-bun"

137
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:47,599
"I'm one of those who don't
play up to women's tantrums"

138
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:52,938
"I'm the love that makes
makes women bow at my feet"

139
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:55,637
"win me over with your charms..."

140
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,939
"come rushing to me,
whenever I call"

141
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:00,443
"Give unto me your
youthful charms"

142
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,952
"Because I have married you...
don't show me those airs"

143
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,621
"Take my hand,
make me turn around..."

144
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:14,956
"put that flower-band
in my hair-bun"

145
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,462
"Sway with me, lover-boy..."

146
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:21,366
"you have married me,
now put up with my airs"

147
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,975
"Love is the King.
You're the Queen of the party"

148
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:32,648
"Feeding to have a scene
with this young hottie"

149
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:34,782
"Have a ball,
take a drag..."

150
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:37,717
"talk about the sex
and forget about the wedding"

151
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:58,443
Arav, you look dashing
in this black suit

152
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:01,001
Thanks

153
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:04,676
I'm waiting for a compliment too

154
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,010
Oh! So you are a shy guy by nature

155
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:12,822
Anyway, this is our second meeting.
Do you think it's destiny?

156
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:15,823
Mere happenstance

157
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:18,420
There are just a handful of Indians
in this city...

158
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:21,566
who keep bumping into each other
on festive occasions

159
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:25,632
It'll be a mistake to call it destiny.

160
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:28,635
There are hundreds of thousands of people
in this city

161
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:33,478
So, our meeting again has definitely
got something to do with destiny

162
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:38,039
Suit yourself with whatever beliefs.
- His belief, not mine

163
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:41,046
You'll surely accept it some day.
- Well, it's that...

164
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:45,046
wow! Friends already?

165
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:48,383
Nothing of the sort. Just a
coincidence that we've met again

166
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:54,065
My word! You need good-fortune for
such coincidences, my friend!

167
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,489
Bye!

168
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:03,670
Dammit! What wrong have I done?
- I was trying hard to shake her off...

169
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:06,067
and like an idiot,
you took up for her!

170
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:12,073
What a nut! You don't try to
shake off gals like her!

171
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,249
You ought to be chasing her!

172
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:23,086
Anna, he should be crazy about you,
but he's just not encouraging you!

173
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:28,529
Nams, some guys like it slow.
- Yeah

174
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:33,102
Even I like it.
This is the way... slow!

175
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,100
But not so slow as to get old
and proclaim one day...

176
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:40,268
"Darling, I love you"

177
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:45,775
Nams, he might not agree
with me today...

178
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:50,178
but one day he'll surely realise
that I'm his destiny

179
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:55,659
That trip to the temple
and our second meeting...

180
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:58,257
things like these don't happen
every other day

181
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:01,460
I'm just waiting for
our next meeting

182
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:05,136
There must surely be something that
will bring us close to each other

183
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:16,611
Excuse me. Can I test-drive this car?
- Sorry, sir. It's only for display

184
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,744
Can I check the interiors?
- With pleasure. All yours

185
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:29,825
You...? Here?
- I am, wherever you are

186
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,590
I'm sure you think this is
a coincidence too

187
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:40,163
Actually I am very fond of cars

188
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:44,174
well, cars are my life,
my passion... my destiny

189
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:48,670
Destiny? Cars? So we do have
something in common

190
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:52,844
It was nice talking to you.
See you again...

191
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:54,982
if there is a coincidence

192
00:17:56,522 --> 00:18:00,925
Believe me, my destiny will surely bring
us together again. By a coincidence

193
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:14,466
This car was launched only today
and you've bought it already?

194
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,206
I haven't bought it,
I'm just taking a test-drive

195
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:21,208
when I asked for it, I was turned down.
How come you got it?

196
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,811
I'm well connected, you see?
You want a lift?

197
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:29,710
What are you so thoughtful about?
C'mon!

198
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:36,221
You are such a weirdo. Guys pray to
get a lift from a beautiful girl...

199
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:40,220
and you are acting pricey.
- Okay

200
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:49,901
Do me a favour, please.
- What?

201
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,574
Give me my bag lying back there

202
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:58,573
Here you are.
- Open it

203
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:01,245
Excuse me, it's very unsafe
to open a lady's purse

204
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,685
You won't be embarrassed. Open it

205
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,451
Done.
- So give it to me

206
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:12,128
Give you what?
- Give me the scarf in the bag!

207
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,991
I can't see anything. Hurry up.
- Here you are

208
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:20,265
what on earth are you doing...?

209
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:22,602
We'll end up having a collision
while you're tying up your hair!

210
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:25,073
God! Here's a harassed girl...

211
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:27,873
instead of helping her,
you're yelling at her?

212
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:31,680
Can't you simply tie up my hair.
Go on now. Do it

213
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:35,614
Are you serious?
- Tie it up, I can't see a thing!

214
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:48,690
What are you doing? Tie it up!
- As if I've done a course in this!

215
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:54,302
Sit still, will you?

216
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:57,103
Tie it up properly

217
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,301
Thank you.
- You're welcome

218
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:04,974
This is fun!

219
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:12,650
Amazing body!
- It takes years for a body like this

220
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:16,655
I can see that. But I've never
seen a shape like this one

221
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:23,732
And this colour... it's a killer!

222
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:27,131
I wish I could have it right now.
- What?

223
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,341
This car. I love its aerodynamics

224
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,781
Arav, what's your profession?
- I am a car designer

225
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:41,947
If I get the opportunity, I could
design a better car than this one

226
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:46,614
Anyway, you can drop me here

227
00:20:57,403 --> 00:21:00,065
when are we going to meet again?
- Whenever your destiny wants us to

228
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,037
Take care. Bye

229
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:10,375
My laptop!

230
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:16,180
Hey Arav! Congratulations!

231
00:21:18,588 --> 00:21:22,422
There's an urgent interview
call for you from BMw

232
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:25,293
All the best, my friend.
- Congratulations!

233
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,185
I won't be able to appear
for this interview

234
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:28,991
why not?
- What's the matter?

235
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:32,224
I forgot my laptop in Anna's car.
- So call Anna and have it brought here

236
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:35,099
I don't have her number.
- But you have her address?

237
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:36,865
Let's go and fetch it.
- I don't have her address either

238
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:39,464
She was giving it to me, but...
- You mean, you didn't take it?

239
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,870
God Almighty! When's this guy
going to have some common sense?

240
00:21:42,044 --> 00:21:44,877
Guess what? You gave
a demo CD to Patel, right?

241
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:49,375
So I'll call Patel and have that CD
rushed back. Simple

242
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:55,380
I hope I don't mess up
this opportunity

243
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,888
Patel's cellphone is switched off.
But don't worry, Arav

244
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,494
CD or no CD,
you must go for the interview

245
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:12,231
Mr Arav Kapoor, we at BMw believe that
new talent has to be promoted...

246
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:15,571
and in keeping with this tradition
we have invited you here today

247
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,605
I'm very grateful, sir, but
the thing is... I have a problem

248
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:24,009
I lost my laptop yesterday, so I won't
be able to show you the designs...

249
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:26,915
and the demos I have made.
- But we have already have your demo CD

250
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:33,727
we have gone through your designs
and the opinion of my panel is that...

251
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:38,330
it's very impressive. So we have
decided to give you a go-ahead

252
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:40,692
welcome to BMw.
- Thank you so much

253
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:46,737
The administrative officer will
introduce you to your work-station...

254
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:48,840
as well as your personal assistant

255
00:22:52,949 --> 00:22:55,417
Hi Arav.
- What are you doing here?

256
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,742
Call it a coincidence

257
00:22:58,354 --> 00:23:00,618
By a quirk of destiny,
I happen to be your assistant

258
00:23:00,957 --> 00:23:03,619
Oh, now I see.
You showed them my laptop

259
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,552
A coincidence. You forgot
your laptop in my car...

260
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:16,235
and when I looked into it for
your address, I discovered a genius

261
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:22,400
The rest, you know

262
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,972
I don't know how
to thank you Anna

263
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,241
You've made my dream come true

264
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:36,520
You deserve it.
So now do you believe in destiny?

265
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:40,495
Maybe not in destiny, but yes...
I have started believing in you

266
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:48,594
"He loves me...?"

267
00:23:48,938 --> 00:23:50,530
"He loves me not"

268
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,401
"He loves me!"

269
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:59,744
"When you lose your heart
to someone..."

270
00:24:00,616 --> 00:24:03,016
"you're on the horns
of a dilemma"

271
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,186
"O my love... I hope
I don't fall in love"

272
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,461
"when you lose your heart
to someone..."

273
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,831
"you're on the horns
of a dilemma"

274
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:34,208
"O my love... I hope
I don't fall in love"

275
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:49,456
"I hope I'm not bowled over
by her charms"

276
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:55,989
"I hope I don't find myself
lost in her eyes"

277
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:03,329
"I hope I do not err..."

278
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:10,134
"my heart knows not what anguish
love causes"

279
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:17,312
"when you lose your heart
to someone..."

280
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,755
"it's oh so difficult"

281
00:26:21,557 --> 00:26:27,587
"O my love... I hope
I don't fall in love"

282
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:18,539
"what intoxication
leads me astray...?"

283
00:27:19,448 --> 00:27:25,648
"What fragrance
my lovely memories exude?"

284
00:27:26,255 --> 00:27:32,785
"Never was I in such a state..."

285
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:39,896
"what desires now consume my heart?"

286
00:27:40,502 --> 00:27:46,737
"When you lose your heart
to someone..."

287
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:50,242
"it's oh so difficult"

288
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:57,243
"O my love... I hope
I don't fall in love"

289
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:10,889
"when you lose your heart
to someone..."

290
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:18,272
"you're on the horns
of a dilemma"

291
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:38,623
"It's difficult...
oh so difficult"

292
00:28:39,295 --> 00:28:45,632
"It's difficult...
oh so difficult"

293
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:53,966
Nams! I'm in love!
I'm in love!

294
00:28:55,311 --> 00:28:57,973
Madam, you've taken Arav
for your life-partner

295
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,749
But isn't it necessary to find out
whether he's your type at all?

296
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:06,844
Yes, you are right!
But how do we find out?

297
00:29:07,323 --> 00:29:09,018
Simple, let's ask him

298
00:29:09,325 --> 00:29:12,852
Stupid, as if I'd ask and he'd
tell me. It's not so easy

299
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:15,661
You're right.
What should we do then?

300
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:18,331
Got it!

301
00:29:21,003 --> 00:29:24,336
Anna! What happened?

302
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:28,137
Did you find out...?

303
00:29:29,345 --> 00:29:31,074
So tell me!

304
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:33,941
Please Anna! Tell me!
- Okay

305
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:39,515
The company's procedures. All employees
have to go through a psychoanalysis test

306
00:29:39,888 --> 00:29:41,355
what's that?

307
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:46,358
Psychoanalysis.
- What on earth is that?

308
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:50,757
The company wants to know
what kind of a person you are...

309
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:53,024
your likes and dislikes and so on

310
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:56,870
Everybody's got to do it.
Take a look at this

311
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:00,369
Okay. Shoot

312
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,081
The question?

313
00:30:18,293 --> 00:30:24,664
Sure. What are you fond of?
- I'm fond of food

314
00:30:25,434 --> 00:30:29,734
I don't know how to cook.
- Stupid! What are cookery books for?

315
00:30:30,806 --> 00:30:33,900
I love Chinese, Lebanese, Mexican,
Italian, Thai...

316
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:39,404
but nothing to beat
our spicy Indian food

317
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:46,421
Butter chicken, cottage-cheese
cooked in butter and lentil-curry!

318
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:51,421
They say, the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach

319
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:55,991
Isn't that a rather odd route?
- But guys love all the odd routes!

320
00:30:56,932 --> 00:30:58,900
Should I let you into
something personal?

321
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:01,429
Promise me you won't laugh.
- I won't

322
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:04,904
Sure? Promise?
- Yes

323
00:31:09,111 --> 00:31:13,775
I love watching cartoons.
- Cartoons! At your age!

324
00:31:15,451 --> 00:31:16,440
Sorry

325
00:31:17,886 --> 00:31:23,791
Give me a big box of buttered popcorns
and my favorite cartoons

326
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:27,459
Tom and Jerry, Scooby Doo, Batman,
Spiderman, Tin Tin, Richie Rich...

327
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:29,457
and so on

328
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:40,805
So cute!

329
00:31:42,544 --> 00:31:45,809
What is your sexuality?
- What?!

330
00:31:46,882 --> 00:31:52,912
I mean, are you bi, hetro,
metro, tetro...?

331
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:54,649
What...?

332
00:31:56,492 --> 00:32:00,087
Well, I'm happy and gay.
- What?!

333
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:07,992
Why do all the guys with such
good qualities turn out to be gay?

334
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,307
I was only kidding

335
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:14,669
Thank God!

336
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:19,107
What would you gift
your girlfriend on a date?

337
00:32:19,515 --> 00:32:23,952
How does that concern the company?
That's my personal life!

338
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,183
That's precisely why I'm asking you.
To know more about you

339
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,955
I'm asking you stuff from the
questionnaire. Take a look, if you wish

340
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:34,053
Let me see

341
00:32:34,863 --> 00:32:36,854
Okay, go ahead

342
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:43,134
what gift would you give her?
A bouquet of flowers...

343
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:47,066
or an expensive platinum
necklace studded with diamonds...

344
00:32:47,543 --> 00:32:50,706
or something that your
girlfriend is really fond of?

345
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:56,880
I won't gift her any of these.
I'll gift my girlfriend a cactus plant

346
00:32:57,553 --> 00:32:58,542
Cactus!

347
00:33:00,556 --> 00:33:04,117
Flowers can wilt.
Expensive gifts can be stolen

348
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:09,227
But not the cactus. We use the cactus
for the security of our homes...

349
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:12,566
and a cactus will always
remind my girlfriend...

350
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:15,564
that if anyone ever tries
to act smart with her...

351
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:18,370
I'm going to smash his...

352
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:26,677
Fantastic!
Unimaginably romantic!

353
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:31,579
He's just my type.
Arav was made only for me

354
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,986
Coffee?

355
00:33:42,664 --> 00:33:45,258
Know something? That's just
what I was thinking about

356
00:33:45,601 --> 00:33:49,002
And you said it.
- So I can read your mind

357
00:33:49,605 --> 00:33:51,596
I'll go and get it.
- Okay

358
00:33:56,945 --> 00:33:58,936
Young man, it's Friday night

359
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:02,948
when all your friends are enjoying
the week-end with their families...

360
00:34:03,652 --> 00:34:06,621
why're you still working?
- Sir, this is not just work for me

361
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:11,119
It's my very life. If you don't
mind, may I ask you something?

362
00:34:12,294 --> 00:34:15,229
Yes?
- Why are you working so late?

363
00:34:17,032 --> 00:34:20,627
It's like this, son. I happen
to be the Chairman of this company

364
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:27,309
This huge empire you now see
was once a dream I so cherished

365
00:34:28,243 --> 00:34:31,644
Like you, I too want to reach
these heights of success, sir

366
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:38,450
Very ambitious boy. What's your name?
- Arav Kapoor.

367
00:34:38,654 --> 00:34:43,921
Nice meeting you. I can see that our
association will go a long way.

368
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,093
God bless you

369
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:24,564
Congratulations, Arav!
- Thank you!

370
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:29,003
It's because of you that
I was able to taste success today

371
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:31,697
You were the first one to spot my talent.

372
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,203
Arav, some people make
such a name for themselves...

373
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:38,703
that the world
remembers them forever

374
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:42,710
I'm sure you are one of them.
- You have so much of faith in me?

375
00:35:42,984 --> 00:35:48,718
Yes, I do. And you owe me a treat.
- I'll fulfill all your wishes today

376
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:51,321
First things first.
Let's go and party

377
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:52,515
Okay

378
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:01,999
C'mon guys!
Cheers!

379
00:36:08,477 --> 00:36:10,468
Arav, this is Virvani here.
- Yes, sir?

380
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:13,739
I have gone through the reports.
Well done, my boy

381
00:36:14,182 --> 00:36:15,410
Thank you, sir!

382
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:18,348
We have finalized October 11 as
the date for the launch of your car

383
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:21,419
Cheers!
- Thank you, sir

384
00:36:28,764 --> 00:36:30,561
Is everything all right?

385
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:35,226
I'm so happy... I'll go mad!

386
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:38,365
What happened? Will you tell us?
- Mr. Virvani just called

387
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:43,211
My car is being launched, Anna!
- This is great news!

388
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:27,812
Why are you looking at me like that?

389
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:32,149
I've been so immersed in my work...

390
00:37:34,095 --> 00:37:38,259
I realise today how beautiful you are

391
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,267
I'm glad you've realised it at last

392
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:47,264
I've also come to realise...

393
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:55,711
that I'm in love with you.
I love you, Anna

394
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,853
I love you too

395
00:38:15,237 --> 00:38:17,535
The function has started.
Why isn't Anna here yet?

396
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:20,036
A girl needs time to get ready.
So be patient

397
00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:22,870
Hey Arav, congratulations!

398
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:25,543
Isn't this the moment you've
always waited for?

399
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,564
Arav, Mr Virvani wants to see you
in his chambers

400
00:38:50,906 --> 00:38:52,430
May I come in, sir?

401
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:58,445
Arav, this is the most
expensive city in the world...

402
00:39:00,015 --> 00:39:02,575
and this is the most expensive
piece of land in the city...

403
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:06,445
where our office is situated

404
00:39:07,923 --> 00:39:10,915
This company thrives on hardwork
and intelligence...

405
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:15,590
but life feeds
on love and emotions

406
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:24,933
I lost my son and daughter-in-law
in a car accident

407
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:32,936
Everything was finished for me.
But thank God...

408
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:35,272
my granddaughter Anna survived

409
00:39:39,854 --> 00:39:41,754
Anna means everything to me

410
00:39:42,357 --> 00:39:46,020
I've given her everything
she has ever asked for in life

411
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:50,964
Today she has chosen you
as her life-partner...

412
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:57,972
she loves you a lot and I am sure
you reciprocate her feeling

413
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,474
Sir, I love her too.
- But mind you...

414
00:40:02,978 --> 00:40:07,472
when I see Anna shedding tears...
I lose all control

415
00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:11,316
I can never forgive someone
who hurts Anna

416
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:13,510
Sir, she'll always be happy with me

417
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:32,160
Ladies and gentlemen, let me have
the honour of introducing to you...

418
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:38,236
the most brilliant designer of
this amazing car, Mr Arav Kapoor!

419
00:40:38,476 --> 00:40:40,068
A big hand!

420
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:53,250
My dear friends, till now I was
only sharing my product with you

421
00:40:54,592 --> 00:40:58,585
But now I feel like sharing my
personal feelings with you guys

422
00:40:59,764 --> 00:41:04,599
On this joyous occasion, I would
like to announce the engagement...

423
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:09,930
of my granddaughter Anna with
Mr. Arav Kapoor. A big hand!

424
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:09,657
"I feel love for you...
overwhelming love"

425
00:42:15,673 --> 00:42:19,666
"As many times as I set my
eyes on you..."

426
00:42:20,078 --> 00:42:28,076
"I felt overwhelming
love for you"

427
00:42:29,354 --> 00:42:37,352
"I feel love for you...
overwhelming love"

428
00:43:03,054 --> 00:43:07,184
"Spend with me
a few moments of solitude..."

429
00:43:07,725 --> 00:43:11,252
"don't walk away,
having driven me crazy"

430
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:16,731
"My heart bears a burden,
it's difficult to rein it in..."

431
00:43:17,135 --> 00:43:21,128
"I implore you, do not
smile teasingly like this"

432
00:43:21,773 --> 00:43:23,741
"Don't twist my wrist..."

433
00:43:24,108 --> 00:43:30,741
"Goodness!
Don't pester me like this"

434
00:43:31,182 --> 00:43:35,414
"Someone might see us,
what will he have to say...?"

435
00:43:35,787 --> 00:43:39,689
"Stop teasing me... go away"

436
00:43:44,762 --> 00:43:49,426
"As many times as I
thought about you..."

437
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:57,764
"I felt love for you...
overwhelming love"

438
00:43:58,843 --> 00:44:06,773
"I feel love for you...
overwhelming love"

439
00:44:46,824 --> 00:44:50,817
"I'm in a daze,
I yearn..."

440
00:44:51,195 --> 00:44:55,256
"what's happening to me,
little do I know"

441
00:44:55,833 --> 00:45:00,270
"You are the one I desire,
you are the one I love..."

442
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:04,638
"whatever anyone has to say"

443
00:45:05,176 --> 00:45:09,579
"Your enticing kohl,
your lush tresses..."

444
00:45:09,948 --> 00:45:14,385
"your shy gaze that
lowers to my shoulders"

445
00:45:14,852 --> 00:45:19,448
"The fragrance of your lips,
the magic of your face..."

446
00:45:19,857 --> 00:45:23,452
"your charms have stolen my heart"

447
00:45:28,466 --> 00:45:33,028
"As many times as I desired you..."

448
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:41,369
"I felt love for you...
overwhelming love"

449
00:45:42,613 --> 00:45:50,611
"I feel love for you...
overwhelming love"

450
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,014
we're home.
- Hmmm.

451
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:21,345
Don't you want to go in?
- No!

452
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,411
It's said that men change
after the wedding

453
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:28,920
But you won't change, will you?
- Never

454
00:46:30,528 --> 00:46:35,363
You'll forever hold me in your arms?
- Forever

455
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:38,734
And who'll design the cars?

456
00:46:39,937 --> 00:46:41,666
Want me to tell you?
- Yes

457
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:45,602
Come here, I'll tell you.
- Hey, what are you doing?

458
00:46:45,843 --> 00:46:48,107
Don't move.
This is my laptop. Okay?

459
00:46:48,946 --> 00:46:50,937
I'll now switch it on

460
00:46:52,617 --> 00:46:54,107
what are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

461
00:46:54,285 --> 00:46:57,277
Hang on, my laptop will
fall down, stop moving

462
00:46:57,822 --> 00:46:59,687
I'm now going to make my designs.
Okay?

463
00:47:02,293 --> 00:47:04,955
You're tickling me! Let me go!
- You'll ruin my designs!

464
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:07,160
Let me go!

465
00:47:07,965 --> 00:47:11,958
Cheat! You'd forget to step on the
brakes while you're at the designs

466
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:19,398
Stop teasing me, baby! Please let go!
- Know something?

467
00:47:20,978 --> 00:47:22,969
I love the way you say baby

468
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:31,320
I wanna record your voice and
make it my ring tone. Say something

469
00:47:32,056 --> 00:47:36,390
Hi baby, Anna here.
Hi baby, Anna here!

470
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:42,999
Now wherever I go,
I'll carry your voice with me

471
00:47:43,267 --> 00:47:46,794
Relish the mangoes...
- Polishing off the mangoes, eh?

472
00:47:47,004 --> 00:47:48,733
Have one, my friend

473
00:47:51,008 --> 00:47:52,999
It's your house the mangoes
have arrived from

474
00:47:53,177 --> 00:47:56,010
They're absolutely fantastic!

475
00:47:56,447 --> 00:47:58,677
Oh yes, there's also a letter for you

476
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:30,044
Baby, why do you sound so worried?

477
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:32,044
Anna, I have to leave
for India immediately

478
00:48:32,283 --> 00:48:34,774
But what for?
- My dad is not well

479
00:48:36,354 --> 00:48:38,345
Is he okay?
- I've no idea

480
00:48:39,056 --> 00:48:42,048
Quickly pack your stuff,
I'll drop you at the airport

481
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,724
I'm already there.
My flight leaves in 30 minutes

482
00:48:46,063 --> 00:48:48,395
Okay! Call me once you reach there.

483
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,889
Okay, baby

484
00:48:50,334 --> 00:48:53,861
I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you too. Take care

485
00:48:54,272 --> 00:48:56,069
Come back soon.
- Bye

486
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:43,118
"Do come now, my sweetheart..."

487
00:49:43,454 --> 00:49:46,787
"come and see what
state I've been in"

488
00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:54,598
"Come, give me a hug..."

489
00:49:55,066 --> 00:49:58,467
"I'm yearning to see you"

490
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:55,989
"I can't tell you
how much I've loved you"

491
00:50:56,527 --> 00:50:59,758
"You are the one I have
awaited every moment"

492
00:51:00,197 --> 00:51:03,655
"Awake or asleep..."

493
00:51:04,201 --> 00:51:08,194
"yours were the memories
I was always immersed in"

494
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,781
"Parted from you, my love..."

495
00:51:27,224 --> 00:51:30,557
"I've been through hell"

496
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:41,861
"Do come now, my sweetheart..."

497
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,240
"come and see what
state I've been in"

498
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:35,951
"Ever since I've received
word from you, sweetheart..."

499
00:52:36,327 --> 00:52:39,819
"I've been on a strange high"

500
00:52:40,297 --> 00:52:43,892
"I can't spend my time,
however hard I try..."

501
00:52:44,235 --> 00:52:47,693
"your face just doesn't
melt of my sight"

502
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,778
"This good news, my love..."

503
00:53:07,124 --> 00:53:10,651
"has awakened a pining"

504
00:53:18,335 --> 00:53:21,998
"Do come now, my sweetheart..."

505
00:53:22,406 --> 00:53:25,842
"come and see what
state I've been in"

506
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:33,339
"Come, give me a hug..."

507
00:53:33,784 --> 00:53:38,016
"I'm yearning to see you"

508
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,692
"we are going so fast.
Aren't you scared?"

509
00:53:45,963 --> 00:53:48,022
"When you are with me,
I'm not scared at all"

510
00:53:48,365 --> 00:53:50,162
"In fact, this is great fun!"

511
00:53:58,909 --> 00:54:01,969
Tell me something, Arav.
Do you like Kajal?

512
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:07,808
I do, grandma.
- And Kajal? Do you like Arav?

513
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:10,181
He's the only one I like, grandma

514
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:14,790
why don't we ask Arav's parents
to let him stay with us?

515
00:54:15,392 --> 00:54:18,919
And if I send you away to Arav's place?
- That's fine with me!

516
00:54:19,396 --> 00:54:21,990
Oh no. If I'll go away,
who will take care of you?

517
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:24,401
Well, well.
I never thought of that

518
00:54:24,735 --> 00:54:26,999
Greetings.
- Greetings

519
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:30,830
Now tell me something.
What do you think of my Kajal?

520
00:54:31,742 --> 00:54:35,405
Not just me, our whole family
likes her a lot. Come here, my child

521
00:54:36,413 --> 00:54:39,211
Thank God.
Everybody loves my Kajal

522
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,909
But why are you asking all this?

523
00:54:42,686 --> 00:54:46,417
I need to ask the opinion of
her prospective in-laws, right?

524
00:54:46,824 --> 00:54:50,419
They are still very young. Let them
grow up. There's a lot of time

525
00:54:50,794 --> 00:54:54,787
They have time, but I don't

526
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:01,435
I am the only one she has.
If something happens to me...

527
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:06,105
Don't worry aunty.
I give you my word...

528
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:09,536
Kajal will surely become
the daughter-in-law of our family

529
00:55:16,453 --> 00:55:19,251
Oh yes!
Kajal, kiss this stone, will you?

530
00:55:30,467 --> 00:55:32,264
You've got a great aim

531
00:55:32,469 --> 00:55:35,029
No, it's your kiss
that does the trick

532
00:55:38,676 --> 00:55:42,476
Guess why we love each other so much?
- Why?

533
00:55:42,746 --> 00:55:47,149
Because we eat from the same plate.
It's supposed to make our love stronger

534
00:55:47,484 --> 00:55:50,078
And when it makes love stronger,
you get married

535
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:54,013
I see. No wonder grandma
was talking about our marriage

536
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:57,289
But I am going away to boarding school.
- So what?

537
00:55:57,494 --> 00:55:59,291
You'll be back during
the vacations, won't you?

538
00:55:59,396 --> 00:56:02,092
No, I'll study for the next year
during the vacations

539
00:56:02,499 --> 00:56:04,490
So you're going to forget me?

540
00:56:05,002 --> 00:56:08,301
I'm only going to study,
not to forget you

541
00:56:12,443 --> 00:56:15,173
we're wasting our time.
These trees will die

542
00:56:15,512 --> 00:56:17,503
Saplings planted in the rains
don't ever die

543
00:56:17,848 --> 00:56:21,511
Even if you forget me, these trees
will remind you of me

544
00:56:21,986 --> 00:56:23,510
Bless you, son

545
00:56:25,656 --> 00:56:26,645
Grandma!

546
00:56:29,193 --> 00:56:31,184
Go on, son. Put all your heart
into your studies

547
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:33,386
You won't forget me once you've
become a successful engineer, will you?

548
00:56:33,597 --> 00:56:35,861
No, grandma.
I'll never forget you

549
00:56:36,967 --> 00:56:39,527
Bye, Kajal.
- Sweets for you

550
00:56:39,903 --> 00:56:42,963
He's not going away forever, my dear.
It's just a matter of a few days

551
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,532
No grandma, it's a matter of years

552
00:56:46,944 --> 00:56:48,935
Don't worry, these years
will pass very soon

553
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:55,546
Congratulations, Arav. You've topped
the exams in the whole college

554
00:56:55,953 --> 00:56:58,148
You'll easily get ajob
in any automobile company

555
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:00,980
But I want to go to America for further
studies and design top line cars there

556
00:57:01,558 --> 00:57:05,153
My visa and tickets have arrived.
I'm leaving in 48 hours

557
00:57:05,496 --> 00:57:07,555
You mean, you are directly
going to the airport from here?

558
00:57:07,898 --> 00:57:12,801
No, I'll go home first. So much
must've changed in ten years

559
00:57:13,737 --> 00:57:17,036
I got to know of it only through
letters earlier. I'll get to see it now

560
00:57:17,374 --> 00:57:20,241
Now look, Arav, I have no objection
to your going away to America

561
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:23,579
But before you go,
you'll have to marry Kajal

562
00:57:23,947 --> 00:57:26,245
Marry! There's no way
I am getting married

563
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,377
But why not?

564
00:57:28,585 --> 00:57:31,577
Papa, I've got to complete my
M. Tech and settle down

565
00:57:32,022 --> 00:57:34,183
That could take 6 months
or even 6 years!

566
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:36,582
Yes dad, Arav is right

567
00:57:36,927 --> 00:57:38,588
If he's sixty by the time
he settles down...

568
00:57:38,762 --> 00:57:40,389
are we going to get him married
as an old fossil?

569
00:57:40,597 --> 00:57:43,725
Marriage isn't just a formality,
it comes with a lot of responsibilities

570
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:47,099
I've yet to stand on my own two feet,
and you want me to carry another burden?

571
00:57:48,605 --> 00:57:51,267
Daughters and daughters-in-law
are not a burden on the family

572
00:57:51,942 --> 00:57:54,934
Mom! How am I going to
make you see reason?

573
00:57:55,846 --> 00:57:59,009
I'm not mentally prepared yet
to marry Kajal

574
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:04,787
Great! I never knew you had to be
mentally prepared to get married!

575
00:58:05,522 --> 00:58:07,217
Why don't you understand
my problem, Dad?

576
00:58:07,357 --> 00:58:11,350
Please, Papa.
Marriage is a bond...

577
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:14,622
where two people come together to spend
the rest of their lives with each other

578
00:58:14,865 --> 00:58:19,029
That's true, Papa. Kajal has been
waiting for Arav for ten years

579
00:58:19,636 --> 00:58:23,197
It's better if we let her and Arav
take a decision on their own

580
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:27,734
You've changed so much, Arav

581
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,977
Everything changes
with time, Kajal

582
00:58:31,982 --> 00:58:35,179
Men change, so does
their thought-process

583
00:58:38,255 --> 00:58:45,388
Now look at this sun. It rises in the
morning and lights up the whole world...

584
00:58:46,663 --> 00:58:48,654
but set it does,
every evening.

585
00:58:49,032 --> 00:58:51,023
That's what we think, Arav

586
00:58:52,669 --> 00:58:56,662
The Sun never sets,
it just hides itself from us

587
00:58:58,108 --> 00:59:00,338
And we fool ourselves
that it has set

588
00:59:01,678 --> 00:59:04,511
Kajal, I really thought that even if
my parents don't understand me...

589
00:59:04,681 --> 00:59:07,115
you really will, because you've
known me since our childhood

590
00:59:07,484 --> 00:59:09,475
That's precisely why
I don't understand you

591
00:59:09,686 --> 00:59:12,018
Especially because I have known you
since our childhood

592
00:59:12,689 --> 00:59:16,125
You are the only one
I've ever truly known

593
00:59:18,695 --> 00:59:21,129
I still think of you
as my same old Arav

594
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:24,030
Kajal, I want to make a
few things very clear to you

595
00:59:24,701 --> 00:59:27,033
It's true that we spent
some great moments together...

596
00:59:27,337 --> 00:59:31,706
but now I neither have any
memories nor any longing for them

597
00:59:31,975 --> 00:59:34,967
You might not, but I do

598
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:40,250
Love only gets deeper with time

599
00:59:41,752 --> 00:59:44,721
why don't you understand? I don't
want to be tied down in relationships

600
00:59:47,057 --> 00:59:49,048
Ten years is a long time, Arav

601
00:59:50,394 --> 00:59:54,330
But how they went by,
one couldn't even realise

602
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:57,733
But Grandma doesn't have much time

603
00:59:59,303 --> 01:00:05,208
See if you can convince her, I've
got used to living with memories anyway

604
01:00:07,544 --> 01:00:10,741
My son, I'm counting my days

605
01:00:13,684 --> 01:00:16,346
I want to see Kajal married
before I die

606
01:00:18,222 --> 01:00:22,090
Accept my daughter, Arav.
Please marry Kajal

607
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,557
Once she's married...

608
01:00:25,762 --> 01:00:29,755
I can tell her parents that I've
come after fulfilling my duties

609
01:00:35,772 --> 01:00:40,266
"A traditional North Indian wedding"

610
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:02,296
I want to see you
as a successful man

611
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,793
The day you reach the dizzy heights
of success you want to scale...

612
01:01:09,606 --> 01:01:11,597
we can have our nuptials

613
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:16,802
I'll wait for that moment, Arav

614
01:02:27,818 --> 01:02:29,683
what a co-incidence Arav

615
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:34,618
It was raining the day you left...

616
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:40,422
and today when you have returned,
it's raining again

617
01:02:43,834 --> 01:02:45,699
I've no interest in this rain today

618
01:02:48,305 --> 01:02:50,296
I've come only to meet you

619
01:02:53,477 --> 01:02:55,468
Only to meet me...?

620
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:01,440
By saying that, you've given me
the best gift of my life

621
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,913
Today even if you ask me for my life,
I'd give it to you with a smile

622
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:12,726
I don't need your life, Kajal

623
01:03:13,263 --> 01:03:15,925
Then what is it that
you want Arav? What?

624
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,281
Divorce?

625
01:03:37,884 --> 01:03:40,717
I still can't believe that Arav
could do a thing like this

626
01:03:41,721 --> 01:03:46,055
I thought he had come back to
either stay or to take you along

627
01:03:47,727 --> 01:03:51,959
I too believed that my Arav
had come back to me

628
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:59,897
Not even in my dreams could I imagine
that he would come here for a divorce

629
01:04:00,474 --> 01:04:04,911
No, Kajal. Nobody's going to let him
break our house like this

630
01:04:05,445 --> 01:04:09,779
Dad, Mom, my husband...
nobody's going to support him

631
01:04:10,116 --> 01:04:11,743
wait till I go and tell everyone

632
01:04:13,787 --> 01:04:20,420
Pressurising him might get me
the status of his wife...

633
01:04:21,094 --> 01:04:23,085
but I won't ever get his love

634
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:25,855
So what are we going to do?

635
01:04:28,134 --> 01:04:31,433
Arav lives in every memory
I have of my childhood

636
01:04:33,707 --> 01:04:36,767
If distance has
made Arav forget his love...

637
01:04:37,744 --> 01:04:40,076
then I only have to remind him of it

638
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:46,248
I'll remind him of our love

639
01:04:48,154 --> 01:04:56,152
I'll remind him of our past.
I'll win him over again

640
01:04:58,632 --> 01:05:00,623
I am with you

641
01:05:01,935 --> 01:05:06,463
Promise me that this will remain
a secret between you and me

642
01:05:17,484 --> 01:05:19,475
Damn! No network signals!

643
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,157
Good morning, Arav.
- Good morning, sis-in-law

644
01:05:35,635 --> 01:05:38,297
So what's cooking?
- Your favourite. Porridge

645
01:05:38,805 --> 01:05:44,107
Kajal told me how much you love it.
- My favourite? What's my favourite?

646
01:05:44,578 --> 01:05:48,014
Funny! You don't even remember
your favourite dish?

647
01:05:48,782 --> 01:05:51,649
I hope your stay in America
hasn't changed your preferences

648
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:53,113
Oh no

649
01:05:53,887 --> 01:05:56,185
That's okay. Ask Kajal.
She might remind you

650
01:05:56,523 --> 01:06:00,084
Should I?
- No, I remember now

651
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:02,618
I want some tea.
Bring it to my room

652
01:06:03,129 --> 01:06:04,653
I'm giving sis-in-law a hand

653
01:06:04,864 --> 01:06:09,028
Just go to your room,
I'll send it with Kaka, okay?

654
01:06:10,537 --> 01:06:13,335
I couldn't find today's newspaper.
Could you bring it for me?

655
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:16,976
Brother's reading the newspaper.
Why don't you read it with him?

656
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:22,077
I'm going to take a shower.
Get me a towel

657
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:26,815
Listen... the towel's
already in the bathroom

658
01:06:27,554 --> 01:06:29,886
Anything else?
- Nothing

659
01:06:30,557 --> 01:06:32,718
Listen...
- Now what?

660
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:37,155
Dad has something important to discuss
with you. Have a word with him, will you?

661
01:06:37,564 --> 01:06:39,555
I'll bring your tea there. Okay?

662
01:06:46,006 --> 01:06:47,997
Come, son. Sit down

663
01:06:52,646 --> 01:06:58,585
Arav, why don't you work here in India,
instead of America?

664
01:06:59,586 --> 01:07:02,578
Daddy, I won't get that
kind of response in India...

665
01:07:02,856 --> 01:07:06,587
why? Don't they make cars in India?
There are several big companies here, Arav

666
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:12,598
Brother, the cars I have designed are
all meant for the international market

667
01:07:13,266 --> 01:07:15,257
Those cars are not meant
for Indian roads

668
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:19,161
And now when I am getting
recognition in America...

669
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:21,370
it's not wise to make a shift.
- Okay!

670
01:07:21,508 --> 01:07:23,032
But make sure you take
Kajal along this time

671
01:07:23,176 --> 01:07:25,269
That reminds me,
I have to book my ticket...

672
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:31,948
and I can't find my passport anywhere.
- Kajal, have you seen his passport?

673
01:07:32,686 --> 01:07:34,677
No, he must've kept it somewhere

674
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:37,615
I had kept it in my suitcase.
And now it's not there

675
01:07:38,091 --> 01:07:42,619
Help him find it. Will you, dear?
- Sure, Dad

676
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:55,633
You said it's not in the suitcase.
So what is this?

677
01:07:56,042 --> 01:08:00,638
I wanted some privacy with you.
- Oh!

678
01:08:02,649 --> 01:08:04,981
What? Why're you giving me
those looks?

679
01:08:05,652 --> 01:08:08,917
I see you're in a terribly
romantic mood right now

680
01:08:10,123 --> 01:08:13,456
And as far as I remember, till last
night you wanted to divorce me

681
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:16,660
And since this morning you have
been ordering me around like a husband

682
01:08:16,996 --> 01:08:21,456
Get me a cup of tea, get me the paper,
get me the towel... come to my room

683
01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:27,666
So here I am!
Tell me... what can I do for you?

684
01:08:28,742 --> 01:08:32,200
Hold the tea-cup to your lips?
Read out the paper to you?

685
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:36,211
Or take you into the bathroom
and bathe you?

686
01:08:37,016 --> 01:08:39,348
Yeah, let's do that!
Take off your clothes

687
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,089
You are wasting my time
as well as your own

688
01:08:46,025 --> 01:08:48,917
I asked you to sign those papers.
Why haven't you signed them yet?

689
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,468
So time spent with me now
is time wasted?

690
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:58,969
Then what about those past three years
that I have spent waiting for you?

691
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,574
If you wanted a divorce, why didn't you
ask for it on the night of marriage?

692
01:09:05,316 --> 01:09:12,449
Why did you ruin my three years?
Can you return those three years to me?

693
01:09:14,059 --> 01:09:18,587
This is a pointless argument, Kajal.
You'll have to sign those papers. Okay?

694
01:09:20,999 --> 01:09:23,331
It takes time to build
a relationship...

695
01:09:24,502 --> 01:09:26,493
it also takes time to break it

696
01:09:28,173 --> 01:09:33,668
I won't sign those papers so easily,
I got to show these papers to my lawyer

697
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:37,170
what will you show your lawyer?
What's he going to see?

698
01:09:37,582 --> 01:09:40,346
Who knows what you've
written in those papers?

699
01:09:40,919 --> 01:09:42,819
I'll have to consult a lawyer, right?

700
01:09:44,355 --> 01:09:47,347
So now you trust your lawyer
more than you trust me?

701
01:09:49,094 --> 01:09:51,358
You shouldn't even
talk about trust Arav

702
01:09:52,197 --> 01:09:59,194
My grandma and I trusted you.
Else, why would I marry you?

703
01:10:01,106 --> 01:10:05,099
By asking for a divorce,
you have broken everyone's trust

704
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:10,570
why should I trust you anymore?

705
01:10:12,383 --> 01:10:19,516
Okay, you may consult your lawyer but
just tell me how much time it will take

706
01:10:20,058 --> 01:10:21,855
That I can't say!

707
01:10:22,227 --> 01:10:24,718
When you can't trust anyone
easily nowadays...

708
01:10:25,063 --> 01:10:27,395
I don't know when will I find
a lawyer I can trust

709
01:10:28,466 --> 01:10:33,665
Tell me something. I have heard that in
America when a man divorces his wife...

710
01:10:34,139 --> 01:10:36,733
he goes bankrupt.
Is it true?

711
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:43,077
This is not America, this in India
and it doesn't happen in India

712
01:10:44,182 --> 01:10:51,588
True. It doesn't happen here because
a wife never divorces her husband

713
01:10:53,191 --> 01:10:56,627
But not to worry.
I'll think about it.

714
01:11:30,562 --> 01:11:32,553
Kaka! Fetch a bucket
of water. Quick!

715
01:11:32,797 --> 01:11:34,788
Go on...
- where? No!

716
01:11:35,133 --> 01:11:37,328
Go inside, I say!

717
01:11:38,136 --> 01:11:40,127
Kaka, I'll give it to him

718
01:11:45,577 --> 01:11:48,307
Are you here, Kaka?
Hurry up and give me the water

719
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:59,714
Kaka! Can't you see...?
Pour it on my hands! Hurry!

720
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,654
Kaka! You've really gone blind!
Pour it on my hands... my hands!

721
01:12:09,634 --> 01:12:11,499
What are you doing...?

722
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,498
Give me the towel.
Where's the towel?

723
01:12:18,176 --> 01:12:19,165
You!

724
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:21,773
What are you doing here?

725
01:12:22,513 --> 01:12:24,037
What noise is that in the bathroom?

726
01:12:24,182 --> 01:12:26,673
That's what happens when there are
two people in the bathroom

727
01:12:27,185 --> 01:12:29,676
Two...? You mean, Kajal and Arav?

728
01:12:30,255 --> 01:12:31,984
Watch the fun!

729
01:12:35,627 --> 01:12:40,360
There's the water.
- You played this prank, didn't you?

730
01:12:40,531 --> 01:12:41,862
No, no,

731
01:12:44,202 --> 01:12:47,535
It's hurting me...
but it's such a sweet pain

732
01:12:49,207 --> 01:12:51,004
The pain of love is always sweet

733
01:12:56,281 --> 01:12:59,216
Oh my God! What sound was that?
I think they've fallen down.

734
01:12:59,517 --> 01:13:01,212
Happens. All the time

735
01:13:18,403 --> 01:13:21,236
Aunty I'll also take a shower with you!
- Shut up!

736
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:27,744
Learn! Learn something
from your brother!

737
01:13:28,246 --> 01:13:30,237
But in the bathroom...?

738
01:13:31,249 --> 01:13:34,685
In a tight hug, smooching away...
drenched in the water!

739
01:13:41,259 --> 01:13:43,693
Hi Anna!
- Hi Arav, how are you?

740
01:13:44,495 --> 01:13:45,484
I'm fine

741
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,723
Don't pick up the phone, I was
trying your number and you called

742
01:13:48,066 --> 01:13:53,368
That's telepathy for you. We both
miss each other at the same time

743
01:13:54,272 --> 01:13:57,730
we might be in far away lands,
but our hearts are together

744
01:13:58,576 --> 01:14:02,273
Anyway, how's your dad?
- He's much better now

745
01:14:03,348 --> 01:14:06,875
So come back immediately.
I don't like it here without you

746
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:11,951
Same here, but a property
litigation has cropped up...

747
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:16,292
and I can't ignore that.
I want to get those papers signed...

748
01:14:16,861 --> 01:14:20,297
and return to you with
all my issues resolved

749
01:14:20,631 --> 01:14:22,622
Okay, baby, I love you

750
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:25,294
I love you too

751
01:14:33,811 --> 01:14:35,472
How are you?

752
01:14:36,647 --> 01:14:38,979
You didn't even inform us that
you were coming to India!

753
01:14:39,317 --> 01:14:41,308
It wasn't planned,
it happened all of a sudden

754
01:14:41,486 --> 01:14:43,386
were you missing your wife?

755
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,747
Forget about me.
Tell me what's up with you guys?

756
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:50,359
Nothing much! Days of romance are past.
We're now slaves to our wives

757
01:14:50,958 --> 01:14:53,620
Forget that. Let's do something.
- What?

758
01:14:54,027 --> 01:14:58,430
Let's play a game.
- Sure, but what game?

759
01:14:59,066 --> 01:15:01,057
Word power.
- Word power?

760
01:15:01,435 --> 01:15:03,426
What's that?
- I'll tell you

761
01:15:03,637 --> 01:15:08,370
There's always a word to explain
anything in every language

762
01:15:08,976 --> 01:15:12,036
Like "khushi" is the Hindi word
used for happiness

763
01:15:12,379 --> 01:15:15,644
Correct. That's right.
- So I'll give a word in English...

764
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:21,044
and you must translate it into Hindi.
- No problem! Simple translation!

765
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:25,089
That's okay, but what will
the winner get?

766
01:15:25,392 --> 01:15:27,656
Yeah, what's the prize?
- Whatever the winner asks for

767
01:15:27,995 --> 01:15:31,658
Sounds great! So who's the first?
- Me

768
01:15:32,733 --> 01:15:35,998
Tell me what you call
a button in Hindi?

769
01:15:36,336 --> 01:15:41,103
A button? I'll tell you! It's called
"Ast vyast vastra niyantra gotika"

770
01:15:42,776 --> 01:15:44,539
when your clothes fall off...

771
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:49,114
then the ball used to bring
them together is called a button

772
01:15:49,549 --> 01:15:51,483
Great! Mind-blowing!

773
01:15:51,918 --> 01:15:54,352
Merely saying mind-blowing
is not enough

774
01:15:54,788 --> 01:15:57,348
How about my prize?
- Anything you want!

775
01:15:57,557 --> 01:16:01,084
God bless my soul!
Give me a Punjabi kiss then!

776
01:16:03,697 --> 01:16:05,289
C'mon... let's do it!

777
01:16:06,967 --> 01:16:10,869
Enough, stop it!
It's my turn now

778
01:16:11,204 --> 01:16:15,436
One moment. If I answer your
question, what will you give me?

779
01:16:16,376 --> 01:16:18,276
Whatever you ask for.
- Yes!

780
01:16:18,478 --> 01:16:23,711
It's a promise in everybody's presence.
- Sure, all right. But what if you lose?

781
01:16:23,884 --> 01:16:28,287
Ask me the question first.
- What do you call divorce in Hindi?

782
01:16:29,389 --> 01:16:33,291
Very simple..."talaak".
- Yes! Bravo, Arav! You've won!

783
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:39,131
No Arav, you have lost. Because talaak
is an Urdu word, not Hindi

784
01:16:42,436 --> 01:16:46,304
And however hard you try,
you won't find the answer...

785
01:16:47,174 --> 01:16:50,268
because in our culture, there's
no such thing as a divorce

786
01:16:50,744 --> 01:16:53,736
So how can there be any such word?
You've lost, Arav

787
01:16:59,753 --> 01:17:05,749
Now that Kajal has won, here's her
opportunity to ask Arav for something

788
01:17:06,526 --> 01:17:09,086
what?
- Ask for whatever you wish

789
01:17:09,763 --> 01:17:11,754
Ask for something. Go on!

790
01:17:12,099 --> 01:17:15,091
Okay, I'll help you out.
Ask Arav for a kiss!

791
01:17:18,205 --> 01:17:20,503
He'd accept that punishment
with pleasure!

792
01:17:25,779 --> 01:17:31,581
"He does not understand
what my eyes convey..."

793
01:17:32,185 --> 01:17:37,122
"my beloved is so wicked"

794
01:17:37,524 --> 01:17:40,186
"Goodness me..."

795
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:48,792
"every man and woman knows
what I'm talking about"

796
01:18:09,823 --> 01:18:13,987
"Secretly, silently..."

797
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,825
"secretly, he looked
into her eyes"

798
01:18:29,943 --> 01:18:32,844
"I stole a look into his eyes..."

799
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:42,845
"I stealthily looked
into my sweetheart's eyes"

800
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,660
"How my friends burn in envy"

801
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:13,211
"when and how did you steal a look
into your beloved's eyes?"

802
01:19:17,891 --> 01:19:23,056
"I refuse to believe what you say"

803
01:19:23,497 --> 01:19:26,057
"I stole a look into his eyes..."

804
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:52,916
"O Moon, your moonlight
stokes fires of passion"

805
01:19:53,927 --> 01:19:57,920
"My wicked sweetheart
does not understand..."

806
01:19:58,365 --> 01:20:02,927
"his eyes continue to rove"

807
01:20:03,937 --> 01:20:08,271
"Secretly, stealthily..."

808
01:20:25,992 --> 01:20:30,452
"My anklets chime,
my dot shines..."

809
01:20:30,997 --> 01:20:35,195
"I can't go to sleep,
oh what do I do"

810
01:20:36,269 --> 01:20:40,638
"A fire rages in my heart,
my heart is pounding..."

811
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:45,307
"my scarf is slipping away...
oh what do I do?"

812
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:51,440
"Against my ornate bangles,
my bangles tinkle..."

813
01:20:51,985 --> 01:20:56,979
"it's driving me out of my senses,
oh how it all torments me"

814
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:14,997
"I can't spend my nights
without you anymore"

815
01:21:17,811 --> 01:21:25,240
"Secretly, I met my
beloved's gaze"

816
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:39,690
"Relent now, buddy-boy,
she's your wife after all"

817
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:42,627
"Go for her quietly,
she's your honey"

818
01:21:42,969 --> 01:21:44,834
"Be a man,
make her day sunny"

819
01:21:45,038 --> 01:21:48,030
"Give a kiss
and don't be funny"

820
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:07,053
"The clouds reach for my hand..."

821
01:22:07,327 --> 01:22:11,923
"they call me their beloved,
it scares me really"

822
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:17,063
"They hover around me,
quietly and secretly..."

823
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:22,203
"they tug at my hand...
it scares me so"

824
01:22:23,143 --> 01:22:27,739
"I'm a wanderer,
to move on is my lot"

825
01:22:28,181 --> 01:22:33,084
"Like the burning embers,
I'm a wayward lover"

826
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:51,630
"why do you try to
shackle your beloved?"

827
01:22:54,107 --> 01:23:02,105
"When and how did you
meet your sweetheart's gaze?"

828
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:08,684
"I refuse to believe
what you say"

829
01:23:09,222 --> 01:23:16,287
"Secretly, I met my
beloved's gaze"

830
01:23:16,763 --> 01:23:20,790
"Secretly, silently..."

831
01:23:26,539 --> 01:23:31,135
"with the beloved..."

832
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:40,143
"my beloved's gaze..."

833
01:23:42,522 --> 01:23:45,150
"I met secretly"

834
01:24:08,615 --> 01:24:12,176
Kajal... where did you
go and get drenched?

835
01:24:15,188 --> 01:24:17,452
She went away without
saying anything!

836
01:24:18,658 --> 01:24:22,651
This is amazing! Kajal was
drenched and so you are

837
01:24:23,196 --> 01:24:25,187
where did you go and get drenched?

838
01:24:28,201 --> 01:24:30,726
Funny! This guys walks away
without a word too

839
01:24:31,604 --> 01:24:34,198
what's up with them?
They get soaked in the bathroom...

840
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:39,205
and go out to get drenched.
- It's time you learnt from your brother

841
01:24:39,712 --> 01:24:41,873
why? Does something great happen
if you get wet?

842
01:24:42,248 --> 01:24:44,216
As if I need to explain that!

843
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:51,213
There! She hasn't said anything too.
Looks like I need to do something

844
01:24:56,563 --> 01:25:00,226
You want to talk about something, bro?
- Nothing much...

845
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,891
Finish what you're doing.
I'll catch up with you later

846
01:25:03,236 --> 01:25:06,694
what did you want to ask, brother?
- Nothing important...

847
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,235
just for the heck of it.
- Okay

848
01:25:10,276 --> 01:25:12,904
Okay...? No, no!
It's not okay

849
01:25:14,314 --> 01:25:18,774
I do have something to ask you.
- So go ahead.

850
01:25:19,586 --> 01:25:25,047
Well, what is that
getting wet all about?

851
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:30,855
What? Why have you stopped?
Ask the question

852
01:25:31,364 --> 01:25:35,926
Later.
- Why later? Ask him right now

853
01:25:36,603 --> 01:25:38,662
I might as well be
enlightened too

854
01:25:39,205 --> 01:25:40,604
what?
- Oh yes

855
01:25:41,741 --> 01:25:45,268
It had something to do with getting
drenched, isn't it bro? So ask me

856
01:25:46,279 --> 01:25:49,715
Getting drenched...?
- That's right... getting drenched

857
01:25:50,617 --> 01:25:54,280
It's like this, dad. The car Arav
has designed does not have a roof...

858
01:25:54,787 --> 01:25:58,279
so won't people get
soaked in the rains?

859
01:25:58,725 --> 01:26:02,422
Right. In the rains,
that car's going to be flooded

860
01:26:02,829 --> 01:26:08,461
Dad, this is a romantic car.
A two-seater. Only for couples

861
01:26:09,702 --> 01:26:12,432
Apart from the joy of driving,
you can even enjoy getting drenched

862
01:26:12,672 --> 01:26:16,301
But what do you do after getting
drenched? I mean, don't you feel cold?

863
01:26:17,343 --> 01:26:22,303
My son, when you have a girl with you,
you don't feel the chill

864
01:26:32,792 --> 01:26:35,852
Kajal, I'm sure this monsoon
is going to do something

865
01:26:36,829 --> 01:26:39,821
I can see its effect on Arav.
- No sister-in-law

866
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,334
This monsoon's having an effect
on everyone, accept Arav

867
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,138
It was this very rain that
once brought us together...

868
01:26:51,144 --> 01:26:54,341
but I'm afraid, it might
separate us this time

869
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:02,754
But I won't give up so easily.
As they say, pray sincerely...

870
01:27:03,156 --> 01:27:05,147
and you will even find God

871
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:09,420
And then, Arav is not just my love,
he's also my husband

872
01:27:10,763 --> 01:27:13,960
I can see only one way of getting
a divorce from her

873
01:27:14,367 --> 01:27:20,033
what's that?
- I'll produce a few witnesses in court

874
01:27:20,373 --> 01:27:25,709
what for?
- You've been in America for 3 years

875
01:27:26,379 --> 01:27:30,372
During this period, this girl has had
an illegitimate affair with two men

876
01:27:30,583 --> 01:27:31,777
Mr Lawyer!

877
01:27:35,421 --> 01:27:38,390
Now look, I don't wish to
make her life a butt ofjokes

878
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:47,056
In that case, you'll have to
apply for divorce by mutual consent

879
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:56,402
Yes, I remember.
I'll be back home soon

880
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:58,809
Okay? Bye

881
01:28:00,847 --> 01:28:04,749
That was my wife. She's fasting
for my long life today

882
01:28:06,419 --> 01:28:09,081
Very well then. Have
those papers signed...

883
01:28:09,589 --> 01:28:11,921
and I'll handle the rest
of the formalities

884
01:28:25,505 --> 01:28:29,771
Aunty, are you not thirsty?
- No

885
01:28:30,443 --> 01:28:32,843
Aren't you hungry either?
- Not at all

886
01:28:33,446 --> 01:28:35,437
But I can't remain hungry for long

887
01:28:36,516 --> 01:28:40,452
Kajal, Arav has gone to Delhi.
He'll be late

888
01:28:41,454 --> 01:28:45,584
You haven't had anything since this
morning. So go and eat something

889
01:28:45,858 --> 01:28:48,053
No, Mom.
I'll wait for him

890
01:28:49,896 --> 01:28:51,727
All these years when Arav
wasn't here...

891
01:28:51,864 --> 01:28:54,958
you ended your fast by looking
at his photograph, didn't you?

892
01:28:55,501 --> 01:29:00,461
That was different, sister-in-law.
Today he is here with me...

893
01:29:00,807 --> 01:29:03,970
he should be coming any moment,
I'll wait for him

894
01:29:04,811 --> 01:29:07,143
The young master's back!
The young master has arrived

895
01:29:11,918 --> 01:29:15,217
where were you all this while?
Kajal's been waiting for you

896
01:29:15,955 --> 01:29:19,482
You're just not bothered about her.
- What was so important...

897
01:29:19,992 --> 01:29:22,290
that you had to go away to Delhi
on the day she fasts for you?

898
01:29:22,628 --> 01:29:25,096
You could easily have gone tomorrow.
It's so irresponsible of you

899
01:29:25,565 --> 01:29:27,499
Go to your wife immediately

900
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:34,506
what the hell, Kajal! You very well
know that I want to divorce you...

901
01:29:34,907 --> 01:29:38,035
so what's this farce for?
- This is no farce, Arav

902
01:29:38,578 --> 01:29:41,843
It's our custom.
- I don't believe in such customs!

903
01:29:42,582 --> 01:29:44,846
There are so many things
you don't believe in, Arav

904
01:29:45,518 --> 01:29:50,854
But I do and so I observed
this fast for your happiness

905
01:29:51,157 --> 01:29:54,524
If you really want to see me happy,
then sign these papers

906
01:29:56,462 --> 01:29:59,522
what's wrong with me Arav?
Why don't you love me?

907
01:29:59,966 --> 01:30:01,866
Why do you want me to
sign these divorce papers?

908
01:30:02,034 --> 01:30:04,025
Because I don't love you!

909
01:30:04,537 --> 01:30:08,974
I'm in love with Anna and Anna
is waiting for me in America

910
01:30:09,876 --> 01:30:13,073
Till you don't give me a divorce,
I can't marry Anna...

911
01:30:13,846 --> 01:30:16,076
so please set me free
from this relationship

912
01:30:19,552 --> 01:30:21,543
Sign these papers!

913
01:30:39,138 --> 01:30:44,974
"I have loved you so much..."

914
01:30:46,045 --> 01:30:51,574
"but you do not love me anymore"

915
01:30:52,919 --> 01:30:58,585
"I've had so much
of faith in you..."

916
01:30:59,592 --> 01:31:05,929
"but no longer
do I trust you"

917
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:11,400
Divorce! That's a word not seven
generations of our lineage has even used!

918
01:31:11,904 --> 01:31:14,896
And you want to divorce Kajal
because you love another girl!

919
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:16,607
You're out of your mind!

920
01:31:16,776 --> 01:31:18,767
I didn't want to marry her
in the first place

921
01:31:19,011 --> 01:31:21,002
You were the ones
who forced me into it

922
01:31:22,648 --> 01:31:25,412
My son, if you end
this relationship...

923
01:31:25,885 --> 01:31:27,785
our whole family will go to seed!

924
01:31:28,087 --> 01:31:33,024
Mom, Kajal is just a friend to me.
I'm not in love with her!

925
01:31:33,526 --> 01:31:36,017
Today you don't love Kajal,
tomorrow you won't love us!

926
01:31:36,429 --> 01:31:38,420
You will leave all of us.
- Dad...

927
01:31:42,501 --> 01:31:50,135
please don't get worked up.
It's a mutual decision

928
01:31:50,509 --> 01:31:54,138
But what for?
- Because this relation...

929
01:31:54,647 --> 01:31:58,242
has reached a point from where
it's going nowhere

930
01:32:01,654 --> 01:32:09,186
Even if you wish to see me happy,
how can I be ever happy with a man...

931
01:32:11,464 --> 01:32:13,455
who doesn't even love me?

932
01:32:16,702 --> 01:32:19,330
"You are unfaithful..."

933
01:32:20,106 --> 01:32:22,666
"I have learnt"

934
01:32:23,609 --> 01:32:26,271
"where do you go away..."

935
01:32:26,779 --> 01:32:29,270
"your gaze lowered?"

936
01:32:30,349 --> 01:32:33,284
"May you be blessed..."

937
01:32:33,686 --> 01:32:36,678
"with the joys you seek"

938
01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:40,288
"Loneliness..."

939
01:32:40,693 --> 01:32:43,093
"is all I have"

940
01:32:44,163 --> 01:32:50,033
"wait for you,
I always did"

941
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:54,030
"wait for you..."

942
01:32:54,707 --> 01:32:56,698
"I never will again"

943
01:32:57,777 --> 01:33:03,147
"I have loved you so much..."

944
01:33:04,216 --> 01:33:10,382
"I love you no more"

945
01:33:12,725 --> 01:33:17,253
Parents must never force
their decisions on their children

946
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:22,725
One mistake of ours is responsible
for this situation

947
01:33:41,087 --> 01:33:49,085
Please forgive us, my child.
Our mistake has ruined your life

948
01:33:49,462 --> 01:33:53,865
No dad, you did it
only for my well-being

949
01:33:56,001 --> 01:33:58,162
Maybe it wasn't in my destiny

950
01:34:07,113 --> 01:34:08,375
My child!

951
01:34:20,793 --> 01:34:22,124
Good bye

952
01:34:52,491 --> 01:34:54,618
Aunty, are you leaving?

953
01:34:56,829 --> 01:35:01,095
You will come back, won't you?
At least to meet me?

954
01:35:15,648 --> 01:35:18,845
"How I implored you..."

955
01:35:19,185 --> 01:35:22,177
"to be loyal to me"

956
01:35:22,655 --> 01:35:25,522
"You are my own..."

957
01:35:25,958 --> 01:35:28,449
"do not ever betray me,
do not ever cheat on me"

958
01:35:36,936 --> 01:35:42,875
"For you, I could
lay down my life"

959
01:35:43,876 --> 01:35:49,337
"Lay down my life for you...
I never will anymore"

960
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:56,317
"I trusted you implicitly..."

961
01:35:57,389 --> 01:36:03,225
"Trust you, I do not anymore"

962
01:36:40,029 --> 01:36:41,826
Isn't the lawyer there?

963
01:36:41,997 --> 01:36:44,329
He's away for an important case
in Allahabad

964
01:36:45,067 --> 01:36:46,329
Okay, the documents are signed

965
01:36:46,468 --> 01:36:48,333
Ask him to complete the formalities
as soon as possible

966
01:36:48,437 --> 01:36:49,870
Very well, sir

967
01:36:50,839 --> 01:36:52,602
Hi babe, how've you been?

968
01:36:52,808 --> 01:36:54,901
Hi sweetheart!
I'm missing you so much

969
01:36:55,344 --> 01:36:56,811
I miss you too, baby

970
01:36:56,979 --> 01:37:00,142
when are you coming back?
It's been so long

971
01:37:00,549 --> 01:37:03,017
Is your work not over yet?
Did you get the papers signed?

972
01:37:03,218 --> 01:37:05,516
Yes, I've got them signed,
now there's no problem

973
01:37:05,921 --> 01:37:07,912
I'll be right there after Diwali

974
01:37:08,257 --> 01:37:10,350
Now from where did this
Diwali spring between us?

975
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:15,360
This is my last Diwali in India and then
I'll celebrate all my Diwalis with you

976
01:37:15,764 --> 01:37:19,700
All right, but you're coming here
straight to me. Okay?

977
01:37:20,102 --> 01:37:21,797
Okay, I promise

978
01:37:23,238 --> 01:37:24,466
I love you

979
01:37:24,606 --> 01:37:27,700
I love you too, babes.
You take care. Bye

980
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:41,917
Mom, dad, let's light some lamps
and perform a prayer to the Goddess

981
01:37:42,858 --> 01:37:46,521
A lamp won't bring any light with
our hearts so plunged in darkness

982
01:37:47,496 --> 01:37:49,396
This was the last thing I expected

983
01:37:50,632 --> 01:37:55,001
I thought this Diwali, all family
members would perform the prayers

984
01:37:56,405 --> 01:38:00,466
But now I feel as if the Goddess
of wealth is annoyed with us

985
01:38:00,742 --> 01:38:04,473
No daddy. The Goddess
can never be annoyed with us

986
01:38:04,746 --> 01:38:06,407
Kajal!
- Sister-in-law

987
01:38:08,851 --> 01:38:11,615
How are you?
- I'm fine, how have you been?

988
01:38:12,421 --> 01:38:14,082
May you be happy, my child!

989
01:38:14,423 --> 01:38:16,084
Kajal?
- Brother

990
01:38:16,425 --> 01:38:18,086
How are you?
- Chintu!

991
01:38:23,832 --> 01:38:26,426
Aunt has arrived!
Aunt is here!

992
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:37,435
It's Diwali night, so there
should be no darkness in the house

993
01:38:38,447 --> 01:38:40,244
Come, sister-in-law.
Let's light some lamps

994
01:38:58,467 --> 01:39:02,062
Kajal, you must have
left this house...

995
01:39:02,905 --> 01:39:04,896
but not our hearts, my child

996
01:39:06,475 --> 01:39:07,965
Very true, my child

997
01:39:08,377 --> 01:39:11,141
You are no longer our daughter-in-law.
You are now our daughter

998
01:39:38,507 --> 01:39:44,070
After ages I've seen smiling faces.
Thank you very much. Happy Diwali

999
01:39:57,092 --> 01:40:03,520
I've forwarded the case, but these
formalities take time, Kajal

1000
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:08,192
It's very important for me to get
this loan sanctioned as soon as possible

1001
01:40:08,904 --> 01:40:11,532
I can't promise you anything,
but I will definitely do my best

1002
01:40:11,873 --> 01:40:13,204
Thank you, sir

1003
01:40:16,878 --> 01:40:18,743
C'mon, Kajal. I'll drop you home

1004
01:40:19,014 --> 01:40:23,075
No, I'll wait for the bus.
- Please Kajal, come on

1005
01:40:40,969 --> 01:40:43,301
Kajal, can I ask you
for something as a friend?

1006
01:40:45,107 --> 01:40:47,098
What else do you want now?

1007
01:40:49,011 --> 01:40:51,002
Your anger is justified

1008
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:55,582
But under the circumstances,
I know I have hurt you

1009
01:40:58,053 --> 01:41:04,583
That wasn't a good thing I did.
Please forgive me, if you can

1010
01:41:07,262 --> 01:41:13,098
when you look from a distance, the
two ends of a road appears to be one

1011
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:18,763
But when the journey gets over,
you realize that they never ever met

1012
01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:23,006
Had we even lived together,
we would have never been happy

1013
01:41:26,181 --> 01:41:30,311
Can't you find a nice man
and settle down with him?

1014
01:41:32,754 --> 01:41:35,279
The end of a relationship
is not end of the world

1015
01:41:41,063 --> 01:41:45,295
But how about a girl for whom the whole
world revolved around one relationship?

1016
01:41:48,303 --> 01:41:50,294
Please stop the car.
I want to get down

1017
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:54,031
No, I'll drop you home.
I need to talk to grandma as well

1018
01:41:55,644 --> 01:41:59,637
I haven't met her in a long time.
I don't know how I'll face her

1019
01:42:10,659 --> 01:42:13,093
Everything's just as it was earlier.
Nothing has changed...

1020
01:42:21,603 --> 01:42:23,468
when did this happen?

1021
01:42:25,674 --> 01:42:27,665
Six months after you left

1022
01:42:28,677 --> 01:42:31,407
Grandma passed away and
no one bothered to inform me?

1023
01:42:33,115 --> 01:42:35,106
Grandma told us not to

1024
01:42:36,251 --> 01:42:39,687
She knew that if you got to know,
you would come back...

1025
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:44,352
and she didn't want to be
an obstacle in your success

1026
01:42:47,095 --> 01:42:54,297
And I... I was so obsessed with
achieving heights of success...

1027
01:42:56,037 --> 01:42:59,029
that I forgot my roots,
my identity

1028
01:43:04,713 --> 01:43:07,705
Grandma so badly wanted
to see my success

1029
01:43:08,517 --> 01:43:12,977
And now when the time has come,
she is no longer with us to see it

1030
01:43:15,223 --> 01:43:23,221
You have shared your grief with me,
but have you ever wondered...

1031
01:43:26,234 --> 01:43:28,225
what I went through?

1032
01:43:30,739 --> 01:43:39,238
I had no shoulder to cry on,
I was all alone

1033
01:43:54,763 --> 01:43:58,290
Arav, got some work with me?

1034
01:43:59,434 --> 01:44:05,373
Yes, actually I wanted you to
give cheque of $10,000 to Kajal

1035
01:44:05,941 --> 01:44:09,775
She needs it.
- Why should I give it to her?

1036
01:44:10,879 --> 01:44:13,211
You want to give it to her,
so do it yourself

1037
01:44:25,861 --> 01:44:30,798
$10,000 is 450,000 rupees.

1038
01:44:32,801 --> 01:44:35,395
Be honest.
Is it your first earning?

1039
01:44:35,804 --> 01:44:38,136
No, Kajal, it's...
- I don't want it

1040
01:44:39,875 --> 01:44:44,335
Kajal, please accept it.
For the sake of our friendship

1041
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:49,173
You'll need it. I'll send you more,
should you need it in the future

1042
01:44:49,818 --> 01:44:54,414
Please keep this now.
- Okay, I'll keep it

1043
01:44:55,357 --> 01:44:58,815
But I wish to show you something
before I accept it. Come with me

1044
01:45:12,941 --> 01:45:18,538
which of these must I dispatch?
- Drop this one. Send the other one

1045
01:45:19,247 --> 01:45:21,044
Call for you, madam.
- Excuse me

1046
01:45:22,517 --> 01:45:24,417
Hi, Mr. Walker. How are you?

1047
01:45:24,853 --> 01:45:26,844
Yes, your consignment
is already on its way

1048
01:45:27,455 --> 01:45:29,446
It should reach you
the day after tomorrow.

1049
01:45:29,791 --> 01:45:32,851
The new orders? I'll check
my e-mail and get back to you

1050
01:45:33,662 --> 01:45:35,527
Thank you, sir. Okay

1051
01:45:36,064 --> 01:45:38,259
when did you learn to
speak such fluent English?

1052
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:43,860
After you left, I had
to learn to keep up with you

1053
01:45:45,874 --> 01:45:47,398
Do you work here?

1054
01:45:47,809 --> 01:45:52,303
No, this is my partnership firm.
A & K Exports

1055
01:45:52,914 --> 01:45:57,476
You have a partner?
- Yes, a sleeping partner...

1056
01:45:58,253 --> 01:46:01,450
but despite repeated attempts,
he just doesn't sleep with me

1057
01:46:04,893 --> 01:46:06,690
Kaju, when did this all happen?

1058
01:46:06,995 --> 01:46:09,395
You've called me by that name
after so many years

1059
01:46:09,798 --> 01:46:11,425
Sorry, it just slipped out

1060
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,893
After you left,
I had nothing to do

1061
01:46:14,202 --> 01:46:17,899
So I got together a few girls and
women and started this factory

1062
01:46:19,941 --> 01:46:23,240
Business flourished and
I applied for a bank loan

1063
01:46:23,979 --> 01:46:27,244
But grandma objected and
she gave me 500,000 rupees

1064
01:46:27,816 --> 01:46:29,716
where did grandma get
so much of money from?

1065
01:46:29,918 --> 01:46:32,443
She had some fixed deposits
in the post office

1066
01:46:32,988 --> 01:46:35,456
Fifty thousand rupees
in ourjoint account

1067
01:46:35,924 --> 01:46:39,087
And thus, it was A K Exports.
Arav and Kajal

1068
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:46,429
Our last three years have generated
a profit of 570,000

1069
01:46:46,935 --> 01:46:50,928
Your share therefore works out
to 285,000 rupees

1070
01:46:51,373 --> 01:46:53,204
You want it in rupees or dollars?

1071
01:46:53,375 --> 01:46:55,536
Then why did you go to the bank
for a loan?

1072
01:46:56,945 --> 01:47:00,540
I have got a big order from Europe.
To execute it, I need 25 million

1073
01:47:00,815 --> 01:47:03,375
Could you come here, please?
- Sure. Excuse me

1074
01:47:18,366 --> 01:47:21,130
How we've lost track of time.
Will you have something to eat?

1075
01:47:21,536 --> 01:47:25,495
There used to be an eatery around,
remember? Famous for its parathas?

1076
01:47:26,307 --> 01:47:27,569
Yes, it's still there.

1077
01:47:27,809 --> 01:47:31,301
Remember how we used to run away
from our homes and come here to play?

1078
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:34,241
And I used to take you
for a ride on my bicycle

1079
01:47:34,449 --> 01:47:37,646
And try to scare me as well.
- But you never got scared

1080
01:47:38,053 --> 01:47:39,987
That's because you were with me

1081
01:47:42,323 --> 01:47:44,985
Kajal, isn't this the place where
we had fallen from our bicycle?

1082
01:47:45,994 --> 01:47:47,985
You do remember everything

1083
01:47:48,997 --> 01:47:50,988
I can never forget
those moments Kajal

1084
01:47:52,333 --> 01:47:57,532
whenever it rains, I can
see us cycling on these tracks

1085
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:04,334
You only remember the ride.
- No, what happened after that too

1086
01:48:06,014 --> 01:48:08,005
when lightening struck

1087
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:44,648
we planted trees somewhere here, right?
- Yes

1088
01:48:45,787 --> 01:48:47,379
They must've withered away by now

1089
01:48:47,522 --> 01:48:49,649
Anything that's planted
in the rains never dies

1090
01:48:50,091 --> 01:48:52,059
There's your tree

1091
01:48:59,067 --> 01:49:01,535
I told you Arav,
I would never let them wither away

1092
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:06,068
So this is my tree? And that one's yours?
- Yes, mine

1093
01:49:07,308 --> 01:49:09,674
They have grown, haven't they?
- Yes

1094
01:49:10,078 --> 01:49:11,409
Come here

1095
01:49:15,517 --> 01:49:18,077
Don't they look beautiful?
- Sure

1096
01:49:18,486 --> 01:49:20,351
Let's knock off some mangoes

1097
01:49:26,094 --> 01:49:27,891
Pass me a stone, will you?

1098
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:44,101
You still have a good aim

1099
01:49:44,512 --> 01:49:46,776
Kajal, it's still
the magic of your kiss

1100
01:50:09,370 --> 01:50:11,702
Take off your sweater, you'll catch cold.

1101
01:50:18,146 --> 01:50:24,142
"Rainy days usher in..."

1102
01:50:24,619 --> 01:50:30,148
"days of reunion"

1103
01:50:38,833 --> 01:50:42,963
"The pitter-patter of raindrops
ignites fires of passion"

1104
01:50:43,438 --> 01:50:47,602
"How we have begun to falter in
our stride, we're indeed in a daze"

1105
01:50:48,009 --> 01:50:52,708
"These days of rains..."

1106
01:50:53,181 --> 01:50:56,776
"bring with them
times of a reunion"

1107
01:50:57,752 --> 01:51:05,750
"The night I so looked forward to
is here at last"

1108
01:51:22,076 --> 01:51:26,206
"I burnt in the flames of fantasy.
For years, I endured separation"

1109
01:51:26,748 --> 01:51:30,809
"But this magnificent cloudburst
has rekindled my passions"

1110
01:51:31,552 --> 01:51:35,716
"These days of rains..."

1111
01:51:36,224 --> 01:51:40,217
"bring with them
times of reunion"

1112
01:51:40,895 --> 01:51:45,229
"The night I
so looked forward to..."

1113
01:51:45,667 --> 01:51:50,229
"is here at last"

1114
01:52:28,843 --> 01:52:33,610
"Neither are you in your senses,
nor am I in my senses"

1115
01:52:34,082 --> 01:52:38,416
"I might yet stray...
steady me, please"

1116
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:43,089
"Those are just my desires,
that's just my plea..."

1117
01:52:43,524 --> 01:52:47,961
"gather me in your arms tonight,
my love"

1118
01:52:50,365 --> 01:52:54,893
"Here are the days we
have felt for..."

1119
01:52:55,303 --> 01:52:59,740
"here are the days
when we meet again"

1120
01:53:00,308 --> 01:53:04,642
"The night I so badly
looked forward to..."

1121
01:53:05,113 --> 01:53:09,106
"is here at last"

1122
01:53:28,736 --> 01:53:32,900
"Youthfulness... it's crazy"

1123
01:53:33,408 --> 01:53:37,344
"A storm rages in their breath"

1124
01:53:38,346 --> 01:53:42,339
"Crazy... crazy moments"

1125
01:53:42,884 --> 01:53:47,344
"How desires seek to deceive"

1126
01:53:53,161 --> 01:53:57,359
"From my body billows a smoke..."

1127
01:53:57,732 --> 01:54:02,362
"let the clouds continue to pour"

1128
01:54:02,770 --> 01:54:06,934
"Pangs of separation,
I can take no longer..."

1129
01:54:07,375 --> 01:54:11,778
"how long am I to pine like this?"

1130
01:54:12,113 --> 01:54:16,777
"Days of love are here..."

1131
01:54:17,185 --> 01:54:21,383
"days of reunion are here"

1132
01:54:21,823 --> 01:54:26,055
"The night I so badly
looked forward to..."

1133
01:54:26,461 --> 01:54:30,830
"is here at last"

1134
01:55:10,505 --> 01:55:12,996
Arav, I am so very happy today!

1135
01:55:13,341 --> 01:55:15,241
Grandpa has decided that
we are coming to India...

1136
01:55:15,443 --> 01:55:17,934
and that's where our
wedding will take place

1137
01:55:18,446 --> 01:55:19,708
wedding?

1138
01:55:20,148 --> 01:55:23,982
We are flying out today.
I am dying to see you baby

1139
01:55:24,452 --> 01:55:29,014
I love you.
- I love you too. Bye

1140
01:55:41,402 --> 01:55:44,860
Arav, I am your elder brother
and I know you very well

1141
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:49,068
You're feeling guilty for
having wronged Kajal

1142
01:55:50,278 --> 01:55:53,270
You feel sympathetic towards her
and nothing else

1143
01:55:58,486 --> 01:55:59,976
Sit down

1144
01:56:03,658 --> 01:56:08,493
I want to know just one thing.
You have left Kajal for Anna

1145
01:56:09,931 --> 01:56:13,492
But can you leave Anna for Kajal?

1146
01:56:15,002 --> 01:56:23,501
Never. Kajal is a friend,
but Anna is my love

1147
01:56:24,545 --> 01:56:27,514
There you go!
So where's the confusion?

1148
01:56:28,549 --> 01:56:32,041
You're right, brother.
I've already divorced Kajal

1149
01:56:33,521 --> 01:56:36,957
She's my past
and Anna is my future...

1150
01:56:38,693 --> 01:56:41,025
with whom I wish to spend
the rest of my life

1151
01:56:48,536 --> 01:56:49,867
Hi Anna.
- Hi baby!

1152
01:56:50,004 --> 01:56:52,199
How are you?
- I missed you so much

1153
01:56:52,406 --> 01:56:54,135
I missed you too

1154
01:56:54,609 --> 01:56:57,339
welcome, sir.
This is my elder brother, Dr Pranav

1155
01:56:57,545 --> 01:56:58,534
Hello.
- Hello

1156
01:56:58,613 --> 01:57:00,376
And this is Anna's grandfather
and this is Anna

1157
01:57:00,548 --> 01:57:01,708
Hello.
- Hello

1158
01:57:01,983 --> 01:57:06,545
Haven't your parents come?
- Ours is an orthodox family, sir

1159
01:57:06,887 --> 01:57:09,355
They will see the bride
at a proper ceremony

1160
01:57:13,591 --> 01:57:16,492
Anna, I wish to say something to you.
- What is it, Arav?

1161
01:57:18,162 --> 01:57:21,689
There is a difference between hiding a
truth and telling a lie, isn't it?

1162
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:26,161
Yes, but why are you asking me?

1163
01:57:27,104 --> 01:57:29,163
Because I have hidden
the truth from you

1164
01:57:34,111 --> 01:57:35,976
I've a friend Kajal

1165
01:58:21,225 --> 01:58:24,626
Arav, is there any place
for me in your life?

1166
01:58:27,431 --> 01:58:31,492
Anna! For a moment I thought
I had lost you

1167
01:58:31,902 --> 01:58:34,700
For a moment,
even I misunderstood you

1168
01:58:35,239 --> 01:58:38,037
But then I realised that you had taken
the divorce for the sake of my love

1169
01:58:39,143 --> 01:58:42,237
Arav, you belong to me.
Only to me

1170
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:44,671
I will always belong to you

1171
01:58:45,649 --> 01:58:48,743
Promise me that you will
never leave me again

1172
01:58:49,253 --> 01:58:52,654
I promise, I'll always be yours

1173
01:58:54,625 --> 01:58:58,254
Arav, shall I ask you something?
- Sure

1174
01:58:59,163 --> 01:59:03,759
I wish to meet Kajal. May I?
- Of course.

1175
01:59:18,649 --> 01:59:22,085
Arav, will you keep standing
or even introduce me to Kajal?

1176
01:59:22,286 --> 01:59:25,881
Oh sorry. Kajal, this is...
- Anna. Who else could it be?

1177
01:59:26,290 --> 01:59:28,554
Hello.
- Come, take a seat

1178
01:59:32,730 --> 01:59:34,630
How are you, Arav?

1179
01:59:35,299 --> 01:59:37,767
Anna, I got some work to do.
Have a chat with Kajal...

1180
01:59:38,102 --> 01:59:40,036
I'll join you later. Okay?
- Okay

1181
01:59:51,048 --> 01:59:52,310
Kajal...
- Yes?

1182
01:59:52,483 --> 01:59:54,713
Can I ask you a question?
- Sure, go ahead

1183
01:59:57,321 --> 02:00:02,987
You don't get the feeling that I have
snatched Arav from you, do you?

1184
02:00:03,561 --> 02:00:07,725
No, Anna. When he never really belonged
to me, how could you snatch him away?

1185
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:14,133
Arav has shared neither his
sorrows norjoys with me

1186
02:00:15,339 --> 02:00:19,070
Our marriage wasn't a union of souls,
it was a compromise between two families

1187
02:00:20,344 --> 02:00:22,335
Arav never really loved me

1188
02:00:23,447 --> 02:00:29,909
Kajal, whenever a relationship breaks,
there's always a woman responsible for it

1189
02:00:30,788 --> 02:00:33,518
And I don't want to spend the rest
of my life with this feeling of guilt

1190
02:00:34,358 --> 02:00:37,350
I don't want to break your family
to build my own

1191
02:00:39,763 --> 02:00:43,859
I actually clung on to a relationship
that never really existed

1192
02:00:46,370 --> 02:00:49,703
Kajal, Arav told me
that you have a factory

1193
02:00:51,375 --> 02:00:54,173
Not a big factory like yours,
it's just a small set up

1194
02:00:57,314 --> 02:00:59,373
It's so nice to see
an independent young girl

1195
02:01:00,384 --> 02:01:02,978
It is very important
for a girl to be independent

1196
02:01:04,421 --> 02:01:09,381
Despite living in such a small city,
your ideas are so progressive

1197
02:01:10,194 --> 02:01:12,992
I am totally impressed.
It was really very nice meeting you

1198
02:01:13,664 --> 02:01:17,395
Friends now?
- Friends

1199
02:01:18,936 --> 02:01:23,999
I've no clue of Indian customs,
I've no idea how a bride dresses

1200
02:01:25,843 --> 02:01:28,937
will you help me, Kajal?

1201
02:01:32,850 --> 02:01:36,980
You've called me your friend.
And I'll definitely help a friend

1202
02:01:38,489 --> 02:01:41,981
I'll certainly help you Anna,
but on one condition

1203
02:01:44,428 --> 02:01:46,760
I want you to wear
my bridal jewellery

1204
02:01:49,433 --> 02:01:53,836
Arav, Kajal's going to help me dress.
- Yes, I heard that. Shall we go?

1205
02:01:54,538 --> 02:01:56,438
Bye, Kajal.
- Bye

1206
02:02:48,826 --> 02:02:51,488
Kajal, do you have any idea
what you are doing?

1207
02:02:52,296 --> 02:02:55,663
You are strangling your love
with your own hands

1208
02:02:56,767 --> 02:03:03,764
You won't be able to do it. You have
loved Arav more than yourself

1209
02:03:04,975 --> 02:03:10,311
It's going to kill you, Kajal.
Take my advise. Go away from here

1210
02:03:12,316 --> 02:03:14,511
How can I run away
from myself, sister-in-law?

1211
02:03:16,653 --> 02:03:20,521
Every tree, every leaf here
has been witness to my love

1212
02:03:22,526 --> 02:03:25,324
Every lane shares a bond
with my love

1213
02:03:26,964 --> 02:03:29,933
The clouds and the rains here have
culminated in my love, sister-in-Iove

1214
02:03:31,468 --> 02:03:34,028
And tomorrow, when I come back...

1215
02:03:35,539 --> 02:03:40,533
won't they ask me where I was,
when they saw my love being set afire?

1216
02:03:43,547 --> 02:03:45,139
No, sister-in-law

1217
02:03:47,551 --> 02:03:51,214
I will myself give my love
a decent funeral

1218
02:03:52,089 --> 02:03:55,991
"A thousand goals there will be..."

1219
02:03:56,660 --> 02:04:01,962
"a thousand caravans there will be..."

1220
02:04:03,233 --> 02:04:06,566
"your eyes will look for me..."

1221
02:04:07,471 --> 02:04:13,899
"but there's no saying
where I will be"

1222
02:04:25,956 --> 02:04:29,585
"My love, O my sweetheart..."

1223
02:04:29,893 --> 02:04:32,885
"I'm going dress your bride"

1224
02:04:33,597 --> 02:04:36,760
"I'm going to adorn your bride"

1225
02:04:45,609 --> 02:04:52,412
"The promise I made to you,
I will honour"

1226
02:04:53,283 --> 02:04:56,616
"I will keep my promise"

1227
02:05:48,772 --> 02:05:52,333
"Amidst the shadow
of the glittering stars..."

1228
02:05:52,676 --> 02:05:55,668
"may you be protected
from the evil eye"

1229
02:06:04,621 --> 02:06:08,250
"I'll give you all my love..."

1230
02:06:08,692 --> 02:06:11,684
"I'll dedicate my life to you"

1231
02:06:14,498 --> 02:06:19,026
"Although my eyes seem cheerful,
I weep at heart"

1232
02:06:20,704 --> 02:06:22,501
"when I take the blow..."

1233
02:06:22,706 --> 02:06:25,698
"Oh... how it hurts"

1234
02:06:28,145 --> 02:06:31,410
"My love, O my sweetheart..."

1235
02:06:31,715 --> 02:06:38,712
"I shall endure all the pain"

1236
02:06:39,823 --> 02:06:46,729
"I will dress your bride"

1237
02:07:39,116 --> 02:07:46,113
"I know it's difficult,
it's a moment of test"

1238
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:50,451
"I will be shattered
in a moment..."

1239
02:07:50,861 --> 02:07:53,796
"I will transcend every limit"

1240
02:07:56,833 --> 02:08:01,327
"when I smile, she thinks
I'm in the habit of smiling"

1241
02:08:02,606 --> 02:08:05,803
"Blissfully ignorant,
little does she know..."

1242
02:08:06,810 --> 02:08:09,404
"this is my way
of hiding my grief"

1243
02:08:10,747 --> 02:08:13,375
"Oh my love, sweetheart..."

1244
02:08:13,850 --> 02:08:21,256
"I shall keep smiling like this"

1245
02:08:22,225 --> 02:08:29,393
"I will dress your bride,
O sweetheart"

1246
02:08:33,904 --> 02:08:41,174
"I will fulfill every promise
I've made to you"

1247
02:09:02,866 --> 02:09:06,859
"O sweetheart..."

1248
02:09:07,604 --> 02:09:12,337
"my dearest love"

1249
02:09:53,583 --> 02:09:57,246
Please stand up for the vows and take
the rounds of the sacred fire

1250
02:10:09,266 --> 02:10:11,257
This wedding is not happening!

1251
02:10:14,004 --> 02:10:16,199
This wedding can't take place!

1252
02:10:21,878 --> 02:10:25,279
Why can't it take place?
- Your divorce hasn't come through yet

1253
02:10:25,749 --> 02:10:27,478
what rubbish!

1254
02:10:27,818 --> 02:10:30,286
I myself got the papers signed
by Kajal and dropped them at your office

1255
02:10:31,121 --> 02:10:34,113
You got the papers signed by Kajal,
but you forgot to sign them yourself

1256
02:10:40,030 --> 02:10:42,965
You mean they are not divorced yet?
- No, not as of now

1257
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:44,961
One moment, please

1258
02:10:45,368 --> 02:10:49,964
Mr. Lawyer, if he signs the papers right
now, then will the divorce be complete?

1259
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:52,638
Of course it'll be complete.
What am I around for?

1260
02:10:52,776 --> 02:10:54,971
Does anyone here have a pen?

1261
02:10:56,079 --> 02:10:57,569
A pen, please

1262
02:11:00,984 --> 02:11:04,420
what nonsense! There are so many
people around and nobody has a pen?

1263
02:12:15,158 --> 02:12:19,390
Arav, even God doesn't want you
to sign these papers

1264
02:12:21,064 --> 02:12:24,056
Today I have realized
what true love is

1265
02:12:25,669 --> 02:12:27,660
Do you remember
the Chinese Temple?

1266
02:12:28,104 --> 02:12:33,064
What was written on that cookie,
"Today you will meet your destiny"

1267
02:12:34,511 --> 02:12:38,174
That was so true,
only we took time to understand it

1268
02:12:40,083 --> 02:12:47,649
Had I not come into your life, you
wouldn't ever have come to divorce Kajal

1269
02:12:49,092 --> 02:12:52,619
And you would never realised
how much you love her

1270
02:12:54,297 --> 02:12:57,095
I've only been a medium
to take you closer to Kajal

1271
02:12:59,102 --> 02:13:01,093
Kajal is your destiny

1272
02:13:01,504 --> 02:13:04,701
Do you really think you
forgot to sign these papers?

1273
02:13:07,110 --> 02:13:09,670
No, it was divine intervention

1274
02:13:20,490 --> 02:13:26,122
we often realize our mistakes
after losing our loved ones

1275
02:13:30,233 --> 02:13:37,230
You are lucky that Kajal
is still part of your life

1276
02:13:38,808 --> 02:13:41,743
Stop her.
Don't let her go away

1277
02:13:44,147 --> 02:13:46,138
Go on

1278
02:13:48,485 --> 02:13:50,749
Don't say a word.
Just go

1279
02:13:52,288 --> 02:13:57,749
Before I break down...
just please go away

1280
02:14:06,970 --> 02:14:10,963
No! He can't go away like that!
He can't do this to my child!

1281
02:14:11,207 --> 02:14:14,199
Let him go, grandpa.
His goal lies elsewhere

1282
02:14:17,180 --> 02:14:19,512
That I met Arav was
merely a coincidence

1283
02:14:20,417 --> 02:14:23,352
But it's not in my destiny
to have him for myself

1284
02:14:24,187 --> 02:14:27,520
He has betrayed you!
I'm going to ruin him!

1285
02:14:27,824 --> 02:14:30,657
You will do nothing
of the sort, grandpa!

1286
02:14:36,232 --> 02:14:42,330
Arav loves me very dearly. It's just
that he loves Kajal a bit more

1287
02:14:48,812 --> 02:14:54,341
I knew I'd find you here.
- Why have you come here?

1288
02:14:55,351 --> 02:14:57,216
I've come to ask you something

1289
02:14:59,355 --> 02:15:00,344
what?

1290
02:15:00,757 --> 02:15:04,750
Why did you sign the divorce papers?
- You were the one who forced me to

1291
02:15:05,228 --> 02:15:09,756
Couldn't you have turned me down?
- How could I? You don't even love me

1292
02:15:10,567 --> 02:15:13,764
who says I don't love you?
- You did

1293
02:15:14,237 --> 02:15:16,228
Forget what I said

1294
02:15:18,241 --> 02:15:19,833
Look at me

1295
02:15:22,846 --> 02:15:24,837
Tell me something, Kajal

1296
02:15:25,348 --> 02:15:28,249
who took you out cycling?
- You

1297
02:15:29,652 --> 02:15:31,745
who ate raw mangoes with you?
- You

1298
02:15:33,289 --> 02:15:35,780
who spent hours with you in the rains?
- You

1299
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:39,751
who haunted you in your dreams?
- You

1300
02:15:40,997 --> 02:15:44,694
If I was the one who did all this,
I also loved you

1301
02:15:46,369 --> 02:15:50,271
I have walked out of my wedding altar
to come to you today!

1302
02:15:51,007 --> 02:15:52,998
Because I have realised...

1303
02:15:53,776 --> 02:15:56,267
I only love you, Kaju.
Only you

1304
02:16:03,286 --> 02:16:07,780
Now quickly give me a kiss.
- First you close your eyes

1305
02:16:08,124 --> 02:16:13,858
No. Today I won't shut my eyes.
I want to see how well you kiss
