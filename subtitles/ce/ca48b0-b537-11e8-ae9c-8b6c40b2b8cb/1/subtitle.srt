1
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,539
<i>And by the way, honey,
with all this décolletage</i>

2
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:33,000
<i>you should be getting
a lot more dickoletage
than what he has to offer.</i>

3
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,961
<i>And as I can recall it,</i>

4
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,963
<i>you were the one that told me
that when he came,</i>

5
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,673
<i>it was as thin
as coconut water.</i>

6
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,424
<i>Honey, that's
a dealbreaker for me.</i>

7
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,551
<i>It was that thin.</i>

8
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:44,136
<i>Well, I see we 're settling
for less nowadays.</i>

9
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,600
That's beyond.

10
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,565
Mrs. Morrow,
a package arrived for you.

11
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:57,567
I found it in the mailbox
this morning.

12
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,278
May I ask you who you'd like
on duty this weekend?

13
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,573
Um, actually, why don't
you give everybody
the weekend off?

14
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:04,866
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah.

15
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,659
We might go to
the beach house and, uh,

16
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,036
if not, it might be nice
to have a weekend alone.

17
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,081
I'll let everyone know.
Thank you.

18
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,128
Oh, damn it.

19
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,213
- Christopher?
- Yes?

20
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:22,466
I'm sorry. Can you
help me open this?
I just got a paper cut.

21
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:24,677
Yeah, of course.
Here, let me do it.
Thank you.

22
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,346
Yeah, yeah.
I just... A paper cut.

23
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:34,312
There's a note.
You can read it.

24
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,900
"Dear Susan, I've written
a novel that will be
published in the spring.

25
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,735
"It's different from
the kind of things
that I was writing

26
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,612
"when we were together."

27
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,032
Go ahead.

28
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,409
"In the end you left me
with the inspiration
thatlneeded

29
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,535
"to write from the heart.

30
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:52,455
"I wanted you to be
the first to read it,
so I'm sending along a proof.

31
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,290
"I will be in LA until
Wednesday on business

32
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,084
"and it would be good
to see you after so long.

33
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,670
"My cell number
and email address
are below. Edward."

34
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:02,924
Thanks.

35
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:16,729
Morning.
Good morning.

36
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,942
What's that?
It's a manuscript
Edward sent me.

37
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,693
He wrote a novel.

38
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,737
Edward who?

39
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,448
Edward, my first husband.
You remember him.

40
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,450
I didn't know he could write.

41
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,786
Yes, you did.
He was writing a novel
when you and I got together.

42
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,329
You just don't remember.

43
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,748
Have you guys even talked
in 20 years?

44
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,500
19.

45
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:43,130
No. I tried calling him
a couple of years back,
but he hung up on me.

46
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,258
I think he's teaching English
at some prep school in Dallas.

47
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:48,386
It's sad, really.
He never remarried.

48
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:52,890
Where were you
last night? You didn't
come by the gallery.

49
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,477
I'm sorry. Really, I...

50
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,646
By the time I left
the office, I was late
for my dinner and...

51
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,606
It would have
taken you 15 minutes.

52
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,234
Fifteen minutes, and it would
have meant a lot to me.

53
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,696
Never mind.

54
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,908
You didn't come
to bed last night.
I didn't wanna wake you.

55
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,452
Yeah.

56
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:18,082
Well, I wasn't asleep.
I was too wound up
from the opening.

57
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,712
It went well, by the way.
Apparently.

58
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,380
Good.
Yeah.

59
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,803
Look, why don't you and I
go to the beach?

60
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,597
We can go tonight
and come back on Monday.

61
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,269
Maybe if we
just spent some time,
just the two of us?

62
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:46,110
Why are you wearing
this blazer on a Saturday?

63
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:49,530
Because I gotta
go back to the office,

64
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,867
and then I gotta go
to the airport, and then
I gotta go back to New York.

65
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,244
You just came from there.
Yes, I know.

66
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,247
But I have to go again
if I wanna get this deal done,

67
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,583
and I don't wanna have to sell
anything else.

68
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,460
Shit.
It's okay.

69
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,549
You know,
the strange thing is is,

70
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,469
I don't really care
about all this art.

71
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:17,183
That doesn't sound like you.
I know, but it's true.

72
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,810
I care.

73
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,979
It pisses me off.

74
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,523
I know you do.

75
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,235
Don't worry,
I can fill the walls
with some new LA artists

76
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,739
and people will think
we're ahead of the curve
instead of going broke.

77
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,407
You won't have
to be embarrassed.

78
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,216
Are things a little better?

79
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,468
He's just having a hard time
with his business right now.

80
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,678
Carlos told me.

81
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,515
I'm surprised. I thought
we were hiding it pretty well.

82
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:00,434
Hutton would be very upset
to find out anybody knew.

83
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:03,020
He just hates not to win.

84
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:05,481
Are you sleeping?

85
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,650
Did you call my
psychopharmacologist?
Did you call him?

86
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,652
You should call him,
because he's a genius.

87
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,239
I'm worried
about you, seriously.

88
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,074
Just look at me for a second.
Look at me.

89
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,578
You scared me
the last time we talked.

90
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,580
I'm fine.

91
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:24,416
I am fine. lam...

92
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:28,295
lam. I just can't believe
that I told you
all of those things.

93
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,339
I'm just kind of
embarrassed, you know.

94
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:35,469
Because what right
do I have to not be happy?
I have everything.

95
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,429
I feel ungrateful
not to be happy.

96
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,599
As much right
as anyone, Susan,
as much right as anyone,

97
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,393
because it's all relative.

98
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:49,608
You're just awfully hard
on yourself.

99
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,944
How do you do it?

100
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,866
You mean with Carlos?
I just... It's...
I'm totally cool with it.

101
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:00,703
And having a gay husband
is not such a bad thing,
you know?

102
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:06,333
We're best friends.
We love each other completely.

103
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,794
I'm certainly
the only woman in his life.

104
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:11,672
And that lasts
longer than lust, doesn't it?

105
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,757
It's forever, really.

106
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,343
Hutton and I don't have that.

107
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,429
Did you ever?

108
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:22,558
I think we just
want different things,
or I want different things.

109
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,437
Do you still love him?

110
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,901
I'm being summoned. Pardon me.

111
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,737
He has to catch a plane.
I'm gonna say goodbye.

112
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,828
I hope this deal
works out for you.

113
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,789
I really do.
I know you need it.
We need this.

114
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,792
No. You need this.

115
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,673
Bye.
Bye.

116
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:04,934
<i>So I said,</i>

117
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,894
"Well, my mother
always told me

118
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,356
"if you massage your pussy
with Pam cooking spray

119
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,941
"a month before
the baby comes,

120
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,901
"you don't need
vaginal rejuvenation."

121
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,529
I've gotta get some Pam.

122
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,617
And she is going to get
a nomination this year.

123
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,827
A nomination? She's gonna win.

124
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,082
Let's talk about your opening.

125
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,834
My favorite subject.
Not mine.

126
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:35,256
The opening was
spectacular last night.

127
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,132
Really?
That's what you thought?

128
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,093
What, you didn't?
No.

129
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,428
I thought the work
was incredibly strong.

130
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:45,432
So perfect with
all this junk culture
that we live in.

131
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:48,269
It'sjunk. It isjunk.

132
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,980
Total junk.

133
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,858
Darling, you are
a big success.

134
00:12:55,567 --> 00:13:00,281
No one really likes
what they do.
Then why do we do it?

135
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:01,740
Because we're driven.

136
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,369
Maybe a bit insecure.

137
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,623
We get into things
when we're young

138
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,875
and because we think
they mean something.

139
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,837
And then
we find out that they don't.

140
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:22,511
Oh, Susan, enjoy
the absurdity of our world.

141
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,930
It's a lot less painful.

142
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:30,769
And believe me, our world
is a lot less painful
than the real world.

143
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,907
Yeah, why are we driving
this old thing to Marfa?

144
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,202
Becauseljusthadit
completely rebuilt.
It's a classic.

145
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,662
It has a terrible
sound system.

146
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,706
Well, you're gonna have
to suffer through that.

147
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,708
You have two sets
of boots, India?

148
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:37,461
Do we really
have to stop tonight?
I'd rather just get there.

149
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,130
All right, ask your mother.
She's the boss.

150
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,968
I set the alarm.

151
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,655
India, you've been
on that thing for hours.

152
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,577
I thought you were
the one who wanted
to drive all night.

153
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:14,665
I did, but what are we
supposed to do, sing
campfire songs or something?

154
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,799
- How much longer?
- I don't know.

155
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,803
Like three,
three and a half hours.

156
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,347
Well, Dad,
you're gonna get your wish.

157
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,433
My cell service just went out.

158
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,977
Jesus, can you believe
there's no service here?

159
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,603
How is that even possible?

160
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,231
Two of the things
I love most about west Texas,

161
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,191
no phones and no people.

162
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,013
Oh, come on.

163
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,627
Total jerks.
Are we rid of them?

164
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,255
India, don't do that.
What?

165
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,508
What? What'd she do?
She just gave 'em the finger.

166
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,053
Mom. Mom, I'm scared.
Tony.

167
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,222
Speed up.

168
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,474
It's all right,
it's all right.
No, I don't like this.

169
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:38,767
It's all right.

170
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,144
Speed up. Tony.

171
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,313
Shit. Oh, good.

172
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,024
Just let 'em go. Let 'em go.

173
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,905
India, don't look at them.

174
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,157
But, they're...
Just don't give
them any reason.

175
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,537
Why is he smiling like that?

176
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,373
I don't know,
sweetheart. It's all right.
It's all right.

177
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,589
Wh00!

178
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:09,715
He's crazy.

179
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,676
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

180
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,057
Shit.

181
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,023
Hey, motherfucker, pull over.
Pull the fuck over!

182
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,066
Oh, God, Tony.

183
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,327
India. ls your phone
working yet, India?

184
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,579
No, no, but I took down
the license number.

185
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,379
No.

186
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,384
No.

187
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,386
Oh, n0.

188
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,017
Pull over.
Pull the fuck over!
Dad. Dad.

189
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,936
Hey, asshole, pull over.
Pull over.

190
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,398
Oh, no.
What do you
want from us?

191
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,734
Easy, easy. Easy, easy!

192
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,195
Stop it!

193
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,241
Shit.

194
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,703
Hey, come on!

195
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,685
Don't worry, honey. It's okay.

196
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,528
They probably
have a gun.

197
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,196
Please, Tony, pull out.

198
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,615
I can't move.
He's blocked the car.

199
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:01,660
What's he doing?

200
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:15,048
It's okay.
Don't get out the car.

201
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,842
I'm not getting
out of the car, sweetheart.

202
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,227
Good evening.
Good evening.

203
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,521
You know you're supposed
to stop when there's
an accident, right?

204
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,357
Yeah, I know that.
Why didn't you stop, then?

205
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,987
That won't work.

206
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,322
No signal here.

207
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,201
You're not supposed to leave
the scene cf an accident.
It's a crime.

208
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:46,580
After the way
you were driving...
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

209
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,249
Just the way you were
driving was crazy.

210
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,959
Hey, Turk.

211
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,090
Don't come any closer.
All right, sweetheart.
It's all right.

212
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:00,093
You know, pleasejust
get back in your car now
and leave us alone.

213
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,637
Calm down. We got
an accident to report,
that's all.

214
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,432
Calm down.
Hey, lady, lady, lady.
It's a flashlight, sweetheart.

215
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,185
It's just a flashlight.
It's all right.

216
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:12,773
Jesus Christ.
Okay, so let's
exchange information.

217
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,357
Information?
Yeah.

218
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,985
Let's exchange information.
Get it out of
the glove compartment.

219
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:20,238
Okay, I'm a Gemini.
My favorite c:olor's
pale pink.

220
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,699
I like long walks and kittens.

221
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:39,466
We should... You know what?
We should call the police.

222
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,260
Oh, oh? Really?
Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,595
That's a great idea.

224
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,889
It was your
fucking fault, right?
What?

225
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,642
It doesn't matter
whose fault it was.
Let's get going.

226
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,310
Hey, Ray, these guys
have got a flat tire.

227
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,437
They sure do.
Well, what do you know?

228
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:56,191
What'd he say?
Don't believe it, Dad.

229
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,151
- He said we had a flat tire.
- What did he say?

230
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,111
Don't believe him.
We don't have a flat.

231
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:05,450
What?
What?

232
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,078
Yep, your left tire's flat.
It sure is.

233
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,957
Must have bust it when
you were shoving us
off the road.

234
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,668
We did not shove you
off the road.
You shoved us off the road.

235
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,879
It's a lie.
You think I'm a liar?

236
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:19,214
It's okay. It's okay.

237
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,341
She'sjust a child.
You think I'm a liar?

238
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,469
No, she's not
saying that, man.
She's just a child.

239
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:30,559
You don't got a flat,
go on, drive.

240
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:34,062
Start the engine and drive.
Please drive. Just drive.

241
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:37,315
Just drive on it,
asshole. Nobody's
stopping you. Drive away.

242
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,317
Go. Fuck off.

243
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,152
Stupid motherfucker.

244
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:45,031
- Shit. God damn it!
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

245
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,242
Oh, God.
It's okay. It's all right.

246
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,870
It's not okay.
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

247
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,247
What are we gonna do, Tony?
What are we gonna do?

248
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,416
What are we gonna do, Tony?

249
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,793
I tell you what.

250
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:59,546
We'll fix it for you,
won't we, guys?

251
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,631
Yeah, sure.

252
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,509
Really?
Yeah.

253
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,761
Just to show you we're okay,
we'll fix it for you.

254
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,054
You won't have to do a thing.

255
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,849
Then we'll go
to the cops together, right?

256
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,560
You and me,
report your accident.
All right.

257
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:14,936
Thank you.
Sound good?

258
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,229
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

259
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:18,523
- You got tools, mister?
- Um, lactually, I...

260
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,775
No need. Use ours.
Come on, let's get going.

261
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,193
No, it's fine,
it's just fine.

262
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:25,614
I can't fix a tire,
so I can't...
I need their help.

263
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,532
Please don't make
eye contact with them.

264
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,337
You got a spare tire, man?

265
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,507
Can't change a tire
without a spare.

266
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:47,260
You wanna give me
the keys to the trunk?

267
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,888
No,don1.
Vvhothefuck

268
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,974
Just pop the trunk, honey.

269
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,852
I got it.

270
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,647
That's all right, I got that.
That's fine.

271
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,191
It's right underneath here.
There you go.

272
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,360
Just right under there.

273
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,820
Just got a lot
of things in here.

274
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,036
It's just right under there.

275
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,665
Sorry.
Get the women
out of the car.

276
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,750
Come on, get 'em out.

277
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,670
Come on, man.

278
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,422
Gotta lift your car up
on the jack, so get 'em out.

279
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:31,972
Dude. Has he gotta lift
your wife and your child
and the car?

280
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,807
Right, right.
Get your women out the car.

281
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,476
It's all right, honey.
Just get out of the car.
They need to fix the car.

282
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,063
They're fine.
They're just fixing the tire.

283
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,903
Come over here.

284
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,240
Come on, here.
Have you seen
what you did to my car?

285
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:55,662
You think you're fucking
hotshH,don%you?
What are you talking about?

286
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:57,831
They definitely think
they're fucking hot shit.

287
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,207
Who?
Are you serious?

288
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:02,210
Your bitches, man.
Who else?
TCDNYI LOOK...

289
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:05,672
No, you think you're
so special, you can just
bump another guy's oar...

290
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:09,134
No, we were just trying
to get... You were playing
some kind of crazy game.

291
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,013
Hey!

292
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,145
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

293
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,272
Oh, my...

294
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,487
There goes your cops.

295
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,241
You should have tried harder
to stop 'em.

296
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,286
That's okay. It's okay.
We'll take good care of you.

297
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,875
Fucking bitch.
Uppity rich bitch.

298
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,793
I'll teach you
a fucking thing or two.

299
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:47,964
It's okay.

300
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,888
What? What you looking at?

301
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,765
Hotshot.
What do you mean?

302
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,059
What are you trying
to do there on the road, huh?

303
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,936
What? I...
What are you talking about?

304
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,939
Look, look, look...

305
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:10,403
We... We are... We are
just trying to get where...
Where we are going.

306
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:11,571
Where's that?

307
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,617
I said where you going?
To Marfa.

308
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,702
What exactly is in Marfa?

309
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,538
Hey, motherfucker...
Hey!

310
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,540
Leave my
dad alone, asshole!
Leave me alone, man.

311
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:23,625
Fuck you, baby.

312
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,085
She didn't mean that.
She's just a kid.

313
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,753
Your daddy won't tell me,
so why don't you?

314
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,922
Let me go!
What's it to you anyway?

315
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,466
Look, we're nice guys.
Don't touch my daughter!

316
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,093
We're just trying to get
to where we're going.

317
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,806
You wanna dance? Wanna dance?

318
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:39,724
Oh, is that it? That all?

319
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,811
Baby, look at your daddy.
He thinks he's so much
better than me, huh?

320
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:44,354
What do you think?
What do you think?

321
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,815
Well, he is.
I mean, seriously,
look at him.

322
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:48,900
Let her go!

323
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,528
You're scum, you know!

324
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,322
No! No!
Hey! Hey, get off.

325
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,287
Hey, watch it,
you fucking assholes.

326
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,748
You got no fucking right
talking to me like that.

327
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:07,544
Christ's sake!
Fixing your goddamn tire.

328
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,672
Let's go and get
the fuck out of here, y'all.

329
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:12,257
India.

330
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,927
Don't cry, sweetie.
It's fine.

331
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,221
You all right over there?
Need a tissue?

332
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:22,559
God damn, that looks bad.
You might need...

333
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,727
I'm fine.
Hey, honey, you got a tampon?

334
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:27,147
Your nose looks like shit.
All right, I'm fine.

335
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,233
I mean it looks like shit.
I'm fine.

336
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,986
This is bad news. We good?

337
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,154
We're good. We're set.

338
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:35,321
- We're good to go.
- Let's go.

339
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:36,447
All right.
We're good.

340
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:37,907
All right.
Yeah.

341
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,036
How far up the road
till we can get a signal?

342
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,746
Why do you wanna get
further up the road?

343
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,874
So you can leave the scene
of an accident again?

344
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:48,084
Leave him alone.

345
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,174
There's service up by Bailey.
All right.

346
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,967
How do you think
we're gonna get there, though?

347
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,303
In our cars.
Which car?

348
00:27:58,386 --> 00:27:59,971
In both cars.

349
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:02,348
Mister, don't try no fucking
shit with me.
What?

350
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,310
You heard me.
I know what you're doing.
I know what your plan is.

351
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,770
What is the matter?
Don't try no fucking
shit with me.

352
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:11,191
No, what is the matter, man?
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

353
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,819
How do I know you ain't
just gonna floor the gas
and leave me in the dust?

354
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:17,614
You get in your oar
and we'll get in ours
and we'll follow you there.

355
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,200
Fuck you! No way.
You go in my car.
What?

356
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:22,577
You come with us.
Lou can drive your car.

357
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,662
No, I'm not gonna do that. No.

358
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:28,416
Okay, fine, you drive your car
and the girl comes with us.

359
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,919
- What? No!
- You come with us, baby.

360
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:32,921
Listen, honey, I ain't
after your fucking ass.

361
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,255
No, don't touch me.

362
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:35,798
You are not doing that.

363
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,597
Yeah, baby.
You like it like that, huh?
Let me go!

364
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,724
No. Hey, wait!

365
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,309
What are you doing?

366
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,353
Stop!
Get off her, please!

367
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:49,812
Go over there.

368
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,314
Get your hands off her!

369
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:52,774
India.

370
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:56,110
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
I love you.

371
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:57,445
India...

372
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:01,074
- Let go of me, please.
- Get your hands off her.

373
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,367
Shit.

374
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,660
India...

375
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:06,704
Look what
you gone and did.

376
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:09,832
Hey, hey.
It's okay.

377
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,418
She the boss?
Is she the boss
of your family?

378
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:15,046
Laura?
Have you got a vagina?

379
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,215
Have you got
a fucking vagina there?

380
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:18,549
Hey!

381
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:19,801
- Laura!
- Vagina boy!

382
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:21,928
Just get her in the car.
Get her in the car.
Vagina boy!

383
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:24,472
Stay away!
You want fucking
something, boy?

384
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:25,598
- Tony.
- You want something?

385
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:26,766
- Tony.
- Laura.

386
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,394
- Get in the car.
- Okay, here we go.

387
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,688
We're goin' in both cars.
Hey, Lou.

388
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:33,439
No.

389
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,364
Dad.Dad.

390
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,116
Hey!
Dad.Dad.

391
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,784
Hey! Wait! No.

392
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:48,705
No! Please, no!
No! No! Please...

393
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:08,808
Susan?

394
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,561
Why didn't you call me
and let me know
you got in safely?

395
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:14,022
'Cause it's 4:00
in the morning.
I didn't wanna wake you.

396
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:17,150
<i>If you can't sleep,
why don't you take
one of your pills?</i>

397
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,152
Where are you?

398
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,654
I'm just walking
in the door of the hotel.

399
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,115
What floor, sir?
31, please.

400
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:25,742
That's not our usual floor.

401
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,746
No, our regular room
wasn't available.

402
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,707
<i>You should have seen
the scene I caused
in the lobby.</i>

403
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,129
I hope you got some sleep
on the plane.

404
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:41,549
<i>I do worry about you.
Even though you think
that I don't, I do.</i>

405
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,260
You must be exhausted.

406
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:46,929
I hate that flight.
It's really not...
31, madam.

407
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:52,685
<i>I'm at my floor.
I gotta run. I'll call you
later, okay? Susan?</i>

408
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,068
<i>Susan, can you hear me?</i>

409
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:06,282
Yes. Yes, I heard you.

410
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,287
Get some sleep.

411
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,188
You're driving.

412
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,119
Is this the exit?
Exit for what?

413
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:52,745
Well, for Bailey.
Keep going.

414
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:04,006
Keep going. Speed up.

415
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:16,102
What the fuck
are you doing to us?
Here. Turn down here.

416
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:19,480
No, fuck you.
lam not going down that road.

417
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,775
Listen, mister, you wanna
see your wife and kid?

418
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:26,612
Then turn down the road.

419
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,740
You gonna cry now?

420
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,065
That's my car we just passed.

421
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,234
It ain't your car, man.
Keep going.

422
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:09,238
I don't think you need
to worry about
your wife and kid.

423
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,784
Like I say, you don't
need to worry about them.

424
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,996
What do you mean, I don't
need to worry about them?
What the fuck does that mean?

425
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:20,208
Calm down.
He ain't never killed nobody
yet, that's all I mean.

426
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,001
Least as far
as I know he ain't.

427
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,794
Killed? What are you
talking about, killing?

428
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:25,880
I said he ain't
killed nobody yet.

429
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:29,467
If you'd listen to me,
you'd hear what I was saying.

430
00:33:56,035 --> 00:34:00,790
Well, looks like
we've run out of road
and they ain't here.

431
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:03,459
I wonder if I made a mistake.

432
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,294
It's time for you
to get out now, okay?

433
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:09,382
Get out!
What are you...
What are you doing?

434
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,887
You'll get killed
if you don't watch it.
Wait.

435
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,806
Wait!

436
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:19,475
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait!

437
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,435
No! No!

438
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,489
What did you fucking
leave him out here for?

439
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,454
Hey, mister!

440
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,749
Your wife wants you!

441
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,003
Get in the fucking car.

442
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:32,506
Hey, mister! Your wife!

443
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,344
Mister!

444
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:39,847
Shit.

445
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,332
Hey.

446
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,087
Hey!

447
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,299
Hey! Hey!

448
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:54,273
Hey.

449
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,611
May I use your phone?

450
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,962
<i>Mr. Hastings,
there's no town</i>

451
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:18,631
near here called Bailey.

452
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,341
I was afraid of that.

453
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:23,761
There's a motel
across the street.
You got money?

454
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:26,639
Ihave“.
I have credit cards.

455
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:29,141
It's still early,
Mr. Hastings.

456
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:32,520
But we'll call
if we get anything.

457
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:34,146
All right, thank you.

458
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,169
Hello?

459
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:41,505
<i>This is Lieutenant Graves.</i>

460
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:45,968
<i>They found your car
over in a dried-out arroyo
at Topping.</i>

461
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:49,138
What about my wife
and daughter?
<i>Still</i> no news.

462
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,764
<i>They weren't in the car.</i>

463
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:54,643
<i>We're turning the case
over to Lieutenant Andes.</i>

464
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:57,563
<i>He wants to know if he can
pick you up in a few minutes.</i>

465
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,231
Yeah, I'm ready now.

466
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:14,955
Morning.
Oh, glad to meet you.

467
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,499
I'm Bobby Andes.
I look into things
around here.

468
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:21,295
You found my car?
They found it in a creek bed.

469
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,468
Tell you what, we take you
back to the house
we picked you up at,

470
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:29,094
you think you could backtrack
from there?

471
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:30,679
I could try.

472
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:34,600
Okay, then, you try. Let's go.

473
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:44,193
It's my understanding
these fellas didn't have
any guns.

474
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,445
No.

475
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,699
All right.

476
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,495
So let me get this straight,
you say some fella named Lou

477
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:56,538
just drove you out
into the brush
and left you there?

478
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,708
No, he made me drive.
He made you drive.

479
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:03,337
And then when you
started to walk out,
you saw 'em coming in again.

480
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,423
Yes.
Hmm. Whose car were they in?

481
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,175
I think itwas mine.

482
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:11,095
You think?
What makes you think that?

483
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:14,181
By the look of it
and the sound of it.
It sounded like my oar.

484
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,016
Could you see 'em in the dark?

485
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,855
Not very well.
Did they say anything?

486
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:24,692
They said,
"Mister, your wife wants you."

487
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:30,406
You didn't go to 'em.
Why didn't you go to 'em?

488
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:35,828
I don't know
why I didn't go. I was...

489
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:47,589
Okay.

490
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:49,591
Can you take it from here?

491
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:54,638
Yeah, I came down the highway
and I walked for a long time,

492
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,932
'cause no one stopped for me.

493
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,603
Sergeant, back up slowly
down the shoulder.

494
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,689
Put your signal lights on.

495
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:21,331
Stop the car.
Stop the car!

496
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:23,542
I came out of that barbwire
fence right there.

497
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,086
Right by the reflector.
I remember that.

498
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:29,089
Let's get out and walk.
You said you walked out,
right?

499
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:35,679
I came up...
I came up right here,

500
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:38,849
'cause I walked along
that arroyo over there.

501
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:40,893
This is part
of the old Valdes place.

502
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,978
There's an old cattle station
down that way a bit

503
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:44,646
next to where
they burn their garbage.

504
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,607
This road leads to it.

505
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,248
Is she all right?

506
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:15,070
<i>Mom? Is that you?
Is everything all right?</i>

507
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:18,699
<i>Yeah, yeah,
it's fine. I just wanted
to hear your voice.</i>

508
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:20,409
I miss you.

509
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,330
<i>You woke me up.
I'm still in bed.
It's Sunday morning, Mom.</i>

510
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:27,207
<i>Can I call you later?</i>

511
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:31,420
Yeah. Yeah, call me later.
Go back to bed, sweetheart.

512
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:35,257
You sound weird. Are you okay?

513
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,845
I'm fine. I'm fine.

514
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,931
Go back to bed.

515
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:44,474
I love you.

516
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:45,934
Me too.

517
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:48,478
<i>I'll call you later.</i>
Okay.

518
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,133
<i>Edward? Edward?</i>

519
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,594
Hi.
Susan.

520
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:22,054
Hi. God.
How are you?

521
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,557
It's good to see
someone I know.
It's good to see you.

522
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:30,020
You look beautiful, as always.

523
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:32,814
What are you doing
in New York City?

524
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:37,236
I'm here for an interview
for a scholarship at Columbia.

525
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,072
Columbia?
I thought that you were at
the University of Texas

526
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:41,740
becoming a great writer.

527
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,826
A great writer? I mean,
I don't... I don't think so.

528
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,578
Well, lam...

529
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:50,332
But aren't you at Yale
becoming a great artist?

530
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:53,502
Graduated Yale,
but I'm at Columbia
getting my master's degree.

531
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:55,420
Oh, wow.
Yeah, art history.

532
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:56,964
That's great.
Yeah.

533
00:45:57,673 --> 00:45:59,800
Listen, do you know
anybody else in New York?

534
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:02,928
<i>Just you.
Just me.</i>

535
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,180
Okay, well, would you like
to go to dinner?

536
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:08,267
Absolutely.
Okay.

537
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:13,605
Okay, great. Just let me...
Just let me drop off
my packages at my apartment.

538
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:15,649
All right, do you want me
to grab them for you?
I can hold that.

539
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:18,068
Yeah, great. Thank you.
Oh... I miss Texas men.

540
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,820
You don't have blizzards
like this in Texas.

541
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,904
No, you don't.

542
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:38,964
You know that you
were my first crush
when we were at Hastings?

543
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:43,218
I only spent so muoh time
around your brother
just to be around you.

544
00:46:43,302 --> 00:46:45,304
Well, you were
his first crush.

545
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,307
What?
Yeah.

546
00:46:48,432 --> 00:46:50,600
Well, I had no idea
Cooper was gay.

547
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:54,187
I don't think
he knew back then,
but he was obsessed with you.

548
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:55,272
Mmm.

549
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:58,650
Wow.
Yeah.

550
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:00,819
If I hadn't caught you
staring at me so much,

551
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,572
I would have thought
you were sleeping with him.

552
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:06,616
I, actually...
I feel terrible.

553
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,869
I haven't called him
in a few years.

554
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:12,664
IfeelHke
I've been a bad friend.
I hope I didn't hurt him.

555
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,585
You're good, you know that?

556
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:18,795
No, you are. Most guys
would have freaked out

557
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:20,756
if they found out
their best friend
was in love with them.

558
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,299
You're very sweet.

559
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:27,804
You should call him.
He would like that.

560
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:30,432
My parents have basically
disowned him.

561
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,809
They're not really
talking anymore.

562
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,312
Why?
Why? Are you serious?

563
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:37,773
Well, you know
my parents, right?

564
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:41,026
They're religious,
conservative, sexist, racist,

565
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:45,322
Republican, materialistic,
narcissistic, racist.

566
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:49,284
I could keep going...
I'm just wondering
what you really think, Susan.

567
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:50,702
It's true, I know.

568
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:53,914
But they just see us
as a reflection of themselves,

569
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:57,125
so they can't accept Cooper
for who he is.

570
00:47:57,209 --> 00:47:59,211
I'm not sure
how I'm gonna fare.

571
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:02,297
Aren't you being
a little hard on them?

572
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:04,341
No.

573
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,511
They have an antiquated idea
of how I should live my life.

574
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:09,179
Especially my mother.

575
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:13,392
I understand.
I've always loved your mom.

576
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:15,268
Really?
Oh, yeah.

577
00:48:15,352 --> 00:48:17,604
She was great with me
when my dad died.

578
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:18,980
Mmm.

579
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:22,192
You both have the same kind
of sadness in your eyes.

580
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:26,655
What?
You and your mother.

581
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:29,991
That is a weird thing
to say, Edward.

582
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:32,160
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to offend you.

583
00:48:32,244 --> 00:48:35,455
I just... She just
always seemed sad to me.

584
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,583
She has sad eyes.

585
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,627
And I've thought that
since I was a little boy.

586
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,838
You have the same eyes.

587
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:48,677
They're beautiful.

588
00:48:57,352 --> 00:49:00,605
Just don't say
I'm like my mom, okay?
I don't wanna be like her.

589
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:06,236
It's funny, 'cause
I always envied your family.

590
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,322
I felt like
such an impostor at school.

591
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:12,784
You did? I thought
I was the only one
who felt like that.

592
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:14,244
You?
Yeah.

593
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,329
I was so busy
trying to be perfect and...

594
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:18,874
And you don't feel that way?
No.

595
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:21,793
That's exactly
what makes you so perfect.

596
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:26,089
You are gonna be
a great novelist,

597
00:49:26,173 --> 00:49:30,343
'cause you have created
a fictitious character
in your head about...

598
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:31,678
No.
Yes.

599
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,305
No.
Yes.

600
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:34,723
No.

601
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:37,434
I don't believe that.

602
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,563
Why'd you give up
on becoming an artist?

603
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:48,570
Because I'm too cynical
to be an artist.

604
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:50,614
I think that to be
really, really good,

605
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:55,160
you have to come
from someplace inside
that I'm just not sure I have.

606
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:56,870
You underestimate yourself.

607
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:01,124
Do you know that?

608
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,383
Edward, um,

609
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:14,930
will you come home with me?

610
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:19,309
Well, that's a bit forward.

611
00:50:19,518 --> 00:50:21,019
Yeah.

612
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:23,104
It's not what I'd expect
from a Texas debutante.

613
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,774
Well, you know
all debutantes
are sluts, so...

614
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:27,609
Hmm.

615
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:28,944
Hmm.
Hmm.

616
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:31,821
And you were
my first crush too.

617
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:34,741
I know.

618
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:03,687
We got a report
from Ozona.

619
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:08,149
Someone else harassed
on the highway last night
just like you.

620
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:16,950
If you don't mind,
we could use
your fingerprints.

621
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:18,034
Mine?

622
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:20,245
There's just a bunch of prints
on the trunk of the car.

623
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:21,663
It could help us
sort 'em out.

624
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:28,169
There's something else.

625
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:29,838
Yeah?

626
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:32,007
We have the cause of death.

627
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:40,348
Your wife had
a fractured skull.

628
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:43,518
She was probably struck
with a hammer
or a baseball bat,

629
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:46,146
probably just once
or twice, so...

630
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:51,192
Your daughter had
a much more difficult time.

631
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,361
She was suffocated.

632
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,034
She also had
a broken arm.

633
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,496
And they had
both been raped.

634
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:11,046
It turns out you were right
about that trailer, too.

635
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:12,964
H ow?

636
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:14,966
Those fellas,
they took your folks
in there,

637
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,217
just like you thought.

638
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:19,596
How do you know that?

639
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,890
We found your wife's
fingerprints on the bedpost.

640
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:25,685
Whose trailer is it?
It's clear.

641
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:29,230
Guy doesn't even live here.
He's in El Paso.

642
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:32,067
Trailer's been broken into.
Somebody's been living in it.

643
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,526
There's prints
all over the place.

644
00:52:33,777 --> 00:52:35,236
We're gonna have to check 'em
against the owner's,

645
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,155
see if we can
separate 'em out.

646
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:38,698
Right.
I'm hopeful, though.

647
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:40,742
The owner hasn't been there
since last fall, so...

648
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:43,995
Looks promising.

649
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,292
Prom...

650
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:52,837
Promising?

651
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:06,810
<i>Why didn't
you tell me this before?</i>

652
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,437
<i>You're actually gonna
leave New York,</i>

653
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:13,733
move to Austin and go
to the goddamn
University of Texas?

654
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:16,027
Why are you doing this?

655
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,530
I mean,
where is this gonna go?

656
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:19,823
What do you mean,
where is this going to go?

657
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:21,991
I'm going to marry Edward.
That's where this
is going to go.

658
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:24,119
This is a ridiculous
conversation.

659
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:26,621
You're too young
to get married.

660
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:29,207
Really?

661
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,836
Mom, last summer you tried
to convince me that I had
to marry Bass.

662
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:34,587
That is different.

663
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:36,715
Bass is your equal.

664
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:40,093
Oh, my God.
Did you just say that?
You really just said that.

665
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:42,387
That came out
of your mouth.
Thafsu.

666
00:53:44,723 --> 00:53:46,808
Why do you always think
the worst of me?

667
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,020
That is not what I meant.

668
00:53:52,105 --> 00:53:57,485
What I meant
is that you are very
strong-willed,

669
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:59,946
and Edward,
as sweet as he is,
he's too weak for you.

670
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,408
Weak is not a word
that I would use
to describe Edward.

671
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,577
Sensitive is a word
that I would use,

672
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,872
which isn't a word I would use
to describe anyone else
in this family,

673
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:10,165
except maybe Cooper.

674
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:11,833
Don't bring Cooper
into this.

675
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:13,752
Sorry.

676
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:16,671
Come on, Susan.

677
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:20,008
I know you think
that we don't care
about the same things,

678
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:21,760
but you're wrong.

679
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:25,180
In a few years,
all these bourgeois things,
as you so like to oall them,

680
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:27,599
are gonna be
very important to you,

681
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,517
and Edward's not gonna be able
to give them to you.

682
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:32,937
He has no money.

683
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:37,442
He's not driven.
He's not ambitious.

684
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:40,528
And I can promise you,
if you marry Edward,

685
00:54:40,612 --> 00:54:42,405
your father's not gonna
give them to you either.

686
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,533
No, you're right.
He's not driven

687
00:54:45,617 --> 00:54:47,452
the way that you
would like him to be.

688
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:49,871
But he is strong.

689
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:52,415
He's stronger than I am
in a lot of ways.

690
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:56,628
Just... He just has
a different kind
of strength is all.

691
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:58,630
"A different kind
of strength."

692
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,132
And what kind
of strength is that?

693
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:04,761
He has the strength
to believe in himself

694
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:07,180
and believe in me.

695
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:09,891
Susan,

696
00:55:11,226 --> 00:55:12,977
keep seeing him
if you have to,

697
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:14,270
live with him,
I don't care,

698
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:15,730
but do not marry him.

699
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:21,110
I understand
what you see in Edward.
I get it.

700
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:22,862
No.
No, wait, I do.

701
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,906
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

702
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,866
He is a romantic.

703
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:30,078
But he is also
very fragile.

704
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,955
I saw that
when his father died.

705
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:35,416
Don't...

706
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,002
Don't do this.

707
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,506
You'll regret it.

708
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,260
And you'll only hurt Edward
in the end.

709
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:50,557
The things you love
about him now are
the things you'll hate

710
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,641
in a few years.

711
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:55,603
You may not realize it,

712
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:59,899
but you and I
are a lot more alike
than you think.

713
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:06,948
No. You're wrong.
You and I are nothing alike.

714
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:09,033
Really?

715
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,662
Just wait.

716
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:16,624
We all eventually
turn into our mothers.

717
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:01,002
<i>Yeah?</i>
Tony Hastings?

718
00:57:03,338 --> 00:57:04,672
Yes. Who is this?

719
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:08,760
Roberto Andes.
I've sent you an email.
You get it?

720
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:09,928
Yes.

721
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:11,429
Well, you recognize the guy?

722
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:14,140
<i>No.
Shit.</i>

723
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,851
God damn it.
You sure?

724
00:57:16,935 --> 00:57:19,646
Yeah. The whole thing's
just a blur.

725
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:21,606
<i>Well, his prints
are all over your car.</i>

726
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:24,192
They found 'em
at the trailer too.
His name's Steve Adams.

727
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,945
<i>He's got a record
in California.
A stolen car,</i>

728
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:29,364
acquittal on a rape charge.
I put out an APB on him.

729
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:31,616
<i>He's the only lead
we got, Tony,</i>

730
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:33,952
and I sure as hell don't have
any other witnesses.

731
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,497
<i>You sure
you don't recognize him?</i>

732
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:40,416
No.

733
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,960
Fuck. What's wrong
with you, man?

734
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:43,670
<i>Don't you wanna put
these guys</i> away?

735
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:45,171
Yeah, of course I do.

736
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:48,049
The whole thing
is just some...

737
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,386
Just a blank.

738
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:12,532
I know itwas him.

739
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:15,660
<i>Well, that may be,
but nobody's seen him
around here lately.</i>

740
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:16,995
<i>Listen, I gotta be
honest with you.</i>

741
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:18,871
<i>Right now
it's not looking good.</i>

742
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:22,125
<i>Sometimes these cases
go months or even years
without a break.</i>

743
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:24,502
<i>You need to prepare
yourself for that.</i>

744
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:08,713
<i>Why are you
so driven to write?</i>

745
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:12,592
<i>I guess it's a way
of keeping things alive.</i>

746
00:59:15,303 --> 00:59:18,306
<i>You know, saving things
that will eventually die.</i>

747
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:22,143
<i>And if I write
it down, then,</i>

748
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:24,771
<i>it'll last forever.</i>

749
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:55,927
Afternoon.
Hey, there.

750
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,387
Sorry I'm late.
There was traffic:
on the interstate.

751
00:59:58,471 --> 00:59:59,597
That's all right.

752
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:01,682
You look different.

753
01:00:01,891 --> 01:00:02,975
No beard.

754
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:06,896
You look...
You look different too.

755
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:11,692
Yeah. So I'll tell you
what we got.

756
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:13,152
We had an attempted hold-up

757
01:00:13,236 --> 01:00:16,531
at the supermarket
in the mall last night
just before closing.

758
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:18,116
We caught one
of the guys,

759
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:20,326
one got killed
and one got away.

760
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:22,912
What do you,
what do you want me to do?

761
01:00:24,372 --> 01:00:26,249
See if you recognize
the guy we caught.

762
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:29,168
You can look
at the dead one too,

763
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:31,462
although I don't really
think it's necessary.

764
01:00:31,546 --> 01:00:33,214
We know who he is.

765
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:34,423
Who?

766
01:00:35,508 --> 01:00:36,717
Steve Adams.

767
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:41,347
The one you called Turk
that I emailed you
about last year?

768
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:48,771
Come on in.

769
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:57,488
Are you afraid to look
this fella in the eye?
Let him see you?

770
01:00:57,572 --> 01:00:58,573
No.

771
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:01,534
That's good.
I think it will
help him talk.

772
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:17,717
That's him,
that guy on the left.

773
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,218
On the far left.
That's him.

774
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:24,307
No,
no,no,no,no,
no. Hold up, son.

775
01:01:25,016 --> 01:01:26,559
You ain't that lucky.
Get over here.

776
01:01:31,022 --> 01:01:32,273
This fella?
Yes.

777
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:35,318
I see. Right.
I don't think
he understands.

778
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:37,904
Lou. Lou. Hey, you.

779
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:41,407
Your name Lou?
You know my name.
I told you.

780
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:42,992
Yeah?
Yeah. What's going on?

781
01:01:46,204 --> 01:01:49,207
Well, I guess I want you
to tell me if you've ever
seen this man before.

782
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:52,376
Think carefully.
You ever seen him?

783
01:01:55,004 --> 01:01:56,422
No, I don't know him.

784
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:57,715
Hmm?
Who is he?

785
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:00,635
Why don't you tell him, Tony?
Tell him who he is.

786
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:02,595
Last summer, this man,
Lou, and his friends,

787
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:04,305
they forced us off the road
on the interstate

788
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:07,308
and two of them
forced their way into my car
with my wife and my daughter.

789
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:10,728
And then this man...
This man? This man Lou?

790
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,230
Yes. Lou, he made me
drive his car,

791
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:15,107
he took me to the middle
of the desert
and he left me there.

792
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:18,361
And later my wife
and daughter
were found dead

793
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:20,738
near the same place.

794
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:26,577
Well, that ain't right.

795
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:39,090
What you got to say
about this man's
wife and daughter?

796
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:40,258
I don't know
nothing about that.

797
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:41,676
I've never seen him
before in my life.

798
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,387
What you gonna tell me
about Ray and Turk?

799
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:46,514
Who?
Who?

800
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:51,936
What, are you an owl?
You an owl, Lou?

801
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:54,855
I never heard of 'em.
You never heard of 'em?

802
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,691
No, sir.

803
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:02,488
Hmm.

804
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:04,198
Mmm-hmm.

805
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:10,746
All right.

806
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,210
Officer.

807
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:18,045
Put him up.

808
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:24,468
Are you sure
this is the man?
Absolutely, yes.

809
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,513
You'll swear in a court of law
under penalty of perjury?

810
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:28,597
Yes.

811
01:03:34,437 --> 01:03:35,521
Good.

812
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,234
Well, we got Lou.

813
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:42,945
I'm gonna charge him
with murder.

814
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:44,572
What, do you have
enough evidence?

815
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:47,658
Oh, you bet,
between you and the prints
in the car and the trailer.

816
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:49,785
What, he went back
to the trailer
after he left me?

817
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:53,205
Yeah, looks like it.
Uh, he probably just went back
to tell 'em where you were.

818
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:55,708
That's why they came back
with the bodies.

819
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,835
They were,
they were gonna kill you.

820
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:00,379
You see? Yeah.

821
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,674
I bet your friend Ray's
the third fella
in the hold-up.

822
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:08,429
What HOW?
Well, you're gonna
wait for trial.

823
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:13,434
And I'm gonna go find Ray.

824
01:04:20,733 --> 01:04:23,611
Don't forget you have
a board meeting
at the museum at 3:00.

825
01:04:25,446 --> 01:04:26,614
I'm sorry. What was that?

826
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:33,371
You didn't sleep again,
did you?

827
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,960
You know me.
I never sleep.

828
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:44,757
My ex-husband
used to call me
a nocturnal animal.

829
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,133
What ex-husband?

830
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:49,512
I didn't know
you had an ex-husband.
Since when?

831
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:51,639
A couple of years
in graduate school.

832
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:55,851
It's weird,
I've been thinking
about him a lot lately,

833
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:58,270
and then recently
he sent me this book
that he's written

834
01:04:58,354 --> 01:04:59,355
and it's

835
01:05:00,815 --> 01:05:02,149
violent and it's sad,

836
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:05,611
and he entitled it
Nocturnal Animals
and he dedicated it to me.

837
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:08,489
Did you love him?

838
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:09,907
Yeah, I loved him.

839
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:15,204
He was a writer and, uh,
I didn't have faith in him.

840
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:18,707
I panicked
and I did something
horrible to him.

841
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,960
Something unforgivable,
really.

842
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:24,130
You left him?
I left him.

843
01:05:25,673 --> 01:05:28,217
I left him in a brutal way,

844
01:05:29,427 --> 01:05:31,887
for the handsome
and dashing Hutton.

845
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:34,432
Who is very handsome
and dashing.
...and dashing. Yes.

846
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,269
Do you ever feel like
your life has turned
into something

847
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:39,520
you never intended?

848
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:48,070
No.

849
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:50,865
Of course not.
You just started
living your life.

850
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:55,536
You really didn't get
any sleep, did you?

851
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:00,207
No.

852
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,383
Where did
this painting come from?

853
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:53,552
What do you mean,
where did it come from?

854
01:06:53,636 --> 01:06:54,803
You bought it for us,
remember?

855
01:06:55,346 --> 01:06:57,181
It was part of the series
like eight years ago.

856
01:06:57,598 --> 01:06:59,308
It's great, isn't it?
Yeah.

857
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:01,560
What is that?

858
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:03,979
Oh, my God,
it's so cool.

859
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:07,149
It's this app
that lets me watch Willow
while she's in her crib.

860
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:10,277
Really? Do you not
trust your nanny?

861
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:12,738
No,no,ldo.
I just hate her, so...

862
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:13,864
And I would like
to be more involved

863
01:07:13,948 --> 01:07:15,324
with Willow
throughout the day, so...

864
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:18,452
Look. There she is.

865
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,997
And the sound's incredible.
You can actually hear
her breathing.

866
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:23,415
And I can talk to her
if I want to.

867
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:29,630
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm...

868
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:32,132
Are you okay?
Yeah.

869
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:33,342
Yeah, I just...

870
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:36,136
I thought I saw someone.

871
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:40,224
Well, you did see someone.

872
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:41,976
That's Willow
and she's in her crib.

873
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:43,269
She's sleeping.

874
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:46,522
I'm really sorry
aboutyourphone.
I can, um...

875
01:07:47,314 --> 01:07:48,983
It's fine. A new one comes out
next week anyway, so...

876
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:50,067
Thanks.

877
01:07:50,818 --> 01:07:52,152
Shall we?

878
01:07:53,696 --> 01:07:54,697
They're all
waiting for us.

879
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:02,121
We're under
no contractual obligations.
Which is good.

880
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,873
I know we all have different,
you know, opinions about this,

881
01:08:04,957 --> 01:08:06,542
but as far as I'm concerned...

882
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,429
Anyways,
I think we should
out her loose.

883
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:20,431
She isn't who she sold herself
to be when we hired her.

884
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:22,641
I disagree.
I think we should keep her
for now.

885
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:25,436
Why is that?
Because she's great
and we all like her.

886
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:28,105
She just needs our support
and a little bit of time,
that's all.

887
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:30,608
- But it's not working.
- We need to fire her.

888
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:32,818
There's an awesome candidate
that we could steal
from the Hammer

889
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:34,612
if we move fast.

890
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:38,115
I agree with Linda.
We hired her.
We should support her.

891
01:08:38,741 --> 01:08:39,742
New doctor?

892
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:44,246
No. New haircut.

893
01:08:45,873 --> 01:08:48,000
But, Susan, you were the one
who brought it up last meeting

894
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,460
that you were
looking for a change.

895
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:52,171
I know, but now I think
we should keep her.

896
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,131
Sometimes it's...

897
01:08:57,176 --> 01:08:59,470
Sometimes maybe
it's not such a good idea

898
01:08:59,553 --> 01:09:01,096
to change things
quite so much.

899
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:20,884
I don't get it.
What are we doing here?

900
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:22,428
Shit.

901
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:26,515
Are you okay?

902
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:31,478
Yeah. I'm fine.
Follow me.

903
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:44,533
That's Ray Marcus.

904
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:46,452
He's been named
as a frequent companion

905
01:10:46,535 --> 01:10:48,162
of Lou Bates and Steve Adams.

906
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:51,081
Part-time electrician,
part-time plumber,

907
01:10:51,165 --> 01:10:53,667
hence the clever
toilet facilities.

908
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:55,502
He's not a bad match
to your description

909
01:10:55,586 --> 01:10:56,920
and the fella at the hold-up.

910
01:10:57,838 --> 01:10:59,923
No fingerprints,
but we knew that before.

911
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:02,217
I wonder why there aren't
any fingerprints.

912
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:04,052
Well, his hands
were probably on your wife.

913
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,516
His record's clean,
except for a rape charge
that got dropped.

914
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:12,936
I heard from this barman
at this place, Line Camp Bar,

915
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,105
that Ray lives here
with a girl named Leila

916
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:16,440
but he also keeps another spot

917
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:18,192
to take girls
she don't know about,

918
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:20,861
probably your murder trailer
before it got notorious.

919
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:25,407
Does he look like
he could be the guy?

920
01:11:25,532 --> 01:11:27,326
Yes, that's him.

921
01:11:27,409 --> 01:11:28,410
Good.

922
01:11:29,578 --> 01:11:30,871
Let's talk to him.

923
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:46,595
Hey, Ray.
What the fuck?

924
01:11:47,596 --> 01:11:48,680
Who the hell are you?

925
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:50,849
Get off my property, man.

926
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:54,728
Shit, I'll call you back.

927
01:11:54,812 --> 01:11:56,104
I wanna ask you
some questions.

928
01:11:56,563 --> 01:11:57,731
Fuck you.

929
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:00,025
I'm occupied at the moment.

930
01:12:02,277 --> 01:12:04,363
What's that?
Just a few
questions, that's all.

931
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:08,325
We need you to come with us.
What for?
I ain't done nothin'.

932
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:10,953
I ain't saying you did.
Well, ask me here.

933
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:13,080
No, we need you
to take a little drive
with us.

934
01:12:13,622 --> 01:12:15,833
Come on, finish up
what you're doing
and let's go.

935
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:16,917
Do you mind turning round?

936
01:12:20,587 --> 01:12:22,422
Believe me,
I wish I could, but...

937
01:12:26,093 --> 01:12:27,261
Fucking unbelievable.

938
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:36,311
All right,
that's enough. Come on.

939
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:38,105
Come on, now.

940
01:12:39,565 --> 01:12:41,692
All right, come on.
Get dressed. Come on.

941
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:52,244
- You questioning me?
- Yeah.

942
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:55,330
Yeah, that's what
we're doing, ain't it?
You ain't read rne my rights.

943
01:13:01,837 --> 01:13:04,339
You know your rights, Ray.
You're supposed
to read 'em to me.

944
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,218
I read you your rights,
didn't I, Tony?

945
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,221
Uh-huh.

946
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:12,973
I read you your rights.

947
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:15,517
This ain't legal, man.
I'm supposed to have
a lawyer or something.

948
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,060
Calm down, sunshine.

949
01:13:17,144 --> 01:13:19,813
This is just
informal questioning,
that's all.

950
01:13:20,022 --> 01:13:22,733
You're helping rne out.
I ain't charged you
with nothing yet.

951
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:25,611
Now, if you want a lawyer,
I can take you down
to the station

952
01:13:25,694 --> 01:13:26,820
and charge you with something.

953
01:13:26,904 --> 01:13:29,448
Oh, come on, man, listen,
you ain't gotta take me in.

954
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:31,199
I'm answering
the questions, ain't I?
Come on.

955
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:34,036
Give me some questions.
I'll answer your questions.

956
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:36,705
I don't know any more
about this hold-up
than I did before I met you.

957
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:37,748
I tell you what,

958
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:38,957
I'm gonna ask you
a different question.

959
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:42,002
You recognize this car?
What car?

960
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:44,338
This one. The one
we're driving around in.

961
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:46,340
Why should I recognize
this fucking car?

962
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:47,549
It ain't familiar to you?

963
01:13:47,633 --> 01:13:49,343
It don't remind you
of nothing,
take you back?

964
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:51,637
Why should it?
You don't remember driving it?

965
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,514
I think I'd know.
Yeah. How about the driver?

966
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:56,141
What?
This fella?

967
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:59,186
This fella sitting behind
the steering wheel.
My friend Tony?

968
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:00,354
You remember him?

969
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:06,360
I can't see him.
Make him turn around.

970
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:08,528
Stop the car, Tony.

971
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:15,327
Turn around and look
at this piece of shit.

972
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:20,707
Who is this guy?
You don't remember him?

973
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:25,003
Can't say I do.
You remember him, Tony?

974
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:27,673
Yes.
Well, refresh his memory.

975
01:14:27,756 --> 01:14:29,132
Last summer on the interstate.

976
01:14:29,216 --> 01:14:31,009
Tell him what you
remember he did.

977
01:14:31,385 --> 01:14:32,719
You killed my wife
and my daughter.

978
01:14:33,387 --> 01:14:34,972
That's crazy.
I never killed nobody.

979
01:14:35,806 --> 01:14:37,933
ANDESI
Tell him the whole thing.
Mmm-mmm.

980
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:40,686
You and your buddies
on the interstate,
you foroed us off the road.

981
01:14:40,769 --> 01:14:42,771
- Tell him who his buddies are.
- Lou and Turk.

982
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:43,814
You remember that, Ray?

983
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:45,857
You remember horsing around
on the interstate
with your buddies,

984
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:47,401
playing chicken
with the other cars?

985
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:49,778
You're crazy. That's crazy.

986
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:52,864
You made us stop
and we had a flat tire
and Lou and Turk fixed it.

987
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:55,075
Then you and Turk
got in my car
with my wife and my daughter

988
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:57,786
and you forced me
in your oar with Lou.
ANDESI What then, Tony?

989
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,414
Lou took me out into the brush
and kicked me out.

990
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,417
And you came back in my car

991
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,669
and you called out for me,
trying to lure me
into your trap.

992
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:07,629
You came back
where Lou had left me

993
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:10,173
Oh, is that why
you went back there, Ray?

994
01:15:17,973 --> 01:15:20,600
You're fucking crazy!
Tell him what
we found there, Tony.

995
01:15:21,852 --> 01:15:24,521
TCDNYI YOU tell him.
Do I have to?
Don't you know, Ray?

996
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:29,818
Y'all are crazy. It's crazy.

997
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:32,279
The bodies
of my wife and child

998
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:37,159
which you took
back there and dumped.

999
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:42,122
You're the one. I know you.

1000
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:44,082
What do you say, Ray?

1001
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:47,335
You're crazy.
You're making
a big mistake.

1002
01:15:47,419 --> 01:15:49,504
Mmm.
I don't think so.

1003
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:53,800
I don't think so, Ray.
Put your hands out
in front of you.

1004
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:55,802
You got no right.
Got no right?

1005
01:15:56,261 --> 01:15:58,847
Rights, rights, rights.
You and your goddamn rights.

1006
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:00,474
Speaking of rights,
I just wanna let you know

1007
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:02,601
I'm recording
this entire conversation.

1008
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:05,228
There. You clear?

1009
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:07,189
Mmm-hmm.
All right, let's go, Tony.

1010
01:16:10,776 --> 01:16:12,903
Now, we're going
to a place you might remember,

1011
01:16:12,986 --> 01:16:15,697
and you can help yourself out
by telling me about it.

1012
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:17,574
But if you don't remember,

1013
01:16:17,657 --> 01:16:20,077
Tony does, all right?

1014
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:22,204
Hey, I'm sorry
you lost your folks, man.

1015
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:25,832
It's a shame.
But I didn't have
nothin' to do with it.

1016
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:47,395
What's this place?
You know this place.

1017
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:49,773
Honest to God, I don't.
You wanna get out, Tony?

1018
01:16:49,856 --> 01:16:51,608
Shall we have
a look inside, Ray?
What for?

1019
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:53,026
Come on,
let's take a look.

1020
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,751
All right,
all right.

1021
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:16,925
Oh, you raped them
on the bed, I suppose.

1022
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:18,927
I never raped nobody.
Stop fucking around, Ray.

1023
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,096
We seen your record.
We know about
that girl in Lubbock.

1024
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:23,807
The charges were dropped.
I never raped nobody.

1025
01:17:24,057 --> 01:17:25,058
I wanna know, Ray.

1026
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:29,146
I wanna know the exact story,
what you did to them.

1027
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:34,109
You'll have to ask
somebody else.
I wanna know what they said.

1028
01:17:37,112 --> 01:17:38,613
I wanna know what my wife said

1029
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:40,282
and I wanna know
what my daughter said.

1030
01:17:50,876 --> 01:17:52,294
I wanna know
how you killed them.

1031
01:17:53,545 --> 01:17:55,881
And I wanna know if they knew
it was happening to them.

1032
01:17:55,964 --> 01:17:57,465
I wanna know what they felt!

1033
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:02,888
I wanna know if they hurt.

1034
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:07,934
Answer me!

1035
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:10,979
Answer me!

1036
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:16,443
Answer me,
you fucking bastard!

1037
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:35,545
Is it better?

1038
01:18:37,047 --> 01:18:39,132
You're gonna take this
the wrong way, but, um,

1039
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:42,719
I think that you
should write about something
other than yourself.

1040
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,267
Nobody writes about anything
but themselves.

1041
01:18:49,351 --> 01:18:51,144
I just, my mind started
to wander when
I was reading it,

1042
01:18:51,269 --> 01:18:53,313
and that's not good, right?

1043
01:18:53,647 --> 01:18:54,648
I don't know what to do.
Maybe, you know,

1044
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,107
maybe I don't have
a book in me.

1045
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:59,027
Maybe give yourself
some space.
Just do something else.

1046
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,070
Can you not do that?
What?

1047
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:01,988
Becauseitu
That makes me feel like
you don't believe in me.

1048
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:05,075
Edward,
that's not what I said.
No, you didn't say that.

1049
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:06,243
But you're saying it
with your face

1050
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:07,494
and you're saying it
when you sigh.

1051
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:10,413
Whatever, you're saying it
when you say you want me
to go baok to sohool.

1052
01:19:10,497 --> 01:19:12,040
Well, yeah, I do want you
to go back to school.

1053
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:13,083
I don't see
what's wrong with that.

1054
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:14,626
I mean,
I'm just being a realist.

1055
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:17,587
I mean, you're gonna
work at a book store
and just write a novel,

1056
01:19:17,671 --> 01:19:19,965
like that's what
you wanna do
with your life?

1057
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:26,096
I mean,
that's really romantic, but,
like, what? This is it?

1058
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:28,306
This is it? This is what...
You sound like your mother.

1059
01:19:31,226 --> 01:19:34,521
Well, you always said
that I reminded you
so much of her, so...

1060
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,440
You know, this is exactly why
I don't wanna read your work

1061
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:39,317
because you always get
so fucking defensive.

1062
01:19:39,401 --> 01:19:40,819
Yeah, of course I'm defensive!

1063
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:44,239
Do you know what it feels like
to put yourself out
on the line creatively

1064
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:47,701
and then have someone
you love tell you that
they don't understand it?

1065
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,619
No, I don't,
because I'm not creative...

1066
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:51,121
That's because
you choose not to be.

1067
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:57,168
I don't wanna fight.
I'm tired and I'm edgy.

1068
01:19:57,252 --> 01:20:00,672
I've been writing all night.
I just wanted you to like it,
all right?

1069
01:20:09,097 --> 01:20:10,098
Thanks.

1070
01:20:21,026 --> 01:20:22,986
<i>I got some news
you're not gonna like.</i>

1071
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,947
They're letting Ray Marcus go.

1072
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:27,824
<i>What? What do you mean,
they're letting him go?</i>

1073
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:31,286
The D.A. says we don't have
enough hard evidence,

1074
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:32,954
what we have
is circumstantial.

1075
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:35,415
He needs corroboration.

1076
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:40,420
I'm real sorry, Tony.

1077
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:43,465
It's a goddamn shame.

1078
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:47,010
At least you got to lay
a good belt on him.

1079
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:50,013
<i>No, that's not enough.
What else can we do?</i>

1080
01:20:51,765 --> 01:20:53,016
I can think of something.

1081
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:55,810
You'd better get
here quick, though.

1082
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:57,479
He ain't gonna
stick around for long.

1083
01:20:58,438 --> 01:20:59,898
<i>Okay, all right,
I'm leaving now.</i>

1084
01:21:03,777 --> 01:21:04,778
What?

1085
01:21:06,196 --> 01:21:09,741
I told you,
I got lung cancer.
It's metastasized.

1086
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:13,995
But you smoke all the time.
Yeah, well,
that's how it works.

1087
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:17,207
What's the point
in quitting now?
I'll be dead in a year.

1088
01:21:17,374 --> 01:21:19,209
It's this fella named Jenks.

1089
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:21,211
He's the lawyer
the court appointed for Ray.

1090
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:23,129
He's a little smartass
from Dallas.

1091
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:26,716
He and the D.A. made a deal
and Ray got off. Politics.

1092
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,301
When did you tell me
you were sick?

1093
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:30,804
See, they're trying
to force me out.

1094
01:21:31,096 --> 01:21:33,515
They already got another fella
lined up for the job.

1095
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:34,724
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1096
01:21:34,808 --> 01:21:36,393
They'd drop a murder case
to do that?

1097
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:40,188
Oh, yeah.
Give 'em the reason,
ammunition.

1098
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:44,901
They said my case
wasn't well-prepared,
was a sloppyjob, slapdash,

1099
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:47,654
no evidence and evidence
improperly gathered,

1100
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:49,322
won't stand up in court.

1101
01:21:51,324 --> 01:21:54,828
The D.A.'s too much
of a chickenshit
to take a case he might lose.

1102
01:21:58,748 --> 01:21:59,999
They're not dropping Lou.

1103
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:05,255
Well, it's no fucking good
if we don't get Ray.

1104
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,091
Good.

1105
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:10,552
That's what I was
hoping you'd say.

1106
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:16,224
They want me to retire
and enjoy the benefits
of my cancer somewhere else.

1107
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,685
Fuckthat
Y%n1neverkMdrne
about the cancer.

1108
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:20,645
The problem with Ray
is his alibi.

1109
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:21,980
You have a family?

1110
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,315
Ray claims he was with
that little...
Bobby.Bobby.

1111
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:26,025
What?

1112
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:29,237
Do you have anyone
in your life?

1113
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:38,204
No. No wife or...

1114
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,084
I have a daughter in Corpus.

1115
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:48,631
Has she been a help?

1116
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:55,013
She doesn't know.
What can she do about it?

1117
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:02,228
Anyway, Ray claims

1118
01:23:02,312 --> 01:23:05,023
he was with that little girl,
Leila whatever her name is

1119
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:06,816
and she backs him up.

1120
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,151
Her aunt backs her up.

1121
01:23:08,902 --> 01:23:09,903
What are we gonna do?

1122
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:16,618
It's a question
of how serious you are
about seeing justice done.

1123
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:20,205
You get me?

1124
01:23:26,669 --> 01:23:29,130
I can't eat.
Gonna throw up.

1125
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:31,174
How are you gonna get
anything done
if you can't eat?

1126
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:34,719
Sometimes I can,
sometimes I can't.
This place is terrible.

1127
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:35,970
I need you to eat something.

1128
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,817
So let me ask you
a personal question.

1129
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:53,279
Off the record,
between you and me.

1130
01:23:54,489 --> 01:23:56,574
What do you want me to do
with Ray Marcus?

1131
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:58,076
Well, what can you do
with him?

1132
01:23:58,493 --> 01:24:01,371
Anything you goddamn like.

1133
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:09,337
But I thought
you said that...

1134
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,463
Listen,

1135
01:24:12,507 --> 01:24:14,259
I got nothin' to lose.

1136
01:24:14,342 --> 01:24:17,762
I'm not gonna let
this asshole D.A.
fuck up my last case.

1137
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:20,557
I'm also not gonna stand by
and watch a murderer go free.

1138
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:24,602
I've seen too many sick fucks
like Ray Marcus get off
over the years.

1139
01:24:25,645 --> 01:24:28,690
Now, are you willing
to go outside
of strict procedure on this?

1140
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:29,774
Yes.

1141
01:24:30,108 --> 01:24:31,484
You sure?
Yes.

1142
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:39,909
Andes here.

1143
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,205
You're kidding?
All right, thanks.

1144
01:24:48,293 --> 01:24:50,211
Rayjust showed up
at Line Camp.

1145
01:24:51,504 --> 01:24:53,756
I'm gonna let
that little idiot get nice
and liquored up

1146
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,676
and then I'm gonna go grab
his ass and take him
to my camp.

1147
01:24:57,927 --> 01:24:59,178
And I want you
to come with me.

1148
01:24:59,429 --> 01:25:01,848
We're gonna keep him for
a little while,
work him over a bit,

1149
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:04,434
get a little rough,
make him suffer.

1150
01:25:05,768 --> 01:25:07,353
And then we'll see
what he does.

1151
01:25:09,355 --> 01:25:10,523
Would you like that?

1152
01:25:15,987 --> 01:25:19,032
<i>You have to realize
that this is not working.</i>

1153
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:21,409
We are not working.
We are too different.

1154
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:23,953
We are not right
for each other.
Susan, stop.

1155
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:25,788
We're not right
for each other?

1156
01:25:25,872 --> 01:25:27,165
No, we're not right
for each other.

1157
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:30,084
We are perfect for each other.
No, we're not perfect
for each other, Edward.

1158
01:25:31,002 --> 01:25:32,420
We may be perfect
for each other

1159
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:34,047
if we didn't live
in the real world,

1160
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:37,216
but I live in the real world
and I need a life
that is more structured.

1161
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,926
Hey.
I need a future
that is more structured.

1162
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:41,804
I want to be the person
that you want me to be,
but I just can't.

1163
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:44,223
You are. You are.
I can't be that.

1164
01:25:44,307 --> 01:25:45,558
Hey, no, stop.

1165
01:25:45,892 --> 01:25:49,687
I, I really wanted
to be this person
that you thought I was,

1166
01:25:50,313 --> 01:25:51,939
I really did,
but I'm just
not that person.

1167
01:25:52,065 --> 01:25:53,941
I'm, I'm cynical,
I'm pragmatic.
No, look...

1168
01:25:54,025 --> 01:25:56,319
No, lam. I'm a realist.
You're afraid. You're afraid.

1169
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:57,403
No, I'm not afraid.

1170
01:25:57,445 --> 01:25:59,364
We've been through this
so many times before.
I'm not scared.

1171
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:01,407
I'm not scared.
I'm unhappy.
All right.

1172
01:26:05,578 --> 01:26:07,288
I'm just really,
really unhappy.

1173
01:26:13,753 --> 01:26:15,088
You're so...

1174
01:26:16,255 --> 01:26:18,591
You really are so wonderful
and you're just so

1175
01:26:20,051 --> 01:26:21,969
sensitive and
romantic and...

1176
01:26:22,095 --> 01:26:25,056
Weak. That's right, yeah.
What? I did not say
you were weak.

1177
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:27,642
You've said it
so many times before.
I did not call you weak.

1178
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:29,519
You've said it before,
so why don't you say it again?

1179
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:31,771
Weak.
I did not say
you were weak.

1180
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:34,065
I did not say
you were weak.
Do you love me?

1181
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:36,526
That's not the point.
No, that is the point.

1182
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:38,069
No, it is not the point.
That is the point!

1183
01:26:38,152 --> 01:26:39,362
That is not the point.
You didn't answer me.

1184
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,909
Yes, I love you.
Well, when you love someone,

1185
01:26:46,119 --> 01:26:47,120
you work it out.

1186
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:49,539
You don't just throw it away.

1187
01:26:50,123 --> 01:26:51,374
You have to be
careful with it.

1188
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:52,625
You might never get it again.

1189
01:26:54,377 --> 01:26:56,170
I can't do this with you
anymore, Edward.

1190
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:59,132
I just can't keep doing this.

1191
01:27:00,425 --> 01:27:01,426
Susan“.

1192
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:04,053
You can't just
walk away from things

1193
01:27:04,137 --> 01:27:05,346
<i>all the time.</i>

1194
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:18,192
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, shit. Come on.

1195
01:27:18,276 --> 01:27:21,195
I told you,
I don't know nothin'
about this situation.

1196
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:22,655
Why don't you go ask
in there, man?

1197
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:24,282
I'll see you
in a minute, okay?

1198
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:26,534
Okay, sweetie?

1199
01:27:39,172 --> 01:27:40,631
We're going to my camp.

1200
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:45,178
It's in White Creek
near the trailer
where they took your folks.

1201
01:27:46,012 --> 01:27:47,096
You follow.

1202
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:03,863
Sit up.

1203
01:28:08,201 --> 01:28:11,245
Oh, Jesus.
I'm gonna be sick.
Tony, get over here, quick.

1204
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:13,247
Here, you use this, right?

1205
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:15,458
You shoot him
if he gets out of line.

1206
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:25,051
Boo.

1207
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:27,845
Hey, man, this ain't legal.
If this were legal,

1208
01:28:27,929 --> 01:28:30,181
you'd have taken me
to the station,
not this fucking place.

1209
01:28:31,015 --> 01:28:32,809
It's all the legal
we need, boy.

1210
01:28:36,604 --> 01:28:38,940
There ain't
no new evidence.
Oh, yeah?

1211
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:41,901
Why don't you take me in
if you got new evidence? Huh?

1212
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:45,404
I like it better here.
It's more relaxed.

1213
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:49,450
It seems to me
you tried
this trick already.

1214
01:28:49,826 --> 01:28:51,285
If you think this guy's
gonna break me down,

1215
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,204
you already seen
that don't work.
Oh, yeah,

1216
01:28:54,247 --> 01:28:55,623
but what would you say
if I told you

1217
01:28:55,706 --> 01:28:57,834
your friend Lou Bates
implicated you

1218
01:28:57,917 --> 01:28:59,710
in the Hastings murders?

1219
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,713
If Lou had done that,
you would have taken me in.

1220
01:29:02,797 --> 01:29:05,007
Well, don't worry,
we'll get you to the station.

1221
01:29:05,716 --> 01:29:07,718
Don't worry. Oh, who's this?

1222
01:29:10,096 --> 01:29:12,431
Well, looky here.
You son of a bitch.

1223
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:14,767
All right.

1224
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,104
Okay, come on, boy.
Get over there.

1225
01:29:18,938 --> 01:29:21,107
Lou, what'd you
fucking tell this guy?
I didn't tell him nothin'.

1226
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,776
No, he said you told him
I was the one who killed
this guy's wife and kid.

1227
01:29:23,943 --> 01:29:25,570
What? That's what
he told me about you.

1228
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:28,573
You're supposed
to be the lawman.
What kind of bullshit is this?

1229
01:29:28,656 --> 01:29:29,657
Fuck off

1230
01:29:30,449 --> 01:29:31,492
both of you.

1231
01:29:31,993 --> 01:29:35,246
Now, do you two
have any last words
you wanna say to eaoh other?

1232
01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:40,167
I think what we
should do, Tony,

1233
01:29:40,251 --> 01:29:42,003
is we should just kill
them right now.

1234
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,797
It's gonna be rough
for 'em out there,

1235
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,550
not knowing
how it's gonna come.

1236
01:29:48,593 --> 01:29:51,846
Maybe Ray'll get killed
for resisting arrest, huh?

1237
01:29:57,977 --> 01:29:59,687
Coming home late at night,

1238
01:30:01,522 --> 01:30:03,274
he might get shot
by a burglar.

1239
01:30:08,362 --> 01:30:10,072
Oh, you feeling
uncomfortable, boy?

1240
01:30:10,823 --> 01:30:13,409
Ooh. Come on up here.

1241
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:16,579
Yeah, you look
like you're feeling
uncomfortable.

1242
01:30:17,538 --> 01:30:18,664
What?
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1243
01:30:18,748 --> 01:30:19,832
What's that?

1244
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,752
I ain't gonna kill you, son.

1245
01:30:22,835 --> 01:30:24,128
I'm a policeman.

1246
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:27,089
What, you gonna cry?

1247
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:28,674
Are you gonna cry?

1248
01:30:30,968 --> 01:30:35,264
Aw, okay. Well, since you're
feeling so uncomfortable...

1249
01:30:35,348 --> 01:30:36,515
Tony, get over here.

1250
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:38,434
Take this.

1251
01:30:39,477 --> 01:30:41,020
Go on, right here, okay?
Please don't.

1252
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:43,272
Fuck.
Right here, right here.

1253
01:30:43,356 --> 01:30:44,774
Right here, okay?

1254
01:30:45,483 --> 01:30:46,567
- Right.
- Hey, hey.

1255
01:30:46,651 --> 01:30:48,611
What about me?
I might be feeling
uncomfortable too.

1256
01:30:49,195 --> 01:30:50,196
Oh, yeah?

1257
01:30:51,155 --> 01:30:52,698
Okay, come on up.

1258
01:30:55,743 --> 01:30:58,079
There you go. Free as a bird.

1259
01:30:58,829 --> 01:31:00,539
Okay? How about it?

1260
01:31:01,165 --> 01:31:03,918
What do you say, Tony?
Now, what shall we do
with these two?

1261
01:31:06,212 --> 01:31:07,380
What you gonna do?

1262
01:31:08,381 --> 01:31:09,799
What you gonna do, son?

1263
01:31:11,133 --> 01:31:12,134
Come on.

1264
01:31:13,552 --> 01:31:14,595
Come on.

1265
01:31:19,225 --> 01:31:20,226
Let's go...

1266
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:21,477
He's got a gun.

1267
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:24,689
Bobby?
Shoot 'em, Tony.
Shoot 'em.

1268
01:31:24,772 --> 01:31:26,691
Come back here,
you little fuckers!

1269
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,172
No. No.

1270
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:52,591
No, please.

1271
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:25,082
Are you okay?

1272
01:32:27,543 --> 01:32:29,211
I'm gonna live to regret this.

1273
01:32:32,339 --> 01:32:33,674
I regret it now.

1274
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:39,138
You know, I'm Catholic.
I don't even believe
in abortions.

1275
01:32:41,307 --> 01:32:42,475
I'm so sorry.

1276
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,561
I feel so useless.

1277
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,983
You're anything but useless.
You always know exactly
what to do.

1278
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:53,861
Thank you.

1279
01:32:59,742 --> 01:33:02,244
I just don't think
I'm ever gonna be able
to look at Edward again

1280
01:33:02,328 --> 01:33:03,954
after what I did to his child.

1281
01:33:04,038 --> 01:33:05,539
He'll never find out.

1282
01:33:13,798 --> 01:33:16,675
What did I do?
What did I do?

1283
01:33:16,759 --> 01:33:18,677
I promise
it'll be okay.

1284
01:33:19,887 --> 01:33:21,263
I'll make it okay.

1285
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:30,022
Oh, my God, no.

1286
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:37,488
Edward.

1287
01:33:42,868 --> 01:33:43,953
Tony.

1288
01:33:45,121 --> 01:33:46,122
Mmm.

1289
01:33:47,206 --> 01:33:48,207
Hey.

1290
01:33:50,543 --> 01:33:52,628
You know I had
to shoot him, right?

1291
01:33:55,381 --> 01:33:59,135
I don't give a goddamn
fuck that you shot him!

1292
01:33:59,218 --> 01:34:00,553
I'm glad that you shot him!

1293
01:34:00,636 --> 01:34:03,055
I'm fucking glad
that he's dead!

1294
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:12,148
I should have stopped it!

1295
01:34:15,025 --> 01:34:16,026
I should have protected them.

1296
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:18,070
I should have seen it coming.

1297
01:34:19,321 --> 01:34:20,573
I should have stopped it.

1298
01:34:20,656 --> 01:34:21,907
Hey, now.
Hey, now.

1299
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:23,325
I should have stopped it.

1300
01:34:23,409 --> 01:34:24,410
Shh.

1301
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:27,746
It's okay.
I should have stopped it.

1302
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:28,873
It's okay.

1303
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:30,833
Hey.

1304
01:34:32,209 --> 01:34:33,711
You're okay.

1305
01:34:33,794 --> 01:34:35,880
I should have
stopped it, Bobby.

1306
01:34:35,963 --> 01:34:37,131
Look at me.

1307
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:40,009
You're a good man.

1308
01:34:42,678 --> 01:34:43,929
You're a good man.

1309
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:52,438
Come on. We gotta get up.

1310
01:34:52,521 --> 01:34:54,231
Ray gets to the road,
he's gonna hitchhike.

1311
01:34:54,315 --> 01:34:55,649
We gotta catch him
before he gets a ride.

1312
01:34:55,733 --> 01:34:57,026
Now, listen to me.

1313
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:59,486
When you get to
the fork in the road,
you veer to the left.

1314
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:01,739
That's gonna take
you back towards
where he took your folks.

1315
01:35:01,822 --> 01:35:03,782
I suspect he's gonna
go for the highway.

1316
01:35:03,866 --> 01:35:05,284
I'll go that direction.

1317
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:08,829
You take this.
I got another
one in the car.

1318
01:35:08,913 --> 01:35:10,372
Bobby...
What?

1319
01:35:11,874 --> 01:35:13,334
Are you in trouble
for all this?

1320
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:18,464
Hell, I don't know.
I don't really give a shit.

1321
01:35:18,589 --> 01:35:20,549
I'm dying, remember?

1322
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:05,821
Fuck.

1323
01:37:06,613 --> 01:37:08,824
You. Where's your pal?

1324
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:10,075
He's on his way.

1325
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:13,412
Your cop friends?

1326
01:37:16,874 --> 01:37:17,916
They're around.

1327
01:37:20,711 --> 01:37:21,712
They here?

1328
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:26,091
It's just me for the moment.

1329
01:37:27,593 --> 01:37:28,594
Oh.

1330
01:37:29,928 --> 01:37:32,264
You and that fucking gun
you don't know how to use.

1331
01:37:35,517 --> 01:37:36,769
What happened to Lou?

1332
01:37:38,896 --> 01:37:39,897
He's dead.

1333
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,231
What?

1334
01:37:41,315 --> 01:37:43,692
Fucking son of a bitch.

1335
01:37:43,776 --> 01:37:46,278
That's big trouble
for your friend,
you know that, right?

1336
01:37:47,946 --> 01:37:48,906
I don't think so.

1337
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:50,240
You don't think so?

1338
01:37:51,283 --> 01:37:52,951
Well, then, what the
fuck do you want?

1339
01:37:55,162 --> 01:37:56,914
You and that silly gun.

1340
01:37:58,624 --> 01:38:00,334
I've seen how handy
you are with that thing.

1341
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:02,002
Sit down. Sit down.

1342
01:38:03,796 --> 01:38:05,589
You sit down
or I'll fucking kill you.

1343
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,263
Listen, man...

1344
01:38:15,974 --> 01:38:18,227
Why does a nice guy like you

1345
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:21,814
hang out with a guy
like Andes who kills people?

1346
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:24,817
You kill people.

1347
01:38:32,241 --> 01:38:35,911
They had it coming to 'em,
your fucking wife
and that kid, but you...

1348
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:37,746
You got me wrong,
it was an accident.

1349
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:38,997
It was an accident?

1350
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:42,376
I got a certain pride
in how people talk to me.

1351
01:38:43,752 --> 01:38:46,004
There are certain things
I don't put up with.

1352
01:38:47,005 --> 01:38:49,508
When someone accuses
me of something,

1353
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:51,301
that's a fucking insult.

1354
01:38:52,886 --> 01:38:54,430
It gives me the right.

1355
01:38:55,556 --> 01:38:58,434
If my woman accuses me
of fucking somebody else,

1356
01:38:58,517 --> 01:39:00,978
well, then,
I'll go fuck somebody else.

1357
01:39:02,855 --> 01:39:05,983
If your daughter
thinks I'm a rapist,
then she gets raped.

1358
01:39:10,863 --> 01:39:13,866
Nobody gets away
with what you did to us.
Nobody.

1359
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:15,993
Nobody.

1360
01:39:16,076 --> 01:39:17,661
They don't?

1361
01:39:17,744 --> 01:39:18,787
Nobody.

1362
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:22,207
Nobody.

1363
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:24,918
Nobody.

1364
01:39:25,002 --> 01:39:27,004
Well, then, you should
just kill me, then.

1365
01:39:28,672 --> 01:39:29,756
Right?

1366
01:39:30,757 --> 01:39:32,593
You should fucking kill me.

1367
01:39:36,889 --> 01:39:38,307
Man, you know nothing.

1368
01:39:40,559 --> 01:39:42,227
It's fun to kill people.

1369
01:39:43,228 --> 01:39:45,647
You of all people
should try it sometime.

1370
01:39:45,731 --> 01:39:46,732
Fun?

1371
01:39:50,194 --> 01:39:51,820
It's fun to kill people?

1372
01:39:56,575 --> 01:39:57,534
Did you have fun

1373
01:39:57,618 --> 01:39:59,077
killing my wife and daughter?

1374
01:40:02,581 --> 01:40:03,624
Get up.

1375
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:06,585
Get up. Go on, now.

1376
01:40:06,668 --> 01:40:08,253
Go on. Go on.

1377
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:11,131
Go on.

1378
01:40:13,217 --> 01:40:14,218
Go on.

1379
01:40:27,314 --> 01:40:29,691
I remember your fucking wife.

1380
01:40:29,775 --> 01:40:33,612
I remember
fucking your wife.

1381
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,823
You're too weak.

1382
01:40:37,658 --> 01:40:40,035
Too fucking weak, you know.

1383
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:43,121
You're too weak
to do anything about it.

1384
01:40:46,375 --> 01:40:48,627
Son of a bitch!

1385
01:44:59,878 --> 01:45:01,046
Edward.

1386
01:48:00,266 --> 01:48:01,643
Right this way, sir.
