1
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,963
Will!

2
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:25,359
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.

3
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:28,677
You look beautiful.

4
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:33,238
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

5
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:36,478
Make way! Let me through!
How dare you!

6
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:39,923
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?

7
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:44,045
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

8
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:47,563
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.

9
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:54,281
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

10
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:57,201
In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer?

11
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:02,923
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

12
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:12,118
- This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
- Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake.

13
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:14,516
- Arrest her.
- On what charges?

14
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:18,122
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

15
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:22,166
And I have another one
for a Mr. James Norrington.

16
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,317
- Is he present?
- What are the charges?

17
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:27,956
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

18
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:30,356
That wasn't the answer
to the question I asked.

19
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:33,962
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...

20
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,357
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

21
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:40,120
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

22
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:43,324
The charge is "conspiring to set free

23
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:46,956
a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire

24
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:50,676
and condemned to death,
for which the..."

25
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:54,282
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.

26
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:59,679
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

27
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:01,678
Captain.

28
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:05,355
Captain Jack Sparrow.

29
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:08,206
Captain Jack Sparrow.

30
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,403
Yes, I thought you might.

31
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:17,155
<i>(man)</i> # Fifteen men

32
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:21,877
# Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

33
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:27,087
# Drink and the devil
had done for the rest

00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:31,638

37
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,397
Prisoners, come on!

38
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,958

00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,595

00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:10,682
<i>(screams)</i>

41
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:31,403
Sorry, mate.

42
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:36,484
Mind if we make a little side trip?

43
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:39,517
I didn't think so.

44
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:49,201
- Not quite according to plan.
- Complications arose, ensued,

45
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:51,243
were overcome.

46
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:55,917
- You got what you went in for, then?
- Mm-hm.

47
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,204
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

48
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,518
were expecting something
a bit more... shiny,

49
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:08,646
with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.

50
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:11,161
And the Royal Navy chasing us
around the Atlantic.

51
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:13,841
- And the hurricane.
- <i>(all)</i> Aye.

52
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:19,445
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

53
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,405
- Shiny.
- Aye, shiny.

54
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,398
Is that how you're all feeling?

55
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:31,607
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?

56
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,917
<i>(squawks)</i> Walk the plank.

57
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:36,885
- What did the bird say?
- Do not blame the bird.

58
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:40,198
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.

59
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:51,443
- You know that don't do no good.
- <i>(Jack)</i> It does me.

60
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:56,524
- It's a key.
- No. Much more better.

61
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:00,366
It is a drawing of a key.

62
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,318
Gentlemen,

63
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:10,238
what do keys do?

64
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,004
Keys...

65
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,362
unlock things?

66
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:19,122
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.

67
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,324
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

68
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:23,965
No.

69
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:28,241
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.

70
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:32,036
So what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

71
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:36,405
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

72
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:38,717
So we're going after this key.

73
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:41,996
You're not making any sense at all.

74
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:44,364
Any more questions?

75
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:46,881
So... do we have a heading?

76
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:49,037
Ha. A heading.

77
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:53,277
Set sail in a...

78
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:56,164
general...

79
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:02,524
that-way direction.

80
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:03,722
Captain?

81
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:08,358
Come on, snap to and make sail. You
know how this works. Go on. Oi, oi, oi!

82
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:13,957
Have you noticed lately

83
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:18,484
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?

84
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:21,240
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.

85
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,205
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,

86
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:27,996
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.

87
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:44,076
<i>(man)</i> Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

88
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,397
Those won't be necessary.

89
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:54,597
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

90
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:00,403
We wish for you to act as our agent

91
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:04,446
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

92
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:06,802
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?

93
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:09,720
<i>(Beckett)</i> We've had dealings in the past.

94
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:14,116
And we've each
left our mark on the other.

95
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:16,482
What mark did he leave on you?

96
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:22,642
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

97
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:24,683
I would like you to go to him

98
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:29,124
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

99
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:31,846
Recover. At the point of a sword?

100
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:34,318
Bargain.

101
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,397
Letters of marque.

102
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:46,075
You will offer
what amounts to a full pardon.

103
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:50,240
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

104
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:55,557
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.

105
00:10:55,647 --> 00:10:57,638
Freedom.

106
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:01,758
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

107
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:03,644
The world is shrinking,

108
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:07,003
the blank edges of the map filled in.

109
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:10,796
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.

110
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:13,560
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

111
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:16,366
You and your fiancÃ©e
face the hangman's noose.

112
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:21,598
- So you get Jack and the <i>Black Pearl</i>.
- The <i>Black Pearl</i>?

113
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:25,726
- The property you want that he possesses.
- A ship? Hardly.

114
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:29,720
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,

115
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:33,243
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

116
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:35,841
A compass?

117
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,997
Ah, you know it.

118
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:43,485
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.

119
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:10,077
Why is the rum always gone?

120
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:18,196
Oh.

121
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:20,755
That's why.

122
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:22,758
<i>(snoring)</i>

123
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:28,438
As you were, gents.

124
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,278
Ah.

125
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,998
<i>(man)</i> Time's run out, Jack.

126
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,281
Bootstrap.

127
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,437
Bill Turner.

128
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,282
You look good, Jack.

129
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,883
Is this a dream?

130
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:43,320
No.

131
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,843
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.

132
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:56,796
You got the <i>Pearl</i> back, I see.

133
00:13:57,487 --> 00:14:01,162
I had some help retrieving the <i>Pearl</i>,
by the way.

134
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:04,636
Your son.

135
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,082
William?

136
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:10,116
He ended up a pirate after all.

137
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:14,715
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?

138
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:16,877
He sent me.

139
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,727
Davy Jones.

140
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:23,275
Oh.

141
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:25,278
So it's you, then.

142
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:30,004
He shanghaied you
into service, eh?

143
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:31,998
I chose it.

144
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:36,877
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

145
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:40,081
I stood up for you.

146
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,965
Everything went wrong after that.

147
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:49,197
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

148
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:52,085
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

149
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,601
Unable to move.

150
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,802
Unable to die, Jack.

151
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:03,245
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

152
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:05,957
I would trade anything for it.

153
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:11,039
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

154
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,687
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

155
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:16,281
He raised the <i>Pearl</i>
from the depths for you.

156
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:18,358
13 years, you've been her captain.

157
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:20,278
- Technically...
- Jack.

158
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,676
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

159
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:25,406
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

160
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:29,639
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.

161
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:32,036
The <i>Flying Dutchman</i>
already has a captain...

162
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:34,357
Then it's the locker for you!

163
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:37,519
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

164
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:41,759
and drag the <i>Pearl</i> back to the depths
and you along with it.

165
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:47,038
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?

166
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,798
I already told you, Jack.

167
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:53,917
Your time is up.

168
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,723
It comes now,

169
00:15:56,807 --> 00:16:01,927
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

170
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:13,804
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!

171
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:16,082
On deck! Scurry!

172
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:20,558
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!

173
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,242
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!

174
00:16:24,327 --> 00:16:28,559
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!

175
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:31,878
- Do we have a heading?
- Argh! Run! Land.

176
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:40,356
- Which port?
- I didn't say "port", I said "land". Any land.

177
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:49,559
- Jack's hat! Bring her about!
- <i>(Jack)</i> No, no!

178
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:51,842
Leave it!

179
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:54,802
Run.

180
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,605
Back to your stations,
the lot of you!

181
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,399
- Jack?
- Shh.

182
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:13,720
For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what's coming after us?

183
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,479
Nothing.

184
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:33,037

Governor Swann, still.

Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?

191
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:40,237
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

192
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:44,320
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.

193
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:46,841
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.

194
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:50,442
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

195
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:52,961
Is that a lack of faith in Jack
or in me?

196
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:55,242
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow

197
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:59,081
does not mean
he would do the same for anyone else.

198
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:02,443
Now, where is that dog with the keys?

199

Both of you.

202
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,961
Where will you find him?

203
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:17,598
Tortuga. I'll start there
and I won't stop searching till I find him.

204
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:21,283
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.

205
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:24,564
- Properly?
- Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

206
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:29,486
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.

207
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:40,044
- I'll wait for you.
- Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

208
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:51,197
Captain Jack Sparrow?

209
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:56,405
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.

210
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,162
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

211
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:04,445
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.

212
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:06,438
Jack Sparrow?

213
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,518
I haven't seen him in a month.

214
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,236
When you find him,
will you give him a message?

215
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:15,681
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

216
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:18,327
but there's an island
just south of the straits

217
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:20,637
where I trade spice for...

218
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:23,241
mm, delicious long pork.

219
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,720
Cannot say about Jack,
but you'll find a ship there.

220
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:31,037
A ship with black sails.

221
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,038
My brother will take you ashore.

222
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:53,240
- What's wrong? The beach is there.
- <i>C'est trop dangereux.</i>

223
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:56,637
- What?
- <i>C'est trop dangereux, je vous l'avais dit.</i>

No! Will's gone to find Jack!

267

We cannot count on William Turner.

- Come!
- He's better than you give him credit for.

269
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:40,723
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only -

270
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:43,037
one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.

271
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:44,765
Even if Will succeeds,

272
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:50,683
do not ask me to endure the sight of my
daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.

273
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:54,999
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

274
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:59,956
- A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
- Then there is nothing left for you here.

275

Whoa!

276
00:26:06,807 --> 00:26:08,877
Wait inside.

Shame, that.

He was carrying this.

283
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,761
It's a letter to the king.

- No...

<i>(groans)</i>

00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:07,446
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,

00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,722
as your father believes.

291
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:13,047
Then what is?

292
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:16,244
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.

00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:21,401
I expect, then, we can come
to some sort of understanding.

- I'm here to negotiate.
- I'm listening.

295
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:29,202
I'm listening intently.

296
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:33,316
These letters of marque
are signed by the king.

297
00:27:33,407 --> 00:27:37,958
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.

298
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:40,641
Or else I would not still be here.

299
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:44,606
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.

300
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:48,236
- It will do you no good.
- Do explain.

301
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:52,923
I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.

302
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:54,998
There is something
you need to know.

303
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:57,078
Ah, I see.

304
00:27:57,167 --> 00:28:00,159
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta

305
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:03,284
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

306
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,322
But you mustn't worry.

307
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:10,078
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

308
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:12,556
My desires are not so provincial.

309
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:17,365
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.

310
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:22,446
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.

<i>(cocks gun)</i>

312
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:29,483
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.

313
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:31,637
So I did.

314
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,717
A marriage interrupted...

315
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:40,521
or fate intervenes?

316
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:44,358
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

317
00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:46,881
- These aren't going to Jack.
- Oh, really?

318
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:49,606
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom, then,

319
00:28:50,447 --> 00:28:53,086
I'll still want that compass.

320
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:56,637
Consider that in your calculations.

321
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:18,405
I say it was Divine Providence
what escaped us from jail.

322
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:21,081
And I say it was me being clever.

323
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:24,755
Ain't that right, poochie?

324
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:28,840
Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine
Providence what inspired you to be clever?

325
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:30,997
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

326
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:36,161
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?

327
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:40,684
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

328
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:44,396
- You know you can't read.
- It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

329
00:29:44,487 --> 00:29:49,720
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.

00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:01,327
Amen to that.

348
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:18,803
Thank you.

349
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:38,118
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...

350
00:31:38,207 --> 00:31:40,562
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,

351
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:44,083
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

352
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:47,159
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.

353
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:53,686
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form,

354
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:59,637
and they intend to do him the honor
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

355
00:31:59,727 --> 00:32:01,638
<i>(yelps)</i>

356
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:05,362
They'll roast him and eat him.

357
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:08,085
Where's the rest of the crew?

358
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:12,558
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.

359
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,883
The feast is about to begin.

360
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:19,563
Jack's life will end

361
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,877
when the drums stop.

362
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:26,041
Well, we can't just sit here and wait,
then, can we?

363
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,927
No, no. Oi! No, no.

364
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:33,999
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

365
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:36,123
I am Chief. Want big fire.

366
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:38,323
Come on.

367
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:41,601
Oi. <i>(cannibals' language)</i>
<i>Tout de suite.</i>

368
00:32:41,687 --> 00:32:43,917
Come on. More wood.

369
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:11,678
Whoa!

370
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,478
Oh, bugger.

371
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:02,837
A little seasoning, eh?

372
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,645
Well done.

373
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:58,598
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!

374
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:03,600
Come on, men!
It'll take all of us to crew the <i>Black Pearl</i>!

375
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,326
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

376
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:08,637
About six would do.

377
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:13,805
Oh, dear.

378
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:19,687
- Hurry!
- Come on!

379
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,596
Come on! Is that all you got?

380
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,361
- Wait. Stop.
- Eh?

381
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:38,077
Stop. Shh.

382
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:46,878
Shh.

383
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,956
- <i>(Marty)</i> What are they doing?
- Stop.

384
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,875
- Snake!
- <i>(screaming)</i>

385
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,559

Well, go on, go get them.

389
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,277
No, no. Oi! No, no!

390
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:57,119
Not good.

391
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:14,877
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

392
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,999
<i>(cannibals shouting)</i>

393
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:34,805

- Come on, lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.

397
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:24,324

00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:07,557
The mooring line!

411
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:11,162
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!

412
00:41:11,247 --> 00:41:14,444
- Don't bite it!
- <i>(Pintel)</i> Haul loose the mooring line!

413
00:41:14,927 --> 00:41:16,963
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.

414
00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:20,357
- How'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.

415
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:22,836
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.

416
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:25,725
- Make ready to sail, boys!
- What about Jack?

417
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:29,038
- I won't leave without him.
- <i>(Jack)</i> Oi!

418
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:39,685
- Time to go.
- Cast off those lines!

419
00:41:44,887 --> 00:41:47,685
Aaargh!

420
00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:50,965
- Make ready to cast off!
- Oi!

421
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:56,642
Good doggy.

422
00:42:11,407 --> 00:42:17,482
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall
always remember as the day you almost...

423
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:22,563
Captain Jack Sparrow.

424
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:25,918
<i>(dog barks)</i>

425
00:42:47,287 --> 00:42:50,245
Let's get away from this island
and head out to open sea.

426
00:42:50,327 --> 00:42:54,639
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but
only insofar as we keep to the shallows.

427
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:56,763
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

428
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:59,884
I have faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills.

429
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,925
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

430
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,642
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

431
00:43:10,727 --> 00:43:13,400
Have you considered
just locking her up somewhere?

432
00:43:13,487 --> 00:43:15,921
She is locked up,
bound to hang for helping you.

433
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:20,797
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

434
00:43:22,007 --> 00:43:24,316
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

435
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:26,875
I must trade it for her freedom.

436
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:31,647
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Captain.

437
00:43:31,727 --> 00:43:34,639
We have a need to travel upriver.

438
00:43:34,727 --> 00:43:38,083
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

439
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:41,796
Fleeting?
As in, say, a passing fancy?

440
00:43:41,887 --> 00:43:45,516
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

441
00:43:45,607 --> 00:43:49,236
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

442
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,158
William,

443
00:43:51,247 --> 00:43:53,203
I shall trade you the compass

444
00:43:53,287 --> 00:43:55,039
if you will help me

445
00:43:55,127 --> 00:43:57,197
to find this.

446
00:44:00,727 --> 00:44:03,116
- You want me to find this?
- No.

447
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:06,562
You want you to find this,

448
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:10,560
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

449
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:17,086
and/or locating in your discovering a way
to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.

450
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:19,886
Savvy?

451
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,801
This is going to save Elizabeth?

452
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:28,965
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

453
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:32,600
Not much.

454
00:44:32,687 --> 00:44:35,565
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

455
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:58,678
<i>(arguing)</i>

456
00:45:00,807 --> 00:45:03,367
What's all this?

457
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:08,722
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.

458
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:12,004
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.

459
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:14,722
Is it, now? And you?

460
00:45:14,807 --> 00:45:18,766
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

461
00:45:18,847 --> 00:45:21,236
All the men, they can feel it.

462
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:24,922
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

463
00:45:25,007 --> 00:45:27,202
searching for her husband,
lost at sea.

464
00:45:27,287 --> 00:45:29,755
A virgin too, likely as not.

465
00:45:29,847 --> 00:45:31,997
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

466
00:45:32,087 --> 00:45:36,399
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

467
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:39,206
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

468
00:45:39,287 --> 00:45:43,166
What we need to do is find out what
the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.

469
00:45:43,247 --> 00:45:45,397
Enough! Enough!

470
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:49,605
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

471
00:45:49,687 --> 00:45:52,759
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

472
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:54,917
A young woman, by the look of it.

473
00:45:55,007 --> 00:45:57,521
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

474
00:45:57,607 --> 00:46:00,246
Oh, and, er... she's probably naked.

475
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:31,441
<i>(Will)</i> Why is Jack afraid
of the open ocean?

476
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:33,802
Well, if you believe such things,

477
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:36,960
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones -

478
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:41,438
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

479
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:44,997
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

480
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:48,637
The kraken.

481
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:54,561
They say the stench of its breath is like...
<i>(shudders)</i>

482
00:46:54,647 --> 00:46:58,003
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

483
00:46:58,087 --> 00:47:03,798
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking
odor of a thousand rotting corpses.

484
00:47:05,607 --> 00:47:07,996
If you believe such things.

485
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:10,796
And the key will spare him that?

486
00:47:10,887 --> 00:47:14,243
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

487
00:47:14,327 --> 00:47:16,716
Bad enough even to go visit...

488
00:47:17,607 --> 00:47:19,677
her.

489
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:21,564
Her?

490
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:23,558
Aye.

491
00:47:57,127 --> 00:48:00,676
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

492
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:04,555
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

493
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:06,877
Were. Have been.

494
00:48:08,007 --> 00:48:08,996
Before.

495
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:11,920
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

496
00:48:12,007 --> 00:48:14,396
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

497
00:48:15,207 --> 00:48:17,675

00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:21,917
Mind the boat.

00:48:33,204 --> 00:48:36,355
Jack Sparrow.

501
00:48:36,444 --> 00:48:38,480
Tia Dalma.

502
00:48:39,244 --> 00:48:43,635
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

503
00:48:48,124 --> 00:48:50,001
You...

504
00:48:52,324 --> 00:48:54,838
You have a touch of...

You know me?

508
00:49:03,884 --> 00:49:06,398
You want to know me.

509
00:49:06,484 --> 00:49:10,921
There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without it.

510
00:49:11,004 --> 00:49:14,519
- I thought I knew you.
- Not so well as I had hoped.

511
00:49:14,604 --> 00:49:16,674
- Come.
- Come.

512
00:49:20,244 --> 00:49:24,556
What service may I do you?

513
00:49:25,244 --> 00:49:29,032
- You know I demand payment.
- I brought payment. <i>(whistles)</i>

514
00:49:32,484 --> 00:49:34,395
Look.

515
00:49:35,524 --> 00:49:37,833
An undead monkey.

516
00:49:37,924 --> 00:49:39,994
Top that.

517
00:49:43,764 --> 00:49:47,518
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

518
00:49:47,964 --> 00:49:50,353
The payment is fair.

519
00:49:50,444 --> 00:49:52,355
We're looking for this.

520
00:49:54,804 --> 00:49:57,523
And what it goes to.

521
00:49:58,924 --> 00:50:03,395
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

522
00:50:03,484 --> 00:50:06,760
Maybe. Why?

523
00:50:06,844 --> 00:50:09,074
I hear you.

524
00:50:09,164 --> 00:50:13,442
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

525
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:16,239
Or do you know,

526
00:50:16,324 --> 00:50:20,078
but are loath to claim it as your own?

527
00:50:21,724 --> 00:50:23,680
Your key go to a chest.

528
00:50:24,244 --> 00:50:28,601
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

529
00:50:28,684 --> 00:50:31,482
- What is inside?
- Gold?

530
00:50:31,564 --> 00:50:35,477
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

531
00:50:35,564 --> 00:50:38,601
Nothing bad, I hope?

532
00:50:39,324 --> 00:50:42,077
You know of Davy Jones,

533
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,643
yes?

534
00:50:43,724 --> 00:50:46,397
A man of the sea.

535
00:50:46,484 --> 00:50:48,679
A great sailor,

536
00:50:48,764 --> 00:50:53,554
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

537
00:50:53,644 --> 00:50:56,522
What vexes all men?

538
00:50:58,004 --> 00:51:00,393
What indeed?

539
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:02,835
- The sea.
- Sums.

540
00:51:02,924 --> 00:51:05,802
The dichotomy of good and evil.

541
00:51:06,404 --> 00:51:08,042
A woman.

542
00:51:08,324 --> 00:51:09,882
A woman.

543
00:51:09,964 --> 00:51:11,955
He fell in love.

544
00:51:12,044 --> 00:51:14,877
No, no, no, no.
I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

545
00:51:14,964 --> 00:51:18,752
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

546
00:51:18,844 --> 00:51:21,119
See, it was a woman

547
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:23,843
as changing and harsh

548
00:51:23,924 --> 00:51:27,200
and untamable as the sea.

549
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,593
Him never stopped loving her.

550
00:51:29,684 --> 00:51:34,280
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

551
00:51:34,364 --> 00:51:36,958
but not enough to cause him to die.

552
00:51:38,644 --> 00:51:42,922
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

553
00:51:43,004 --> 00:51:44,881
Him heart.

554
00:51:44,964 --> 00:51:46,955
Literally or figuratively?

555
00:51:47,044 --> 00:51:51,401
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

556
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:53,395
Could he?

557
00:51:53,484 --> 00:51:59,320
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

558
00:51:59,404 --> 00:52:00,996
And so...

559
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,678
him carve out him heart,

560
00:52:04,244 --> 00:52:08,760
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.

561
00:52:09,604 --> 00:52:11,595
The key

562
00:52:11,684 --> 00:52:16,041
he keep with him at all times.

563
00:52:16,644 --> 00:52:20,193
- You knew this.
- I did not. I didn't know where the key was.

564
00:52:20,284 --> 00:52:24,323
But now we do. All that's left is to climb
aboard the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>, grab the key,

565
00:52:24,404 --> 00:52:27,043
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, eh?

566
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:29,877
Let me see your hand.

567
00:52:42,884 --> 00:52:45,273
<i>(Gibbs gasps)</i> The black spot!

568
00:52:46,284 --> 00:52:49,674
- <i>(Ragetti moans)</i> The black spot!
- <i>(Pintel)</i> Black spot!

569
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,042
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

570
00:52:53,124 --> 00:52:56,434
<i>(Tia Dalma)</i> I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?

571
00:52:56,524 --> 00:52:59,038
<i>(clattering)</i>

572
00:52:59,764 --> 00:53:03,120
My little beauty, where are you?

573
00:53:03,204 --> 00:53:06,594
Such a long time in such a mess.

574
00:53:08,564 --> 00:53:11,317
Davy Jones cannot make port.

575
00:53:11,404 --> 00:53:14,601
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

576
00:53:15,124 --> 00:53:18,241
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

577
00:53:18,324 --> 00:53:20,758
and so you will carry land with you.

578
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:31,555
Dirt.

579
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:36,159
- This is a jar of dirt.
- Yes.

580
00:53:38,404 --> 00:53:41,157
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

581
00:53:41,244 --> 00:53:44,042
If you don't want it, give it back.

582
00:53:44,524 --> 00:53:47,561
- No.
- Then it helps.

583
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:54,519
It seems we have a need to find
the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>.

584
00:53:57,524 --> 00:54:01,199
A touch of destiny.

585
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,478
That's the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>?

586
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,997
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

587
00:54:23,084 --> 00:54:25,314
Do not underestimate her.

588
00:54:26,724 --> 00:54:30,956
- Must have run afoul of the reef.
- So, what's your plan, then?

589
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:34,354
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

590
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:36,719
And if there are crewmen?

591
00:54:36,804 --> 00:54:38,954
I cut down anyone in my path.

592
00:54:39,764 --> 00:54:42,562
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

593
00:54:42,644 --> 00:54:46,603
<i>(Ragetti)</i> Your chariot awaits you, Sire.
<i>(cackles)</i>

594
00:54:48,644 --> 00:54:49,759
Oi!

595
00:54:49,844 --> 00:54:55,362
If you do happen to get captured, just say
Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.

596
00:54:55,444 --> 00:54:59,198
- It might save your life.
- <i>(Ragetti)</i> Bon voyage!

597
00:55:03,004 --> 00:55:05,472
Douse the lamps.

598
00:55:42,884 --> 00:55:45,352
<i>(mutters)</i>

599
00:55:45,444 --> 00:55:46,479
Sailor.

600
00:55:46,564 --> 00:55:49,032
- Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
- Sailor!

601
00:55:49,124 --> 00:55:51,399
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.

602
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:54,078
There's no use.
You've run aground.

603
00:55:54,164 --> 00:55:55,483
No.

604
00:55:55,564 --> 00:55:57,634
Beneath us.

605
00:55:58,444 --> 00:56:00,753
Foul breath.

606
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:02,835
<i>(crash)</i>

607
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:10,039
<i>(whimpering)</i>

608
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:15,238
Hey! Hey!

609
00:56:20,124 --> 00:56:21,796
<i>(gasps)</i>

610
00:56:51,164 --> 00:56:53,917
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

611
00:57:08,204 --> 00:57:11,992
Get back! Get back!

612
00:57:23,444 --> 00:57:25,480
<i>(laughter)</i>

613
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:34,275
<i>(thumping)</i>

614
00:57:42,284 --> 00:57:45,799
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

615
00:58:02,244 --> 00:58:05,281
Do you fear death?

616
00:58:06,644 --> 00:58:11,274
Do you fear that dark abyss?

617
00:58:13,084 --> 00:58:15,803
All your deeds laid bare.

618
00:58:16,644 --> 00:58:19,522
All your sins punished.

619
00:58:21,284 --> 00:58:23,673
I can offer you

620
00:58:23,764 --> 00:58:26,119
an escape.

621
00:58:26,204 --> 00:58:29,162
<i>(man)</i> Don't listen to him!

622
00:58:37,444 --> 00:58:40,322
Do you not fear death?

623
00:58:42,684 --> 00:58:45,152
I'll take my chances, sir.

624
00:58:45,244 --> 00:58:47,553
To the depths.

625
00:58:52,804 --> 00:58:54,760
Cruel blackguard!

626
00:58:54,844 --> 00:58:56,914
Life is cruel.

627
00:58:57,804 --> 00:59:00,477
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

628
00:59:00,964 --> 00:59:04,001
I offer you a choice.

629
00:59:04,084 --> 00:59:06,678
Join my crew

630
00:59:06,764 --> 00:59:08,994
and postpone the judgment.

631
00:59:10,364 --> 00:59:13,720
One hundred years before the mast.

632
00:59:15,924 --> 00:59:17,801
Will ye serve?

633
00:59:19,524 --> 00:59:21,435
I-I will serve.

634
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,833
There.

635
00:59:23,924 --> 00:59:25,880
<i>(laughter)</i>

636
00:59:30,444 --> 00:59:33,800
You are neither dead nor dying.

637
00:59:33,884 --> 00:59:36,398
What is your purpose here?

638
00:59:39,084 --> 00:59:42,121
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

639
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,321
<i>What</i> is your purpose here?

640
00:59:46,404 --> 00:59:49,476
Jack Sparrow
sent me to settle his debt.

641
00:59:52,324 --> 00:59:54,792
Did he, now?

642
00:59:54,884 --> 00:59:58,194
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

643
01:00:07,044 --> 01:00:09,239
<i>(frightened gasps)</i>

644
01:00:13,004 --> 01:00:13,993
Oh.

645
01:00:14,404 --> 01:00:17,123
You have a debt to pay.

646
01:00:17,204 --> 01:00:20,480
You've been captain of the <i>Black Pearl</i>
for 13 years.

647
01:00:20,564 --> 01:00:22,555
That was our agreement.

648
01:00:22,644 --> 01:00:26,319
Technically I was only captain
for two years, then I was mutinied upon.

649
01:00:26,404 --> 01:00:30,033
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

650
01:00:30,124 --> 01:00:33,241
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years

651
01:00:33,324 --> 01:00:35,792
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

652
01:00:35,884 --> 01:00:38,034
<i>(laughter)</i>

653
01:00:38,644 --> 01:00:41,477
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.

654
01:00:41,564 --> 01:00:44,681
- One soul is not equal to another.
- Aha!

655
01:00:44,764 --> 01:00:51,033
We've established my proposal is sound
in principle. Now we're haggling over price.

656
01:00:51,124 --> 01:00:53,592
Price?

657
01:00:55,524 --> 01:00:58,880
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

658
01:01:02,484 --> 01:01:05,044
One hundred souls.

659
01:01:05,924 --> 01:01:07,642
Three days.

660
01:01:08,124 --> 01:01:11,833
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.

661
01:01:11,924 --> 01:01:14,916
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.

662
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:18,838
That leaves you only 99 more to go.
<i>(laughs)</i>

663
01:01:20,484 --> 01:01:22,395
Have you not met Will Turner?

664
01:01:22,484 --> 01:01:25,203
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.

665
01:01:25,284 --> 01:01:27,559
Worth at least four.

666
01:01:27,644 --> 01:01:29,794
Maybe three and a half.

667
01:01:30,564 --> 01:01:33,442
And did I happen to mention...

668
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:35,879
he's in love?

669
01:01:36,684 --> 01:01:39,198
With a girl.

670
01:01:39,284 --> 01:01:41,593
Due to be married.

671
01:01:41,684 --> 01:01:43,561
Betrothed.

672
01:01:44,484 --> 01:01:49,000
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

673
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:52,918
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony.

674
01:01:53,004 --> 01:01:54,915
Eh?

675
01:01:57,564 --> 01:02:02,240
I keep the boy. 99 souls.

676
01:02:02,324 --> 01:02:04,884
But I wonder, Sparrow,

677
01:02:04,964 --> 01:02:07,114
can you live with this?

678
01:02:07,804 --> 01:02:11,479
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,

679
01:02:11,564 --> 01:02:16,319
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

680
01:02:19,404 --> 01:02:21,360
Yep. I'm good with it.

681
01:02:21,444 --> 01:02:24,481
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean... ink.

682
01:02:25,164 --> 01:02:27,075
<i>(gasps)</i>

683
01:02:28,604 --> 01:02:31,243
Three days.

684
01:02:35,564 --> 01:02:37,634
- Three days.
- <i>(whimpers)</i>

685
01:02:44,924 --> 01:02:47,722
- Er, Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye.

686
01:02:47,804 --> 01:02:50,318
I-I feel sullied and unusual.

687
01:02:50,404 --> 01:02:55,956
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

688
01:02:56,044 --> 01:03:00,560
Fortunately, he was mum as to
the condition in which these souls need be.

689
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:01,838
Ah.

690
01:03:01,924 --> 01:03:03,801
Tortuga.

691
01:03:04,844 --> 01:03:06,243
Tortuga.

692
01:03:10,084 --> 01:03:13,554
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,

693
01:03:13,644 --> 01:03:16,761
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

694
01:03:16,844 --> 01:03:21,042
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?

695
01:03:21,124 --> 01:03:25,402
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is
the only free port left in these waters.

696
01:03:25,484 --> 01:03:27,998
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.

697
01:03:28,084 --> 01:03:33,317
An honest sailor is what I am. I make
my living fair and I sleep well each night.

698
01:03:34,004 --> 01:03:35,835
S-sir!

699
01:03:42,124 --> 01:03:44,001
<i>(gasps)</i>

700
01:03:58,164 --> 01:04:00,598
<i>(bursar)</i> She wants you
to do something.

701
01:04:03,604 --> 01:04:06,164
She's trying to give a sign.

702
01:04:10,044 --> 01:04:11,477
Whoa!

703
01:04:14,204 --> 01:04:16,593
Over there! Look for a sign!

704
01:04:18,404 --> 01:04:20,360
<i>(sighs)</i>

705
01:04:21,164 --> 01:04:23,234
Look, there! There it is!

706
01:04:23,684 --> 01:04:26,152
- There's the sign!
- That's seaweed.

707
01:04:26,244 --> 01:04:29,202
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.

708
01:04:29,284 --> 01:04:34,153
- That would be a bad sign.
- <i>(deep voice)</i> What's that over there?

709
01:04:51,724 --> 01:04:54,796
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the <i>Black Pearl</i>?

710
01:04:54,884 --> 01:04:57,034
I've never sailed a day in me life.

711
01:04:57,124 --> 01:05:00,161
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.

712
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:03,475
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next!

713
01:05:03,564 --> 01:05:06,124
My wife ran off with my dog

714
01:05:06,564 --> 01:05:08,919
and I'm drunk for a month

715
01:05:09,004 --> 01:05:10,995
and I don't give an ass rat's

716
01:05:11,084 --> 01:05:12,961
if I live or die.

717
01:05:13,044 --> 01:05:15,956
- Perfect. Next!
- I know what I want. I know what I want...

718
01:05:16,044 --> 01:05:20,003
- Me have one arm and a bum leg.
- It's the crow's nest for you.

719
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,154
- I know what I want.
- <i>(Gibbs)</i> Next!

720
01:05:22,244 --> 01:05:27,637
Ever since I was a little lad, I've always
wanted to sail the seas... forever.

721
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:30,318
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.

722
01:05:30,404 --> 01:05:32,599
Thanks very much.

723
01:05:32,684 --> 01:05:37,633
- <i>(Jack)</i> How we going?
- Including those four, that gives us... four.

724
01:05:40,964 --> 01:05:43,034
And what's your story?

725
01:05:43,124 --> 01:05:45,513
<i>(Norrington)</i> My story.

726
01:05:45,604 --> 01:05:50,473
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

727
01:05:50,564 --> 01:05:54,034
I chased a man
across the seven seas.

728
01:05:54,124 --> 01:05:56,843
The pursuit cost me my crew,

729
01:05:56,924 --> 01:05:59,484
my commission,

730
01:05:59,564 --> 01:06:01,634
and my life.

731
01:06:06,484 --> 01:06:11,114
- Commodore?
- No, not any more. Weren't you listening?

732
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:16,472
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

733
01:06:17,204 --> 01:06:21,561
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.

734
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:22,963
Lord.

735
01:06:23,044 --> 01:06:24,955
You didn't try to sail through it?

736
01:06:25,044 --> 01:06:27,478
So, do I make your crew

737
01:06:27,564 --> 01:06:29,475
or not?

738
01:06:30,284 --> 01:06:32,923
You haven't said where you're going.

739
01:06:33,004 --> 01:06:34,995
Somewhere nice?!

740
01:06:36,004 --> 01:06:38,313
So, am I worthy to serve

741
01:06:38,404 --> 01:06:41,077
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

742
01:06:43,444 --> 01:06:46,720
Or should I just kill you now?

743
01:06:52,604 --> 01:06:54,674
You're hired.

744
01:06:54,764 --> 01:06:58,598
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

745
01:06:58,684 --> 01:07:02,074
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.

746
01:07:06,804 --> 01:07:08,442
<i>(band plays a merry jig)</i>

747
01:07:14,724 --> 01:07:16,635
- Time to go.
- Aye!

748
01:07:59,444 --> 01:08:02,402
- Thanks, mate.
- Aargh!

749
01:08:06,844 --> 01:08:08,675
Carry on.

750
01:08:15,684 --> 01:08:18,152
Come on, then! Who wants some?

751
01:08:18,244 --> 01:08:21,600
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.

752
01:08:21,684 --> 01:08:23,879
Come on, who's first?

753
01:08:26,404 --> 01:08:29,794
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

754
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:57,958
James Norrington.

755
01:08:58,804 --> 01:09:01,796
What has the world done to you?

756
01:09:09,924 --> 01:09:12,358
<i>(dramatic organ music)</i>

757
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:30,914
Heave!

758
01:09:31,164 --> 01:09:33,280
Heave!

759
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:35,835
Heave!

760
01:09:36,084 --> 01:09:37,915
Heave!

761
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:42,234
- Heave!
- Heave!

762
01:09:45,004 --> 01:09:48,838
Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner!

763
01:09:51,724 --> 01:09:53,794
Set to it!

764
01:09:56,404 --> 01:09:58,793
<i>(thunder)</i>

765
01:09:58,884 --> 01:10:01,682
- Step aside.
- Hey! Mind yourself!

766
01:10:02,084 --> 01:10:04,393
Let go, boy!

767
01:10:06,924 --> 01:10:08,994
No.

768
01:10:16,644 --> 01:10:19,204
Haul that weevil to his feet.

769
01:10:24,524 --> 01:10:27,834
Five lashes will remind you
to stay on 'em!

770
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:32,793
- No!
- Impeding me in my duties?

771
01:10:32,884 --> 01:10:36,559
- You'll share the punishment.
- I'll take it all.

772
01:10:36,644 --> 01:10:38,919
Will you, now?

773
01:10:39,004 --> 01:10:44,032
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

774
01:10:47,604 --> 01:10:49,481
My son.

775
01:10:54,204 --> 01:10:56,434
He's my son.

776
01:11:04,164 --> 01:11:07,122
<i>(laughs)</i>

777
01:11:07,204 --> 01:11:10,355
What fortuitous circumstance be this?

778
01:11:10,444 --> 01:11:14,153
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

779
01:11:18,884 --> 01:11:21,273
No. No, I won't!

780
01:11:21,364 --> 01:11:24,037
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.

781
01:11:24,444 --> 01:11:29,677
Your issue will feel its sting,
be it by the bosun's hand or your own.

782
01:11:33,364 --> 01:11:35,639
No.

783
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:37,635
- Bosun!
- No!

784
01:12:09,444 --> 01:12:11,355
<i>(whip)</i>

785
01:12:14,444 --> 01:12:15,877
<i>(whip)</i>

786
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:23,320
<i>(Jimmy Legs)</i> You had it easy, boy!

787
01:12:23,404 --> 01:12:26,237
- Will.
- I don't need your help.

788
01:12:27,924 --> 01:12:33,999
The bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh
from bone, with every swing.

789
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:38,839
So I'm to understand
what you did was an act of compassion?

790
01:12:38,924 --> 01:12:40,960
Yes.

791
01:12:46,684 --> 01:12:52,316
100 years before the mast,
losing who you were, bit by bit,

792
01:12:52,404 --> 01:12:56,113
until you end up...
end up like poor Wyvern here.

793
01:12:57,844 --> 01:13:01,723
Once you've sworn an oath
to the <i>Dutchman</i>, there's no leaving it.

794
01:13:01,804 --> 01:13:04,762
Not until your debt is paid.

795
01:13:04,844 --> 01:13:07,199
I've sworn no oath.

796
01:13:08,844 --> 01:13:10,914
You must get away.

797
01:13:11,924 --> 01:13:13,960
Not until I find this.

798
01:13:15,564 --> 01:13:17,361
The key.

799
01:13:24,284 --> 01:13:26,593
The dead man's chest.

800
01:13:27,724 --> 01:13:29,760
What do you know of this?

801
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:34,360
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...

802
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:37,436
No, don't stab the heart.

803
01:13:37,524 --> 01:13:42,359
The <i>Dutchman</i> needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,

804
01:13:42,444 --> 01:13:46,562
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

805
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:49,432
So the captain has the key?

806
01:13:50,604 --> 01:13:53,277
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.

807
01:13:53,644 --> 01:13:56,317
- Where is the chest?
- Hidden.

808
01:13:59,364 --> 01:14:01,116
<i>(Elizabeth)</i> Captain Sparrow!

809
01:14:01,204 --> 01:14:03,559
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.

810
01:14:03,644 --> 01:14:06,204
I'm here to find the man I love.

811
01:14:07,164 --> 01:14:11,521
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.

812
01:14:12,604 --> 01:14:16,563
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.

813
01:14:16,644 --> 01:14:17,963
Elizabeth.

814
01:14:18,044 --> 01:14:20,353
Hide the rum.

815
01:14:20,444 --> 01:14:23,197
These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.

816
01:14:23,284 --> 01:14:26,242
- I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.

817
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:31,481
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

818
01:14:31,564 --> 01:14:34,954
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but...

819
01:14:35,044 --> 01:14:41,677
through unfortunate circumstances
that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,

820
01:14:41,764 --> 01:14:46,280
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones's crew.

821
01:14:47,284 --> 01:14:49,115
Davy Jones?

822
01:14:49,204 --> 01:14:50,432
<i>(splutters)</i>

823
01:14:50,524 --> 01:14:52,799
Oh, please.

824
01:14:53,844 --> 01:14:56,199
The captain of the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>?

825
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:59,515
- You look awful. What are you doing here?
- You hired me.

826
01:14:59,604 --> 01:15:01,754
I can't help it if your standards are lax.

827
01:15:01,844 --> 01:15:04,597
- You smell funny.
- Jack!

828
01:15:05,004 --> 01:15:07,677
All I want is to find Will.

829
01:15:10,924 --> 01:15:15,202
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?

830
01:15:16,084 --> 01:15:18,359
Of course.

831
01:15:18,444 --> 01:15:22,517
Because I would think you'd want to find
a way to save Will most.

832
01:15:23,124 --> 01:15:26,833
- And you'd have a way of doing that?
- Well...

833
01:15:26,924 --> 01:15:30,041
- there is a chest.
- Oh, dear.

834
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:32,354
A chest of unknown size and origin.

835
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:37,154
What contains
the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.

836
01:15:38,524 --> 01:15:40,276
And whoever possesses that chest

837
01:15:40,364 --> 01:15:44,152
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,

838
01:15:44,244 --> 01:15:48,954
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

839
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:52,480
You don't actually believe him, do you?

840
01:15:57,044 --> 01:15:59,274
How would we find it?

841
01:16:01,364 --> 01:16:03,116
With this.

842
01:16:03,204 --> 01:16:06,002
My compass... is unique.

843
01:16:06,524 --> 01:16:09,596
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken".

844
01:16:10,564 --> 01:16:14,796
True enough,
this compass does not point north.

845
01:16:14,884 --> 01:16:16,875
<i>(Norrington vomits)</i>

846
01:16:16,964 --> 01:16:19,637
Where does it point?

847
01:16:19,724 --> 01:16:24,320
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.

848
01:16:26,884 --> 01:16:28,795
Oh, Jack.

849
01:16:30,724 --> 01:16:34,319
- Are you telling the truth?
- Every word, love.

850
01:16:34,404 --> 01:16:36,759
And what you want most in this world

851
01:16:37,604 --> 01:16:42,314
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

852
01:16:42,404 --> 01:16:47,159
- To save Will.
- By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

853
01:17:01,613 --> 01:17:03,843
- Mr. Gibbs!
- Cap'n.

854
01:17:03,933 --> 01:17:06,083
- We have our heading.
- Finally!

855
01:17:06,173 --> 01:17:10,564
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

856
01:17:10,653 --> 01:17:13,804
- Miss Swann.
- <i>(Gibb shouts orders to crew)</i>

857
01:17:14,733 --> 01:17:18,009
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

858
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:29,049
There's something to knowing the exact
shape of the world and one's place in it.

859
01:17:29,133 --> 01:17:31,727
I assure you, these are not necessary.

860
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:36,091
I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

861
01:17:36,173 --> 01:17:39,529
- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen on Tortuga,

862
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:43,401
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

863
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:46,291
and other fugitives from justice.

864
01:17:46,373 --> 01:17:48,125
"Justice"? Hardly.

865
01:17:48,213 --> 01:17:53,765
Including the previous owner of this sword,
I believe.

866
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:58,804
Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will
be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass,

867
01:17:58,893 --> 01:18:02,681
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

868
01:18:02,773 --> 01:18:08,530
I find it distasteful to even contemplate
the horror facing all those on board.

869
01:18:11,693 --> 01:18:13,445
What do you want from me?

870
01:18:13,533 --> 01:18:16,570
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

871
01:18:16,653 --> 01:18:20,089
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

872
01:18:21,093 --> 01:18:23,527
To you, you mean.

873
01:18:27,013 --> 01:18:29,652
Shall I remove these shackles?

874
01:18:32,733 --> 01:18:36,009
Do what you can for my daughter.

875
01:18:42,013 --> 01:18:46,768
<i>(Beckett)</i> So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.

876
01:18:46,853 --> 01:18:50,562
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

877
01:18:56,013 --> 01:18:59,005
I wager... ten years.

878
01:18:59,853 --> 01:19:02,083
I'll match ten years.

879
01:19:03,053 --> 01:19:04,691
Agreed.

880
01:19:07,573 --> 01:19:10,212
Wondering how it's played?

881
01:19:10,293 --> 01:19:12,090
- I understand.
- Liar!

882
01:19:12,173 --> 01:19:17,531
<i>(Will)</i> It's a game of deception. But your bet
includes all the dice, not just your own.

883
01:19:17,893 --> 01:19:20,805
- What are they wagering?
- Oh, the only thing we have.

884
01:19:20,893 --> 01:19:23,168
Years of service.

885
01:19:25,213 --> 01:19:29,252
- So any crew member can be challenged?
- Aye. Anyone.

886
01:19:32,013 --> 01:19:34,652
I challenge Davy Jones.

887
01:19:36,653 --> 01:19:38,769
<i>(heavy footsteps)</i>

888
01:19:53,493 --> 01:19:56,326
I accept, mate.

889
01:20:07,413 --> 01:20:12,726
- The stakes?
- My soul. An eternity of servitude.

890
01:20:12,813 --> 01:20:14,929
No!

891
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:18,492
Against?

892
01:20:19,893 --> 01:20:21,804
I want this.

893
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:38,163
- How do you know of the key?
- That's not part of the game, is it?

894
01:20:41,213 --> 01:20:43,727
You can still walk away.

895
01:21:07,413 --> 01:21:10,371
- What's this?
- I'm in. Matching his wager.

896
01:21:10,453 --> 01:21:13,251
No! Don't do this.

897
01:21:15,093 --> 01:21:17,766
The die is cast.

898
01:21:17,853 --> 01:21:20,811
I bid three twos.

899
01:21:20,893 --> 01:21:22,963
It's your bid, Captain.

900
01:21:29,013 --> 01:21:31,891
Four fours.

901
01:21:40,613 --> 01:21:43,605
Four fives.

902
01:21:43,693 --> 01:21:45,331
Six threes.

903
01:21:54,613 --> 01:21:57,650
Seven fives.

904
01:22:20,573 --> 01:22:22,768
Eight fives.

905
01:22:27,293 --> 01:22:30,649
Welcome to the crew, lad.

906
01:22:32,733 --> 01:22:35,611
Twelve fives.

907
01:22:35,853 --> 01:22:37,445
Twelve fives.

908
01:22:37,533 --> 01:22:40,252
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

909
01:22:41,533 --> 01:22:44,969
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

910
01:22:48,293 --> 01:22:52,969
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship.

911
01:22:54,813 --> 01:22:58,852
Master Turner,
feel free to go ashore...

912
01:23:00,093 --> 01:23:03,085
the very next time we make port!

913
01:23:10,373 --> 01:23:13,763
Fool. Why did you do that?

914
01:23:15,253 --> 01:23:17,369
I couldn't let you lose.

915
01:23:17,453 --> 01:23:20,092
It was never about winning or losing.

916
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:23,772
The key.

917
01:23:25,373 --> 01:23:28,126
You just wanted to know where it was.

918
01:23:29,653 --> 01:23:31,564
<i>(snores)</i>

919
01:23:46,933 --> 01:23:49,447
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

920
01:23:53,293 --> 01:23:55,284
Captain's orders.

921
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:18,244
<i>(snores)</i>

922
01:24:28,493 --> 01:24:30,051
<i>(grunts)</i>

923
01:24:48,213 --> 01:24:49,362
<i>(plays note)</i>

924
01:24:53,093 --> 01:24:55,323
<i>(plays lullaby)</i>

925
01:25:40,613 --> 01:25:43,081
Here. Take this, too.

926
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:47,244
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.

927
01:25:47,693 --> 01:25:50,810
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

928
01:25:50,893 --> 01:25:53,805
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

929
01:25:58,373 --> 01:26:01,922
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

930
01:26:02,013 --> 01:26:07,963
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.

931
01:26:08,853 --> 01:26:13,005
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.

932
01:26:14,653 --> 01:26:17,213
You owe me nothing, Will.

933
01:26:17,293 --> 01:26:19,409
Now go.

934
01:26:20,493 --> 01:26:23,053
- They'll know you helped me.
- <i>(laughs)</i>

935
01:26:24,373 --> 01:26:26,284
What more can they do to me?

936
01:26:31,893 --> 01:26:34,043
I take this with a promise.

937
01:26:34,133 --> 01:26:36,442
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,

938
01:26:36,533 --> 01:26:40,242
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.

939
01:26:41,693 --> 01:26:43,923
I will not abandon you.

940
01:26:46,453 --> 01:26:48,921
I promise.

941
01:27:02,493 --> 01:27:04,529
- <i>(Gibbs)</i> Beckett?
- <i>(Elizabeth)</i> Yes, they're signed.

942
01:27:04,613 --> 01:27:07,047
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

943
01:27:07,133 --> 01:27:08,486
Bleurgh!

944
01:27:08,573 --> 01:27:12,168
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

945
01:27:12,533 --> 01:27:16,162
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.

946
01:27:16,253 --> 01:27:18,687
Of course.

947
01:27:18,773 --> 01:27:22,368
- He wants the chest.
- Yes, he did say something about a chest.

948
01:27:22,453 --> 01:27:25,923
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

949
01:27:26,013 --> 01:27:29,608
- A truly discomfiting notion, love.
- And bad.

950
01:27:29,693 --> 01:27:33,208
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

951
01:27:33,293 --> 01:27:36,410
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

952
01:27:36,493 --> 01:27:38,529
Brace the foreyard!

953
01:27:38,613 --> 01:27:41,685
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

954
01:27:41,773 --> 01:27:43,604
- Persuasion.
- Friendly?

955
01:27:43,693 --> 01:27:45,251
Decidedly not.

956
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:50,691
Will strikes a deal, yet you were the one
with the prize -full pardon.

957
01:27:50,773 --> 01:27:53,003
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England

958
01:27:53,093 --> 01:27:55,687
and the East India Trading Company."

959
01:27:55,773 --> 01:27:57,968
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

960
01:27:58,053 --> 01:28:00,442
- Jack, the letters, give them back.
- No.

961
01:28:00,533 --> 01:28:02,763
Persuade me.

962
01:28:02,853 --> 01:28:06,482
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

963
01:28:08,773 --> 01:28:12,322
As I said, persuade me.

964
01:28:26,013 --> 01:28:28,368
It's a curious thing.

965
01:28:29,413 --> 01:28:34,851
There was a time I would have wanted you
to look like that while thinking about me.

966
01:28:34,933 --> 01:28:37,003
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

967
01:28:37,093 --> 01:28:40,005
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

968
01:28:44,493 --> 01:28:46,688
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancÃ©

969
01:28:46,773 --> 01:28:50,652
ended up on the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>
in the first place?

970
01:29:14,133 --> 01:29:17,284
<i>(man)</i> Strange to come upon
a longboat so far out in open water.

971
01:29:17,373 --> 01:29:20,649
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

972
01:29:20,733 --> 01:29:23,725
And what are we running from?

973
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:31,006
That dress. Where did you get it?

974
01:29:31,093 --> 01:29:32,731
It was found aboard the ship.

975
01:29:32,813 --> 01:29:37,125
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

976
01:29:37,213 --> 01:29:40,489
- That's foolish.
- Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.

977
01:29:40,573 --> 01:29:46,330
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",

978
01:29:46,413 --> 01:29:48,324
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

979
01:29:48,413 --> 01:29:51,405
Off the books, of course.

980
01:29:51,493 --> 01:29:55,122
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

981
01:29:55,213 --> 01:29:57,966
- Why do you ask?
- Captain! A ship's been spotted.

982
01:29:58,053 --> 01:30:00,772
- Colors?
- She isn't flying any.

983
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:02,764
- Pirates.
- Or worse.

984
01:30:13,773 --> 01:30:17,209
You will watch this.

985
01:30:20,253 --> 01:30:21,971
Aagh!

986
01:30:24,053 --> 01:30:26,931
Let no joyful voice be heard!

987
01:30:28,973 --> 01:30:32,010
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.

988
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:33,765
Aargh!

989
01:30:34,213 --> 01:30:39,731
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake...

990
01:30:41,133 --> 01:30:43,203
the kraken.

991
01:30:43,613 --> 01:30:45,205
No!

992
01:31:01,413 --> 01:31:03,847
I've doomed us all.

993
01:31:04,293 --> 01:31:07,012
It's the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>!

994
01:31:07,093 --> 01:31:08,970
<i>(crash)</i>

995
01:31:11,733 --> 01:31:14,042
Oh, Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?

996
01:31:14,133 --> 01:31:16,567
Must have hit a reef.

997
01:31:23,893 --> 01:31:26,805
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then hard to starboard.

998
01:31:26,893 --> 01:31:30,249
- Free the rudder!
- Hard to port!

999
01:31:34,453 --> 01:31:37,126
<i>(man screams)</i>

1000
01:31:37,213 --> 01:31:40,569
- Kraken!
- Kraken!

1001
01:31:53,493 --> 01:31:56,326
Here it is! Take it!

1002
01:31:56,413 --> 01:31:58,324
Take it!

1003
01:31:59,413 --> 01:32:00,448
Aargh!

1004
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:07,009
Agh! Aaaagh!

1005
01:32:27,693 --> 01:32:29,604
<i>(screaming)</i>

1006
01:33:04,013 --> 01:33:05,651
Aagh!

1007
01:33:11,093 --> 01:33:13,004
Aaagh!

1008
01:34:04,853 --> 01:34:09,210
The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.

1009
01:34:09,293 --> 01:34:11,682
I am the sea.

1010
01:34:15,213 --> 01:34:18,330
You need time alone with your thoughts.

1011
01:34:18,413 --> 01:34:20,847
- Brig!
- What of the survivors?

1012
01:34:26,133 --> 01:34:29,364
There are no survivors.

1013
01:34:29,453 --> 01:34:31,728
<i>(grunts)</i>

1014
01:34:48,733 --> 01:34:52,442
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.

1015
01:34:52,533 --> 01:34:55,127
Get me there first,
or there'll be the devil to pay.

1016
01:34:55,213 --> 01:34:56,965
"First"?

1017
01:34:57,053 --> 01:35:00,125
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?

1018
01:35:00,213 --> 01:35:02,090
Who told him of the key?

1019
01:35:05,093 --> 01:35:07,163
Jack Sparrow.

1020
01:35:24,773 --> 01:35:31,292
My intuitive sense of the female creature
informs me that you are troubled.

1021
01:35:31,373 --> 01:35:34,649
I just thought I'd be married by now.

1022
01:35:34,733 --> 01:35:36,963
I'm so ready to be married.

1023
01:35:44,213 --> 01:35:46,169
You know...

1024
01:35:46,253 --> 01:35:47,652
<i>(clears throat)</i>

1025
01:35:47,733 --> 01:35:52,932
Lizzie, I am captain of a ship,

1026
01:35:53,013 --> 01:36:01,170
and being captain of a ship, I could in fact
perform a "marr-i-age" right here.

1027
01:36:01,253 --> 01:36:03,528
Right on this deck.

1028
01:36:03,613 --> 01:36:05,490
Right... now.

1029
01:36:08,973 --> 01:36:11,168
No, thank you.

1030
01:36:11,253 --> 01:36:12,732
Why not?

1031
01:36:12,813 --> 01:36:15,725
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.

1032
01:36:15,813 --> 01:36:20,682
Oh. Except for a sense of honor
and decency and a moral center.

1033
01:36:21,133 --> 01:36:23,442
And personal hygiene.

1034
01:36:24,853 --> 01:36:27,048
Trifles.

1035
01:36:27,133 --> 01:36:29,567
You will come over to my side. I know it.

1036
01:36:29,653 --> 01:36:34,727
- You seem very certain.
- One word, love. Curiosity.

1037
01:36:34,813 --> 01:36:36,371
You long for freedom.

1038
01:36:36,453 --> 01:36:39,411
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

1039
01:36:39,493 --> 01:36:42,451
To act on selfish impulse.

1040
01:36:42,533 --> 01:36:45,172
You want to see what it's like.

1041
01:36:45,253 --> 01:36:49,531
One day, you won't be able to resist.

1042
01:36:50,053 --> 01:36:52,521
Why doesn't your compass work?

1043
01:36:54,093 --> 01:36:57,051
My compass works fine.

1044
01:36:57,453 --> 01:36:59,171
Because you and I <i>are</i> alike,

1045
01:36:59,253 --> 01:37:02,370
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.

1046
01:37:02,453 --> 01:37:05,604
- To do the right thing.
- I love those moments.

1047
01:37:06,093 --> 01:37:08,288
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

1048
01:37:08,373 --> 01:37:13,731
You'll have the chance to do something...
something courageous.

1049
01:37:13,813 --> 01:37:16,850
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

1050
01:37:16,933 --> 01:37:19,401
That you're a good man.

1051
01:37:19,493 --> 01:37:21,882
All evidence to the contrary.

1052
01:37:21,973 --> 01:37:24,885
Oh, I have faith in you.

1053
01:37:24,973 --> 01:37:27,771
- Want to know why?
- Do tell, dearie.

1054
01:37:29,493 --> 01:37:32,371
Curiosity.

1055
01:37:32,453 --> 01:37:35,286
You're going to want it.

1056
01:37:35,373 --> 01:37:39,082
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

1057
01:37:40,373 --> 01:37:42,443
You won't be able to resist.

1058
01:37:43,773 --> 01:37:48,767
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.

1059
01:37:51,213 --> 01:37:54,091
I do want to know what it tastes like.

1060
01:37:54,173 --> 01:37:55,891
But... seeing as you're a good man,

1061
01:37:55,973 --> 01:38:00,205
I know that you'd never put me in a position
that would compromise my honor.

1062
01:38:08,173 --> 01:38:10,209
I'm proud of you, Jack.

1063
01:38:10,293 --> 01:38:13,012
<i>(Gibbs)</i> Land, ho!

1064
01:38:17,973 --> 01:38:19,725
I want my jar of dirt.

1065
01:38:21,133 --> 01:38:23,931
- You're pulling too fast.
- You're pulling too slow.

1066
01:38:24,013 --> 01:38:28,928
- We don't want the kraken to catch us.
- I'm saving me strength for when it comes.

1067
01:38:29,013 --> 01:38:33,245
And I don't think it's "kracken" anyways.
I always heard it said "krayken".

1068
01:38:33,333 --> 01:38:34,891
- With a long <i>a</i>?
- Uh-huh.

1069
01:38:34,973 --> 01:38:38,682
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Krocken"
is how it's pronounced in Scandinavian,

1070
01:38:38,773 --> 01:38:40,445
and "kracken" is closer to that.

1071
01:38:40,533 --> 01:38:43,843
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
"Krayken."

1072
01:38:43,933 --> 01:38:46,527
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.

1073
01:38:50,253 --> 01:38:52,403
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

1074
01:38:52,493 --> 01:38:54,723
Don't touch my dirt.

1075
01:39:29,133 --> 01:39:34,127
This doesn't work. And it certainly
doesn't show you what you want most.

1076
01:39:38,133 --> 01:39:41,330
<i>(Jack)</i> Yes, it does.
You're sitting on it.

1077
01:39:42,173 --> 01:39:43,811
- Beg pardon?
- Move.

1078
01:39:51,213 --> 01:39:53,886
- "Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!"
- I could join the circus.

1079
01:39:53,973 --> 01:39:55,531
Mind if I shine your shoes, sir?

1080
01:39:59,773 --> 01:40:04,289
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.

1081
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:06,284
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

1082
01:40:06,373 --> 01:40:09,604
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!

1083
01:40:11,133 --> 01:40:14,011
- Down, then!
- Down!

1084
01:40:35,533 --> 01:40:36,886
<i>(shouting)</i>

1085
01:41:18,413 --> 01:41:20,768
<i>(beating)</i>

1086
01:41:20,853 --> 01:41:22,844
It's real.

1087
01:41:23,773 --> 01:41:25,764
You actually were telling the truth.

1088
01:41:25,853 --> 01:41:29,243
I do that quite a lot,
yet people are always surprised.

1089
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:32,086
With good reason!

1090
01:41:32,173 --> 01:41:34,528
Will!

1091
01:41:34,613 --> 01:41:38,242
You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!

1092
01:41:44,053 --> 01:41:46,089
<i>(Jack)</i> How did you get here?

1093
01:41:46,173 --> 01:41:49,961
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

1094
01:41:50,053 --> 01:41:51,850
Not so easy, is it?

1095
01:41:51,933 --> 01:41:54,447
- But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
- You do?

1096
01:41:54,533 --> 01:41:58,526
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

1097
01:41:58,613 --> 01:42:00,569
- What?
- <i>(imitates Elizabeth)</i> What?

1098
01:42:01,133 --> 01:42:03,693
...I was reunited with my father.

1099
01:42:03,773 --> 01:42:06,367
Oh, well... you're welcome, then.

1100
01:42:06,853 --> 01:42:10,528
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

1101
01:42:10,613 --> 01:42:12,046
Pretty much.

1102
01:42:12,133 --> 01:42:14,408
Time and tide, love.

1103
01:42:14,493 --> 01:42:16,643
Oi! What are you doing?

1104
01:42:17,693 --> 01:42:19,968
I'm going to kill Jones.

1105
01:42:20,933 --> 01:42:23,128
Can't let you do that, William.

1106
01:42:23,213 --> 01:42:29,004
Cos if Jones is dead, who's to call
his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?

1107
01:42:34,813 --> 01:42:38,010
Now, if you please.

1108
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:41,087
The key.

1109
01:42:43,173 --> 01:42:45,767
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

1110
01:42:45,853 --> 01:42:49,050
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

1111
01:42:49,133 --> 01:42:52,603
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.

1112
01:42:52,693 --> 01:42:56,163
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

1113
01:42:56,973 --> 01:43:00,761
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.

1114
01:43:00,853 --> 01:43:03,845
I deliver it, I get my life back.

1115
01:43:04,253 --> 01:43:06,847
Ah. The dark side of ambition.

1116
01:43:07,253 --> 01:43:10,529
Oh, I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

1117
01:43:10,613 --> 01:43:11,568
Aagh!

1118
01:43:14,653 --> 01:43:16,132
<i>(Elizabeth)</i> Stop it!

1119
01:43:16,213 --> 01:43:18,044
Hyah!

1120
01:43:22,573 --> 01:43:24,006
<i>(Elizabeth)</i> Will!

1121
01:43:24,973 --> 01:43:27,965
- Guard the chest!
- No!

1122
01:43:28,053 --> 01:43:32,729
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to...

1123
01:43:32,813 --> 01:43:38,126
Oh, fine! Let's just haul out our swords
and start banging away at each other.

1124
01:43:38,213 --> 01:43:40,727
That will solve everything! I've had it!

1125
01:43:40,813 --> 01:43:45,568
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

1126
01:43:48,093 --> 01:43:53,042
- How'd this go all screwy?
- Well, each wants the chest for hisself.

1127
01:43:53,133 --> 01:43:56,170
Mr. Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honor,

1128
01:43:56,253 --> 01:43:58,642
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin,

1129
01:43:58,733 --> 01:44:02,726
then Turner, there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business

1130
01:44:02,813 --> 01:44:06,283
'twixt him and his
twice-cursed pirate father. <i>(belches)</i>

1131
01:44:06,373 --> 01:44:08,250
- Sad.
- <i>(Elizabeth)</i> This is madness!

1132
01:44:08,333 --> 01:44:11,962
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.

1133
01:44:12,053 --> 01:44:13,884
Terrible temptation.

1134
01:44:13,973 --> 01:44:19,730
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.

1135
01:44:25,173 --> 01:44:26,925
Enough!

1136
01:44:30,253 --> 01:44:32,926
Oh. Oh!

1137
01:44:33,013 --> 01:44:35,481
The heat!

1138
01:44:53,773 --> 01:44:55,764
Bugger!

1139
01:45:07,413 --> 01:45:09,802
By your leave, Mr. Turner.

1140
01:45:14,733 --> 01:45:16,644

1141
01:45:50,013 --> 01:45:51,332

Do excuse me

01:46:50,693 --> 01:46:54,572
- Be my guest.
- Let us examine that claim for a moment.

1146
01:46:54,973 --> 01:47:00,206
Who was it, that at the very moment you
had a notorious pirate safely behind bars,

1147
01:47:00,293 --> 01:47:06,323
saw fit to free said pirate and
take your dearly beloved all to hisself?

1148
01:47:06,413 --> 01:47:07,812
Eh?

1149
01:47:07,893 --> 01:47:10,361
So whose fault is it, really,

1150
01:47:10,453 --> 01:47:14,651
that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand
what takes orders from pirates?

1151
01:47:14,733 --> 01:47:16,644
Enough!

1152
01:47:18,813 --> 01:47:22,442
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!

1153
01:47:24,333 --> 01:47:26,164
Still rooting for you, mate.

1154
01:47:32,493 --> 01:47:34,563
Oh! Oof!

01:48:01,653 --> 01:48:03,803

01:56:11,373 --> 01:56:14,410
Brace up the foreyard!

1209
01:56:17,413 --> 01:56:19,369
Hard to starboard!

1210
01:56:19,453 --> 01:56:24,163
Send his beloved <i>Pearl</i>
back to the depths.

1211
01:56:35,733 --> 01:56:39,442
She's on us! She's on us!

1212
01:56:40,973 --> 01:56:44,886
- Let them taste the triple guns.
- Aye, Captain.

1213
01:56:56,133 --> 01:56:58,089
Aaargh!

1214
01:57:09,693 --> 01:57:11,172
Make fast!

1215
01:57:12,373 --> 01:57:14,807
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!

1216
01:57:14,893 --> 01:57:17,532
Come on, girl!

1217
01:57:23,333 --> 01:57:25,642
- She's falling behind!
- Aye. We've got her!

1218
01:57:25,733 --> 01:57:29,282
- We're the faster?
- Against the wind, the <i>Dutchman</i> beats us.

1219
01:57:29,373 --> 01:57:31,728
- But with the wind...
- We rob her advantage.

1220
01:57:31,813 --> 01:57:33,565
Aye.

1221
01:57:35,533 --> 01:57:37,012
We're out of range!

1222
01:57:37,093 --> 01:57:41,530
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!

1223
01:57:41,613 --> 01:57:43,888
We're giving up, sir?

1224
01:57:48,093 --> 01:57:50,004
Agh!

1225
01:57:53,573 --> 01:57:55,768
They're giving up!

1226
01:57:55,853 --> 01:57:57,650
<i>(cheering)</i>

1227
01:58:01,613 --> 01:58:03,649
My father is on that ship.

1228
01:58:03,733 --> 01:58:06,122
We can take her.
We should turn and fight.

1229
01:58:06,213 --> 01:58:12,891
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.

1230
01:58:13,493 --> 01:58:14,482
Oh!

1231
01:58:16,333 --> 01:58:18,244
<i>(whimpers)</i>

1232
01:58:22,573 --> 01:58:25,246
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?

1233
01:58:26,573 --> 01:58:29,406
We must have hit a reef!

1234
01:58:31,413 --> 01:58:35,292
No. It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!

1235
01:58:35,373 --> 01:58:38,285
- What is it?
- The kraken.

1236
01:58:38,653 --> 01:58:40,803
- To arms!
- Load guns! Defend the mast!

1237
01:58:40,893 --> 01:58:45,171
It'll attack the starboard. Run out
the cannons and hold for my signal!

1238
01:59:17,373 --> 01:59:19,728
Easy, boys!

1239
01:59:22,973 --> 01:59:23,962
Will?

1240
01:59:24,453 --> 01:59:26,569
Steady! Steady.

1241
01:59:28,453 --> 01:59:31,763
- Will!
- Hold. Hold.

1242
01:59:31,853 --> 01:59:34,731
I think we've held fire long enough.

1243
01:59:35,893 --> 01:59:38,168
- Will!
- Fire!

1244
01:59:42,013 --> 01:59:43,366
Oh!

1245
01:59:53,373 --> 01:59:54,931
<i>(cheering)</i>

1246
01:59:57,453 --> 02:00:00,843
- It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
- There's no boats.

1247
02:00:08,733 --> 02:00:13,124
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

1248
02:00:15,373 --> 02:00:19,651
- Whatever you do, don't miss.
- As soon as you're clear.

1249
02:00:33,253 --> 02:00:37,212
We are short-stocked on gunpowder!
Six barrels!

1250
02:00:38,173 --> 02:00:40,209
Hurry up!

1251
02:00:40,293 --> 02:00:43,729
- There's only six kegs of powder!
- Then load the rum.

1252
02:00:52,253 --> 02:00:54,972
Aye, the rum too!

1253
02:01:22,013 --> 02:01:23,924
Step to!

1254
02:01:27,453 --> 02:01:29,921
Oh, you coward.

1255
02:01:30,013 --> 02:01:31,571
<i>(thud)</i>

1256
02:01:34,573 --> 02:01:36,529
Not good.

1257
02:01:44,093 --> 02:01:46,687
- Haul away!
- Heave!

1258
02:01:46,773 --> 02:01:50,925
- Heave like you're being paid for it!
- Put your backs into it!

1259
02:01:58,493 --> 02:02:00,768
<i>(screaming)</i>

1260
02:02:06,693 --> 02:02:08,649
Aargh!

1261
02:02:08,733 --> 02:02:10,564
<i>(whimpers)</i>

1262
02:02:32,253 --> 02:02:35,370
- I got you! I got you!
- Don't let me go!

1263
02:02:35,453 --> 02:02:38,013
- I won't let you go!
- Shoot me!

1264
02:02:43,093 --> 02:02:46,005
- Clear?
- Higher! Higher!

1265
02:03:02,173 --> 02:03:04,209
Here! Come on!

1266
02:03:04,853 --> 02:03:07,367
Come and get me. I'm over here!

1267
02:03:07,453 --> 02:03:09,444
Come on!

1268
02:03:33,373 --> 02:03:36,490
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!

1269
02:03:41,533 --> 02:03:43,410
<i>(screams)</i>

1270
02:04:36,093 --> 02:04:38,288
<i>(kraken bellows)</i>

1271
02:05:00,213 --> 02:05:02,044
Did we kill it?

1272
02:05:02,133 --> 02:05:05,603
No. We just made it angry.

1273
02:05:05,973 --> 02:05:08,806
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

1274
02:05:10,653 --> 02:05:13,247
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

1275
02:05:15,413 --> 02:05:18,166
Jack. The <i>Pearl</i>.

1276
02:05:19,373 --> 02:05:21,648
She's only a ship, mate.

1277
02:05:21,733 --> 02:05:24,167
He's right.
We have to head for land.

1278
02:05:24,253 --> 02:05:27,211
- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

1279
02:05:27,293 --> 02:05:31,730
We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the <i>Pearl</i>.

1280
02:05:33,573 --> 02:05:35,325
Abandon ship.

1281
02:05:35,413 --> 02:05:37,722
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

1282
02:05:53,773 --> 02:05:55,843
Thank you, Jack.

1283
02:05:57,853 --> 02:06:00,492
We're not free yet, love.

1284
02:06:00,573 --> 02:06:02,643
You came back.

1285
02:06:05,093 --> 02:06:07,687
I always knew you were a good man.

1286
02:06:20,133 --> 02:06:22,806
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

1287
02:06:22,893 --> 02:06:25,248
Come on, Will. Step to!

1288
02:06:31,253 --> 02:06:33,164
<i>(chains clink)</i>

1289
02:06:43,573 --> 02:06:45,928
It's after you, not the ship.

1290
02:06:46,013 --> 02:06:48,811
It's not us.

1291
02:06:48,893 --> 02:06:51,566
This is the only way, don't you see?

1292
02:06:54,733 --> 02:06:56,803
I'm not sorry.

1293
02:07:02,133 --> 02:07:04,044
Pirate.

1294
02:07:22,653 --> 02:07:24,769
Where's Jack?

1295
02:07:28,213 --> 02:07:32,001
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

1296
02:07:40,333 --> 02:07:42,085
Go!

1297
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:57,609
Bugger. Bugger, bugger,
bugger, bugger, bugger!

1298
02:08:24,733 --> 02:08:26,769
Come on!

1299
02:08:30,853 --> 02:08:33,492
Just got it. Come on.

1300
02:08:45,253 --> 02:08:46,766
<i>(roars)</i>

1301
02:09:01,373 --> 02:09:03,728
Not so bad.

1302
02:09:05,053 --> 02:09:06,088
Oh.

1303
02:09:14,573 --> 02:09:16,325
Hello, beastie.

1304
02:10:03,173 --> 02:10:07,212
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

1305
02:10:08,493 --> 02:10:10,643
The captain goes down with his ship.

1306
02:10:10,733 --> 02:10:14,567
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

1307
02:10:19,653 --> 02:10:22,121
Open the chest.

1308
02:10:23,213 --> 02:10:25,647
Open the chest. I need to see it!

1309
02:10:40,613 --> 02:10:46,370
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

1310
02:10:51,933 --> 02:10:54,572
<i>(Mercer)</i> The last of our ships is returned.

1311
02:10:54,653 --> 02:10:56,962
Is there any news on the chest?

1312
02:10:57,053 --> 02:11:02,446
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

1313
02:11:02,533 --> 02:11:04,603
He had these.

1314
02:11:11,293 --> 02:11:14,330
I took the liberty of filling in my name.

1315
02:11:21,573 --> 02:11:25,486
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.

1316
02:11:25,573 --> 02:11:28,087
Do you have the compass?

1317
02:11:28,173 --> 02:11:29,925
Better.

1318
02:11:32,693 --> 02:11:34,604
<i>(beating)</i>

1319
02:11:36,813 --> 02:11:39,247
The heart of Davy Jones.

1320
02:12:32,413 --> 02:12:34,768
Against the cold...

1321
02:12:34,853 --> 02:12:37,083
and the sorrow.

1322
02:12:46,933 --> 02:12:49,401
It's a shame.

1323
02:12:49,493 --> 02:12:51,848
I know you're thinking that with the <i>Pearl</i>

1324
02:12:51,933 --> 02:12:57,087
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

1325
02:12:57,173 --> 02:12:59,812
Doesn't matter now.

1326
02:12:59,893 --> 02:13:02,361
The <i>Pearl</i> is gone,

1327
02:13:02,453 --> 02:13:04,330
along with its captain.

1328
02:13:04,413 --> 02:13:06,529
<i>(Gibbs)</i> Aye.

1329
02:13:06,613 --> 02:13:10,367
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

1330
02:13:10,453 --> 02:13:13,445
He fooled us all right till the end,

1331
02:13:13,533 --> 02:13:17,128
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

1332
02:13:19,893 --> 02:13:21,565
To Jack Sparrow.

1333
02:13:21,653 --> 02:13:26,443
- Never another like Captain Jack.
- He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

1334
02:13:27,013 --> 02:13:29,004
He was a good man.

1335
02:13:48,853 --> 02:13:52,766
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

1336
02:13:54,093 --> 02:13:56,323
- Elizabeth.
- Would you do it?

1337
02:13:56,413 --> 02:13:57,641
Hm?

1338
02:13:58,853 --> 02:14:01,048
What would you...

1339
02:14:01,133 --> 02:14:02,725
Hm?

1340
02:14:04,413 --> 02:14:08,167
What would any of you
be willing to do, hm?

1341
02:14:09,293 --> 02:14:13,047
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond

1342
02:14:13,133 --> 02:14:18,002
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious <i>Pearl</i>?

1343
02:14:23,893 --> 02:14:25,087
Aye.

1344
02:14:26,133 --> 02:14:27,407
Aye.

1345
02:14:28,013 --> 02:14:29,162
Aye.

1346
02:14:29,813 --> 02:14:31,451
<i>(parrot squawks)</i> Aye.

1347
02:14:34,333 --> 02:14:36,324
Yes.

1348
02:14:38,493 --> 02:14:39,687
Aye.

1349
02:14:39,773 --> 02:14:41,684
All right.

1350
02:14:42,693 --> 02:14:49,451
But if you go and brave the weird
and haunted shores at world's end...

1351
02:14:50,493 --> 02:14:56,523
then you will need a captain
who knows those waters.

1352
02:15:10,813 --> 02:15:14,806
So tell me,
what's become of my ship?

1353
02:23:59,333 --> 02:24:01,244
<i>(drumming)</i>
