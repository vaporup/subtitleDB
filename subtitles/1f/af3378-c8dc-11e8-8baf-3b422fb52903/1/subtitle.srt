1
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:22,424
Alright it's the final match of the
season ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:26,584
And as we approach the finish, it's still not clear
which team is going to lift the champions cup...

3
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:30,323
Two minutes to go... and the
score stands at 1 all...

4
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,260
The Rangers have the ball and are dribbling
through... Is this going to be a goal?

5
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,700
But just as I say that, Dev Saran
has intercepted them...

6
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,604
...and has possession.
My God! Look at him go...

7
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:45,110
He's moving closer and closerto the goal...

8
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:49,440
Just look at him go.
Dev Saran looks determined...

9
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:50,949
Is this going to be the decider?

10
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:54,282
Oh my God! He's underthe D...
he's through... he's through them all...

11
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,799
Is that going to be a penalty?
That definitely should be a penalty...

12
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:09,301
If that's a penalty... the Rangers probably just
threw the game away...

13
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:59,281
Good morning Sir. The limousine is
ready forthe wedding.

14
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,353
What wedding?

15
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,788
Your wedding, Sir...

16
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,193
Shit! Maya's going to kill me...

17
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,694
Maya... Maya... come on hurry up...
The groom will be here at one...

18
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,783
Yes... I'm married... and I have a son...

19
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:31,211
And just to make it clear...
I keep my personal life...

20
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,548
...and professional life separate...

21
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:35,121
That's all very well Mrs. Saran...

22
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,725
But ourfashion magazine needs a lot of time...

23
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:42,394
Your magazine does not need time... It needs me!

24
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,408
Yes? - Who are you?

25
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:04,370
Whoeveryou want me to be, honey...

26
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:07,046
Dad! Dad!

27
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,647
Hey... - Dude... What are you doing?

28
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:18,223
Sorry son... Just a little... tied up...

29
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:22,159
Oh God... da... And how did this break?

30
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:28,264
I'll teach you how... I will... hello darling...

31
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:33,670
I'm leaving Sam... and forthe record
that was the best ever...

32
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:35,002
Oh thanks...

33
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:43,085
I'll call you... - Yeah... call me... call me...
Bye sweetheart...

34
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:48,783
Amazing isn't it, when a call girl calls you...
call girl... calls you...

35
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,188
Dad! I'm getting married today and you...

36
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:53,922
What do I do, my son?

37
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,028
Before dying your Mom made me
promise that after she goes...

38
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,367
...I should do all that I never did
while she was alive...

39
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,765
I'm just fulfilling my promise...

40
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:05,202
And what about the promise I made to Maya?
Can I fulfill that?

41
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:06,534
Of course... Why not? - Can we go?

42
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:09,040
Just a minute... just a minute...

43
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,706
This is from me...

44
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:18,051
And this from your Mom... God bless you...

45
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:24,385
Hello... - Dev... I got the job...

46
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:28,154
What? - I got the job!!

47
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,889
Wow... That's amazing... You got the job...

48
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:34,903
Guys... Rhea got the job...

49
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,969
What is this noise? I can't hear a thing...

50
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:44,736
Nothing... Nothing at all...
Just a small match that we won...

51
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:48,747
Oh yeah! The match... of course...
I'm so sorry... I forgot completely...

52
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:51,912
Rhea, I'm your husband...
just don't forget that...

53
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:56,419
Shut up, Dev... And congratulations baby...
Tell me how was it?

54
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:00,193
Fantastic... My last goal...
All that tension... excitement...

55
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,929
God... Rhea... Rhea, you should have been here...

56
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,599
Yeah... I know...
But I had an interview...

57
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:10,932
I know sweetheart...
I know... You know what...

58
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:14,435
We'll fix up the next match after
checking with your busy schedule...

59
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:15,110
Dev...

60
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:17,377
And if you have the time just have a look...

61
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,773
...at my five million dollar contract...

62
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:21,607
Five million dollars?

63
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:25,116
Why? Jealous?
That now I earn more than you?

64
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:29,223
Not jealous baby... Happy...
Happy that your dream has come true...

65
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:31,460
Our dream, Rhea...

66
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:35,956
Yeah I know... By the way I'm going to fetch
Arjun from school...

67
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:38,063
Will you please fetch Mom
from the wedding?

68
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,900
God... I completely forgot that...

69
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,229
What's the matter, Rhea?
You seem to be forgetting a lot these days...

70
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:46,135
Yeah! That's true...
And by the way, Happy Anniversary!

71
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:52,478
Shit... Happy Anniversary!

72
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:06,491
Hey guys... My son's getting married...
My son's getting married...

73
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:14,165
Today I'm going to part with my daughter
and get a daughter-in-law home...

74
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:16,596
Hey Maya... We are coming...

75
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,497
I'm the happiest guy in the wor...
Hey, what's with you?

76
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:22,841
Dude... I'm nervous... - Why?

77
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:25,846
It's taken herthree years to say 'yes'...

78
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:27,675
She won't run away at the last minute,
will she?

79
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:29,851
No... No...
She can't run away anywhere...

80
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:33,184
Yeah... After all where will she
find a husband like me, right?

81
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:35,357
No... Our security is very tight...

82
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:38,356
Move it... Move it...
We are already running late...

83
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:41,356
Oh my God! Chris...
Why are you serving this now?

84
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:44,692
This is not a dip... It's dessert...
It's called suji ka halwa...

85
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,028
Who Suzie? - Not Suzie...
Give it to me... come on... Go...

86
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:49,135
Go into the kitchen...

87
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,869
They'll drive me mad...
All the idiots from New York...

88
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,810
God... That scared me...
- Didn't mean to...

89
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:03,479
Hello... - Hello...

90
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,217
I'm Sam... And this is my house...

91
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:08,549
I'm Kamal, and this is my food...

92
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,720
Really... may I?

93
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:16,398
Wow... Definitely a sardarni...

94
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:18,229
How did you know that?

95
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:20,561
Because I have been fed
and slapped by them...

96
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,405
I know...
I have heard a lot about you...

97
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:26,234
Don't go by what others say...

98
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:28,740
But all that's said is always
by others, Mr. Talwar...

99
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:31,071
Whose word does one go by then?

100
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,649
Mine... My word...
You are from chandigarh...

101
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,582
And how did you figure that out?

102
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:45,260
Definitely chandigarh...

103
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,825
Mom... What are you doing?

104
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,762
Just... Nothing...

105
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:53,764
Ready to go?

106
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:56,597
No... I don't know what's
taking the bride so long...

107
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:58,000
You carry on... I'll come on my own...

108
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:01,368
Are you sure?
- Yeah... You go...

109
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,288
Excuse me... excuse me...
Please don't mess the garden...

110
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,787
I have just cleaned it up...

111
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,784
Are you the gardener?
- What do you think?

112
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:22,122
I think you have stolen the bride's clothes...
Should I inform inside?

113
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,865
Could you please leave me alone?
- Of course... not...

114
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:28,795
It's your wedding and you are
sitting outside here... Why?

115
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:29,971
Do you have a problem?

116
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:33,869
Not directly... But indirectly I do...
My mother has a problem...

117
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:37,873
The fasteryou go inside,
the faster my mother can leave from here...

118
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,478
You are a strange man...
You sat down?

119
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,374
Should I lie down and chat?

120
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:45,654
One to one discussions always
happen sitting down... - Discussion?

121
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:47,880
Yes... I know you have a problem...

122
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,317
come on... Talk to me...
Tell me your problem...

123
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:52,323
Why should I discuss
my problem with you?

124
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:54,155
So you admit you have a problem...

125
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:59,096
By the way, I don't take advice from anyone...

126
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,565
...but I'm always ready
to give advice to others...

127
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:05,170
You should always listen to strangers...

128
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:10,072
Sometimes they know betterthan our own...

129
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,948
Are you married?

130
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:20,849
Einstein... It's five years today...

131
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:23,188
What did you think before marrying?

132
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,518
Who thinks before marrying?

133
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,304
Just kidding...
Rhea and me, are friends from college...

134
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:40,034
So we thought we'd give our
friendship a new meaning...

135
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:43,837
...besides what can be betterthan spending...

136
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:46,476
...your entire life with yourfriend?

137
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:54,480
At times friendship replaces love and
then there's no space left for love...

138
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,883
Yeah... yeah...

139
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:01,730
By the way, the guy waiting foryou inside...

140
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:05,059
...is he yourfriend oryour love?

141
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:10,233
You can't take that long...

142
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,569
I have known Rishi since childhood...

143
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:18,575
After my parents died, Rishi
and his father have been my family...

144
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:21,249
Oh... What a sweet family...

145
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:24,912
But that's not the answerto my question...
Do you love him?

146
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:33,918
I do...
But not the way I thought I would...

147
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,099
Like how? Like in good books and bad films?
That kind of love?

148
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:44,028
No... The way love ought to be...
That kind of love...

149
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,107
That kind of love...
But where does it exist anymore?

150
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,777
Listen to this...

151
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:54,675
'The sagas of everlasting romances
have gone past long ago...

152
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,780
Just learn to make do
with tiny love stories...'

153
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:05,786
Does that mean you don't love your wife?

154
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,300
You can't take that long...

155
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:20,369
We are happy...
We have made our little world together...

156
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:22,301
That's not the answerto my question...

157
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,716
The question here is more
about your life than my answer...

158
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:32,476
You are at a crossroad in life
where there are two roads...

159
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:38,057
One that leads to happiness,
which I think you deserve...

160
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:40,491
...and the otherthat leads
to an endless wait...

161
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:44,393
Wait for love...
Which you may neverfind...

162
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:48,496
What if I find that love after marriage?

163
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,838
If you don't look for it...
you won't find it...

164
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,273
And you are definitely not finding
it sitting on this bench...

165
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:01,073
Go inside and get married...

166
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,511
The wedding is waiting foryou...

167
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:05,516
...and here you are sitting
with a stranger making small talk...

168
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:06,688
You should be ashamed...
What will people say?

169
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,517
Shame on you... Go on... go...
go and get married... Go...

170
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:11,022
It was nice talking to you...

171
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:15,195
Well... I'd rather be playing football...

172
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:17,763
But it was a pleasure to meet you, Ma'am...

173
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:19,693
Maya...

174
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:25,435
Dev... Dev Anand... bad one...
Now go fast, get married and be happy...

175
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:27,871
Good bye... Sayonara... Goodbye...

176
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:32,878
Not good bye...
Goodbye kills the hope of meeting again...

177
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:35,307
And who knows?
We may meet again...

178
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:50,689
[Skipped item nr. 178]

179
00:15:56,505 --> 00:16:02,410
Just like fragrance merges into breeze...

180
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:08,880
And fades away...

181
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:15,189
Intense moments, with time...

182
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:24,595
Have a way of seeming like dreams...

183
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,497
Who knows? We may meet again yet...

184
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:36,909
You should never say goodbye...

185
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:42,846
Never say goodbye...

186
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:49,255
Never say goodbye...

187
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:56,958
Never say goodbye...

188
00:17:57,893 --> 00:18:01,192
They say time heals all wounds...

189
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:11,705
But in some relationships,
some wounds only get deeper with time...

190
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,400
Do you guys have a permit forthis? Damn...

191
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:48,075
Ready? Black Beast...
That's the new fearthat stalks New York...

192
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:51,246
Known as the Black Beast,
this dangerous criminal has kidnapped...

193
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:52,572
...yet another child from central Park...

194
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:55,079
No one knows if it is a man or a woman...

195
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:56,410
He's nicknamed Black Beast...

196
00:18:56,618 --> 00:19:00,076
...because the criminal wears
a trademark long, black coat...

197
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:04,759
Shit...

198
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:10,590
Don't cry my son...
don't cry... I'm right here...

199
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,597
What the... What are you doing?
Sitting on my leg...

200
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:17,431
Sorry sir... Please don't mind...
My Tinu here is just a little nervous...

201
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:19,607
...he thinks the Black Beast
is going to kidnap him...

202
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:20,433
Please don't mind sir... please...

203
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,769
Why should I mind?
My leg's already broken...

204
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:25,606
Oh Tinu... my small, fat little angel...

205
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:27,338
...the Black Beast will not kidnap you...

206
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,608
To kidnap you he has to lift you first...

207
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:31,445
And have you looked at your weight?

208
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:35,783
My little fatso... Your son's not a child...
he is a pig... pig!

209
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:36,457
What?

210
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:39,889
...and with God's blessing
even if he manages to lift him...

211
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,289
...he will die of a heart attack...

212
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:43,464
Mummy! - Mummy!
You mean she's still alive?

213
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:44,962
How did she survive
the weight of yourfather?

214
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:47,533
How rude! - Rude?
You football field!

215
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:48,727
Just pick this football of yours
and leave right now...

216
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:49,861
come on... let's go...
we don't want to sit here...

217
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,495
come on go...
You should have asked before sitting...

218
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,666
And by the way, does your entire family
everfit in a single photograph?

219
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,307
Should we go?

220
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,974
You know I'll leave when you want to...
What's the need to ask?

221
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,979
God... Dev...
Ijust asked a simple question...

222
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:06,154
God... Rhea...
Even I didn't answer in French...

223
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:07,146
I'm going home...

224
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:09,381
Good... very good...
Do you know the way home?

225
00:20:09,591 --> 00:20:12,560
Yes Dev... I know the way...
Ijust don't know you anymore...

226
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:17,396
It's strange... No one seems to have a
sense of humourthis morning...

227
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,659
come on... let's go... together...

228
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:29,174
Maya... Maya... Maya... MAYA!

229
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:32,509
What is it?
- The house will collapse if you clean

230
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:33,844
Rishi...

231
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:37,742
What? - Take off your pants...

232
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,017
Take off what? - Your pants...

233
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:42,753
Here? - Where then?

234
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:44,525
But why? - Why?

235
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:47,521
I know why... Oh my God...

236
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:49,026
come on, Rishi... Quickly...
I don't have time...

237
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:52,291
I know...
I've always wanted to do this in the kitchen...

238
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,026
It's been a dream...
- Yeah... Mine too...

239
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,033
Wow! - Fast...

240
00:20:58,407 --> 00:20:59,032
Hello...

241
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:01,205
Now it's yourturn... - Why?

242
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:03,635
Why? Then how are we...?
Lt'll be kind of tough...

243
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,279
Rishi...
I don't have to remove anything...

244
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,881
...because my clothes have no stain...

245
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:09,776
Stain?

246
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:14,116
Yes... Stain... A big one...
And you were all set to go out with it...

247
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:15,046
Maya...

248
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,989
When will you stop being my
mother and be my wife?

249
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,229
When you stop being my child and
become my husband...

250
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:27,395
If I stop being your child
who will you motherthen?

251
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:30,901
What happened?

252
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:34,042
Nothing...
Since I can't have children of my own...

253
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,073
...I should think of you as my child, right?

254
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:39,171
Oh come on, Maya...
You know that's not what I meant...

255
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,578
I really don't care about that...
- Here... Take this... It's gone...

256
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,580
Thank you...

257
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:48,081
Listen...
Tonight's the Sanderson Hotel opening...

258
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,258
What time do you want to go?
- I'm not coming...

259
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:55,089
Maya... If I go alone everywhere people
will think there's a problem...

260
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:58,095
I don't care about people...
- And me?

261
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:04,602
Look, Rishi...
This night life, events, parties...

262
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,037
I don't belong to that part of your life...

263
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:10,110
Then which part of my life
do you belong to, Maya?

264
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:12,041
Which part of my life
do you belong to, Rishi?

265
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:16,045
When was the last time we did
something that I wanted?

266
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,177
You want to clean the house...

267
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,445
And that really isn't my idea of an
ideal weekend babe...

268
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:22,452
Then babe... What's your idea?

269
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:24,955
Actually my ideal weekend
would involve a lot of...

270
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,957
Ok... come... let's discuss it...

271
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:29,960
Whoa... Discussion... No... No... bye!
- Why? - No...

272
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:33,965
This is great! You start something
and then don't want to pursue it...

273
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:38,796
Rishi, I want to discuss...
Rishi... Rishi!

274
00:22:42,677 --> 00:22:43,974
You are such a child!

275
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,478
Maya!

276
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,060
Congratulations, Rhea...
- For what?

277
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:01,659
The figures just came in...

278
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:04,991
Diva is America's No.2 fashion magazine...
Thanks to you...

279
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,997
come on, Rhea... let's celebrate...

280
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:13,673
Hold on guys... One minute... One minute...
there will be no celebrations...

281
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:17,670
We will celebrate when DIVA
becomes the No.1 fashion magazine...

282
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,176
So pull up your stockings ladies...

283
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:21,576
'cos you have more late nights...
more hard work...

284
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:23,445
And if your husbands leave you...

285
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:25,345
Trust me, you are better off...

286
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:27,522
...back to work!

287
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:29,587
Hey, Rhea... Wait up...

288
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:33,591
Ijust spoke to the London head office and
we think you should move there... - Really?

289
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:37,695
Yeah... So that you can control all the fashion
magazines in the group...

290
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,864
But isn't this all a bit too...

291
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:42,203
Rhea... Rhea... Rhea... Do you even
understand the meaning of all this?

292
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:44,372
This will be the biggest move
of your career...

293
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,370
No, Jai... This will be a big move
foryour company...

294
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:51,602
You know what?
You are something else...

295
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,878
You are intelligent, confident, beautiful...

296
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,550
Just one problem... You are married...

297
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:04,556
But anyway married or unmarried...
How does it matterthese days... Right?

298
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:06,223
It matters to me, Jai...

299
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:10,729
What is he doing here?

300
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:14,061
When I have said that we are not
organizing the party, why is he here?

301
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:15,395
But Rishi, what can I do?

302
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,402
He refuses to leave...
He says he won't go till we agree...

303
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:20,404
What do you mean he won't leave?
- He's even threatening to sue us...

304
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:22,076
Sue... Who is he to...?

305
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:25,242
Excuse me... Excuse me...

306
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:26,904
Yes...

307
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:31,910
Dude... I have already told you, I'm not
organizing this party...

308
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,089
But why?
You organize parties forthe whole world...

309
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,257
Why can't you do it foryourfather?

310
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,255
The whole world hasn't had two heart attacks...

311
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,252
Give some thought to your age...

312
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:42,430
What's age?
Just look at my heart...

313
00:24:42,797 --> 00:24:44,765
Ask the beauties around...
they think I'm a rockstar!

314
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:48,333
Dad! Before you embarrass
me any further, please go...

315
00:24:48,637 --> 00:24:51,265
Hey... Listen...
Why are you being so difficult?

316
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:54,101
It's just a simple party to be organized...

317
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:59,941
Just give me a sixties setting, the best wine
and a hundred beautiful girls... That's all...

318
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,342
And what do you plan to do
with hundred girls?

319
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:07,951
What? - Right... - Yeah!

320
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:11,690
I want to know...
Why do you throw this party every year?

321
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,454
Now look... That is not your problem...

322
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:18,859
Just organize this party and
my red Ferrari is yours...

323
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:25,467
Dude... If you think you can
buy me out by bribing me...

324
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,139
You are absolutely right...
I love that car... - Yeah!

325
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,812
What do you want the girls to wear?
- Nothing! - Done...

326
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:45,148
Good morning... soccer moms
and soccer dads... get ready...

327
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,320
Ourfirst team today are the seven time
winners from Westside High...

coached by George Push...
with a lovely tusch...

330
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:08,182
Playing against the Tigers are the...

331
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:11,841

coached by Dev Saran...

333
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:18,919
What's wrong?
Your wife's still paying the bills?

334
00:26:19,227 --> 00:26:20,956
No... Now yours is...

335
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,525
The match is about to begin...

336
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:05,672
Where are you going, idiot?
Go... - No... - Yes...

337
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:29,025
Hit... Arjun... Hit...

338
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:39,104
Yes...

339
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:54,284
Your ball...

340
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:56,552
Happy?

341
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:11,062
I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Papa... I'm sorry...

342
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,298
I don't want to play football...
I want to play the violin...

343
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:16,136
What? You want to play the violin?

344
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,302
Wear a dress from tomorrow...

345
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,640
You will look perfect... Don't do that...
Just shut up...

346
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,652
Hi... Hi, Your Highness...
Your son has lost the match again...

347
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:28,484
Looks like he's taken after his father...
Let's celebrate...

348
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,215
Dev... Please...
Stop taking your anger out on him...

349
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,660
He'd probably have won
if you coached him well...

350
00:28:33,928 --> 00:28:37,329
We'd probably have won if you
were here to boost our morale...

351
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:39,492
can I speak to him please?

352
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:44,328
Yeah of course... It's the Queen Motherforyou...
come on... come on...

353
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:48,667
Mama... You have to be there forthe
next match... You never come...

354
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:51,345
Yes sweetheart...
Next time I'll be there for sure...

355
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:54,276
Guess what?
Mama's got you a new playstation...

356
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,916
Play station? Wow... I love you Mom...

357
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,680
Wow, Mom... I love you... Playstation?

358
00:28:59,888 --> 00:29:02,789
If they are selling some time
at the toy shop please buy that...

359
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,288
Arjun needs that a little more...

360
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:07,356
Dev... You... What's your problem?

361
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:10,360
Tansen... I'm going to buy the tickets...

362
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:12,532
If you move from here, I will slap you...

363
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:15,028
Let's go home and I'll make you wear a dress...

364
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:20,873
Ok, Tanya... Now listen to me...
Stay close to me all the time...

365
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:23,373
I read about the Black Beast this morning...

366
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:25,875
We never know where he might
be lurking in his black coat...

367
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,707
Now hold my hand... is it clean?

368
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:33,050
Good girl... Should we go here?
Orthere? Who should I ask?

369
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:49,729
I saw you my beloved...

370
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:57,902
And it dawned on me how crazy love can be...

371
00:29:58,746 --> 00:29:59,644
Me?

372
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:03,415
I saw you my beloved...

373
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:05,915
Here I come Simran... Here I come...

374
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:11,588
Thank you, Maya... I really owe you one...

375
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:13,420
Not at all... She's a real sweetheart...

376
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:26,099
Black Beast... When will they nab him?

377
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:35,108
Got you... I told you not to move from there...

378
00:30:35,316 --> 00:30:36,112
Then why did you move?

379
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:41,114
You kids have really troubled me today...
Specially you...

380
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:43,750
You know what I am going to do to you?

381
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:47,289
I'm going to cut you into tiny pieces...

382
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:50,464
...and put them in a mixerto make Jamba juice...

383
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:56,636
I like children's Jamba juice...
Shut up... idiot...

384
00:30:57,171 --> 00:30:59,639
Black Beast!
- Are we going to stand here all day?

385
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:05,143
Come with me now... and don't you
dare get lost again... come...

386
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:10,644
I don't know why children are born at all...

387
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:12,820
Why can't humans be born full grown?

388
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:21,484
I'm taking you to your Papa...
I won't let anything happen to you...

389
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:25,491
The next time you lose, I'm going to...

390
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:27,660
Arjun...

391
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,166
Arjun

392
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:38,378
Black Beast!

393
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:54,183
Give me a minute here... come now... Run!

394
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:39,065
Maya!

395
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:44,403
She's become the Black Beast?

396
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:48,912
But why are you crying?

397
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:50,584
I thought I was being kidnapped...

398
00:32:50,785 --> 00:32:52,582
I don't have such good fortune that
someone will kidnap you...

399
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:55,251
Should I kill you?
- No... - Quiet then...

400
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:57,420
Sir... You will have to come with us...
- I will officer...

401
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,087
I hate you, Black Beast!

402
00:33:04,132 --> 00:33:05,929
E.R.! Patient with a leg injury...

403
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:07,931
Patient in trauma... be prepared...

404
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:12,936
Be prepared... patient with leg injury...
On the way...

405
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:19,108
Make way... make way...
Patient with leg injury here...

406
00:33:19,313 --> 00:33:19,938
...make way...

407
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:26,119
Excuse me... I have a leg injury...

408
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:28,284
Oh my God... get him...

409
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:34,287
Take the child...
- Take him and keep him...

410
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:37,293
Sir, do you have a leg injury?
- Yes... No... I used to have a leg injury...

411
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:39,966
You're in trauma... lay down... lie down...

412
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:43,303
calm down... calm down
we're here to help you...

413
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:45,131
Arjun... tell the fatso...

414
00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:46,473
calm down!

415
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:48,638
Don't touch my ass!

416
00:33:50,178 --> 00:33:51,304
I am going to kill you...

417
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:52,979
I am going to save you...

418
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:54,475
God bless you...

419
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,817
Don't touch my... Mummy!

420
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:58,815
Arjun... Papa loves you...

421
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:06,819
can I help you?

422
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,989
I'm here to see the Black Beast...
My wife...

423
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:15,996
Hi... Excuse me... I'm so sorry...
All this is my husband's fault...

424
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:17,330
Your husband is the Black Beast?

425
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:20,166
No... he's just a beast...

426
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:28,508
But all's well now... Your wife is
fine now... Just a minor sprain...

427
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:32,352
Thank God... Rishi Talwar...

428
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:34,855
Rhea Saran...

429
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:37,524
Rhea Saran? The Diva from DIVA...

430
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:39,026
Guilty as charged...

431
00:34:39,894 --> 00:34:46,026
Wow... Small world... I run a small
PR firm - Kamakaze...

432
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:48,702
I've been trying to meet you for a while...

433
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:50,530
It's not easy meeting me...

434
00:34:50,738 --> 00:34:52,706
Trust me, it's even more difficult to avoid me...

435
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:57,540
So sorry to disrupt your
wonderful conversation...

436
00:34:57,745 --> 00:35:02,705
But if you'd like to see your husband and
your wife... they're in room 502...

437
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:08,555
We tranquilized you by mistake...

438
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:12,715
We're so sorry forthe confusion...
Are you ok?

439
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:17,231
Does your mother love you? - Yes...

440
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:21,561
'cause she's really gonna miss you...
I'm going to kill you...

441
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,966
My lawyer will call you...

442
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:25,600
My lawyer will speak with you...

443
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:27,474
And my lawyer will speak to you...

444
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:34,244
You... I know you...

445
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:38,251
Even I remember... We've met before...

446
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:43,913
Now I can't walk for a week because of you...

447
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,427
I can't walk for life because of you...

448
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:48,754
What?

449
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:53,267
If I hadn't met you, my life
would have been different...

450
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,935
My pain would have been different...

451
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:58,264
And if I hadn't met you
I wouldn't have married...

452
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:00,099
Wouldn't have married?

453
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:06,112
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

454
00:36:06,314 --> 00:36:08,782
Good... - Good? - Bad... - Bad?

455
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:09,779
I mean... I don't know...

456
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:11,451
I don't know?

457
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:16,949
Are you happy?

458
00:36:20,828 --> 00:36:23,626
You can't take that long...
- Who are you to ask me all this?

459
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:25,799
You can't answer a question with a question...

460
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,126
Why should I bother about your questions?

461
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:28,802
Why should I answeryou? Who are you?

462
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:30,470
Who am I?

463
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:34,804
I'm the father of the child you were
running away with...

464
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:42,312
Don't you have your own children?
Oh...

465
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:44,313
...you don't...

466
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:47,651
Yes... I don't have any...
I can't have them...

467
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:50,483
I teach children...
I'm a motherto all of them...

468
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:52,659
Mother India...

469
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,660
Teaching children... Running away with them...

470
00:36:56,864 --> 00:36:58,422
...are you able to fill your emptiness with all this?

471
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:01,659
Because your life is empty... incomplete...

472
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:09,833
It shows in your eyes... Just like in mine...

473
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:12,508
Dev...

474
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:17,175
Mama... - Oh, Rhea...
Why did you take the trouble?

475
00:37:17,385 --> 00:37:18,511
You are so considerate...

476
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,347
I'm beginning to feel pressurized
by your niceness...

477
00:37:21,722 --> 00:37:24,020
Dev, please... it's been a really long day...

478
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:27,857
I apologise on his behalf...
I'm so so sorry... Once again...

479
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:30,864
Rhea, look... It's cool... It's cool...

480
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:33,192
It's cool...

481
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:38,372
We haven't met... Rishi...

482
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,537
Rishi Kapoor?

483
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:43,877
No... Husband...

484
00:37:44,578 --> 00:37:49,880
Nobody's perfect...
My head is spinning... Bye bye...

485
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:50,880
Sayonara... Goodbye...

486
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:53,883
No good bye...

487
00:37:54,956 --> 00:37:58,392
Goodbye kills all hope of meeting again...

488
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:02,562
And who knows? We might meet again...

489
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:10,403
Dev... No one ever wants to meet you again...

490
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:11,229
Ok... Bye...

491
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:13,407
Ok... Nice meeting you... Bye...

492
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,907
Is he on drugs?

493
00:38:20,614 --> 00:38:23,913
There you go... Not to worry, Maya...

494
00:38:24,118 --> 00:38:27,087
...the doctor has said you'll
be fine in two to three days...

495
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:29,753
Afterthat it's back to your normal exercise...

496
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:34,087
Dusting, cleaning, vacuuming,
brushing... - Shut up!

497
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:35,424
Sorry...

498
00:38:37,298 --> 00:38:40,597
God... Not you... It's that...
What was his name?

499
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:42,769
Dev... he was talking nonsense...

500
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,938
...and did you see how he was talking to his wife?

501
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:45,935
He's so rude...

502
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:51,605
Maya... Not all husbands can be
as good as me...

503
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:57,105
To keep my heart at yourfeet...

504
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:02,280
Love you all day long...

505
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:04,950
God, Maya...

506
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,287
You are so sexy...

507
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:11,798
Tonight I'm going to...

508
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:15,962
Tonight I'm going to...

509
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:21,133
Maya...

510
00:39:24,678 --> 00:39:25,303
Maya!

511
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:31,484
Hi...

512
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:32,986
You?

513
00:39:33,187 --> 00:39:36,156
Of course not... It's someone else...
What a strange question!

514
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:37,824
You? Who else will I be?

515
00:39:38,025 --> 00:39:40,653
Whatever... I'm glad you are here...
- Were you thinking of me?

516
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:42,488
Yes... I've been thinking of you for a week...

517
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:45,824
Listen all that I said that day
was because of the injection...

518
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:49,491
I'm married... And to think of a married
man in that way is a sin...

519
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:50,829
You talk rubbish... - Yeah!

520
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:53,666
I wanted to meet you to say that the
things you said to me that day...

521
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:56,001
...are true... And the truth is always bitter...

522
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,508
You are bitter!
Not the truth... And who are you?

523
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:01,681
The Supreme court?
To pass judgements on others' lives?

524
00:40:01,882 --> 00:40:03,349
I'm not listening to this...
- Just listen to me...

525
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:04,677
I'm not... - Just listen...

526
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:05,848
OK...

527
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:08,021
Listen... I'm very happy... Thank you...

528
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:10,018
You should think about your own life...

529
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:13,852
I'm sure your life is empty...
and your dreams, unfulfilled...

530
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:16,029
That's why you keep searching
forthe same in others' lives...

531
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:18,365
You are an unhappy man
and will always be...

532
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:22,033
You are a beautiful woman
and will always be...

533
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:27,366
Maya... Maya... Just listen...

534
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:31,207
We are both alike... very alike...
I'm sorry...

535
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:34,543
We travel from the same station...
Both teach children...

536
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:36,715
Both of us are wounded...

537
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:41,216
It's just that my wounds show... yours don't...

538
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:50,059
And we can discuss our sad lives over coffee...

539
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:52,892
No Thank you...
My husband's waiting for me at home...

540
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:57,563
Well... Even Rhea must be home by now...

541
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:25,865
Hey!

542
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,862
Hey! Dude! What's going on here?

543
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,697
What went on is over now...

544
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:33,702
come on, Dad... This is my house...

545
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,206
Just chill... chill... chill son...

546
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,875
We were just passing by and
so we thought we'd just...

547
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,045
...you know... rock n roll...

548
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,218
If Maya arrives now she will kill me...

549
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,556
Papa is going to kill me...

550
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,222
Today was the music class
so I bunked football...

551
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:54,393
No, my child... Nothing will happen...
I'll take care of it...

552
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,222
No, grandma... he's going to kill me...

553
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,226
Why will he kill you?

554
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,228
You are learning the guitar
and that's a good thing...

555
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,730
Not guitar, Mom... violin...

556
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,234
Oh... violin... I don't understand
why he is so scared of Dev...

557
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,406
But Mom, you don't understand...
- No darling you relax...

558
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,403
But Mom...

559
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,902
Shut up! Nothing's going to happen...

560
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,745
I'll tell Dev that you are not well... Ok?

561
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,572
Ok...

562
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,248
Why should we lie?

563
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,750
We'll just get back to you darling...

564
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,418
Now come on go upstairs and grandma...

565
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,247
...will give you a nice hot water bath later...

566
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,422
Good boy...

567
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,922
Shit... Maya has come...
Please hide this one somewhere?

568
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,593
In my arms?

569
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,422
Dad... Just put some clothes on...

570
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,597
Ok... ok...

571
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,433
Mom... he's come...

572
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,931
Hi!

573
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:39,605
How was your day? Do you know...

574
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,106
I know... I know everything...

575
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,945
Everything? No... I think you...

576
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:55,053
Please... watch it... Don't try to hide
from me I know everything...

577
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,291
Yes... I know... I saw it with my eyes...

578
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,790
Did you hearthat? She knows everything...

579
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,622
Look at this...
And we were trying to hide from her...

580
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,128
Dad! Even you know?

581
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,631
What do you mean when did I know?
It was my idea to make an excuse...

582
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,463
Now the poorfellow is hiding
in the bathroom...

583
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,639
What? He's in my bathroom?

584
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,966
She is in my bedroom?

585
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,803
Don't go in... Poorthing...
She's not wearing any...

586
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,645
What is she doing without clothes?

587
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,146
What do you do without clothes?

588
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,485
I will not let him live...
I'm going to... What are you doing?

589
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,819
Dev... listen... please... Stop it, Dev!

590
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,994
I pray to you... he's already too scared
I'm going to him now...

591
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,995
Why? - To give him a bath...

592
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,328
So now you will bathe him?
That too in my bathroom...

593
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,004
The bathroom doesn't belong to just you...

594
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:48,833
It's mine too... he will use it...
Both of us will bathe him...

595
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,840
Oh yeah... Sure! - Shut up!

596
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,512
How could you do this?
Aren't you ashamed?

597
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,509
But what have I done?

598
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,841
Please... Please... You two stop fighting...

599
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,017
I'm taking herto my house...

600
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,514
Why would you take herto your house?

601
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,846
Because I paid her...
- She takes money?

602
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,852
Yeah... Nothing comes forfree these days...

603
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,684
By the way what's the rate these days?

604
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:07,188
Per day or weekends? - Weekends...

605
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,191
Let's see now... the last time... - Stop!

606
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,193
Both of you have gone crazy!

607
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,695
No, Dev... You are crazy...

608
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,867
Look at what you are doing...

609
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,361
I can't take this anymore...
I'm sleeping with him tonight...

610
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,366
Me too... - You too?

611
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,539
Have some shame...
Look at his age and yours...

612
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,536
You look at your age...

613
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:21,704
Don't cross your limits...

614
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:24,842
Mommy! What about your limits?

615
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,048
The two of you... both...

616
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,217
Yes? - Disgusting...

617
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:35,882
And she... I will not spare her... Rhea...!

618
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,049
Rhea?

619
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,054
Rishi...

620
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:39,725
Rishi?

621
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,891
I'm so hot, I am so hot, hot, hot, hot...

622
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,892
Rhea... Rhea...

623
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:50,564
Oh God! Rishi?

624
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,403
He was just inviting me for his Dad's party...

625
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,904
...so that I can see his work...

626
00:44:55,142 --> 00:44:56,575
It's just a PR exercise, Dev...

627
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,402
What about the flowers?

628
00:44:57,678 --> 00:44:59,578
Rhea sent them foryou...

629
00:44:59,813 --> 00:45:01,747
Oh God... This confusion...

630
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,416
Where are you going, baby?

631
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,418
And who is this?

632
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,581
This? This is your motherto be...

633
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,089
I don't believe this...

634
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:16,591
You thought I was having
an affair with Rishi?

635
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,594
What's with you, Dev? You are crazy...

636
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,932
I'm crazy? I thought you were crazy...

637
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,605
I mean, what's happened to yourtaste?

638
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,933
The next time you want to
have an affair let me know...

639
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,276
I will look forthe right guy...

640
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:34,944
After all, you have to maintain a standard,
the great Rhea Saran...

641
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,617
Dev... Don't try to hide yourfeelings with...

642
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,285
...your stupid sense of humour...

643
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,780
You were jealous and I love it...

644
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,115
Yeah right!

645
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:48,293
This just means that somewhere
there is a little love left... Right?

646
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:54,957
Yes... very deep inside...
come on get ready... I'm ready to go...

647
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:56,799
You are coming wearing this?

648
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,472
No... I'm taking this off and coming nude...

649
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,971
No, Dev... Why don't you wearthe
suit that I bought last week...

650
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,303
Why sweetheart? Embarrassed?

651
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,140
Embarrassed, that I'm wearing this?

652
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,812
Embarrassed, that in these clothes...

653
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,316
...I won't look like the rich and famous
Rhea Saran's husband?

654
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,822
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Rhea...

655
00:46:17,891 --> 00:46:21,657
...but even new clothes are not
going to make me new...

656
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:26,826
Even I love the old Dev...
but he is lost somewhere...

657
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,164
You are the one who lost him...

658
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,356
Maya!

659
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,698
What are you doing, Rishi?

660
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:03,367
I'm celebrating!

661
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,366
Celebrating what?

662
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,540
My wife's jealous...
I got some reaction at last...

663
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,867
God, Rishi... Stop behaving like a child...

664
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,043
...We are getting late... come on...

665
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:11,369
Maya...

666
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,376
Rishi... We are getting late...
Please go and change your clothes...

667
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,880
Tell me something... What if I was
really having an affair?

668
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,882
What would you do? - Rishi...

669
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,055
come on... Humour me... - Rishi...

670
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,223
Please...

671
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:29,885
Ok... If you were truly having an
affair I would think... analyse...

672
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,894
...try to find out why it happened...

673
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,726
And then I would discuss it with you...

674
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:35,393
Discuss with me?

675
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,399
Come on woman, show some passion...

676
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,401
Say that you would scream... shout...

677
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,904
...weep hysterically... Some drama...

678
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,078
Drama? If you wanted drama you
should have married an actress...

679
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,406
But you settled for a boring teacher...
So sorry...

680
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:50,082
Oh God, Maya... you are so touchy...

681
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,411
Then why do you say such things?
- I was just kidding...

682
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,581
What if I was having an affair?
What would you do?

683
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:03,920
Your affair? Fantastic... very good!

684
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,262
What was so funny?

685
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,433
What do you mean what's funny?

686
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,101
You can't handle one relationship...

687
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,101
How will you manage two?
But anyway I like the attitude... keep at it...

688
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,432
I'm going to get ready... See ya...

689
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:22,445
What's the matter, Rishi?
I can't handle a relationship...

690
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:29,453
No passion... No drama...
I'm not a good wife... can't be a mother...

691
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,453
Since I have so many flaws
why don't you leave me?

692
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,461
Both of us have flaws, Maya...

693
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:43,468
But the difference is that you always talk...

694
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,297
...about breaking the relationship...

695
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,473
...and I talk about making it work...

696
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,480
Please make sure there's
service everywhere... ok?

697
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,481
And why is nobody serving in that corner?

698
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:03,144
Come on, come on, please move it... Oh, hello...

699
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,159
Hello there... Long time no see...

700
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,156
Just as well...

701
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:09,994
Incidentally hasn't the size
of chandigarh increased...

702
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,323
...since the last time we met...

703
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,829
It's the number in your eye
that has increased, Mr. Talwar...

704
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,833
Hello... Aren't you going to introduce
me to your daughter?

705
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,336
Daughter? Maybe yours... Meet Saturday...

706
00:49:20,607 --> 00:49:21,505
Saturday?

707
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,506
Yeah... I can't remember all their names...

708
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,179
...so I call them by the day I meet them...
yeah baby?

709
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,006
Yeah!

710
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,012
Yeah right... See you later gorgeous...

711
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,344
Who's that? - My mother...

712
00:49:33,754 --> 00:49:35,016
Ah! Rhea... thanks for coming...

713
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:36,346
Of course we had to come...

714
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,184
By the way the sixties theme is a great idea...

715
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,360
It's all so beautiful...

716
00:49:40,627 --> 00:49:45,360
No... No... You are beautiful darling... hello...

717
00:49:45,632 --> 00:49:47,361
I'm Rishi's father... in every way...

718
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:51,196
And I'm Rhea's husband...
in almost every way...

719
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,030
Oh...

720
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:54,535
Do you like my suit? Do you like it?

721
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,209
Rhea... You look gorgeous...

722
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,036
Thank you...

723
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,712
I really think we should have that affair...

724
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:03,542
Sure... I know for a fact that my
husband will not object...

725
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:07,542
Neither will my wife...
as long as we sit and discuss it later...

726
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:08,550
Right, darling?

727
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,223
Oh, wow...
You guys have discussions at home?

728
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,886
In our case we have to meet by appointment...

729
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,556
I think I need a drink...

730
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,891
Ah super... Let's all get drunk...

731
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:22,902
Rhea?

732
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:31,567
Super...
Do you know a good divorce lawyer?

733
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,741
I hate these parties...

734
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:39,578
I think these parties are organized
to touch other people's wives...

735
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,247
Don't even think about that...

736
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,755
Don't worry...
I haven't reached such desperate days...

737
00:50:47,494 --> 00:50:49,428
Look at them... Just look at them...
Oh my darling...

738
00:50:49,696 --> 00:50:53,257
Mwaah... Mwaah... Mwaah...

739
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,599
You know... I have just realized that
not only do I hate parties...

740
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,270
I hate people...

741
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:02,931
As far as I know, even people
aren't crazy about you...

742
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,443
Not that they are crowding
around you either...

743
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,276
It doesn't make a difference to me...
They are all strangers...

744
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,948
Even your husband?

745
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:20,451
Rishi...

746
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,489
Fair skinned faces...

747
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,152
Moon lit faces...

748
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,991
Dark long tresses...

749
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,493
Sky blue eyes...

750
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,499
Fair skinned faces...

751
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,998
Moon lit faces...

752
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,668
Dark long tresses...

753
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,170
Sky blue eyes...

754
00:52:09,442 --> 00:52:10,568
They weave dreams...

755
00:52:10,777 --> 00:52:11,903
They lead you astray...

756
00:52:12,112 --> 00:52:14,239
Take away your sanity...

757
00:52:14,447 --> 00:52:15,744
They drive you crazy...

758
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:16,914
They ignite a fire...

759
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:19,244
Intoxicate your being...

760
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:21,850
Rock and roll, my love

761
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,523
My heart sings foryou...

762
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,692
Rock and roll, my love...

763
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,361
come sway with me...

764
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,861
Rock and roll, my love

765
00:52:32,132 --> 00:52:34,191
My heart sings foryou...

766
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,695
Rock and roll, my love

767
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,701
come sway with me...

768
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,904
These lithe bodies...

769
00:53:15,175 --> 00:53:17,405
These swaying hips...

770
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,912
First they attack the heart...

771
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,081
Then go foryour life...

772
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,084
These flashes of lightning...

773
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,412
These sorceresses of love...

774
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:32,251
I have seen many and yet fall prey...

775
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:34,755
They come... and they go...

776
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,589
At their whim and fancy...

777
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,924
These angels... these fairies...

778
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,931
At a mere glance from them...

779
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,434
The world can go crazy...

780
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,607
And be at theirfeet...

781
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,442
And yet these beauties...

782
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,942
Don't know what love is...

783
00:53:53,213 --> 00:53:55,272
Rock and roll, my love

784
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,110
My heart sings foryou...

785
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,286
Rock and roll...

786
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,955
come sway with me...

787
00:54:03,223 --> 00:54:05,453
Rock and roll, my love

788
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,957
My heart sings foryou...

789
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,288
Rock and roll, my love

790
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:13,466
come sway with me...

791
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:27,640
Head in a cap and a red scarf waving...

792
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,816
Oh... What do I say?

793
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:45,157
Fair skinned maiden
with a black strand on the face...

794
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,334
Oh... What do I say?

795
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,851
These pretty faces...

796
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,182
These beautiful women...

797
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,019
They don't know what love is...

798
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,854
Or what it is to be loyal...

799
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:19,031
These stonehearted lovers...

800
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:21,529
What do they care?

801
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:26,195
What we go through, coping with them?

802
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,533
They are ignorant... like strangers...

803
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,370
What do they know about feelings?

804
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,705
They don't know...
they don't care...

805
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,541
That hearts can break with words they say...

806
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,876
Like asking for comfort from fire...

807
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:41,383
Orfire from ice...
We have spent out entire lives...

808
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,216
Now we know what we lost...

809
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,722
Wasting ourtime that was precious...

810
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,053
Rock and roll...

811
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,560
My heart sings foryou...

812
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,063
Rock and roll, my love

813
00:55:54,334 --> 00:55:56,734
come sway with me...

814
00:55:57,003 --> 00:55:59,233
Rock and roll, my love

815
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,907
My heart sings foryou...

816
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,076
Rock and roll, my love

817
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:07,075
come sway with me...

818
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,256
Rock and roll

819
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:30,928
Fair skinned faces...

820
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,105
Moon lit faces...

821
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,441
Dark long tresses...

822
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:37,877
Sky blue eyes...

823
00:56:38,845 --> 00:56:40,938
They weave dreams...
They lead you astray...

824
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:44,446
Take away your sanity...
They drive you crazy...

825
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:47,618
They ignite a fire...
Intoxicate your being...

826
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,618
Rock and roll, my love

827
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,950
My heart sings foryou...

828
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,285
Rock and roll, my love...

829
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,621
come sway with me...

830
00:56:56,863 --> 00:56:58,626
Rock and roll, my love

831
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,959
My heart sings foryou...

832
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,964
Rock and roll, my love...

833
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,467
come sway with me...

834
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,469
Rock and roll, my love

835
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,801
My heart sings foryou...

836
00:57:10,076 --> 00:57:11,976
Rock and roll, my love...

837
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,476
come sway with me...

838
00:57:14,747 --> 00:57:16,476
Rock and roll, my love

839
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,810
My heart sings foryou...

840
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,815
Rock and roll, my love...

841
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,112
come sway with me...

842
00:57:25,558 --> 00:57:31,827
Maya... Rishi...
And all you wonderful people...

843
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,827
Thank you for being here with me tonight...

844
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:40,165
And I hope that all of you are
having a great time... yeah!

845
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,170
Yeah!

846
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:46,334
You know, people always ask me
why I throw this party every year...

847
00:57:47,247 --> 00:57:50,011
What's so special about this day?

848
00:57:52,185 --> 00:57:53,482
The day is special...

849
00:57:56,055 --> 00:58:02,358
It's on this day that I met my
wife forthe first time...

850
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:09,000
That's why, every year, I celebrate...

851
00:58:10,036 --> 00:58:11,867
...this day and also seek herforgiveness...

852
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,708
Forgiveness for each day...

853
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:22,542
...when I chose my dreams
over my relationships...

854
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:27,544
Forgiveness for each minute when...

855
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:33,389
...I hurt her and didn't even
botherto make up...

856
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:45,728
But, most of all, forgiveness for
all those innumerable moments...

857
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:51,073
...when I forgot to tell her
how much I loved her...

858
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:05,751
...assuming that I will have a
lot of time to say so...

859
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,589
But I was wrong...

860
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,932
With her death I lost that time...

861
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:27,610
That's why I always say
that time means 'now'...

862
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,113
If you have to love, love 'now'...

863
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,945
If you have to ask forforgiveness, ask 'now'...

864
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,785
If you want to hold hands, hold it 'now'...

865
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,620
Or else years lateryou will find
yourself at a party like me...

866
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,959
...asking forforgiveness from your beloved...

867
00:59:51,571 --> 00:59:52,799
So...

868
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,967
All you wonderful married couples out there...

869
00:59:56,175 --> 01:00:00,976
Look to your partner and tell them 'I love you'...

870
01:00:05,251 --> 01:00:07,811
And all of you that are single...

871
01:00:08,254 --> 01:00:10,313
Turn this way... Girls only...

872
01:00:11,591 --> 01:00:16,153
And tell me that... Alright... Ok...

873
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:17,659
This speech is getting really boring...

874
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,331
Let's party... come on guys...

875
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,659
Hit it... Eh chandigarh...

876
01:00:41,954 --> 01:00:44,252
Last night I encountered
the real Samarjit hidden...

877
01:00:44,457 --> 01:00:47,756
...behind 'Sexy Sam'...
I liked him...

878
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:55,261
Really? And what was the difference
between Sam and Samarjit?

879
01:00:56,135 --> 01:01:00,595
Sam runs after girls and Samarjit,
after memories...

880
01:01:00,973 --> 01:01:07,936
You really miss your wife very much...
Don't you? I can understand...

881
01:01:09,816 --> 01:01:14,617
Tell me...
How do you cope with your loneliness?

882
01:01:14,821 --> 01:01:17,449
I spend time with friends...

883
01:01:20,827 --> 01:01:22,795
I have very few friends...

884
01:01:22,995 --> 01:01:24,121
Not from today...

885
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,628
Oh... so you will be my friend?

886
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,630
Absolutely...

887
01:01:28,835 --> 01:01:30,803
So... friendship means no touching?

888
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:34,471
All you are going to get is this...

889
01:01:35,141 --> 01:01:37,609
Thank you... It's good for a start...

890
01:01:44,851 --> 01:01:45,818
Mummy!

891
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:03,335
What... What are your intentions?

892
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:04,332
The intentions are very noble my son...

893
01:02:04,537 --> 01:02:06,664
Just that I won't take dowry...
I'm anti dowry...

894
01:02:06,873 --> 01:02:08,170
Mom... What is he saying?

895
01:02:08,374 --> 01:02:10,501
Sam... What are you saying?
- Kamal... What is he saying?

896
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,007
What are all of you saying?

897
01:02:12,545 --> 01:02:15,343
I'm scared to come out of the station...

898
01:02:15,882 --> 01:02:17,008
You never know what you'll get to see...

899
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:19,184
Not only the station...
you should not get out of the house at all...

900
01:02:19,385 --> 01:02:20,181
The world is evil...

901
01:02:20,386 --> 01:02:24,015
Sam... Just a minute... Both of us...

902
01:02:24,223 --> 01:02:27,852
Wow! So now it's 'us', huh?

903
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:37,700
Samarjit and I, are both alone...
We lost our love years ago...

904
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:41,369
And when two people are going
through the same phase...

905
01:02:41,574 --> 01:02:46,705
...they understand each other better...
They become close...

906
01:02:46,913 --> 01:02:51,543
What they can't say to others...
they can say to each other...

907
01:02:51,818 --> 01:02:54,878
Precisely...
Two strangers... Same situation...

908
01:02:55,087 --> 01:02:57,055
Then friendship...
and the problem is solved...

909
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:02,387
That's it... Simple... right, Maya? Cheers!

910
01:03:35,795 --> 01:03:42,758
My marriage is failing, Dev...
And from what I can see, so is yours...

911
01:03:46,305 --> 01:03:51,766
I can't save my marriage on my own...
I need a friend...

912
01:03:52,545 --> 01:03:57,448
Afriend who will understand me...
who will make me understand...

913
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:00,118
Who is familiar with my circumstance...

914
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,617
And who can do this betterthan you?

915
01:04:03,689 --> 01:04:05,953
That's why I'm here to extend
a hand in friendship...

916
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:07,787
Will you accept it?

917
01:04:13,332 --> 01:04:19,794
I'm hurting, Maya...
I want to sit down...

918
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:55,329
And that's how two strangers came together...

919
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:57,668
...to save their relationships, and
gave birth to a new one...

920
01:04:58,044 --> 01:05:03,505
On that rainy day, neither of us
saw the storm that awaited us...

921
01:05:05,384 --> 01:05:06,851
Afterthat we met everyday...

922
01:05:07,053 --> 01:05:09,851
I don't know why, but when I was
with Maya, I was different...

923
01:05:10,056 --> 01:05:12,354
I had found my lost smile...

924
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,358
We had considerably increased the business...

925
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,187
...of the New York cafes quite a lot...

926
01:05:17,063 --> 01:05:20,032
We spoke a lot about Rhea and Rishi...

927
01:05:20,232 --> 01:05:21,358
How wrong they were...

928
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:25,697
How right we were... then how right
they were and how wrong we were...

929
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:29,537
But in relationships, no matter
who's right and who's wrong...

930
01:05:29,742 --> 01:05:36,875
...someone has to make the first move...
And we decided it should be ours...

931
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:39,043
This is a very interesting book...

932
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:43,210
It says don't look foryour spouse's
faults in your marriage...

933
01:05:43,422 --> 01:05:44,548
Improve your own flaws...

934
01:05:44,757 --> 01:05:45,883
And what if someone's perfect?

935
01:05:46,092 --> 01:05:49,220
Ya... Right... Anyway let's start with me...

936
01:05:49,462 --> 01:05:51,726
...tell me all the things that are wrong with me...

937
01:05:52,264 --> 01:05:54,732
And listen tell me the truth... be frank...

938
01:05:54,934 --> 01:05:56,231
be honest... orthere's no point...

939
01:05:56,435 --> 01:05:59,893
Alright... here goes... You are that teachertype...

940
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,174
Boring... with no personality...

941
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:04,668
You are a compulsive cleaner
to the point of illness...

942
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:07,912
...basically, you are a loyal maidservant...

943
01:06:08,114 --> 01:06:08,739
What?

944
01:06:09,015 --> 01:06:10,243
You don't have anything womanly in you...

945
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,908
You are not sexy...
Not from any angle...

946
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:16,413
Maybe from behind...

947
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:19,417
But no man will get excited looking at you...

948
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,422
I know your husband gets excited...

949
01:06:21,627 --> 01:06:23,424
...but that's probably because
he is visually impaired...

950
01:06:23,629 --> 01:06:24,596
because you don't have...

951
01:06:24,797 --> 01:06:27,425
Dev... You are so rude... So mean...

952
01:06:27,633 --> 01:06:29,430
What mean? Rude?
Didn't you just ask me to speak the truth?

953
01:06:29,635 --> 01:06:30,602
But you could have said something nice...

954
01:06:30,803 --> 01:06:31,770
But did you ask me to say something nice?

955
01:06:31,971 --> 01:06:33,268
And what would you say if I had?

956
01:06:33,973 --> 01:06:36,601
That your eyes are the most
beautiful eyes in the world...

957
01:06:37,143 --> 01:06:39,270
But you didn't ask, so I didn't say...

958
01:06:40,713 --> 01:06:44,274
You know what your problem is?
You don't know how to speak to a lady...

959
01:06:44,483 --> 01:06:45,108
And you know how?

960
01:06:45,317 --> 01:06:47,285
Yes... I know what to say to a woman and how...

961
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:48,282
Oh... So you are a lesbian?

962
01:06:48,487 --> 01:06:49,283
Shut up...
I know because my husband says...

963
01:06:49,488 --> 01:06:51,456
...the most romantic things to me everyday...

964
01:06:51,657 --> 01:06:52,954
Any woman would go crazy listening to them...

965
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:56,959
Right... Except you of course...
- Listen... Do you want to learn or no?

966
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,128
Wow... This place has so many beds...

967
01:07:05,337 --> 01:07:08,465
Maya, if you were so desperate, we
could have booked a hotel room...

968
01:07:08,674 --> 01:07:09,641
Why have we come here?

969
01:07:10,176 --> 01:07:13,475
Listen, Dev...
I have no time foryour sense of humour...

970
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:15,146
You have to learn a lot on this bed...

971
01:07:15,414 --> 01:07:18,144
On this bed? What are the new things
you are going to teach me here?

972
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:20,318
Just so you know only my leg is broken...

973
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:21,486
All the other parts are absolutely perfect...

974
01:07:21,687 --> 01:07:23,154
OK... This is not going to work...

975
01:07:23,689 --> 01:07:27,147
No... Dev, serious... Serious...

976
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,152
Serious? - Yeah... serious...

977
01:07:29,428 --> 01:07:33,330
Ok... the situation is that Rhea
has come back tired from work...

978
01:07:33,532 --> 01:07:35,830
Now I will tell you what you need to do...

979
01:07:36,102 --> 01:07:38,161
I'm Dev and you are Rhea... understand?

980
01:07:38,437 --> 01:07:40,496
No... I don't but whatever...

981
01:07:40,773 --> 01:07:42,673
Let's start... - Let's start...

982
01:07:44,376 --> 01:07:46,844
Ok... Bouncy bouncy bed...

983
01:07:47,713 --> 01:07:50,181
Start... - What? - Rhea...

984
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:51,507
Oh yeah... I'm Rhea...

985
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:56,517
Rhea would say...
As soon as she came home...

986
01:07:57,223 --> 01:08:00,021
It's been a long tiring day!

987
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:05,030
I think you need a massage... - I do?

988
01:08:10,236 --> 01:08:11,032
Here?

989
01:08:12,738 --> 01:08:13,705
It feels good, huh?

990
01:08:13,906 --> 01:08:15,032
Actually, it does... really...

991
01:08:16,075 --> 01:08:17,201
You can't do this...

992
01:08:19,912 --> 01:08:24,212
Oh, Rhea... You are so beautiful!

993
01:08:25,751 --> 01:08:31,883
Rhea... Your eyes... Your lips...

994
01:08:33,425 --> 01:08:35,393
...Your everything...

995
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:43,390
Oh! Your arms... I want to die in them...

996
01:09:02,454 --> 01:09:07,585
Don't stop! No... no... Go...
come here... come here...

997
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,767
I'm taking this bed...

998
01:09:15,968 --> 01:09:16,593
Please do...

999
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:31,945
Maya... Rishi... says and
does all these things to you...

1000
01:09:33,853 --> 01:09:37,687
And yet you don't... you... don't...

1001
01:09:45,164 --> 01:09:50,932
Actually, you are quite sexy... really...

1002
01:09:52,037 --> 01:09:55,302
You just need to show it to Rishi...
That's all...

1003
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:11,256
What's this?
- This is my sister... - What?

1004
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,687
We were separated as children... Maya...

1005
01:10:13,893 --> 01:10:16,487
You need to wear clothes like
these foryour husband...

1006
01:10:16,695 --> 01:10:19,892
No... Dev... If I wear clothes like these...

1007
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:21,027
...I will look like 'that' type of a woman...

1008
01:10:21,233 --> 01:10:24,100
Yeah... That's the type that men like...

1009
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:25,770
Dev... But that looks cheap...

1010
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:30,567
Yeah... cheap... cheap is nice...
I like cheap! Maya...

1011
01:10:30,776 --> 01:10:32,835
You taught me how to talk to women...

1012
01:10:33,045 --> 01:10:35,036
how to massage them...
how to romance them...

1013
01:10:35,247 --> 01:10:39,775
If you want to learn how to be sexy...
then ask me... I'm the man...

1014
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:40,451
Dev...

1015
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,884
Don't worry... This will protect you...

1016
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:44,713
But this...

1017
01:10:44,924 --> 01:10:49,952
But not that... 'Butt' this! That's the whip...
Hit me baby... hit me...

1018
01:10:50,262 --> 01:10:51,388
So dude... tell me...

1019
01:10:52,531 --> 01:10:55,466
Did you tell Maya about this last
minute football party?

1020
01:10:56,802 --> 01:10:58,201
You think she'd allow if I told her?

1021
01:10:58,404 --> 01:11:00,099
You are so dead, man!

1022
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:03,137
Hey, Rhea... The head office is still
waiting foryour answer...

1023
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,468
What have you decided?

1024
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,202
I know, Jai, but please understand...

1025
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,371
I know it will be the biggest move
for my career...

1026
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,174
But to shift to London is not easy for me...

1027
01:11:13,752 --> 01:11:16,084
I have to think of too many things...

1028
01:11:17,656 --> 01:11:20,147
Anyway, can we talk about this tomorrow?

1029
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,320
Ok... I'll call you... Thanks...

1030
01:11:22,928 --> 01:11:23,587
Hi...

1031
01:11:24,396 --> 01:11:25,055
Hello!

1032
01:11:25,497 --> 01:11:26,623
How was your day?

1033
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:28,331
Nice...

1034
01:11:28,734 --> 01:11:31,498
God... I had a long tiring day...

1035
01:11:34,473 --> 01:11:40,969
Good... I mean... I think you need a
massage... baby...

1036
01:11:41,613 --> 01:11:42,375
Massage?

1037
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:49,385
I'm going to be your masseur, Baby...

1038
01:11:57,229 --> 01:12:00,460
You like that? You like that?

1039
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:19,643
I want to die in your arms...

1040
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:25,789
Your ears... Yourforehead...

1041
01:12:26,725 --> 01:12:34,723
Your nose... your cheeks...
Your lips... All of it is... blue...

1042
01:12:40,172 --> 01:12:44,006
Dev... If this was a joke then it
really wasn't funny!

1043
01:12:49,214 --> 01:12:49,873
Maya!

1044
01:12:51,817 --> 01:12:55,412

We'll try again...

1054
01:14:32,618 --> 01:14:34,381
Try what? Marriage?

1055
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,617
Not marriage... We'll try again...

1056

I have one more superb plan...

It'll be farfrom superb... It'll be a bullshit plan...

01:15:06,485 --> 01:15:07,281

Don't hide from your own dreams...

our wedding anniversaries...

So I think we should do something special
for Rishi and Rhea... What do you think?

1116
01:19:42,961 --> 01:19:45,395
Maybe we should leave them...
That will be pretty special...

1117
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:48,430
come on, Dev...

1118
01:19:48,733 --> 01:19:53,466

Why do you shackle yourfeet?

1123
01:20:16,428 --> 01:20:22,992
Dance to the tune of love you fool...

1124
01:20:23,201 --> 01:20:27,467
Let caution fly to the winds...

1125
01:20:27,672 --> 01:20:31,540

1126
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:36,112

01:20:36,314 --> 01:20:39,875

O my heart, just whisper in my ear

1133
01:21:02,807 --> 01:21:07,073
Which way are you headed?

1134
01:21:07,312 --> 01:21:11,646
What is it that you yearn for?

1135
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:17,015
What is it that you seek?

1136
01:21:35,507 --> 01:21:41,446
My beloved...

1137
01:21:42,013 --> 01:21:49,613
My beloved...

1138
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:55,619
My beloved...

1139
01:22:07,272 --> 01:22:07,966
I'll take it...

1140
01:22:09,774 --> 01:22:10,832
Thank you, Dev...

1141
01:22:14,546 --> 01:22:18,744
Thank you...
This was our best anniversary ever...

1142
01:22:19,384 --> 01:22:20,442
Fantastic...

1143
01:22:22,153 --> 01:22:25,020
By the way, I want to tell you something...

1144
01:22:26,491 --> 01:22:28,857
The head office has offered me a promotion...

1145
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:32,296
...they want me to shift to London...

1146
01:22:32,831 --> 01:22:36,232
It means a better position,
higher salary, big house...

1147
01:22:36,434 --> 01:22:39,892
...basically the works...
And this morning I decided that...

1148
01:22:40,105 --> 01:22:43,472
...that you will shift... Wow!

1149
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,677
And of course there was
no need to consult me...

1150
01:22:47,112 --> 01:22:51,048
After all who am I? I'm just your husband?

1151
01:22:51,449 --> 01:22:53,280
What status do I have?

1152
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:58,989
I'm just here to applaud foryour success...

1153
01:23:02,594 --> 01:23:06,462
This one decision of yours can
change all our lives...

1154
01:23:06,665 --> 01:23:08,462
But why would you think of that?

1155
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:11,602
Because, Rhea Saran only
thinks about herself...

1156
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:18,236
...her rocking career, her success,
her happiness... dammit...

1157
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:22,372
It's always about you, you and you...

1158
01:23:22,814 --> 01:23:26,944
No goddamn it... It's about you,
you and only you, Dev...

1159
01:23:27,152 --> 01:23:30,383
I was just going to tell you that
I have refused the promotion...

1160
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:34,991
Afterthinking about you... this family...
But where do you listen?

1161
01:23:35,193 --> 01:23:38,720
If you refused the promotion what
was the need to tell me?

1162
01:23:39,864 --> 01:23:40,853
Trying to show off your magnanimity?

1163
01:23:41,066 --> 01:23:44,229
I wasn't showing off, Dev...
I was baring my heart...

1164
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:49,271
Do you have a heart, Rhea? What heart?

1165
01:23:50,642 --> 01:23:57,070
Arjun! Arjun! Stop that noise...

1166
01:23:57,282 --> 01:24:00,274
This is no time to play the violin...
It's time foryou to sleep...

1167
01:24:00,485 --> 01:24:02,043
You've got school tomorrow... Go now...

1168
01:24:02,253 --> 01:24:04,721
Don't touch the violin... get out of here...

1169
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:07,686
Arjun! Arjun!

1170
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:11,788
Why are you venting your anger on him?
What has he done?

1171
01:24:12,363 --> 01:24:15,161
Don't you dare tell me how I should
behave with Arjun, Rhea...

1172
01:24:15,934 --> 01:24:18,835
I know how to handle him...
I have brought him up...

1173
01:24:19,037 --> 01:24:22,734
Only I...
You had no time from your work...

1174
01:24:23,274 --> 01:24:25,401
Did you ever have time for him? Did you?

1175
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:30,377
Yes Dev... I didn't have time...
because I work very hard...

1176
01:24:31,049 --> 01:24:33,882
No one asks men when they are busy...

1177
01:24:34,419 --> 01:24:36,649
...when they have no time fortheir children...

1178
01:24:37,088 --> 01:24:39,056
Then why are you asking me?

1179
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,550
Tell me Dev, how can you ask me?

1180
01:24:42,127 --> 01:24:46,860
Because the truth is, that
I'm the man in this house...

1181
01:24:51,402 --> 01:24:55,463
I couldn't be Arjun's mother because
I had to be his father...

1182
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:57,766
So that he could have all the happiness...

1183
01:24:57,976 --> 01:25:00,069
...that a football coach cannot
afford to give him...

1184
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:05,680
How did that sound, Dev?
It hurts, doesn't it?

1185
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:08,078
Now you know how it feels?

1186
01:25:09,721 --> 01:25:12,781
You have only hurt me, Dev...

1187
01:25:14,392 --> 01:25:17,555
I always thought you hurt those
you love the most...

1188
01:25:18,763 --> 01:25:23,757
But that's not true...
You don't love me at all...

1189
01:25:24,636 --> 01:25:28,902
You don't love anyone...
You only hate...

1190
01:25:29,174 --> 01:25:33,611
You hate yourself... your life... yourfailure...

1191
01:25:40,351 --> 01:25:45,379
And I haven't been able to figure out
what angers you more...

1192
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:50,527
...yourfailure or my success!

1193
01:25:54,899 --> 01:26:00,496
Yes, Rhea... I'm a failure... That's true...

1194
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:07,440
But do you know, there's a greater
failure than me in this house?

1195
01:26:10,215 --> 01:26:17,212
And that's our relationship... Our marriage...

1196
01:26:19,457 --> 01:26:25,293
Thank you, Rhea... Thank you, for letting me
stay in your house, Rhea...

1197
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:29,289
Why are you so angry, Rishi?

1198
01:27:29,794 --> 01:27:31,989
What's the big deal if I didn't feel
like it one night?

1199
01:27:32,463 --> 01:27:33,395
Come on... Don't behave like a child!

1200
01:27:33,598 --> 01:27:39,764
Shut up! Just shut up! I have heard enough!

1201
01:27:40,605 --> 01:27:42,072
What's the problem, Rishi?

1202
01:27:42,707 --> 01:27:47,644
Maya... Do you rememberthe last time
we were intimate with each other?

1203
01:27:48,313 --> 01:27:53,182
When, Maya? When did we touch each other?

1204
01:27:53,384 --> 01:27:55,909
Held hands or embraced? Anything?
Do you remember?

1205
01:27:57,121 --> 01:27:59,954
When did we not turn our backs to each
other in bed? Do you remember?

1206
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:02,515
I don't remember...

1207
01:28:02,727 --> 01:28:04,194
You don't remember or don't want to remember?

1208
01:28:04,395 --> 01:28:05,225
I don't want to discuss this...

1209
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:10,527
Why? I thought you like discussions...
come on... let's discuss...

1210
01:28:10,735 --> 01:28:14,671
let's discuss why... Why my wife doesn't
want to sleep with me? Come on...

1211
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:18,568
Our relationship cannot grow just
by sleeping with each other, Rishi...

1212
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:22,175
It can only grow when we embrace
each other's sorrow and happiness...

1213
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,406
And when was the last time
we did that? When, Rishi?

1214
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:29,411
A husband and wife don't just share a bed...
they share their lives...

1215
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:33,183
What? How dare you?

1216
01:28:33,524 --> 01:28:34,821
Do you think I'm the kind of man...

1217
01:28:35,026 --> 01:28:36,357
...who only feels the need for his wife in bed?

1218
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:37,789
How dare you, Maya?

1219
01:28:38,463 --> 01:28:41,864
To embrace each other's happiness and pain,
one has to embrace each other...

1220
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:44,125
And you have neverfelt that way about me...

1221
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:46,263
'You are a child, you are a child,
you are a child...'

1222
01:28:46,471 --> 01:28:47,802
I'm fed up of hearing that...

1223
01:28:48,473 --> 01:28:51,670
If I was truly a child, I'd have
broken down long ago...

1224
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:54,006
I tolerate you because I'm a man!

1225
01:28:54,212 --> 01:28:55,577
I have heard enough...

1226
01:28:59,517 --> 01:29:01,610
Today you cannot leave like this...

1227
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:05,112
You will have to tell me today...

1228
01:29:05,323 --> 01:29:09,783
The truth... tell me... Why did you marry me?

1229
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:17,193
Why? I married you because I love you...

1230
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:20,634
But why did you marry me, Maya?

1231
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,905
Tell me... Why did you marry me?

1232
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:29,910
Rishi, leave me please... Rishi, please...
You are hurting me...

1233
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:31,376
Rishi... Rishi... Rishi...

1234
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:45,323
The truth, Maya, is that you never married me...

1235
01:29:47,065 --> 01:29:55,632
You compromised... I'm your
life's biggest compromise...

1236
01:29:58,943 --> 01:30:06,714
A compromise that you regret
every day of your life, right?

1237
01:30:10,021 --> 01:30:11,921
Give me an answer...

1238
01:30:14,692 --> 01:30:15,784
What answer?

1239
01:30:17,895 --> 01:30:24,266
You have nothing to give... Not love...

1240
01:30:24,368 --> 01:30:25,630
Not happiness... Not affection...

1241
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:28,202
You haven't even been able to give me a child!

1242
01:30:31,609 --> 01:30:36,239
And Maya, I have never made you feel
inadequate about that... never...

1243
01:30:48,326 --> 01:30:54,128
You just did... Just did... Rishi...

1244
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:49,648
Fouryears ago, you said that everlasting
romances don't exist anymore...

1245
01:31:49,854 --> 01:31:50,752
Remember, Dev?

1246
01:31:51,789 --> 01:31:53,154
Will you say the same even now?

1247
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,950
Fouryears ago, you said that...

1248
01:31:56,194 --> 01:31:58,890
...if I don't look for love after
marriage I won't find it...

1249
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:00,825
What will you say now, Dev?

1250
01:32:01,132 --> 01:32:02,258
What will you say?

1251
01:32:02,466 --> 01:32:03,433
Answer me...

1252
01:32:03,634 --> 01:32:06,603
What are you and me doing at the
station in the middle of the night?

1253
01:32:06,837 --> 01:32:07,929
What are we doing, Dev?

1254
01:32:08,139 --> 01:32:10,073
Answer... I need answers to
all these questions...

1255
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:11,969
I don't know... - Tell me...
Where are you going, Dev?

1256
01:32:12,176 --> 01:32:14,167
I want the answers... tell me, Dev... tell me...

1257
01:32:14,378 --> 01:32:16,903
Answer... I want to know... tell me...

1258
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:22,916
18th March 2002... You met me
forthe first time, Maya...

1259
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,088
I rememberthe exact time, Maya...

1260
01:32:25,356 --> 01:32:27,916
Since that day I have felt like
I have known you forever...

1261
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:29,649
Is this the answerto your question?

1262
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:31,760
Maybe not... Maybe this...

1263
01:32:32,363 --> 01:32:35,264
Everyday yourtrain leaves the station at 4.32...

1264
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:39,766
...and mine at 4.21... and everyday
I miss my train so...

1265
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:42,599
...that I can spend some
more moments with you...

1266
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:43,967
Is this the answerto your question?

1267
01:32:44,175 --> 01:32:44,834
Dev...

1268
01:32:45,042 --> 01:32:49,502
Everyday I leave you at the station but
yourthoughts don't leave me...

1269
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:51,774
Is this the answerto your question?

1270
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:55,248
Then try this... I'm a married man
Maya, and I think you forget...

1271
01:32:55,453 --> 01:32:56,579
...that you are too...

1272
01:32:57,088 --> 01:32:59,181
Since both of us are married...

1273
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:01,917
...what are we doing at the station
in the middle of the night?

1274
01:33:02,126 --> 01:33:05,584
Bingo... Bingo... I think I have the answer...

1275
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:08,828
That's the answerto your question, right?
Listen to the answer...

1276
01:33:09,033 --> 01:33:11,228
I love you, Maya...

1277
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:15,870
...and you love me too!

1278
01:33:50,775 --> 01:33:52,265
Mom, why are we discussing this?

1279
01:33:52,476 --> 01:33:54,000
You are Dev's mother... you will take up for him...

1280
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:56,236
I'm a woman before I'm a mother, Rhea...

1281
01:33:56,447 --> 01:34:01,282
And I know you are right...
But what happens just because I think so...

1282
01:34:01,485 --> 01:34:03,077
...the situation is not going to change...

1283
01:34:03,287 --> 01:34:05,346
Things will only change when Dev changes...

1284
01:34:05,556 --> 01:34:06,853
And that's not going to happen...

1285
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:08,525
Rhea... Rhea...

1286
01:34:08,793 --> 01:34:11,193
Mom... please... I'm tired...

1287
01:34:11,495 --> 01:34:14,953
I've tried enough to understand him...
to get closerto him...

1288
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:19,431
One fine day, he just decided to
step back from the relationship...

1289
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:26,107
He did not step back, Rhea... You raced ahead...
You have to wait for him...

1290
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:29,871
Why? Why is a woman always expected to wait?

1291
01:34:30,214 --> 01:34:35,743
Because they are stronger...
And have you thought about Arjun?

1292
01:34:35,953 --> 01:34:37,853
I'm not the kind of woman...

1293
01:34:38,055 --> 01:34:40,114
...who will use her child
as an excuse to back down...

1294
01:34:40,491 --> 01:34:42,015
I'm not that weak...

1295
01:34:42,226 --> 01:34:45,491
You are not weak...
Your relationship is...

1296
01:34:45,696 --> 01:34:48,256
You have to give it strength...
You have to give it time...

1297
01:34:48,466 --> 01:34:53,096
I will give this relationship nothing
till Dev gives it love...

1298
01:34:59,577 --> 01:35:00,339
You are going somewhere?

1299
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:06,148
Paris... Forten days...
To organize a few events...

1300
01:35:07,518 --> 01:35:08,780
Last night the things you said to her...

1301
01:35:08,986 --> 01:35:12,012
Last night I said a lot of things
I shouldn't have...

1302
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:15,787
...and a few that were very important to say...

1303
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:19,057
Try to understand her, Rishi...

1304
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:26,035
How do I understand a heart that
has no place for me?

1305
01:35:27,004 --> 01:35:31,100
That's not true, Rishi...
She loves you a lot...

1306
01:35:31,909 --> 01:35:37,609
Look into her eyes...
Who else can all that love be for?

1307
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:41,546
I wish the love in her eyes reached
her lips once in a while...

1308
01:35:42,119 --> 01:35:46,317
Dad, everyday I tell her how much
I love her... has she ever said it?

1309
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:57,296
Sorry, dad... I can't take it... Not anymore...

1310
01:36:14,785 --> 01:36:15,376
Now?

1311
01:36:19,390 --> 01:36:20,414
Now what, Dev?

1312
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:31,498
It was important to say that we love
each other... So we've said it...

1313
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:34,131
And what did we gain by saying it?

1314
01:36:35,406 --> 01:36:43,745
I don't know but if we hadn't,
we would have lost something...

1315
01:36:47,952 --> 01:36:51,820
You know Dev, that this
relationship has no future...

1316
01:36:52,022 --> 01:36:54,582
Yes... I know...

1317
01:36:57,761 --> 01:37:03,131
That's why it needs to be abandoned
on this beautiful note...

1318
01:37:13,677 --> 01:37:15,201
One last cup of coffee?

1319
01:37:18,182 --> 01:37:18,807
No...

1320
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:26,000
Yourtrain...
