1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,082
Yourtrain...

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:12,061
Not my train anymore...
I'm planning to stop traveling by train...

3
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:20,634
Buy myself a new car...
A nice new blue car...

4
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:38,058
You like blue? I like blue...

5
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:29,837
Your life is empty...
I can see it in your eyes...

6
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,912
Do you remember when we
touched each other?

7
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:36,677
Held hands? Anything? Do you remember?

8
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:41,353
I leave you at the station everyday
but yourthoughts never leave me...

9
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,992
To embrace each other's happiness and
pain, one has to embrace each other...

10
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,992
And you have neverfelt that way about me...

11
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:49,563
Since both of us are married...

12
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:51,900
...what are we doing at the station
in the middle of the night?

13
00:01:52,102 --> 00:01:58,701
You have to tell me today, Maya...
tell me the truth... Why did you marry me?

14
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:01,700
Sometimes friendship takes the place of love...

15
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:04,571
...and then there's no place left for love...

16
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:13,454
The truth is, that you never married me,
Maya... You compromised...

17
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,089
Listen to the answer, Maya...
I love you Maya...

18
00:02:20,363 --> 00:02:21,830
And you love me too...

19
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:28,365
And what if I find my soul mate
after marriage?

20
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,758
Dev...

21
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,009
I like blue...

22
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,990
Do you know when we reached here...?

23
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:05,892
I am yours and you, mine...

24
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:12,007
I'm wonderstruck at this moment...

25
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:18,078
When moonlight has emerged in
the middle of the day...

26
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:24,811
It seems awake yet it's dreaming...

27
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:29,720
My lovelorn heart...

28
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:35,455
Do you know when we reached here...?

29
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:42,233
I am yours and you, mine...

30
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:29,313
Intoxicated souls... Musky bodies...

31
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:35,355
There's a pureness in the air...

32
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:41,258
In this moment that we are in...
there's so much colour...

33
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:46,925
Spilling out of our eyes...

34
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:53,632
The blue sky showers on us...

35
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:58,542
Soft, silky rays of light...

36
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:04,209
Do you know when we reached here...?

37
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:10,289
I am yours and you, mine...

38
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:16,489
I'm wonderstruck at this moment...

39
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,298
When moonlight has emerged in
the middle of the day...

40
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:58,403
I was blissfully ignorant...

41
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:03,409
Of this love that flows forth unbridled...

42
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:10,109
True is this feeling... true is this love...

43
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,917
All else is just an illusion...

44
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:27,730
My heart slowly hums the
melodious notes of love...

45
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:33,534
Do you know when we reached here...?

46
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,311
I am yours and you, mine...

47
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:45,977
I'm wonderstruck at this moment...

48
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:51,456
When moonlight has emerged
in the middle of the day...

49
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:58,225
It seems awake yet it's dreaming...

50
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:03,770
My lovelorn heart...

51
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:38,931
We were crazy... We were strange...
We were different...

52
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:42,605
Very different... Incomplete on our
own but so complete together...

53
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:48,045
We were not walking on the ground...
There, we had slipped long ago...

54
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:51,911
We were flying in the sky...
Talking to the clouds...

55
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:56,490
We didn't have a care in the world...
We had made our own world...

56
00:08:56,692 --> 00:09:00,492
Our world... Maya and Dev's world...

57
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:05,030
The world of our dreams...

58
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:18,711
But then dreams always leave
when you wake up to reality...

59
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,507
come on, drink your milk fast...

60
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:24,549
I don't want to drink it... - Drink it!

61
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:27,347
Here... - It's ok...

62
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:29,190
It's ok, Dev... Thank you...

63
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:34,225
I don't know what to do, Sam...

64
00:09:35,364 --> 00:09:37,924
I was going to ask you for
advice and I come to know...

65
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:41,297
...that it's the same situation
in your house too... God!

66
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:43,436
Every house seems to have the same story...

67
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,137
Will you stop this TV soap commentary?

68
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:48,003
Sam... be serious for once...

69
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,441
What's the point of being serious... Look...

70
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:52,204
Your son is mule headed...

71
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:53,848
He is not going to do anything...

72
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:56,378
Maya isn't at fault so she
isn't going to do anything...

73
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:59,248
So what do we do, Kamlu?

74
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:01,623
I know... You do have a point...

75
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:04,884
Whatever needs to be done has to
be done by Rhea and Rishi...

76
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:09,827
But they are both being so stubborn...
Who will convince them?

77
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,659
What if they convince each other?

78
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:15,429
And why will they do that?
They hardly know each other...

79
00:10:15,638 --> 00:10:19,972
Precisely... two strangers...
same situation...

80
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:22,736
Then, friendship and problem solved...
remember?

81
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:25,879
But how will they meet each other?

82
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:28,816
Dad... What are we doing here?

83
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:30,542
I haven't bought you a present in a long time...

84
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,050
So I thought I'd do that today...

85
00:10:32,355 --> 00:10:34,653
Dude, it's a toy store...
- Yeah... So?

86
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:36,524
It's for kids...

87
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:40,929
But to me you will always be a kid...

88
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,621
Mom... Should I take this for Arjun?

89
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:46,164
Yes... take it... It's very nice... It's fantastic...

90
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:49,361
You have very good taste...
It's a fabulous dog... take it...

91
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:52,471
Dad... What did you have for breakfast?

92
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:54,074
I don't know...
I don't remember her name...

93
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:56,074
Ok... I'll take this...

94
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:59,243
God! What an awful red dog... Just leave it...

95
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:01,916
Kamaljit... What a surprise!

96
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:04,880
Oh Samarjit... So nice to see you here...

97
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,885
Of all the places in New York
we had to meet here...

98
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:11,058
coincidence... coincidence...
Just a coincidence...

99
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,817
How are you?

100
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:14,821
By the way what are you doing here?

101
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:17,966
We had come here to buy a
soft toy for my grandson...

102
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:20,226
...which he can cuddle upto in the night...

103
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:25,100
Even I was looking for something like that...
And I saw you...

104
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:30,442
Neither am I soft nor am I a toy...
So please stay away...

105
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:35,941
Much as I am enjoying this conversation...
can we please move on?

106
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:37,847
Of course... of course... of course...

107
00:11:38,154 --> 00:11:43,353
There are so many beautiful
things here... red... blue... green...

108
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,027
come on darling... help me get this one...

109
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:54,129
Don't you think that was weird behavior?

110
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:55,827
You think he was hitting on my mother-in-law?

111
00:11:56,038 --> 00:11:58,029
Oh no... you don't need to worry about that...

112
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,368
...he pretty much hits on anything that moves...

113
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:02,904
Ok I'm getting late... I have to go...

114
00:12:03,112 --> 00:12:05,012
Where are you heading?
- Work... 55th and 5th...

115
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:07,409
Oh great... I'll walk you... - Sure... - Alright...

116
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,977
Sam... I think it worked...

117
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:17,024
So... what did you say your name was?

118
00:12:17,226 --> 00:12:19,990
Charlotte... - charlotte... You are gorgeous!

119
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:24,296
Why are people so happy in New York?

120
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,162
Because they are not married... That's why...

121
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:29,436
Right... They are single...

122
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,231
No tension in life... No problem...

123
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,771
No stress...

124
00:12:33,276 --> 00:12:34,766
They go home... shower... freshen themselves...

125
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:36,877
Watch TV... then they go out and get lucky...

126
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,979
We... we go home and get unlucky...

127
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:41,411
True... We go home to a sourface...

128
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:43,778
That likes nothing... That likes no one...

129
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:46,580
Not even us... I mean look at us...

130
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:48,552
You are super sexy... I'm a super stud...

131
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:50,658
But have they ever complimented us?
- Never!

132
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:52,918
All the time whine... whine... whine...

133
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:54,096
Blah... blah... blah... blah...

134
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:56,629
On and on and on...
- And on and on and on...

135
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:58,026
My God, how they trouble us...

136
00:12:58,234 --> 00:12:58,859
How they sadden us...

137
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:01,263
Mock us... - Hurt us...

138
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:02,468
Why did we marry?

139
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:05,204
I know... Our brains were not working...

140
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:09,768
You know what? We should be single...

141
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:11,903
Yeah... Single...

142
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:12,978
Singles rock!

143
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,082
Single's the way to be... - I wanna be single...

144
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:16,546
I wanna be single too!

145
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,185
Single... - Single...

146
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:20,214
Single... - Single...

147
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:21,720
Single... - Single...

148
00:13:21,924 --> 00:13:23,084
And you know what? - What?

149
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:24,281
We... - Yes?

150
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:27,053
...are lying... - What?

151
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:30,525
I really love her...

152
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,562
I really love him, too!

153
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:34,293
I love you, Maya...

154
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:37,765
You have called me five times since morning...
What's the problem?

155
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:40,464
The problem is that my work is that kind...

156
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,168
I never have the time to express my feelings...

157
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,473
And I keep expressing my feelings all the time...

158
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:48,677
So what's stopping you today?

159
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:54,448
Nothing's stopping you either...

160
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:56,056
Do you like diamonds, Maya?

161
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:57,088
Diamonds?

162
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:59,420
Large, beautiful... expensive diamonds...

163
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:00,856
Yeah of course...

164
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:03,429
Good... tell your husband to buy them foryou...

165
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:04,530
Dev...

166
00:14:05,634 --> 00:14:07,499
I have bought you flowers...

167
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:11,866
call Dev... call him now...

168
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:16,911
Ok... I'll call him if you speak to Maya...

169
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:20,082
Why should I speak any longer?
I'm meeting you in five minutes...

170
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:22,546
Then speak to me forfour and a half minutes...

171
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:28,924
Voicemail!

172
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:37,725
Maya... I'm sulking and you aren't
even trying to make up...

173
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:41,092
come on... Show me you care...

174
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:45,468
...say or do something which
shows that you are mine...

175
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:51,235
Only mine... Maya... Miss you!

176
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:57,578
Hey, Dev... Look we have to talk...
It's gone too far...

177
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,344
I don't want to fight anymore...

178
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:03,321
If you want the same then show me a sign...

179
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:11,328
Just a sign... come on let's make this work...
I love you...

180
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:14,501
See you later...

181
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:15,362
Bye...

182
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,205
Dev... You? Here?

183
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:37,136
Ljust got out of the station...

184
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:39,813
And these flowers?

185
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:47,787
Foryou...

186
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,157
That's sweet!

187
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:00,993
I'll see you later at home...

188
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:04,065
Yeah... Bye...

189
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,840
Flowers have their own language...

190
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:24,577
...they say so much silently... Right?

191
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:41,469
I asked for just one sign...
And got so many...

192
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:56,976
Missed you... - Yeah!

193
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:01,316
Where's Arjun?

194
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:04,856
Oh... he must have gone to
his violin class... Right?

195
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:08,254
He's quit the violin...

196
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:12,425
Quit violin? Why?

197
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:17,938
He thinks his violin is the
reason for ourfights...

198
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,126
What an idiot I have given birth to?

199
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:51,370
Sorry, Papa...

200
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:54,736
Shut up! There's no reason to say sorry...

201
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:56,274
There's no reason to quit violin...

202
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:58,241
...and there is absolutely
no reason to play football...

203
00:20:58,547 --> 00:21:02,449
And that is the coach's order... Ok? Say ok...

204
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:03,208
Ok...

205
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:09,022
No more football...
Anyone can play the football...

206
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:19,156
Even I can... really...
But only cool dudes play the violin...

207
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:25,873
Right? And you are the coolest... ok?

208
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:30,137
You can play violin as much
as you want from today...

209
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:32,073
Play it day and night... Wheneveryou want...

210
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:35,717
I won't say anything... You know why?

211
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:36,543
Why?

212
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:42,454
I'll show you... because now I have this...

213
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:49,892
Go on play the violin... I don't hear nothing...

214
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:53,564
Papa... can I hug you?

215
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:55,865
What?

216
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:57,400
Can I hug you?

217
00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:03,103
No... because I'm going to hug you...

218
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,907
And I have another idea...
We will make an eleven memberteam...

219
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:10,914
You play the violin in the forward position...

220
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,484
Violin doesn't have a forward...

221
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:13,677
What nonsense...

222
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:17,723
And our band will be called Manchester
United Philharmonic... Ok?

223
00:22:49,892 --> 00:22:52,292
Rishi... all this... - May I?

224
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,591
I cleaned the entire house...

225
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:06,530
It took three hours... the food's ready...
really...

226
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:10,738
With these very hands I phoned
and called forfood...

227
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:13,405
But it's the thought that counts, right? - Right...

228
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:18,381
And that's not all... This whole weekend...

229
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:26,894
You and me... All day and all night... for hours...

230
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:30,658
we will... with each other...

231
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:36,327
Discuss things...
Whateveryou want we shall discuss...

232
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:43,506
I'm sorry, Maya...
Forthat night...

233
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:49,141
Sometimes you make mistakes in love...

234
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:51,244
Yeah...

235
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:13,604
Dev... Who are you talking to? Come in...
Ok come on... one more...

236
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:22,781
Sorry... I couldn't take your calls...

237
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:23,917
Rishi was with me the whole weekend...

238
00:24:24,152 --> 00:24:26,814
Don't worry... It's alright... I tried just once...

239
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:29,724
But I got 15 missed calls...

240
00:24:29,925 --> 00:24:32,155
The numbers get dialed accidentally...

241
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:34,154
How was the weekend?

242
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:37,821
Very good...
I spent a lot of time with Rhea and Arjun...

243
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:41,799
It was fun... After all family is family...

244
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:46,300
We even went shopping...
Rhea bought a lovely dress...

245
00:24:46,508 --> 00:24:49,477
Quite sexy... Rhea looked very good in it...

246
00:24:49,678 --> 00:24:52,112
Of course... Rhea is a beautiful woman...

247
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:55,839
She looks good in anything she wears...
So what did you do today?

248
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:57,109
Same as everyday...

249
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:00,846
I had lunch with George Bush and
now I'm off for coffee with Madonna...

250
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:02,784
Stupid bloody questions...

251
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:07,451
Look, I don't know what your problem is
but I don't want to fight with you...

252
00:25:07,662 --> 00:25:09,596
Anyway, I'm going out with Rishi...

253
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:12,491
There seems to be a sudden
bout of love for Rishi...?

254
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:16,159
Yeah... After all family is family... Right?

255
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:19,162
So, Rishi is taking you to meet
the rest of his family at the zoo?

256
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:20,636
Rishi is taking me to the ballet...

257
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:24,505
Ballet? Where men dance without underwear?
Rishi likes all that stuff?

258
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:26,442
Not Rishi... I like ballet...

259
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:29,913
Ballet is music, dance, poetry... I love the ballet...

260
00:25:30,452 --> 00:25:32,044
You like strange things...

261
00:25:32,254 --> 00:25:34,779
Yeah... Nothing can be more strange than you...

262
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:38,750
Enjoy your ballet... ballet!

263
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:43,662
Dev... I hope you are well... - I am... Why?

264
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:45,799
First the flowers... Now the ballet...
You all right?

265
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:46,990
I'm alright, thank you...

266
00:25:47,402 --> 00:25:50,701
Maybe you are falling in love...
with me all over again...

267
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,605
Will you excuse me for a moment...
I will join you...

268
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,675
Hey... isn't that... Dev? And... Rhea... yeah...

269
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:08,422
Hey, Rhea... Are you following me?

270
00:26:08,857 --> 00:26:09,653
I don't know about you guys...

271
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:15,956
...but I'm following your wife for sure...
Hey... Hey...

272
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:18,162
Hi Rhea... - Hi...

273
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:19,128
So how are you guys?

274
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:20,665
Oh we are good... we are good...

275
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:22,769
So even you have come here
to appease your wife?

276
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:23,767
Ballet can be so boring...

277
00:26:23,972 --> 00:26:30,207
Boring? Ballet is not boring...
Ballet is music, dance, poetry...

278
00:26:30,412 --> 00:26:35,679
I love the ballet... Maya...
Do you love the ballet?

279
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:38,678
Yeah... Lovely dress, Rhea...

280
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:41,219
Thank you... It's Dev's choice...

281
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:42,953
You've got very good taste...

282
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:48,219
Thank you... You look beautiful too...
But a little less than Rhea...

283
00:26:49,131 --> 00:26:51,895
Just the way you look a little
less handsome than Rishi...

284
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,294
Oh yes...

285
00:26:53,502 --> 00:26:57,905
Wow Maya! A compliment afteryears!
Not bad... not bad...

286
00:26:58,106 --> 00:27:01,735
Same here... Dev, you need to be
taken to the doctortomorrow for sure...

287
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:03,877
come on lets go...
I don't want to miss the ballet...

288
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,104
I wanna pee... Excuse me... Excuse me...

289
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:07,303
I love the ballet... come on move...

290
00:27:07,516 --> 00:27:08,710
I'm sorry...

291
00:27:09,784 --> 00:27:12,810
Ok... Told you he was on drugs...

292
00:29:49,444 --> 00:29:53,312
What were we doing?
What were we doing last night?

293
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:56,240
We were playing with theirfeelings...

294
00:29:57,852 --> 00:30:00,343
Forthe first time I felt hatred for myself...

295
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:01,949
How could I do this to Rishi?

296
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:03,749
Feeling bad for him?

297
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,025
You must have felt guilty last night too...

298
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:08,661
So what did you do to get rid of your guilt?

299
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:13,891
What did you do?
Did you allow him to touch you?

300
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,430
Where did he touch you? Here? Here? Here?

301
00:30:20,842 --> 00:30:23,902
Did he touch you here?

302
00:30:24,112 --> 00:30:27,309
Stop it, Dev... Just stop it...
You think I don't feel bad?

303
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:30,746
That my love spends nights with
someone else? But I bear it...

304
00:30:30,952 --> 00:30:34,513
I can't bear it... I can't bear it...

305
00:30:34,723 --> 00:30:38,420
You will have to...
because our relationship is a dream...

306
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,127
...that shatters every time we reach home...
And that's the truth...

307
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:47,859
I can't accept this truth... I can't bear it...

308
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:52,003
I can't bear it... I can't bearto see you with him...

309
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:56,004
You are mine... Just mine...

310
00:30:57,145 --> 00:30:59,010
Then how come he has a greater right...

311
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:02,405
Your heart is mine but you have his name...

312
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:07,953
I can't bear it... You are mine...

313
00:31:08,156 --> 00:31:09,623
Dev, what are you doing?

314
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:27,836
Buddy... On the eve of your wedding...

315
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:30,875
...ljust want to say that marriage is beautiful...

316
00:31:31,112 --> 00:31:34,741
It gives you that special someone
who you trust more than yourself...

317
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:37,816
Trust me, dude... being married is the
world's greatest feeling...

318
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:56,763
To Diva... Finally the NO.1 magazine...

319
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,307
Ok girls, from now on we have a new policy...

320
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:03,170
No more late nights...
no more ignoring your husbands...

321
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:06,541
Trust me... what's most important is this...

322
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:20,790
Rishi... I don't know who's following whom here...

323
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:23,225
Oh who cares? I'm celebrating...

324
00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:24,489
So am I...

325
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:27,361
But only you and me know the
real reason why we are celebrating...

326
00:32:29,537 --> 00:32:31,596
So? Singles still rock?

327
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:33,938
Naaaaa...

328
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,858
Dance all night... Wanna dance all night?

329
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:01,535
Do you feel alright? Wanna dance all night...

330
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:13,072
Dance all night... Wanna dance all night?

331
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:15,945
Do you feel alright? Wanna dance all night...

332
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:27,053
Dance all night... Wanna dance all night?

333
00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:30,823
Do you feel alright? Wanna dance all night...

334
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,472
Beautiful moments...

335
00:33:49,684 --> 00:33:53,085
Pretty as peach...

336
00:33:53,288 --> 00:33:56,746
Weaving these dreamy days...

337
00:33:56,958 --> 00:34:00,359
And dreamy nights...

338
00:34:00,562 --> 00:34:04,020
Melody of the heart echoes...

339
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:07,599
The breezy song of the soul...

340
00:34:07,802 --> 00:34:11,101
And all the loved ones sway to the tune...

341
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:14,935
So let's dance all night...

342
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:17,771
Where's the party tonight?

343
00:34:18,813 --> 00:34:21,509
Where's the party tonight?

344
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,940
Weaving these dreamy days...

345
00:34:24,152 --> 00:34:25,847
And dreamy nights...

346
00:34:26,054 --> 00:34:28,614
Where's the party tonight?

347
00:34:37,332 --> 00:34:39,766
Dance all night... Wanna dance all night?

348
00:34:40,335 --> 00:34:43,736
Do you feel alright? Wanna dance all night...

349
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:29,380
The one I dreamt of...

350
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:31,449
The one who drove me crazy...

351
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:35,020
Today he is mine...

352
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:36,690
Like the flowerthat I yearned for...

353
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:38,654
Like the fragrance that I craved for...

354
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,352
He has blossomed in my arms...

355
00:35:42,563 --> 00:35:45,999
The path is filled with fragrance of love...

356
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,636
Intoxicated are all eyes around...

357
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:53,295
Dreams weave a web around all of us...

358
00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:56,966
So let's dance all night...

359
00:35:57,178 --> 00:35:59,806
Where's the party tonight?

360
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:03,510
Where's the party tonight?

361
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:06,012
Weaving these dreamy days...

362
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,881
And dreamy nights...

363
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:10,751
Where's the party tonight?

364
00:36:12,627 --> 00:36:14,458
Dance all night...

365
00:36:14,662 --> 00:36:15,822
Dance all night...

366
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:22,800
Dance... Dance all night

367
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:42,185
My story goes like this...

368
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,187
The one who I yearn for...

369
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:47,850
Has fallen for me...

370
00:36:48,062 --> 00:36:49,427
The queen of my heart...

371
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,932
Has my story on her lips...

372
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:59,129
Happy ending is in sight...

373
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,434
I have got a sign...

374
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:05,908
Life dances in mirth...

375
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:09,777
So let's dance all night...

376
00:37:09,984 --> 00:37:12,509
Where's the party tonight?

377
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:16,317
Where's the party tonight?

378
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:18,849
Weaving these dreamy days...

379
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,687
And dreamy nights...

380
00:37:20,895 --> 00:37:23,420
Where's the party tonight?

381
00:37:24,665 --> 00:37:27,259
Where's the party tonight?

382
00:37:28,169 --> 00:37:30,831
Where's the party tonight?

383
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:33,430
Weaving these dreamy days...

384
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:35,199
And dreamy nights...

385
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:38,173
Where's the party tonight?

386
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:13,574
Dad... Who's house is this?

387
00:39:13,774 --> 00:39:15,571
You know Kamaljit...
It's her birthday today...

388
00:39:15,776 --> 00:39:17,243
So I thought I'd invite herfor dinner...

389
00:39:17,445 --> 00:39:19,072
If you are with me she will
take me more seriously...

390
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,905
Kamaljit?

391
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:26,413
Kamaljit... That... Dev... Dev...
Dev's mother...

392
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:31,857
Rhea... Who is it?

393
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:37,588
Many happy returns of the day...

394
00:39:37,798 --> 00:39:38,765
Thank you, Sam...

395
00:39:38,966 --> 00:39:41,434
Happy birthday, aunty...
- Thank you... What a surprise!

396
00:39:41,636 --> 00:39:45,094
I'm full of surprises...
So how old is chandigarh?

397
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:47,331
Beauty has no age, Sam...

398
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:51,443
Really? Anyway let's get to the point... Kamal...

399
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:53,776
I'd like to throw a party foryou tonight...

400
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:55,778
No... I don't trust your parties...

401
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:58,110
...the next thing I know there'll be nude girls...

402
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:01,550
So you can join them too...
Just kidding... Just kidding...

403
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:03,957
Seriously, it will just be family... Ourfamilies...

404
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:04,453
No...

405
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:08,288
come on... Listen... hey, Rhea... come on...

406
00:40:08,496 --> 00:40:08,962
Dad!

407
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:43,660
Our wedding pictures...
God, we were so drunk...

408
00:40:44,298 --> 00:40:45,925
You know what I am saying to Dev here?

409
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:49,664
Now that the vows are made,
I'll kill you if you don't stick to them...

410
00:40:52,707 --> 00:40:57,610
This one's my favourite...
When Arjun was born...

411
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:01,341
I have never seen Dev so happy...

412
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:06,779
Rhea... I'm leaving... I...

413
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:08,615
Hey, Dev... Look who's here...

414
00:41:09,724 --> 00:41:10,452
Hi...

415
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:12,525
Hey...

416
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,029
Ok... All's settled...
Dinner at my place... Sharp 8...

417
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,858
Hi... And yes you are invited too...

418
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:21,534
But if you are busy we shall understand...

419
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:22,202
Sam...

420
00:41:22,403 --> 00:41:24,371
Just kidding sweetheart... Bye... see you...

421
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:29,366
You seem to have settled down here...
Should we?

422
00:41:29,677 --> 00:41:30,541
Bye...

423
00:41:30,745 --> 00:41:31,541
Maya...

424
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,547
can I have Dev back please?

425
00:41:39,754 --> 00:41:40,721
Photo, Maya...

426
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,057
Sorry... - That's ok...

427
00:42:13,387 --> 00:42:14,411
Fill it up... Fill it up...

428
00:42:14,622 --> 00:42:16,419
Dude... ease up on the wine...

429
00:42:16,624 --> 00:42:21,493
Relax... Ladies and gentlemen...
Attention please...

430
00:42:23,564 --> 00:42:27,432
I have an announcement to make...
I'm getting married...

431
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:31,929
To Kamal...

432
00:42:32,807 --> 00:42:33,432
What?

433
00:42:36,143 --> 00:42:39,112
That's the expression I wanted to see...

434
00:42:40,147 --> 00:42:41,774
Sam... What are you doing?

435
00:42:41,982 --> 00:42:42,949
Just joking...

436
00:42:44,652 --> 00:42:47,951
You know we have to do something
about your son's sense of humour...

437
00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:50,284
Smile my son... Smile...

438
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:54,290
You won't die if you do... And even
if you die, you will die with a smile...

439
00:42:57,264 --> 00:43:01,462
Sam... it's a five course meal
with a preset menu...

440
00:43:01,669 --> 00:43:03,398
Thank you... Are you on the menu?

441
00:43:03,938 --> 00:43:05,633
No... but my grandmother is...

442
00:43:07,174 --> 00:43:11,975
Well done... At last there's someone
who can shut you up...

443
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:17,483
Tell me Rishi, was he always like this or
is this change recent?

444
00:43:17,785 --> 00:43:21,084
He behaves like a tiger now but
he was a mouse before my mother...

445
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:22,312
Rishi... behave...

446
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,252
His mother was a very strict woman...

447
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,760
She used to say, 'you can look...
but don't you dare touch!'

448
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,999
And these days there's no time to look...
Too busy touching...

449
00:43:37,972 --> 00:43:38,768
Very bad...

450
00:43:39,406 --> 00:43:41,636
Oh Mom... I really hope you are not listening...

451
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:43,503
Your Mom and her rules...

452
00:43:43,878 --> 00:43:46,676
It's not about rules, Mr. Talwar...
It's about limits...

453
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:49,346
It's very easy to slip in a marriage...

454
00:43:49,984 --> 00:43:52,509
It's difficult to keep control...

455
00:43:53,287 --> 00:43:55,915
I personally feel every relationship
should have its boundaries...

456
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:59,357
And I believe more the boundaries...

457
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,858
...more the chances of them being crossed...

458
00:44:02,897 --> 00:44:05,297
Well... I don't really agree with you...

459
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,130
Maya you tell me... What do you think?

460
00:44:12,673 --> 00:44:15,540
Maya doesn't need to draw any boundaries...

461
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,037
...because her husband loves hertoo much...

462
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:23,205
Flattery... Flattery... When a man uses
flattery it only means two things...

463
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:26,045
Either he is lying or he is hiding something...

464
00:44:26,253 --> 00:44:30,383
Really... These days Dev is flattering me a lot...

465
00:44:30,658 --> 00:44:32,057
You think I need to worry...

466
00:44:34,195 --> 00:44:42,068
Actually you should... Everyone's
been speaking a lot...

467
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:43,497
About relationships...

468
00:44:44,205 --> 00:44:45,570
But relationships are not about words...

469
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,339
...they are about circumstances...

470
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:52,238
No one knows why one slips in a relationship...

471
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:56,575
Why one falls in love outside a relationship...

472
00:44:57,885 --> 00:45:03,983
No one knows... Even I don't know
why it happened with me...

473
00:45:07,628 --> 00:45:20,871
But it did... Rhea, I am in love
with someone else...

474
00:45:23,477 --> 00:45:26,275
I'm sorry, Rhea but that's the truth...

475
00:45:33,654 --> 00:45:39,957
And the woman I fell in love with is right here...

476
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,024
Right here.

477
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,364
It's Maya...

478
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:15,495
What happened, Mr. Talwar?

479
00:46:15,863 --> 00:46:22,666
No sense of humour? I was just joking...

480
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:28,997
Dev... That really wasn't funny...
I was going to kill you...

481
00:46:29,276 --> 00:46:33,076
I was going to kill him before you...
You are a bit crazy...

482
00:46:38,118 --> 00:46:43,522
Good joke... Good joke...

483
00:46:51,732 --> 00:46:53,427
What was wrong with you last night?

484
00:46:53,734 --> 00:46:54,758
What were you saying?

485
00:46:56,236 --> 00:46:57,294
You said whateveryou felt like...

486
00:46:57,504 --> 00:46:58,869
Did you think of me even once
while saying all those things?

487
00:46:59,073 --> 00:47:00,540
Now who will answer Rishi's questions?

488
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:03,369
You... Who else? Just tell him the truth...
I don't care...

489
00:47:03,577 --> 00:47:06,876
Tell him the truth? Then what Dev?

490
00:47:07,247 --> 00:47:08,043
Leave the house?

491
00:47:08,248 --> 00:47:12,651
And come to you? Will you leave Rhea
and your son? Tell me...

492
00:47:12,986 --> 00:47:16,547
No... I don't think so... - I thought so...

493
00:47:21,095 --> 00:47:24,064
Dev, don't touch me... Dev... just leave me.

494
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:07,036
You were right, Dev...

495
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:12,277
You never know what you'll get to
see outside this station...

496
00:48:27,561 --> 00:48:28,118
Let's go...

497
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:48,575
It's all so dirty... Not been cleaned
for so many days...

498
00:48:48,816 --> 00:48:50,784
Will you have coffee? What were you saying?

499
00:48:51,018 --> 00:48:56,854
Coffee? No... This Rishi...
he just keeps anything anywhere...

500
00:48:57,024 --> 00:49:00,653
...he's moved everything around...
Dad, you'll have tea?

501
00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:03,159
Oh... you never have tea... I'm crazy...

502
00:49:03,363 --> 00:49:05,490
What am I saying? Just need to clean all this...

503
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:27,576
You are late?

504
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:33,510
Yes... Too late...

505
00:51:38,352 --> 00:51:39,080
Dude...

506
00:51:47,427 --> 00:51:49,327
Any message for Mom?

507
00:52:04,211 --> 00:52:05,337
Rishi... - Maya...

508
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,035
I wanted to apologise, Dad...

509
00:52:39,012 --> 00:52:42,140
But apologies are for mistakes...

510
00:52:46,753 --> 00:52:52,123
What's the punishment for selfishness?

511
00:52:57,931 --> 00:52:59,228
I'm a father...

512
00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:06,801
I can't punish... I can only advise...

513
00:53:11,945 --> 00:53:13,071
Leave Rishi...

514
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,674
You don't love him...

515
00:53:23,557 --> 00:53:24,717
By being with him like this...

516
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:27,416
...you are keeping him away from his true love...

517
00:53:28,795 --> 00:53:30,092
And yourself too...

518
00:53:33,934 --> 00:53:39,600
These incomplete relationships will
bring happiness to no one...

519
00:53:40,307 --> 00:53:42,832
Dad!

520
00:53:46,246 --> 00:53:48,271
It's not yourfault, Maya...

521
00:53:54,154 --> 00:54:03,358
Love and death... both come uninvited...

522
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:08,360
No one has any control overthem...

523
00:54:36,129 --> 00:54:43,661
He's going away... He's not going to make it...

524
00:54:49,776 --> 00:54:51,835
I don't want to lose my Dad, Maya...

525
00:55:01,221 --> 00:55:02,688
Thank God I have you...

526
00:55:14,301 --> 00:55:15,768
chandigarh...

527
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,388
We knew this was the end of our journey...

528
00:55:44,064 --> 00:55:47,659
These were the last few
breaths of our love story...

529
00:55:47,968 --> 00:55:49,799
We had to collect these moments...

530
00:55:50,036 --> 00:55:54,496
...and breathe a new life into
our old relationships...

531
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:57,036
It was time to go home...

532
00:55:57,744 --> 00:56:01,145
We had to tell Rishi and Rhea the truth...

533
00:56:01,548 --> 00:56:06,008
Because happiness can never bloom
in the shadow of lies...

534
00:56:06,753 --> 00:56:09,153
No one knew this betterthan us...

535
00:57:11,351 --> 00:57:12,045
Rhea...

536
00:57:18,758 --> 00:57:23,218
There's another woman in my life...

537
00:57:24,364 --> 00:57:25,558
That's not funny anymore...

538
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:28,998
I'm not joking...

539
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:34,404
Forthe last six months...

540
00:57:39,379 --> 00:57:45,181
But it's over now...

541
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,316
Maya...

542
00:57:53,626 --> 00:57:57,619
Why it happened... I don't have any answers...

543
00:58:04,571 --> 00:58:14,503
But I want to give our marriage
another chance...

544
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,117
Do you love her?

545
00:58:22,489 --> 00:58:24,218
How does it matter?

546
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,325
It matters to me...

547
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:40,030
If I had to do what you did...
would you forgive me?

548
00:58:46,513 --> 00:58:50,745
You wouldn't, Dev...
You would neverforgive me...

549
00:59:08,568 --> 00:59:15,940
You will have to leave this house...
This marriage is over...

550
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:39,261
Rishi... Listen to me...

551
00:59:41,067 --> 00:59:48,701
Listen to me... Rishi... Rishi...

552
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,376
Did you sleep with him?

553
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:05,915
You slept with him? Tell me, Maya...

554
01:00:07,093 --> 01:00:11,120
How was it? Was it fun?

555
01:00:11,331 --> 01:00:18,464
Did you have fun? Tell me...

556
01:00:21,074 --> 01:00:22,735
Tell me...

557
01:00:27,013 --> 01:00:31,473
How strange Maya, that you kept
cleaning this house all the time...

558
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:35,080
...and today you have brought in so much filth...

559
01:00:35,355 --> 01:00:37,380
Don't say that, Rishi...
- Then what should I say?

560
01:00:39,526 --> 01:00:40,515
What should I do?

561
01:00:43,363 --> 01:00:44,523
Celebrate?

562
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:52,834
Should I celebrate that my wife is
sleeping with another man?

563
01:01:00,113 --> 01:01:10,489
I'm sorry, Rishi... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

564
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:12,123
Why did you do this...

565
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,462
Why did you do this to me, Maya?

566
01:01:24,304 --> 01:01:26,772
I loved you so much...

567
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:32,205
More than my own self...

568
01:01:33,346 --> 01:01:34,836
More than life...

569
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:42,980
But it wasn't enough foryou, right?

570
01:01:43,223 --> 01:01:44,053
It's not like that, Rishi...

571
01:01:44,257 --> 01:01:45,724
Then how is it, Maya?

572
01:01:53,733 --> 01:02:01,868
Every morning I woke up
to look into your eyes...

573
01:02:07,046 --> 01:02:08,843
To search for my face...

574
01:02:17,156 --> 01:02:19,283
But now I will only see him...

575
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:30,030
And I will not be able to bearthat...

576
01:02:32,805 --> 01:02:35,296
But that relationship is over, Rishi...

577
01:02:38,645 --> 01:02:40,442
This relationship is over, Maya...

578
01:03:02,435 --> 01:03:03,902
Then I'll leave...?

579
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:10,206
I won't stop you...

580
01:03:31,197 --> 01:03:32,926
Try not to hate me, Arjun...

581
01:03:48,748 --> 01:03:54,983
Rhea... I want to say something to you...

582
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:01,992
Dev didn't ask me before stepping
out of this marriage...

583
01:04:02,995 --> 01:04:05,862
Neither did you ask me
before throwing him out...

584
01:04:06,733 --> 01:04:12,672
But my grandson's eyes ask me
whether I'm going to leave him...

585
01:04:15,842 --> 01:04:17,469
I can't do that, Rhea...

586
01:04:19,712 --> 01:04:21,771
So if you have no objections...

587
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:24,942
I would like to stay with you...

588
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,348
can I?

589
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:52,665
Hello... hello...

590
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:57,307
Dev...

591
01:05:59,479 --> 01:06:00,446
Maya...

592
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,281
Yeah... Got dialled by mistake...

593
01:06:06,352 --> 01:06:07,649
Are you ok?

594
01:06:12,692 --> 01:06:16,287
Did you... Tell Rishi... Rishi?

595
01:06:16,496 --> 01:06:19,727
I told Rishi everything...

596
01:06:20,132 --> 01:06:21,622
What did he say?

597
01:06:21,834 --> 01:06:23,267
He was very angry at first...

598
01:06:23,836 --> 01:06:28,273
But with time I know he will forgive me...

599
01:06:29,775 --> 01:06:32,938
He's a good man...

600
01:06:36,182 --> 01:06:37,171
And Rhea?

601
01:06:38,317 --> 01:06:48,522
Even she will forgive me with time...
After all family is family...

602
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:51,188
Yeah... Family is family...

603
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:57,392
Yeah Rhea... I'm coming...

604
01:06:58,804 --> 01:07:02,501
Even I am at home... with Rishi...

605
01:07:04,877 --> 01:07:05,935
Be happy...

606
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:25,288
Goodbye...

607
01:07:26,766 --> 01:07:30,725
All our relationships were
defined by this one word...

608
01:07:31,437 --> 01:07:35,737
Both of us left our homes and
didn't even tell each other about it...

609
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:41,370
I had never seen the hope of meeting again...

610
01:07:41,581 --> 01:07:43,674
...die such a silent death before...

611
01:08:22,521 --> 01:08:27,823
Your heart knows...

612
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:34,630
And so does mine...

613
01:08:35,334 --> 01:08:47,508
That our roads are meant to part...

614
01:08:48,114 --> 01:08:54,246
Far apart though we will be...

615
01:08:54,453 --> 01:09:00,050
Please don't go away from my memories...

616
01:09:00,259 --> 01:09:06,494
Never say goodbye...

617
01:09:06,699 --> 01:09:12,831
Never say goodbye...

618
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:19,410
Never say goodbye...

619
01:10:03,489 --> 01:10:07,448
Hi, Good morning. - Hi Miss.

620
01:10:09,628 --> 01:10:15,692
My name is Maya Tal... My name is Maya.

621
01:10:16,869 --> 01:10:22,398
All the mirth in life has slipped away slowly...

622
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:28,973
It's the pain that refuses to go away...

623
01:10:29,515 --> 01:10:35,476
Tried to wish it away...
tried to laugh it away...

624
01:10:35,888 --> 01:10:41,758
But the heart fails to find peace...

625
01:10:42,228 --> 01:10:44,628
...fails to find peace...

626
01:10:45,131 --> 01:10:50,694
Are these tears? Or is it cinder?

627
01:10:51,437 --> 01:10:56,966
No... Just fire that flows freely from my eyes...

628
01:10:57,309 --> 01:11:02,838
Never say goodbye...

629
01:11:03,682 --> 01:11:09,643
Never say goodbye...

630
01:11:10,089 --> 01:11:16,460
Never say goodbye...

631
01:12:13,853 --> 01:12:19,655
Seasons come... and seasons go...

632
01:12:19,892 --> 01:12:25,922
But the season of pain is here to stay...

633
01:12:26,465 --> 01:12:32,301
The shade of sorrow is so deep...

634
01:12:32,738 --> 01:12:41,806
That it will take a while to pale...

635
01:12:42,014 --> 01:12:47,816
Who knows what's to happen ahead...

636
01:12:48,254 --> 01:12:53,988
Who knows what's in store for us to bear...

637
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:57,286
Never say goodbye...

638
01:13:00,532 --> 01:13:06,664
Never say goodbye...

639
01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:12,936
Never say goodbye...

640
01:13:14,113 --> 01:13:19,210
Your heart knows...

641
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:26,021
And so does mine...

642
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:38,761
That our roads are meant to part...

643
01:13:39,471 --> 01:13:45,603
Far apart though we will be...

644
01:13:45,978 --> 01:13:51,678
Please don't go away from my memories...

645
01:13:51,884 --> 01:13:57,186
Never say goodbye...

646
01:13:58,157 --> 01:14:04,153
Never say goodbye...

647
01:14:04,697 --> 01:14:10,727
Never say goodbye...

648
01:14:11,103 --> 01:14:17,064
Never say goodbye...

649
01:14:17,443 --> 01:14:28,479
Never say goodbye...

650
01:14:55,447 --> 01:14:56,277
Thanks...

651
01:15:17,803 --> 01:15:21,534
Do you know Maya, that in these three
years, I tried hard to hate you...

652
01:15:22,641 --> 01:15:27,374
To forget you... but I couldn't...

653
01:15:30,649 --> 01:15:31,911
...couldn't do it, Maya...

654
01:15:36,155 --> 01:15:41,218
You gave up the house, but the house
could never give you up...

655
01:15:43,996 --> 01:15:47,557
You were right... I was a child...

656
01:15:47,933 --> 01:15:53,166
I could never understand you...
And that I realize today...

657
01:15:58,010 --> 01:15:59,307
I have grown up, Maya...

658
01:16:06,218 --> 01:16:07,810
I am in love again...

659
01:16:10,389 --> 01:16:11,754
I'm getting married...

660
01:16:16,795 --> 01:16:17,955
Won't you say anything?

661
01:16:24,369 --> 01:16:25,961
I'm very happy foryou...

662
01:16:33,979 --> 01:16:35,276
Her name is catherine...

663
01:16:41,253 --> 01:16:43,983
And I want you to be the best man
at my wedding, Maya...

664
01:16:53,832 --> 01:17:02,297
I don't have anyone besides you...
You are my family...

665
01:17:04,676 --> 01:17:09,443
Always have been... always will be...

666
01:17:24,496 --> 01:17:25,724
This is foryou.

667
01:17:30,169 --> 01:17:30,931
Dad!

668
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:43,045
Wherever he is... he is with us...

669
01:17:51,056 --> 01:17:52,353
...he is with you...

670
01:18:07,773 --> 01:18:11,265
Jai... I'm not ready yet...

671
01:18:15,581 --> 01:18:18,049
I am being a motherto my
son after many years...

672
01:18:19,017 --> 01:18:24,546
At this point I'm happy with this
one relationship... And...

673
01:18:24,756 --> 01:18:27,657
You don't have to say anything...

674
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,526
Ijust want you to know that
I'll be waiting... Ok?

675
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:40,070
I'm sorry... Ijust came to say 'Bye'...

676
01:18:40,606 --> 01:18:43,302
Rhea... You just get ready...
I'll wait foryou outside...

677
01:18:45,577 --> 01:18:48,637
And good luck with your job in canada...

678
01:18:57,022 --> 01:18:58,546
What time is yourtrain?

679
01:19:00,392 --> 01:19:02,485
In two hours...

680
01:19:10,902 --> 01:19:11,527
Arjun...

681
01:19:11,737 --> 01:19:15,833
I know... I met Mom...

682
01:19:16,642 --> 01:19:18,837
He probably forgot that I was leaving today...

683
01:19:20,312 --> 01:19:27,081
Rhea... I have lost my right to
ask you forforgiveness...

684
01:19:30,989 --> 01:19:33,457
...but I don't want to lose the
right to bless you...

685
01:19:45,003 --> 01:19:46,698
Have a good life...

686
01:19:48,874 --> 01:19:50,068
You stay in touch...

687
01:20:08,427 --> 01:20:09,655
God! Rhea... We are really late...

688
01:20:09,861 --> 01:20:10,885
I'm so sorry, Jai...

689
01:20:11,096 --> 01:20:12,222
Don't worry about it...

690
01:20:14,666 --> 01:20:17,430
Jai... I'm going to kill you...
You missed the ceremony...

691
01:20:17,636 --> 01:20:19,934
Not my fault, sweetheart... Blame it on Rhea...

692
01:20:20,138 --> 01:20:21,435
congratulations...

693
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,835
Rhea... It's so nice to finally meet you...

694
01:20:24,042 --> 01:20:25,634
Jai talks about you all the time...

695
01:20:25,844 --> 01:20:26,708
Well I hope good things...

696
01:20:26,912 --> 01:20:30,678
Of course... You haven't met
my husband... Sweetheart?

697
01:20:33,552 --> 01:20:35,520
Come meet my oldest friend
in the world... This is...

698
01:20:35,721 --> 01:20:37,484
Rhea... - Rishi?

699
01:20:37,689 --> 01:20:39,247
Great... You know each other?

700
01:20:40,359 --> 01:20:41,018
Yes... We do...

701
01:20:41,226 --> 01:20:43,194
congratulations... You are a lucky man...

702
01:20:43,395 --> 01:20:43,861
Thank you...

703
01:20:44,062 --> 01:20:45,495
Jai you are never going to
believe who's in town...

704
01:20:45,697 --> 01:20:47,858
Honey... we'll see you later... Rhea...

705
01:20:48,066 --> 01:20:48,760
See you in a bit...

706
01:20:51,236 --> 01:20:55,605
Rishi? Your wedding? What about Maya?

707
01:20:55,874 --> 01:20:58,900
Maya and I separated three years ago...

708
01:21:01,046 --> 01:21:04,413
And you here? With Jai?

709
01:21:04,883 --> 01:21:07,351
Dev and I divorced three years ago...

710
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:18,062
But do Dev and Maya know this?

711
01:21:41,686 --> 01:21:51,084
Maya... What's the matter Maya?

712
01:21:51,797 --> 01:21:56,131
Can't look me in the eye... can't face me...

713
01:21:56,701 --> 01:22:01,832
Because you broke my heart? My home?

714
01:22:04,309 --> 01:22:06,539
How could you break something
that was already broken, Maya?

715
01:22:07,779 --> 01:22:12,682
Maybe you shouldn't have filled
the void between Dev and me...

716
01:22:14,453 --> 01:22:18,947
But what could you do?
Dev's love is like that...

717
01:22:20,559 --> 01:22:23,790
Ask me... I know...

718
01:22:24,596 --> 01:22:29,056
Don't be so large-hearted Rhea
that I feel even smaller...

719
01:22:29,267 --> 01:22:30,996
I'm not that magnanimous...

720
01:22:32,504 --> 01:22:36,873
When Dev told me about you I left him...

721
01:22:40,045 --> 01:22:42,013
But I don't think you know that...

722
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:52,313
How strange!
The love that changed the destinies...

723
01:22:53,191 --> 01:22:55,819
...of two homes today stands destitute...

724
01:22:57,095 --> 01:23:00,553
I moved on... Rishi moved on...

725
01:23:01,766 --> 01:23:04,064
The two of you got left behind...

726
01:23:04,369 --> 01:23:05,996
Perhaps that's our punishment...

727
01:23:06,204 --> 01:23:07,728
Such a small punishment?

728
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:13,270
Try living with Dev... Then you
will know what punishment is...

729
01:23:20,151 --> 01:23:21,914
Ok... I had to fight fifty women forthis...

730
01:23:23,488 --> 01:23:24,420
It's tradition...

731
01:23:26,258 --> 01:23:30,524
...the girl who gets these flowers
gets a new life...

732
01:23:32,063 --> 01:23:37,695
...new happiness... And I want
that girl to be you, Maya...

733
01:23:40,071 --> 01:23:42,369
Your heart has been searching
for love for many years...

734
01:23:44,676 --> 01:23:46,268
...and that love is Dev...

735
01:23:50,048 --> 01:23:55,543
And if you don't hurry now your love
will move further away from you...

736
01:23:56,421 --> 01:24:00,289
Dev is leaving for Toronto... His train
leaves in fifteen minutes...

737
01:24:08,099 --> 01:24:13,435
Go, Maya... Go get your love
before it's too late...

738
01:24:17,676 --> 01:24:18,574
Go...

739
01:24:27,319 --> 01:24:28,251
Thank you...

740
01:25:03,254 --> 01:25:03,913
And Rhea?

741
01:25:04,556 --> 01:25:08,492
Even she will forgive me with time...

742
01:27:15,019 --> 01:27:15,849
Maya!

743
01:27:22,293 --> 01:27:23,055
Dev...

744
01:27:32,303 --> 01:27:34,999
Aren't you a little overdressed forthe station?

745
01:27:35,373 --> 01:27:41,972
Sorry... It's been a while hasn't it?

746
01:27:43,481 --> 01:27:45,005
I don't live here anymore...

747
01:27:46,918 --> 01:27:49,409
And I don't live here despite being here...

748
01:27:50,255 --> 01:27:52,018
Watch where you are going!

749
01:27:53,291 --> 01:27:57,887
Nothing's changed Dev...
You still get angry at everything...

750
01:27:59,664 --> 01:28:06,331
Anger's my own... Doesn't leave me...
Love can always leave and go...

751
01:28:07,172 --> 01:28:09,868
What will you do if you find your lost love?

752
01:28:11,276 --> 01:28:17,806
What will I say now, Maya...
I'll just say 'go back'!

753
01:28:18,683 --> 01:28:26,180
Dev... Only I know how I have
survived these three years...

754
01:28:28,459 --> 01:28:32,486
There was not a moment in the
day when I didn't think of you...

755
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,263
But I used to convince myself
that you are alright...

756
01:28:40,839 --> 01:28:44,331
...you are happy with yourfamily...

757
01:28:45,543 --> 01:28:47,374
I used to think of your happiness...

758
01:28:48,746 --> 01:28:51,237
...and it would reduce a bit
of my unhappiness...

759
01:28:54,052 --> 01:29:01,049
But today I realized that you
have been as alone as I am...

760
01:29:05,496 --> 01:29:06,360
Yes, Dev...

761
01:29:08,233 --> 01:29:12,966
Even I have been alone forthree years...

762
01:29:14,105 --> 01:29:16,073
Alone... Like you...

763
01:29:21,212 --> 01:29:22,270
Why, Dev?

764
01:29:23,748 --> 01:29:26,774
Why did all this happen? Why?

765
01:29:26,985 --> 01:29:34,892
Why did we meet? And then part?
Why, Dev? Why?

766
01:29:47,338 --> 01:29:49,329
Everyone shares happiness and sorrow...

767
01:29:50,775 --> 01:29:53,243
I want to share my punishment with you...

768
01:29:54,612 --> 01:29:57,911
My life may not be complete living with you...

769
01:29:58,116 --> 01:30:00,482
...but at least it will be a life...

770
01:30:02,553 --> 01:30:07,149
Will you share this incomplete
life with me, Maya...

771
01:30:11,496 --> 01:30:14,329
Answer me, Maya... It's hurting...

772
01:30:17,802 --> 01:30:20,771
Answer... I can't sit here the whole...

773
01:30:21,673 --> 01:30:23,903
What do you want me to do?
Go down on my knees?

774
01:30:24,409 --> 01:30:30,370
Shut up... Just shut up... Speak politely...

775
01:30:30,581 --> 01:30:36,577
Ok... Hello... Thank you... Nice to meet you...

776
01:30:37,055 --> 01:30:38,784
I love you... Dammit!

777
01:30:43,695 --> 01:30:44,889
I love you too...

778
01:31:09,187 --> 01:31:10,484
come on...

779
01:31:10,688 --> 01:31:11,848
Now?

780
01:31:12,056 --> 01:31:14,718
Now what? Fifteen days in jail...

781
01:31:14,926 --> 01:31:15,654
What?

782
01:31:16,594 --> 01:31:20,394
Yeah... I stopped the train by pulling the chain...

783
01:31:23,301 --> 01:31:24,495
Why are you wearing this silly saree?

784
01:31:24,702 --> 01:31:25,361
I'd gone for Rishi's wedding...

785
01:31:25,603 --> 01:31:30,302
The foundation of a marriage
should only be love...

786
01:31:30,541 --> 01:31:31,565
And nothing else...

787
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:36,110
because if the foundation
is wrong, relationships end...

788
01:31:36,481 --> 01:31:37,971
Like it happened with us...

789
01:31:38,649 --> 01:31:43,086
Years later, we found love... Happiness...

790
01:31:44,922 --> 01:31:46,787
But we just wish that...

791
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:53,257
...the road to our destination didn't have
to be paved with broken hearts...
