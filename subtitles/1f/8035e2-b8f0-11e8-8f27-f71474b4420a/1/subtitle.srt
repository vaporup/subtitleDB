1
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:46,810
The world of investing.

2
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,816
Can be a jungle.

3
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:52,946
Bulls, bears, danger at every turn.

4
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:58,857
That's why we at Stratton Oakmont.
Pride ourself on being the best.

5
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,725
Trained professionals.

6
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:03,788
To guide you through
the financial wilderness.

7
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,823
Stratton Oakmont..

8
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:11,965
Stability, integrity, pride.

9
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:17,938
1, 2, 3!

10
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:19,844
[ALL CHEERING]

11
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:27,977
Twenty five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bullseye!

12
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,856
come on! Let's go!

13
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:36,794
One, two, three!

14
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:38,857
My name is Jordan Belfort.

15
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,835
Not him, me.
That's right.

16
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,929
I'm a former member of the middle
class raised by two accountants

17
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,931
in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.

18
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:51,742
The year I turned 26, as the
head of my own brokerage firm,

19
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:53,907
I make 49 million dollars.

20
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:58,908
Which really pissed me off because
it was three shy of a million a week.

21
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,815
No, no, my Ferrari was white
like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.

22
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,828
Not red.

23
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,791
See that humongous estate down
there?

24
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:15,860
That's my house.

25
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:18,762
My wife, Naomi.

26
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:24,005
The Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,
a former model and Miller Lite girl.

27
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:27,947
Yeah, she was the one loop my
cock in the mouth in the Ferrari.

28
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:30,816
So put your dick back in your pants.

29
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:33,753
In addition to Naomi and my two perfect kids,

30
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:34,982
I own a mansion, private jet,

31
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:42,794
six cars, three horses, two
vacation homes and a 170 foot yacht.

32
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:52,998
I also gamble like a degenerate, I drink like a
fish, I fuck hookers maybe five-six times a week.

33
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,942
I have three different Federal
agencies looking to indict me.

34
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,808
- Yeah, baby..
- Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,939
And I love drugs.

36
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:05,911
Okay..

37
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,853
- Oh, yeah..
- One more.

38
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,846
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

39
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:13,918
Later that night..

40
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:23,836
Pull up! Pull up! We're gonna
crash! For christ sake!

41
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,703
Come on!

42
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:29,902
Just relax!

43
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:39,753
Oh.. Fuck..
Are you okay?

44
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:40,812
Yeah, I'm alright.

45
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,789
- Alright, good.
- Good job.

46
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,757
Good..

47
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:44,952
You got in there save, alright?

48
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:48,985
- Until next time, brother.
- Until next time.

49
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:59,797
Yup, on a daily basis I consume
enough drugs to sedate Manhattan.

50
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,742
Long Island, and Queens.

51
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:03,005
For a month.

52
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:04,944
Oke, Mr. Jordan.

53
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,915
I take Quaaludes, 10-15 times a day,
for my back pain.

54
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,749
I had the role to stay focus.

55
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:13,913
Xanax to take the eye pot ot mellow me out,

56
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:17,755
Cocaine to wake me back up again,
and morphine, well..

57
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,748
Because it's awesome.

58
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:19,987
Good morning, Lycon.

59
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,895
But of all the drugs under God's blue heaven,

60
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:32,896
there's one that's my absolute favorite.

61
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:37,844
See? Enough of this
shit'll make you invincible.

62
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,938
Able to conquer the world.

63
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:42,814
And eviscerate you enemies.

64
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,853
And I'm not talking about this.

65
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:50,789
I'm talking about this.

66
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:54,953
The money doesn'tjust buy you a better life.

67
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:57,863
Better food, better car, better person.

68
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,924
It's also makes you a better person.

69
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:02,869
You can give generously to the
church or the political party

70
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:06,965
of your choice. You can save
the fucking spotted owl with money.

71
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,912
I always wanted to be rich.

72
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:14,005
So let me go back.

73
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:18,918
I'm 22 years old, newly married,
and already a money crisis little shit.

74
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:19,977
So what do I do?

75
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:25,857
I go to the one place on earth
that befit my high-minded ambitions..

76
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:41,931
You are lower than fucking pond scum.

77
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:45,970
You got problem with that?
Jordan?

78
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,005
- No, no problem at all.
- Good!

79
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:50,984
Because that's it what you are.
Pond scum.

80
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:53,749
You job is "Connector", which means

81
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,780
that you'll be dialing the
phone over 500 times a day.

82
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,793
Trying to connect me with
wealthy business owners.

83
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,888
And until you pass your Series 7,
that's all you gonna be fucking doing.

84
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:05,798
Sit. Sit!

85
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,836
Just so you know, last year
I made over $300.000.

86
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,931
The other guy you'll be
working for, he made over a million.

87
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:17,877
A million dollars? I can only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.

88
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:21,814
- Jordan Belfort? Mark Hanna.
- Yeah, sir.

89
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:23,807
- Pleasure to meet you.
- And you as well,

90
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,819
I see you already meet the village asshole.

91
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:26,911
Smile and dial.

92
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,821
And don't pick up your
fucking head until one.

93
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:30,882
Hey, fuck him.

94
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:33,951
I'm the senior broker here,
dia isjust a worthless piker.

95
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:35,860
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

96
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:38,923
I heard you really pitched a stock
in your job interview.

97
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,833
I had to do something to stand out, right, sir?

98
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,928
I fucking love that!

99
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:46,872
- Lunch, today.
- Ya, alright.

100
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:51,902
Oh, we don't start dinning at 9:30, because
our clients, they're already answering the phone.

101
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:54,813
3, 2, 1!

102
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,908
Let's fuck!

103
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,719
You want to know what money's sound like?

104
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,813
Go to the trading floor on wall street.

105
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:04,791
Fuck this shit that, cunt, cock, asshole.

106
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,761
I couldn't believe how this
guys talk to each other.

107
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:10,864
I was hooked within seconds.

108
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,933
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,833
Fuck face! Look where
you start at today, huh?

110
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,737
Motherfucker, you can't get anywhere,
and at 40..

111
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,798
- Pick up the cock sucking phone!
- Yes, sir.

112
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,776
- Yes, sir.
- Market has been raise well.

113
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,803
You are such a fucking dougchebag, Hanna.

114
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,838
We don't give to shit about
how technology work.

115
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:31,750
Because all we care about is
getting fucking rich!

116
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,777
- Solid!
- Jordan Belfort

117
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:36,017
I got it!

118
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,854
Time to play the tape!

119
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:40,827
Wow! a 20.000 Microsoft!

120
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:41,954
Go in the hole!

121
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:47,832
Come on! It's alive, it's alive.
I want you to hold on, that is hot.

122
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:51,804
Here! In, in! Shut that
motherfucker! Shut it! Shut it!

123
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:52,966
Salut!

124
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:20,891
Tootski?

125
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,903
Oh, no, no thank you, thou.

126
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,872
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for
you on this glorious afternoon?

127
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,773
Well, Hactor heres the game plan.

128
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,836
You gonna bring us two absolut
martinis, you know how I like em.

129
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,816
Straight up, and then precisely seven and a half
minute after that you gonna bring us two more,

130
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:42,983
And then two more after that every 5
minutes until one of us passes the fuck out.

131
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,821
An excellent strategy, sir.

132
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,884
Oh, I'm good with water for now, thou.

133
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:47,985
Thank you.

134
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,860
It's her first day on
wall street.

135
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,864
Give him time..

136
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,960
Thank you. Thank you.

137
00:08:54,969 --> 00:09:00,874
Mr. Hanna, you're able to drugs
during the day and still function?

138
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,899
And still do your job?

139
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,775
Well, how the fuck else would you
do these job?

140
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,007
Cocaine and hookers, my friends.

141
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,947
Right..

142
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:13,785
I got to say, I'm incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm, I mean..

143
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:17,917
- Your.. The clients you have were absolutly..
- Talked the clients.

144
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:21,861
Your only responsibility is
to put meat on the table.

145
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:22,996
You got a girlfriend?

146
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,763
I'm new married, I have a wife,
his name Theresa. She cut hair.

147
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:28,928
- Congratulation.
- Thank you.

148
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,733
Think about Theresa.

149
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,866
Named a game, move the money from your
clients pocket.

150
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:35,773
into your pocket.

151
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:41,009
Right. But if you can make the clients
money, at the same time, isn't that
advantageous everyone, correct?

152
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:45,918
No, okay, number one rule of wall street.

153
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:50,947
Nobody.. Okay, if you Warren Buffet or Jimmy
Buffet, nobody knows.

154
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:54,893
If a stock's going up, down
orsideways fucking in circle,

155
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,863
At least of all stock brokers, right?

156
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,956
It's all in "Furgazy".
you know what Furgazy is?

157
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,763
Yeah, "Furgazy"..
It's a fake..

158
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,897
Yeah, Furgazy, it's
fegazy, it's a wuzzy, it's..

159
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,873
Fairy dust, it doesn't exist.

160
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,934
It's never landed, that is no matter,
it's not on the elemental charge.

161
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:13,037
It's not fucking real! Alright?

162
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:13,979
Alright.

163
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,949
Stay with me.

164
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,919
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

165
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,853
- No.
- So, if you got a client.

166
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:23,914
who brought a stock at 8,
and now it's at 16.

167
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,757
He is all fucking happy, he is
want to cash it, and liquidate.

168
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:27,988
Take his fucking money and run home.

169
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,859
You don't let them do that.

170
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,865
- Okay.
- Because that would make it real.

171
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:33,800
- Right.
- Now, what do you do?

172
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,859
You got another brainer idea.

173
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,962
The special idea.

174
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:41,908
Another situation, another stock,
to reinvested his earning in this stock.

175
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:45,970
And he will, every single time.
As they're fucking addicted.

176
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:49,005
And you just keep doing this,
again, and again, and again.

177
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:52,713
Meanwhile, he think,
he is getting shit rich.

178
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,015
Which he's is, on papper.

179
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,886
But you and me, the brokers?

180
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,891
We taking the whole hot cash.

181
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:00,792
The via commision, motherfucker!

182
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,762
Right!

183
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,931
That's incredible, sir.

184
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,830
I can't tell you how excited I am.

185
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:07,834
You should be.

186
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:11,895
There is two keys, to success,
in broker business.

187
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,964
First of all..

188
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,936
- You gotta stay relax..
- Yeah.

189
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:23,746
- You jerk off?
- Do I jerk off? Yeah.

190
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:24,809
Yeah, I jerk off, yeah.

191
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,786
How many time a week?

192
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,981
Like, 3-4 time, maybe..

193
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,790
Gotta pump those numbers out, those
are rookie numbers in this racket.

194
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:37,855
I, myself, I jerk off, at least twice a day.

195
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,763
- Wow!
- Once in the morning.

196
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,894
Right after I work out,
and then once right after the lunch.

197
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:42,868
Really?

198
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,964
Well, I want to,
that's not the way I do it.

199
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:48,908
I do it, because I fucking need to.

200
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,968
Think about you doing with numbers,
all day long.

201
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:55,880
Desk more point, high frequensy, bang-bang.

202
00:11:55,883 --> 00:12:00,980
Fucking digits kick, kick, kick,
and all very asidick above the shoulders.

203
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:01,953
Right?

204
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:03,890
You can't go weeks the people out.

205
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,893
Right? You got to feed the gizz
to keep the blood flowing.

206
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,919
And keep the ryhtme below the belt.

207
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:09,930
Done.

208
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,865
This is not a tip, this is
a perscription. Trust me.

209
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,869
If you don't, you'll fall out the balance.

210
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,962
Glicth your differasion,
and the tip fuck over.

211
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:18,961
Or more shit.

212
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:19,962
I've seen this happen.

213
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:20,996
In blood.

214
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,805
- No, I don't want blooded, sir.
- No.

215
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,836
- No you don't. Ya.
- I in for a long run, you know?

216
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,006
- Implusion are ugly.
- Ya.

217
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,778
Pop off to the bathroom,
work on that anytime you can.

218
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:30,772
And when you get really good at it.

219
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:33,912
You'll be fucking stroking it,
and you'll be thinking about money.

220
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,915
Second key.

221
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:37,913
To success.

222
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:41,951
In this rackets, is this little
baby right here, it's called Cocaine.

223
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:42,894
Right.

224
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,921
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.

225
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,730
You'll also got your finger dial faster.

226
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:48,861
And guess what.

227
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,870
That's good for me.

228
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,839
Yes, sir.

229
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,807
- Revolution, you follow?
- Revolution.

230
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:57,970
Keep the client on the fairys will.

231
00:12:58,012 --> 00:13:01,846
And it goes, the park is open 24/7365.

232
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,909
Every decade, every goddamn century.

233
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,818
That's it.

234
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,845
Named the game.

235
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:10,847
How tickity?

236
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,793
Mmm... Thank you.

237
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,996

239
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,717
Keep that for me.

240
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,018
# The CEO

241
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,992
# Had the money comes in

242
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,017
# The pray comes down.

243
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,962
# Going down to Broadway.

244
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,931
# It's a one way street.

245
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,990
# Which is a way I go.

246
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,966
For the next six months I got to know
in and out of Wall Street.

247
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:05,843
Earning shit money, as I
gear up, to take my series 7.

248
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:12,843
Ow! Oh God!
That was..

249
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:22,919
Then I was an licensed brooker at last.

250
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,955
Ready to make my fotune.

251
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:29,992
My first day as a future
master of the universe.

252
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:36,766
October 19, 1987.

253
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,745
I've X on 86 from six month ago.

254
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:41,806
Today is draining to 36 in the half.

255
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:44,875
Mr. Buns! Mr..

256
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,979
They called it, The black monday.

257
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:54,858
No shit, by 4 p.m., the market
has dropped 508 points.

258
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:57,854
The biggest plomits since the crash of 29.

259
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,729
I know you family,

260
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,702
No, I don't know, from fucking
country are you or shit.

261
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,828
Let them do what they want fucking do.

262
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:04,803
Our market are out.

263
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,739
Sir, this is not something you want to sale!

264
00:15:06,774 --> 00:15:08,765
You know what happened?

265
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,875
Yeah, I.. Yes, I will talk to your wife.

266
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,780
You not answering the phone,

00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:15,839
Trying to get your dirty laundy.

268
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:16,907
You don't know what's going on here.

269
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,908
I know, I know.

270
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:34,867
Holy fucking shit.

Unbelieveable..

272
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,803
My first shity day as a brooker.

273
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:46,940
Within a month, L.F. Rothschild, an institution
since 1899, closed it's doors.

274
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,941
Wall street did swallow me up,
and shit me right back out again.

275
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,014
We can pawn our engagement ring.

276
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:57,883
If we needed to.

277
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:58,983
- Baby..
- Beside that is mine..

278
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,927
- If we need to, I'm just saying.. Okay.

279
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,988
You're not pawning anything, okay?

280
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,794
- Okay.
- What I always tell you?

281
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,857
You going to be a millionaire.

00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:10,894
That's right, okay? So let me look,
I'll find something.

00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:13,865
"Nobody beats the wiz"

285
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,966
Electronic store, stock boy.
What'd you think?

286
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,773

287

- Yeah, but you know, you start off..
- Jordan, you're gonna be miserable at that place.

288
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:20,945
If you go there.

It's sales, it work a way out,
I'd be a gentleman.

290
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,813
You're not gonna be stock boy.

291
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,979
- Why not?
- Because you are a Stock brooker.

292
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,854
Do you understand there is nobody
hiring stock brooker right now?

293
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,982

00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:56,827

00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,854
Oh, yeah, I interesting on that.

368
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:58,762
Okay, great.

369
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,892
Well, the reason for the call today, John, is..

I've seen in all last 6 month.

371
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:09,876
If you have 60 seconds, I'll like to share
the idea with you, you got minute?

372
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,810
- Say it, I really interesting on that.

373
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:15,872
Aerotyne International, it is

Awaiting imminent path approvall

375
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:25,015
On a next generation of radar detectors that had
both huge military and survilliance application.

376
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:29,894
Now, right now, John, the stock trade
over the count of 10 cent a share.

377
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,988
And by the way, John.

378
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:34,797
Our analysis indicated it can go
way hack of lot higher than that.

379
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:40,865
Your profit, on a mare $6.000 investment,
would be up to $60.000.

380
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:42,808
- Jesus! That's my Mortage, man.
- Exactly.

381
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:43,969
You could pay off your mortage.

382
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,740
This stock would be safe, right?

383
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,874
John, one thing I can promise you,
even in this market.

384
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,009
Is that I never asked my
clients to judge me on my wins

385
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:55,988
I asked them to judge me on my loses,
becuase I have so few.

386
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,854
And in the case of Aerotyne.

387
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:00,793
Based on every technical
factor out there, John.

388
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:03,922
We're looking at the grandslam homerun.

389

I'll do $4.000.

391
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,892
$4.000, that'll be $40.000 share, John.

392
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:11,894
Let me lock in that trade right now,

00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,001
And making cash hand over the fish.

404
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:44,994
the only problem you can have
is you can't buy more.

405
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:46,734
Boom shoot!

406
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:47,831

00:32:59,846 --> 00:33:03,873
And chizel the name Stratton Oakmont
right into a fucking rock!

677
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,781
You got it?

678
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:07,750
What are we gonna do are these.

679
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:10,847
First we pitch them Dysney, TNT, IBM.

680
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,881
Blue Chip Stock's exclusively.

681
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:14,951
Companies this people know.

682
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,894
Once we sucked them in.

683
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:18,989
We unload the dark shit.

684
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,796
The pink sheets. The penny stocks.

685
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,926
Where we make the money.

686
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:25,768
50 %% commission, baby.

687
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:28,774
Now the key to making money
in this situation like this.

688
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:31,743
Is the position of yourself
now before the settlement.

689
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:33,974
Because the time we read it
on the wall streetjournal.

690
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:36,846
It's already too late.

691
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:38,851
And you wait.

692
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:39,818
You wait.

693
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,752
And whoever speak first.

694
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:43,948
Loses.

695
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:47,019
Sorry, I.. I appriciate the call..

696
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,756
I really had to give this some thought.

697
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:51,730
And go talk to my wife about it.

698
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:52,788
Em, can I call you back?

699
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:53,992
They don't know, right?
They got to think about.

700
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,900
They are gonna talk to his fucking
wife, to the fucking tooth fairy.

701
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:58,768
The point is doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

702
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:01,967
The only real objection of what
they have is they don't trust you guys.

703
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,942
Why should they trust you,
I mean, looked at you.

704
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:06,877
You're bunch of slazy salesman, right?

705
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:08,813
So, what do you say?

706
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:10,748
You mean, you tell me, that if I put you in.

707
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:12,978
Kau need to call by the 7,
and you out at the 32.

708
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:15,852
Texas instrument at 11,

00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:18,755
You are still at 16,

You would going to say to me right now, Chester,

00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:26,889
I.. I don't know you.

714
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:29,731
You.. You call phone me.
You're total stranger.

715
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:32,738
I'm complete agree with you,
you don't know me, I don't know you.

716
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:34,865
Let me introduce myself to you,

And I planned to being on of the top brookers

Because I'm gonna make you rich,
and it's not gonna make you poor.

723
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,949
But what Stratton will do in it's serving

724
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:55,723
is bend the mark for future busines, Kevin.

725
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:56,853
You feel comfortable with me now, Scotty?

726
00:34:56,862 --> 00:35:00,889
And then you'll know, for sure, that you
finally found the brooker on wall street

And who can consitetly make you money.

729
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:07,898
Sound fair enough?

730
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:09,807
[MOUTHING]
Fuck you!

731
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:12,868
You know, yeah..
You..

732
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:15,745
I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.

733
00:35:15,748 --> 00:35:17,807
What do you... I don't know,
what do you thinking?

734
00:35:17,817 --> 00:35:23,949
Kevin, you give me one shot here
on the blue chips stock like Kodak.

735
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:28,984
And believe me, Kevin, the
only problem you're gonna have,

736
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:33,898
is that you didn't buy more, sounds fair enough?

737
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:37,803
Shit, well...

738
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:44,743
Ah... My wife might divorce me,
but yeah, let's do it. Oh, yeah.

739
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:46,974
Excellent choice, Kevin, how
much you wanna go for this time?

740
00:35:47,046 --> 00:35:50,948
- Let's do $5.000 dollars or something...
- We'll try $8.000, Kevin.

741
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,817
- Alright, let's do $10.000. You wanna do that?
- $10.000?

742
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:55,946
Excellent choice, Kevin let me
lock-in that trade right now...

743
00:35:55,955 --> 00:35:58,924
and get back to you in a few minutes
for an exact confirmation, Kevin.

744
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:03,952
- And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.
- Thanks, man, I'm gonna have a beer, alright.

745
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:04,952
It's fun.

746
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:08,831
- Take it easy, Kev.
- Hey, yeah, thanks Jordan, thanks a lot.

747
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,995
Get the fuck out, motherfucker!

748
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:16,965
What a fucking idiot.

749
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:21,709
The one thing I know about
in this world is airlines,

750
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:25,774
Cruise air lines is the future
of air lines, get in now...

751
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:26,842
My name is Nicky Koskoff...

752
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:27,784
Chester Ming...

753
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,789
and I'm a Senior Vice
President for Stratton Oakmont.

754
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:35,859
Julia, I'm so, so, so sorry for your loss.

755
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,829
Just say I'm wrong, and the stock goes down...

756
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,960
I make you in the words of my grandfather,
God rests his soul in a shit tons of money.

757
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:45,937
You're gettin' in on fucking sunlight before
there was fucking sunlight, do you understand?

758
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:46,960
$80.000.

759
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:48,997
And $25.000.

760
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,902
That's very intelligent decision, I'm
gonna transfer you to my field associate.

761
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:56,806
Rhonda? Rhonda!

762
00:36:56,816 --> 00:36:57,805
I'm gonna put you through to Andrea.

763
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,977
Does anybody fucking see Rhonda?

764
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,826
Everybody have a good week?

765
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:18,770

commisions, all from pink sheet stock, boys!

00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:21,907
And to celebrate with our weekly active debatery.

767
00:37:21,941 --> 00:37:25,900
I have offered our lovely sales
assistant, Danielle Harrison here...

768
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:30,939
$10.000 dollars to shave her fucking head!

769
00:37:32,885 --> 00:37:33,977
Do you want this?

770
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:35,914
Do you want this!

771
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:41,723
Let's get the party started!

772
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:47,825
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

773
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:53,999
FYI boys, Danielle promised to use her $10.000
for breast implant, she already got C cups,

774
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:56,770
but now she wants fucking double D!

775
00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:00,006
Is this a great fucking comedy or what?

776
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:05,807
This is the place to be the wild!

777
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:12,917
Done it! Blow the roof of this motherfucker!

778
00:38:47,026 --> 00:38:49,790
Do it!

779
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:42,872
Word about us spread through out Wallstreet.

780
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:45,984
Even to places I didn't wanted to.

781
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,988
Wasn't long before Forbes Magazine, the flagship
of Wallstreet call to do a profile on me.

782
00:40:00,032 --> 00:40:03,798
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future, for Stratton Oakmont?

783
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:05,804
We'll work...

784
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:09,839
- Diversification.
- Sounds good.

785
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:11,810
Thank you so much, I have more
than enough, I appreciate your time.

786
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:13,778
- Fantastic!
- Can we get a quick picture?

787
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:16,939
A total fucking hatchetjob.

788
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:19,849
This knitting little twad! Look at this!

789
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:22,844
"The Wolf of Wallstreet," they call me. Look!

790
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,721
- Your hair looks good. Yeah.
- My hair looks good.

791
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:26,850
Jordan Belfort...
(pushing dicey stock)

792
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:30,851
sounding like a kind of "Twisted
Robin Hood," who takes from the rich...

793
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:34,855
and gives to himself and his merry little
band of brokers. Read that, read it.

794
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:39,803
Listen, there is no such thing
as bad publicity, sweet heart.

795
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,033
- Big article, babe.
- Jordan, you look great.

796
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:43,765
You're in a huge magazine.

797
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:44,831
The fucking deal I will.

798
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:46,845
Mr. Belfort! Just give me a chance!

799
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:49,746
Mr. Belfort! Excuse me, excuse me, Sir!

800
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:52,774
[CROWD]

801
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:53,945
Shut the fuck up!

802
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:55,776
What's all this?

803
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:58,723
It's the Forbes article, they
all want to work for you now.

804
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,782
Hey! What did I say?

805
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:04,860
Hey! You want a job, you talk to me!

806
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:08,731
- Mr. Belfort!
- Forbes make me a superstar.

807
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:14,770
Everyday, dozens of money craze
kids be the path to my door.

808
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,932
If we hired them, they drop
straight outta college overnight...

809
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:22,004
and spent whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Stratton taylor.

810
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:24,777
Are you fucking serious right now?

811
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:27,945
I mean we were literally putting
clothes on these kids backs,

812
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:30,956
And here comes thisjerk off snffing around.

813
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,790
But you know, everytime
someone rises up in this world,

814
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:37,990
there's always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down.

815
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:43,958
Within months we doubled in size
and move into even bigger offices.

816
00:41:50,743 --> 00:41:51,971
It was a mad house.

817
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:58,041
A greed fest, with equal parts,
cocaine, testoterone and body fluids.

818
00:41:58,817 --> 00:41:59,909
Yeah!

819
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:05,857
It got so bad, I had to declare the office a
fuck free zone between the hours of 9 and 7.

820
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:07,915
But I'm counting even that didn't enough.

821
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:10,991
Actually the madness started
on our very first day.

822
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:13,988
When one of our brokers Ben
Jenner, christens the elevator,

823
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:16,900
by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant.

824
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:20,998
Her name was Pam and her credit,
she did have this amazing technique,

825
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:24,737
with this wild, twist and jerk motion.

826
00:42:24,777 --> 00:42:27,769
By the month later, Donnie
and I decided to double team...

827
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,739
on a saturday afternoon while our wives
were out shopping for Christmas dresses..

828
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:34,886
Eventually Ben marriage,
that which was pretty amazing,

829
00:42:34,887 --> 00:42:38,721
considering she blew every
single guy in the office.

830
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:41,883
He ain't got the present and
killed himself 3 years later.

831
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:45,990
Anyway I hired my Dad, Max to
maintain order as The Enforcer.

832
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:48,932
Stratton very own Gestapo.

833
00:42:49,835 --> 00:42:52,827
We called him "Mad Max." because
of his hair trigger temper.

834
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:56,864
Which could be set off by something as
obnoxious as a ringing telephone.

835
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:03,779
Who the fuck has the Goddamn ball to
call this house on a tuesday night?

836
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:05,750
Goddamn it!

837
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:06,773
You're gonna missed it!

838
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:08,787
Oh, please, tell me something I don't know!

839
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:11,813
I wait all wek for The fucking Equalizer!

840
00:43:11,824 --> 00:43:13,849
And I have to fucking... Hello?

841
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,792
But as soon as he picked up the phone...

842
00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:16,954
Jean? How are you Jean?

843
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:18,963
He defect his weird British accent.

844
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:22,730
Why, yeah, Jean, that would be great. Cherio!

845
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:23,860
It was absolutely bizarre.

846
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:24,960
Fucking half wit!

847
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:28,769
- And hang up and then he's Mad Max all over again
- You missed it!

848
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:29,933
Damn!

849
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:32,740
What, tell me what happened, what happened?

850
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:34,769
Well, he discovered it was the Mother's sister.

851
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:35,745
Who's he? Who?

852
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:36,839
- Tell me who he is?
- The main guy.

853
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:38,747
- You know who the main guy,
- The main guy...

854
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,719
it was his Mother sister, she showed up dead.

855
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,956
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know
everything we were doing at Stratton.

856
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:49,950
Then there's a big target and we...
They get lunge at the target, they stick.

857
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:52,726
There's a bulls eye and the
bulls eye a dollar sign,

858
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,857
whoever gets close to the dollar
sign gets the most points.

859
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:56,732
I so full of this shit of
this little fucking thing.

860
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:57,792
Yeah, you have to hear yourself talk.

861
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:58,895
So, if he gets hurt, what happens?

862
00:43:58,937 --> 00:43:59,961
Yeah, we're gonna a get fucking knock.

863
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:03,736
I don't think he's gonna get hurt, they're like...
They got like super human strenght.

864
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:04,833
I think he's gonna be fine.

865
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:06,811
You can't look him right in the eyes.

866
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:07,971
You can't look him at in the eye?

867
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:09,810
That's a fact, I saw it on PBS.

868
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,873
They get confuse, their they wires get cross.

869
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:15,819
You gotta look like, the chin Like it's looks like
I'm looking at you, but I'm looking at your chin.

870
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,721
I feel like you addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

871
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:21,749
They're like The Monalisa, they find eye
contact, like wherever you standing in the room,

872
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:22,885
the minute they lock in, you know.

873
00:44:22,895 --> 00:44:24,920
No, but there is a limit to
what we could do with them.

874
00:44:24,963 --> 00:44:28,763
I mean, we're allowed to throw shit at em'.
We allowed to throw food, bananas...

875
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,789
I know crack button.

876
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:32,770
But, for example, what I wouldn't do
is maybe like tell the police cock out.

877
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:35,773
and like to get some of the girls
to, you know... Fun or shit like that.

878
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:37,741
- That would be... That's unacceptable.
- I mean we can, let's keep that in our pocket.

879
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,869
But this guy is more about
thrown, thrown at the dartboard?

880
00:44:39,912 --> 00:44:40,936
Correct, yes, yes.

881
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:44,712
The thing is this is their gift, okay?
They're built to be thrown like a long dart.

882
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,809
They're top heavy like a long
dart, so they're built for accuracy.

883
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,945
Oh, My God, this is...
Can we bowl with this guy?

884
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:51,012
That's his fucking brother, Robbie.
He brothers the bowling ball.

885
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:54,823
The brother you put a skateboard on,
strapped him onto a skateboard.

886
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,986
you toss him down on alley at some pins.

887
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:57,757
No shit, that's intersesting.

888
00:44:57,863 --> 00:44:59,854
- Can we get that guy?
- We can get, we'll get that guy too.

889
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:01,866
But it says here, this guy will show his cock.

890
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,765
Yeah, instead of going up, yeah.

891
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:06,761
They are very armory, by the way, so you
gotta be very careful with these little guys.

892
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:08,773
Safety first, safety is first, alright?

893
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:11,901
I want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer
gun, ready to knock this fucker out.

894
00:45:11,944 --> 00:45:14,003
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace tasers gun.

895
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:15,809
A pellet gun manybe? Just like the...

896
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:18,782
No, pellet gun, is gonna hurt him,
I just want him out, knocked out cold

897
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:21,014
I say we stick with the loophole, right, okay?

898
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:24,017
We don't considered him a human,
we just considered it an act.

899
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:26,991
I think we're in the clear, like a flying,
you know a lot of those guys died.

900
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:28,014
but they never sued anybody.

901
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,785
The important thing, you
guys gotta keep in mind is...

902
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:33,788
is that these things gossip,
they get together and they gossip.

903
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:36,026
- It's a good point.
- And the last thing that we need is...

904
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:38,930
them getting together and then saying "Oh,
listen, they made fun of us" like...

905
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:41,872
- like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.
- That's why I love you.

906
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:42,874
You think of shit like that.

907
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:43,898
That is a come in?

908
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:45,967
We treat itjust like one of us, okay?

909
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:49,742
One of us, we're gonna treat them like one of us!

910
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:52,875
We accept that one of us, we're
gonna treat them like one of us!

911
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:54,886
We accept that one of us, we're
gonna treat them like one of us!

912
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:55,910
Jordan!

913
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:58,787
Your Dad's coming, something
about The American Express bill?

914
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,883
- Hey, can you get him outta here? I'm not...
- Yeah, lick my toe.

915
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,826
No, I'm serious, get...

916
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:05,021
Fuck! Okay, guys, act like we're working on stuff.

917
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,899
Okay, he's coming, he's coming.

918
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:08,991
Make some shit off.

919
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:10,968
I think we're short at visor...

920
00:46:11,036 --> 00:46:15,973
$430.000 dollars in one month, Jordy, huh?

921
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:21,776
Four hundred and fucking thirty thousand
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

922
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:23,781
Good morning, they're businness expenses, relax!

923
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:25,977
Business expenses? Jordy, look what you got here!

924
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:26,916
- What?

925
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:30,820
$26.000 dollars for one fucking dinner!

926
00:46:30,856 --> 00:46:32,790
Okay, no, no, no this could be explained.

927
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,952
Dad, we had client, we have the Visa client.

928
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:36,858
Right, the porter house from Argentina.

929
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:38,920
The expensive champagne and
wine, we have to buy champagne...

930
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:41,762
And you go it all the fucking sides.
Tel him about the sides order.

931
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,858
- I ordered the sides, so...
- Sides?

932
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:46,735
Sides? $26.000 dollars, worth the sides?

933
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:48,829
What are this sides? That cures cancer?

934
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,742
This sides did cure cancer, that's the
problem, that's why they were expensive.

935
00:46:52,778 --> 00:46:53,938
- Shut the fuck up!
- I'm serious...

936
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:54,877
- I know...
- Stop!

937
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:58,940
EJ Entertainment, what the
fuck is EJ Entertainment?

938
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,783
Well, that's a...

939
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,754
- Jordan what's EJ entertainment?
- How I describe this...

940
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:06,752
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

941
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:08,953
- That's what it is!
- That's... That is what it is.

942
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,894
That's the perfect decription for it!

943
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:13,796
It is what it is, but none
of this were charge to me,

944
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:14,992
This is all of them.

945
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:15,965
Oh, that was all of us.

946
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,868
It wasn't me though, fucking
explain the shit to him!

947
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,929
These all of your fucking charges right here!

948
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:23,941
You guys, The IRS, they
allow for T&A, it's fine.

949
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:27,001
- T&A, T&A?
- Yeah, I said T&E.

950
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:28,945
- No, no you said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

951
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,744
- Yeah you did, you say T&A!
- When did I say that?

952
00:47:31,783 --> 00:47:32,750
It's T&E, alright?

953
00:47:32,751 --> 00:47:36,881
I know you're upset about the dinner and that
make sense because we did spend too much money.

954
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:37,889
But I said T&E...

955
00:47:37,923 --> 00:47:39,891
Don't tell me what you
said, I heard what you said.

956
00:47:39,925 --> 00:47:40,857
- I...
- Dad, he said T&A.

957
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:42,917
- Yeah, he said T&A.
- Yeah, absolutely no question. I heard it.

958
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:43,859
Jordan, I'm trying too...

959
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:44,886
- I'm fucking sweating.
- I'm getting this close.

960
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,726
- Dad, relax!
- I'm getting this close!

961
00:47:46,765 --> 00:47:48,926
That's what I'm saying, why you open up more, Max?

962
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:49,899
He's gonna fucking kill you.

963
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:53,769
Why do you hold it in? Max, why do you hold it in?

964
00:47:53,772 --> 00:47:55,763
That's it, that's it! Get the fuck out!

965
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:56,865
- No, no, no, no!
- Hold on!

966
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:57,899
Get out asshole!

967
00:47:57,943 --> 00:48:00,912
- What kind of hooker takes credit card?
- A rich one!

968
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:03,710
At Stratton, there were 3 kinds of hookers,

969
00:48:03,782 --> 00:48:05,841
the blue chips, top of the line, model material.

970
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:10,754
They cost between $300-$500 and you had to
wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip.

971
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:11,983
Which of course I always did.

972
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:15,857
Then came the Nasdaq, who are pretty not great.

973
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:17,988
They cost between $200 and $300 bucks.

974
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:20,827
Finally there were the pink sheets skanks.

975
00:48:20,832 --> 00:48:22,766
They cost about $100 or less.

976
00:48:22,801 --> 00:48:25,861
And if you didn't wear a condom, you have
to get a pennicilin shot the next day...

977
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:27,769
and pray your dick didn't fall off.

978
00:48:27,773 --> 00:48:29,764
Not that we didn't fuck them too.

979
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:31,901
Believe me, we did.

980
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:34,776
Aw! I slip this thing again.

981
00:48:34,813 --> 00:48:36,906
I know what it is, you know too much...

982
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:38,949
with EJ Entertainment.

983
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:41,748
- Pops...
- How are things at home?

984
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:45,814
Well, not the best, she just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

985
00:48:45,891 --> 00:48:50,988
It's like this smell, a smell, there's attraction
thing and after a while itjust kinda fades away.

986
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:53,863
- Yeah, well it supposed to fade away.
- Supposed to?

987
00:48:53,899 --> 00:48:55,730
- That's marriage, you know...
- That so...

988
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,928
- Your Mother and I we've been
married a long long time. - I know

989
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:00,938
What do you think? We, we, we...
jumpin' into bed every 2 minutes?

990
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,965
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death, I want to stay married, but

991
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:08,902
It's crazy out there, some of these
girls. You should see them, oh my God.

992
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:14,942
They're fucking... The things they doing
now, Pops, I mean it's on a whole new level.

993
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:16,851
- Really?
- And they're all shaved too.

994
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:17,855
Get outta here!

995
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:19,720
- All shaved and nice.
- Are you kidding me?

996
00:49:19,758 --> 00:49:22,727
- Yeah, bald as a China doll.
- No bush? No bush?

997
00:49:22,761 --> 00:49:23,989
- No bush, I know...
- Oh, My God.

998
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:25,894
All of the sudden like, one week...

999
00:49:25,931 --> 00:49:28,832
- Nobody had anything down there anymore.
- It's a new world.

1000
00:49:28,867 --> 00:49:31,836
- They bald from the eyebrows down.
- Wow.

1001
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:34,862
- Nothing, not a stitches, like lasers.
- Wow. New world.

1002
00:49:34,873 --> 00:49:38,809
I was born too... Too early.

1003
00:49:38,877 --> 00:49:40,868
I've never been a fan of the bush to be honest.

1004
00:49:40,912 --> 00:49:42,004
- Really?
- Yeah.

1005
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:43,776
I don't mind it.

1006
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:46,943
Dad, I don't want you
stressin' out about any of this.

1007
00:49:46,952 --> 00:49:49,887
How can I not get stressed out? Look at
the knuckle heads you got working for you.

1008
00:49:49,921 --> 00:49:53,823
I know they're knuckle head, but I need
them to want to live like me, you get it?

1009
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:55,724
To live like me.

1010
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,788
Jordy, one of these days, the
chickens are gonna come home to roost.

1011
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:03,995
You looking at me like I'm crazy.

1012
00:50:04,035 --> 00:50:07,732
Crazy? This is obscene.

1013
00:50:07,806 --> 00:50:13,870
It was obscene, in the normal world.
I mean who the fuck wanted to live there?

1014
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:17,813
The party are fucking cast off!

1015
00:50:26,892 --> 00:50:34,822
We got planes up here, that's gonna take
this company into the fucking stratosphere!

1016
00:50:36,935 --> 00:50:40,837
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

1017
00:50:42,841 --> 00:50:44,741
Fuck Lynch, fuck them!

1018
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:46,835
Why should they be taking all of our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1019
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:47,936
That's why we became underrun.

1020
00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:53,007
It was our next big move, finding
companies to take public, IPO's.

1021
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:54,978
It was the only way this Wallstreet pricks...

1022
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,956
would ever stop thinking of us
as some shit kick a bucket shot.

1023
00:50:58,957 --> 00:51:00,754
We got an unclip international.

1024
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:05,855
See we're a little different, we like to get as
fucked up as possible during our businness powers.

1025
00:51:05,864 --> 00:51:07,991
in order to stimulate our free flowing ideas.

1026
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:11,764
Which is why we're popping
this ludes like they were M&M's.

1027
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:12,996
You mad...

1028
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,000
We own the fucking company...
We own the company...

1029
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:20,034
Don't know what a ludes is?
I'll tell you.

1030
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:22,736
Wait, wait, wait...

1031
00:51:22,781 --> 00:51:27,878
Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie, right now.

1032
00:51:59,985 --> 00:52:04,854
The Quaalude or lude as it commonly referred to,

1033
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:10,020
was first synthetize in 1951 by an
Indian doctor, that's not feathers.

1034
00:52:10,028 --> 00:52:15,864
as a sedative and was prescribed to
stressed out house wife with sleep disorders.

1035
00:52:16,001 --> 00:52:21,962
But pretty soon, someone figured out that if you
resist the urges to sleep forjust 15 minutes...

1036
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,942
you got a prety kick ass high from it.

1037
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:28,878
Didn't take long for people to
start abusing ludes of course.

1038
00:52:28,913 --> 00:52:33,873
And in 1982 The U.S Government scheduled
one of them along with the rest of the world.

1039
00:52:34,753 --> 00:52:37,847
Which meant there's only a
finite amount of this things left.

1040
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:44,020
No shit, you can't even buy them
anymore, you people all shit out of luck.

1041
00:52:44,796 --> 00:52:47,993
- Steve Madden...
- Steve Madden.

1042
00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:50,928
- Steve...
- Steve.

1043
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:52,732
You remember those ads?

1044
00:52:52,804 --> 00:52:56,831
Those giant headed girls with the bug eyes,
wearing those big clunky shoes?

1045
00:52:56,875 --> 00:53:00,811
- My friend from school, Steve Madden.
- His friend from school, Steve Madden.

1046
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,746
Steve Madden was the name
in women shoes at the moment...

1047
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:06,876
and all of Wallstreet was begging
to take his company public.

1048
00:53:06,918 --> 00:53:08,783
Go ahead, what is it?

1049
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,879
- Except, guess who grew up with them?
- Women shoes!

1050
00:53:10,922 --> 00:53:11,980
Women shoes.

1051
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,788
My very own Vice President.

1052
00:53:14,893 --> 00:53:16,758
Women shoes.

1053
00:53:16,795 --> 00:53:18,854
Diamond Donnie Azoff.

1054
00:53:18,897 --> 00:53:21,730
- Madden... Steve...
- Steve.

1055
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,833
Jordy, Jordy, Jordy, Jordy... You
better come check this fucking chic' out.

1056
00:53:24,836 --> 00:53:25,894
Look at this, look there.

1057
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:34,745
- That was hot.
- That girl, if she was my sister,

1058
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:37,873
I would let that girl give me fucking 8.

1059
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,975
Can the wolf handle it?

1060
00:53:41,953 --> 00:53:43,716
She's hot!

1061
00:53:43,822 --> 00:53:45,756
Christy...

1062
00:53:50,028 --> 00:53:52,792
Jordan, this is my friend, Naomi.

1063
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:54,856
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1064
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,025
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1065
00:53:56,735 --> 00:53:58,726
Nice to meet you, you got an awesome place here.

1066
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,897
I don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

1067
00:54:00,939 --> 00:54:01,906
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1068
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,805
There's a beautiful beach out there,
I could take you there...

1069
00:54:03,842 --> 00:54:04,968
Blair Hollingsword.

1070
00:54:05,777 --> 00:54:06,869
Hi, Blair, nice to meet you.

1071
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,811
- Your name is Blair, right?
- Yeah.

1072
00:54:08,847 --> 00:54:11,839
- You like to jetski?

1073
00:54:11,883 --> 00:54:13,851
- You neverjetski in your life?
- No, I never on a jetski.

1074
00:54:13,885 --> 00:54:15,750
- You never been on a jetski?
- No, I haven't.

1075
00:54:15,787 --> 00:54:17,880
How many times you gonna ask
her, if she's never on a jetski?

1076
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:20,816
I don't know, I might ask
her a couple more times.

1077
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:21,917
Okay...

1078
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:26,897
- Hi, I'm Hildy, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1079
00:54:26,898 --> 00:54:28,798

00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,734
Yeah, I'll be there in couple of minutes.
Just tell her I'll be there in couple of minutes.

1081
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:32,862
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1082
00:54:32,871 --> 00:54:34,702
How am I gonna do that? While
I'm having a conversation...

1083
00:54:34,773 --> 00:54:36,934
You know what? I think we should get going.

1084
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,772
Wait, wait, where you guys going?

1085
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:39,902
We gotta go, we got to other parties.

1086
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,969
- No, no, yeah stay for a drink.
- We can stay for a drink.

1087
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,813
No, no, we got to other parties
we supposed to get to, so...

1088
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,814
Why don't you let her stay for a while?

1089
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:48,910
- Let her stay for a while, what's the big deal?
- Perfect...

1090
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,978
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1091
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:53,752
Donnie, what the fuck are you doing?

1092
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:04,900
You gonna have to excuse my friend, he gets...

1093
00:55:04,936 --> 00:55:07,905
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Jordan, you gotta fuck her, she so hot!

1094
00:55:07,906 --> 00:55:14,903
Fuck you Donnie, let him finish
it Hildy, that's fucking rude.

1095
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:22,010
So, Bay Ridge. That's near Staten Island, right?

1096
00:55:22,754 --> 00:55:24,847
Brooklyn across The Verrazano bridge.

1097
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:26,948
- Southern island territory.
- That's right.

1098
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:30,860
You mean gulge, go to Verrazano
bridge and see the plank.

1099
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:33,830
Right, so I presumed you're Italian?

1100
00:55:33,832 --> 00:55:39,771
On my Dad side, I'm also Dutch,
German, English, I'm a mutt.

1101
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,774
- You're a mutt?
- Yeah, I still have family over there, in London.

1102
00:55:43,842 --> 00:55:47,903
My Aunt Emma, she's the
best, very British you know?

1103
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:50,847
- She's a classy lady.
- That explains it then.

1104
00:55:50,882 --> 00:55:51,849
Explains what?

1105
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:56,810
Explains you, I mean you're Duchess, right?
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1106
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:03,019
Excuse me, can I get a straw, please?

1107
00:56:04,796 --> 00:56:05,990
Thank you.

1108
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:14,770
So, I was a little surprise
you ask Christy for my number.

1109
00:56:14,973 --> 00:56:16,873
Why is that?

1110
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:20,904
Aren't you married?

1111
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:26,011
Well, yeah, but what? Married
people can't have friends?

1112
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:30,785
We're gonna be friends?

1113
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:34,017
Yeah. You don't wanna be my friend?

1114
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:40,831
We're not gonna be friends.

1115
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:50,967
And then I worked on my designs.

1116
00:56:51,009 --> 00:56:56,879
I have an entire an entire line of
lingerie, camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1117
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:01,943
She designs woman panties too? Oh, My God!

1118
00:57:11,863 --> 00:57:14,923
Come on Jordan, think of a
way to get up to her apartment.

1119
00:57:19,938 --> 00:57:22,907
You want to come up for some tea or something?

1120
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:26,843
Tea? Yeah, like hot tea?

1121
00:57:26,878 --> 00:57:28,846
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, sounds nice, yeah.

1122
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,713
Tea, fuck yeah I wanna come up for tea.

1123
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:34,980
Like rosehips or something like that.

1124
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:36,850
This is Rocky.

1125
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:39,888
- Who is this? say hi, Rocky.
- Hi, sweet heart.

1126
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:44,988
- Okay. - Why don't you light a fire or
something, I'll be right out.

1127
00:57:45,029 --> 00:57:47,793
- Yeah, fire, yeah.
- Sure.

1128
00:57:50,902 --> 00:57:52,995
I like your painting, it's uh...

1129
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:02,743
God, help me how do I fuck this girl?

1130
00:58:05,883 --> 00:58:09,910
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah I just try to light the fire in here.

1131
00:58:14,826 --> 00:58:18,853
That's it, that's it! You leave and
don't get involved, go home to your wife.

1132
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:32,876
As you can probably guess, I
fuck her Goddamn brains out!

1133
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:35,742
Oh, Jesus Lord!

1134
00:58:37,782 --> 00:58:39,807
For 11 seconds.

1135
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:53,795
- Did you just cum?
- Oh, yeah I just came.

1136
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,892
- Did you? Did you cum?
- No.

1137
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:57,866
No?

1138
00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:01,896
Okay, I'm still hard, just give me a second.

1139
00:59:02,006 --> 00:59:04,770
- Sure.
- Yeah...

1140
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:06,743
Come on, come on...

1141
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:09,904
Hold me, oh yeah... Oh yeah...

1142
00:59:16,788 --> 00:59:19,848
- Oh, God!
- Fuck off, Rocky!

1143
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:21,882
- Do you have biscuits or something like that?
- It's okay.

1144
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:23,859
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1145
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:25,920
Gom play Rocky, go, go...

1146
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,791
- You're crazy.
- I couldn't get enough.

1147
00:59:30,835 --> 00:59:33,736
I mean her pussy was like heroin to me.

1148
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:37,001
And it wasn'tjust about the sex
either, Naomi and I got along.

1149
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,976
I mean we... We had similiar interest in shits.

1150
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,977

01:00:05,002 --> 01:00:08,870
What's going on down there, huh?

1154
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:11,872
Shit!

01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:39,828

01:00:39,871 --> 01:00:41,862
- What do you doing? I thought you're in...
- With the whore from that party?

1162
01:00:41,906 --> 01:00:44,773
- Jesus Christ!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1163
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:46,970
I thought you're at the fucking beach!
i didn't know you were here.

1164
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:50,913
That's who you fucking been?
With that fucking whore from the party?

1165
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:51,937
What are you doing here? I
thought you were at the beach!

1166
01:00:51,983 --> 01:00:53,917
How could you do this to me?

1167
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:55,977
- Sweetie, come on!
- I don't know who the fuck are you Jordan.

1168
01:00:56,888 --> 01:00:59,789
You're like a completely different fucking person.

1169
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:02,816
I made a mistake, I don't know
what to tell you, babe, I...

1170
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:04,986
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

1171
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:07,930
Is that what you want?

1172
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:19,839
Do you love her?

1173
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:27,012
Answer me.

1174
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:49,899
I felt horrible.

1175
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:54,842
3 days later I filed for a divorce
and move Naomi into the apartment.

1176
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:02,012
Say what you will, but the Duchess did have style.

1177
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:05,750
She brought in an decorator,
feng shui the whole place,

1178
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:07,815
she even hired a gay butler.

1179
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:12,762
This guy was smart, sophisticated,
professional, I mean really, really great.

1180
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:16,995
- Jasmine? - Yes, Sir, I try to stump
you this evening, really good.

1181
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:18,764
Very good, great nose.

1182
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:20,896
Except for that one time.

1183
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:26,970
Oh, My God!

1184
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,747
Oh, hey...

1185
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,807
Is it wednesday already?

1186
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:37,787
What the fuck? That is fuck up!

1187
01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:40,814
He must thought we still at The
Hamptons this weekend, you know?

1188
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:42,883
- Where are they doing it, sweet heart?
In the bed room? - They were everywhere!

1189
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:45,953
There were 2 guys over there on
the table, there are more over here.

1190
01:02:45,997 --> 01:02:48,830
- There were 4 right here.
- Oh, God! Are you fucking serious?

1191
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:50,892
Right there? Why didn't you tell me, sweetie?

1192
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,732
Baby, that worst.

1193
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:56,873
After they're left they checked the apartment.

1194
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:59,933
Right, what? What is it, baby? What?

1195
01:03:00,011 --> 01:03:02,741
- Where's my money?
- I don't know where your money...

1196
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,839
zWhere's my fucking money, where is it?

1197
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:07,784
I don't know where your money is
Mr. Belfort, I didn't do anything.

1198
01:03:07,818 --> 01:03:10,013
- You don't know where my money is? - He's
lying Jordan, he's lying to his fucking teeth.

1199
01:03:10,021 --> 01:03:12,785
Let's start from the beginning!
Let's start from the beginning, right?

1200
01:03:12,857 --> 01:03:14,791
- You invited some friends over, right?
- Yes.

1201
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:16,759
One thing led to another, things got outta hand,

1202
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:21,721
We understand that, we do blow all the time, we
fucking degenerates us, so look at us, right?

1203
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:24,962
My money were stolen from my
apartment, right from my socks drawer, alright?

1204
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:26,960
Like I say, I don't know where your money is.

1205
01:03:27,004 --> 01:03:28,869
Just start from the beginning, who came over?

1206
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:30,998
It's a normal day, I knew
you coming home the next day,

1207
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:32,976
so everything will be fine, it will be cleaned up.

1208
01:03:33,744 --> 01:03:36,907
I got a little high at breakfast, I
got a little happy and made some eggs.

1209
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:40,007
had a little bit ice cream, and then I
say, who do I know who likes ice cream.

1210
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:42,781
- My friend Rudy, so I call Rudy.
- Who's Rudy?

1211
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,878
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1212
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:47,753
You know who Rudy is, come on.

1213
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:50,761
- He know who Rudy is?
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1214
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:52,786
- I don't know anyone named Rudy.
- You know, last month, The Lollipop club.

1215
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:53,819
You know who Rudy was.

1216
01:03:54,765 --> 01:03:55,857
You know Rudy?

1217
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:59,893
I don't know about, fucking know anyone...
What do you mean?

1218
01:03:59,904 --> 01:04:02,873
- So he went to The Lollipop club?
- Oh, he was at The Lollipop club for sure.

1219
01:04:02,907 --> 01:04:04,807
On the stage aquintance with everybody.

1220
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,970
I got fucked up, I like the dance, I don't
know... Maybe I met them, maybe i didn't.

1221
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:08,979
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1222
01:04:09,914 --> 01:04:12,940
- $20.000 dollars was stolen from my fucking
sock drawer! - What are you saying?

1223
01:04:12,983 --> 01:04:14,848
All my girlfriends know that!

1224
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:16,910
I don't know who Rudy is, what the fuck!

1225
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:20,823
You little faggot friend, Rudy,
take my shit, did he? Answer me!

1226
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:23,918
Okay, now I get it, now I get why I'm...
This is a gay thing.

1227
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:25,793
- Oh!
- I see all of you.

1228
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:27,925
This is because you're a fag?

1229
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:32,766
My cousin is a fucking faggot and I go on
vacation with him and his boyfriend! I love faggot

1230
01:04:32,803 --> 01:04:33,770
You're like being charged, right?

1231
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:34,964
I will not be stolen from, you get that?

1232
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:36,997
I fucking like gay people, I don't like you!

1233
01:04:37,742 --> 01:04:39,972
You should hire a fucking Mexican
like I hired in my fucking house.

1234
01:04:41,846 --> 01:04:42,813
Shit!

1235
01:04:42,847 --> 01:04:43,905
You fucking!

1236
01:04:47,852 --> 01:04:48,876
Talk, you fuck, talk!

1237
01:04:48,919 --> 01:04:51,752
I'm gonna drop you, you fucking!
Where is it?

1238
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:54,849
Chester and Toby, they
went all yakuza on Nicholas.

1239
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:55,984
You know, they got crazy.

1240
01:04:56,827 --> 01:04:57,816
I really appreciate your help.

1241
01:04:57,862 --> 01:05:00,729
I had to call the copsjust to
keep them from killing the poor guy.

1242
01:05:00,865 --> 01:05:03,959
I gave them each $2.000 bucks and
told them what Nicholas have done.

1243
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:06,962
They naked his ass.

1244
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:10,874
It's not like I care about the $50.000 anyway.

1245
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:14,844
I was making that much almost everyday
through one rat hole or another.

1246
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:17,914
A rat hole, is a friend, like Brad here.

1247
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:20,782
Who held stock in his name for me.

1248
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:22,843
How are you doing? Goodbye...

1249
01:05:22,853 --> 01:05:27,813
I drive the price up, then he'd sells
and kick most of the profit back to...

1250
01:05:27,892 --> 01:05:30,759
you guessed it, me!

1251
01:05:31,996 --> 01:05:34,863
All cash, none of it's on the books.

1252
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:37,901
A big no no of course in the eyes of the law.

1253
01:05:37,902 --> 01:05:41,736
Enter our new security attorney, Manny Riskin.

1254
01:05:41,806 --> 01:05:45,799
$700 bucks an hour to be the voice of doom.

1255
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:47,971
You pissed up the SEC's leg, you
end up with your tits in the ringer.

1256
01:05:48,012 --> 01:05:50,879
Do not worry about it, I
have The SEC under control.

1257
01:05:51,816 --> 01:05:53,909
What the fuck are these imbeciles doing?

1258
01:05:53,918 --> 01:05:56,819
Hey, what are you doing? Hey!

1259
01:05:56,854 --> 01:05:58,754
We got The SEC in here!

1260
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:03,826
The Security of Exchange Comission
sent 2 lawyers down to review our files.

1261
01:06:03,861 --> 01:06:05,852
So I set them up in our conference room.

1262
01:06:05,896 --> 01:06:10,924
And I had it bugged and the air conditioning
turn up so high that it felt like antartica there.

1263
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:13,903
- Is it always this cold in here?
- I don't know.

1264
01:06:13,938 --> 01:06:16,964
Then, while they were looking
for a smoking gun in that room,

1265
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:23,969
I was gonna fire off a bazooka
here, offering up our latest IPO.

1266
01:06:24,014 --> 01:06:26,983
An IPO is an initial public offering,

1267
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:30,851
It's a first time a stock is offered
for sales to the general population.

1268
01:06:30,888 --> 01:06:34,016
Now as the firm taking the company
public, we set the initial sales price...

1269
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:36,726
then sold those shares right back to our friends.

1270
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:40,924
Yet... Look, You're not gonna
following what I'm saying anyway, right?

1271
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:42,999
That's okay, that doesn't matter.

1272
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,868
The real question is this, was all this legal?

1273
01:06:46,904 --> 01:06:48,963
Absolutely fucking not.

1274
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:51,873
We will making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1275
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:59,008
And what do you do when you making
more money than you knew what to do with?

1276
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:06,785
Oh, My God.

1277
01:07:06,824 --> 01:07:08,849
Will you marry me?

1278
01:07:08,893 --> 01:07:09,917
Oh, My God.

1279
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,951
Is that a yes?

1280
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:15,890
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1281
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,925
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1282
01:07:28,012 --> 01:07:31,914
I held my bchelor party
at The Mirage in Las Vegas.

1283
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:34,749
They flight there alone was a buck and all.

1284
01:07:34,752 --> 01:07:38,745
One last blow out fior the God
before I settle down for good.

1285
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:43,749
A hundred staff, 50 hookers plus
50 more waiting once we landed.

1286
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:48,831
All in drugs, I mean I tell you, up
plane was like a pharmacy with wings.

1287
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:22,761
All told, that we came
across nearly 2 million bucks.

1288
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:26,994
Including the cost of
refurbishing the entire 28 floor.

1289
01:08:27,905 --> 01:08:29,930
Kiss the bride.

1290
01:08:31,008 --> 01:08:35,001
Ah, but the wedding was
something out of a fairy tale.

1291
01:08:35,012 --> 01:08:37,879
With Naomi, my Duchess.

1292
01:08:37,915 --> 01:08:42,784
Meet her handsome Duke in the Bahamas ocean club.

1293
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:57,958
Of course after the bachelor party, me,
The Duke needed a few pennicilin shots,

1294
01:08:57,968 --> 01:09:01,995
so we could safely consumate the marriage.

1295
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,801
I'm Barry Klineman, filming the wedding.

1296
01:09:08,846 --> 01:09:09,972
A few words, huh? For your son.

1297
01:09:10,014 --> 01:09:15,953
Jordan, remember what I told you, it
involves your penis and her vagina...

1298
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:19,922
and you know what to do, Jordy.

1299
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,009
Oh, My God! Aunt Emma?

1300
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:44,937
Auntie, you came!

1301
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,976
Jordan, Jordan!

1302
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:51,852
Look who came, it's Aunt Emma!

1303
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:54,949
- Aunt Emma, hey, how are you doing?
- Jordan, how are you?

1304
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:58,922
Glad you came, pleasure to
finally meet you in person.

1305
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:00,987
You're not too sassy.

1306
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:04,865
I... I was.

1307
01:10:05,002 --> 01:10:07,800
I live through the 60's my dear...

1308
01:10:07,938 --> 01:10:09,963
Enjoy the day.

1309
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:12,737
She wants to meet you, I didn't even know.

1310
01:10:25,956 --> 01:10:27,981
- Just one more step.
- Where are we going?

1311
01:10:28,025 --> 01:10:30,960
Keep your eyes closed, 1, 2, 3!

1312
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:35,863
- What is this?
- It's your wedding present.

1313
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:38,834
- What?
- It's your wedding present, sweetheart.

1314
01:10:39,002 --> 01:10:40,936
What?

1315
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:43,769
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1316
01:10:43,774 --> 01:10:45,765
A fucking yacht?

1317
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:47,800
Millionnaires, whose ship come in,

1318
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:49,972
A pricy pleasure boat offer the most fun of love.

1319
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:54,878
It's no coincidence that it's 150 feet
of green hull is the color of passion.

1320
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:55,907
And cast away!

1321
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,888
Oh, My God, baby!

1322
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:01,923
- I think you're like it?
- You're crazy!

1323
01:11:01,959 --> 01:11:04,018
- You like it?
- Yes!

1324
01:11:08,966 --> 01:11:11,992
For 3 weeks we sailed The
Naomi through the Carribean,

1325
01:11:12,002 --> 01:11:15,768
eventually taking our home to Long
Island where we bought a house.

1326
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:20,767
7 acres on the gold coast of Long Island,
the most expensive real estate of the world.

1327
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:23,746
With maids, cook, landscape, as you name it.

1328
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:26,978
We even had 2 guards who works
in shift, both named Rocko.

1329
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:30,743
"18 months later."

1330
01:11:30,921 --> 01:11:33,947
It was heaven in earth.

1331
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,927
Wake up you piece of shit!

1332
01:11:38,028 --> 01:11:40,724
Who is Venice, huh?

1333
01:11:40,731 --> 01:11:41,993
- Who? Who?
- Who?

1334
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,734
What are you a fucking owl? Who is she?

1335
01:11:44,735 --> 01:11:46,862
- I don't know what the,
- Some hooker you fuck last night?

1336
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:47,928
What the fuck are you talking about?

1337
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,996
No, no way baby, no!

1338
01:11:50,007 --> 01:11:52,874
You're calling her name in your sleep!

1339
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:54,741
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1340
01:11:54,812 --> 01:11:57,747
I don't even know who Venice is.

1341
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:59,874
What the fuck does that even mean? Venice!

1342
01:11:59,883 --> 01:12:02,852
That's the Stupidest shit I ever hear
in my fucking life!

1343
01:12:06,023 --> 01:12:15,830
Venice, Venice baby where are you?

1344
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:17,960
Where did you go?

1345
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:19,935
[GROANING]

1346
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,939
Oh baby, oh you can play rough, huh?

1347
01:12:23,941 --> 01:12:26,910
- Oh, jesus christ!
- Relax.

1348
01:12:28,779 --> 01:12:30,713
I like it, I like it..

1349
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:32,840
Aw, wolfie, wolfie, wolfie!

1350
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,011
- Wolfie?
- Yeah, it's my safe word baby, it's my safe word

1351
01:12:35,052 --> 01:12:37,850
- I don't give a fuck about your safe word!
- Oh come on!

1352
01:12:37,855 --> 01:12:39,880
Shut the fuck up!
[SCREAMING]

1353
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:40,982
Shut up, you little bitch!

1354
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:43,959
Ah! Your fucking dirty little birdy!

1355
01:12:43,994 --> 01:12:45,859
[SCREAMING]

1356
01:12:45,863 --> 01:12:48,832
That's right, that's right, I forgot.

1357
01:12:48,899 --> 01:12:55,828
Forget it babe, Donnie and I were investing in the
condominium complex in Venice, that's why this all
is confusing!

1358
01:12:55,873 --> 01:12:58,967
- You were investing in Italy?
- Not Italy, California.

1359
01:12:59,009 --> 01:13:00,772
- California?
- Yeah!

1360
01:13:00,777 --> 01:13:01,835
You're lying piece of shit!

1361
01:13:01,879 --> 01:13:04,848
- Duchess, baby.
- Don't you fucking duchess me!

1362
01:13:04,848 --> 01:13:06,008
- Don't you duchess me!
- Okay, I am sorry.

1363
01:13:06,016 --> 01:13:09,747
Do you really think that I don't know
what you're up to?

1364
01:13:09,786 --> 01:13:11,754
- You're father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1365
01:13:11,788 --> 01:13:15,815
You're father now, and yet you still acting
like an infant!

1366
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:20,760
God damn it! Baby, you know, you got really
anger issues!

1367
01:13:20,764 --> 01:13:22,857
- You got so many emotional problem..
- Who was the one who threw in here..

1368
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,869
At three in the morning on that stupid helicopter?

1369
01:13:25,903 --> 01:13:27,768
And woke up Skylar.

1370
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:30,934
- That was you.
- Skylar, that fucking bullshit!

1371
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:47,948
Does it matter to you, that I just hit that
driving range, sided with bermuda grass..

1372
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:50,858
- Oh, My God, bermuda Grass.
- You fucking ridiculous!

1373
01:13:50,861 --> 01:13:54,991
No, you didn't research the whole thing, and

1374
01:13:55,032 --> 01:13:58,866
Oh my God, you had the deal with the golf
course people too!

1375
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:01,804
What a great tragedy, honey, oh My God.

1376
01:14:01,805 --> 01:14:05,866
You probably had to pay them in cash,
with you hand, what a fucking burns!

1377
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:10,005
And actually do some work besides swiping
my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1378
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:12,845
'Cause I can't keep tracking you profession,
honey!

1379
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:14,840
'Cause last month you're one connoisseur..

1380
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:17,945
And now you aspiring landscape architect,
let me get that right?

1381
01:14:17,988 --> 01:14:21,856
- Fuck you!
- No, no fucking dare throw that fucking
water at me!

1382
01:14:21,892 --> 01:14:23,860
Don't you fucking dare!

1383
01:14:23,994 --> 01:14:25,928
All right, honey?

1384
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:28,898
And we can just, we can talk this on, all right?

1385
01:14:28,966 --> 01:14:31,764
Just use our words, you know..

1386
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:33,927
Communicating, okay?

1387
01:14:34,838 --> 01:14:37,966
Come one sweetheart, talk to me.

1388
01:14:37,975 --> 01:14:41,877
Stop flexing your muscle Jordan, you look
like a fucking imbecile.

1389
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:44,743
Babe, come on, you should feel..

1390
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:48,979

1391
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:54,017
Come here, come on give me a kiss, you look

1392
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:55,747

1393
01:14:55,759 --> 01:14:57,852
- Kiss you?
- Yeah, give me one..

1394
01:14:58,829 --> 01:14:59,955
Fuck you!

1395
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:02,863
Ah, yes, my morning ritual.

1396
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:06,927
First I'd get up and fight with Naomi about
whatever is I did the night before,

1397
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:10,963
Next was a steam so I could sweat out the
drugs that still in my system..

1398
01:15:10,974 --> 01:15:12,874
Then I assess the damage.

1399
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:17,812
Drowned out my eyeball, take my back pill
to get the day started,

1400
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:19,873
Then seek to make up with Naomi.

1401
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:21,976
Good morning daddy.

1402
01:15:22,019 --> 01:15:24,852
Where's my kiss?

1403
01:15:25,789 --> 01:15:27,950
Hey, sweetheart..

1404
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:31,952
Could daddy get a kiss from
both of you little girls?

1405
01:15:31,995 --> 01:15:40,869
Oh no, no, daddy doesn't even get to touch
mommy, for a very very very long time

1406
01:15:40,871 --> 01:15:44,932
Daddy is really sorry about what he said
in the other room, he didn't mean any of it.

1407
01:15:45,008 --> 01:15:47,875
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1408
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:56,785
And from now on, it's gonna be nothing but short,
short skirt around the house.

1409
01:15:57,954 --> 01:16:00,821
And you know something else, daddy..

1410
01:16:01,892 --> 01:16:08,798
Mommy isjust so sick
and tired wearing panties

1411
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,825
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1412
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:24,769
In fact, she is decided to throw them
all away.

1413
01:16:28,919 --> 01:16:30,978
So take a good look daddy,

1414
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:34,986
You gonna be seeing all of this
around the house.

1415
01:16:35,926 --> 01:16:37,917
Yeah, mommy.

1416
01:16:38,795 --> 01:16:40,854
But no touching.

1417
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:49,966
- What's wrong daddy?
- oh, baby..

1418
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:52,968
God..

1419
01:16:54,845 --> 01:16:55,903
Look at this shit.

1420
01:16:55,946 --> 01:16:57,846
Okay, mommy likes to play game with daddy.

1421
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:02,716
Mommy..

1422
01:17:02,752 --> 01:17:08,850
Have you ever notice anything odd about
Mr. Fuzzybear over there?

1423
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,760
His eyes seems to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1424
01:17:13,897 --> 01:17:17,924
Yeah, there's something little bit different
about his eyes.

1425
01:17:18,735 --> 01:17:20,862
Yes, I think it's true,
say hi mommy!

1426
01:17:20,904 --> 01:17:23,737
Say Hi to Rocco and Rocco,
say hi.

1427
01:17:23,773 --> 01:17:25,741
Are you fellas see that, huh?

1428
01:17:25,775 --> 01:17:29,836
Of all the fucking days, she chooses today
to give me blue balls.

1429
01:17:29,913 --> 01:17:32,746
I mean today was the biggest day
in Stratton history..

1430
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:34,842
And I needed to be thinking straight.

1431
01:17:34,918 --> 01:17:36,909
Jordan, welcome!

1432
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:37,952
Steve here yet?

1433
01:17:37,954 --> 01:17:41,754
This was the day that we launch the Steve
Madden IPO.

1434
01:17:41,758 --> 01:17:43,749
Should be around here,
everyone are rallied, excited..

1435
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:46,785
Everything had to run tight, and had
to be perfect.

1436
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,889
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1437
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:50,796
What is he doing?

1438
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:55,768
The biggest IPO in the firm's history,
what the fuck is he doing?

1439
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:58,837

1442
01:18:03,914 --> 01:18:05,882
Are you cleaning the fish bowl?

1443
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:13,723

- You gotta minute, and today you need to clean
the wish bowl? today?

1444
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:16,987

1445
01:18:17,027 --> 01:18:19,860
Okay, nice to meet you.

1452
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,890
Get the fuck out!

1453

Everybody on port! We are here

1454
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:10,880
The real wolf pit, which
is exactly how I liked it

1455
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,815
Jordan, When I came to lobby I caught a genius.

1456
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,818
Enter, Steve Madden.

Get them fired up so they push the

Not only that, Donnie and I secretly own
85%% Steve Madden's shoes.

1464
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:39,932

Is because this man is a creative genius.

1483
01:20:53,016 --> 01:20:56,850
This ability, this gift that Steve has..

1484
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:59,946
.. goes beyond just, spotting the hottest shoe
trends.

1485
01:21:00,757 --> 01:21:04,022
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1486
01:21:04,027 --> 01:21:05,824
You understand?

1487
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:11,765
Oddest like Steve come along once every Decade,
I am talking George Romany, Gianni Versace,
Coco Schnell..

1488
01:21:11,835 --> 01:21:13,769
Izalora!

1489
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:15,735
Steve come over here for second.

1490
01:21:15,739 --> 01:21:17,934
I don't think you're all realized.

1491
01:21:18,007 --> 01:21:28,747
That Steve Madden is the hottest person in the
winning shoe industry with orders going through
the roof of every departmen store in North America

1492
01:21:28,818 --> 01:21:30,979
We have him here at our office!

1493
01:21:31,821 --> 01:21:34,790
We should thank our fucking lucky
star, this man is here.

1494
01:21:34,791 --> 01:21:39,922
We should be on our hands in knees right
now, getting ready to suck this guy off!

1495
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:43,988
Like this! Ok? I want to suck
you off, Steve!

1496
01:21:44,801 --> 01:21:46,860
Everyone is going to suck you off.

1497
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:51,772
This is our golden ticket into the
fucking chocolate factory right here.

1498
01:21:51,808 --> 01:21:55,744
And I want to meet Louis Vodka Wonka,
okay?

1499
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:58,976
And I want to meet with the fucking
Oompa Loompa like this!

1500
01:22:02,786 --> 01:22:04,947
All right, get off this fucking stage,
get out of here.

1501
01:22:05,822 --> 01:22:08,757
All right, I want you to focus
for a second.

1502
01:22:08,758 --> 01:22:10,783
See those little black boxes?

1503
01:22:10,827 --> 01:22:14,763
They call it telephone, I'm gonna let you in on
a little secret about this telephone.

1504
01:22:14,831 --> 01:22:17,732
It not gonna dial themselves, okay?

1505
01:22:17,734 --> 01:22:21,830
Without you, they just worthless
hungs of plastics.

1506
01:22:21,871 --> 01:22:26,001
Like a loaded M-16 without a trained marine
to pull the trigger.

1507
01:22:26,743 --> 01:22:28,870
And in the case of the Telephone,

1508
01:22:28,912 --> 01:22:32,848
It's up to each and every one of you..

1509
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:42,017
My hightly trained Strattonites,
my killers who will not take no for an answer.

1510
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:44,789
My fucking warriors.

1511
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:46,785
Who'll not hang up the phone.

1512
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:53,759
until their client either buys or
fucking die!

1513
01:23:06,883 --> 01:23:08,748
Let me tell you something.

1514
01:23:08,785 --> 01:23:11,913
There is no nobility in poverty.

1515
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:17,917
I've been a rich man, and I've been a poor man,
and I choose to rich every fucking time!

1516
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:23,765
'Coz at least as a rich man, when I have to face
my problems, I show up in the back of the limo..

1517
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:28,897
Wearing $2000 suite, and $14000
gold fucking watch.

1518
01:23:31,741 --> 01:23:33,902
Good boys, get him up! Hit him!

1519
01:23:33,943 --> 01:23:36,002
Fuck off from me!

1520
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:40,779
If there anyone here thinks I am superficial
of materialistic..

1521
01:23:40,817 --> 01:23:45,811
Go get a job in fucking McDonalds, 'cause
that's where you fucking belong!

1522
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:50,917
But before you depart this room
full of winners..

1523
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:54,895
I want you to take a good look at the
person next you, go on.

1524
01:23:55,765 --> 01:23:57,960
'Cause sometime in not so distant future..

1525
01:23:57,967 --> 01:24:04,930
You know, you pulled out to a red light and
you beat-up old fucking Pinto, and that person
gonna be pulling up right along side you..

1526
01:24:04,974 --> 01:24:07,909
In the brand new Porsche.

1527
01:24:07,911 --> 01:24:12,974
With their beautiful wife by their side,
who's got big full up juiced tits.

1528
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:15,943
And who will you be next to?

1529
01:24:15,952 --> 01:24:23,825
Some disgusting wildebeast with 3 days of razor
stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in the
next you with a carload of groceries from the

1530
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:24,986
.. fucking price club!

1531
01:24:24,994 --> 01:24:27,792
And that's who you're gonna be sitting next to!

1532
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:29,923
So you listen to me and you
listen well.

1533
01:24:29,933 --> 01:24:32,766
Are you behind on you credit card bills?

1534
01:24:32,835 --> 01:24:34,996
Good, pick up the
phone and start dialing!

1535
01:24:35,004 --> 01:24:37,905
Is the landlord ready to evict you? Good!

1536
01:24:37,941 --> 01:24:40,739
Pick up the phone, and start dialling!

1537
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:44,736
Is your girlfriend think you're fucking
worthless loser? Good!

1538
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:46,874
Pick up the phone and
start dialling!

1539
01:24:46,883 --> 01:24:51,013
I want you to deal with your problems
by becoming rich!

1540
01:24:52,021 --> 01:24:54,717
All you have to do today!

1541
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:56,884
Is pick up the phone.

1542
01:24:56,893 --> 01:24:59,953
And speak the words that I have taught you.

1543
01:24:59,963 --> 01:25:06,835
And I will make you richer than the most
powerfull CEO in the United States.

1544
01:25:09,739 --> 01:25:11,798
I want you to go out there..

1545
01:25:12,008 --> 01:25:17,844
And I want you to ram Steve Madden's stock down
to your clients throats..

1546
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,815
Till they fucking chokes on it.

1547
01:25:20,817 --> 01:25:25,880
Till they choke on it and the buy a hundred
thousands shares, that's what I want to do!

1548
01:25:25,989 --> 01:25:27,980
You need ferocious!

01:25:28,758 --> 01:25:29,986
You be relentless!

1550
01:25:30,026 --> 01:25:34,861
You'll be telephone fucking terrorist

1551
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:40,027
Now let's start this motherfucker
rolling around!

1552
01:25:40,737 --> 01:25:42,864
[MUSIC]

1553
01:26:08,898 --> 01:26:13,858
At one PM, we opened the stock for sale
at 4 dollar and 15 cent a share

1554
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:16,896
By 01:03, it was over $18.

1555
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:19,874
Even the big wallstreet firms were buying.

1556
01:26:28,918 --> 01:26:33,946
From the 2 million shares offered for sale, a
million belong to me held in phony accounts by my
ratholes.

1557
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:36,857
Now, once the price hit the high teens..

1558
01:26:36,993 --> 01:26:40,827
You know what? Who gives this
shit? As always, the point is this.

1559
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:45,927
$22.000.000 in 3 fucking hours!

1560
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:48,801
Can you believe it?

1561
01:26:48,838 --> 01:26:49,862
I get love this--

1562
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:50,839
Crazy account!

1563
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:54,741
Call for you! Berry Kleinman

1564
01:26:54,777 --> 01:26:57,871
- Who?
- I don't know, he shoot your wedding,
he said it's urgent.

1565
01:26:57,914 --> 01:26:59,905
Urgent? Who the fuck is Berry Kleinman?

1566
01:26:59,916 --> 01:27:02,714
Oh my God, you want to marry me?
You're in love with me?

1567
01:27:02,752 --> 01:27:03,912
Yeah, go fuck your cousin.

1568
01:27:03,953 --> 01:27:04,885
Berry, what's up?

1569
01:27:04,921 --> 01:27:08,948
- Listen, uh, I got this Subpoena..
- Subpoena? What are you talking about?

1570
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:10,983
The FBI, they want to copy of your
wedding video.

1571
01:27:11,027 --> 01:27:13,894
Fucking FBI? Are you fucking kidding me?

1572
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:17,923
Listen to me, his name is Denham, he is an
agent within the New York Office.

1573
01:27:17,934 --> 01:27:19,925
What is his problem? He's a boyscout!

1574
01:27:19,969 --> 01:27:22,733
Thinks you're fucking Gordon Gecko!

1575
01:27:22,972 --> 01:27:25,941
What does he want from my wedding video?
It's like invasion to my privacy.

1576
01:27:25,942 --> 01:27:28,843
You know what I am saying? It's like..
It's intrusive!, you know..

1577
01:27:28,878 --> 01:27:31,813
He's got picture of your whole inner
fucking circle

1578
01:27:31,848 --> 01:27:35,011
Pictures, name of the people, he is do what
is he wants to do, exactly what is he do.

1579
01:27:35,051 --> 01:27:38,817
Look at your self, he's try to rattle you,
he's try to rattle your old lady..

1580
01:27:38,821 --> 01:27:41,722
So she nagging you to turns become
a fucking witness.

1581
01:27:41,758 --> 01:27:44,852
Oh, so he wants me to rat on my self, he wants
me to give information about my..

1582
01:27:44,894 --> 01:27:48,762
- What your solution?
- The good fucking news, is I know everybody
down town.

1583
01:27:48,798 --> 01:27:54,737
I called the justice department, the DEA, nobody
even know you fucking exist. So calm down!

1584
01:27:54,737 --> 01:27:56,932
- They don't know I exist?
- No.

1585
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:58,873
That's Good.

1586
01:28:02,812 --> 01:28:06,714
- But you.. you know who is he, right?
- Yeah.

1587
01:28:06,749 --> 01:28:12,881
So if I just want to get some more information,
just find out what he know, you can.. you can go

1588
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:15,981

1589
01:28:16,025 --> 01:28:18,960
You don't fuck with these guys like this.

1590
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,759
You don't fuck with him like that, what do
nuts or something?

1591
01:28:21,798 --> 01:28:23,026
What do you fucking do? What did I pay you for?

1592
01:28:23,032 --> 01:28:25,796
I have a fucking PI license, you know?

1593
01:28:25,802 --> 01:28:27,861
I am making living at this, I am not
a cop anymore.

1594
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:30,771
- They'll take my fucking license away from me,
all right? - Okay.

1595
01:28:31,808 --> 01:28:35,904
Okay, if I can't do that, can I just
can I get the guy a call?

1596
01:28:36,779 --> 01:28:38,838
- Why? Is that..
- Jordan, Jordan..

1597
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:42,783
Do me a favor, the only one who

1598
01:28:42,819 --> 01:28:43,911
- Allright, okay..
- What would you do?

1599
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:50,018
I told you, whatever the fuck you say to him, he's
gonna use against you, don't you understand?!

1600
01:28:50,026 --> 01:28:52,017
He is smart, you dumb

01:28:53,763 --> 01:28:56,789
- I am not allowing call--
- Are we fucking talking tonite or you gonna

1603
01:29:01,037 --> 01:29:02,868
All right.

1604
01:29:02,872 --> 01:29:04,806
Okay, I won't call him.

1605
01:29:07,043 --> 01:29:11,776
Hey fellas, come on board, plank's
around there.

1606
01:29:11,948 --> 01:29:13,813
Welcome.

1607
01:29:13,816 --> 01:29:15,875
Huh, what a nice day.

1608
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,948
Hey, welcome aboard

1609
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:23,891
Jordan, welcome to the Naomi,
nice to meet you.

1610
01:29:23,893 --> 01:29:26,828
- Agent Denham, this is agent Hughes.
- Hi, how are you?

1611
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:27,796
Now, I'll introduce you..

1612
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:29,957
This Nicole, Heidi, come on,
don't be shy..

1613
01:29:29,966 --> 01:29:32,764
Why do you guys shy for?
Don't be scared..

1614
01:29:32,768 --> 01:29:33,860
These are friends of Stratton.

1615
01:29:33,903 --> 01:29:35,962
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

1616
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,867
- Come on..
- Your message said that..

1617
01:29:39,909 --> 01:29:41,843
You want to speak privately.

1618
01:29:41,844 --> 01:29:43,744
Right, I do want to speak privately.

1619
01:29:43,746 --> 01:29:44,838
Give us some minute, hey ladies?

1620
01:29:44,881 --> 01:29:47,873
- Let me know if I can get you anything.
- We'd be happy to help.

1621
01:29:48,784 --> 01:29:54,814
You guys hungry? Want some to eat? We got some
pasta, shrimp, lobster. I got whiskey and kind
of Booze..

1622
01:29:54,891 --> 01:29:57,951
You know what, the biro doesn't allow us
to drink while at sea.

1623
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,019
Duh, I forgot, of course.

1624
01:30:00,029 --> 01:30:01,997
Ever been on one of these before?

1625
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:03,891
A boat?

1626
01:30:04,734 --> 01:30:05,860
Learned to sail when I was six

1627
01:30:05,868 --> 01:30:07,927
No shit? Is that right? All right.

1628
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:09,904
I mean, one like this.

1629
01:30:09,939 --> 01:30:12,874
The whole front extended so it fit
the chopter up there.

1630
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:14,809
You see that?

1631
01:30:15,745 --> 01:30:16,803
Any way, this is for you.

1632
01:30:16,846 --> 01:30:20,009
It's uh, a complete list of every person
who was at my wedding..

1633
01:30:20,016 --> 01:30:25,784
Yeah, I understand you want the whole wedding
video, figured this would help the whole process,
right?

1634
01:30:25,788 --> 01:30:27,722
- There you go.
- Look..

1635
01:30:27,757 --> 01:30:30,726
My point is that I know you're investigating
Stratton..

1636
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,991
But for the life of me,
I can't figure it out why

1637
01:30:33,996 --> 01:30:39,866
I know we are little unorthodox, we are little
loud in the way we do things, we gotta understand
with the new guys on the block..

1638
01:30:39,902 --> 01:30:42,735
You know, trying to make an impression, but..

1639
01:30:42,838 --> 01:30:45,739
Now I want you to understand, we don't..

1640
01:30:45,741 --> 01:30:48,938
do anything Illegal, whatsoever.

1641
01:30:48,978 --> 01:30:53,813
You could talk to the SEC, there were at my
office 15 times for the last 6 month..

1642
01:30:53,849 --> 01:30:56,716
I mean I got nothing to hide.

1643
01:30:56,752 --> 01:31:00,916
Well, you know the SEC is civil right regulatory
agency, we pursue criminal activity.

1644
01:31:00,957 --> 01:31:04,757
Exactly, you go after real criminals..

1645
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:08,958
Makes me wonder what.. what the hell are you
doing sticking me for?

1646
01:31:08,965 --> 01:31:12,833
What is the thing that we did? or do?
I don't get it.

1647
01:31:12,868 --> 01:31:16,861
Well, I.. Jordan I can't discuss
ongoing investigations.

1648
01:31:16,872 --> 01:31:18,806
No, I get that, No I understand.

1649
01:31:18,808 --> 01:31:22,835
With that said, this case got dumped on
my desk.

1650
01:31:22,845 --> 01:31:24,870
- Did it?
- You know, by higher up who..

1651
01:31:24,914 --> 01:31:27,883
needs to make a show looking in and the
new company on the block..

1652
01:31:27,917 --> 01:31:29,817
- Loud guy..
- I got pressing and anything..

1653
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:32,913
And then I ended up be in the
smuch who does the local, exactly.

1654
01:31:32,955 --> 01:31:35,924
Itjust, you know, bothers me..
We are the new guy..

1655
01:31:35,925 --> 01:31:37,893
Where the one with bank there
in Wallstreet?

1656
01:31:37,893 --> 01:31:42,830
Oh man, you should see what's going on the
bigger firms, I mean I know all the information.

1657
01:31:42,865 --> 01:31:47,802
It's true, Goldman, Lehmann Brothers, Merryl,
collateralized debt obligation..

1658
01:31:47,837 --> 01:31:50,931
Internet stock bullshit? I mean, it's a fucking
travesty.

1659
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:55,968
I mean I can take you step by step, to what
exactly is occuring, you know..

1660
01:31:55,978 --> 01:31:58,970
All you have to do is ask.

1661
01:31:59,015 --> 01:32:00,846
It's exactly what I want to hear.

1662
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:05,981
- Hmm.
- I don't see why a little sitdown like this, can
be profitable for the both.

1663
01:32:06,022 --> 01:32:09,753
- It should, right, it should profitable.
- It should.

1664
01:32:09,759 --> 01:32:15,891
Look, I am gonna give my personal line, 5
days a week, you just call me, feel free.

1665
01:32:15,965 --> 01:32:18,934
- I'll do that.
- Great.

1666
01:32:21,904 --> 01:32:25,738
Are you sure you guys don't want some to
drink? I mean, you're not hungry? Nothing?

1667
01:32:25,808 --> 01:32:26,797
- Nothing?
- Oh no.

1668
01:32:26,809 --> 01:32:28,868
No.

1669
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:35,012
Mind if I ask you, and if you dont want to get
too personal, just tell me to shut up at anytime.

1670
01:32:35,985 --> 01:32:38,852
Did you try to get your broker's license
at one time?

1671
01:32:38,888 --> 01:32:42,016
Isn't that right? When you trying to take
a step at wallstreet?

1672
01:32:42,758 --> 01:32:44,020
- No?
- Who have been told it to you?

1673
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,751
- Who the fuck you've been talking to?
- Why you investigating me..

1674
01:32:46,762 --> 01:32:49,822
Hei, you see what I mean?

1675
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:54,826
You ever think about what would happen
if you're, you know, stay in the course.

1676
01:32:55,938 --> 01:33:00,966
You know what? When I ridin' home on the subway,
and my balls are fucking sweating, I'm wearing the
same suit 3 days in a row,

1677
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:04,844
Yeah, you bet I do, I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't rite?

1678
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,847
Yeah, who fucking wouldn't?

1679
01:33:05,848 --> 01:33:08,783
I mean, what do you.. another personal question,
no need to answer if you don't like..

1680
01:33:08,818 --> 01:33:09,842
No, that's all right, Jordan.

1681
01:33:09,852 --> 01:33:12,878
Whattaya pull in? 50? 60'k?
something like that?

1682
01:33:12,922 --> 01:33:14,913
A year? Low part?

1683
01:33:16,826 --> 01:33:18,726
Let's put it this way.

1684
01:33:18,794 --> 01:33:21,786
You get a free hand gun when you
sign up for the biro.

1685
01:33:21,931 --> 01:33:23,899
No, but it is fucking pisses me off, you know.

1686
01:33:23,933 --> 01:33:27,926
When you think about the people that build
this country, hardworking people like you..

1687
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:30,803
You know, fire fighters, teachers,
FBI agent..

1688
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:35,971
End of the day you guys get fucking skin-the-life
financially, fucking makes me angry.

1689
01:33:36,045 --> 01:33:39,947
That's the one thing about Wall street, in this
market is, for me..

1690
01:33:39,949 --> 01:33:44,784
I feel it's good to give back, you know,

1691
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,879
There's situation where I can..

1692
01:33:46,922 --> 01:33:50,722
make those situations better for people.

1693
01:33:50,826 --> 01:33:51,918
You know what I mean.

1694
01:33:51,927 --> 01:33:54,862
Opportunity is everything.

1695
01:33:54,897 --> 01:33:56,728
Exactly.

1696
01:33:56,765 --> 01:33:58,960
Take for example I got this one
kid, right?

1697
01:33:59,902 --> 01:34:02,837
He went to school for environmental
science something like that..

1698
01:34:02,872 --> 01:34:07,809
He was bogged down by students loan,
turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery

1699
01:34:07,843 --> 01:34:09,811
- Right, horrible situation.
- Sure.

1700
01:34:09,845 --> 01:34:14,873
We got them minute, the market, the right time,
choose the right stock, we gave him the right
guidance..

1701
01:34:14,884 --> 01:34:17,751
Bom, overnight, change his entire life..

1702
01:34:17,786 --> 01:34:20,914
You know, He gotta put his mother into
the best hospital in New York City.

1703
01:34:21,824 --> 01:34:24,918
It didn't work out for her, she passed
away unfortunately, but..

1704
01:34:24,927 --> 01:34:27,919
We gave him that opportunity,
you know what I am saying?

1705
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:32,990
Itjust about sending up the right team and
then overnight your life can change.

1706
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:44,775
What if.. what is.. what is the intern to make
a deal like that?

1707
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,008
Oh that's the situation.

1708
01:34:46,048 --> 01:34:49,984
I mean, that particular trade,
and one trade.

1709
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:53,788
North of half a million dollar.

1710
01:34:56,859 --> 01:35:01,887
And I do that for anybody, you know, anybody
that needs the proper guidance.

1711
01:35:21,784 --> 01:35:25,914
Can you say that again? Just the
way you said it.

1712
01:35:25,955 --> 01:35:27,923
Just the same way.

1713
01:35:31,927 --> 01:35:33,724
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No..

1714
01:35:33,762 --> 01:35:34,922
- Oh come on, you know what I am talking about.
- No, I don't know..

1715
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:37,728
Say this, I think Jordan just did..

1716
01:35:37,766 --> 01:35:38,824
- If I am not mistake
- No.

1717
01:35:38,834 --> 01:35:41,928
- You just tried to bribe a federal agent.
- Oh, technically I didn't.

1718
01:35:41,971 --> 01:35:44,872
I didn't bribe anybody, technically, I didn't.

1719
01:35:44,873 --> 01:35:50,812
No, according to US criminal code, there needs to
be exact dollar to give for the exchange services.

1720
01:35:50,846 --> 01:35:53,906
that would not hold up on the court of law..

1721
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:55,975
No, no, no, that's the truth, but..

1722
01:35:55,985 --> 01:35:57,850
- I want to tell you this.
- Yeah.

1723
01:35:57,886 --> 01:36:03,825
The same gentlemen that told me that you try to
get your brokers license also told me that you're
straight arrow.

1724
01:36:03,826 --> 01:36:06,795
- You ran a security check on me?
- Well..

1725
01:36:07,763 --> 01:36:11,927
Sail on the boat, fit for Bond villain,
sometimes you need to play the part, right?

1726
01:36:12,935 --> 01:36:16,735
I think it's time you both get the fuck
off my boat, what do you say?

1727
01:36:17,773 --> 01:36:18,797
You know Jordan, I'll tell you something.

1728
01:36:18,807 --> 01:36:21,935
- Most of the wallstreetjackasses that I bust..
- Yeah.

1729
01:36:21,977 --> 01:36:24,810
They're.. they were the man for born.

1730
01:36:24,847 --> 01:36:25,905
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1731
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:29,941
Their father is douchebag, just like the
fathers before them

1732
01:36:30,753 --> 01:36:31,947
But you..

1733
01:36:32,988 --> 01:36:36,981
- You got this all way on your own.
- Did I?

1734
01:36:36,992 --> 01:36:39,825
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

1735
01:36:39,862 --> 01:36:41,921
- Good for you.
- Me, the little man?

1736
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:43,830
Let me tell you something.

1737
01:36:43,832 --> 01:36:45,800
No, let me tell you something else.

1738
01:36:45,834 --> 01:36:49,736
Honestly, I am not bullshit here, this is one of
the nicest boat I've ever been on,

1739
01:36:49,738 --> 01:36:50,864
- I got tell you this.
- I bet it is.

1740
01:36:50,873 --> 01:36:52,841
And you know what I just thinking too?

1741
01:36:52,841 --> 01:36:55,810
what a fucking hero that I am gonna
back at the office..

1742
01:36:55,878 --> 01:37:01,817
When the bureau seizes this fucking boat,
because I am being fucked this, fuck, fuck..

1743
01:37:01,884 --> 01:37:05,012
It's beautiful, and you got the beautiful
girls there.

1744
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:08,786
- It's wonderful.
- Okay, get the fuck off my boat.

1745
01:37:08,857 --> 01:37:10,882
I am sure we'll be seeing each other
real soon.

1746
01:37:10,893 --> 01:37:14,920
I am sure, good luck on that subway ride home,
and your miserable ugly fucking wife

1747
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:17,990
I am gonna have Heidi lick some caviar off
my balls in the mean time..

1748
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,901
Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters
for your ride home.

1749
01:37:20,936 --> 01:37:25,873
Fucking miserable bricks, I know you can't
afford 'em, fucking cheap fuck.

1750
01:37:25,908 --> 01:37:27,967
Fuck those people.

1751
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:31,810
Hey fellas, look what I found in my pocket!

1752
01:37:31,847 --> 01:37:33,781
Your salary, right here!

1753
01:37:33,782 --> 01:37:36,717
You know what I call 'em?
Fun coupon.

1754
01:37:36,752 --> 01:37:37,844
See that?

1755
01:37:37,853 --> 01:37:39,946
The fun coupon.

1756
01:37:47,863 --> 01:37:50,798
What's hon? What the fuck is in switzerland?

1757
01:37:50,833 --> 01:37:52,824
Swiss fucking bank, that's what.

1758
01:37:52,835 --> 01:37:55,861
He was ask couple of time.
I had to hide my money.

1759
01:37:56,872 --> 01:37:57,998
Enter Rugrat.

1760
01:37:58,006 --> 01:38:00,839
He knew this Swiss Banker from law school.

1761
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:05,973
But he was in Geneva, and there's no way I was
gonna make that flight sober.

1762
01:38:06,815 --> 01:38:08,783
So I knew if I took my drugs right

1763
01:38:08,817 --> 01:38:10,876
I could sleep to the entire flight.

1764
01:38:10,919 --> 01:38:13,854
But I had to take them just right.

1765
01:38:13,856 --> 01:38:20,921
At 4 p.m. I pooped a few more ludes,
which is start kicking in by the time I
finished my sales meeting. My dingle face.

1766
01:38:20,929 --> 01:38:25,889
By dinner, I popped a few more, on top
of some coctail and valium too.

1767
01:38:25,934 --> 01:38:27,993
My slur phase

1768
01:38:29,772 --> 01:38:31,933
By eight thirty, I took a few more ludes..

1769
01:38:31,974 --> 01:38:34,807
I am pretty much lost all my motor skill.

1770
01:38:34,943 --> 01:38:37,002
This was the drool face.

1771
01:38:39,782 --> 01:38:42,945
And by ten, I didn't know who or what
the fuck I was.

1772
01:38:42,951 --> 01:38:45,010
The Amnesia phase.

1773
01:38:45,754 --> 01:38:47,813
And boarded to the plane just before
midnight.

1774
01:38:47,856 --> 01:38:50,848
- Ah look at you, you're so beautiful.
- Excuse me..

1775
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,853
It's his sleeping pills, he's all right,
he's all right.

1776
01:38:53,862 --> 01:38:56,922
- May I ask your boarding pass, sir?
- We have the boarding pass.

1777
01:38:57,032 --> 01:38:59,865
Jesus Christ, I am so sleepy.

1778
01:38:59,868 --> 01:39:01,859
Hey, relax!

1779
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:04,737
Oh my God, you got your hand
on my fucking cock!

1780
01:39:04,773 --> 01:39:07,799
Get in chair, this guy is touching
my dick again.

1781
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:09,869
- You got his hand on his dick?
- You gotta stop doing that..

1782
01:39:09,912 --> 01:39:11,777
...in public space.

1783
01:39:11,814 --> 01:39:12,940
Take it off.

1784
01:39:12,948 --> 01:39:14,006
Take it off.

1785
01:39:14,049 --> 01:39:16,916
I heard there's treasure map under this..

1786
01:39:17,953 --> 01:39:19,784
- Excuse me sir.
- I know miss.

1787
01:39:19,822 --> 01:39:20,982
Please sit down..

1788
01:39:20,989 --> 01:39:22,820
- Watch him.
- Go back to your seat please.

1789
01:39:22,858 --> 01:39:24,985
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

1790
01:39:25,727 --> 01:39:26,853
I had been have to call the taxing.

1791
01:39:26,895 --> 01:39:29,830
Please sir, please, sit down.

1792
01:39:29,865 --> 01:39:32,732
- Please, Sit down!
- Okay, okay, I am going!

1793
01:39:32,768 --> 01:39:34,963
- Stop!
- We apologize, we are going to sleep ma'am.

1794
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:35,994
We're sleeping as you question.

1795
01:39:36,038 --> 01:39:37,835
Fasten your seatbelt, sir.

1796

1799
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:45,940
- Okay.

1800
01:39:46,014 --> 01:39:47,914
We don't understand this languages, mam..

1801

I will help him fasten his seatbelt..

1802
01:39:49,751 --> 01:39:50,979
I am not a fucking idiot.

1803
01:39:51,019 --> 01:39:52,953
Sit back, sit back!

1804
01:39:52,955 --> 01:39:55,788
There you go, yeah there you go!

1805
01:39:57,993 --> 01:40:02,828
- Hilfa!
- Hilfa!

1806
01:40:14,009 --> 01:40:17,001
Jesus christ, fuck.

1807
01:40:18,881 --> 01:40:23,875
Donnie, this isn't funny, you
must untie me, buddy.

1808
01:40:23,886 --> 01:40:25,877
I can't untie you.

1809
01:40:25,888 --> 01:40:28,880
The captain tied you up, he almost
fucking teasing you.

1810
01:40:29,825 --> 01:40:32,760
- Why?
- Why?

1811
01:40:45,874 --> 01:40:47,865
You were screaming at the people.

1812
01:40:49,778 --> 01:40:52,747
You are on the floor, like rolling
around and shit.

1813
01:40:52,781 --> 01:40:56,808
- You called the captain the "N" word.
- I called the captain the "N" word?

1814
01:40:56,852 --> 01:40:58,979
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

1815
01:40:58,987 --> 01:41:01,888
- Luckyly we're in the first class.
- Oh jesus.

1816
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:05,858
Jesus christ, I think you have a fucking
drug problem!

1817
01:41:05,961 --> 01:41:11,831
- Where the ludes?
- There're at my ass, don't worry about it.

1818
01:41:11,867 --> 01:41:12,959
I got it.

1819
01:41:12,968 --> 01:41:14,936
Thank god.

1820
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:18,872
Jesus Christ, what we gonna do when we

1822
01:41:22,844 --> 01:41:24,869
Okay, Shut the fuck off, shut the fuck off.

1823
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,007
- Oh please?
- Okay, sshh

1824
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:29,941
That's good.
Go to sleep.

1825
01:41:29,985 --> 01:41:32,818
- Harder buddy.
- You're all right.

1826
01:41:32,854 --> 01:41:35,015
We're all love you..
Shut the fuck off!

1827
01:41:40,862 --> 01:41:44,821
Mr. Belfort, you're free go.

1828
01:41:45,901 --> 01:41:48,802
Really?

1829
01:41:51,006 --> 01:41:51,973
- Hi, Donnie.
- Yeah?

1830
01:41:51,974 --> 01:41:56,001
When we get up there, try not to act like
yourself, okay, let's make you even ass hole
version Donnie, all right?

1831
01:41:56,044 --> 01:41:57,978
- Why phone and call me to come for?
- Hey listen.

1832
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:00,847
The only reason you sitting in this limo and not
a Swiss dale 'cause you're my friend,

1833
01:42:00,849 --> 01:42:02,783
- Ok?
- Hilfa!

1834
01:42:02,985 --> 01:42:05,954
- We're here, here, we're here.
- I am more calm down, come on.

1835
01:42:05,954 --> 01:42:08,889
Jordan Belfort, at last..

1836
01:42:08,924 --> 01:42:11,825
Nicholas has told me so much about you.

1837
01:42:11,827 --> 01:42:14,921
- Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.
- Pleasure to make your acquiantes.

1838
01:42:14,963 --> 01:42:16,828
Nice to meet you.

1839
01:42:17,966 --> 01:42:19,729
You understand what we're talking?

1840
01:42:19,768 --> 01:42:20,962
Oh, ok.

1841
01:42:20,969 --> 01:42:23,904
- Couch, for desk.
- I don't understand, I am sorry.

1842
01:42:23,939 --> 01:42:27,773
I am curious about your
bank secrecy laws here.

1843
01:42:29,778 --> 01:42:31,939
Wait, yes, excuse me Jordan.

1844
01:42:32,781 --> 01:42:37,013
- Swiss custom, we require 10 minutes of bla bla.
- Chit chat.

1845
01:42:37,019 --> 01:42:39,988
Chit chat thank you, before business
can be discussed.

1846
01:42:41,757 --> 01:42:42,917
Yeah.

1847
01:42:44,993 --> 01:42:48,759
Of course, let's get down to it.

1848
01:42:48,797 --> 01:42:50,765
What would you like to know?

1849
01:42:50,766 --> 01:42:55,897
Under what circumstances would you be obligated
to cooperate with the FBI or..

1850
01:42:55,937 --> 01:42:59,839
US justice department investigations,
for example?

1851
01:42:59,841 --> 01:43:01,741
Ca depend.

1852
01:43:01,777 --> 01:43:03,904
- Ca depend?
- Yeah.

1853
01:43:04,846 --> 01:43:07,872
Ca depend on what exactly?

1854
01:43:07,983 --> 01:43:11,976
Whether America plans to invade
Switzerland in upcoming month.

1855
01:43:12,754 --> 01:43:15,848
- So you want check the tank are rolling down
the Ru de La Croix? - Yes, Ru de La Croix

1856
01:43:15,891 --> 01:43:16,983
- Ah, Croix!
- Yeah, Croix

1857
01:43:17,025 --> 01:43:19,960
Not Croix, not even Ru de La Croix, Croix

1858
01:43:19,961 --> 01:43:23,727
This is what we used to do back in law school,
Champagne - Champagna.

1859
01:43:23,765 --> 01:43:27,030
- Yeah.
- yeah yeah, french fries or Frittes.

1860
01:43:27,736 --> 01:43:28,794
And kind uh..

1861
01:43:28,837 --> 01:43:30,964
- That kind of stuff.
- That's right.

1862
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:33,901
What I'm asking you, Swiss dick,

1863
01:43:33,942 --> 01:43:36,877
is are you going to fuck me over?

1864
01:43:38,947 --> 01:43:43,008
I understand perfectly,
you American shit.

1865
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:49,789
The only way the Banque Real de
Geneve would cooperate with a
foreign legal body

1866
01:43:49,825 --> 01:43:53,886
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.

1867
01:43:53,895 --> 01:43:58,958
But there are very few Swiss laws
which applied to your "practises"

1868
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,968
from a financial standpoint.

1869
01:44:00,969 --> 01:44:04,735
You are now in heaven.

1870
01:44:04,773 --> 01:44:06,866
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

1871
01:44:06,975 --> 01:44:10,775
If the US Justice Department
sent us as subpoena,

1872
01:44:10,779 --> 01:44:13,873
it will become a,
um.. papier-toillette.

1873
01:44:14,850 --> 01:44:17,785
- We will wipe our ass with it.
- [LAUGHING]

1874
01:44:17,786 --> 01:44:21,722
Unless, of course, it was an
investigation into stock fraud

1875
01:44:21,757 --> 01:44:24,749
which is a crime here in
Switzerland, if I'm correct.

1876
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:29,788
Then there would have to be co-operation,
on your part, if I'm not mistaken.

1877
01:44:29,831 --> 01:44:32,766
Yes. Yes, we would

1878
01:44:33,001 --> 01:44:35,993
Assuming the account is under your name.

1879
01:44:36,972 --> 01:44:40,840
If it were another name

1880
01:44:40,942 --> 01:44:43,911
- of friends, I get my..
- Cousin.

1881
01:44:43,945 --> 01:44:45,936
Cousin, absolutely no.

1882
01:44:48,884 --> 01:44:50,943
- Relative.
- Yeah.

1883
01:44:52,888 --> 01:44:55,755
Was that yodeling I just heard or..

1884
01:44:55,757 --> 01:44:57,918
Did you just say what
I thought he said?

1885
01:44:57,959 --> 01:45:00,792
Yes. Yes.

1886
01:45:00,796 --> 01:45:02,991
He's telling me to use a fucking
rathole.

1887
01:45:02,998 --> 01:45:06,991
But the US rathole would never get
into Switzerland with all that money.

1888
01:45:07,035 --> 01:45:11,870
What I needed was a rathole with a
European passport.

1889
01:45:11,907 --> 01:45:14,808
[MUSIC]

1890
01:45:18,747 --> 01:45:20,942
- Jordan.
- Hey.

1891
01:45:20,949 --> 01:45:24,783
- How's my favourite aunt?
- Welcome, was the traffic terrible?

1892
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:26,845
Oh, no, not at all.

1893
01:45:28,757 --> 01:45:30,725
Jordan, Come on in

1894
01:45:30,759 --> 01:45:33,751
Thank God, aunt Emma didn't
need too much convincing.

1895
01:45:33,795 --> 01:45:35,956
Turned out the British weren't
too different from the Swiss.

1896
01:45:35,997 --> 01:45:38,966
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.

1897
01:45:38,967 --> 01:45:41,731
How do you say "rathole" in British?

1898
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:43,931
.. If you gettin' any trouble whatsoever,

1899
01:45:43,939 --> 01:45:46,840
I'll come for it immediately,
I'll say that I duped you.

1900
01:45:46,875 --> 01:45:48,843
And I promise.

1901
01:45:48,877 --> 01:45:51,812
Risk is what keeps us
young, isn't it darling?

1902
01:45:55,817 --> 01:45:57,876
Sometimes I wonder,

1903
01:45:57,919 --> 01:46:00,911
if you let money get
the best of you, my love,

1904
01:46:00,956 --> 01:46:04,756
among other substances.

1905
01:46:04,759 --> 01:46:07,785
Ooh.. [LAUGHING]

1906
01:46:08,797 --> 01:46:09,889
Is that obvious, huh?

1907
01:46:09,931 --> 01:46:13,731
It's chilly darling,
you're sweating bullets.

1908
01:46:15,904 --> 01:46:17,895
What can I say, I'm um..

1909
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:20,774
I'm a drug addict.

1910
01:46:20,809 --> 01:46:22,834
I'm not really am, I, I mean..

1911
01:46:22,878 --> 01:46:24,937
Coccain, pills,

1912
01:46:24,946 --> 01:46:27,847
whatever it is, I'll fuckin' do it.

1913
01:46:28,016 --> 01:46:29,847
That's the truth.

1914
01:46:29,885 --> 01:46:32,979
I am.. I am sex addict too.

1915
01:46:33,788 --> 01:46:36,882
Well there are worse things to be
addicted to than sex. [LAUGHING]

1916
01:46:37,025 --> 01:46:40,859
Jesus, why am I telling you all this?
I am sorry.

1917
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:44,831
Because I'm very easy to talk to

1918
01:46:44,833 --> 01:46:47,802
You are. You are easy to talk to.

1919
01:46:48,803 --> 01:46:50,737
That's about it, it's..

1920
01:46:50,772 --> 01:46:52,797
It'sjust my job, you know, it's uh..

1921
01:46:52,807 --> 01:46:57,710
All these people depending on me, tens of
millions of dollars at stake, you know, it's..

1922
01:46:57,746 --> 01:47:02,774
Sometimes I feel like I've bitten
off more than I can chew, you know?

1923
01:47:02,851 --> 01:47:04,944
You're a man with large appetites.

1924
01:47:04,953 --> 01:47:07,012
yeah.

1925
01:47:07,956 --> 01:47:10,015
Is she fuckin' hittin' on me?

1926
01:47:10,025 --> 01:47:12,789
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1927
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:18,764
Suppose I put that on myself though, right?

1928
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,791
My decision.

1929
01:47:20,869 --> 01:47:21,927
It is hard, though..

1930
01:47:21,970 --> 01:47:26,839
Hard to learn to control the
anxiety, sometimes, you know?

1931
01:47:26,841 --> 01:47:28,775
You know, to..

1932
01:47:28,810 --> 01:47:31,836
Learn to relax, and let go, and..

1933
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:34,847
To release the tension.

1934
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,843
She is hittin' on me. [LAUGHING]

1935
01:47:37,852 --> 01:47:39,717
Holy shit.

1936
01:47:39,754 --> 01:47:41,881
I got to release the tension.

1937
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,890
Suppose we, uh.. We
all just need to learn.

1938
01:47:50,899 --> 01:47:53,959
Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?

1939
01:47:55,937 --> 01:47:58,838
Is he fucking hitting on me?

1940
01:48:04,846 --> 01:48:07,747
Stability, dear. Family.

1941
01:48:14,789 --> 01:48:16,848
You take care of my nice, my love.

1942
01:48:16,925 --> 01:48:18,825
I'll take care of everything over here.

1943
01:48:19,961 --> 01:48:20,928
Deal.

1944
01:48:23,898 --> 01:48:24,990
Hold on! There you go!

1945
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,797
[GROANING]

1946
01:48:26,835 --> 01:48:27,893
[SCREAMING]

1947
01:48:27,902 --> 01:48:30,996
We had, literally, a fuck load of money.

1948
01:48:31,873 --> 01:48:34,842
Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself.

1949
01:48:34,876 --> 01:48:38,004
So I thought to myself, who
else has European passport?

1950
01:48:38,013 --> 01:48:40,777
Okay Brad, you're making
this too fuckin' tight.

1951
01:48:40,815 --> 01:48:43,010
Now, Brad, as a successful drug dealer,

1952
01:48:43,752 --> 01:48:45,845
spent his winters in the south of France,

1953
01:48:45,887 --> 01:48:47,878
which is where he met his wife, Chantelle.

1954
01:48:47,889 --> 01:48:50,858
A striper of Slovenian origin,

1955
01:48:50,892 --> 01:48:54,726
born in, of all places, Switzerland.

1956
01:48:58,833 --> 01:49:00,824
Well, this is fucked.

1957
01:49:00,835 --> 01:49:02,803
Oh, no, shit!

1958
01:49:06,007 --> 01:49:09,943
- Like this will take a, like, 50 trips.
- I know.

1959
01:49:13,815 --> 01:49:14,873
Yeah, a suicide work.

1960
01:49:14,949 --> 01:49:17,816
But, how about her family? Right?

1961
01:49:17,852 --> 01:49:19,979
I mean, they all got
Swiss's passport, right?

1962
01:49:19,988 --> 01:49:21,922
I mean, she's got parents,
she's got a brother.

1963
01:49:21,956 --> 01:49:24,720
Right, brother's got a wife,
that's five fuckin' people.

1964
01:49:24,759 --> 01:49:26,727
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

1965
01:49:26,761 --> 01:49:28,956
They're all fuckin' Swiss and it was like,
"what are you doing?", they could do that.

1966
01:49:28,997 --> 01:49:31,830
At least I have a family,
you crooked nose fuck!

1967
01:49:31,866 --> 01:49:34,926
Hey, hey, uh, don't
forget about my money.

1968
01:49:36,771 --> 01:49:38,796

- Yeah.

1971
01:49:43,945 --> 01:49:46,004
And when it gets here, I'll give
you a call, you come pick it up.

1972
01:49:49,017 --> 01:49:50,814
You give me a call?

1973
01:49:51,986 --> 01:49:55,786
When it gets here, I'll give you
a call, and you come pick it up.

1974
01:49:55,824 --> 01:49:57,724
Well, we don't fuckin'
work for you, man!

1975
01:49:57,759 --> 01:49:58,020
Shh..

1976
01:49:58,026 --> 01:50:00,893
Sweetheart, you have my
money taped to your tits.

1977
01:50:00,929 --> 01:50:02,897
Okay? Technically you do work for me.

1978
01:50:05,934 --> 01:50:07,731
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

1979
01:50:07,769 --> 01:50:09,964
If I fuckin' do this, I'm telling
you right now, I ain't goin' to him.

1980
01:50:10,004 --> 01:50:12,905
Okay? I'm not a fuckin' schwas, I
don't do fuckin' pick-ups, alright?

1981
01:50:12,941 --> 01:50:14,806
- But listen to me, when this thing placed,
- I'm gonna take care of everything.

1982
01:50:14,843 --> 01:50:16,868
and I fuckin' say, and you

1983
01:50:16,911 --> 01:50:17,969
- If he comes correct.
- I will.

1984
01:50:18,012 --> 01:50:22,779
If he comes in, I'll fuckin' loopy and fucked up.
I swear to God, I'm a mash that douchebag's teeth.

1985
01:50:22,817 --> 01:50:24,785
I hear that, who's fucking cheating?

1986
01:50:24,819 --> 01:50:26,719
- Who's fuckin' cheating?!
- Look, may I asking..

1987
01:50:26,754 --> 01:50:28,881
I put the money on that
fuckin' table, not you!

1988
01:50:28,923 --> 01:50:30,857
I'm the reason we
have this fuckin' deal!

1989
01:50:30,859 --> 01:50:32,793
- I have a gun, you fucking idiot!
- What the fuck this gun.

1990
01:50:32,827 --> 01:50:33,885
I already told you this.

1991
01:50:33,928 --> 01:50:37,830
You know what? You're a fuckin' pill
deal, I got five more just like you, bro!

1992
01:50:37,866 --> 01:50:39,766
Keep talking, you piece of shit!

1993
01:50:39,767 --> 01:50:41,860
Do you know what? You dress like shit!

1994
01:50:41,903 --> 01:50:43,894
- So, fuck you!

1996
01:50:46,774 --> 01:50:47,832
- Enough with your shit!
- You okay?

1997
01:50:47,876 --> 01:50:48,843
Hey pal!

1998
01:50:50,945 --> 01:50:53,880
The next day, aunt Emma flew to Geneve.

1999
01:50:53,915 --> 01:50:56,748
Two million in cash in her carry on.

2000
01:50:56,784 --> 01:50:59,753
Which in a big picture was
a drop in the Swiss bucket.

2001
01:51:00,788 --> 01:51:03,848
'Cause the following month,
over the course of six roundtrips,

2002
01:51:03,892 --> 01:51:08,920
Chantelle's family and friends smugglin'
over 20 millon in cash without even a hiccup.

2003
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:10,921
- Shred it.
- And by the way..

2004
01:51:10,965 --> 01:51:14,867
- Here they are.

[LAUGHING] Welcome?

2010
01:51:25,013 --> 01:51:27,811
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2011
01:51:27,849 --> 01:51:29,840
- Slovenian. Yes.
- Slovenian? Okay.

2012
01:51:29,851 --> 01:51:32,820
- So you're blonde?
- Oh, stop that.

2013
01:51:52,874 --> 01:51:53,806
Shit.

2014
01:51:53,841 --> 01:51:57,902
Put the fuckin' car
parked, you dumb idiot!

2015
01:51:57,946 --> 01:52:00,710
Yeah, close the briefcase.

2016
01:52:00,748 --> 01:52:03,774
One fuckin' day, one fuckin' day
you couldn't keep it together?

2017
01:52:03,818 --> 01:52:05,843
I was fucked up, Brad.

2018
01:52:05,887 --> 01:52:07,855
- You're fuckin' kidding me!
- Fucked up.

2019
01:52:13,027 --> 01:52:14,790
- It's a joke!
- It's a joke?

2020
01:52:14,829 --> 01:52:16,922
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

2021
01:52:16,965 --> 01:52:19,763
- It's a fuckin' joke. I'm not stupid.
- Are you fuckin' stupid?

2022
01:52:19,767 --> 01:52:20,961
- You fuckin' drivin' you like a fuckin' maniac.
- Do you know what..

2023
01:52:21,002 --> 01:52:24,768
- You know the attention that fuckin' draws?
- You know what, I'm not stupid.

2024
01:52:24,806 --> 01:52:25,795
- I'm smart.
- Smart?

2025
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,865
- I make million dollar deal.
- That's right.

2026
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:30,742
We smart important people, unlike you.

2027
01:52:30,745 --> 01:52:34,010
People who don't sucker punch
people when they're scared, okay?

2028
01:52:34,749 --> 01:52:35,773
- I'm scared?
- And by the way,

2029
01:52:35,817 --> 01:52:37,910
- I haven't got an apology for that.
- One apology, okay.

2030
01:52:37,952 --> 01:52:39,817
I check my fuckin' messages everyday

2031
01:52:39,854 --> 01:52:40,786

- Did you?

2032
01:52:40,822 --> 01:52:41,811

- You didn't got one, huh?

2033
01:52:41,823 --> 01:52:43,916
zero! I got a blinking light
because I don't have shit from you!

2034
01:52:43,958 --> 01:52:46,756
- Yeah right. You know, you got a big
fuckin' mouth! - I got my wife, I got my wife

2035
01:52:46,794 --> 01:52:48,921
checking the messages every 45
minutes, calling the office say,

2036
01:52:48,963 --> 01:52:52,729
has Brad apologize? Is there any
apology message on the machine?

2037
01:52:52,767 --> 01:52:53,825
- Alright, do you know what..
- I don't have jack shit.

2038
01:52:53,868 --> 01:52:56,837
- You know what? That's not how you treat me.
- Yeah, you got a big fuckin' mouth. You know

2039
01:52:56,871 --> 01:52:58,736
I'm not gonna give you a fuckin'
pass, just give me the case.

2040
01:52:58,773 --> 01:53:00,900
- Oh, you're not gonna give me a pass?
- Get out of here.

2041
01:53:00,942 --> 01:53:02,000
Look, it's a figure fuckin' speech.

2042
01:53:02,043 --> 01:53:04,739
- Oh my God, the Emperor of Foxville
- Just give me the fuckin' case

2043
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:06,872
came down from Foxville
to give me a pass!

2044
01:53:06,914 --> 01:53:09,974
Hey, what are the citizens of Foxville
doing at the day when the Emperor's gone?

2045
01:53:10,018 --> 01:53:11,986
- I'm begging you.
- Is it, is it mayhem?

2046
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:13,885
Or people looting and raping?

2047
01:53:13,921 --> 01:53:15,786
What all the little fuckhead doing?

I'm fuckin' saying!

2051
01:53:20,728 --> 01:53:24,721
That if I ever cross you in my
life, if you come at me again,

2052
01:53:24,799 --> 01:53:25,925
- Just fuckin' keep it down.
- You know what?

2053
01:53:25,967 --> 01:53:31,928
I got it. I don't want to be avoiding
anything, but I think you like, like..

2054
01:53:31,939 --> 01:53:32,963
- Like, when you come at me,
- What the fuck?

2055
01:53:33,007 --> 01:53:34,872

You have like a twinkle, were
you trying to kiss me, bro?

2059
01:53:41,783 --> 01:53:42,875

2062
01:53:46,954 --> 01:53:48,854
- You're just not the one for me, pal.
- Okay.

2063
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:51,791
You know what I mean? It's not,
it's not about that for me, you know?

2064
01:53:51,826 --> 01:53:52,918
- You understand?

2065
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,825

I need you to open up the briefcase,

01:54:02,737 --> 01:54:06,730
and you take out every single dollar,
don't leave one dollar inside the briefcase.

2072
01:54:06,774 --> 01:54:09,743
I want you to have it all neatly
organized outside the briefcase,

2073
01:54:09,777 --> 01:54:10,835
and you to take it,

01:54:28,796 --> 01:54:30,855
Drop the case, put your hands in the air!

2090
01:54:49,817 --> 01:54:52,718
Do I have a surprise for you.

2091
01:54:52,987 --> 01:54:54,887
20 real lemons.

Retired pharmacist friend of mine,
it been in his safe for 15 years.

You fuckin' kiddin' me? Lemons?

2094
01:54:59,026 --> 01:55:01,995
- [LAUGHING]
- They're gonna knock us out off our fuckin' head.

2095
01:55:02,029 --> 01:55:06,989
When it comes to quaalude, the
lemon 714 was the holygrail.

2096
01:55:07,001 --> 01:55:08,798
- Can you believe it?
- Oh my God..

2097
01:55:08,836 --> 01:55:09,803
I thought they were like a myth.

2098
01:55:09,837 --> 01:55:12,738
Three times as powerful as
anything available today.

2099
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:15,937
- Look at these babies.
- Boy Donnie really knew how to celebrate.

2100
01:55:15,977 --> 01:55:20,846
He said he was saving these for a special
occasion, like a birthday, or being clapfree.

2101
01:55:20,882 --> 01:55:22,850
Or, my money arriving
safely in Switzerland.

2102
01:55:22,884 --> 01:55:23,976
We're gonna die!

2103
01:55:24,018 --> 01:55:26,987
[PUKE]

2104
01:55:27,021 --> 01:55:29,785
So that night, I cleared my schedule,

2105
01:55:29,791 --> 01:55:33,818
and I rid my body of anything
that could fuck with my high.

2106
01:55:33,861 --> 01:55:35,920
It was celebration time.

2107
01:55:35,963 --> 01:55:37,726
Okay.

2108
01:55:37,765 --> 01:55:38,891
We start off with one, see how it'll go?

2109
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:40,868
My guy says all we need is one.

2110
01:55:40,868 --> 01:55:41,800
Here we go.

2111
01:55:42,937 --> 01:55:44,802
- Salute.
- Cheers.

2112
01:55:44,839 --> 01:55:47,774
Maybe if I pull it
again, it will go down.

2113
01:55:49,010 --> 01:55:51,706
Steve, Steve! I gotta get outta here.

2114
01:55:51,746 --> 01:55:53,805
No! I think I got it figured out.

2115
01:55:53,848 --> 01:55:57,784
It must be one pull for
up, and two pull for down.

2116
01:55:57,819 --> 01:55:58,843
Okay.

2117
01:56:06,994 --> 01:56:08,791
You feel anything?

2118
01:56:11,866 --> 01:56:13,731
No.

2119
01:56:15,803 --> 01:56:17,737
Been thirty five minutes.

2120
01:56:19,941 --> 01:56:23,741
Maybe we built up a tolerance
after all these years, huh?

2121
01:56:25,046 --> 01:56:26,809
Hm..

2122
01:56:36,824 --> 01:56:37,882
This is bullshit!

2123
01:56:37,925 --> 01:56:40,985
My metabolism is pumped
out, I can't feel shit!

2124
01:56:41,028 --> 01:56:43,861
They're old, I think
they lost the potency?

2125
01:56:43,865 --> 01:56:44,832
Huh?

2126
01:56:44,899 --> 01:56:45,923
Check the bottle!

2127

2128
01:56:50,905 --> 01:56:51,929
They're fuckin' duds.

2129
01:56:51,939 --> 01:56:53,964
- Fuck!
- Let's take a..

2130
01:56:54,008 --> 01:56:55,976
- Take two more each.
- Yeah.

2131
01:56:57,879 --> 01:56:59,779
Jordan!

2132
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:00,838
You're up, babe?

2133
01:57:03,918 --> 01:57:05,783
What are you two retards doing?

2134
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:06,878
We're workin' out, honey.

2135
01:57:07,822 --> 01:57:09,722
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2136
01:57:09,757 --> 01:57:11,884
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

2137
01:57:13,828 --> 01:57:14,817
Hey! Bo, what's going on?

2138
01:57:14,862 --> 01:57:16,727
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2139
01:57:16,764 --> 01:57:18,891
I can not talk to you in this
phone, and I have to talk with you.

2140
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:20,731
We're gonna get outta
here. What's going on?

2141
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:23,896
Listen to me, leave the
fuckin' house, Jordan!

2142
01:57:23,938 --> 01:57:27,806
And then call me from a payphone.
This is not a fuckin' joke, Jordan.

2143
01:57:27,842 --> 01:57:28,934
Yeah, yeah. Ya.

2144
01:57:29,944 --> 01:57:31,809
- Shit!
- What's.. What he said?

2145
01:57:31,846 --> 01:57:33,746
I don't know what the fuck
is going on, I gotta go!

2146
01:57:33,781 --> 01:57:34,839
Is everything okay, Jordan?

2147
01:57:44,992 --> 01:57:49,895
The closest payphone I can get to
is at the Brookvile Contry Club.

2148
01:57:49,931 --> 01:57:51,899
It was a real WASP stronghold.

2149
01:57:51,933 --> 01:57:54,731
Just a mile down the road from my house.

2150
01:58:04,745 --> 01:58:06,872
Hey Bo, what's up? It's me, what's going
on? I'm at the payphone, what's going on?

2151
01:58:06,881 --> 01:58:07,848
Listen to me carefully.

2152
01:58:07,915 --> 01:58:10,816
Please, your little friend
here, Brad, your little buddy,

2153
01:58:10,818 --> 01:58:11,876
he's in jail.

2154
01:58:11,919 --> 01:58:13,978
He.. What the fuck he's in
jail for? What did he do?

2155
01:58:13,988 --> 01:58:14,977
I don't know what he did.

2156
01:58:15,022 --> 01:58:18,924
My friend in Long Island told me he got
picked up in some fuckin' shopping mall,

2157
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:21,986
- he got locked up..
- Wait, did you say a shopping mall?

2158
01:58:22,730 --> 01:58:23,822
- Yeah, yeah.
- He, he was with Donnie

2159
01:58:23,864 --> 01:58:26,833
he was supposed to deliver some money,
and that fuckin' fat piece of shit.

2160
01:58:26,867 --> 01:58:28,767
- I'm gonna go and fuckin' kill him.
- Jordan, Jordan, Jordan. Listen to me!

2161
01:58:28,769 --> 01:58:29,895
Don't go! Listen to me.

2162
01:58:29,937 --> 01:58:32,804
That guy, Denham, that FBI agent guy,

2163
01:58:32,807 --> 01:58:36,766
somebody told me, he's got your phone
tapped. Your ofice and your home.

2164
01:58:36,811 --> 01:58:39,871
- Don't talk on that motherfuckin' phone!
- Okay. Fuck! I got it, I got it.

2165
01:58:39,947 --> 01:58:40,914
I got it, I got it.

2166
01:58:40,915 --> 01:58:42,780
Jordan.

2167
01:58:42,817 --> 01:58:45,980
You didn't try to bribe this
fuckin' FBI agent, did you?

2168
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:48,784
No, I didn't try to
bribe that FBI agent.

2169
01:58:48,789 --> 01:58:49,915
You think I'm that fuckin'stupid? No!

2170
01:58:49,957 --> 01:58:51,925
What the fuck you said?
I can't understand.

2171
01:58:51,959 --> 01:58:52,983
Say that again!

2172
01:58:52,994 --> 01:58:56,794
I said I won't, I know what
my feeling with this FBI agent.

2173
01:58:56,831 --> 01:58:57,991
What the fuck are you saying?

2174
01:58:59,867 --> 01:59:01,858
- I said..
- Are you fuckin' high?

2175
01:59:01,869 --> 01:59:04,736
Are you kidding me? I
don't wanna see more FBI!

2176
01:59:04,772 --> 01:59:06,933
Jordan! Are you fuckin' high?

2177
01:59:07,875 --> 01:59:09,934
Jordan, do me a favour.
Stay where you are,

2178
01:59:09,977 --> 01:59:11,842
don't get behind the wheel of the car,

2179
01:59:11,846 --> 01:59:13,006
I'll be there in a
moment to pick you up.

2180
01:59:13,748 --> 01:59:14,009
Jordan, Jordan!

2181
01:59:14,749 --> 01:59:16,876
After 15 years in storage,

2182
01:59:16,884 --> 01:59:20,718
the lemons had developed a delayed fuse.

2183
01:59:20,788 --> 01:59:24,019
It took 90 minutes for this little
fuckers to kick in, but once they did..

2184
01:59:24,759 --> 01:59:25,851
Pow!

2185
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:28,988
I mean, I'd skipped the tingle phase
and went straight to the drool phase.

2186
01:59:29,030 --> 01:59:30,895
Tell me where you are, don't fuckin'..

2187
01:59:30,898 --> 01:59:35,767
This little bastard was so strong,
I discovered a whole new phase.

2188
01:59:35,803 --> 01:59:37,964
The cerebral palsy phase.

2189
01:59:39,907 --> 01:59:41,875
Come on, stand up.

2190
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:47,939
Oke, walking's out.

2191
01:59:48,916 --> 01:59:51,749

01:59:52,787 --> 01:59:53,754

I got it!

2199
02:00:42,937 --> 02:00:43,926
I've got it!

2200
02:00:44,004 --> 02:00:45,767

Oh Jesus. Where are you?

02:02:14,929 --> 02:02:16,829
I'm at the Country Club.

saying, but you need to get home!

02:02:23,737 --> 02:02:24,897
Donnie is out of control.

2215
02:02:24,939 --> 02:02:27,772
He's on the other line
with some Swiss guy,

2216
02:02:27,808 --> 02:02:28,934
- I don't know..
- What?!

2783
02:35:02,961 --> 02:35:12,859
Grenada very interesting because it is a small
island nation that was invaded by the United
States of America 1983 have 9000 people.

2784
02:35:12,905 --> 02:35:15,874
And essentially means is.

2785
02:35:15,874 --> 02:35:18,900
This case is unloseable.

2786
02:35:18,944 --> 02:35:23,881
So, you know, come in we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants, nobody gives a fuck.

2787
02:35:23,916 --> 02:35:25,816
I'm gonna win.

2788
02:35:25,851 --> 02:35:27,819
You Sir.

2789
02:35:28,754 --> 02:35:30,722
Are was known.

2790
02:35:30,956 --> 02:35:32,947
As a Grenada.

2791
02:35:35,828 --> 02:35:38,922
You're looking at real prison time.

2792
02:35:38,964 --> 02:35:42,730
Money laundering can get you as much 20 years.

2793
02:35:42,768 --> 02:35:46,898
And, our case gonna be stronger, if we
caught your shed and cash your mattress,.

2794
02:35:46,939 --> 02:35:48,770
Oh that right.

2795
02:35:48,874 --> 02:35:50,774
Hei Jordan.

2796
02:35:50,809 --> 02:35:55,906
Jordan, You're rotting away in
jail, 2 your kids get out the college.

2797
02:35:55,914 --> 02:35:58,781
That's not our ambition here.

2798
02:35:58,951 --> 02:36:01,749
There's other people involve in this too.

2799
02:36:01,820 --> 02:36:04,983
We think, they need to see
their day in courts as well.

2800
02:36:07,025 --> 02:36:09,721
Why do I sense there's
an offer in the air?

2801
02:36:09,761 --> 02:36:10,887
He's got good sense.

2802
02:36:10,929 --> 02:36:12,863
What are you, Craskin?

2803
02:36:13,031 --> 02:36:21,803
Full cooperation, he provides us with the
comprehensive list of all coconspirators spanning
the last seven years and he agrees to wear a wire.

2804
02:36:22,007 --> 02:36:24,908
- Did you just say wear a wire?
- A wire.

2805
02:36:25,010 --> 02:36:27,877
Wow, wow, is that means, you
want me to rat, is that it?

2806
02:36:27,913 --> 02:36:29,744
No, i want you to cooperate.

2807
02:36:29,781 --> 02:36:31,874
- No, you want me to rat.
- Yes, we want you to rat.

2808
02:36:31,917 --> 02:36:35,978
That fucking exactly what
we want you to do, to rat.

2809
02:36:39,925 --> 02:36:41,722
How is Christy's party?

2810
02:36:41,860 --> 02:36:44,829
- Fine.
- Good.

2811
02:36:45,764 --> 02:36:47,857
Babe, i've spoke to the lawyers again today.

2812
02:36:47,933 --> 02:36:51,869
There is some really really great news.

2813
02:36:52,738 --> 02:36:55,935
Turns out you completely
off the hook, honey.

2814
02:36:55,974 --> 02:36:57,839
I know that already.

2815
02:36:57,876 --> 02:37:03,007
Right, exactly, you never did
anything wrong in first place right?

2816
02:37:03,782 --> 02:37:09,948
It turns out, all the FBI really
wants for me is to a coorperate.

2817
02:37:09,988 --> 02:37:14,789
You know.. turns out i have so much information
about the stock market and the Wallstreet..

2818
02:37:14,826 --> 02:37:19,991
That i could save the government years of
heartache not to mention countless dollars.

2819
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:23,734
It gets even better babe.

2820
02:37:23,769 --> 02:37:29,708
Because if i do to sign cooperate, i might
only be looking at 4 short years.

2821
02:37:29,775 --> 02:37:33,905
How much case, we could start
fresh maybe sell the house.

2822
02:37:33,912 --> 02:37:37,780
And any fine that i have to pay
wouldn't due till i serve term.

2823
02:37:37,816 --> 02:37:41,775
So, we still have plenty
money left over, you know.

2824
02:37:42,788 --> 02:37:47,885
You think, of course bug me out a little
bit is this whole idea for doing it.

2825
02:37:47,926 --> 02:37:49,894
Give an information about my friends.

2826
02:37:49,995 --> 02:37:53,761
Ohh, like he said, ther is
no friend on Wallstrett right.

2827
02:37:53,765 --> 02:37:54,857
Right.

2828
02:37:54,933 --> 02:37:58,926
It's exactly silver lining to that
too honey because they said eventually.

2829
02:37:58,971 --> 02:38:01,838
Eventually everyone gonna have to
give an information on this case.

2830
02:38:01,873 --> 02:38:04,899
So at the end of the day, might
not even a factor, you know.

2831
02:38:04,910 --> 02:38:08,903
- Well, that's a good news, right.
- Yeah, yeah.

2832
02:38:08,947 --> 02:38:11,006
