1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:03,822
The foreigners are bringing over
them scary-ass foreign bugs, man.

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:08,296
They coming here in their luggage.
It's my job to prevent possible infestation...

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,833
- ...and contamination. That's my job.
- We doing business inside.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,905
I can't let you come and hose
the place with bug spray.

5
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:19,237
Hey man. Maybe you need to talk to your manager
about that plan because that's my job.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,777
- Manager's busy.
- Okay, that's your call.

7
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:24,574
That is your call, player.

8
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,475
But just remember this.

9
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,882
First thing tomorrow morning...

10
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:31,385
...the city...

11
00:00:32,056 --> 00:00:35,787
- ...they gonna send their quarantine people.
- Quarantine people?

12
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:38,054
They gonna shut you down.
Non-compliance.

13
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:40,528
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

14
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:43,599
Hold, man, come here.
Let me talk to you for a minute.

15
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:49,603
You ain't fucking with me, are you?

16
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:54,270
See that little motherfucker up there?

17
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:56,140
That's me. That's me.

18
00:00:56,948 --> 00:01:01,612
I am a licensed exterminator, man.
Why I gotta fuck with you?

19
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:05,589
Look. Come here. Let's do this.

20
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:09,158
You take me to a small place.
Small room. Office or something.

21
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:11,659
You knyow. Someplace upstairs,
away from the customers.

22
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:16,232
That way when I set these bombs off,
the fumes, they don't go down there.

23
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:19,859
And then we come back later
and fix the rest. All right?

24
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:24,265
- Okay. Get a couple bombs. Come on.
- That's what I'm talking about.

25
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:27,343
You don't wanna be bit by one
of these motherfuckers.

26
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:31,949
Swell you up all around the neck.
Look like Oprah. Come on, get the door.

27
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:22,216
You know, some of these bugs
they got E. Coli and Mad Cow disease.

28
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:26,625
Check this shit out.
Is this Jackie Chan's office?

29
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,498
Oh, snap!

30
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:32,068
Man, you got a Jacuzzi?

31
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:34,728
Look at the ball.
How many freaks you get in here?

32
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:38,467
I bet you sit yours right there on
that ball. Sit on the ball, baby.

33
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:41,703
Sit on the ball. Keep it wet, baby.

34
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,404
- Smack! Smack it! Smack it!
- Hey! Hey!

35
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:48,518
- Just do your thing and go, bro.
- Yeah, all right, player.

36
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:56,591
All right. Look here.
Now you keep the door closed...

37
00:03:56,761 --> 00:04:01,130
...and give this shit a full hour
before anybody steps in here, all right?

38
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,561
Damn.

39
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:07,095
Damn.

40
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,267
- You're clear.
- Let's do it.

41
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,137
All right.

42
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:28,491
- You're crazy.
- I'm a father.

43
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:07,189
- Blow it.
- Daria...

44
00:05:07,365 --> 00:05:08,798
...get ready to move.

45
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,568
What was that?

46
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:19,738
"Sometimes you just need
an old friend?"

47
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:28,912
- It came from the office.
- Watch her. Don't let her leave.

48
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:40,257
- They're not here?
- They're here.

49
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:43,424
- They're just somewhere else.
- What are you talking about?

50
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:46,934
- He stashed them here somewhere.
- What the hell we gonna do?

51
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:49,766
- Everybody just go.
- But, T, what about you, man?

52
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,205
I gotta save Vanessa. I gotta find them!

53
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:55,641
- I'm not leaving you.
- Yes, you are. Now go!

54
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,874
- Right here. Hurry up. Come on.
- Oh, shit.

55
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:01,041
Yo, T. Come on, dog. Let's get the hell out of here.
They're right outside.

56
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:03,743
Shut the fuck up and get out of here!

57
00:06:11,696 --> 00:06:13,823
You know, I got the big one.

58
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:16,659
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,298
Keep it in your pants.

60
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:26,174
Who's in there?

61
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:42,688
You're wrong.

62
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,389
What you want?

63
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:53,262
- Yeah!
- Move away from him. Come on.

64
00:06:56,907 --> 00:07:02,971
Nice cubic. Yours are real. Not.
I told you this was gonna take a while.

65
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:06,241
I was thinking about those diamonds
so I made a few calls.

66
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,842
My Defense Department connection
called me back and he tells me...

67
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:15,892
...about this rumor out of Taiwan about these
black stones. Only they're not jewels.

68
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,899
- Pretty beat up.
- Fell down the stairs.

69
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,399
Enjoy the jail sex, Fait.

70
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:36,474
Seven advances, 11's out!
Next up, 8 versus 12!

71
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:38,645
Eight versus 12!

72
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,813
Fighters report to the cage!

73
00:07:43,454 --> 00:07:44,716
Let's go.

74
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:53,558
We're still here, T.

75
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:55,995
Got anything you want us to do?

76
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:59,125
- Nothing yet.
- What?

77
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:01,430
Nothing. Nothing.

78
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,618
Unofficial entry number 12!

79
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:22,623
- Unofficial entry number 12!
- Hey, 12's right here!

80
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,728
Kind of small, ain't he?

81
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:28,695
Let's go, chickenshit.

82
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:30,933
You're the chickenshit, buddy!

83
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:33,097
Not today.

84
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:36,903
I know this wasn't the plan,
but if you don't get in and fight...

85
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:39,872
...they'll throw us out
and we'll never find this guy.

86
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:42,876
- Sorry.
- Just find the ring.

87
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:56,150
- Hey. Two grand on the white guy.
- You got it, Archie.

88
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,056
Let's go! Come on!

89
00:08:58,262 --> 00:08:59,923
Are you ready? Are you ready?

90
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,455
You win.

91
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:34,087
- You suck.
- Shit.

92
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,499
No quitting! Get your ass back in there!

93
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:50,472
Put me down! Goddamn! Come on!

94
00:09:55,319 --> 00:10:00,450
- Put me down or I'll kick your ass, Bruce!
- I'm not Bruce.

95
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:15,230
Come on. Get up. Get out of here.
Get out of here.

96
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,802
Kick his ass!

97
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:19,670
Come on! Kick his ass!

98
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:23,575
Kick him. Take him down.

99
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,549
- Okay. He's all patched up.
- Ready to move.

100
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:34,654
Let's go.

101
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,000
Get the car. Stay close.

102
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,438
Hey! That guy's got my fucking quad!

103
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:01,245
I'm gonna get that motherfucker!

104
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,829
Hey! Wait!

105
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,924
Five grand on the Chinaman.
He's my friend.

106
00:11:56,307 --> 00:12:00,266
At this very moment, a man
identified as Anthony Fait is leading...

107
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:03,902
...police on a wild high-speed chase
through downtown Los Angeles.

108
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:07,573
And get this, folks.
He's driving an all-terrain vehicle.

109
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:52,193
Yeah!

110
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:14,746
Come on! Kick his ass!

111
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,175
Oh, yeah!

112
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:23,802
Come on. Come on down.

113
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:33,684
That's the way to get that buck.

114
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:08,056
- Yo.
- I'm here.

115
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:10,921
Aboveground parking garage
in Chinatown. Get there.

116
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:12,855
I know the place.

117
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:47,592
Hey. Thanks, man.

118
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,596
- Do you like my new ring?
- Where is he?

119
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,601
Well, open the door.

120
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:00,139
Glad I brought my stunner.

121
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,973
All right, bud. You ready for the q and a?
Where'd you put the stones?

122
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:08,780
I ain't selling you shit till
I know where the ceiling is.

123
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:11,814
How much money
do you want for the stones?

124
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,423
- Where's my fucking butter, chick?
- It's almost ready.

125
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,994
See, I hate foreplay. Fucking warm-up.

126
00:17:21,131 --> 00:17:24,623
A bitch gotta be ready to come off
the bench and score some points.

127
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:29,602
Just take the rock to the motherfucking
hoop strong. You dig?

128
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:36,401
Instead of doing this back-and-forth shit,
my idea is you come up with a number.

129
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,573
A very high number. You see,
I'm throwing a number so high...

130
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:46,321
...that when I hear it just...
It just gets me off.

131
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,325
And then, bam! Bust a nut,
roll over, go to sleep.

132
00:17:51,662 --> 00:17:53,493
You like that?

133
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,930
Yeah, I like that.

134
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:05,173
Oh, shit!

135
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:07,733
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

136
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,109
Shit! Okay, okay, okay!

137
00:18:11,448 --> 00:18:15,475
And it looks like this parking garage is where
it will end. As police have sealed...

138
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:18,712
...the building and continue
their search inside for the man who...

139
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,586
...led them on what certainly had to
be the most extreme chase we've ever seen.

140
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:26,286
- Don't know why these idiots do it, Barbara.
- They never get away, do they?

141
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:29,921
They sure don't, and they just endanger
innocent citizens in the process.

142
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,830
Here's another car exiting the structure.

143
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:36,234
Police talking to the driver,
inspecting the vehicle.

144
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,933
Well, the police know they have him
trapped inside the parking structure.

145
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,978
Knowing cops the way I do, I can tell you
they're good and PO'd, excuse my language.

146
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:47,344
And they're not about to let this guy
slip through their fingers.

147
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:54,347
Mr. Chambers is resting.
He says not to bother him.

148
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,596
Hey, baby.

149
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:13,141
Please don't go.

150
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,301
You want me to stay?

151
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:18,175
Yeah, I need someone to stay here
and help keep me awake.

152
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:19,575
Wait a minute.

153
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,650
I know that face.

154
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:26,084
A lot of men had that look on their face
when I got married.

155
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,462
I knew the stones were in there.

156
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:43,368
He was a tough guy at first, but when I got
close to his nuts he sang like Céline Dion.

157
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:46,902
Question is, how we gonna
get them out of there?

158
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:48,840
That place is always jumping.

159
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,671
Yo, dog, something's not right.

160
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,041
I got the same feeling.

161
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:53,682
The doorman.

162
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:55,406
Where is he?

163
00:19:57,621 --> 00:19:59,452
Everybody stay put.

164
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:05,895
- Sorry.
- Watch my nuts, all right?

165
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:24,207
No Chambers' guys.

166
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:26,008
Something's wrong.

167
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:46,702
This guy looks better dead.

168
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:49,835
He said they were here in the fountain.

169
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:53,267
Where are they?

170
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:58,781
This can't be fucking happening.
They have to be here!

171
00:21:08,124 --> 00:21:10,684
That's it? One stone?

172
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:14,293
- Ling. He has the rest.
- How the fuck do you know?

173
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:16,389
I know.

174
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:25,171
Okay. He has the stones.

175
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:29,010
I mean, she can't hurt him.
She's just a little girl.

176
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:34,479
She's only 8 years old. He'll let her
go, right? He'll just fucking let her go!

177
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,158
What am I gonna do?

178
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:46,119
We have to go.

179
00:21:54,504 --> 00:21:56,233
Now.

180
00:21:58,842 --> 00:22:01,310
- We're back in business.
- Good.

181
00:22:01,478 --> 00:22:04,811
- We don't have to babysit much longer.
- I hate kids.

182
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:08,644
- Is everything else ready?
- Just have to test the device.

183
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:11,217
It's called the Dimaster Oscillator.

184
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:16,883
Not test. Calibrate.
Which I'm now ready to do.

185
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,719
Goggles?

186
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:45,945
Here you go, man.

187
00:22:46,556 --> 00:22:47,716
Thanks.

188
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:23,389
Please work. Please work.

189
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:25,558
Please work.

190
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:38,668
Daddy, please. Daddy, please.

191
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:44,203
Please answer, Daddy, answer.

192
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,246
Want me to get that?

193
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:52,412
- Yeah?
- Daddy?

194
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:53,845
Vanessa?

195
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,087
Daddy, please, come and get me...

196
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:57,692
...I wanna go home!

197
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,087
Calm down, baby. Calm down.
Where are you?

198
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:02,353
I don't know!

199
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:04,932
I'm in a van inside a big building.

200
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:07,228
They painted the windows.
I can't look out!

201
00:24:07,537 --> 00:24:10,529
You gotta help me, sweetheart.
I have to know where you are.

202
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:13,005
- I'm scared!
- I know you are, honey.

203
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:16,873
Just try to stay calm. Concentrate.
Look around. What do you see?

204
00:24:17,313 --> 00:24:19,941
I don't know. I can't see anything.

205
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:23,051
You gotta try, sweetheart.
Try to see something.

206
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:26,686
I'm going. I'm trying.

207
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:35,828
I see chairs and green light.

208
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:37,967
Chairs. Green light.

209
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:39,835
Where's the light coming from?

210
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:43,563
I can't tell. There's a machine.
It's like a laser show.

211
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:45,932
- Laser show?
- Daddy...

212
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,406
...hurry! I'm scared!

213
00:24:47,577 --> 00:24:49,772
- I wanna go home!
- Okay, calm down baby. Calm down.

214
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:50,935
It's gonna be all right, sweetheart.

215
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,376
Daddy's coming!

216
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,108
Daddy?

217
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:59,014
- Vanessa?
- Daddy!

218
00:24:59,189 --> 00:25:00,486
Vanessa?

219
00:25:02,158 --> 00:25:03,147
Vanessa!

220
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,556
Great!

221
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:07,091
Shit!

222
00:25:07,263 --> 00:25:10,824
- He's doing it here tonight.
- Doing what?

223
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,960
Selling the stones. The Thai laser
emits green light. He needs it to enrich them.

224
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,199
- To show their power.
- What the hell are you talking about?

225
00:25:19,342 --> 00:25:20,707
What are these stones?

226
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:25,438
A new form of synthetic plutonium.
Small and portable, but mega-powerful. Am I right?

227
00:25:25,748 --> 00:25:29,240
There's a bunch of international
scumbags who'd pay a lot of money...

228
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:32,354
...to get their hands on those.
And then, look out world.

229
00:25:32,522 --> 00:25:33,546
Enough of this shit!

230
00:25:33,857 --> 00:25:36,655
How's it gonna get me
back my daughter?

231
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,023
We're operational.

232
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:49,894
The buyers will want to arrive
and leave quickly.

233
00:25:50,073 --> 00:25:54,169
Somewhere private,
accessible by aircraft.

234
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,744
Vanessa did say she was inside
of a big building.

235
00:25:56,913 --> 00:25:57,902
Could be a hangar.

236
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:00,912
There's about a dozen
little airports around here, man.

237
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:03,344
We ain't gonna never get them all.

238
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,647
- Flight plans.
- Yeah, flight plans.

239
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:09,280
They gotta list a destination.
Every aircraft that takes off...

240
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:13,657
...has to file one with the Aviation
Administration or risk getting shot down...

241
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:16,287
...by the U.S. Military.
So you get that list...

242
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:19,162
...and maybe we can find out where
the sale's going down.

243
00:26:19,302 --> 00:26:23,170
Daria, call the aviation people.
Use our L.A.P.D. Credentials.

244
00:26:23,306 --> 00:26:26,434
We need flight info on all aircrafts
coming in or going out.

245
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:30,137
Miles, the no-gun policy
is no longer in effect. Break out the heat.

246
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,512
Everybody else, get ready to move.
Tommy, create a diversion.

247
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:36,675
I got just the thing if we can fit in it.

248
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:56,131
Wick Airfield. Five private choppers arriving
tonight within minutes of each other.

249
00:26:56,306 --> 00:26:59,833
- Sounds like our best bet.
- Better be for Vanessa's sake.

250
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,000
Let's go.

251
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:08,643
You are the world's foremost
arms dealers.

252
00:27:08,818 --> 00:27:13,312
You all know that weaponry equals power,
and in the world of weaponry...

253
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:14,649
...nukes rule.

254
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:19,226
But nuclear material is hard to obtain
and difficult to handle.

255
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:22,024
But what if it weren't?

256
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:24,892
That's the question that brought
you here tonight.

257
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,039
And this is the answer.

258
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:34,940
A unique, man-made element.
In its present state it's completely inert.

259
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:37,374
Zero radiation...

260
00:27:40,783 --> 00:27:42,614
...zero volatility.

261
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:46,448
One small fragment easily transformed
into a source of immense energy.

262
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:52,892
More powerful than weapons-grade
plutonium 100 times its size.

263
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,401
Goggles on.

264
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,871
So, what the hell does Taiwan
gotta do with this?

265
00:28:11,014 --> 00:28:13,744
We developed the stones.
They belong to us.

266
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:17,545
Okay, what about the guy you're after?
How come you know him so well?

267
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,883
We grew up together.
We joined the government at the same time.

268
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:23,959
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You were on the same side?

269
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:28,154
He betrayed us. He killed our team.
He tried to kill me too.

270
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,266
If you don't take this
motherfucker out, I will.

271
00:28:31,434 --> 00:28:34,767
The stones first, then him.

272
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:47,639
Creating a highly reactive
radioactive isotope...

273
00:28:47,817 --> 00:28:51,218
...requires altering the atomic structure
of the original material.

274
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,588
Normally this is accomplished
by adding neutrons.

275
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,094
Here, we're using electromagnetic distillation
to strip away protons.

276
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:07,760
In the process, the fragment's potential yield
is increasing exponentially.

277
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:16,968
We're now reaching the yield level
of a sidewinder missile.

278
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,910
Enough power to take out a tank.

279
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:31,392
A Tomahawk cruise missile,
enough to destroy a building.

280
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:37,755
Scud.

281
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:40,895
That's a few city blocks gone.

282
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,468
Hiroshima.

283
00:29:52,448 --> 00:29:54,507
Two Hiroshimas.

284
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:10,965
New world order.

285
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,376
The purpose of today's sale
is to begin trading...

286
00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:32,920
...a new commodity on the black market
and to determine its value.

287
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,951
There are 50 stones available
in the first sale.

288
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,754
And the opening bid
is $200,000 per stone.

289
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:43,331
Bids, please.

290
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:45,763
I'll bid one million for five stones.

291
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:50,329
- I'll bid 1.2 million for five stones.
- 1.5 for five stones.

292
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:52,997
- 1.7 million for five stones.
- 2 million for three.

293
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,337
- 5 million for six stones!
- 5.2 for six!

294
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:57,445
- 5.7 for six!
- Sold.

295
00:30:57,613 --> 00:31:00,241
- Seven million for 10 stones!
- 8.5 for 10!

296
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:04,380
Miles, what do you see?

297
00:31:05,922 --> 00:31:07,651
We got five choppers.

298
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:11,352
Two armed sentries.

299
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:13,725
Checking the perimeter.

300
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:17,330
Perimeter is clear.

301
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:21,495
I'm moving inside.
They're still doing the deal.

302
00:31:25,374 --> 00:31:26,636
There's a camper there.

303
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,304
- And the windows is painted out.
- Vanessa said she was in a van.

304
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,606
Can't see out. It's gotta be it!

305
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:34,841
Once we get her,
you two disappear fast.

306
00:31:34,984 --> 00:31:35,973
I'll keep her safe.

307
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:39,518
- 8.7 million for 10 stones!
- 9 million for 10 stones!

308
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,748
- 9.8 for 10.
- 10 million for 10 stones!

309
00:31:41,924 --> 00:31:44,188
- Sold! There are 37 stones.
- 16 million!

310
00:31:44,994 --> 00:31:46,427
Miles! Hit them!

311
00:31:50,032 --> 00:31:53,661
- Done.
- Tommy and Archie, watch the van. Punch it!

312
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:58,129
- 24.5 for 15!
- 24 and three quarters...

313
00:31:58,307 --> 00:31:59,604
Twenty-five for 15!

314
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:08,380
Freeze, motherfuckers!

315
00:32:10,486 --> 00:32:11,475
I knew it.

316
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:20,621
You heard the man. Party's over!

317
00:32:20,796 --> 00:32:22,764
- I knew it.
- Just be cool.

318
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:24,927
Fucking amateurs.

319
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:28,899
Come on, man, just be cool!

320
00:32:30,106 --> 00:32:32,006
I said, don't move, motherfucker!

321
00:32:42,451 --> 00:32:44,510
She's out! She's out!
She's on the move.

322
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:48,089
Another time.

323
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:00,730
- There's a guy after her.
- Stay right here. I'll go get her.

324
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:04,935
- Holy shit!
- Come to Papa!

325
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,839
Shit! That motherfucker's shooting!

326
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,646
- What do we do?
- Shoot him!

327
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,276
Easy for you to say!

328
00:33:41,143 --> 00:33:42,132
You do him.

329
00:34:06,402 --> 00:34:07,835
Don't let him get away!

330
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,438
Oh, shit! Shit! Archie, I'm out of ammo!

331
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:12,972
- Fire the M-60!
- Get me closer!

332
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,699
Give me that!

333
00:34:40,336 --> 00:34:42,736
How many times do we have to kill you?

334
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:54,744
Get him! I got this.

335
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,791
Go! Go!

336
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:11,090
- Go!
- All right!

337
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:45,060
- What happened?
- I don't know!

338
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:46,291
We're out of balance!

339
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,935
Retract the landing gear! Do it!
Do it now!

340
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,314
Shoot him down!

341
00:36:01,484 --> 00:36:03,145
Shit! I'm out of ammo! What now?

342
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:04,411
Shoot him down!

343
00:36:04,587 --> 00:36:06,077
- Load the cannon.
- How?

344
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:09,656
- Put the giant bullet into the hole!
- Oh, shit.

345
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:10,848
Oh, shit!

346
00:36:19,502 --> 00:36:23,029
- There he is! There he is! I got him!
- Archie, shoot this motherfucker!

347
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:28,565
We're hit!

348
00:36:30,613 --> 00:36:33,377
- Hey! Hey!
- You shot him in the ass!

349
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:34,709
We got it!

350
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,677
Shit!

351
00:37:14,957 --> 00:37:17,391
Time to end this my way.

352
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:21,653
- Let her go!
- Let go! Daddy!

353
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,161
Daddy!

354
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:24,354
Daddy!

355
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,601
Damn! No shot.

356
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,307
You were lucky last time.

357
00:37:43,853 --> 00:37:46,083
You won't be lucky again.

358
00:38:23,192 --> 00:38:24,420
Daddy!

359
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:07,760
Come on, baby. Come on.

360
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:34,650
Wrong kid!

361
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:38,885
Definitely the wrong father!

362
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:33,810
- My baby!
- Daddy, I knew you'd find me!

363
00:41:33,982 --> 00:41:35,847
So glad the angels kept you safe.

364
00:41:41,223 --> 00:41:42,520
Another one?

365
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:44,218
You know it.

366
00:41:49,765 --> 00:41:53,565
Never gonna let you go. Ever.

367
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:14,519
Guess we both got what we wanted.

368
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,957
So, what happens to the stones now?

369
00:42:19,261 --> 00:42:21,422
They'll be destroyed.

370
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:27,692
Guess I'll be spending some time in jail.

371
00:42:28,403 --> 00:42:29,392
Jail?

372
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:34,035
Come on, man. He just saved the planet, man.
Can't he at least get probation?

373
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:35,403
I'll do what I can.

374
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:36,771
- Thank you.
- That's great.

375
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:40,108
Because we make a hell of a team,
am I right? Except for you.

376
00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:42,945
'Cause you're law enforcement.
But the rest of these guys we gotta stick together.

377
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:45,280
And a white guy comes in handy.

378
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,254
You wanna rip off a country club,
or somebody needs to hail a cab. Right?

379
00:42:49,391 --> 00:42:51,655
- So, what percentage are we talking?
- None.

380
00:42:51,827 --> 00:42:53,556
That low, huh?

381
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:57,997
It's about time I got my shit together.

382
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,597
- About time we all did.
- I'm with you, T.

383
00:43:02,638 --> 00:43:05,368
Come on, buddy, it's just getting fun.

384
00:43:05,707 --> 00:43:08,540
Well, I mean, you know,
it's not that fun...

385
00:43:12,748 --> 00:43:14,943
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

386
00:43:17,252 --> 00:43:18,344
Faith.

387
00:43:18,587 --> 00:43:19,576
Faith.

388
00:43:20,756 --> 00:43:22,087
Faith.

389
00:43:22,257 --> 00:43:23,690
Faith.

390
00:43:24,092 --> 00:43:25,389
Faith.

391
00:44:30,225 --> 00:44:32,716
So you guys are all just gonna
up and go straight?

392
00:44:32,894 --> 00:44:35,124
Yeah. You ought to try it yourself, man.

393
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,788
I could do it. I've had straight jobs.
Have you?

394
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:40,834
- I've had plenty of straight jobs.
- Really? Name one.

395
00:44:42,004 --> 00:44:43,562
I sold Avon.

396
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,297
- You were an Avon lady?
- I was an Avon man. All right?

397
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,740
- You got a problem with that?
- No, it's fair.

398
00:44:49,911 --> 00:44:53,039
- Why you looking at me like that?
- I'm not! I'm not! It's okay.

399
00:44:54,683 --> 00:44:59,643
I'm just fucking with you. But my mama
sold Avon. And don't be disrespecting her.

400
00:44:59,788 --> 00:45:02,484
- I know her. Remember the party?
- She whipped your ass.

401
00:45:02,624 --> 00:45:04,182
No, she sucker-punched me.

402
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:07,489
That ain't the first time you
been sucker-punched by a big woman.

403
00:45:07,629 --> 00:45:10,189
You know, I think
I got kind of a fetish.

404
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:12,890
Did you just say my mama had a fat ass?

405
00:45:13,068 --> 00:45:16,868
No, I said I have a kind
of a fetish for big women.

406
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:20,236
- Oh. But she do got a fat ass though.
- Yeah, she does have a fat ass.

407
00:45:20,409 --> 00:45:22,934
You can see it when she's sitting
on your fucking head.

408
00:45:23,111 --> 00:45:26,740
I've seen it. I had to rub that ass
naked when I was a teenager.

409
00:45:26,882 --> 00:45:30,147
You know, you look a lot like her.
Except her hair is different.

410
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,016
Yeah. I shave my beard,
she keeps hers growing.

411
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,248
- Yeah. You know what?
- What?

412
00:45:36,425 --> 00:45:41,328
I'm gonna write a movie about all the shit we
got through. I've been taking a few notes.

413
00:45:41,463 --> 00:45:44,557
It's gonna make a lot of money for us.
I'm calling it Sidekicks.

414
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,192
We're the real stars of this.
We shot down the damn helicopter.

415
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,702
- Who's playing you?
- I've been thinking about that.

416
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:54,205
First I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger,
then I saw him one time at the gas station...

417
00:45:54,343 --> 00:45:55,708
- Midget.
- He's like 5'6".

418
00:45:55,877 --> 00:45:57,742
- Midget.
- Got a terrible lisp.

419
00:45:57,913 --> 00:46:00,438
So I'll go with Mel Gibson.
We have similar features.

420
00:46:00,615 --> 00:46:02,344
Right. I see the forehead.

421
00:46:02,517 --> 00:46:04,781
- Yeah. And you? Guess.
- Denzel!

422
00:46:04,953 --> 00:46:06,045
Denzel!

423
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,622
- You noticed I've been cutting it down.
- And he's been beefing up.

424
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:14,524
- I'm trying to get it down to Denzel's weight.
- You know who will be your girlfriend? Oprah.

425
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:16,687
- Big Oprah or little Oprah?
- Medium Oprah.

426
00:46:16,865 --> 00:46:19,060
That's the one I like
because the eyes are straight.

427
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:21,294
- This is about reality.
- Right. Realism.

428
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,665
- Yeah. So you know who's my girlfriend?
- Who?

429
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,673
Halle Berry. And let me tell you why.
It'll add a whole different element.

430
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:31,404
This is gonna be an interracial couple.
She's never done that before.

431
00:46:31,546 --> 00:46:35,642
Also, Fait. I've been thinking about
that a lot. I'll go with Shaquille O'Neal.

432
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:39,116
The most dominating player ever in the NBA.
You saw Kazaam.

433
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:41,448
- Right
- It wasn't the right material.

434
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,321
He's gonna kill with this stuff.
And Su, I've been thinking about him.

435
00:46:45,494 --> 00:46:48,156
- Remember the movie Sixteen Candles?
- Yeah.

436
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,696
- Who am I thinking about?
- Molly Ringwald?

437
00:46:50,866 --> 00:46:52,857
- No, the Donger!
- Oh! Okay!

438
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:55,594
How funny was that guy?
What happened to him?

439
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,103
- He waiting tables someplace.
- He was funny!

440
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:02,334
- Yeah, he was. Hey, Daria.
- Daria? Who you got?

441
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:05,275
- Winona Ryder.
- Yeah, she's good. She'd be good.

442
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,677
- Yeah, she's good.
- She'd play a thief.

443
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:11,080
She'd play a thief. She a good actress.
The whole elbow thing.

444
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:14,711
Remember when she's going to court
and hit the one elbow, broke that elbow.

445
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:18,724
- Electricity went through her body.
- She's a ventriloquist with the elbows.

446
00:47:18,894 --> 00:47:21,124
Now who do we get to direct this thing?

447
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,889
You know what?

448
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:27,397
We should get the same dude that directed
Romeo Must Die and Exit Wounds.

449
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:30,129
- The director, the Pole, Polack.
- The Polack?

450
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,069
Yeah, we'll get him in there.
Exit Wounds, did you see that?

451
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:34,799
- I saw that.
- The best part...

452
00:47:34,976 --> 00:47:36,102
- The end.
- The very end.

453
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:40,374
- Over the credits. The rest of it sucked.
- You can't have the movie without the end.

454
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:43,609
- There's no movie.
- Whatever happened with those two guys?

455
00:47:43,785 --> 00:47:44,979
I heard they're gay.

456
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:48,518
Yeah, of course. Hollywood.
