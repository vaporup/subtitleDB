1
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:31,358
Last delivery's finally here.

2
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:11,333
Watch yourself!

3
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:20,428
X marks the spot.

4
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,508
Christophe here.

5
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:32,045
- What up?
- Delivery confirmed.

6
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:34,376
- We're in position.
- Good luck.

7
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:35,540
We got one shot of this.

8
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:39,451
If anybody fucked up and those stones
aren't there, it ain't my problem.

9
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:42,888
- The stones are there.
- Not for long. Later.

10
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:19,360
I got you.

11
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:22,653
Thank you.

12
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,651
- I'm here for the reception.
- Name, please?

13
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:47,153
Angie Rawlins.

14
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:36,698
You can go on up.
Front elevator to the mezzanine.

15
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,570
Thanks.

16
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,401
Where are the stones?

17
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,143
Who the fuck are you?

18
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:26,921
Who's getting them for you?

19
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:28,983
Fuck off!

20
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:35,226
I want a name and a number.

21
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,061
Okay.

22
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:40,099
- Okay, I'll tell you.
- I know.

23
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,605
I hate these things.
Don't you hate these things?

24
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:46,201
Just doing my job.

25
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:49,735
Then again, you never know
who you're gonna meet, right?

26
00:06:54,183 --> 00:06:58,051
I bet you're a lot more fun
than any of those boring people upstairs.

27
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:01,121
Really, ma'am, I have a job to do.

28
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:09,358
Right, well, I suppose I should
go see what they're selling.

29
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,697
Tommy.

30
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:18,531
Change of plans, he's gay. You're up.

31
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,642
- No way.
- Yes, way.

32
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,834
Come on, man!

33
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,707
- All right, Tommy, your turn.
- Hell, no!

34
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:28,339
This is not a conversation.
Do it! And make it good.

35
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:29,985
Shit.

36
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:31,444
Keycard.

37
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:34,954
So why don't you hold onto my purse.
I shouldn't be too long.

38
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:46,895
Aloha.

39
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:48,326
Hi.

40
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:52,902
I hope you don't take
offense to this but...

41
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:55,904
...I have such a weakness
for a man in uniform.

42
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:59,682
- That's ok.
- Uniforms are my thing.

43
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:05,253
I mean, every time I see a sailor,
all I can think about is seafood.

44
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:07,912
I'm not actually supposed
to be talking on duty.

45
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:09,388
Who's talking?

46
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:11,519
Baby, this is flirting.

47
00:08:14,097 --> 00:08:18,727
Unless you're one of those big handsome
men letting it all go to waste on a woman.

48
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:20,926
The world is full of fools.

49
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:24,397
Yahtzee!

50
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,935
- What's it looking like?
- About a six-second rotation.

51
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,610
Tommy.

52
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:39,951
But you can call me Rachel.

53
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,722
Douglas.

54
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,155
I just hope I'm not too...

55
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:50,356
...pretty for you.

56
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:53,299
- I'm hooked up.
- That bitch.

57
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:02,411
I like sunsets, puppy dogs...

58
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,211
I'm big in the pants.

59
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:08,377
I can almost tie it in a knot.

60
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,878
Let's get the table.

61
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,855
I guess, one day I'll have to come in here and
do a little shoplifting and let you catch me.

62
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,262
Resist arrest just so you can
wrestle me down and...

63
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:27,426
...cuff me.

64
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:30,239
I can be pretty rough.

65
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:33,601
Don't get me excited now.

66
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,159
Faith.

67
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:33,526
Faith.

68
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:34,927
Faith.

69
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:44,369
Holy shit!

70
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:46,980
Earthquake.

71
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:51,475
But I bet you can hit a 10
on the Richter scale anytime, Douglas.

72
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:05,299
Let's do it.

73
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:16,769
All right. Y'all know what to do.
Let's get it on.

74
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:47,433
- 911, what's your emergency?
- I want to report a robbery in progress.

75
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,805
Robbery in progress. What's the location?

76
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:15,800
Man, I love colored stones.

77
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:20,073
This one blue diamond
is at least $2.5 million dollars.

78
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:22,302
Oh, yeah? So whose stuff we stealing?

79
00:12:22,478 --> 00:12:25,072
- Drug dealers, money launderers...
- Works for me.

80
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:27,646
This...

81
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:30,680
This I can use.

82
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:36,752
T.

83
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:38,826
Check this out.

84
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:42,424
This is what we came for.

85
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:45,196
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

86
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:47,495
Jackpot. The rest is ours.

87
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:52,598
Yeah.

88
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:56,267
Your employer betrayed you.
The police are on the way.

89
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:58,675
- Leave the stones.
- Who is this?

90
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:01,676
You know the ones I mean.

91
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:03,876
I'm not gonna be able to do that.

92
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:06,679
Wrap them up.

93
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:23,461
Let's go, boys.

94
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:26,232
Better go move my car.

95
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:28,001
Five-O at the door, gotta go.

96
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:31,205
- Move now!
- Time to bounce. Leave this shit.

97
00:13:34,617 --> 00:13:36,585
- Is this your car?
- Yeah, it's my car, man!

98
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:38,720
- Get it out of here!
- Move your shit...

99
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:41,152
- I'll move that, you move this.
- All right.

100
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:43,748
Let's go. Out of here, right now.

101
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:03,206
They stopped the trains.

102
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:06,041
We don't have a lot of time.
Daria comes with me.

103
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:09,480
I can't tell you how to get there,
but you know where to be.

104
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,779
- Faith.
- Faith.

105
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,708
It's clear.

106
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:00,230
Hold it.

107
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:13,881
All clear.

108
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:17,541
Okay.

109
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:44,302
Nice.

110
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:49,484
- Train is secure.
- Ok, get this train out of here.

111
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:50,744
You got it.

112
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:09,402
The stones?

113
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:24,243
Watch out!

114
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:27,345
The bag!

115
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:54,333
Fuck.

116
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:39,082
Enjoying California?

117
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:42,417
Hope we're not here long.
I hate sunshine.

118
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:46,990
We may have a problem.

119
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:49,457
The stones?

120
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,990
The Exchange was just robbed.

121
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:54,999
Let's hope that was part of the plan.

122
00:19:27,202 --> 00:19:28,533
Who's in charge?

123
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:30,330
Who wants to know?

124
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,370
Follow me.

125
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:49,547
Vanessa. What are you still doing up?

126
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:52,922
- Just a little longer?
- Just a little longer?

127
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:55,188
Come on, sweetheart, you have school tomorrow.

128
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:57,525
Come on. Time for bed.

129
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:02,400
- Getting heavy!
- No, I'm not.

130
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:07,807
Wait a minute.

131
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:10,376
There's something behind your ear.

132
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:13,077
Oh please. That is so lame.

133
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:15,478
- What you mean?
- It's in your hand.

134
00:20:16,852 --> 00:20:20,049
This hand? Or this hand?

135
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:23,618
Watch.

136
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:34,963
- How'd you do that?
- Magic.

137
00:20:35,137 --> 00:20:38,334
- Is it for me?
- Of course it's for you.

138
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:42,009
A diamond for my princess.

139
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:46,647
It's beautiful.

140
00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:49,340
- So are you.
- I love you, Daddy.

141
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:51,145
I love you too.

142
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,514
Let's say our prayers.

143
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:59,516
Angels east, angels west,
north and south, just do your best...

144
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:02,129
...to guard her and watch her
while she rests.

145
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:03,559
- Amen.
- Amen.

146
00:21:03,732 --> 00:21:05,097
Give me some love.

147
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:11,829
Can I have another one?

148
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:15,201
Yeah, you can have another one.

149
00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:19,312
Vanessa's in the bed now.

150
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:23,110
- She'll be asleep for the rest of the night. Ok?
- She won't listen to me lately. Only you.

151
00:21:23,285 --> 00:21:25,845
I'll talk to her in the morning.
Go to sleep anytime. Ok?

152
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:28,888
- I'm watching TV if you need me.
- All right. Thank you.

153
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,124
Player, what the hell happened?

154
00:21:49,344 --> 00:21:53,940
Should we be considering a long vacation in a
warm foreign climate where they have no extradition?

155
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:57,916
The cat that called was only interested
in the black stones.

156
00:21:58,086 --> 00:22:01,283
- Christophe sold us out.
- Or something.

157
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:06,850
- Oh, God, you made it.
- By the skin of my black ass.

158
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:11,898
Man, some Chinese dude kicked my ass
all around that goddamn train track.

159
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:14,501
Asshole busted my earpiece too.

160
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:18,072
- And the worst part, he snagged the loot.
- Shit!

161
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:22,237
So you know, maybe it's time to rethink
this no-gun policy shit.

162
00:22:22,411 --> 00:22:24,208
A little ass-whupping ain't shit.

163
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:27,712
At least you didn't have to play
all foxy with the rent-a-cop! All right?

164
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:32,519
- This all we got.
- So, what do we do now?

165
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,725
- Wait to hear from me.
- So where are you going?

166
00:22:39,361 --> 00:22:41,352
I'm going to get some answers.

167
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:47,297
- Hold up, dog. I got your back.
- I got this one.

168
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,163
But if I need you, I'll call you.

169
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:52,697
- All right.
- All right?

170
00:22:54,343 --> 00:22:56,140
Be careful.

171
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:10,717
So this is Mr. Christophe.

172
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:13,617
Apparently we're not his first visitors today.

173
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:16,525
Please, Senor Ling, have mercy.

174
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:19,895
Whatever you're going to say,
make it the truth.

175
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,768
You may not have another opportunity.

176
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:26,768
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

177
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:33,746
Bang!

178
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:35,315
You like it?

179
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:38,085
It's all right.

180
00:23:40,822 --> 00:23:43,985
You want it? I'll make you
a deal on it, ammo included.

181
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,495
It's got reactive armor, Browning
.50-caliber, 7.62 M-60 machine gun.

182
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:51,565
And that cannon there, that's 90 mm, man.

183
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:55,225
It's good to get around the bad areas of town.
Keeps neighborhood kids in line.

184
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:56,837
- I'll pass.
- All right. How about this?

185
00:23:57,005 --> 00:24:00,338
- A Marine Corps Assault Hovercraft?
- Actually, I'm here on other business.

186
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:03,069
Hey, Arch! We're out of room
in the storage.

187
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:06,772
All right, listen, put them in my office
and be careful with them, they're expensive.

188
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:08,447
Well, not expensive to me.

189
00:24:08,617 --> 00:24:12,314
Hey, listen, you weren't by any chance
downtown today, were you, Tony?

190
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:13,954
Not at all.

191
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:16,985
I didn't think so.

192
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:21,457
- Ever see a black diamond?
- I've seen a white diamond, pink...

193
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,066
...yellow, blue ones. I've seen Neil Diamond.
Awesome in concert.

194
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:26,700
He's in town in two weeks...

195
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:35,340
Never seen a black diamond.

196
00:24:37,713 --> 00:24:39,180
Not like this.

197
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:45,016
- Wow. You got me.
- Find out what they're worth.

198
00:24:45,187 --> 00:24:47,451
- Is there a timetable on this?
- Yesterday.

199
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:49,749
- That's what I figured.
- I'll be back.

200
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:52,860
Gonna return a favor to a friend.

201
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:38,597
Looks dead to me.

202
00:25:40,475 --> 00:25:44,275
- Guess you got to him first.
- Not me, not my style.

203
00:25:44,446 --> 00:25:46,641
You're the one that called me.

204
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:50,610
The same one that bumped into Miles.

205
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,949
Who the fuck are you?

206
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:57,091
- My name is Su.
- All right, Su, I'm Sally.

207
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,921
- I want the black stones.
- Make me an offer.

208
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,798
- You can walk out of here alive.
- No deal.

209
00:26:16,044 --> 00:26:17,409
Leave a message.

210
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:20,776
Mr. Fait, I know you're there.
Pick up the phone.

211
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:25,177
We need to talk, now.

212
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:28,622
Who the fuck is this?

213
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,123
The man for whom Christophe arranged
to have the black stones...

214
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,787
...brought into the country
and deposited at the Jewelry Exchange.

215
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:37,489
The man who wants them back.

216
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,327
- Now.
- All right, well, how much?

217
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:44,628
Maybe you didn't understand me.
The stones are already mine.

218
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:45,830
Yo, check this out?

219
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:48,942
I got them, I'm selling them,
put the money on the wood!

220
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:51,035
I don't have time for this.

221
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:53,181
That's your last offer?

222
00:26:53,515 --> 00:26:55,642
I can be a very dangerous man, Mr. Fait.

223
00:26:57,552 --> 00:27:00,282
I don't understand this shit.
Man, do I look like the Salvation Army?

224
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:04,391
I bust my ass all night and got nothing
to show for it. You know what, dog?

225
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,925
It don't even matter who the fuck you are.

226
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:09,120
I ain't got nothing for you.

227
00:27:55,544 --> 00:27:56,875
Shit!

228
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:15,853
Shit!

229
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:07,742
Give us the stones.

230
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:10,643
How many times I got to tell you people?

231
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:14,414
I'm a businessman.
Make me a fucking offer!

232
00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:17,588
Here's your offer.

233
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:21,551
That shit ain't gonna work, homes,
because I don't have the stones!

234
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,027
Then you gotta tell us where they are.

235
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:37,600
Come on!

236
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,424
The car!

237
00:31:19,214 --> 00:31:21,273
What is it with these fucking stones?

238
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:26,818
- Yeah.
- It's Archie.

239
00:31:26,988 --> 00:31:29,388
Bad news. We got a problem.

240
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:33,525
I put word out on the street
to get some info on the stones.

241
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:36,528
Next thing I know,
the Wu-Tang Clan shows up here.

242
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:38,325
Three important elements here.

243
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,694
One, I'm outmanned...

244
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:43,429
...two, they're heavily armed,
and three, they're about to pound me.

245
00:31:43,605 --> 00:31:47,234
- I can't watch anymore. I got a few licks in...
- Let's see the rest.

246
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:49,900
Did you see my new DVD players?

247
00:31:50,078 --> 00:31:51,136
All right! Okay! Okay! Okay!

248
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:53,843
- Give me that!
- I forgot I had them. Sorry!

249
00:31:54,015 --> 00:31:58,679
I could've resisted more. But they could've
beat me into a coma or killed me.

250
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:02,789
How could I tell Tony where the stones
are if I'm dead or on life support?

251
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:05,653
Right? So I threw in the towel,
reluctantly, for your sake.

252
00:32:05,827 --> 00:32:08,625
- Okay, so you saved yourself to tell me something.
- Right

253
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:10,628
- So tell me.
- What?

254
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,097
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

255
00:32:13,268 --> 00:32:15,600
- What did they say?
- Well, they said:

256
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,864
"Give me the stones,
you fat cracker motherfucker."

257
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,940
- You know. That sort of thing.
- That's it?

258
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:24,510
That's pretty bad.
Cracker is... you know, is kind of racist.

259
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,080
Thanks for keeping yourself alive
long enough to tell me nothing!

260
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:31,013
- Did you call the police?
- Did I call the police?

261
00:32:31,186 --> 00:32:33,177
Look around here, are you crazy?

262
00:32:33,354 --> 00:32:36,289
Only question now is,
who's behind this jack move?

263
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:41,225
I don't know, but they got some great guns
I can't even get. U.S. Special Forces only.

264
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,421
- Chambers.
- Jump Chambers?

265
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,066
I hope not.

266
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:51,064
Hey, who's Jump Chambers?

267
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:53,901
This guy's in on everything
that goes down in this town.

268
00:32:54,075 --> 00:32:57,943
The only one I know that can get those
type of weapons. And he has a fucking army.

269
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,637
You're on your own,
I don't need the headache.

270
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:03,682
And since I'm totally fucked, who are you?

271
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:06,019
Yeah, you got an ID?

272
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:08,712
Buddy? Picture, preferably?

273
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:11,017
Yeah, all right.

274
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:15,856
- This means nothing to me.
- Let me see it.

275
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:20,759
It's Taiwan, Central Security Bureau.

276
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:23,267
- Taiwanese Intelligence.
- Read Chinese?

277
00:33:23,438 --> 00:33:25,429
No, but I know "cop"
in every language.

278
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:27,939
What are you?
Some kind of kung fu James Bond?

279
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:31,273
- The stones belong to Taiwan.
- They belong to Chambers now.

280
00:33:32,313 --> 00:33:35,942
- I'm starting to hate this fucking phone.
- I'll get you a new one.

281
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:39,018
- Yeah.
- I hope you've reconsidered.

282
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:41,587
Oh, it's bad-ass! What's up, homes?

283
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:45,554
You've made this difficult, Mr. Fait.
Let me make it easy.

284
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:48,560
I can't wait to hear this.

285
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:51,722
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

286
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:58,405
She's very pretty in her pink pajamas,
aren't you, Vanessa?

287
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:01,303
- Son of a...
- I want my stones, Mr. Fait.

288
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,800
Let me talk to the Chinese gentleman,
who is with you.

289
00:34:03,978 --> 00:34:05,946
Don't you fucking touch her!

290
00:34:06,114 --> 00:34:08,480
The Chinese gentleman, please.

291
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:17,921
He has my daughter.
He wants to talk to you.

292
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:20,452
Jesus, Tony.

293
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:44,576
What happened? What did you just do?

294
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:48,244
I said I have the stones,
and I won't negotiate for your daughter.

295
00:34:48,423 --> 00:34:49,583
- What?
- That's stupid.

296
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:52,658
It will confuse him,
buy us time, keep her alive.

297
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:56,319
What the hell are you talking about?
This motherfucker has my baby!

298
00:34:56,497 --> 00:34:58,863
Look, I know him.

299
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:03,427
I want the stones, you want your daughter.
We can help each other.

300
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:16,110
So I'm stuck with you.

301
00:35:26,194 --> 00:35:27,320
Get in.

302
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:38,505
We gotta see Chambers.

303
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:05,226
Find a place to put her.

304
00:36:07,301 --> 00:36:10,202
My daddy's gonna come and kick your butts!

305
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:17,270
Su says he has the stones.

306
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:22,338
But why cut me off?
Why not negotiate for the girl?

307
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:24,980
Doesn't make any sense.

308
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:28,455
Buyers fly in tomorrow.
Should we stop them?

309
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:31,087
We'll never regain their confidence.

310
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:35,393
We need information.
Find the right people, pay whatever it costs.

311
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:41,162
Something's not right.
Something's happening with the stones.

312
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:43,466
What about the girl?

313
00:36:44,172 --> 00:36:47,107
We'll need her. She stays alive...

314
00:36:47,241 --> 00:36:48,765
...for now.

315
00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:54,775
Yeah, I'm on my way to see Chambers now.
No, I don't have a choice.

316
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:58,214
Get in touch with his people,
let him know I need to see him.

317
00:36:58,553 --> 00:36:59,577
I'll call you back.

318
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:04,884
I'm sorry about your daughter.

319
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:10,089
- How old is she?
- Mind your business.

320
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,831
She's 8. She'll be 9 in September.

321
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:23,777
Mine is 15.

322
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:27,440
- Boyfriends?
- Never. I'd kill them.

323
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:29,412
You wish.

324
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:36,114
- About time you PMD.
- PMD?

325
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,155
Yeah, put me down.

326
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:40,260
What's this all about?

327
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:45,188
- The stones are not what you think they are.
- No shit.

328
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,760
- What about this guy who has Vanessa?
- He's exactly what you think he is.

329
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:53,896
A thief and a killer.

330
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:59,045
Great.

331
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:01,443
Fucking great.

332
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:07,120
I want my daddy!

333
00:38:07,622 --> 00:38:08,646
Keys.

334
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:13,124
Where'd you get this piece of shit?

335
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:17,958
Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa have
a long walk back from the campground.

336
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:21,067
- You sure you cleaned it out?
- Oh, it's clean, all right.

337
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:27,070
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

338
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,500
Go to sleep!

339
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:52,727
Angels east, angels west...

340
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,698
...north and south, just do your best...

341
00:38:56,204 --> 00:38:59,002
...to guard her and watch her
while she rests.

342
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,369
Amen.

343
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:30,961
Who rang that bell?

344
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,077
Here are your visitors, Mr. Chambers.
And the morning mail.

345
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,608
Hey, yo, Vogel.

346
00:39:45,586 --> 00:39:47,451
My DVD's broke.

347
00:39:47,622 --> 00:39:50,022
Get you a new one straight away,
Mr. Chambers.

348
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:52,455
Well, well, well. Tony Fait.

349
00:39:52,627 --> 00:39:56,961
Come all this way to visit his
old pal Jump. Who's the gook?

350
00:39:57,565 --> 00:39:59,396
Chinese guy.

351
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:03,431
Hey.

352
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,371
No shoes in my crib, man.

353
00:40:22,523 --> 00:40:27,551
- How you doing, Jump?
- Don't waste my fucking time, nigga.

354
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:31,320
- Look, I got a problem.
- How's Daria?

355
00:40:31,966 --> 00:40:34,992
- Good.
- Yeah, she always was good.

356
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:40,129
From the moment I saw her to the
moment you took her away from me.

357
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,936
- Problem?
- The black stones.

358
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:46,477
That bitch brought in too.

359
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:50,674
I made a lot of money with her,
but that's all stopped now. You stopped that.

360
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:53,718
You decided it was okay
to put an end to that.

361
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:57,189
- Black stones, what?
- I need them back.

362
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:00,885
You know, the only smart thing you did
was not pimping her yourself.

363
00:41:01,062 --> 00:41:05,158
See, because then I'd have been real
heated and you'd have been real dead.

364
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,096
But you don't pimp, right?

365
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:11,898
You're just a thief in the night,
stealing shit that don't belong to you.

366
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:14,571
Hey.

367
00:41:21,749 --> 00:41:24,081
- What? He don't talk?
- I don't speak Korean.

368
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:29,316
Yeah, well, I do.

369
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:32,255
Bought me a little Korean
spot right downtown.

370
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:35,259
Bringing in the soul brothers
24-7, 365.

371
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:39,331
Black man gouging Koreans.
Ain't that a switch, Chick?

372
00:41:40,534 --> 00:41:46,063
Them motherfuckers got faces like walls,
but they love to drink and look at naked girls.

373
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,107
Place ain't no shitbox.
You should see my office.

374
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:53,042
Got that shit decked out
like a kabuki love palace.

375
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:55,546
You know what that is, right?

376
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:59,518
Why don't you roll by sometime?
Check out the poon.

377
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:02,817
My little girl is mixed up in this.

378
00:42:04,892 --> 00:42:07,793
If I don't get those stones back,
she's dead.

379
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:14,163
What do you want, man? I mean...

380
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:22,206
- I'm begging.
- You know, I was thinking.

381
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:27,544
That was a big heist. Risky heist.

382
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:34,450
And I'm wondering, what would make a man go
through that kind of trouble, take that kind of heat?

383
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:39,717
Gotta be something good.

384
00:42:42,096 --> 00:42:44,257
Something valuable.

385
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:49,293
Jump...

386
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:52,737
...it's my little girl.

387
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,236
Make another one.

388
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,604
You mother...

389
00:42:57,945 --> 00:42:59,572
Drama.

390
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:02,676
I see the slope's no dope.

391
00:43:04,785 --> 00:43:08,186
Got a lot of offspring running
around, brother.

392
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:10,414
Big score is once in a lifetime.

393
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:13,082
- Yo, let me at him.
- Go ahead. Shit.

394
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:24,637
Say hey to Daria for me.

395
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:28,331
Don't forget your fucking shoes.

396
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:34,970
Pussy.

397
00:43:38,652 --> 00:43:43,521
I used to really look up to that guy.
Used to want to be just like him.

398
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:48,822
- In Taiwan, I can make him talk.
- Yeah, well, this ain't Taiwan.

399
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:53,125
Only thing we can do now is try to find
out where the stones are and get them.

400
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,531
- You make it sound easy.
- It won't be.

401
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:07,073
- What?
- They're at his club.

402
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:09,415
How do you know?

403
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:13,451
I know. I can just feel it.
It's never happened to you?

404
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:15,145
No.

405
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:21,727
- Thought you Chinese people were all mystical.
- We like to gamble. Not guess.

406
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:28,325
It's no guess, but I could be wrong.
I'll hit the club, you go see Archie.

407
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,794
Why?

408
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:35,338
- He has to remember something.
- What if he can't?

409
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:38,501
Pretend it's Taiwan.
Make him remember.

410
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,887
Hey. Get away from here.
What are you doing?

411
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:52,787
Relax. All right? I'm just seeing if I can
help with something.

412
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,361
Well, you can't. It's very delicate
equipment, so just stay away.

413
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,590
All right? Stay away from the truck.

414
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:03,067
- What?
- Stay away from my fucking truck!

415
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:05,364
Okay, stop it.

416
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,607
Backing away.

417
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:11,067
Backing away.

418
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:14,343
Someone give the geek his Ritalin.

419
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:16,108
At least he's doing his job...

420
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,118
...which is more than I can say
for some people. Tape her up and gag her.

421
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:22,380
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!

422
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:24,718
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!

423
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:27,417
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!

424
00:45:27,595 --> 00:45:29,961
- I want my daddy!
- Let go of me!

425
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,927
- Shut up!
- I want my daddy!

426
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,067
- I want my daddy!
- Waste of time.

427
00:45:34,235 --> 00:45:36,465
I can think of a better way
of shutting you up.

428
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,269
Yes!

429
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:44,135
Shit! She's got the key!

430
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:40,897
- Precious Daria.
- What's up, Odion?

431
00:46:41,035 --> 00:46:42,832
Long time, no see.

432
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:46,996
- So, what brings you around here?
- Sometimes you need to see old friends.

433
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:50,066
- What? You got trouble?
- With a capital T.

434
00:46:50,744 --> 00:46:54,680
Tony Fait? Thought you two
were tight. Bonnie and Clyde.

435
00:46:55,749 --> 00:46:57,717
Yeah, it used to be that way.

436
00:46:57,885 --> 00:46:59,819
Not taking care of me these days.

437
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:04,254
Kid's all he cares about.
It's a shame, huh?

438
00:47:04,425 --> 00:47:08,259
- So, what you want me to do?
- I don't know.

439
00:47:08,696 --> 00:47:11,358
Probably nothing you can do.
I just thought...

440
00:47:11,532 --> 00:47:12,897
...you know.

441
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:19,564
No, this is crazy. I don't even know what I was
thinking. I shouldn't be in here. Sorry.

442
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,334
No, hold up, hold up. Girls.

443
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:27,105
- Give us a minute. Champagne?
- Yes.

444
00:47:30,884 --> 00:47:32,408
I got it.

445
00:47:33,153 --> 00:47:37,590
- So, you looking for a job?
- I need something.

446
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:40,783
How about you work here?

447
00:47:41,762 --> 00:47:45,391
How would Jump feel about me
coming back and all?

448
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:48,797
You let me worry about Jump Chambers.
In the meantime...

449
00:47:49,737 --> 00:47:53,798
...how about we go to my office
and we talk about this a little bit more?

450
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:58,909
It's not exactly boxing matches,
it's a lot more dangerous.

451
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:01,240
No gloves or nothing, no rules, period.

452
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:05,715
It's huge money. It's very illegal.
They hold it during the day to fool cops.

453
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:09,049
The man you remember,
how do you know he'll be here?

454
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:13,250
I don't, but this is Chambers' operation,
so it's a damn good place to start.

455
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,321
Here we are.

456
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:20,630
- This is a private club. You can't come in here.
- It's me, Archie.

457
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:24,703
- Everybody likes me here.
- Hey, it's that asshole Archie again.

458
00:48:25,973 --> 00:48:27,565
How can you recognize him?

459
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:31,108
Well, I didn't see his face,
but they all kind of look the same.

460
00:48:31,278 --> 00:48:33,246
Of course so do you guys.

461
00:48:33,647 --> 00:48:37,344
No offense. But I will remember
that pinky ring because it was awesome.

462
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:41,887
He's got, like, a 10-carat, round cut,
square setting, good color and clarity.

463
00:48:42,055 --> 00:48:45,855
I remember thinking about the damage
it'd do to my face if he hit me with it.

464
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:58,531
I gotta make sure Mr. Pinky Ring doesn't
recognize me, so I got a disguise.

465
00:48:58,705 --> 00:49:01,936
- How do we get in?
- Leave it to me. I'll take care of it.

466
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:06,478
Hey, buddy. How you doing?
How's that armor-plated Lincoln I sold you?

467
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:08,979
- Cops stopped me.
- They do that sometimes.

468
00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:10,946
- Car was fucking hot, Archie.
- Hey.

469
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:15,284
I didn't steal it, but stop by the shop
tomorrow. I'll make it right.

470
00:49:15,456 --> 00:49:17,651
- You know the rules. No guests.
- He's not.

471
00:49:17,825 --> 00:49:19,816
He's a fighter. An unofficial entry.

472
00:49:20,227 --> 00:49:22,286
- Him? Is he any good?
- Is he...?

473
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:24,522
He'll kick all those chumps' asses!

474
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:26,825
He'll go Chinese on them!
Teeth will fly.

475
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,628
Blood will splatter!
It'll be awesome! Step aside.

476
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:31,566
No way, Archie. No more favors.

477
00:49:31,738 --> 00:49:34,229
What? You've got to be shitting me.

478
00:49:34,408 --> 00:49:37,969
Somebody's getting a letter from
the Better Business Bureau. All right

479
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:39,976
Excuse us.

480
00:49:43,383 --> 00:49:45,874
You're number 12.
Go get your ass kicked.

481
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:51,981
I didn't come here to fight.

482
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,094
You don't have to fight,
I just said that to get us in.

483
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:15,708
Come on!

484
00:50:17,918 --> 00:50:20,512
Get up! Oh, yeah.

485
00:50:20,988 --> 00:50:22,250
Get up!

486
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,053
Yeah! Yeah!

487
00:50:26,226 --> 00:50:28,023
Tear his eye out!

488
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:34,623
- On a good day, over a million bucks will...
- Just find the ring.

489
00:50:34,768 --> 00:50:38,534
- All right. Okay.
- Knock him out.

490
00:50:39,339 --> 00:50:41,364
- You know...
- Bullshit.

491
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:46,479
...this could take a little while.
All right, come on. Let's go.

492
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:08,426
Sit down.

493
00:51:22,565 --> 00:51:24,897
Why don't you put on some music?

494
00:51:29,906 --> 00:51:31,339
Slower.

495
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:36,869
Just relax.

496
00:51:38,081 --> 00:51:39,571
And watch.

497
00:51:58,935 --> 00:52:00,562
This looks good.

498
00:52:02,272 --> 00:52:04,502
Set it up, tie it at the bottom.

499
00:52:04,674 --> 00:52:10,510
- Tommy, go.
- Here come the bug man.

500
00:52:25,695 --> 00:52:26,957
Excuse me.

501
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,325
Oh hey, what's going on, player?

502
00:52:36,873 --> 00:52:40,570
- Yo, what the hell are you doing?
- Oh, pest control, player.

503
00:52:43,246 --> 00:52:46,215
- Don't tell me you didn't get the notice.
- What notice?

504
00:52:46,383 --> 00:52:50,843
See!? That's what burn my ass right to the bone, man.
A brother just trying to make a living...

505
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,545
You know what?
That's beside the point.

506
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:57,251
If you had gotten your notice,
you'd realize that the city has this new ordinance...

507
00:52:57,394 --> 00:53:00,261
...saying I gotta spray every businesses
that caters to foreigners.

508
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,727
How come?
