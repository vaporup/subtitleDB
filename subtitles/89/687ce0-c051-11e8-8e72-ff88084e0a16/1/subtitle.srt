1
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,262
Stop

2
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,401
Good

3
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,164
Boss, bring me some good wine

4
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:21,841
Ok...

5
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:23,436
Wine is coming

6
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:28,710
So windy

7
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,798
Master, please drink wine

8
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,177
Thirteen cold-blood eagleScare
the ghosts and gods

9
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,507
You want to treacherous plot

10
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,309
Master Chu

11
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,643
You are "Big Dagger" Hon-Chung

12
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,318
You are "Old Eagle" of thirteen
cold-blood eagles, aren't you?

13
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,182
If I know you intrude this matter

14
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,751
We will go immediately

15
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,092
For your killing, raping and robbing

16
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,857
The court offered money

17
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,667
If I let you go, how can I get
the money?

18
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,555
Uncle Yi

19
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,025
Ok... "Little Dagger"

20
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,348
Don't fool around. Calculate it quick

21
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,310
Fire-Eagle

22
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:50,548
Whip-Eagle

23
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,081
Chain-Eagle

24
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,021
His looks is all ruined, how can
we get money

25
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,398
Big and Little Bewitchment

26
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:20,644
Big and Little Bewitchment

27
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,087
- Rob the corpses, quick
- Yes

28
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,278
Hey

29
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:55,845
What

30
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,118
What are you doing?

31
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,855
I'm accosting men to go to bed

32
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,084
Are you interested?

33
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,223
You better stay here

34
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,531
Don't snatch my business again

35
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,798
He hasn't died yet. How can you say
that I snatch your

36
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,832
The better one can snatch the business

37
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,040
Three thousands

38
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,372
Five thousands

39
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,645
There are eight thousands

40
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,673
Sister, if you can catch "Old Eagle"

41
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,715
We can make a hundred thousands

42
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,318
Uncle Yi, try your best

43
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,910
Lady, I don't mean to philander you

44
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:00,847
Please forgive me

45
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,710
I don't care you mean it or not

46
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,325
You've taken the benefit.
I must marry you

47
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,825
Fung Lady. Don't get cold

48
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,234
I don't take the clothes.
I must marry you

49
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,496
Marry me. Hey

50
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:23,865
Uncle Yi

51
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,568
Don't call me Uncle

52
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,040
Everybody has gone

53
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,773
Hey, call me Brother Yi in the public

54
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,647
Not Uncle Yi

55
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,216
Brother Yi. Fung Lady and Fung Ling

56
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,682
Snatched away all the corpses

57
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,017
I know it

58
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,024
It's a small amount. Forget it

59
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,691
We have to rush to the city

60
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,493
There is a big business waiting for us

61
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:57,403
Powerful Eagle

62
00:07:58,911 --> 00:07:59,639
Correct

63
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,741
This money is for brothers

64
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,040
Thank you

65
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,113
Sergeant Ling, I want to ask you
some questions

66
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:08,582
I will tell whatever I know

67
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,147
They are Han's brothers

68
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,688
They always catch thieves for money

69
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,353
But we snatched away all the corpses

70
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,324
Why don't they chase it back?

71
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,099
It must be something wrong

72
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,434
- Go and buy some new clothes
- Ok

73
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,471
They go to city for big business

74
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:28,772
What kind of business

75
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:34,773
Oh

76
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,106
Please come back

77
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,571
Thank you, thank you

78
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,480
Sister, why do they go to city

79
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,247
Don't ask. Let me ask you first

80
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,649
Do you like Hon-Lam?

81
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,656
That Guy is so stupid

82
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:50,462
How do I know?

83
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,696
I think that two guys

84
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,257
must die in our hands, right

85
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,267
Last month on eighth

86
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,401
Nine Tails Fox secretly entered here
at midnight

87
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,811
He stole my best treasure and
a lot of money

88
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,042
I don't care about the money

89
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,383
But when my couriers saw him
he got mad

90
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,586
And killed my folks forty-one persons

91
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,480
Also killed my only daughter Cindy
after raping

92
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,156
My poor Cindy was only thirteen
years old

93
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,022
I would lie to spend all money

94
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,759
For catching "Nine Tails Fox"

95
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,700
I will revenge in front of my
daughter's tomb

96
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,738
Are you so sure that this guy
is "Nine Tails Fox"?

97
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,474
Nine Tails Fox must leave a fox tail

98
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,612
After he committed a crime

99
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,112
Everybody thinks that

100
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,820
his lightness work is very good

101
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,788
Also he is good in designing traps

102
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,891
And feat of arms

103
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,554
He is a slicked guy, and he has
many places to stay

104
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,020
It takes at least a month to find him

105
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,198
I know he is in "Chu's family town"

106
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,699
The distance will take about seven days

107
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,969
I have prepared swift horses for
both of you

108
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,000
They will bring you there in five days

109
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,844
And the price is...

110
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,117
One million, are you satisfied?

111
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,911
You are right. The head of
Nine Tails Fox

112
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,184
costs this price

113
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,556
First give you three hundred thousand
first

114
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,393
If you have caught him, seven days later

115
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,124
We'll meet in "Choi Sun Inn" of
Chung Ka Hau

116
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,231
I will give you the balance

117
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,233
Ok. Keep your promise

118
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,536
We will start immediately

119
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:44,740
I return these to you

120
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,999
We better leave this place

121
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,967
If "Four Gods of Death" come
there will be trouble

122
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,872
You better go, they caught "Big
and Little Bewitchment"

123
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:20,970
That will hold them for few days

124
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,336
They don't kill people these days

125
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,407
Are they interested in women?

126
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,651
No, they trained themselves in evil work

127
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,248
They are never interested in women

128
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,555
But they have caught
Big and Little Bewitchment

129
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:32,855
They just want to revenge

130
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,486
for "Thirteen Cold Blood Eagles"

131
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,094
I think they are in
"Death Men Woods" tonight

132
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,092
after killing Big and Little Bewitchment

133
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,289
Uncle Yi, how is it
They will come out

134
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,999
We have to rush before the sunset

135
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,535
These two women always snatch
our business

136
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,304
And Always get us trouble

137
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,140
Somebody cut their heats for us

138
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,537
That is good

139
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,339
Then we...

140
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,644
Don't expect me to help them

141
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:04,821
Let's glory the "Gods of Deaths"

142
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,682
No dirt, no dust

143
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,254
These guys are so strange

144
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,596
The guy in the front is
"Fight until Die"

145
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,761
The one next to him is "Must Die"

146
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,970
The one behind the altar

147
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,333
is "Never Die"

148
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,234
The one who is sitting down?

149
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,806
Is "Die will one bout"

150
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,136
Thank you. Uncle Yi

151
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,206
Don't thank me

152
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,337
I thank you for "Big and Little
Bewitchment"

153
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,574
Don't mix up

154
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,808
I just do what my conscience

155
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,444
ask me to do

156
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,281
I will kill people

157
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,113
And you escort the Bewitchment

158
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:39,682
Move

159
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,901
You are really "Never Die"

160
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,143
Fung Lady, Fung-Ling, we are coming
to help you

161
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,482
They are not "Big and Little
Bewitchment"

162
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,845
They are glamouretts

163
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,017
Good. To hell with glamouretts

164
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,823
Two women paid us

165
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,083
to flirt these four men

166
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,850
They can play whatever they like

167
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,289
It's none of your business

168
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,761
We have been cheated by these
two women again

169
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,692
Sorry for interrupting

170
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,198
That is a misunderstanding, bye

171
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:26,969
How can you go like this?

172
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:32,569
He died

173
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,304
This is called "Die with one bout"

174
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,351
Brother...

175
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,582
You knew that he is called
"Die with one bout"

176
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,217
You still slap him, no wonder he die

177
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,049
Sister, what shall we do

178
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,787
I guess

179
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,563
"Four Gods of Death" will hold them

180
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,758
for a whole day

181
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,067
We must catch "Nine Tails Fox"

182
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,326
in "Chu's family town"

183
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:58,770
Will they be hurt?

184
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,265
Don't worry, you lover won't get hurt

185
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:03,740
Let's go

186
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,195
"Four Gods of Death" is not as goods
as legend

187
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,165
Legend is always exaggerated

188
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,896
They said that we never miss a dagger
in legend

189
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,129
So what

190
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,135
We always miss

191
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,404
So, that is

192
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,339
One more

193
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,280
You kill him, then, let's eat

194
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:34,895
Can't he die?

195
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,678
I slap him hard

196
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,848
- How is it
- Ok

197
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,543
Let's eat

198
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:31,713
Let's go

199
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,096
You can't stop me. It hurts

200
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,195
Don't talk. Let's go

201
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,464
Hey, Don't go

202
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:48,702
It's good to run fast

203
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:50,870
Return the hand to me

204
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,669
It's bad to run slow

205
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,239
Don't go, hey

206
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,378
Uncle Yi. Return it to him

207
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,046
It is nothing to do with me

208
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,547
It's the hand holding my buttocks

209
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:00,409
Return the hand to me

210
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,382
You are bad

211
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,450
I am not bad. It is fun when
we try some more bouts

212
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,161
What do you mean by "no"?

213
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,725
It is on the book

214
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,670
My waist is almost broken.
I don't play anymore

215
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,005
- Hey. Play a little bit more, wife
- I don't play

216
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,268
Hey, hey...

217
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,169
I stole this book

218
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,409
From "Tien Chuk Monk" difficulty

219
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,209
It is called "Yoga"

220
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,975
This work is good for thinking

221
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,219
You don't know that I consider
about you

222
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,321
It's not so good

223
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,686
You stole this garbage

224
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,825
You should learn it from me. See

225
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,487
I stole a good sword.

226
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,029
It's sharp

227
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,731
What kind of sword do you have?

228
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,265
See my "Gold Dragon Dagger"

229
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,907
It's number one dagger

230
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,707
You stupid. My "Flying Phoenix Sword"

231
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,372
is better than yours

232
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,214
Don't say it

233
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,542
My "Gold Dragon Dagger"

234
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,114
must better than your sword

235
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,350
It is the best one. Do you know it?

236
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,012
If you want to fight with me

237
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,852
Then you must lose

238
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:14,924
and withdraw the battlefield

239
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,319
Shit

240
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,195
Exaggerated. Self concerned. Nonsense

241
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,090
My "Flying Phoenix Sword" can chop
everything

242
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,790
Shit

243
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,102
Look at you

244
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,003
You are not so cantankerous
before I marry you

245
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,572
Oh, you always listen to me
before marriage

246
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:29,366
And you promise everything

247
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,599
And you treat me as a sucker now,
don't you

248
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,039
Husband, I don't want to

249
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,008
- You listen to me when you love me
- Yes

250
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,147
Ok, let's say "Flying Phoenix Sword"
is better

251
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:39,778
You are stubborn

252
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,814
If you say "Flying Phoenix Sword"
is good

253
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,115
Stubborn

254
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,336
You kill your husband for a sword

255
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,400
I say the right thing

256
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,133
I say you are crazy

257
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,243
Come

258
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,091
Hey, wife

259
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,624
Wife, where are you

260
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:32,829
Wife

261
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,262
Bloody Fox

262
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:41,807
Husband

263
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:43,371
Husband

264
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,448
Don't scare me

265
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,609
Husband, are you alright

266
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,025
You broke my "Flying Phoenix Sword"

267
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:00,857
It's not my fault

268
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,167
You abuse me

269
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,002
You ask for it. I told you already

270
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,311
I said you was bad

271
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,246
All the bad thing

272
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,044
will return to you

273
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,175
It is impossible that I am bad

274
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,342
You must apologize within 3 seconds

275
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,452
- One
- No

276
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,315
- Two
- It is not my fault

277
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,053
You can't say "Three"

278
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,365
Hey, wife

279
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,465
Hey, lover

280
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,736
Are you kidding, you are so slick

281
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:40,768
We agreed to count from one to three

282
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,873
It's just nonsense

283
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,805
I lost my wife and my dagger

284
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,678
She has gone

285
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,753
Let me check my record

286
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:03,883
The record of my wife's disappearance

287
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,997
The first disappearance for one month
in seven years ago

288
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,128
The second disappearance for fifteen
days in five years ago

289
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,566
The third disappearance for seven days
in three years ago

290
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,399
The forth disappearance for three days
in one year ago

291
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,699
The fifth disappearance for one day
in three months ago

292
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,035
Oh, That means she will return
within two hours

293
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,280
Let me read the Scripture in toilet

294
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,683
You come back so early

295
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,518
You have done whole-body beauty.
You are much prettier

296
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,787
And you come to apologize
with someone else

297
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,421
Two women serve a man

298
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,193
I will try my best

299
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,663
Are you "Nine Tails Fox"?

300
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,529
And you've changed your voice as well

301
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,200
You are completely different. I love it

302
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,565
We are satyr-catchers. Our names are

303
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,042
Big and Little Bewitchment

304
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,134
I have known you...

305
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,238
If I know there is a satyr

306
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:57,677
I will let you know

307
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,478
That is alright. You can go now

308
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,216
But the case happened in Master Lui's
house was beheld

309
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,154
Who is Master Lui? I have not heard
this name

310
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:08,816
Still not to admit

311
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:14,991
Go

312
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:23,897
Still coming

313
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:27,477
Procuress

314
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:34,342
Watch

315
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:35,944
Holy Fox eliminate

316
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,121
If I know it is so easy

317
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,259
I won't spend half day

318
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,888
It waste my time

319
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,291
Hon-Lam. Don't run so quickly

320
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,426
Help me

321
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,163
Not so hard. You might tear
my good trousers

322
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,167
You tore it. I am very sad

323
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,904
Return the hand to me

324
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,206
Hide, hide

325
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,145
Return the hand to me

326
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,117
Return the hand to me

327
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,754
I know you are hiding

328
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:19,430
Don't make noise

329
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:20,961
Return the hand to me

330
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,367
Come out. Come and fight with me

331
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,065
I "Never Die" means never die

332
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,070
Oh, You are not die yet

333
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,170
Why do you defiance me

334
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,103
Who defiance you

335
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:35,776
You learn it in a wrong way

336
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,739
Eat well in the future

337
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:41,710
You've come out

338
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,984
Help

339
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,585
Help

340
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:52,795
Please release us quickly

341
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,258
Help

342
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,799
It's no use to shout. Nobody can
hear you

343
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,197
I can do whatever I want this time

344
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,370
Bastard, release us

345
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:06,905
I will come to you

346
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,471
You are screaming so loudly
I come to you first

347
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,615
Hey. Are you mad? Aren't you a man?

348
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,748
Look. She is just a kid

349
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,846
Ok. You come to her

350
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,621
Come to me first, come

351
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:20,921
Don't shout

352
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,852
I will come to you later. I listen to you

353
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,888
You little beauty. So noisy

354
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:30,759
I draw a turtle on your head

355
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:35,297
Hon-Chung

356
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,702
Two more men are coming

357
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,111
Don't let them know that I am here

358
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:41,937
I know

359
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:43,577
You can't tell

360
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,611
Hey. You pretend that I am not here

361
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,924
Hey. I call you husband.

362
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,190
Please help me

363
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,490
He is "Never Die"

364
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:57,760
I can't help myself

365
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,025
Never Die. It's valuables

366
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,096
People would like to see it in exhibition

367
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,366
I don't believe it, let me try

368
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,402
How can "Never Die" die

369
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,371
When I slap him

370
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:20,979
Hero escorts the beauty

371
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,185
I'm tired. Thank you

372
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,039
Don't come closer

373
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,812
Too strong. Don't give me trouble

374
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:54,648
Let me take a rest

375
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,116
Hon-Lam, I implicate you

376
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,317
It's none of you business

377
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,721
We will die soon

378
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,329
- Let me ask you something
- Please ask

379
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,096
Do you like me?

380
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,899
I like you very much

381
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,671
It's so glib

382
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,168
He must be afraid glib talking

383
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,771
Hey. Say something glib. Quick

384
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,312
Hey. What do I say?

385
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,286
Anything. I love you. I kiss you

386
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,084
I do it for you

387
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,185
Hon-Chung. Let me say it

388
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,657
I love you. Please hold me

389
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,650
I belong to you

390
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,491
Ok

391
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:44,567
I come secretly and I go secretly

392
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,536
When I wave my sleeve, it takes away...

393
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,068
Your bra

394
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,205
It's so glib

395
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,176
He is afraid of glib talking

396
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,547
Be quick. Say some more

397
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:58,746
Ok

398
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:00,545
Ok, I say

399
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,377
Hon-Chung. Will you love me
in the rest of life?

400
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,785
Will you treat me as a part of
your body?

401
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:06,756
I do

402
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,487
I would like to eat the food you cook

403
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,620
I can't stand it

404
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,459
I drink your human milk

405
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,026
Not enough. Not enough

406
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,661
Say more exciting one

407
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:17,966
I can't say it. I am shy

408
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,534
Go on, that's right

409
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,698
I caress you hands

410
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,408
Can't you listen Mandarin?

411
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,679
- Why. Why doesn't he scare it
- How can I say it

412
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,288
Act. Do the action

413
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,486
How to act

414
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:43,687
I grab

415
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,553
Ok

416
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,854
I really grab it

417
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,334
Grab it. Grab it

418
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,732
Don't come any closer. I really grab it

419
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,767
I grab. I can't grab it

420
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,675
I kiss

421
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,185
I want to know how you "Never Die"

422
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,891
Hey. Sorry Don't be silly

423
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,626
Throw out

424
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,163
It will be more comfortable. That's Ok

425
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,605
Are you alright. Be careful. Ok

426
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,138
Hey

427
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,846
Do you know who I am?

428
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,684
I don't care who you are.
Why do you hit my vital point

429
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,114
Let me tell you

430
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,285
We are "Big and Little Flying Dagger"

431
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,785
- I come to catch you
- Hey, I helped you

432
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:45,956
You are heartless, you...

433
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:53,690
Miss Fung

434
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:55,963
When we were fighting

435
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,329
the content we talked

436
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,233
- What
- That speech is completely

437
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:00,928
What

438
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,907
- What
- Not true

439
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,167
Not true

440
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,809
Every man is heartless

441
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,137
What we have talked

442
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,715
- Is not true. Is that right
- Yes

443
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,718
Uncle Yi. What do we do with
Nine Tails Fox

444
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,086
Now, you are talking about this

445
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,314
Don't argue. Listen to me

446
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,449
We escort him to Master Lui

447
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,692
And share one million dollars
Do you agree?

448
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,792
Ok, but you can't be slick

449
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,064
Ok

450
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:32,468
Let's go

451
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,107
It's so strong

452
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,583
Husband, husband

453
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:54,014
Where is he? He might hide somewhere
for scaring me

454
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,258
So terrible

455
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,224
He might be hurt

456
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,397
Don't worry. I have a replay machine

457
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,675
Why did "Big and Little Bewitchment"
come here?

458
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,779
Bastard. He want rebel me

459
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:33,330
They are also interested in man.
It made me mad

460
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,030
Why was he caught by "Big and Little
Flying Dagger" and Bewitchment

461
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:50,573
Old Guy

462
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,079
Why didn't you help my husband?

463
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,448
I am in charge with the scene

464
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,780
I don't care anything else

465
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:01,784
Absolutely stupid guy

466
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:06,190
Hey

467
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,430
This chicken is very delicious. Try it

468
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,760
Hey. You can't maltreat my grateful
buddy

469
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:14,597
You know

470
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,671
We are kind. How can we maltreat you?

471
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:19,768
Yes

472
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,738
I don't blame you that you hang me

473
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,302
You are sitting here for dinner

474
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,479
- You want to starve me
- Ok

475
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,213
I give it to you

476
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:30,648
I don't eat chicken tail

477
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,151
I eat chicken leg

478
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,014
You are satyr. You think you are
superior

479
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,954
Don't you want chicken leg?

480
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,491
You two coquettes are accosting
boy friends

481
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:41,897
I can't stand it

482
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,461
Keep quiet or I cut you tongue

483
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,398
I don't believe it

484
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,466
You sit down first
You sit down first

485
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,799
No need to argue with him

486
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,040
You let him talk to himself

487
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,875
He will stop when he is thirsty

488
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,004
I won't stop

489
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,149
until tomorrow morning

490
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,983
Hon-Lam, when you finish
you go to bed

491
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,418
We have to go to "Choi Sun Inn"
tomorrow morning

492
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,386
Let me tell the truth for you.
You two lusts

493
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,685
You want to catch women when I sleep

494
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,429
I know it, but I don't care

495
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:14,632
Whores met fancy men this time

496
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,660
I pretend to sleep, then you won't be
embarrassed

497
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,735
Hey, Nine Tails Fox

498
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:20,568
You don't have to talk so much

499
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,302
We won't let you go

500
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,106
You can sleep

501
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,968
But if I want to urinate at midnight

502
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:29,738
Will you think that it is raining?

503
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,847
Hon-Lam give me a rope to strangle him

504
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,383
Then it won't rain tonight

505
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,744
Hey...

506
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,017
Boy, don't fool around

507
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,217
Hey...

508
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,953
You abject, Cad, Cur

509
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,756
Nine Tails Fox, keep quiet

510
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,793
or I bury you.
Sorry

511
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:52,692
Ok, Let's sleep

512
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,461
Everybody is sleeping. Let me escape
with "special escape method"

513
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,668
Not so painful

514
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,177
Don't go

515
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,311
Fanciful censer

516
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,047
You want to catch me. You are stupid

517
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,024
Don't come any closer

518
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:29,429
I am poisoned

519
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:30,660
Hon-Chung

520
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:32,864
Go way I feel hot

521
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,166
Brother Yi, how about you

522
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,307
- Your face are burning
- So do you

523
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,004
Hold me

524
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,476
I can't stand it. I want to hold you

525
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,206
I can't stand it

526
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,177
I want it.
Hurry

527
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:47,477

Hon-Lam. Be hurry

529
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,554
Punch my chest

530
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,522
Hurry, I can't stand it

531
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,527
Didn't you say to punch my chest.
Let me take a rest

532
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:03,865
Sister

533
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:07,299
- Hon-Chung. I want it.
- Please come

534
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,430
Virgin boy's urine is a detoxification
of fanciful censer

535
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,673
Virgin boy's urine Hon-Chung

536
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,071
- Sister. You don't make it

537

What did I do?

540
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,285
We are lucky that you get virgin

541
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,923
It's not mine. It's his

542
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,655
His

543
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,196
So embarrassed

544
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,100
Master Nine Tails Fox

545
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:43,965
Oldest Lady, how are you

546
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,111
Second Lady, Third Lady, how are you

547
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,004

548
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:51,772
Forth Lady, I love you

549
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,776
- Master Nine Tails Fox

00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:55,941
What kind of wind blow you here?

551
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:57,812
It doesn't matter

552
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:58,889
It is not a lie

553
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,192
I want all the ladies except you

554
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,021
My wife keep watching me all days

555
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,226
I can do whatever I want now

556
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:13,133
Flower in Spring, "Moon in Autumn"

557
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,069
Everybody come

558
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,164
Come, hurry up

559
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,846
This is the only town within hundred
square miles

560
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,341
Unless he walked twenty four hours

561
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,681
Otherwise he will stay here

562
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,155
But if I were he

563
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,823
I must go as far as I could.
I wouldn't stay here

564
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:34,783
It is right

565
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:35,751
What will we do?

566
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,522
Let's chase him fifty miles more

567
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,696
- Strange hand
- Why are you here

568
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,496
This hand is very strange

569
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,703
- Of course. It belongs to "Never Die"
- Yes?

570
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,444
It seems to take us to somewhere

571
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,847
Do you think it know "Nine Tails Fox"
where about

572
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,544
- Follow it
- Follow it

573
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:12,087
- Master Nine Tails Fox, do you feel comfortable
- Good

574
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,930
Do you feel happy?

575
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,896
Good

576
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:20,128
What

577
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,837
Beauty comes and drinks with you

578
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,139
You cover your face, how do I know
you are beautiful or not

579
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,733
Come, come. Let me see you

580
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:49,990
I can't stand. My floor

581
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:53,928
You are bad girl

582
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,668
And the bad boy, treacherous plot me

583
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,446
Don't fight, don't fight

584
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,916
Fanciful censer

585
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:18,654
Stand firmly

586
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,769
I took you belt

587
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,130
Why don't your trousers loose?

588
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,347
I hit your vital point

589
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:38,946
And you can steal my belt

590
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:39,946
Why don't you fall down?

591
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,920
You are a cad. How can you steal
my belt?

592
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,185
Tie him up

593
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,417
Four people, fight with one person
are not heroes

594
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,120
We've never said that we were heroes

595
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,292
World's changed. World's changed

596
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,093
I was the only thief in the past

597
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,432
Now everybody is a thief

598
00:38:58,803 --> 00:38:59,861
I will never use a belt in the future

599
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,479
I want it

600
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,046
What do you want?

601
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:20,813
No. I don't want it

602
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,594
I know you've smelt fanciful censer

603
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,194
I can't stand it

604
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,627
I got detoxification

605
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,265
Don't push me, don't be hurry

606
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,232
Go in

607
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,000
- I will give you detoxification
- Good

608
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:48,343
Uncle Yi

609
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:52,714
What happened. Uncle Yi

610
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:53,749
Don't say it

611
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,423
Come here

612
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,429
I planned to give her detoxification

613
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,089
But she was so quick

614
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:05,665
I don't know the reason

615
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,797
And she bit it away

616
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,909
Hon-Lam, you got to be more careful
in the future

617
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:13,841
And learn more

618
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,772
Uncle Yi can't take care of you anymore

619
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,439
I have no more detoxification

620
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,351
It's so suddenly

621
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,594
- Dinner is ready
- Be quick

622
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:46,767
There are only buns. Why on dishes

623
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,978
Wait it for a moment. When I got money

624
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,211
I will take you a better restaurant

625
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,845
Sister, let me pick up some flowers
for you

626
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,448
Hey, Feed me. You always look at girls

627
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,508
Why are you here

628
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,104
Eat it

629
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:29,644
Give you

630
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,792
Hit the satyr harder and harder

631
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,290
- Odd
- Even

632
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:17,919
- Odd

633
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:18,621

634
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:19,253
- Odd

635
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,029
Open it

636
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,726
Odd...

637
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,235
Two, four

638
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:26,798
Six

639
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:28,104
Eight

640
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:29,562
It's even

641
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,113
Even. I lose this time

642
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:43,786
Wife

643
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,213
Can't I eat these flies? The taste is bad

644
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:48,183
That's good

645
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,727
Ok if you make love with me

646
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,288
Will you throw out if you make love
with me?

647
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,725
Yes. I won't throw out if I eat all the
flies

648
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,092
But I will throw out if I make love
with you

649
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,736
When I marry you...

650
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,298
You said that I was so beautiful

651
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,406
And you don't like me anymore now

652
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,235
Somebody is coming

653
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,907
Sir, Good morning

654
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:16,447
Sir, what would you like

655
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,021
We want four good rooms

656
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:19,818
Ok... Ah Ming

657
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,518
Take them to the good rooms

658
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:23,725
This way, please

659
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:25,620
Please

660
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,728
Let me drink

661
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:34,400
Are you crazy?

662
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,538
Wife, I am thirsty

663
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:37,741
I want to wet my lips

664
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,502
Do you drink wine again?

665
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,777
Don't you remember you bad habits?

666
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,204
You will tell the truth after drinking

667
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:44,480
You should be careful

668
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,940
Then, I don't drink

669
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,511
Wife, why do these Japanese come

670
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:49,816
They are malicious

671
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,619
I guess they are Japanese "Yi-Ho"
sorcerers

672
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:56,426
Yi-Ho sorcerers

673
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,725
They have no point to come here

674
00:44:58,962 --> 00:44:59,724
Boss

675
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:03,732
Beauty. What do you want?

676
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:06,936

Be careful

684
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:28,549
- No need to hurry
- What are you doing

685
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:30,320
- No need to hurry

686
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:33,061
They are "Number One thief Flying cat"

687
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,127

You are so knowledgeable

689
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,211
Do you know this one?

690
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:53,872
- I know

691
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,214
It comes from mystic country in the west

692
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,452
Egypt. This thing is called vampire

693
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:04,753
Also called "Mummy"

694
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:05,951
Mummy

You think that Master Lui will pay
for you

710
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:44,634
He says the foul languages

711
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,827
Do you feel too hot?

712
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,238
How can you talk when you are tied up
like this?

713
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:50,740

00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,615
We should be careful

00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:16,383
Do you understand?

735
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:22,428

00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:35,176

00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,242

00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,005
I am "Western Ace"

752
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:45,879
I never lose

753
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:47,847
Who want to challenge me?

754
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,459
There is no fun at all

755
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,690
Who want to lose? Challenge me

756
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,111
Oh, this wine is so strong

757
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,775
They don't take the wine

758
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:26,513
Are you angry?

759
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,996
Chung

760
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:36,129
Come and eat first

761
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,059
Come. Don't be angry

762
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:39,630
Shit

763
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,565
Where have all the champions gone

764
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:43,200
I am so happy. I feel happy

765
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:05,186
Come and challenge me

766
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:09,488
Hey... I don't want anything

767
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,667
I just want to have fun

768
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,476
Oh baby, oh take me baby

769
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:26,106
You are a cad

770
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:27,845
Are you happy?

771
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,411
Cad

772
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,880
Do you feel comfortable?

773
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,982
Oh come one baby, light my fire

774
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,391
Good, fantastic

775
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,986
You can go home now

776
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:44,094
I like it aha...

777
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:46,661
Bye

778
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:47,931
Don't worry

779
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,806
He is my old customer. He is a gay

780
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:52,932
He likes to be maltreated

781
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,144
Since his best friend "Oriental Ace"
left him

782
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,269
He started getting mad every night

783
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,742
Then I will whip him

784
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,609
for comforting him

785
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,882
One more time

786
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,520
Sorry. It's not finished yet

787
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,249
Blow it

788
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,584
Happy birthday, baby

789
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,555
Go to bed

790
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:11,755
It's Ok

791
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:13,518
Let's eat. Nothing happened

792
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:14,626
Excuse me. Excuse

793
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:17,192
I buy sausage only

794
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:19,524
Shit

795
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,463
Shit

796
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,796
- Chung, he look down on you again
- Shit

797
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,035
Hon-Lam. Take him to room

798
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,133
Hey, feed him some bananas

799
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:29,943
Then give him some pineapples

800
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,278
- Shit
- Be quick

801
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,609
Oh, shit

802
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:40,485
Cheer

803
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:43,192
Shit

804
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:46,654
Drink it again

805
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:50,761
Drink some more

806
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:57,797
No, I am drunk

807
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,306
You can drink. Let's drink

808
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:03,306
Ok

809
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,182
Cheer

810
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:15,616
I am drunk

811
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:20,857
Ok. That's enough

812
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,597
Some girls use this method before

813
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,198
How can you copy it?

814
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,955
What

815
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,688
You are so lascivious

816
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:53,961
I come to help you

817
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:55,328
Can't you say something better?

818
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,927
I say it again. You are beautiful,
intelligent,

819
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:58,932
cute

820
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,211
Good. Hey, wife

821
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,079
They are fighting now

822
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:13,944
Let's watch it

823
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,376
Good. Good

824
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:28,825
Don't get mad

825
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,134
You just want to catch the thief

826
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:35,199
When

827
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,835
did "Yi-Ho" work for city hunter?

828
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,102
Off-duty

829
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:18,581
The dagger was so fast

830
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,012
It's a sword, not a dagger

831
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:55,843
Flying cat

832
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:59,016
You two chicks caught my husband

833
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:00,988
Your husband is a satyr

834
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,215
Are you are not better than him

835
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,992
Your husband worth a million

836
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,152
You must worth fifty thousands

837
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:07,359
Caught you

838
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,288
Let's make money for cosmetic

839
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,624
All of you have to die

840
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,061
Japanese dogs, Get away

841
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:34,153
Wife. Do your best. I support you

842
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:41,358
Be careful of me

843
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:23,101
Let me do it

844
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,266
Hon-Lam, be careful. You are not so
strong

845
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,371
Don't worry

846
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:53,627
I must catch you this time

847
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,073
Wife, you let me down

848
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,701
I fail this time

849
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,912
We are in same situation

850
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:34,468
The courier of Tak-Chuen General
want to see Old-timer Dicky Lui

851
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,076
This is a place of "East-Frontier"

852
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,109
There is no Old-timer Dicky Lui.
Leave

853
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,384
You have killed all the guards

854
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:44,851
And don't recognize it

855
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,385
Leave or I will kill you

856
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,891
No

857
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:02,404
I think you are "Erotomania Man
and Evil Lady" of "Yi Ho"

858
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:09,010
Tak-Chuen General sent me to help you

859
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,508
Old-timer Dicky Lui's helmet have been
stolen by Nine Tails Fox

860
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,214
There is a letter inside it

861
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:17,911
The general said

862
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:20,688
If you can't get it back

863
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,715
We have to try our best to destroy
the letter

864
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,685
So, you send people to Choi-Sun Inn
to catch Nine Tails Fox

865
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:27,860
It is very stupid

866
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:30,497
I have arranged everything

867
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,531
Hon-Chung will give him to me
tomorrow

868
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:36,629
Now you spoilt the plan

869
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,905
I don't care anything about Hon-Chung

870
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,801
We just have to destroy the letter

871
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:46,047
Even you don't care about the alleging
of treason

872
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:50,982
The general doesn't want to stay
in China

873
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,179
To be a joke for people

874
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,686
It is good

875
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,783
I know the Kungfu of "Yi-Ho"
is very strong

876
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:00,824
You can take the letter yourself

877
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,561
To save my time

878
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,061
I can pretend as Master Lui as before

879
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:09,967
When I get the Nine Tails Fox
and the letter

880
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,265
Then I can tear away my mask

881
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:32,958
Your virgin course is unbeatable now

882
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,124
Yes

883
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:37,328
Don't let other people knows

884
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:51,872
Six person died, and three person
escaped

885
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,612
One person was hurt

886
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,879
One room is four dollars

887
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,047
Five rooms are twenty dollars

888
01:00:58,454 --> 01:00:59,944
You have to live half a year

889
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,323
And one thousand dollars
for keeping secret

890
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,388
Also clearing charge and miscellaneous
charge

891
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:08,427
That is seven thousand and
eight hundred dollars totally

892
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:10,927
They have killed so many people

893
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,098
They could kill two

894
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,559
They can save that money if they kill us

895
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:16,865
Don't kill me, don't kill me

896
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,269
Don't be afraid

897
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,443
We work for the police

898
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:26,608
We are entitled to kill the robbers

899
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,775
Ok. You can kill the bad guys

900
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,418
But don't kill the good guys

901
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,852
What are you talking about?
They are thieves

902
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,252
They killed many people
in Master Lui's house

903
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,826
They raped and robbed. I got their loots

904
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:41,929
They said that they are good guys

905
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:43,923
We just stole the money.
We never killed

906
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,761
He killed Master Lui's daughter
after raping

907
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:48,700
You really killed and raped

908
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:49,763
No, wife

909
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:50,939
I was with you at that night

910
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,502
You knew that I didn't do it

911
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,135
Wait a for a moment

912
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,841
But you went to the toilet alone

913
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:58,243
What, It just took a few minutes

914
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,973
How could I kill a girl after raping

915
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:01,876
I am coming to help you

916
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:02,779
You are a cad

917
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:04,786
I am so bad

918
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,544
You send me to Omei Mountain
to be a tonsure

919
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,085
But Omei Mountain is so far

920
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:08,919
I can't ask you to go

921
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,692
Or you can release me, I go there myself

922
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:13,486
How can you say it?

923
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:14,691
Do you think he is an idiot?

924
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:16,756
- I just try it
- Just try it

925
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:21,435
Chung, I think that the business

926
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:22,798
There is something wrong

927
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:25,403
Why did Master Lui ask us
to release them here?

928
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:26,733
Why didn't he want us to take them back?

929
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:28,340
Also, when we come here

930
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:29,706
Japanese want to snatch Nine Tails
Fox as well

931
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,140
Can you explain it?

932
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,608
I look like an idiot. Why do you ask me?

933
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:34,908
Let's sleep

934
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:37,510
Chung

935
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:41,445
Where is our room?

936
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:42,482
I want a suite

937
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:44,087
- Uncle Yi
- Not Uncle Yi

938
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,927
Call me brother Yi in front of the girls

939
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:46,919
Come here

940
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,725
I just pretend it. There are many people
on the top of the room

941
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,932
We pretend to return to room

942
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:52,963
To see what will happen

943
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:54,232
Go to bed after urinating

944
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:56,967
Nonsense

945
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:25,161
You don't look like idiots

946
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,561
- Why can't you know they are not real
- Yes

947
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:36,276
Come out, wife, be quick

948
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,336
Let's watch it

949
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,209
Good, good, harder

950
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:58,194
That's good

951
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:00,158
Yes

952
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:10,603
Good

953
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,626
No, let me help them

954
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:28,558
Don't help them

955
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:36,768
Be shameful, I must go down

956
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:37,472
I say no

957
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:38,970
I can't stand it

958
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:40,102
If you help them

959
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:41,467
I divorce with you

960
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:45,209
You should say it earlier

961
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:50,743
Who are you?

962
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:54,255
I was taken the five awards

963
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,587
To win the competition

964
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,484
And got the goodwill of Kungfu fighter

965
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,226
I am Leslie Cheung

966
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:00,291
This is my wife Anita Mui

967
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:02,092
Anita Mui

968
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,230
Is something wrong?

969
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:06,600
Why do you come to this?

970
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:08,801
Because I had got too many awards

971
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,096
So I retired

972
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,275
I got it

973
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:23,912
- Don't be afraid
- I am alright

974
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:24,779
I am here

975
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,494
You just lose. You don't have to kill
yourself

976
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:40,332
This is the liquid of centipede

977
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:45,238
No, she is showing us the Japanese
Kungfu

978
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,835
She make herself full of toxic

979
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,008
Then she will use the "kissing course"

980
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:53,072
You are so clever

981
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:59,379
I hide... hide

982
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:04,519
Hide... hide

983
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:07,858
Is that good?

984
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:10,389
Is that good?

985
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:14,531
Sorry, I forgot to tell you

986
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:15,801
The last award

987
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,165
I got is unbeatable ring

988
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:18,896
And the penis protector

989
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:20,632
Is that right

990
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:23,673
Go away

991
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:26,577
You can come when you are free

992
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,379
Kissing course

993
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:41,759
Chung

994
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,134
What, are you alright

995
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:57,041
You tell me

996
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,007
Big deal

997
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:01,942
Chung

998
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:04,846
- Fung
- What

999
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:09,120
I know I am poisoned. I will die soon

1000
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:13,553
Before I feel painful

1001
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,128
You better kill me

1002
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,894
No, you are poisoned because of me

1003
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,067
I must get the detoxification for you

1004
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:24,371
No, after I die

1005
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:28,240
You can carry someone else.
I can't take care of you anymore

1006
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:30,511
But, on the first, fifteenth

1007
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:32,676
On the second, sixteenth,
third, seventeenth

1008
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,141
- forth, eighteenth
- Don't talk anymore

1009
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:35,914
I am not finished

1010
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:37,478
When Ching-Ming, Chung-Yeung

1011
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:38,675
Christmas, New Year

1012
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:42,316
You have to offer me some sacrifice

1013
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:43,851
Also

1014
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,993
- you have to take care Hon-Lam for me
- Brother Yi

1015
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:51,967
Forget it, you can call me Uncle Yi

1016
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:52,865
To be more comfortable

1017
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:54,860
Chung

1018
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,200
I belong to you forever

1019
01:07:58,874 --> 01:07:59,863
Either alive or die

1020
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:01,974
There is a method

1021
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,175
He got toxic of "Kissing Course"

1022
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:05,937
He will feel fancy after one hour

1023
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,080
When he feel fancy, he will

1024
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,978
It is not suitable for children

1025
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,486
- We are eighteen years old
- Is that right?

1026
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,314
You go to the wood

1027
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:15,485
Yes, go out

1028
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:16,849
Go out. Go out

1029
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,124
Don't listen to this, go out

1030
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:20,790
You are under eighteen years old

1031
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,028
Don't fool around

1032
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,328
You have to make love with
woman nine times

1033
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:27,659
Then, the toxic will be disappeared

1034
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,431
And this woman will carry a strange
fetus

1035
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,400
- Strange fetus?
- Yes, it will take three days

1036
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,939
The baby will be delivered
three days later

1037
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:35,939
That you can cook the strange fetus
and eat it

1038
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:37,338
- Then the toxic will be disappeared
- Really?

1039
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:39,044
Yes, there will be a strange fetus

1040
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:40,506
I am not talking about the strange fetus

1041
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,374
I ask if he will completely recover

1042
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:45,584
Wake up...

1043
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:47,212
What a nice hairstyle

1044
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,524
Look and you'll see

1045
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,318
I have come around

1046
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:54,385
Really

1047
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,566
Let's go and neutralize poison

1048
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,624
Go and neutralize poison

1049
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:03,103
Luckily I'm not poisoned

1050
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:04,734
Or I'll suffer

1051
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:05,998
By eating ox's penis as nutrition

1052
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:13,208
I am lucky. I got the liquid of centipede

1053
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,049
I have been waiting for twenty years

1054
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:18,117
Let's have honeymoon

1055
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:23,321
And fever all night

1056
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:37,964
The moon is so bright

1057
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,203
Idiot. You always talk about the moon

1058
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:46,444
The moon is so beautiful

1059
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,375
Can you talk something else?

1060
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,851
What does my Uncle Yi do
with your sister?

1061
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,259
Let's talk about ourselves

1062
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,756
He is not so stupid

1063
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,565
You are quite naughty

1064
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:14,606
Do you like it?

1065
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:17,543
Yes

1066
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:33,122
What

1067
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,095
Don't be afraid

1068
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,291
I believe that Hon-Chung and
Fung Lady

1069
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:41,733
won't give us the thieves easily

1070
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,535
So I need your help

1071
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,322
Old-timer... did you meet an enemy

1072
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:04,958
No, I got caught by my wife

1073
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:07,857
I am convinced

1074
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,455
As you're aged already

1075
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:12,357
You should get on well with your wife

1076
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,200
Anybody will be jealous

1077
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:16,102
When I am so old

1078
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,299
I can't do it

1079
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:22,670
Lend me your chair

1080
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:24,644
Why are you here?

1081
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:26,105
Old-timer

1082
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:28,649
You don't think that you threaten Madam

1083
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:29,476
Then I will be afraid

1084
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,280
- Madam released us
- Yes?

1085
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,812
They are innocent

1086
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,154
That is the fault of the helmet

1087
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:40,188
There is a letter inside Master Lui's
helmet

1088
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,292
Let me see

1089
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,595
Satyr, how are you

1090
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,404
Still coming

1091
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,109
That Master Lui

1092
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:58,903
is Dicky Lui of East frontier

1093
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:01,943
He also involve with Japanese

1094
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:04,118
Can't I read?

1095
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,684
I am not talking to you.
I am talking to him

1096
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:07,248
Oh, you don't read

1097
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:09,083
- Let me explain it for you
- Don't explain it anymore

1098
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,117
Good, Madam

1099
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,894
How do you know there is a
letter inside?

1100
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,664
You are so stupid

1101
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,962
- Don't you know who I am?
- Don't tell them

1102
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:21,258
- Tell them
- No

1103
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:22,704
I let you drink wine

1104
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,772
We are the top detective
Pang Ting Hong

1105
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:34,913
Do the right thing

01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:36,412
So many people are angry with me

1107
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:39,049
Although I can tell who is good guy
or bad guy

1108
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,988
But the court still punish me

1109

1110
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,920
And send me to the frontier and
clean the toilet for three years

1111
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:46,887
This is not the worst

1112
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,625
They also punish me to marry her

1113
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,323
She has married for nine times

1114
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:53,362
She gave birth of child on the
wedding night

1115
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:54,499
But the child had not the buttocks

1116
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:55,761
Enough, don' tell them

1117
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:58,603
The child had not the buttocks

1118
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,365
Can you help me please

1119
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,645
You were the top detective

1120
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,708
Sorry for misunderstanding

1121
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,778
Hon-Lam and Fung Ling have gone to...

1122
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:16,348
Come

1123
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,859

They asked for four persons to go

1150
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:11,740
They are just kidding

1151
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:48,540

1164
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,775

01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,823
Drunkenness, still alive after soldiering

1173
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:04,420
You come here for rebelling me again

If that is not take is not taken away.
It's difficult to hold it

1178
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:01,876
You miss it

1180
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:24,402

01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:03,869
Feel fancy

1182
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:20,887

You succeed,
but my tails have been broken

1192
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:09,607
I don't know what to do in the future

1193
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,246
Don't worry, I learn a new one

1194
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:14,712
I also learn a new one

1195
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:21,080
Help him first

Ok, I kill all of the people

1197
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:34,797
Be careful

1198
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,369
I want all of the people die

1199
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:19,939
Holy Fox pass air

1200
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:22,308

1201
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:25,980
Stink, what's the smell?

1202
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:53,442
Hold it, everybody

Hon-Lam, help me quickly

1208
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,325
Hon-Lam, I hate you

1209
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:21,667
Good

1210
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:23,865
- What is the matter?
- It hurts

1211
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:24,831

1212
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:27,636
Wife, don't scare me

1213
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:28,468
Alright...

1214
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:29,268
Don't be afraid

1215
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:30,033
What kind of pain is it?

Why does it take so long?

1219
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:41,913
Don't walk or the floor will break

1220
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,854
I am very sad

1221
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:44,814
Why does a father have to stand this?

1222
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:48,025
In hurry...

1223
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,576

He's "Never Die"
