1
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:09,310
<i>They say ignorance is bliss.</i>

2
00:01:10,145 --> 00:01:13,272
<i>For the first time
in my life, I agree.</i>

3
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:15,024
<i>I wish...</i>

4
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:19,153
<i>I had never uncovered
the awful truth.</i>

5
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:21,238
<i>I know now...</i>

6
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:25,201
<i>once they find out,
they will try to silence me.</i>

7
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:30,581
<i>That is why I've written this
all down for you in this letter.</i>

8
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,751
<i>You are the only one
whom I can tell this to.</i>

9
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:38,089
<i>The only one who could
possibly understand.</i>

10
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,842
<i>Good luck, my friend.</i>

11
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:24,552
I hope you enjoyed your stay, Mr. Fuller.

12
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:30,208
Table is ready, right this way

13
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,769
Mr. Fuller, nice having you here.

14
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,896
Your usual table?

15
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,774
No, thanks, Gene.

16
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:42,672
<i># Easy come
Easy go</i>

17
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:46,573
<i># That's the way
If love must have its day</i>

18
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:51,574
<i># Then as it came
Let it go</i>

19
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,875
<i># No remorse
No regret</i>

20
00:02:57,576 --> 00:03:00,776
<i># We should part
Exactly as we met</i>

21
00:03:01,177 --> 00:03:06,877
<i># Just easy come
Easy go</i>

22
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:08,596
Her name is Erika.

23
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,101
She's from Toledo.

24
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:18,647
Ashton, would you do me a favor?

25
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:20,232
You'd like to meet her?

26
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,151
I want you...

27
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,071
to keep this letter.

28
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,033
Somebody will ask for it.
A man named Douglas Hall.

29
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:34,121
Remember, it's crucial
that he receives it.

30
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,374
It's a walk in the park.

31
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,554
Going home, Mr. Fuller?

32
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,389
Yes, Charlie.

33
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:01,339
<i># Just easy come
Easy go</i>

34
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,959
We're out of cat food, honey.

35
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:46,253
Yes, I'll buy some in the morning.

36
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:52,593
You've been smoking again.

37
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:16,575
Download complete.

38
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:19,828
Link to simulation terminated.

39
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,323
Martini, please.

40
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:07,418
One martini.

41
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:09,503
You forgot the olive.

42
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,172
We're out of olives.

43
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:14,091
How about pretzels?

44
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:16,135
No, thank you.

45
00:07:27,772 --> 00:07:30,107
Please leave a message at the tone.

46
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,609
Douglas, it's me.

47
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,989
Listen, I've stumbled
onto something incredible.

48
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:38,699
This changes everything.

49
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:56,425
I don't know....

50
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:00,637
I don't even know how to begin.

51
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,351
What are you doing?

52
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:22,034
<i>You have new messages.</i>

53
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:39,343
<i>You have new messages.</i>

54
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:48,811
<i>You have 3 new messages.</i>

55
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,980
<i>First new message: 5:25 a.m.</i>

56
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,026
<i>Douglas, it's Hilary.
Don't forget to call Marshall.</i>

57
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,320
<i>Legal has been screaming
for the contract for over a month.</i>

58
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,907
<i>I'll have a notary come
to the office at lunch.</i>

59
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:04,785
<i>Next new message: 5:48 a.m.</i>

60
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,249
<i>It's me again.
Please call me as soon as you get up.</i>

61
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:14,169
<i>Next new message: 6:13 a.m.</i>

62
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,090
<i>Mr. Douglas Hall,
this is Detective McBain, LAPD.</i>

63
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,300
<i>I'd appreciate a callback, please.</i>

64
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,012
<i>My phone number is 555-7876.</i>

65
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:41,447
I'm Detective Zev Bernstein.

66
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:44,158
Sorry to drag you
out of bed so early.

67
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:46,910
This is Detective McBain.

68
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:51,957
Mr. Hall?

69
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,834
Thanks for coming down.

70
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:55,294
Where is he?

71
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:58,422
- Can I get you some coffee?
- No, thank you.

72
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,134
That him?

73
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:18,484
We found him in an alley
at Spring and Grand.

74
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:22,821
Yeah, Looks like he ran into some guy
who wasn't just asking for a quarter.

75
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:24,698
Carved him up like a Christmas ham.

76
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:27,284
Took everything:
wallet, credit cards.

77
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,536
Got a kick out of it.

78
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,831
What's your connection
to the old man?

79
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,501
I worked with him for 6 years.

80
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:37,586
He was my boss.

81
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,964
My friend.

82
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:46,136
Hey, cigarette?

83
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,141
I don't smoke.

84
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,269
We found these on him.

85
00:10:55,063 --> 00:10:57,648
Traced the prescription.
According to his doctor...

86
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,652
Fuller listed you as a person to call
in case of any medical emergency.

87
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,654
He had no next of kin?

88
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:05,948
No, he didn't.

89
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,449
You sure?

90
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:09,910
I think he would've told me.

91
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:12,412
Have any idea who killed him?

92
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:15,749
Everybody liked him.

93
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:22,422
Mind if I tag along?

94
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:28,262
Or we can continue in my office,
if that's more convenient.

95
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:30,764
That's fine.

96
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:39,189
What do you do
for a paycheck, anyway?

97
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,774
Computer software.

98
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:43,986
Would you mind taking care
of the car this morning?

99
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,656
- Must make some decent bucks, huh?
- I make a living.

100
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:52,119
- This was his apartment.
- You could be home already.

101
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,332
I see these signs
every time I leave work:

102
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:01,003
"You could be home already.
Apartment living in downtown."

103
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,049
Never expected it could look
anything like this.

104
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,803
This company was Fuller's life.
He worked and lived here.

105
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,307
So what exactly
do you people do here?

106
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:16,977
You wouldn't be interested.

107
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,396
I'm paid to be interested.

108
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,440
Computer research.

109
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,651
Fuller was onto...

110
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:27,779
a whole new frontier.

111
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:30,407
Very sensitive material.

112
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,242
Not at liberty to discuss it.

113
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,371
A lot of money involved.

114
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,791
This apartment must be worth
a few million dollars.

115
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:42,836
One of the perks of the job.

116
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:50,427
This job has a whole lot of perks.

117
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,604
Can I help you?

118
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:16,703
I just talked to him 2 days ago.

119
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:21,166
I can't believe he's gone.

120
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,713
My name is Jane Fuller.

121
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:28,131
Hannon was my father.

122
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:34,179
I'm sorry.
I'm Douglas Hall.

123
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:39,476
You're the one
he always wanted me to meet.

124
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:42,521
He never mentioned
that he had a daughter.

125
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:44,856
He didn't?

126
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:51,321
I arrived from Paris this morning.
I was supposed to meet him.

127
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:53,615
But then I heard.

128
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:55,992
My condolences, Miss Fuller.

129
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:57,994
I'm Detective McBain, LAPD.

130
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:00,414
I have to ask you some questions.

131
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,376
- Of course.
- Would you excuse us, Mr. Hall?

132
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:08,004
Sure.

133
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:16,263
Have we ever met before?

134
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,809
No, that's not possible.

135
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,396
You look very familiar.

136
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:27,232
Nice to meet you, Miss Fuller.

137
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:09,274
Hey, Whitney.
How you doing?

138
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,444
Sliced him up like an animal.

139
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:15,906
And for what?

140
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,952
He was the Einstein of our generation.
It's a waste.

141
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,958
What the hell happened
while I was away?

142
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,255
He was jacking
into the system a lot.

143
00:15:34,217 --> 00:15:36,384
I thought you knew.
You didn't know?

144
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:38,804
We're months away
from the first trial run.

145
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:42,057
We are. You know, he was
taking a big chance.

146
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:45,519
What was I supposed to do?
You know how he is.

147
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,273
Were there complications?

148
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,150
None that I know of yet.

149
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,573
Did he ever tell you
he had a daughter?

150
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:02,452
- Why?
- Because I just met her.

151
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,162
You're kidding me.

152
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:21,680
John, I need the number
of that cab company.

153
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:23,181
No need, sir.

154
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:25,225
She went to the Omni Hotel.

155
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:40,907
Detective McBain.

156
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,368
Sorry to disappoint you.

157
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:44,870
I'll find Doug.

158
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:47,539
Actually it was you I wanted
to have a few words with.

159
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,000
What for?

160
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:52,419
Well you want me to catch the guy
who killed your boss, don't you?

161
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:54,462
Of course.

162
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,425
The whole thing's
a giant computer game?

163
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:02,762
No, it doesn't need a user
to interact with it to function.

164
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:06,558
Its units are fully formed,
self-learning cyber beings.

165
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,686
- Units?
- Electronic, simulated characters.

166
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:12,105
They populate the system.

167
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:13,440
They think...

168
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:14,900
they work...

169
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:16,359
they eat.

170
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:17,861
They fuck?

171
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,407
Let's just say that
they're modeled after us.

172
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:26,953
Right now, we have a working
prototype: Los Angeles, circa 1937.

173
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,622
Why '37?

174
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:33,043
Fuller wanted to start by re-creating
the era of his youth.

175
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,461
You see...

176
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:38,423
while my mind is jacked in...

177
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,470
I'm walking around experiencing 1937.

178
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:45,430
My body stays here...

179
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:49,851
and holds the consciousness
of the program link unit.

180
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,355
You think one of them units
crawled up an extension cord...

181
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:54,940
and killed its maker?

182
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,405
Miss Fuller checked in yet?

183
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,244
Miss Fuller.

184
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:11,790
Glad I caught you.

185
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:13,458
Mr. Hall.

186
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:16,753
What are you doing here?

187
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,589
It's about your father, actually.

188
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,509
You said you spoke with him
a few days ago.

189
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,638
Can you tell me anything
about that conversation?

190
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:30,350
Did he seem strange to you at all?

191
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,981
He'd been under
a lot of stress lately.

192
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,360
He asked me to fly to the States,
so I could help with the company.

193
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:42,195
Help him run it?

194
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:44,948
Shut it down.

195
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:51,871
I worked with him for 6 years.
If he wanted to shut it down...

196
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:54,249
he would've told me about it.

197
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,711
He didn't tell you about me.

198
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:07,303
But I wish he had.

199
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,447
It's nice to see you again.

200
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,200
Sorry I'm late. Have you looked
through the paperwork?

201
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,163
Yes, I have. And I think
we have a very strong case.

202
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,749
The company should be
yours in no time.

203
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,752
- Strong case?
- What I'm saying is, your father...

204
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:41,921
changed his will in favor of the employees.

205
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:45,550
In fact, you aren't mentioned
in the original will either.

206
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:49,179
But as I said, I think
we have a very strong case.

207
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,515
Who will head the board now?

208
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:54,184
Douglas Hall.

209
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:03,318
Not bad.

210
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:06,112
Owner of a $2 billion enterprise.

211
00:20:06,864 --> 00:20:10,366
Strange, Fuller would amend
his will just before he died.

212
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:13,078
I was on an airplane
when it happened.

213
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,374
According to the security guard,
Fuller left the office at 10:30 p.m.

214
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:20,543
30 minutes after your plane arrived.

215
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:26,466
Autopsy shows that
he died around midnight.

216
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,720
- You had time to catch up with him.
- But I didn't.

217
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:36,017
- I went straight home.
- Didn't talk to him?

218
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:39,479
No e-mails, no faxes,
not even a message?

219
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:40,730
None of the above.

220
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,025
You know, that's funny.

221
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:46,903
We checked Fuller's phone records.

222
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:50,448
He made a call with
his calling card at 11:02 p.m.

223
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:54,661
Shit!

224
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,747
Your home number.

225
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:05,296
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
leave town for a couple of days.

226
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:08,633
And get that game fixed.

227
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:10,218
It's missing a spring.

228
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:23,690
You have no new--

229
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:25,942
Restore. Restore.

230
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:30,572
To restore messages,
press "rewind" now.

231
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:34,868
- Yesterday at 2:45 p.m.
- I managed to reschedule--

232
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:39,038
- Yesterday at 5:14 p.m.
- Hello, Mr. Hall--

233
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:43,334
- Yesterday at 11:02 p.m.
- Douglas, it's me.

234
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:46,796
Listen, I've stumbled
onto something incredible.

235
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,506
This changes everything.

236
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:52,427
I'm here in some bar on Main and 7th.

237
00:21:52,636 --> 00:21:56,806
In case something happens to me,
I left you a message in the system.

238
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,683
I gave it to--

239
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:00,977
How did you find me?

240
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:25,585
What's going on?

241
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,130
I'm trying to get
into Fuller's files.

242
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,216
For what?

243
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:34,719
He left a message for me
the night he died.

244
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:40,350
- He knew someone wanted to kill him.
- Did you tell the police?

245
00:22:40,517 --> 00:22:42,143
- No.
- Why not?

246
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:46,022
He also said he left a message
for me in the system.

247
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,983
Douglas, please.
This is my stuff, okay?

248
00:22:56,867 --> 00:23:00,703
These are the units that Fuller
interacted with when he was there.

249
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,123
Maybe he wanted me to go in.

250
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:10,046
If you're thinking what
I think you're thinking...

251
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:12,465
don't even think about it.

252
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:13,675
I need your help.

253
00:23:13,968 --> 00:23:16,219
No, no, no. I won't help you.

254
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,888
- It's a serious risk.
- I have to get in.

255
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:22,308
You could die.

256
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,269
The cops think I killed him.

257
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:29,023
They may be right.

258
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:31,693
- What do you mean?
- Everything points to me.

259
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:38,783
To be perfectly honest,
I don't know what the truth is anymore.

260
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:44,330
Either I did murder Fuller and
I can't remember, or I'm being framed.

261
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,417
The one clue I have is in that machine.

262
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,712
I need your help
if I'm going to find it.

263
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,553
I'll set it for an hour.

264
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,600
Set it for 120 minutes.

265
00:24:04,852 --> 00:24:06,060
60 is better.

266
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,729
120 minutes, Whit.

267
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:10,356
60 is safer. I'm setting it at 60.

268
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,900
1-2-0.

269
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:26,205
<i>120 minutes. Engage timer.</i>

270
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:53,566
Mr. Grierson,
117 West Winston, Pasadena....

271
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:08,414
<i>Transference beginning.</i>

272
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,376
<i>Download complete.</i>

273
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:23,388
--5 cents!

274
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:40,279
You owe me 12 dollars and 5 cents.

275
00:25:42,282 --> 00:25:43,324
Listen, young man!

276
00:25:43,534 --> 00:25:45,076
I do not have all day!

277
00:25:49,623 --> 00:25:51,833
Ferguson, anything wrong?

278
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,752
John, are you okay?

279
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:17,066
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.
Someone will be right with you.

280
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:48,556
Oh, my God.

281
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,614
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. Don't smoke.

282
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:08,159
Since when?

283
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,245
Listen, John...

284
00:27:11,747 --> 00:27:13,581
why don't you....

285
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:16,667
Why don't you break for lunch?

286
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,878
Get some fresh air.

287
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,923
You look terrible.

288
00:27:31,391 --> 00:27:32,850
I think I look pretty good.

289
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:51,953
Extra! Extra!
Zeppelin blast kills 35!

290
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:57,959
You want one, mister?
It's 5 cents.

291
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,801
Hey, watch out, buddy!

292
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:18,479
- How much to Pasadena?
- 90 cents.

293
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:21,983
- If I forget to turn the meter on.
- I understand.

294
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,961
This is it, 117 Winston.

295
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,423
- Do you mind waiting?
- It'll be a pleasure, sir.

296
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,865
- Tell me if you need any help.
- Thank you.

297
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,588
You own this place?

298
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,550
I mean, it's not much...

299
00:29:30,344 --> 00:29:31,636
but it's mine.

300
00:29:39,853 --> 00:29:42,813
You looking for anything
in particular?

301
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:46,108
Interested in a scientist.

302
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:49,403
Wrote a couple of books...

303
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:53,532
about semiconductors...

304
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:56,160
and the limitations
of the 64-bit microchip.

305
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,120
Microchip.

306
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,539
Semiconductors.

307
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:02,583
What year?

308
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:06,253
Early '70s?

309
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:08,339
His name was Hannon Fuller.

310
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,216
Hannon Fuller.

311
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:12,551
1870.

312
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:17,098
No, I can't say I've ever heard of...

313
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:21,644
Hannon Fuller, 1870, microchips.

314
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:26,482
But I'm not much of a
technical person, you know.

315
00:30:30,487 --> 00:30:33,698
You been here before?
You look kind of familiar.

316
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:36,534
Name's Douglas Hall.

317
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:43,833
It doesn't ring a bell.

318
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:48,462
Guess you just have
one of those faces...

319
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:51,090
familiar faces. Oh, it's late.

320
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,843
I'd like to close up now.

321
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:55,845
Of course.

322
00:30:57,723 --> 00:31:00,141
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hall.

323
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:38,179
1257 Palo Alto Road,
La Cienega Heights.

324
00:31:38,388 --> 00:31:40,014
I guess that's it.

325
00:31:44,895 --> 00:31:47,438
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Bridget Manilla.

326
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:49,023
What do you want her for?

327
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:53,861
- I want to ask her some questions.
- She got a job now. I'm her mother.

328
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,071
Can you tell me
where I can find her?

329
00:31:56,323 --> 00:31:58,157
You a copper?

330
00:32:00,494 --> 00:32:01,911
Now, listen.

331
00:32:02,162 --> 00:32:04,705
She ain't doing
nothing wrong no more.

332
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:07,166
If you don't cause her no trouble...

333
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:10,252
you'll find her at Wilshire Grand Hotel.

334
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:07,184
Welcome to the Wilshire Grand Hotel.

335
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:20,990
I'm looking for Bridget Manilla.

336
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:23,784
She's over there,
second from the end.

337
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,125
Bridget?

338
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,963
I got your name from
a good friend of mine.

339
00:33:36,172 --> 00:33:38,424
Come back later.
I'm really busy right now.

340
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:39,717
His name's Fuller.

341
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:44,638
The manager's very tough on us.
You'll have to wait till I'm off duty.

342
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:49,101
I really don't think
I can wait that long.

343
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:52,855
Go talk to Ashton over at the bar.

344
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,652
Bridget, do we have
your attention now?

345
00:33:59,112 --> 00:34:01,113
Thank you. Let's go.

346
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:04,325
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Ashton.

347
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:06,076
Right there.

348
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:08,954
Ashton, some guy wants you.

349
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,666
You're a lucky man.
I just opened.

350
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:18,672
Oh, my. Something wrong?

351
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,135
Bridget just sent me over here.

352
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:25,179
What can I do you for?

353
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,974
You know a gentleman
named Hannon Fuller?

354
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:32,728
Gin martini up, one olive and
likes them frigid as an Eskimo.

355
00:34:33,563 --> 00:34:35,814
- Talk to him recently?
- Why?

356
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:38,651
I'm his friend.
He didn't come home last night...

357
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:42,029
and his wife is concerned.
My name is Douglas Hall.

358
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:50,329
Concerned wives?

359
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,623
I can't help you with that.

360
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:54,708
How about something fancy?

361
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:56,877
So did....

362
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,588
Does Fuller come here frequently?

363
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,090
You could say that.

364
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,341
What does he do?

365
00:35:02,592 --> 00:35:05,594
What everybody does:
drinks, dances, has a good time.

366
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:07,930
Especially has a good time.

367
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,182
He really goes for the girls.

368
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,226
Girls?

369
00:35:13,853 --> 00:35:15,354
Thought you said you knew him.

370
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,023
Yeah, I thought I did.

371
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,361
Are you in a hurry or something?

372
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:26,490
Did you happen to talk to Fuller
the night before last?

373
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:28,450
Yes, I did.

374
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:32,454
Did he mention my name?
Did he give you something for me?

375
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:33,831
What would that be?

376
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,750
- A message or a note, maybe.
- No, sorry.

377
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,378
Did you see him talking
to anybody else?

378
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:41,880
I'm a very busy man.

379
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,222
Listen...

380
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:54,226
if you like, I can arrange
something for you too.

381
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,230
You see anything you want?

382
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:09,783
Can you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

383
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,386
<i>Timer engaged and counting.</i>

384
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:06,131
Douglas Hall! Hey, man!

385
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:08,050
You all right?

386
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:12,346
You sure? All right, take it easy.

387
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,142
Hey, man. Take it easy.

388
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,646
I told you, 120 minutes.

389
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:23,941
It's too long.
You're really pushing your luck.

390
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:27,152
I need something to drink.
Some water.

391
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:32,658
Mr. Hall, you forgot
your coat and hat.

392
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,878
Name's Ferguson.
Johnny Ferguson.

393
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:52,553
Anything wrong?

394
00:37:54,264 --> 00:37:55,430
Didn't finish your drink.

395
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,101
- What happened?
- What happened?

396
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,770
The memory transference
with your link...

397
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,897
it froze. Started overlapping!

398
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,694
Thought I'd be shooting hoops
with Ferguson forever.

399
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:11,029
You got a smoke?

400
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:12,823
Sure.

401
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:14,992
Thank you.

402
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:23,584
Mind if I ask you a question?

403
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,504
Can you tell me where I am?

404
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:32,676
It works?

405
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,429
Oh, it works!

406
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:39,433
It works.

407
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:41,977
How about Ashton?

408
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:45,230
- My bartender?
- He's got a better haircut than you.

409
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,732
Much better.

410
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,485
I wish I could see it for myself.

411
00:38:51,654 --> 00:38:54,239
How's the lighting? Textures?

412
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:58,118
Colorization needs work,
but the units don't notice.

413
00:38:58,286 --> 00:38:59,328
What are they like?

414
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,790
They're as real as you and me.

415
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:08,629
You see, the old man was right!
All those years of work!

416
00:39:09,255 --> 00:39:11,590
Did you find out
what he was doing there?

417
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:14,134
He was having sex with girls.

418
00:39:16,596 --> 00:39:17,763
You're kidding me.

419
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,515
Excuse me, Mr. Hall?

420
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:23,352
A man in the lobby says
he needs to talk to you.

421
00:39:23,686 --> 00:39:26,271
Thanks. Have him call
my office in the morning.

422
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:29,650
He says it's urgent.
That he's a friend of Fuller's.

423
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,627
So, you're a friend of Fuller's.

424
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,338
You're Hall, right?

425
00:39:51,547 --> 00:39:52,839
How can I help you, Mr....

426
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:54,675
Tom Jones.

427
00:39:55,551 --> 00:39:57,177
You know, like the singer.

428
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,473
How about some privacy?

429
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:04,101
What do you want to talk about?

430
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,062
About the night the old man died.

431
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:11,984
I'll be right back, Joe.

432
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,203
So where'd you meet Fuller?

433
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:25,205
In my bar the other night...

434
00:40:25,415 --> 00:40:27,082
waiting for you.

435
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:32,838
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

436
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:37,509
No, I want to talk about money now.

437
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:41,221
- Something in the 7 figures.
- What money?

438
00:40:42,515 --> 00:40:43,890
Come on.

439
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:47,436
You think you can
get away with it?

440
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,812
Get away with what?

441
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:57,446
You took the old man, asshole!

442
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:01,116
Listen to me.
He was at the bar.

443
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:04,661
You pick him up, leave together.
Next day he's an obit.

444
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:06,872
You do the math, asshole!

445
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:16,715
Oh, Jesus!

446
00:41:19,635 --> 00:41:21,845
Crazy son of a bitch!

447
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:25,182
You're nuts.

448
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,061
I'll see you on
America's Most Wanted.

449
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,248
Omni Hotel.
How can I help you?

450
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,626
Miss Jane Fuller, please.

451
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,505
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

452
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:02,969
On the night
your father was killed...

453
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:05,222
he tried to reach me.

454
00:42:05,473 --> 00:42:07,224
He wanted to meet at some bar.

455
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:08,809
What for?

456
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:11,061
He felt someone was after him.

457
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:12,938
Did you talk to him?

458
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:17,150
I know how strange this sounds.

459
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,485
I can't remember.

460
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:20,821
What do you mean?

461
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,867
Did you talk to
the detective about this?

462
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:28,578
No, but the bartender will...

463
00:42:29,455 --> 00:42:31,289
if I don't pay up.

464
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,333
Christ!

465
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,086
I know how crazy this sounds.

466
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:39,297
You can't just plug your brain
into this machine...

467
00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:41,508
and not expect to be affected by it.

468
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:47,389
Please walk away from this
before you get hurt too.

469
00:42:49,475 --> 00:42:51,852
Why do I get the feeling
we've met before?

470
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,773
Maybe we have, in another life.

471
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:00,610
What about Paris?
What's that other life like?

472
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,613
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Why not?

473
00:43:03,865 --> 00:43:07,159
I guess I don't want you
to lose interest in me.

474
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:11,121
Don't worry about that.

475
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:16,042
Let's dance.

476
00:43:16,544 --> 00:43:18,628
- Me? No, no.
- Yes, come on.

477
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:20,964
I buy all my shoes in left pairs.

478
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,717
It's easy. I'll show you the steps.

479
00:43:40,276 --> 00:43:43,695
You're doing pretty good
for a man with no right foot.

480
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,240
Must've picked it up in another life.

481
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,500
<i># Easy come
Easy go</i>

482
00:43:57,793 --> 00:44:01,296
You know that feeling you have
that we met before?

483
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,762
It's the same with me.

484
00:44:09,096 --> 00:44:10,222
Why is that?

485
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:13,683
They say that déjà vu
is usually a sign of...

486
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,603
love at first sight.

487
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,438
Go, go. Ready!

488
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:05,735
Don't make any sudden moves.

489
00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:08,113
What's this all about?

490
00:45:08,322 --> 00:45:10,031
What it's usually all about.

491
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:11,866
Murder.

492
00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:13,577
Is that your car?

493
00:45:13,828 --> 00:45:16,037
- Those are my plates.
- No shit.

494
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:19,207
That's from a security camera
in your office garage...

495
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,210
- the night Fuller was killed.
- I don't understand.

496
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,170
That makes one of us.

497
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:28,592
Fuller wanted to shut down the project,
and you sliced him up.

498
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:30,218
It's time I call my attorney.

499
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:31,595
You say you left at 10.

500
00:45:31,804 --> 00:45:33,888
I was working late with Whitney.

501
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,849
Anybody with you?

502
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:43,898
You're picking up bad habits
left and right.

503
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,986
Must be the stress.

504
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:49,904
Then you'll need a carton.

505
00:45:52,241 --> 00:45:55,201
Name's Tom Jones. Said he saw
your picture in the paper.

506
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:59,623
Said you looked like the guy
Fuller left the bar with that night.

507
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:03,585
We took his statement.
Said we'd be in touch.

508
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,463
Somebody reached out
and touched him first.

509
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:29,819
Looks like you found an alibi.

510
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:40,372
You're free to go...

511
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,207
for now.

512
00:46:48,798 --> 00:46:50,006
What did you tell him?

513
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:51,591
The truth.

514
00:46:51,801 --> 00:46:54,302
We met for a drink,
one thing led to another...

515
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:58,014
we spent the night together.
Your picture was on the news.

516
00:46:58,224 --> 00:47:00,975
He saw you and thought
you were good for quick cash.

517
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,812
You should've seen the pictures.
The guy was slaughtered.

518
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,606
He was an ex-con.
Who knows what else he did!

519
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:10,485
Just because I don't remember it
doesn't mean I didn't do it.

520
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:12,112
You're not a killer.

521
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,031
Your father stumbled onto something.

522
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:17,867
He left me a message
having something to do with this.

523
00:47:18,077 --> 00:47:19,869
So what are you going to do?

524
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,038
Jack back in and find out.

525
00:47:32,091 --> 00:47:34,008
<i>Downloading. Time: 2 hours.</i>

526
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,594
<i>Engage timer.</i>

527
00:47:37,513 --> 00:47:40,140
<i>Timer not engaged. Warning!</i>

<i>Warning.</i>

530
00:47:52,111 --> 00:47:53,695
We're up next!

531
00:48:01,954 --> 00:48:03,747
- Ready? Come on.
- What?!

532
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,127
What's wrong?

533
00:48:09,503 --> 00:48:10,670
Come on, John!

534
00:48:14,216 --> 00:48:15,341
What are you doing?

535
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,472
We're gonna be disqualified!

536
00:48:32,568 --> 00:48:34,986
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot, chief.

537
00:48:51,253 --> 00:48:52,295
Come on!

538
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:55,673
Grierson!

539
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:08,812
I'll call the police!

540
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,814
- I need to talk to you!
- I told you!

541
00:49:11,106 --> 00:49:12,315
I'll call the police!

542
00:49:12,566 --> 00:49:14,067
Listen. Listen!

543
00:49:14,276 --> 00:49:16,736
I know why you pass out
from time to time.

544
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:20,073
I know why you wake up
and have no idea where you are.

545
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:23,201
What'd you do 3 nights ago?
Any idea?

546
00:49:28,123 --> 00:49:29,958
When did it first happen?

547
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,417
First time?

548
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:35,046
About 4 weeks ago.

549
00:49:35,548 --> 00:49:38,007
And the last episode
was 3 nights ago?

550
00:49:38,217 --> 00:49:41,511
It lasts for about 2 hours?

551
00:49:44,473 --> 00:49:47,141
My wife thinks
I have a secret love life.

552
00:49:47,393 --> 00:49:49,435
What about...

553
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:54,607
memory flashes, déjà vu?

554
00:49:54,817 --> 00:49:56,067
I was in World War I.

555
00:49:56,277 --> 00:49:59,487
I'm still having these nightmares.

556
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,364
I'm talking about fantasies.

557
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:07,203
I do have them.

558
00:50:07,746 --> 00:50:11,708
In these fantasies,
you're having sex with young girls.

559
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,465
When I wake up...

560
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:23,636
I even have a perfume smell...

561
00:50:25,264 --> 00:50:27,307
- all over me.
- Real or imagined?

562
00:50:30,102 --> 00:50:32,186
According to my wife...

563
00:50:33,939 --> 00:50:35,648
it's pretty real.

564
00:51:02,843 --> 00:51:04,135
I found this...

565
00:51:04,386 --> 00:51:06,387
a couple of days ago.

566
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:07,639
Your size?

567
00:51:08,223 --> 00:51:11,392
I am married over 35 years now.

568
00:51:13,062 --> 00:51:17,190
And not once have I cheated
on my wife.

569
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:19,943
Not once.

570
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:22,570
Let's have a drink.

571
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:38,928
<i>Warning.
Timer not engaged.</i>

572
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:42,908
<i>Warning.
Timer not engaged.</i>

573
00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:47,000
<i>Warning.
Timer not engaged.</i>

574
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:04,153
You been here before?

575
00:52:06,115 --> 00:52:08,324
I can't afford places like this.

576
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,827
My treat.

577
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:16,916
Good evening, Mr. Fuller.

578
00:52:17,126 --> 00:52:18,418
That's you.

579
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:22,296
Good evening.

580
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:26,718
- Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

581
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:29,846
Members only.

582
00:52:30,055 --> 00:52:33,182
- Mr. Fuller, your usual table?
- Of course.

583
00:52:33,434 --> 00:52:35,435
He's with me.

584
00:52:35,936 --> 00:52:37,937
May I help you with that?

585
00:52:51,326 --> 00:52:54,829
Hi, honey bear.
I'll be with you in 5 minutes.

586
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,716
Let's talk, "honey bear."

587
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:24,025
You remember her?

588
00:53:24,276 --> 00:53:27,320
Of course not.
She's mistaken me for someone else.

589
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:28,613
Your martini.

590
00:53:29,865 --> 00:53:31,407
For someone else.

591
00:53:31,617 --> 00:53:34,619
I want you to look around
and tell me what you remember.

592
00:53:34,828 --> 00:53:36,037
I don't know.

593
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:39,040
I'd rather go home.
I don't feel very well.

594
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:42,710
You have the feeling
you've been here before?

595
00:53:43,712 --> 00:53:45,713
Please try to remember.

596
00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:48,716
Do you recognize anybody?

597
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,134
I'm trying.

598
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,020
Her? What's her name?

599
00:54:04,358 --> 00:54:05,900
I think her name....

600
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:11,114
Erika, I believe.
I believe her name is Erika.

601
00:54:11,323 --> 00:54:12,365
Did you talk to her?

602
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:13,533
I'm not sure.

603
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:19,330
And that one looks familiar too.

604
00:54:22,876 --> 00:54:24,794
Bridget.
Her name's Bridget!

605
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,799
Bridget. Oh, yes.

606
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:34,137
I remember Bridget.

607
00:54:34,388 --> 00:54:36,639
Did you give her
something to give me?

608
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:39,225
Did you give her
a letter or a note?

609
00:54:42,271 --> 00:54:43,938
The man behind the bar....

610
00:54:46,692 --> 00:54:47,817
You're right.

611
00:54:48,026 --> 00:54:51,154
I wrote a letter,
and I gave it to him.

612
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:52,613
To him!

613
00:55:47,252 --> 00:55:49,795
You looking for
anything special?

614
00:55:53,008 --> 00:55:54,050
What are you?

615
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,554
My name's Ferguson.

616
00:55:59,473 --> 00:56:00,514
I'm a bank teller.

617
00:56:00,849 --> 00:56:02,516
I'm Clark Gable.

618
00:56:03,352 --> 00:56:05,478
I talked to the Ferguson guy.

619
00:56:05,687 --> 00:56:06,979
He doesn't know a thing.

620
00:56:07,189 --> 00:56:08,648
I need to talk to Fuller.

621
00:56:09,608 --> 00:56:11,484
- He's upstairs.
- Cut the crap!

622
00:56:11,693 --> 00:56:16,322
You think I don't know what's
going on? I need to talk to him again.

623
00:56:16,531 --> 00:56:17,615
You read the letter.

624
00:56:19,826 --> 00:56:21,494
I need to know what's in it.

625
00:56:22,996 --> 00:56:24,413
Everything.

626
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,875
When I read it,
I thought it was a gag.

627
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:29,919
The world's a sham.
Fat chance!

628
00:56:30,629 --> 00:56:32,672
But I'm not stupid, Mr. Hall.

629
00:56:33,006 --> 00:56:36,759
I watched you and Ferguson
do the old switcheroo.

630
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,845
That stuff about going to
"the ends of the earth."

631
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:41,973
What stuff?

632
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:44,850
I did exactly
what the letter said.

633
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:46,978
I chose a place I'd never go to.

634
00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:49,105
I tried to drive to Tucson.

635
00:56:49,314 --> 00:56:50,898
I figured, what the hell.

636
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:53,401
Never been to the countryside.

637
00:56:53,902 --> 00:56:56,404
And I took that car
out on the highway.

638
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:59,031
I was going over 50
through that desert.

639
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:01,993
After a while,
I was the only car on the road.

640
00:57:02,244 --> 00:57:04,912
It was just me,
the heat and the dust.

641
00:57:05,163 --> 00:57:07,164
I did exactly
what the letter said:

642
00:57:07,374 --> 00:57:11,127
"Don't follow any road signs
and don't stop for anything.

643
00:57:11,336 --> 00:57:13,004
Not even barricades."

644
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:22,221
But just when I should've been
getting closer to the city...

645
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:24,890
something wasn't right.

646
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,393
There was no movement, no life.

647
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:31,230
Everything was still and quiet.

648
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:35,735
And then I got out of the car.

649
00:57:36,611 --> 00:57:38,446
And what I saw...

650
00:57:38,947 --> 00:57:42,992
scared me to the depths...

651
00:57:43,201 --> 00:57:45,119
of my miserable soul.

652
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,706
It was true.
It was all a sham.

653
00:57:48,915 --> 00:57:50,166
It ain't real.

654
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,501
Why would Fuller write about...

655
00:57:52,711 --> 00:57:55,504
the limitations of the simulation?
I know them.

656
00:57:55,756 --> 00:57:57,214
I'm asking the questions!

657
00:57:58,091 --> 00:58:00,051
I wanna know why.

658
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:03,471
Why would you put us through this?

659
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:06,015
Why are you fucking
with our minds?

660
00:58:06,224 --> 00:58:09,060
- You weren't supposed to find out.
- Well, I did.

661
00:58:10,729 --> 00:58:12,897
Now I want you to show me...

662
00:58:13,148 --> 00:58:14,940
what is real.

663
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:19,695
Is this real?

664
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:29,747
Is that real blood?

665
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,629
You like having
your life fucked with?

666
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,514
What the hell's going on?

667
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,100
Come on! Come on!

668
01:00:18,899 --> 01:00:20,691
Where's the letter?

669
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:27,800
Snap out of it!

670
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:47,903
Not gonna hit me again, are you?

671
01:01:53,493 --> 01:01:54,535
Did you yank me back?

672
01:01:54,953 --> 01:01:57,496
Yeah, barely, man.
Just barely.

673
01:01:57,706 --> 01:02:00,416
You didn't start the timer.
It couldn't engage.

674
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,002
What were you doing this
alone for anyway?

675
01:02:03,211 --> 01:02:04,378
He tried to kill me.

676
01:02:04,629 --> 01:02:06,088
- Who?
- Ashton.

677
01:02:06,715 --> 01:02:07,798
Jesus!

678
01:02:08,466 --> 01:02:12,094
He found out his world isn't real.
This is a mistake.

679
01:02:12,846 --> 01:02:15,472
This whole project,
this experiment.

680
01:02:15,682 --> 01:02:17,850
We are screwing with people's lives!

681
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:19,435
Now you're talking crazy.

682
01:02:19,644 --> 01:02:22,438
I know you just had
a bad fucking trip--

683
01:02:22,647 --> 01:02:24,064
"Bad fucking trip"?

684
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:25,691
"Bad fucking trip"?

685
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:30,279
These people are real.
They are as real as you and me.

686
01:02:30,697 --> 01:02:32,156
Yeah, that's because...

687
01:02:32,365 --> 01:02:34,617
we designed them that way.

688
01:02:34,826 --> 01:02:37,995
In the end, they're just
a bunch of electronic circuits.

689
01:02:38,413 --> 01:02:39,496
Here's something else.

690
01:02:39,873 --> 01:02:44,084
I'm shutting this
"bad fucking trip" right down.

691
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:47,713
- I'm telling everybody tomorrow.
- You can't do that.

692
01:02:48,423 --> 01:02:49,465
You can't do that.

693
01:02:49,674 --> 01:02:52,259
You're talking about
6 years of our lives.

694
01:02:52,427 --> 01:02:53,469
All of us.

695
01:02:53,678 --> 01:02:57,306
You can't just pull the plug
and go home!

696
01:03:15,283 --> 01:03:17,326
I'm looking for Jane Fuller.

697
01:03:19,412 --> 01:03:21,121
Sorry, she's no longer with us.

698
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:22,498
The lady vanished.

699
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,919
Any idea where to?

700
01:03:29,798 --> 01:03:30,839
Why would I?

701
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:33,050
Hannon Fuller doesn't have a daughter.

702
01:03:42,769 --> 01:03:45,104
I think I made the age-old mistake:

703
01:03:45,313 --> 01:03:47,773
"Never trust a beautiful woman."

704
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:50,067
Who is she, then?

705
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:51,819
We don't know.

706
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:55,489
It took us a couple of days
to contact the French authorities.

707
01:03:56,282 --> 01:03:57,324
Guess what?

708
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,120
They never heard of her, either.

709
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:20,931
Do you remember me?

710
01:04:22,142 --> 01:04:23,684
Miss Fuller checked out.

711
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:26,729
Did you drive her anywhere?
I'm looking for her.

712
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,273
No can do.
Company rules.

713
01:05:06,352 --> 01:05:09,354
I'm Douglas Hall.
I'm looking for a young woman...

714
01:05:09,564 --> 01:05:11,398
named Jane Fuller.

715
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:14,735
I think you picked the wrong house.

716
01:05:15,028 --> 01:05:18,906
Maybe she's going under
another name. She's about 5'8".

717
01:05:19,532 --> 01:05:20,991
Blonde hair.

718
01:05:21,576 --> 01:05:23,494
What do you want from her?

719
01:05:28,374 --> 01:05:31,043
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Natasha Molinaro.

720
01:05:31,252 --> 01:05:33,295
Over there on register 4.

721
01:05:57,362 --> 01:05:59,404
Here you go. Thank you.

722
01:06:07,288 --> 01:06:08,956
$7.01.

723
01:06:21,302 --> 01:06:23,136
Just slide it through.

724
01:06:35,483 --> 01:06:36,608
You want cash back?

725
01:06:48,663 --> 01:06:51,373
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

726
01:06:55,128 --> 01:06:57,504
Must be déjà vu or something.

727
01:07:00,758 --> 01:07:01,884
Paper or plastic?

728
01:07:02,427 --> 01:07:03,594
Plastic.

729
01:07:07,932 --> 01:07:09,433
There you go.

730
01:07:42,884 --> 01:07:44,134
Mr. Hall!

731
01:07:52,143 --> 01:07:53,936
You forgot your credit card.

732
01:07:58,524 --> 01:07:59,524
Thanks.

733
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,193
No problem.

734
01:08:01,736 --> 01:08:05,656
Sorry about staring at you in there.
You must get that a lot.

735
01:08:07,241 --> 01:08:11,161
Yeah, but mostly from
the wrong kinds of guys.

736
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,291
You're not from here, are you?

737
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,877
What makes you ask?

738
01:08:19,087 --> 01:08:20,170
Well, it's just....

739
01:08:21,255 --> 01:08:24,383
I just had this funny feeling
that we met before.

740
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,304
Maybe in another life.

741
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:36,520
Yeah, I guess that would explain it.

742
01:08:39,691 --> 01:08:43,276
Anyway, I gotta get back
to my daily grind, so....

743
01:08:44,696 --> 01:08:47,030
Maybe I'll see you around sometime.

744
01:10:15,203 --> 01:10:16,578
$7.28.

745
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:23,835
Out of 10. Here's your change.
Thank you very much.

746
01:10:27,507 --> 01:10:28,799
Thank you.

747
01:10:31,969 --> 01:10:33,512
Natasha Molinaro...

748
01:10:33,721 --> 01:10:35,097
27, single.

749
01:10:35,348 --> 01:10:37,682
Changes jobs like
others change underwear.

750
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:42,104
Comes from Austin, Texas.
Made some money modeling.

751
01:10:42,313 --> 01:10:44,064
Left school without a degree.

752
01:10:44,315 --> 01:10:47,984
Her roommate has no idea
what she was doing yesterday.

753
01:10:48,194 --> 01:10:51,279
Looks like Molinaro
doesn't have an alibi.

754
01:10:51,489 --> 01:10:53,115
What else did the roommate say?

755
01:10:53,324 --> 01:10:55,992
Says lately, Natasha
hasn't been feeling well.

756
01:10:56,327 --> 01:10:58,954
She's been having
some sort of amnesia attacks.

757
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:02,374
Going out all night,
sleeping all day.

758
01:11:18,724 --> 01:11:20,475
Thought she was using drugs.

759
01:11:20,685 --> 01:11:22,686
She have a history of drugs?

760
01:11:22,895 --> 01:11:24,312
Nope. She's clean.

761
01:11:26,107 --> 01:11:27,440
Hey, Bernie?

762
01:11:28,192 --> 01:11:30,735
- Good work.
- Thanks, Chief.

763
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,884
Look, I can explain.
I'm sorry.

764
01:11:54,886 --> 01:11:57,262
I need to see you.
Meet me in Fuller's office.

765
01:11:57,471 --> 01:11:59,097
I know the truth.

766
01:12:01,893 --> 01:12:03,476
Where are you?

767
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:07,230
You could call it
the end of the world.

768
01:12:28,961 --> 01:12:32,005
How many simulated worlds
like this are there?

769
01:12:32,215 --> 01:12:33,757
Thousands.

770
01:12:34,091 --> 01:12:38,094
Yours is the only one that ever created
a simulation within the simulation.

771
01:12:38,304 --> 01:12:40,013
Something we never expected.

772
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:42,057
So you had to kill Fuller.

773
01:12:42,308 --> 01:12:44,976
No. I was sent in after his death.

774
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:48,396
I was to pretend to be his daughter,
inherit the company...

775
01:12:48,606 --> 01:12:51,024
and shut it down. But he tricked us.

776
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:53,902
He changed his will.

777
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,446
If you didn't kill Fuller...

778
01:12:57,782 --> 01:12:59,115
who did?

779
01:13:17,802 --> 01:13:19,594
I stabbed him.

780
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:26,059
But it wasn't you.

781
01:13:26,269 --> 01:13:29,396
It was your user.
He downloaded into you.

782
01:13:30,064 --> 01:13:31,648
- Manipulated you.
- Like a puppet.

783
01:13:31,857 --> 01:13:33,441
A puppet doesn't have a soul.

784
01:13:33,651 --> 01:13:35,694
I can't have a soul
any more than Fuller.

785
01:13:35,903 --> 01:13:36,987
But you do.

786
01:13:38,155 --> 01:13:39,823
Fuller did.

787
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:41,992
I never expected that.

788
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:45,495
We programmed this world so no one
in it could learn the truth.

789
01:13:45,705 --> 01:13:48,248
And you and Fuller did.

790
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:51,418
Don't you see what that means?

791
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:56,506
There's just one little flaw
in your thesis.

792
01:14:01,262 --> 01:14:03,138
None of this is real.

793
01:14:05,224 --> 01:14:07,142
You pull the plug...

794
01:14:07,852 --> 01:14:09,436
I disappear.

795
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,730
And nothing I ever say...

796
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,649
nothing I ever do...

797
01:14:15,901 --> 01:14:16,901
will ever matter.

798
01:14:17,445 --> 01:14:19,237
Why don't you find my user?

799
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:23,199
I'm sure he's a much better catch.

800
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:40,216
I told you about my other life.

801
01:14:41,093 --> 01:14:42,677
I was referring to my husband.

802
01:14:44,972 --> 01:14:46,765
He's your user.

803
01:14:48,476 --> 01:14:50,143
He killed Fuller.

804
01:14:51,562 --> 01:14:53,646
I'm his program link.

805
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:00,612
A reflection
of his character profile.

806
01:15:00,821 --> 01:15:03,031
I fell in love with a decent man.

807
01:15:05,409 --> 01:15:08,661
But he--
Something happened to him.

808
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:14,417
He began to use the simulation
as his own personal playground.

809
01:15:14,668 --> 01:15:16,252
Like Fuller with the girls.

810
01:15:17,088 --> 01:15:20,965
He made himself a god,
and it corrupted him.

811
01:15:22,259 --> 01:15:24,928
He began to enjoy the killings.

812
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:28,264
- He became abusive.
- What do you mean?

813
01:15:28,766 --> 01:15:30,642
He said he would kill me.

814
01:15:34,814 --> 01:15:36,398
Why?

815
01:15:37,483 --> 01:15:39,359
I fell in love with you.

816
01:15:43,155 --> 01:15:44,280
You don't even know me.

817
01:15:45,825 --> 01:15:47,200
Yes, I do.

818
01:15:50,371 --> 01:15:54,624
From the moment the simulation
was created, I've watched you.

819
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:57,502
Your kindness...

820
01:15:59,004 --> 01:16:00,505
your integrity.

821
01:16:03,551 --> 01:16:06,553
I fell in love with you
before I even met you.

822
01:16:07,555 --> 01:16:09,305
How can you love me?

823
01:16:14,395 --> 01:16:16,438
I'm not even real.

824
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:20,817
You can't fall in love with a dream.

825
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,954
You're more real to me than
anything I've ever known.

826
01:16:52,099 --> 01:16:54,350
Preparing user for download...

827
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,436
into simulation.

828
01:16:56,896 --> 01:16:59,606
Program link ready for download.

829
01:17:00,441 --> 01:17:01,941
Transference beginning.

830
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:03,485
Download complete.

831
01:17:12,077 --> 01:17:13,119
Shit!

832
01:17:36,977 --> 01:17:38,102
Shit!

833
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:48,112
Oh, wow!

834
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:04,879
Nice driving.

835
01:18:08,842 --> 01:18:11,344
There was something in the road...

836
01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:15,056
and I had to swerve and I lost control.

837
01:18:15,808 --> 01:18:17,183
You drunk?

838
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:18,851
I don't drink.

839
01:18:19,353 --> 01:18:20,687
License and registration.

840
01:18:24,483 --> 01:18:27,986
Look, I didn't jack in--
I left it at home.

841
01:18:29,154 --> 01:18:31,364
Why don't you look in the glove box?

842
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:41,958
Need a light?

843
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:43,876
Hey, I got it.

844
01:18:44,253 --> 01:18:45,587
Here you go.

845
01:18:55,014 --> 01:18:56,973
You ought to get this car looked at.

846
01:18:57,182 --> 01:18:59,726
It's leaking oil.
That could be dangerous.

847
01:19:00,394 --> 01:19:02,437
Be a little more careful, huh?

848
01:19:15,743 --> 01:19:19,078
You want to turn off the car
and step out, please?

849
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:21,789
Turn off the car, sir.
Right now, please.

850
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:37,263
Open the trunk, please, sir.

851
01:19:48,901 --> 01:19:51,235
Hands in the air.
Step away from the trunk.

852
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:53,571
Shit, man, it's Douglas!

853
01:19:53,781 --> 01:19:54,989
Back up!

854
01:19:55,658 --> 01:19:57,283
I said, back the hell up!

855
01:19:57,534 --> 01:19:58,701
Hey, this is a joke!

856
01:19:59,578 --> 01:20:01,204
Watch out!

857
01:21:34,506 --> 01:21:36,466
Sorry to bother you...

858
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,969
but Mr. Whitney's in the building...

859
01:21:40,179 --> 01:21:42,346
and he's acting kind of strange.

860
01:21:42,556 --> 01:21:44,599
I'll be right down.

861
01:22:10,751 --> 01:22:13,085
Los Angeles Police Department.

862
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,129
This is Jane Fuller.

863
01:22:16,048 --> 01:22:18,674
I need to speak
with Detective McBain.

864
01:22:21,553 --> 01:22:23,888
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

865
01:22:24,181 --> 01:22:26,057
Or should I say, "Miss Molinaro"?

866
01:23:08,267 --> 01:23:09,350
How you doing?

867
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:12,270
All these pictures,
this is your world?

868
01:23:20,445 --> 01:23:21,612
Ashton.

869
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:28,828
I never imagined
it could be so beautiful.

870
01:23:28,996 --> 01:23:30,037
How'd you do it?

871
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:34,625
Last thing I remember,
I was dumping Ferguson in the trunk.

872
01:23:36,628 --> 01:23:38,421
Son of a bitch!

873
01:23:40,507 --> 01:23:41,883
He did it.

874
01:23:43,135 --> 01:23:44,802
He jacked in.

875
01:23:46,346 --> 01:23:47,930
Who's Jack?

876
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:59,400
What'd you do to the world?

877
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:03,404
- Turned it off.
- Well, put it back!

878
01:24:07,618 --> 01:24:08,659
Don't do that!

879
01:24:09,995 --> 01:24:12,538
Put it back! What did I do?

880
01:24:16,126 --> 01:24:19,462
Where are you?

881
01:24:30,933 --> 01:24:31,974
Look at this.

882
01:24:32,601 --> 01:24:35,353
You are really a god.

883
01:24:35,729 --> 01:24:39,023
No, Ashton, I'm not really a god.

884
01:24:40,317 --> 01:24:42,151
I'm just like you.

885
01:24:45,322 --> 01:24:46,781
Just a bunch of electricity.

886
01:24:47,032 --> 01:24:49,241
What are you talking about?

887
01:24:52,663 --> 01:24:54,080
It's all smoke and mirrors.

888
01:24:54,748 --> 01:24:56,958
Just like your world.

889
01:24:57,668 --> 01:25:00,670
We're nothing but a simulation
on some computer.

890
01:25:01,964 --> 01:25:03,631
It's like a machine.

891
01:25:04,549 --> 01:25:06,175
Like this arcade game.

892
01:25:06,426 --> 01:25:09,470
You've got your players
and you put your nickel in.

893
01:25:10,514 --> 01:25:11,806
This one pitches...

894
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,101
this one runs around the bases.

895
01:25:15,978 --> 01:25:17,687
You got a bat, you got a ball.

896
01:25:17,896 --> 01:25:19,772
They play, they score.

897
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:23,609
Preprogrammed movements
generated by electrical energy.

898
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:26,237
We've improved
on this model since then.

899
01:25:26,655 --> 01:25:29,156
Now the players can beat
the shit out of...

900
01:25:29,366 --> 01:25:32,618
and try to drown one another,
which is always fun.

901
01:25:33,286 --> 01:25:34,912
But the letter said--

902
01:25:35,122 --> 01:25:38,457
Everything was fake?
The letter was meant for me.

903
01:25:38,959 --> 01:25:40,626
Fuller was talking about my world.

904
01:25:42,921 --> 01:25:44,714
So what are you saying?

905
01:25:45,298 --> 01:25:49,301
You're saying there's another world
on top of this one?

906
01:25:49,886 --> 01:25:51,220
That's right.

907
01:25:54,725 --> 01:25:57,560
- I don't understand.
- Fuller found out about it.

908
01:25:57,936 --> 01:25:58,978
They killed him.

909
01:26:00,647 --> 01:26:02,231
Why didn't they kill you?

910
01:26:02,858 --> 01:26:04,525
Maybe they will.

911
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:07,778
Maybe that's why
you're pointing a gun at me.

912
01:26:08,572 --> 01:26:10,364
I'm sorry, Ashton.

913
01:26:11,074 --> 01:26:12,283
We're stuck here.

914
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:14,326
You and me...

915
01:26:15,746 --> 01:26:17,246
and the rest of us.

916
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,251
I want to see it.

917
01:26:23,503 --> 01:26:25,296
- See what?
- My arcade game.

918
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,332
It's breathing.

919
01:27:53,593 --> 01:27:56,095
So this is where I was born.

920
01:28:14,197 --> 01:28:16,323
And this is where you die.

921
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,043
What are you doing?

922
01:28:28,295 --> 01:28:29,670
Watching you dream.

923
01:28:34,259 --> 01:28:36,343
How much longer do you have?

924
01:28:38,805 --> 01:28:40,306
10 minutes.

925
01:28:50,817 --> 01:28:53,485
Hi, honey, I'm home.

926
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:55,946
Did you miss me?

927
01:28:59,784 --> 01:29:00,826
David.

928
01:29:05,123 --> 01:29:06,457
When did you download?

929
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:08,709
Obviously, not soon enough.

930
01:29:09,294 --> 01:29:10,586
I was just doing my job.

931
01:29:11,463 --> 01:29:12,504
Sure you were.

932
01:29:14,507 --> 01:29:16,592
He's shutting down
the system, isn't he?

933
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,725
Aside from his devilish good looks...

934
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:28,270
what's so special about this guy?

935
01:29:31,149 --> 01:29:32,733
He reminds me of you.

936
01:29:33,235 --> 01:29:35,778
- The way you used to be.
- I'm still the same.

937
01:29:36,029 --> 01:29:37,446
No, you're not.

938
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,617
Why did you butcher those people?

939
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,872
Because it was fun.

940
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:50,376
You've lost your mind.

941
01:29:56,716 --> 01:29:59,134
You're the one who's fucking sick!

942
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:02,304
Falling in love
with a fucking simulation.

943
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,598
I was just having some fun.

944
01:30:04,808 --> 01:30:06,225
Just like you did.

945
01:30:06,685 --> 01:30:10,729
I think you're lying.
Just remember, he's a part of me.

946
01:30:10,897 --> 01:30:11,981
That's not true.

947
01:30:14,859 --> 01:30:16,193
It's okay.

948
01:30:18,613 --> 01:30:20,906
Just pretend you're fucking him.

949
01:32:01,132 --> 01:32:02,174
Why?

950
01:32:03,385 --> 01:32:05,052
I guess I'm just jealous.

951
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:36,333
You okay?

952
01:32:36,543 --> 01:32:38,669
What the hell took you so long?

953
01:32:56,563 --> 01:32:58,605
How'd you know he'd try to kill you?

954
01:33:00,024 --> 01:33:02,651
I knew when he was
planning to download.

955
01:33:05,822 --> 01:33:06,905
He's dead?

956
01:33:07,323 --> 01:33:08,866
A bullet will do that to you.

957
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:25,382
So, is somebody gonna
unplug me now?

958
01:33:30,472 --> 01:33:32,473
Do me a favor, will you?

959
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:35,559
When you get back to
wherever you come from...

960
01:33:35,768 --> 01:33:38,353
just leave us alone
down here, okay?

961
01:34:49,884 --> 01:34:52,886
"June 21st, 2024."

962
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:39,474
Where am I?

963
01:35:42,687 --> 01:35:44,605
Come, I'll show you.

964
01:36:18,473 --> 01:36:21,391
Jane, we're getting hungry!

965
01:36:21,851 --> 01:36:24,728
Tell Virginia we're waiting for lunch.

966
01:36:31,402 --> 01:36:32,444
My father.

967
01:36:32,945 --> 01:36:34,488
Fuller was modeled after him.

968
01:36:43,998 --> 01:36:46,998
There's so many things
I have to tell you about, Doug.
