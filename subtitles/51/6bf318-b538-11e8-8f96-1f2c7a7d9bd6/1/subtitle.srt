I found it in the mailbox
this morning.

14
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,278
May I ask you who you'd like
on duty this weekend?

15
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,573
Um, actually, why don't
you give everybody
the weekend off?

16
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:04,866
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah.

17
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,659
We might go to
the beach house and, uh,

18
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,036
if not, it might be nice
to have a weekend alone.

19
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,081
I'll let everyone know.
Thank you.

20
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,128
Oh, damn it.

21
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,213
Christopher?
CHRISTOPHER: Yes?

22
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:22,466
I'm sorry. Can you
help me open this?
I just got a paper cut.

23
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:24,677
Yeah, of course.
Here, let me do it.
Thank you.

24
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,346
Yeah, yeah.
I just... A paper cut.

25
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:34,312
There's a note.
You can read it.

Good morning.

What's that?
It's a manuscript
Edward sent me.

39
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,693
He wrote a novel.

40
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,737
Edward who?

41
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,448
Edward, my first husband.
You remember him.

42
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,450
I didn't know he could write.

43
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,786
Yes, you did.
He was writing a novel
when you and I got together.

44
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,329
You just don't remember.

45
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,748
Have you guys even talked
in 20 years?

46
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,500
19.

47
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:43,130
No. I tried calling him
a couple of years back,
but he hung up on me.

48
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,258
I think he's teaching English
at some prep school in Dallas.

49
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:48,386
It's sad, really.
He never remarried.

50
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:52,890
Where were you
last night? You didn't
come by the gallery.

51
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,477
I'm sorry. Really, I...

52
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,646
By the time I left
the office, I was late
for my dinner and...

53
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,606
It would have
taken you 15 minutes.

54
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,234
Fifteen minutes, and it would
have meant a lot to me.

55
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,696
Never mind.

56
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,908
You didn't come
to bed last night.
I didn't wanna wake you.

57
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,452
Yeah.

58
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:18,082
Well, I wasn't asleep.
I was too wound up
from the opening.

59
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,712
It went well, by the way.
Apparently.

60
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,380
Good.
Yeah.

61
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,803
Look, why don't you and I
go to the beach?

62
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,597
We can go tonight
and come back on Monday.

63
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,269
Maybe if we
just spent some time,
just the two of us?

64
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:46,110
Why are you wearing
this blazer on a Saturday?

65
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:49,530
Because I gotta
go back to the office,

66
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,867
and then I gotta go
to the airport, and then
I gotta go back to New York.

67
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,244
You just came from there.
Yes, I know.

68
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,247
But I have to go again
if I wanna get this deal done,

69
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,583
and I don't wanna have to sell
anything else.

70
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,460
Shit.
It's okay.

71
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,549
You know,
the strange thing is is,

72
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,469
I don't really care
about all this art.

73
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:17,183
That doesn't sound like you.
I know, but it's true.

74
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,810
I care.

75
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,979
It pisses me off.

76
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,523
I know you do.

77
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,235
Don't worry,
I can fill the walls
with some new LA artists

78
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,739
and people will think
we're ahead of the curve
instead of going broke.

to be embarrassed.

I'm surprised. I thought
we were hiding it pretty well.

Did you call my
psychopharmacologist?
Did you call him?

88
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,652
You should call him,
because he's a genius.

89
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,239
I'm worried
about you, seriously.

90

Just look at me for a second.
Look at me.

91
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,578

that I told you
all of those things.

95
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,339
I'm just kind of
embarrassed, you know.

96
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:35,469
Because what right
do I have to not be happy?
I have everything.

97
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,429
I feel ungrateful
not to be happy.

98
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,599
As much right
as anyone, Susan,
as much right as anyone,

99
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,393
because it's all relative.

100
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:49,608
You're just awfully hard
on yourself.

101
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,944
How do you do it?

102
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,866
You mean with Carlos?
I just... It's...
I'm totally cool with it.

103
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:00,703
And having a gay husband
is not such a bad thing,
you know?

104
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:06,333
We're best friends.
We love each other completely.

105
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,794
I'm certainly
the only woman in his life.

106
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:11,672
And that lasts
longer than lust, doesn't it?

107
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,757
It's forever, really.

108

He made you drive.

500
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:03,337
And then when you
started to walk out,
you saw 'em coming in again.

501
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,423
Yes.
Hmm. Whose car were they in?

502
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,175
I think itwas mine.

503
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:11,095
You think?
What makes you think that?

504
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:14,181
By the look of it
and the sound of it.
It sounded like my oar.

505
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,016
Could you see 'em in the dark?

506
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,855
Not very well.
Did they say anything?

507
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:24,692
They said,
"Mister, your wife wants you."

508
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:30,406
You didn't go to 'em.
Why didn't you go to 'em?

509
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:35,828
I don't know
why I didn't go. I was...

Okay.

Can you take it from here?

512
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:54,638
Yeah, I came down the highway
and I walked for a long time,

513
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,932

518
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,086
Right by the reflector.
I remember that.

You said you walked out,
right?

I came up right here,

I don't believe that.

Why'd you give up
on becoming an artist?

627
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:48,570
Because I'm too cynical
to be an artist.

really, really good,

from someplace inside

670

all over the place.

671

separate 'em out.

to convince me that I had
to marry Bass.

689

That is different.

690
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:36,715
Bass is your equal.

691
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:40,093
Oh, my God.
Did you just say that?
You really just said that.

692
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:42,387
That came out
of your mouth.
Thafsu.

693
00:53:44,723 --> 00:53:46,808
Why do you always think
the worst of me?

694
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,020
That is not what I meant.

695
00:53:52,105 --> 00:53:57,485
What I meant
is that you are very
strong-willed,

696
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:59,946
and Edward,
as sweet as he is,
he's too weak for you.

697
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,408
Weak is not a word
that I would use
to describe Edward.

698
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,577
Sensitive is a word
that I would use,

699
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,872
which isn't a word I would use
to describe anyone else
in this family,

700

701

into this.

are gonna be
very important to you,

708
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,517
and Edward's not gonna be able
to give them to you.

709
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:32,937
He has no money.

710
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:37,442
He's not driven.
He's not ambitious.

711

And I can promise you,
if you marry Edward,

712
00:54:40,612 --> 00:54:42,405
your father's not gonna
give them to you either.

713
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,533
No, you're right.
He's not driven

would like him to be.

715
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:49,871

in a lot of ways.

"A different kind
of strength."

719

And what kind
of strength is that?

720
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:04,761

to believe in himself

721

in the end.

before in my life.

838
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,387
What you gonna tell me
about Ray and Turk?

839
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:46,514
Who?
Who?

840
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:51,936
What, are you an owl?
You an owl, Lou?

841
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:54,855
I never heard of 'em.
You never heard of 'em?

842
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,691
No, sir.

01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:04,198

849

Are you sure
this is the man?
Absolutely, yes.

850
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,513
You'll swear in a court of law
under penalty of perjury?

851
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:28,597
Yes.

852
01:03:34,437 --> 01:03:35,521
Good.

853
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,234
Well, we got Lou.

854
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:42,945
I'm gonna charge him
with murder.

enough evidence?

856

Oh, you bet,
between you and the prints
in the car and the trailer.

857
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:49,785
What, he went back
to the trailer
after he left me?

858
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:53,205
Yeah, looks like it.
Uh, he probably just went back
to tell 'em where you were.

859
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:55,708
That's why they came back
with the bodies.

860

they were gonna kill you.

01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,674
I bet your friend Ray's
the third fella
in the hold-up.

863
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:08,429
What HOW?
Well, you're gonna
wait for trial.

864
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:13,434
And I'm gonna go find Ray.

a board meeting
at the museum at 3:00.

I'm sorry. What was that?

867
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:33,371
You didn't sleep again,
did you?

868
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,960
You know me.
I never sleep.

869
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:44,757
My ex-husband
used to call me
a nocturnal animal.

870
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,133
What ex-husband?

871
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:49,512
I didn't know
you had an ex-husband.
Since when?

872
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:51,639
A couple of years
in graduate school.

873
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:55,851
It's weird,
I've been thinking
about him a lot lately,

874
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:58,270
and then recently
he sent me this book
that he's written

875
01:04:58,354 --> 01:04:59,355
and it's

876
01:05:00,815 --> 01:05:02,149
violent and it's sad,

877
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:05,611
and he entitled it
Nocturnal Animals
and he dedicated it to me.

878
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:08,489
Did you love him?

879
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:09,907
Yeah, I loved him.

880
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:15,204
He was a writer and, uh,
I didn't have faith in him.

881
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:18,707
I panicked
and I did something
horrible to him.

882
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,960
Something unforgivable,
really.

883
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:24,130
You left him?
I left him.

884
01:05:25,673 --> 01:05:28,217
I left him in a brutal way,

885
01:05:29,427 --> 01:05:31,887
for the handsome
and dashing Hutton.

886
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:34,432

and dashing.
...and dashing. Yes.

No.

Of course not.
You just started

to be when we hired her.

(CLAPS HANDS)
Give me some questions.
I'll answer your questions.

1006
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:36,705
I don't know any more
about this hold-up
than I did before I met you.

1007
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:37,748
(EXHALES)
I tell you what,

1008
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:38,957
I'm gonna ask you
a different question.

1009
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:42,002
You recognize this car?
(SIGHS) What car?

1010
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:44,338
This one. The one
we're driving around in.

1011
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:46,340
Why should I recognize
this fucking car?

1012
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:47,549
It ain't familiar to you?

1013
01:13:47,633 --> 01:13:49,343
It don't remind you
of nothing,
take you back?

1014
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:51,637
Why should it?
You don't remember driving it?

1015
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,514
I think I'd know.
Yeah. How about the driver?

1016
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:56,141
What?
This fella?

1017
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:59,186
This fella sitting behind
the steering wheel.
My friend Tony?

1018
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:00,354
You remember him?

1019
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:06,360
I can't see him.
Make him turn around.

1020
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:08,528
ANDES: Stop the car, Tony.

1021
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:15,327
ANDES: Turn around and look
at this piece of shit.

1022
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:20,707
Who is this guy?
You don't remember him?

1023
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:25,003
Can't say I do.
You remember him, Tony?

1024
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:27,673
Yes.
Well, refresh his memory.

1025
01:14:27,756 --> 01:14:29,132
Last summer on the interstate.

1026
01:14:29,216 --> 01:14:31,009
Tell him what you
remember he did.

1027
01:14:31,385 --> 01:14:32,719
You killed my wife
and my daughter.

1028
01:14:33,387 --> 01:14:34,972
That's crazy.
I never killed nobody.

1029
01:14:35,806 --> 01:14:37,933
ANDESI
Tell him the whole thing.
Mmm-mmm.

1030
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:40,686
You and your buddies
on the interstate,
you foroed us off the road.

1031
01:14:40,769 --> 01:14:42,771
ANDES:
Tell him who his buddies are.
Lou and Turk.

1032
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:43,814
You remember that, Ray?

1033
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:45,857
You remember horsing around
on the interstate
with your buddies,

1034
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:47,401
playing chicken
with the other cars?

1035
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:49,778
You're crazy. That's crazy.

1036
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:52,864
TONY: You made us stop
and we had a flat tire
and Lou and Turk fixed it.

1037
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:55,075
Then you and Turk
got in my car
with my wife and my daughter

1038
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:57,786
and you forced me
in your oar with Lou.
ANDESI What then, Tony?

1039
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,414
Lou took me out into the brush
and kicked me out.

1040
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,417
And you came back in my car

1041
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,669
and you called out for me,
trying to lure me
into your trap.

1042
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:07,629
You came back
where Lou had left me

1043
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:10,173
ANDES: Oh, is that why
you went back there, Ray?

1044
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:16,179
(SCOFFS)

1045
01:15:17,973 --> 01:15:20,600
You're fucking crazy!
Tell him what
we found there, Tony.

1046
01:15:21,852 --> 01:15:24,521
TCDNYI YOU tell him.
Do I have to?
Don't you know, Ray?

1047
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:29,818
Y'all are crazy. It's crazy.

1048
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:32,279
TONY: The bodies
of my wife and child

1049
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:37,159
which you took
back there and dumped.

1050
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:42,122
You're the one. I know you.

1051
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:44,082
What do you say, Ray?

1052
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:47,335
You're crazy.
You're making
a big mistake.

1053
01:15:47,419 --> 01:15:49,504
ANDES: Mmm.
I don't think so.

1054
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:53,800
I don't think so, Ray.
Put your hands out
in front of you.

1055
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:55,802
You got no right.
Got no right?

1056
01:15:56,261 --> 01:15:58,847
Rights, rights, rights.
You and your goddamn rights.

1057
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:00,474
Speaking of rights,
I just wanna let you know

1058
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:02,601
I'm recording
this entire conversation.

1059
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:05,228
There. You clear?

1060
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:07,189
Mmm-hmm.
All right, let's go, Tony.

1061
01:16:10,776 --> 01:16:12,903
ANDES: Now, we're going
to a place you might remember,

1062
01:16:12,986 --> 01:16:15,697
and you can help yourself out
by telling me about it.

1063
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:17,574
But if you don't remember,

1064
01:16:17,657 --> 01:16:20,077
Tony does, all right?

1065
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:22,204
RAY: Hey, I'm sorry
you lost your folks, man.

1066
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:25,832
It's a shame.
But I didn't have
nothin' to do with it.

1067
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:47,395
What's this place?
You know this place.

1068
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:49,773
Honest to God, I don't.
You wanna get out, Tony?

1069
01:16:49,856 --> 01:16:51,608
ANDES: Shall we have
a look inside, Ray?
RAY: What for?

1070
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:53,026
ANDES: Come on,
let's take a look.

1071
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,751
All right,
all right.

1072
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:16,925
Oh, you raped them
on the bed, I suppose.

1073
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:18,927
I never raped nobody.
Stop fucking around, Ray.

1074
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,096
We seen your record.
We know about
that girl in Lubbock.

1075
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:23,807
The charges were dropped.
I never raped nobody.

1076
01:17:24,057 --> 01:17:25,058
I wanna know, Ray.

1077
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:29,146
I wanna know the exact story,
what you did to them.

1078
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:34,109
You'll have to ask
somebody else.
I wanna know what they said.

1079
01:17:37,112 --> 01:17:38,613
I wanna know what my wife said

1080
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:40,282
and I wanna know
what my daughter said.

1081
01:17:50,876 --> 01:17:52,294
I wanna know
how you killed them.

1082
01:17:53,545 --> 01:17:55,881
And I wanna know if they knew
it was happening to them.

1083
01:17:55,964 --> 01:17:57,465
I wanna know what they felt!

1084
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:02,888
I wanna know if they hurt.

1085
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:07,934
Answer me!

1086
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:10,979
Answer me!

1087
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:16,443
Answer me,
you fucking bastard!

1088
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:17,611
(GRUNTS)

1089
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:35,545
Is it better?

1090
01:18:37,047 --> 01:18:39,132
You're gonna take this
the wrong way, but, um,

1091
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:42,719
I think that you
should write about something
other than yourself.

1092
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:44,971
(CHUCKLES)

1093
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,267
Nobody writes about anything
but themselves.

1094
01:18:49,351 --> 01:18:51,144
I just, my mind started
to wander when
I was reading it,

1095
01:18:51,269 --> 01:18:53,313
and that's not good, right?

1096
01:18:53,647 --> 01:18:54,648
I don't know what to do.
Maybe, you know,

1097
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,107
maybe I don't have
a book in me.

1098
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:59,027
Maybe give yourself
some space.
Just do something else.

1099
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,070
Can you not do that?
What?

1100
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:01,988
Becauseitu
That makes me feel like
you don't believe in me.

1101
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:05,075
Edward,
that's not what I said.
No, you didn't say that.

1102
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:06,243
But you're saying it
with your face

1103
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:07,494
and you're saying it
when you sigh.

1104
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:10,413
Whatever, you're saying it
when you say you want me
to go baok to sohool.

1105
01:19:10,497 --> 01:19:12,040
Well, yeah, I do want you
to go back to school.

1106
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:13,083
I don't see
what's wrong with that.

1107
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:14,626
I mean,
I'm just being a realist.

1108
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:17,587
I mean, you're gonna
work at a book store
and just write a novel,

1109
01:19:17,671 --> 01:19:19,965
like that's what
you wanna do
with your life?

1110
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:26,096
I mean,
that's really romantic, but,
like, what? This is it?

1111
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:28,306
This is it? This is what...
You sound like your mother.

1112
01:19:31,226 --> 01:19:34,521
Well, you always said
that I reminded you
so much of her, so...

1113
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,440
You know, this is exactly why
I don't wanna read your work

1114
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:39,317
because you always get
so fucking defensive.

1115
01:19:39,401 --> 01:19:40,819
Yeah, of course I'm defensive!

1116
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:44,239
Do you know what it feels like
to put yourself out
on the line creatively

1117
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:47,701
and then have someone
you love tell you that
they don't understand it?

1118
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,619
No, I don't,
because I'm not creative...

1119
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:51,121
EDWARD: That's because
you choose not to be.

1120
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:57,168
I don't wanna fight.
I'm tired and I'm edgy.

1121
01:19:57,252 --> 01:20:00,672
I've been writing all night.
I just wanted you to like it,
all right?

1122
01:20:09,097 --> 01:20:10,098
Thanks.

1123
01:20:21,026 --> 01:20:22,986
<i>ANDES: I got some news
you're not gonna like.</i>

1124
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,947
They're letting Ray Marcus go.

1125
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:27,824
TONY: <i>What? What do you mean,
they're letting him go?</i>

1126
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:31,286
The D.A. says we don't have
enough hard evidence,

1127
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:32,954
what we have
is circumstantial.

1128
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:35,415
He needs corroboration.

1129
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:37,500
(TONY SCOFFS)

1130
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:40,420
I'm real sorry, Tony.

1131
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:43,465
It's a goddamn shame.

1132
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:47,010
At least you got to lay
a good belt on him.

1133
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:50,013
<i>No, that's not enough.
What else can we do?</i>

1134
01:20:51,765 --> 01:20:53,016
I can think of something.

1135
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:55,810
You'd better get
here quick, though.

1136
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:57,479
He ain't gonna
stick around for long.

1137
01:20:58,438 --> 01:20:59,898
<i>Okay, all right,
I'm leaving now.</i>

1138
01:21:03,777 --> 01:21:04,778
What?

1139
01:21:06,196 --> 01:21:09,741
I told you,
I got lung cancer.
It's metastasized.

1140
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:13,995
But you smoke all the time.
Yeah, well,
that's how it works.

1141
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:17,207
What's the point
in quitting now?
I'll be dead in a year.

1142
01:21:17,374 --> 01:21:19,209
(SIGHS)
It's this fella named Jenks.

1143
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:21,211
He's the lawyer
the court appointed for Ray.

1144
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:23,129
He's a little smartass
from Dallas.

1145
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:26,716
He and the D.A. made a deal
and Ray got off. Politics.

1146
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,301
When did you tell me
you were sick?

1147
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:30,804
See, they're trying
to force me out.

1148
01:21:31,096 --> 01:21:33,515
They already got another fella
lined up for the job.

1149
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:34,724
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1150
01:21:34,808 --> 01:21:36,393
They'd drop a murder case
to do that?

1151
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:40,188
Oh, yeah.
Give 'em the reason,
ammunition.

1152
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:44,901
They said my case
wasn't well-prepared,
was a sloppyjob, slapdash,

1153
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:47,654
no evidence and evidence
improperly gathered,

1154
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:49,322
won't stand up in court.

1155
01:21:51,324 --> 01:21:54,828
The D.A.'s too much
of a chickenshit
to take a case he might lose.

1156
01:21:58,748 --> 01:21:59,999
They're not dropping Lou.

1157
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:05,255
Well, it's no fucking good
if we don't get Ray.

1158
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,091
Good.

1159
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:10,552
That's what I was
hoping you'd say.

1160
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:16,224
They want me to retire
and enjoy the benefits
of my cancer somewhere else.

1161
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,685
Fuckthat
Y%n1neverkMdrne
about the cancer.

1162
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:20,645
The problem with Ray
is his alibi.

1163
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:21,980
You have a family?

1164
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,315
Ray claims he was with
that little...
Bobby.Bobby.

1165
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:26,025
What?

1166
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:29,237
Do you have anyone
in your life?

1167
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:38,204
No. No wife or...

1168
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,084
I have a daughter in Corpus.

1169
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:48,631
Has she been a help?

1170
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:55,013
She doesn't know.
What can she do about it?

1171
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:02,228
Anyway, Ray claims

1172
01:23:02,312 --> 01:23:05,023
he was with that little girl,
Leila whatever her name is

1173
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:06,816
and she backs him up.

1174
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,151
Her aunt backs her up.

1175
01:23:08,902 --> 01:23:09,903
What are we gonna do?

1176
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:16,618
It's a question
of how serious you are
about seeing justice done.

1177
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:20,205
You get me?

1178

I can't eat.
Gonna throw up.

1179
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:31,174
How are you gonna get
anything done
if you can't eat?

1180
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:34,719
Sometimes I can,
sometimes I can't.
This place is terrible.

1181
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:35,970
I need you to eat something.

1182
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,817
So let me ask you
a personal question.

1183
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:53,279
Off the record,
between you and me.

1184
01:23:54,489 --> 01:23:56,574
What do you want me to do
with Ray Marcus?

1185
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:58,076
Well, what can you do
with him?

1186
01:23:58,493 --> 01:24:01,371
Anything you goddamn like.
