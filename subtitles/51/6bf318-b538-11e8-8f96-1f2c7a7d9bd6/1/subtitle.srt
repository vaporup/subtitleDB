I found it in the mailbox
this morning.

14
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,278
May I ask you who you'd like
on duty this weekend?

15
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,573
Um, actually, why don't
you give everybody
the weekend off?

16
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:04,866
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah.

17
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,659
We might go to
the beach house and, uh,

18
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,036
if not, it might be nice
to have a weekend alone.

19
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,081
I'll let everyone know.
Thank you.

20
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,128
Oh, damn it.

21
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,213

CHRISTOPHER: Yes?

22
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:22,466
I'm sorry. Can you
help me open this?
I just got a paper cut.

23
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:24,677
Yeah, of course.
Here, let me do it.
Thank you.

24
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,346
Yeah, yeah.
I just... A paper cut.

25
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:34,312
There's a note.
You can read it.

Good morning.

What's that?
It's a manuscript
Edward sent me.

39
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,693
He wrote a novel.

40
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,737
Edward who?

41
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,448
Edward, my first husband.
You remember him.

42
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,450
I didn't know he could write.

43
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,786
Yes, you did.
He was writing a novel
when you and I got together.

44
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,329
You just don't remember.

45
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,748
Have you guys even talked
in 20 years?

46
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,500
19.

47
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:43,130
No. I tried calling him
a couple of years back,
but he hung up on me.

48
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,258
I think he's teaching English
at some prep school in Dallas.

49
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:48,386
It's sad, really.
He never remarried.

50
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:52,890
Where were you
last night? You didn't
come by the gallery.

51
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,477
I'm sorry. Really, I...

52
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,646
By the time I left
the office, I was late
for my dinner and...

53
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,606
It would have
taken you 15 minutes.

54
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,234
Fifteen minutes, and it would
have meant a lot to me.

55
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,696
Never mind.

56
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,908
You didn't come
to bed last night.
I didn't wanna wake you.

57
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,452
Yeah.

58
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:18,082
Well, I wasn't asleep.
I was too wound up
from the opening.

59
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,712
It went well, by the way.
Apparently.

60
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,380
Good.
Yeah.

61
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,803
Look, why don't you and I
go to the beach?

62
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,597
We can go tonight
and come back on Monday.

63
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,269
Maybe if we
just spent some time,
just the two of us?

64
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:46,110
Why are you wearing
this blazer on a Saturday?

65
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:49,530
Because I gotta
go back to the office,

66
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,867
and then I gotta go
to the airport, and then
I gotta go back to New York.

67
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,244
You just came from there.
Yes, I know.

68
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,247
But I have to go again
if I wanna get this deal done,

69
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,583
and I don't wanna have to sell
anything else.

70
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,460
Shit.
It's okay.

71
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,549
You know,
the strange thing is is,

72
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,469
I don't really care
about all this art.

73
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:17,183
That doesn't sound like you.
I know, but it's true.

74
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,810
I care.

75
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,979
It pisses me off.

76
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,523
I know you do.

77
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,235
Don't worry,
I can fill the walls
with some new LA artists

78
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,739
and people will think
we're ahead of the curve
instead of going broke.

to be embarrassed.

I'm surprised. I thought
we were hiding it pretty well.

Did you call my
psychopharmacologist?
Did you call him?

88
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,652
You should call him,
because he's a genius.

89
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,239
I'm worried
about you, seriously.

90

Just look at me for a second.
Look at me.

91

that I told you
all of those things.

95
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,339
I'm just kind of
embarrassed, you know.

96
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:35,469
Because what right
do I have to not be happy?
I have everything.

97
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,429
I feel ungrateful
not to be happy.

98
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,599
As much right
as anyone, Susan,
as much right as anyone,

99
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,393
because it's all relative.

100
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:49,608
You're just awfully hard
on yourself.

101
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,944
How do you do it?

102
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,866
You mean with Carlos?
I just... It's...
I'm totally cool with it.

103
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:00,703
And having a gay husband
is not such a bad thing,
you know?

104
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:06,333
We're best friends.
We love each other completely.

105
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,794
I'm certainly
the only woman in his life.

106
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:11,672
And that lasts
longer than lust, doesn't it?

107
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,757
It's forever, really.

108

He made you drive.

500
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:03,337
And then when you
started to walk out,
you saw 'em coming in again.

501
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,423
Yes.
Hmm. Whose car were they in?

502
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,175
I think itwas mine.

503
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:11,095
You think?
What makes you think that?

504
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:14,181
By the look of it
and the sound of it.
It sounded like my oar.

505
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,016
Could you see 'em in the dark?

506
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,855
Not very well.
Did they say anything?

507
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:24,692
They said,
"Mister, your wife wants you."

508
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:30,406
You didn't go to 'em.
Why didn't you go to 'em?

509
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:35,828
I don't know
why I didn't go. I was...

Okay.

Can you take it from here?

512
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:54,638
Yeah, I came down the highway
and I walked for a long time,

513
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,932

518
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,086
Right by the reflector.
I remember that.

You said you walked out,
right?

I came up right here,

I don't believe that.

Why'd you give up
on becoming an artist?

627
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:48,570
Because I'm too cynical
to be an artist.

really, really good,

from someplace inside

all over the place.

671

separate 'em out.

to convince me that I had
to marry Bass.

689

That is different.

690
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:36,715
Bass is your equal.

691
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:40,093
Oh, my God.
Did you just say that?
You really just said that.

692
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:42,387
That came out
of your mouth.
Thafsu.

693
00:53:44,723 --> 00:53:46,808
Why do you always think
the worst of me?

694
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,020
That is not what I meant.

695
00:53:52,105 --> 00:53:57,485
What I meant
is that you are very
strong-willed,

696
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:59,946
and Edward,
as sweet as he is,
he's too weak for you.

697
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,408
Weak is not a word
that I would use
to describe Edward.

698
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,577
Sensitive is a word
that I would use,

699
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,872
which isn't a word I would use
to describe anyone else
in this family,

700

701

into this.

are gonna be
very important to you,

708
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,517
and Edward's not gonna be able
to give them to you.

709
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:32,937
He has no money.

710
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:37,442
He's not driven.
He's not ambitious.

711

if you marry Edward,

712
00:54:40,612 --> 00:54:42,405
your father's not gonna
give them to you either.

713
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,533
No, you're right.
He's not driven

would like him to be.

715
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:49,871

in a lot of ways.

"A different kind
of strength."

719

of strength is that?

720
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:04,761

to believe in himself

in the end.

I've never seen him
before in my life.

838
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,387
What you gonna tell me
about Ray and Turk?

839
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:46,514
Who?
Who?

840
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:51,936
What, are you an owl?
You an owl, Lou?

841
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:54,855
I never heard of 'em.
You never heard of 'em?

842
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,691
No, sir.

843
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:02,488
Hmm.

01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:04,198

849

Are you sure
this is the man?
Absolutely, yes.

850
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,513
You'll swear in a court of law
under penalty of perjury?

851
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:28,597
Yes.

852
01:03:34,437 --> 01:03:35,521
Good.

853
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,234
Well, we got Lou.

854
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:42,945
I'm gonna charge him
with murder.

enough evidence?

856

Oh, you bet,
between you and the prints
in the car and the trailer.

857
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:49,785
What, he went back
to the trailer
after he left me?

858
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:53,205
Yeah, looks like it.
Uh, he probably just went back
to tell 'em where you were.

859
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:55,708
That's why they came back
with the bodies.

860

they were gonna kill you.

01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,674
I bet your friend Ray's
the third fella
in the hold-up.

863
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:08,429
What HOW?
Well, you're gonna
wait for trial.

864
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:13,434
And I'm gonna go find Ray.

a board meeting
at the museum at 3:00.

I'm sorry. What was that?

867
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:33,371
You didn't sleep again,
did you?

868
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,960
You know me.
I never sleep.

869
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:44,757
My ex-husband
used to call me
a nocturnal animal.

870
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,133
What ex-husband?

871
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:49,512
I didn't know
you had an ex-husband.
Since when?

872
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:51,639
A couple of years
in graduate school.

873
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:55,851
It's weird,
I've been thinking
about him a lot lately,

874
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:58,270
and then recently
he sent me this book
that he's written

875
01:04:58,354 --> 01:04:59,355
and it's

876
01:05:00,815 --> 01:05:02,149
violent and it's sad,

877
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:05,611
and he entitled it
Nocturnal Animals
and he dedicated it to me.

878
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:08,489
Did you love him?

879
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:09,907
Yeah, I loved him.

880
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:15,204
He was a writer and, uh,
I didn't have faith in him.

881
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:18,707
I panicked
and I did something
horrible to him.

882
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,960
Something unforgivable,
really.

883
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:24,130
You left him?
I left him.

884
01:05:25,673 --> 01:05:28,217
I left him in a brutal way,

885
01:05:29,427 --> 01:05:31,887
for the handsome
and dashing Hutton.

886
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:34,432
Who is very handsome
and dashing.
...and dashing. Yes.

No.

Of course not.
You just started

to be when we hired her.

I think we should keep her
for now.

01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:34,036
(CLAPS HANDS)
Give me some questions.
I'll answer your questions.

1006
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:36,705
I don't know any more
about this hold-up
than I did before I met you.

1007
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:37,748
(EXHALES)
I tell you what,

1008
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:38,957
I'm gonna ask you
a different question.

1009
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:42,002
You recognize this car?
(SIGHS) What car?

1010
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:44,338
This one. The one
we're driving around in.

1011
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:46,340
Why should I recognize
this fucking car?

1012
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:47,549
It ain't familiar to you?

1013
01:13:47,633 --> 01:13:49,343
It don't remind you
of nothing,
take you back?

1014
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:51,637
Why should it?
You don't remember driving it?

1015
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,514
I think I'd know.
Yeah. How about the driver?

1016
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:56,141
What?
This fella?

1017
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:59,186
This fella sitting behind
the steering wheel.
My friend Tony?

1018
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:00,354
You remember him?

1019
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:06,360
I can't see him.
Make him turn around.

1020
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:08,528
ANDES: Stop the car, Tony.

1021
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:15,327
ANDES: Turn around and look
at this piece of shit.

1022
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:20,707
Who is this guy?
You don't remember him?

1023
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:25,003
Can't say I do.
You remember him, Tony?

1024
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:27,673
Yes.
Well, refresh his memory.

1025
01:14:27,756 --> 01:14:29,132
Last summer on the interstate.

1026
01:14:29,216 --> 01:14:31,009
Tell him what you
remember he did.

1027
01:14:31,385 --> 01:14:32,719
You killed my wife
and my daughter.

1028
01:14:33,387 --> 01:14:34,972
That's crazy.
I never killed nobody.

1029
01:14:35,806 --> 01:14:37,933
ANDESI
Tell him the whole thing.
Mmm-mmm.

1030
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:40,686
You and your buddies
on the interstate,
you foroed us off the road.

1031
01:14:40,769 --> 01:14:42,771
ANDES:
Tell him who his buddies are.
Lou and Turk.

1032
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:43,814
You remember that, Ray?

1033
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:45,857
You remember horsing around
on the interstate
with your buddies,

1034
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:47,401
playing chicken
with the other cars?

1035
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:49,778
You're crazy. That's crazy.

1036
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:52,864
TONY: You made us stop
and we had a flat tire
and Lou and Turk fixed it.

1037
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:55,075
Then you and Turk
got in my car
with my wife and my daughter

1038
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:57,786
and you forced me
in your oar with Lou.
ANDESI What then, Tony?

1039
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,414
Lou took me out into the brush
and kicked me out.

1040
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,417
And you came back in my car

1041
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,669
and you called out for me,
trying to lure me
into your trap.

1042
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:07,629
You came back
where Lou had left me

1043
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:10,173
ANDES: Oh, is that why
you went back there, Ray?

1044
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:16,179
(SCOFFS)

1045
01:15:17,973 --> 01:15:20,600
You're fucking crazy!
Tell him what
we found there, Tony.

1046
01:15:21,852 --> 01:15:24,521
TCDNYI YOU tell him.
Do I have to?
Don't you know, Ray?

1047
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:29,818
Y'all are crazy. It's crazy.

1048
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:32,279
TONY: The bodies
of my wife and child

1049
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:37,159
which you took
back there and dumped.

1050
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:42,122
You're the one. I know you.

1051
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:44,082
What do you say, Ray?

1052
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:47,335
You're crazy.
You're making
a big mistake.

1053
01:15:47,419 --> 01:15:49,504
ANDES: Mmm.
I don't think so.

1054
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:53,800
I don't think so, Ray.
Put your hands out
in front of you.

1055
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:55,802
You got no right.
Got no right?

1056
01:15:56,261 --> 01:15:58,847
Rights, rights, rights.
You and your goddamn rights.

1057
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:00,474
Speaking of rights,
I just wanna let you know

1058
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:02,601
I'm recording
this entire conversation.

1059
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:05,228
There. You clear?

1060
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:07,189
Mmm-hmm.
All right, let's go, Tony.

1061
01:16:10,776 --> 01:16:12,903
ANDES: Now, we're going
to a place you might remember,

1062
01:16:12,986 --> 01:16:15,697
and you can help yourself out
by telling me about it.

1063
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:17,574
But if you don't remember,

1064
01:16:17,657 --> 01:16:20,077
Tony does, all right?

1065
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:22,204
RAY: Hey, I'm sorry
you lost your folks, man.

1066
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:25,832
It's a shame.
But I didn't have
nothin' to do with it.

1067
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:47,395
What's this place?
You know this place.

1068
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:49,773
Honest to God, I don't.
You wanna get out, Tony?

1069
01:16:49,856 --> 01:16:51,608
ANDES: Shall we have
a look inside, Ray?
RAY: What for?

1070
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:53,026
ANDES: Come on,
let's take a look.

1071
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,751
All right,
all right.

1072
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:16,925
Oh, you raped them
on the bed, I suppose.

1073
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:18,927
I never raped nobody.
Stop fucking around, Ray.

1074
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,096
We seen your record.
We know about
that girl in Lubbock.

1075
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:23,807
The charges were dropped.
I never raped nobody.

1076
01:17:24,057 --> 01:17:25,058
I wanna know, Ray.

1077
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:29,146
I wanna know the exact story,
what you did to them.

1078
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:34,109
You'll have to ask
somebody else.
I wanna know what they said.

1079
01:17:37,112 --> 01:17:38,613
I wanna know what my wife said

1080
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:40,282
and I wanna know
what my daughter said.

1081
01:17:50,876 --> 01:17:52,294
I wanna know
how you killed them.

1082
01:17:53,545 --> 01:17:55,881
And I wanna know if they knew
it was happening to them.

1083
01:17:55,964 --> 01:17:57,465
I wanna know what they felt!

1084
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:02,888
I wanna know if they hurt.

1085
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:07,934
Answer me!

1086
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:10,979
Answer me!

1087
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:16,443
Answer me,
you fucking bastard!

1088
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:17,611
(GRUNTS)

1089
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:35,545
Is it better?

1090
01:18:37,047 --> 01:18:39,132
You're gonna take this
the wrong way, but, um,

1091
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:42,719
I think that you
should write about something
other than yourself.

1092
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:44,971
(CHUCKLES)

1093
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,267
Nobody writes about anything
but themselves.

1094
01:18:49,351 --> 01:18:51,144
I just, my mind started
to wander when
I was reading it,

1095
01:18:51,269 --> 01:18:53,313
and that's not good, right?

1096
01:18:53,647 --> 01:18:54,648
I don't know what to do.
Maybe, you know,

1097
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,107
maybe I don't have
a book in me.

1098
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:59,027
Maybe give yourself
some space.
Just do something else.

1099
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,070
Can you not do that?
What?

1100
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:01,988
Becauseitu
That makes me feel like
you don't believe in me.

1101
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:05,075
Edward,
that's not what I said.
No, you didn't say that.

1102
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:06,243
But you're saying it
with your face

1103
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:07,494
and you're saying it
when you sigh.

1104
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:10,413
Whatever, you're saying it
when you say you want me
to go baok to sohool.

1105
01:19:10,497 --> 01:19:12,040
Well, yeah, I do want you
to go back to school.

1106
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:13,083
I don't see
what's wrong with that.

1107
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:14,626
I mean,
I'm just being a realist.

1108
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:17,587
I mean, you're gonna
work at a book store
and just write a novel,

1109
01:19:17,671 --> 01:19:19,965
like that's what
you wanna do
with your life?

1110
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:26,096
I mean,
that's really romantic, but,
like, what? This is it?

1111
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:28,306
This is it? This is what...
You sound like your mother.

1112
01:19:31,226 --> 01:19:34,521
Well, you always said
that I reminded you
so much of her, so...

1113
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,440
You know, this is exactly why
I don't wanna read your work

1114
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:39,317
because you always get
so fucking defensive.

1115
01:19:39,401 --> 01:19:40,819
Yeah, of course I'm defensive!

1116
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:44,239
Do you know what it feels like
to put yourself out
on the line creatively

1117
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:47,701
and then have someone
you love tell you that
they don't understand it?

1118
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,619
No, I don't,
because I'm not creative...

1119
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:51,121
EDWARD: That's because
you choose not to be.

1120
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:57,168
I don't wanna fight.
I'm tired and I'm edgy.

1121
01:19:57,252 --> 01:20:00,672
I've been writing all night.
I just wanted you to like it,
all right?

1122
01:20:09,097 --> 01:20:10,098
Thanks.

1123
01:20:21,026 --> 01:20:22,986
<i>ANDES: I got some news
you're not gonna like.</i>

1124
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,947
They're letting Ray Marcus go.

1125
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:27,824
TONY: <i>What? What do you mean,
they're letting him go?</i>

1126
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:31,286
The D.A. says we don't have
enough hard evidence,

1127
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:32,954
what we have
is circumstantial.

1128
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:35,415
He needs corroboration.

1129
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:37,500
(TONY SCOFFS)

1130
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:40,420
I'm real sorry, Tony.

1131
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:43,465
It's a goddamn shame.

1132
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:47,010
At least you got to lay
a good belt on him.

1133
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:50,013
<i>No, that's not enough.
What else can we do?</i>

1134
01:20:51,765 --> 01:20:53,016
I can think of something.

1135
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:55,810
You'd better get
here quick, though.

1136
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:57,479
He ain't gonna
stick around for long.

1137
01:20:58,438 --> 01:20:59,898
<i>Okay, all right,
I'm leaving now.</i>

1138
01:21:03,777 --> 01:21:04,778
What?

1139
01:21:06,196 --> 01:21:09,741
I told you,
I got lung cancer.
It's metastasized.

1140
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:13,995
But you smoke all the time.
Yeah, well,
that's how it works.

1141
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:17,207
What's the point
in quitting now?
I'll be dead in a year.

1142
01:21:17,374 --> 01:21:19,209
(SIGHS)
It's this fella named Jenks.

1143
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:21,211
He's the lawyer
the court appointed for Ray.

1144
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:23,129
He's a little smartass
from Dallas.

1145
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:26,716
He and the D.A. made a deal
and Ray got off. Politics.

1146
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,301
When did you tell me
you were sick?

1147
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:30,804
See, they're trying
to force me out.

1148
01:21:31,096 --> 01:21:33,515
They already got another fella
lined up for the job.

1149
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:34,724
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1150
01:21:34,808 --> 01:21:36,393
They'd drop a murder case
to do that?

1151
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:40,188
Oh, yeah.
Give 'em the reason,
ammunition.

1152
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:44,901
They said my case
wasn't well-prepared,
was a sloppyjob, slapdash,

1153
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:47,654
no evidence and evidence
improperly gathered,

1154
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:49,322
won't stand up in court.

1155
01:21:51,324 --> 01:21:54,828
The D.A.'s too much
of a chickenshit
to take a case he might lose.

1156
01:21:58,748 --> 01:21:59,999
They're not dropping Lou.

1157
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:05,255
Well, it's no fucking good
if we don't get Ray.

1158
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,091
Good.

1159
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:10,552
That's what I was
hoping you'd say.

1160
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:16,224
They want me to retire
and enjoy the benefits
of my cancer somewhere else.

1161
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,685
Fuckthat
Y%n1neverkMdrne
about the cancer.

1162
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:20,645
The problem with Ray
is his alibi.

1163
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:21,980
You have a family?

1164
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,315
Ray claims he was with
that little...
Bobby.Bobby.

1165
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:26,025
What?

1166
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:29,237
Do you have anyone
in your life?

1167
01:22:35,869 --> 01:22:38,204
No. No wife or...

1168
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,084
I have a daughter in Corpus.

1169
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:48,631
Has she been a help?

1170
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:55,013
She doesn't know.
What can she do about it?

1171
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:02,228
Anyway, Ray claims

1172
01:23:02,312 --> 01:23:05,023
he was with that little girl,
Leila whatever her name is

1173
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:06,816
and she backs him up.

1174
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,151
Her aunt backs her up.

1175
01:23:08,902 --> 01:23:09,903
What are we gonna do?

1176
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:16,618
It's a question
of how serious you are
about seeing justice done.

1177

I can't eat.
Gonna throw up.

1179
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:31,174
How are you gonna get
anything done
if you can't eat?

1180
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:34,719
Sometimes I can,
sometimes I can't.
This place is terrible.

1181
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:35,970
I need you to eat something.

1182
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,817
So let me ask you
a personal question.

1183
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:53,279
Off the record,
between you and me.

1184
01:23:54,489 --> 01:23:56,574
What do you want me to do
with Ray Marcus?

1185
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:58,076
Well, what can you do
with him?

1186
01:23:58,493 --> 01:24:01,371
Anything you goddamn like.

I did not call you weak.
