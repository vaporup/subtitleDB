1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,210
I wonder if Deunan is okay...

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,490
Hitomi!

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,550
Don't tell me...

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,280
You exceeded your life-prolong procedure limit
for more than three days!

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,510
Hitomi!

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,590
We are still not sure who owns the Land Mates
that attacked Gaia Research Center.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,750
This is the end of ESWAT report for this attack.

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,160
All Bioroid, please remain calm.

9
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,690
We are trying to restore the life-prolonging system.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,310
Please do not panic and be patient!

11
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:07,720
Premier Athena, isn't it beyond ESWAT's authority
to block all surrounding of Tarutarus and Tartarus?

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,210
Under extreme circumstances,
this is the only option under martial law.

13
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,190
It is our responsibility to protect Gaia.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,060
Not to protect the D-Tank?

15
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,760
It is to protect Gaia!

16
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,850
Totally disregarding us Olympus military?

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,880
I only chose the best option.

18
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,130
What do you mean? Are you insulting me?

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,150
Please, we have no time to argue!

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:51,030
Everyone, this terrorist attack is targeting
Bioriod's existence, an unforgiving tragedy in Olympus.

21
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:59,310
If this continues, Bioriod's fate
would be to perish from the surface of earth.

22
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:09,920
There is an only one way
to save them as well as protect Olympus.

23
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,320
It took a long time to make the decision.

24
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,210
We discussed with Gaia for a long time.

25
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,050
Gaia has made a decision.

26
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,550
Gaia wanted to make Bioriod alive.

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,990
Make Bioriod to have reproductive ability.

28
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,870
About the technology to restore
Bioriod's reproductive ability,

29
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,610
I heard that Dr. Gillian
who developed the technology erased all data.

30
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,670
That made the development impossible.

31
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,960
That's true, General Uranus.

32
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,400
If that technology's data was indeed erased,

33
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,960
it's impossible to develop it again.

34
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:24,620
However, the lost data,
which we called "Apple Seed", does exist.

35
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,120
Soon we will find the lost Apple Seed,

36
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,240
and restore Bioriod's reproductive ability,

37
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,830
allowing them to evolve to be the new human being,

38
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,860
and build a new Utopia.

39
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,460
Hitomi...

40
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,450
She's fine.

41
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,980
Only sleeping...

42
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,200
Are you sure she could be saved?

43
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,170
As long as we find the lost Apple Seed.

44
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,800
If not...

45
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,770
Her body will degenerate very quickly.

46
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,040
She'll die within 24 hours.

47
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,600
Not only Hitomi herself,

48
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,930
all Bioriod will have the same destiny.

49
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,400
Premier Athena Reyes. you are Deunan Knute, right?

50
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,310
Deunan

51
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,990
Do you know Dr. Gillian?

52
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,620
No.

53
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,960
We did research over twenty years.

54
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,090
But still couldn't match Dr. Gillian's researches.

55
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,490
But, if we get Dr. Gillian's Apple Seed,

56
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,610
the Bioriod reproductive ability can be restored.

57
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,690
We can become the new human being
regardless of D-Tank.

58
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,600
Gaia made the final decision.

59
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:33,570
Athena, we all depended on you now.

60
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,080
Deunan, we need your help.

61
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,270
This old disc is the only clue?

62
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,320
Is it real that the first generation Bioriod
was born in this research center we are headed?

63
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,670
Yes, according to my superior.

64
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,350
Why did Athena cover the secret
of this disc up until now?

65
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,280
Why did Dr. Gillian restrain
the reproductive ability of Bioriod?

66
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,180
Deunan, this a secretive and dangerous mission.

67
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,960
We need to concentrate to do our job.

68
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,670
Be able to save Hitomi. Won't that be enough?

69
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,450
Don't think too much.

70
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,900
Can I ask you a question?

71
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,920
During that terrorist attack, your last shot...

72
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,880
Ah, never mind.

73
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,910
Deunan, Redon, here.

74
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,010
No mistake about it, this is it.

75
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,530
Kudo, back off.

76
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,830
Dr. Gillian, there's no time to waste,
please escape now!

77
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,550
Athena, there's still some data left,
I have to erase every last little bit.

78
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,830
We'll try to defend the first attack, please be hurry.

79
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,120
Mommy

80
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,400
What is it? Did you wake up?

81
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,230
How come...

82
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,000
What is it, Deunan...

83
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,920
Mother

84
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,870
Deunan, listen carefully.

85
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,830
Mommy hid the most important research data
inside this pendant.

86
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:20,200
But bad guys wanted to use mommy's research
for bad things.

87
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,740
Therefore, mommy had to hide it.

88
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,060
Bad guys?

89
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,980
Yes.

90
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,340
Bad guys who want to take away Deunan's future.

91
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,330
So Deunan must make sure she protects this pendent.

92
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,110
Nmmm, Deunan will protect it.

93
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,480
Good girl.

94
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,520
Deunan, but if Athena says she wants this pendent,

95
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,600
give this pendent to Athena.

96
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,840
Only Athena is an exception.

97
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,770
I know. Only Athena is exception.

98
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,460
Deunan, protect the "Apple Seed".

99
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,880
Deunan, do you remember the thing we are looking for?

100
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,400
Do you remember?

101
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,170
Carl's pistol... is Apple Seed inside that pendent?

102
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,670
Dr. Gillian, please don't move.

103
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,440
Don't move!

104
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,960
I beg you, don't move!

105
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,610
Mommy, what is it, mommy!

106
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,430
Deunan, don't come here!

107
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,340
Don't shoot!

108
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,720
Mommy

109
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,950
Trouble. Olympus military. When did they...

110
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,300
How did they know this place?

111
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,510
Too many enemies! Seaside is already occupied!

112
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,860
Only way is go to the top.

113
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,980
To the roof!

114
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,990
Everybody stay calm!

115
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,430
Position: Room D at 5th floor.

116
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,160
Redon, you betrayed us!

117
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,090
I always hated Bioriod.

118
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,740
As for the traitor,

119
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,610
that guy is the first one!

120
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,510
Hades

121
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,180
Deunan, long time no see.

122
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,830
I regretted I couldn't kill Carl myself.

123
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,250
No surpises, you smell like Bioriod yourself.

124
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,210
And, even with this Cyborg body,

125
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,430
you two are still together.

126
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,060
Tell you the truth,
I was a little scared of seven elder's trick.

127
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,930
But, over trust your men is always your weakness,
Briareos.

128
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,180
Briareos, what's going on?

129
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,680
Let me tell you, Deunan.

130
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,910
The one behind the terrorist attack of Gaia,

131
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,150
is this Briareos.

132
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,590
You still remember my Land Mate got away from him?

133
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,900
Because of him, many Bioriod died.

134
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,630
Is that true?

135
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,000
Answer her, you dog!

136
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,640
Come on, give that pendent to me.

137
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,410
Deunan.

138
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,380
Hurry, go to the top!

139
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,250
Hurry!

140
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,030
Kudo!

141
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,850
Let's go!

142
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,870
Don't come any closer!

143
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,150
Stay away from me!

144
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,800
Deunan, give me the pendent now!

145
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,490
They want the pendent, not you.

146
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,110
This is what my mother protected with her life.

147
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,710
You know everything from the beginning, don't you?

148
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,830
Deunan.

149
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,350
Deunan, you finally start to know him.
The true identity of that monster.

150
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,290
Deunan Knute, I am general commander
of Olympus military, Senator Edward Uranus.

151
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,660
Carl Knute was my old friend, so was Dr. Gillian.

152
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,330
I've seen you a few times when you were a child.

153
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,210
We don't want to hurt you.

154
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,640
Just give the research data to us.

155
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,570
We prepare to overthrow the legislative institute,
destroy D-Tank and eliminate all Bioriod.

156
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,570
Turning the human society back into human's hand.

157
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,570
But the data in your hand will destroy our plan.

158
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,710
Could you please give it to us?

159
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,760
I refuse.

160
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,420
Deunan.

161
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,180
Deunan.

162
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,410
Olympus is not the Utopia in Carl
and Dr. Gillian's dream any more.

163
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,030
I learned my fighting skills from my father Carl.

164
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,090
But I don't understand why father trained me
to become a fighting machine.

165
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,160
Now, I finally know why.

166
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,120
General, my mother's last words are that I should not
give this to anyone else except Athena.

167
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,850
Bioriod are not trust worthy.

168
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,370
They will only continue to control human being.

169
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,290
Maybe they are not to be trusted.

170
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,570
However, one thing is clear.

171
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,080
Bioriod will not kill each other.

172
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,530
General, we don't have that much time.

173
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,640
Deunan, it's a pity.

174
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,160
Athena was protecting human society.

175
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,840
So were Carl and Dr. Gillian.

176
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,540
They tried to hide Apple Seed to protect human.

177
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,190
They wanted to prevent the rapid evolution of Bioriod.

178
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,370
Because Bioriod is a dangerous being.

179
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,910
No. Continue Dr. Gillian's research,

180
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,470
Athena is making Bioriod to evolve slowly,
step by step.

181
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:48,910
General...

182
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,480
Bioriod is always protecting human society.

183
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,650
The reason I help Hades on that terrorist attack,

184
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,610
is to help Athena to slow down
the evolution process of Bioriod.

185
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,070
And keep Deunan's lost memories lost.

186
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,320
Athena wanted to hide the secret until the last.

187
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,450
My mission is to give Apple Seed to seven elders.

188
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,470
That's how I get the job to protect Deunan.

189
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,390
If so, that pendent must be destroyed.

190
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,820
General, isn't it rather strange?

191
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,510
Seven elders doesn't only want the Apple Seed.

192
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,930
They want to use Apple Seed to destroy D-Tank.

193
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,130
Athena must have some reason behind her protection
of the D-Tank.

194
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,400
General, don't let D-Tank be destroyed!

195
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,690
Briareos

196
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,250
Don't be fooled by the machine's word.

197
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,940
This is revenge, Deunan.

198
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,830
Can you imagine the life I had

199
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,730
after I was dismissed from ESWAT?

200
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,570
This is the revenge to Carl for dismissing me!

201
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,150
I will kill all Bioriod with his DNA.

202
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,010
I will kill all Bioriod!

203
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,080
Hades

204
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,640
If you want to hate someone, hate your father, Deunan!

205
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,220
Sorry.

206
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,580
Don't speak any more.

207
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,410
Although it's the latest Cyborg cell,

208
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,730
I still feel pain when hit by bullets.

209
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,760
Please, don't speak anymore.

210
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,450
Always want to see you again.

211
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,370
When I was dying in the battlefield,

212
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,130
just wanted to see you one more time.

213
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,750
Then, I was saved by seven elders.

214
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,160
If I can protect you,

215
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,710
nothing else matters.

216
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,590
I know.

217
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,200
My body and soul became a monster like this.

218
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,750
You didn't change.

219
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,470
Still yourself.

220
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,850
But I cannot protect you any more

221
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,440
I won't let you die.

222
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,430
Deunan, human being...

223
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,250
Briareos

224
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,100
There won't be a single human sacrifice.

225
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,080
Seven elders promised that.

226
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,160
However they must be planing something under the table.

227
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,610
Therefore, go!

228
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,660
But, I cannot leave you here.

229
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,730
The future of this planet is in your hands.

230
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,980
I don't need a future without you.

231
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,600
Deunan, don't let your mother die in vain.

232
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,240
Enough. Don't speak any more.

233
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,800
Deunan.

234
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,350
Briareos

235
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,180
Briareos

236
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,970
Briareos sent SOS signal when he was hit.

237
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,080
Hecatonchires is really something,
the special structure is all different.

238
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,050
Stil have time to restore the tissues.

239
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,890
We can still save him.

240
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,860
Please save him.

241
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,670
The fuel is enough for the trip.

242
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,870
Lade Mate's Ultravibrate Gravity System
is already in use now.

243
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,860
Flying is more stable.

244
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,530
The center of gravity has some offset,

245
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,930
but shouldn't have any problem for 60 degree rotation.

246
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,000
Deunan, we Bioriod,

247
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,040
still have a little feelings of love left.

248
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,140
Please save Hitomi.

249
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,110
Deunan Knute. Mission accomplished.

250
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,070
Good work.

251
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,910
Deunan.

252
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,540
Deunan, good work!

253
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,770
Finally we Bioriod reproductive ability.

254
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,020
Hitomi has the same life cycle as a human now.

255
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,400
This way, Hitomi is saved.

256
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,350
I am so happy.

257
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,140
No need to worry any more.

258
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,360
Deunan...

259
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,100
It's you guys who killed my mother, isn't it?

260
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,820
Did you have my mother killed?

261
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,790
Deunan please forgive us.

262
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,380
That really was an accident.

263
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,640
If Dr. Gillian were alive,

264
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,820
We would only have more options.

265
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,730
Why did mother hide Apple Seed?

266
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,390
We got our only hope from Dr. Gillian.

267
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,790
The final chance to allow human race to exist.

268
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:59,230
Coexistence of human and Bioriod is the only way.

269
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,230
But, human never give up fighting.

270
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,480
They are afraid and hate the superior race.

271
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,780
With vehemence.

272
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,640
Human race has no ability to rule this planet anymore,

273
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,240
they are a disgrace to Dr. Gillian's ideal.

274
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:33,440
According to Gaia's prediction, human race will
be destroyed with earth in three generations.

275
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:42,100
Deunan, it's time for us human race
to step out of the way.

276
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,200
Step out of the way?

277
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:50,350
We human must give the future of the earth to Bioriod.

278
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,730
Dr. Gillian's virus,

279
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,120
will finally have its destiny fullfilled.

280
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,200
Virus developed by my mother?

281
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,200
Yes, on the top of Tarutarus.

282
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,840
Sealed inside D-Tank.

283
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:23,580
This virus can destroy the reproductive ability
of human being.

284
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,870
No human being will be sacrificed.

285
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:35,840
We will peacefully end human's history.

286
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,730
This is the euthanasia of human race.

287
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,870
My mother objected that idea.

288
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,480
She disagreed with the rapid evolution of Bioriod.

289
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,610
That's why you killed her.

290
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,720
There used to be two options for Olympus.

291
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:01,370
Coexistence with Bioriod or evolution
to the new human race.

292
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,160
To make the correct and fair judgment,

293
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,420
Gaia was produced.

294
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:15,090
Dr. Gillian made great effort to produce Gaia.

295
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,860
Gaia worked in the way Dr. Gillian designed.

296
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,980
If Gaia has a different opinion,

297
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,310
it's impossible to release the virus.

298
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,820
Just then, human started then World War.

299
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,660
this planet was turned to a wasteland.

300
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,350
The Olympus which rules the world became like this.

301
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:59,820
General Uranus' hatred
towards Bioriod only added to Gaia's anger.

302
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,650
Then, Gaia made the final judgment.

303
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:13,120
Using Apple Seed to make Bioriod the new master race,

304
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,190
and erase human race from the history.

305
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,160
You used me.

306
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,530
You used me as the decoy to make Briareos obedient.

307
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,350
Our effort is only
to make Gaia to come to the conclusion.

308
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,590
Gaia is a hoax.

309
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,500
This is the fate of human, Deunan!

310
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,770
As soon as I press this button,

311
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,900
D-Tank on top of Tarutarus will explode.

312
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,980
Virus will spread all over the world.

313
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,620
Stop there, old men!

314
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,190
It's 984G, please act as soon as possible!

315
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,380
The button has no use now.

316
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,740
What are you doing, Athena?

317
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,090
Bioriod was created to prevent the destruction
of human race.

318
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,340
Did you forget that?

319
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,080
Bioriod was set to obey the orders of humans.

320
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,540
We are not Bioriod anymore.
Please call us the "New Human".

321
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,170
Athena, this is Gaia's decision!

322
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,170
It's the rage against Uranus's rebellion,

323
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,790
the punishment to human being's atrocity.

324
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,420
General Uranus gave up the rebellion just a moment ago.

325
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,490
He is seeking to coexist with us peacefully.

326
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,170
General Uranus did?

327
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,730
This event, Gaia would not have not known.

328
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,080
Deunan, Gaia no longer exists here.

329
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,390
Gaia doesn't exist anymore?

330
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,380
The vehemence of human race is decreasing.

331
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,810
Gaia should have reconsidered the judgment.

332
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,570
But these old men stopped Gaia,

333
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,060
working on their own will.

334
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,990
Athena you are pretty smart.

335
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,120
New human is really perfect.

336
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,600
By stopping Gaia,
your life-sustain system would be affected also.

337
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,790
That's right.
We are going to step out of history together with human race.

338
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,890
The multi-legged cannon?

339
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,680
All multi-legged cannons
are proceeding toward Olympus headquarter!

340
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,180
The multi-legged cannons
are waling toward the top of Tarutarus!

341
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,350
No one can stop them now.

342
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,250
All ESWAT Land Mates move out now!

343
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,530
Attack the cannons!

344
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,180
Stop them by all means!

345
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,970
The defense system of D-Tank will hold, right?

346
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,720
If hit by multi-legged cannon at zero distance,
it still will break.

347
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,680
The most powerful sword against the perfect shield,

348
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,190
It's a tragedy to worship power.

349
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,680
At this speed, they will reach Tarutarus in 15 minutes.

350
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,900
How about the evacuation of citizens?

351
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,330
We are trying our best.

352
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,270
That's the top priority.

353
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,720
Once the cannons enter no-man's zone,
attack them immediately!

354
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,090
No 7 cannon is the control center of all cannons.

355
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,320
Hitomi!

356
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,790
Hitomi...

357
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,040
I am sorry, grandpas.

358
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,260
If you send control abort signal
from the the control box inside No 7,

359
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,350
all cannons will stop.

360
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,180
But don't ever destroy it!

361
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:50,130
No 7 has to be stopped manually.

362
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,240
The password for control abort is hitomi.

363
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,930
Briareos

364
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,500
Deunan, we have a promise.

365
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,640
Deunan, time to go. Jump...

366
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,140
You won't make it.

367
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,200
Human race will only make the planet perish.

368
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,890
Deunan, human race cannot turn back any more.

369
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,670
Why not let the new human bear
the sin of the human race?

370
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,020
We will survive even it's not an utopia.

371
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,130
We will shape our own future using our own hands.

372
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,280
Deunan.

373
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,190
Not good, they have no weakness anywhere.

374
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,710
Multi-legged cannon is now 2000 meters from Tarutarus!

375
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,130
We cannot hurt them at all!

376
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,020
Jilas Captain, we are approaching No 7! Cover us!

377
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,480
No 7 is...

378
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,320
The one in the middle.

379
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,840
Concentrate your attack on the legs of No 6 and No 8!

380
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,320
How about the No 5 in front?

381
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,670
Don't worry about that one.
Concentrate all of your firepower on No 6 and No 8!

382
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,200
No 6 is stopped!

383
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,240
Good.

384
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,030
How about No 8?

385
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,730
That's the one. I will attract its fire.

386
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,400
Deunan you approach it from below.

387
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,400
Understood.

388
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,150
Briareos

389
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,280
Deunan

390
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,930
Multi-legged cannons has reached Tarutarus.

391
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,900
They started to climbing towards the top.

392
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,710
Deunan the time is up.

393
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,590
Multi-legged cannon No 3 is approaching the top.

394
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,470
There's no way to stop it.

395
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,380
How come...

396
00:47:58,770 --> 00:47:59,490
Why...

397
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,390
Briareos

398
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,500
Deunan, let go of my hand...

399
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,440
No, I can't do such a thing.

400
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,550
Hurry, enter the password!

401
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,410
Mother...

402
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,380
They stopped.

403
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,740
All multi-legged cannons has stopped. D-Tank is safe.

404
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,770
Briareos

405
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,360
Deunan... Hitomi...

406
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,720
How about the grandpas?

407
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,430
Oh...

408
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,730
The the last letter of the access code...

409
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:15,200
It's entrusted... it's entrusted to us now.

410
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,900
Nothing has changed.

411
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:01,200
It must be the unchanging
that added to human race's sins.

412
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,660
Even so, I will continue to fight.

413
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,690
For our children,

414
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,740
for the true new human race...
