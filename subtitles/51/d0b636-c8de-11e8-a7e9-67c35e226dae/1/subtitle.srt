7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,830
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven

8
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:27,130
and did cast them to the earth:

9
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:29,930
and the dragon stood before the woman
which was ready to be delivered,

10
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:32,730
for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

11
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:36,530
Revelation - Chapter 12:4

12
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,290
Just like in the forecast data.

13
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,870
Excuse me.

14
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,640
I hope the anesthesia did no harm to her.

15
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,720
Sir, Deunan Knute is secured!

16
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,360
Such a beauty...

17
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,460
8 hours 12 minutes, she slept so long.

18
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,730
This legendary soldier is so cute
even when she's asleep.

19
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,560
About what happened to your body?

20
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,670
She will be surprised!

21
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,860
When we get to the Utopia.

22
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,630
Utopia, eh...

23
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,350
Did we get the landing permit from Olympus A5?

24
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,020
Don't get too close before ID is confirmed
or the multi-legged cannon will fire at us.

25
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,290
Here is Olympus A5.

26
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,230
Lading permit confirmed.

27
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,290
ESWAT109 landing.

28
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,070
Briareos

29
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,330
I'll take a look up ahead.

30
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,310
I will go with you.

31
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,310
You stay here.

32
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,460
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

33
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,480
Briareos...

34
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,040
Such a detailed inspection this time.

35
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,240
According to the order from legislative institute.

36
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,110
Still sleeping... perhaps wrong dosage of anesthesia?

37
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,470
Don't move or I'll break your neck!

38
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,650
Deunan Knute, second team captain, stand down!

39
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,460
Briareos

40
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,200
I can't believe it.

41
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,840
Can't blame you. But this is the truth...

42
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,840
So after such a large scale World War,
there is no winner?

43
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,470
Yes. After that, the previous administration took over.
In other word, Olympus is now controlling this world.

44
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,100
That means I blindly

45
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,570
kept fighting for months with no cause?

46
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,700
That's how war is, isn't it?

47
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,690
But it's different here.

48
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,530
Olympus is the ideal government
that mankind has search for ages.

49
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,500
Why brought me here?

50
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,770
Because you are an elite soldier.

51
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,720
Your name on the top of ESWAT's human enhancement list.

52
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,680
My mission is to bring people on the list
from outside world to Olympus.

53
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,610
ESWAT?

54
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,140
I know you must have lots of questions.

55
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,500
But, please take a good rest tonight.

56
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,600
We will continue tomorrow.
I will show you around the city.

57
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,600
I'm sure Deunan you will fall in love with our Utopia.

58
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,470
Here is the bedroom.

59
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,410
Haven't slept on a soft bed for a long time,
haven't you?

60
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,500
I'll pick you up at 10 am tomorrow.

61
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,980
You are Hitomi, right?

62
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,310
Yeah.

63
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,890
Haven't we meet before?

64
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,930
I don't think so. Good night.

65
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,700
When...

66
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,720
In the battle of North Africa,

67
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,070
I lost my body.

68
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,220
It's been over one year.

69
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,340
This is Carl's...

70
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,150
It's what your father left behind.

71
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,480
Don't let them get it.

72
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,400
Call me if you have trouble.

73
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,570
Briareos

74
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,230
Do you know those who attacked me?

75
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,170
No.

76
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,830
So sad.

77
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,210
Athena you arranged that attack, didn't you?

78
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,090
It's impossible for the mercenaries
to confront with ESWAT.

79
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,800
Did you forget the mission of Bioriod?

80
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,700
If the military knows,

81
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,970
General Uranus will be pleased.

82
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,300
We won't be able to control them by ourselves.

83
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,600
Gaia might have reached its limit.

84
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,600
Athena, we don't have much time left.

85
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,730
Nike

86
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,220
They've found out.

87
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,560
I'm so sorry.

88
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:10,870
Nike

89
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,150
We need our man inside ESWAT.

90
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,250
I'll prepare right now.

91
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,080
But the worst is,

92
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,340
we didn't find that thing.

93
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,020
Then

94
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,490
It's not yet the time to use the last resort.

95
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,230
But the fire has to be put out before it grows.

96
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,500
Secure Deunan Knute by all means!

97
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,540
Yes sir!

98
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,190
Human is such a strange creature
that will fall into its own traps.

99
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,870
Never thought Captain Hades will be here personally.

100
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,920
Imagine how ESWAT is chasing
after the fake information...

101
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,900
Preparation is 98% finished.

102
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,830
Wonderful...

103
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:50,390
The problem of special part on the leg was also solved.

104
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,280
General Uranus will be pleased.

105
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,690
Now, Bioriod won't be able to do as they wishes.

106
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,380
We should not be protecting wolves.

107
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,730
instead we should protect the sheep like human,
shouldn't we?

108
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,300
Indeed that's the principle
for our first generation Bioriod.

109
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,950
However some wolves are under sheep's skins.

110
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,620
No matter if it's a wolf or a sheep,
there should not be any sacrifices.

111
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:38,030
So sad. We've already known the answer to this.

112
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,120
Even then, we have to debate with Gaia like this.

113
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,850
Then let's continue to debate with Gaia.

114
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,310
Deunan

115
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,180
Briareos

116
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,520
Morning, Deunan.

117
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,170
It fits well. Come on, let's go.

118
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,110
Your entry permit was approved this morning.

119
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,700
So Deunan you are offically a member of our Olympus.

120
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,400
Beautiful city, isn't it?

121
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,460
Comparing with where I was yesterday,

122
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,840
it's like a dream.

123
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,980
From today on, this is the reality.

124
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,660
Everyone seems happy.

125
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,660
Because in this city 50% population are Bioriod.

126
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,880
Bioriod?

127
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,640
Man-made human.

128
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,760
Clones?

129
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,260
No, not simple clones,

130
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,240
but man-made human with carefully selected human gene.

131
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,160
Does it mean that the city is controlled by clones?

132
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,500
It's not polite to say "clone".

133
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,320
I am a Bioriod myself.

134
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,160
And, although being elite,

135
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,860
Bioriod doesn't control human.

136
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,210
Bioriod aims to coexists with human peacefully.

137
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,640
and become an integral part
of human to human relations.

138
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,930
Half of them are Bioriod...

139
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,510
This car is sort of strange.

140
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,940
The experimental ultravibrate gravity system
is installed on this car.

141
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,180
Ultravibrate gravity?

142
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,480
Yes, like hovering.

143
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,470
It's said the driver would have a longer life.

144
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,690
So the ultravibrate gravity control technology
is finished.

145
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,840
But, you control the car by that steering wheel?

146
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,610
In this city, the use of automation technology
has reached such level,

147
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,020
this wheel is a symbol of the "for the people" idea.

148
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,590
Simple theory, complicated structure,
makes human more human.

149
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,730
What's that all about?

150
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,260
City planners used to say that.

151
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,230
That is the symbolic building.

152
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,880
Tarutarus and Tartarus.

153
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,120
Inside there, an enormous I.N. structure
that controls Olympus.

154
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,770
I.N.?

155
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,110
Means "Intellectual Network".

156
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,090
Commonly called Gaia.

157
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,810
Gaia grows with the network
and monitors all of Olympus.

158
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,610
Especially we Bioriod.

159
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,000
Why?

160
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,970
Human has emotions.

161
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,160
They argue and start wars.

162
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,680
Bioriod is restrained on emotions.

163
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:54,950
They don't hate others
so there won't be any fighting.

164
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:02,480
On the top of Tarutarus,
there is a perfect defense system
protecting the "D-Tank" virus storage system

165
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,030
It is said that if the virus is spread out,
all Bioriod will die.

166
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,990
It's the product of human defense instinct.

167
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,770
But it's a insult to Bioriod.

168
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,760
You mean human is more dangerous.

169
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,700
So the balance between human and Boiriod
is more important.

170
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,850
Gaia monitors the effect of the Bioriod with human.

171
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,750
But the one being monitored are still human being.

172
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,970
You spoke like General Uranus.

173
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,800
Who is General Uranus?

174
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,370
General commander of Olympus military.

175
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,190
An extremist that hates Bioriod.

176
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,800
An being that's unfit in Utopia.

177
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,470
Bioriod controls Olympus.

178
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,190
Premier Athena is a Bioriod too.

179
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,600
Athena?

180
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,580
You know her?

181
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,820
Probably not.

182
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,080
Premier is just like the president.

183
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,900
However the military is controlled by human.

184
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,100
Scary, right?

185
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:09,570
Recently the ESWAT under Athena's control
is growing bigger.

186
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,130
The relations with military has gone from bad to worse.

187
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,260
But all decisions of Olympus are controlled by Gaia.

188
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,380
Something wrong?

189
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,710
We've got company.

190
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,040
Hitomi, are you okay?

191
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,230
Sure.

192
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,570
But they are...

193
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,250
They sure know what to do.

194
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,730
So I am the target.

195
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,760
No question about it.

196
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,790
Such is the reality.

197
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,250
Briareos.

198
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,370
Cannot unseal the Apple Seed.

199
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,750
How are you doing, grandpas?

200
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,820
Hitomi, are you alright?

201
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,960
Are you hurt?

202
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,440
I am okay.

203
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,400
And I bring you the long awaited Deunan Knute.

204
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,420
Ahh, the legendary beauty!

205
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,140
Goddess of fighting.

206
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,220
You have the same eyes like Carl.

207
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,220
You know my father?

208
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,800
Not only that,

209
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:42,920
Most Bioriod in Olympus have inherited
part of Carl Knute's gene.

210
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,600
That means Hitomi is your sister.

211
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,770
We heard you met some unpleasant things.

212
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:58,890
Recently,
it's very complicated to control people from outside.

213
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,170
We are worried that the balance will be broken.

214
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,630
First let's introduce Gaia to you.

215
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,140
Enemies of the general...

216
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,900
The legislative institute and administrative institute
began to confront each other

217
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,330
over the issues of Bioriod population increasing, etc.

218
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,650
Athena is really targeting Carl's daughter?

219
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,470
Absolutely. All the preparation is done.

220
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,660
Degree of the information source?

221
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,540
It's level 5.

222
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,540
General, Please make a decision!

223
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,610
Human cannot be the tool of souls any more.

224
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,540
This is Gaia.

225
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,190
Gaia lets the network grow and controls Olympus.

226
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,080
Gaia speaks with the seven elders and the conclusion
becomes the consciousness of Olympus.

227
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,860
Gaia is the combine product of many scientists'
intelligence and consciousness.

228
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,890
However a machine is a machine.

229
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,820
It's absolute stable,

230
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,110
a reliable tool.

231
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,370
But it has no emotions and no feelings.

232
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,480
Only if combine with seven elder's feelings

233
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,130
Gaia could think more like a human.

234
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,950
But recently
you have very different opinions with Gaia.

235
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:12,070
Our work is to argue with Gaia.

236
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,550
The conclusion of the debate can lead Olympus
to the correct direction for future development.

237
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,580
Deunan, you were still in battlefield yesterday,
right?

238
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,140
What did you fight for?

239
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,700
Well...

240
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,490
Human being will not stop fighting
as long as there are emotions and desires.

241
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,830
That's why we built Olympus.

242
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:51,310
The last hope for human being
is the coexistence of human and Bioriod.

243
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,260
Gaia continously monitors this balance.

244
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,000
Bioriod is totally different from human.

245
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,140
Without the reproductive ability,
they cannot have children.

246
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,180
No sex.

247
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:16,490
No love, no desire, and therefore no hatred.

248
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,590
However if the life-prolonging procedure
is not performed regularly,

249
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,120
they will get old really fast and die.

250
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:37,750
We wanted to make Bioriod different from human,
so we supressed their reproductive ability,

251
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,160
and changed their life cycle.

252
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,990
Hitomi,
aren't you late for the life-prolonging procedure?

253
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,500
No problem, I will have it done there soon.

254
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:57,270
Hopefully, someday Bioroids
don't have to go through such troublesome procedure.

255
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,660
Kudo, all your team members are dead.

256
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,040
You are still too young, sorry for that.

257
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,590
Started with only one knife,
she killed 16 men in ten minutes.

258
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,890
You brought in a really good newcomer!

259
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,240
You bloat too much.

260
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,770
Your team members might save your life some day.

261
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,200
You shouldn't say those words to them.

262
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,970
So long haven't seen you,
can't you say something else?

263
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,840
Something nicer?

264
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,400
Such as "how have you been in two years?"

265
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,540
Or "Nice to meet you again".

266
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,570
Someone has an interest on you.

267
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,030
I know. But why would any one be interested in me,
and who are these people?

268
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,560
I don't know.

269
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,480
What is "Apple Seed"?

270
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,800
I don't know.

271
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,220
I don't want hear such mechanical answer.

272
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,570
Sorry.

273
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,060
Right now, my mission is to protect you.

274
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,330
Mission...

275
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,800
Tomorrow we meet at 9.

276
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,510
So... you are the legendary fighter Deunan Knute.

277
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,210
It's said that you died during the Great War.

278
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,460
Your story at the War of North Africa became a legend.

279
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,690
May I sit here?

280
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,300
Sure.

281
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:07,410
Deunan, how about your father Carl Knute?

282
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,790
He died before the Great War.

283
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,800
Sorry to hear that.

284
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,080
Your mother?

285
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,130
I cannot remember anything about her.

286
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,840
My father didn't tell my anything either.

287
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,360
You and Briareos were lovers, right?

288
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,990
That's when he was still human.

289
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,110
So the body is more important for love.

290
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,340
That's not what I mean.

291
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,200
But to men, the body is a sex symbol none the less.

292
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,080
Well...

293
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,980
What is it like to be in love?

294
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:49,990
Ahh...

295
00:39:50,300 --> 00:3 9:53,950
You know Bioriod's emotions are restrained.

296
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,670
So we don't know what love feels like.

297
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,940
I can learn about it from the readings...

298
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,500
But I never experienced personally.

299
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,610
So I become more and more curious.

300
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,410
On this point, I really envy human beings.

301
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,130
People in love, what are they like?

302
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,490
The feeling of love someone.

303
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:34,410
You bastard! You are only a Bioriod!
How dare you be in front of human!

304
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,170
Olympus military, annoying guys.

305
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,410
Always make a scene.

306
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,370
Synchro-test finished, No problem found.

307
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,780
Only thing left is to adjust the safety belt.

308
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,530
I want to confirm one more time before that.

309
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,010
The reason for the reduction of shock-absorbing is...

310
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,210
I said that already.

311
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,720
Dynamic structure can absorb shock.

312
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,960
But the cartilage has many structures,

313
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,540
joints,
bearings and depressor mechanism are self-restrained,

314
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,190
they will dislocate under too much stress.

315
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,960
Yoshitsune, don't worry. This is Deunan Kunte.

316
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,390
But usually no woman can operate a Land Mate.

317
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,430
Ok, let me try. Help me adjust the safety belt.

318
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,000
Deunan, Yoshitsune is the best mechanics in Olympus.

319
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,200
Only limited to Land Mate though.

320
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,350
Now you are studying the Hecatonchires structure,
right?

321
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,990
Next time let me see the inner structure please.

322
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,710
Forget it, I am blushing.

323
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,450
All secured?

324
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,810
Hmmm, no problem.

325
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,970
Ok, this is the start switch.

326
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,530
First you need to practice, slowly.

327
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,220
Right.

328
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,460
What's happening?

329
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,840
The emergency launch alarm.

330
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,130
Unidentified Land Mates invaded Gaia Research Center!

331
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,010
ESWAT launch immediately!

332
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,750
Stop wasting time, let's move!

333
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,250
Ok like this is fine. I'm moving out.

334
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,720
Like that?!

335
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,540
Deunan

336
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,410
Stop!

337
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,160
The are coming...

338
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,630
Targeting is...

339
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:01,870
Deunan

340
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,510
Hold on, don't come here!

341
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:36,940
Drop the weapon!

342
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Briareos

343
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,470
Sorry

344
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,940
Such foolish actions.

345
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,610
The third generation Bioriod are all destroyed.

346
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,520
The DNA system for life-prolonging procedures
are all destroyed as well.

347
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,310
They came in from the underground elevator shaft.

348
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,690
Seven levels of security system are broken through
in one shot.

349
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,490
No sign of insurgents from outside of Olympus.

350
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,830
We don't know who owns those land mates.

351
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,780
This is too much!

352
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,160
Looks like it is fate that we have to take on
the burden of today's human reality.

353
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,400
No other choice.

354
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,050
From now on,
block all surrounding of Tarutarus and Tartarus.

355
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,120
No one is permitted to access the D-Tank on the top.

356
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:01,790
Yes.

357
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,220
Emergency meeting right now!
