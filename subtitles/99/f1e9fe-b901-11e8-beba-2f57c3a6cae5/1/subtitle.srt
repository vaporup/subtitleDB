Men, are you over 40?

00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:25,195
When you wake up in the morning,
do you feel tired and rundown?

4
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,927
Do you have that listless feeling?

- Jefferies.
- (Man) Congratulations, Jeff.

10
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:06,286
- For what?
- Getting rid of that cast.

11
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,800
Who said I was getting rid of it?

00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,798
(Man Over Telephone)
This is Wednesday.

13
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:14,279
Seven weeks from the day
you broke your leg. Yes or no?

14
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:16,722
(Jefferies) Gunnison, how did
you get to be such a big editor

15
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:18,718
with such a small memory?

16
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,878
Thrift, industry and hard work...

17
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:23,880
and catching the publisher
with his secretary.

18
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:26,038
- Did I get the wrong day?
- (Jefferies) No.

19
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,195
No, wrong week.

20
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:33,122
Next Wednesday I emerge from this...
plaster cocoon.

21
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:37,803
That's too bad, Jeff.
Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day.

22
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:39,195
Forget I called.

23
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,835
(Jefferies) Yeah, I sure feel
sorry for you, Gunnison.

24
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:45,916
Must be rough on you thinking of me
wearing this cast for another week.

25
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:48,681
That one week is gonna cost
me my best photographer,

26
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,644
and you a big assignment.

27
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:51,796
Where?

28
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,719
(Gunnison) There's no point
in even talking about it.

29
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,559
(Jefferies)
Oh, come on, come on. Where?

30
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:59,402
Kashmir. Got a code tip from
the bureau chief this morning.

31
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,398
The place is about to go up in smoke.

32
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,445
What did I tell you? Didrt I tell
you that's the next place to watch?

33
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:07,201
- (Gunnison) You did.
- (Jefferies) When do I leave? Hour?

34
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:11,565
- With that cast on? You don't.
- Stop sounding stuffy.

35
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:15,402
I can take pictures from a jeep
or a water buffalo, if necessary.

36
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:18,604
(Gunnison) You're too valuable to the
magazine for us to play around with.

37
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,281
- I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
- (Jefferies) Morgan or Lambert.

38
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,085
That's fine.

39
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:25,556
I get myself half-killed for you,

40
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:27,922
and you reward me
by stealing my assignments.

41
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,726
(Gunnison) I didn't ask you to stand in
the middle of an automobile racetrack.

42
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:34,844
(Jefferies) You asked for something
dramatically different.

43
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:37,441
- You got it.
- (Gunnison) So did you.

44
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:39,518
- Goodbye, Jeff.
- Now, wait a minute, Gunnison.

45
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,484
You've got to get me out of here.

46
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,037
Six weeks sitting
in a two-room apartment

47
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,357
with nothing to do but look out
the window at the neighbours.

48
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,199
- Bye, Jeff.
- No, Gunnison, I...

49
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,720
If you don't pull me out
of this swamp of boredom,

50
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,400
I'm gonna do something drastic.

51
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,683
- (Gunnison) Like what?
- (Jefferies) "Like what?" Get married.

52
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:57,724
Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.

53
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,206
(Gunnison)
It's about time you got married,

54
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:03,758
before you turn into
a lonesome and bitter, old man.

55
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:05,963
Yeah, can't you just see me?

00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:08,883

and the electric dishwasher

58

and the garbage disposal
and the nagging wife.

59
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:20,758
(Gunnison) Jeff, wives don't nag
any more, they discuss.

60
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,157
(Jeff) Is that so? Is that so?

61
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,716
Maybe in the high-rent district
they discuss.

62
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,957
In my neighbourhood, they still nag.

63
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:31,961
(Gunnison) Well, you know best.
I'll call you later.

64

the next time, huh?

if I were you.

70
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:54,757
You're giving them far too much water.

71
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,565
Why don't you shut up?

72
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,086
Well!

73
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:03,720
I do declare.

74
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:07,276
(Woman) State sentence
for a peeping tom,

75
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:08,960
is six months in the workhouse.

76
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:10,401
Oh, hello, sweetheart.

77
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,956
They got no windows in the workhouse.

78
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:16,802
In the old days, they used to put
your eyes out with a red-hot poker.

79
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:19,879
Any of those bikini bombshells
you're always watching

80
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:21,605
won'th a red-hot poker?

81
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,564
Oh, dear.

82
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:26,321
We've become a race of Peeping Toms.

83
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:28,603
What people ought to do
is get outside their own house

84
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,246
and look in for a change.

85
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:33,922
Yes, sir. How's that for
a bit of homespun philosophy?

86

Reader's Digest, April 1939.

87
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:38,762
Well, I only quote from the best.

88
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:40,645
You don't have to take
my temperature this morning.

89
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:43,367
Quiet. See if you can break 100.

90
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,722
You know, I should have been
a gypsy fortune-teller

91
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:48,082
instead of an insurance company nurse.

92
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:52,035
I got a nose for trouble.
Can smell it ten miles away.

93
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:56,166
You heard of that market crash in '29?
I predicted that.

94
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:58,438
Just how did you do that, Stella?

95
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:03,203
Oh, simple. I was nursing
a director of General Motors.

96
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:07,519
"Kidney ailment," they said.
"Nerves," I said.

97
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:09,006
Then I asked myself,

98
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,204
"W hat's General Motors
got to be nervous about?"

99
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,518
"Overproduction," I says. "Collapse."

100
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:18,918
When General Motors has to go
to the bathroom ten times a day,

101
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:21,317
the whole country's ready to let go.

102
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,396
You know, Stella,
in economics, a kidney ailment

103
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,205
has no relationship to the stock market.

104
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:30,285
- None whatsoever.
- (Stella) Crashed, didn't it?

105
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:33,484
I can smell trouble
right here in this apartment.

106
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:35,046
First you smash your leg,

107
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,960
then you get
to looking out the window,

108
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:40,038
see things you shouldn't see.

109
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:41,925
Trouble.

110
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,725
I can see you in court now

111
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:47,038
surrounded by a bunch of lawyers
in double-breasted suits.

112
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,196
You're pleading.

113
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:52,155
You say, "Judge,
it was only a bit of innocent fun.

114
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:55,046
I love my neighbours, like a father."

115
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:57,277
And the judge says,
"Well, congratulations.

116
00:09:57,447 --> 00:10:00,564
You've just given birth
to three years in Dannamora."

117
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,116
Right now, I'd welcome trouble.

118
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:04,720
You've got a hormone deficiency.

119
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:06,400
How can you tell from a thermometer?

120
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,319
Those bathing beauties
you've been watching

121
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:12,719
haven't raised your temperature
one degree in a month.

122
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,558
Here we go.

123
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:22,643
(Sighs) One more week.

124
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:27,638
(Groans) I think you're right.

125
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:29,763
I think there is gonna be
trouble around here.

126
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:31,280
I knew it.

127
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:34,484
Ooh. Do you ever heat that stuff?

128
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:37,445
Gives your
circulation something to fight.

129
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:40,758
- What kind of trouble?
- Lisa Fremont.

130
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:43,361
You kidding?
She's a beautiful, young girl,

131
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:46,360
and you're a reasonably
healthy young man.

132
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:49,087
- She expects me to marry her.
- That's normal.

133
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:51,317
- I don't want to.
- That's abnormal.

134
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:53,762
I'm just not ready for marriage.

135
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:56,919
Every mars ready for marriage
when the right girl comes along.

136
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:59,601
Lisa Fremont is the right girl
for any man with half a brain

137
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,086
who can get one eye open.

138
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,680
She's alright.

139
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:04,997
- What did you do, have a fight?
- No.

140
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,681
- Father loading up the shotgun?
- What?

141
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,077
- Please, Stella.
- It's happened before, you know.

142
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:12,761
Some of the world's
happiest marriages have

143
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,918
started 'under the gun,'
as you might say.

144
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:17,806
- No, she's just not the girl for me.
- Yeah, she's only perfect.

145
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,958
She's too perfect. She's too talented.

146
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,516
She's too beautiful.
She's too sophisticated.

147
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,917
She's too everything, but what I want.

148
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,204
Is what you want
something you can discuss?

149
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,437
What? It's very simple, Stella.

150
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,043
She belongs to that rarefied
atmosphere of Park Avenue:

151
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:37,563
expensive restaurants
and literary cocktail parties.

152
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:39,558
People with sense
belong wherever they're put.

153
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:42,446
Can you imagine her tramping around
the world with a camera bum

154
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,837
who never has more than
a week's salary in the bank?

155
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:47,362
If she was only ordinary.

156
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,839
You never gonna get married?

157
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,725
I'll probably get married
one of these days,

158
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:54,276
but when I do, it's gonna be
to someone who thinks of life

159
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,599
not just as a new dress
and a lobster dinner

160
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,837
and the latest scandal.

161
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:04,044
I need a woman who's willing to...
Hold it.

162
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:07,882
Who's willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it.

163
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:11,244
So the honest thing for me to do
is just call the whole thing off.

164
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,079
Let her find somebody else.

165
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:15,078
Yeah, I can hear you now.

166
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:18,956
"Get out of my life,
you perfectly wonderful woman."

167
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,118
Look, Mr Jefferies,
I'm not an educated woman,

168
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,164
but I can tell you one thing.

169
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,444
When a man and a woman see
each other and like each other,

170
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,518
they ought to come together, wham,

171
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:30,439
like a couple of taxis on Broadway

172
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:32,996
and not sit around analysing each other

173
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,805
like two specimens in a bottle.

174
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,845
There's an intelligent way
to approach marriage.

175
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,076
Intelligence.

176
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:42,842
Nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence.

177
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:45,282
(Laughs) Modern marriage.

178
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:49,076
- No, we've progressed emotionally.
- Baloney.

179
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:53,726
Once it was see somebody,
get excited, get married.

180
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,206
Now, it's read a lot of books,

181
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,837
fence with a lot of four-syllable
words, psychoanalyse each other

182
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,486
until you can't tell the difference

183
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,605
between a petting party
and a civil service exam.

184
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:07,241
People have different emotional levels -

185
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:10,797
When I married Myles, we were both
a couple of maladjusted misfits.

186
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:16,087
We are still maladjusted, and we
have loved every minute of it.

187
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:17,282
Well, that's fine, Stella.

188
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:19,244
Now, would you
fix me a sandwich, please?

189
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:23,241
Yes, I will. And I'll spread
a little common sense on the bread.

190
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:26,126
Lisa's loaded to her fingertips
with love for you.

191
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:29,006
I got two words of advice
for you: Marry her.

192
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,727
- She pay you much?
- Oh.

193
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,878
(Chuckling)

194
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,964
There you are.

195
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,206
- Here's the key.
- Thank you.

196
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:05,484
Well, if you want anything, just ring.

197
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,886
Honey.

198
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:20,800
Come on.

199
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,605
Got to carry you over the threshold.

200
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,598
Window shopper.

201
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:58,442
(Piano, Woman Vocalising)

202
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:12,798
(Children Talking In Distance)

203
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,438
(Children Shouting Playfully)

204
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,798
How's your leg?

205
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,798
It hurts a little.

206
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:48,755
- And your stomach?
- Empty as a football.

207
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,637
And your love life?

208
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:55,037
Not too active.

209
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:57,402
Anything else bothering you?

210
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,478
Mm-hm.

211
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:01,638
Who are you?

212
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,318
Reading from top to bottom:

213
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:07,480
Lisa...

214
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:12,160
Carol...

215
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,446
Fremont.

216
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:21,964
Is this the Lisa Fremont who
never wears the same dress twice?

217
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:24,687
Only because it's expected of her.

218
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:26,803
It's right off the Paris plane.

219
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:29,879
- Do you think it'll sell?
- That depends on the quote.

220
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:32,083
Let's see now.
There's the aeroplane ticket over,

221
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:34,238
import duties, hidden taxes,

222
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:37,205
- profit markup -
- A steal at $1,100.

223
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:39,597
Eleven hundred?

224
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:42,122
They ought to list that dress
on the stock exchange.

225
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,881
We sell a dozen a day
in this price range.

226
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,446
Who buys them, tax collectors?

227
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,598
Even if I had to pay,
it would be won'th it.

228
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:51,839
- Just for the occasion.
- Why, is something big going on?

229
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:54,441
It's going on right here. It's a big night.

230
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:57,883
It's just an old
run-of-the-mill Wednesday.

231
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,446
The calendar's full of them.

232
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:04,317
It's opening night of the last depressing
week of L B Jefferies in a cast.

233
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:07,957
Well, I haven't noticed
a big demand for tickets.

234
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,800
That's because I bought out the house.

235
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:14,437
You know, this cigarette box
has seen better days.

236
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:17,804
I picked that up in Shanghai,
which has also seen better days.

237
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,162
It's cracked and you never use it.

238
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,045
It's too ornate.

239
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,756
I'm sending up a plain, flat,
silver one with your initials.

240
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:28,395
That's no way to spend
your hard-earned money.

241
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,398
I wanted to.

242
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,160
Ooh!

243
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:35,995
What would you think of
starting off with dinner at '21 '?

244
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,806
You have, perhaps,
an ambulance downstairs?

245
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:41,800
No, better than that: '21 '.

246
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:50,157
Thank you for waiting, Carl.
The kitchers right there on the left.

247
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,318
I'll take the wine.

248
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,279
- Good evening, Mr Jefferies.
- Carl.

249
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:59,484
Just put everything
in the oven, Carl, on low.

250
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:02,559
- Let's open the wine now.
- (Jeff) Alright.

251
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:05,480
- It's a Montrachet.
- A great big glassful.

252
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:08,639
There's a corkscrew right over there.

253
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:10,638
Here, I'll do it.

254
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,475
- Big enough?
- Yeah, they're fine.

255
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,036
I can't think of anything more
boring or tiresome

256
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:20,438
than what you've been through
and the last week must be the hardest.

257
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:24,725
Alright. Yeah, I want to get
this thing off and get moving.

258
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:29,039
Well, I'm going to make this
a week you'll never forget.

259
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:32,557
Fine, thanks.

260
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:34,479
Just a minute, Carl.

261
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,286
- This will take care of the taxi.
- Thank you, Miss Fremont.

262
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:41,963
- Have a pleasant dinner, Mr Jefferies.
- Alright, Good night.

263
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:43,446
Good night.

264
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:46,641
What a day I've had.

265
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:49,116
- Are you tired?
- Not a bit.

266
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:50,766
I was all morning in a meeting,

267
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,283
then I had to dash to the Waldorf
for a quick drink with Madam Dufrene,

268
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:57,757
who's just over from Paris
with some spy reports.

269
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:02,595
Then I had to go to '21' and have lunch
with the Harper's Bazaar people.

270
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,519
That's when I ordered dinner.

271
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,565
Then I had two fall showings
20 blocks apart.

272
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:09,763
Then I had to have a cocktail
with Leland and Slim Hayward.

273
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:11,645
We're trying to get his new show.

274
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,525
Then I had to dash back and change.

275
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:17,919
Well, now, tell me,
what was Mrs Hayward wearing?

276
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,839
- She looked wonderfully cool.
- She didn't, did she?

277
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,885
She had on the most divine
Italian hand-printed -

278
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,038
- Oh, Italian?
- Oh, you.

279
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,597
- Italian. Imagine.
- To think I planted three nice items

280
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,962
- in the columns about you today.
- You did?

281
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:34,199
- You can't buy that kind of publicity.
- I know.

282
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:38,042
Someday you may want to
open up a studio of your own here.

283
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:41,244
How would I run it from, say, Pakistan?

284
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,399
Jeff...

285
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:48,801
Isn't it time you came home?
You could pick your assignment.

286
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,038
- I wish there was one I wanted.
- Make the one you want.

287
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:54,845
- You mean leave the magazine?
- Yes.

288
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,965
- For what?
- For yourself and me.

289
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:00,919
I could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow:

290
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:02,839
- Fashions, portraits.
- (Chuckles)

291
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:06,397
- Now, don't laugh. I could do it.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

292
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:09,764
Can you see me driving down
to the fashion salon in a jeep

293
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:13,886
wearing combat boots and a three-day
beard? Wouldrt that make a hit?

294
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:16,805
I could see you looking
very handsome and successful

295
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,844
in a dark blue, flannel suit.

296
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:22,079
Let's stop talking nonsense, shall we?

297
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:23,680
Hm?

298
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,002
Guess I'd better
start setting up for dinner.

299
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:41,079
(Bing Crosby) # To see you

# how well I know you

318
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:41,565

# Tonight #

327
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,446
(Jeff) Miss Lonelyhearts.

328
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:32,725
At least that's something
you'll never have to worry about.

329
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:34,115
Oh?

330
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:37,882
You can see my apartment from here,
all the way up on 63rd Street?

331
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:40,925
No, not exactly,
but we have a little apartment here

332
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:43,203
that's probably as popular as yours.

333
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:47,599
You remember, of course,
Miss Torso, the ballet dancer?

334
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:51,555
She's like a queen bee
with her pick of the drones.

335
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,358
(Lisa) I'd say she's
doing a womars hardest job.

336
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:04,199
Juggling wolves.

337
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:12,204
Thank you.

338
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:26,165
Well, she picked the most
prosperous-looking one.

339
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:29,125
She's not in love with him...
or any of them.

340
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:32,040
Oh, how can you tell that from here?

341
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:36,880
You said it resembled
my apartment, didn't you?

00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:53,761

347
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,763
Where's that
wonderful music coming from?

348
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:21,158
Some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment.

349
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:22,555
Well...

350
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:24,445
He lives alone.

351
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:28,077
Probably had a very unappy marriage.

352
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:30,363
Oh, it's enchanting.

353
00:25:32,607 --> 00:25:36,122
It's almost as if it were
being written especially for us.

354
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:39,279
Hm. No wonder he's having
so much trouble with it.

355
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:44,839
At least you can't say
the dinner isn't right.

356
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:48,799
Lisa... it's perfect.

357
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:51,800
As always.

358
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:05,640
There can't be that much difference
between people and the way they live.

We all eat, talk, drink,
laugh, wear clothes.

360
00:26:08,327 --> 00:26:09,646
Well, now look -

361
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:12,116
If you're saying all this because
you don't want to tell me the truth,

362
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:14,755
because you're hiding something from
me, then maybe I can understand.

363
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:16,485
I'm not hiding anything. It's just that -

364
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:17,875
It doesn't make sense.

365
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:21,039
What's so different about it here
from there or anyplace you go

366
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,516
that one person couldn't live
in both places just as easily?

367
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:25,120
Some people can.
Now, if you'll just let me -

368
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:28,120
What is it but travelling from
one place to another taking pictures?

369
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,357
It's like being a tourist
on an endless vacation.

370
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:32,802
OK. That's your opinion.
You're entitled to it.

371
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,764
- Now, let me give you my side.
- It's ridiculous to say

372
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:38,636
that it can only be done by a special,
private little group of anointed people.

373
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,765
I made a simple statement,
a true statement,

374
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:44,395
but I can back it up if you'll just
shut up for a minute.

375
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:48,359
If your opinion is as rude as your
manner, I don't think I care to hear it.

376
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:50,358
Oh, come on now. Simmer down.

377
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,916
I can't fit in here. You can't fit in there.

378
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:55,043
According to you, people
should be born, live and die

379
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:57,118
- on the same spot!
- Shut up!

380
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:03,926
- Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
- Of course not.

381
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,317
Well, you might have to
if you went with me.

382
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:09,843
Did you ever try to keep warm
in a C-54 at 15,000 feet,

383
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:11,998
20 degrees below zero?

384
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,646
Oh, I do it all the time,

385
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:15,559
whenever I have
a few minutes after lunch.

386
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:17,604
Did you ever get shot at? Run over?

387
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:18,882
Did you ever get sandbagged

388
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:22,039
because somebody got unfavourable
publicity from your camera?

389
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:25,086
Did you ever... Those high heels,
they'll be great in the jungle.

390
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:27,158
And the nylons
and those six-ounce lingerie.

391
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:28,965
- Three.
- Alright, three.

392
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:32,119
They'll make a big hit in Finland,
just before you freeze to death.

393
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:35,677
Well, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to wear the proper clothes.

394
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:36,836
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:40,522
Well, try and find a raincoat in Brazil,
even when it isn't raining.

396
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:43,963
Lisa, in this job you carry one suitcase.

397
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:46,402
Your home
is the available transportation.

398
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,478
You don't sleep very much.
You bathe less.

399
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:50,717
And sometimes the food that you eat

400
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:53,640
is made from things that you couldn't
even look at when they're alive.

401
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:57,877
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately
repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.

402
00:27:58,047 --> 00:28:00,845
Deliberately repulsive?
I'm trying to make it sound good.

403
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:04,283
You just have to face it, Lisa,
you're not meant for that kind of a life.

404
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:05,841
Few people are.

405
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:12,562
- You're too stubborn to argue with.
- I'm not stubborn. I'm just truthful.

406
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:16,083
I know, a lesser man would have
told me it was one long holiday,

407
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:19,876
and I would have awakened
to a rude disillusionment.

408
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,526
Well, now, wait a minute.

409
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:25,801
If you want to get vicious on this thing,
I'd be happy to accommodate you.

410
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:31,803
No, I don't particularly want that.

411
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:34,886
So that's it?

412
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,197
You won't stay here,
and I can't go with you.

413
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:39,765
It would be the wrong thing.

414
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:44,595
You don't think either one
of us could ever change?

415
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:48,038
Right now it doesn't seem so.

416
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,365
l-I'm in love with you.

417
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:57,963
I don't care what you do for a living.

418
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,436
I'd like to be part of it somehow.

419
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:05,565
It's deflating to find out
the only way I can be part of it,

420
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:09,845
is to take out a subscription
to your magazine.

421
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:11,884
I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.

422
00:29:13,207 --> 00:29:14,720
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa.

423
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:17,640
You've got this town
in the palm of your hand.

424
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:21,443
Not quite, it seems.

425
00:29:23,207 --> 00:29:24,560

- Well, Lisa...

couldn't we just...

429
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:36,640
Couldrt we just...
keep things status quo?

431
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:42,679

would have cooled things off.

- All it did was make the heat wet.
- Ahh, that's it.

out that window for hours.

Yeah.

It might just be that the salesman
will be available soon.

Oh, him and his wife splitting up?

479
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:33,685
I just can't figure it.

480
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:36,042
He went out several times
last night in the rain,

481
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:39,279
- carrying his sample case.
- Well, he's a salesman, isn't he?

482
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,722
What would he be selling
at three o'clock in the morning?

Luminous dials for watches.

485
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:49,286
I don't think so.

486
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:50,926
I don't think so.

487
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,403
I think he was taking
something out of the apartment.

488
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:57,162
Uh-huh. His personal effects.

489
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:01,405
He's gonna run out on her, the coward.

490
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:04,764
Yeah. Sometimes it's worse
to stay than it is to run.

491
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:10,718
Yeah, well, it takes a particularly low
type of man to do a thing like that.

492
00:37:11,007 --> 00:37:12,599
How about this morning?

493
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:14,644

Get back! He'll see you.

I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.

503

511
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:15,765
- # (Piano)
- Uh-huh.

512
00:38:22,727 --> 00:38:25,639
- And don't sleep in that chair again.
- Uh-huh.

513
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:30,323
"Uh-huh. Uh-huh."
Great conversationalist.

514
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:33,206
Stella...

515
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:37,486
Take those binoculars out
and bring them here, will you?

516
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,126
Trouble.

517
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:41,357
I can smell it.

518
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,405
I'll be glad when they crack
that cast, and I can get outta here.

519
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:46,398
Uh-huh.

520
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:23,878
# (Piano)

521
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:36,358
# (Piano Resumes)

522
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:40,961
# (Whistling)

523
00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:48,279
(Barking)

524
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:51,883
# (Whistling Tune)

525
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:16,084
How far does a girl have to go
before you'll notice her?

526
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:19,876
Well, if she's pretty enough,
she doesn't have to go anywhere.

527
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:22,003
She just has to 'be.'

528
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,044
Well, ain't I?

529
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:26,243
Pay attention to me.

530
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:31,797
I'm not exactly
on the other side of the room.

531
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:36,597
Your mind is... and when
I want a man, I want all of him.

532
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:43,240
Don't you ever have any problems?

533
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,443
I have one now.

534
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:47,999
So do I.

535
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:51,002
Tell me about it.

536
00:42:52,927 --> 00:42:54,519
Why?

537
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:58,443
Why would a man leave
his apartment three times

538
00:42:58,607 --> 00:43:03,317
on a rainy night with a suitcase,
and come back three times?

539
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:07,196
He likes the way his wife
welcomes him home.

540
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:09,881
No, no. Not this salesmars wife.

541
00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:11,958
And why didn't he go to work today?

542
00:43:12,127 --> 00:43:15,642
Homework. It's more interesting.

543
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:20,119
What's interesting about a butcher knife

544
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:22,676
and a small saw

545
00:43:23,127 --> 00:43:25,436
wrapped in newspaper?

546
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:27,484
Nothing, thank heaven.

547
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,445
Why hasn't he been
in his wife's bedroom all day?

548
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:33,360
I wouldn't dare answer that.

549
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:36,641
Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.

550
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:40,243
There's something terribly wrong.

551
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:45,358
- (Lisa) And I'm afraid it's with me.
- What do you think?

552
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:50,277
Something too frightful to utter.

553
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:53,598
(Jeff) He went out a few minutes
ago in his undershirt, hasn't come back.

554
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:09,360
That would be a terrible job to tackle.

555
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:14,437
# (Piano)

556
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:17,607
Just how would you start
to cut up a human body?

557
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:23,798
Jeff, I'll be honest with you.
You're beginning to scare me.

558
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:30,196
Jeff, did you hear what I said?
You're beginning to scare -

559
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,720
Shh! He's coming back!

560
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:02,006
- Jeff, if you could only see yourself!
- What's the matter?

561
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,556
Sitting around looking out of the
window to kill time is one thing,

562
00:45:04,727 --> 00:45:07,116
but doing it the way
you are with binoculars

563
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:11,200
and wild opinions about every
little thing you see is diseased!

564
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:13,722
Do you think I consider it recreation?

565
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:15,639
I don't know what you consider it,

566
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:17,877
but if you don't stop it,
I'm getting out of here.

567
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,197
- What's the -
- What is it you're looking for?

568
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:22,881
I just want to find out what's
the matter with the salesmars wife.

569
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:24,685
Does that make me
sound like a madman?

570
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,485
What makes you think there's
something the matter with her?

571
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:29,923
A lot of things. She's an invalid.
She demands constant care.

572
00:45:30,087 --> 00:45:35,320
Yet not the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day. Why?

573
00:45:35,847 --> 00:45:38,486
- Maybe she died.
- (Jeff) Where's the doctor?

574
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:39,796
Where's the undertaker?

575
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,527
She could be sleeping, under sedatives.

576
00:45:42,687 --> 00:45:45,884
He's in there now.
There's nothing to see.

577
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:47,958
There is something.
I've seen it through that window.

578
00:45:48,127 --> 00:45:50,880
I've seen bickering and family quarrels

579
00:45:51,047 --> 00:45:52,116
and mysterious trips at night

580
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:54,039
and knives and saws and rope.

581
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:57,165
Now, since last evening, not a sign
of the wife. Tell me where she is.

582
00:45:57,327 --> 00:45:58,999
- I don't know.
- What's she doing?

583
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,125
Maybe he's leaving his wife.
I don't know. I don't care!

584
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:05,359
Lots of people have knives and saws
and ropes around their houses.

585
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:08,087
And lots of men don't speak
to their wives all day.

586
00:46:08,247 --> 00:46:10,636
Lots of wives nag and
men hate them and trouble starts,

587
00:46:10,807 --> 00:46:14,561
but few of them end up in murder,
if that's what you're thinking.

588
00:46:14,727 --> 00:46:16,957
It's pretty hard for you to keep
away from that word, isn't it?

589
00:46:17,127 --> 00:46:19,083
You could see all that he did,
couldn't you?

590
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:21,283
- Of course, I -
- You could see cos the shades were up

591
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:24,917
and he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard.

592
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:26,076
I've seen him -

593
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:28,841
Jeff, do you think a murderer
would let you see all that?

594
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:31,726
That he wouldn't pull the shades
down and hide behind them?

595
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:33,764
He's being clever. He's being nonchalant.

596
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:35,963
And that's
where you're not bring clever.

597
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:39,278
A murderer would never parade
his crime in front of an open window.

598
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:40,436
Why not?

599
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:43,883
For all you know, there's
something sinister going on there.

600
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:47,116
Where? Oh.

601
00:46:48,407 --> 00:46:50,716
(Laughs) No comment.

602
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,962
Let's start
from the beginning again, Jeff.

603
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:19,039
Tell me everything you saw

604
00:47:19,207 --> 00:47:22,279
and what you think it means.

605
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:34,485
- (Telephone Rings)
- Yeah?

606
00:47:34,647 --> 00:47:36,046
(Lisa) "The name on the second floor

607
00:47:36,207 --> 00:47:39,199
rear mail box reads,
'Mr and Mrs Lars'."

608
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:41,722
"That's L-a-r-s."

609
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:43,718
"Lars Thorwald."

610
00:47:43,887 --> 00:47:45,286
What's the number of the apartment?

611
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:48,962
(Lisa) "125 West Ninth Street."

612
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:50,242
Thank you, dear.

613
00:47:50,407 --> 00:47:52,557
(Lisa) "OK, chief.
What's my next assignment?"

614
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:54,718
Just go home.

615
00:47:54,887 --> 00:47:57,401
(Lisa)
"Alright, but what's he doing now?"

616
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:01,242
He's just sitting
in the living room in the dark.

617
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:03,875
Hasrt gone near the bedroom.

618
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,800
Now you go home
and get some sleep. Good night.

619
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,559
(Lisa) "Good night."

620
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:18,440
(Man) "What's it about, Jeff?"

621
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:21,519
Look, Doyle,
I can't tell you over the phone.

622
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:23,962
You have to be here
and see the whole set-up.

623
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:28,200
It's probably nothing.
It's just a little neighbourhood murder.

624
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:31,279
- (Doyle) "Did you say murder?"
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

625
00:48:31,447 --> 00:48:32,516
(Doyle) "Oh, come now."

626
00:48:32,687 --> 00:48:35,155
My only thought was throwing a little
business your way, that's all.

627
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,478
I figured a detective would jump at
the chance of something to detect.

628
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:40,285
- (Doyle) "I'm not working."
- What?

629
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,721
(Doyle)
"This happens to be my day off."

630
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:44,640
I usually took my best pictures
on my day off.

631
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:48,356
- (Doyle) "I'll drop by."
- OK, Doyle. As soon as you can.

632
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,604
Bless your heart, Stella.

633
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:53,359
Gee whiz, look at this.

634
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:55,802
I can't tell you
what a welcome sight this is.

635
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,366
No wonder your husband still loves you.

636
00:48:57,527 --> 00:48:58,926
- The police.
- What?

637
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:02,124
- You called the police.
- Well, not exactly.

638
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:05,438
Not an official call.
It's an old friend of mine.

639
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:08,565
An old, ornery friend of mine.

640
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:12,800
Just where do you suppose
he cut her up?

641
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:16,198
Of course. The bathtub.

642
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:21,282
That's the only place where
he could have washed away the blood.

643
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:33,443
He better get that trunk out
of there before it starts to leak.

644
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:39,086
(Children Playing)

645
00:49:52,927 --> 00:49:55,395
(Newlywed Wife) Harry?

646
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:01,085
Look, look, Mr Jefferies.

647
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:39,677
I thought Doyle would be here
by the time the trunk left,

648
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:42,042
or I'd have called the police.
Now we're gonna lose it.

649
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:43,845
- Hold everything.
- Don't do anything foolish.

650
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,599
I'm just gonna get the name
off that freight truck.

651
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:48,406
I'll keep an eye on the alley.

652
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,246
Long distance.

653
00:51:06,207 --> 00:51:07,879
(Truck Departing)

654
00:51:26,527 --> 00:51:29,837
You didn't see the killing or the body.
How do you know there was a murder?

655
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:32,840
Because everything this fellow's done
has been suspicious:

656
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,363
Trips at night in the rain,
knives and saws and trunks with rope,

657
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:38,518
and now this wife
that isn't there any more.

658
00:51:38,687 --> 00:51:41,326
I admit it all has a mysterious sound.

659
00:51:41,487 --> 00:51:45,036
It could be any number of things.
Murder's the least possible.

660
00:51:45,207 --> 00:51:47,084
Doyle, don't tell me
he's an unemployed magician,

661
00:51:47,247 --> 00:51:48,999
amusing the neighbourhood
with his sleight of hand.

662
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:50,202
Don't tell me that.

663
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:52,403
It's too obvious and stupid
a way to commit murder.

664
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,205
In full view of 50 windows?

665
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:56,756
Then sit there smoking a cigar,
waiting for the police to pick him up.

666
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:59,441
Alright, officer, do your duty.
Go over and pick him up.

667
00:51:59,607 --> 00:52:02,644
Jeff, you've got a lot
to learn about homicide.

668
00:52:02,807 --> 00:52:04,604
Why, morons have committed
murder so shrewdly,

669
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:07,998
it's taken a hundred trained
police minds to catch them.

670
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:10,362
That salesman wouldn't just
knock his wife off after dinner

671
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,916
and toss her in the trunk
and put her in storage.

672
00:52:13,287 --> 00:52:14,481
I'll bet it's been done.

673
00:52:14,647 --> 00:52:17,798
Most everything's been done...
under panic.

674
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:19,639
This is a thousand-to-one shot.

675
00:52:19,807 --> 00:52:22,446
He's still sitting around the apartment.
That mars not panicked.

676
00:52:23,047 --> 00:52:25,083
You think I made all this up?

677
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:26,965
Well, I think you saw something

678
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:29,482
there's probably
a very simple explanation for.

679
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,400
- For instance?
- Wife took a trip.

680
00:52:32,727 --> 00:52:34,319
His wife was sick in bed.

681
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,322
Yeah, so you told me.

682
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:41,721
Well, Jeff, I've got to run along.

683
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:47,917
I won't report this to the department.
Let me poke into it a little on my own.

684
00:52:48,087 --> 00:52:50,555
No sense in your getting
a lot of ridiculous publicity.

685
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:52,001
Thank you.

686
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:57,040
We know the wife is gone,
so I'll see if I can find out where.

687
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,526
Do that.

688
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:01,637
You had any headaches lately?

689
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:03,126
Not till you showed up.

690
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:07,045
It will wear off,
along with the hallucinations.

691
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:08,356
See you around.

692
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:13,682
(Dog Whining)

693
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:34,606
- Get along.
- (Barks)

694
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:55,082
He has a six months' lease.

695
00:53:55,247 --> 00:53:58,045
Used up a little more than
five and a half months of it.

696
00:53:58,207 --> 00:54:00,482
He's quiet,
drinks, but not to drunkenness.

697
00:54:00,647 --> 00:54:02,205
Pays his bills promptly
with money earned

698
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:05,006
as a costume jewellery salesman:
wholesale.

699
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:08,000
Kept to himself. No neighbours
got close to him or his wife.

700
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:09,839
Yeah, well, I think
they missed their chance with her.

701
00:54:10,007 --> 00:54:12,760
She never left the apartment,
until yesterday morning.

702
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:15,077
- What time?
- 6:00am.

703
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:17,283
6:00am.

704
00:54:17,447 --> 00:54:20,280
I think that's
about the time I fell asleep.

705
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:21,721
Too bad.

706
00:54:21,887 --> 00:54:25,721
Thorwalds were leaving
their apartment at just that time.

707
00:54:26,527 --> 00:54:28,597
Feel a little foolish?

708
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:30,758
No, not yet.

709
00:54:41,447 --> 00:54:44,757
- How's your wife?
- Oh, she's fine.

710
00:54:48,007 --> 00:54:49,235
Who said they left then?

711
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:53,280
- W-Who left where?
- (Jeff) The Thorwalds, at 6:00am.

712
00:54:53,447 --> 00:54:56,120
Oh, the building superintendent
and two tenants.

713
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:59,006
Flat statements, no hesitation.
They jived with the letter.

714
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:01,476
Thorwalds were on their way
to the railroad station.

715
00:55:01,647 --> 00:55:04,844
Well, now, Tom, how could
anybody possibly guess that?

716
00:55:05,007 --> 00:55:06,725
What, did they have signs
on their luggage saying,

717
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,115
'Grand Central, or bust'?

718
00:55:09,047 --> 00:55:11,641
The superintendent
met Thorwald on his way back.

719
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:14,685
Thorwald told him that he'd put
his wife on a train to the country.

720
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:17,725
I see. I'd say this is a pretty
convenient guy, this superintendent.

721
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:20,082
Have you checked
his bank statements lately?

722
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:25,437
- Huh?
- Well, what good's his information?

723
00:55:25,647 --> 00:55:29,481
It's a secondhand version of
an unsupported story by the murderer.

724
00:55:29,647 --> 00:55:33,083
Now did anybody actually see
the wife get on the train?

725
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,876
I hate to remind you,

726
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:36,958
but this all started because
you said she was murdered.

727
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,241
Now, did anyone, including you,
actually see her murdered?

728
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:42,363
(Stammering) What are you doing?

729
00:55:42,527 --> 00:55:45,758
Are you interested in solving
this case or making me look foolish?

730
00:55:46,807 --> 00:55:48,365
Well, if possible, both.

731
00:55:48,527 --> 00:55:50,165
Then do a good job of it.

732
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:51,999
Go over there and search
Thorwald's apartment.

733
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:53,600
It must be knee-deep in evidence.

734
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,041
I can't do that.

735
00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:57,562
(Jeff) I don't mean right now,
but when he goes out for a drink,

736
00:55:57,727 --> 00:55:59,797
or a paper, or something.
What he doesn't know won't hurt him.

737
00:55:59,967 --> 00:56:01,639
I can't do that even if he isn't there.

738
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:03,957
(Stammering) What's he...

739
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,641
Does he have a courtesy card from
the police department or something?

740
00:56:06,807 --> 00:56:08,718
Now don't get me mad.

741
00:56:08,887 --> 00:56:11,879
Not even a detective can walk
into an apartment and search it.

742
00:56:12,047 --> 00:56:14,880
If I were caught in there, they'd
have my badge within ten minutes.

743
00:56:15,047 --> 00:56:17,117
(Jeff) Make sure
you don't get caught, that's all.

744
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:19,887
If you find something,
you've got a murderer,

745
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:21,526
and they don't care about
a couple of house rules.

746
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:23,598
If you don't find anything,
the fellow's clear.

747
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:25,723
At the risk of sounding stuffy,

748
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:29,277
I'd like to remind you
of the Constitution and the phrase,

749
00:56:29,447 --> 00:56:32,837
'search warrant issued by a judge'
who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim.

750
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:36,283
- He must ask for evidence.
- Give him evidence.

751
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,605
Yeah, I can hear myself,

752
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:44,602
"Your Honour, I have a friend
who's an amateur sleuth."

753
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:47,804
"The other night, after
having a heavy dinner, he..."

754
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:50,800
He'd throw the New York State
penal code in my face,

755
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:52,082
and there's six volumes.

756
00:56:53,287 --> 00:56:55,801
By tomorrow morning there
may not be any evidence left

757
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:57,605
over in that apartment, you know that.

758
00:56:58,167 --> 00:56:59,486
It's a detective's nightmare.

759
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,878
(Stammering) What do you need
before you can search?

760
00:57:03,047 --> 00:57:04,275
Tell me now, what do you need?

761
00:57:04,447 --> 00:57:06,483
Bloody footsteps
leading up to the door?

762
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:10,276
One thing I don't need is heckling.
You called me and asked for help.

763
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:13,439
Now you're behaving like a taxpayer.

764
00:57:13,607 --> 00:57:15,518

stand each other in that plane

765

Find the trunk. Mrs Thorwald's in it.

Oh, I almost forgot.

772
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:32,197
There was a postcard
in Thorwald's mailbox. It was...

773
00:57:32,367 --> 00:57:34,881
mailed 3:30 yesterday
afternoon from Merritsville.

774
00:57:35,047 --> 00:57:36,560
That's 80 miles north of here.

775
00:57:37,127 --> 00:57:39,038
Message went: 'Arrived OK.

776
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:43,325
Already feeling better. Love, Anna.'

777
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:47,879

778

Anna... Is that who I think it is?

779
00:57:51,807 --> 00:57:54,321

in the handbag.

849
01:04:05,207 --> 01:04:06,720
Someone not his wife.

850
01:04:06,887 --> 01:04:08,559
Well, I never saw him
ask her for advice.

851
01:04:08,727 --> 01:04:12,117
She volunteered plenty,
but I never saw him ask her for any.

852
01:04:22,207 --> 01:04:25,483
- I wonder where he's going.
- I don't know.

853
01:04:25,887 --> 01:04:31,041
- Suppose he doesn't come back?
- He'll be back. His things are there.

854
01:04:31,207 --> 01:04:34,165
- I guess it's safe to put on lights.
- No, not yet!

855
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:46,361
OK, you can turn it on now. He must
have gone someplace to the right.

856
01:04:46,527 --> 01:04:49,724
All day long, I've been trying
to keep my mind on my work.

857
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:53,960
- (Lisa) Thinking about Thorwald?
- And you, and your friend, Doyle.

858
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:57,119
- Did you hear from him since he left?
- (Jeff) Not a word.

859
01:04:57,287 --> 01:04:59,562
He said he was gonna check
the railroad station and the trunk.

860
01:04:59,727 --> 01:05:01,365
He must be still at it.

861
01:05:02,287 --> 01:05:04,482
Something on your mind?

862
01:05:04,647 --> 01:05:07,957
- It doesn't make sense to me.
- What doesn't?

863
01:05:08,127 --> 01:05:10,721
Women aren't that unpredictable.

864
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:14,800
Hmm. Well, I can't guess
what you're thinking.

865
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:17,356
A woman has a favourite handbag,

866
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:21,406
and it always hangs on her bedpost
where she can get at it easily.

867
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:25,162
Then, all of a sudden, she goes away
on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?

868
01:05:25,327 --> 01:05:26,965
Because she didn't know
she was going on a trip,

869
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:28,958
and where she's going,
she wouldn't need the handbag.

870
01:05:29,127 --> 01:05:32,881
Yes, but only her husband
would know that.

871
01:05:33,047 --> 01:05:35,880
And that jewellery - Women don't
keep their jewellery in a purse

872
01:05:36,047 --> 01:05:38,356
getting all twisted
and scratched and tangled up.

873
01:05:38,527 --> 01:05:40,040
Well, do they hide it
in their husband's clothes?

874
01:05:40,207 --> 01:05:44,041
They do not.
And they don't leave it behind either.

875
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:46,763
Why, a woman going anywhere
but the hospital

876
01:05:46,927 --> 01:05:51,000
would always take make-up,
perfume and jewellery.

877
01:05:51,167 --> 01:05:52,919
Put that over there.
That's inside stuff, huh?

878
01:05:53,087 --> 01:05:54,440
It's basic equipment.

879
01:05:54,607 --> 01:05:57,485
And you don't leave it behind in
your husband's drawer

880
01:05:57,647 --> 01:05:58,966
in your favourite handbag.

881
01:05:59,127 --> 01:06:01,277
Well, I'm with you, sweetie.
I'm with you.

882
01:06:01,447 --> 01:06:03,199
Tom Doyle has a pat answer
for that though.

883
01:06:03,367 --> 01:06:05,756
That Mrs Thorwald left at 6:00am
yesterday with her husband?

884
01:06:05,927 --> 01:06:06,916
According to those witnesses.

885
01:06:08,127 --> 01:06:10,197
Well, I have a pat rebuttal
for Mr Doyle.

886
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:13,564
Couldrt have been Mrs Thorwald,
or I don't know women.

887
01:06:13,927 --> 01:06:18,523
- What about the witnesses?
- We'll agree they saw a woman,

888
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:21,155
but she was not Mrs Thorwald.

889
01:06:21,327 --> 01:06:24,603
- That is, not yet.
- Is that so?

890
01:06:28,607 --> 01:06:30,279
Come here.

891
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:36,199
I'd like to see your friend's face
when we tell him.

892
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,437
He doesn't sound
like much of a detective.

893
01:06:38,607 --> 01:06:43,283
Oh, don't be too hard on him.
He's a steady worker.

894
01:06:43,447 --> 01:06:45,085
I sure wish he'd show up.

895
01:06:45,247 --> 01:06:48,125
Don't rush him. We have all night.

896
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:52,797
- We have all what?
- Night.

897
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:55,356
I'm going to stay with you.

898
01:06:56,727 --> 01:07:00,640
Well, you'll have to clear that
with my landlord.

899
01:07:00,807 --> 01:07:03,321
I have the whole weekend off.

900
01:07:03,927 --> 01:07:06,885
That's very nice,
but I just have one bed.

901
01:07:07,487 --> 01:07:11,605
If you say anything else, I'll...
stay tomorrow night too.

902
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:15,885
I won't be able
to give you any... pyjamas.

903
01:07:19,887 --> 01:07:23,880
You said I'll have
to live out of one suitcase.

904
01:07:25,047 --> 01:07:28,801
- I'll bet yours isn't this small.
- This is a suitcase?

905
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:31,720
Well, a Mark Cross overnight case.

906
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:35,038
- Ooh.
- Compact, but, uh... ample enough.

907
01:07:35,207 --> 01:07:37,277
Looks like you packed in a hurry.

908
01:07:37,447 --> 01:07:40,519
Look at this. Isn't that amazing?

909
01:07:40,687 --> 01:07:45,158
I'll trade you... my feminine intuition
for a bed for the night.

910
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,761
I'll go along with that.

# (Piano)

912
01:08:00,567 --> 01:08:02,000
There's that song again.

913
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:12,476
Where does a man get inspiration
to write a song like that?

914
01:08:12,647 --> 01:08:16,481
Well, he gets it from
the landlady once a month.

915
01:08:18,367 --> 01:08:21,040
It's utterly beautiful.

916
01:08:21,207 --> 01:08:24,722
- I wish I could be creative.
- Oh, sweetie, you are.

917
01:08:24,887 --> 01:08:28,562
Y-Y-You have a great talent for
creating difficult situations.

918
01:08:28,727 --> 01:08:30,319
- I do?
- Sure.

919
01:08:30,487 --> 01:08:32,284
Like staying here all night uninvited.

920
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:35,564
Well, surprise is the most
important element of attack.

921
01:08:35,727 --> 01:08:38,764
Besides, you're not up on
your private eye literature.

922
01:08:38,927 --> 01:08:40,804
When they're in trouble,
it's always their Girl Friday

923
01:08:40,967 --> 01:08:42,195
that gets them out of it.

924
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,358
Is she the girl that
saves them from the clutches

925
01:08:44,527 --> 01:08:48,076
of the over-passionate
daughters of the rich?

926
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:51,000
- The same.
- That's the one, huh?

927
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,965
It's funny. He never ends
up marrying her, does he?

928
01:08:54,127 --> 01:08:56,687
- That's strange.
- Weird.

929
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:00,844
Why don't I slip into something
more comfortable?

930
01:09:01,007 --> 01:09:02,440
By all means.

931
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:05,720
I mean, like the kitchen
and make us some coffee.

932
01:09:05,887 --> 01:09:08,355
Oh, and some brandy too, huh?

What else have you got
on this man Thorwald?

942

Enough to scare me you wouldn't
show up in time and we'd lose him.

943
01:10:24,647 --> 01:10:26,717
- Think he's getting out of here?
- He's got everything he owns

944
01:10:26,887 --> 01:10:31,005
laid out over there in the bedroom,
waiting to be packed.

945
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:35,643
I'm just warming some brandy.
Mr Doyle, I presume?

946
01:10:38,287 --> 01:10:40,482
(Jeff) Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.

947
01:10:40,647 --> 01:10:43,878
- How do you do?
- We think Thorwald's guilty.

948
01:10:50,967 --> 01:10:52,764
Careful, Tom.

949
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:55,395
(Telephone Ringing)

950
01:10:57,527 --> 01:10:58,721
- Hello.
- (Man) Lieutenant Doyle.

951
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:00,320
Yeah, he's right here. For you.

952
01:11:02,047 --> 01:11:03,958
- Hello.
- Lieutenant Doyle, sir?

953
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:07,119
Speaking. Yeah.

954
01:11:09,487 --> 01:11:10,806
Alright.

955
01:11:11,207 --> 01:11:13,721
I see. Thank you... Goodbye.

956
01:11:13,887 --> 01:11:15,878
Coffee will be ready soon.

957
01:11:16,047 --> 01:11:18,277
Jeff, aren't you going to tell him
about the jewellery?

958
01:11:18,447 --> 01:11:19,436
Jewellery?

959
01:11:19,607 --> 01:11:22,838
He's got his wife's jewellery hidden
in his clothes in the bedroom there.

960
01:11:23,007 --> 01:11:25,999
- You sure it belonged to his wife?
- It was in her favourite handbag.

961
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,727
Mr Doyle, that can only lead
to one conclusion.

962
01:11:28,887 --> 01:11:29,876
Namely?

963
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:33,437
That it was not Mrs Thorwald that
left with him yesterday morning.

964
01:11:33,647 --> 01:11:35,046
You figured that out, eh?

965
01:11:35,247 --> 01:11:37,556
It's simply that women
don't leave their jewellery behind

966
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,922
when they go on a trip.

967
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:44,956
Come on, Tom. You don't really need
any of this information, do you?

968
01:11:50,127 --> 01:11:52,687
As a matter of fact, I don't.

969
01:11:57,887 --> 01:12:01,846
Lars Thorwald is no more
a murderer than I am.

970
01:12:04,807 --> 01:12:08,516
You can explain everything
that's going on over there?

971
01:12:08,727 --> 01:12:10,558
- # (Piano)
- No, and neither can you.

972
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:13,446
That's a secret, private world
you're looking into out there.

973
01:12:13,607 --> 01:12:15,916
People do a lot of things in private
they couldn't do in public.

974
01:12:16,447 --> 01:12:18,119
Like disposing of their wives?

975
01:12:18,447 --> 01:12:21,086
Get that idea out of your mind.
It'll only lead in the wrong direction.

976
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,919
What about the knife and the saw?

977
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:27,646
- Did you ever own a saw?
- Well, at home in the garage I had -

978
01:12:27,807 --> 01:12:29,763
(Doyle) How many people
did you cut up with it?

979
01:12:30,047 --> 01:12:34,882
Or with the couple hundred knives
you've owned in your lifetime?

980
01:12:35,047 --> 01:12:36,480
Your logic is backward.

981
01:12:36,647 --> 01:12:40,162
You can't ignore the disappearance
and the trunk and the jewellery.

982
01:12:40,327 --> 01:12:43,046
I checked the railroad station.
He bought a ticket.

983
01:12:43,207 --> 01:12:44,959
Ten minutes later,
he put his wife on the train.

984
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:48,204
Destination: Merritsville.
The witnesses are that deep.

985
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:51,200
That might have been a woman, but
it couldn't have been Mrs Thorwald.

986
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,686
- That jewellery -
- Look, Miss Fremont.

987
01:12:52,847 --> 01:12:55,486
That feminine intuition stuff
sells magazines

988
01:12:55,647 --> 01:12:58,366
but in real life, it's still a fairy tale.

989
01:12:58,527 --> 01:12:59,801
I don't know how many
wasted years I've spent,

990
01:12:59,967 --> 01:13:02,720
tracking down leads
based on female intuition.

991
01:13:02,887 --> 01:13:05,276
(Jeff) Alright!
I take it you didn't find the trunk.

992
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:08,484
All this is from an old speech
you made at the policemers ball.

993
01:13:08,647 --> 01:13:11,081
I found the trunk
a half-hour after I left here.

994
01:13:11,247 --> 01:13:15,081
I suppose it's normal for a man
to tie up a trunk with heavy rope?

995
01:13:15,247 --> 01:13:16,680
If the lock is broken, yes.

996
01:13:16,847 --> 01:13:19,964
What did you find inside the trunk,
a surly note to me?

997
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,038
Mrs Thorwald's clothes;

998
01:13:22,207 --> 01:13:25,279
clean, well-packed,
not stylish, but presentable.

999
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:27,119
Didrt you take them off
to the crime lab?

1000
01:13:27,287 --> 01:13:30,006
I sent them on their merry
and legal way.

1001
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:32,727
Why, when a woman is taking
a simple, short trip,

1002
01:13:32,887 --> 01:13:34,718
does she take everything she owns?

1003
01:13:34,887 --> 01:13:39,005
Let's let the female psychology
department handle that one.

1004
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:41,476
I would say it looked as if
she wasrt coming back.

1005
01:13:41,647 --> 01:13:43,365
That's what's
known as a family problem.

1006
01:13:43,527 --> 01:13:45,961
If she wasrt coming back,
why didn't he tell his landlord?

1007
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:47,879
I'll tell you why
he didn't tell his landlord,

1008
01:13:48,047 --> 01:13:49,196
because he was hiding something.

1009
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:54,444
Do you tell your landlord everything?

1010
01:13:54,647 --> 01:13:56,797
Ah, I told you to be careful, Tom.

1011
01:13:56,967 --> 01:14:00,004
If I'd have been careful
piloting that reconnaissance plane

1012
01:14:00,167 --> 01:14:01,395

you're through with the case?

consult the Yellow Pages

Oh, I love funny exiting lines.

- Who was that trunk addressed to?
- Mrs Anna Thorwald.

1031
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:09,323
Then let's wait and find out
who picks it up.

1032

Oh, that phone call,
I gave them your number.

- Depends on who they were.

the trunk was just picked up...

You know, much as I hate to give
Thomas J Doyle too much credit,

1048
01:17:22,447 --> 01:17:24,517
he might have gotten ahold
of something when he said

1049
01:17:24,687 --> 01:17:28,646
that was pretty private
stuff going on out there.

1050
01:17:29,447 --> 01:17:31,756
I wonder if it's ethical to watch a man

1051

with binoculars and a long-focus lens.

1052
01:17:36,207 --> 01:17:37,435
Do you...

1053
01:17:37,607 --> 01:17:41,441
Do you suppose it's ethical, even if you
prove that he didn't commit a crime?

1054
01:17:43,647 --> 01:17:45,603
I'm not much on rear window ethics.

1055
01:17:46,207 --> 01:17:47,560
Of course,
they can do the same thing to me,

1056
01:17:47,727 --> 01:17:50,195

if they want to.

Which one of you killed my dog?

You don't know the meaning
of the word 'neighbours'.

1087
01:20:03,367 --> 01:20:04,720
Neighbours like each other,

1088
01:20:05,207 --> 01:20:09,041
speak to each other,
care if anybody lives or dies!

But none of you do!

01:20:15,567 --> 01:20:17,922
But I couldn't imagine
any of you being so low

1091
01:20:18,087 --> 01:20:20,965
that you'd kill a helpless, friendly dog.

1092
01:20:23,247 --> 01:20:27,798
The only thing in this whole
neighbourhood who liked anybody!

Did you kill him because he liked you?
Just because he liked you?

Let's go inside.

convinced I was wrong.

01:21:06,447 --> 01:21:08,119
- But you're not?
- Look.

01:21:08,287 --> 01:21:13,042
In the courtyard, only one person
didn't come to the window. Look.

1102
01:21:18,887 --> 01:21:22,641
Why would Thorwald
want to kill a little dog?

1103
01:21:23,927 --> 01:21:26,043
Because it knew too much?

1104
01:21:33,607 --> 01:21:35,438
You think this is won'th
waiting all day to see?

1105
01:21:36,967 --> 01:21:38,161
(Lisa) Is he cleaning house?

1106
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:40,602
He's washing down the bathroom walls.

1107
01:21:41,247 --> 01:21:43,966
Hm, must have splattered a lot.

1108
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:47,956
Well, why not?
That's what we're all thinking.

1109
01:21:48,127 --> 01:21:51,085
He killed her in there,
he has to clean up those stains.

1110
01:21:51,247 --> 01:21:53,397
Oh, Stella, your choice of words.

1111
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:58,038
(Stella) Nobody ever invented
a polite word for a killing yet.

1112
01:21:59,847 --> 01:22:04,557
Lisa, back there on that shelf,
there's a little yellow box, you see it?

1113
01:22:04,727 --> 01:22:06,558
- Top one?
- Right on top, yeah.

1114
01:22:06,727 --> 01:22:08,877
And bring me the viewer there.

1115
01:22:10,847 --> 01:22:14,635
I just got a...
These are about two weeks old.

1116
01:22:15,887 --> 01:22:19,197
I hope I took something else
besides leg art. Now which one...

1117
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,562
What are you looking for?

1118
01:22:22,127 --> 01:22:25,039
There's something, and if I'm right,
I think I've solved a murder.

1119
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:27,198
- Mrs Thorwald?
- No.

1120
01:22:28,127 --> 01:22:29,924
No, the dog.

1121
01:22:31,367 --> 01:22:35,565
Uh-huh. I think I know
why Thorwald killed that dog.

1122
01:22:35,727 --> 01:22:38,446
Here, now you take a look.
Tell me what you see.

1123
01:22:39,047 --> 01:22:40,799
Now take it down.

1124
01:22:40,967 --> 01:22:42,685
Now look again.

1125
01:22:42,847 --> 01:22:44,644
Now take it down. You see?

1126
01:22:46,927 --> 01:22:48,076
It's just a picture of the backyard -

1127
01:22:48,247 --> 01:22:52,559
But with one important change.
One important change.

1128
01:22:52,727 --> 01:22:56,561
Those flowers
in Thorwald's pet flower bed.

1129
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:58,797
You mean where the dog
was sniffing around?

1130
01:22:58,967 --> 01:23:02,277
Where the dog was digging.
Now look at those flowers.

1131
01:23:02,447 --> 01:23:06,326
Look, those two yellow zinnias
on this end

1132
01:23:06,487 --> 01:23:07,966
aren't as tall as they were.

1133
01:23:08,127 --> 01:23:10,880
Since when do flowers
grow shorter in two weeks?

1134
01:23:11,367 --> 01:23:14,837
- There's something buried there.
- Mrs Thorwald.

1135
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:18,079
You haven't spent much time
around cemeteries, have you?

1136
01:23:18,247 --> 01:23:20,966
Mr Thorwald could scarcely
put his wife's body

1137
01:23:21,127 --> 01:23:24,119
in a plot of ground
about one foot square.

1138
01:23:24,287 --> 01:23:26,801
Unless, of course,
he put her in standing on end,

1139
01:23:26,967 --> 01:23:29,481
and then he wouldn't need
a knife and saw.

1140
01:23:29,647 --> 01:23:33,083
No, my idea is she's
scattered all over town.

1141
01:23:33,247 --> 01:23:35,556
- Leg in the East River -
- Oh, Stella, please!

1142
01:23:35,727 --> 01:23:37,206
No, no, no. There's something in there.

1143
01:23:37,367 --> 01:23:39,403
Those flowers have been
taken out and put back in.

1144
01:23:39,567 --> 01:23:41,239
- Maybe it's the knife and saw.
- Yeah -

1145
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:43,557
- Call Lieutenant Doyle.
- No, let's wait.

1146
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:47,117
Let's wait till it gets a little darker,
and I'll go over there and dig them up.

1147
01:23:47,287 --> 01:23:51,758
You'll go? You won't dig anything up
and get your neck broken.

1148
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:53,804
No, no, we've...

1149
01:23:53,967 --> 01:23:57,004
We're not gonna call Doyle until
I can produce Mrs Thorwald's body.

1150
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:59,806
What we've got to do is find a way
to get into that apartment.

1151
01:23:59,967 --> 01:24:01,286
(Softly) He's packing.

1152
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:03,322
(Jeff) Uh-oh.

1153
01:24:03,727 --> 01:24:06,082
Here, get me a pencil.

1154
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:09,924
Stella, get me some note paper.
It's up here someplace.

1155
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,406
There it is.

1156
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:27,642
(Jeff) You did it, Thorwald. You did it.

1157
01:25:31,487 --> 01:25:33,125
- Look out, Lisa. He's coming.
- You never should have let her do it.

1158
01:25:33,287 --> 01:25:34,879
- If he ever -
- Look. Look. Look.

1159
01:25:53,447 --> 01:25:56,280
(Sighs) Thank heaven that's over.

1160
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:02,717
- Alright if I have a drink?
- Sure, go ahead.

1161
01:26:11,447 --> 01:26:14,962
There's no doubt about it. He's leaving.
It's just a question of when.

1162
01:26:15,127 --> 01:26:18,642
Mind if I use that portable keyhole?

1163
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:22,163
Go ahead, just as long as you tell me
what you're looking at.

1164
01:26:28,447 --> 01:26:30,563
- (Stella) I wonder...
- (Jeff) Wonder what?

1165
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,922
Miss Lonelyhearts just laid out
something that looks like

1166
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:34,964
rhodium tri-eckonal capsules.

1167
01:26:35,127 --> 01:26:37,880
- (Jeff) You can tell from here?
- (Stella) I've handled enough of those

1168
01:26:38,047 --> 01:26:40,277
to put everybody in Hackensack
to sleep for the winter.

1169
01:26:40,727 --> 01:26:44,117
- Does she have enough of them to -
- To make her rest easier -

1170
01:26:44,287 --> 01:26:46,198
- (Door opens)
- Wasrt that close?

1171
01:26:47,007 --> 01:26:49,601
What was his reaction
when he looked at the note?

1172
01:26:50,207 --> 01:26:52,163
(Stella) It wasrt the kind
of expression that would get him

1173
01:26:52,327 --> 01:26:53,806
a quick loan at the bank.

1174
01:26:53,967 --> 01:26:56,686
(Softly) Jeff, the handbag!

1175
01:27:20,247 --> 01:27:22,363
Suppose Mrs Thorwald's wedding ring

1176
01:27:22,527 --> 01:27:25,121
is among the jewellery
he has in that handbag?

1177
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:27,881
Now, during the phone conversation
he held up three rings:

1178
01:27:28,047 --> 01:27:31,039
one with a diamond,
one with a big stone of some sort,

1179
01:27:31,207 --> 01:27:33,198
and then just a plain gold band.

1180
01:27:33,367 --> 01:27:37,042
The last thing she would leave behind
would be her wedding ring.

1181
01:27:37,207 --> 01:27:39,277
Stella,
do you ever leave yours at home?

1182
01:27:39,447 --> 01:27:44,441
The only way anybody could get that
ring would be to chop off my finger.

1183
01:27:46,407 --> 01:27:49,365
Let's go down and find out
what's buried in the garden.

1184
01:27:49,527 --> 01:27:53,884
Why not? I've always wanted
to meet Mrs Thorwald.

1185
01:27:54,047 --> 01:27:55,560
- What are you two talking about -
- You got a shovel?

1186
01:27:55,727 --> 01:27:56,876
Of course I don't have a shovel.

1187
01:27:57,047 --> 01:28:00,562
- There's probably one in the basement.
- If you're squeamish, just don't look.

1188
01:28:00,727 --> 01:28:01,716
Squeamish? I'm not squeamish.

1189
01:28:01,887 --> 01:28:05,323
I just don't want you two
to end up like that dog.

1190
01:28:05,487 --> 01:28:08,638
Oh, you know, Miss Fremont,
he might just have something there.

1191
01:28:08,807 --> 01:28:10,479
Just hold on. Here, take this.

1192
01:28:10,647 --> 01:28:12,922
No sense taking any chances
in this thing.

1193
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:15,521
Here, give me the phone book.

1194
01:28:16,287 --> 01:28:18,039
What for?

1195
01:28:18,207 --> 01:28:20,038
Maybe I can
get him out of that apartment.

1196
01:28:20,207 --> 01:28:21,560
We only need a few minutes.

1197
01:28:21,727 --> 01:28:23,479
I'll see if I can get about 15 minutes.

1198
01:28:23,647 --> 01:28:25,922
- How?
- (Softly) Thorwald.

1199
01:28:27,047 --> 01:28:29,163
Thorwald... Thorwald.

1200
01:28:31,247 --> 01:28:34,398
Chelsea 2-7099.

1201
01:28:35,487 --> 01:28:36,522
2-7099.

1202
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:40,282
We scared him once,
maybe we can scare him again.

1203
01:28:40,447 --> 01:28:43,200
I guess I'm using that word
'we' a little freely.

1204
01:28:43,367 --> 01:28:44,800
You're taking all the chances.

1205
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:48,485
- (Lisa) Shall we vote him in, Stella?
- (Stella) Unanimously.

1206
01:28:48,647 --> 01:28:51,480
(Softly) 2-7099. Look out.

1207
01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:55,798
(Softly) Chelsea.

1208
01:28:57,047 --> 01:28:58,799
Chelsea.

1209
01:28:59,647 --> 01:29:02,400
(Repeating Number)

1210
01:29:03,207 --> 01:29:05,880
(Telephone Ringing)

1211
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:17,126
Go on, pick it up, Thorwald.

1212
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,155
Go on, you're curious.

1213
01:29:21,327 --> 01:29:24,000
You wonder if it's your girlfriend
calling, the one you killed for.

1214
01:29:24,487 --> 01:29:26,796
Go on, pick it up.

1215
01:29:30,007 --> 01:29:33,761
- (Thorwald) "Hello?"
- Did you get my note?

1216
01:29:35,887 --> 01:29:37,718
Well, did you get it, Thorwald?

1217
01:29:37,887 --> 01:29:39,206
(Thorwald) "Who are you?"

1218
01:29:39,367 --> 01:29:41,198
(Jeff) I'll give you a chance to find out.

1219
01:29:41,367 --> 01:29:43,756
(Jeff) Meet me
in the bar at the Albert Hotel.

1220
01:29:43,927 --> 01:29:45,883
Do it right away.

1221
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:49,084
- (Thorwald) "Why should I?"
- A little business meeting...

1222
01:29:49,247 --> 01:29:52,159
to settle the estate of your late wife.

1223
01:29:52,927 --> 01:29:55,964
(Thorwald)
"I... don't know what you mean."

1224
01:29:56,127 --> 01:29:57,958
Come on. Quit stalling, Thorwald,

1225
01:29:58,127 --> 01:30:00,243
or I'll hang up and call the police.

1226
01:30:00,407 --> 01:30:04,082
- (Thorwald) "I only have $100."
- That's a start.

1227
01:30:04,647 --> 01:30:08,356
I'm at the Albert now.
I'll be looking for you.

1228
01:30:22,367 --> 01:30:23,766
(Closes Door)

1229
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,166
Come on, Stella, let's go.

1230
01:30:28,327 --> 01:30:29,806
(Softly) One of you
keep an eye on this window.

1231
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:33,482
If I see him coming back,
I'll signal with a flashbulb.

1232
01:31:41,127 --> 01:31:43,595
(Traffic Noises)

1233
01:32:04,007 --> 01:32:05,486
(Woman) "This is the Doyle residence."

1234
01:32:05,647 --> 01:32:09,799
Hello, this is L B Jefferies.
I'm a friend of Mr Doyle.

1235
01:32:09,967 --> 01:32:12,117
- Who's this?
- "This is a baby-sitter."

1236
01:32:12,287 --> 01:32:14,960
Oh, uh... when do you expect them in?

1237
01:32:15,127 --> 01:32:19,359
"They went to dinner and
maybe a nightclub."

1238
01:32:19,527 --> 01:32:21,199
I see, hm.

1239
01:32:21,367 --> 01:32:24,279
If he calls in, have him get
in touch with L B Jefferies?

1240
01:32:24,967 --> 01:32:26,798
I might have quite a surprise for him.

1241
01:32:26,967 --> 01:32:29,765
"Well, do we have
your number, Mr Jefferies?"

1242
01:32:29,927 --> 01:32:33,761
- He has it. Good night.
- "Good night."

1243
01:32:37,447 --> 01:32:39,915
# (Band Practising)

1244
01:32:49,247 --> 01:32:53,206
(Jeff) Ah, Stella was wrong
about Miss Lonelyhearts.

1245
01:33:23,727 --> 01:33:26,560
(Softly) Lisa, what are you... Don't...

1246
01:33:31,287 --> 01:33:32,766
Don't...

1247
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:42,920
(Softly)
Lisa, what are you doing? Don't go...

1248
01:33:59,047 --> 01:34:00,275
Li...

1249
01:34:16,607 --> 01:34:19,963
(Softly) Come on, come on!
Get out of there!

1250
01:34:25,207 --> 01:34:28,916
She said ring Thorwald's phone
the second you see him come back.

1251
01:34:29,087 --> 01:34:31,123
(Jeff) We'll ring right now!
(Stella) Give her another minute.

1252
01:34:35,607 --> 01:34:38,121
(Composer) Alright, fellows,
let's try it once from the beginning.

1253
01:34:38,287 --> 01:34:39,720
(Stella) Miss Lonelyhearts.

1254
01:34:39,887 --> 01:34:41,400
Oh, call the police!

1255
01:34:41,567 --> 01:34:44,035
(Jeff Dialling)

1256
01:34:44,767 --> 01:34:47,122
- "Operator."
- Get me the police, sixth precinct.

1257
01:34:47,287 --> 01:34:48,766
(Operator) "Yes, sir."

1258
01:35:00,247 --> 01:35:03,239
(Stella)
Mr Jefferies, the music stopped her.

1259
01:35:09,687 --> 01:35:11,803
What... Lisa!

1260
01:35:13,487 --> 01:35:14,602
Lisa!

1261
01:35:25,807 --> 01:35:27,479
"Precinct Six, Sergeant Allgood."

1262
01:35:27,647 --> 01:35:32,277
Hello. Look, a man is assaulting
a woman at 125 West Ninth Street,

1263
01:35:32,447 --> 01:35:34,517
second floor, at the rear.

1264
01:35:35,047 --> 01:35:36,366
Make it fast!

1265
01:35:36,527 --> 01:35:38,563
- (Allgood) "Your name?"
- (Stammering) L B Jefferies.

1266
01:35:38,727 --> 01:35:41,560
- (Allgood) "Phone number?"
- (Jeff) Chelsea 2-5598

1267
01:35:41,727 --> 01:35:42,716
(Allgood) "Two minutes."

1268
01:36:01,807 --> 01:36:03,126
(Lisa) The door was open.

1269
01:36:03,287 --> 01:36:05,164
(Lisa Continues, Indistinct)

1270
01:36:17,527 --> 01:36:18,846
Oh...

1271
01:36:24,447 --> 01:36:27,439
- (Lisa) I told you...
- (Softly) Oh, no!

1272
01:36:28,207 --> 01:36:30,084
Let go of me! Jeff!

1273
01:36:30,247 --> 01:36:33,159
- Oh, no! (Gasps)
- (Lisa) Jeff! Jeff!

1274
01:36:33,327 --> 01:36:34,840
Jeff!

1275
01:36:35,887 --> 01:36:37,957
Lisa!

1276
01:36:38,127 --> 01:36:39,355
Stella, what do we do?

1277
01:36:40,567 --> 01:36:44,116
- (Lisa) Jeff! Jeff!
- Here they come.

1278
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:50,758
(Ringing Doorbell)

1279
01:37:21,527 --> 01:37:23,358
(Talking, Indistinct)

1280
01:37:32,647 --> 01:37:34,558
(Stella) What's she trying to do?
Why doesn't she turn him in?

1281
01:37:34,727 --> 01:37:37,878
- She's a smart girl.
- "Smart girl?" She'll be arrested.

1282
01:37:38,047 --> 01:37:40,925
(Jeff)
lt'll get her out of there, won't it?

1283
01:37:42,807 --> 01:37:45,241
(Jeff) Look, the wedding ring!

1284
01:37:50,247 --> 01:37:53,125
(Softly) Turn off the light! He's seen us!

1285
01:38:02,367 --> 01:38:03,641
How long do you think he'll stay there?

1286
01:38:03,807 --> 01:38:07,720
Unless he's dumber than I think,
he won't wait until his lease is up.

1287
01:38:07,887 --> 01:38:09,878
Get my billfold out of the drawer
in the table there.

1288
01:38:10,047 --> 01:38:12,641
- What do you need money for?
- I'm gonna bail Lisa out of jail.

1289
01:38:12,807 --> 01:38:14,877
You could leave her there
till next Tuesday.

1290
01:38:15,047 --> 01:38:17,356
Then you could sneak
safely away as planned.

1291
01:38:17,527 --> 01:38:22,237
- Yeah, let's see, $127.
- How much do you need?

1292
01:38:22,407 --> 01:38:25,797
Well, this is first offence burglary,
that's about $250.

1293
01:38:25,967 --> 01:38:28,800
- Lisa's handbag.
- Yeah.

1294
01:38:28,967 --> 01:38:31,083
- How much does she have?
- Fifty cents.

1295
01:38:31,247 --> 01:38:34,762
- Here, take this.
- (Stella) I got $20 or so in my purse.

1296
01:38:34,927 --> 01:38:35,916
(Jeff) What about the rest?

1297
01:38:36,087 --> 01:38:38,442
When those cops see Lisa,
they'll even contribute.

1298
01:38:38,967 --> 01:38:41,162
(Telephone Ringing)

1299
01:38:43,847 --> 01:38:46,520
(Softly) Just a minute. Hurry up!

1300
01:38:46,687 --> 01:38:49,406
- Jefferies.
- (Doyle) "What is it now?"

1301
01:38:49,567 --> 01:38:52,365
Doyle, I've got something
really big for you.

1302
01:38:52,527 --> 01:38:54,358
"Why did I have to return your call?"

1303
01:38:54,527 --> 01:38:57,439
"Look! Don't louse up my night
with another mad killer -"

1304
01:38:57,607 --> 01:39:02,158
Listen to me! Listen to me!
Lisa's in jail. She got arrested.

1305
01:39:02,327 --> 01:39:04,045
- "Your Lisa?"
- My Lisa.

1306
01:39:04,207 --> 01:39:07,722
Boy, you should have seen her.
She got into Thorwald's apartment,

1307
01:39:07,887 --> 01:39:09,798
but then he came back
and the only way I could get her out,

1308
01:39:09,967 --> 01:39:10,956
was call the police.

1309
01:39:11,127 --> 01:39:12,196
- "I told you -"
- I know you told me.

1310
01:39:12,367 --> 01:39:15,359
She went in to get evidence,
and she came out with evidence.

1311
01:39:15,527 --> 01:39:19,964
- "Like what?"
- Like Mrs Thorwald's wedding ring.

1312
01:39:20,127 --> 01:39:24,120
If that woman was alive,
she'd be wearing that ring, right?

1313
01:39:24,287 --> 01:39:26,801
- "Hm. It's a possibility."
- A 'possibility'? It's a fact.

1314
01:39:26,967 --> 01:39:28,559
He killed a dog last night

1315
01:39:28,727 --> 01:39:31,480
because the dog was scratching around
in the garden. You know why?

1316
01:39:31,647 --> 01:39:34,878
Because he had something buried
in that garden that the dog scented.

1317
01:39:35,047 --> 01:39:36,036
"Like an old ham bone?"

1318
01:39:36,207 --> 01:39:39,040
I don't know what pet names
Thorwald had for his wife,

1319
01:39:39,207 --> 01:39:40,322
but I'll tell you this:

1320
01:39:40,487 --> 01:39:43,718
All those trips at night
with that metal suitcase,

1321
01:39:43,887 --> 01:39:45,115
he wasrt taking out his possessions,

1322
01:39:45,287 --> 01:39:48,199
because his possessions
are still up in the apartment.

1323
01:39:48,367 --> 01:39:50,437
"Do you think perhaps
it was old 'ham bone? '"

1324
01:39:50,607 --> 01:39:53,405
And I'll tell you something else.

1325
01:39:53,567 --> 01:39:56,400
All the telephone calls
he made were long distance, alright?

1326
01:39:56,567 --> 01:39:59,877
Now, if he called his wife long
distance on the day she left,

1327
01:40:00,047 --> 01:40:02,163
after she arrived in Merritsville,

1328
01:40:02,327 --> 01:40:05,399
why did she write a card to him
saying she arrived in Merritsville?

1329
01:40:05,567 --> 01:40:07,285
Why did she do that?

1330
01:40:08,047 --> 01:40:10,277
- "Where'd they take Lisa?"
- Precinct six.

1331
01:40:10,447 --> 01:40:11,846
I sent somebody over
with the bail money.

1332
01:40:12,007 --> 01:40:13,918
"Maybe you won't need it.
I'll run it down, Jeff."

1333
01:40:14,087 --> 01:40:17,716
Alright. Hurry up, will you?
This fellow knows he's being watched.

1334
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,718
He's not gonna wait around forever.
Hurry up.

1335
01:40:19,887 --> 01:40:22,560
"If that ring checks out,
we'll give him an escort. So long, Jeff."

1336

1337
01:40:31,967 --> 01:40:32,843
Hello, Tom.

1338
01:40:33,007 --> 01:40:35,726
I think Thorwald's left. I don't see...

1339
01:40:37,967 --> 01:40:39,366
Hello?

What do you want from me?

1350
01:43:10,007 --> 01:43:12,840
Your friend, the girl, could have
turned me in. Why didn't she?

1351
01:43:15,407 --> 01:43:18,956
What is it you want, a lot of money?
I don't have any money.

1352
01:43:22,807 --> 01:43:23,876
Say something.

1353

Say something! Tell me what you want!

- No.
- (Thorwald) Tell her to bring it back.

1356
01:43:38,047 --> 01:43:40,561
I can't. The police have it by now.

1370
01:45:10,287 --> 01:45:12,039
I'm sorry, Jeff.
I got here as fast as I could.

1371
01:45:12,207 --> 01:45:14,960
Don't let anybody touch him.
Get me a medical bag from upstairs.

1372
01:45:15,127 --> 01:45:17,641
Lisa, sweetie, if anything
had happened to you -

1373
01:45:17,807 --> 01:45:21,163
- I'm alright.
- Gee, I'm proud of you.

for a search warrant now?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Thorwald's ready to take us
on a tour of the East River.

1379
01:45:38,247 --> 01:45:39,839
Did he say what was buried
in the flower bed?

1380
01:45:40,447 --> 01:45:44,963
Yeah. He said the dog got
too inquisitive, so he dug it up.

1381
01:45:45,127 --> 01:45:47,641
It's in a hat box over in his apartment.

1382
01:45:47,807 --> 01:45:48,956
- Want to look?
- (Stella) No, thanks.

1383
01:45:49,127 --> 01:45:51,402
I don't want any part of her.

1384

I hope it's gonna be a hit.
This is the first release.

1385
01:46:00,207 --> 01:46:02,118

Don't jump. Let's try it again, puppy.

1390
01:46:22,247 --> 01:46:24,920
Stay still. Stay.

1391
01:46:31,647 --> 01:46:33,717
- Stanley!
- Hello, baby.

1392
01:46:36,247 --> 01:46:39,045
My, look what
the army's done for you!

1393
01:46:40,887 --> 01:46:42,605

in the icebox to eat?

1398

If you had told me you'd quit your job,

1399
01:46:53,367 --> 01:46:54,766
we wouldn't have gotten married.

1400
01:46:54,927 --> 01:46:56,485
