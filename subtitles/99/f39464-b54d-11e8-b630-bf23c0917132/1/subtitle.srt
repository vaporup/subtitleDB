1
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,776
<i>This is a story about a man
named Eddie...</i>

2
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:50,407
<i>and it begins at the end,
with Eddie dying in the sun.</i>

3
00:01:13,905 --> 00:01:15,638
<i>You might think it strange...</i>

4
00:01:15,673 --> 00:01:17,766
<i>to start a story
with an ending.</i>

5
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:24,381
<i>But all endings
are also beginnings...</i>

6
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:28,777
<i>We just don't know it
at the time.</i>

7
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,697
You lose this?

8
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:52,744
I suppose I should
come down there...

9
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,234
and give it back to you, huh?

10
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,779
That's what I thought.

11
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,559
You love this balloon?

12
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,535
Then hold tight to it.

13
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,006
- Thanks, Eddie Maintenance.
- Just Eddie.

14
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,443
But your shirt says,
'Eddie Main-te-nance.'

15
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,911
Well, Eddie is my name.

16
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:29,816
Maintenance is my job.
And this is just a shirt.

17
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,152
Well...

18
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,814
go catch up with your father.

19
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:03,234
<i>Years ago, people
thought of Ruby Pier...</i>

20
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,651
<i>as a magical
and mysterious place.</i>

21
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:17,805
<i>Once, even Eddie
felt that way.</i>

22
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:26,920
What are we gonna
fix today, pop?

23
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:28,616
I don't know, Eddie.
Whatever's broke.

24
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:32,760
Where ya been?

25
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,764
Hey, Gracie. How's tricks?

26
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,364
Okay.

27
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,498
Hiya, Eddie.

28
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:39,817
Watch the kid for me,
will ya?

29
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,102
Sure... How long
you gonna be?

30
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:41,469
Not long.

31
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:45,064
C'mon, Eddie. You want
to fix something for me?

32
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:15,471
Is it fixed yet?

33
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,101
It's good, Pop.

34
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:21,950
Where's your brother?

35
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:24,217
I don't know.

36
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:25,617
Well, find him.

37
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:28,555
What is it with you two?

38
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,285
He was supposed
to be here by now.

39
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,264
What the hell
happened to you?

40
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:38,631
These guys...
they took my jacket...

41
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,613
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waiting for?

42
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:47,205
Take care of it!

43
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,593
Hey, pretty sharp!

44
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,155
Not again!

45
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,956
Look at you!

46
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:19,891
Look at ya... you're bleeding.

47
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,628
You get 'em, then?

48
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:25,765
What are you talking about?

49
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,449
Did you put him up to this?

50
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:31,098
I asked you... did you get 'em?

51
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:37,709
Good boy.

52
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:39,979
Honestly.
This fighting has to stop!

53
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:42,082
You wanna grow up
to be an engineer?

54
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:44,968
Do you? How you
gonna be an engineer...

55
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:46,028
if your hands are
all busted up, huh?

56
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:49,054
Eddie's too dumb
to be an engineer.

57
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,490
- Hey, careful!
- Knock it off!

58
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:51,718
You, too.

59
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:54,459
This war in Europe keeps up...

60
00:05:54,494 --> 00:05:57,962
you'll be lucky to get
a crappy job like mine...

61
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:07,874
<i>Eddie...
Eddie, are you there?</i>

62
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:12,000
So...

63
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,250
Yeah, Dom.

64
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:17,289
<i>Hey, Eddie, we need
the keys to gate 16...</i>

65
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:18,779
I'm on my way.

66
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:25,594
<i>The last hour of Eddie's life
was spent like all the others.</i>

67
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:44,551
Had Eddie known he was gonna die,
he might have done something different.

68
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:49,422
But how many of us ever know?

69
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:53,110
Eddie Maintenance?

70
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:55,984
Just Eddie.

71
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:01,755
Eddie... can you...

72
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:05,621
Come on, kiddo.
I ain't got all day.

73
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:09,166
Can you make me an animal?

74
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:27,810
- Where's your mother?
- She's over there eating.

75
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:34,791
- Without you?
- With her boyfriend.

76
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:38,763
That's the piece that makes
it work... watch... here...

77
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:40,931
there, like that...

78
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:44,336
- and then...
- It's a rabbit!

79
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,055
Yeah, rabbit.

80
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,704
Thank you!

81
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:49,604
Go show your mother
what you got.

82
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:06,823
<i>Eddie rode every ride
at Ruby Pier...</i>

83
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:10,089
<i>once a week to be certain
they were safe.</i>

84
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:13,430
<i>He'd done it for so long...</i>

85
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:15,665
<i>he could almost 'hear'
trouble coming...</i>

86
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,466
<i>in the spits and sputters of
the engines and the brakes.</i>

87
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:23,551
<i>Children liked Eddie.</i>

88
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,422
<i>Teenagers gave him headaches.</i>

89
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:33,904
<i>Often he thought this was no way
for a man to grow old.</i>

90
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:39,053
<i>But this was his life, 'Eddie
Maintenance' they called him...</i>

91
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:41,681
<i>and a maintenance man he was.</i>

92
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:47,962
Can I go now, Pop?

93
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:54,400
- Is it fixed?
- It's fixed.

94
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,869
Take that!

95
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:20,569
You're dead.

96
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,876
Practicing to kill, are ya, lad?

97
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:28,079
Hello, Mr. Shea.

98
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:31,651
You got any spare change you
ain't put in that toy gun there?

99
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:34,118
That was my last nickel.

100
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:35,745
Have you seen
your father, then?

101
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:39,487
We were in the war together.

102
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:43,061
Here's the thing about the war.

103
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:47,266
You don't think.
You just shoot and you shoot...

104
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:49,029
and then you pray
you come home.

105
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,800
It's the thinking
that gets you killed.

106
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:05,209
Eddie! Eddie!
The skeeball's broken.

107
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,476
Come on, Eddie,
come on, come on!

108
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:20,687
It's just the lever here.
There ya go, boys.

109
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:21,961
Juggle.

110
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:24,164
Yeah! Juggle, Eddie! Come on!

111
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:27,930
Alright, alright...
you got the magic ball.

112
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,039
How does he do it, folks?

113
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:33,073
Greatest show on earth...

114
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:35,610
watch him, buddy boys,
and you will be amazed...

115
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:37,168
Excuse me...

116
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:40,011
Excuse me.

117
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:45,247
What?

118
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:51,793
My friends and I were looking
for some of those lemon fizzes.

119
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:56,131
Yeah, right over there
by the carousel.

120
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,463
But that stand's closed already.

121
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:02,531
But I can fix that...

122
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,627
So, do you have a key
for all the food stands?

123
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:20,458
I got a key for everything.

124
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,533
Well, to be honest,
they're my Pop's keys...

125
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:28,837
He's the maintenance...
he fixes stuff here.

126
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:30,203
I'm just helping him out...

127
00:12:30,238 --> 00:12:32,297
to save up enough money
for engineering school.

128
00:12:33,808 --> 00:12:35,742
After the army, of course.

129
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:40,882
- You enlisted?
- Last week.

130
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:42,645
I gotta do my part.

131
00:12:44,786 --> 00:12:46,419
Well... I better get back.

132
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:49,480
My friend's will think I swam off
into the ocean or something.

133
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,258
A souvenir.

134
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,808
I don't know your name.

135
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:08,298
Marguerite.

136
00:13:09,444 --> 00:13:11,144
I'm Eddie.

137
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,477
Thanks for the fizz, Eddie.

138
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,360
It's the birthday boy!

139
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:28,391
Happy birthday, boss!

140
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:34,306
C'mon, Eddie. Live it up.
You only get a birthday, what?

141
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:36,240
Once a year?

142
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,175
Sounds about right.

143
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:41,146
How old are you now?

144
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:42,909
Old.

145
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:46,585
Man, I hope I live
to be as old as you.

146
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,303
Why?

147
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:49,986
Dom...

148
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:52,774
put the tools in the right spot.

149
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,325
Them labels are there
for a reason.

150
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,868
Hey, don't forget,
I'm off next week.

151
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:07,963
Me and Maria going to Miami
for our anniversary.

152
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:14,078
- You ever been to Miami?
- Me?

153
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:16,915
I never been anywhere I wasn't
shipped to with a rifle.

154
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,473
Here...

155
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:21,986
Naw... I can't.

156
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:24,290
Buy your wife something nice.

157
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:25,780
You sure?

158
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:30,156
Thanks, man.

159
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:39,181
Marguerite you want
to do the honors?

160
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,900
- Who's this from?
- I don't know...

161
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:20,437
<i>You made me love you</i>

162
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:28,377
<i>All the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it</i>

163
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:32,280
<i>You made happy</i>

164
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:34,050
You look swell tonight.

165
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:35,642
Thank you.

166
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,920
Eddie.

167
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:41,656
Are you afraid?

168
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,286
- I'd be afraid.
- You ain't the fightin' type.

169
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:55,304
Look at it this way. I get to
see some faraway places, right?

170
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:57,238
I always wanted to do that.

171
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,742
I've never been more than
five miles from here.

172
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:03,112
Me, neither...
But that's gonna change.

173
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:04,746
Really?

174
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:07,716
I ain't spending the rest
of my life at Ruby Pier.

175
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:16,920
Marguerite...

176
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:22,189
You don't have to ask me.

177
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,690
I don't?

178
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:29,004
- Ask you what? - To wait.

179
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:40,945
Just don't die, ok?

180
00:16:42,185 --> 00:16:43,812
I ain't gonna die.

181
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:47,447
I ain't gonna die...

182
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:07,522
<i>Eddie! Eddie!</i>

183
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:10,355
I see it! I see it!
Get up there!

184
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,535
Alright everybody, stay calm...
stay calm!

185
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,671
Who's up there with ya?

186
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:22,670
Willie!

187
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:25,007
Okay, tell Willie to release
the safety bars...

188
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:27,908
<i>green button, rear panel...
you got it?</i>

189
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:31,097
Then send down that cart!

190
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,249
Everybody just stay calm...

191
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:35,046
Hydraulics, gears...

192
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:39,187
- cables...
- Rear panel, safety box...

193
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:45,726
It's the cable...

194
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:47,353
This will all be over
in a few minutes...

195
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,706
Don't release the cart...
it's gonna fall...

196
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,172
it's gonna fall!

197
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:01,677
Get back, all of ya's!
Get back! Back!

198
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:03,846
It's gonna fall! Get back!

199
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:06,178
Back! Move!

200
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:11,016
All of ya's, get back... move!

201
00:19:13,923 --> 00:19:15,686
Get back, it's gonna fall!

202
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,885
<i>This is a story about
a man named Eddie.</i>

203
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:49,758
<i>But the end of his life
was only the beginning.</i>

204
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:12,082
<i>Eddie saw nothing of his
final moment on earth...</i>

205
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:16,418
<i>He felt no pain from his death.</i>

206
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:22,361
<i>All he felt was lightness,
and calm...</i>

207
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:27,572
<i>as if every hurt he had
ever suffered...</i>

208
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:29,597
<i>had been washed away.</i>

209
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:35,804
<i>And then he woke up.</i>

210
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:48,242
Dad, please, don't, no please don't do it...

211
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,809
<i>How about him,
ladies and gentlemen?</i>

212
00:22:31,844 --> 00:22:35,644
<i>Have you ever seen
a more horrible sight?</i>

213
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:45,855
<i>Look well upon this savage!
He is not of the human race!</i>

214
00:22:57,736 --> 00:23:00,103
<i>From the farthest corners
of the earth...</i>

215
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:04,598
<i>we bring you this tragic soul
for your examination...</i>

216
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:34,808
Hello, Edward.

217
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,010
I have been waiting for you.

218
00:23:44,492 --> 00:23:47,893
<i>Eddie had seen this man
before in his life.</i>

219
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:58,536
<i>He didn't know why
he was seeing him again.</i>

220
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:03,046
Your body feels like
a child's, no?

221
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:11,522
You were a child
when you knew me...

222
00:24:11,557 --> 00:24:13,756
that's why.

223
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:17,454
You start here with the same
feelings you had on earth.

224
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:23,528
You can't talk
when you first arrive.

225
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:28,326
God's little lesson, I suppose.

226
00:24:38,515 --> 00:24:40,506
Helps you listen.

227
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:03,607
Tell me something.
The 'Bullwhip'.

228
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:09,574
Is it still the fastest
roller coaster on earth?

229
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,921
I figured as much.

230
00:25:17,992 --> 00:25:21,160
Nothing changes here.

231
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:25,528
And there is no peering down
from the clouds, I'm afraid.

232
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:34,373
Yes.

233
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,786
An accident.

234
00:25:46,994 --> 00:25:48,689
How long ago?

235
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:53,697
A minute. An hour.

236
00:25:53,732 --> 00:25:56,364
A thousand years.

237
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,493
No, Eddie. Your father will do it.

238
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:00,897
Where are you?

239
00:26:03,277 --> 00:26:05,074
Where do you think?

240
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:12,351
Heaven.

241
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:25,470
There are five people you meet
in heaven, Edward.

242
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:29,369
Each one of us was
in your life for a reason.

243
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:42,822
People think of heaven
as a Garden Of Eden...

244
00:26:42,857 --> 00:26:44,687
mountains, rivers.

245
00:26:46,723 --> 00:26:47,519
to help him find your father.

246
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:50,294
But what is scenery
without solace?

247
00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:27,547
When I died, my life is
lluminated by five others.

248
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:30,141
And then I came here
to wait for you.

249
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,742
To tell you my story.
Which becomes part of yours.

250
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,725
Did you ever dance here?

251
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,023
I never danced with a woman.

252
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:50,827
I was a nervous boy,
and a nervous man.

253
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,969
Everything scared me.

254
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:56,440
<i>What the hell's wrong
with you?</i>

255
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,442
<i>You were born
with two left feet!</i>

256
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:02,715
A chemist, for my problem,
gave me silver nitrate.

257
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,205
You know this?

258
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,685
Yes. A poison, today.

259
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,321
But we were not
so smart back then.

260
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:15,261
I drank it and when it didn't
work, I drank more.

261
00:28:15,296 --> 00:28:18,364
It turned my skin this color.

262
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,198
A side effect.

263
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:22,224
Permanent, I'm afraid.

264
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:25,594
My life as a man was over.

265
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:29,403
My life as a freak had begun.

266
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:40,736
I had many names.

267
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:43,354
Algeria. Tanzania.

268
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,459
I had never been
to any of those places.

269
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:48,825
It made me feel... exotic.

270
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:55,134
One summer, I came here.
Ruby Pier.

271
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:57,835
The ocean. The sand.

272
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,207
I could walk in the mornings,
before the customers arrived.

273
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:04,233
I can feel the sea breeze.
Like a normal man.

274
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,510
I was happy here
until the day I died.

275
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:15,251
You see, Edward.
This is not your heaven.

276
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,014
It's mine.

277
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:30,799
What?

278
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:33,956
What...

279
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:35,608
killed...

280
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:37,235
you?

281
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,174
You did.

282
00:30:09,526 --> 00:30:11,153
You see the boy?

283
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:18,358
See the man in the car?

284
00:30:21,672 --> 00:30:24,197
It was only my second time.

285
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:29,376
I so loved it, behind
the wheel of an automobile.

286
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,216
Like a normal man.

287
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:37,484
Watch it... look out!

288
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:52,208
What I almost did.
That little boy.

289
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:56,812
My blood was rushing.

290
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,475
My heart was not strong.

291
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:03,815
And it surrendered.

292
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:12,229
The police wrote 'heart attack'
on the official papers.

293
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:14,459
No one saw.
No one knew.

294
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:19,993
No one pays much notice to

295
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:15,970
I had... no pain.

296
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:29,612
People just...
go on with their lives...

297
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:36,585
You see now
why you are here...little boy?

298
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:44,910
God help me, Mister.
I didn't mean it...

299
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,944
You dying...
I didn't know!

300
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:49,015
But how could you know?
You were only a child.

301
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,917
So now I gotta pay, right?

302
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,452
- Pay?
- For my sin?

303
00:31:54,487 --> 00:31:57,221
That's what I'm here for,
right? Justice?

304
00:31:57,256 --> 00:32:00,593
No, no, no, no. You are here
so I can teach you something.

305
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,193
Each one of your five people...

306
00:32:02,228 --> 00:32:05,463
has one such thing
to show you, to illuminate.

307
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:09,434
By the end, what you did not
understand in life, you will.

308
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:12,404
<i>But why do I have
to wear Joe's shoes?</i>

309
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:15,339
<i>- Quiet!
- Stop wiggling!</i>

310
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:18,676
But it's my birthday!
I don't want to go.

311
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:21,247
Well, sometimes you have to do
things you don't want to do.

312
00:32:21,282 --> 00:32:24,842
I remember this...
we had to go to a funeral...

313
00:32:24,621 --> 00:32:27,215
But it's my birthday!

314
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,627
What did I say?

315
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:35,187
What did I say?
I said be quiet!

316
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:45,239
Ma?

317
00:32:48,514 --> 00:32:50,106
Come on, son.

318
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,847
I did not attract
a big crowd that day.

319
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:20,086
But it's not fair!

320
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:22,424
It was my own stupidity,
running out there like that.

321
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,016
I should have been
the one killed...

322
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,818
not you!

323
00:33:30,265 --> 00:33:33,464
Fairness does not
govern life and death.

324
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:36,664
If it did, no good man
would ever die young.

325
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:42,275
During my time on earth...

326
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,710
people died instead
of me, too.

327
00:33:45,714 --> 00:33:49,816
There are no random acts.
We are all connected.

328
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:57,133
- Good comes from it.
- Good?

329
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,337
What good came from this?
You died.

330
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:00,986
Well...

331
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:02,601
you lived.

332
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,705
But I barely knew you.
We were strangers.

333
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:17,916
Strangers are just family
you have yet to come to know.

334
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:36,672
I am leaving now, Edward.

335
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:37,634
Wait...

336
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:42,247
The little girl
at the pier?

337
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:45,851
I tried to save her...
I felt her hands...

338
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:48,354
I musta pulled her...
I can't remember after that...

339
00:34:48,724 --> 00:34:52,387
Did I save her? Was the last
thing I did a failure, too?

340
00:34:53,996 --> 00:34:56,089
I cannot answer that.

341
00:34:57,332 --> 00:34:59,935
Then... my life was a waste...

342
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,062
No life is a waste.

343
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:13,747
There will be others.

344
00:35:15,454 --> 00:35:16,648
Can I ask you...

345
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:17,421
where are you going?

346
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:22,894
I'm not.

347
00:35:36,388 --> 00:35:38,253
Couldn't sleep.

348
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:40,952
Me, neither.

349
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,903
When you think they'll
open us up again?

350
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,463
I don't know.
Ask the police.

351
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:02,439
I still can't believe it,

352
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:05,851
I always thought he was too stubborn to die.

353
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:17,262
<i>There was a second
heaven for Eddie...</i>

354
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:22,097
<i>although heaven was not
the word he would have chosen.</i>

355
00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:33,711
<i>His body felt
older now, stronger.</i>

356
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:39,248
<i>And he ran with the hard,
measured steps of a soldier.</i>

357
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:22,132
Smallpox!

358
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,868
Smallpox! Typhoid!

359
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,410
Tetanus!

360
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,175
Yellow Fever!

361
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:35,302
You know, I never did find out
what the hell Yellow Fever was.

362
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:39,156
All them shots, for all those
diseases, and I still died here...

363
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:44,095
anyhow, healthy as a horse.
Doesn't seem right, does it?

364
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,564
Coulda saved my arm
all them pokey needles.

365
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:47,895
Who are you?

366
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,262
How do you like them apples?

367
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,442
Come on.
That was funny.

368
00:37:58,477 --> 00:37:59,875
Come on down!

369
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,743
Come on up!

370
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,551
Ah, you don't wanna look down.

371
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,527
It'll only make ya dizzy.

372
00:38:28,604 --> 00:38:30,538
They explain the rules
to you, soldier?

373
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:36,255
- I'm dead...
- You got that right.

374
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,891
You're my second person?

375
00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:41,458
Got that right, too.

376
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:43,825
Left you your helmet.
And your old rifle.

377
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:47,058
Not that they're much use
to ya here.

378
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:51,114
Captain?

379
00:38:51,149 --> 00:38:52,827
Affirmative.

380
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,976
Betcha didn't expect me, huh?

381
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,200
War changes men

382
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:21,000
It fills them with fear, with courage,
with a sense of adventure

383
00:39:21,074 --> 00:39:22,341
Hey Goldilocks...

384
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:23,721
it'll take you a lot
longer than that...

385
00:39:23,756 --> 00:39:25,067
to get as pretty as me,
you know that!

386
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Eddie had wanted to see a world
beyond Ruby Pier,

387
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,300
and for a while he did.

388
00:39:38,436 --> 00:39:41,530
<i>Dog Zero Six, this is
Able Zero Six, over.</i>

389
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,307
<i>Dog Zero Six, if you copy,
break squelch, twice, over.</i>

390
00:39:46,848 --> 00:39:50,052
C'mon, Rabozzo, ya stickpin.
Pick it up!

391
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,518
It's hot.

392
00:39:51,553 --> 00:39:53,384
And I got all this
extra stuff to carry.

393
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:57,559
Ah, I'm sorry Daisy, you got a
little stain on your dress, there?

394
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:07,674
I can't...

395
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:10,761
You can't? What do you
mean, you can't?

396
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:12,779
What are you going
to just sit there?

397
00:40:12,814 --> 00:40:14,817
- Get up! Hey, get up!
- Hold on, Morton, hold on.

398
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:17,820
Before you go killing anybody.
I got a better idea.

399
00:40:17,855 --> 00:40:19,685
Give me your pack, Rabozzo.

400
00:40:20,756 --> 00:40:22,121
Come on.

401
00:40:25,928 --> 00:40:29,798
I'll race you to the Captain.
I'll carry his pack...

402
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,401
Ioser's gotta carry it
till dark.

403
00:40:32,436 --> 00:40:34,470
Okay, Goldilocks.
You're on.

404
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:36,470
You sure you can do that,
Eddie?

405
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:39,273
You ever run up a roller coaster
with a sledgehammer?

406
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:40,173
Come on, Rabozzo, go.

407
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,111
Say your prayers, buddy boy.

408
00:40:50,185 --> 00:40:52,387
- What the hell you grunts doing?
- It's a race, Cap!

409
00:40:52,422 --> 00:40:54,854
A race! That's open ground!

410
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:57,286
On three. One... two...

411
00:41:03,966 --> 00:41:05,524
Look at Eddie go.

412
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:09,709
Open up!

413
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:15,778
Come on, Eddie!

414
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:34,815
Captain?

415
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,564
It is you.

416
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:42,840
But you look...

417
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,469
Like the last time you saw me?

418
00:41:49,015 --> 00:41:53,786
See, time ain't what
you think it is, kid.

419
00:41:53,821 --> 00:41:55,887
Either is dying.

420
00:41:58,922 --> 00:42:00,192
Aw, you're right.

421
00:42:00,988 --> 00:42:03,457
No reason to spit up here.

422
00:42:03,492 --> 00:42:05,774
No reason to smoke.

423
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:08,057
Old habits, I guess.

424
00:42:09,597 --> 00:42:11,330
Look, Captain... sir.

425
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:14,368
No reason for that either,
but much obliged.

426
00:42:14,403 --> 00:42:17,371
Captain, there's some
kinda mistake going on.

427
00:42:17,406 --> 00:42:19,939
I mean. I don't belong here.

428
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:23,143
I lived a nothin' life, see?
I never went nowhere.

429
00:42:23,178 --> 00:42:25,879
I never accomplished
anything worth note.

430
00:42:25,914 --> 00:42:28,165
Couldn't find a job?

431
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,382
No. No, I had a job.

432
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:35,689
A dumb job. I fixed the rides
at this amusement park.

433
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,281
Ruby Pier.

434
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:40,292
Ruby Pier.

435
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:43,731
That's the place you always used
to tell us about, right?

436
00:42:43,766 --> 00:42:47,566
We were all gonna go there
when the war was done.

437
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:51,503
'Free rides with the prettiest
ladies in the tunnel of love.'

438
00:42:56,543 --> 00:42:58,238
That's right.

439
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:02,383
You ever seen them boys again?

440
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:04,374
Morton? Smitty?

441
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:10,886
Morton... Smitty...

442
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,031
Throw the pineapple!

443
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:21,302
Throw it, Johnny, come on!

444
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:23,463
Johnny!
The grenade!

445
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:42,783
<i>Eddie learned
the quiet prayers of war.</i>

446
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,227
<i>He learned to go
days without rest...</i>

447
00:43:47,262 --> 00:43:49,388
<i>and nights without sleep.</i>

448
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:53,934
<i>He learned how
to take a prisoner...</i>

449
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:56,702
<i>but not how to become one.</i>

450
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:59,501
<i>And then one night,
in the Philippines...</i>

451
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:02,933
<i>he learned that, too.</i>

452
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,896
- Who's that?
- Shut it, kid.

453
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:19,236
Aw, you bastards...

454
00:44:26,444 --> 00:44:27,968
You heard him, kid.
Shut it.

455
00:44:32,016 --> 00:44:33,711
They're gonna kill us.

456
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:39,824
I never saw none of them
boys after the war.

457
00:44:39,859 --> 00:44:43,728
Well, people lose touch...

458
00:44:43,763 --> 00:44:45,829
- So.
- What?

459
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:48,924
You went back to that park,
you took that job. Then what?

460
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:53,405
Then nothing. I never left.

461
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,554
I meant to. But I...

462
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:57,669
things never worked out.

463
00:44:59,377 --> 00:45:02,879
Money. My leg.

464
00:45:02,914 --> 00:45:05,382
I never really got the war
out of my head.

465
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:09,218
Maybe you weren't supposed to.

466
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:24,097
- What? - I missed you so much.

467
00:46:54,176 --> 00:46:56,076
What happened during the war?

468
00:46:54,297 --> 00:46:56,299
One more sip for me,
okay champ?

469
00:46:56,334 --> 00:46:58,062
Do that for me...

470
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:02,071
Good. That's it.

471
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:05,710
What is it?

472
00:47:05,745 --> 00:47:08,339
In this rat hole?
Could be anything.

473
00:47:08,882 --> 00:47:10,985
He can't keep his food down.

474
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,384
What food?

475
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:14,188
I'm freezing...

476
00:47:14,223 --> 00:47:15,655
Oh God...

477
00:47:17,992 --> 00:47:20,927
Easy, buddy boy... easy.

478
00:47:28,505 --> 00:47:30,672
Where is everybody?

479
00:47:30,707 --> 00:47:33,075
They're losing this war...

480
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:36,136
How desperate do they gotta be
using us to do this?

481
00:47:37,914 --> 00:47:40,517
I figure some go awol
every night.

482
00:47:40,552 --> 00:47:42,576
Rats off a sinking ship.

483
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:48,313
- How much longer?
- Not much.

484
00:47:52,464 --> 00:47:54,192
Now the oil barrels.

485
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,834
So?

486
00:47:56,869 --> 00:47:59,505
The oil's for burning
the evidence.

487
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,268
They're digging our graves.

488
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,238
He's sick...

489
00:48:15,487 --> 00:48:17,890
He's sick, you son of a bitch!

490
00:48:17,925 --> 00:48:19,687
For God's sake, Eddie.

491
00:48:35,007 --> 00:48:36,974
No!

492
00:48:37,342 --> 00:48:41,108
No!

493
00:49:07,483 --> 00:49:10,281
I used to pray every night
during the war.

494
00:49:12,587 --> 00:49:13,920
I'd take Marguerite's picture...

495
00:49:13,955 --> 00:49:16,082
and I'd make these deals
with God, see.

496
00:49:17,492 --> 00:49:19,859
I'd say...

497
00:49:19,894 --> 00:49:22,697
I'll give you one more
week as a soldier...

498
00:49:22,732 --> 00:49:24,664
if you give me
one more week with her.

499
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:27,964
I'll give you one more month
in this life...

500
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:32,204
if you give me one month
in that one.

501
00:49:35,243 --> 00:49:37,010
Used to?

502
00:49:37,045 --> 00:49:40,447
I stopped the night
they shot Rabozzo.

503
00:49:40,482 --> 00:49:42,609
All I could think about
after that was getting out.

504
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:47,178
I was gonna take care
of myself, if I made it...

505
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:49,916
in one piece.

506
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:53,086
That never happened,
of course.

507
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,163
You know,
it's the damndest thing.

508
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:03,827
I'm dead.

509
00:50:05,106 --> 00:50:07,267
But I feel...
I feel healthy.

510
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:14,241
You still juggle?

511
00:50:44,512 --> 00:50:46,343
Captain...

512
00:50:49,024 --> 00:50:50,992
I think we got a chance here.

513
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:51,749
Captain...

514
00:51:00,869 --> 00:51:03,402
What're you talking about?

515
00:51:03,437 --> 00:51:05,935
- I can juggle.
- What?

516
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,744
I can juggle.
Them rocks.

517
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:17,316
Hey!

518
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:21,716
Hey you! Over here!

519
00:51:24,092 --> 00:51:25,423
I can juggle...

520
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:28,258
Juggle?

521
00:51:29,664 --> 00:51:31,894
Yeah, here. Lemme try.

522
00:51:34,836 --> 00:51:38,203
Lemme try. I can do it.

523
00:51:40,909 --> 00:51:42,433
What's going on?

524
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:51,876
Okay?

525
00:51:56,625 --> 00:52:00,562
Huh, you like that?
Yeah, see?

526
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:02,928
Okay, give me one more.

527
00:52:04,099 --> 00:52:06,234
- Motto.
- Motto?

528
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:08,335
Yeah, one more.

529
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:10,930
One more...
I can do it.

530
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:15,476
Yeah, motto.
I'll juggle them for you.

531
00:52:20,415 --> 00:52:21,882
Alright...

532
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:27,249
Yeah, he's good...

533
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,890
Good...

534
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:32,127
Good, huh?
Pretty good, huh?

535
00:52:32,162 --> 00:52:34,322
Good!
Boy can juggle!

536
00:52:35,764 --> 00:52:37,532
- Motto...
- Motto?

537
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:39,568
Yeah, four!

538
00:52:39,603 --> 00:52:42,102
Four?

539
00:52:42,137 --> 00:52:44,731
Four rocks, yeah, I can do it.

540
00:52:51,846 --> 00:52:53,815
I'll get whosever
closest to the door...

541
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,115
Morton?

542
00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:04,151
Yeah, right here...
right here.

543
00:53:07,162 --> 00:53:09,781
They're giving us rocks.

544
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:11,892
Okay... it's okay... okay.

545
00:53:11,927 --> 00:53:13,969
Just having some fun...

546
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:16,267
Juggle... juggle.

547
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:24,645
You really this good?

548
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,879
I used to pitch, Captain.

549
00:53:30,518 --> 00:53:31,618
Look at this, huh?

550
00:53:31,653 --> 00:53:34,923
Isn't he something else,
ladies and gents?

551
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:37,949
You get the one on the left,
alright!

552
00:53:43,531 --> 00:53:46,501
Smitty, you get
the one on the right...

553
00:53:46,536 --> 00:53:49,505
- Okay, ready for four?
- Four!

554
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,474
- You guys ready for four?
- Four!

555
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:54,310
- Four?
- Four!

556
00:53:54,345 --> 00:53:56,111
On my count, guys...

557
00:53:56,146 --> 00:53:57,339
One!

558
00:53:59,214 --> 00:54:01,032
Two!

559
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:02,772
Three...

560
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:04,478
Four!

561
00:54:36,459 --> 00:54:37,358
Can you?

562
00:54:45,827 --> 00:54:47,385
For Rabozzo.

563
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:02,536
It was war, Eddie.

564
00:55:04,379 --> 00:55:06,404
I never stopped thinking about it...

565
00:55:07,882 --> 00:55:11,553
my whole life...
these dreams...

566
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:13,817
Every soldier has dreams.

567
00:55:14,856 --> 00:55:16,389
We coulda just run.

568
00:55:16,424 --> 00:55:18,483
We didn't have to destroy
the whole place.

569
00:55:20,095 --> 00:55:22,791
What did you see?
In those dreams?

570
00:55:27,068 --> 00:55:29,696
Hey, Eddie, what you doing?

571
00:55:38,246 --> 00:55:40,680
Yeah, burn it down, Eddie!

572
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,581
Burn the whole place down!

573
00:55:52,527 --> 00:55:53,824
Fire in the hole!

574
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:29,410
Eddie! Come on!

575
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:31,785
Let's go! Let's go!

576
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,597
Eddie, what are you doing?
Are you coming?

577
00:56:37,632 --> 00:56:39,831
Is somebody in there?

578
00:56:39,866 --> 00:56:42,235
Eddie, Eddie,
we gotta go... come on!

579
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:43,635
There's somebody in there!

580
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,521
Come on, we gotta go,
let's go now!

581
00:56:45,556 --> 00:56:47,373
I think there's
somebody in there!

582
00:56:47,408 --> 00:56:50,260
Eddie... Movin' out! Let's go!

583
00:56:50,295 --> 00:56:53,077
You'll die in there! Come out!

584
00:56:53,112 --> 00:56:56,516
Eddie! There's nobody in there,
let's go!

585
00:56:56,551 --> 00:56:58,869
Come on, we gotta go, now!

586
00:56:58,904 --> 00:57:01,187
Come out! I won't shoot you...

587
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:15,057
I'm a soldier...
I'm a soldier...

588
00:57:42,061 --> 00:57:44,154
You remember how
you got out of there?

589
00:57:47,049 --> 00:57:48,949
Tala?

590
00:57:49,903 --> 00:57:52,472
That bullet got you good.

591
00:57:52,507 --> 00:57:54,167
Lost a lot of blood.

592
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,448
Those planes firing.

593
00:57:58,616 --> 00:58:00,000
I never saw it coming...

594
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:02,313
Everything changed after that.

595
00:58:03,723 --> 00:58:06,059
I couldn't run no more.

596
00:58:06,094 --> 00:58:08,360
Couldn't play baseball.

597
00:58:08,395 --> 00:58:10,886
I used to swim the ocean
like a fish...

598
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:15,033
You didn't stop walking.

599
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:18,193
No, I just stopped... moving.

600
00:58:19,306 --> 00:58:21,934
I sorta sat down in my life.

601
00:58:29,783 --> 00:58:32,616
I ever tell you I come
from a military family?

602
00:58:34,788 --> 00:58:36,779
My father was a soldier...

603
00:58:38,124 --> 00:58:40,718
his father, and his father, too.

604
00:58:42,162 --> 00:58:44,931
At the dinner table it was
'yes, sir, no sir.'

605
00:58:44,966 --> 00:58:47,456
All I did was take orders.

606
00:58:49,069 --> 00:58:52,561
Then along comes a war, and all of a sudden, I'm giving orders.

607
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,608
Kids are looking at me
for answers.

608
00:58:55,643 --> 00:58:57,577
They thought I could
keep 'em alive.

609
00:58:57,612 --> 00:58:59,374
You did too, didn't ya?

610
00:59:06,219 --> 00:59:07,986
I couldn't, of course.

611
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:10,012
I took orders
like everyone else.

612
00:59:11,391 --> 00:59:12,924
But I thought...

613
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:15,460
if I couldn't keep you alive...

614
00:59:15,495 --> 00:59:17,520
at least I could
keep you together.

615
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:21,726
In the middle of big war, you grab at them little ideas.

616
00:59:25,005 --> 00:59:27,098
We're going home together.

617
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:29,764
That's right.

618
00:59:32,412 --> 00:59:34,175
Going home together...

619
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:38,316
meant a lot, Captain.

620
00:59:46,426 --> 00:59:48,223
I hope so.

621
00:59:53,698 --> 00:59:55,359
Why do you say that?

622
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,895
'Cause I was the one
who shot you.

623
00:59:59,555 --> 00:59:59,555


624
00:59:59,555 --> 00:59:59,555
Keep going!

625
00:59:59,555 --> 00:59:59,555


626
00:59:59,555 --> 00:59:59,555


627
00:59:59,555 --> 00:59:59,555


628
00:59:59,555 --> 00:59:59,555


629
00:59:59,555 --> 00:59:59,555


630
00:59:59,555 --> 00:59:59,555


631
00:59:59,555 --> 00:59:59,555


632
00:59:59,555 --> 00:59:59,555


633
00:59:59,555 --> 00:59:59,555


634
01:00:03,396 --> 01:00:05,242
Not you...

635
01:00:05,277 --> 01:00:07,089
Not you...

636
01:00:11,371 --> 01:00:13,338
Not you!

637
01:00:13,373 --> 01:00:15,068
Get it out...

638
01:00:17,944 --> 01:00:20,071
- Go ahead.
- Not you!

639
01:00:29,757 --> 01:00:32,776
<i>The story of the tragedy
at Ruby Pier...</i>

640
01:00:32,811 --> 01:00:35,795
<i>was in the newspapers
for several days.</i>

641
01:00:36,604 --> 01:00:39,232
<i>Then other stories
took its place.</i>

642
01:00:51,155 --> 01:00:53,424
Well, pretty tidy
for an old guy.

643
01:00:53,459 --> 01:00:55,324
Are you surprised?

644
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,892
Don't think we'll find any
bank statements in there.

645
01:01:03,767 --> 01:01:06,470
It's the same apartment
Eddie grew up in.

646
01:01:06,505 --> 01:01:08,704
I don't know why
he never moved out.

647
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:10,536
You'd think he'd want
some air conditioning.

648
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,140
You'd think he'd want
a change of scenery.

649
01:01:27,342 --> 01:01:28,037
all this time...

650
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:31,526
There's the soldier boy.

651
01:01:33,598 --> 01:01:35,190
Hey, Eddie.

652
01:01:37,002 --> 01:01:38,765
Happy birthday, son.

653
01:01:39,805 --> 01:01:41,204
Here's your cake.

654
01:01:44,109 --> 01:01:46,243
Happy birthday...

655
01:01:46,278 --> 01:01:47,802
Happy birthday, Eddie.

656
01:01:54,786 --> 01:01:57,338
Happy birthday, Eddie.

657
01:01:57,373 --> 01:01:59,891
Joe, you got matches?

658
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:01,415
Here you go...

659
01:02:07,866 --> 01:02:09,333
Alright...

660
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,506
Good job.

661
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:18,475
You're alright, son.

662
01:02:21,713 --> 01:02:24,648
So he looks pretty good, all
things considered, don't he Pop?

663
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,839
You look really good, son...

664
01:02:33,874 --> 01:02:35,989
Really, you look good, Eddie.

665
01:02:42,034 --> 01:02:43,836
You bastard!
How could you do that?

666
01:02:43,871 --> 01:02:45,638
- How could you do that?
- Get it out.

667
01:02:45,673 --> 01:02:48,672
My leg! My leg!

668
01:02:48,707 --> 01:02:50,209
- My life!
- Get it out...

669
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:52,443
My life! Why?

670
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:56,847
- I had to.
- Why? Why?

671
01:02:56,882 --> 01:02:59,544
I took your leg
to save your life.

672
01:03:03,756 --> 01:03:06,058
You would have died
in that fire.

673
01:03:06,093 --> 01:03:07,124
You were obsessed.

674
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:09,260
You damn near knocked
Morton unconscious.

675
01:03:09,295 --> 01:03:12,031
Another second and you
woulda been so deep in...

676
01:03:12,066 --> 01:03:14,398
none of us
could have gotten you.

677
01:03:14,433 --> 01:03:18,838
There was nobody in that hut...
what was I thinking?

678
01:03:18,873 --> 01:03:21,906
I seen it happen
a hundred times.

679
01:03:21,941 --> 01:03:27,079
A soldier reaches a certain
point and he's done.

680
01:03:27,114 --> 01:03:28,746
Sometimes,
in the dead of night...

681
01:03:28,781 --> 01:03:32,201
a man'll just come out of his
tent just start walking...

682
01:03:32,236 --> 01:03:35,621
like he lives around the corner,
like he's going home.

683
01:03:35,656 --> 01:03:39,992
- Why didn't I just die?
- Wasn't your time to die.

684
01:03:40,027 --> 01:03:43,463
I couldn't just let you
burn alive.

685
01:03:43,498 --> 01:03:46,416
I figured a leg
wound would heal...

686
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:48,927
Morton pulled you
out of there.

687
01:03:48,962 --> 01:03:51,368
And the others got you home.

688
01:03:51,403 --> 01:03:54,271
What do you mean
'the others' got me home?

689
01:03:54,306 --> 01:03:56,442
It's just like I told you.
Tetanus? Yellow fever?

690
01:04:10,745 --> 01:04:12,747
I'm gonna blow that lock
and check around the curve.

691
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:14,339
Keep an eye out.

692
01:04:15,616 --> 01:04:17,447
Hang on, Eddie!

693
01:04:28,095 --> 01:04:29,729
We're going home.

694
01:04:29,764 --> 01:04:33,601
You wanna go home, don't ya?
Eddie! Look at me!

695
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:37,628
Hey! Look at me!
Look at me! Eyes open!

696
01:04:44,278 --> 01:04:45,939
That's one of ours...

697
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,463
Captain?

698
01:05:26,954 --> 01:05:29,149
I don't remember
none of this...

699
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:32,927
I figure what was left of me...

700
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,363
landed in about
a thousand places.

701
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,063
Including here.

702
01:05:37,098 --> 01:05:39,065
This is where you're buried?

703
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:42,637
That's a fancy way
of saying it, but yeah.

704
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,136
This was my 'funeral'...

705
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:47,375
Smitty, Morton... I never
saw them at the hospital.

706
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:48,908
When I got home,
I didn't open mail.

707
01:05:48,943 --> 01:05:52,310
I didn't ask questions.
I just wanted to forget.

708
01:05:53,347 --> 01:05:55,516
You've been here all this time?

709
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,650
Waitin' for you.

710
01:05:57,685 --> 01:05:59,954
That's what the Blue Man said.

711
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:02,054
Well, he was, too.

712
01:06:02,089 --> 01:06:04,125
But he had something
to teach you...

713
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,456
and now he's moved on.

714
01:06:06,494 --> 01:06:08,655
And I'm fixing to do the same.

715
01:06:14,335 --> 01:06:16,604
What are you here?

716
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,401
Sacrifice.

717
01:06:24,345 --> 01:06:26,979
I made one.
You made one.

718
01:06:27,014 --> 01:06:29,348
But you had the wrong
idea about yours.

719
01:06:29,383 --> 01:06:32,978
You got angry. Kept thinking
about what you lost.

720
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:48,701
You didn't get it.

721
01:06:48,736 --> 01:06:52,707
Sacrifice ain't something
to be ashamed of.

722
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,641
It's something
to be proud of.

723
01:06:57,778 --> 01:07:00,514
If people stop sacrificing
for one another...

724
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:02,539
they lose what
makes them human.

725
01:07:04,085 --> 01:07:06,315
It's the noblest thing we do.

726
01:07:08,322 --> 01:07:10,523
But you lost everything.

727
01:07:10,558 --> 01:07:14,126
Well, that's the thing
about sacrifice.

728
01:07:14,161 --> 01:07:17,228
Sometimes when you think
you're losing something...

729
01:07:17,263 --> 01:07:20,295
you're really just passing
it on to someone else.

730
01:07:49,397 --> 01:07:51,695
Forgive me about the leg?

731
01:08:01,842 --> 01:08:04,003
That's what I was waiting for.

732
01:08:05,379 --> 01:08:07,176
- Captain.
- Yeah?

733
01:08:08,582 --> 01:08:10,379
Why this place?

734
01:08:11,419 --> 01:08:15,022
I mean, you can choose
anywhere to wait... right?

735
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:18,793
Well, I died knowing almost
nothing but war.

736
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:22,530
I wanted to see what
the world looked like...

737
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:25,166
before we started
killing each other...

738
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:28,602
Before war. But this is war.

739
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:35,176
Our eyes ain't
the same, soldier.

740
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,076
This is what I see.

741
01:08:57,898 --> 01:09:00,466
By the way, I don't smoke.

742
01:09:00,501 --> 01:09:04,205
That was all in your eyes, too.

743
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,196
Who smokes in heaven?

744
01:09:21,522 --> 01:09:23,114
This is yours...

745
01:09:25,192 --> 01:09:27,244
Well...

746
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:28,888
Good luck.

747
01:09:28,923 --> 01:09:30,463
Wait...

748
01:09:30,498 --> 01:09:33,801
Wait. The little girl
at the pier, did I save her?

749
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,570
I can't remember.
I only felt...

750
01:09:38,991 --> 01:09:41,308
I just wanna know, that's all.

751
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:43,003
I can't tell you.

752
01:09:48,482 --> 01:09:50,347
But someone can.

753
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,098
Come on! Let's get some
ice off the truck!

754
01:10:11,849 --> 01:10:13,578
C'mon, Eddie!

755
01:10:14,355 --> 01:10:15,607
C'mon, you can
hit it, let's go!

756
01:10:15,642 --> 01:10:17,718
Give it a ride, Eddie!
Murder the ball!

757
01:10:17,753 --> 01:10:19,795
Eddie can't hit it past
the first sewer!

758
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:21,490
Strike him out.

759
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,555
Go kid.

760
01:10:31,503 --> 01:10:32,061
Keep going, kid.

761
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:12,957
Got these for you.

762
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:22,095
You should call her.

763
01:11:21,874 --> 01:11:23,569
She waited for you, Eddie.

764
01:11:29,749 --> 01:11:31,582
Your brother Joe called.

765
01:11:31,617 --> 01:11:34,018
He starts that
sales job tomorrow...

766
01:11:34,053 --> 01:11:36,389
Your father says there might be
some work at Ruby Pier.

767
01:11:36,424 --> 01:11:37,857
Help you get some money
for engineering classes.

768
01:11:37,892 --> 01:11:39,825
Not Ruby Pier.

769
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:41,759
What's that?

770
01:11:41,794 --> 01:11:44,922
I ain't working at Ruby Pier.

771
01:11:46,799 --> 01:11:48,790
All those people I know...

772
01:11:52,773 --> 01:11:55,108
I don't feel like it, Ma. OK?

773
01:11:55,143 --> 01:11:56,871
Yeah ok.

774
01:12:05,952 --> 01:12:07,613
Shut the door, will ya?

775
01:12:14,968 --> 01:12:18,338
<i>Digby rocks back and fires,
here's a strike called...</i>

776
01:12:18,373 --> 01:12:20,465
<i>and the count
is strike one on him...</i>

777
01:12:21,608 --> 01:12:22,808
He just needs a little time.

778
01:12:22,843 --> 01:12:25,779
He needs to get off his high
horse, that's what he needs.

779
01:12:25,814 --> 01:12:27,915
Working at the pier ain't good
enough for him?

780
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:31,183
Stop it! After what
he's been through.

781
01:12:31,218 --> 01:12:32,619
How the hell you know
what he's been through?

782
01:12:32,654 --> 01:12:34,988
- He don't even talk.
- Look at him.

783
01:12:35,023 --> 01:12:36,288
Do you ever look at him?

784
01:12:36,323 --> 01:12:38,738
Something awful
happened over there!

785
01:12:38,773 --> 01:12:41,153
Well, something awful
happens every day.

786
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,894
I go now.

787
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:10,924
Get up, and get a job!

788
01:13:10,959 --> 01:13:12,755
Go to bed, Pop.

789
01:13:16,864 --> 01:13:19,266
Get up, and get a job!

790
01:13:19,301 --> 01:13:21,936
You're drunk, Pop.

791
01:13:21,971 --> 01:13:24,536
Get up, and get a job!

792
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:26,698
That it, you think
you're better than me?

793
01:13:31,879 --> 01:13:35,482
Get up, get a job,
get up, get a job...

794
01:13:35,517 --> 01:13:36,972
Enough!

795
01:13:38,685 --> 01:13:40,285
See? You ain't so hurt.

796
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,489
You ain't so hurt,
and you ain't so tough...

797
01:13:42,524 --> 01:13:45,117
not so I can't whip you
like I used to.

798
01:13:46,627 --> 01:13:48,890
No more...

799
01:14:35,022 --> 01:14:39,356
<i>Eddie's third heaven was
a place he'd never seen before.</i>

800
01:14:46,967 --> 01:14:50,569
<i>His body was decaying...</i>

801
01:14:50,604 --> 01:14:53,664
<i>and his soul
was growing restless.</i>

802
01:15:43,614 --> 01:15:45,241
Is it fixed?

803
01:15:50,919 --> 01:15:52,217
I'm here, Pop! I'm here!
Look at me!

804
01:15:52,556 --> 01:15:55,457
I'm here! Look at me!

805
01:15:58,492 --> 01:16:00,983
- Look at me!
- He can't hear you.

806
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:04,156
Don't be angry.

807
01:16:08,535 --> 01:16:10,202
My father's in there!

808
01:16:10,237 --> 01:16:12,938
Well, he's not really here.

809
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:16,844
It's only his spirit,
safe from harm.

810
01:16:16,879 --> 01:16:18,711
That's part of my heaven.

811
01:16:18,746 --> 01:16:21,615
Why does my father
have to be safe for you?

812
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:23,717
Would you like me to explain?

813
01:16:23,752 --> 01:16:26,018
No.

814
01:16:26,053 --> 01:16:28,756
- Where are you going?
- I wanna go home...

815
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:31,358
- Come with me.
- No.

816
01:16:31,393 --> 01:16:32,791
Edward...

817
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,091
Can I see earth again?

818
01:16:39,133 --> 01:16:42,034
I'm afraid not.

819
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:46,306
Then can I go back, to my life?
Can I promise to be better?

820
01:16:46,341 --> 01:16:48,308
Why do you want to go back?

821
01:16:48,343 --> 01:16:50,776
Why? Why?

822
01:16:50,811 --> 01:16:52,277
Because you... this...

823
01:16:52,312 --> 01:16:54,948
none of it makes no sense
to me, that's why.

824
01:16:54,983 --> 01:16:56,148
Heaven. Where are the people...

825
01:16:56,183 --> 01:16:57,316
you're supposed
to see in heaven...

826
01:16:57,351 --> 01:16:58,819
My brother... my brother
died before me...

827
01:16:58,854 --> 01:17:00,304
my mother...

828
01:17:00,339 --> 01:17:01,720
I had friends...

829
01:17:01,755 --> 01:17:04,155
I can't even remember
my own end.

830
01:17:05,392 --> 01:17:08,156
There was this little girl.
The cart was falling...

831
01:17:10,364 --> 01:17:12,355
I felt her little hands...

832
01:17:14,068 --> 01:17:17,128
- And that was when I...
- Passed away?

833
01:17:18,205 --> 01:17:21,375
Went to the other side?

834
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:23,343
Met your maker?

835
01:17:24,545 --> 01:17:26,069
Died.

836
01:17:27,781 --> 01:17:31,717
What do you remember? About
that moment when you died?

837
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:39,618
Floating.

838
01:17:41,428 --> 01:17:44,158
And colors. Colors like
I'd never seen.

839
01:17:45,267 --> 01:17:47,603
No offence lady,
but I don't know you.

840
01:17:47,638 --> 01:17:49,594
But I know you...

841
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:55,440
if you have a spare moment
for me, now...

842
01:18:20,013 --> 01:18:22,481
The Seaside...
I remember this old place.

843
01:18:24,751 --> 01:18:27,083
They tore it down years ago...

844
01:18:28,592 --> 01:18:30,658
There I am...

845
01:18:30,693 --> 01:18:32,725
I was pretty.

846
01:18:32,532 --> 01:18:35,934
- You worked here?
- Yes, why?

847
01:18:35,969 --> 01:18:38,571
You don't seem...
the waitress type.

848
01:18:38,606 --> 01:18:42,325
Well, I wasn't always
well-to-do.

849
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,320
My family was poor.

850
01:18:43,355 --> 01:18:44,987
I left school early
to work.

851
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:46,555
Until Emil.

852
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:48,726
He came to the diner
every morning.

853
01:18:49,761 --> 01:18:51,893
And he ate such big breakfasts.

854
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:56,063
'Oh, what a big appetite
he has! ' I thought.

855
01:18:56,098 --> 01:19:00,199
But Emil's appetite was
for more than just food.

856
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:07,143
Well, I was pretty
in those days.

857
01:19:07,178 --> 01:19:09,143
And Emil...

858
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:13,516
he was so charming
and adventurous.

859
01:19:13,551 --> 01:19:14,983
And rich.

860
01:19:16,019 --> 01:19:18,180
Oh, my what a big
fortune he had.

861
01:19:20,391 --> 01:19:20,882
You've seen these pictures?

862
01:19:26,132 --> 01:19:29,101
They were in the old files
in the workshop.

863
01:19:30,136 --> 01:19:31,769
Most of it was before my time.

864
01:19:31,804 --> 01:19:35,574
Things that come before
your time can still affect you.

865
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:38,634
Even if they are
in the 'old files'...

866
01:19:40,613 --> 01:19:43,480
He loved those
seaside fun parks.

867
01:19:44,817 --> 01:19:47,486
He asked me to
marry him in one.

868
01:19:47,521 --> 01:19:49,053
When I said yes...

869
01:19:49,088 --> 01:19:52,489
he promised he would capture
that moment forever.

870
01:19:54,293 --> 01:19:57,023
So he built his monument...

871
01:19:58,064 --> 01:20:01,934
a place where children could
always be children...

872
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:04,494
and adults never
had to grow up.

873
01:20:05,538 --> 01:20:08,205
He brought in animals,
and clowns...

874
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:13,913
a carousel from France, and a
Ferris Wheel from Germany...

875
01:20:13,948 --> 01:20:17,849
and his piece-de-resistance...

876
01:20:19,685 --> 01:20:21,868
the entrance.

877
01:20:21,903 --> 01:20:24,052
Oh, it was grand!

878
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:27,283
'Sweetheart' he said...

879
01:20:27,929 --> 01:20:30,298
'everyone who comes
through these gates...

880
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:31,665
will have to pass
under your gaze.'

881
01:20:32,539 --> 01:20:32,966
I don't understand.

882
01:20:35,809 --> 01:20:37,042
The name!

883
01:20:37,077 --> 01:20:39,478
Weren't you ever curious
about the name?

884
01:20:39,513 --> 01:20:41,715
The place where you worked?
Where your father worked?

885
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:45,116
All those years?
Ruby Pier?

886
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:55,025
Up here.

887
01:20:56,797 --> 01:20:58,424
I am Ruby.

888
01:21:01,743 --> 01:21:02,540
Man, this feels weird...

889
01:21:04,717 --> 01:21:06,446
Maybe this is something...

890
01:21:14,093 --> 01:21:15,651
Lemon Fizz...

891
01:21:23,536 --> 01:21:24,096
Damn! A Bronze Star!

892
01:21:27,944 --> 01:21:29,878
This ain't right.

893
01:21:29,913 --> 01:21:32,615
Forget these insurance people.

894
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:34,276
Bad enough what happened.

895
01:21:35,351 --> 01:21:37,216
Yeah let him rest in peace.

896
01:21:39,089 --> 01:21:41,623
Lay off the kid, already!
That's enough!

897
01:21:41,658 --> 01:21:45,428
Don't you tell me what's enough.
He's gotta learn a lesson.

898
01:21:47,832 --> 01:21:49,064
- Stop it!
- Quiet!

899
01:21:49,099 --> 01:21:52,535
No, Dad, I promise, I won't
do it again, please, stop...

900
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:55,333
- Oh my lord.
- What's that smoke?

901
01:22:02,345 --> 01:22:04,581
No, don't do this...
don't do this!

902
01:22:04,616 --> 01:22:06,071
What is it?

903
01:22:26,715 --> 01:22:30,602
I remember this fire.
Burned down half the park.

904
01:22:30,637 --> 01:22:34,489
In those days, everything
was made of lathe and tar.

905
01:22:34,524 --> 01:22:36,855
Our pier was like
a matchbook...

906
01:22:39,861 --> 01:22:42,261
I begged Emil not to go.

907
01:22:43,298 --> 01:22:44,629
But of course he went.

908
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:48,870
He wanted to save
his gift to me.

909
01:22:48,905 --> 01:22:51,204
They say he was...

910
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:53,875
trying to save
the grand entrance...

911
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:55,775
with my painting on it...

912
01:22:55,949 --> 01:22:57,576
when it collapsed.

913
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:04,892
There was no insurance.

914
01:23:07,095 --> 01:23:11,225
That was my Emil.
The risk taker.

915
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:15,101
That one night,
we lost everything.

916
01:23:16,204 --> 01:23:18,506
But they rebuilt the park.

917
01:23:18,541 --> 01:23:21,908
Someone else, not us.

918
01:23:21,943 --> 01:23:24,746
Emil was in the hospital
for months.

919
01:23:24,781 --> 01:23:26,714
It took most of our savings.

920
01:23:28,683 --> 01:23:32,312
Even so, he didn't want to
sell it. Can you imagine that?

921
01:23:34,422 --> 01:23:36,590
But I sold it.

922
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:41,289
To a rich railroad man.
He kept the name.

923
01:23:43,164 --> 01:23:45,396
I didn't care.

924
01:23:45,431 --> 01:23:47,629
We moved away...

925
01:23:48,837 --> 01:23:51,806
and I tended to my
beloved husband...

926
01:23:57,447 --> 01:24:01,577
and I nurtured
one impossible wish.

927
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,287
What wish was that?

928
01:24:05,322 --> 01:24:07,654
That he'd never
built that place.

929
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,924
I had that thought
a few times myself.

930
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:17,294
I had dreams when I was a kid.

931
01:24:18,436 --> 01:24:21,804
Thought I'd be an engineer.

932
01:24:21,839 --> 01:24:23,272
But my father used to tell me...

933
01:24:23,307 --> 01:24:26,477
'the world is divided into
somebodys and nobodys, Eddie...

934
01:24:26,512 --> 01:24:28,536
and there's
a lot more nobodys'.

935
01:24:28,749 --> 01:24:31,717
He made sure
I was one of them.

936
01:24:31,752 --> 01:24:34,789
Eddie, your father
is not the reason...

937
01:24:34,824 --> 01:24:37,121
that you never left Ruby Pier.

938
01:24:38,526 --> 01:24:40,359
Oh no? What is?

939
01:24:40,394 --> 01:24:43,113
You still have two more
people to meet, dear.

940
01:24:43,148 --> 01:24:46,509
No, lady. I can meet

941
01:24:46,544 --> 01:24:49,835
that ain't gonna change.
That pier...

942
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:54,008
that dumb job, was the last
trick he pulled on me.

943
01:24:54,043 --> 01:24:55,600
How?

944
01:24:58,212 --> 01:24:59,907
By dying.

945
01:25:00,981 --> 01:25:02,448
Eddie?

946
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:06,780
Eddie!

947
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:11,019
It's your father!

948
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:15,192
He collapsed. They took him
to the hospital.

949
01:25:16,697 --> 01:25:18,995
Oh, god. It's my fault!

950
01:25:20,401 --> 01:25:22,130
It's my fault!

951
01:25:22,805 --> 01:25:25,658
Her fault? He came
home one night...

952
01:25:25,693 --> 01:25:28,476
four in the morning,
soaking wet...

953
01:25:28,511 --> 01:25:30,746
probably drunk as a skunk.
And he gets pneumonia.

954
01:25:30,781 --> 01:25:31,779
And it was her fault?

955
01:25:31,814 --> 01:25:33,415
But that's how he was,
my old man.

956
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:35,218
You were always the one
doing something wrong.

957
01:25:35,253 --> 01:25:35,886
Never him.

958
01:25:37,921 --> 01:25:40,446
I took over his shifts while
he was in the hospital.

959
01:25:42,201 --> 01:25:44,068
I worked nights, weekends,
so he wouldn't lose his job.

960
01:25:44,106 --> 01:25:46,336
And then he died on me.

961
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:51,311
My mother never did accept it.

962
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:53,682
She kept talking to him
like he was still alive.

963
01:25:53,717 --> 01:25:55,149
One night, I went
over to see her...

964
01:25:55,184 --> 01:25:57,853
I said, 'Ma, you want I should
put these dishes away? '

965
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:03,855
Ma...

966
01:26:05,562 --> 01:26:06,291
Dad's gone.

967
01:26:06,765 --> 01:26:07,392
Gone where?

968
01:26:11,335 --> 01:26:13,021
I moved back in here
the next week.

969
01:26:14,056 --> 01:26:14,672
And I took that job
to be around...

970
01:26:15,707 --> 01:26:19,040
to take care of my mother.
I became my old man...

971
01:26:20,312 --> 01:21:20,143
And I never left.

972
01:26:23,682 --> 01:26:23,615
What's happening?

973
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:27,620
You don't really know
how your father died.

974
01:26:28,655 --> 01:26:28,611
What are you talking about?

975
01:26:35,694 --> 01:26:35,561
What's he doing here?

976
01:26:37,596 --> 01:26:38,360
He's been fired. Drinking.

977
01:26:41,399 --> 01:26:42,562
He came looking for your father.
But your father wasn't here.

978
01:26:43,708 --> 01:26:45,243
Your mother is going

979
01:26:56,996 --> 01:26:58,765
No... don't you move,
you bastard!

980
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:03,032
- This happened long ago.
- No!

981
01:27:04,067 --> 01:27:05,627
What are you doing? No!
You don't want to do this!

982
01:27:06,671 --> 01:27:08,502
What the hell is going on?

983
01:27:09,841 --> 01:27:10,174
Come here!

984
01:27:12,209 --> 01:27:14,209
- I'm all right...
- What did he do?

985
01:27:14,683 --> 01:27:18,379
I'm alright.
Don't do it! Don't!

986
01:28:07,205 --> 01:28:07,539
Why didn't he let him drown?

987
01:28:09,374 --> 01:28:10,609
- Why didn't he kill him?
- He wanted to.

988
01:28:10,644 --> 01:28:13,511
But years ago, they fought
in the war together.

989
01:28:13,649 --> 01:28:15,584
Mickey helped him
get his first job.

990
01:28:17,254 --> 01:28:21,122
Your father held loyalty
in very high regard.

991
01:28:22,459 --> 01:28:26,623
In the end, it mattered
more than his rage.

992
01:28:30,267 --> 01:28:32,428
So he saved a life...

993
01:28:32,437 --> 01:28:35,530
instead of taking one.

994
01:28:44,358 --> 01:28:43,552
Pneumonia...

995
01:28:47,863 --> 01:28:49,161
He fought the ocean
for a long time.

996
01:28:52,935 --> 01:28:55,938
Sometimes, he would cry out.
For your mother.

997
01:28:55,973 --> 01:28:59,533
For your brother.
Or for you.

998
01:29:01,111 --> 01:29:01,873
For me?

999
01:29:03,682 --> 01:29:06,172
How do you know that?

1000
01:29:06,518 --> 01:29:07,009
There were two
patients to a room.

1001
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:35,890
<i>Your father died in the middle
of the night.</i>

1002
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:40,946
<i>Again, I cursed Ruby Pier.</i>

1003
01:29:42,981 --> 01:29:45,509
I wished I could undo any harm
it had ever caused.

1004
01:29:50,689 --> 01:29:52,557
That wish formed my heaven.

1005
01:29:52,961 --> 01:29:55,731
I don't understand.
This old diner?

1006
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:59,502
This old diner
is more than a place.

1007
01:30:00,537 --> 01:30:01,502
It's a time.

1008
01:30:02,637 --> 01:30:03,730
When things were simpler.

1009
01:30:04,907 --> 01:30:06,043
But those people inside?

1010
01:30:08,078 --> 01:30:08,546
They were all hurt.

1011
01:30:10,581 --> 01:30:09,912
Well...

1012
01:30:11,947 --> 01:30:13,216
Accidents. Fights.

1013
01:30:14,251 --> 01:30:18,420
Fires.
I would have none of it.

1014
01:30:20,455 --> 01:30:21,555
My heaven would
be a place where...

1015
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:24,941
anyone who ever suffered
from Ruby Pier...

1016
01:30:24,976 --> 01:30:27,292
even for a moment
would be safe forever.

1017
01:30:28,865 --> 01:30:28,730
Your father, too.

1018
01:30:29,768 --> 01:30:33,172
- I hated him, you know.
- I know.

1019
01:30:34,207 --> 01:30:35,038
He was hell on me as a kid.

1020
01:30:36,073 --> 01:30:37,439
And even worse
when I got older.

1021
01:30:40,945 --> 01:30:42,708
Once he couldn't
hit me no more...

1022
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:46,852
he stopped talking
to me altogether.

1023
01:30:47,887 --> 01:30:48,251
Eddie.

1024
01:30:49,395 --> 01:30:51,732
We think by hating someone
we hurt them...

1025
01:30:52,767 --> 01:30:54,886
but hatred is a curved blade.

1026
01:30:54,921 --> 01:30:58,005
And the harm
we do to others...

1027
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,667
we also do to ourselves.

1028
01:31:02,779 --> 01:31:05,304
Why is everything so different
than I thought?

1029
01:31:06,516 --> 01:31:11,786
Well, when you first
got here...

1030
01:31:11,821 --> 01:31:12,720
do you remember
how you felt?

1031
01:31:18,627 --> 01:31:19,541
No worry.

1032
01:31:19,776 --> 01:31:20,856
No hate.

1033
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,869
That's because no one
is born with anger.

1034
01:31:26,904 --> 01:31:29,674
We build it over the years,
with the things we don't say...

1035
01:31:30,709 --> 01:31:31,676
with the things we bury.

1036
01:31:32,711 --> 01:31:35,414
When we die,
the soul is freed of it...

1037
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:37,575
Free to see the truth.

1038
01:31:40,953 --> 01:31:44,080
So, what do I gotta do?

1039
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,885
You need to forgive
your father.

1040
01:32:03,075 --> 01:32:03,599
Dad?

1041
01:32:09,146 --> 01:32:11,670
I'm here now...

1042
01:32:11,951 --> 01:32:13,680
I saw what happened.

1043
01:32:14,753 --> 01:32:17,254
I didn't understand you.

1044
01:32:17,289 --> 01:32:20,781
I still don't. You beat me.
You humiliated me.

1045
01:32:25,328 --> 01:32:26,023
I was your son!

1046
01:32:27,299 --> 01:32:28,994
Look at me, Pop...

1047
01:32:33,104 --> 01:32:33,731
I'm older than you...

1048
01:32:37,709 --> 01:32:39,735
I didn't know your life.
I didn't know you.

1049
01:32:42,881 --> 01:32:47,749
But I understand now.
I'm letting it go. All right?

1050
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:52,388
Do we let it go?

1051
01:32:53,892 --> 01:32:55,259
I forgive you, OK?
You hear me?

1052
01:33:08,707 --> 01:33:09,073
I forgive you dad...

1053
01:33:15,147 --> 01:33:16,978
I forgive you.

1054
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:30,603
It's fixed.

1055
01:33:45,284 --> 01:33:46,343
It's fixed.

1056
01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:07,272
How old was the deceased?

1057
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,413
I dunno.
It was his birthday.

1058
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:20,885
What can you tell me about...

1059
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:26,326
You mean about Eddie?
About what was he like?

1060
01:34:29,033 --> 01:34:29,864
He was great.

1061
01:34:32,538 --> 01:34:33,870
You know, he'd do little things
for you sometimes...

1062
01:34:35,108 --> 01:34:36,703
help you out.

1063
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,610
Don't get me wrong, he was
a tough old goat.

1064
01:34:40,683 --> 01:34:41,917
Everything had to be safe.

1065
01:34:42,952 --> 01:34:46,356
'Make it safe, Dom.'
'Grease them tracks, Dom.

1066
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:48,654
Tighten them bolts, Dom.'

1067
01:34:49,793 --> 01:34:50,988
How about... personally?

1068
01:34:54,798 --> 01:34:55,732
Personally?

1069
01:35:04,174 --> 01:35:05,940
I know Eddie loved
his wife very much.

1070
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,560
Of course,
I never met her.

1071
01:35:21,738 --> 01:35:22,973
To the beautiful bride,
Marguerite...

1072
01:35:24,008 --> 01:35:26,494
and to the lucky groom,
Eddie, my kid brother...

1073
01:35:27,529 --> 01:35:28,980
who figured out you can get
a restaurant cheap...

1074
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:29,845
on Christmas eve!

1075
01:35:34,185 --> 01:35:36,354
To the bride and groom
everyone!

1076
01:35:37,389 --> 01:35:38,050
To the bride and groom!

1077
01:35:39,892 --> 01:35:42,094
I'm sorry we couldn't
afford more...

1078
01:35:43,129 --> 01:35:45,221
It's all I ever wanted.

1079
01:35:57,295 --> 01:35:58,764
Come on, Eddie.
We love this song.

1080
01:35:59,799 --> 01:36:02,233
- Ah, please...
- No, I can't...

1081
01:36:05,036 --> 01:36:06,936
You know
I can't move around.

1082
01:36:14,145 --> 01:36:13,942
Alright... alright.

1083
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:36,836
- They're staring at me.
- I don't care.

1084
01:36:37,773 --> 01:36:40,174
You're alive, and you're here.

1085
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:43,144
And I love you.

1086
01:36:49,351 --> 01:36:51,387
<i>I don't worry</i>

1087
01:36:53,422 --> 01:36:55,809
<i>Whenever skies
Are gray above</i>

1088
01:36:57,844 --> 01:36:59,721
<i>Gotta pocketful of rainbows</i>

1089
01:37:01,756 --> 01:37:03,598
<i>Gotta a heart full of love</i>

1090
01:37:10,906 --> 01:37:12,842
<i>Mister heartache</i>

1091
01:37:13,358 --> 01:37:14,553
Happy birthday honey!

1092
01:37:14,877 --> 01:37:17,325
<i>I found a way
To make you believe</i>

1093
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,774
<i>Gotta a pocketful of rainbows</i>

1094
01:37:32,828 --> 01:37:34,448
<i>Kiss me extra tender</i>

1095
01:37:35,022 --> 01:37:35,716
Honey...

1096
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:38,034
<i>Hold me extra tight</i>

1097
01:37:38,055 --> 01:37:40,055
It's not easy finding a watch
with a Ferris Wheel, you know.

1098
01:37:40,069 --> 01:37:41,872
<i>'Cause I'm saving
Your sweetness</i>

1099
01:37:43,907 --> 01:37:46,477
<i>For a lonely night</i>

1100
01:37:46,553 --> 01:37:49,063
So, you like it?

1101
01:37:49,512 --> 01:37:51,013
<i>No more teardrops</i>

1102
01:37:51,336 --> 01:37:52,928
Of course I like it.

1103
01:37:53,048 --> 01:37:56,987
<i>Now that I found a love so true</i>

1104
01:38:41,605 --> 01:38:45,055
I could never wear something like that.

1105
01:38:46,255 --> 01:38:47,735
If you did, the fellas wouldn't
look at anyone else.

1106
01:39:08,230 --> 01:39:11,958
Eddie?

1107
01:40:11,298 --> 01:40:12,323
Want some water?

1108
01:41:33,589 --> 01:41:35,420
You're my fourth person?

1109
01:42:22,571 --> 01:42:24,266
It can't be...

1110
01:42:29,345 --> 01:42:32,745
Can it be... Marguerite?

1111
01:42:35,951 --> 01:42:38,283
For the bitter and the sweet?

1112
01:42:49,368 --> 01:42:51,337
Your hair. It's white.

1113
01:42:56,075 --> 01:42:59,712
I can't stop staring.
I'm sorry.

1114
01:42:59,747 --> 01:43:00,555
Eddie.

1115
01:43:01,215 --> 01:43:03,979
Have you forgotten so quickly
what I look like?

1116
01:43:04,285 --> 01:43:06,616
I never forgot that.

1117
01:43:11,392 --> 01:43:13,561
All weddings.
That was my choice.

1118
01:43:15,596 --> 01:43:17,365
I can go from one to another,
all over the world.

1119
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:23,137
When the groom lifts the veil,
when the bride takes the ring...

1120
01:43:23,172 --> 01:43:24,104
it never changes.

1121
01:43:25,139 --> 01:43:28,007
They always believe their love
will break all the records.

1122
01:43:32,146 --> 01:43:34,515
Did we have that
at our wedding?

1123
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:36,483
We had an accordion player.

1124
01:43:44,792 --> 01:43:44,291
Your leg...

1125
01:43:46,326 --> 01:43:49,193
It's getting worse, it was
good when I got here.

1126
01:43:50,664 --> 01:43:52,368
So... you... went through
this whole thing, too?

1127
01:43:54,403 --> 01:43:56,171
- You met five people?
- Yes.

1128
01:43:56,206 --> 01:43:56,971
And it made a difference?

1129
01:43:59,006 --> 01:43:59,736
It made all the difference.

1130
01:44:02,342 --> 01:44:04,401
And then I came here
to wait for you.

1131
01:44:07,314 --> 01:44:08,077
My sweetheart.

1132
01:44:10,718 --> 01:44:12,620
How much do you know
since you died?

1133
01:44:14,655 --> 01:44:16,290
Well, I remember everything
that happened...

1134
01:44:16,325 --> 01:44:16,890
when we were together.

1135
01:44:16,925 --> 01:44:18,756
And now I know why it happened.

1136
01:44:21,762 --> 01:44:23,196
And I know that you
loved me dearly.

1137
01:44:27,502 --> 01:44:29,561
But I don't know
how you died.

1138
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:36,244
There was this little girl.
One of the rides a new one...

1139
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:38,777
not like the ones
we used to have...

1140
01:44:38,812 --> 01:44:40,380
everything goes a million
miles an hour now...

1141
01:44:41,415 --> 01:44:44,119
but this ride, I never trusted
it, it drops a cart, see...

1142
01:44:45,154 --> 01:44:47,071
and somehow the cable,
it snapped...

1143
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:49,724
and this little girl,
she was underneath it...

1144
01:44:47,106 --> 01:44:46,954
I don't know how,
it just snapped...

1145
01:44:49,759 --> 01:44:52,092
and I went to push her
out of the way...

1146
01:44:52,127 --> 01:44:54,195
I grabbed her hands, and then...

1147
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:56,495
that's all I remember...

1148
01:44:56,530 --> 01:45:01,168
I felt her little hands and
then everything went black.

1149
01:45:01,203 --> 01:45:02,972
I tried, I tried, but I don't
know...

1150
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:05,497
if I failed...

1151
01:45:08,876 --> 01:45:11,345
I ain't talked this much
since I been here.

1152
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:13,142
Oh, God, Marguerite...

1153
01:45:14,581 --> 01:45:15,116
I can't say...

1154
01:45:17,151 --> 01:45:17,652
I can't say...

1155
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:45,967
I'm a soldier.

1156
01:45:48,471 --> 01:45:51,837
I'm a soldier.

1157
01:46:26,086 --> 01:46:26,587
Are you OK, Eddie?

1158
01:46:28,622 --> 01:46:31,425
Yeah...
it's nothing, honey...

1159
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:33,416
That dream again?

1160
01:46:36,496 --> 01:46:38,130
You want me
to fix you something?

1161
01:46:38,165 --> 01:46:42,069
- It's four in the morning.
- It's all right I don't mind...

1162
01:46:42,104 --> 01:46:43,162
Get some sleep, honey...

1163
01:46:57,535 --> 01:47:00,904
- You never told me.
- I couldn't tell you.

1164
01:47:00,939 --> 01:47:03,102
We had to survive. We did
what we had to do, I guess.

1165
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:05,612
But I was never the same.
It was like...

1166
01:47:06,647 --> 01:47:11,249
all the things I had wanted,
I couldn't see 'em anymore.

1167
01:47:11,284 --> 01:47:14,852
I felt stuck... I should have
made us a better life.

1168
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:15,820
I should of gotten us
out of there, the pier...

1169
01:47:15,855 --> 01:47:16,811
I loved the pier.

1170
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:20,259
I lost myself...

1171
01:47:21,294 --> 01:47:22,395
I'm sorry.

1172
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:24,295
No.

1173
01:47:28,134 --> 01:47:28,897
Marguerite?

1174
01:47:31,437 --> 01:47:33,307
Do you think God
knows I'm here?

1175
01:47:35,342 --> 01:47:35,831
Of course.

1176
01:47:37,109 --> 01:47:39,176
Why do you ask?

1177
01:47:39,211 --> 01:47:42,544
I dunno. I guess part of my life
I was hiding from him...

1178
01:47:45,150 --> 01:47:45,484
And the rest?

1179
01:47:46,519 --> 01:47:49,488
The rest I just figured
he didn't know I existed.

1180
01:47:56,867 --> 01:47:58,994
The wine, wine's good, huh?

1181
01:48:11,916 --> 01:48:12,719
Were you sorry about anything?

1182
01:48:14,754 --> 01:48:15,914
With us, I mean?

1183
01:48:23,962 --> 01:48:25,658
I was sorry we couldn't
have children.

1184
01:48:38,045 --> 01:48:40,036
We had lots of 'em
around, though.

1185
01:48:40,082 --> 01:48:40,879
And you?

1186
01:48:42,219 --> 01:48:44,847
Were you sorry about
anything with us?

1187
01:48:45,033 --> 01:48:51,866
Yeah. I was sorry
it didn't last longer.

1188
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:10,358
- I'll make some tea.
- I'll get it.

1189
01:51:29,708 --> 01:51:34,303
You had to live without love
for many years didn't you?

1190
01:51:34,513 --> 01:51:37,845
You felt that it was
snatched away.

1191
01:51:37,916 --> 01:51:40,402
That I left you too soon.

1192
01:51:40,437 --> 01:51:41,853
You did leave too soon.

1193
01:51:43,888 --> 01:51:45,424
There was a reason to it all.

1194
01:51:47,459 --> 01:51:48,291
What reason?
You died.

1195
01:51:48,326 --> 01:51:50,527
You died and
you lost everything...

1196
01:51:50,562 --> 01:51:51,560
And I lost everything...

1197
01:51:51,595 --> 01:51:53,729
I lost the only woman
I ever loved.

1198
01:51:53,764 --> 01:51:54,788
No you didn't.

1199
01:51:54,832 --> 01:51:56,527
I was right here.

1200
01:51:58,336 --> 01:52:00,634
And you loved me anyhow.

1201
01:52:01,573 --> 01:52:05,098
Lost love is still love, Eddie.

1202
01:52:05,144 --> 01:52:08,544
It takes a different form,
that's all.

1203
01:52:10,281 --> 01:52:13,408
You can't hold their hands...

1204
01:52:14,118 --> 01:52:16,642
you can't tousle their hair.

1205
01:52:18,589 --> 01:52:22,116
But when those senses weaken,
another one comes to life.

1206
01:52:23,261 --> 01:52:23,762
Memory.

1207
01:52:24,797 --> 01:52:30,135
Memory becomes your partner.
You hold it.

1208
01:52:31,170 --> 01:52:32,262
You dance with it.

1209
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:37,931
Life has to end, Eddie.

1210
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:42,011
Love doesn't.

1211
01:52:43,046 --> 01:52:44,047
- I never wanted anyone else.
- I know.

1212
01:52:44,082 --> 01:52:46,778
- I'm still in love with you.
- I know. I felt it.

1213
01:52:47,219 --> 01:52:49,084
You felt it? Here?

1214
01:52:50,255 --> 01:52:52,155
Even here.

1215
01:53:00,365 --> 01:53:01,663
I want to show you something.

1216
01:53:16,223 --> 01:53:18,282
I was saving this one.

1217
01:53:33,883 --> 01:53:36,010
Dance with me, Eddie.

1218
01:54:08,351 --> 01:54:10,080
May I ask you something?

1219
01:54:11,988 --> 01:54:14,391
How come you look
the way you looked...

1220
01:54:14,426 --> 01:54:17,256
the day I married you?

1221
01:54:22,865 --> 01:54:24,135
Can you change it?

1222
01:54:25,170 --> 01:54:28,405
Change it? To what?

1223
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:29,236
To the end.

1224
01:54:32,042 --> 01:54:34,979
But I wasn't so pretty
at the end.

1225
01:55:17,627 --> 01:54:21,528
Because I thought you
would like it this way.

1226
01:55:39,709 --> 01:55:44,338
I don't want go on.
I want to stay here.

1227
01:55:55,158 --> 01:55:55,691
No...

1228
01:55:55,726 --> 01:55:56,694
Not again...

1229
01:57:33,456 --> 01:57:34,253
Tala.

1230
01:57:42,634 --> 01:57:44,329
Tala.

1231
01:57:54,045 --> 01:57:55,706
Baro.

1232
01:57:59,683 --> 01:58:01,014
Baro.

1233
01:58:07,458 --> 01:58:08,155
Saya.

1234
01:58:09,190 --> 01:58:10,853
Saya.

1235
01:58:15,366 --> 01:58:17,399
Loser.

1236
01:58:18,434 --> 01:58:19,432
Loser.

1237
01:58:26,144 --> 01:58:27,805
Washing.

1238
01:58:30,315 --> 01:58:33,613
Washing.
Like our Inas do.

1239
01:58:35,285 --> 01:58:35,946
Inas?

1240
01:58:38,288 --> 01:58:39,222
Mommies.

1241
01:58:40,257 --> 01:58:41,350
Where are your Mommies?

1242
01:58:49,134 --> 01:58:52,602
These?
These are pipe cleaners.

1243
01:58:52,637 --> 01:58:55,774
I keep 'em for
the kids at the Pier.

1244
01:58:55,809 --> 01:58:57,435
Here...

1245
01:59:11,089 --> 01:59:12,681
Look, see...

1246
01:59:19,866 --> 01:59:22,493
There.

1247
01:59:29,643 --> 01:59:31,304
You like that, huh?

1248
01:59:34,413 --> 01:59:36,210
You burn me.

1249
01:59:38,984 --> 01:59:40,051
What did you say?

1250
01:59:43,086 --> 01:59:44,920
You make me fire.

1251
01:59:46,592 --> 01:59:48,617
I don't understand...

1252
01:59:50,430 --> 01:59:54,835
My Ina say hide.
Hide in nipa.

1253
01:59:54,870 --> 01:59:57,370
My Ina say she come back.

1254
01:59:59,405 --> 02:00:01,841
What were you hiding from,
little girl?

1255
02:00:00,876 --> 02:00:00,672
Sundalong.

1256
02:00:04,978 --> 02:00:07,536
Soldier.

1257
02:00:08,315 --> 02:00:08,805
Come out!

1258
02:00:10,784 --> 02:00:12,775
I'm a soldier!

1259
02:00:15,355 --> 02:00:16,118
Tala...

1260
02:00:18,893 --> 02:00:19,758
Why are you in Heaven?

1261
02:00:22,796 --> 02:00:26,199
You burn me
you make me fire.

1262
02:00:32,106 --> 02:00:35,075
You were the shadow...
the shadow in the hut...

1263
02:00:39,582 --> 02:00:43,210
Ina say she come back.

1264
02:00:44,319 --> 02:00:47,015
Ina say Tala be safe.

1265
02:00:53,426 --> 02:00:57,055
You burn me.
Not safe.

1266
02:01:13,345 --> 02:01:14,748
Oh, God, oh no...

1267
02:01:15,886 --> 02:01:18,650
I killed you...
I killed you...

1268
02:01:20,624 --> 02:01:24,593
Forgive me dear Lord,
forgive me...

1269
02:01:29,667 --> 02:01:31,532
those dreams.

1270
02:01:34,838 --> 02:01:37,139
Forgive me!
I didn't know...

1271
02:01:37,174 --> 02:01:40,211
I didn't know...
I didn't know...

1272
02:01:40,246 --> 02:01:41,270
why didn't I know...

1273
02:01:49,955 --> 02:01:52,891
No... No...

1274
02:02:17,450 --> 02:02:19,543
You wash me.

1275
02:02:36,110 --> 02:02:36,975
You wash me.

1276
02:02:45,919 --> 02:02:46,887
I don't know how...

1277
02:03:55,174 --> 02:03:55,698
Five.

1278
02:03:59,777 --> 02:04:01,210
Five?

1279
02:04:03,746 --> 02:04:04,907
You're five years old?

1280
02:04:11,889 --> 02:04:13,914
You're my fifth person...

1281
02:04:28,203 --> 02:04:29,000
Why are you sad?

1282
02:04:29,573 --> 02:04:31,165
Why am I sad?

1283
02:04:32,243 --> 02:04:33,234
Where? Here?

1284
02:04:36,113 --> 02:04:37,138
On Earth?

1285
02:04:41,484 --> 02:04:43,518
I was sad because...

1286
02:04:43,553 --> 02:04:45,890
I didn't do anything
with my life.

1287
02:04:45,992 --> 02:04:53,564
I always felt trapped by
the things that were happening...

1288
02:04:46,925 --> 02:04:46,957
Because...

1289
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:56,066
I wasn't where
I was supposed to be.

1290
02:04:57,101 --> 02:04:59,057
Do you understand that?

1291
02:05:00,436 --> 02:05:02,166
It is where
you supposed to be.

1292
02:05:05,508 --> 02:05:08,568
Where? Ruby Pier?
Fixing rides?

1293
02:05:09,513 --> 02:05:10,480
Why?

1294
02:05:13,515 --> 02:05:13,779
Why was I supposed
to be there?

1295
02:05:16,653 --> 02:05:20,974
Children.
You keep them safe.

1296
02:05:22,009 --> 02:05:25,295
You make good for me.
Every day.

1297
02:05:25,330 --> 02:05:25,661
You make good for me.

1298
02:05:29,166 --> 02:05:32,070
Is where you are
supposed to be...

1299
02:05:34,105 --> 02:05:36,334
Eddie Main'nance.

1300
02:05:43,947 --> 02:05:45,614
- Tala?
- Tala.

1301
02:05:46,649 --> 02:05:49,752
There was a little girl.
At the pier. The day I died.

1302
02:05:49,787 --> 02:05:51,276
Do you know who
I'm talking about?

1303
02:05:52,322 --> 02:05:55,291
Did I save her? Just tell me.
Did I pull her out of the way?

1304
02:06:00,029 --> 02:06:06,981
No pull. Push.
You push her away.

1305
02:06:07,016 --> 02:06:09,933
Big thing fall.
You keep her safe.

1306
02:06:09,974 --> 02:06:14,342
No... I felt her hands...

1307
02:06:14,377 --> 02:06:18,403
I couldn't have pushed...
I felt her little hands...

1308
02:06:19,649 --> 02:06:25,452
Not her hands.
My hands.

1309
02:06:28,491 --> 02:06:31,394
I bring you to heaven.

1310
02:06:32,429 --> 02:06:33,089
Keep you safe.

1311
02:07:33,628 --> 02:07:34,961
<i>All the accidents
Eddie had prevented...</i>

1312
02:07:37,466 --> 02:07:39,560
<i>all the lives
he had kept safe.</i>

1313
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:42,707
<i>And all their children...</i>

1314
02:07:44,742 --> 02:07:48,233
<i>and all their
children's children...</i>

1315
02:07:49,379 --> 02:07:52,645
<i>there because of the simple
things that he did...</i>

1316
02:07:53,852 --> 02:07:56,412
<i>day after day.</i>

1317
02:09:14,613 --> 02:09:19,184
<i>This is the story
of a man named Eddie...</i>

1318
02:09:19,219 --> 02:09:22,452
<i>who lived and died...</i>

1319
02:09:22,487 --> 02:09:26,947
<i>and would one day himself
share the secret of heaven:</i>

1320
02:09:30,429 --> 02:09:33,592
<i>That each life
affects the other...</i>

1321
02:09:35,368 --> 02:09:39,030
<i>and the other
affects the next...</i>

1322
02:10:09,811 --> 02:10:12,730
<i>and the world
is full of stories...</i>

1323
02:10:12,765 --> 02:10:15,649
<i>but the stories
are all one.</i>
