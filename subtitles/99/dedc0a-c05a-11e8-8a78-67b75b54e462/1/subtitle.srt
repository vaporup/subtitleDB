1
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,974
Congratulations, Mr. And Mrs. Ma.

2
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,241
Your twins are really lovely.

3
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,177
Look, the nose is exactly like yours.

4
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,383
Yes, everybody has
a big nose in our family.

5
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,721
It's even better
if they're fraternal twins.

6
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,830
If our daughter's nose
is like yours, who wants her.

7
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,896
Isn't it great now with two dragons?

8
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,001
Give me the two dragons.

9
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,536
Sergeant! Sign the register.

10
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,468
Call Headquarters,
to say I've got Crazy Keung.

11
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,407
They look exactly the same,
how do we separate them out?

12
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,679
Come on,

13
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,687
don't say separate, it's unlucky.

14
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,756
The convict escaped!

15
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,363
My son, be good...

16
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,636
Who are you?

17
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:47,933
Why did you come into my room?

18
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,202
Taking away my son?
Give me back my son?...

19
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,011
Dare to fight with me?

20
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,545
Please, I beg you not to!

21
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:57,808
Fire!

22
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,442
My God!

23
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,685
Please return my son.

24
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,721
Get lost!

25
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,559
Go away!

26
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,578
Damn you!

27
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,934
Don't move!
Even this didn't kill you?!

28
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,940
You beast, won't even spare a baby?!

29
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:08,512
Tuberose, I sing for you...

30
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,881
Boss, why don't you go home? It's late.

31
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,217
Want someone to drink with you?

32
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,326
You don't drink, I drink!

33
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,057
Sergeant Keung, the baby is gone,
left only a wheelchair.

34
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:32,672
Can't even protect a baby,
what kind of policemen are you?

35
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,916
The cry is really sad.

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,314
So sad!

37
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,912
Are they going to U.S. and won't return?

38
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,548
Bring the handkerchief!

39
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:49,917
Thanks!

40
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,401
Yuen Ting,
when did you give Yui the child?

41
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,706
Let me hug him.

42
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,644
I didn't give him the child.
I picked him up in the street.

43
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,683
So lovely!

44
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,025
Hey kid, pay your protection fee.

45
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,024
No way.

46
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,686
Don't run, you bastard!

47
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,069
He made a pass at me.

48
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,443
What? Dare to molest my girl? Don't run!

49
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,047
Bok Min, he hit me with no reason.

50
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,138
Fight back!

51
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:58,285
Come...

52
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,958
Drink it, got to go.
It's them!

53
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,088
Hit him!

54
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,162
Don't hurt the innocent.

55
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,615
Happy birthday!

56
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,792
Happy birthday!
Thank you, mom!

57
00:06:58,785 --> 00:06:59,877
Very good!

58
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,152
Good...

59
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,685
How about this?

60
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,779
Share among the brothers.
Hey brothers!

61
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,624
Come on, see these photos.

62
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,395
Brother Wing, your driving skill
is better than Kuen's.

63
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,434
Your name will be foremost in Hong Kong.

64
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,437
If you're not there, how fast they go,

65
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,707
it won't be a race.

66
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,834
Come on, let's cheer for brother Wing.

67
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,743
Cheers!

68
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,111
Bok Min, over here!

69
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,723
What are you dressed up for?

70
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,661
We're going out for fun.

71
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,725
Where's the weapon?

72
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,195
Here.

73
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,228
You haven't told me,
why you are dressed like this?

74
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,737
Settle a score. Wing got my girl.

75
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,671
You've got a girl?
How come I didn't know!

76
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,510
Do I need to tell you?
Should I write you a report?

77
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,476
Such a beauty.

78
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,082
Is this the girl?!

79
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,723
No taste, you don't think
she looks like Maradonna?

80
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,055
Maradonna is the soccer player.

81
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,426
Anyway go ahead with your settlement.

82
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,397
Well, you still treat me
as your big brother.

83
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,498
Brother Wing, sing along!

84
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,162
O.K...

85
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,234
Brother Wing, take her up to a room.

86
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,603
One needs the mood to do it.

87
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,577
The room's booked for 3 days.

88
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,248
Sorry Sir, it's a full house tonight.

89
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,245
Sing!

90
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:24,762
...will love bear first?

91
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:34,370
Will promise turn love into truth?

92
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:42,238
Separation may not be bad...

93
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,614
Song is not finished yet, let's go!

94
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,412
Bok Min!

95
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,987
Only way, 0.K?

96
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,088
I'm here to negotiate,
don't need table, 0.K?!

97
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,726
Go up and sing again!

98
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:56,850
Don't have to.

99
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,529
Who said that?

100
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,662
I said it!

101
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,526
Who are you?

102
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,800
I'm Tarzan. He's my bodyguard, Bok Min.

103
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,773
Never heard of you.

104
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,341
You are cheeky.

105
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,170
You have more men but I'm not afraid.

106
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,411
Not that many!

107
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,617
Go get toe microphone!
Yes!

108
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,746
This on for you!
I don't know how to sing.

109
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,721
I'm here to get you.
No, I'm here to save you.

110
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,297
Save me? You or him?

111
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,193
Take the box away!

112
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,516
Bok Min, draw the gun.

113
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,527
Don't touch my girl.

114
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,634
Brother... Bok Min, come and save me!

115
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,300
Don't let him go.
Damn you!

116
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,754
Get the weapon, quick!

117
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:38,962
Freeze!

118
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,393
Don't move!

119
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,001
Are you alright?

120
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,239
No, since I paid a high rental for this.

121
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:57,405
Don't move...

122
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,312
Freeze!

123
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,286
My hand hurts!

124
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,014
Are you alright?

125
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,223
You don't have to be afraid!

126
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,791
Are you Bok Min?
Yes!

127
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,424
I beat 5 guys bare handed.

128
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,156
These bullets... 10...

129
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,730
Anyway, it's a lot.

130
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,266
Who wants to die for you boss,
come forward.

131
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,959
Come forward!

132
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,365
Let's go, boss!

133
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,000
Go?! How about the score?

134
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,339
Not so easy.

135
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,570
Give me the gun and let me show off.

136
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,481
We've already done so.

137
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,881
You did, not me.

138
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,318
This gun is so light.
Don't be wordy!

139
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,684
Kneel down, kotwo, apologize,
it's a dummy gun!

140
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:44,856
What are you doing?

141
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,124
Only a few bucks. Of course it's a dummy.

142
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,927
Quick, run!
Get them!

143
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,767
Close the door! Pull down the latch.

144
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,599
Don't run!

145
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,926
Damn you!

146
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,964
Iron cloth!

147
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,804
Nothing!

148
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:40,750
Bok Min!

149
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,515
Your turn.

150
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,319
What? Can't beat me, too shameful.

151
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,727
How can you keep up with this job?

152
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,122
Sorry!

153
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,258
Damn you!

154
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,935
Bok Min, here I come to save you!

155
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,148
How come things never work out.

156
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,558
Good! Good!

157
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,271
You competing with me?
Look at yourself, so short.

158
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,203
You baldhead,
you're not that much better.

159
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,367
Ah Wai!

160
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,252
You're Ah Wai, our rule is to
hit the big one and spare the small.

161
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,413
Want to shame yourself again?

162
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,821
Can't do worse than you.

163
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,429
Wait. I said the left leg.

164
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,992
Car race?!

165
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,634
You want to race?

166
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,763
I'll sure win, Wing!

167
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,874
You want to be like Kuen,

168
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,840
all his ribs broken.

169
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,903
Kuen is nothing?

170
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,640
His headlights

171
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,616
dare not shine on our bumper.

172
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,482
One touch of the gas and I beat him.

173
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,145
What's your credential?

174
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,382
My driving skill

175
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,151
is famous in Macau.

176
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,822
Princess Margaret Road is nothing to me.

177
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,324
Good, I'll race you in Macau.

178
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,522
What's the bet?

179
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:33,596
Three...

180
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,960
Thirty thousand? O.K!

181
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,027
No, it's 300,000!

182
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,662
O.K, 300,000, no problem.

183
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,104
300,000?!

184
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,638
I'll keep your ID. cards.

185
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,713
Go and find 300,000,
meet you at the pier.

186
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,012
Go to Macau and see who wins.

187
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,316
How would you race with him?
The car's always broken.

188
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,864
Do you guys remember me?

189
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,238
Get in, please!
Thanks.

190
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,967
Thank you for what you've done.

191
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,169
I've been working
at the Karaoke for a few days.

192
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,407
Wing comes for my everyday.

193
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,813
Weren't for you,

194
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,942
he would have forced me
to go to bed with him tonight.

195
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,850
Never mind.

196
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,445
You are really called Bok Min?

197
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,989
Yes really.

198
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,849
The name is so strange, what's yours?

199
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,221
Tarzan!

200
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,789
You don't know him?

201
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,691
Never been introduced.

202
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,633
But you said she's your girl?

203
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,838
Sooner or later, she'll be my girl.

204
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,532
Damn you, come out.
My turn to settle with you.

205
00:16:56,315 --> 00:17:00,217
Bok Min!

206
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,042
Don't break our friendship for a girl.

207
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,176
I'm about to got her.

208
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,084
I can lose my life for you.

209
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,086
But you should know about yourself.

210
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,953
This Maradonna, will she like you?

211
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,854
Look at her hair.

212
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,759
That means you'd be cuckolded.

213
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,924
Possibilities start as impossible things.

214
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,626
You...

215
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,710
I mustn't be recognized,
I'm here to make a living.

216
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,452
What's your name?

217
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:38,678
Barbara!

218
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,888
Miss Barbara, please tell this gentleman.

219
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,590
Whether you like him?

220
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,791
He?!

221
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,942
You don't have to say it. I know.

222
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,946
My boss is choosy.

223
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,779
You take good care of him.

224
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,211
Take her out. I'll go home.

225
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,975
Mister Ma,
is it your first Hong Kong Concert?

226
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,051
Yes! It is.

227
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,657
How do we raise $300,000?

228
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,695
Chan, where is my money?

229
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,733
Didn't you take my car for a race?

230
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,232
You owe my one?

231
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,737
Hey, you bet

232
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,170
and won in the race.

233
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,199
The car belongs to my boss.
The engine fell apart.

234
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,368
My winning didn't
even cover the repair cost.

235
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,743
What do you mean then?

236
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,041
This carjust had a checkup.

237
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,379
Damn you, you want me to show
this picture to your boss?

238
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,215
Want to blackmail me,
don't even drink of it.

239
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,782
My boss hasn't met her yet
when I went out with her.

240
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:24,327
Is that right?
But there's no date on the picture.

241
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:33,136
Tarzen, remember to print some more,
it's on him.

242
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,897
Give one to everybody in the hotel.

243
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,099
O.K., I'll write it down.

244
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,539
My boss's going to Japan.

245
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,167
See how you blackmail me?

246
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,140
I won't let you repair my car anymore.

247
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,780
Don't worry about it today.

248
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,349
It's done!
Take a leak first,

249
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,315
the washroom is very pretty.

250
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,784
Be quick, take the money and run.

251
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,254
I know!

252
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,328
What's the big deal with a big car?

253
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,961
I'm sorry...

254
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,731
Here we are, Mr. Ma!

255
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,498
Is there a washroom in the car?
You're living it up!

256
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,974
Pretend to have taste?

257
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,982
Fooling me? Don't you fool me?

258
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,109
My ass.

259
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,553
Hey kid, you're wrong.
I don't like to play this.

260
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,421
Then when do you like to play?

261
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,695
Tarzen, what are you squatting down for?

262
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:35,589
You think it's fun?
Still pretending to have taste?

263
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,531
Dare to hit me?!

264
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,864
Damn you, ridiculous.

265
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,466
Sorry!

266
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,977
Mr. Ma, welcome!

267
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,380
This way...

268
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,080
How come it's not a mirror?

269
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,088
It's not 200,000 but 400,000 shares.

270
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,457
Ma Yau! Do you recognize uncle?

271
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,494
Uncle Tong!

272
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,725
Great, we haven't seen each other
for a long time, come over here...

273
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,267
Look, recognize her?

274
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,139
She's Tong Sum, your childhood playmate.

275
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,038
Daughter, come over here to say hello.

276
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,902
This is first encounter.

277
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,979
She's a nurse.

278
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,984
She quits herjob to look after you.

279
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,383
I'm not sick.

280
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,991
You're back in Hong Kong for
the first time, very easy to get endemic.

281
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,716
You're an internationally
famous conductor.

282
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,921
If you get sick, you'll have no
interest in everything, and...

283
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,463
Uncle, I'll go to change.

284
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,863
O.K... we'll talk later.

285
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,896
Lower...

286
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,438
I've got a boyfriend.

287
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,508
I'm finding you a husband, not boyfriend.

288
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,702
What about Rocky?

289
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,903
Stallone?

290
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,380
No, Frankie Lok. I call him Rocky.

291
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,908
Rocky tells people to fight.
Hold this medicine chest.

292
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,019
I'm better than Rocky,

293
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,177
handling seven here.

294
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,314
Hope you can make it with Ma Yau.

295
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,450
Then ourjoint business with
the Ma family will get prosperous.

296
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,490
Ma Yau, my daughter is looking for you.

297
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,593
Remember touch... Go, get in!

298
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,675
Dear daughter, all depends on your now.

299
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,147
Alright, stop packing.

300
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,541
Really a lot of medicine,
I thought uncle was joking.

301
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,210
I didn't know nurses
nowadays dress so sexy.

302
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,846
You've exposed yourself on the top!

303
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:44,125
In fact, I don't take medicine
and vitamin pills.

304
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,130
Had I known it,
I wouldn't have brought so many.

305
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,459
Come, sit over here.

306
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:56,303
Your dress is so tight,
bad on your blood circulation.

307
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,200
Wrong posture.

308
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,275
Your spine must hurt a little.

309
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,105
How do you know?

310
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,349
Come, get into the bed!
So fast?!

311
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,716
Don't be nervous.
Do it slowly, be patient.

312
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,183
Do whatever you want to do, I'm yours.

313
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,056
Come, raise your leg higher. Relax!

314
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,797
It's almost done.

315
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,496
Is it better to take off the clothes?

316
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,067
Don't get anxious!

317
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,540
Is this foreplay?

318
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,079
I'm helping you warm up,

319
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,213
to let your blood circulate better.

320
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:43,982
Started?

321
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:49,987
Relax... is it comfortable?

322
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,693
Hey... Fall asleep already?

323
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,958
It's so tiring to twist this hard.

324
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,699
I learned and grew up here.

325
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,106
Never thought I have to leave.

326
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,610
I haven't heard about people
slipping back to the mainland.

327
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,082
Great, we're the first ones there!

328
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,982
We may get listed
in Guinness World Record.

329
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,950
Is there any prize?

330
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,116
Whatever it is,
we'll share it equally; hold it!

331
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,623
It's me again. What are you doing?

332
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,987
Make a phone call to Barbara.

333
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,424
She told you her phone number?

334
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,766
Look it up in the telephone book, stupid!

335
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:35,035
Damn, I take off my hat to you.

336
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:37,940
Awake.

337
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,533
You made me very comfortable last night.

338
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,110
Miss, what do you want to drink?

339
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,215
Boss, you're late.

340
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,612
Don't bother me, go talk to him.

341
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:48,815
What's with him?

342
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:49,852
I don't want to say. Ask him.

343
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,649
Where's the money?
Tarzan, pay the money.

344
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,813
You pay.

345
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,722
The money's with you.
Right!

346
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,118
Cheaper, O.K?

347
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,130
Pay him.

348
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,197
This boat is stolen,

349
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,062
costs you nothing. You're rich.

350
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,692
Call me when you get to Swatow.

351
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,295
Hey, what's Barbara's last name?

352
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,839
Barbara's last name, of course, is Bar.

353
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,908
Sun, does this boat have enough fuel?

354
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,099
Yes!

355
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,118
Something's wrong.
We've been betrayed by Sun.

356
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,243
No boat?

357
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,652
No, a lot of people come to say farewell.

358
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:25,552
Don't have to!

359
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,488
You take a look!

360
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,254
Where did you put my phone book?

361
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,993
Use IDD to call 108 when you get there.
Release the rope!

362
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,396
They're down there!

363
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,931
Hurry!

364
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,571
Start the boat!

365
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,003
Freeze!

366
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,614
Damn it... Didn't make it.

367
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,880
Didn't even let me know
you're going out to sea.

368
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,083
Go back ashore.

369
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,345
You're kidding.

370
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,113
Go back ashore. I don't know how to swim!

371
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,848
Stewed celery with preserved vegetable,
plus one egg.

372
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,687
What?

373
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:01,917
Rubbish!

374
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,352
Sit tight.

375
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,591
Hold this boat...

376
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,823
Can't hold it.

377
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,369
Stewed celery?

378
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,340
How vulgar can you get!

379
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,876
Put on the life jacket. No more rubbish.

380
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,053
Chase...

381
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,427
Follow them.
Yes!

382
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,866
Sit tight, be careful.

383
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,366
It's too dangerous
to enter international waters.

384
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,140
What are you doing?

385
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,676
The seat is springy.
I feel like sailing.

386
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,611
I feel funny ever since
I came to Hong Kong.

387
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,313
I've never been on a boat.
Is this seasickness!

388
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:08,349
Dad said to let you have this car,
it's more convenient.

389
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,093
It's no use.
I'm not familiar with the roads.

390
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,995
If you get lost, just call me.

391
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,832
It's trembling a lot.

392
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,408
It's close to the sea.
It's really trembling a lot.

393
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,953
You better sit further.
The wave is big here.

394
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,091
Damn you, stop him.

395
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,969
You're too careless.

396
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,380
Pull over there, let me beat him up.

397
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,977
Go to hell!

398
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,152
What a big garoupa!

399
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,658
Let it go, we're running for life.

400
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:21,024
Go to hell! Got it.

401
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,833
Tug boat!

402
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,248
Tarzan!

403
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,718
Got one.

404
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,021
Hit it, stupid!

405
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,056
They've slowed down, go hit it.

406
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,593
Bok Min, I'll go first.

407
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,499
It's not Swatow yet,
you've got to hold on.

408
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,870
I'll revenge for you.

409
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,876
Bok Min, I'm alright, no need to revenge.

410
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,822
Go to hell. Use the fish gun to shoot us!

411
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,630
I don't know how to drive
a speed boat. Help!

412
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,189
Keep your eyes at the front, look out...

413
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,757
No way to go.

414
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,539
Help!...

415
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,675
Really lucky!

416
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,221
Tarzan!

417
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,485
O.K., O.K.

418
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,163
You blind?

419
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,125
Be careful of the car!

420
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,704
Wing!...

421
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,352
The bill!

422
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,291
Sorry to make you wet.

423
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,588
Let's go ashore.

424
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,496
Why don't you get changed,
we'll go for a drink.

425
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,657
No, I'm afraid you'll
go back to the boat.

426
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,294
Thank you!

427
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,168
Don't worry, we'll find one
which is not close to the sea.

428
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,135
Guess what are they talking about?

429
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,138
Maybe dress rehearsing.

430
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,971
Tarzan... Tarzan...

431
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,414
Are we in Swatow yet? It's so noisy!

432
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,142
No, still in Hong Kong.

433
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,844
You're lucky,

434
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,046
the bumper is only slightly dented.

435
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,520
Wing's car has fallen apart,

436
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,022
a total loss.

437
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:05,288
Wing... Wing...

438
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,627
Shut up,

439
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,493
can't even hear his heartbeat.

440
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,830
Are you a doctor?
What?

441
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,272
Are you a doctor?

442
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,206
You blind, do I not look like a doctor?

443
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,500
We don't need you.

444
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,613
We've invited a supernatural power person

445
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,373
to cure our master.

446
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,508
Please give way!
Supernatural power?

447
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:33,149
This kind of medical technology
is too behind, you may go.

448
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,023
Excuse me, everybody please step back.

449
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:40,290
I'm afraid I'll hurt you people
when I exert my force.

450
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,500
Short of breath?

451
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,909
Breath is not there yet...
Give way please.

452
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,910
It's alright...
Continue with the exertion.

453
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:11,924
No need to.
Continue.

454
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,160
Hey kid, I have practiced
feat of strength.

455
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,794
Don't know if you're better, or mine.

456
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,667
Don't interrupt me
when I'm saving people.

457
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,497
So exaggerating!

458
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,276
Eat slowly, it's hot.

459
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,510
Hey, don't interrupt
when my boss's eating.

460
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,887
The protection fee
of this hospital is paid to us.

461
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,550
Hey man, you put yourself to death.

462
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,460
Boss, let's go to another one.

463
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,656
O.K.!

464
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,599
My brother...

465
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,132
Don't move!

466
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,763
If you can move out from
this hospital, I won't be Advisor Tso.

467
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,638
At first, we want to do
a deal with Choi's driving skill.

468
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,774
But, you've made him like this.

469
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,041
I know your driving skill is not bad.

470
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,581
You have to take on this deal now.

471
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,580
Doing what?
Don't ask,

472
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,383
turn on the cellular phone
24 hours a day.

473
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,750
Report at anytime.

474
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,615
Or else, get ready
to collect Tarzan's body.

475
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,625
Let's go!

476
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,573
Emotion, I need feelings!

477
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,612
It's too mechanical
to read the notes and play.

478
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,845
No feelings, no response.

479
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,975
I want you to look at my hand, my face.

480
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,383
My eyes, my feet.

481
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,679
My body language

482
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,755
will give new feelings to the music.

483
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,680
Okay?!

484
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:25,994
What I need

485
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,962
a fusion of emotion and music.

486
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,003
Tong Sum, where are you? Speak out.

487
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,246
Hey, Rocky, I'm very busy.

488
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,511
Are you with another man?

489
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:51,383
I don't have another boy friend?
I didn't lie to you.

490
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,112
I'll call you in a few days.

491
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,952
I'm doing some business for my dad.

492
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,118
Tong Sum!

493
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:57,926
It's him.

494
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,427
She ditched me for this guy?

495
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,358
Dad's business will collapse.

496
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,143
Now you get the feeling right.

497
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,304
Don't use an instrument.

498
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,609
A musical instrument?

499
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,289
Dare to date my girl?

500
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:38,458
Tarzen treated you well.
Why don't you see him.

501
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,596
Who says women are soft-hearted?

502
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:44,606
No reaction to my begging at all.

503
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:45,936
No gas.

504
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,377
You can buy gas anytime,

505
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,241
but can't buy one's trust.

506
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,872
Think of it as visiting a friend,
give him some confidence.

507
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,848
Visit him? I'm afraid he'll sink deeper.

508
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:59,147
You cure him after he gets well.

509
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,985
Me again? An exorcist?

510
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,319
Which movie are you guys talking about?

511
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,018
I know, it's bad luck.

512
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,763
Give some comment, O.K?

513
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,292
Two!

514
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,665
Two? This way please!

515
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,304
Aren't you seated already?

516
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:24,379
Tarzen and I don't think
kindly about you.

517
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,780
Don't talk about me.

518
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,816
Mr... please don't lean against the glass.

519
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,913
You'll press against
the gentleman on the other side.

520
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,556
Mr... please don't lean against the glass.

521
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,357
It's not good to press
against the gentleman.

522
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,500
Still shaking while sitting down.

523
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,433
Didn't you mother teach you
that shaking legs cuts one down.

524
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,836
You and he are of the same kind.

525
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,340
People do change.

526
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,466
Good, I like music. What about you?

527
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,703
Music?

528
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,642
Finished singing?

529
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,814
What is music anyway?

530
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:01,916
What do you have to say?

531
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,019
Right, who's that guy?

532
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,552
My boyfriend.

533
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,421
He looks like an angel from hell.

534
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,655
He's my partner at the health club.

535
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,592
What? Aren't you a nurse?

536
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,631
Occupation doesn't matter.
Compatibility does.

537
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,325
How can I tell him then?

538
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,358
Whatever you want to say.

539
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:20,729
I understand men.

540
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,465
You treat him and he'll fight with me.

541
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,241
Hey, you're not the one called.

542
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,039
Go and explain to him.

543
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,446
I'm so confused these days.

544
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,181
In fact, your masculinity
is not as strong as his.

545
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:37,444
But I like you too.

546
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:40,480
What did you say? What good is liking?

547
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,692
I didn't say it, others did.

548
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,453
But, you have to see him.

549
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,530
Forget it. I'll take you to him.

550
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,896
I won't take any responsibility.

551
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,934
You won't, I will.

552
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,559
Waiter, give me the check.

553
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,569
Okay, coming!

554
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,937
Wait for me at the door;
I have to go to the toilet.

555
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,943
Let's go back early today.
I have a rehearsal,

556
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,807
and a performance tonight.
Paying the bill?

557
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,147
I haven't ordered anything. What payment?

558
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,682
Something's wrong with my eyes.

559
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,051
Mr., are you paying the bill?

560
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,651
In fact, he's not that mean.

561
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,985
Your partner is coming.

562
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,387
Go into hiding.

563
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,196
What now?
Don't come out! Hide yourself!

564
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,303
Tong Sum!

565
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,214
You bastard, don't go away.

566
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,774
You date my girl! Bastard, don't run!

567
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,453
Rocky, don't!

568
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,922
Bastard...

569
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,523
don't you dare!

570
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,556
Tong Sum, I want you to know
what makes real man.

571
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,253
You better run; he will beat you to death.

572
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,385
Bastard, I'll kill you.

573
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,359
Tong Sum, you stand there.

574
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:07,244
What happened, men?

575
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,235
Don't hit him; hit me instead.

576
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,137
Miss, why are you so nice to me,
a stranger?

577
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,111
Get away!

578
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:18,085
You better run, I'll hold it for you.
Quick, run!

579
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:22,290
Miss, you hurt my male ego.

580
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,103
Muscle!

581
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,466
Mister, change!

582
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,108
Keep it.

583
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,075
Hold her. Take it!

584
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,046
Haven't you had enough?

585
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,318
I don't know you.

586
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:55,619
I don't know you either.

587
00:39:58,696 --> 00:39:59,594
Sorry!

588
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,589
This long!

589
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,533
Why so scared? Didn't pay the bill?

590
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:10,571
No!

591
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,539
This outfit is not yours. You stole it.

592
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:14,905
What? What stealing?

593
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:18,914
You're play-acting? This car is pretty.

594
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,643
So you're driving your customer's car!

595
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,018
Not bad, doctor or lawyer?

596
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,351
Miss, where are you going?

597
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,392
Start the car! Is real leather.

598
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,693
Stop it...

599
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,265
A percentage even on this!

600
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,027
You play dirty.

601
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,434
Sir, this is all mine.

602
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,065
Not me. It's he who hit me.

603
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,272
Hey, I really don't know you.

604
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,405
Don't know?

605
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,846
I don't know you two either.

606
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,279
I'll finish you off.

607
00:40:58,956 --> 00:40:59,752
Knee?

608
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:02,851
Damn you!

609
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,026
Look out!

610
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,563
You've been working out.

611
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,370
How annoying!
These are so expensive.

612
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,101
Everything is gone now.

613
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,670
Bastard, you refused to yield me.

614
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:25,874
All finished.

615
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,579
Pick as much as one can.

616
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,560
Told you to stop.

617
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,905
Wait for a minute!

618
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,974
My stuff was all broken.
Who is going to pay for it?

619
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,175
The loser must pay, right?

620
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:57,739
Not yet?

621
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,084
You're so strong.
I'll go first; he's got money.

622
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,311
You're rich; pay for it, quick!

623
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,717
I'm not.
No?

624
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,090
It's he who hit me.

625
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:14,794
Terrific!

626
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,425
I didn't know you before.
What are you doing?

627
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,463
Get to know you right now.

628
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,037
I think it's true. What do you want?

629
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,400
Stop making fun.

630
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,941
Stop joking? Then what?

631
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:32,814
Miss, what's your name?

632
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:36,885
Barbara. You've asked
ten times already, Bok Min!

633
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,580
I'm not Bok Min, I'm Ma Yau.

634
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,123
Miss, where can I take you?

635
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,885
To see Tarzan.

636
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,286
Tarzan? Do you like this kind of movie?

637
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,421
You said for me to see him.

638
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,796
Me?

639
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,965
It's a waste of talent
as you've not an actor.

640
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,429
Right, I took opera
when I was in college.

641
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,839
You sing opera?
Yes!

642
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,606
Very good, your singing isn't bad.

643
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,578
How come you know it too?
Yes!

644
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,350
I played ninth grade piano
when I was eight,

645
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,887
and got into the
Royal Music Conservatory at 12,

646
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,120
and won the
Beethoven Conducting Award at 20.

647
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:22,958
Yes, I know. You have a lot of money too.

648
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,056
Well!

649
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,795
Oh yes, you returned from studies abroad.

650
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,698
How do you know?

651
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,262
Oh, of course!

652
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,907
You have some interest in music too,
right?

653
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,633
My father taught piano in Mainland China.

654
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,977
You know, the situation
wasn't good at that time,

655
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,939
he didn't leave me anything.

656
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,549
Just everything he knew about music,

657
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,708
for me to start something.

658
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,980
Before I could make
his dream come true he died.

659
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,254
You will get the chance...

660
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,099
So big!

661
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:02,938
Hey, you made me
so comfortable last time. Do it once more.

662
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,564
I can repair cars but not other things.

663
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,466
I'll wait for you in bed.

664
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,884
This joke has gone too far.

665
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:21,453
I have some skill for this. Let me try.

666
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,334
What about it? Beethoven!

667
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,098
Do you want to listen to Beethoven?

668
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,446
Stop!
What're wrong.

669
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,751
Keep going!

670
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,260
Nothing, play another one.
O.K!

671
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:39,894
Try it, come on!

672
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:45,908
Me? No.. Don't!

673
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,370
Come on!

674
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:59,948
Close your eyes,
and imagine it's your recital.

675
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,378
What? I'm waiting for you, hurry!

676
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,050
Damn you!

677
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,363
Do you drink and smoke?

678
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:25,924
I drink and smoke every night.

679
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,133
What did we do a moment ago?

680
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,231
You asked me to come to bed.

681
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,740
It wasn't like this last time.

682
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,637
Did I go to bed with you last time?

683
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:38,678
What do you think I am?

684
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,147
I didn't think you're a whore,
so you'd better not think I'm a gigolo!

685
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,749
Whore? Gigolo?

686
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,618
Go and get the phone?

687
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:49,653
Time to stop the argument.

688
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,418
What concert were you talking about?

689
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:52,758
It's my concert.

690
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,820
Your concert?!
When will you stop fooling me?

691
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:59,196
With my boss in Japan,
you've leaning on me!

692
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,930
You're so impolite. What is your name?

693
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,096
Security!
Don't fool around, Bok Min.

694
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,435
Get him out.

695
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,032
This gentleman...
What's the matter?

696
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:10,140
He is making a scenes here. I...

697
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,477
Mr. Ma?!
Yes!

698
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:13,379
You know why your boss got sent to Japan.

699
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,949
It's because
he was also rude to customers.

700
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,349
In fact I...
Quickly apologize?

701
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,818
Sorry!

702
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,186
Get out.
Never mind!

703
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,551
Mr. Ma, glad to meet you!

704
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,751
It's OK... Say no more. It's OK!

705
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,958
I am sorry!
I have to go back to my room.

706
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,965
Mr. Ma, your concert
will start at 2 o'clock.

707
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,434
Right, I almost forgot.

708
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,969
You'd better take a rest.
We'll keep the secret.

709
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,235
Enjoy!

710
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,234
You last name is Ma?
Yes.

711
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,471
Artists are also human.

712
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,913
Why did you dress me like this?

713
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,745
Are you going to take me out,
or I take you out?

714
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,011
What are you talking about?

715
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:51,743
Come, have a kiss.

716
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,313
Come on, people are waiting
for your performance.

717
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,221
No, me and you? Don't fool around!

718
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,123
Quick, pull up the zipper.
It got caught!

719
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,957
Elevator's here, hurry...
Where we going to?

720
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,294
How much did you pay for this show?

721
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,902
The rent here is 2000 dollars each day.

722
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,369
2000?
American dollars

723
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,499
Your game is really expensive.

724
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,769
My God...

725
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,071
Let's go.
Why?

726
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,816
What game are you playing?
I'm not playing.

727
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,553
Who is he?
I don't know.

728
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,697
Master.
What's the matter?

729
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,928
Please take me as your disciple.

730
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,535
Please be my teacher.
I want to learn form you.

731
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,340
Learn from me.
Yes.

732
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,810
Please let me be your student, Master.

733
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,478
How much have you learned so far?

734
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:55,743
I'm at the eighth grade in karate
and the ninth grade in Taekwondo.

735
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,914
Then why do you need to learn from him?

736
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,580
You must teach me.

737
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,090
You've mistaken. I am a music teacher.

738
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,184
I don't know any Kung Fu.

739
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,351
I don't like fighting.

740
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:10,160
He hates fighting
but he has special psychic powers.

741
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:13,825
Psychic powers.
I don't like fighting either.

742
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,768
I've totally changed, look.

743
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,138
Every scar on my body is a gift from you.

744
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,970
The scars represent
my determination to be your student.

745
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,111
Why did you hit him so.
You are wrong.

746
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,215
He didn't hit me. He taught me.

747
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,210
It sure looks like it.

748
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,586
Master, please be my teacher.

749
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,659
Please...
Please don't...

750
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:41,556
Fine, I'll be your teacher.
Great.

751
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,160
Then when should I start to learn.

752
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,098
Start now. You must first buy a piano.

753
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,430
Then practise six hours everyday.

754
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:49,637
Playing the piano...
what kind of Gung Fu is that?

755
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,706
It's a practice of pressing.
Pressing.

756
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,909
Your fingers will become stronger.

757
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,875
I see. When should I start, Master?

758
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,742
Immediately. Say goodbye now.

759
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:03,113
Goodbye, Master...

760
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,345
Is she your wife? Bye
Shut up.

761
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:10,425
Have a nice day. Master, Madam, bye.

762
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,953
He doesn't know how to act.
Who would trust him.

763
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,531
I myself don't believe in him.

764
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,497
Let's rush to the press conference.

765
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,797
What? Press Conference?

766
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:22,968
Come on.

767
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,670
You sure look like a musician.

768
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:29,176
lam really a musician.

769
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,838
You thought I was lying?

770
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,812
I knew you were lying,
but I chose to believe your lies.

771
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:44,616
Don't know where she is going to take me?

772
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,694
When will this joke end?!

773
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,296
Looks something unorthodox is called for.

774
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,563
Again.

775
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:57,029
There's no reason.

776
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,486
Oh, ghost!

777
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:16,917
Why do you look exactly like me?
Even the same clothes.

778
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:22,158
Yes!

779
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,491
Are you ghost or man?
How come exactly the same?

780
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,294
Right, good to run into you here.

781
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:30,235
Seen by people outside,
we'll be in real trouble.

782
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:34,977
Oh, that short-haired girl
must have mistaken me for you.

783
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,477
That's why she insisted
I dress like this.

784
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:37,409
Damn you!

785
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,308
The long haired girl
must thought I was you,

786
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:41,983
that's why she wouldn't
believe I'll give a concert.

787
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,043
A concert? So you're a band boy.

788
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,050
So what?

789
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,055
Nothing, hey, you understand now?

790
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:49,851
I understand. Remember,
you must give me back my clothes.

791
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:51,416
Or else it'll get very messy.

792
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:55,123
O.K., but don't mention it to that girl.

793
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:57,591
Do you know Barbara?

794
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,066
What? You've seen Barbara?

795
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,692
I didn't know whether is her or not.

796
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,803
But she got into my car uninvited,

797
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,134
and kept saying to see Tarzan.

798
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,507
Then I'll buy her a Tarzan video tape.

799
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,813
Hey, how come we both sneeze
at that same time?

800
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,018
That's right!

801
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,480
Have you been on a boat lately?

802
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:21,421
Yes!

803
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,859
My god, no wonder I was seasick.

804
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,790
Do you react if I call a prostitute?

805
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,253
Did you really do it?

806
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,195
Why should I tell you?

807
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,201
Hope this isn't his reaction.

808
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,939
I don't like people
patting on my shoulder.

809
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,469
You forgot this phone.

810
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:42,903
Thanks!

811
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:46,712
You damned band boy.

812
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,486
Mr. Ma, this way!

813
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,484
Finished with the washroom?

814
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,596
What are you doing here, Barbara?

815
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,632
You sick? You brought me here.
The room is very pretty.

816
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,602
When did we turn out to be so close?

817
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,002
In the room today.

818
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,234
Room? You and him in a room?

819
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,910
Why do you react like this?
You're acting?

820
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,343
What have I done?

821
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,636
What has he done?

822
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:19,646
He...

823
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:20,681
Didn't you know what you've done?

824
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,147
Must remind you always.

825
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,214
His involvement is also my involvement.

826
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,982
I just want to see whether you remember.

827
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,714
Did you say to buy me
a Tarzan video tape?

828
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,517
When did Tarzan make a video tape?

829
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:32,459
Oh no!

830
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,898
Hey! It's Bok Min.
Bok Min?

831
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,491
Come out. Been looking for you.

832
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,297
I'm not Bok Min. You made a mistake.

833
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,268
I took the wrong one; this phone is his.

834
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:48,240
Fooling around again!

835
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:49,367
You can't even remember
what you have done?

836
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,503
You damn fool,
always do things similar to mine.

837
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,318
I'll check with you later.

838
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:00,681
Hello, Bok Min?

839
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:03,215
I'm inside, where are you?

840
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,554
I'm outside.

841
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:07,457
Come in quick. I have to protect her.

842
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,765
Hey, this place is full of danger...

843
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,798
I can't come in now.

844
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,593
You come out and help me explain, OK?

845
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:14,862
I will if! can.

846
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,768
But I really can't come out.
Right now, I'm...

847
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:21,671
Damn it. Battery's out.

848
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:24,837
You wait for me,
I'll change the telephone.

849
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,211
It'll be late.
Won't be long.

850
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,650
Wai is looking for me. Don't go away.

851
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,766
This way, Mr. Ma!

852
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,861
Changed the telephone?
Been waiting for you!

853
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:49,896
Why is Wai waiting for me in the car?
Yes!

854
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:55,467
It's almost time, don't fool around.

855
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:57,603
Start the car!
OK!

856
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,003
Start the car? Where to go?

857
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,246
The concert.

858
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,845
Don't tell me he's left on that car.

859
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:08,722
You guys saw it.

860
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,556
You thought I have blurred vision?

861
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:19,430
My God, when did you get off the car?

862
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,671
What? Good, I have to
explain one thing to you.

863
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,330
Don't touch me.

864
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:26,669
Pretend you do not know us?

865
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,304
I don't know you people.

866
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,504
Tarzan's life is in our hand.
Don't you dare to play tricks?

867
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:31,545
They like to watch Tarzan too.

868
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,511
You know we've got Tarzan.

869
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,047
You better make it clear, I'm confused.

870
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:39,612
I know what had happened
in the washroom a moment ago.

871
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,654
You knew? You just
came out of the washroom.

872
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,589
And kept asking me what had happened.

873
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,561
What did you tell me then?

874
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,426
Are you going to ask me again
what have you done?

875
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,395
No, but it'll be good

876
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,522
if you are willing
to tell me one more time.

877
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,329
Take both of them away.

878
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,459
Take them away!

879
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,730
Who are you people?

880
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,180
Hey, I don't know this place.
What do you want me to do?

881
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:07,646
Want you to save people.

882
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,443
That's great, save who?

883
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:12,282
Our boss has been taken away today;
he is in that car.

884
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:15,514
No way, it's serious crime
to rob a patrol wagon.

885
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,650
Your skill is tops, show it this time.

886
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:21,322
If you fail, Barbara and Tarzan will die.

887
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:22,761
Calm down!

888
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,264
You've got to calm down first.

889
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,594
You look more scared than I do.

890
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:31,805
This is your concert?

891
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:33,772
I didn't want to come here.
You pushed me here.

892
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:38,811
Don't fool around,
unless you admit you're not Ma Yau.

893
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,809
I'm really not Ma Yau. I'm Bok Min.

894
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:44,977
Don't joke with your own future, go!

895
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,482
I hate making jokes with people's future.

896
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,660
If you go away now,
you'll ruin Ma Yau's future.

897
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:56,588
Why don't you go out? Got no guts?

898
00:58:57,467 --> 00:59:00,265
I have guts,
but you have to take the consequence.

899
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,196
I've already known
what the consequences are.

900
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:09,376
So many people!
What are you doing?

901
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,939
How can I face such
a big crowd by myself?

902
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:13,078
Right, the baton.

903
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,205
Isn't it a baseball bat?

904
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,874
Use the baseball bat next time.

905
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:19,443
Damn you!

906
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:29,558
Move
Yes.

907
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:40,898
Their fire power is stronger than ours.

908
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,408
Call back to headquarters.

909
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,712
Withdraw, withdraw.

910
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,485
Don't be afraid, boss.
I'm coming to save you.

911
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,711
This can do?

912
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,387
Relax, don't be afraid...

913
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:37,693
Don't grab my hand.

914
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,268
You wait for me here, relax.

915
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:45,236
You two get off the car.
Yes!

916
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,502
What's wrong? Can't start it!

917
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:49,076
The safety switch! Be patient.

918
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,304
Calm down!

919
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,466
What? Is this good enough for an X movie?

920
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,299
How about this! Replace the quiet scene

921
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,101
with a bestial scene.

922
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:23,637
Hurry up!

923
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:28,907
Like two bulls versus a girl, no...

924
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:30,210
To be exact; two pigs!

925
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:32,083
Two bulls or two pigs? Think it over.

926
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,428
Who are you?

927
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,292
Bok Min? Where are you?
Come and help me, quick.

928
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,367
Brother, please come to help me.

929
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,731
I'm performing for you
in the concert right now,

930
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:50,602
and it is such a mess.

931
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,938
This is messier than the Persian Gulf,
come help me over here.

932
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,236
What Persian Gulf?

933
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:57,140
Persian Gulf War! Flying bullets!

934
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,180
Listen if you don't believe.

935
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:05,610
What am I going to do now?

936
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,782
The smart aleck's advice:
before the coast is clear.

937
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:09,983
Don't surface.

938
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:14,761
Did you hear it?

939
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:16,822
You're acting as me right now.

940
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:20,196
Do whatever you think
I'll do under the circumstances.

941
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:21,633
You're acting as me too.

942
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,568
Do what you think I'll do.

943
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:27,336
Einstein said a good band
needs a conductor,

944
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:29,934
a lousy band needs an agitator.

945
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:31,371
Come out!

946
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,345
Good luck everybody.

947
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,777
Come out! Get up and
open the patrol wagon.

948
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:40,082
Brother, don't aim at me please.

949
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:44,151
Hey, man, got a light?
Yes!

950
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:01,769
Damn you, bear with it!

951
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,497
Started already.

952
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,793
Come on, that dummy
couldn't open the door.

953
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,202
Who is this guy? He is so mean.

954
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:31,431
He is my brother's brother.

955
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,802
Big Big Brother! The biggest?

956
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:35,972
Start the car please? I beg you.

957
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,376
Start the car... hurry!

958
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,620
Feelings!

959
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:56,630
What feelings! Shut up!

960
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,903
Is this riding a horse or driving a car?

961
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,641
Hit him! Hit this bastard!

962
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:17,618
No way, it's a crime.

963
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,362
Don't run into it!

964
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:08,201
Are you alright? Boss!

965
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:09,498
I'll go first!

966
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:13,740
Start the car or get killed.

967
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:27,211
They are here, Wai!

968
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,250
Step on t he brake, step on it...

969
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:33,226
You do it!

970
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:34,227
What is it!

971
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,557
It's a brake.

972
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:38,625
Fire!

973
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:56,681
Pull the hand-brake!

974
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:58,216
You do it, brother.

975
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,576
Go and save the boss, hurry!

976
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:48,099
Welcome, Mr. Ma!

977
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,067
Your concert is a triumph.

978
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,265
Our hotel has prepared
some champagne for your celebration.

979
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:59,971
Mr. Ma's back.

980
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,549
Hello, welcome!

981
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,846
Is the VIP Function Room upstairs ready?

982
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:05,818
I'm pleased!

983
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:07,354
We're all ready.

984
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,485
May I know who are you?

985
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,649
Ma Yau!

986
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,020
And then who is that guy a moment ago?

987
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:18,093
Did he come back?

988
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:19,698
Who?

989
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:21,826
Come on, people are waiting for you.

990
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,168
I'll take a shower first
and come down later.

991
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:25,667
A shower?!

992
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,243
Come in and talk.

993
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,413
You band boy has
caused me a lot of trouble.

994
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,317
I nearly lost my life.

995
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:41,781
Don't say anything now.
We'll change back our identity.

996
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:45,085
You're back as Bok Min; me, Ma Yau, O.K?

997
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:48,820
Hey, did you do it with Barbara?

998
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,391
What, no!

999
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:54,335
This is my room.

1000
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:01,203
Is Tong Sum!

1001
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:03,877
Under this situation,
you should hide upstairs.

1002
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,078
O.K, I won't keep you from happiness.

1003
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,152
Thanks.
Did I say wait for me downstairs?

1004
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:19,088
You haven't shower yet?
People are waiting for you.

1005
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,356
I know, you go down first
and I'll be there soon.

1006
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:26,523
What?

1007
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:27,829
Have a kiss first.

1008
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,464
You fool!

1009
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,537
Wait for you downstairs.

1010
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:38,936
Where is the purse?

1011
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,146
Hey, are you alright?
What are you doing there?

1012
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,544
I'm ready for a shower,
you think I'm sleeping?

1013
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:50,887
It's getting more complicated.
What do you think we should do?

1014
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,859
Tong Sum takes you as me,
and Barbara takes me as you.

1015
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,261
I really don't know what to do.

1016
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:58,889
Honestly speaking,
is Tong Sum your girl?

1017
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:03,864
But in fact, I like Barbara more.

1018
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:08,342
Barbara is Tarzan's girl.
Don't even think of it.

1019
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:11,674
Think what! I don't know Tarzan at all.

1020
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,907
What? You touch my friend's girl;
it's just like touching my girl.

1021
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:18,611
No touching my girl.
Don't you understand?

1022
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,285
You touched my girl too.

1023
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:24,420
I didn't know she's your girl.

1024
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,152
I don't care whose girlfriend she is.

1025
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,691
She is not my type,
and it is none of your business.

1026
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:30,263
What did you say?

1027
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,297
Doesn't matter.

1028
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,797
What did you say?

1029
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:34,529
Want to fight.

1030
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:38,166
Ma Yau!

1031
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,004
Are you alright?

1032
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,307
Alright!

1033
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,774
She's asking me, not you!

1034
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:52,217
She takes me as you,
so I answer her for you.

1035
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,318
Who are you with in there?

1036
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,185
What to do? She's my girlfriend.

1037
01:09:57,293 --> 01:10:00,785
She thought the one she likes
is Ma Yau, not Bok Min!

1038
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:04,331
One can't be sure. Beside,
with her I've...

1039
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:08,130
So you want her to know that,

1040
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:10,228
she's been cheated by a joke Ma Yau?

1041
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:14,637
Open the door.
Or I'll ask someone to break it.

1042
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:18,042
Coming... hide yourself, quick!

1043
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:20,642
I say it in advance.

1044
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,649
Don't make a pass at her.

1045
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:23,979
Do you make a pass
at her of I make a pass?

1046
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:25,552
My making pass is the same
as you making it.

1047
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:26,484
What?

1048
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,522
What? Use you brain.

1049
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,353
An intellectual!

1050
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:38,925
What are you doing?

1051
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:41,298
Are you alright?
I'm OK!

1052
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:43,094
Who are you talking to just now?

1053
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:46,499
I cheated you.

1054
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:48,702
No body's inside;
it's me speaking as two people.

1055
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,311
I've bathed. Let's go downstairs.

1056
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:58,718
What are you doing?

1057
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:01,846
You got me wet and I need a shower too.

1058
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:03,817
A shower?

1059
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:09,760
Will you excuse me,
I'd like another shower.

1060
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:13,524
It's not necessary.
We'll take it together.

1061
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:15,395
Well, I won't take it then.

1062
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:17,701
We did the same last time.

1063
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:19,606
Have I taken a shower with you before?

1064
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,504
Not only once,
and you didn't behave yourself.

1065
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,112
Afterwards we had another shower.

1066
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,646
You damn fool.

1067
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:33,680
You said no shower
but you're undressing yourself.

1068
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:35,153
I'm just doing what people do.

1069
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,190
It's really absurd.

1070
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,994
How come you've put on the clothes?

1071
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:50,330
Me? I haven't taken them off.

1072
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:54,532
Haven't? Were my eyes blurred just now?

1073
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:00,644
What are you doing?

1074
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,239
Running the water!

1075
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:03,817
The water's clean.

1076
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,283
Didn't you have a shower earlier?

1077
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:10,357
I did... but I like to
fill the tub after the shower.

1078
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:11,620
It's a habit!

1079
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:15,528
I have to get used to your habit slowly.

1080
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:20,193
I just don't know how.

1081
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:23,900
I have to anyway, I'm yours already.

1082
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:33,645
Better no shower.
Last time the shower never ended.

1083
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:35,881
What is it?

1084
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:42,651
Come, let's take
a shower together like last time.

1085
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:43,985
You're disgusting.

1086
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,756
You're naughty.

1087
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,320
People are waiting. Don't fool around.

1088
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,295
Don't worry about them?
Let's take a shower first.

1089
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,492
Don't!

1090
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,697
What? Shouting in front of the mirror.

1091
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,002
Mirror?!

1092
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:02,969
Yes?

1093
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:05,473
Yes?

1094
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:07,145
You scared me to death.

1095
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:08,341
Yes!

1096
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,481
Where's the man? It's gone.

1097
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:22,823
It's not a mirror. No more games.

1098
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,802
I'm not going to play more games.

1099
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:34,906
Hurry!

1100
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:40,347
Don't fool around,
we'll be late. People are waiting.

1101
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:43,374
I'll dry you. Come out quickly. Hurry!

1102
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:46,479
Disgusting!

1103
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:57,091
Operator... nothing,
just want to order a car.

1104
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,697
What's with you?

1105
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:02,133
I cleaned it,
and you made it dirty again.

1106
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:06,671
You're really bad.
Hurry, people are waiting for us.

1107
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,433
Damn you!

1108
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,373
Why it takes so long?

1109
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:16,976
Who are you looking for?

1110
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,612
I'm looking for Bok Min.

1111
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:22,513
Miss, who did you say you're looking for?

1112
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,759
Did you get the wrong room?

1113
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:28,385
I've been in this room before.

1114
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:29,689
He took me here just today.

1115
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:30,628
Barbara!

1116
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:33,257
Would you go downstairs
and check whether it's this room?

1117
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:34,529
Bok Min!

1118
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:36,529
Go fast and hide.

1119
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,734
Bok Min...

1120
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:46,873
Dare not see me?

1121
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,683
I don't mind your fooling around.

1122
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,247
What's the matter?

1123
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:54,346
Crazy Keung asks you
to bring the briefcase,

1124
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:56,447
to Yau Lun Dockyard
to meet him in one hour.

1125
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,584
Or else, Tarzan will be dead.

1126
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:05,294
What's wrong with you.
Just now you were fine.

1127
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:06,731
Suddenly you seem
to have become another person.

1128
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:09,463
No wonder you can pay for such a
beautiful room, you must be a gigolo.

1129
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:12,902
Hey, what are you saying?
What do you mean by that?

1130
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:14,540
Who is she?

1131
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:16,137
Barbara.

1132
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:17,567
Is she your guest?

1133
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:18,668
No!

1134
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,977
I'm Tong Sum, his fiancee.

1135
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,174
Fiance?

1136
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:25,750
Barbara...

1137
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:29,721
Don't you get me excited.
Remember you promised me.

1138
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:30,956
I promised...

1139
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,993
He needs people to remind him.
He never remembers?

1140
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,359
Why are you so nervous about her?

1141
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:40,691
It's exciting. You may not stand it.

1142
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:44,066
Bok Min, come out!

1143
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,673
No need to hide. The truth is out.

1144
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,266
He's afraid of scaring you girls.

1145
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,075
Don't hide, come out now of never.

1146
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:55,379
He's got not other way.

1147
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:01,121
Have to find him. Bok Min, come out!

1148
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,083
No!

1149
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:09,093
Is it I have schizophrenia?

1150
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:14,024
This is hallucination, not real person?!

1151
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:18,032
Closet...

1152
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:34,587
Hallucination?

1153
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:36,713
Come out!

1154
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:39,886
Really?!

1155
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,798
Tarzan's in trouble;
you have to see Crazy Keung.

1156
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,797
Where's Crazy Keung?

1157
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:52,330
He's at Yau Lun Dockyard.
Remember to bring this briefcase.

1158
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:53,170
Then you look after them.

1159
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,741
Will you come back?

1160
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,311
If I'm alright I'll come back for you.

1161
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:00,779
That serious?!

1162
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,917
Please, please use
Function Room for photo taking.

1163
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:08,545
Thank you for you co-operation...

1164
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:12,489
Manager Chan!

1165
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:17,487
Mr. Ma!

1166
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,298
This way...

1167
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:25,533
Mr. Ma!

1168
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:30,908
Bok Min!
Mr. Ma!

1169
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:38,681
Bok Min, we're so alike.
No reason we're not brothers.

1170
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,388
God is really not fair,
but I won't balm him.

1171
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:44,219
If I had your good background.

1172
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:48,023
I could have done as well.

1173
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:49,593
You can die for Tarzan.

1174
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:52,430
I really want to have a brother like you.

1175
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:54,295
Together we'll go...

1176
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:56,360
If anything happens at least
one can make a phone call.

1177
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:00,003
We have to act like the same person.

1178
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,398
My boss's been waiting some time.

1179
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,906
May I know...

1180
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:35,999
So polite. Inviting me to your wedding?

1181
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:37,307
Go!

1182
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,155
So many people!

1183
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,149
Bring the briefcase over here.
Bring it!

1184
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:18,241
Don't get close.

1185
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:19,342
Don't you dare.

1186
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:20,317
Bring the briefcase here.

1187
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:21,821
This is dynamite!

1188
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:25,187
Don't believe me?!
It'll explode when I throw it.

1189
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:26,624
If not, would I dared
to come here by myself?

1190
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,099
I'll go for a piss.

1191
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,866
Are the fish swimming?
Frog style or back stroke?

1192
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:58,150
Where is Tarzan?

1193
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,085
Very close to heaven!

1194
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:03,925
Help, Bok Min, help me please.

1195
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:08,161
I'm stuck to a big magnet. Help!

1196
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,794
Don't move. I'm scared.

1197
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:13,001
Are you Tarzan?

1198
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,065
Help, Bok Min...

1199
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,804
You put him up so high.
How do I know it's him?

1200
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,112
Bring him down and you'll know.

1201
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:29,314
Is it clear?

1202
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:33,192
When will Bok Min come?

1203
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:34,794
Will Ma Yau procrastinate?

1204
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:38,729
Say something to prove you're Tarzan.

1205
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:43,566
You fool, you don't close
the toilet door.

1206
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:48,175
Your fart stinks most.

1207
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,807
That's enough.

1208
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:52,140
Am I like that?

1209
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,611
Say something good about me.

1210
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:59,812
Say you shit? Really womanly.

1211
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:02,479
Bring the briefcase over here
or I'll kill him.

1212
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:14,929
Don't move!

1213
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:19,799
Boss, someone slipped in.

1214
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,842
There're two buttons.
Which one is right? Take a chance!

1215
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:26,839
Help!

1216
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,784
Haven't finished the negotiation.
Don't kill me, help!

1217
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:32,044
Play tricks on me?

1218
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:36,255
Tarzan!

1219
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:41,522
Fortune smiles on the lucky ones.

1220
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:47,526
Explosion?

1221
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:52,669
Come closer and it explodes.

1222
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:56,437
Damn you. Pulling my leg? Hit him!

1223
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:00,010
Go over there.

1224
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:02,047
Don't be mad, boss.

1225
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:03,242
It's all I've got.

1226
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:07,778
Boss, look behind you.

1227
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:15,755
None of my business.

1228
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:18,724
Go check it out. Hurry go!

1229
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:30,104
Hurry, put out the fire!

1230
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:36,313
Don't let him get away, kill him.

1231
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:52,358
Watch out for me, help!

1232
01:22:58,206 --> 01:22:59,298
It's not easy!

1233
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,299
Tarzan, you go first!

1234
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:04,708
Go up so quickly?

1235
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:06,912
Go to hell!

1236
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:09,315
You better run quickly.

1237
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:14,153
You have supernatural power?

1238
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:15,519
Come down from above already?

1239
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,352
What did you say?
What supernatural power?

1240
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,187
I can't use it, quick, move fast.

1241
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:27,564
They're up there, get him!

1242
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:37,410
He is over there, stop him!

1243
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:39,137
He's got no way to go.

1244
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:41,605
Damn you, have to take a chance!

1245
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:43,508
Hurry!
Don't run!

1246
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:49,350
Someone's coming in.

1247
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:50,680
Go up there and look.

1248
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,121
And over there.

1249
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,226
Is it over your side?
No!

1250
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:04,165
8!

1251
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:06,031
9...

1252
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:07,266
Hey, quick!

1253
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:08,874
Someone's coming in.

1254
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:13,245
Your turn!

1255
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:14,413
10!

1256
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:17,183
Seems to be someone.

1257
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:20,746
Keep going!

1258
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:25,825
Really, someone's got in.
I didn't lie. See for yourself.

1259
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:27,016
Don't believe!

1260
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:29,426
Really in here, holding a gun too.

1261
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:32,793
Don't move!...

1262
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:34,528
Get down!

1263
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:36,495
Still want to see the cards?

1264
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:41,066
Go!

1265
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,787
Tarzan? Tarzan!

1266
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:10,134
It's so hot!

1267
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:11,627
Bok...

1268
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:24,612
Close the gate!
Yes!

1269
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:40,832
Chase!

1270
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,969
Tarzan? Tarzan?

1271
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:59,417
Bok Min, I'm here,
come over quickly! Get into the car!

1272
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:00,283
What are you doing in there?

1273
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:01,820
Let's rush out together.

1274
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:04,852
The car has been blocked, can't get out!

1275
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:10,091
Look around!
Yes!

1276
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:12,827
It's so foggy that I can't see!

1277
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,834
Shut up and look for it.

1278
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:21,836
Found it?
No, can't find it!

1279
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:31,716
Excuse me, I'm sorry!

1280
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:36,321
Oh no!

1281
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:44,790
What are you doing out here?

1282
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:45,991
Got to come out!

1283
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:57,903
Don't come here!

1284
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:05,983
Are you here? Bok Min?

1285
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:12,358
Understand, come here!

1286
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:13,625
You play tricks on me?

1287
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:16,695
Hit him.

1288
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,025
Come over here!

1289
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:24,927
Hit him.

1290
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:28,741
Hit him, Bok Min, hurry!

1291
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,771
Nice shot, good posture.

1292
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:44,257
I told you to hit him,

1293
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,661
not to be hit by him.

1294
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,297
It's so hot.

1295
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:58,304
Why did you show mercy?
No!

1296
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:04,841
You aren't this useless?
I told you to hit him.

1297
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,045
Don't hit me...
Hit you?

1298
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,683
Hit yourself!

1299
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:15,821
I'm going to faint.

1300
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,049
Only you?

1301
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,117
Tarzan is in danger. Go to this rescue.

1302
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:29,997
Help!

1303
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:46,111
Go to hell!

1304
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:50,289
No...

1305
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:54,560
I never thought my kick was that good!

1306
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:57,060
Kick you to death...
Don't!

1307
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,901
Don't you dare to hit my men? Wai.

1308
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,240
Damn fool, haven't got enough?

1309
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:15,676
Great! Terrific!

1310
01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:16,806
Very hot.

1311
01:29:16,918 --> 01:29:17,816
I don't understand.

1312
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:20,615
Why did you not fight back
until he beat you up so badly?

1313
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:22,755
You're kidding.
I won't let him beat me up badly?

1314
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:26,225
OK, let me turn off the stove.
Teach him a lesson.

1315
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:38,165
Why did it go down? Oh no!

1316
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:44,868
I'm sorry, I got it wrong.

1317
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:48,147
What's wrong? It's getting lower.

1318
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:49,815
What are you doing? It's so hot.

1319
01:29:50,017 --> 01:29:53,418
Yes... it is.
I'll cool down in the other room.

1320
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:58,817
Very comfortable!

1321
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:01,885
You're here so soon.
You'd better go!

1322
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,222
This one is easy to take care of.

1323
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,597
Am I easy to take care of.

1324
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,635
You must have not tried my kicks.

1325
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:11,236
Bok Min!

1326
01:30:18,613 --> 01:30:19,511
Run!

1327
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:24,545
You're back again.

1328
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:32,815
Don't worry.
I'll take this with my kicks.

1329
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,231
This should be my turn!

1330
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:43,929
Trazan!

1331
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:48,535
Don't hit me!

1332
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:54,911
Bok Min!

1333
01:30:57,418 --> 01:30:58,510
So fast!

1334
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:07,259
Don't look! Just run fast!

1335
01:31:07,895 --> 01:31:09,089
Supernatural powers?!

1336
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:11,390
Hurry!

1337
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:20,769
Tarzan, why did you run that way?

1338
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:24,868
Not that way. It's this way. Hurry!

1339
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:31,150
Tarzan, why did you go that way;
it is this way.

1340
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,411
Hurry...

1341
01:31:33,754 --> 01:31:34,743
So fast!

1342
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:37,687
Hey, why did you come back?

1343
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:42,221
I'm going to pieces,
I don't want to play.

1344
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:44,957
Hurry!

1345
01:31:46,934 --> 01:31:49,232
Stop, don't move!

1346
01:32:16,464 --> 01:32:17,453
Scared of this too?

1347
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:31,639
Bok Min...

1348
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:33,507
Go find a place to hide.

1349
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,594
He's out!

1350
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:55,224
Get him!

1351
01:33:07,715 --> 01:33:08,704
Go to hell!

1352
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,649
I'll remember you.

1353
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:12,010
Hurry!

1354
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:13,380
Don't run!

1355
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:16,346
Bad. Where can I find a phone?

1356
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:19,891
Stupid. As I've said,
the car is the safest place.

1357
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,132
Go!

1358
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:35,602
So many people, we shall win.

1359
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,695
Over there. Hurry, chase!

1360
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:35,963
Go!

1361
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:40,704
Over there, chase!

1362
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:09,399
I'll go first.
Me too!

1363
01:35:09,503 --> 01:35:12,495
Go?
Go to hell!

1364
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:21,640
Go!

1365
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:26,280
Can fly?

1366
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:34,692
Tarzan?

1367
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,735
Go or you get killed.

1368
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,539
Bok Min, go quickly!

1369
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:57,249
Tarzan!

1370
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:02,850
Tarzan... Tarzan...

1371
01:36:03,124 --> 01:36:05,024
Speed at 100km per hour.

1372
01:36:05,126 --> 01:36:09,426
Passengers all have seat belts.
Should be OK.

1373
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:12,290
You alright?

1374
01:36:12,366 --> 01:36:15,164
I've got my seat belt on... I'm alright!

1375
01:36:17,238 --> 01:36:19,035
You, I have to fight you
to see who's better.

1376
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,867
I can't. Wai, you go and fight him.

1377
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:23,470
Wanting to kill all and spare none?

1378
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:25,537
Go!

1379
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:36,181
Take the weapon?

1380
01:36:50,771 --> 01:36:52,568
See where can you run?

1381
01:36:54,575 --> 01:36:56,065
Bok Min, where are you?

1382
01:36:58,746 --> 01:37:00,043
It's blocked, can't be opened.

1383
01:37:06,787 --> 01:37:10,484
The two, one can fight. The other can't.

1384
01:37:10,758 --> 01:37:11,747
Then, which one do you think I am?

1385
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:12,881
What'd you say?

1386
01:37:14,195 --> 01:37:15,594
The fighter.

1387
01:37:43,657 --> 01:37:45,852
Wai, he's not Bok Min;
he's the other one.

1388
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,450
Dare to fight me?

1389
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:55,729
Wai, come fight me if you've got guts.

1390
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:08,510
Dodge, dodge... dodge.

1391
01:38:23,264 --> 01:38:26,062
Power is here. Hit him...

1392
01:38:28,102 --> 01:38:30,002
Hit him... turn around and hit him hard.

1393
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:39,471
Kick... kick him.

1394
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:42,648
Not like this; wrong direction.

1395
01:38:44,184 --> 01:38:45,173
It's like this.

1396
01:38:48,889 --> 01:38:50,481
Get him when he's vulnerable.

1397
01:38:58,832 --> 01:39:00,129
Not me.

1398
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:03,964
So both can fight.

1399
01:39:10,411 --> 01:39:12,606
Hey, open the door!

1400
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,711
Can you tell me who I am?

1401
01:39:22,556 --> 01:39:24,148
You're Ma Yau. Who do you think you are?

1402
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:27,523
Me, Ma Yau. How come I can fight?

1403
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:30,193
Rubbish, open the door!

1404
01:39:35,336 --> 01:39:36,234
Where is Tarzan?

1405
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:37,359
Should be in the car.

1406
01:39:40,507 --> 01:39:41,405
Don't move!

1407
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:45,109
How come there's two?

1408
01:39:45,245 --> 01:39:46,143
Only one.

1409
01:39:46,246 --> 01:39:47,144
One?

1410
01:39:47,247 --> 01:39:48,339
You've got a blurred vision.

1411
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:49,643
Blurred vision?

1412
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,119
It's blurred vision; squat down!

1413
01:39:58,359 --> 01:40:00,054
Two persons!

1414
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:10,500
Ma Yau!

1415
01:40:13,207 --> 01:40:15,107
Where is the seat belt?

1416
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:27,920
Speed at 300kmlh
Passengers haven't got seat belts on.

1417
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:29,922
Sorry, sure to die!

1418
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:42,935
The flowers are pretty.
Thanks!

1419
01:40:47,841 --> 01:40:48,933
Where's the groom?

1420
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:51,069
Hasn't shown up so far! Ridiculous!

1421
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:53,745
I'm very anxious to meet
the man who looks like Ah Yau.

1422
01:40:53,947 --> 01:40:55,244
I hope he were our son.

1423
01:40:55,349 --> 01:40:56,748
Yes, me too.

1424
01:40:57,217 --> 01:40:59,208
But you have to be calm. Don't faint!

1425
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:00,375
I know!

1426
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:04,416
Dad and mom haven't see Bok Min.
Know where he's gone?

1427
01:41:10,831 --> 01:41:12,731
Mr. Ma, this letter is for you.

1428
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:14,762
Congratulations to both of you.

1429
01:41:14,902 --> 01:41:16,301
Thanks for the effort.

1430
01:41:16,437 --> 01:41:17,927
You take a rest. I'll go over there.

1431
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:18,868
Good...

1432
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:22,736
It's a letter from Bok Min.

1433
01:41:23,644 --> 01:41:24,736
I never thought

1434
01:41:24,812 --> 01:41:26,712
I'd have a wife and family so soon.

1435
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:30,182
This, to me, is too challenging.

1436
01:41:30,717 --> 01:41:32,309
I have decided to stall a bit.

1437
01:41:32,653 --> 01:41:35,247
I'll band over the two girls to you.
Straighten them out for me.

1438
01:41:35,689 --> 01:41:36,781
Good bye!

1439
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:42,026
Dad and mom, I think we have
to cancel the wedding.

1440
01:41:43,363 --> 01:41:44,455
Cancel?

1441
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:45,554
I have to find Bok Min.

1442
01:41:49,503 --> 01:41:50,492
Ma Yau!

1443
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:51,729
Over there.

1444
01:41:53,073 --> 01:41:56,770
Mr. Ma...
Ah Yau...

1445
01:41:59,746 --> 01:42:01,043
Where are you going?

1446
01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:03,446
You've brought man people with you.

1447
01:42:03,684 --> 01:42:06,084
Big twin, Small twin!
Don't faint!

1448
01:42:08,088 --> 01:42:10,181
Old dad, old dad!

1449
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:11,655
What to do now?

1450
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:13,191
Run, of course.

1451
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:16,259
They're gone.

1452
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:21,866
Bok Min!

1453
01:42:22,002 --> 01:42:23,799
Don't run; come over quickly.

1454
01:42:27,241 --> 01:42:29,141
Exactly the same. Identical.

1455
01:42:29,343 --> 01:42:31,937
You're Bok Min? You're Ma Yau?

1456
01:42:34,348 --> 01:42:35,838
Who is who?

1457
01:42:39,286 --> 01:42:41,186
It's you!

1458
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:47,654
What to do?

1459
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:50,753
Take anyone you like.
Good!

1460
01:42:50,931 --> 01:42:52,228
It'll do?
