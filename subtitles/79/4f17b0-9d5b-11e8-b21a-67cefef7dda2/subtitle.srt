1
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:45,019
Let's go!

2
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,556
Sir, the helicopter's
crashed in China.

3
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,600
The Chinese have
found the pilot's body..

4
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:53,670
..but, there's no
trace of Karanveer Dogra.

5
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,467
Maybe the Chinese military
have arrested him.

6
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,701
lnform the Chinese
side that it's a crash.

7
00:01:57,775 --> 00:01:59,333
Sir, the problem is..

8
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,604
..that the helicopter's
crashed into the river.

9
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:02,009
And, due to strong
rains and current..

10
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,440
..the entire wreckage
was washed away.

11
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:05,379
They didn't find anything.
- Oh my God!

12
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,917
ln that case,
it'll be hard for them to believe us.

13
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,648
And they'll think we
sent Karan in as a spy.

14
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,525
And if, they're think that..

15
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:19,624
..it's hard to imagine
how they'll treat Karan.

16
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,772
We've no interest in torturing you.

17
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:13,679
l'm not interested
in getting tortured either.

18
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:23,854
So, what was the real motive
behind your infiltration?

19
00:03:24,028 --> 00:03:27,555
Our helicopter crashed
during a routine training...

20
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:30,563
We didn't find any wreckage...

21
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:33,365
Nor did we spot any helicopter
on our radars that day.

22
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:35,462
l've told you before.

23
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,442
Our helicopter crashed
after a routine training.

24
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:43,846
Chinese government
agency has claimed, that..

25
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:46,042
..they've caught an
lndian spy infiltrating..

26
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:47,841
..at the Lapcha border.

27
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,443
Calling it a serious matter..

28
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,785
..China is going to take this
matter up at the international level.

29
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,654
Sir, Capt. Karan Veer Dogra..

30
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:57,717
..will be tried in a Chinese
court on spying charges.

31
00:03:57,795 --> 00:04:00,628
l admit.
They didn't find the wreckage.

32
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,466
We don't have any evidence.

33
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:07,698
But, sir. We've internal logs
and records, that clearly prove..

34
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:10,400
..that during a routine operation,
our chopper..

35
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:14,409
lt's not about records.

36
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:16,446
lt's about politics.

37
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:19,477
China wants to humiliate us.

38
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:22,278
They won't consider
any records as authentic.

39
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:25,720
But, sir. Their action is against
the military code of conduct..

40
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:31,524
Codes and conducts
have no place in politics.

41
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,289
Just deny that officer's existence.

42
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,791
And erase all records.

43
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,401
This should be our stand,

44
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:41,597
there was no such
man in our country..

45
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:45,073
..or officer in our army.

46
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:49,806
Do you know what Karan is, sir?

47
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,005
Karan's a commando.

48
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:56,918
The best amongst Para-commando's.

49
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,721
Do you know what a commando is?

50
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:05,927
How a common man is
turned into a commando?

51
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:11,360
Have you everjumped
from 20,500 feet..

52
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,460
..carrying 65 kilos?

53
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:16,836
A para-commando has
to do five such jumps..

54
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:18,431
..in his initial training.

55
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:21,740
And one, of them is
in the dead of the night.

56
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,543
And one, armed with the
weight of an entire battle-gear.

57
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:30,881
60 kilometers hike carrying
50 kilos of weight,

58
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:35,449
Trekking to height of 20 kilometers with the same weight.

59
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:37,687
handling 22 types of gun,

60
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:40,663
diving deep into the ocean,

61
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:44,462
this is just a routine
for a commando.

62
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:48,335
Fighting armed
men without weapons,

63
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:51,375
infiltrating enemy regions,
and eliminating them..

64
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:52,841
..in his own area.

65
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,903
ls just a day's job for a Commando.

66
00:05:57,548 --> 00:06:00,574
A commando explores
those remote areas where...

67
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,642
...even the sunrays
find it difficult to reach.

68
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,587
Poisonous snakes who are responsible for multiple
deaths...

69
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,749
..are part of a commando's diet.

70
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:11,852
A commando re-captures those
isolated areas for the country...

71
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:16,263
...where even you would
be scared to go with z+ security.

72
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:20,929
A commando is equivalent not to
thousand but ten thousand, because...

73
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,532
...out of ten thousand applicants only one qualifies as a
commando.

74
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:25,836
Only one.

75
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:28,938
And, it's not just his hard work,

76
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:34,708
the taxpayer's money,
the sweat and blood..

77
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:36,946
..of the Army's
training officers, and..

78
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:43,749
..their passion to die for their
country, all this makes a commando

79
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:46,294
Without even thinking for a second,

80
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:47,728
you're abandoning
a commando like Karan..

81
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,732
..who without even
thinking for a second..

82
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,765
..sacrifices his
life for his country,

83
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:53,736
..you're giving him up to Chinese army.

84
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:57,467
Colonel Sinha, what's more important..

85
00:06:57,608 --> 00:06:59,303
..the country or a soldier?

86
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:25,953
Our officers are giving
you one last chance..

87
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,396
..before trying you
in the Military court.

88
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:31,601
Confess that you're an lndian spy.

89
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:33,430
Why protect a country..

90
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:35,665
..that denies you're a soldier?

91
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:38,833
The government does exactly
what politics demands,

92
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:42,879
But the army doesn't teach
us politics, nor betrayal.

93
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,339
Let's not waste each other's time,

94
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,876
Let's finish what you have started.

95
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,002
Happy Diwali, son.

96
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:29,378
Should l fire?

97
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:31,507
Should l?

98
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:38,679
Go play!

99
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,940
What the.. (playing game)

100
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:06,778
Hello, Mr. Sarabjeet.

101
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,442
Can he show some respect?

102
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,577
What a shot!!

103
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:24,899
Killing the enemy in his
own territory is so much fun.

104
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:30,302
l was talking about 'Angry Bird'.

105
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,368
Bro..

106
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:37,005
Look, uncle.

107
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,616
Until yesterday, you were in power.

108
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:43,585
But today,
the five administrators of Dilerkot..

109
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:45,781
..are under my control.

110
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:51,795
l'll have no problem in getting
Elected to Parliament.

111
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:54,455
Before we start campaigning..

112
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:58,735
..l want you to get
Simrit and me married.

113
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,802
That will put an end to
this family feud, bloodshed..

114
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:05,398
Get out of here.

115
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:09,306
Or it will start all over again.

116
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:11,904
SP sir..
- Kairon Sir.

117
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:15,047
Your men will die in this bloodshed.

118
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:16,650
You know it well.

119
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:19,852
And, l won't lodge a police report either.

120
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:22,450
Taking action
is out of the question.

121
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:23,819
Father.

122
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:36,570
When l saw the cars outside..

123
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,938
..l knew l was in
for a free horror show.

124
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:42,903
See. The devil in 3D.

125
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:45,740
Father, who allowed his cars inside?

126
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:48,307
No one dare stop me.

127
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:49,409
Right!

128
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:52,754
And, as far as the
cars are concerned.

129
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,383
Consider them yours.

130
00:13:57,361 --> 00:13:58,589
Hello.

131
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:01,392
He's crossed all limits, right?

132
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,759
Who wouldn't fall in
love with this attitude MP!

133
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:13,833
You had an objection to me staring at you.

134
00:14:14,745 --> 00:14:16,372
So, with due respect..

135
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:20,344
..l've proposed to
your father to marry you.

136
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:23,519
Simrit. Go inside.

137
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,284
Father. You know l
won't sacrifice my life..

138
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:29,882
..like dutiful daughters-in-law.

139
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,518
Right, sister Simrit we're..
- Shut up!

140
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:38,901
You weigh just 20 kilos,
with the clothes.

141
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:42,336
l wouldn't mind shooting you.

142
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,038
The bullet will pierce
through your body.

143
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,002
l can wipe it and use it again.

144
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,805
Father, ask him to shut up
else my shoe will do the talking

145
00:14:53,884 --> 00:14:55,818
Simrit. Go inside.

146
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,947
You'll do as l say.

147
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:21,808
Fine, uncle.

148
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:23,910
l'll take your leave.

149
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:33,047
l can abduct Simrit as well.

150
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,985
But l respect you.

151
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:41,422
So, l expect the same in return.

152
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,413
What now, Simrit?

153
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:02,016
What do you think your
father's answer will be?

154
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,752
Father will have to
think about everyone, Priti.

155
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,720
l think l'll have to
take matters in my hand now.

156
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,419
But, Simrit, everyone
in my family's scared of him.

157
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:12,860
They say he's always
true to his words.

158
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,924
lf he's dangerous, l'm Simrit Kaur.

159
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:19,799
l'm no scapegoat
to take it lying down.

160
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:33,847
l'll go call father.

161
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:35,851
What do you think?

162
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:39,021
Won't AK know that you're
planning to run away?

163
00:21:39,322 --> 00:21:43,850
l can't spend my entire life
as a vote-bank for AK.

164
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:48,627
l am not an animal
who can be tied to a hook.

165
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,490
l will break away.

166
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:53,733
l will runaway.

167
00:22:47,424 --> 00:22:50,325
Come on! Come. Let's go back.

168
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:52,961
Come on. Follow her.

169
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:57,993
That way.

170
00:22:58,435 --> 00:22:59,732
That way.

171
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,411
Hey! You go that way.

172
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,606
Come.

173
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,953
There she is.

174
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:44,641
We've found our sister-in-law.

175
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,318
lt's her.

176
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:02,691
Greet her.

177
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:04,358
Hello, sister-in-law.

178
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:07,432
Sister-in-law,
do you need a lift back home?

179
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:09,305
What are you doing?

180
00:24:09,372 --> 00:24:10,669
Don't be stubborn.

181
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:17,002
She's already playing
games with her brother-in-law.

182
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:20,441
Come on, let's play hide and seek!

183
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,684
There she is.

184
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,446
Where are you going, sister-in-law?.

185
00:24:27,524 --> 00:24:28,889
Stop.

186
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:30,792
Stop.

187
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,691
Where are you going?
- You'll get tired.

188
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,362
Stop. Sister-in-law. Stop.

189
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,734
Sister-in-law. Stop.

190
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:40,997
You'll get tired.

191
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,867
At least hand us your bag.

192
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,635
Where are you going?
Sister-in-law.

193
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:48,466
Where are you going?

194
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,007
Save me please.

195
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,406
Sister-in-law.

196
00:25:01,858 --> 00:25:03,792
Sister-in-law, l'm no villain.

197
00:25:05,762 --> 00:25:07,730
Hey, silent Hero!

198
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:09,728
You bumped into her by accident.

199
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,831
Apologise and leave.

200
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,259
Get lost.

201
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:16,599
l don't know you.

202
00:25:17,574 --> 00:25:18,871
Neither her.

203
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,808
l've no interest in saving her.

204
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:26,943
And, l've nothing to
lose in breaking your bones.

205
00:25:27,016 --> 00:25:29,985
We're warning you only
because you don't know us.

206
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:32,578
We rule Dilerkot.

207
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:35,522
We're the most powerful
politician here.

208
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:36,752
Politicians!

209
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:39,952
Then you'll certainly
end up with broken bones.

210
00:25:41,497 --> 00:25:43,488
Now, you've made this my war.

211
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:44,997
l see. How?.

212
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:46,968
A year's anger.

213
00:25:47,904 --> 00:25:49,804
You gave me a chance to express it.

214
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:52,931
We won't run.

215
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:56,902
We'll fight.

216
00:25:58,448 --> 00:26:00,313
Beat him!

217
00:26:21,938 --> 00:26:23,428
Charge!

218
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:17,921
Come on. Let's go!

219
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,382
Hey, stop!

220
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:07,996
l'll show you!

221
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:31,557
(Crowd in background murmuring.)

222
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,273
We won't spare you!

223
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:49,608
Don't even try.

224
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,539
You'll live longer.

225
00:29:54,817 --> 00:29:55,943
Wait and watch.

226
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:18,005
Hey! Hello. Hello.

227
00:30:18,074 --> 00:30:19,371
You just made a mess.

228
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,875
Added to my troubles.

229
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:23,411
You're welcome. - Welcome?

230
00:30:23,746 --> 00:30:25,304
O Bruce Lee's relative!

231
00:30:25,381 --> 00:30:27,781
Don't think you're a
hero by beating up 20 men.

232
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,045
There'll be another
200 here in 20 minutes.

233
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,513
l would've begged,
pleaded and slipped away.

234
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:36,553
But you messed up my entire plan.

235
00:30:36,826 --> 00:30:38,794
Come on. Come with me.

236
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:39,828
Come.

237
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,798
You think l need to run.

238
00:30:42,865 --> 00:30:46,631
Not someone as stupid as you,
but l do. Ok!

239
00:30:46,702 --> 00:30:47,691
All because of you, now..

240
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,704
..ln no time there will
be 200 men here to stop me.

241
00:30:49,872 --> 00:30:51,396
And it's all your fault.

242
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:53,872
As long as l don't
get rid of these goons..

243
00:30:53,943 --> 00:30:56,343
..and cross the border of Dilerkot..

244
00:30:56,412 --> 00:30:58,004
..l won't let you go either!

245
00:30:58,514 --> 00:30:59,446
Come on.

246
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,390
Stop! Listen to this joke.
lt's a nice one.

247
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:11,890
Pat to Mike..

248
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:14,395
''Your dog looks just like a lion.''

249
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,429
''What do you feed him?''

250
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,365
Mike replies,
''He's actually a lion.''

251
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:19,627
''But looks like a dog because..''

252
00:31:19,702 --> 00:31:21,727
''..he has been screwing
a lot of bitches nowadays.''

253
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:35,817
Please, God. Please.

254
00:31:35,885 --> 00:31:37,318
We're already in deep trouble.

255
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:38,614
Please don't test us anymore.

256
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,553
Please let us cross Dilerkot.

257
00:31:40,623 --> 00:31:41,681
Please!

258
00:31:41,757 --> 00:31:44,089
Please let me escape the
clutches of that AK.

259
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:44,883
Please!

260
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:55,400
Say something, MP. Or you'll burst.

261
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:59,369
He shouldn't cross
the border of Dilerkot.

262
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:03,810
lf you're so angry, you should've
Stopped him then and there.

263
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,947
Why come running home to me?

264
00:32:06,015 --> 00:32:08,006
''Bro! Bro!''

265
00:32:11,654 --> 00:32:15,420
Please, please, Lord. Please.

266
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:20,384
MP. See, another good joke.
Listen to this.

267
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,689
Bro, this is no time
for cracking jokes.

268
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:23,527
Time!

269
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:27,029
You aren't dead
yet why can't l crack jokes?

270
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:33,937
When and where we
need to catch them..

271
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,342
..the time and place
is all decided, here.

272
00:32:36,846 --> 00:32:38,438
Don't worry, listen to this joke.

273
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,425
We've crossed Dilerkot.

274
00:32:53,496 --> 00:32:54,929
Finally!!

275
00:32:55,531 --> 00:32:57,499
We've crossed Dilerkot.

276
00:33:02,305 --> 00:33:03,329
God!

277
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:08,702
Sorry. l dragged you
along at the bus stand..

278
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,268
..because l was scared.

279
00:33:11,747 --> 00:33:13,271
By the way, where are you headed?

280
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,418
Pathankot.

281
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:17,884
Pathankot!

282
00:33:17,953 --> 00:33:21,389
This bus is headed that way.

283
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:28,488
By the way, l'm heading for Simla.

284
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,068
Thank you.

285
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,711
l was seriously scared
back at the bus stand..

286
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:47,678
..that's why l said those
things instead of thanking you.

287
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:50,950
Want to know a secret?

288
00:33:51,554 --> 00:33:54,079
Actually, l'm still a bit scared.

289
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:56,587
That's why l'm blabbering.

290
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,355
Otherwise,
l don't talk so much normally.

291
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:03,598
Like they say,
conversation helps divert your mind.

292
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,896
You should try.

293
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:20,638
Silent man.
Tell me something about yourself.

294
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:22,718
Why?

295
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:28,519
l am no fool to
blabber like this.

296
00:34:28,824 --> 00:34:31,292
Don't you talk without a reason?

297
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,554
And you talk only without a reason.

298
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:38,526
Wow! You knock people
out with that blunt face.

299
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:41,597
People iron their clothes.

300
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:44,735
But you've an ironed face!

301
00:35:15,938 --> 00:35:17,872
Brother! We've found our sister-in-law.

302
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:35,017
Come on.

303
00:35:50,372 --> 00:35:54,706
l told them... that
he can't be a local.

304
00:35:56,912 --> 00:36:01,281
The problem is, after this
you'll be good-for-nothing.

305
00:36:19,602 --> 00:36:24,938
So...if you've any jokes,
or one-liners..

306
00:36:25,508 --> 00:36:27,567
..you'd like tell us,
you can do that now.

307
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:31,936
Afterwards,
the bullets will do the talking...

308
00:36:32,948 --> 00:36:37,385
Your men, your weapons, your place.

309
00:36:38,354 --> 00:36:39,844
So, you can crack
all the jokes you want.

310
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:45,023
See, Simrit.

311
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:48,363
Your bodyguard has
already surrendered.

312
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:53,398
Now, l'm your only hope.

313
00:36:53,636 --> 00:36:55,433
You can't be anyone's hope.

314
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:59,402
You can only make people hate you,
not love.

315
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:02,240
God must have replaced you..

316
00:37:02,311 --> 00:37:05,280
..with 100 bastards on earth.

317
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:19,389
When you'll step out after our wedding night..

318
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:24,322
..you'll be swearing
on my name in entire Dilerkot.

319
00:37:25,568 --> 00:37:26,728
l swear on AK....

320
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:28,736
l swear on AK... l swear on AK...

321
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:29,964
AK... AK...

322
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:39,512
Don't let him go!

323
00:37:40,282 --> 00:37:42,045
No.. no..no!!

324
00:38:13,616 --> 00:38:15,015
Why were you laughing?
- No. no.

325
00:38:15,317 --> 00:38:16,249
Come out.

326
00:38:16,485 --> 00:38:17,850
No, brother, l didn't..

327
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,580
No.. - He was laughing..
- No, brother.

328
00:38:20,723 --> 00:38:23,248
You think it's funny. - No. Not me..

329
00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:24,553
l wasn't laughing.

330
00:38:24,627 --> 00:38:25,559
Tell me.

331
00:38:27,997 --> 00:38:29,589
What was funny?

332
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:32,633
He just ran away after hitting me..

333
00:38:32,868 --> 00:38:35,029
He didn't face me.

334
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:36,961
..that does not make him brave.

335
00:38:38,507 --> 00:38:41,442
He's invited his
death by provoking me.

336
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,640
Shut up!

337
00:38:46,548 --> 00:38:48,277
Stop wailing like a woman!

338
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:53,888
Everyone who's heading
out of Dilerkot..

339
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:58,450
..be back in a day and watch the fun.

340
00:38:59,862 --> 00:39:01,830
l'll tie a belt around his neck..

341
00:39:01,897 --> 00:39:04,559
..and drag him to Dilerkot square.

342
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,492
And kill him there.

343
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:10,062
Just one day.

344
00:39:42,705 --> 00:39:44,263
Who was that man on the bridge?

345
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,772
lt's difficult to defeat
the enemy without knowing him.

346
00:39:59,988 --> 00:40:01,683
Amrit Kawal Singh.

347
00:40:16,905 --> 00:40:19,373
He was born on a no-moon-night.

348
00:40:22,478 --> 00:40:25,003
His father was a tyrant.

349
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:28,607
And so, people called him a devil's..

350
00:40:28,684 --> 00:40:30,049
..born to a devil.

351
00:40:32,354 --> 00:40:34,015
He has no eyeballs.

352
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,820
Yet, he can see.

353
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,021
He was born in 1974.

354
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:43,625
So he calls himself AK 74.

355
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:48,629
lf some unfortunate
soul tries to challenge..

356
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:50,898
..he can't stand
up to him for too long.

357
00:40:52,007 --> 00:40:55,602
Just a week ago,
the District Forest Officer..

358
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:58,779
DFO sir, l just received
a nice one on the jungle.

359
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:00,109
Listen to it before you go.

360
00:41:00,649 --> 00:41:02,412
An elephant was
bathing in the jungle.

361
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,345
A mouse came along
and said ''Come out''.

362
00:41:05,487 --> 00:41:06,647
The elephant replied ''What is it?''

363
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:08,053
''Come out!''

364
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:10,047
The elephant came
out in a fit of rage.

365
00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:11,756
He said ''What is it?''

366
00:41:11,994 --> 00:41:13,586
The mouse said ''Nothing, go back in''.

367
00:41:13,662 --> 00:41:15,289
''Tell me what's wrong?''

368
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,863
''l said go inside!''

369
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,059
''l just wanted to
see if you are wearing..''

370
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:25,903
''..my underwear.''

371
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:30,905
Oh ho DFO sir.
You should've heard the last line.

372
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:32,846
Would've gone with a smile.

373
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:37,477
His family knew that it's a murder,
not an accident.

374
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:41,788
But, no one dares to
face that bastard.

375
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:46,025
Those who could..

376
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:51,994
..are now addicted
to drugs sold by him.

377
00:41:54,102 --> 00:41:56,764
Get them addicted
while they're in school..

378
00:41:56,839 --> 00:41:59,535
..and they fall prey to
it by the time they're young.

379
00:41:59,675 --> 00:42:02,701
That was his master-plan
to rule over Dilerkot.

380
00:42:02,778 --> 00:42:04,678
Anti-allergic medicines, cough syrup.

381
00:42:04,746 --> 00:42:08,648
These boys get high
on animal medicines as well.

382
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:13,345
This guy owns all retail
and distribution of medicines.

383
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:15,283
Whenever a drug
license is cancelled..

384
00:42:15,357 --> 00:42:17,291
..the next day, he gets it out.

385
00:42:17,526 --> 00:42:20,962
He controls the entire system,
so no one challenges him. .

386
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:23,657
But you did.

387
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:28,601
His strength is not his money,
but the fear in people.

388
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,900
He didn't scare you, nor me.

389
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,070
He and his men will come after us..

390
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,436
..to maintain his
fear amongst people.

391
00:42:36,778 --> 00:42:37,904
After us?

392
00:42:39,448 --> 00:42:42,440
My family's used
to challenging these guys.

393
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:45,679
But, what's your story?

394
00:42:47,055 --> 00:42:48,818
l was locked away for a year.

395
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,918
The jail l was in, was really filthy.

396
00:42:52,661 --> 00:42:54,390
They wouldn't let me clean it.

397
00:42:54,596 --> 00:42:56,359
That day l realized,

398
00:42:56,798 --> 00:43:00,325
that the filth in my country
has landed me in this mess.

399
00:43:01,703 --> 00:43:03,864
lf scum like AK aren't cleaned up..

400
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,466
..then someday he'll
be in the same position as a politician..

401
00:43:06,775 --> 00:43:08,936
..that back then led me in that mess.

402
00:43:09,745 --> 00:43:11,975
That's when l decided in that jail,

403
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:17,576
The war outside comes later, first l
need to clean-up the mess inside.

404
00:43:18,987 --> 00:43:22,013
l'll start here, and finish there.

405
00:43:31,934 --> 00:43:33,731
We're here,
and the bridge is back there.

406
00:43:34,469 --> 00:43:36,300
We'll walk through the jungle,
parallel to the bridge.

407
00:43:36,738 --> 00:43:39,070
They won't dare to
come on the highway.

408
00:43:41,376 --> 00:43:43,435
They'll walk through the jungle.

409
00:43:43,612 --> 00:43:44,806
We'll walk through the jungle..

410
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,677
..2-3 kilometers
parallel to the highway..

411
00:43:46,748 --> 00:43:48,978
We'll go on the highway
only when it'll look safe.

412
00:43:49,384 --> 00:43:52,785
They've two options MP,
both are dangerous.

413
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:57,316
One leads to me, the other
leads them inside the jungle.

414
00:43:57,392 --> 00:43:59,952
Right now,
that bastard AK..

415
00:44:00,028 --> 00:44:02,292
..seems more dangerous
than this jungle.

416
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:05,390
There's no point in
choosing the jungle route.

417
00:44:06,368 --> 00:44:09,565
ln fact, it'll give
us the feeling of a hunt.

418
00:44:30,892 --> 00:44:33,690
You could've just shown
your muscles if you wanted to.

419
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:36,822
Why tear your clothes
as an excuse?

420
00:44:37,766 --> 00:44:39,324
Shoes leave a track.

421
00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:42,496
And those who leave a track behind..

422
00:44:42,704 --> 00:44:44,865
..often end up dead.

423
00:44:55,784 --> 00:44:56,648
Sir!

424
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,016
Sir!

425
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,814
The hunt's on.

426
00:45:04,526 --> 00:45:06,460
Yes, sir. - But don't kill him.

427
00:45:06,695 --> 00:45:08,492
l want him alive. - Yes.

428
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:13,696
Then, l want to tie him up,
drag him to Dilerkot square..

429
00:45:13,769 --> 00:45:15,293
..and kill him there.

430
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:17,597
Right sir!

431
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:19,672
ln everyone's presence.

432
00:45:56,478 --> 00:45:58,446
Stop! Stop!

433
00:46:00,082 --> 00:46:01,572
Stop!

434
00:46:02,918 --> 00:46:04,317
l'm just holding your hands,

435
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,513
don't expect me
to grow wings and fly.

436
00:46:07,956 --> 00:46:08,945
Let's go right.

437
00:46:09,024 --> 00:46:09,991
Right?

438
00:46:10,325 --> 00:46:11,758
Do you have eyes or compass?

439
00:46:14,496 --> 00:46:17,397
How do you know where to go?

440
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:19,830
Can you hear a voice from above?

441
00:46:20,769 --> 00:46:22,964
Rises from the east,
sets in the west.

442
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:24,999
See your position..

443
00:46:25,373 --> 00:46:26,499
..match with the sun's position.

444
00:46:26,908 --> 00:46:29,468
You'll know where you are,
and where you're headed.

445
00:46:29,644 --> 00:46:30,633
Wow!

446
00:46:30,712 --> 00:46:32,373
Thank God! We didn't
jump off at night.

447
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,812
Otherwise we would've
been in trouble.

448
00:46:33,882 --> 00:46:36,407
The stars lead the way at night.
- Nonsense.

449
00:46:36,518 --> 00:46:37,746
Liar.

450
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:39,548
Do the stars speak?

451
00:46:40,055 --> 00:46:41,545
This isn't the time to explain.

452
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,584
Let's go!

453
00:46:59,007 --> 00:47:00,634
He can be headed in any direction.

454
00:47:03,478 --> 00:47:04,775
We came that way.

455
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:06,641
That leaves three.

456
00:47:08,683 --> 00:47:11,345
Let's divide in three
groups and catch him.

457
00:47:11,419 --> 00:47:12,818
But don't shoot him!

458
00:47:13,655 --> 00:47:16,556
l've told everybody that l will catch him alive.

459
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,489
Get that.

460
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:18,651
Right, sir.

461
00:47:18,727 --> 00:47:19,716
Let's go.

462
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:20,885
Just a minute.

463
00:47:23,598 --> 00:47:25,896
lt's a nice one.
Listen before you go. - Yes.

464
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:27,867
lt will help boost your morale.

465
00:47:27,936 --> 00:47:29,528
Mike's wife was kidnapped.

466
00:47:29,604 --> 00:47:31,504
The kidnapper cut-off
his wife's finger..

467
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:33,302
..and sent it to Mike's
home as evidence..

468
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,637
..along with a letter for ransom.

469
00:47:34,843 --> 00:47:39,780
Mike said ''This can
be anybody's finger''.

470
00:47:40,715 --> 00:47:42,410
''Send me her head,
so l can recognize her.''

471
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,846
Let's go.

472
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:48,583
Let's go.

473
00:47:55,797 --> 00:47:58,357
Sir, few people have
sited him at Nurpur.

474
00:48:00,702 --> 00:48:02,363
There's just one place left between..

475
00:48:02,437 --> 00:48:04,302
..Pathankot and Nurpur.

476
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,599
Dilerkot.

477
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:55,622
Don't scream!
- Snake bit me. - Quiet. Quiet!

478
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,357
You screamed for no reason.

479
00:48:57,525 --> 00:48:59,584
l'm dying here,
and you're yelling at me.

480
00:48:59,661 --> 00:49:01,253
Suck my blood out, quickly.

481
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:03,297
lt's a trinket snake.
lt's commonly found in these areas.

482
00:49:03,365 --> 00:49:04,525
They are not poisonous.

483
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,497
There they are. Let's go this way.

484
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,335
Don't kill him.
We've to catch him alive.

485
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,704
Let's go quickly. Come on.

486
00:53:20,054 --> 00:53:21,316
No. Let me go.

487
00:53:54,389 --> 00:53:55,754
lt's the law of the jungle..

488
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:59,021
Kill or get killed.

489
00:54:13,408 --> 00:54:14,534
Say something Balvinder.

490
00:54:14,776 --> 00:54:15,765
Did you find him?

491
00:54:16,311 --> 00:54:17,437
Where are you?

492
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,512
Balvinder,
we're taking the mountain route.

493
00:54:21,649 --> 00:54:23,742
Meet us at the post
and riverjunction.

494
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,883
Let me speak to AK 74.

495
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:28,853
Look, handover the girl..
- Just do as l say.

496
00:54:28,957 --> 00:54:30,424
Let me speak to AK 74.

497
00:54:30,491 --> 00:54:31,924
l think it's him..

498
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,725
Look. You don't..

499
00:54:33,795 --> 00:54:38,698
Know me! The smallest of idiots in
lndia keep saying this dialogue.

500
00:54:39,467 --> 00:54:41,025
But, l know you.

501
00:54:41,502 --> 00:54:43,629
Because l can guess one's type..

502
00:54:43,705 --> 00:54:45,696
..and one's stature from
their speech and actions.

503
00:54:46,307 --> 00:54:47,672
You're just a local thug..

504
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,905
..but, people like you gather
votes and become a lion in..

505
00:54:50,979 --> 00:54:52,537
..a herd of cowards.

506
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:54,805
You really don't know me.

507
00:54:55,984 --> 00:54:58,009
Actually, you are not in front of me.

508
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,316
You couldn't say
a word on the bridge.

509
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,782
Because, l know the difference..

510
00:55:01,856 --> 00:55:03,380
..between bravery and foolishness.

511
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:04,683
You don't.

512
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,450
Follow me,
and your people will end up dead..

513
00:55:07,528 --> 00:55:10,019
..and an illiterate like
you won't even know how to count.

514
00:55:10,398 --> 00:55:11,456
What do you think?

515
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:13,561
We cannot find you.

516
00:55:13,635 --> 00:55:15,500
Didn't you hear what l said?

517
00:55:15,803 --> 00:55:19,830
lf you don't go back,
l will find you and kill you.

518
00:55:23,745 --> 00:55:25,838
You really crack me up.

519
00:55:28,883 --> 00:55:30,714
The more stubborn a person...

520
00:55:30,852 --> 00:55:33,616
.. is the more l enjoy killing you.

521
00:55:33,755 --> 00:55:35,985
l warn only once.

522
00:55:36,357 --> 00:55:37,517
Listen carefully.

523
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:39,420
Stop following this girl.

524
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,492
Take these corpses home.

525
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:44,730
lf you want more,
you can come after me in the jungle.

526
00:56:22,704 --> 00:56:23,568
Which way did they go?

527
00:56:23,638 --> 00:56:24,570
l don't know.

528
00:56:34,048 --> 00:56:35,572
We cannot handle him alone.

529
00:56:36,584 --> 00:56:38,518
Doesn't seem like a human being.

530
00:56:40,354 --> 00:56:41,446
He's trained.

531
00:56:41,823 --> 00:56:44,348
And his biggest advantage is,
he knows the jungle.

532
00:56:44,759 --> 00:56:46,420
We'll need more men.

533
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:48,853
We'll return in the morning
with proper preparations.

534
00:56:49,297 --> 00:56:51,891
Let's head back with
the corpses for now.

535
00:56:51,966 --> 00:56:54,867
l've made a promise
catching that rascal alive.

536
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:57,765
Atleast one l have to..

537
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:03,877
Get up!

538
00:57:10,585 --> 00:57:13,782
Where were you when
he was abusing me?

539
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,913
l was lying unconscious.

540
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,251
lf you are living on my money,

541
00:57:21,496 --> 00:57:26,365
You listen to someone abuse me,
only when dead.

542
00:57:27,468 --> 00:57:29,561
Not while lying unconscious.

543
00:57:31,873 --> 00:57:33,431
Don't go back to Dilerkot.

544
00:57:34,509 --> 00:57:35,942
Let's wait at Atla Forest post.

545
00:57:36,611 --> 00:57:39,375
l'll inform the other team
over the wireless to come there.

546
00:57:39,447 --> 00:57:43,349
More men,
poachers, trackers and hunter dogs.

547
00:57:43,551 --> 00:57:44,916
Let's gather all of them around.

548
00:57:45,052 --> 00:57:46,679
And, at the break of dawn..

549
00:57:46,854 --> 00:57:48,913
..we will hunt the guy down.

550
00:58:34,936 --> 00:58:36,767
We'll halt here at night.

551
00:58:37,605 --> 00:58:38,697
A little further.

552
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,731
Animals come here
to drink water at dawn.

553
00:59:36,597 --> 00:59:39,623
You won't find a
better insect repellent.

554
00:59:57,451 --> 00:59:59,476
This will keep you warm.

555
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:14,266
Who are you?

556
01:05:17,671 --> 01:05:18,695
Commando..

557
01:05:20,274 --> 01:05:21,832
l mean... l was..

558
01:05:22,776 --> 01:05:23,902
Or still am..

559
01:05:24,878 --> 01:05:25,867
Don't know.

560
01:06:00,381 --> 01:06:02,508
So, bodyguard.

561
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,778
Go on.

562
01:06:08,455 --> 01:06:10,423
Last evening you threatened me.

563
01:06:10,491 --> 01:06:12,686
This morning l'm in the mood.

564
01:06:14,795 --> 01:06:18,697
Better surrender wherever you are.

565
01:06:18,932 --> 01:06:22,868
Otherwise, you will be hanging
at Dilerkot square in the evening.

566
01:06:23,537 --> 01:06:25,368
Stay wherever you are.

567
01:06:25,873 --> 01:06:29,775
lf you try to follow me,
l'll bury you alive.

568
01:06:31,879 --> 01:06:33,540
l'm scared.

569
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:35,676
Listen. Listen.

570
01:06:35,849 --> 01:06:37,510
This is a nice one. Hear it.

571
01:06:38,052 --> 01:06:42,421
What did Mike say in Pat's ear,
that he died after hearing?

572
01:06:43,324 --> 01:06:45,815
l'll give you the answer before..

573
01:06:45,893 --> 01:06:47,884
..beheading you this evening.

574
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:49,960
You're so lucky.

575
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:51,861
You'll die with a smile.

576
01:06:52,866 --> 01:06:54,800
You make me laugh.

577
01:06:55,569 --> 01:06:56,433
Listen.

578
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:58,797
No more talk, the game begins.

579
01:06:58,972 --> 01:07:00,997
The game's already begun.

580
01:07:01,709 --> 01:07:04,007
l'm coming after
you with hunter dogs.

581
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,906
You either step out with men or dogs,

582
01:07:08,916 --> 01:07:10,349
step out alone sometime..

583
01:07:10,784 --> 01:07:12,718
..to get the feeling of being a man.

584
01:07:13,987 --> 01:07:15,454
Wait until evening.

585
01:07:15,689 --> 01:07:17,452
You'll know who the real man is.

586
01:07:18,959 --> 01:07:21,757
Fine. This evening l'll
clear your misconception..

587
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,490
..that you're a man.

588
01:08:18,048 --> 01:08:19,208
These many men are enough.

589
01:08:19,282 --> 01:08:20,681
Yes.

590
01:08:20,717 --> 01:08:21,649
l'll beat him unconscious..

591
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:24,415
..and bring him
back tied on a bamboo.

592
01:08:46,242 --> 01:08:47,300
Politician?

593
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:49,178
Then, l'll surely beat you up.

594
01:08:55,752 --> 01:08:56,741
Look.

595
01:08:57,087 --> 01:08:58,918
This is my last warning.

596
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:01,657
Stop following this girl.

597
01:09:45,702 --> 01:09:46,293
What?

598
01:09:49,305 --> 01:09:51,239
You didn't think that was funny?

599
01:09:52,742 --> 01:09:54,334
Oh, l forgot.

600
01:09:54,744 --> 01:09:55,802
You never laugh.

601
01:09:56,012 --> 01:09:58,810
You just carry this
stone face all the time.

602
01:09:59,149 --> 01:09:59,877
Right.

603
01:09:59,949 --> 01:10:01,348
There's nothing funny about it.

604
01:10:02,051 --> 01:10:02,881
lt's a good thing.

605
01:10:02,952 --> 01:10:05,182
You have taken up the responsibility
of defending yourself.

606
01:10:05,655 --> 01:10:06,212
Good.

607
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:09,149
Let's go. They're coming after us.

608
01:10:10,727 --> 01:10:12,752
'They're coming after us.'

609
01:10:13,963 --> 01:10:17,990
As long as you're with me,
l don't have to worry.

610
01:10:18,334 --> 01:10:21,963
You get so eager when
you see those thugs.

611
01:10:22,372 --> 01:10:25,205
You clean their clock.

612
01:10:25,842 --> 01:10:27,867
There won't be any left for me.

613
01:10:29,212 --> 01:10:31,237
l just thought it's a good habit..

614
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:33,214
..to exercise in the morning.

615
01:10:35,351 --> 01:10:38,115
Really, who am l trying
to educate about exercising.

616
01:10:39,756 --> 01:10:43,248
You're a live example
of benefits of exercising.

617
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,754
l meant example in a good sense, okay.

618
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:49,655
Wow! Till yesterday you were scared.

619
01:10:49,732 --> 01:10:51,393
But this morning,
you've turned brave.

620
01:10:52,035 --> 01:10:55,163
With you around, fear's mother or
sister will not dare come near me!

621
01:11:01,945 --> 01:11:03,003
What's that?

622
01:11:05,715 --> 01:11:06,739
lt's a knife.

623
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:09,177
How about l teach you how to use it?
- No.

624
01:11:09,252 --> 01:11:10,150
lt can be useful.

625
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,754
Like this. Drive it in the stomach.

626
01:11:12,956 --> 01:11:14,253
And, if you can't lift it..

627
01:11:14,724 --> 01:11:17,215
..then, just place it
on this nerve on the neck.

628
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:18,649
On the jugular.

629
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:21,027
After that, no one can get up!

630
01:11:21,097 --> 01:11:21,995
Nonsense.

631
01:11:22,065 --> 01:11:23,362
Do l look like a fool?

632
01:11:23,633 --> 01:11:25,658
l've no interest in
acting like a warrior?

633
01:11:25,735 --> 01:11:27,225
lf you can't use a knife..

634
01:11:27,303 --> 01:11:29,669
..then, just twist
the finger like this.

635
01:11:30,139 --> 01:11:32,198
That pain's as bad
as breaking the neck.

636
01:11:32,876 --> 01:11:33,900
He won't be able to fight you.

637
01:11:33,977 --> 01:11:34,966
Or these two fingers.

638
01:11:35,044 --> 01:11:37,239
Thrust them in the nose
and just pull hard.

639
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:39,178
The pain's unbearable.

640
01:11:39,315 --> 01:11:42,375
Yuck! l don't want to do all this.

641
01:11:45,288 --> 01:11:46,380
Don't just carry it.

642
01:11:47,156 --> 01:11:48,885
Use it if needed.

643
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:56,858
l met so many guys who
wanted to look after me.

644
01:11:58,167 --> 01:12:00,158
But you're the first
one who believed..

645
01:12:00,637 --> 01:12:02,662
..l can take care of myself.

646
01:12:09,078 --> 01:12:11,205
Come on, l'm hungry.

647
01:12:12,649 --> 01:12:14,844
Anyway, there's not much difference..

648
01:12:14,951 --> 01:12:16,851
..between you and the
animals on Discovery Channel.

649
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,286
Both can live on air and termites!

650
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:22,257
Your man Karanveer Dogra..

651
01:12:22,692 --> 01:12:24,626
..is behaving like a Chinese agent.

652
01:12:24,861 --> 01:12:27,261
He injured a few men
at Dilerkot bus stand.

653
01:12:27,697 --> 01:12:29,392
Killed a man at Andheria bridge,

654
01:12:30,066 --> 01:12:32,125
kidnapped a girl and
fled into the jungle.

655
01:12:32,235 --> 01:12:34,066
Before he does anything else..

656
01:12:34,203 --> 01:12:35,966
penetrate the jungle, and kill him.

657
01:12:36,105 --> 01:12:38,335
Without a military
court inquiry, sir?

658
01:12:38,741 --> 01:12:40,936
l've made all the inquiries.

659
01:12:41,711 --> 01:12:43,645
Carry out my orders immediately.

660
01:12:43,913 --> 01:12:46,279
Otherwise, l can send any army unit.

661
01:12:46,816 --> 01:12:49,910
Colonel Sinha, capture and kill him.

662
01:13:06,369 --> 01:13:07,063
Hello.

663
01:13:17,313 --> 01:13:19,781
Where are you going?
- l've some work to do.

664
01:13:19,983 --> 01:13:22,611
l'm going to miss you.
- No. l promise you won't.

665
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:48,367
Yes.

666
01:13:48,411 --> 01:13:51,938
The man you ran into trouble
with yesterday is a soldier.

667
01:13:52,115 --> 01:13:54,083
And his unit's looking for him.

668
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:56,284
So, show them around Dilerkot.

669
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:57,981
Pretend you're searching for him.

670
01:13:59,055 --> 01:14:01,717
And, bring them to Dilerkot
square in the evening.

671
01:14:02,658 --> 01:14:05,320
They'll find his dead body.

672
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:17,131
Wow! Not bad Silent Man!

673
01:14:17,974 --> 01:14:21,205
One thing is for sure,
with brawns you even have brains!

674
01:14:21,711 --> 01:14:22,973
One more thing.

675
01:14:23,379 --> 01:14:24,368
Give me your address..

676
01:14:24,647 --> 01:14:25,944
..before you leave for Pathankot.

677
01:14:26,015 --> 01:14:28,108
l'll have girls drooling over you.

678
01:14:53,643 --> 01:14:54,302
What happened?

679
01:14:55,178 --> 01:14:56,110
Nothing.

680
01:14:57,413 --> 01:14:58,607
There's something.

681
01:14:59,949 --> 01:15:02,315
Otherwise,
you wouldn't have noticed me..

682
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:07,249
..even if l was undressing
under the waterfall.

683
01:15:07,723 --> 01:15:09,247
So, come on. What is it?

684
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:16,031
That's how wild
cats eat fish as well.

685
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:21,595
You know a lot about wild cats.

686
01:15:22,305 --> 01:15:24,296
Do you like wild cats?

687
01:15:26,776 --> 01:15:28,038
Tell me.

688
01:15:32,615 --> 01:15:33,445
Hello.

689
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:23,165
Stop!

690
01:17:09,011 --> 01:17:11,138
That soldier doesn't make a mistake..

691
01:17:11,347 --> 01:17:13,076
..or leave tracks.

692
01:17:13,983 --> 01:17:17,111
But Simrit has left
a trail for me MP.

693
01:17:20,189 --> 01:17:21,622
That's Love!

694
01:17:28,264 --> 01:17:29,231
Just a minute.

695
01:17:29,799 --> 01:17:30,925
Where did this shirt tear?

696
01:17:32,101 --> 01:17:32,999
Don't know.

697
01:20:20,002 --> 01:20:22,095
He knows the game.

698
01:20:22,872 --> 01:20:25,170
The dogs are going around in circles.

699
01:20:25,374 --> 01:20:28,400
And, the water has
washed away the tracks.

700
01:20:28,811 --> 01:20:31,177
They aren't going to
settle down in the jungle.

701
01:20:31,714 --> 01:20:33,147
lf they're headed for the highway..

702
01:20:33,215 --> 01:20:34,944
..then, they must be going west.

703
01:20:35,017 --> 01:20:36,348
The girl's with him..

704
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,744
..so, he won't take
the mountain route.

705
01:20:39,255 --> 01:20:41,018
He'll take the jungle route.

706
01:20:41,724 --> 01:20:44,352
What if we take that
route and surround them?

707
01:20:52,701 --> 01:20:53,861
Come, sir.

708
01:20:55,304 --> 01:20:56,293
Yes.

709
01:20:56,739 --> 01:20:58,070
How can l help you?

710
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:01,675
Him! He's an astonishing man.

711
01:21:01,744 --> 01:21:04,338
He beat up people at the bus stand.

712
01:21:21,197 --> 01:21:22,391
Careful.

713
01:21:22,832 --> 01:21:25,198
Or, they'll get alerted.

714
01:21:51,827 --> 01:21:53,294
Stay here.

715
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:42,995
Now you are with in my reach,
soldier!

716
01:24:10,232 --> 01:24:12,029
(Cursing)

717
01:25:07,122 --> 01:25:08,214
(Cheering sound)

718
01:25:09,925 --> 01:25:11,916
(wailing)

719
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,827
Who wouldn't fall in
love with this attitude!

720
01:25:41,056 --> 01:25:44,355
Now, l'll drag you
tied to a bamboo, soldier

721
01:25:48,197 --> 01:25:51,098
Just look at your stride!

722
01:25:51,166 --> 01:25:52,793
Left-right.. Left-right..

723
01:25:55,637 --> 01:25:57,628
Hunters don't dare
to catch the lion..

724
01:25:57,740 --> 01:26:00,208
..even when he's wounded.

725
01:26:00,943 --> 01:26:04,572
And, you are not even a hunter dog.

726
01:26:13,122 --> 01:26:15,784
Yourjokes really hurt me, soldier..

727
01:26:16,792 --> 01:26:18,316
..then l get angry.

728
01:26:18,761 --> 01:26:20,786
But when l really hurt..

729
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:24,292
..you will not get
angry but get killed.

730
01:26:28,771 --> 01:26:31,171
You like jumping in the river,
don't you?

731
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:03,135
Die!!

732
01:27:25,894 --> 01:27:28,658
MP. We forgot to complete
that joke in the morning.

733
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:31,062
Oh no.
- He would've died with a smile.

734
01:27:31,133 --> 01:27:33,658
No need to be formal with kin.

735
01:27:34,203 --> 01:27:36,330
But, who will we hang at the square?

736
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:40,201
Oh no.

737
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:42,939
Why beat him up so badly?

738
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:46,208
You guys are ruthless.

739
01:27:46,281 --> 01:27:47,873
He doesn't look like a duplicate now.

740
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:49,747
Sorry. l got carried away.

741
01:27:51,286 --> 01:27:53,618
How can you get carried away?

742
01:27:54,656 --> 01:27:56,021
Couldn't you control yourself?

743
01:27:56,959 --> 01:27:58,187
ls he dead?

744
01:27:59,928 --> 01:28:00,895
Bro.

745
01:28:01,029 --> 01:28:01,996
Bro.

746
01:28:02,297 --> 01:28:04,993
Don't die before we reach the square.

747
01:28:05,167 --> 01:28:06,862
You have to die there.

748
01:28:07,336 --> 01:28:08,303
Hold it.

749
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:09,302
Good.

750
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:14,239
Bless you!

751
01:28:14,643 --> 01:28:15,871
Let's go.
- Come on.

752
01:28:18,847 --> 01:28:20,747
Hello, sister-in-law.

753
01:28:20,816 --> 01:28:22,306
Congratulations on your marriage.

754
01:28:22,384 --> 01:28:23,646
Me too.

755
01:28:23,719 --> 01:28:25,812
So, finally l am
going to tie the knot!.

756
01:28:33,729 --> 01:28:35,128
Hello.
- Hello, uncle.

757
01:28:35,197 --> 01:28:37,757
Daljeet here from Canada.
What happened?

758
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:40,893
You said Simrit will reach
Simla in a day and call me.

759
01:28:40,969 --> 01:28:42,368
l had to get her visa.

760
01:28:42,971 --> 01:28:44,768
The entire plan went haywire, son.

761
01:28:45,674 --> 01:28:49,303
That thug AK, was keeping a watch.

762
01:28:50,312 --> 01:28:52,940
He found out about Simrit's escape.

763
01:29:01,123 --> 01:29:05,685
''l don't care''

764
01:29:05,994 --> 01:29:07,325
Yes, Kuki.

765
01:29:07,663 --> 01:29:08,960
News for AK sir.

766
01:29:09,031 --> 01:29:10,760
Go ahead.

767
01:29:10,966 --> 01:29:12,729
Simrit's father helped
her run from Dilerkot

768
01:29:12,801 --> 01:29:14,735
He was trying to send her to Canada.

769
01:29:14,903 --> 01:29:17,667
His nephew Daljeet
called from Canada.

770
01:29:17,739 --> 01:29:18,763
l overheard their conversation.

771
01:29:19,141 --> 01:29:20,073
Fine.

772
01:29:20,709 --> 01:29:22,370
Come over tonight for your drug dose.

773
01:29:23,045 --> 01:29:23,875
Who was that?

774
01:29:25,347 --> 01:29:26,405
Brother, just a minute.

775
01:29:32,688 --> 01:29:34,679
That was Kuki on the phone.

776
01:29:35,357 --> 01:29:37,791
Sister-in-law ran
with the help of her father.

777
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:40,929
He was planning
to send her to Canada.

778
01:29:48,904 --> 01:29:52,067
You did a really good job today.
- Thank you.

779
01:29:54,242 --> 01:29:57,234
After winning the elections,
l'll give you a promotion.

780
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:03,174
Make her watch everything.

781
01:30:03,285 --> 01:30:05,276
She should realize her mistake.

782
01:30:06,154 --> 01:30:07,781
Go ahead, gulp it down.

783
01:30:07,990 --> 01:30:09,821
After that, run over them.

784
01:30:09,925 --> 01:30:11,051
Don't worry.

785
01:30:11,326 --> 01:30:13,021
Here you go behind the bars,

786
01:30:13,095 --> 01:30:15,893
and there your family
becomes as rich as her family!

787
01:30:17,132 --> 01:30:18,121
Come on.

788
01:30:20,035 --> 01:30:21,627
Stop! Wait.

789
01:30:21,937 --> 01:30:23,632
Hear this before you go tojail.

790
01:30:23,772 --> 01:30:27,208
Teacher told Raju
''Son, never say you don't know''.

791
01:30:27,409 --> 01:30:29,240
Always say ''l know everything''

792
01:30:30,712 --> 01:30:31,679
Raju goes home.

793
01:30:31,813 --> 01:30:33,974
''Papa, l know everything.''

794
01:30:34,983 --> 01:30:38,646
''Son, here take this 50,
aunty only comes over to meet me.''

795
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,382
''Mom, l know everything.''

796
01:30:41,723 --> 01:30:44,715
''Son, here take this 100.
Don't tell anyone.''

797
01:30:44,793 --> 01:30:46,886
''Uncle only comes to clean the room.''

798
01:30:49,264 --> 01:30:53,394
''Uncle. l know everything.''

799
01:30:56,371 --> 01:31:01,001
''You know it, then won't
you give your father a hug?''

800
01:31:04,946 --> 01:31:06,038
Go on.

801
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:09,642
Stop.

802
01:31:11,386 --> 01:31:13,980
MP. Kuki's left.

803
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:18,320
Won't people suspect
that he's the only survivor?

804
01:31:19,728 --> 01:31:20,786
Yes, brother.
- No, brother.

805
01:31:20,862 --> 01:31:21,829
Yes, Kuki.

806
01:31:23,632 --> 01:31:25,862
We should have atleast
one real accident.

807
01:31:26,034 --> 01:31:27,058
No, brother.

808
01:31:31,006 --> 01:31:33,406
Please let me go, brother.

809
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:35,335
Bless you Kuki.
- But l have helped you.

810
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:37,344
Forgive me. Let me go.

811
01:31:37,412 --> 01:31:39,642
Let me go. Forgive me.
- Sister-in-law.

812
01:31:39,815 --> 01:31:41,305
Watch closely.

813
01:31:41,416 --> 01:31:42,883
Let me go.

814
01:31:43,251 --> 01:31:44,775
Forgive me.

815
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,046
Pardon me.

816
01:31:47,089 --> 01:31:48,113
Brother!

817
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:50,280
Pardon me.

818
01:31:50,659 --> 01:31:54,220
Pardon me..
- We want a home run.

819
01:31:54,296 --> 01:31:55,820
Pardon me.

820
01:31:56,164 --> 01:31:59,031
Pardon me..
- We want a home run.

821
01:31:59,101 --> 01:32:01,695
Sir.. sir...

822
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:04,671
Home run!

823
01:32:28,663 --> 01:32:30,392
Let's settle the scores.

824
01:32:31,266 --> 01:32:33,359
l killed them, you forget that.

825
01:32:34,169 --> 01:32:37,297
You humiliated me, l'll forget that.

826
01:32:41,042 --> 01:32:42,976
The choice is yours.

827
01:32:43,979 --> 01:32:47,676
Either we have a wedding
night few days later..

828
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:51,114
..or you spend tonight
with all of my men here!

829
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:15,676
l've kept my word.

830
01:33:16,978 --> 01:33:23,850
You can see him hanging
here... after l leave.

831
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:27,378
l've brought Simrit back.

832
01:33:28,757 --> 01:33:30,622
So, let the celebrations continue

833
01:33:31,393 --> 01:33:33,088
Until my marriage.

834
01:33:37,132 --> 01:33:40,329
l'm going to have fun tonight.

835
01:33:46,274 --> 01:33:48,970
l've called for a
new lass from Mumbai.

836
01:39:02,323 --> 01:39:04,314
You tried running away, Simrit.

837
01:39:04,792 --> 01:39:05,816
What did you gain?

838
01:39:05,994 --> 01:39:07,859
Lost everything.

839
01:39:08,997 --> 01:39:10,828
You better compromise now.

840
01:39:10,899 --> 01:39:12,389
l might have back then.

841
01:39:13,668 --> 01:39:14,862
But not anymore.

842
01:39:16,371 --> 01:39:19,238
lt wasn't easy watching
father and the others die.

843
01:39:21,643 --> 01:39:23,406
Now, l'm waiting
for the moment when..

844
01:39:23,678 --> 01:39:26,010
What's the point in waiting, Simrit?

845
01:39:26,347 --> 01:39:27,974
Don't you understand?

846
01:39:28,416 --> 01:39:30,247
No one's going to come, Simrit.

847
01:39:30,318 --> 01:39:33,287
He never leaves any job incomplete.

848
01:39:34,689 --> 01:39:38,887
l started this, but he'll end it.

849
01:39:40,762 --> 01:39:41,956
Karan will be here.

850
01:39:43,097 --> 01:39:44,155
He'll come.

851
01:41:38,746 --> 01:41:40,077
Come on, let's go. Quickly.

852
01:42:10,611 --> 01:42:11,635
MP!

853
01:42:15,216 --> 01:42:16,274
MP!

854
01:42:18,186 --> 01:42:20,154
l'll get the police force.

855
01:42:22,123 --> 01:42:23,090
MP!

856
01:42:23,891 --> 01:42:25,017
Brother.

857
01:42:29,397 --> 01:42:31,024
l think it's another good one.

858
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,897
But, you won't laugh this time.

859
01:42:35,870 --> 01:42:36,894
We'll meet again.

860
01:42:38,906 --> 01:42:39,964
(cursing)

861
01:43:13,307 --> 01:43:14,740
Hey soldier.

862
01:43:15,109 --> 01:43:16,235
Down here.

863
01:43:18,312 --> 01:43:19,142
What happened?

864
01:43:20,214 --> 01:43:21,146
Couldn't find her?

865
01:43:21,349 --> 01:43:24,113
You haven't crossed that level yet..

866
01:43:24,185 --> 01:43:27,177
..after which you get the princess.

867
01:43:35,396 --> 01:43:37,694
He has killed everyone.

868
01:43:39,634 --> 01:43:41,795
He has killed everyone!

869
01:43:43,171 --> 01:43:45,230
She's praising me.

870
01:43:45,773 --> 01:43:49,209
To come down here,
you need to cross another level.

871
01:43:54,849 --> 01:43:58,182
After you cross this level,
we can play the final.

872
01:44:00,121 --> 01:44:02,055
We couldn't find your body.

873
01:44:02,623 --> 01:44:04,215
Since then he's been wanting to..

874
01:44:04,292 --> 01:44:06,055
..kill you before me.

875
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:07,227
He's been after me.

876
01:44:07,295 --> 01:44:08,819
''l'll kill him. l'll kill him.''

877
01:44:12,166 --> 01:44:14,657
So, you can finish playing.

878
01:44:14,735 --> 01:44:16,293
l'm off to the next level.

879
01:44:20,174 --> 01:44:20,970
Come on.

880
01:44:21,843 --> 01:44:22,775
What? Let's go.

881
01:48:37,198 --> 01:48:38,893
He will not die easily.

882
01:48:38,966 --> 01:48:40,661
Come on!

883
01:48:58,252 --> 01:48:59,378
You..

884
01:49:42,062 --> 01:49:43,154
Let me speak to the minister.

885
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:46,358
And tell him that the terrorist
has come back to Dilerkot.

886
01:49:46,834 --> 01:49:47,732
Yes.

887
01:49:47,801 --> 01:49:50,429
Are you waiting for
Dilerkot to be obliterated?

888
01:49:50,704 --> 01:49:54,265
Send a team to Dilerkot,
and kill him. Get it!

889
01:49:54,341 --> 01:49:55,808
l haven't reached there yet, sir.

890
01:49:55,876 --> 01:49:57,844
l'll take the force from
Police Lines and go to Dilerkot.

891
01:49:57,912 --> 01:49:58,844
Okay.

892
01:49:58,913 --> 01:50:01,143
And listen,
the press is reaching as well.

893
01:50:01,315 --> 01:50:05,342
Tell them, that he's the
enemy's brain-washed soldier..

894
01:50:05,619 --> 01:50:09,077
..and a terrorist,
not one of our commandos.

895
01:50:10,224 --> 01:50:11,782
Shoot him.

896
01:50:25,806 --> 01:50:28,775
(Crowd running)

897
01:50:28,943 --> 01:50:32,310
(Crowd running)

898
01:50:33,414 --> 01:50:35,348
(AK cursing)

899
01:50:57,871 --> 01:50:58,929
Oh, God!

900
01:51:20,828 --> 01:51:21,988
Don't worry, AK.

901
01:51:22,062 --> 01:51:25,998
A commando's always fair.

902
01:51:28,102 --> 01:51:30,400
A few thousand thugs like him..

903
01:51:30,804 --> 01:51:32,704
..are suppressing a billion
people like you.

904
01:51:32,873 --> 01:51:34,636
Because people have forgotten..

905
01:51:34,908 --> 01:51:37,877
..that no one can be more
dangerous than a mob.

906
01:51:44,151 --> 01:51:45,413
One!

907
01:51:45,919 --> 01:51:47,216
Hit just one of them.

908
01:51:47,655 --> 01:51:48,849
And you'll know that..

909
01:51:48,922 --> 01:51:50,890
..they thrive on your fear.

910
01:51:54,094 --> 01:51:56,187
They scare you with 20.

911
01:51:56,397 --> 01:51:58,194
So, you come in a group of 200.

912
01:51:59,066 --> 01:52:02,058
And watch, who scares whom?

913
01:52:06,974 --> 01:52:08,202
l made a big mistake.

914
01:52:09,109 --> 01:52:11,873
l should've put you in
the car along with your father..

915
01:52:13,847 --> 01:52:16,042
Your expiry date has come.

916
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:18,208
Better die quietly.

917
01:52:18,786 --> 01:52:21,254
Otherwise, l'll clobber you to death.

918
01:52:28,996 --> 01:52:30,122
Come on.

919
01:52:30,297 --> 01:52:33,755
Those whojust watch,
become the next victim.

920
01:52:34,835 --> 01:52:36,666
What good can we do at the border..

921
01:52:36,737 --> 01:52:39,797
..if you let them
weaken us from inside.

922
01:52:42,676 --> 01:52:44,303
You'll pay for it.

923
01:52:51,418 --> 01:52:52,282
Hey, stop.

924
01:52:52,353 --> 01:52:54,150
Stop or l'll shoot.

925
01:53:02,996 --> 01:53:04,293
Stop soldier.

926
01:53:04,732 --> 01:53:07,860
(Reporters murmuring)

927
01:53:09,370 --> 01:53:11,998
Kill him. Kill him.

928
01:53:13,874 --> 01:53:15,136
Shoot him, SP.

929
01:53:15,843 --> 01:53:16,810
Kill him.

930
01:53:17,111 --> 01:53:18,169
Kill him.

931
01:53:21,648 --> 01:53:22,342
Stop it.

932
01:53:29,256 --> 01:53:31,156
Kill him.

933
01:53:31,225 --> 01:53:33,022
Your masters think..

934
01:53:33,093 --> 01:53:37,359
..every guy in a
uniform is their pet,

935
01:53:38,766 --> 01:53:42,327
but, people still have faith in us.

936
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:44,895
And Karan has
strengthened that belief.

937
01:53:44,972 --> 01:53:47,702
Colonel Sinha, this is our case.

938
01:53:47,875 --> 01:53:51,174
lt is our case, our man,

939
01:53:51,812 --> 01:53:53,370
and, our country.

940
01:53:54,148 --> 01:53:57,640
Karan, finish what you have started.

941
01:54:05,259 --> 01:54:06,726
SP. SP.

942
01:54:06,827 --> 01:54:08,351
SP, shoot him.

943
01:54:10,898 --> 01:54:12,331
Shoot him, SP.

944
01:54:12,633 --> 01:54:14,123
l'll handle everything.

945
01:54:16,069 --> 01:54:18,094
SP. Shoot him.

946
01:54:18,172 --> 01:54:19,366
(Curse word)

947
01:54:24,011 --> 01:54:25,672
SP. SP.

948
01:54:25,746 --> 01:54:26,713
What are you looking at?

949
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:28,304
SP. SP.

950
01:54:28,682 --> 01:54:31,344
l'll turn over a new leaf. l will.

951
01:54:31,618 --> 01:54:33,984
Simrit. Simrit. Tell him.

952
01:54:34,188 --> 01:54:35,655
No, no, no.

953
01:54:35,722 --> 01:54:37,121
There's no enmity between us.

954
01:54:37,191 --> 01:54:39,216
There's no enmity between us.

955
01:54:39,326 --> 01:54:41,920
Listen to me.
- Let's complete that joke of yours,

956
01:54:42,296 --> 01:54:43,957
you'll die with a smile

957
01:54:44,364 --> 01:54:49,028
What did Mike say in Pat's ear,
that he died?

958
01:54:51,939 --> 01:54:53,770
Bang!
- No!

959
01:55:20,968 --> 01:55:23,960
He lied about his
eyes and scared you,

960
01:55:25,205 --> 01:55:27,196
don't be scared of such stories.

961
01:55:27,774 --> 01:55:29,935
Make up your own
stories and scare them.

962
01:55:59,806 --> 01:56:00,602
Now?.

963
01:56:02,709 --> 01:56:04,677
l've killed him in front of my unit,

964
01:56:05,212 --> 01:56:06,839
so, l'm bound to be court-marshaled.

965
01:56:07,314 --> 01:56:09,805
l'll be discharged,
with honors or without,

966
01:56:10,284 --> 01:56:11,012
don't know.

967
01:56:11,084 --> 01:56:13,951
You could ask about me too,
it won't hurt you, Hero.

968
01:56:14,588 --> 01:56:17,250
You're the real hero, for them.

969
01:56:18,292 --> 01:56:21,784
Do what your father
used to do for them.

970
01:56:22,095 --> 01:56:25,030
Thought about everyone.

971
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:29,630
But you didn't think about us.

972
01:56:30,304 --> 01:56:32,295
That's what l have
to do after l leave.

973
01:56:32,372 --> 01:56:33,270
What?

974
01:56:34,241 --> 01:56:35,868
Think about you.

975
01:56:36,276 --> 01:56:39,143
You're going, so saying this
only to make me feel better?

976
01:56:39,813 --> 01:56:40,973
l'm coming back.

977
01:56:41,815 --> 01:56:43,305
Just asking you to wait.

978
01:56:44,851 --> 01:56:47,285
By the way,
l am Captain Karanveer Singh Dogra.

979
