00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,300
# Movin' in #

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,660
# Makin' my connection #

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,660
# Something's up #

4
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,540
# I can feel it in the air #

5
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,700
# Private eyes #

6
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,260
# Never know who's watchin' #

7
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,420
# Play it cool #

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,460
# But you haven't got a prayer #

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,100
# Have you heard the news #

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,180
# Makin' all the headlines #

11
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,540
# Zoomin' via satellite #

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,980
# Have you heard the news #

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,900
# Comin' through the grapevine #

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,180
# Fletch is

# Bit by bit #

00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,380
# One way or another #

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,140
# Bit by bit #

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,220
# Running undercover

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,420

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,860

00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,820

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,980
# Nothing's gonna

# Tonight ##

25
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,020
My name is Erwin Fletcher.

26
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,460
I'm an investigative reporter
for a Los Angeles paper.

27
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,380
You've probably read my stuff
under the byline of Jane Doe.

28
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,740
It's better than Erwin.

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,660
Recently I've been
loitering around the beach...

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,900
trying to pass for
a minor league junkie.

31
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,380
I don't nod out or drool;
that's too obvious.

32
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,940
Act like you don't care
and you fit right in.

33
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,660
Business has really picked up.

34
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,140
I'm still closed.

35
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,100
Is it a Colombian national holiday?

36
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,340
What do you figure, Sam?

37
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,020
No idea.

38
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,780
- No idea at all?
- Some idea.

39
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,140
Like when?

40
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,180
When it comes, it comes.

41
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,500
I got some reds.

42
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,340
You don't mean communists,
do you?

43
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,780
Is everything a joke
to you, Fletch?

44
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,340
Everything, Sam.

45
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,180
- Hey, Gummy!
- Hey, Fletch. Hey, Sam.

46
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,820
How's the eye?

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,860
It's OK.
The cops did it.

48
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,900
They always
beating up on me.

49
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,060
- He doesn't know.
- Son of a bitch!

50
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,620
That's what he said.

51
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,060
He doesn't know?
How come he doesn't know?

52
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,260
I don't know.
He just doesn't know.

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,300
Son of a bitch!

54
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,420
I wonder how he
gets the stuff.

55
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,060
I have no idea.

56
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,180
Sam never leaves the beach.

57
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,460
He sits in that chair.
He's out of shit.

58
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,300
Suddenly he gets up,
he's got shit.

59
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,060
Where's it coming from?
The sand?

60
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,980
That's highly unlikely, Grease.

61
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,220
I oughta get some sleep.

62
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,780
Grease, how old are you?

63
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,180
Nineteen.

64
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,900
You're not taking
very good care of yourself.

65
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,540
If you haven't guessed, there's been
a lot of drug traffic on the beach.

66
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,740
I'm not talking about No-Doze.

67
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,860
I talkin' about the hard stuff.
A lot of it.

68
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,740
I've been trying to find out
who's behind it.

69
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,740
It hasn't been easy.

70
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,740
I don't shower much.

71
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,540
Excuse me. I have something
I'd like to discuss with you.

72
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,460
- What's that?
- We can't talk about it here.

73
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,460
- Why not?
- Because we can't.

74
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,740
You on a scavenger hunt, or did I
forget to pay my dinner check?

75
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,140
Come to my house
to talk.

76
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,700
Wrong gal, fella.

77
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,700
I'll give you
$1,000 cash.

78
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,100
What?

79
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,060
Come to my house
and listen to the proposition.

80
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,460
If you reject the proposition,
you keep the thousand...

81
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,700
and your mouth shut.

82
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,500
Does this entail
my dressing up as Little Bo Peep?

83
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,220
- It's nothing of a sexual nature.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
One thousand just to listen?

85
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,860
How can you pass that up,
Mister...

86
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,820
Nugent. Ted Nugent.

87
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,180
Alan Stanwyk.

88
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,660
Alan, charmed.

89
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,900
For an extra grand, I'll let you
take me out to dinner.

90
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,260
What a coincidence.

91
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,140
What?

92
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,780
I almost bought
this place.

93
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,660
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy
killed himself here. Blew it for me.

94
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,740
- Who?
- Hopalong Cassidy.

95
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,460
Bow and arrow.
Very weird.

96
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,300
Are you doped up?

97
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,220
Don't talk to me like that.
I don't work for you.

98
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,580
- Buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.

99
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,580
Pup 'N' Taco.

100
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,500
Oh, you've remodeled
the garage.

101
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,540
Must have
cost you hundreds.

102
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,260
Good idea.
I oughta frame mine.

103
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,980
Will the Pope
be in later?

104
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,540
Here's my proposition.

105
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,060
I'm all ears.

106
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,020
I want you
to murder me.

107
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,060
Here...

108
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,540
on Thursday.

109
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,660
I'd like you
to shoot me dead.

110
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,500
The reason
I ask for this service...

111
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,100
is because I'm already facing
a very long...

112
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,500
painful and most certain death.

113
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,460
You see, I have bone cancer.

114
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,460
I don't know if you
know about bone cancer.

115
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,540
It's the worst kind you can get.

116
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,500
It just eats you up
bit by bit.

117
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,700
You don't look sick.

118
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,980
I don't feel sick. Not yet.

119
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,500
It'll get bad
in a month.

120
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,500
After that, I'd rather
not be around for it.

121
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,500
Why not try suicide?

122
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,180
I've thought about it.

123
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,340
My company's taken out
a large life insurance policy on me.

124
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,660
Suicide would nullify it,
but murder does not.

125
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,580
- Why me?
- You're a drifter.

126
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,020
A, uh... pardon the expression...
a junkie.

127
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,740
Nobody would notice
if you disappeared.

128
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,780
I've been watching you
for a couple of weeks.

129
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,900
Maybe I'm
just on vacation.

130
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,260
Not with the scum
you hang out with.

131
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,900
No, I've watched...
and I've thought.

132
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,620
It's an elegant plan.

133
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,740
I've even figured out
your escape.

134
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,140
Swell.

135
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,100
Has it ever occurred to you
I might not want to murder you?

136
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,780
I've got $50,000
says you will.

137
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,820
50,000.

138
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,820
And a guarantee you
won't get caught.

139
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,780
I'm still here.

140
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,020
I want it done Thursday
around 8:00 p.m.

141
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,620
My wife will be out,
and it's the staff's night off.

142
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,820
- These will be open.
- Wouldn't they normally be locked?

143
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,540
Sometimes. The staff
usually forgets.

144
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,860
I have the same trouble
with my help.

145
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,060
I'll be here
waiting for you.

146
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
The safe will be open.

147
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,980
There will be
$50,000 in it.

148
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,620
You'll be wearing rubber gloves.
Do you own rubber gloves?

149
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,660
I rent 'em. I have
a lease with an option to buy.

150
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,540
Now in this drawer...

151
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,460
Ah!

152
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,940
A.357 Magnum.

153
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,300
My.357. You use it.

154
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,580
No one can trace it to you.

155
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,580
The room will be
in disarray.

156
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,980
Like a burglary attempt?

157
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,940
You come in and catch me
stealing your ties and money?

158
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,740
We scuffle. The gun
gets loose and I shoot you.

159
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,340
Precisely.

160
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,300
- Are you a good shot?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

161
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,700
Get me on the first shot,
if you can.

162
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,420
- Do you have a passport?
- Can dig one up.

163
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,660
Good. Now, after you kill me,
take the Jaguar.

164
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,180
The keys will be
in the glove compartment.

165
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,220
- Take it where?
- L.A.X.

166
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,460
Pan Am will have a ticket for you.

167
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,420
- Where am I going?
- Rio.

168
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,820
It departs at 11 p.m.

169
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,020
They serve dinner onboard?

170
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
And a movie and drinks.

171
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,500
Stay down there
for a year.

172
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,740
So?

173
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,900
So...

174
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,060
You certainly
thought this out.

175
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,580
I don't leave
a great deal to chance.

176
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,660
Those will be open?

177
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,140
Take care of the gloves,
the passport and the aim.

178
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,580
I'll handle
everything else.

179
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,460
The gun, the money,
the tickets...

180
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,900
and the dying.

181
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,860
That's right.

182
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,100
Looks like you
get the hard part.

183
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,020
What do you say?

184
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,580
You'll be doing me
a great service.

185
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,980
Will you kill me?

186
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,700
Sure.

187
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,460
Hey! Good to see you.

188
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,900
Slouch,
how are you?

189
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,820
Can I steal you?

190
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,580
If you promise
not to return me.

191
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,500
- Magic today?
- Yeah, Kareem's in the wash.

192
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,140
I need a favor.

193
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,580
- Fletch!
- Did you hear something?

194
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,540
See what we have on Alan Stanwyk
in Beverly Hills.

195
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,340
I need this right away.

196
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,940
- I take it the story's done.
- W-Y-K.

197
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,900
Tell me I'm right.

198
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,900
You're right,
but you're very peaked.

199
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,420
Want to vomit?
Come on in.

200
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,740
- The story's done, right?
- Uh... almost.

201
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,540
Almost is not an answer.

202
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,660
Yes is an answer.

203
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,340
And a damn fine answer.

204
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,420
Professional journalism time now.

205
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,540
Go back and finish
the story!

206
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,340
Frank, I will.
I swear it.

207
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,740
Something came up.

208
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,820
You've got
a deadline tomorrow.

209
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,820
Did you see Sunday's ad?

210
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,740
I don't read the paper.
What's the spread on tonight's game?

211
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,460
- Lakers by six.
- Take a look.

212
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,860
"Shame of the City."
That's very nice.

213
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,780
Try to follow this.

214
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,700
You can't run the ad
and then not run the story.

215
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,340
You can't? Why not?

216
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,020
Shit. Really?

217
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,780
I'm putting you on. You'll get
the story. You'll be proud of it.

218
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,140
You broke it?
You know the source?

219
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,420
Practically.

220
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,220
Is it Fat Sam?
You said you had pictures of him.

221
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,340
- I do have pictures of him dealing.
- Let's go. We'll run them.

222
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,900
You can't do that.

223
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,020
Fat Sam isn't the story.
There's a source behind him.

224
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,900
Who?

225
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,540
That's a gray area.

226
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,740
How gray?

227
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,860
Charcoal.

228
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,380
May I help you with that?

229
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,060
OK. A little lighter.

230
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,020
Can you go higher?

231
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,980
Over to the right.
Higher. Perfect.

232
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,940
Nice and hard.
That's good. Thank you.

233
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,940
- That it?
- Perfect.

234
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,700
Everything's recent.

235
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,100
Let me see that. "Alan Stanwyk,
commercial airline pilot...

236
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,060
from Provo, Utah."

237
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,900
Formerly a test pilot,
member of the Jaycees.

238
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,620
- Move on?
- Yeah.

239
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,380
Married Boyd Aviation.

240
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,420
He's no dummy.
That's big bucks.

241
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,220
His parents are Marvin and Velma,
"were unable to attend the wedding."

242
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,020
Those are three names I enjoy:
Marvin, Velma and Provo.

243
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,420
Hold it there.

244
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,580
Cancer.
"Cancer Society Benefit."

245
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,940
"Internist Dr. Joseph Dolan."

246
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,020
I wonder if
that's his doctor.

247
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,980
One way to find out.

248
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,700
There is.

249
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,420
Where do you
know Alan from?

250
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,260
We play tennis
at the club.

251
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,740
California Racquet Club?

252
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,220
- Right.
- That's my club too.

253
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,060
I don't remember
seeing you there.

254
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,820
I haven't been playing
because of these kidney pains.

255
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,940
Right. How long have you
had these pains, Mr. Barber?

256
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,500
No, that's Babar.

257
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,020
Two B's?

258
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,700
One "B."
B-A-B-A-R.

259
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,980
- That's two.
- Yeah, but not together.

260
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,860
I thought
that's what you meant.

261
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,140
Arnold Babar.

262
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,060
Aren't there
children's books...

263
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,260
about an elephant
named Babar?

264
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,300
- I don't know. I don't have any.
- No children?

265
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,700
No, elephant books.

266
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,620
Open wide.

267
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,460
Say, "Ah."

268
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,820
Aah.

269
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,700
It's an odd name.

270
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,540
I haven't seen it
on the club registry.

271
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,900
I don't formally belong.
I'm a guest of my aunt's.

272
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,300
Your aunt?

273
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
- Right. Mrs. Smith.
- Joan or Margaret?

274
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,740
Uh-huh.

275
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,140
Which one?

276
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,220
Margaret.

277
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,660
Funny old bird.

278
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,660
I could tell you
some stories.

279
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,180
I bet.

280
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,300
You know,
it's a shame about Ed.

281
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,180
It was.
That was really a shame.

282
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,100
To go so suddenly.

283
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,220
He was dying
for years.

284
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,420
But the end
was very sudden.

285
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,180
He was in intensive care
for eight weeks.

286
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,140
But the very end,
when he actually died...

287
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,140
was extremely sudden.

288
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,580
Alan and I were recently
speaking of dying.

289
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,820
He told me Boyd Aviation took out
a large insurance policy on him.

290
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,020
You've got to be
in perfect shape...

291
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,700
to get that sort
of a policy, I bet.

292
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,180
Drop your shorts
and bend over, Mr. Babar.

293
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,140
No, really.
We don't need to.

294
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,380
We don't want
to do that.

295
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,580
My kidneys feel better
in this position.

296
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,420
Maybe it's that I'm not doing
any calisthenics.

297
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,620
If I did sit-ups
or bent over like this...

298
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,580
I'd feel 100%/% bet...

299
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,700
# Moon River ##

300
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,620
Whew! Thank you, Doc.
You ever serve time?

301
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,780
- Breathe easy.
- Breathe easy.

302
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,020
I was surprised Alan
got that policy.

303
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,180
There's a history of cancer
in the family.

304
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,300
- There is?
- Yeah.

305
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,700
As a matter of fact... Aah!
You using the whole fist?

306
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,220
Just relax.

307
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,900
I saw Alan the other day.
He was looking peaked.

308
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,340
Are you sure
he's all right?

309
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,260
I can't discuss another patient.
You know that.

310
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,740
Well, I don't find
anything wrong with you.

311
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
I'm sure it's not
for a lack of looking.

312
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,580
12 noon.

313
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,940
I was anxious
to return to my drug story.

314
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,580
But since Dr. Jellyfinger
wasn't talking...

315
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,500
I had to find out
about Stanwyk's health.

316
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,140
May I help you, Dr., uh...

317
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,260
Dr. Rosenpenis. I'm here
to check Stanwyk's file.

318
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,460
Doctor who?

319
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,860
Dr. Rosenrosen.

320
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,780
Your name again.

321
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,460
It's Dr. Rosenhite.

322
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,100
Doctor who?

323
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,100
Dr. Rosen.
Where's the records room?

324
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,100
- Next to Pathology.
- Would you take care of these things?

325
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,500
I'd like to check
Alan Stanwyk's file.

326
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,340
Where the hell's
the records room?

327
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,540
Next to Pathology, B1.

328
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,300
Collate these for me.
Where did you say that was?

329
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,260
- B1.
- Thank you very much.

330
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,180
- Take the elevator.
- Thank you.

331
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,380
Give me a hand, Doctor.

332
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,220
Me?

333
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,820
Come on!

334
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,260
Yeah.

335
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,380
Have you ever seen a spleen
that large?

336
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,580
No, not since breakfast.

337
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,140
Here. Hold this.

338
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,300
I haven't sterilized
my hands.

339
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,420
You won't make him
any sicker.

340
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,980
I'll get it.

341
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,740
Ah, oh!

342
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,780
You never get used
to the smell, do ya?

343
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,980
Oh, Doctor.
Are you all right?

344
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,340
Where am I?

345
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,780
- The records room.
- The records room?

346
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,620
- I'm fine.
- Can I get you something?

347
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,620
Do you have
The Beatles' White Album?

348
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,740
Never mind. Get me
a glass of hot fat.

349
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,740
And bring me the head
of Alfredo Garcia.

350
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Dr. Holmes was
surprised you fainted.

351
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,860
He was surprised?

352
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,900
I thought that body
was my dead brother.

353
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,780
Oh!

354
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,660
That spleen was
the spitting image.

355
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,540
No, I'm fine.

356
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,060
Nurse, I'm hyperventilating.

357
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,020
Would you get me
a paper bag?

358
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
- Yes, right away.
- Thank you.

359
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,180
Here you are, Doctor.

360
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,580
Oh, thank you.

361
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,500
Can I help you?

362
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,500
No. Uh, yes, there is,
actually.

363
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,900
One of my associates
was doing a biopsy on this man.

364
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,580
They said he had a melanoma,
carcinoma... some kind of noma.

365
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,020
There's no record
of it here.

366
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,860
If he had one,
it would be in here.

367
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,940
Wait. Here it is.

368
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,940
"Surgical removal
of two moles.

369
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,980
Tissue was benign."

370
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,820
Benign? There's no mention
of cancer? That's it?

371
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,300
That's it.

372
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,780
This is one month ago.

373
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,980
According to this hospital,
Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.

374
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,500
I guess not.

375
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,900
He'll be so relieved.

376
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,180
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

377
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,140
Have a nice day.

378
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,020
I'm not finished.

379
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,180
- Sorry, Mr. Underhill.
- Do I look finished?

380
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,580
I guess not.

381
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,820
- Now I'm finished.
- Whatever you say.

382
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,740
You're expecting
a nice gratuity, right?

383
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,780
Maybe next time.

384
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,940
Gail Stanwyk?

385
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,260
Yeah.

386
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,100
I haven't seen you
since the wedding. You look great.

387
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,380
I do?
That's sweet of you.

388
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,260
I must've been plowed
at your wedding.

389
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,100
I don't know you.

390
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,220
Not my wedding,
your wedding.

391
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,260
Oh, my wedding.
Thank God.

392
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,580
Doesn't really help me.
Are you a friend of Alan's?

393
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,700
Yes, we flew together.
I'm John.

394
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,620
Oh, John.

395
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,260
Oh, yes.

396
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,580
No. John who?

397
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,260
John Cocktoasttoy.

398
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,420
Beautiful name.

399
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,900
It's Scotch-Rumanian.

400
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,260
- An odd combination.
- So were my parents.

401
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,540
Do you mind if I
practice some more?

402
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,060
Go ahead.

403
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,740
You're a member
of the club, senor?

404
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,140
No. I'm with the Underhills.

405
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,700
They left, senor.

406
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,660
He'll be back
after his urinalysis.

407
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,700
Would you like some drinks?

408
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,740
I'll put it on
the Underhills' bill.

409
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,900
Yes. I'll have
a Bloody Mary...

410
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,620
a steak sandwich,
and a steak sandwich.

411
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,980
So how's Alan?

412
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,180
He's been so busy lately,
I hardly see him.

413
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,900
- He's been preoccupied.
- With what?

414
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,500
I don't know.
Personal stuff.

415
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,980
Whoa!
I hit one.

416
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,060
Lobs are important
in tennis.

417
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,180
Sorry, sir.

418
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,500
I'll show you
a couple things.

419
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,260
Stand here.

420
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,380
When the ball comes,
face it like this.

421
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,900
Yeah.

422
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,500
And then
pivot your body,

423
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,940
step in
with your left foot.

424
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,780
Just like this.

425
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,180
OK?

426
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,860
Go ahead. Try one.

427
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,340
All right.
Go ahead.

428
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,260
Get in position.

429
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,420
The ball's going to come.
Ready?

430
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,060
How many are
in the machine?

431
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,620
- A lot, I thought.
- It's finished.

432
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,420
Good.
Much better.

433
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,860
I must be having an off day.
I'm usually a fabulous player.

434
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,900
I affect women this way.

435
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,820
I bet you do.

436
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,380
I bumped into Alan
this morning.

437
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,340
You know what
I can't figure out?

438
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,980
Alan's in Utah.

439
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,620
I can't figure out what I was doing
in Utah this morning.

440
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,740
I'm very flattered,
but I'm also very married.

441
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,500
You're hitting
on me, aren't you?

442
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,780
How did you guess?

443
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,860
I'm such a heel.
Don't know what came over me.

444
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,860
If I had a nickel
for every one of Alan's flyboy
buddies who tried to pick me up...

445
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,260
I'd be rich.

446
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,100
You are rich.

447
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,820
See what I mean?

448
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,860
The vice president knew
I was opening the door...

449
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,580
but the Secret Service...

450
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,060
Whack!
And blood...

451
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,820
Washington.

452
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,580
Sugar, Mr. Poon?

453
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,700
No, never, never.
Thank you.

454
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,540
Well, now,
let me reiterate...

455
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,900
that this is not
a formal investigation.

456
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,020
If Alan Stanwyk isn't involved
in improprieties...

457
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,340
Alan Stanwyk is not involved
in any improprieties.

458
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,140
How can the S.E.C.
make such an accusation?

459
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,380
You know that,
and I know that...

460
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,580
but somebody's bucking
for a promotion.

461
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,700
It's probably that
pederast Hanrahan.

462
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,740
If I don't go back
with something...

463
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,100
you and your son-in-law
will be the scapegoats.

464
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,700
Unbelievable.
This is unbelievable.

465
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,580
They want to know
why he's in Utah.

466
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,020
Jesus H. Christ
on a Popsicle stick.

467
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,300
First of all...

468
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,580
Alan Stanwyk does not own
one single share of stock.

469
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,420
The $3 million
for the ranch in Provo...

470
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,540
was entirely provided
by my daughter...

471
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:31,740
who converted her personal,
non-corporate holdings.

472
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,660
So, if any
of your D.C. boys...

473
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,900
want to challenge that,
bring them on.

474
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,780
Otherwise, tell them
to get out of my face.

475
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,180
God, I admire you.

476
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,180
Well...

477
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,140
consider
this case closed.

478
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,180
It stopped bleeding.
Isn't that something?

479
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,620
My pleasure.

480
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,580
Thank you and good day.

481
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,940
By the way...

482
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,500
what kind
of a name is Poon?

483
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,700
Comanche Indian.
Good-bye.

484
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,180
Madeline, Frieda lost the number
for Alan's realtor in Provo, Utah.

485
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,740
Could you get me that?

486
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,780
- Jim Swarthout?
- Yeah.

487
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,180
- Who are you again?
- I'm Frieda's boss.

488
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,460
- Who's Frieda?
- My secretary.

489
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,300
I knew my junkie pals were awaiting
my good cheer on the beach...

490
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,260
but I needed a second wind,
a beer and a wardrobe change.

491
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,420
As I pulled up to
my imitation apartment building...

492
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,060
I observed the Oldsmobuick
of Mr. Arnold T. Pants, Esquire...

493
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,060
attorney for the former
Mrs. Erwin Fletcher.

494
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,820
Time to use
the service entrance.

495
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,300
Refusal to pay alimony
is a jailable offense, Fletch.

496
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,100
What about trespassing
and loitering?

497
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,220
I am neither loitering
nor trespassing.

498
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,540
I've simply chosen
an advisable location...

499
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,020
to await my client's
delinquent husband.

500
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,060
I prefer to discuss
business inside.

501
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,620
Leave your rubbers outside.

502
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,260
A little one-on-one?

503
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,180
He draws the foul.

504
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,940
You owe Wendy $918.

505
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,980
She doesn't need it. She's been
living with somebody for months.

506
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,980
I don't
what you're referring to.

507
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,860
Wendy maintains
her own residence.

508
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,300
This stinks.

509
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,580
I empathize, Fletch.
However, you threw her out.

510
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,620
She slept with everybody.

511
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,420
Prove that in court.

512
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,300
My lawyer was a bum.

513
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,580
I agree.

514
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,140
They slept together.

515
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,660
You may be right.

516
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,060
Are you serious?

517
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,540
That's history, Fletch.

518
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,060
You owe us $918.

519
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,820
Hey!

520
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,180
I think our problems may just
be solved. Ed McMahon.

521
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,900
I think I
just won $1 million.

522
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,300
"Erwin M. Fletcher,
you choose."

523
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,780
Whoo-ee! I lost. Sorry.

524
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,460
It's no joke, Fletch.

525
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,300
If some kind of payment isn't made,
I'll have to garnish your wages.

526
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,900
I can't have
my wages garnish-ied.

527
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,940
Tell you what.

528
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,260
Cash? I'm impressed.

529
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,220
I saw my pimp today.

530
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,460
Open your raincoat.

531
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,820
Come on. Just once.
It's worth it.

532
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,460
That's $1,000.
Apply some towards next month.

533
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,420
- Now scram.
- Till then.

534
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,580
Keep 10 and get yourself
a nice piece of ass.

535
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,980
Our guest is
the most valuable player...

536
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,140
of the National
Basketball Association...

537
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,060
from the Los Angeles Lakers...

538
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,140
the all-time scoring champion
of the N.B.A., Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

539
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,020
He's coming off a game that was
second to none in his brilliant career.

540
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,380
You must be proud.

541
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,500
Definitely, Chick.
It was a great effort.

542
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,540
But I had a lot of help,
and we're just glad to be here.

543
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,420
How about Fletch?

544
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,540
What can I say about Fletch?
He's been fantastic.

545
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,300
He boxes out for us,
gets the tough rebounds...

546
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,420
and does what
we need to win.

547
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,540
It's great working with him. I don't
know where we'd be without him.

548
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,220
Let's look at the play.
He's 6'5". With the Afro, 6'9".

549
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,940
Good dribbler. Comes in deep.
His club is behind by one point.

550
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,580
Fletch puts the ball through the legs.
What a great play!

551
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,980
He puts it in!
The Lakers have the lead!

552
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,940
Was that some play! This kid
from Harlem really creates excitement.

553
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,180
$4 million a year,
but he earns every nickel.

554
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,180
Look how he shakes off
four or five defenders with ease.

555
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,660
Fletch... he truly defines
grace under pressure.

556
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,660
See if you've got anything on Stanwyk
from when he lived in Utah.

557
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,900
Yeah. And check out a realtor
in Provo named Swarthout.

558
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,020
Shit!

559
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,260
What's going on?

560
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,100
Take off, Fletch!

561
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,580
What are you doing?

562
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,540
They're after
Gummy again.

563
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,300
Slow down.
This is dumb.

564
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,220
Come on, man!

565
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,740
He's defenseless.

566
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,940
Don't...

567
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,540
Get up!

568
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,580
What are you doing?

569
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,740
Fletch!

570
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,740
Let me out!

571
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,940
Beat it, cop!

572
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,220
Hey, you're really nuts.

573
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,540
You OK?

574
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,580
Yeah. I feel like $100.

575
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,740
- They didn't do anything.
- What are you talking about?

576
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,620
I busted their window.

577
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,500
You're lucky.

578
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,500
It's not luck.
They didn't want me.

579
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,900
They wanted Gummy.

580
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,180
The cops and Gummy...

581
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,940
Relax, Frank.
I need more time.

582
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,860
I could be onto something.

583
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,780
What?

584
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,820
I don't want to spoil your surprise.
Read about it tomorrow.

585
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,260
What do you want?

586
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,860
Don't point. Speak!

587
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,020
- I need Fletch.
- She needs me.

588
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,060
Nothing on Utah
or Jim Swarthout.

589
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,660
I know. Put this
on the back burner.

590
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,940
Right here. That's good.

591
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,740
You wanna give me
just a little hint?

592
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,260
All right, Frank.

593
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,020
- There may be cops involved.
- Did you say cops?

594
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,020
- Yeah.
- That's one thing I found.

595
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,420
- It's from last month.
- What's this?

596
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,740
More cops. Frank,
I need to go to Utah.

597
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,180
Utah?

598
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,180
Yeah, Utah. It's wedged in
between Wyoming and Nevada.

599
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,700
- What about finding the source?
- I have some ideas.

600
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,180
Say yes, Frank. I'll buy you
some new deodorant.

601
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,020
Go to Transportation.
Get a ticket.

602
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,060
- My hero.
- Nothing to it.

603
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,460
You're not recording this,
are you?

604
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,500
No. Never. Never.

605
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,500
Question.

606
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,180
Question.

607
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,100
Why does a man
ask me to kill him...

608
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,020
and lie about dying
when he isn't dying?

609
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,260
Gail Stanwyk converts
$3 million of her stocks...

610
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,860
to buy the ranch.

611
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,700
Why pay in cash?

612
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,180
Mr. Jim Swarthout?

613
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,220
I'm Igor Stravinsky. I'm calling about
some ranch property I'd like to buy.

614
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,220
What did you have in mind?

615
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,780
Mm-hmm.

616
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,700
Are you a friend of Alan's?

617
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,140
No, not exactly.

618
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,940
I overheard some people
talking at the club.

619
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,740
$3 million sounded
like a good price.

620
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,860
Oh, is that right?

621
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,220
In that case,
I have been very misinformed.

622
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,420
Excuse you? Yes.

623
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,140
I'd like to come out and
see you anyway. Is that all right?

624
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,660
What's good for you?

625
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,500
Well, I'm about
to close up shop.

626
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,100
How about tomorrow morning?

627
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,060
First thing in the morning.
Tomorrow. Bye.

628
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,100
Hello!

629
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,860
Anybody home?

630
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,740
Hey, fella, what's your name?
Fluff? Fifi?

631
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,140
All right.

632
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,500
Bad dog.

633
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,220
Sit.

634
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,420
Stay.

635
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,140
I hate dogs.

636
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,100
Come on. Smile.
Say, "Fletch."

637
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,180
Look, defenseless babies.

638
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,940
Fell for the oldest trick
in the book.

639
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,980
# Strangers in the night #

640
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,380
# Exchanging clothing #

641
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,780
# Strangers in my pants... ##

642
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,420
Surprise!

643
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,740
- What the hell's...
- Police. Spread 'em!

644
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,180
- Got a gun?
- Shamu's got one. Borrow his.

645
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,380
- What have we here?
- That's my dick.

646
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,300
Oh, funny boy.

647
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,900
What have we here?

648
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,780
Looks like heroin, Gene.

649
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,740
You just planted that.

650
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,740
- What'd you say?
- Wanna read me my rights?

651
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,980
You have the right
to remain silent.

652
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,980
You have the right
to have your face kicked in.

653
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,060
Nice.

654
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,180
You have the right to have
your balls stomped by him.

655
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,260
I'll waive my rights.

656
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,420
What's the booking, gentlemen?

657
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,020
Possession of narcotics.
The chief wants to talk to him.

658
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,340
You'll like Chief Karlin.
He's a nice man.

659
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,420
I hear he's mellowed
since he came out of the closet.

660
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,900
Take his picture
while he still has a face.

661
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,060
That hurts.
You've been hurting.

662
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,860
Give him a buzz.

663
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,380
Come in.

664
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,380
Here he is, Chief.

665
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,580
Easy, fellas. I'll be
with you in a moment.

666
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,260
Did Mrs. Chief of Police
help you decorate?

667
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,420
So... what's your name?

668
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,900
Fletch.

669
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,540
- Full name.
- Fletch. F. Fletch.

670
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,620
I see. What do you do
for a living, Mr. Fletch?

671
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,140
I'm a shepherd.

672
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,820
Officers, could you excuse us
for a few moments?

673
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,020
Go to the gym
and pump each other.

674
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,380
Why are you doing this?

675
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,500
I like men.

676
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,460
I like to be manhandled.

677
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,020
I like you.

678
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,380
For someone caught holding
a bag of heroin...

679
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,820
- That was planted.
- We're looking at maybe 10 years.

680
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,940
Is that what you want, Jane Doe?

681
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,900
Your editor phoned me...

682
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,900
to respond to allegations
you're about to print...

683
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,140
concerning police involvement
in narcotics dealings.

684
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,060
Uh-uh. I'm about to bust
that beach wide open.

685
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,420
I don't need some penny-ante
Woodward and Bernstein...

686
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,460
to get in the way
of my men.

687
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,300
Your men may be involved in this.
I would think that might interest you.

688
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,940
Idiot!

689
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,740
All right.
Strictly off the record, OK?

690
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,100
Yeah, OK.

691
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,980
I got that beach crawling
with undercover cops.

692
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,140
But if you go nosing around,
you'll make the bad guys more cautious.

693
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,380
Makes my job harder.

694
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,180
And listen, if you print
your story this week...

695
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,700
it might get
some of my men killed.

696
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,340
I can't have that,
Mr. Fletch.

697
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,660
You understand?

698
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,020
Yeah.

699
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,500
I understand.

700
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,900
I got a deadline.

701
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,980
The name's Karlin
with a "K"?

702
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,820
You dipshit!

703
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,820
Go back to that beach,
you won't live to regret it!

704
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,460
All right?

705
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,420
Hey, you and
Tommy Lasorda.

706
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,900
- Yeah.
- I hate Tommy Lasorda.

707
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,540
Hey!

708
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,820
I'll take care of it now.

709
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,700
# Swing low,
sweet chariot #

710
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,100
I'll handle it from here.

711
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,660
# Comin' for
to carry me home ##

712
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,180
Can't keep me here.

713
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,540
Maybe I won't keep you.

714
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,500
Maybe I'll blow
your brains out.

715
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,180
I do believe that's
a violation of my rights.

716
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:16,140
After I shoot you,
I stick myself with this knife...

717
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,220
and place it
in your dead hand.

718
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,500
Self-defense.

719
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:24,020
We don't do it anymore,
but back in the old days...

720
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,580
You're serious.

721
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,620
Ask anybody.

722
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,180
Can I ask anybody now?

723
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,220
Can I call my mom,
tell her I love her.

724
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,300
Uh... guess not.

725
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,260
I'm a newspaper reporter. You don't
blow away newspaper reporters.

726
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,220
Kinda stupid, isn't it?

727
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,980
What will it be, Fletch?

728
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,340
Hey, I hate the beach anyway.

729
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,340
It's not even my story.

730
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,300
I've got a deadline
on the off-track betting...

731
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,820
in the Himalayas.

732
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,300
Smaller story, but I know
you've been following it.

733
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,780
You have things
under control down there.

734
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,780
Your beach.

735
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,500
Come on out.
Come on.

736
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,900
May I? Thank you.

737
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,780
How could you call him?

738
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,060
Fletch, I'm sorry.

739
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,020
You know how close
to death I came?

740
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,860
Yeah, it's awful.

741
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,100
He had a gun at my head
and a knife in his hand!

742
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,940
He threatened
to kill me.

743
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,060
Hey, that's a shame.

744
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,980
He would've shot me.

745
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,060
Unbelievable.

746
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,100
You don't believe me.

747
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,580
Nope.

748
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,580
- He thinks I'm lying.
- Unbelievable.

749
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,780
I need an article
by tomorrow.

750
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,700
- You believe me.
- Yes, I do.

751
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,540
I don't want unsubstantiated charges
about dope-dealing cops...

752
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:11,940
or paranoid fantasies
about homicidal police chiefs.

753
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,020
Give me something
I can print!

754
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,500
Print this.

755
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,900
Me, too.

756
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,380
Hey, watch it.
You're on thin ice, Larry.

757
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,580
It was time to hang out
at Boyd Aviation...

758
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,020
to find out what Stanwyk
was doing with that plane.

759
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,780
I splurged.

760
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,700
I invested 49 cents
on some novelty teeth.

761
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,500
Hey!

762
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,380
- You the guy from Ajax?
- Yeah, you bet.

763
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,460
All right.

764
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,420
- Thought you were bringing the eight?
- They're coming.

765
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,100
I'm the supervisor.
I don't carry the stuff.

766
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,980
Freddie's bringing them?

767
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,460
Yeah. Freddie.

768
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,780
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

769
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,140
Traffic was murder.

770
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,020
A manure spreader
jackknifed on the Santa Ana.

771
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,940
God-awful mess.

772
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,300
You should see my shoes.

773
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,220
Whew!

774
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,300
Stanwyk's baby, huh?

775
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,940
Yeah.

776
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,540
Uh-huh.

777
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,380
Looks well-used.

778
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,380
Travels to Utah every weekend.

779
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,180
Is that right?

780
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,860
Is he a Mormon?

781
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,580
I don't think he's doing
a lot of singing...

782
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,740
with the Tabernacle Choir.

783
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,540
These executives live high.
Know what I mean?

784
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,020
I sure do.

785
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,300
That's a terrific wing.
I love this shape.

786
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,620
Do us a favor, pal.

787
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,340
Name's Liddy.
Gordon Liddy.

788
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,220
Take a look
at the seventh Fetzer valve.

789
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,660
It's been sticking.

790
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,740
Probably the humidity.

791
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,340
That's funny.

792
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,740
I think it's
the by-pass line.

793
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,140
It could be the by-pass line.
I should look at it.

794
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,060
Uh, Gordo?

795
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,500
Back here?

796
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,780
Don't tell me
my business, boy!

797
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,460
Just checking the luggage.

798
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,060
Somebody should clean these windows.
There's gook all over 'em.

799
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,780
Look at that.

800
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,820
You use a lot of fuel
to go to Utah?

801
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,420
I ask that, too.

802
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,980
Burns enough to go
to South America and back.

803
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,020
South America and back.

804
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,140
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

805
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,180
I always kid him.
I say:

806
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,500
"You doing some stunt flying
up there or something?"

807
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,340
What's he say?

808
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,580
Nothing.
He just gives me that look.

809
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,700
You know,
he's got that look.

810
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,140
Yeah, he just gives him
that look.

811
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,020
Sure.
He's the boss.

812
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,220
Let me look
at this Fetzer.

813
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,100
Uh, Gord.

814
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,540
I know. I'm getting
a bird's-eye view.

815
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,620
Oh, ho ho.

816
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,740
It's the by-pass line, right?

817
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,780
I think so. Yeah.

818
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,780
Told ya.

819
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,940
I'll need some pliers...

820
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,460
and a set of 30-weight
ball bearings.

821
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,580
- What?
- Yeah.

822
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,100
Tell ya what.
I gotta go to my truck.

823
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,020
If Fred gets here before I'm back,
tell him to start without me.

824
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,980
Why do you need
ball bearings?

825
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,380
Come on, guys.

826
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,100
Maybe you need
a refresher course.

827
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,020
Hey, it's all
ball bearings nowadays.

828
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,740
Prepare that valve
with 3-in-1 oil...

829
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,780
and gauze pads.

830
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,020
And I'll need 10 quarts
of antifreeze...

831
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,940
preferably Prestone.

832
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,860
No, make that
Quaker State.

833
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,540
And wash those windows.
They got muck on 'em.

834
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:19,980
Buenos dias, senor.

835
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,740
Hi. Where's
Mrs. Stanwyk?

836
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,140
In her cabana.

837
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,420
I'm supposed to meet her.
Cabana six?

838
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,500
Cabana one. You would like
something to eat or drink?

839
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,980
Actually, I would.

840
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,940
Charge it
to the Underhills?

841
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,060
Right.
Do you have any caviar?

842
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,740
Si, senor. Beluga.
But it is $80 a portion.

843
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,980
I better just take
two portions.

844
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,900
How's the Lobster Thermidor?

845
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,220
- I recommend it.
- Good. That'll be fine.

846
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,220
Bring two bottles
of Dom Perignon.

847
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,660
Very good, senor.

848
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,620
- Put down $30 for yourself.
- Muchas gracias, senor.

849
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,580
Who is it?

850
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,460
It's John.

851
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,940
John who?

852
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,940
It's John.
John Levin... I don't remember.

853
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,460
John Cocktoastin?

854
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,260
Hi.

855
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,460
Hi.

856
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,420
I was hoping
you'd say that.

857
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,540
I just got out of the shower.

858
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,660
Yeah.
Can I borrow your towel?

859
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:26,020
My car hit
a water buffalo.

860
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,580
Nice place.

861
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,060
I'm surprised to see you.
What are you doing here?

862
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,940
I ordered some lunch.

863
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,140
For here?

864
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,340
I knew this is where
my mouth would be.

865
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,220
I really should change.

866
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,100
No, you should stay
the wonderful person you are today.

867
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,900
I mean put clothes on.

868
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,460
Make yourself comfortable.

869
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,460
Are you always
this forward?

870
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,180
Only with
wet married women.

871
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,300
Get the door!

872
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,100
Ah. Very good, gentlemen.
Come right in.

873
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,700
Right in this way.

874
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,700
Right in here.

875
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,220
That's good.
That's very nice.

876
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,500
Want I set up?

877
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,660
No, I'll take care of it.
Give each other $20.

878
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,380
- Put it on Underhill.
- Muchas gracias.

879
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,460
Sierra del fuego.

880
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,940
Oh, this is beautiful.

881
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,900
There we have it.

882
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,700
This goes
on the Underhills' bill?

883
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,140
I saved his life
during the war.

884
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,020
- You were in the war?
- No, he was. I got him out.

885
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,660
Oh.

886
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,860
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

887
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,300
This is great.

888
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,020
Let's eat.

889
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,940
- Your bill, senor.
- Oh, thank you.

890
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,260
- $400 for lunch?
- Your guest, senor.

891
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,540
We didn't have
any guests today.

892
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,260
Two bottles of Dom Perignon?
$100 a pop!

893
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,340
- Jesus H. Christ! Where is he?
- With Ms. Stanwyk.

894
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,180
- Where's she?
- Cabana one.

895
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,220
Can I ask you a question?

896
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,300
- Depends on the question.
- More champagne?

897
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,700
- Yes.
- Are you still in love with Alan?

898
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,260
No. I mean, no, you can't
ask me that question.

899
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,300
- Ask me another one.
- Why'd you let me in?

900
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,860
Um, because I'm bored.

901
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,340
If you're bored, why didn't you
go to Utah with Alan?

902
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,860
Utah's not exactly
a cure for boredom.

903
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,340
Good point.

904
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:31,140
I've never been there.
I shouldn't say that.

905
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,660
What about his parents?

906
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:35,380
He hasn't seen them for years.
I've never met them.

907
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,260
They don't get along?

908
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,900
- Mrs. Stanwyk.
- Yes?

909
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,900
I'm sorry to disturb you.
It's Ted Underhill.

910
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,540
Thanks for a great time.
I... Whew! ...gotta go.

911
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,340
Wait a minute.
What is this?

912
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,060
Someone of
your acquaintance...

913
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,580
has charged a $400 lunch
to my account.

914
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,540
You don't know
the Underhills?

915
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,340
I'd like to discuss this matter
with you.

916
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,180
I'm just out of the shower.

917
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,140
- Wait a minute.
- I have to wee-wee.

918
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,700
Yes, of course.

919
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:11,180
- Why did you do it?
- You shouldn't have to pay the bill.

920
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,340
A $400 lunch tab?

921
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,780
It's outrageous.
It's way over the line.

922
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,580
I'll cover it. You can't
go out looking like that.

923
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,580
He might spot you.
Hold on.

924
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,180
You look like you're the same size
as Alan. Put this on.

925
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,340
- Nice suit.
- Just return it.

926
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,300
Any other surprises?

927
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,860
Yeah.

928
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,100
My name is not
John Cocktoastin.

929
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,340
- I wasn't at your wedding.
- Who are you?

930
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,020
I'm Erwin Fletcher.

931
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:46,180
I write a newspaper column
under the name of Jane Doe.

932
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,180
So?

933
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,620
So...

934
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,140
your husband
hired me to kill him.

935
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,420
Mrs. Stanwyk.

936
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,300
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- In a minute!

937
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,380
Enough surprises.
What are you talking about?

938
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,980
Sit down.

939
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,780
Your husband told me he was dying
of cancer. Is that true?

940
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,900
It's not true.

941
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:16,620
That property you thought
you were buying in Utah? Not true.

942
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,020
He's a bad guy.

943
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,340
He's involved in something
very big and very bad.

944
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,020
Do you know Jim Swarthout?

945
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,500
Yeah. He's the man
who sold us the ranch.

946
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:30,420
Wrong. He sold you
$3,000 worth of scrub brush.

947
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,140
I saw the deed.

948
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,700
You saw a forgery.

949
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,580
This is the real deed.

950
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,300
There's Swarthout's name.

951
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,660
If this were legible,
you'd see what I meant.

952
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,100
This dog tried to bite me.

953
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,100
The motel, my car.

954
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,860
The Mormon Tabernacle.

955
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,140
Stop it. Stop.

956
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,180
He's told me a lot of things.

957
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:57,300
So far, not one has been true.

958
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,260
I'm sorry to have to
tell you these things.

959
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,380
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- Just wait a minute!

960
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,500
- I'll call my father. He'll know.
- No, you can't.

961
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:09,380
I know you don't know me,
but you've gotta trust me.

962
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,460
Give me 24 hours.

963
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,380
Mrs. Stanwyk!

964
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,500
You a Laker fan?

965
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,860
No.

966
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:25,260
- Just a minute!
- I'll take you to a game.

967
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,540
Mrs. Stanwyk!

968
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:32,300
Sorry. Thanks. Bye.

969
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:36,540
- What are you talking about?
- I'd like to take you to a Laker game.

970
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:40,180
- If you need me, call the paper.
- What do I do for 24 hours?

971
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,180
- Act natural.
- I was afraid you'd say that.

972
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:19,100
Oh, Jesus. What's he
doing with the chief?

973
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,140
Seeing Bone Cancer
and Chief Karlin together...

974
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,380
might lead
to a page one item.

975
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,700
but without real evidence,
Frank wouldn't print it.

976
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,660
I had to keep digging...
without a shovel.

977
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,540
Smog Patrol.
Had your emissions checked?

978
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,340
- No, sir.
- Fluorocarbons? Ozone?

979
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,540
- No, sir.
- Well, let's check it out.

980
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,340
What do you say?

981
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,380
Smells pretty good.

982
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,500
That's him.

983
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,100
Unit 12, in pursuit.

984
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,820
Catch some shuteye.
Lay back and enjoy.

985
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,780
- Try to breathe through your nose.
- Aaah!

986
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:01,020
I use chewing gum on these rides.
It filters out the pollutants.

987
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,380
Aw, shit!

988
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,780
You've got good grillwork.
Keep out the ozone.

989
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:08,460
I gotta get this thing up to 95,
check out the fluorocarbon output.

990
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,860
Don't worry about the speed limit.
That's why we've got the police escort.

991
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,900
- You a cop?
- As far as you know.

992
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,180
You gonna take me to jail
for car theft?

993
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,660
- Why, did you steal the car?
- I sure did!

994
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,580
I'm not even sure
that's a crime anymore.

995
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,020
Pull over!

996
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,500
Hey, look out
for that truck!

997
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,180
Just a game I play with my buddies.
Hide-and-seek kind of thing.

998
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,620
They love it.

999
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,420
What a day!

1000
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,700
Must be a stage two.

1001
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,580
Do a little slip-streaming.

1002
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,740
Whoa! There's Fred!
Won't he be surprised!

1003
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,660
Don't you hear me?
I said pull over...

1004
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,140
Uh-oh.

1005
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,380
Got a license?

1006
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,180
Not on me.
You have one?

1007
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,540
- No.
- Pull over, buddy!

1008
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:25,620
- Hey, Freddie, how's the herpes?
- Pull over!

1009
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,940
- I did before. I'll pull over later.
- Pull over!

1010
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:32,580
That's it.
Turn your bike in!

1011
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,020
- You're a disgrace to the force!
- Aaah!

1012
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:55,020
Get the door!

1013
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,980
Congratulations.
You passed the test.

1014
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,060
Raise your left hand.
My men will be right with you.

1015
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:44,940
Thelma Noble, Ellis Lee Hereford...

1016
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,860
Lee Weaver...

1017
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,340
and Harold Arthur.

1018
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:53,020
I would like for you to meet
our friends on the dais.

1019
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:57,300
- Hold your applause until I'm finished.
- More coffee?

1020
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,420
- Kitty Domaine, Selby Desner.
- There you go.

1021
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,220
Barbara Wattell,
Walter Smith...

1022
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,460
Martha Sterling
and Paul Fleming.

1023
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:09,540
And to my right,
Michael Kenyon...

1024
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,300
Olivia D. Williams...

1025
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,180
Otto Bailey...

1026
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,900
Bea Dorfman.

1027
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,460
And now...

1028
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:21,420
the Father of
Internal Bushings...

1029
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,980
our very own
and beloved leader...

1030
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,460
A man who needs
no introduction!

1031
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:27,620
Thank you very much, Sammy.

1032
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,100
I couldn't wait.

1033
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:31,820
That was a very nice introduction,
and I am...

1034
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,700
very thrilled
and proud to be here.

1035
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:38,100
It's been a wonderful ceremony
here on behalf of our own Fred...

1036
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,460
"The Dorf" Dorfman!

1037
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:46,220
- Who is he?
- Fred was darn near death recently.

1038
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,980
He wasn't ashamed to admit to me
that he had syphilis.

1039
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:52,900
Thank God he stopped it
in its tracks.

1040
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,660
It takes a lot for a man...

1041
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,900
to admit where he got it from
and how he got it.

1042
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:03,700
Look at him today.
Fred, you look just wonderful.

1043
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,980
The nose looks normal again.
The face has come back into shape.

1044
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,540
It's not drooling anymore.

1045
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:13,060
And hats off to Marge, his wife,
because that whole experience...

1046
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:16,420
the three weeks that she stayed
at Trembling Hills has paid off.

1047
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,620
No more alcohol
or sedatives in her life.

1048
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:22,300
There are many other things
I wanna tell you about Fred...

1049
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:25,780
things that maybe many of you
already know.

1050
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,020
Sammy, you're not going
to sing for us, are you?

1051
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:33,060
Did you know that Fred
spent much of his life...

1052
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:37,460
honoring a profession that has gone
largely unsung around here?

1053
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,220
Some of them are here tonight.
The profession is law enforcement.

1054
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:45,100
I know Fred feels that too often
our feelings are locked in...

1055
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,540
and we feel restrained
and perhaps even embarrassed...

1056
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:50,060
to reach out and touch
an officer of the law.

1057
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,620
After all, they are people,
aren't they?

1058
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,260
Stand up. Pat them on the back.
Reach out.

1059
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:59,660
Shake hands with any one
of these men in blue.

1060
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:02,100
Hug a cop!
Yeah, go ahead. I said it.

1061
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,820
Yeah!
That's a wonderful feeling!

1062
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,820
I'm so proud tonight!

1063
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,420
# Oh, say can you see #

1064
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:15,780
# By the dawn's
early light #

1065
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:20,100
# What so proudly we hail #

1066
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:22,420
# At the twilight's
last gleaming ##

1067
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,140
Hip, hip, hooray!

1068
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,020
Hooray!
Hooray!

1069
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,340
Hooray!
Hooray!

1070
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:37,900
Mr. Stanwyk,
you are confirmed on Flight 441...

1071
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:41,100
to Rio de Janeiro tomorrow evening,
11 p.m., first class.

1072
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,300
That's terrific.
Thank you.

1073
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,780
- You reconfirmed this morning.
- You bet I did.

1074
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,780
I'm a bear for detail.

1075
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,020
I hope there's nobody
sitting next to me.

1076
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:53,740
I always travel first class,
and I take both seats up.

1077
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:56,580
I'm in bridge work.
Bridge construction.

1078
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:59,940
These fold-outs
take a lot of space.

1079
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,780
There is someone
next to you.

1080
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:06,380
Oh, for God don don!
Who is it? Mr. Singleton?

1081
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:11,060
- No. The name is Cavanaugh.
- Cavanaugh?

1082
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,460
Ah! Morris or Pierre?

1083
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,940
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1084
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,020
Sally Ann?
Well, terrific.

1085
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,820
In fact, you purchased
the ticket for Miss Cavanaugh.

1086
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:23,580
Doesn't mean I want her
sitting next to me.

1087
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,020
The flight's full.
She's connecting out of Provo.

1088
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,140
Oh. All right, fine.

1089
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:33,220
Provo, Spain?

1090
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,900
Utah.

1091
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,100
Utah.

1092
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:39,780
Frank, don't give me crap
about the beach story.

1093
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:42,500
- I'm at the airport.
- The airport?

1094
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,740
There are two dozen cops
after my ass.

1095
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:48,220
I can't go home or to the office.
I'm a man without a country.

1096
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:51,860
If cops are really after you,
come in here. You'll be OK.

1097
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,820
I couldn't
get through the front door.

1098
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,500
I'm going to Utah.

1099
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,940
You go to Utah,
you stay in Utah.

1100
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,260
I'm turning the story over
to a professional reporter.

1101
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,900
The story is Utah.
Trust me.

1102
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:07,860
You're going to Utah?
Fine.

1103
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,820
If you're story is not on my desk
by 11:30, you're fired.

1104
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,900
Cujo?

1105
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,180
Who the hell are you?

1106
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,780
Get up!

1107
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,380
I'm up.

1108
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,340
- Door was unlocked.
- Lock's busted.

1109
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:59,660
There you have it.

1110
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:03,180
I work for the landlord.

1111
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:05,900
He told me to watch out
for the place.

1112
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:08,740
- I commend him on his choice.
- What?

1113
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,620
I commend him
on his choice.

1114
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,220
I was supposed to meet
Mrs. Cavanaugh here.

1115
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,420
Who are you?

1116
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:19,820
I'm Don Corleone,
Mrs. Cavanaugh's cousin.

1117
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:21,860
You know where she is?

1118
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,260
Moved out.

1119
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:27,260
Moved out?
Isn't that something.

1120
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:30,180
I talked to her last week.
She didn't say a thing about it.

1121
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:32,420
- She moved out.
- You're saying she moved out.

1122
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:35,660
- This morning.
- This morning?

1123
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:39,020
God! Uh. We had
so much to talk about.

1124
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,300
Mo Green is out
of the Tropicana.

1125
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,740
My sons, Mike and Fredo,
are taking over.

1126
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:47,700
What did you
want under the bed?

1127
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,380
I have to pull rank on you.
I didn't want to have to do this.

1128
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:58,260
I'm with the mattress police.
There are no tags on these mattresses.

1129
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,220
I'm taking you downtown.
Give me the weapon.

1130
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,540
I'm calling the cops.

1131
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:09,060
- This is for the cops.
- Come on, man. I'm her cousin.

1132
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,420
Tell the cops.

1133
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,540
OK. You wanna call the cops,
call the cops.

1134
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,900
Better tie
your shoelaces first.

1135
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:43,340
Thanks a lot!

1136
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,420
Stretch, what's happening?

1137
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,220
- Got an unbelievable story here.
- Yeah? Great.

1138
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,620
- What can I do?
- Write this down. Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1139
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,580
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1140
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:03,380
Check every hotel in L.A.
Start near the airport.

1141
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,580
He's supposed to leave the country
with her tomorrow night.

1142
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,140
Got that, honey?

1143
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:09,220
I love your body, Larry.

1144
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,660
Good afternoon.

1145
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:29,580
Howdy.

1146
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,580
They should
recall these things.

1147
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:35,100
Hit one bump
and the window explodes.

1148
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,660
You're Marvin Stanwyk?

1149
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,140
- Yeah.
- Hi there.

1150
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,740
Harry S. Truman,
Casewell Insurance underwriters.

1151
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:42,180
Harry S. Truman?

1152
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:45,260
My parents were fans
of the former president.

1153
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,900
Isn't that nice.
He was a good man.

1154
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:50,260
- He sure was.
- He showed the Japs a thing or two.

1155
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:53,220
- Dropped the big one, huh?
- He dropped two big ones on them.

1156
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,300
- He was a real fighter.
- Yeah.

1157
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,980
You're in insurance, Harry?

1158
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,620
That's right.

1159
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:03,100
- Well, I'm fully covered.
- I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk.

1160
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:06,580
Actually, my company
sub-insures a policy...

1161
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:09,940
held by Alan Stanwyk,
who I believe is your son.

1162
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,340
Yeah, he is.

1163
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,780
Mr. Truman,
meet my wife Velma.

1164
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,620
- My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

1165
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:18,340
Sit down and have
a glass of lemonade.

1166
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:21,700
- Thank you.
- Velma makes the most unusual lemonade.

1167
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:24,820
It's hard to keep it cold
on a day like this.

1168
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,620
Where you from, Harry?

1169
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,740
I'm from California.

1170
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:33,660
San Berdoo.

1171
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,460
Yeah. Utah is
part of my route.

1172
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:42,060
You folks don't mind if I ask you
a couple of questions, do you?

1173
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,460
- Shoot.
- Thank you very much.

1174
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,900
We'll start with
some routine things.

1175
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,180
You and your wife
are currently alive, I take it?

1176
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:55,060
- Harry, if there's...
- It's just regulations.

1177
01:13:56,620 --> 01:14:00,580
Now, you, Marvin,
and your wife named Velma...

1178
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:05,380
are the parents of one Alan Stanwyk
of Beverly Hills...

1179
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:07,540
Executive Vice President
of Boyd Aviation.

1180
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,420
- Check.
- Check.

1181
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,460
And when did you last see Alan?

1182
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,660
Oh... uh...

1183
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,180
about 10 days ago.

1184
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,620
10 days ago?

1185
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:21,100
He comes and visits
about every three weeks.

1186
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:25,940
Isn't that nice.
How long has he done that?

1187
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,620
Since he moved to L.A.

1188
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:37,420
Pardon me if I seem a bit personal here.
I don't know how to put it.

1189
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:42,540
We understand that there's
a young lady friend in Provo...

1190
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,340
that Alan's been seeing.

1191
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,380
What's this got to do
with insurance?

1192
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:48,780
This is a comprehensive policy.

1193
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:51,180
Forget about
that lady friend business.

1194
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,900
Alan is
a loving husband.

1195
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:55,860
He dotes on his bride.

1196
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:57,300
Who?

1197
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,980
His wife.

1198
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,660
You've met her?

1199
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,220
Of course we have.
He brings her with him.

1200
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,180
Has Alan ever mentioned
the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh?

1201
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:14,660
Has he?

1202
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:20,780
Boy, what in the hell's
the matter with you?

1203
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:23,020
- He has.
- Of course he has.

1204
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,340
That's his wife.

1205
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,460
Of course.

1206
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:30,020
His wife's name
is Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1207
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,020
Cute as a button.

1208
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,940
You wouldn't have
a picture of them, would you?

1209
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,060
We've got lots of pictures.

1210
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:40,180
- Let me get you some.
- Great.

1211
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,060
Still married are they,
Alan and Sally Ann?

1212
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:45,420
Yes, they are.

1213
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,460
How long have
they been married?

1214
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:51,340
It was before
he moved to L.A.

1215
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,340
Eight years April.

1216
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,460
This gets heavier
each year.

1217
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,820
There we are.
Here it is.

1218
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:01,100
- That's the one.
- Oh, my goodness.

1219
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,340
She is a button,
isn't she?

1220
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:04,900
Isn't she cute?

1221
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:08,420
Could I borrow this picture?
I promise to send it back.

1222
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:12,220
- It's routine. The actuarial people...
- That's all right. We have more.

1223
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,260
- Want to see the reception?
- No, thank you. I'm trying to quit.

1224
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:17,300
How about Marvin's
65th birthday party?

1225
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:20,340
- How about that, Marvin?
- They got a picture of me in here.

1226
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,140
This is Alan?
I can't believe this!

1227
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,500
It's really Alan,
and it's really bigamy.

1228
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:30,500
- How long have they been married?
- About eight years.

1229
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:31,620
Who is this woman?

1230
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:35,180
I think it's Alan's
high school sweetheart.

1231
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:38,020
Sally Ann something or other.

1232
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:42,100
Alan's been keeping
many secrets lately.

1233
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,700
I'm calling the police.

1234
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,220
No, Gail, don't.

1235
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:48,420
- I'm calling my father.
- Give me one more day.

1236
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:52,140
Why? Do you have any idea
how humiliating this is?

1237
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:54,260
Yes, I do.
I really do.

1238
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:59,940
Remember what I told you?
Tomorrow night you have a club meeting.

1239
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:02,860
Stay away from the house.
I'll take care of him.

1240
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,900
- Don't worry.
- She looks like a hooker.

1241
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:08,140
Look at her. Could you love
someone who looked like that?

1242
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,100
What are you talking about?
Of course not.

1243
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,220
5, 10 minutes tops,
maybe.

1244
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,980
It's funny.

1245
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,820
I know. Listen.

1246
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:25,460
Why don't we relax and lie down
and I'll fill you in.

1247
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,660
This is a good time
to make a pass at me.

1248
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:03,220
- Gum?
- Who? Go somewhere else.

1249
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,260
Gum, it's me.

1250
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,740
- Fletch. Really, is that you?
- Shut up. Don't say my name.

1251
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:12,660
Shut up. Don't look at me.
I gotta talk to you.

1252
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,820
All right. About what?

1253
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:18,820
There are cops all around here.
They're after me.

1254
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,860
- You mean those surfers over there?
- Lay back down.

1255
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,580
- Don't point. Just lay back.
- OK.

1256
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:27,900
- Why they after you?
- I'm a newspaper reporter.

1257
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,700
I'm nailing Chief Karlin as
the major drug source on this beach.

1258
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:35,220
Sit back.

1259
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:39,140
Fat Sam's turning
State's evidence.

1260
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,660
What's that?

1261
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:43,620
He wrote me
a nice deposition.

1262
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,620
Said he received the drugs
and you did the selling.

1263
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:49,060
He said what?
Fletch, he's lying.

1264
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,060
I didn't sell nothing.
You gotta believe me.

1265
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,980
I just carried the drugs
from the chief to Sam.

1266
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:58,380
- Sure you did, Gum.
- Honest, man. That's all I did.

1267
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:02,860
20 years in prison, Gum.
Unless you want to play ball.

1268
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,580
You don't leave me
much choice.

1269
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,660
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1270
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:18,060
These robes...
I got another question.

1271
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,700
Where does the chief
get his drugs?

1272
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,060
I don't know.

1273
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:26,180
Have fun.
Don't bend over for the soap.

1274
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,620
Fletch.
Fletch, OK.

1275
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,940
It's somewhere
in South America.

1276
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,620
Mind if I sit here?

1277
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,020
Fletch?

1278
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:41,620
Man...

1279
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,420
- You don't know me, Sam.
- My pleasure, brother.

1280
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,260
I'm a reporter, Sam.

1281
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:49,700
I'm breaking the story
on the drug traffic around here.

1282
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:51,380
Gummy's turning
State's evidence.

1283
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,740
I got good proof
it's the chief.

1284
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,700
You gonna bust the chief?

1285
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:57,460
Gonna bust the chief.

1286
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,460
I could use your help.

1287
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:07,060
I'm a slave to that
son of a bitch.

1288
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,260
He busted me,
third offense.

1289
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:13,700
Said push for him or do 15 long.
All I get from this is free junk.

1290
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:16,420
- You don't have a piece of the action?
- No. Free junk, that's it.

1291
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,620
Hey, how you doing?

1292
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:26,700
Albert Einstein's forehead.
You like it? Won it in a raffle.

1293
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,900
Fellas, stay with me.

1294
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,980
Fletch?

1295
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,420
What's up?

1296
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:35,540
- I'm quitting at midnight.
- Who are they?

1297
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:38,460
This is Fat Sam and Gummy.
Come with me.

1298
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:40,420
Their statements
name Chief Karlin...

1299
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,020
as the number one drug pusher
from here to Oxnard.

1300
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,780
I want them to have Federal protection
sponsored by the paper. OK?

1301
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,420
- This is wonderful.
- I'm out, Frank.

1302
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:55,420
- You lost faith in me.
- Fletch, I got nervous.

1303
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,580
Forget it.
I'm writing the story.

1304
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,940
Hold the last two paragraphs
till 10:00.

1305
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:02,380
You want an apology?

1306
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:04,900
- You were going to can me, right?
- No, not really.

1307
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:08,300
- Not really?
- I was upset. You know.

1308
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:14,060
OK. Jesus,
I'm sick of this place.

1309
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:15,180
Ow.

1310
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:18,820
I'll try out for the Lakers.
They need a power forward.

1311
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:21,540
This is a hell of a story.

1312
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,580
Thanks.

1313
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:24,740
- About these guys...
- They're fine.

1314
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,780
You don't have valuables
in there, do you?

1315
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,620
Good evening.

1316
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:49,300
I like your outfit.

1317
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:51,300
Did you bring the 50 grand
and the tickets?

1318
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,220
Of course.

1319
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:56,340
Oh, oh, oh. You forgot
your rubber gloves.

1320
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,820
You're planning
on killing me, aren't you?

1321
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:03,500
You catch on real quick,
Mr. Nugent.

1322
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,620
That's a hostile thing to do.

1323
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:09,660
You were gonna kill me.
I look at this as self-defense.

1324
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:13,580
Now, if you would be so kind
as to put your passport on my desk.

1325
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:20,020
You're wearing my suit.
Where did you get that?

1326
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:24,260
Where did you get my suit,
Mr. Nugent?

1327
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:27,020
The name's Fletcher.
I'm a newspaper reporter.

1328
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,060
I write a column
under the name Jane Doe.

1329
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:32,500
- What is this?
- Read this.

1330
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:35,100
- I don't have time...
- Cut the crap.

1331
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,060
Come read this.
I'm not going anywhere.

1332
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:52,780
Unless my people hear differently,
that letter goes out at midnight.

1333
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:02,820
"Dear Mr. Boyd:

1334
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:04,860
Alan Stanwyk
murdered me tonight.

1335
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:10,980
Charred remains found in the Jaguar
are mine, not his.

1336
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,060
Mr. Stanwyk,
using my name and passport...

1337
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:16,180
boarded Pan Am Flight 306.

1338
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,180
- On arrival, he intends..."
- Pretty hefty.

1339
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,860
Keep reading.

1340
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:24,300
"...with his legal wife...

1341
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:26,340
the former
Sally Ann Cavanaugh..."

1342
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,900
Don't stop, Alan.

1343
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:35,620
- Uh-oh. The missus.
- What are you doing here?

1344
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:38,340
I know most of it. I want
to hear the rest from you.

1345
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,900
He doesn't read my stuff very well.
Let me take a crack at it.

1346
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:46,020
"Sally Ann and Alan
were married eight years ago...

1347
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,180
never divorced, making Stanwyk
a bigamist, even in Utah.

1348
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:54,860
Stanwyk is traveling
with $3 million in cash...

1349
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:58,060
the result of Gail Stanwyk's
conversion of Boyd Aviation stock."

1350
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:04,780
It's true, isn't it?

1351
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,700
"Sally Ann
can confirm this...

1352
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:08,660
when the police pick her up
at the Airport Marriott."

1353
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:10,540
Isn't that where she is?

1354
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:14,700
"By the way,
Alan is a big drug smuggler.

1355
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:18,060
But you can read about that
in tomorrow's paper.

1356
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:21,220
Sincerely, I.M. Fletcher.
P.S. Have a nice day."

1357
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:24,460
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Bravo.

1358
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:28,140
What tipped me was something your wife
said while we were in bed together.

1359
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:35,340
Oh?
And what was that?

1360
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:38,780
She said we had roughly
the same build.

1361
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,780
From the waist up,
I imagine.

1362
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:44,700
Then I figured it.

1363
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,780
You bump me off,
plop me in the car...

1364
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:48,260
and burn me up.

1365
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:52,580
What the heck,
same bone structure.

1366
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,180
You son of a bitch.

1367
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:57,020
But I'm not a stupid
son of a bitch.

1368
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:59,540
I was prepared to commit
one murder, assface.

1369
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:02,900
What makes you think
I won't commit two?

1370
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:05,740
- Whoops.
- What do you mean, "Whoops"?

1371
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,300
By the time your story's published,
I'll be on the beach.

1372
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:11,980
I understand extradition
from South America's complicated.

1373
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,020
For two murders,
it's even more so.

1374
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:17,220
That thing loaded?

1375
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:18,700
If you shoot me...

1376
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,820
you're liable to lose
those humanitarian awards.

1377
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,500
Tough shit, Hopalong.

1378
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:23,780
Greetings, everyone.

1379
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,380
Thank God, the police.

1380
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:29,820
What are you doing here?

1381
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,420
Put the gun down.
I can take care of them.

1382
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:35,340
Thought you had this figured out.
Nice going, Erwin.

1383
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:37,580
Don't ever
call me Erwin.

1384
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:40,140
Fat Sam and Gummy
left the beach today.

1385
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:45,140
It occurred to me that maybe there are
things happening I should be aware of.

1386
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:48,420
I'll take care of this.
It doesn't involve you. Go home.

1387
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:50,340
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- What? Long distance?

1388
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:53,700
Overheard you say something
about South American extradition.

1389
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:58,100
Are you taking that $800,000
I staked you with on the next load?

1390
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:00,140
You two have a lot
to talk over.

1391
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:03,140
We'll just catch the last
ten minutes of "Dynasty."

1392
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:05,300
Jerry,
you're gonna have to trust me!

1393
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:08,420
I got a way to get rid of this asshole,
and you're jeopardizing everything!

1394
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:10,500
Your way is gonna land my butt
on the front page...

1395
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:12,260
while you're basking
in the sun!

1396
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:13,860
With your money.

1397
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:30,980
The second one's
going to be more fun.

1398
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,820
Go ahead, make my day.

1399
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,660
Thanks.

1400
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:01,780
No, this is getting absurd.

1401
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:04,580
"One Bob Haldeman wig,
a gorilla suit."

1402
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,500
- A gibbon suit.
- "Tennis shorts.

1403
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,180
leather sneakers,
wrist bands."

1404
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,820
- It's business. I hate tennis.
- What's novelty teeth?

1405
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:14,060
Frank, it's all business.

1406
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,100
"A nun's habit.
Six tubes of Crazy Glue."

1407
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:17,700
That's personal.

1408
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:20,820
- Take it out of my raise.
- You're not getting a raise. Come on.

1409
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:24,500
I would think the D.A. would need
these tickets for evidence.

1410
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:25,700
Not necessarily.

1411
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:27,940
- Not necessarily?
- Larry!

1412
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:32,100
In the court ruling
"U.S. vs. Fishbein"...

1413
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:34,660
a man subjected to
potential incineration...

1414
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,460
while wearing
another man's suit...

1415
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,500
is entitled to $10,000 worth
of airline tickets.

1416
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:42,020
It's an obscure ruling
but very important one to me.

1417
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:46,100
Why don't you say that you want
to take me to Rio with you?

1418
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:49,260
There's a different slant.

1419
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:53,380
The thing is, we haven't
really dated formally.

1420
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:55,340
I take first dates
to Laker games.

1421
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:58,420
I don't want to go
to a Laker game.

1422
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,700
I don't like basketball.

1423
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:02,420
Maybe that's because
you don't understand basketball.

1424
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:05,060
You haven't learned the fundamentals.
The pick and roll.

1425
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:07,020
Sounds like a fast-food chain.

1426
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:08,980
- Reverse stuff.
- That I've done.

1427
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:11,060
I'll bet you have,
you little vixen.

1428
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:13,300
The coroner
had certified Stanwyk dead...

1429
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:15,460
or extremely sleepy.

1430
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:18,980
And Chief Karlin was facing
20 years in the fun house.

1431
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,980
I decided
to accompany Gail to Rio...

1432
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:23,740
and personally assist her
in her grief therapy.

1433
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:27,260
On the beach, I explained basketball
to her, but she didn't grasp it.

1434
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:29,380
- Fletch?
- Call me Erwin.

1435
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:34,540
Why do they bounce
the ball the whole time?

1436
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:37,180
Doesn't it seem
a little childish?

1437
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,460
Well, it may seem that,
but that's called dribbling.

1438
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,980
- "Dribbling"?
- If they stop bouncing the ball...

1439
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:43,700
they get called for traveling.

1440
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:45,900
Traveling. Aha.

1441
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:48,100
That's what they call it
when you don't bounce the ball.

1442
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:50,660
When it came to basketball,
Gail was a loss.

1443
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:52,660
But we had our own version
of one-on-one...

1444
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:56,220
and she thought I was the bravest man
in the world, which I am.

1445
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:59,740
By the way, I charged the vacation to
Mr. Underhill's American Express card.

1446
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:01,100
Want the number?

1447
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:02,540

1461
