1
00:00:31,707 --> 00:00:34,073
<i>All drivers to your cars, please.</i>

2
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,905
<i>All drivers to your cars.</i>

3
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,447
- Distracted?
- No, that's not exactly right.

4
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,287
Your son seems to be interested
in only one thing.

5
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,420
All he talks about, all he seems
capable of thinking about...

6
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,998
...is automobile racing.

7
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:35,068
Well, you know,
his father designs racing cars.

8
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:36,568
And where is your husband?

9
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:40,338
Working. He couldn't be here.

10
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:44,070
Perhaps the apple hasn't fallen
very far from the tree.

11
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:46,412
Is your husband's name Rex?

12
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:49,483
No, that's his older brother, Rex. Why?

13
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,512
This is the test he turned in last week.

14
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,482
Hm.

15
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,040
All right, pencils down.

16
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,654
Take your answer sheets, place it
into the first part of your booklet...

17
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:02,722
...pack up your things
and bring your... to my desk.

18
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:04,822
Speed Racer, slow down!

19
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:20,970
Take it you're ready to go?

20
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:29,279
- How was school?
- Fine.

21
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:31,544
Are you going to the track?
Mom said you were.

22
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,689
You don't have to drop me off.
I could just go with you.

23
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:36,255
- No way.
- Oh, come on.

24
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,985
Take me with you. Come on, please.

25
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,129
I can't, Speed.

26
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:43,730
- Pops would kill me.
- He doesn't have to know.

27
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:46,692
I won't say anything. Nobody will know.

28
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:53,034
Come on, please, Rex.
Please, please, please.

29
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,907
Are you wearing the socks?

30
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:01,372
Hm? Hm?

31
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:05,614
Okay. But if you roll us again,
this'll be the last time.

32
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:07,546
Deal?

33
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:09,156
<i>Deal.</i>

34
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,878
Oh, yeah!

35
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,144
Come on!

36
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,749
Yee-haw!

37
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:40,154
You feel that shimmy? It's your hind legs
trying to outrun your front.

38
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,482
What do I do?

39
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,181
You stop steering and you start driving.

40
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:49,326
This ain't no dead piece of metal.

41
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,467
A car is a living, breathing thing, all right?
She's alive.

42
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:58,428
You can feel her talking to you, telling you
what she wants, what she needs. Listen.

43
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,242
Close your eyes and listen.

44
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,314
They say that Ben Burns drove the final lap
of the Vanderbilt Cup with his eyes closed.

45
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,618
- No way!
- No?

46
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:15,052
Maybe you just can't hear it, then.
Ought to start hitting those books.

47
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:18,488
- No, I hear it!
- Oh, is that so, Mr. Burns?

48
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,561
All right.
Tell me when to punch it for the jump.

49
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,697
- Now?
- Uh-uh.

50
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,332
Now!

51
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,101
Local fan favorite Speed Racer
is gobbling up this track.

52
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:12,771
Let us hope he does not make
the same mistakes that his brother made.

53
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:24,523
Heads up, Speed. Seven o'clock.
I got Snake drafting Pitter-Pat.

54
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:26,422
I got him.

55
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:32,994
I figure he'll slingshot after you
in the next turn.

56
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,201
I'm ready.

57
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,580
Great move, Speed!

58
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,359
All right, watch out
for the dog balls coming up.

59
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:02,894
You may wanna ease off a little.

60
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,959
Not this time, Sparky.

61
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,085
Holy cannoli, Speed.

62
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:29,951
<i>- You know who you're racing?
- Yeah.</i>

63
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,772
Rex is gonna win it, ain't he, Pops?

64
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,638
Nobody's gonna catch him.
He's gonna win it.

65
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:57,808
He's gonna set the course record.
Nobody's gonna stop him.

66
00:07:57,986 --> 00:08:00,921
- Quiet. There's still a lot of race to go.
- No way. It's over.

67
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:05,355
My brother's the best racer in the world.
Everyone else is running for second.

68
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,824
Yeah!

69
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:11,322
I told you to take him out!

70
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:14,593
We're trying, sir, we're trying,
but he's just too fast.

71
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,041
<i>It's unbelievable, folks!</i>

72
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:31,276
No one has seen moves like this since that
remarkable night eight years ago.

73
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:33,683
There's no doubt in my mind.
He's gunning for the record.

74
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:37,721
He is not alone out there,
he is chasing someone.

75
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,053
He is chasing the ghost of Rex Racer.

76
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:51,364
Jeepers, he could do it, Pops.
He could really do it.

77
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:53,939
What if he does it?
What if he does it, Pops?

78
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:58,407
I don't know if I can watch this.

79
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:26,535
There's that Speed Racer.

80
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,075
My daddy told me that his daddy used to
work for the Mishida Motorwerks...

81
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:32,069
...but he quit.

82
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:35,273
My daddy told me that it was
a completely crazy thing to do.

83
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,315
He says the whole family is crazy.

84
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,384
Speed's not crazy.

85
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:40,953
No. He's just dumb.

86
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:43,656
Probably the dumbest kid in the class.

87
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:46,726
Mrs. Waterstraat had me
alphabetize the IRB tests...

88
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:50,063
...and you wouldn't believe
what the retard did.

89
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:04,201
Speed!

90
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:10,913
Speed!

91
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:14,278
Are you all right?

92
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,449
Who are you?

93
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:22,922
I'm Trixie. I'm in your class.

94
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:25,029
Oh, yeah.

95
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,891
Hey, you wanna see my car collection?

96
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:30,662
I'd love to.

97
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,206
Hey, Rex. Hey, Pops.

98
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:42,349
- Hey, Speedy.
- Who's your friend?

99
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,314
Her name's Trixie. She's in my class.

100
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:46,750
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you, young lady.

101
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:50,948
Hey, Pops, a guy told me to
give this to you. Says he was a big fan.

102
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,192
Oh. A fan, is it?

103
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:56,962
Well, it's not every day we get people
with such good taste around here.

104
00:10:57,132 --> 00:11:00,158
- Where is he?
- He was in a hurry, driving a '68 Fendersin.

105
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:02,835
- Sweet set of wheels.
- Let me see that.

106
00:11:15,817 --> 00:11:18,183
Cool beans.

107
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:30,488
No one from these parts will ever forget
the tragic story of Rex Racer.

108
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:35,132
He nearly ruined racing.

109
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:38,067
One of the bravest men
to ever drive a racecar.

110
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:44,177
<i>Can I come with you, Rex?</i>

111
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,971
Not this time, Speedy.

112
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,343
When are you coming back?

113
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:55,115
I don't know. I don't know.

114
00:11:59,127 --> 00:12:01,789
Hey, there's something
I want you to have.

115
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,429
But the Mach 5's your car.

116
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:08,493
Not anymore.

117
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:13,136
Look, Speed...

118
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:20,205
...one day, people might
say things about me.

119
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,345
But no matter what they say...

120
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:24,917
...I just...

121
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,120
Look, I hope you never believe them.

122
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:30,686
I won't.

123
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:34,525
Come here.

124
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,660
So you're quitting?

125
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:45,997
I have to.

126
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,769
No, you don't. This is a choice.
You're selling out.

127
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:53,710
Turning your back
on everything we built here.

128
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,815
I'm done arguing with you, Pops.

129
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,645
Don't you turn your back on me.

130
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,885
You can't tell me what to do.
It's my life to live.

131
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:05,992
You walk out that door now,
you better not ever come back.

132
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:22,739
<i>Rex Racer,
driving the black-and-red Uniron car...</i>

133
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,674
<i>... got into a tangle with Richenbach,
who was favored to win.</i>

134
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,008
<i>That was no tangle.
He took Richenbach out.</i>

135
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,706
<i>Well, we don't know that...</i>

136
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:31,909
<i>... but I imagine the WRL
will be reviewing this crash.</i>

137
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:34,281
<i>That's the third DNF crash
Racer's been in.</i>

138
00:13:34,455 --> 00:13:36,923
<i>- Turn it off, Speed.
- They ought to just suspend him.</i>

139
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:39,525
I don't want you watching this anymore.

140
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:44,258
The trial of Rex Racer shook the World
Racing League to its very foundation.

141
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:46,696
Once a rat, always a rat...

142
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,929
...and in my book,
Rex Racer's nothing but a rat.

143
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:52,436
<i>Did you see that?</i>

144
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:55,633
<i>That will definitely leave a mark.</i>

145
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,370
<i>And Rex Racer nearly took
Yokima's head off with that jump.</i>

146
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,446
<i>Hey, there is no doubt in my mind...</i>

147
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:04,051
<i>... that Rex Racer is one of
the dirtiest drivers in the world.</i>

148
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,278
For five years, Rex Racer took orders
from the criminal underworld.

149
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:15,853
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

150
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,959
No! You stop this!
You stop it right now!

151
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:22,727
I just told him the truth!

152
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,998
His crumbum brother doesn't belong
on a racetrack, he belongs in jail!

153
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:32,338
The indictment brought down the
perennial racing powerhouse, Uniron.

154
00:14:32,513 --> 00:14:36,040
Uniron was linked to the notorious fixer,
Blackjack Benelli.

155
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:37,582
Still in prison today...

156
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:41,882
...Benelli was rumored to be
behind the Casa Cristo tragedy.

157
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,324
<i>This is one of the worst crashes
I have ever s...</i>

158
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,824
<i>How could this happen? This is terrible.</i>

159
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,524
<i>This is just terrible.</i>

160
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,338
<i>And still no sign of driver Rex Racer.</i>

161
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:04,740
Oh.

162
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:09,315
I know.

163
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:21,393
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

164
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,666
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

165
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,144
"Forget the past," he's saying.
"This is my night!"

166
00:15:56,097 --> 00:15:58,122
- He's coming hard.
- It's gonna be close!

167
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:22,153
<i>Unbelievable!
A split second late. The record still stands.</i>

168
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,600
Come on, let's go. Victory Lane.

169
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:38,705
<i>Folks, I knew Rex Racer, and if he's up
there somewhere watching this race...</i>

170
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:43,401
<i>... you can bet your ass
he's damn proud of his little brother.</i>

171
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,305
<i>Pulling into
Victory Lane, the winner, Speed Racer!</i>

172
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:50,781
He's going to be very good.

173
00:16:51,786 --> 00:16:54,550
No, he's going to be the best...

174
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:59,124
...if they don't destroy him first.

175
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:37,558
Hi-ya!

176
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:40,498
KEN:

177
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:43,027
Ha! Ha! Ha!

178
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,071
Hey, hey! What are you two doing?

179
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:49,700
Nothing.

180
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:52,607
Was that the same nothing
that broke my last couch?

181
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:55,538
No, that was a totally different nothing.

182
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:57,976
Got it!

183
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,314
<i>- Racer residence.
- Morning.</i>

184
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:03,480
<i>- May I speak to Speed Racer?
- He's not interested.</i>

185
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:04,784
Spritle?
- What?

186
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,449
Was that for Speed?

187
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,061
Yeah, but Speed
doesn't wanna talk to them.

188
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,254
You don't know that.

189
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:14,094
Sure, I do. Speed's gotta drive for Pops.
He's gotta.

190
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:15,792
Well, that's for Speed to decide.

191
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,096
Now get dressed.

192
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:19,899
- Tell your father breakfast is ready.
- Ooh.

193
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:21,902
"It was a virtuoso display of talent...

194
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:24,704
...which has not been seen
since Racer the elder...

195
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:26,608
...dropped jaws eight years ago.

196
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:29,841
As we once again pull our collective
jaw up from the floor, we ask:

197
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:33,509
- 'Will it be different or will tragedy...?"'
- That's enough.

198
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,715
I can't believe there's not one mention
of Racer Motors in here.

199
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:40,588
That's because the sponsors
control the media, Sparky.

200
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:42,695
Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

201
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:45,559
- Is Speed up yet?
- In spirit, anyway.

202
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,262
Oh, thanks.

203
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,460
- Hey, superstar.
- Hey, Trix.

204
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:52,466
Have you seen the papers?
They're all in love with you.

205
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,130
Really?

206
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:58,335
Yeah. There seems to be a lot of speculation
about which team you'll sign with.

207
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:01,444
Really?

208
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:05,414
- What the...?
- Earthquake! Earthquake!

209
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:09,454
Quick, Pops! The kitchen is the most
dangerous place in an earthquake.

210
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,659
- Everybody, run for your life!
- Spritle, calm down!

211
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:26,963
Mr. Racer, morning.

212
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:28,632
What?

213
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,104
Oh, um, may I?

214
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,804
Oh!

215
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:42,684
Mr. and Mrs. Racer,
I hope you will forgive this imposition.

216
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:45,985
These are bluebells from Eden, Inc.

217
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,392
I'm told they'll bloom at least three times,
each time a different color.

218
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,361
And Mr. Racer, these are for you.

219
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:56,803
Straight from the Isle of Kamut,
hand-rolled, premium blend.

220
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:59,496
Thanks, but who are you?

221
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:02,874
I am E.P. Arnold Royalton, Esquire...

222
00:20:03,044 --> 00:20:05,512
...president and chairman
of Royalton Industries.

223
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,807
And it is my honor to meet you both.

224
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:13,416
Oh, dear, I seem to have
interrupted your breakfast.

225
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,418
Is that pancakes I smell?

226
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:18,989
Oh, are you hungry, Mr. Royalton?

227
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,459
A figure like mine requires
constant attention, Mrs. Racer.

228
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,029
And do you like pancakes?

229
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,233
When I was a child, we used to say:

230
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,703
Pancakes are love.

231
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:41,609
Mm. Mm.

232
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,208
Gorgeous, Mrs. Racer.

233
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,715
Superb density. Hints of vanilla.
Cinnamon?

234
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:53,185
- That's right.
- Absolutely gorgeous.

235
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,763
- Well, I'm glad you like them.
- Like them? I wanna buy your recipe.

236
00:20:57,932 --> 00:21:01,459
- Oh! I'll give you the recipe, Mr. Royalton.
- Nonsense!

237
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,195
Cenestro Foods, a subdivision
of Royalton Industries...

238
00:21:04,371 --> 00:21:07,067
...is planning a range
of homecooked meals for travelers...

239
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:09,801
...and this is just the kind of magic
we're looking for.

240
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,309
I'll have my attorney
draw up the paperwork.

241
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,604
Hmm.

242
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:18,680
Now, then, we all know the reason
I'm here is because of you, Speed.

243
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:20,582
I was watching last night...

244
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:24,714
...and I have to tell you, young man,
you gave me goose bumps.

245
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:30,621
I knew at once this was no mere driver
I was watching. This was an artist.

246
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:32,493
Oh...

247
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:36,164
I imagine the phone's
been ringing off the hook.

248
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:40,635
Yeah. But Speed doesn't wanna
drive for you or any other sponsors.

249
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:42,704
Is this your manager, then?

250
00:21:42,877 --> 00:21:46,142
- That's our youngest, Spritle.
- Nice to meet you, youngster.

251
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:49,478
We got our eye on you, mister.

252
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:52,916
Excellent.

253
00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:57,414
The first thing I want to make clear
is that I have no intention whatsoever...

254
00:21:57,591 --> 00:22:00,355
...of trying to get Speed
away from Racer Motors.

255
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,125
What you have here
is what teams spend years...

256
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:06,664
...and millions of dollars
trying to achieve, chemistry.

257
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:08,859
I wouldn't dare touch a thing.

258
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:13,370
Well, excuse me for asking,
but what do you want?

259
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:15,839
To help.

260
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,946
I want to make sure you have access
to whatever resources you need...

261
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:22,344
...to continue doing
exactly what you're doing.

262
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:26,350
No offense, Royalton, but Racer Motors
has always run as an independent.

263
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:29,278
None taken. I completely understand.
I sympathize.

264
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:32,482
- Strike that. I empathize.
- Hmm.

265
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,390
You may think of R.I.
as a huge corporate conglomerate...

266
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,623
...but I will have you know
I still remember working all night...

267
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,565
...on a Commodore 64 in the basement
of my foster parents' home.

268
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,762
I built R.I. from below the ground up.

269
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,535
So while Royalton Industries
may look like a major sponsor to you...

270
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,577
...it remains in my heart
as independent to me...

271
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:57,843
...as the first day I quit my job at GloBoCom
to start working for myself.

272
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:01,047
Now, then...

273
00:23:01,689 --> 00:23:07,184
...I've had this wonderful opportunity
to meet your family.

274
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:11,760
All I'm asking for is the chance
to introduce you to mine.

275
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,066
I've never flown so low through the city.

276
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:26,944
Special permit.
Only six of them are granted a year.

277
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:34,418
Take whatever you like.

278
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:36,188
Thank you.

279
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,522
Spritle!
- What? She said we could have some.

280
00:23:42,162 --> 00:23:44,824
All right, maybe one apiece.

281
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,098
Hey, look,
that's the Grand Prix Colosseum.

282
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,465
My brother's gonna win
the Grand Prix someday.

283
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,971
No doubt in my mind, young man.

284
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,635
Given the right circumstances,
no doubt in my mind whatsoever.

285
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,269
This is Gennie, our talent manager.

286
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:26,736
Ask for anything.
Her job is to make it come true.

287
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:29,432
Hello, Speed. Welcome to Royalton.

288
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,081
- What's this?
- To make an informed decision...

289
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,980
...you'll have to understand
how we take care of our drivers.

290
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,819
All aboard.

291
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:42,979
Oh, cool!

292
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:56,596
Royalton Tower is the crown jewel
among the properties that I control.

293
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,866
It functions as the corporate headquarters
for the top 12 divisions of our parent corp.

294
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:04,369
One big industrious family.

295
00:25:07,481 --> 00:25:11,110
Our vertically integrated plant
is the fastest in the world...

296
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:15,722
...from initial carbon bond to finished car
in 36 hours.

297
00:25:18,993 --> 00:25:21,086
How long does it take at Racer Motors?

298
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:23,354
- Mmm...
- Several weeks, at least.

299
00:25:24,832 --> 00:25:28,666
This kind of production facility
could be at your disposal, Mr. Racer.

300
00:25:28,836 --> 00:25:29,860
Hm. Yeah.

301
00:25:30,337 --> 00:25:31,929
This is our operating theater...

302
00:25:32,106 --> 00:25:36,600
...where our patented Refusion Distributor
is installed in the turbine drive.

303
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:38,506
Is that an Inner-Positive Transponder?

304
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:42,206
We control the only transponder foundry
in the world...

305
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,813
...outside of Musha Motors.

306
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,716
Oops. Sorry, trade secret.

307
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:53,952
As you know, a T-180 driver's
got to be in peak physical condition.

308
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:57,586
No expense is spared to ensure that
when our drivers suit up...

309
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:02,300
...they are as perfectly tuned as
the machines they are controlling.

310
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:06,166
The best drivers must be able
to withstand over four G's of force...

311
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,365
...in a typical race.

312
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:12,145
The will to win is nothing
without the will to prepare.

313
00:26:14,314 --> 00:26:19,718
And at Team Royalton,
we prepare our drivers for any eventuality...

314
00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:22,952
...and every possible condition.

315
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,293
I hope I didn't scare you, Speed,
with how hard we push our team.

316
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,265
I just wanted you to see
how committed we are to winning.

317
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,505
- I get that.
- Good.

318
00:26:40,674 --> 00:26:44,576
Because I also want you to understand
that R.I. isn't all work and no play.

319
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:01,725
That's Cannonball Taylor.

320
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,830
Stop the car. Jack.

321
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,793
Jack, come here.

322
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:11,670
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

323
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,836
Speed Racer.

324
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,306
Allow me to introduce
two-time Grand Prix winner...

325
00:27:17,478 --> 00:27:21,471
...five-time WRL Champion
and future hall of famer...

326
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:23,616
...Jack "Cannonball" Taylor.

327
00:27:23,784 --> 00:27:26,014
Oh... Honor to meet you.

328
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,050
Caught that Thunderhead replay.

329
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:30,281
Nice piece of work.

330
00:27:30,924 --> 00:27:32,414
Wow.

331
00:27:32,593 --> 00:27:34,220
Thanks.

332
00:27:34,461 --> 00:27:36,656
There was a rumor you might be visiting.

333
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:40,423
It's pretty impressive.

334
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:44,504
Only thing I cared about
was that wall over there.

335
00:27:44,838 --> 00:27:46,203
That's what sold me.

336
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,467
You want to win in this league,
you're talking to the right guy.

337
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:53,174
Thanks, Jack.

338
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:07,359
Sweet!

339
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:11,861
We treat our thoroughbreds
the way they deserve to be treated.

340
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:15,701
- Sweet!
- There's a full maid service, of course...

341
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:19,805
...with personal chef and masseurs
available 24/7.

342
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,402
Sweet!

343
00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:27,013
Thank you.

344
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:33,376
It should be perfect. Try it on.

345
00:28:33,554 --> 00:28:35,317
Mm-hm.

346
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,117
Okay.

347
00:28:42,196 --> 00:28:43,925
So, Mrs. Racer...

348
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:47,865
...what do you think about my family?
Impressed?

349
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:51,699
- You could say that.
- Good.

350
00:28:51,872 --> 00:28:56,002
Because I want you to understand the
possibilities that exist for your son now.

351
00:28:57,177 --> 00:28:58,371
What's wrong, Mr. Racer?

352
00:28:58,812 --> 00:29:03,044
To be honest, Royalton, I'm feeling
more intimidated than impressed.

353
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:05,515
This kind of company scares me.

354
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:08,487
People like you
have way too much money.

355
00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:11,021
When someone gets that kind of money,
they think...

356
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:15,184
...that the rules everybody else plays by
don't mean squat to them.

357
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:20,559
However, my sons are the most important
thing I've ever done in my life...

358
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:22,998
...besides marrying my best friend.

359
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:28,233
And if Speed wants us to
figure out some kind of an alliance...

360
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,606
...then you can bet your ass
we'll be in business.

361
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,239
Ah.

362
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,879
Hubba-hubba.

363
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:42,385
- Oh, honey, you look so handsome.
- Yeah?

364
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:45,252
Very sharp, Speed. Suits you perfectly.

365
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:48,292
Regardless of what happens,
I want you to have it as a gift.

366
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,097
Thanks, Mr. Royalton.

367
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:56,095
So how are you feeling, Speed?

368
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,429
It's very...

369
00:29:58,605 --> 00:30:00,163
...impressive.

370
00:30:00,474 --> 00:30:03,739
You think that maybe there's something
that could work out here?

371
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:12,916
I guess I'd like to think about it,
if I could.

372
00:30:13,654 --> 00:30:16,646
This isn't the kind of offer
I go around making every day, son.

373
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,487
No, I understand that, sir.

374
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:25,927
So if I had to give you an answer now,
then to be honest...

375
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:27,464
Stop right there.

376
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:30,034
You're right. You should think about it.

377
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:33,338
I'm sure you're feeling
a bit overwhelmed.

378
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:35,668
You should take a little time...

379
00:30:35,842 --> 00:30:40,836
...think about what you saw and heard here,
and we'll get together early next week.

380
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:44,445
- Deal?
- Deal.

381
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,781
I thought we had a deal.

382
00:30:54,428 --> 00:30:56,157
I thought we were friends.

383
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:03,234
Well, maybe where you come from,
that's how you treat your friends.

384
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:07,629
But around here, we don't take
too kindly to it, do we, fellas?

385
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:10,499
It hurts our feelings.

386
00:31:10,944 --> 00:31:12,468
Problem is...

387
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:15,745
...I like you, Taejo.

388
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,481
And I've got a real soft spot
in my heart...

389
00:31:20,654 --> 00:31:23,179
...for that sister of yours.

390
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:32,596
And normally, under circumstances
such as this...

391
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,234
...we'd be pouring you a nice...

392
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:39,736
...comfortable pair of concrete shoes.

393
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:44,034
But I think I thought of another solution.

394
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,906
How are my babies, huh?

395
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:52,148
Hungry?

396
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:04,993
Ready for seconds?

397
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,823
Boys.

398
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:10,200
No!

399
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,204
Don't worry, it only hurts for a few seconds,
then you'll probably black out.

400
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:15,432
No, please!

401
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:21,381
It'll be hard to drive with skellie hands.

402
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:24,745
No, please.
- You even think about turning rat...

403
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:27,910
...and next time it's your sister
going in there!

404
00:32:37,764 --> 00:32:40,130
- What?
- Someone's tailing us.

405
00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:49,303
- Is it him?
- It could be.

406
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:54,143
- Oh, God.
- It's him!

407
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:07,254
Crush him!

408
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,106
He's out front.

409
00:33:37,257 --> 00:33:38,281
Got you.

410
00:34:25,372 --> 00:34:27,738
- Boss!
- My babies.

411
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:33,679
My babies! Put your finger in there.

412
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:36,375
Do it!

413
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,381
Nice fishies, nice fishes. No, no, no.

414
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:46,955
<i>We can't take another hit, boss!</i>

415
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,526
Aah!
- Pull over.

416
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,392
But don't stop.

417
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,579
Are you hurt?

418
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:17,881
No.

419
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,788
Then get up.

420
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:26,332
Thank you. You saved my life.

421
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:30,731
I didn't save anything worth saving
unless you get smart real fast.

422
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,529
You thought you could
take on the cartel.

423
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:35,800
You can't. Not without help.

424
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,902
I don't know what you're talking about.

425
00:35:39,412 --> 00:35:42,643
You have been on Cruncher Block's leash
for so long...

426
00:35:42,816 --> 00:35:46,115
...maybe you forgot how it feels
to stand up and be a man.

427
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:51,685
The only way you'll ever stop these people
is to bring them to justice.

428
00:35:52,092 --> 00:35:53,753
Justice?

429
00:35:54,461 --> 00:35:56,793
That's a commodity
I don't waste my money on.

430
00:35:57,297 --> 00:35:58,321
Hm.

431
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,529
Get out.

432
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,205
- I'll see you at Fuji.
- You won't finish.

433
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,713
When you lose, if you can still
dial a phone...

434
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,350
...call this number.

435
00:36:19,753 --> 00:36:22,153
You're really considering
signing with Royalton.

436
00:36:22,322 --> 00:36:25,519
- I just said it was tempting.
- Why?

437
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:27,922
Well, they got a really good team.

438
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:32,531
Cannonball Taylor, Maggie Manifold.
They win a lot of majors.

439
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,600
And since when did winning
become so important?

440
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,267
It is important.

441
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:42,931
You gotta win if you wanna keep driving,
and that's what I wanna do.

442
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:47,405
- It's the only thing I really know how to do.
- That's not true.

443
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,016
Come on. I wouldn't have made it
out of high school without your help.

444
00:36:51,184 --> 00:36:53,550
Okay, well, that's true.

445
00:36:54,854 --> 00:37:00,053
But when I'm in a T-180, I don't know,
everything just makes sense.

446
00:37:02,996 --> 00:37:08,161
So are you saying
this doesn't make sense?

447
00:37:09,402 --> 00:37:12,235
Okay, this makes sense too.

448
00:37:12,572 --> 00:37:13,834
Oh.

449
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:15,941
So you like this?

450
00:37:16,643 --> 00:37:19,771
Yeah. This ain't so bad.

451
00:37:21,314 --> 00:37:23,839
I was starting to wonder.

452
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:26,275
Wonder what?

453
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:31,550
Well, with you so busy becoming
Mr. Super-Famous-Racecar-Driver...

454
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:36,025
...I was starting to wonder
if you were still interested in this.

455
00:37:37,731 --> 00:37:40,359
- You know I am.
- Do I?

456
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:42,467
What, like you forgot?

457
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,263
- Maybe I need a reminder.
- A reminder.

458
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:47,268
Sometimes a girl could use a reminder.

459
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,136
You mean like a new igniter
for your helicopter?

460
00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:51,467
Mm-mm.

461
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:55,376
Well, how about a tire burn
that spells out your name?

462
00:37:56,382 --> 00:37:57,406
Warmer.

463
00:37:57,584 --> 00:38:03,147
Maybe at the end of some big race,
when I pull into Victory Lane...

464
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:07,419
...I scoop you up and kiss you,
with thousands of flashbulbs going off.

465
00:38:08,928 --> 00:38:12,830
Would that be so terrible,
Mr. Super-Famous-Racecar-Driver?

466
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:15,996
I don't know.

467
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:19,935
- Maybe we should practice.
- Maybe we should.

468
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:24,301
Oh, God, I'm gonna hurl.

469
00:38:24,477 --> 00:38:26,638
- Spritle.
- He did not.

470
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,455
- Ooh, Spritle.
- You little sneak.

471
00:38:37,157 --> 00:38:39,421
- It wasn't my idea.
- Oh, no?

472
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,320
- It was his.
- Wait till we tell Pops.

473
00:38:42,495 --> 00:38:46,693
No, don't do that. We couldn't sleep.
We just wanted to hang out.

474
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,596
We didn't know you were going to
In-spew-ation Point.

475
00:38:50,503 --> 00:38:52,630
By the way, cootie shot.

476
00:38:52,806 --> 00:38:54,296
I'm taking you home.

477
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:57,974
Wait. Wait.
Can we stop for ice cream first?

478
00:39:03,483 --> 00:39:07,283
The new GRX has
a supercharged Inner-Positive Transponder...

479
00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:11,753
...and will be capable of speeds
in excess of 800 kilometers an hour.

480
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:15,793
If such a car were to
win the Grand Prix this year...

481
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:20,365
...one would expect the demand for
transponders to increase dramatically.

482
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:22,057
One would expect.

483
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:27,798
And if a single company gained control of
all the transponder foundries in the world...

484
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:31,432
...one might expect that company
to do very well for itself.

485
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:34,171
You know what I want.
I know for the last few years...

486
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:37,407
...you've been trying to buy out
your main rival, Tetsua Togokahn.

487
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,178
The question is, can we make a deal?

488
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:48,654
Deliver Togokahn at that price
and the transponder foundry is yours.

489
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:50,996
Done.

490
00:39:58,705 --> 00:40:01,731
- Speed!
- Mr. Royalton.

491
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,806
Welcome!

492
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,438
Come here. Look at this.

493
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,974
Oh.

494
00:40:12,352 --> 00:40:13,410
Wow.

495
00:40:13,586 --> 00:40:17,454
That's what I thought. We're still working
on the R and R, but it's getting there.

496
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,218
Come, sit. We can talk logos later.

497
00:40:20,393 --> 00:40:24,557
Can I get you something to drink?
Water? Bubbly? A shot of rye?

498
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:26,858
No. I'm okay.

499
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:33,432
So I can see you've been giving
some serious thought to this thing.

500
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:38,404
- I have. Yes, sir.
- Good.

501
00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:41,513
Means you understand we're talking
about not just your future...

502
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:43,080
...but your family's future.

503
00:40:44,117 --> 00:40:45,880
My family means a lot to me.

504
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:48,316
I know. I can tell.

505
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:52,652
That's why this is so important,
because you can help them.

506
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,656
All you have to say is yes.

507
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,556
That's all I need to hear...

508
00:40:56,729 --> 00:40:59,755
...and I can make so many things happen
for you and your family.

509
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,265
You ready for that?

510
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:06,462
You ready to say yes, Speed?

511
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,200
Jackpot.

512
00:41:38,471 --> 00:41:39,597
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

513
00:41:42,075 --> 00:41:44,703
This isn't an easy decision for me,
Mr. Royalton.

514
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,580
For my family, racing's everything.

515
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:56,112
I was tooling timing pins with Pops
while I was still wearing diapers.

516
00:41:56,289 --> 00:42:00,316
I mean, there's nothing more perfect
than a picnic at Thunderhead.

517
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:08,926
But when my brother died,
all that went away.

518
00:42:09,836 --> 00:42:12,270
I can't tell you how painful that was.

519
00:42:12,438 --> 00:42:14,838
It nearly killed all of us.

520
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,740
Especially Pops.

521
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:21,205
He didn't set foot in his shop
for over a year.

522
00:42:23,649 --> 00:42:26,880
But one night, when I was still
pretty young, I couldn't sleep...

523
00:42:27,053 --> 00:42:30,648
...and I went into the living room,
and there was Pops in his beat-up robe...

524
00:42:30,823 --> 00:42:33,348
...watching some old race recordings.

525
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,659
So I sat with him there...

526
00:42:39,832 --> 00:42:44,462
...watching old Ben Burns coming around
the last turn of the 43 Prix and...

527
00:42:44,637 --> 00:42:47,834
...all of a sudden,
Pops started screaming.

528
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:49,167
Go!

529
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:51,274
<i>And then I started screaming.</i>

530
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:55,370
As Burns and Stickleton
headed for the finish...

531
00:42:55,548 --> 00:42:57,516
...we were cheering our heads off.

532
00:43:01,054 --> 00:43:04,217
And the second the black-and-white
came down...

533
00:43:04,524 --> 00:43:07,687
...we looked at each other
and we realized...

534
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:10,325
...racing's in our blood.

535
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:13,892
But for Pops...

536
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,331
...it isn't just a sport.

537
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:19,130
It's way more important than that.

538
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,739
It's like a religion.

539
00:43:21,908 --> 00:43:25,241
And in our house, the major sponsors...

540
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:27,106
...are kind of like the devil.

541
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:32,580
I don't mean to offend you, sir,
and I do appreciate your offer...

542
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,215
...but after all we've been through...

543
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,258
...I don't think this kind of deal's for me.

544
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,432
You poor, naive chump.

545
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:57,375
I'll pretend I didn't hear
that sickening schmaltz...

546
00:43:57,543 --> 00:44:00,535
...and I'll give you an education.
At the end, if you're smart...

547
00:44:00,713 --> 00:44:03,944
...you'll thank me
and then you'll sign that contract.

548
00:44:11,057 --> 00:44:12,524
Huh?

549
00:44:14,293 --> 00:44:15,851
Huh?

550
00:44:23,736 --> 00:44:25,169
Jig's up.

551
00:44:28,174 --> 00:44:29,937
Holy moly.

552
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,676
Hey. This is Marvin,
down at the landing pad.

553
00:44:35,148 --> 00:44:37,343
I think we got mice again.

554
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:40,543
<i>All right. We'll send
someone over to take care of it. Over.</i>

555
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:45,457
Look. There is the true spirit
of the golden age of racing.

556
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:50,693
Benjamin Braddack, Reginald White, George
Wheeler, Diamond Dave Tewksbury...

557
00:44:50,863 --> 00:44:52,455
...and Oliver Potter.

558
00:44:52,965 --> 00:44:56,457
The five most powerful men in the world
at the turn of the last century.

559
00:44:56,903 --> 00:45:00,464
For all intents and purposes, they created
the modern automotive industry.

560
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,406
But the true stroke of their genius
was the invention of the WRL...

561
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,875
<i>... the world's first racing league.</i>

562
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:19,217
Interesting that you and your father
were so moved by the 43 Prix.

563
00:45:19,392 --> 00:45:22,156
One of the great finishes
in the history of racing, right?

564
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:26,424
Everyone remembers Burns and Stickleton
slugging it out.

565
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,534
But who remembers Carl Potts?

566
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,705
Driving this rebuilt Wittigan
for Iodyne Industries...

567
00:45:33,873 --> 00:45:37,104
...Potts spun out in the second lap
and went down as a DNF...

568
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,377
<i>... a forgettable and pathetic finish.</i>

569
00:45:39,545 --> 00:45:44,073
So bad that afterwards,
Iodyne stock dropped six points.

570
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,949
But as Ben Burns sat guzzling
cold, fresh milk in Victory Lane...

571
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,089
<i>... a thousand cameras
taking his picture...</i>

572
00:45:51,524 --> 00:45:54,118
...Sirrus Aeronautics saw
almost a 12-point gain...

573
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,523
...which blocked Peninsula Power Cell...

574
00:45:56,696 --> 00:45:59,130
...from being able to afford
the price of a takeover.

575
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:03,894
This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of Iodyne,
Inc. in the exact position he wanted to be in.

576
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,699
By first buying controlling interest
in his own company at a devalued price...

577
00:46:07,873 --> 00:46:12,708
...he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that
sent Iodyne into the gains record book...

578
00:46:12,878 --> 00:46:15,608
...the only record book that matters.

579
00:46:15,915 --> 00:46:19,817
Look out that window. There isn't
a single plane or helicopter or K-Harrier...

580
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,614
...that isn't powered by Iodyne fuel cells.

581
00:46:22,788 --> 00:46:26,918
That's what racing is about.
It has nothing to do with cars or drivers.

582
00:46:27,093 --> 00:46:31,325
All that matters is power
and the unassailable might of money.

583
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,794
Whoo!

584
00:46:32,965 --> 00:46:35,263
Dude! Yeah!

585
00:46:38,104 --> 00:46:40,834
Oh, no! Woo-hoo!

586
00:46:41,741 --> 00:46:44,972
Get out of the way! Out of the way!
Get out of the way!

587
00:46:55,888 --> 00:46:57,879
You understand?

588
00:46:58,057 --> 00:47:00,855
Burns knew he was going to win.

589
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,791
It was already decided.

590
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,630
A week before the Prix,
Goldman and Sirrus...

591
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:09,427
...met with other major players
at the Cargyle Hotel.

592
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:11,331
They met there as they had for years.

593
00:47:11,504 --> 00:47:15,167
They met to negotiate
the finish order of the Grand Prix.

594
00:47:15,341 --> 00:47:19,209
No race is more important
and no race is more controlled.

595
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:23,214
Goldman was supposed to win,
but he knew if he sold his win...

596
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:27,443
...whatever that win might be worth was
nothing compared to what could be gained.

597
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:33,252
That's why I spent $3 million
on this burnt and twisted lump of metal.

598
00:47:33,426 --> 00:47:36,088
Because it reminds me
of what really matters.

599
00:47:36,262 --> 00:47:40,255
This is the true heart of racing, boy.

600
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:43,800
This is my religion.

601
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,000
You don't know how often
I've seen that same cow-eyed...

602
00:47:50,176 --> 00:47:52,144
..."say it isn't so" look of disbelief.

603
00:47:52,311 --> 00:47:55,838
Every bumpkin who comes in from
the sticks looks exactly as you do now.

604
00:47:56,015 --> 00:47:57,573
I won't bother proving it to you.

605
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,686
You walk away from me and this deal,
you'll know how true it is soon enough.

606
00:48:01,854 --> 00:48:05,517
So last chance. You ready to
put away your toys and grow up?

607
00:48:05,691 --> 00:48:09,354
Are you ready to make more money in
one year than your father made in his life?

608
00:48:09,528 --> 00:48:13,726
Are you ready to become a real
racecar driver? Then sign that contract!

609
00:48:30,049 --> 00:48:31,243
Spearhook.

610
00:48:47,066 --> 00:48:48,431
What's this?

611
00:48:48,601 --> 00:48:51,434
If that's your idea of racing,
you can keep it.

612
00:48:57,243 --> 00:48:58,801
Listen to me and listen good...

613
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,446
...because I'm gonna give you
one more history lesson.

614
00:49:01,614 --> 00:49:05,846
You're gonna go to Fuji and try and prove
everything I told you is nothing but a lie.

615
00:49:06,018 --> 00:49:09,010
But no matter how well you drive,
you won't win, you won't place.

616
00:49:09,188 --> 00:49:13,056
I guarantee you right now,
you won't even finish the race.

617
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,228
Speed Racer's making his move,
gunning for the lead.

618
00:49:43,556 --> 00:49:44,750
Ha!

619
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,425
The Harbinger of Boom
once again leaves his mark...

620
00:49:57,603 --> 00:50:00,163
...a trail of carnage and chaos
cartwheeling behind him!

621
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:03,399
- Oh, but the fans love it, don't they?
- They do, God help them.

622
00:50:03,576 --> 00:50:06,374
They're about to get more
as Iodyne is now slugging it out...

623
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,479
<i>... with young Taejo Togokahn.</i>

624
00:50:12,785 --> 00:50:14,047
Whoo!

625
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,603
<i>Oh, terrible crash!</i>

626
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,271
<i>They'll have to fish
Taejo and Billy Ray out of the drink.</i>

627
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:46,145
<i>But this race is far from over.</i>

628
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,152
<i>Right now, one car
stands between Speed Racer and the lead:</i>

629
00:50:50,322 --> 00:50:52,984
<i>- The Grey Ghost.
- We got ourselves a real race here!</i>

630
00:50:58,197 --> 00:51:01,030
Show me what you got.
Show me what you got!

631
00:51:05,538 --> 00:51:07,005
Woo-hoo!

632
00:51:18,217 --> 00:51:21,482
- Speed, get out of there!
- I can't. I can't move!

633
00:51:40,606 --> 00:51:45,873
Soon after that, there will be litigation
against some of your father's designs.

634
00:51:46,412 --> 00:51:48,710
Are you Pops Racer of Racer Motors?

635
00:51:48,881 --> 00:51:52,146
- Yeah, but I'm still on vacation.
- You are hereby served a summons.

636
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,549
- What?
- You are being sued for IP infringement...

637
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,379
...by Janus Automakers.

638
00:51:57,556 --> 00:51:59,820
- No way!
- That's ridiculous.

639
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:02,620
That's for a jury to decide.

640
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:06,022
<i>The legitimacy of the lawsuits won't matter.</i>

641
00:52:06,198 --> 00:52:08,428
<i>They'll be enough
to discredit his company.</i>

642
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:12,594
Whatever contracts he has, he'll lose.
Within a year, he'll be filing for bankruptcy.

643
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:16,764
After that, you and the rest of
your pathetic family will be history.

644
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:19,867
Pops is right.

645
00:52:20,212 --> 00:52:21,645
You are the devil.

646
00:52:23,115 --> 00:52:25,413
Mr. Royalton.
- What?!

647
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:27,243
- Speed!
- Spritle?

648
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:30,320
I found these two sneaking around
a restricted area.

649
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:33,458
Get this Racer trash out of my building.

650
00:52:33,626 --> 00:52:36,220
- I'll see you in Fuji.
- Yes.

651
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:40,422
And then you'll find out you just made
the biggest mistake of your life!

652
00:52:49,842 --> 00:52:51,469
Hey, kid.

653
00:52:54,513 --> 00:52:57,880
- Ben Burns?
- Nice race.

654
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,712
I ain't seen moves like that
in a long time.

655
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,451
It didn't matter, I still lost.

656
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:07,557
Yeah. Tough break.

657
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,756
Well, good luck.

658
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,634
Mr. Burns, can I ask you something?

659
00:53:21,807 --> 00:53:23,035
Sure, kid.

660
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,639
The 43 Prix.

661
00:53:28,814 --> 00:53:31,078
Did you know you were gonna win?

662
00:53:33,118 --> 00:53:36,713
You know, everybody thought that
me and Stickleton hated each other.

663
00:53:38,023 --> 00:53:39,786
Funny, ain't it?

664
00:53:46,298 --> 00:53:50,496
"Controversy surrounds Racer
Motors, now embroiled in IP litigation.

665
00:53:50,669 --> 00:53:52,660
And while evidence
remains inconclusive...

666
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:55,238
...whether or not Speed
used an illegal device...

667
00:53:56,075 --> 00:53:59,738
...the Fuji-Helexicon seems destined to
become another mark of shame...

668
00:53:59,912 --> 00:54:02,472
...added to the notorious
Racer family legacy...

669
00:54:02,648 --> 00:54:05,515
...a legacy that has forever tainted
the integrity of this..."

670
00:54:05,684 --> 00:54:07,242
Sparky.

671
00:54:08,353 --> 00:54:10,048
Sorry, ma'am.

672
00:54:10,322 --> 00:54:12,552
I'm gonna send that guy
some Chim Chim cookies.

673
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,757
- You'll do no such thing.
- We gotta do something, Pops.

674
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:20,194
This is exactly what he said would happen
if I didn't drive for him.

675
00:54:20,365 --> 00:54:23,425
He's just trying to scare you.
They tried the same thing with Rex.

676
00:54:23,602 --> 00:54:25,866
It's a fight they want,
it's a fight they'll get.

677
00:54:26,038 --> 00:54:29,940
How? What can we do?
How can we fight this?

678
00:54:30,342 --> 00:54:31,707
The truth'll come out.

679
00:54:32,344 --> 00:54:34,244
The truth?

680
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:36,708
Don't be naive, Pops.

681
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,826
Speed?

682
00:54:55,567 --> 00:54:57,558
Are you all right?

683
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,762
I don't know.

684
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,271
It's gonna be okay. We'll work this out.

685
00:55:09,948 --> 00:55:13,384
I don't know, Mom.
I may have really messed things up.

686
00:55:13,552 --> 00:55:15,417
How?

687
00:55:16,155 --> 00:55:17,816
By not joining Royalton.

688
00:55:18,223 --> 00:55:22,626
Oh, don't be silly. You never would have
been happy racing for that terrible man.

689
00:55:23,729 --> 00:55:26,163
Maybe that's not the point.

690
00:55:26,331 --> 00:55:28,959
Maybe Royalton's right
and racing's all about business...

691
00:55:29,134 --> 00:55:31,796
...and anyone who doesn't understand
that is just a chump.

692
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:33,494
Now you listen to me, young man.

693
00:55:33,672 --> 00:55:38,939
What you do behind the wheel of a racecar
has nothing to do with business.

694
00:55:39,111 --> 00:55:42,808
Before you could even talk, you were
making noises that sounded like an engine.

695
00:55:43,348 --> 00:55:46,875
We tried to take you to the park
and you never wanted to get out of the car.

696
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,485
I loved that old wagon.

697
00:55:48,654 --> 00:55:53,114
And you remember when Rex took you out
to Thunderhead and let you drive?

698
00:55:53,492 --> 00:55:55,084
And I turned it over.

699
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,491
Oh, my heart starts pounding
just thinking about it.

700
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:05,101
Mom! Yeah, you should've seen it! Yeah!

701
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:09,673
Rex told me the only reason we survived
was because I was wearing red socks.

702
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:12,139
I thought your father
would have a heart attack...

703
00:56:12,311 --> 00:56:14,211
...when you came in
with that crazy smile.

704
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:20,179
Speed, when I watch you do
some of the things you do...

705
00:56:20,352 --> 00:56:25,119
...I feel like I'm watching
someone paint or make music.

706
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:28,782
I go to the races to watch you make art.

707
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:30,792
And it's beautiful...

708
00:56:30,963 --> 00:56:32,396
...and inspiring...

709
00:56:32,564 --> 00:56:35,431
...and everything that art should be.

710
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:41,597
Even though there are times
when I have to close my eyes.

711
00:56:43,008 --> 00:56:45,704
But then there are other times...

712
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,443
...when you just take my breath away.

713
00:56:49,715 --> 00:56:54,084
And it's at those moments
when I feel your father's chest swell...

714
00:56:54,253 --> 00:56:55,880
...and I know that he's smiling...

715
00:56:56,054 --> 00:57:00,047
...because he's pretending that
he doesn't have tears in his eyes...

716
00:57:00,225 --> 00:57:02,455
...that I just go to pieces.

717
00:57:03,896 --> 00:57:05,090
Why?

718
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:10,891
Because I am so impossibly proud
to be your mom.

719
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:16,697
It's gonna be okay, honey.
You'll see. We'll work this out.

720
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:20,868
We just have to stick together
and something good will happen.

721
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:22,104
You'll see.

722
00:57:34,393 --> 00:57:37,294
Racer X! The Harbinger of Boom!

723
00:57:37,462 --> 00:57:38,622
Run for your lives!

724
00:57:42,768 --> 00:57:44,793
What are you two squawking about?

725
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,064
Pops, whatever you do,
don't open that door.

726
00:57:50,442 --> 00:57:51,909
This is a bad idea.

727
00:57:52,077 --> 00:57:54,068
If it was any other driver, you'd be here.

728
00:57:56,381 --> 00:57:57,678
Inspector Detector.

729
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:01,444
Good morning, Mr. Racer.
I know it's been a long time.

730
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,312
Ten years.

731
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:08,052
We've been after Royalton for years
for dozens of capital corporate crimes...

732
00:58:08,226 --> 00:58:12,993
...including WRL fixing, but we haven't had
the evidence we needed to convict him...

733
00:58:13,165 --> 00:58:14,462
...until now.

734
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:16,464
What's he doing here?

735
00:58:16,635 --> 00:58:19,661
Racer X works closely with our
WRL Corporate Crimes Division...

736
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:22,033
...helping us recruit
drivers like you, Speed.

737
00:58:23,275 --> 00:58:25,505
Why does he always wear that mask?

738
00:58:25,677 --> 00:58:29,306
If any of you knew his identity,
you'd become targets for his enemies...

739
00:58:29,481 --> 00:58:33,178
...which include some of
the most vicious fixers in the world.

740
00:58:35,253 --> 00:58:36,447
What do you want with me?

741
00:58:36,621 --> 00:58:39,055
Are you familiar with the driver
Taejo Togokahn?

742
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,881
- Of course.
- For years...

743
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:44,551
...he's been contracted by a fixer
named Cruncher Block.

744
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:48,166
<i>Recently, Taejo's been forced to lose races,
and he began resisting...</i>

745
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:50,858
<i>... thinking that he could do it on his own.</i>

746
00:58:52,504 --> 00:58:55,701
- After Fuji, he realized he needed help.
- Why help him?

747
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:59,636
Because he has a file with enough
information to connect Block to Royalton...

748
00:58:59,845 --> 00:59:03,178
...which could put both of them
behind bars for the rest of their lives.

749
00:59:03,348 --> 00:59:05,373
The problem is,
he won't give us the file...

750
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:09,486
...unless we help him stop
the takeover of his family's company.

751
00:59:09,654 --> 00:59:11,087
How?

752
00:59:13,525 --> 00:59:16,323
There's an upcoming race
that Taejo believes if he can win...

753
00:59:16,495 --> 00:59:19,020
...it'll catapult Togokahn Motors
into the spotlight...

754
00:59:19,197 --> 00:59:21,722
...double the cost of the buyout,
which should kill it.

755
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,528
There aren't any more races left
except the Grand Prix...

756
00:59:24,703 --> 00:59:26,603
...and we both failed to qualify.

757
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:30,230
Ahem. There aren't any more track races.

758
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:33,034
This is a cross-country rally.

759
00:59:33,478 --> 00:59:35,070
Casa Cristo.

760
00:59:35,313 --> 00:59:36,746
What?

761
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,109
I know it seems cruel of me to ask.

762
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:42,082
Taejo made it clear he had
to have Speed and X on his team...

763
00:59:42,254 --> 00:59:44,586
...or there would be no deal.
- Absolutely not.

764
00:59:44,756 --> 00:59:47,418
- You'll have the support of the entire C.I.B.
- No.

765
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:52,157
Rally racing is a back-alley sport
filled with jackals, headhunters and thugs.

766
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:56,790
I'm sorry, but I've already lost one son
to that deathtrap. I won't lose another.

767
00:59:57,502 --> 00:59:59,367
I understand.

768
01:00:00,605 --> 01:00:03,369
- If you change your mind...
- Keep your card, Chief Inspector.

769
01:00:03,775 --> 01:00:05,709
Thank you for your time.

770
01:00:13,618 --> 01:00:15,108
But Pops'll never let you go.

771
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,747
He won't if I ask him.

772
01:00:19,558 --> 01:00:21,719
Speed Racer, what are you thinking?

773
01:00:21,893 --> 01:00:24,123
You weren't in Royalton's office, Trix.

774
01:00:24,596 --> 01:00:26,826
You don't know what it was like.

775
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,398
It felt as though he had his hand
inside my chest...

776
01:00:29,568 --> 01:00:33,368
...and he was trying to crush everything
in my life that mattered to me.

777
01:00:35,774 --> 01:00:38,641
All right. Let's do it.

778
01:00:39,244 --> 01:00:42,213
You're gonna need an alibi.
We'll say we're going skiing.

779
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,904
What? No way.

780
01:00:44,082 --> 01:00:45,549
You're gonna need my help.

781
01:00:45,717 --> 01:00:48,311
Casa Cristo is a rally.
I can spot from a copter.

782
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:52,089
Trixie, this isn't a game.
These people play rough.

783
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:55,316
I know. That's why I'm going with you.

784
01:00:56,495 --> 01:01:00,898
If you even try to argue with me, I'll tell
Pops and he'll never let you out of his sight.

785
01:01:01,066 --> 01:01:02,658
You would, wouldn't you?

786
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,027
Well...

787
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,074
...I guess we're going skiing.

788
01:01:11,643 --> 01:01:14,134
<i>We're just minutes away from the start...</i>

789
01:01:14,312 --> 01:01:16,041
<i>... of the 82nd annual
Casa Cristo Classic...</i>

790
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,775
<i>... the grande dame of cross-country,
the second-oldest rally race in the world...</i>

791
01:01:19,951 --> 01:01:22,419
<i>... spanning two continents,
three climate changes...</i>

792
01:01:22,587 --> 01:01:26,717
<i>... and 5,000 kilometers of the most
winding and treacherous roads ever raced.</i>

793
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,224
<i>With me again is five-time
Casa Cristo champion...</i>

794
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:32,295
<i>Spritle.
- ... Johnny "Goodboy" Jones.</i>

795
01:01:34,332 --> 01:01:35,731
What are you two doing?

796
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:38,662
Just watching a little TV, Pops.

797
01:01:38,837 --> 01:01:40,498
It's his favorite show.

798
01:01:43,642 --> 01:01:46,805
- It's in German.
- Not the monkey parts.

799
01:01:47,546 --> 01:01:49,810
Oh, no, you don't.
You are not watching that race.

800
01:01:49,981 --> 01:01:52,814
Out you go. Outside. Get some exercise.

801
01:01:53,118 --> 01:01:55,279
You're too pale.

802
01:01:55,654 --> 01:01:56,814
Speed.

803
01:01:57,956 --> 01:02:01,790
I want you to understand how much
the C.I.B. appreciates your help on this.

804
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,292
I'm not doing this to help the C.I.B.

805
01:02:04,462 --> 01:02:08,489
I don't know anything about corporate
crimes and if I did, it wouldn't really matter.

806
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:11,431
I'm doing this because
someone's trying to hurt my family...

807
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:14,697
...and I'm gonna do everything I can
to hurt him back.

808
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:19,972
Safety has been a primary concern for Casa
Cristo officials, especially the last few years.

809
01:02:20,145 --> 01:02:22,909
That's right. There were
a number of fatalities years ago.

810
01:02:23,081 --> 01:02:25,015
<i>It really had a bad reputation.</i>

811
01:02:25,183 --> 01:02:27,208
<i>Fans started calling it "The Crucible."</i>

812
01:02:27,385 --> 01:02:30,047
These are some of the most dangerous
drivers in the world.

813
01:02:30,222 --> 01:02:32,918
And we expect they'll
do anything they can to stop you.

814
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:35,787
Their cars will probably be equipped
with secret weapons...

815
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:39,226
...so we've modified the Mach 5
to try to counter their attacks.

816
01:02:39,664 --> 01:02:42,360
The A button will operate
your normal jump-jacks.

817
01:02:42,534 --> 01:02:46,595
B will seal your cockpit, which we
fortified with bulletproof polymer.

818
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:50,332
Should someone go after your tires with,
say, a hidden shank or shredder...

819
01:02:50,508 --> 01:02:53,068
...the C button will activate
your tire shields.

820
01:02:53,245 --> 01:02:55,076
However, in the event of any blowout...

821
01:02:55,247 --> 01:02:58,182
...D will inflate
a Hexadyno emergency spare.

822
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:01,148
E will activate these
zircon-tipped saw blades.

823
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:04,914
They'll cut through almost anything.
Use with discretion.

824
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:07,558
F will project the tire crampons.

825
01:03:07,726 --> 01:03:10,194
Finally, G will launch
a remote-control homing bird...

826
01:03:10,362 --> 01:03:13,820
...that is capable of transmitting
U-CAP footage anywhere you are.

827
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,933
Every race fan has heard the rumors...

828
01:03:16,101 --> 01:03:19,036
...of spearhooks, tire shanks,
battery boosters.

829
01:03:19,204 --> 01:03:21,900
Oh, no. While it's true
there have been a few bad apples...

830
01:03:22,073 --> 01:03:24,837
...on the whole, most teams
stay within league rules.

831
01:03:31,383 --> 01:03:34,284
Or at least try not to get caught.

832
01:03:37,155 --> 01:03:39,623
This is wrong, what you are trying to do.

833
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,660
Musha's price is an insult
to five generations of our family.

834
01:03:47,332 --> 01:03:49,425
And if you die?

835
01:03:50,468 --> 01:03:52,493
Then will the price be high enough?

836
01:03:55,073 --> 01:03:57,507
- I have no choice.
- Why?

837
01:03:59,644 --> 01:04:01,544
He is your father too.

838
01:04:11,356 --> 01:04:14,189
I finally understand it now, Trix.

839
01:04:14,359 --> 01:04:16,486
I know why he left us.

840
01:04:17,595 --> 01:04:22,157
He was trying to change this rotten
business and they killed him for it.

841
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:38,376
<i>A lot of drivers believe that
the hardest part of Cristo is the start.</i>

842
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:41,075
<i>The Muqranna?
- Yeah, those archways are tricky.</i>

843
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:44,415
<i>And speaking of starts,
here comes the queen of Casa Cristo now.</i>

844
01:04:45,557 --> 01:04:49,584
<i>The moment the queen sees the sun,
she'll signal the start.</i>

845
01:04:50,695 --> 01:04:54,290
No, no, no.
This is supposed to be my race.

846
01:04:54,466 --> 01:04:56,161
<i>I'm supposed to win.</i>

847
01:04:56,334 --> 01:04:58,427
I got the green light.

848
01:04:58,903 --> 01:05:02,236
They promised I would
go to the Grand Prix.

849
01:05:02,407 --> 01:05:05,137
For eight years, I played by the rules!

850
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:08,370
- This is supposed to be my race!
- Enough!

851
01:05:08,546 --> 01:05:10,639
I can't stand the whining.

852
01:05:10,815 --> 01:05:13,215
Like a baby needing its diaper changed.

853
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,519
It's simple.

854
01:05:16,688 --> 01:05:19,179
We have a team of wild cards.

855
01:05:19,357 --> 01:05:24,317
The problem is, these wild cards
are better drivers than you.

856
01:05:24,896 --> 01:05:27,865
What? Like hell they are!

857
01:05:28,366 --> 01:05:29,390
Prove it.

858
01:05:30,602 --> 01:05:33,571
Take out Taejo
and the other two will quit.

859
01:05:34,172 --> 01:05:37,539
You just watch me.

860
01:05:39,411 --> 01:05:40,435
Come on!

861
01:06:25,757 --> 01:06:27,019
I got Racer.

862
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:02,723
<i>This team Taejo Togokahn's put together
looks like they mean business.</i>

863
01:07:11,202 --> 01:07:13,966
As they head out of the city
and into the Zunubian Desert...

864
01:07:14,138 --> 01:07:17,301
...the team leading the pack
is Snake Oiler!

865
01:07:17,475 --> 01:07:20,035
Let's pinch these turds off.

866
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,879
Come on! We are falling behind!

867
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:34,384
Speed! On your right, Flying Foxes!

868
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:36,649
Got them.

869
01:07:54,913 --> 01:07:56,505
Headhunters.

870
01:07:58,349 --> 01:07:59,441
They're not alone.

871
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:54,905
- Oh, no.
- Speed Racer has a blowout!

872
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,677
Move it, Speed.
It's getting ugly out there.

873
01:09:32,677 --> 01:09:35,271
Okay, no more Mr. Nice-Guy.

874
01:09:57,435 --> 01:09:59,995
Hurry, Speed, they need you!

875
01:10:17,388 --> 01:10:18,412
Where have you been?

876
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,982
Have any of these drivers
read the rulebook?

877
01:10:26,631 --> 01:10:29,361
See? This race is full of cheaters.

878
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,167
It's tough to see what goes on
in those dust clouds.

879
01:10:32,336 --> 01:10:34,964
<i>It can get really nasty in there.</i>

880
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,442
Watch the backdraft.

881
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:45,605
You want some? Come on!
Thor-Azine, yeah!

882
01:10:45,817 --> 01:10:47,478
Wing left.

883
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,582
Flying in.

884
01:10:55,326 --> 01:10:57,521
- Lead them.
- Here you go.

885
01:10:58,996 --> 01:11:00,020
Ha-ha!

886
01:11:18,216 --> 01:11:19,911
Watch the blind side!

887
01:11:28,926 --> 01:11:31,622
Broom Hilda!

888
01:11:34,298 --> 01:11:38,359
Crom!

889
01:11:50,047 --> 01:11:51,378
Taejo!

890
01:12:01,292 --> 01:12:04,921
- Oh, my God, did I just see that?
- A rear single-set jump into a flying kick.

891
01:12:05,096 --> 01:12:08,088
I know he blew up at Fuji,
but this kid is flat-out magic.

892
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:24,442
I'm going into town for some parts.
I'll be back for lunch.

893
01:12:24,816 --> 01:12:25,840
Sure thing, Pops.

894
01:12:28,128 --> 01:12:29,618
Hm? Mm.

895
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:36,395
Let's go!

896
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:41,703
<i>- The Togokahn Team is fighting their way...
- Game on.</i>

897
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:45,470
<i>... back into the race behind the
electrifying driving of Speed Racer.</i>

898
01:12:45,645 --> 01:12:47,636
<i>The fans are getting their money's worth.</i>

899
01:12:47,814 --> 01:12:50,248
Honey, I can't find my wallet.

900
01:12:50,417 --> 01:12:51,884
Spritle!

901
01:12:52,052 --> 01:12:54,350
- You two are in big trouble.
- Wait.

902
01:12:54,521 --> 01:12:56,989
Wait, before you get mad at us, look!

903
01:12:57,324 --> 01:12:58,791
I'm not falling for that.

904
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:01,484
- It's Speed!
- Speed's skiing!

905
01:13:01,828 --> 01:13:03,591
Then who's driving the Mach 5?

906
01:13:03,764 --> 01:13:06,028
<i>- relentless as the eight remaining teams...</i>

907
01:13:06,199 --> 01:13:08,963
<i>... slice their way through
the aqueducts of Sassicaia.</i>

908
01:13:10,537 --> 01:13:11,663
Oh, no.

909
01:13:11,838 --> 01:13:15,740
As we near the end of the first leg of
the Casa Cristo, one team has dominated.

910
01:13:15,909 --> 01:13:19,902
And here they come through the streets
of Cortega, heading for the finish.

911
01:13:24,384 --> 01:13:26,648
Yeah!

912
01:13:41,034 --> 01:13:44,231
If we drive tomorrow like we drove today,
we will lose!

913
01:13:45,939 --> 01:13:47,600
You will get nothing.

914
01:13:48,275 --> 01:13:49,970
All of this will be meaningless!

915
01:13:50,143 --> 01:13:53,806
Relax. Snake's weak on turns.
We'll catch him in the mountains.

916
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:56,039
We might, if you stop showing off.

917
01:13:57,184 --> 01:14:00,017
Hey, all I was doing was saving your ass.

918
01:14:01,922 --> 01:14:03,981
Don't fall apart yet.

919
01:14:04,825 --> 01:14:07,020
There's still a lot of race to run.

920
01:14:14,668 --> 01:14:17,967
A C.I.B. man will be posted
outside your door.

921
01:14:18,138 --> 01:14:22,973
We got their attention today. You and Trixie
should be very careful tonight.

922
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:25,502
Racer X.

923
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:28,177
I thought we made a good team today.

924
01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:32,384
It felt like we've been doing it
for a long time.

925
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:35,612
If you say so.

926
01:14:39,793 --> 01:14:43,490
<i>Ineptitude. Is this what I pay you for?!</i>

927
01:14:43,663 --> 01:14:45,426
They ain't checkered yet.

928
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:50,559
If they do, I assure you it'll be
a very costly mistake for everyone.

929
01:14:51,872 --> 01:14:53,134
It was very weird, Trix.

930
01:14:53,306 --> 01:14:57,436
I knew every move he was gonna make
and he knew mine. It was so familiar.

931
01:14:58,979 --> 01:15:03,313
Maybe I'm crazy, but Racer X first
showed up two years after Rex's death.

932
01:15:03,483 --> 01:15:05,474
But, Speed, we buried Rex.

933
01:15:05,652 --> 01:15:09,918
A body was buried. Remember, it had
already been badly burned in the crash.

934
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:12,718
Even if it was Rex,
no one could have recognized him.

935
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:18,554
So you think he faked the crash with
a different body in the driver's seat?

936
01:15:18,732 --> 01:15:21,394
Somehow the kwik-save
was disconnected.

937
01:15:21,568 --> 01:15:26,801
Inspector Detector suspected foul play,
but nothing could be proved.

938
01:15:30,343 --> 01:15:33,506
Do you really think Rex
could put everyone through all that?

939
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:39,313
Maybe he felt
he didn't have any other choice.

940
01:15:41,588 --> 01:15:44,921
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,
but do you know these people?

941
01:15:51,097 --> 01:15:52,325
Yeah.

942
01:15:53,767 --> 01:15:55,860
Is this the kind of driver I have?

943
01:15:56,036 --> 01:15:58,163
Someone who disobeys?
Someone who lies to me?

944
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:01,065
Is this the kind of son I've raised?

945
01:16:01,241 --> 01:16:02,936
And you, Trixie.

946
01:16:03,743 --> 01:16:06,211
You know what this race
did to this family.

947
01:16:06,379 --> 01:16:08,711
Did either of you
stop and think about us?

948
01:16:08,882 --> 01:16:12,875
That's all I've been thinking about, Pops.
You, Mom, Spritle, Sparky.

949
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,052
Yeah, you too, Chim Chim.

950
01:16:16,222 --> 01:16:18,952
We're in serious trouble, Pops,
and it's all my fault.

951
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:21,719
This is not the place or race
to do anything about that.

952
01:16:21,895 --> 01:16:24,625
- Why not?
- Because it won't do any good.

953
01:16:24,798 --> 01:16:25,822
You don't know that.

954
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:30,231
You think you can drive a car and change
the world? It doesn't work like that.

955
01:16:31,905 --> 01:16:33,634
Maybe not.

956
01:16:33,807 --> 01:16:37,334
But it's the only thing I know how to do,
and I gotta do something.

957
01:16:37,844 --> 01:16:41,336
That's unacceptable. This is over.
Pack your things. We're going home.

958
01:16:45,585 --> 01:16:47,143
I can't.

959
01:16:47,821 --> 01:16:48,845
I'm sorry, Pops.

960
01:16:49,889 --> 01:16:51,186
What?

961
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:54,383
- I'm staying.
- So am I.

962
01:16:54,894 --> 01:16:58,728
No, you're not.
We're going home right now!

963
01:16:59,065 --> 01:17:03,331
I'm not a child, Pops.
You can't tell me how to live my life.

964
01:17:03,503 --> 01:17:06,165
If you wanna fire me as your driver,
then, fine, do it.

965
01:17:06,573 --> 01:17:09,565
But it won't change the fact
that I am going to finish this race.

966
01:17:09,909 --> 01:17:14,039
God, you sound like Rex! You wanna die
like him too? Will that make you happy?

967
01:17:14,214 --> 01:17:16,944
Don't take it out on me
because you feel guilty for Rex!

968
01:17:17,117 --> 01:17:19,051
Okay, you two, that's enough.

969
01:17:19,652 --> 01:17:23,179
Pops. If they're staying, we're staying.

970
01:17:23,356 --> 01:17:24,914
Woo-hoo! Room service!

971
01:17:25,258 --> 01:17:30,025
And I suggest that we all find a way
to go home together.

972
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:38,299
- Where's the Mach 5?
- Logged with security.

973
01:17:38,471 --> 01:17:41,963
- You added something to it, didn't you?
- Some defensive modifications.

974
01:17:42,142 --> 01:17:44,702
Whole thing's out of balance, isn't it?

975
01:17:46,146 --> 01:17:48,376
It pulls left, rides a little stiff.

976
01:17:48,548 --> 01:17:50,743
- Mmm. Sparky!
- Huh?

977
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,217
I'm sorry, Mom.

978
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:03,987
Your father loves you. It's just...

979
01:18:04,164 --> 01:18:05,597
I know.

980
01:18:07,967 --> 01:18:09,161
It's gonna be okay.

981
01:18:10,904 --> 01:18:12,667
You wouldn't lie to your mother,
would you?

982
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:14,934
Never again.

983
01:20:23,303 --> 01:20:26,500
I got him, Speed! I got him! I got him!

984
01:20:33,546 --> 01:20:35,104
Still got him!

985
01:20:44,357 --> 01:20:45,824
Speed!

986
01:20:52,532 --> 01:20:53,760
Attack!

987
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:57,635
Hi-ya!

988
01:20:58,972 --> 01:21:00,166
What's going on out there?

989
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:23,254
Uh-oh.

990
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:27,092
Ooh!

991
01:21:27,634 --> 01:21:29,226
You attack my family.

992
01:21:29,769 --> 01:21:31,760
You try to hurt my sons.

993
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:36,032
Here we go!

994
01:21:38,111 --> 01:21:39,442
What's going...?

995
01:21:43,883 --> 01:21:44,907
Whoa.

996
01:22:04,103 --> 01:22:05,968
Oh, my God. Was that a ninja?

997
01:22:06,139 --> 01:22:10,132
More like a non-ja.
Terrible what passes for a ninja these days.

998
01:22:11,344 --> 01:22:12,743
Cool beans.

999
01:22:16,416 --> 01:22:18,976
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was looking for Speed Racer.

1000
01:22:20,553 --> 01:22:22,453
Horuko. Are you all right?

1001
01:22:22,622 --> 01:22:24,590
No. Something terrible has happened.

1002
01:22:27,751 --> 01:22:29,446
Narcolyte benzamine.

1003
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,418
A highly effective and debilitating drug.

1004
01:22:32,589 --> 01:22:35,217
Stays in the system for hours,
but leaves with no trace.

1005
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,917
I'll be fine by morning.

1006
01:22:38,195 --> 01:22:41,824
No, you won't. You can't drive a car.
You can barely stand up.

1007
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:47,804
You do not tell me what I can do.

1008
01:22:48,205 --> 01:22:49,229
Taejo.

1009
01:22:52,476 --> 01:22:54,000
What are we gonna do?

1010
01:22:58,782 --> 01:23:01,114
<i>The second leg
of the Casa Cristo is under way...</i>

1011
01:23:01,284 --> 01:23:03,115
<i>... and the stage is set
for what might be...</i>

1012
01:23:03,286 --> 01:23:06,084
<i>... one of the most ferocious rallies
we've seen in years.</i>

1013
01:23:06,256 --> 01:23:08,019
This is my race.

1014
01:23:15,065 --> 01:23:17,033
She's leaving the hotel now.

1015
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:22,866
Wicked sidewinder coming up.
Watch the inside-out, could get dicey.

1016
01:23:24,441 --> 01:23:26,204
Watch your line!

1017
01:23:27,477 --> 01:23:28,501
Watch it!

1018
01:23:28,845 --> 01:23:30,073
This is abso...

1019
01:23:30,247 --> 01:23:31,509
- lutely crazy.

1020
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:36,517
Yeah, boss. Signal's loud and clear.

1021
01:23:45,462 --> 01:23:48,397
Don't do it! On the ground! Now!

1022
01:23:52,969 --> 01:23:54,493
Gotcha.

1023
01:24:00,177 --> 01:24:01,542
What the...?

1024
01:24:04,648 --> 01:24:07,048
You cheater!

1025
01:24:08,685 --> 01:24:12,052
If you're here, who's?

1026
01:24:14,991 --> 01:24:17,755
That's better. I couldn't see a thing.

1027
01:24:19,963 --> 01:24:21,897
That's it. Nice line, Trix.

1028
01:24:22,132 --> 01:24:25,590
Top of the hill's coming up. Snake's
got about a quarter of a mile on you.

1029
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:26,963
All right. Let's get him.

1030
01:24:27,137 --> 01:24:29,662
If you'd been more careful,
he wouldn't be ahead.

1031
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,900
I told you, I couldn't see a thing
out of this dang helmet.

1032
01:24:34,845 --> 01:24:37,973
I can't believe you talked us into
this ridiculous idea.

1033
01:24:38,148 --> 01:24:39,945
What's ridiculous about it?

1034
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:43,085
You're always saying
I'm a better driver than most of the WRL.

1035
01:24:43,253 --> 01:24:45,585
- Now's not the time to prove it.
- Why not?

1036
01:24:45,755 --> 01:24:47,245
It's too dangerous.

1037
01:24:47,424 --> 01:24:49,449
It's too dangerous for me,
but not for you?

1038
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:50,991
Children, focus.

1039
01:24:51,161 --> 01:24:55,063
If we're going to have a chance, we'll
have to pass Snake before the rendezvous.

1040
01:24:55,232 --> 01:24:57,632
I'm ready. Let's roll.

1041
01:25:06,676 --> 01:25:09,008
Woo-hoo! Go get them, girl!

1042
01:25:09,579 --> 01:25:11,774
Here they come. Let's pick it up!

1043
01:25:17,254 --> 01:25:19,722
- Take him.
- With pleasure.

1044
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,549
Bring it on!

1045
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:25,589
Come on!

1046
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:38,302
Now the gloves are off and they're pounding
one another, bumper to bumper, rail to rail.

1047
01:25:45,949 --> 01:25:48,213
Take that, Togokahn!

1048
01:25:52,455 --> 01:25:54,389
You're going down!

1049
01:26:07,904 --> 01:26:09,838
- Oh, yeah!
- That's my boy!

1050
01:26:12,509 --> 01:26:14,238
Oh, God. Speed.

1051
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:18,242
Please! Please! Please!

1052
01:26:18,415 --> 01:26:21,873
Oh, please! Please! Aah!

1053
01:26:25,021 --> 01:26:27,012
<i>The Togokahn Team roars into the lead...</i>

1054
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:29,852
...behind some very aggressive driving
by Speed Racer.

1055
01:26:30,026 --> 01:26:32,153
You kidding?
He just tore Snake a new tailpipe.

1056
01:26:32,329 --> 01:26:34,263
Trix, you all right?

1057
01:26:34,431 --> 01:26:36,592
Ten-four. Ready for more.

1058
01:26:36,766 --> 01:26:39,496
Then let's move it.
We've got some time to eat up.

1059
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:44,606
You're sure, no cameras here?

1060
01:26:44,774 --> 01:26:48,505
No, I checked it this morning. There's quite
a few dead spots in these mountains.

1061
01:26:58,622 --> 01:27:00,180
What's he doing here?

1062
01:27:00,357 --> 01:27:03,224
Stowaway.
We weren't sure what to do with him.

1063
01:27:03,393 --> 01:27:06,385
Do what he'd do.
Break his legs and let him walk back.

1064
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:12,825
- Thank you so much.
- It was a blast.

1065
01:27:13,003 --> 01:27:15,369
The cell's reloaded.
- Let's go!

1066
01:27:15,538 --> 01:27:16,562
Good luck.

1067
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,807
Nobody move.

1068
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:26,448
Waiting for the Togokahn Team
to come out of the pass.

1069
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:29,210
Those roads can really ice up.
Very dangerous.

1070
01:27:29,386 --> 01:27:32,048
- What is this?
- This...

1071
01:27:32,222 --> 01:27:34,383
...is called a change of plan.

1072
01:27:34,557 --> 01:27:36,286
Yeah, that's right.

1073
01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:41,954
We're changing your plan that changed
our plan to change your plan.

1074
01:27:42,532 --> 01:27:43,863
Right, boss?

1075
01:27:44,034 --> 01:27:46,366
The new plan, what was it?

1076
01:27:46,536 --> 01:27:50,597
"Break your legs and make you walk back."
I like that.

1077
01:27:50,774 --> 01:27:54,608
But first, it's time to play
a little game of peekaboo...

1078
01:27:55,445 --> 01:27:57,276
...I see you.

1079
01:28:05,055 --> 01:28:07,751
- Ow!
- Monkey cookie!

1080
01:28:08,191 --> 01:28:10,455
- Nice shot!
- Spritle?

1081
01:28:13,196 --> 01:28:14,823
Get that monkey!

1082
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:33,239
Whoa!

1083
01:28:38,755 --> 01:28:40,017
Ah? Ha!

1084
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,714
Aw!

1085
01:28:51,234 --> 01:28:54,465
Hyah! Hyah!

1086
01:29:21,131 --> 01:29:23,531
Nobody messes with Spark...

1087
01:29:35,044 --> 01:29:36,272
Huh?

1088
01:29:53,062 --> 01:29:55,223
Looks like another change of plan.

1089
01:29:59,135 --> 01:30:01,467
Take him away, boys.

1090
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,539
Spritle!

1091
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:12,172
Go! Go, go!

1092
01:30:13,016 --> 01:30:14,040
No.

1093
01:30:14,217 --> 01:30:16,082
Oh, no, you don't. You're in big trouble.

1094
01:30:16,486 --> 01:30:18,477
<i>First out of the pass is...</i>

1095
01:30:19,689 --> 01:30:20,713
...the Hydra-Cell Team.

1096
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:23,085
Uh-oh. They better send
the emergency trailer.

1097
01:30:23,493 --> 01:30:25,188
Wait, is that...?

1098
01:30:25,995 --> 01:30:27,019
Here we go again.

1099
01:30:27,197 --> 01:30:30,257
Whatever happened in that pass
left Togokahn where they started...

1100
01:30:30,433 --> 01:30:34,927
...but now only one obstacle stands
between Snake Oiler and victory.

1101
01:30:35,104 --> 01:30:37,231
The Maltese Ice Caves.

1102
01:30:42,278 --> 01:30:44,439
This is where Rex cr...

1103
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:01,262
Speed, what are you doing?

1104
01:31:01,431 --> 01:31:03,422
<i>Are you all right?
- I'm fine.</i>

1105
01:31:08,204 --> 01:31:11,367
This next cave's a rattler.
We'll make our move in there.

1106
01:31:15,144 --> 01:31:16,441
Now.

1107
01:31:34,063 --> 01:31:36,497
Ah, not this time, punk.

1108
01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:50,205
Yahoo!

1109
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:51,847
Speed!

1110
01:31:57,086 --> 01:31:59,748
Bye-bye, little turd. Ha-ha-ha!

1111
01:32:19,008 --> 01:32:20,737
He did not! He did not just do that!

1112
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:23,606
Speed Racer is driving straight up
a cliff face. Are we getting this?

1113
01:32:37,593 --> 01:32:39,686
- Come on!
- Go, Speed, go!

1114
01:32:39,862 --> 01:32:42,888
- Hi. Remember me?
- No way.

1115
01:32:55,478 --> 01:32:59,175
No, no, no! Not again! Not again!

1116
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:00,973
Gun!

1117
01:33:30,546 --> 01:33:33,481
<i>Snake Oiler completely
going out of his mind!</i>

1118
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:35,913
Could have been altitude sickness.
It gets crazy.

1119
01:33:36,085 --> 01:33:38,019
Speed handled it beautifully.

1120
01:33:38,187 --> 01:33:39,814
And with less than
250 kilometers to go...

1121
01:33:40,089 --> 01:33:43,024
...nothing seems to stand
between Togokahn...

1122
01:33:43,192 --> 01:33:44,989
<i>... and victory.</i>

1123
01:33:53,369 --> 01:33:55,667
Whoo!

1124
01:34:09,118 --> 01:34:11,643
Get me Tetsua Togokahn.

1125
01:34:12,221 --> 01:34:13,711
Whoo!

1126
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:21,963
Thank you.

1127
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:25,356
Whoo!

1128
01:34:26,102 --> 01:34:28,161
We make a good team.

1129
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:34,135
We did our part. Make sure you do yours.

1130
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:35,971
Of course.

1131
01:34:37,847 --> 01:34:40,873
Congratulations, Mr. Togokahn.

1132
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:44,178
<i>- Very impressive race.
- Yes, thank you.</i>

1133
01:34:44,353 --> 01:34:46,719
You're very generous, Mr. Royalton.

1134
01:34:47,256 --> 01:34:50,714
Here's Speed. Does this mean
you've signed with Togokahn?

1135
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:55,887
Uh, no, this was
a mutually beneficial opportunity.

1136
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:57,498
Yes. Well put.

1137
01:34:57,667 --> 01:35:01,694
Taejo, will you be running
in the Grand Prix this weekend?

1138
01:35:02,038 --> 01:35:07,032
We'll see. Right now
I'm just going to enjoy this victory.

1139
01:35:07,844 --> 01:35:09,402
Whoo!

1140
01:35:13,082 --> 01:35:15,175
The price is 78 a share.

1141
01:35:16,452 --> 01:35:18,386
That's outrageous.

1142
01:35:18,554 --> 01:35:22,354
The price is barely above 50.
This is extortion, blackmail.

1143
01:35:22,525 --> 01:35:27,326
I'll sue you, tie up every asset you own
for the next 20 years.

1144
01:35:27,497 --> 01:35:30,330
<i>As you wish, Mr. Royalton.
Have a nice day...</i>

1145
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,092
Wait.

1146
01:35:34,737 --> 01:35:37,035
Seventy-eight a share.

1147
01:35:39,675 --> 01:35:41,643
I'll have the paperwork drawn up.

1148
01:35:41,811 --> 01:35:44,871
A pleasure doing business with you.

1149
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:50,544
You have done very well for us, my son.

1150
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:03,758
- I don't get it. What just happened?
- Togokahn played us for chumps.

1151
01:36:03,933 --> 01:36:06,868
He wanted our help to drive up
the stock in his family business.

1152
01:36:07,036 --> 01:36:09,436
Even if he had a file,
he wouldn't turn it over.

1153
01:36:09,605 --> 01:36:11,163
You mean the whole race
was for nothing?

1154
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:01,281
X?

1155
01:37:02,491 --> 01:37:04,118
Racer X.

1156
01:37:04,727 --> 01:37:06,160
Racer X!

1157
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:18,336
Jesus, kid, you can drive.
I haven't been thrown like that in years.

1158
01:37:18,908 --> 01:37:20,170
What are you doing here?

1159
01:37:21,277 --> 01:37:24,371
The inspector told me what happened.
I came looking for you.

1160
01:37:24,947 --> 01:37:26,244
Why would you care?

1161
01:37:26,415 --> 01:37:29,009
Because you're a fighter and a friend.

1162
01:37:30,586 --> 01:37:33,146
Why don't you just tell me the truth?

1163
01:37:33,522 --> 01:37:37,014
- You're Rex, aren't you?
- You mean your brother?

1164
01:37:37,193 --> 01:37:42,358
You first appeared two years after Rex died.
You drive just like him.

1165
01:37:42,531 --> 01:37:46,661
You knew I'd be here, because this is
where he always used to take me.

1166
01:37:46,836 --> 01:37:48,394
Just tell me the truth.

1167
01:38:04,954 --> 01:38:06,012
You're not Rex.

1168
01:38:06,956 --> 01:38:08,719
No, Speed.

1169
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:11,916
I'm sorry, but your brother is dead.

1170
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:18,695
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

1171
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:22,533
I'm sure if he was here,
he'd be immensely proud of you.

1172
01:38:22,705 --> 01:38:24,502
For what?

1173
01:38:24,874 --> 01:38:26,432
Making the same mistakes he did?

1174
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:28,543
For trying to make a difference.

1175
01:38:28,711 --> 01:38:30,872
From what I've read,
that's all he tried to do.

1176
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,943
And what good did it do?
He got killed for nothing.

1177
01:38:35,418 --> 01:38:37,579
Racing hasn't changed and it never will.

1178
01:38:37,753 --> 01:38:40,313
It doesn't matter if racing never changes.

1179
01:38:40,489 --> 01:38:43,481
What matters is if
we let racing change us.

1180
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:49,596
Everyone has to find a reason to do this.
You don't climb into a T-180 to be a driver.

1181
01:38:49,765 --> 01:38:51,596
You do it because you're driven.

1182
01:38:52,668 --> 01:38:55,865
If you know so much, why don't you
tell me why I should keep driving?

1183
01:38:56,038 --> 01:38:57,266
Sorry.

1184
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,806
That's for you to figure out.

1185
01:39:02,678 --> 01:39:05,146
I just hope when you do...

1186
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:07,714
...that I'm there to see it.

1187
01:39:18,194 --> 01:39:20,424
- What you doing?
- What's it look like?

1188
01:39:21,764 --> 01:39:22,788
Where you going?

1189
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:25,531
I don't know.
I just gotta get away from here.

1190
01:39:28,938 --> 01:39:32,465
<i>Can I come with you, Rex?
- What?</i>

1191
01:39:32,641 --> 01:39:34,336
Can we come with you?

1192
01:39:36,812 --> 01:39:39,110
- No.
- Why not?

1193
01:39:46,856 --> 01:39:49,586
You'll understand when it's your turn.

1194
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:53,953
Speed.

1195
01:39:56,065 --> 01:40:00,661
Before you go, I'd like to say a few things.
Will you sit with your old man for a minute?

1196
01:40:02,171 --> 01:40:05,163
- Don't try to stop me.
- I won't.

1197
01:40:13,082 --> 01:40:17,018
Speed, I want you to know
I acted rashly.

1198
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,020
I said things I wish I hadn't.

1199
01:40:19,488 --> 01:40:22,719
Your mother usually protects me
from making an ass out of myself...

1200
01:40:22,892 --> 01:40:26,885
...but I was determined to do it this time,
and I guess I did a pretty good job of it.

1201
01:40:27,062 --> 01:40:31,021
I just wanted to make sure
you understood how sorry I was.

1202
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,667
Thanks.

1203
01:40:32,868 --> 01:40:35,996
The truth was I couldn't have been
more proud of you, son.

1204
01:40:36,172 --> 01:40:40,040
Not because you won, but because
you stood up, you weren't afraid...

1205
01:40:40,209 --> 01:40:42,677
...and you did what you thought
was right.

1206
01:40:42,845 --> 01:40:46,337
It didn't amount to anything.
It was completely meaningless.

1207
01:40:46,515 --> 01:40:48,949
How could it be meaningless?

1208
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:51,848
I saw my son become a man.

1209
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:54,148
I watched him act
with courage and integrity...

1210
01:40:54,323 --> 01:40:57,053
...and drive the pants off
every other driver on that road.

1211
01:40:57,226 --> 01:41:01,060
This is not meaningless.
This is a reason for a father's life.

1212
01:41:03,032 --> 01:41:06,001
I went to Cortega because I was
afraid what happened to Rex...

1213
01:41:06,168 --> 01:41:08,966
...was gonna happen to you,
and I just couldn't take that.

1214
01:41:09,438 --> 01:41:11,463
But what I realized at Cortega...

1215
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:15,569
...was I didn't lose Rex when he crashed.
I lost him here.

1216
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:20,882
I let him think that a stupid motor company
meant more to me than he did.

1217
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:25,545
He'll never know
how much I regret that mistake.

1218
01:41:26,322 --> 01:41:28,916
It's enough I'll never make it again.

1219
01:41:29,091 --> 01:41:34,654
Speed, I understand that
every child has to leave home...

1220
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:37,993
...but I want you to know,
that door is always open.

1221
01:41:38,167 --> 01:41:39,634
You can always come back.

1222
01:41:41,370 --> 01:41:43,304
Because I love you.

1223
01:41:45,574 --> 01:41:47,599
I love you, Pops.

1224
01:41:52,848 --> 01:41:55,544
I'm just so confused right now.

1225
01:41:56,151 --> 01:42:01,783
I feel like I'm caught in some kind of
a tailspin and no direction makes sense.

1226
01:42:01,957 --> 01:42:04,118
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1227
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:09,898
When Rex died, I didn't know if I wanted
salt on my eggs, let alone keep building cars.

1228
01:42:10,633 --> 01:42:14,501
But then... You remember that night...

1229
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:19,198
...we sat together, we watched old Ben
Burns and Stickleton? You remember that?

1230
01:42:19,775 --> 01:42:22,642
That night, something just clicked.

1231
01:42:22,811 --> 01:42:26,144
Like a light being switched on
inside of me.

1232
01:42:26,315 --> 01:42:29,716
After that, I never had trouble
remembering how I liked my eggs.

1233
01:42:30,486 --> 01:42:34,513
Jeez, Pops, that's just it.
That's part of my problem.

1234
01:42:34,957 --> 01:42:36,390
- What?
- That race...

1235
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:38,990
...the 43 Prix.

1236
01:42:39,428 --> 01:42:42,329
Burns and Stickleton? It was fixed.

1237
01:42:42,798 --> 01:42:45,028
Royalton told me the whole story.

1238
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:48,328
It was all about some DNF named Potts.

1239
01:42:48,637 --> 01:42:52,801
They've known the winner of every Grand
Prix for the past 50 years. It's always fixed.

1240
01:42:53,075 --> 01:42:54,565
Pfft!

1241
01:42:55,344 --> 01:42:59,474
I don't believe that. Royalton's a crook.
You can't believe a crook.

1242
01:43:00,082 --> 01:43:01,709
I don't think he was lying, Pops.

1243
01:43:02,084 --> 01:43:04,712
The Grand Prix, a sham?

1244
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:12,684
- Horuko.
- Forgive me for intruding...

1245
01:43:12,861 --> 01:43:15,022
...but I had to come
before it was too late.

1246
01:43:15,864 --> 01:43:16,888
This is not a trick.

1247
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:20,224
I swear to you. I'm not my brother.

1248
01:43:20,502 --> 01:43:23,300
You gonna ask the lovely lady in?

1249
01:43:24,473 --> 01:43:27,601
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1250
01:43:29,511 --> 01:43:31,706
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No.

1251
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:34,280
My security man believes
I'm still at the opera...

1252
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:36,847
...so I only have a moment.

1253
01:43:38,053 --> 01:43:40,146
I'm very sorry for what happened.

1254
01:43:40,322 --> 01:43:44,053
What my father and brother did
was not right, and I'm ashamed.

1255
01:43:44,493 --> 01:43:47,519
It's fine. Just another lesson learned.

1256
01:43:47,696 --> 01:43:51,132
No. It is they
who are in need of a lesson.

1257
01:43:51,667 --> 01:43:54,158
This rightfully belongs to you.

1258
01:43:58,974 --> 01:44:02,307
An invitation to compete
in the 91 st annual Grand Prix.

1259
01:44:02,478 --> 01:44:06,278
My brother was planning to decline anyway.
But I studied the rules very carefully.

1260
01:44:06,615 --> 01:44:08,742
And as a member of
the winning Togokahn Team...

1261
01:44:08,917 --> 01:44:13,684
...if you present this invitation on the day of
the race, they must allow you to compete.

1262
01:44:14,323 --> 01:44:17,656
Ha! What do you think of that,
Mr. It's-Always-Fixed?

1263
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:20,561
- l...
- You don't have to say anything.

1264
01:44:20,729 --> 01:44:23,323
I only hope you drive
as you did in Casa Cristo...

1265
01:44:23,499 --> 01:44:25,763
...and you wipe the smiles
from their faces.

1266
01:44:26,468 --> 01:44:27,799
We don't have a car.

1267
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:31,462
- Sparky!
- No. No. He'll yell at me!

1268
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:36,368
- Right here, Pops.
- What are you doing in the kitchen?

1269
01:44:36,545 --> 01:44:38,479
Same as everyone else.

1270
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:44,078
I don't believe it.
You were listening the whole time?

1271
01:44:44,253 --> 01:44:47,347
- And I'm so glad I did.
- We were so worried about you.

1272
01:44:48,457 --> 01:44:49,822
Horuko.

1273
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:51,921
Thank you.

1274
01:44:52,127 --> 01:44:55,358
I would say, "Good luck Saturday,"
but you don't need it.

1275
01:44:55,531 --> 01:44:58,762
You're already very lucky
to have such a family.

1276
01:44:59,735 --> 01:45:02,966
- Come on, we got work to do.
- The race is less than two days away.

1277
01:45:03,138 --> 01:45:06,505
How fast did Royalton say he could build
that tin can with his machines?

1278
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:07,699
Thirty-six hours.

1279
01:45:07,876 --> 01:45:11,209
Then we'll do it in 32. Come on, let's go.

1280
01:46:06,502 --> 01:46:08,094
Cameraman.

1281
01:46:30,759 --> 01:46:35,856
Ladies and gentlemen, behold the future!

1282
01:46:40,302 --> 01:46:42,202
Sparky? You ready?

1283
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:45,600
Ready, Pops.

1284
01:46:48,076 --> 01:46:50,704
Pops, that's a Bernoulli Convergenator.

1285
01:46:50,879 --> 01:46:55,009
Transponder schmonder.
You want real kick, you go Bernoulli.

1286
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:00,752
Were you here last year?

1287
01:47:00,923 --> 01:47:02,720
- Yes, you were.
- No.

1288
01:47:08,263 --> 01:47:11,960
The Colosseum has begun to fill,
final preparations are under way.

1289
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:15,433
We're expecting the largest television
audience in Grand Prix history.

1290
01:47:15,604 --> 01:47:18,835
<i>We've got an incredible lineup
this year, like the Grey Ghost...</i>

1291
01:47:19,007 --> 01:47:23,842
<i>... Sonic "Boom-boom" Renaldi, Nitro
Venderhoss and The Scarlet Valentine.</i>

1292
01:47:24,012 --> 01:47:25,070
Not to mention C-Ball.

1293
01:47:25,247 --> 01:47:27,807
Cannonball Taylor,
fastest Grand Prix seed in history...

1294
01:47:27,983 --> 01:47:31,783
<i>... driving the new GRX
from Royalton Race Cars.</i>

1295
01:47:46,268 --> 01:47:49,032
- Thanks, doll.
- You're welcome.

1296
01:47:49,204 --> 01:47:52,537
<i>We've got an odd-numbered field
this year, one shy of a full boat...</i>

1297
01:47:52,708 --> 01:47:57,839
<i>... as Taejo Togokahn declined his automatic
invitation after winning the Casa Cristo.</i>

1298
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:03,541
All right, let's start her up.

1299
01:48:06,955 --> 01:48:08,513
Sounds beefy, Pops.

1300
01:48:08,690 --> 01:48:11,488
Yeah, I gave it a little something extra.

1301
01:48:13,762 --> 01:48:15,662
Come on, let's load it up.

1302
01:48:15,831 --> 01:48:19,597
Hold on.
Something's going on over there.

1303
01:48:19,768 --> 01:48:22,965
We're seeing some kind of commotion
down at the trailer entrance.

1304
01:48:28,777 --> 01:48:30,677
Excuse me.

1305
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,575
Is there a problem here, officer?

1306
01:48:35,851 --> 01:48:38,513
Why, you sly dog.

1307
01:48:38,854 --> 01:48:41,721
Sir, we have a problem.

1308
01:48:42,057 --> 01:48:43,718
Excuse me.

1309
01:48:43,926 --> 01:48:46,121
What madness is going on here?

1310
01:48:46,395 --> 01:48:50,024
Mr. Royalton, this is a legitimate invitation.
We have verified it.

1311
01:48:52,467 --> 01:48:55,664
- Where did you get this?
- I won it fair and square.

1312
01:48:56,939 --> 01:48:59,965
This is preposterous. He can't
be allowed to race. It's too late.

1313
01:49:00,142 --> 01:49:02,235
The ruling on this is clear.
Try to stop it...

1314
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:05,175
...and you'll be in blatant violation
of the WRL charter...

1315
01:49:05,347 --> 01:49:08,111
...leaving me no option
but to shut this year's Prix down...

1316
01:49:08,283 --> 01:49:10,410
...until a full investigation
can be completed.

1317
01:49:10,585 --> 01:49:15,716
What? Have you any idea what
that would cost? Are you insane?

1318
01:49:15,891 --> 01:49:16,915
Try me.

1319
01:49:17,092 --> 01:49:20,926
Something big is going on
because every race official has...

1320
01:49:21,096 --> 01:49:23,564
Wait, wait, an announcement
is being made.

1321
01:49:23,732 --> 01:49:26,064
<i>Now driving in the 40th and final position...</i>

1322
01:49:26,234 --> 01:49:27,360
<i>Holy sh * *!</i>

1323
01:49:27,736 --> 01:49:31,763
<i>... for Racer Motors in the Mach 6,
Speed Racer.</i>

1324
01:49:38,046 --> 01:49:41,846
A million dollars to the driver
that takes out Racer.

1325
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:44,948
He won't even get out of the blocks.

1326
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:49,283
I'd prefer him to not even
make it out of the locker room.

1327
01:49:52,694 --> 01:49:55,891
We're installing a spearhook in the GRX.

1328
01:49:56,064 --> 01:49:58,464
I don't need one to beat that punk.

1329
01:50:00,469 --> 01:50:02,130
A precaution.

1330
01:50:02,838 --> 01:50:04,601
<i>As the cars take to the field...</i>

1331
01:50:04,773 --> 01:50:08,470
...you can feel the anticipation
mounting in the audience.

1332
01:50:08,643 --> 01:50:10,804
<i>Something is different.</i>

1333
01:50:10,979 --> 01:50:12,776
<i>There's an electricity in the air.</i>

1334
01:50:12,948 --> 01:50:15,007
<i>The presence of Speed Racer...</i>

1335
01:50:15,183 --> 01:50:19,017
<i>... has completely changed the equation.</i>

1336
01:50:33,535 --> 01:50:35,025
How are you feeling?

1337
01:50:37,506 --> 01:50:39,064
It's big.

1338
01:50:41,843 --> 01:50:44,710
That cockpit is the exact same size
it was at Thunderhead.

1339
01:50:46,548 --> 01:50:47,810
Right.

1340
01:50:50,118 --> 01:50:52,052
I wanna say thank you...

1341
01:50:52,921 --> 01:50:56,186
...for what could be the most exciting
moment in my whole life.

1342
01:50:56,358 --> 01:50:58,553
Couldn't have gotten here without you.

1343
01:51:04,833 --> 01:51:08,667
- I'm looking forward to that cold milk.
- Me too.

1344
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:18,169
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines!</i>

1345
01:51:24,152 --> 01:51:25,915
<i>The final countdown has begun...</i>

1346
01:51:26,488 --> 01:51:28,956
...and a stillness
has fallen over this stadium...

1347
01:51:29,124 --> 01:51:32,958
...as all eyes turn to one car.

1348
01:51:39,668 --> 01:51:41,192
<i>Ten.</i>

1349
01:51:44,973 --> 01:51:49,205
This ain't a race, this is a showdown.

1350
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:12,059
Trouble at the start. A misfire traps
Speed Racer, causing a collision.

1351
01:52:12,234 --> 01:52:13,565
Uh-oh. Look out.

1352
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:23,100
Ooh, that kid is wily!

1353
01:52:23,278 --> 01:52:25,212
<i>I don't know how he got out of that one.</i>

1354
01:52:58,847 --> 01:53:00,405
Nice, nice.

1355
01:53:00,582 --> 01:53:04,279
<i>Speed Racer blows by Katsu
Toppledama, charging into the Moguls.</i>

1356
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:06,683
<i>He's taking on all comers.</i>

1357
01:53:06,855 --> 01:53:09,050
<i>Kelly Kellencoff makes a move,
cuts him off!</i>

1358
01:53:09,224 --> 01:53:11,920
<i>Ah, big mistake!
- Speed fakes left, jumps right.</i>

1359
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:13,852
<i>He slips in behind Gearbox.</i>

1360
01:53:14,029 --> 01:53:16,088
Here comes over-under.

1361
01:53:24,005 --> 01:53:25,199
I told you! I told you!

1362
01:53:25,373 --> 01:53:30,208
Speed Racer seems unstoppable, moving up
from dead last, nearing the leaders.

1363
01:53:35,083 --> 01:53:36,311
Go, Speed, go!

1364
01:54:19,527 --> 01:54:22,826
But look out. As they approach
the Big Drop, here comes Speed Racer.

1365
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:09,376
Speed Racer is knocking on the door
of Cannonball Taylor.

1366
01:55:09,544 --> 01:55:12,012
"Yoo-hoo, anybody home?"

1367
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:20,083
Okay, Mr. Two-Time-Grand-Prix-
Five-Time-WRL-Future-Hall-of-Fame...

1368
01:55:20,255 --> 01:55:21,620
...teach me something.

1369
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:29,927
You ready?

1370
01:55:30,098 --> 01:55:31,827
- Ha-ha.
- Let's go.

1371
01:55:41,676 --> 01:55:43,473
Get that weak shit off my track.

1372
01:55:54,122 --> 01:55:55,555
Come on, that move is weak.

1373
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:01,019
Cannonball Taylor's in trouble.

1374
01:56:05,934 --> 01:56:08,129
Tear him up, kid, tear him up.

1375
01:56:20,949 --> 01:56:22,678
Come on, is that all you got?

1376
01:56:31,326 --> 01:56:34,193
Lesson's over. See you at the finish line.

1377
01:56:36,531 --> 01:56:39,364
Do it. Stop him. Stop him now.

1378
01:56:47,809 --> 01:56:49,401
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

1379
01:56:49,577 --> 01:56:51,704
Spearhook! He's got me.

1380
01:56:52,981 --> 01:56:57,008
<i>Cannonball has Speed pinned
as they grind through the butterfly turn.</i>

1381
01:56:57,185 --> 01:57:00,621
That cheater. He's using a spearhook!

1382
01:57:40,328 --> 01:57:43,593
Cannonball clearly using a spearhook.

1383
01:57:43,798 --> 01:57:45,527
That could cost him the hall of fame.

1384
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:47,759
<i>Not to mention what it'll do
to Royalton Industries.</i>

1385
01:57:47,936 --> 01:57:49,335
<i>Shame on them.</i>

1386
01:57:55,977 --> 01:57:58,275
Oh, no, no, no, don't do this!

1387
01:57:58,446 --> 01:58:02,610
- The Triple Phase Conductor's fried.
- Sparky, get me back in this race.

1388
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:08,453
- What's wrong?
- The crash must've dislodged the conductor.

1389
01:58:08,623 --> 01:58:09,647
Starter's overloaded.

1390
01:58:14,696 --> 01:58:18,223
- The nickelhydrate cells are hemorrhaging.
- What do I do?

1391
01:58:18,399 --> 01:58:20,162
Don't panic.

1392
01:58:20,735 --> 01:58:23,295
Just listen, Speed. Just listen to her.

1393
01:58:23,471 --> 01:58:27,134
- If I could defibrillate the...
- Shh. Sparky. Give me a second.

1394
01:58:31,379 --> 01:58:32,676
Is there anything he can do?

1395
01:58:32,847 --> 01:58:35,372
I ran a patch through the starter
to the Convergenator.

1396
01:58:35,550 --> 01:58:38,485
If he puts the car in fifth gear,
he could jump-start it.

1397
01:58:38,653 --> 01:58:39,779
Will he know that?

1398
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:43,316
Would Sparky?

1399
01:58:47,862 --> 01:58:49,830
What do you need?

1400
01:59:05,613 --> 01:59:06,671
He's back in it!

1401
01:59:13,288 --> 01:59:14,346
Come on, kid, move it!

1402
01:59:17,825 --> 01:59:19,087
He's gonna do it.

1403
01:59:20,194 --> 01:59:21,957
<i>I don't know why I'm doing it anymore.</i>

1404
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:24,963
You don't climb into a T-180
to be a driver.

1405
01:59:25,266 --> 01:59:27,734
<i>You do it because you're driven.</i>

1406
01:59:28,202 --> 01:59:30,500
<i>Racing has nothing to do
with cars or drivers.</i>

1407
01:59:30,672 --> 01:59:32,663
<i>You ready to put away your toys
and grow up?</i>

1408
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:35,138
Are you ready to become
a real racecar driver?

1409
01:59:36,811 --> 01:59:40,747
Look at the split.
He's shattering the lap record.

1410
01:59:40,915 --> 01:59:43,816
<i>If you know so much,
tell me why I should keep driving.</i>

1411
01:59:44,052 --> 01:59:45,485
That's for you to figure out.

1412
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:47,988
<i>I just hope when you do...</i>

1413
01:59:48,823 --> 01:59:50,313
...that I'm there to see it.

1414
01:59:57,432 --> 02:00:00,162
<i>When I watch you do
some of the things you do...</i>

1415
02:00:03,338 --> 02:00:05,135
...when you just take my breath away.

1416
02:00:13,281 --> 02:00:14,373
You remember that night?

1417
02:00:14,549 --> 02:00:17,518
<i>We sat together, we watched
old Ben Burns and Stickleton.</i>

1418
02:00:17,685 --> 02:00:19,414
<i>That night, something just...</i>

1419
02:00:20,054 --> 02:00:21,453
...clicked.

1420
02:00:30,531 --> 02:00:33,261
<i>Racing hasn't changed and it never will.</i>

1421
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:41,905
<i>It doesn't matter
if racing never changes. What matters...</i>

1422
02:00:42,076 --> 02:00:44,101
...is if we let racing change us.

1423
02:00:49,283 --> 02:00:53,617
<i>When I'm in a T- 180, I don't know,
everything just makes sense.</i>

1424
02:00:54,689 --> 02:00:57,055
No hesitation. Nothing fazes him.

1425
02:00:57,225 --> 02:00:59,159
<i>No one seems capable of stopping him.</i>

1426
02:00:59,327 --> 02:01:00,351
He's on a mission.

1427
02:01:00,528 --> 02:01:03,053
With a quarter-lap to go,
Speed Racer is back.

1428
02:01:04,632 --> 02:01:06,896
<i>Two cars between him and destiny.</i>

1429
02:01:07,068 --> 02:01:10,060
Stop him!

1430
02:01:10,471 --> 02:01:12,336
Here we go again.

1431
02:01:28,489 --> 02:01:29,581
Yes!

1432
02:01:49,343 --> 02:01:50,867
Speed Racer!

1433
02:02:55,510 --> 02:02:59,742
<i>It's pandemonium.
People here have gone completely crazy.</i>

1434
02:03:00,047 --> 02:03:03,073
In 14 years, we've never
seen anything like this.

1435
02:03:03,384 --> 02:03:06,615
It's a whole new world, baby.
It's a whole new world.

1436
02:03:44,158 --> 02:03:46,092
He did it.

1437
02:03:47,395 --> 02:03:50,660
- Yes, he did.
- This could change everything.

1438
02:03:51,933 --> 02:03:53,195
It already has.

1439
02:03:56,037 --> 02:03:59,996
My men are bringing the family down.
Do you wanna go with them?

1440
02:04:03,177 --> 02:04:04,610
No.

1441
02:04:06,681 --> 02:04:08,876
Can I ask you a question?

1442
02:04:09,851 --> 02:04:13,343
Did you ever think you made a mistake,
hiding the truth from them?

1443
02:05:01,602 --> 02:05:03,433
If I did...

1444
02:05:05,139 --> 02:05:07,699
...it's a mistake I have to live with.

1445
02:05:20,321 --> 02:05:21,618
Whoa!

1446
02:05:21,789 --> 02:05:22,847
Speed!

1447
02:05:45,046 --> 02:05:46,707
Speed!

1448
02:05:51,185 --> 02:05:54,245
Thank you, Speed. I love you, sweetie.

1449
02:05:54,422 --> 02:05:56,583
That was so beautiful.

1450
02:05:56,757 --> 02:05:58,190
I'm proud of you, son.

Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
