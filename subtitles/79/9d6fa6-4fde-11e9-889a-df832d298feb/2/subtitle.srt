1
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:02,997
Oh my---

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:05,171
What's with the mask?

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,399
I thought this was the only
way to be honest to you

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,907
- Sang-mi, I love you
- What?

5
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:13,610
- Have you been drinking?
- Just a little

6
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:17,581
Who do you think will win
if Hwang-bo raced a tortoise?

7
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:19,409
A tortoise will win

8
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:22,316
Then who do you think will win
if I raced the tortoise?

9
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:23,717
I will

10
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,756
I'll prove it to you right here

11
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,963
- Hey Sang-mi, count three for me
- What?

12
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:32,190
I'll show you
how much I love you

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,732
- One
- One

14
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,937
Two--- Three---

15
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,490
We're going in

16
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:50,201
We should've done
marathon too

17
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,013
Stop!

18
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,756
Hey, that's a bomb
Stop!

19
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,992
Don't drink that

20
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:40,386
Where's the PPX bag?

21
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:54,705
Hey Yamada sang

22
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,968
Any suspects
you're thinking of?

23
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,438
Do you have any?

24
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:06,053
- Well--- I'm thinking the director
- The director?

25
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:08,516
- Make some sense, will you??
- What?

26
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:12,089
He's been overly anxious lately
He's definitely up to something

27
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,290
Caught right on the scene---

28
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:18,498
You think you guys have time
to just sip coffee?

29
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:23,197
- Why just me?
- What?

30
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,362
He had coffee too, you know

31
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,942
I only go for one

32
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,678
- Sir!
- What now?

33
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,711
What is it?

34
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,419
What kind of an asshole
would call collect?

35
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,080
Tell him to pay himself

36
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,416
And, you---

37
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:51,961
Tell him that this is Murakami
Hello? Hello?

38
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:05,569
Brother, don’t hang up man
Please don’t hang up

39
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:11,745
Remember the green fish, bro?
Green fish!

40
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:16,550
When I was little,
I was catch that green fish---

41
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,591
Then I lost my slipper

42
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:24,696
Then you and other brothers
beat the crap out of me---

43
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,734
Hey bro, you remember that?

44
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,743
- You remember that?
- Excuse me/- Yes?

45
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:44,108
Sorry to interrupt while you' re
talking, but you got a coins---

46
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:48,913
Brother, please don’t hang up
Please don’t hang up brother

47
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:55,792
Hey bro, do you remember that?

48
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,056
Do you remember that or not?

49
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:02,535
You don’t?

50
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:07,870
Hey shithead,
you think life's that easy?

51
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,737
Sir, another call for you

52
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,706
I said not to bother

53
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,972
He keeps on insisting
that he's Murakami

54
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,343
Oh shit

55
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,519
Yes, I am the director
in charge

56
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:34,697
This is Murakami of the
honorable MMP

57
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:38,201
You should've said---
I would've picked up

58
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:43,433
Forget that, I want to speak to
an old friend of mine

59
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,871
Your Korean got better

60
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,116
What are you a tour guide
now or something?

61
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:54,049
Hey, gook
Just listen

62
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:58,223
We placed PPXs at major
public vicinities around Seoul

63
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:02,187
You know of PPX, right?

64
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:03,486
What do you want?

65
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,256
Just relax

66
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,197
The first one will be
at the new Worldcup stadium

67
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:12,167
It's going to detonate
in exactly 30 minutes

68
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:15,542
You're probably startled

69
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,102
Have you ever
been to Takeshima?

70
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:20,371
You mean Dok-do?

71
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:24,677
When I was in the navy, I used
to carefully observe Takeshima

72
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:29,054
You Koreans insist that
Takeshima's yours

73
00:06:29,257 --> 00:06:31,452
But you people know
nothing about it

74
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:33,726
- Takeshima---
- Dok-do is

75
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:36,088
comprised of the
West island and the East island

76
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:39,094
The east island is
64, 698 square meters

77
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,526
And the east,
91,773 square meters

78
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:46,173
Longitude, 131 ° 52 min 22 sec,
Latitude, 37 ° 14 min 12 sec

79
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,500
It's only 90 miles apart
from the Ullung island

80
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:51,373
But it's almost 160 miles
from the nearest

81
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:52,945
Japanese island, Okki

82
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:55,012
- In history, Takeshima is---
- Takeshima is---

83
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:56,650
Historically, Dok-do has been
acquired into our territory---

84
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:59,378
BC 512, 13th year
of King Jijung's rule

85
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,278
Well---that's your story
The Japanese history has it that

86
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,482
in the 17th century---

87
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:04,716
If you look in the
Unju records,

88
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,555
And in the 1896 text written

89
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:11,631
by the Japanese
foreign ministry,

90
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,097
they acknowledge
Dok-do as Korean

91
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:17,261
I did some research of my own
So what?

92
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:19,771
I didn't say anything
I was just go to say that

93
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,535
that's the name of our mission
That's great genius

94
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,111
Couldn't get him, sir

95
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,243
Why the hell did you make
him hang up you fuck?

96
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:35,916
What are you here for?
Send forces to the stadium

97
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:55,827
Move!

98
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:16,985
What? You separated them
to save money?

99
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:24,798
And mixed water
in them too?

100
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,029
Okay!

101
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,565
It's possible that the remains
may explode, so keep searching

102
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:34,231
Hey, come here you two

103
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,433
I thought the guy would
be more daring than that

104
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:42,338
Only one trash bin in the
entire frigging stadium

105
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:45,316
Trash bin Trash bin Trash bin

106
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,419
Any leads, boys?
This is too strange

107
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,122
Are you fucking with us?

108
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:57,494
This time that was it

109
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,993
But wait for next time

110
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:03,132
Just be honest,
you lost the PPX, right?

111
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:12,476
That's PPX alright
Check the ingredients

112
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,374
Thought you had
me there for a second

113
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:21,583
Where's the next one at?
The Jang-chung Arena?

114
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:26,592
I'll be back Fangbo

115
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,858
I'll blow it all up

116
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,932
How would I know that
they were just water?

117
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,601
This is good

118
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:53,211
- Hey look at this
- What?

119
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,887
Put more water in you fuck
The soup's too salty

120
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,522
It's fine

121
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,918
- It's salty
- No it's not

122
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:02,221
- It is too
- It's not

123
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:03,454
It is too

124
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,775
Would you believe me if I
had said this is the Mia district?

125
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:19,434
I am standing in front of Mia's
apartment explosion scene

126
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,410
Early this morning at around
4 o'clock, there was a doubt-fire

127
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,347
that has turned the entire area
into one gigantic rubble

128
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,681
The whole area
has been effected

129
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:31,947
The police said that---
homeless teenagers were---

130
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:34,357
supposedly trying to cook
where an explosion took place

131
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:38,464
They will take the butane
seller into custody for interrogation

132
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,963
They boiled PPX in the pot?

133
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,405
- Hello?
- This is Murakami

134
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:52,644
You fuck! Why are you
harming innocent civilians?

135
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:53,973
We didn't do it

136
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,848
Well--- you guys are the
ones with PPX

137
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,039
Someone took it from us
What the fuck are

138
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,581
you talking about?

139
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,755
I'm serious
We just saw the news too

140
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:08,387
Are you listening?

141
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,656
I'm going berserk too

142
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:13,891
- What are you doing?
- Go Go Go

143
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,797
Hello?
Hello?

144
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,657
Time out

145
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,871
Move!

146
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,174
We got five
How many do they have?

147
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,744
- Thirty, sir
- Shit---thirty?

148
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,709
We're go to get schooled
You know what, right?

149
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,009
- Yes
- Do not go one on one

150
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:53,881
We need to go zone
When he's covering him,

151
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:55,749
you shoot
When he's covering him,

152
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:57,117
you shoot
What the hell is wrong with you?

153
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,351
You go when you're supposed to
You're not go to

154
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,485
get all three at once

155
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,393
- Make sure you cover them
- And you--- you just shut up

156
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,591
Whatever we're not
going down either

157
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,333
Why do you look all tired?

158
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:10,492
They got five

159
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,070
We got thirty and can't get
a single one of them

160
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:13,571
What's with you people?

161
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,436
We need more people
We don't have enough---

162
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:20,507
- Just listen to--- the rebound---
- Why can't you get that? Try

163
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,309
Just do as you would in practice
Are you guys with me?

164
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:26,146
Kill them all today
Come on--- just like in practice

165
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,480
Come on guys I'm with you
Head to head

166
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,621
Hey!
Are you boys ready to rock?

167
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,314
- Hey!
- Fighting!

168
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,221
- Go
- Go

169
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,291
Fire!

170
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:00,317
24 hours after
the exchange fire

171
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:01,786
- What time is it?
- It's the 24th hour, sir

172
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,448
Not 25th

173
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:06,649
No---
I meant what time is it?

174
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,659
They're good chasers

175
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:13,062
- I think I'm go to throw up
- Hey, which Arirang is that?

176
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,929

00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,883

Isn't this a gunshot wound?

186
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,038
Yes

187
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:13,913
I need to report to the police

188
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,357
I did already

189
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,261
I was at the US Army protest
rally and somehow got shot our---

190
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,226
- I didn't see it coming at all
- What? The Army base?

191
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:26,991
They just shot me out of nowhere

192
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:30,499
- And couldn't avoid the shot
- How dare they---

193
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:32,795
Fucking head!

194
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,472
Let's go We need to take
care of the wound first

195
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,571
But uhhh---

196
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,310
By any chance---

197
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,044
Are you in the National
Collegiate Protesters' Union?

198
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,850
I sure am
I'm a NCPU member

00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,955
I was the fourth year
member of the NCPU

201
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:58,897
I haven't felt such urging
patriotism in quite some time

202
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:46,697
If we break up, then we'll
come back to open it

203
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,770
What if we never break up?

204
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,977
- Will you leave it here?
- You don't like the idea?

205
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,677
Well--- I'll be all curious---

206
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,677
- about what's inside
- Oh yeah?

207
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,973

- Just break up with me
- What? Are you crazy?

209
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:02,153
I'm pissed

210
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,956

a year's worth of

211
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:07,356
- salary for when we're old
- A year's worth?

212
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:10,190

What if somebody digs it up?

213
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,355
- Really?
- Don't worry

214
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:13,430
They will have developed a

215
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:17,567
time machine in the future
So we can come back

216
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:22,167

Oh my---
Are you okay?

229
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:31,299
On the first day of his visit,
the emperor has ended his

230
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,939
day's chores and is now resting
at the Shilla hotel The cops

232
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,042
all around the hotel

233
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:41,610
Tomorrow morning, the emperor
will meet with President for

234
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:44,717
breakfast and in the afternoon

235
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:48,982

241
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:17,913
Guess you could say that

242
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:21,513
You must've tried
your best to miss

243
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:25,016
a guy that was practically
in your face

244
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,559
Hanako--- you've changed

245
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,100
What are you doing?

246
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,396
What's wrong? What?

247
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:43,973
Why would you drink
the last remaining PPX?

248
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,577
This is PPX?

249
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:51,007
You should've told me

250
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:04,594
I give up

251
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:09,959
I want to go

252
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,653
Where's your partner?

Don't take this the wrong way

270
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:19,783
I didn't take this to watch
you fuck or anything

271
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,156
You've grown

272
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:31,269
Well---I was always a little

273
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:33,999
bit taller than you, wasn't I?

274
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:38,171
Do you have a death wish?

275
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:50,383
Regardless,
you should forget---

276
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:53,787
about this and forget Sang-mi
Understand?

277
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,825
You're losing it, aren't you?

282
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:21,079
It's okay to make it
complicated

283
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:31,419
If you're go to be
so stubborn,

284
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:35,557
I'm go to go sell
this shit to porn dealers

- Did the heart stop?

310
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,194
Isn't this one of those electric
shock thingies for heart failure?

311
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:31,589
No, it's not

312
00:35:31,898 --> 00:35:33,923
It looks similar---
but it's different

313
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,758
This is just a spray

314
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,004
What are you doing?

315
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,334
Off of me!
I'm going to a local hospital

316
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:50,241
You can't get this type
of treatment at local hospitals

317
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:52,277
Don't give me attitude,
young lady

318
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:55,986
How dare do you look

You only cause
trouble anyway

326
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,535
Just stay outside and wait

327
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:02,354
Everybody listen to me

328
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:05,984
We're almost there now

329
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:08,392

You have to come this way

and the emperor of Japan

344
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,944
Let's welcome them with
a round of applause

345
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:25,026
What are you doing?
The ceremony has started

346
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:54,244
Hold on a second
This is the staff waiting room

347
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:58,200

348
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,512
This is so pathetic

349
00:43:05,184 --> 00:43:06,947
Where's the PPX?

350
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:09,454
Go find it yourself

351
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:12,154
Shut up and just cough it up

352
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:15,788
This is Murakami!

353
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:18,028

354
