want to take a look, sir

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,837
Why don't you just leave it there

11
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,301

00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,767
Don't worry
You'll get used to it

22
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,334
- May I ask your name?
- What?

23
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,073
I guess you can
just call me Kim

24
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:29,208
Oh yeah? My last name's
Kim too, you know

25

- Me too

26
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:36,587
Guess you've been doing this
for quite some time now, huh?

27
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,656
Yeah I really enjoy it

28
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,361
It's a good way of
relieving your stress

29
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,326
I like to get on
it from time to time

30
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:48,761
Excuse me, but may I ask
how old you are?

31
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,671
42--- born in 69

32
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,433
You're a lot younger than I am

33
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:02,305
I see how you're new to this
Age really isn't that important

34
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,309
Why don't we just be friends?

00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,721
A Funny Movie

36
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,551
(March 2002, Japan)

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,290
Mission complete!

38
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,709
Director / KIM Sang-jin from
<Attack the Gas Station>

39
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,220
Director Debut/
JANG Kyu-sung

40
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:59,265
As there has been some diligent
peace making efforts throughout

41
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,408
the peninsula, fear has ignited
among the Japanese extreme

42
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,476
rightists for their minimizing
power in Asia

43
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,703
Especially the million men
patriots led by Hanako---

44
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:11,112
has been prevalent throughout

45
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,046
Sang-chul Kim, the victim of
earlier murder as you know---

46
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,710
He was the guy that ran---

47
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,052
In Dok-do we stand' website
He was a great guy

48
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,794
As the Japanese history textbook
fiasco was gaining worldwide

49
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,590
attention---
I believe they assassinated the

50
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,798
man to show Japan resistance
Maybe they were trying to tell

51
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:28,992
us to stay our of their business
Sir!

52
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,264
Don't we know that already?

53
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,900
You're right

54
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,977
But, uhhh--- anyway,

55
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,384
Our No 1 priority is---
getting Hanako in our hands

56
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,619
Hey shithead!

57
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,360
I said not to fuck around
during meetings!

58
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,996
Listen when I say shit
You fuck! You fuck!

59
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,828
Come here, you piece of shit
Come here!

60
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,271
What does your father do?

61
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,573
- He's a gangster, sir
- What?

62
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,237
A gangster?

63
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,309
Are you trying
to fuck with me?

64
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,879
You're fucking with me,
aren't you?

65
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,142
So are you happy now that
your father's a fucking thug?

66
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,684
Are you happy now?
Stupid fuck!

67
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,354
I never said
I was proud of it

68
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,424
Let's go Gabdu

69
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,584
Hey, you Fangbo!
Stop right there you---

70
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,162
- Sir
- What?

71
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,794
I think you made a mistake
His father really is a gangster

72
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,226
What?

73
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,095
You serious?

74
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,973
He's the KP lead and---

75
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,942
I'm the vice lead

76
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,937
Hey!

77
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,110
I thought you were kidding

78
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,949
You're right, I was

79
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,283
What the---

80
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:02,087
Are you guys trying to
fuck with me here?

81
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,023
You think this is a joke?

82
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,189
You fucking shithead!

83
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:12,065
Don't ever fuck
with me like this

84
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,370
- What is this?
- Pardon?

85
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,675
This isn't what I wanted

86
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,939
This here is what I wanted

87
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,584
How can you do this to me?

88
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:05,951
Why do you think I paid you?
I was much better off before

89
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,858
You're making things rather
difficult for me here miss

90
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,394
How is this better than now?

91
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:19,067
How do you cut it like that?
I'm a doctor, not a sculptor

92
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,431
What?

93
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:22,935
Why couldn't you?

94
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,338
Please take a careful
look at the angle here

95
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,705
To hell with this

96
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,280
In any case, this surgery
doesn't count It's bull shit

97
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,411
- UhhhUmmm---
- I'm out fuck

98
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,915
- Philosophy
- Yale

99
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,820
- Economy
- Yankee

100
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,490
Yankee?
Those suckers

101
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,722
- Buffalo
- October

102
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,900
Wait!, You were supposed
to use E, not B

103
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,033
You're right, I'm sorry
Okay

104
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,799
- Escape!
- Integrity

105
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,069
Give me a break here

106
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,210
What's wrong with integrity?
Whatever---

107
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,377
Enough of that!

108
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,949
Guess I won

109
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,088
You want to go for
one more round?

110
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,263
- I'm good now
- What do you mean?

111
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:22,262
Isn't this great? Playing
games I never played before---

112
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,638
There are tons of other
games out there you can play

113
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,536
You know, there's Beer-pong,

114
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,177
Bull-shit, Waterfall
There are plenty of'em

115
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,910
Really?
How do you play them?

116
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,879
Well---I can't exactly teach
you over the radio---

117
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,217
Why don't I teach you when
we meet up in person?

118
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,688
Okay!

119
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:21,091
- Are you sure this is the Okryu's?
- Yes sir It's Okryu's Seoul

120
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,715
Why didn't you show up?

121
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:58,757
Hey, Mr. Kim
I do understand---

122
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:03,066
how you'd be
ashamed to meet me,

123
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:08,197
but you still should've
kept your word

124
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,632
What are you talking about?

125
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:14,503
I waited two hours
in the rain

126
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,108
What do you mean, rain?
Come on, Kim

127
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,681
You owe me
an apology here

128
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,049
You're the one
that should apologize

129
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:30,023
Were you waiting at Pyongyang's
Okryu's or something?

130
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,699
Of course, I was at Okryu's
in Pyongyang

131
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,731
Where the heck else?

132
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,267
What did you just say?

133
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,510
Pyongyang instead of Seoul?

134
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,177
Seoul?

135
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,745
Oh my lord!

136
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:02,619
Your voice sounds rather familiar
from that South Korean news

137
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:07,659
You know what, your voice
sounds familiar as well

138
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:31,150
Chairman Kim, why
don't we meet up for real?

139
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,583
It's such a shame to throw
this opportunity away

140
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,156
I mean---the talks
we shared so far---

141
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,330
Didn't you mean them?

142
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,061
You're right

143
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:46,132
After all, we share the
same blood, don't we?

144
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,463
- Let's meet!
- Let's do that

145
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,560
(October 2002, Seoul)

146
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,904
I think our man Kim Jung-ho
here is acting too tough

147
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,548
I mean--- the Japs are go to get
pissed, What are you doing?

148
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,254
Man---that's awesome
Try that again---

149
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,786
A little harder this time

150
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,866
Right on

151
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:03,513
- I think she saw me
- Fuck, what do we do now?

152
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,376
You guys are from the KP, right?
Jung-ho Kim here

153
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,559
I came undercover
for reasons of my own

154
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,113
Sir, what did you say?

155
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,582
Coke, juice, and iced tea---
is it that hard for you to get?

156
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,188
Did you get hit in the
head when you were little?

157
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,274
- What happened?
- He's gone Where's Kim Jung-ho?

158
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,913
The fucking guy had to make
us pay for his juice and die---

159
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,946
Honey!
Are you okay?

160
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:34,324
- Don't worry. I just had a nightmare
- What?

161
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,792
I'm so sorry honey

162
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:44,430
These scissors must be cursed

163
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:52,042
- What are you doing awake late?
- Just doing some cross-stitching

164
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:57,348
- Just go back to sleep hon
- Okay

165
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,060
Identification Confirmed

166
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,833
KIM Jung-ho,
who has been brutally---

167
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:59,271
murdered by Hanako,
heavily---

168
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,038
criticized Japan's rightist stance,
felt compelled to call us

169
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,444
Hanako's not the only Japanese
extreme rightist terrorist,

170
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,010
How can you make such
a shallow judgment?

171
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,550
The first shot is supposed to hit
No 2 neck vertebrate and

172
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,290
the second,
No 3 neck vertebrate

173
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:17,327
Hanako is the only terrorist to
always fuck up on the first shot

174
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,355
Also,

175
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:25,032
Hanako was responsible for
the earlier restaurant massacre

176
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:29,672
So, if you know
her so damn well---

177
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,609
Why the hell did you lose her?

178
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,340
And---

179
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:48,315
What the hell are you?
What is this, nap time?

180
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,058
It's been over a year since
we took over this case

181
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,936
For crying out loud,
I worked my ass of to---

182
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,640
get to where I am today

183
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,808
So just go out there
and go find Hanako

184
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,246
Get out and go get her now!
Go fucking get her!

185
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,546
Go get her you fucks!

186
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,112
Go fucking get her!

187
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,166
Don't you find it strange?

188
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,065
What do you mean?

189
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,270
We got there right after we
received a call from Kim Jung-ho

190
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,710
So how in the world did
she get there before we did?

191
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,916
Maybe there's an
intel leak within the KP

192
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,812
That's a possibility

193
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,556
Yeah---but it's the KP
we're talking about

194
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,823
Guess not then

195
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,366
Are you joking around?

196
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:03,860
Yeah

197
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,199
That was so lame

198
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,274
Even the fish here agree

199
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,644
Aren't you going
to marry Sang-mi?

200
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,472
Marriage?

201
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:20,415
Does that word get your
heartbeat going or what?

202
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,818
I don't know man---
I don't think I can trust her

203
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,689
Man--- she acts all
suspicious sometimes

204
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,156
What are you talking about?

205
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,600
I mean---

206
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,501
I think she got a nose job, and
got her neck line done as well

207
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:44,640
But I'm not exactly into
the whole plastic surgery thing

208
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:50,213
Chill out man As long as
she has a nice personality---

209
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,211
Come on man--- you know
what I'm talking about

210
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:56,386
She goes ape shit on me
sometimes when she's drunk

211
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,089
- Shut up man
- You have to appreciate her

212
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,090
you tell her to come out with us?
Let's all go catch a movie

213
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,429
- Movie my ass
- Did she really get plastic surgery?

214
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,098
- You can tell man
- For real?

215
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,891
Oh---this patient's for cleaning
You're not supposed to take it out

216
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,760
Talk to me now
Can you tell my eye lashes?

217
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,131
- No No Not at all
- Can you tell my nose job?

218
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,464
- The neck line's terrible!
- What?

219
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:52,702
If he dies, I will too

220
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,410
- Jin-ha!
- Sully!

221
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:07,619
I'm so sorry for
leaving you here

222
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,994
Sully---

223
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,291
I won't let go

224
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:22,395
Every two weeks, I'll be
wating at the Ohwa in Sohung

225
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,775
On a crescent moon,
go wait at the Uksu

226
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:34,746
When the lunar eclipse starts,
come to the Rose garden

227
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,021
Please form a line here
Everyone gets one each

228
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,418
On a half moon, Fang-gum,
on a solar eclipse, Dong-nam

229
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:47,763
For Halloween, Yong-goong,
and for Thanksgiving, Song-pyun

230
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,726
For New Year's---
For New Year's, come on home

231
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:58,868
Jin-ha! You should've
known that this is the real me

232
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:30,507
What's with the rain all of a sudden?
It's impossible to catch a cab

233
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,439
- How are we go to get home?
- Good point

234
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,248
- You want to just run?
- Fuck that

235
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,280
Are you go to pay for
my laundry? Sang-mi,

236
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,349
I'll catch a cab for you

237
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,588
Oh my god

238
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,321
- Think he'll be okay?
- Gabdu?

239
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,092
Yeah I wouldn't worry

240
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,136
Do you remember the
first day we met?

241
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,169
It rained just like today

242
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,844
- Yeah---it's already been a year
- True

243
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:20,875
I'm ok, please keep
your seat sir

244
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,351
Damn, What the fuck

245
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,829
Honey!

246
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,501
Honey!

247
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,365
It's not me
this lady over here---

248
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,377
- I don't know her
- What's wrong baby?

249
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,275
Get your hands off---
Come on---hands off

250
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,439
- Come on---hands off

251
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,817

- Darling--- Darling!

253
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,897
You know I'm really not her
honey or anything

254
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,959
It's okay--- she's just
sort of out there

255
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,293
- Off! Off of me you---
- Honey!

256
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,870

258
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,606

hands off of me please

259
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,786
Please--- off of me------------

260
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:45,287
leaders, Chairman Kim's visit
to Seoul has been confirmed

261
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,024
The schedule visit---
will focus on dialogue involving

262
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:54,330
a united team at the 2002 Worldcup
to be held in Korea and Japan

263
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,374
They'll arrange the event so that
the Japanese emperor could attend

264
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:04,511
The emperor will apologize
to the Koreans---

265
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,617
Stupid fucks
We're at war!

266
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,756
Great Japan Forever!

267
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:26,938
The soldiers have worked day
and night trying to secure---

268
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:31,201
the Japanese honor
However,

269
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:35,742
the corrupt and scandalous
Emperor has pledged---

270
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:41,408
to apologize to the Koreans

271
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:47,257

will not compromise and fight

Fuck the joint Worldcup!

275
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,977
Shouldn't we call captain first?

276
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:51,915
I worked for this---but it's obvious
that some didn't have to

277
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:56,650
Just suck it up

278
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,958
Now we speak Korean

279
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,040
There! There she is!
Shoot her! Come on! Shoot her!

280
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,174

282
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:55,649

283
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,006

284
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,608
It's me dog

285
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,238

- What's up my friend?

286
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,815
- What's up dog?
- What's up my friend?

287
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,815
Roll down the window

288
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,780
Hey friend!
You want to go for a few drinks?

289
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,621
Why the hell not?
What about the customers though?

290
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,557
Friends don't wait man

291
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,165
- Okay, right on
- Hey Mr.

292
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,702
Let's hurry up here

293
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:48,265
Who are these guys?

294
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,473
- Throw these guys out
- Yes, sir

295
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,117
PPX?

296
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,385
Conspiracy fund?

297
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:20,663
You stupid fuck

298
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,367
Yes, we have the PPX

299
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:31,838
But---there's a slight problem
with the fund here, sir---

300
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:36,776
I mean--- the cab drivers
here are sort of rough

301
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,523
Hello? Hello?

302
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,434
Why are the million men patriots
trying to attack the gas station?

303
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,310
To come up with
the conspiracy fund

304
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:12,388
- Give me the money!
- I don’t have any money

305
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,655
Just give me what you got

306
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,918
Takeshima is online

307
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:33,333
Long time no see

308
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,919
Good seeing you
My family is---

309
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:53,392
Everybody's okay?

310
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,860
I miss them

311
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,700
You got---

312
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,245
What?

313
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,279
Come on--- what?

314
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:16,852
You got really pretty

315
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,818
- They did a good job
- What do you want?

316
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,718
What are you trying to say?
Stop mumbling

317
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,527
You didn't practice
typing, did you?

318
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:27,855
Stupid---

319
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,796
Hey Hanako!

320
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,365
Next one's sort of long
Watch before you leave

321
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:48,275
Emergency situation!
Totally bankrupt!

322
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:56,587
Help needed!
Mone---

323
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:02,260
Why are you doing this?
What do you want me to do?

324
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,858
- Lend me some money
- I don't have any money

325
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,968
I spent it all on my surgery

326
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,438
come on--- lend me just a little---
The guys are starving

327
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,842
Did you at least bring the PPX?
Don't tell me you forgot

328
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,273
That's been taken care of
Just do as planned

329
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,485
Can you give me some more?

330
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,588
Do whatever you want then
And next time, just call me

331
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,622
Don't ever page
me to the PC cafe

332
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,585
You can't even type

333
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,668
- Who's this?
- Anyone order beef LoMein?

334
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,640
Do you have to
order so damn late?

335
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:56,344
Jesus fucking Christ

336
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,188
What do you think we are?
Seven fucking eleven?

337
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:04,289
You always have to
order when I'm sleeping

338
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,860
Shit Forgot General Tso's

339
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,125
Whatever---
that comes to ten bucks

340
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,750
Man, the food's not sitting well
I think it's because we've been

341
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,890
eating shit food all day

342
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:44,357
If you're go to work,
you need to eat well

343
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,363
If you ain't go to eat that pickle
and onion, let me get that

344
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:53,071
Speak Korean you fuck

345
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,008
Sorry

346
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,774
Chopsticks

347
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:05,783
Great Japan forever!

348
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,850
Can I get those
chopsticks please

349
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,697
I have a question, sir

350
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:23,098
Why do they say chopsticks when
when you barely do any chopping?

351
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:29,837
That's true---

352
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:34,848
Just like you don't drum

353
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,947
anything with drumsticks

354
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,222
Tough question---

355
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,089
This is why I never
liked English classes

356
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:10,843
boys are struggling
living on chinese and all---

357
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,590
But if we complete this mission,

358
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,420
we're talking
some serious dough

359
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,797
Alright boys,
number crunching time

360
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,234
Today, I would like to talk

361
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,909
about the 'Hungry Spirit'

362
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:40,148
HUN---Uhhh---

363
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:45,052
That's right
It means you're fucking starving

364
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,553
That LoMein you boys just had---

365
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,456
That's actually symbolic of
the Korean 'Hungry Spirit'

366
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:56,123
Of course there are others
like Wonton soup

367
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:57,959
Listen!

368
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:02,668
Why all the Korean actresses
are on a roll these days?

369
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,840
It's all about the 'Hungry Spirit'
Hungry---

370
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,207
What' s that chick' s name---
Choi (Beep), right?

371
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,005
They call her wonton soup

372
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,950
That girl worked her ass off
since she was little

373
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,454
She practically lived on
wonton soup all her life

374
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,050
And mommy, mommy!

375
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,590
- I won the Oscar
- Good for you

376
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,727
But now that she' s successful

377
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,498
she married that baseball player
Cho (Beep) from Junichi Dragons

378
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,298
I heard she's pretty happy

379
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,600
And still keeps her tits perky

380
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,039
It' s not Junichi,
it' s Yomiuri Giants, sir

381
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,784
Listen!

382
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,949
Listen to me fuckheads

383
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,057
From now on,
you' re all fucking

384
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:08,130
dead if you talk back to me

385
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,564
Get the hell out now

386
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,535
Except for you boy

387
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:25,482
Just stay still assneck

388
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,754
Hey, fuckface

389
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,393
Koo' s Yomiuri
you fucking moron

390
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,425
Koo' s Yomiuri
you fucking moron

391
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,799
Last month,
there was an incident---

392
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:21,374
involving a theft
of PPX liquid gas

393
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,068
That's a great terrible

394
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,608
At the same time,

395
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,713
there was an intel that said---
The Million Men Patriots have

396
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:30,183
successfully moved into Seoul

397
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,184
I'm definitely smelling
something here

398
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,724
In about an hour,
the Japanese

399
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,657
will send over
Detective Watanabe

400
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,866
I believe that the detective
will brief us on the details

401
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,325
And by the way,
one of you---

402
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:48,767
was ordered to go greet
the detective at the airport

403
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:54,173
Hey Gabdu,
Why don't you go?

404
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,705
What?

405
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,365
Welcome, Watanabe

406
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,274
Are you Detective Watanabe?

407
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,474
Umm---

408
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:38,284
I didn't know that they'd
send a lady to greet me

409
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:42,119
I'm the only one that
speaks Japanese

410
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,863
Let's go!

411
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,339
Did they catch Hanako?

412
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,478
They're still investigating

413
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:10,278
It's going to be quite
challenging actually

414
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,422
Just watch

415
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,153
I will find that ugly chick
And when she's mine---

416
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,259
She's dead meat

417
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:50,850
You knew from the
beginning at the airport

418
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,995
Do you want to touch me?

419
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,133
What are you talking about?

420
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:05,036
Man---this popularity thing---

421
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,935
Everybody wants
a piece of me

422
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,581
I want---

423
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,153
to spank you!

424
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,653
What do you want?

425
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,464
Anywhere you want

426
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,236
Get up! Now make
an isosceles triangle!

427
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,505
Isosceles triangle!

428
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,705
This is a fucking rectangle!

429
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:45,608
I said a triangle
Oh yeah?

430
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,117
Let's go!

431
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,878
Does that hurt?

432
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,021
Well---I'm okay I guess

433
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,818
This one's going to hurt a bit

434
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,308
How about that?
Better than you thought, huh?

435
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,538
Yes, I like it

436
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,717
Wish I could do more---

437
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,944
but it's my turn now

438
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:26,416
Hurry up now

439
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,556
Hurry up!
Make me go crazy!

440
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,000
That's not how it's done!

441
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,011
Much harder!
Harder, and harder

442
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,513
Oh, baby!

443
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,617
Spank me hard baby

444
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:22,645
I love it baby---

445
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,313
Now slow down a bit

446
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,508
No way---

447
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,913
I'm starting to like it

448
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,535
Oh baby, l---

449
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,600
Any leads?

450
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,564
His buttocks have been bruised
and anus heavily damaged---

451
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:26,402
But I think it was
poison that did the job

452
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,729
I think this is one of
the AT poison needles

453
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:11,310
This is definitely AT60
The Japs use these though

454
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:17,322
- Oh yeah---did you have lunch?
- No, did you want to eat?

455
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,459
Maybe some Kimchi soup?
How about some spaghetti?

456
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,888
- Maybe some curry?
- Sure, why not?

457
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,935
We were the only three to know
that Watanabe was coming

458
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,232
That means---

459
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:34,911
One of us had to have leaked---
it certainly wasn't me

460
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,578
Was it you?
You?

461
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,248
Let's really focus on
confidentiality this time

462
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:44,886
We really need to
tighten up the security

463
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,015
I think he knew
God He might be the one

464
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,654
Maybe---

465
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:55,430
Follow me!

466
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,567
I think we know who it is

467
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,957
This man here is another
high profile member of the MMP

468
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,062
He's an extreme rightist
Murakami Hideo

469
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:32,026
He was a former navy officer
And later joined the MMP

470
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:36,935
This guy was responsible for
a number of terrorist acts

471
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:42,306
Hold on--- Didn't Mr. Yoo
serve in the Coast guards?

472
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:19,444
Hey!

473
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,384
Watch your shadow

474
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,258
- Who are you?
- It's me Gabdu
