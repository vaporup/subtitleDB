1
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:42,468
<i>The Pilgrim's Progress.
From this World to That Which is to Come,</i>

2
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,214
<i>Delivered Under the Similitude of a Dream.</i>

3
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:52,387
<i>Wherein is Discovered,
The Manner of His Setting Out,</i>

4
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,680
<i>His Dangerous Journey</i>

5
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,560
<i>And Safe Arrival at the Desired Country.</i>

6
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,412
<i>As I walked through
the wilderness of this world,</i>

7
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,954
<i>I lighted on a certain place
where was a den</i>

8
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,787
<i>and I laid me down in that place to sleep.</i>

9
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:04,208
<i>And as I slept, I dreamed a dream.</i>

10
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,429
<i>I saw a man clothed with rags,</i>

11
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:14,389
<i>standing in a certain place with
his face from his own house</i>

12
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,852
<i>book in his hand,
and a great burden upon his back.</i>

13
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,862
<i>All those years...</i>

14
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,940
<i>living the life of someone...</i>

15
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,239
<i>I didn't even know.</i>

16
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,690
<i>Remember the story
I used to tell you when you were a boy...</i>

17
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,113
<i>about a young prince.</i>

18
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,696
<i>A knight,</i>

19
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,286
<i>sent by his father, the King of the East,</i>

20
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,161
<i>west into Egypt...</i>

21
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,125
<i>to find a pearl.</i>

22
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,014
<i>A pearl from the depths of the sea.</i>

23
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,568
<i>But when the prince arrived,</i>

24
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,075
<i>the people poured him a cup
that took away his memory.</i>

25
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,200
<i>He forgot he was the son of the king.</i>

26
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,455
<i>Forgot about the pearl...</i>

27
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,384
<i>and fell into a deep sleep.</i>

28
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,780
<i>The king didn't forget his son.</i>

29
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,370
<i>He continued to send word...</i>

30
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,418
<i>messengers...</i>

31
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,634
<i>guides.</i>

32
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,603
<i>But the prince... slept on.</i>

33
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,034
<i>You see the palm trees?</i>

34
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,405
<i>They tell you anything's possible.</i>

35
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,621
<i>You can be anything...</i>

36
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,250
<i>do anything...</i>

37
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,129
<i>start over.</i>

38
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,551
<i>You know?</i>

39
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,062
I'm asking for your permission to make this

40
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,269
a dramatic scene for one second...

41
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,794
<i>My son...</i>

42
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,596
<i>you are just like I am.</i>

43
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,524
<i>Can't figure your life out?</i>

44
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,990
<i>Can't put the pieces together?</i>

45
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,406
<i>Just like me.</i>

46
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,083
<i>A pilgrim on this earth.</i>

47
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,926
<i>A stranger.</i>

48
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,947
<i>Fragments...</i>

49
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,706
<i>pieces...</i>

50
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,543
<i>of a man.</i>

51
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,724
<i>Where did I go wrong?</i>

52
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,390
<i>What you wanna talk about?</i>

53
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,316
You have nice eyes.

54
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,355
Aren't I lucky.

55
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,654
Where do you live?

56
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,359
Why do ya wanna know?

57
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,492
I want to write you a letter.

58
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,416
What are you gonna say in your letter?

59
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,665
Maybe you better not say it.

60
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,962
<i>Let's live
like nobody's ever done it before.</i>

61
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,594
<i>Wicked.</i>

62
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,010
<i>Once the soul
was perfect and had wings...</i>

63
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,519
<i>Brave.</i>

64
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:29,060
<i>...it could soar into heaven
where only creatures with wings can be.</i>

65
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:33,067
<i>But the soul lost its wings
and fell to Earth.</i>

66
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,323
<i>There it took an earthly body.</i>

67
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,367
<i>And now, while it lives in this body,</i>

68
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,700
<i>no outward sign of wings can be seen.</i>

69
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,995
<i>Yet the roots of its wings are still there.</i>

70
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,833
<i>And the nature of wings is to try to raise
the earthbound body</i>

71
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,747
<i>and soar with it into heaven.</i>

72
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:55,919
<i>When we see a beautiful woman, or a man...</i>

73
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:01,804
<i>the soul remembers the beauty
it used to know in heaven.</i>

74
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:07,647
<i>And wings begin to spout,
and that makes the soul want to fly,</i>

75
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,433
<i>but it cannot yet.
It is still too weak.</i>

76
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,481
<i>So the man keeps staring up
into the sky like a young bird.</i>

77
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,195
<i>He has lost
all interest in the world...</i>

78
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:23,822
<i>- Can I come over?
- We just left each other.</i>

79
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,706
<i>Are you alone?</i>

80
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,997
<i>Of course.</i>

81
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,712
On my phone sheet, I got agent
writers up my ass trying to get this job.

82
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:39,095
<i>I just want to sit next to you.</i>

83
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,342
Teddy thinks
you're the guy for this.

84
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,770
That means the assignment
you didn't turn in, right,

85
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,274
you don't have to worry about it.
Here's what happens. That goes away.

86
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,271
<i>- What are you wearing?
- A dress.</i>

87
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,190
- <i>What's it made of?
- How should I know?</i>

88
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,947
<i>Cotton, I guess.</i>

89
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,989
We said there's no way
you're gonna do it.

90
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,749
So what'd we do? Said, double your quote.
And he did it.

91
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,917
And that, Chuck signed off of that.
Teddy gets who he wants.

92
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,173
The biggest comedy star wants you.

93
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,757
Five years ago you came to me and
wanted to write big movies in Hollywood.

94
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,216
- I mean...
- Okay, I don't want to see.

95
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:28,558
Moments like this
don't come along, okay? This is it.

96
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,822
<i>I see how you look at me.</i>

97
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,622
<i>You think I could make you crazy?</i>

98
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,670
<i>Crack you out of your shell?</i>

99
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,967
<i>Make you suffer?</i>

100
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:33,202
I... think... you're... weak.

101
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,217
<i>You don't want love.</i>

102
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,935
<i>You want a love experience.</i>

103
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,283
Am I bringing you back to life?

104
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,796
<i>Love and do what you like.</i>

105
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,180
<i>A saint said that.</i>

106
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,810
<i>Desire so deep.</i>

107
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,697
<i>I'll throw my life away.</i>

108
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,569
<i>Don't go back to being dead.</i>

109
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,127
<i>What do you want?</i>

110
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,113
We're not leading the lives
that we are meant for.

111
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,744
We're meant for something else.

112
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,224
My brother will translate.

113
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,236
He looks around.

114
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,412
He walks near the edge of the cliff.

115
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,727
She says, like shadows.

116
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,783
<i>Where will I meet you?</i>

117
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,684
<i>Which way should I go?</i>

118
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,855
<i>Suppose it isn't there for me,</i>

119
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,279
<i>in the end?</i>

120
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,639
<i>How do I begin?</i>

121
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,574
<i>Remember how you showed up?</i>

122
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,239
<i>Your wrists were taped up
like a tennis player's.</i>

123
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,539
<i>You walked around
like nothing had happened.</i>

124
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,298
<i>You were always doing it,
pretending everything was okay.</i>

125
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,714
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

126
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,904
- That's my brother, Rick.
- How are ya?

127
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,282
What's goin' on, now? Anything.
Same today?

128
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:25,367
Don't know how many times
I thought I'd die right here on the street.

129
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:30,585
I picked him up and I had him
in my car, and a cop pulled us over.

130
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:36,128
I tell him, "I'm a Methodist minister
and I'm looking after you, alright?"

131
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,837
And I got off.

132
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:13,460
<i>I dreamed that we were caught in
a huge tidal wave that engulfed the city.</i>

133
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,168
<i>Any moment it seemed like
we might be swept under.</i>

134
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,674
<i>There was a door
that I was afraid to go through.</i>

135
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,973
<i>- I touched the knob...
- If I stuck you with a fork.</i>

136
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,773
<i>Just wanna feel somethin', man.</i>

137
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,319
<i>Wish we could do some things.</i>

138
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,703
<i>Like goin' out on the Snake River together.
Remember?</i>

139
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,579
<i>Think I'd end up here.</i>

140
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,458
<i>Gracias.</i>

141
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,765
It's good of you to invite me out here.

142
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,678
Show me what it's like
to live a normal life.

143
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,318
Somethin' wrong?

144
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,119
What's up?

145
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:37,412
I can tell when somethin's wrong, man.
I know you.

146
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,683
What do you wanna talk about?

147
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,524
I'm the only brother you got left.
You can tell me.

148
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,946
I tell you stuff.

149
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,912
<i>I loved my brother then.</i>

150
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,245
<i>I hated him, too.</i>

151
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,956
<i>For destroying everything
I'd been trying to do.</i>

152
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,334
<i>To build us back up after Billy died.</i>

153
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:34,223
I remember when they were putting Billy
in the ground, Dad went into hysterics.

154
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,308
"My son!"

155
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,560
Who fucking does that?

156
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,194
<i>They said he took his life.</i>

157
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,443
<i>But they don't know.</i>

158
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,912
Oh, right now. Come on.

159
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,204
I gotta feel something.

160
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,955
<i>Like a snake.</i>

161
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,461
<i>Swallowed him.</i>

162
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,172
Come on, feel it.

163
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,682
<i>Blind.</i>

164
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,062
<i>Deaf.</i>

165
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,325
<i>Grasping.</i>

166
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,833
<i>I just wanted to twist a cane.</i>

167
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,748
<i>Strike out, break free.</i>

168
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,293
<i>Didn't have the guts.</i>

169
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,976
<i>He's just an old fool.</i>

170
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,813
<i>Just let him die with his blinders on.</i>

171
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,134
<i>Redeem my life.</i>

172
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,052
<i>Justify it.</i>

173
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:42,393
<i>Ah, look at the fierce one.
The fierceness in his eyes. The rage!</i>

174
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,852
...inflicted upon myself...

175
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,272
<i>Oh Billy.</i>

176
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,068
<i>I died.</i>

177
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,614
<i>In a different way.</i>

178
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,748
<i>I know you don't love me.</i>

179
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,926
<i>I know things.</i>

180
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,089
<i>- Say it.
- Serious information.</i>

181
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,348
<i>I've blinded you.</i>

182
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,309
<i>My life has...</i>

183
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,726
I did every lousy, crappy job
that they wanted me to do.

184
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:33,068
<i>But because I stumbled down
the road like a drunk...</i>

185
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,660
<i>that doesn't mean it's the wrong one.</i>

186
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,096
<i>I turned you upside down.</i>

187
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,558
<i>My son.</i>

188
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,699
<i>The light's gone out of your eyes.</i>

189
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,240
<i>Womanizer.</i>

190
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,372
<i>Cut off.</i>

191
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,505
<i>Life.</i>

192
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,599
<i>A goddess.</i>

193
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,172
Angela...

194
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,344
Frita...

195
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:52,138
<i>Music is very important.
Helps me to fall in love.</i>

196
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,731
<i>I fall in love 20 times a day.</i>

197
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,815
Your face was very familiar to me, but I
didn't know from where. You're fantastic.

198
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,149
Thank you.

199
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:05,534
Listening to music on headsets, unaware you
are staring at them like a dirty ol' man.

200
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,699
<i>Myself, I didn't wanna get a divorce.</i>

201
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:13,208
I never stopped loving them.
But the way I loved them changed.

202
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,494
<i>They are like flavors.</i>

203
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,712
<i>Sometimes you want raspberry, then
after a while you want some strawberry.</i>

204
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,878
- It's Abrasive.
- Oh, you are such a governor.

205
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,935
- What's your name?
- Helen.

206
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:36,769
What's your name?

207
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,479
Rick.

208
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,318
Do you know anybody here?

209
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,063
No. Does that surprise you?

210
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,369
- I know a guy.
- I know a guy...

211
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:58,579
- ...like future space.
- You're at a party, it's alright.

212
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,809
You know who'd be hot?
Cleopatra.

213
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,775
If her nose had been this much shorter,

214
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,031
it would've changed the world.

215
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,715
<i>The Pearl.</i>

216
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,263
<i>Somewhere in the sea.</i>

217
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,895
<i>A chaos.</i>

218
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,444
<i>Hungry.</i>

219
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,612
<i>Longing for something other...</i>

220
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,667
<i>without knowing what it is.</i>

221
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,926
What about pink?
Do you like pink?

222
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:39,973
- I love the company of women.
- It's pretty. Did it take long?

223
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,108
<i>It seemed they knew something.</i>

224
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,189
Some men don't like pink.

225
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:49,778
- <i>But closer.</i>
- Now you tell me something.

226
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,743
<i>To the mystery.</i>

227
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,624
<i>Treat this world as it deserves.</i>

228
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,886
<i>There are no principles...</i>

229
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,843
<i>just circumstances.</i>

230
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,769
<i>Nobody's home.</i>

231
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,436
<i>Smoke machines in an empty sea.</i>

232
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,195
<i>I got women in Tennessee.</i>

233
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:33,655
<i>What can run but never walk,
some word have I found but never talk.</i>

234
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,869
<i>Gonna take me out to see...</i>

235
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,468
<i>Get up.</i>

236
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,610
<i>Find it.</i>

237
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:16,410
<i>There's a ketamine party we're having
next week. Have you ever heard of that?</i>

238
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:22,124
<i>You're here for 20 seconds and then,
wham, you're out. You're in another room.</i>

239
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,832
Your wife. You're in another one.
You oughtta do that.

240
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:29,715
Have you been to Sarajevo?
I have prayed, man,

241
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:35,801
for God to take my arm, take both arms.
I felt so useless.

242
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,714
What's your name?

243
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,217
<i>Dear friend.</i>

244
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,848
<i>I wonder where
I was in all that time.</i>

245
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,681
<i>A sleepwalker.</i>

246
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,819
<i>In love with the world,
in love with love.</i>

247
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,951
<i>The world's a swamp.</i>

248
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,246
<i>You have to fly over it.</i>

249
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,628
<i>Fly...</i>

250
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,004
<i>High up...</i>

251
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,885
<i>where everything is just...</i>

252
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,720
<i>a speck.</i>

253
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,664
<i>You changed.</i>

254
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,342
<i>The world absorbed you.</i>

255
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,054
<i>More and more.</i>

256
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,029
<i>I regret that it turned out the way it did.</i>

257
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,946
<i>You always wanted to get away.
I wanted a mate.</i>

258
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,906
<i>I couldn't have you.</i>

259
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,583
<i>Just didn't wanna be alone.</i>

260
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,976
Are you sorry that you brought me here?

261
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,732
Are you sorry you came?

262
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:45,197
Do you remember how happy we were?
Different these days.

263
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,368
What's going on with you?

264
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:56,497
You used to sing in the morning
coming down the stairs.

265
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,752
I meant to make you happy.
I wanted nothing else.

266
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,672
But then you began to be angry with me...

267
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,641
just for little things.

268
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:16,524
<i>I don't wanna accuse you,
but you turned more unkind toward me.</i>

269
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,441
<i>Almost cruel.</i>

270
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,537
Just don't threaten me with leaving, okay?

271
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,376
Just do what you wanna do!

272
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,759
Just go!

273
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,407
<i>Stay.</i>

274
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,789
<i>I want you.</i>

275
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,753
<i>Hold you.</i>

276
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,509
<i>Have you.
Mine.</i>

277
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:32,342
<i>Are you sorry
we didn't have babies?</i>

278
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,351
<i>I am.</i>

279
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,194
<i>Got started so late.</i>

280
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:27,030
<i>You wanted me to help you
through the dangers of a young man's life.</i>

281
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,402
<i>Ambition.</i>

282
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,781
<i>Fear.</i>

283
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,660
When was the last time
you took these boots off?

284
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:50,007
<i>I think you were afraid
of going astray.</i>

285
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,513
<i>I couldn't help you stay on the right path.</i>

286
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,359
<i>Your head was turned
in the wrong direction.</i>

287
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,524
Can you move all your fingers?

288
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,365
Yeah, they look a little bit bruised.

289
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:37,350
<i>You never really wanted
to be totally inside our marriage.</i>

290
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,189
<i>Nor outside it, either.</i>

291
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:53,237
<i>You were sincere in the promises you made.</i>

292
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:05,246
<i>Still... they didn't come from your heart.</i>

293
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,075
<i>I was afraid when I was young.</i>

294
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,253
<i>Afraid of life.</i>

295
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,758
<i>Who pays for it.</i>

296
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,726
<i>I'm sorry you had to pay as well.</i>

297
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,825
<i>My hope.</i>

298
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,227
<i>You gave me peace.</i>

299
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,903
<i>You gave me what the world can't give.</i>

300
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,611
<i>Mercy.</i>

301
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,030
<i>Love.</i>

302
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,493
<i>Joy.</i>

303
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,206
<i>All else is cloud.</i>

304
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,794
<i>Mist.</i>

305
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,551
<i>Be with me.</i>

306
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,931
<i>Always.</i>

307
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,437
<i>You're still the love of my life.</i>

308
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,984
<i>Should I tell you that?</i>

309
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,691
Drinking is bad.
But feelings are worse.

310
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:07,533
Sober girls are the worst,
but so are really drunk ones.

311
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,748
The sweet spot is one xanie,
four white wines.

312
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:21,839
<i>If you're not first in line,
you're smelling somebody else's brown eye.</i>

313
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,548
<i>Balls deep.</i>

314
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:29,009
Living my life is like
playing Call of Duty on easy.

315
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:31,143
I just go around and fuck shit up.

316
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:34,272
<i>Why don't we take
"yes" for an answer.</i>

317
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:41,446
Let me tell you about you.

318
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,489
You worked long and hard
to get to this moment.

319
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,783
Mountain air.

320
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,204
Freedom.
What are you gonna do?

321
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,210
Crawl back down because
you don't like the altitude?

322
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,669
You have an incomparable opportunity.

323
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,839
I told you about you.

324
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,509
Now let me tell you about me.

325
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,057
I wanna make you rich.

326
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:19,935
Is there anyone you wanna sit
in a room with?

327
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:25,323
<i>Is there anyone you wanna know?
You wanna climb your stairs, or theirs?</i>

328
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,697
<i>Never get your shot.</i>

329
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,661
<i>Your time on Earth.</i>

330
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,798
<i>All you need to do is say yes.</i>

331
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,301
<i>Nod.</i>

332
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,970
<i>Wink.</i>

333
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,730
<i>Where else will you go?</i>

334
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,854
<i>It'll be the same there.</i>

335
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,824
<i>Don't get your head
too far up your own ass.</i>

336
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:20,328
<i>Once people envied
and respected me.</i>

337
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,041
They called me in.

338
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,544
Give me your ID's.

339
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:28,549
Give me your...
give me your pass to open the doors.

340
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,258
They have a checklist.

341
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:37,812
They didn't count the pros
and cons...

342
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,810
I gave my life up for you kids.

343
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:49,858
It wasn't a noble sacrifice.
It was what we were supposed to do.

344
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,118
It was the way I was raised.

345
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,635
Try starving once! I've tried it.
I've done it!

346
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:15,174
Now it's all over. Now it's leaving me.
Now it's going away from me.

347
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:21,390
<i>You think when you reach a
certain age things will start making sense.</i>

348
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:28,108
<i>Then you find out you're
just as lost as you were before.</i>

349
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,657
<i>I suppose that's what damnation is.</i>

350
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:44,333
<i>The pieces of your life
never to come together.</i>

351
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,009
<i>Just splashed out there.</i>

352
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:09,320
<i>His goods are in peace. But when
a stronger than he shall come upon you...</i>

353
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,197
<i>This was a vision,</i>

354
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,364
<i>nice and
clear as a mountain stream.</i>

355
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,872
<i>The mind revealing itself to itself.</i>

356
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:29,124
<i>In my vision
I was on the verandah of a vast estate,</i>

357
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,634
<i>a palazzo of some fantastic proportion.</i>

358
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:45,019
<i>There seemed to emanate from it a light
from within this gleaming, radiant marble.</i>

359
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,454
That's good, that's good.

360
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,035
Tuck.
Relax your mouth.

361
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,501
Who is responsible for this clothing?
Who is it?

362
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,588
- Can you step out of the wind?
- Stop smiling.

363
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:17,012
And don't move too fast.

364
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:23,052
They didn't take eighty.
Doesn't matter.

365
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:25,433
<i>I had a dream.</i>

366
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,811
Don't stare at me like this.

367
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,644
<i>I met a woman from another world.</i>

368
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,815
<i>I was taken up above the earth.</i>

369
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,782
<i>I shook with fear.</i>

370
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,329
<i>Wonder.</i>

371
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,799
Lean into her.
Put your breasts against her back.

372
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,632
Don't look sweet. Don't look scared.
You like this, Helen.

373
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,092
<i>Who are you?</i>

374
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:06,805
Look into the camera. Fucking make
it hard. You're a dirty, fucking bitch.

375
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:12,318
Work those muscles. You're a 1975 housewife
who takes steroids and fucks girls.

376
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,399
<i>I travel.</i>

377
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,278
<i>A wanderer.</i>

378
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,157
<i>A stranger.</i>

379
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,082
<i>Like you.</i>

380
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,504
Stop, take your hands off your hip.

381
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,213
Hit her hard, pop.

382
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:43,425
<i>I keep thinking
I can make a new start.</i>

383
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,718
Helen?
Two weeks.

384
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,197
Can you swim?

385
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,731
<i>Higher.</i>

386
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:05,635
Is this a friendship we have?

387
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:19,479
I don't wanna wreak havoc
in men's lives anymore.

388
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,461
<i>Oh... life.</i>

389
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,805
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

390
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,026
<i>To weave a spell over you?</i>

391
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:54,118
<i>To make you dream?</i>

392
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,590
<i>Dreams are nice.</i>

393
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,005
<i>But you can't live in them.</i>

394
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:54,887
<i>There's somewhere else
we need to get to.</i>

395
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:00,601
<i>I know it.</i>

396
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,002
<i>It comes to me now.</i>

397
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,125
How tenderly you touched my face...

398
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,719
<i>when you were four years old.</i>

399
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,226
<i>And I'd bounce you on my knee.</i>

400
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,532
<i>So much I was given.</i>

401
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,621
<i>So much I left behind.</i>

402
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,591
<i>Remember.</i>

403
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:00,554
<i>The pearl.</i>

404
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,561
<i>Whispering.</i>

405
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:11,482
<i>Beckoning.</i>

406
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,613
<i>Each man,</i>

407
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,740
<i>each woman.</i>

408
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,371
<i>A guide.</i>

409
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:28,791
<i>A God.</i>

410
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:34,676
...except I got better
math and science scores...

411
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,049
<i>You live in exile.</i>

412
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:45,478
<i>Stranger in a strange land.</i>

413
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,076
<i>A Pilgrim,</i>

414
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:07,955
<i>A knight.</i>

415
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,469
<i>Find your way...</i>

416
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,641
<i>from darkness...</i>

417
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,019
<i>to light.</i>

418
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,497
<i>You wanna give him a high-five?</i>

419
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:58,756
Thank you.

420
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:03,890
- How long will you be here?
- A week, Sara's got folks here.

421
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,473
Have you been out here before?

422
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:13,976
<i>You told me
that sometimes you felt like a spy.</i>

423
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,281
<i>Always had to pretend.</i>

424
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,789
<i>You were afraid.</i>

425
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:58,570
<i>You would hide behind
the rocking chair before he came home</i>

426
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,401
<i>and you'd get real stiff.</i>

427
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:06,866
<i>I hope you have children.</i>

428
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:16,255
<i>You're always wondering, are they too cold,
are they warm enough?</i>

429
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:20,046
<i>Instead of worrying about yourselves.</i>

430
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:36,392
- Don't fucking move.
- Check him for his wallet.

431
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,105
Come on.

432
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:43,111
Got 20, 40, 60.
Couple hundred.

433
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,820
Take the TV?
You can't tow that down the street.

434
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:52,241
How come you ain't got nothin'
in this house, man!

435
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:02,543
- Keep looking.
- What kind of jacket is that? Take it off.

436
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,212
Take it off. Whoa, careful.

437
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,722
<i>I've spent 30 years.</i>

438
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:52,721
<i>Not living life.</i>

439
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:55,804
<i>But ruining it.</i>

440
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:59,683
<i>For myself. And others.</i>

441
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:05,776
<i>I can't remember...</i>

442
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,947
<i>A man I wanted to be.</i>

443
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,183
<i>What mood am I in?</i>

444
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,978
<i>Tell me...</i>

445
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,526
<i>What do I think of you?</i>

446
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,907
<i>No one cares about reality anymore.</i>

447
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,067
<i>What's your story?</i>

448
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,695
<i>What's yours?</i>

449
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,778
<i>I'm an Aussie.</i>

450
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,823
<i>Australian.</i>

451
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:39,081
<i>Yeah.
You've been there, down under?</i>

452
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,038
What's your name?

453
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,376
What's your name?

454
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,838
Whatever you want it to be.
You pick.

455
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:01,472
You have a darkness on you.

456
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,725
A little shadow.

457
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:34,341
You live in a little fantasy world,
don't you?

458
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:36,760
Don't you?

459
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,642
Yes. Because it's so much more fun.

460
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:41,765
Do you enjoy yours?

461
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:47,276
Uh-huh. Changes every day.
I can be whatever I want to be.

462
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:53,566
Don't forget that.
You can be whoever you want to be.

463
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,701
You can be an asshole.

464
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:07,079
You can be a saint,
you can be a... you can be a God.

465
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:11,424
I'll tell you,
but don't tell anyone, it's a secret.

466
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,560
<i>We're like clouds, aren't we?</i>

467
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:28,187
<i>Coming and going.</i>

468
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,783
<i>There's no such thing as forever.</i>

469
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:47,377
<i>The highs don't add up.</i>

470
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,675
You liked that, didn't you?

471
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:06,850
<i>Free.</i>

472
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,940
<i>Wake up.</i>

473
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:51,687
Love danger.
Like living on the edge like this.

474
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:54,568
It's crazy, it's scary.
What if I get busted?

475
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:58,732
Look at you with your little
eyes looking at me.

476
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:03,199
Sometimes I think I know so much more
about the world than other people.

477
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:09,619
You see, I took drugs once, and it kind of
opened up this window for me.

478
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:11,707
I call it the Window of Truth.

479
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:14,042
<i>Real life's so hard to find.</i>

480
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:17,379
...I saw the world in a different way...

481
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:19,923
<i>Where is it?</i>

482
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:23,511
...I see things other people do not...

483
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:26,596
I think you had that experience, too.

484
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,306
<i>How do you get there?</i>

485
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:38,817
<i>Get out of the big cloud of dust
everybody's kicking up.</i>

486
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,246
<i>The only way out is in.</i>

487
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,710
<i>Breathe.</i>

488
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:05,097
<i>Your mind's a theater.</i>

489
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:12,684
<i>I say, try it all.</i>

490
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,443
<i>Why not?</i>

491
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,873
<i>Then I fell back asleep.</i>

492
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:33,663
<i>Sing for me.</i>

493
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:37,876
<i>Dream another dream.</i>

494
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:02,522
<i>...who laid the foundations of the earth,</i>

495
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,237
<i>that it should not be removed for ever.</i>

496
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:10,371
<i>The waters stood above the mountains.
At thy rebuke they fled,</i>

497
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:13,248
<i>at the voice of thy thunder
they hasted away.</i>

498
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:18,288
<i>They go down by the valleys unto the place
which thou hast founded for them.</i>

499
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,254
<i>He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle</i>

500
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:29,804
<i>and herb for the service of man that he may
bring forth food out of the earth...</i>

501
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:47,734
Very loving and enchanting.
Most affectionate.

502
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:49,948
Real nice to get along.

503
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:51,909
Very beautiful.

504
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:57,999
I like your outfit, too, especially the
boots. Now they're a touch of class.

505
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,504
Are you a religious man?

506
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:04,418
- You have a cross around your neck.
- Absolutely.

507
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:09,180
Oh, even though I'm in darkness,
I believe in the light.

508
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,469
I was instructed from some information

509
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,730
to be no part of the world
nor of the things in it.

510
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:22,359
But my eyes are now simple,
and I'm carnal when I see beautiful women

511
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:26,193
and big cars and lots of money,
and I wanna be a part of it.

512
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:34,997
I mean, who needs a bed
this big? Pretty good, huh?

513
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:36,703
Look at you,

514
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:41,588
hanging out there with your girls and your
money. Are you feeling happy?

515
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,498
- Yes.
- It makes you happy'?

516
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:48,545
- It depends who owns the money.
- It's my new fur. He bought it for me.

517
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,760
This man is in love with me.

518
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,640
Just some other girl.

519
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,346
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

520
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:12,660
<i>And the world held up a mirror.</i>

521
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:16,200
<i>Here.</i>

522
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,329
<i>Take the things you want.</i>

523
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,337
<i>They can be yours.</i>

524
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,395
<i>Why do you hold back?</i>

525
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:53,488
I thought you were dead.

526
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:57,952
- I can't believe I actually met Elvis.
- You never know in this town.

527
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:01,702
That's my move.
Do you think I'll be as famous as Elvis?

528
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,013
<i>What a fool am I?</i>

529
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:25,399
<i>Just to lie in a stinking dungeon.</i>

530
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:29,570
<i>When I may as well walk at liberty.</i>

531
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:34,826
<i>I have a key in my bosom called promise.</i>

532
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:38,662
<i>And will I am persuaded,</i>

533
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,374
<i>open any lock in Doubting Castle.</i>

534
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:46,670
<i>Though in this dark and dismal state,</i>

535
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:51,418
<i>he hath turned the shadow
of death into the morning,</i>

536
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:04,660
<i>Go.</i>

537
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:13,336
<i>Where?</i>

538
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,141
<i>Find it.</i>

539
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:49,372
<i>How do I reach you?</i>

540
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,631
<i>Find my way there?</i>

541
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,511
<i>Are you afraid?</i>

542
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:29,722
<i>Sweetheart, my love,</i>

543
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:33,640
<i>I don't feel guilty
that I've fallen in love with you.</i>

544
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:39,982
<i>I'm glad.</i>

545
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,611
<i>Grateful I still can.</i>

546
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:56,959
<i>You're afraid
you're making me break my vows.</i>

547
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,633
<i>But the vow comes out
of the love behind it.</i>

548
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,685
<i>Love's so rare that when you find it</i>

549
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,184
<i>you can't doubt it.</i>

550
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,480
<i>Let it go.</i>

551
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:52,473
<i>I remember when
I came down out of the mountains</i>

552
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:56,268
<i>and I was conditioned with
being absolutely clear.</i>

553
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:57,977
<i>Absolutely...</i>

554
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:02,528
<i>if not enlightened,
at least wiser than I had been.</i>

555
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:08,614
You have to kneel in a certain way and
you have to bow at the appropriate time.

556
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:13,451
And it's all beautifully timed,
even the sound of when they announce...

557
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:33,058
We walked 250 miles over the mountains,

558
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:35,561
into Tibet area.

559
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:40,353
And every... couple days,

560
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,063
every 20 miles or so,

561
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:46,818
you knew you were
going back in history, in time...

562
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,404
But don't forget
their life is so circumscribed.

563
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:59,168
If you're living in a cave eating nettles,
it's not so difficult to keep life simple.

564
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:05,508
You don't have honking horns and your wife
running in saying "You screwed up!"

565
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:11,173
The distractions are very few, and that's
the great attraction of the monk's life.

566
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:16,389
<i>Teaching now... I only teach one thing.</i>

567
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,643
<i>I just teach this moment.</i>

568
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:25,027
<i>Pay attention to this moment.</i>

569
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,572
<i>And everything is there...</i>

570
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,736
<i>perfect...</i>

571
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:37,785
<i>and complete.</i>

572
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:42,414
<i>Just as it is.</i>

573
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,323
<i>You're so quiet.</i>

574
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:16,703
<i>You keep everything to yourself.</i>

575
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:25,040
<i>You have love in you.</i>

576
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,586
<i>I know it.</i>

577
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:37,803
<i>When I'm with you...</i>

578
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,182
<i>I forget everything else.</i>

579
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:48,693
<i>My husband...</i>

580
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,358
<i>my life as I knew it.</i>

581
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:58,575
Thumb, first finger, third
finger, left, fourth finger, third finger,

582
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:05,837
<i>second finger, thumb, right hand, thumb,
first finger, second finger, thumb...</i>

583
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:09,668
<i>Have I found you?</i>

584
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:24,516
<i>Can it be?</i>

585
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:21,323
<i>Answer me.</i>

586
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:33,711
<i>So this is what we are.</i>

587
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:38,257
<i>A fire.</i>

588
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:09,038
<i>Come with me.</i>

589
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:20,591
<i>Away.</i>

590
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:18,982
Open your mouth.

591
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:43,637
<i>I wanna go away with you.</i>

592
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:57,646
<i>Marry you.</i>

593
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:45,532
<i>Save what you can of your life.</i>

594
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,239
<i>Look at me.</i>

595
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:56,414
<i>Dan't lose it all
just because you've lost a part.</i>

596
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:56,011
<i>I found out I was pregnant.</i>

597
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:02,650
<i>Nate came back.</i>

598
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:13,654
<i>And I wasn't sure if it was my husband's...</i>

599
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:20,205
<i>or if it was yours.</i>

600
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:39,183
<i>...to distract me right now</i>

601
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:41,598
<i>but I wanted to tel! you, to...</i>

602
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:45,443
acknowledge that it was...

603
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,902
I wake up and...

604
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:55,866
I forget about it
for a few minutes and then...

605
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:01,534
and then I remember.

606
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:14,139
She's like "I had four of them.
You have to get over it and stop crying."

607
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:47,877
<i>What are we now?</i>

608
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:39,010
<i>Forgive me.</i>

609
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:26,452
<i>There's so much love inside us.</i>

610
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,291
<i>That never gets out.</i>

611
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:00,486
<i>Have mercy on me.</i>

612
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:05,699
<i>According to your unfailing love,</i>

613
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,209
<i>your great compassion,</i>

614
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,830
<i>blot out my transgressions.</i>

615
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:41,109
<i>My son.</i>

616
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:45,989
<i>I know you.</i>

617
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:54,206
<i>I know you have a soul.</i>

618
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:17,483
<i>Seems you're alone.</i>

619
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,690
<i>You're not.</i>

620
01:38:22,397 --> 01:38:26,652
<i>Even now,
He's taking your hand and guiding you</i>

621
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:28,365
<i>by a way you cannot see.</i>

622
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:34,664
If you are unhappy, you shouldn't
take it as a mark of God's disfavor.

623
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:40,958
Just the contrary.
Might be the very sign He loves you.

624
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:45,800
He shows His love
not by helping you avoid suffering,

625
01:38:45,962 --> 01:38:49,182
by sending you suffering,

626
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:53,515
<i>by keeping you there.</i>

627
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:01,068
To suffer binds you to something
higher than yourself,

628
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:03,275
higher than your own will.

629
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:05,281
Takes you from the world

630
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:09,361
to find what lies beyond it.

631
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:18,750
<i>We are not only to endure
patiently the troubles He sends,</i>

632
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:20,913
<i>we are to regard them as gifts.</i>

633
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:28,262
<i>As gifts more precious</i>

634
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:31,223
<i>than the happiness we wish for ourselves.</i>

635
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,323
<i>Just left you behind.</i>

636
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:57,666
<i>To get burned up.</i>

637
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:10,693
<i>How do I begin?</i>

638
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:03,743
<i>Father.</i>

639
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:11,629
<i>Give me courage.</i>

640
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:18,344
<i>Strength.</i>

641
01:42:21,344 --> 01:42:23,096
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

642
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:25,935
<i>You've done well.</i>

643
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:31,608
<i>Better than me.</i>

644
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:36,234
<i>Which is the way it's supposed to be.</i>

645
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:32,233
<i>Find the light
you know in the east.</i>

646
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:36,483
<i>As a child.</i>

647
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:43,573
<i>The moon.</i>

648
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:46,659
<i>The stars.</i>

649
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:55,377
<i>They serve you.</i>

650
01:44:58,375 --> 01:45:00,377
<i>They guide you on your way.</i>

651
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,221
<i>The light in the eyes of others.</i>

652
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:18,566
<i>The pearl.</i>

653
01:46:01,146 --> 01:46:02,693
Wake up.

654
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:24,590
<i>Turn.</i>

655
01:46:34,346 --> 01:46:35,893
<i>Look.</i>

656
01:46:41,103 --> 01:46:42,650
<i>Come out.</i>

657
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:31,866
<i>My son.</i>

658
01:47:41,497 --> 01:47:43,044
<i>Remember.</i>

659
01:50:32,751 --> 01:50:34,298
<i>Begin.</i>
